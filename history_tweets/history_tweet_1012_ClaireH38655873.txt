1343894211117125633 2020-12-29 20:18:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Covid !

1343815528834596868 2020-12-29 15:06:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Joe! We are definitely improving which is all good!😍
1343814645694541825 2020-12-29 15:02:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Chris ! It's cold down here in South East degree! I bet it is a little colder where you are ! Keep well and warm !
1343814126179655681 2020-12-29 15:00:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> NO, my husband and I got some kind of winter bug.I lost most of my sense of taste and smell and it is problematic at this time of year. We are gradually improving but it has been the worse Christmas ever just to match the year !
1343813280243081216 2020-12-29 14:57:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely !
1343813132465143815 2020-12-29 14:56:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Glad you got spoilt !😍
1343812582084325377 2020-12-29 14:54:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Joe ! Hope you had yourself a jolly little Christmas !
1343811850190938112 2020-12-29 14:51:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Sue ! Hope you had a jolly Christmas and that Santa was kind to you !
1343811247339401217 2020-12-29 14:49:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bob Dylan ! What a poet !
1343809866259984385 2020-12-29 14:43:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Devolution has been a disaster!
1343809514781503489 2020-12-29 14:42:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please your majesty don't ever knight that war mongering traitor !
1343809127320064002 2020-12-29 14:40:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That enquiry will never see the light of day and Margaret Ferrier will be seen soon in Westminster. The SNP's shamelessness and corruption knows no bound.
1343808257425551367 2020-12-29 14:37:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true but the EU is too inflexible and dysfunctional and that has always been one of its problems. We won't mention the large scale corruption and the sickening wastage of money in Brussels.
1343807791321010179 2020-12-29 14:35:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Still it is always harder to be the first one to show the way !
1343807443361538048 2020-12-29 14:33:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exceeding yourself again Jess !
1343807258329821184 2020-12-29 14:33:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are just been dramatic idiots !
1343807006960967680 2020-12-29 14:32:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Socialism in theory is not a bad idea but unfortunately in history it has turned very quickly to totalitarianism , corruption and repression. The idea of respecting everyone regardless of their status is noble but human nature unfortunately is not. All we have is the rule of law.
1343805981130682368 2020-12-29 14:28:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mrs Sturgeon did not want us to have a reasonable deal with the EU. She does not want us to succeed outside the EU. Scotland is an economic basket case and without British subsidies would be bankrupt. The SNP want independence from the UK but know they can't afford it.
1343446736564531202 2020-12-28 14:40:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They cannot bring themselves to vote for anything Westminster proposes. They are a national disgrace !
1343446131842424832 2020-12-28 14:38:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly it appears so !
1343445918692085760 2020-12-28 14:37:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂

1343175656079814656 2020-12-27 20:43:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are going too far now !😡
1343175105246089216 2020-12-27 20:41:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not one bit !
1343174862672683008 2020-12-27 20:40:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have to confess I don't make my own trifle but I occasionally burn M &amp; S Special raspberry trifle and it is amazing !I am not saying it could possibly be as good as yours !😂😂
1343174275348443137 2020-12-27 20:37:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It was absolutely avoidable. What a b ...... Macron is !
1343158385865273345 2020-12-27 19:34:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I love trifle!😋
1343149880483729408 2020-12-27 19:01:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Only a little Jane! We have had various problems this year and I thought that finally we finally relax, but no! Life can be a bitch but compared to many we are lucky! Hope you are enjoying your after Christmas celebrations!
1343081755516006400 2020-12-27 14:30:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he certainly deserves a big mention and enormous thanks!
1343081430184767491 2020-12-27 14:29:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have you watched Channel 4 0r ITV lately? The ads are full of blacks , or mixed races, and black journalists are coming out of the woodworm. It has reached absurd heights!
1343080743757639682 2020-12-27 14:26:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's been a total cover up, not sure it can last though!
1342820846700810241 2020-12-26 21:13:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That would be the end of the EU !
1342818394731638785 2020-12-26 21:03:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I believe so ! Greece sadly is stuck !
1342817777648861184 2020-12-26 21:01:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why change now ?
1342815334894624769 2020-12-26 20:51:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy it !
1342814914952495105 2020-12-26 20:49:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC has become a national disgrace !
1342795285857259525 2020-12-26 19:31:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have friends and family in Paris so tend to go there. I agree with you that things have deteriorated considerably and you are much more likely to get good food in London than in Paris.
1342766518187274241 2020-12-26 17:37:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is where the French are better in that respect.They still have individual shops, not just cheesemongers but gift shops and all sorts. Their supermarkets are vile but it’s not all chains.
1342725652487798784 2020-12-26 14:55:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope so Bernie !
1342725534711754752 2020-12-26 14:54:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you sweet sir !
1342723759640346624 2020-12-26 14:47:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Slightly better Bernie but far from normal ! I hope you enjoyed your family Christmas!
1342723515687051264 2020-12-26 14:46:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately Connor we still have our winter bug . My husband is even enjoying his beers but I can't even look at wine or Champagne. It is very slowly getting better !
1342722907684925440 2020-12-26 14:44:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1342721753831899138 2020-12-26 14:39:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Glad you had a good time Connor! It does good to just let go and forget everything! Hope the head is not too sore!🙊
1342363378598215680 2020-12-25 14:55:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Nation stands proud again among independent  nations !
1342362942075879424 2020-12-25 14:53:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you Sir David for all your hard work ! Have a well deserved rest !

1342360538454614016 2020-12-25 14:44:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Without Nigel there would never have been Brexit !
1342360231469346816 2020-12-25 14:43:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merry Christmas Chris !
1342358378941734913 2020-12-25 14:35:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A little better but not much !
1342358176956559362 2020-12-25 14:35:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Back to the rubbish bin of history !

1342142284696068097 2020-12-25 00:17:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right Effie! It was a hard won battle with a very tricky opponent out to get us at every turn!
1342141339610345474 2020-12-25 00:13:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes the Brexit deal is a welcome positive step! Glad you are looking forward to a cosy Christmas at home. It’s nice to be able to please yourself and just enjoy the day.
1342132878029819906 2020-12-24 23:39:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you Jane! I have appreciated your friendship too! We are feeling a little better but not enough to celebrate Christmas! I will be glad to see the end of this year! Have a jolly Christmas and enjoy yourself!😍😍😍
1342001564878336001 2020-12-24 14:58:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it has been quite a year ! We will be delighted to see the back of it !
1342000007323508736 2020-12-24 14:51:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A little better Bernie but not enough to celebrate Christmas! Neither of us can face much food ! I hope you have a great Christmas Day !
1341998151373357057 2020-12-24 14:44:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is nightmarish ! So sorry ! What kind of pathetic creatures are these ?

1341705401759363072 2020-12-23 19:21:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are bloody livid !
1341705251896832001 2020-12-23 19:20:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ironic ain't it !
1341314126707101696 2020-12-22 17:26:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !
1341313306959745026 2020-12-22 17:23:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cruel !
1341312439430819840 2020-12-22 17:19:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is wrong with people ?
1341311952707051525 2020-12-22 17:17:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who cares about. a shortage of lettuces ? People have apparently been buying extra lettuces! Has the word gone mad?
1341311430621097986 2020-12-22 17:15:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No better I am afraid ! It's been six days now. Keith is feeling slightly stronger than me so he is doing some food shopping. I have no appetite at all and just eat yoghurts, scrambled eggs. Christmas is definitely cancelled!
1341296166881910786 2020-12-22 16:15:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Than you for your kind wishes Jane !

1341036990800818177 2020-12-21 23:05:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you Mary ! Bad bad timing !😀

1340640544679190528 2020-12-20 20:49:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There's always a silver lining !😀
1340578202532634624 2020-12-20 16:42:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> yes definitely!
1340270663643357186 2020-12-19 20:20:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Devolution has proved a disaster !
1340269641730568192 2020-12-19 20:15:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I have as usual ! I love sending and receiving cards.
1340243054842814465 2020-12-19 18:30:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Charlie I agree with you is very pleasant and a bit of an eye candy for the mature ladies. I watch the 7 o’ clock Channel 4 news. Have a lovely day!
1340236583237279745 2020-12-19 18:04:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I haven’t watched the BBC news for months. Don’t miss it !
1340217057745498112 2020-12-19 16:47:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👏👏👏
1340212742062546945 2020-12-19 16:29:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Naga has a chip on her shoulders and has an unfortunate sneering expressions. She obviously has a problem but I don't know what it is.
1340211223061774338 2020-12-19 16:23:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course not !
1339988386455707652 2020-12-19 01:38:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very heart and tasty looking dish!
1339866137782312960 2020-12-18 17:32:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scum !
1339592117505511426 2020-12-17 23:23:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fine Chris ! Hope you are well too.
1339588500937568258 2020-12-17 23:09:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes there is some appreciation but not officially. We visited the army museum in the Invalids and everything was about the Americans and the Russians. We all appreciate that the Russians suffered the most in terms of casualties and they proved to be extremely brave .
1339584531007881222 2020-12-17 22:53:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At least there is one European country which recognises our role in defeating Nazism ! The French certainly have had no such gesture towards us .
1339556047917375489 2020-12-17 21:00:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievably shocking state of affairs !
1339549152611590149 2020-12-17 20:33:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He was posturing !
1339546798554304514 2020-12-17 20:23:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it would !😀
1339546012726288386 2020-12-17 20:20:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you imagine the uproar !
1339545651588321290 2020-12-17 20:19:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good description !
1339464894844907522 2020-12-17 14:58:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is certainly the most annoying one !
1339464655538950145 2020-12-17 14:57:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This won't challenge anyone ! It is just absurd !
1339463360744710144 2020-12-17 14:52:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but he always does Sue !
1339462268686393344 2020-12-17 14:47:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In this case he is justified having a go at these two opportunist idiots !
1339461526755917824 2020-12-17 14:44:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rabble !

1339459227467870208 2020-12-17 14:35:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very wise Joe ! She never means it ! Good morning Joe !
1339288288398635011 2020-12-17 03:16:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very vibrant dish!
1339287903088893956 2020-12-17 03:14:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shocking!
1339243766725685248 2020-12-17 00:19:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not an original thought in his head, no constructive suggestions.
1339182583184285700 2020-12-16 20:16:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very wise ! Surround yourself with people who value you. It is sometimes a hard lesson to learn in life. There are plenty of "false" friends around.  https://t.co/W9QxOIfF3q

1339181609946374144 2020-12-16 20:12:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's about snow for God's sake !
1339085745395539969 2020-12-16 13:51:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No you are not !😡
1338917498679341056 2020-12-16 02:43:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wow ! Great looking food! Enjoy !
1338886524520239104 2020-12-16 00:39:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sums it up !
1338884051801935873 2020-12-16 00:30:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course not.
1338882380375928832 2020-12-16 00:23:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👏👏👏👏
1338881669768630273 2020-12-16 00:20:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1338880609154953217 2020-12-16 00:16:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s difficult to see why! He is a throwback from the 70’s with no relevance in today’s Britain.
1338879983691968513 2020-12-16 00:13:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU has not covered itself in glory in the last four years.They are in many ways like the Mafia, they make it very difficult for you to break away.
1338830303712964608 2020-12-15 20:56:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he would ! He would have given the EU whatever they wanted.
1338829941731958790 2020-12-15 20:55:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who does the f..... does he think he is ?
1338821238253350914 2020-12-15 20:20:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true! Can George Galloway rally the opposition parties? He will try.
1338820227648401408 2020-12-15 20:16:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true! Let us see what next May brings!
1338819919597760514 2020-12-15 20:15:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but surely a lot if Scots have the common sense to see what would happen with independence. Are they going to build a wall and borders between te two countries?
1338819599551303681 2020-12-15 20:14:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I realise that but surely enough Scots have the common sense to see where separating from the Union would lead?
1338818485976260608 2020-12-15 20:09:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is literally pissed with power! Her days are definitely counted . The problem is she has become addicted to power and she will not relinquish it without a fight.
1338816414048788480 2020-12-15 20:01:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is such a brilliant writer! The Red Road is one of my favourite because it deals with an extremely sensitive subject with such sensitivity and courage.
1338815607001767937 2020-12-15 19:58:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1338815209306198016 2020-12-15 19:56:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think its time the men in white took Nippy. She is delusional.
1338814687731912705 2020-12-15 19:54:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is madness!
1338787582013018113 2020-12-15 18:06:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1338787474890502144 2020-12-15 18:06:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great casting !
1338767348564713474 2020-12-15 16:46:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is turning into a farce!😡
1338737720517079040 2020-12-15 14:48:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Chris ! Have a great day !
1338735614808756226 2020-12-15 14:40:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As the saying goes" with friends like that ......."
1338735047818539010 2020-12-15 14:38:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all !
1338734840233996289 2020-12-15 14:37:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hopefully I made you smile ! 😀
1338734059917340672 2020-12-15 14:34:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Like whipped cream !😃
1338732406019411970 2020-12-15 14:27:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Flattery comes easily to you that is what you are saying ! To be fair we are all so critical of each other than it is a refreshing change when someone is actually nice! 😍
1338731104824594433 2020-12-15 14:22:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You really have a way with words you old flatterer !😃
1338730659326660608 2020-12-15 14:20:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning young man ! 😀
1338730102822199302 2020-12-15 14:18:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maffia
1338570732377436160 2020-12-15 03:45:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wonderfully yummy as always!
1338501791747633157 2020-12-14 23:11:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He always was a hypocrite!
1338494711447891968 2020-12-14 22:43:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And he also seems to care nothing for his own country ,😡
1338490533719793665 2020-12-14 22:26:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A case in hand is “The Italian Job”. The original version was so much better than the American version.
1338475791781404672 2020-12-14 21:27:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I will survive !
1338473641147850752 2020-12-14 21:19:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They won't though !
1338472558790893568 2020-12-14 21:15:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!😋
1338442018964574208 2020-12-14 19:13:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No James, if you like to think you are winning the argument that is absolutely fine.😋
1338440791665078272 2020-12-14 19:08:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cheaper option, really? I am closing this conversation.
1338437860765159426 2020-12-14 18:57:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The point James is that we won’t have to buy their products. The whole world doesn’t revolve around the EU despite what some people think. A lot of people seem to have been brainwashed regarding the EU. James time will tell!
1338435984334184449 2020-12-14 18:49:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but overall we import more from the EU than we export to them.
1338430027378143234 2020-12-14 18:26:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes exactly!
1338377945392570369 2020-12-14 14:59:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling! A very wet one !
1338372162793705473 2020-12-14 14:36:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There aren't any specific Scottish waters ! Sturgeon is just wind and piss but very annoying all the same !
1338371024975441920 2020-12-14 14:31:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What exactly is going on in Wales ?
1338370764047867910 2020-12-14 14:30:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan is starting to look worse than Jeremy Clarkson!
1338370533805727744 2020-12-14 14:29:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Macron !
1338370250690195457 2020-12-14 14:28:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This man is not worth answering. A very deluded individual !
1338369866701660160 2020-12-14 14:26:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1338369657070346244 2020-12-14 14:26:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's a good thing that you have a sense of humour my darling !😍
1338369155758776325 2020-12-14 14:24:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You poor sod !😂😂😂
1338368808881360896 2020-12-14 14:22:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet you can't wait for Friday! You probably need the rest at your age !😂🤣
1338367136260108291 2020-12-14 14:16:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning early bird !
1338366483039199233 2020-12-14 14:13:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Always !

1338360868363522049 2020-12-14 13:51:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She's the Scottish version of Mrs Merkel who is called "mutti" by the Germans, meaning I believe "little mother".
1338360231554928640 2020-12-14 13:48:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂🤣😂
1338357905146458112 2020-12-14 13:39:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because the media in this country is totally pro EU , shamelessly so !
1338224036069978123 2020-12-14 04:47:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes let’s be sensible! This will not be the last Christmas ever. 🎄🎄
1338191037769068544 2020-12-14 02:36:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Germans did not exactly behave well in World War One!
1338185762651697152 2020-12-14 02:15:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Buenas noches !😋
1338185367049134081 2020-12-14 02:13:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love it ! Make sure to have a lot of veggies with it!
1338185040786821122 2020-12-14 02:12:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You like kicking a ball about! To get back to the kitchen dare I ask what are you cooking?
1338184331857186817 2020-12-14 02:09:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Jamie Oliver is your role model!
1338183410519580675 2020-12-14 02:06:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tarzan in the kitchen! What a vision!😳
1338183187017715715 2020-12-14 02:05:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What next?😂
1338182960198148099 2020-12-14 02:04:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope you wear a pinny!
1338182753498648582 2020-12-14 02:03:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have a very short memory. Have you forgotten how they treated Mrs May humiliating and mocking and they enjoyed it.
1338182375092744194 2020-12-14 02:01:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hope you are a good cook 😋
1338180107408711682 2020-12-14 01:52:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂

1338120874873008131 2020-12-13 21:57:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a good day Connor !😍
1338118264682065926 2020-12-13 21:47:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you believe that you believe anything !😂
1338116019542503426 2020-12-13 21:38:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She certainly does!
1338086812082954243 2020-12-13 19:42:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anders, this is a parody account. Zara is a bit of a comedian not an MP.
1338084722166161409 2020-12-13 19:33:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1338084444746420227 2020-12-13 19:32:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He does surround himself with it !
1338082898818306049 2020-12-13 19:26:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not many I would think. Corbyn will surround himself with his brand of fanatics. I thought the allotment would have more allure!😂
1338080860805935107 2020-12-13 19:18:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical! It’s always us in the wrong.
1338035059736129539 2020-12-13 16:16:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What short memory some people have!
1338033325076832257 2020-12-13 16:09:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good idea ! Sod the Scottish fishermen ! and let me crawl up the EU's arse !
1338032879608197120 2020-12-13 16:07:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would judge him a self important sanctimonious pillock ! He should go and dig his non racist garden wherever that might be .
1338031760626552832 2020-12-13 16:03:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All two of them ?😂
1338030740257255426 2020-12-13 15:59:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Always on the enemy's side !😡
1338028859057446918 2020-12-13 15:51:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👏👏👏👏
1338026520292560896 2020-12-13 15:42:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sorry about the repeat !
1338025929306726400 2020-12-13 15:40:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think London is going to go into tier 3 by next weekend!
1338025210646290433 2020-12-13 15:37:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1338024516581281793 2020-12-13 15:34:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie! I am going to miss our pre Christmas get together!😍
1338024327841722368 2020-12-13 15:33:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This country has never let itself be bullied ! The British don't look for trouble but will stand up for themselves if necessary.
1338021314532093952 2020-12-13 15:21:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Same old !
1338017242907373571 2020-12-13 15:05:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is it so difficult for some to accept the results of the referendum ? The arrogance of it ...
1338015140952875008 2020-12-13 14:57:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think the EU has shown its true colours throughout these negotiations and it is not a pretty sight .
1337827389695553547 2020-12-13 02:31:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋
1337826838274576389 2020-12-13 02:29:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt it but she was right.
1337826306814304259 2020-12-13 02:27:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She will end up hated.
1337824182449606658 2020-12-13 02:18:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> LA Confidential.
1337823799622950912 2020-12-13 02:17:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We know who the idiot is.😂
1337823102349275141 2020-12-13 02:14:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What’s this about a stick?😳
1337822433399730177 2020-12-13 02:11:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is reassuring to see that all is well in France!
1337821037321392135 2020-12-13 02:06:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are too thoughtful Mickey!😂😂
1337820005115846660 2020-12-13 02:01:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or lemon juice.
1337819528609280006 2020-12-13 02:00:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some remoaners will be plotting to reverse the Brexit process.
1337819258651373576 2020-12-13 01:59:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1337817480090292227 2020-12-13 01:51:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have not watched since the early 80’s.
1337817179119620098 2020-12-13 01:50:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with you. She is on the way out and the sooner the better!
1337815908258033665 2020-12-13 01:45:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enough is enough!
1337815351959166977 2020-12-13 01:43:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell it like it is !

1337812354642358275 2020-12-13 01:31:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So with all due respect you are not a believer of democracy? The results of a referendum have to be respected and acted upon. It’s that simple !
1337811210536955904 2020-12-13 01:27:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s uncanny Jane! We are definitely sisters!😍

1337793899914473478 2020-12-13 00:18:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I was born in the 1950’s so I am no spring chicken but people do comment that I look younger than I am and I am definitely young at heart. When I thought you I thought you would be in your forties and definitely younger than me.😋

1337734414009307137 2020-12-12 20:21:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This woman is an insufferable gobshite. She is not immune to been taken to task for her pronouncements. Racism works both way.
1337729507604697088 2020-12-12 20:02:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe you have an idea about my age because the photo of my grandfather in World War One, just saying.

1337675452626964483 2020-12-12 16:27:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> To be fait John the metric system is simpler.
1337669606027227138 2020-12-12 16:04:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For the moment the EU is the 4th Reich! The end of the third was not pretty.
1337666327457259523 2020-12-12 15:51:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True enough but what is the point of them?
1337664366934691841 2020-12-12 15:43:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wonderful !
1337664173128507394 2020-12-12 15:42:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question !
1337664033160392705 2020-12-12 15:42:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sound advice !
1337663428207513600 2020-12-12 15:39:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What an unimpressive man he is . He was trumpeted as the Prime Minister in waiting.
1337662666136055809 2020-12-12 15:36:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Interestingly enough a lot of youngsters who said that now with Brexit their lives and prospects lied in ruins had no intention of learning any foreign language.
1337661642218348544 2020-12-12 15:32:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The media are becoming quite ridiculous and infantile !
1337661304564310023 2020-12-12 15:31:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Journalists do nothing else but use leading questions. The result is we only get their opinions.
1337660919711731712 2020-12-12 15:29:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! It seems surprisingly low nowadays.
1337660714266267648 2020-12-12 15:29:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And expect gloom and doom broadcasting from the whole media.
1337660272304123904 2020-12-12 15:27:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And bullies and smug know it alls usually with their own particular self interest.
1337659538007347200 2020-12-12 15:24:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have seen precious statecraft from the EU. Macron is trumpeting like a medieval war lord . If Boris acted like that Starmer would be the first to criticise. How on earth did he get to be a QC .
1337658480245829636 2020-12-12 15:20:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And will do so ! Look how badly they handled the pandemic and the disgusting treatment of the Italians.
1337658102439669761 2020-12-12 15:18:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A terrifying thought ! I think he has got to be a spoof because he is over the top .
1337656600597852160 2020-12-12 15:12:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Her days are counted !
1337656488572178434 2020-12-12 15:12:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely beautiful !
1337655981975724032 2020-12-12 15:10:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He teaches philosophy!
1337655801314414597 2020-12-12 15:09:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So much worse ! Thank God for the common sense of the British people!
1337655119832342528 2020-12-12 15:06:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This country repaid its war debts to the USA but did we get any reparation funds from Germany ? Nein
1337654783818260482 2020-12-12 15:05:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When are the men in white coming for him? I think it's time.
1337654421073883143 2020-12-12 15:04:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are right !
1337654204895203328 2020-12-12 15:03:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this man for real ???😏😏
1337652380570148864 2020-12-12 14:55:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👏👏👏👏👏
1337651071242612737 2020-12-12 14:50:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The point is that this federal union was always intended but the British public was not told. It was sold to us as an economic union .
1337649293419819010 2020-12-12 14:43:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1337648138220351488 2020-12-12 14:39:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Refusing to speak to the British Prime Minister is inexcusable ! The EU has shown how contemptuous they are of us to their cost !

1337455568538185732 2020-12-12 01:53:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is hardly surprising after last year’s antics in the House if Commons .
1337452660895703040 2020-12-12 01:42:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question! Give it a few years and she will be forgotten.

1337278864586903553 2020-12-11 14:11:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The original plans were kept from us by the likes of Edward Heath because they knew we would not agree with them!

1336921135666094081 2020-12-10 14:30:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You don't honestly think any of this will actually happen, do you ? Who will want to pay £30.00 for a four week turkey that could not drive from London to Brighton and back and what about Health &amp; safety with all the wires strung across pavements.
1336920363461177344 2020-12-10 14:27:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We know your game Mother Scotland !

1336918124562690048 2020-12-10 14:18:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Chris ! Have a lovely day !
1336917711306231808 2020-12-10 14:16:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cambridge education is a wonderful thing !😂
1336916843643219969 2020-12-10 14:13:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> People have a tendency to underestimate Boris .
1336916051704111109 2020-12-10 14:10:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on !
1336912655509032960 2020-12-10 13:56:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think there has been enough procrastination !
1336911745294721025 2020-12-10 13:52:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Make myself a cup of coffee .
1336910676648992768 2020-12-10 13:48:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And who needs Roquefort when you can have Shropshire blue ? ( that is if you like blue cheeses)
1336909818339209218 2020-12-10 13:45:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> YES !!!

1336752047115341825 2020-12-10 03:18:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most people respond very well to a smile or nod. Since the beginning of the pandemic there is more curtesy and friendliness and awareness of others.
1336751239682535425 2020-12-10 03:15:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The unbelievable cheek of the man!
1336734167728611329 2020-12-10 02:07:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1336725594025975809 2020-12-10 01:33:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely senseless!
1336724195229790210 2020-12-10 01:27:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1336722956056219649 2020-12-10 01:22:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1336722184098689031 2020-12-10 01:19:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Extremely high I am afraid!🙁

1336662021492895744 2020-12-09 21:20:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is nice ! I have had a similar experience a few times when I wear "Seasalt Cornwall" dresses which have a 1950 look. They are feminine and smart.
1336658545853542401 2020-12-09 21:06:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You wish !😀

1336572068897361920 2020-12-09 15:23:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly Chris!😋
1336568772585517056 2020-12-09 15:10:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Joe !
1336567553737547776 2020-12-09 15:05:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1336566442318311425 2020-12-09 15:00:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't think you are the only one !😂

1336558892164276224 2020-12-09 14:30:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is marvellous about this interview is the gentleman been interviewed.
1336557929554735105 2020-12-09 14:26:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wonderful !
1336556115061043200 2020-12-09 14:19:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is right about what I was commenting on .
1336555885729095682 2020-12-09 14:18:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The doom mongers back in force !

1336555065226702848 2020-12-09 14:15:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a great day Chris !
1336553994148319232 2020-12-09 14:11:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I suppose he wants to be seen to have done is utmost. It's just a little bit of political theatre. Both sides are going to blame each other .
1336553403216957446 2020-12-09 14:08:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely right !
1336390413616357380 2020-12-09 03:21:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes absolutely!
1336378048489385990 2020-12-09 02:32:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The SNP ‘s hate of the English is not rational and this strange notion that Scotland would prosper if independent is wishful thinking.
1336377416512659456 2020-12-09 02:29:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As always a very appetising looking dish! Perfect!😋
1336369760834088971 2020-12-09 01:59:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too and Dennis Skinner.
1336368040947175428 2020-12-09 01:52:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mrs Starmer looks very nice.
1336351146395521035 2020-12-09 00:45:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cruel!🙊
1336350838676189190 2020-12-09 00:44:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So very true!
1336315130364235777 2020-12-08 22:22:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There  is never been any obligation to participate in it . Some countries like Italy I think dropped out
1336267207203033089 2020-12-08 19:11:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, irritating in the extreme and totally self serving!😋
1336241986374864900 2020-12-08 17:31:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good idea!
1336231036125065218 2020-12-08 16:47:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s the way to be !
1336229836495450114 2020-12-08 16:43:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well put Joe! Hope you have a nice day as the Americans would say!
1336228832165175301 2020-12-08 16:39:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning sweetie 😋
1336227844901531648 2020-12-08 16:35:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no point extending the trade negotiations. The EU is not acting in good faith.
1336227399202197504 2020-12-08 16:33:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No idea but then who can believe anything Piers says? He is a shameless self publicist.
1336216983864549378 2020-12-08 15:52:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Courage
1336216639948414979 2020-12-08 15:50:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not worth bothering about!😋
1336210121043697664 2020-12-08 15:24:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😍😍😍
1336206501816492032 2020-12-08 15:10:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1336206127915278336 2020-12-08 15:09:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he is !
1336204401497804802 2020-12-08 15:02:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Chris !
1336152553894137858 2020-12-08 11:36:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A fish won’t decapitate you or groom children.
1336152371743830019 2020-12-08 11:35:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1336151420324749312 2020-12-08 11:31:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously the latter! The remoaners are not going to go quietly! There will be some difficulties next year and they will be screaming to rejoin. A lot of these people have a personal interest in staying in the EU.
1335930159434768386 2020-12-07 20:52:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I totally agree with you !
1335929979054534657 2020-12-07 20:51:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good move ! Some judges are ridiculous.
1335928795157630982 2020-12-07 20:46:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the result of generations of leftie educators !
1335928030670282756 2020-12-07 20:43:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's nice !
1335927783244107776 2020-12-07 20:42:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Tara !
1335920232574185472 2020-12-07 20:12:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1335910452904284160 2020-12-07 19:34:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have had a Navy since before Henry the 8th time! I assume you mean that we are actually going to use it to protect British waters that includes turning back boatloads of refugees.
1335843417738407936 2020-12-07 15:07:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It can’t go on much longer surely?😳
1335839988177661954 2020-12-07 14:54:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I predict that within a few years no one will be talking about Harry and Meghan. They will become nonentities.
1335838914813292546 2020-12-07 14:49:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surprise ! Surprise !
1335837751506309120 2020-12-07 14:45:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Probably not ! He will be too busy ranting on about the  Milwall fans!
1335837425277558785 2020-12-07 14:43:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just teasing you as per usual !
1335836953766481921 2020-12-07 14:42:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning sweetheart ! Have a good and productive day ! No slacking allowed.😜
1335836355717427200 2020-12-07 14:39:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very well thank you ! it is kind of you to ask !
1335836026368122880 2020-12-07 14:38:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is this George so offensive to this nation ? What is his problem ?
1335835347373207554 2020-12-07 14:35:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do ! A great film !

1335832880698822656 2020-12-07 14:25:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and never ever had a good word to say about any  Conservatives .
1335832524753395712 2020-12-07 14:24:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes quite right ! I can't understand why all our institutions and the Media are support the BLM Party.
1335832156875218944 2020-12-07 14:22:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And this sad spectacle is our present Police force ! How standards have plummeted in every way .
1335831533022801920 2020-12-07 14:20:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too babes !
1335831459182108673 2020-12-07 14:20:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is it that some people in this country seem to care some much more about every other country but their own?

1335829361589690369 2020-12-07 14:11:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our politicians many years ago trashed our fishing industry to enter the common market. They readily gave away a large portion of our  https://t.co/KtXY9L2p2L usual we got nothing back in return.
1335827533829435394 2020-12-07 14:04:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Impressive !
1335827445308592128 2020-12-07 14:04:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet more BBC political trash !
1335822740188770305 2020-12-07 13:45:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a brilliant idea !

1335652112685035527 2020-12-07 02:27:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well last year the FA forbade the wearing of poppies, so the players were not given the option.
1335650405506748417 2020-12-07 02:20:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Couldn’t put it better myself!

1335577382200152066 2020-12-06 21:30:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it was very funny ! Great script and all the actors were superb!
1335576590672154625 2020-12-06 21:27:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe this is tongue in cheek ? Just asking ?
1335576264875384832 2020-12-06 21:26:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would have loved to have seen her in concert. A little frail woman with such a powerful voice. I saw Elaine Page playing Piaf in the musical based on her life and it was a great experience. Bon dimanche !
1335574970924212224 2020-12-06 21:21:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Je viens de l'écouter ! Il faut dire que je ne m'en lasse jamais !😍

1335570036866605056 2020-12-06 21:01:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't like Marxist extremists like the likes of Granny Lineker !
1335568801438588936 2020-12-06 20:56:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not many of them about !
1335568656684769282 2020-12-06 20:55:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth is you are a parody account. No real person could be that stupid !
1335567166612135936 2020-12-06 20:50:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How could we have ever voted for these bunch of losers!
1335566667024314368 2020-12-06 20:48:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite ridiculous !
1335566152454574080 2020-12-06 20:45:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I seriously think a lot of people will boycott French products as they are heartily sick of the French causing trouble for them. So much for the "Entente cordiale" !
1335564459897741312 2020-12-06 20:39:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is time someone "slammed" Lineker !
1335564025632059393 2020-12-06 20:37:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes this is what comes of looking after your voters !
1335563681082564609 2020-12-06 20:36:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Corbyn was the imbecile who wanted submarines but with no missiles !
1335563119737905152 2020-12-06 20:33:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Khan should be crated up ready for removal . The Thames is near by .........
1335562793471389698 2020-12-06 20:32:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You said it ! 😂
1335562679092645888 2020-12-06 20:32:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !😀
1335562310627233793 2020-12-06 20:30:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you might ! 😜
1335558371219533824 2020-12-06 20:15:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I suggest the all vile Labour Party f.   off to Europe and stay there.
1335557679641747457 2020-12-06 20:12:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please don’t darling!😳
1335509845005512704 2020-12-06 17:02:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope not!
1335488894046007296 2020-12-06 15:38:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏
1335488808016621569 2020-12-06 15:38:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The simple answer is and we all know it is that she is SNP and Cummings is Conservative.
1335488205446111232 2020-12-06 15:36:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dawn French is a bit of a leftie luvi!
1335487831934984193 2020-12-06 15:34:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too darling!😋
1335487548718772224 2020-12-06 15:33:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris! A very wet and cold morning in South East London!😍
1335486131387969536 2020-12-06 15:28:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a disgusting trashing of a well loved TV series to score a political point! Let us hope it is another BBC turkey!
1335484706616467456 2020-12-06 15:22:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am surprised the SNP don’t burn Neil’s books in the middle of Glasgow.
1335484385924100096 2020-12-06 15:21:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The SNP does not like educated opposition because it cannot handle it. Neil Oliver is certainly not a fake historian. They are trying to cancel him.
1335482766201393152 2020-12-06 15:14:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is particularly annoying isthat they are still referring to a second referendum as a “People’s vote”. Weasel words. Boris was not gifted anything . People voted decisively for what they wanted.
1335475878160162817 2020-12-06 14:47:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Loved that album!😍
1335475403520143360 2020-12-06 14:45:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ziggy Stardust!😋
1335472596977115138 2020-12-06 14:34:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Does the BBC ever learn ? every day they are putting another nail on their coffin !
1335469878812307461 2020-12-06 14:23:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC seems rather good at inventing things !
1335468803774410754 2020-12-06 14:19:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would like to see Femi in the "Wehrmacht"!
1335468189493440517 2020-12-06 14:16:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is extraordinary how some people think ! This man is as bad as Edward Heath !
1335467007639220224 2020-12-06 14:12:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so ! The main concern for the EU is that if/when we make a success of Brexit it will certainly encourage other EU countries to follow suit. It took courage for us to stand up to them but we have done this sort of thing before . Remember Napoleon and Hitler !
1335464376162258944 2020-12-06 14:01:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It just annoys people! Totally counter productive and the BLM is an American movement.
1335463424407515137 2020-12-06 13:57:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Macron is a little reminiscent of Napoleon and seems to want to become the new leader of the EU. His problem is that he is hated by many at home and not particularly popular with other EU countries.
1335462934185734145 2020-12-06 13:55:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> About time !
1335462197972115458 2020-12-06 13:52:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's a tricky one ! 😂
1335461306674147328 2020-12-06 13:49:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This has got to stop! People are getting seriously angry ! The law has to be seen to be impartial !
1335456770869833728 2020-12-06 13:31:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so !👏👏
1335456065916448769 2020-12-06 13:28:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is lovely to see London our great city coming back to life again !
1335455782553481216 2020-12-06 13:27:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nope !
1335454648120070144 2020-12-06 13:22:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Sturgeon is absolutely shameless .!😡😡
1335303769358299138 2020-12-06 03:23:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Funny enough I had a prawn curry and onion baggies and basmati rice curtesy of M&amp;S today! Enjoyed it!😋
1335302362022473732 2020-12-06 03:17:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mouth watering !
1335260765050331141 2020-12-06 00:32:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant!
1335253773485281281 2020-12-06 00:04:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt it !
1335252178995466242 2020-12-05 23:58:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are such a wise man!😋
1335251702145028098 2020-12-05 23:56:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We just have a phenomenal memory and a give great attention to details. Of course we are also very kind and forgiving , almost perfect really!🙈🙈
1335250838151974912 2020-12-05 23:53:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Amazing shot!
1335249776900788233 2020-12-05 23:48:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we must be taken very seriously and as you probably know from experience we never forget anything!😋
1335247535519260672 2020-12-05 23:39:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I presume you are joking?
1335210825687199745 2020-12-05 21:14:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> One of many !
1335210391815802880 2020-12-05 21:12:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are getting there !🙂
1335207765199958016 2020-12-05 21:01:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is called Somerset Brie.
1335207555166040064 2020-12-05 21:01:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They haven’t made either marks for about 40 years.
1335207045453275139 2020-12-05 20:59:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perfectly justifiable position!
1335206770256523269 2020-12-05 20:57:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we did it to make sure the Germans could not get their hands on it !
1335206418312552452 2020-12-05 20:56:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We make Brie in this country and it is really nice!
1335183279650172928 2020-12-05 19:24:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning sweetie!
1335180202117312512 2020-12-05 19:12:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surely not !😂
1335151414323126273 2020-12-05 17:17:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They probably say the same about us !😋
1335146134671675393 2020-12-05 16:56:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very inviting!
1335142297705582592 2020-12-05 16:41:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We could ask for Calais back but strangely enough we don’t want it back!😂
1335141821882753025 2020-12-05 16:39:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s an Americanism! 😡
1335140800670420995 2020-12-05 16:35:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He’s an embarrassment!
1335122272210866178 2020-12-05 15:22:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes indeed, however if you ever visit their “Musee de l’armee” you will be shocked to find hardly any mention of the British. Apparently the Americans and De Gaulle did it all !
1335120540290457600 2020-12-05 15:15:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but I still love the Rioja wines!☹️
1335115564923150336 2020-12-05 14:55:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course! Another tale of corruption in the Labour Party!
1335115323826188289 2020-12-05 14:54:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not! What I do like is French cider from Britanny .
1335104358162305024 2020-12-05 14:10:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some SNP followers are living in Lala land. They probably want to keep Stirling, keep the Queen and God knows what else? They could become the basket case of Europe!
1335102562652090369 2020-12-05 14:03:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not for long I am pleased to say !
1335102047838990336 2020-12-05 14:01:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The French fishermen will certainly have a go at our fishing boats ? The Royal Navy will have to play its part !
1335096197657354242 2020-12-05 13:38:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievable ! It's a bad joke !
1335095713173221376 2020-12-05 13:36:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can't understand the rationale behind it ! How does it make a product more appealing ?🙄
1335095261857779712 2020-12-05 13:34:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am just trying to be practical Claire ! I love the look !😉
1335094953807138817 2020-12-05 13:33:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite a few mixed marriages whites and blacks.
1335094746004459520 2020-12-05 13:32:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are getting there !
1335094571521486848 2020-12-05 13:32:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neither do I thank you !
1335094256319475712 2020-12-05 13:30:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1335093885438205954 2020-12-05 13:29:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What I am referring to is that from personal experience I find facial hair sometimes feels like sandpaper and my skin gets irritated.However I do like the look of it !🙂
1335092048186257408 2020-12-05 13:22:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely ! Why don't they offer big paper bags in the supermarkets like they do in America ?
1335090637117468674 2020-12-05 13:16:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so !
1335090490333650944 2020-12-05 13:15:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not so good for the ladies ! 😂
1335089838266183681 2020-12-05 13:13:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They can't get enough of it there !
1335089292666875906 2020-12-05 13:11:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We should also try whenever possible to buy vegetables and fruits in season.
1335072859056713728 2020-12-05 12:05:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1334973256110141440 2020-12-05 05:30:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I much prefer Spanish wines.
1334970528998813707 2020-12-05 05:19:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he was an ungrateful bastard!
1334965506051362823 2020-12-05 04:59:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> De Gaule might be an exception!😋
1334961332614029312 2020-12-05 04:42:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are quoting Jeremy Clarkson!😋
1334960794417721346 2020-12-05 04:40:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds fair enough!
1334957320774832128 2020-12-05 04:26:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but half of English is actuallyFrench !The Normans came, stayed and brought their language . By the Middle Ages the Normans were all speaking English.Bonsoir mon ami  😋
1334943054835425289 2020-12-05 03:30:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough!
1334942958307717121 2020-12-05 03:29:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes really nice! I can’t see myself giving them up.😋
1334941987376680963 2020-12-05 03:25:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do like my Rioja wines!
1334941854937341958 2020-12-05 03:25:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely!
1334936763375247361 2020-12-05 03:05:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I totally agree with you, but the truth is that compared to the Spaniards and the French we are not a fish eating nation. It is such a wonderful natural asset and so good for our health. We need a culture change.
1334935839000944641 2020-12-05 03:01:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! I realised no cooking was involved.😋
1334934567115952134 2020-12-05 02:56:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! She will end up having to be dragged out kicking and screaming!She will leave in disgrace!
1334934087904145408 2020-12-05 02:54:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is unbelievable and she is addicted to power.
1334933687163613191 2020-12-05 02:52:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes the EU grudgingly will definitely have to concede on some  https://t.co/paTA1foIpx for Boris you are absolutely right, and of course he knows this. What the EU really want would be to extend the trade deals into next year so that they could get money from us for a bit longer.
1334931918719229952 2020-12-05 02:45:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it does!
1334931526237237251 2020-12-05 02:44:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nippy is absolutely shameless! Auschwitz is a massive murder scene. What kind of a person would want to pose in front of the death camp? Sick.
1334930945930108933 2020-12-05 02:41:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have to strike where it hurts. I think there is going to be a deal but God knows what are going to have to concede.
1334930490759974914 2020-12-05 02:40:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I meant to write “Up yours Delors “!🙈🙈
1334929426207928325 2020-12-05 02:35:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am still hoping that you are going to take an evening off!😋
1334927213725093888 2020-12-05 02:27:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1334920732732780554 2020-12-05 02:01:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!😋
1334918471356968967 2020-12-05 01:52:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tasty as always! A feast for the eyes and healthy too!
1334915501848408066 2020-12-05 01:40:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, a lot of these lefties are shit stirring parasites who expect a lot and have little to offer us except trouble and criticism!
1334914183436054528 2020-12-05 01:35:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So much for the country of cats and dogs boilers.
1334911237889679361 2020-12-05 01:23:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Left seems to have no consideration for its own citizens. If they despise us ordinary people so much why do they stay here? We are going nowhere . All we want is to live in a just fair society.
1334887222164774913 2020-12-04 23:48:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1334882782301073416 2020-12-04 23:30:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would sum him as a pretentious idiot Jane !😋
1334882477370990592 2020-12-04 23:29:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Indeed why not? Why are we not all treated the same?
1334853194036486144 2020-12-04 21:32:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Mickey Mouse plastic philosopher strikes again!😂
1334851871127777282 2020-12-04 21:27:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This looks like a botched bad taste fashion shoot!
1334850781992919040 2020-12-04 21:23:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1334847221163057155 2020-12-04 21:09:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The silly country just carries on regardless ! No wonder they flock here !
1334841206019395585 2020-12-04 20:45:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The whole of Europe will shit themselves !🙂
1334840851491598336 2020-12-04 20:43:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they will but it depends just how much they compromise.
1334840063289602049 2020-12-04 20:40:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It just shows which side they are on, and it is definitely not yours!
1334839516159471617 2020-12-04 20:38:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> To quote an old headline from I think "The Sun" , "Hope yours Delors"!
1334817258858754051 2020-12-04 19:10:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No French cars, no French cheeses, no French wines ! Two can play this game! I don’t think the French Government knows what it is taking on !
1334774430187327488 2020-12-04 16:19:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I noticed! Early bird ....
1334763443350614017 2020-12-04 15:36:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You sure did!
1334763037337800706 2020-12-04 15:34:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1334752613355708417 2020-12-04 14:53:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beneath contempt! Exploiting people’s miseries !
1334750483248975874 2020-12-04 14:44:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think it is !Some people have stopped thinking for themselves and just want to be instructed. Common sense? What's that ?🥺

1334559565547966468 2020-12-04 02:06:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cheeky!😋
1334558855548841987 2020-12-04 02:03:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true!
1334558570176798720 2020-12-04 02:02:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think almost the whole population feels that way!
1334554568630394881 2020-12-04 01:46:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More fear mongering !
1334541484599685120 2020-12-04 00:54:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That was the reason it all started, so it makes sense.
1334536139907194880 2020-12-04 00:33:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So do I !
1334536086664704000 2020-12-04 00:32:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s very irritating in the same way as people who start every sentence with “so” and say “you know” every two minutes. This is the land of Shakespeare!
1334535291579797504 2020-12-04 00:29:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is pathetic! What is wrong with the media that they promote such intellectual piggy’s?😳
1334534404757188608 2020-12-04 00:26:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is anyone giving this idiot the time of day? Is it because he is hobby and black. It is not because of his intellect!😋
1334534004700307457 2020-12-04 00:24:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Twice!😡
1334533711761641472 2020-12-04 00:23:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Might be a good idea!😋
1334533263034085377 2020-12-04 00:21:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can imagine!🙊🙊
1334532966807195655 2020-12-04 00:20:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thaf’s a relief!😂
1334532809499832320 2020-12-04 00:19:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She will not, it would choke her!
1334531392009596934 2020-12-04 00:14:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is eye catching though!😀
1334531124161372169 2020-12-04 00:13:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you had to go into hospital for whatever reason you would have to take a Covid test, otherwise not.Masks I agree are pretty useless .
1334530542088359936 2020-12-04 00:10:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Could it be pollock?😳
1334530279583703052 2020-12-04 00:09:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely beautiful!

1334522862699491330 2020-12-03 23:40:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes!
1334481161800863744 2020-12-03 20:54:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The answer is that Nippy knows that Scotland alone could not possibly afford it but of course she is not saying that !
1334479917371842561 2020-12-03 20:49:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is still in diapers !
1334479456069689347 2020-12-03 20:47:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All this is bloody stupid !
1334479185214124034 2020-12-03 20:46:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1334478863506808833 2020-12-03 20:45:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1334478686758821889 2020-12-03 20:44:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the treatment you get when you are a hate figure of the left . Lord Adonis wanted to get rid of the statue of Cronwell !
1334478202912321536 2020-12-03 20:42:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Boris knows he cannot give in to Macron's totally unreasonable demands !
1334477767631642624 2020-12-03 20:41:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do like a positive politician ! I suppose you would have handled the crisis so much better ! You and your third party really are a joke and you know it !
1334453425178894336 2020-12-03 19:04:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Their priorities are those of the mad house!
1334406703450877952 2020-12-03 15:58:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Right!
1334405305858449414 2020-12-03 15:53:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can see you are slightly biased 😋
1334404302127964160 2020-12-03 15:49:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You love it really! Don’t be so coy!😏
1334403777810542592 2020-12-03 15:47:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have left the EU already.
1334403334611099653 2020-12-03 15:45:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can well believe that!😋
1334402871568240640 2020-12-03 15:43:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very wise!😀
1334402323305607169 2020-12-03 15:41:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure one weetabix a day does the job!🙊
1334402136554303488 2020-12-03 15:40:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course but that is the BLM’s main objective to worsen race relations and then tell us what a racist society we are.
1334401608768233473 2020-12-03 15:38:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very regular!😋

1334399665530413061 2020-12-03 15:30:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How can that be allowed?
1334399566867816448 2020-12-03 15:30:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Joe! You are mocking the afflicted but great fun!
1334399051521986560 2020-12-03 15:28:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fantastic news!
1334398145552392193 2020-12-03 15:24:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How the remoaners hate to hear about any positive Brexit news? and if they are animal lovers surely they must be pleased about the ban on exporting live animals?
1334397306054053889 2020-12-03 15:21:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly absolutely true!
1334396567525224448 2020-12-03 15:18:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why does this vile woman get so much exposure.
1334395449529282560 2020-12-03 15:14:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not !
1334393916137893888 2020-12-03 15:07:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes of course !
1334393793349554178 2020-12-03 15:07:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Officially we left on the 21st of December 2019!
1334393412020301827 2020-12-03 15:05:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great advice !
1334392586593824768 2020-12-03 15:02:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That could be the nail in the coffin of any relationship ! A boyfriend once bought me a big bin ! Maybe he was trying to tell me something !🤣
1334392245718560769 2020-12-03 15:01:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You mean thing !🤣
1334390882494275585 2020-12-03 14:55:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think also Debenhams become outdated and a very poor and boring shopping experience. Their presentation was third rate.
1334390503975112705 2020-12-03 14:54:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true !

1334389851026841601 2020-12-03 14:51:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have a good imagination, say no more !
1334389716276359173 2020-12-03 14:51:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are a lot of self appointed righteous supervisors !
1334389349354516481 2020-12-03 14:49:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet you are a right little devil really !🤣

1334385017863204864 2020-12-03 14:32:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem with the EU is that they don't want Great Britain to succeed at anything ! Vindictive little bastards!

1334126625173147649 2020-12-02 21:25:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Mark !
1334126367051485186 2020-12-02 21:24:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hardly ! He has a lot of competition for the title. At least he is not a war criminal or a traitor !
1334125779605737474 2020-12-02 21:22:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about these criminals' respects for others! These are not petty thieves and have committed some pretty serious crimes. Let us have a little more sympathy for their victims.
1334069619800354816 2020-12-02 17:39:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I stopped buying French butter a couple of years now. What I don’t want to give up on my Rioja vines.☹️
1334069092823789568 2020-12-02 17:37:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How upsetting for you and the family. So sorry!
1334063073838194692 2020-12-02 17:13:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> After that demonstration I am going to make it! It’s so delicious!🙂
1334062805914357761 2020-12-02 17:12:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling!
1334036460505272321 2020-12-02 15:27:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy yourself !
1334033249983664128 2020-12-02 15:14:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day!😍
1334031508424826885 2020-12-02 15:07:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Claire!
1334027676051513346 2020-12-02 14:52:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you ! Have a good one too !
1334027371888963584 2020-12-02 14:51:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1334027089574498310 2020-12-02 14:50:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Joe !
1334022498443210753 2020-12-02 14:32:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Claire ! Very festive looking tree !
1334021925006417925 2020-12-02 14:29:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He must have a problem interacting with women ! Not a ad looking chap. He must be shy !
1334021515533225985 2020-12-02 14:28:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I love potato roosts, a little tricky to make though. We were in Switzerland last September and we ate the best rosti ever. I watched Masterchef last night and we were given a great demonstration by Marcus Waring.
1334020354268934144 2020-12-02 14:23:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is also a political drawback to Scotland joining the EU. The Spanish Government has been fighting separatism in Spain with Catalonia and would oppose Scotland joining the EU.
1334018325911834624 2020-12-02 14:15:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😆😆😆
1334017064034586624 2020-12-02 14:10:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling !
1334016967150358529 2020-12-02 14:10:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please ! Give me strength !🤣🙉
1334016777878188033 2020-12-02 14:09:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just about sums it up !
1334016691567816704 2020-12-02 14:08:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When it suits her agenda she does and she lies beautifully !
1334016371932459011 2020-12-02 14:07:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The years have been kind to you Bette ! Many happy returns !😍
1334015539467980801 2020-12-02 14:04:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Rick ! Enough is enough ! The whole process has turned into a farce and a constant attempt to trip us up.
1334015034977087489 2020-12-02 14:02:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant !
1334014524689682433 2020-12-02 14:00:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely spot on !
1333855968015290368 2020-12-02 03:30:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋
1333854597765586954 2020-12-02 03:24:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The whole process has been torturous and the only good thing is that it is coming to an end.
1333853067981299714 2020-12-02 03:18:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem is that one county’s veto can stop a deal!
1333818637157806082 2020-12-02 01:01:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😍😍😍
1333817082379644938 2020-12-02 00:55:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are a tough cookie with a soft centre! Hope this makes sense 😋
1333814814653734914 2020-12-02 00:46:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem is giving someone the benefit of the doubt or tolerating their rudeness never ends well. As soon as someone is rude to me that’s it I am off.
1333814202050482179 2020-12-02 00:44:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes!
1333813490272886786 2020-12-02 00:41:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most probably!
1333813091314917377 2020-12-02 00:39:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are probably too tolerant.😋
1333759027092856832 2020-12-01 21:05:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Honestly!🙈🙈🙈
1333754804523372547 2020-12-01 20:48:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anything for self publicity !
1333754571550830594 2020-12-01 20:47:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1333750768692817920 2020-12-01 20:32:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It could be catchy ! You could be our next domestic goddess!
1333749451802947585 2020-12-01 20:27:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is just playing himself ! Hardly acting !
1333749085107531777 2020-12-01 20:25:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I will thank you ! Have a lovely day ! Here in South East London it is a beautiful, sunny and blue skies !
1333748633297170432 2020-12-01 20:23:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Total irrelevance !
1333748474257543170 2020-12-01 20:23:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She's got the lips for it !
1333748361330122756 2020-12-01 20:22:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I mean really ! Do women scare him that much ?
1333748144954335238 2020-12-01 20:21:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievable !
1333747257359937536 2020-12-01 20:18:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Probably !😀
1333745734743678976 2020-12-01 20:12:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is such a bad actor too ! His facial expressions never change !
1333744549223657472 2020-12-01 20:07:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer is an opportunist ! What are his values?
1333743056202424320 2020-12-01 20:01:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well she won't give you lip !🙉

1333675300488683520 2020-12-01 15:32:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely! They are Marxists and their aim is to transform society.
1333673991559634950 2020-12-01 15:27:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very lovely!
1333671292722155522 2020-12-01 15:16:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That would be too boring!🤨
1333666802698743811 2020-12-01 14:58:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The ice man cometh !
1333665121118384130 2020-12-01 14:51:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The mask is slipping !
1333664443692150785 2020-12-01 14:49:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You should publish a recipe good and be the next domestic goddess!
1333663441203159042 2020-12-01 14:45:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You could not make it up !
1333663088751546368 2020-12-01 14:43:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When is this madness going to end ?
1333662858912161797 2020-12-01 14:42:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too ! It is going to get colder so wrap up warm !😀
1333662117375975424 2020-12-01 14:40:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Eventually every liar gets caught out ! She's had a good run...
1333661701347094528 2020-12-01 14:38:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris ! You are very lively this morning !🤣
1333660543320813569 2020-12-01 14:33:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon's shamelessness knows no bounds !
1333660344208793600 2020-12-01 14:32:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And not for the better !
1333659745853566977 2020-12-01 14:30:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wouldn't know sweetie !
1333659496481222656 2020-12-01 14:29:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> BLM 's objective is not to improve race relations but quite the opposite !
1333659233926189058 2020-12-01 14:28:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He hasn't got one !
1333659057597640706 2020-12-01 14:27:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said ! Starmer is the pits !
1333658179494883330 2020-12-01 14:24:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Impossible !
1333657332572696576 2020-12-01 14:21:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's fine ! You will become a voyeur ! 😀
1333657148174331904 2020-12-01 14:20:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's all he can do is sit on the fence ! Never a good position for a leader !
1333656614830747649 2020-12-01 14:18:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are not going to leave us again ! 😠
1333656351504027649 2020-12-01 14:17:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't have to try vey hard !
1333655852155342850 2020-12-01 14:15:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very  true ! Also true friends tease you mercilessly !😂
1333653590490181632 2020-12-01 14:06:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning sunshine ! What do you mean by saying you don't get twitter ? What's to get ? Have a good day !
1333494913204445190 2020-12-01 03:35:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Could be!
1333494540930609152 2020-12-01 03:34:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not where we live.
1333494415944536069 2020-12-01 03:33:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is it because if someone gets slightly inebriated they might find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing.
1333493885947899904 2020-12-01 03:31:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too !
1333444747378221058 2020-12-01 00:16:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙊🙊🙊🙊
1333443796349063169 2020-12-01 00:12:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It surely but Piers would not know how to spell humiliation. Much too big headed!
1333443436394016768 2020-12-01 00:11:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very gallant!😋
1333443117324914691 2020-12-01 00:09:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Possibly!😳
1333442591585673216 2020-12-01 00:07:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What do you mean?🙊🙊
1333442300572291073 2020-12-01 00:06:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am respectfully assuming you are the boss!
1333440745022296067 2020-12-01 00:00:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too darling!

1333440252158029825 2020-11-30 23:58:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏🙏
1333439848917708802 2020-11-30 23:56:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But maybe she is in charge. She is just very subtle!😋
1333439571946827776 2020-11-30 23:55:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True but she didn’t take him seriously and showed disrespect. Look how she and other European leaders equally made fun of Mrs May.
1333438821304840193 2020-11-30 23:52:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> See you are compatible. A good combination!
1333438652240826375 2020-11-30 23:52:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My mother was a cancerian and she was very a traditional homemaker and very sentimental. Scorpios are more forceful. They will speak their mind, are often tactless and they don’t like bullshitters and hypocrites. We are very loyal and devoted so it is not all bad!😋
1333437870040895497 2020-11-30 23:48:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The cheek of the woman! When Cameron approached her before the referendum and asked for some concessions for the U.K. she sent him packing. Anyway I thought she was mean to retire.
1333436662106492928 2020-11-30 23:44:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very welcome! I am a Scorpio so I know we are compatible with people born under the signs of Pisces and cancer.
1333435971917008896 2020-11-30 23:41:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pisces or Scorpio.
1333402352397774848 2020-11-30 21:27:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1333395353157201921 2020-11-30 21:00:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1333391981695873027 2020-11-30 20:46:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it cannot be forced in people.
1333348242973667331 2020-11-30 17:52:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Trouble brewing in paradise!
1333329176049426433 2020-11-30 16:37:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, definitely not!
1333327293876494336 2020-11-30 16:29:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It certainly doesn’t!😡
1333326721932779520 2020-11-30 16:27:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What’s wrong with calling someone “babe “, it’s a term of endearment. I call a lot of people “ darling!” so what?
1333324650030493696 2020-11-30 16:19:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes that is true! In France restaurants and bars won’t open until the end of January and you can only go out for exercises or essential shopping but must stay within your area.
1333324007228239872 2020-11-30 16:16:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope so!🙏
1333322620226375680 2020-11-30 16:10:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not up to the Sturgeon to decide when the next independence referendum is to take place. It’s only been 4 years that’s hardly a generation.
1333315610634297344 2020-11-30 15:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite!😋

1333297154694254592 2020-11-30 14:29:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It was okay, non eventful really.
1333294186565689344 2020-11-30 14:18:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Connor!😋
1333128655501930498 2020-11-30 03:20:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a bad plan!😀
1333126138864996352 2020-11-30 03:10:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rum.
1333078891771125761 2020-11-30 00:02:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have my sympathy!
1333069698494312449 2020-11-29 23:25:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Really?🤨🤨
1333039083141165059 2020-11-29 21:24:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No one !
1333037887647084544 2020-11-29 21:19:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> About sums them up !
1333037527071133701 2020-11-29 21:18:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pants on fire !
1333036324815839233 2020-11-29 21:13:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely right !
1333035580784070663 2020-11-29 21:10:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That one too !
1333034990716792833 2020-11-29 21:08:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gone with the wind !
1333034538801508354 2020-11-29 21:06:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think the public is not stupid and is obviously aware that a no deal is very much on the table !
1333034058297856007 2020-11-29 21:04:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course that would be way too challenging  and also maybe they would have to rethink who the real victims are.
1333014576842104833 2020-11-29 19:46:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are!😋
1332984605746601984 2020-11-29 17:47:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree Paul!
1332976363209437186 2020-11-29 17:15:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are gone !
1332973932002091008 2020-11-29 17:05:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right! The truth is that the Labour Party let Scotland down and they created a vacuum which was quickly taken up by the SNP.
1332968580871229444 2020-11-29 16:44:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes absolutely! Unfortunate some SNP followers are convinced that if they free themselves from the English all their troubles will be over! It’s an emotional not rational feeling. You can’t reason with this!
1332966711696486400 2020-11-29 16:36:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think that most English people want a break up of the Union but some SNP followers are so virulently anti -English and they are fed up with the Scottish blaming the English for everything. I don’t think the EU wants Scotland.
1332963961587830784 2020-11-29 16:25:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sincerely hope so Jane!
1332963777101373442 2020-11-29 16:25:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true! They would really have something to whinge about then!
1332963593160159232 2020-11-29 16:24:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who says we don’t?😀
1332954054247505922 2020-11-29 15:46:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes so do I!
1332947128642113536 2020-11-29 15:18:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You must be joking , the hated English won't be allowed it !
1332945727203512322 2020-11-29 15:13:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sometimes, a lot of the time actually !😂
1332945200935743489 2020-11-29 15:11:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course silly me !
1332943440468987905 2020-11-29 15:04:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is exactly what their objective is . Divide and divide !
1332942922061328384 2020-11-29 15:02:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling !
1332942832324268039 2020-11-29 15:01:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us see how the Met deals with the next BLM or Muslim outrage !
1332942380199256064 2020-11-29 15:00:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a situation !
1332941901654351875 2020-11-29 14:58:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If he is a penniless refugee who paid his bail money ?
1332941622242369539 2020-11-29 14:57:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This black opportunism is getting out of hands. Have we not got enough criminals that we cannot deport. Why doesn't David Olusuga put up a few yards.
1332940989342883841 2020-11-29 14:54:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When is the Sturgeon going to start wearing a head scarf !
1332940624488763394 2020-11-29 14:53:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's about time somebody stood up to this bloody nonsense .
1332940361040355329 2020-11-29 14:52:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The media or at least Channel 4 news completely ignored it .
1332940144022855680 2020-11-29 14:51:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At the moment I am reading "Wisdom of the Ancients" by Neil Oliver. Interesting point of view.
1332939381464829952 2020-11-29 14:48:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All that these protesters are causing is disruption and bad feeling .Nothing positive about any of this ! It's a war against ordinary people of all colours and beliefs.
1332937777898545159 2020-11-29 14:41:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So black criminals are special !
1332936849027981314 2020-11-29 14:38:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And George Osborne  said that Brexit would cause World War three !
1332804935818371075 2020-11-29 05:53:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merci ! 😍
1332804037490642945 2020-11-29 05:50:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Je suis gentille c’est vrai! Bonne nuit!
1332803102957768712 2020-11-29 05:46:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lovely tree!😋
1332801394424819713 2020-11-29 05:39:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My goodness you are a force of nature. I hope you will have a lie in tomorrow!😋
1332798644748251146 2020-11-29 05:28:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t know how you manage not to eat for so many hours!
1332785347957321730 2020-11-29 04:36:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1332771466279051264 2020-11-29 03:40:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Vive la France !
1332758614868680715 2020-11-29 02:49:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A rose for a rose!😋
1332758205852684294 2020-11-29 02:48:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I will take it!🙈
1332758093399281674 2020-11-29 02:47:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he does !
1332757995034456067 2020-11-29 02:47:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not quite a saint!😂
1332757535351246849 2020-11-29 02:45:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I mean it ! You are never sarcastic and always kind and show respect to all your followers. Twitter would be a happier place with more people like you .I will have you blushing soon!😋
1332755372155736066 2020-11-29 02:36:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are a lovely gentleman Chris! It would be lovely if all twitter users were as nice as you.
1332754327518277632 2020-11-29 02:32:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1332719649922936838 2020-11-29 00:14:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merci ma belle !
1332714745414213632 2020-11-28 23:55:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And don’t you forget it !😂
1332714617198563332 2020-11-28 23:55:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spoil yourself darling! I have just had two mince pies! I love them and eat them throughout December. Enjoy your evening!😍
1332711847418540033 2020-11-28 23:43:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tact is very important when dealing with the gentler sex!😂
1332711639838314504 2020-11-28 23:43:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would be very surprised if any of the parents who send their boys to Eton will be happy. They don’t send them there to listen to twaddle!
1332710856530997248 2020-11-28 23:40:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy your break!😋
1332709732419854336 2020-11-28 23:35:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never a truer say!😂
1332709243762434051 2020-11-28 23:33:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1332709042016432128 2020-11-28 23:32:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks it !
1332678964100395009 2020-11-28 21:33:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Such different treatments received by blacks and muslims.
1332676289996726272 2020-11-28 21:22:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So it is a hanging offence is it ?
1332651414334676997 2020-11-28 19:43:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lamb is hilarious! He is the ultimate piss taker!
1332637284127154178 2020-11-28 18:47:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The main attraction is the visceral pleasure some us humans take in mocking the afflicted. We like to make fun of others specially when they are making arses of themselves. Humiliation is the name of the game and I’ll feeling is always popular.
1332635922844835841 2020-11-28 18:42:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do watch “Come Dine with me” as it is at times hilarious.
1332635118574465024 2020-11-28 18:39:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is it a surprise? This is partly the BLM’s intention in order to give themselves more ammunition. If there is a problem let’s magnify. At the end the ones who suffer are black people.
1332633727122497537 2020-11-28 18:33:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1332598897475252224 2020-11-28 16:15:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At least you are consistent!😂
1332591124217815040 2020-11-28 15:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏🙏
1332589355467235329 2020-11-28 15:37:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Frightening but true to see how easily people can be manipulated .
1332587690836062209 2020-11-28 15:30:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris ! Enjoy your weekend!
1332583917526736896 2020-11-28 15:15:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell the Muslims to stop cutting people's heads off .
1332583570758627328 2020-11-28 15:14:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If only !🙄🙄
1332583006444412928 2020-11-28 15:12:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I guess we have to at least partly blame the Americans and look at the mess they are in !
1332582362685845505 2020-11-28 15:09:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He would ! Green is a disgrace!
1332581271978074114 2020-11-28 15:05:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too !😍
1332580257900224513 2020-11-28 15:01:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Bernie !
1332578755747966978 2020-11-28 14:55:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Sue !
1332575518634504193 2020-11-28 14:42:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sums it up !
1332575288799203329 2020-11-28 14:41:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He cannot sell out over Brexit and he knows it !
1332574354253762560 2020-11-28 14:37:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Where does it all stop ?
1332573952875573248 2020-11-28 14:36:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely absurd !
1332573252972122112 2020-11-28 14:33:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1332573125888892929 2020-11-28 14:32:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A vision of gorgeousness ! Very chic !
1332388073179639811 2020-11-28 02:17:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gorgeous creatures!😍
1332386449124102144 2020-11-28 02:10:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t please! It’s very refreshing.😍
1332385762604707840 2020-11-28 02:08:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you for your sweet message but I am not the one putting out these lovely meals. I just comment on them.😋
1332384927757856768 2020-11-28 02:04:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Meghan apparently craves privacy but still wants to tell the world about her miscarriage.
1332384116759801857 2020-11-28 02:01:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bon appetit !😋
1332383575652622338 2020-11-28 01:59:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And yet he still preaches!😡
1332381422607364103 2020-11-28 01:51:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Envy!
1332356488766115840 2020-11-28 00:11:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a bad deal Graham!😋
1332356357316616192 2020-11-28 00:11:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have noticed even educated people start their sentences with so and then there is the great infill word “like”., and talking in questions. Words “gutted, devastated, epic, awesome. You can’t emphasise anything anymore
1332355268580151296 2020-11-28 00:07:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How patriotic!
1332347101888573443 2020-11-27 23:34:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes absolutely I can !
1332346512148492289 2020-11-27 23:32:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True ! I am a November child, a scorpio.  Many happy returns of the day !
1332346033397968896 2020-11-27 23:30:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are Welcome !😍
1332345599216263168 2020-11-27 23:28:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too little ray of sunshine !
1332329487002906625 2020-11-27 22:24:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look forward to seeing your menu!😋
1332325818027155460 2020-11-27 22:10:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope you are going to have a break from cooking tonight! Get a nice takeaway 😋
1332325490397507585 2020-11-27 22:08:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😳😳😳😳
1332243565766975490 2020-11-27 16:43:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1332228166883155969 2020-11-27 15:42:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They probably will but we have many more months of trouble ahead.
1332227947093258242 2020-11-27 15:41:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU never intended to play fair! The last thing they want is for Brexit to become a success. Other countries would then follow our example.
1332218399095738370 2020-11-27 15:03:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> History repeats itself. Why would the Scots be so keen to be bossed about by the Germans?😳
1332217775981531137 2020-11-27 15:00:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We were told we were joining the common market by Heath. We were not told about the long term plan for a federal Europe, quite a different proposition.
1332213331998945281 2020-11-27 14:43:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I think a lot of people think like you!
1332212534787633152 2020-11-27 14:39:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Try and enjoy some of your day Connor. You sound dejected. It’s Friday!😋😋
1332211516829995010 2020-11-27 14:35:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s nice!😡
1332211188952932354 2020-11-27 14:34:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Chris!
1332211090239991808 2020-11-27 14:34:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He has learnt from Corbyn to sit on the fence and look what happened to him!
1332209776680431617 2020-11-27 14:28:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1332209477395869696 2020-11-27 14:27:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical more worried about foreign lives than our own!

1331994079081738241 2020-11-27 00:11:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes occasionally and I just ignore them.😋
1331993657382105088 2020-11-27 00:10:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Priscilla but of course this is an American ad!
1331991979639574539 2020-11-27 00:03:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have a M&amp;S store a mile from us andI shop there once a week. Even Waitrose cannot compete with M&amp;S when it comes to these dishes.Their fish pie is not bad either. I will stop now 😂
1331990796736851970 2020-11-26 23:58:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is ! I love that range too. Their best beef pie is also excellent!😋
1331990166895022080 2020-11-26 23:56:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and it is one of the best dishes in that range. Their cottage pie in red wine sauce is also very good and their chicken Kiev.😋
1331989363673198599 2020-11-26 23:53:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I buy M &amp; S ‘s Moussaka and it is very good. I can make it myself but it takes time ...
1331988906372423683 2020-11-26 23:51:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! No one listens to them!
1331950291755950087 2020-11-26 21:17:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> and sinking fast ! The viewing figures are going through the floor !
1331950090689392641 2020-11-26 21:17:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course they do !
1331949820022562818 2020-11-26 21:15:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Does Barry realise that if we delay Brexit the EU would be glad because we would then have make enormous contributions to the Covid fund.
1331948875259711495 2020-11-26 21:12:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They manipulate it as they go along and put their own slant on events .
1331948444492165121 2020-11-26 21:10:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! Is that what they really want ?
1331948213771886593 2020-11-26 21:09:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Strangely enough the BBC made a big deal of it as if she was someone of some importance ! Good old BBC never fail !
1331947746534846465 2020-11-26 21:07:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Richard, what on earth did you say to her ?
1331946582279860226 2020-11-26 21:03:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1331945911853912064 2020-11-26 21:00:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1331945658970943488 2020-11-26 20:59:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because some were flagranty disregarding the rules.
1331944938737688579 2020-11-26 20:56:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never heard of her! She will greatly missed if we ever found out who she was ! A very noble gesture I am sure !😂
1331944737729875970 2020-11-26 20:55:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!

1331943845366534144 2020-11-26 20:52:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Greasy Barry with his child molester smile !
1331943175502635018 2020-11-26 20:49:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Build your own bloody wall Blackford !
1331942440320839682 2020-11-26 20:46:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1331866350529155072 2020-11-26 15:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling!😍
1331864427646382080 2020-11-26 15:36:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1331864378191327232 2020-11-26 15:36:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a shocker!😂😂
1331863609559969793 2020-11-26 15:33:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are so predictable!
1331862208087789569 2020-11-26 15:27:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a thing Patsy!😡
1331860728765145088 2020-11-26 15:21:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The hypocrisy of it all!
1331860331510046720 2020-11-26 15:20:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beyond dreadful 😡😡
1331857177091432451 2020-11-26 15:07:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s good 😋
1331856132734902272 2020-11-26 15:03:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That sums it up !
1331855594991529985 2020-11-26 15:01:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious !
1331855144988897283 2020-11-26 14:59:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't know about happiness Chris but hopefully some joy !
1331854949639196672 2020-11-26 14:58:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No I would not ! No more questions about Nazi stuff if you don't mind. I had a Jewish grandmother!
1331854472507744256 2020-11-26 14:57:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How the great have fallen !
1331853625623257089 2020-11-26 14:53:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They took their time though !
1331852845944102912 2020-11-26 14:50:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No I wouldn't !
1331852666989932545 2020-11-26 14:49:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have seen some of those young ladies., I am not one of them.
1331852215515029505 2020-11-26 14:48:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have a suggestion : The know it all bastards party.
1331851791915503616 2020-11-26 14:46:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious !
1331851620146176001 2020-11-26 14:45:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a good day Chris !
1331851203991523328 2020-11-26 14:44:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most people don't and when they do it is often because they want something from you. If you are female they sometimes want to flirt which can be tedious. I don't suppose you have that problem. This is not a dating site.
1331850770849947648 2020-11-26 14:42:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks sweetie !
1331850601014112258 2020-11-26 14:41:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is all about quality not quantity !😂
1331850450279297024 2020-11-26 14:41:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope not ! Have a good day !
1331850309681999873 2020-11-26 14:40:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am aware of that ! I think it is difficult when people first get on twitter to get followers. I can be disheartening .
1331849763017400320 2020-11-26 14:38:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning stranger !
1331849666758111234 2020-11-26 14:37:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you have a lot of followers it must be difficult to keep track.
1331848906079162370 2020-11-26 14:34:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !😍
1331848561550647298 2020-11-26 14:33:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true and bad manners! It assumes that you are more important than the other person.
1331847809109274624 2020-11-26 14:30:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Joe ! Have a good day !
1331846283334623234 2020-11-26 14:24:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Corbyn , Mc Donald, Emily Thornberry, Lammy and company would be so much better? So what you are really saying that all us working class are not intelligent whilst you are a superior know it all .
1331845710959038464 2020-11-26 14:22:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is she fearing reduction in foreign aid for herself ?
1331679741762560002 2020-11-26 03:22:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope so !
1331677951130284032 2020-11-26 03:15:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1331664525272166401 2020-11-26 02:22:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏
1331663977374494720 2020-11-26 02:20:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So blatantly true!😡😡
1331663136026468354 2020-11-26 02:16:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yummy!😋
1331661726513819650 2020-11-26 02:11:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not always. It sometimes depends whether the recipient can handle it.
1331635244819230722 2020-11-26 00:25:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shame!😂
1331608987675070472 2020-11-25 22:41:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough! It’s your choice.
1331602109511380992 2020-11-25 22:14:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good to know!😋
1331587644321624067 2020-11-25 21:16:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nor mine !
1331587548297228289 2020-11-25 21:16:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These are the future elite ! Christ helps us !
1331586989875990528 2020-11-25 21:14:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sorry David it is as clear as day the politician fit to lead this country is Boris. I can't actually believe you are that keen on your leader who looks unlikely to last much longer. How many has he been stabbed in the back?
1331585883842162690 2020-11-25 21:09:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are having a laugh !
1331585709766037505 2020-11-25 21:09:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At least !
1331585571140067328 2020-11-25 21:08:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What are you talking about. I presume you are once more criticising the Government 's decisions but then what else do you do ?
1331585208274083840 2020-11-25 21:07:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't for one !
1331584767020634113 2020-11-25 21:05:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Overweight racists seem to go for convertibles .  Look at Herman Goering !
1331584465483730945 2020-11-25 21:04:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anyone who buys a convertible of any sort in Scotland is mental but then we always knew he was.
1331583940310822913 2020-11-25 21:02:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1331583733875544064 2020-11-25 21:01:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because he has Irish ancestry and like most Americans believe pseudo IRA propaganda. he is living in the world of the film " The Quiet Man'., a distorted Walt Disney view of Ireland .
1331581883608608769 2020-11-25 20:53:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth is not popular nowadays !
1331581428778328065 2020-11-25 20:52:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wonder why ?
1331580772201979905 2020-11-25 20:49:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What else has it got ? Perhaps it is a bonny bouncing hermaphrodite .
1331580050999795715 2020-11-25 20:46:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously you don't realise his real name was George Ruben Floydstein ! I thought everyone knew that !😂
1331570692714803200 2020-11-25 20:09:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great idea!
1331565893676044289 2020-11-25 19:50:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us leave it at that!
1331564093799591939 2020-11-25 19:43:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please are you comparing this lady to psychopaths. Come on, this is getting quite ridiculous.
1331562127774142464 2020-11-25 19:35:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately she probably will have to knight him! I bet she won’t enjoy it !
1331561091839778816 2020-11-25 19:31:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a very gallant remark !
1331507288620879872 2020-11-25 15:57:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can’t disagree with what you have said.Have a lovely day! It was nice having a civilised discussion with you!😋
1331504912539279361 2020-11-25 15:48:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! The problem here is that a great number of Londoners have lost trust in the Met. They have been very inconsistent in their response to various demos.
1331503551143698432 2020-11-25 15:42:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, happy days! Mind you we still moan about the weather !
1331502926636920833 2020-11-25 15:40:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with you in the whole but in that particular instance the police officers did not consult Dick but took it upon themselves to arrest this lady.
1331501086700691464 2020-11-25 15:32:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem is that we have seen the Met allowing a BLM paramilitary march in Brixton this summer and not one single arrest!😡
1331499512695762945 2020-11-25 15:26:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! The party needs a better caliber if MPs.
1331497695773659136 2020-11-25 15:19:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please ! Basta !🙈🙈
1331496879054589952 2020-11-25 15:16:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I had better shut my big gob Mr maffioso !😳😳😳
1331496422324260864 2020-11-25 15:14:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1331495969901449216 2020-11-25 15:12:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quit while you are ahead darling!
1331495820013744128 2020-11-25 15:11:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s absolutely unbelievable! What is happening to this great country? People don’t seem to appreciate what they have.
1331495376751353856 2020-11-25 15:10:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The boy doth protest too much!😋
1331495246790799362 2020-11-25 15:09:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree Paul. The mail used to be supportive of the Government until they changed editor.
1331494549978574848 2020-11-25 15:06:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It doesn’t count as an achievement as this comes so naturally to you!😋
1331493324251918336 2020-11-25 15:02:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are already on that list !
1331493191321849856 2020-11-25 15:01:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This woman is a cure for insomnia ! What a dismal display !
1331490454140055557 2020-11-25 14:50:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The message to the world is : "Send your refuse here"!
1331489705851023361 2020-11-25 14:47:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Societal is not even a proper word !
1331489319404658688 2020-11-25 14:46:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us see these brave yellow jackets start hauling the BLM and the climate freaks off the streets!
1331488232618545153 2020-11-25 14:41:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How long before television is a 100% black and then we will the complete laughing stock of the whole world.
1331487380340174851 2020-11-25 14:38:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we are all pulling our hair out at the moment. Things will have to change next year in a big way !
1331487169580593152 2020-11-25 14:37:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you had turned into a hermaphrodite you would be laughing !
1331486739664412673 2020-11-25 14:35:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet again fine display of bravery from the Met.
1331486471296061442 2020-11-25 14:34:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't forget the mutton pies !
1331486214294269953 2020-11-25 14:33:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is the old EU method of "keep voting until you make the right decision" !
1331485760617410562 2020-11-25 14:31:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes indeed ! Morning Paul !😀
1331485505431760896 2020-11-25 14:30:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Biden like most. Americans does not understand the Irish situation. Just because he has Irish ancestry it does not make him an expert.
1331484317936218112 2020-11-25 14:26:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's a bonus !
1331484225212735489 2020-11-25 14:25:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, none at all !
1331483878918418434 2020-11-25 14:24:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not just the silly country anymore but the stupidly ridiculous country !
1331483550521188352 2020-11-25 14:23:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are not the only one ! It's all very unsettling !
1331483178297683974 2020-11-25 14:21:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Know I is very disheartening ! Keep the faith !
1331482979470864384 2020-11-25 14:20:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😉😂😂
1331482556253007872 2020-11-25 14:19:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris ! It is now and dry down here !😉
1331482374341865473 2020-11-25 14:18:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Connor ! Don't spend it all on women and wine !😂
1331481929825259520 2020-11-25 14:16:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question ! They are trying to punish us for voting for the Conservative party and for Brexit.
1331349701376040961 2020-11-25 05:31:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Really!🙈🙈🙈
1331311313189019649 2020-11-25 02:58:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1331306348613672961 2020-11-25 02:39:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You cad!🙈🙈
1331306125715795969 2020-11-25 02:38:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> People are probably the worse!
1331298230760562690 2020-11-25 02:06:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not!
1331291326273507335 2020-11-25 01:39:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You really are a creative cook! No chilli con carne or lasagna for you! You should go on “Come dine with me”!
1331289804630335490 2020-11-25 01:33:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bon appetit  😋
1331280878971084800 2020-11-25 00:57:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cruel!
1331254459167596545 2020-11-24 23:12:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Life is too short!😋
1331231585883090947 2020-11-24 21:41:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No of course, we are only the majority in this country, why should our views matter? We are all for diversity but really ....
1331231270295187458 2020-11-24 21:40:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite !
1331231084173021184 2020-11-24 21:39:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think it probably already is !
1331230630697459714 2020-11-24 21:38:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What's wrong with saying that ?
1331230182800302081 2020-11-24 21:36:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beautiful pic !
1331230023433523201 2020-11-24 21:35:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Pauline !
1331229279225581568 2020-11-24 21:32:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I like that ! The man can't even spell class.
1331227761273417728 2020-11-24 21:26:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Impressive !
1331227660282982403 2020-11-24 21:26:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious !
1331227298398396416 2020-11-24 21:24:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right Ju ! To call out evil is not racist !
1331227188100800514 2020-11-24 21:24:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Adorable !
1331226627456573440 2020-11-24 21:22:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you were more extreme than some of the corbynistas you will end up in a mental asylum !
1331225885320630275 2020-11-24 21:19:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sound idea!
1331225704197988354 2020-11-24 21:18:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My husband used to have a 1946 type 400 from Bristol Cars in Kensington High street ! I am not a pessimist just a realist!
1331225120736743424 2020-11-24 21:16:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but I don't think we will get it somehow !
1331224233645584386 2020-11-24 21:12:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can hope in vain but leopards don't change their spots Richard !
1331223877486342147 2020-11-24 21:11:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you big momma !😍
1331223691292762112 2020-11-24 21:10:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When you could take your car on the plane with you in 1954.  https://t.co/c7vctTWxTP
1331210978835501056 2020-11-24 20:20:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1331210737285525505 2020-11-24 20:19:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I totally agree Richard! We must stay positive! We are talking about survival and damage limitation here!
1331209762759979008 2020-11-24 20:15:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That would be ideal but it is not the reality!
1331185793113747463 2020-11-24 18:39:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1331158258573324288 2020-11-24 16:50:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1331134210535469056 2020-11-24 15:15:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So glad to hear that you have made a full recovery! It must be lovely to be home after your ordeal.😍
1331132772912672768 2020-11-24 15:09:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes quite a vile individual!
1331132436495949824 2020-11-24 15:07:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wouldn’t have thought so!😂😂
1331131801021149184 2020-11-24 15:05:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😍😍
1331131363811078145 2020-11-24 15:03:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a good day Bernie!😋
1331130518834999296 2020-11-24 15:00:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The war is on ! Starmer 's days are numbered ! He will be consigned to the bin liner of history !
1331129992219123712 2020-11-24 14:58:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Next May hopefully !
1331129691269423104 2020-11-24 14:57:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a pretty picture this makes ! What I would say to Lammy I hope you have a long spoon !
1331129225483612162 2020-11-24 14:55:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And then what ?
1331128960315510784 2020-11-24 14:54:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who in their right mind would want to visit Scotland at the moment?
1331128613245214721 2020-11-24 14:52:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is the biggest curse of modern times !
1331128372437671944 2020-11-24 14:51:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That man is a disgrace, never offer never positive suggestions and just criticises. I think he should look inwards and try to sort out the vile mess his party is in !
1331127859604238336 2020-11-24 14:49:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When you have the enemy within it automatically weakens you !
1331127501897273350 2020-11-24 14:48:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but their leader is a bit of a creep . The People Republic of North Islington has its own standards !
1331126803558240258 2020-11-24 14:45:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is right !
1331126539279327233 2020-11-24 14:44:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1331124033174310912 2020-11-24 14:34:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are awarding a diamond earring poser ! What standards we have !
1331123785702010880 2020-11-24 14:33:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously another tax avoiding merchant !
1331123358684082176 2020-11-24 14:31:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Miliband has caused enough trouble in engineering the destruction of the Labour Party. He should stay silent!
1331122828821864448 2020-11-24 14:29:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Deluded or what ! More tripe from the plastic philosopher !
1331122376160014340 2020-11-24 14:28:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All is well in the wonderful EU !
1331122004041330688 2020-11-24 14:26:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am not sure many are as they have been told to f.. off at the border !
1331121797811605505 2020-11-24 14:25:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Keir Starmer lives in Hampstead and not a council estate in South London. They are all the same and out of touch.
1331121315605049344 2020-11-24 14:23:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course ! It is pretending we have some power and that they care about us !
1331120819930591232 2020-11-24 14:21:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rob Roy Mclardass has more mouth than a man !
1331120524035059712 2020-11-24 14:20:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Do your best my darling ! 😍
1331120401582346240 2020-11-24 14:20:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This teacher should be reported . What a disgusting lying bastard ! Not fit to teach youngsters.
1331119944185114626 2020-11-24 14:18:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you kind sir ! You too ! Keep smiling !😀
1331119482895527938 2020-11-24 14:16:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not here !😉
1331118952769052673 2020-11-24 14:14:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris ! Mild here today !
1331118839111835648 2020-11-24 14:13:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Abusive, aggressive and totally unprofessional !
1330997063052648449 2020-11-24 06:10:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have noticed!😋
1330996966088695808 2020-11-24 06:09:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Oh no!🙁🙁
1330972150954659841 2020-11-24 04:31:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!😋
1330969509159723008 2020-11-24 04:20:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can’t really beat a G &amp; T ! 😋
1330969295891935233 2020-11-24 04:19:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are right! Shameful all the same
1330963726854475785 2020-11-24 03:57:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have a very sweet tooth so I love pinas coladas and Southern Comfort with orange juice. Love a G &amp; T too.😋
1330962161414369283 2020-11-24 03:51:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Margaritas are very refreshing too!
1330961983676493824 2020-11-24 03:50:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Too milky for my taste! I like a strong tea!😋
1330961154047430659 2020-11-24 03:47:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Your food always looks not only very appetising but healthy as well! 👏
1330960470304567296 2020-11-24 03:44:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nosy you mean 😋
1330959864957460483 2020-11-24 03:42:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And why is the media not hounding her like they did Dominic Cummings?
1330959050679443464 2020-11-24 03:39:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1330955692446986241 2020-11-24 03:25:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He sure does!😋
1330857089120559104 2020-11-23 20:53:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anyone who takes any notice of a climate activist deserves everything they get !
1330856125923778560 2020-11-23 20:50:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is quite ludicrous ! These researchers have got too much time on their hands!
1330854420758867968 2020-11-23 20:43:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No they can't !They are just dismal ! They find good news unacceptable as that reflects something good on the Government and they don't like this !
1330842372243132418 2020-11-23 19:55:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Actually the correct term is encule ! The word cul is the arse so I will let you work it out!
1330835040566177792 2020-11-23 19:26:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not really. It is just that they are not brought up to understand the Monarchy. The truth is both women wanted the glory without the duty and that will never work
1330834405087203328 2020-11-23 19:23:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Him but who knows? Maybe he will kneel on two knees, one for the BLM and one for the Queen, the little ponce!
1330782560906047488 2020-11-23 15:57:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Francis has been living in Japan for more than 30 years and is married to a very charming Japanese lady.
1330780317385449472 2020-11-23 15:48:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough! My brother lives in Tokyo and he said that he could travel out of the country but would not be allowed back in. They have much stricter controls in place than here.
1330779464830234625 2020-11-23 15:45:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am not sure about Starmer been the only virus!🤨🤨
1330779095395921921 2020-11-23 15:43:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All the best Andy!
1330777150077751298 2020-11-23 15:36:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’ll true, particularly among young Japanese but it might well have had an impact. No one can really say.
1330776067087458305 2020-11-23 15:31:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it doesn’t!
1330775360045281281 2020-11-23 15:29:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No sign of it! Sturgeon ‘s bestie is clinging on !
1330773560835641345 2020-11-23 15:21:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love actually!
1330771059323383808 2020-11-23 15:11:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏🙏🙏
1330770735565053953 2020-11-23 15:10:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Laughter is always guaranteed with you!
1330770608028835841 2020-11-23 15:10:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Glad you are sticking around. I may need you one day for moral support. You always make me laugh. 😍
1330769798037434369 2020-11-23 15:06:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is bad !
1330769627702505472 2020-11-23 15:06:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Joe ! Lovely pic !
1330769256653451266 2020-11-23 15:04:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is true ! It is sometimes difficult to find the right balance. Another problem is when you have one or two followers who talk nonsense and you can't argue with them as they appear to be on another planet.
1330768408116387842 2020-11-23 15:01:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How would you select the right moment Connor ! You would have to time it right you proud man ! Quit whilst you are ahead ! Just watch the profanities of a racist nature.
1330768108559228928 2020-11-23 15:00:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not !
1330767708988846082 2020-11-23 14:58:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet you do ! We don't want you banned that would be dreadful ! 🙄
1330766651491557376 2020-11-23 14:54:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You do have a way with words darling !
1330766345940721665 2020-11-23 14:53:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely !
1330766194459234306 2020-11-23 14:52:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question but he will ! Makes a joke of the whole thing!
1330765975805960200 2020-11-23 14:51:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet he thought he had got away with it !
1330765613627809793 2020-11-23 14:50:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't we all !
1330765408027238405 2020-11-23 14:49:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a wonderful day chilly day !
1330765233871314949 2020-11-23 14:48:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning handsome ! I bet it is chilly up north !
1330764834892369922 2020-11-23 14:47:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The police officers will end up looking like clowns.
1330764449830080512 2020-11-23 14:45:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's because he is an arrogant unpleasant man !
1330762040449830913 2020-11-23 14:36:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Public opinion is hardening against the BBC considerably. People like Peston don't seem to get it !
1330761839219798016 2020-11-23 14:35:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no hope whatsoever Peston, the BBC is worse than ever! Cummings is a minor side issue !
1330628676443136004 2020-11-23 05:46:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree!
1330607936972926985 2020-11-23 04:23:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A great attempt!
1330607406347333632 2020-11-23 04:21:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes now I remember! Why I thought it was polio I’ll never know 😳😳😳
1330602100070428674 2020-11-23 04:00:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough darling!😋
1330601325630017537 2020-11-23 03:57:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> God knows!🤨
1330600977263710213 2020-11-23 03:56:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have seen worse ones!
1330600799462977541 2020-11-23 03:55:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s a harsh verdict! These are not normal times. As long as Boris delivers Brexit I think he will certainly not remembered as one of the worst Prime Minister.
1330573907913568264 2020-11-23 02:08:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1330572280146108422 2020-11-23 02:02:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Was it polio?
1330569097357168646 2020-11-23 01:49:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No great actor either! He plays himself!
1330568794318786560 2020-11-23 01:48:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love it !
1330568627838455808 2020-11-23 01:47:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not just any woman though 😋
1330565772620537860 2020-11-23 01:36:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And nonsense!
1330565371569508352 2020-11-23 01:34:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And the Arabs were also involved in the slave trade.
1330563844150800387 2020-11-23 01:28:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1330562403432599554 2020-11-23 01:22:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not just not a good look but impossible to impose.
1330560435758780418 2020-11-23 01:15:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Kelly’s Heroes, Zulu, Lawrence of Arabia.
1330552568712458241 2020-11-23 00:43:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wise words!
1330552405616963584 2020-11-23 00:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! but he never will.
1330551336010706945 2020-11-23 00:38:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Too much money can make you lose touch with every day people. It can isolate you and make you wary of people . Do they like you for yourself or for what you can do for them.
1330550178269585408 2020-11-23 00:34:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He always looks so smug and self satisfied with his diamond earring! He is one of nature’s prick who thinks he’s God’s gift to humanity.😋
1330549742477205504 2020-11-23 00:32:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1330549556883431432 2020-11-23 00:31:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said and very well illustrated!

1330548858955427845 2020-11-23 00:29:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋

1330548473784098816 2020-11-23 00:27:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That head gear really suits him the little prick!🙈🙈
1330547623531601922 2020-11-23 00:24:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very long!😋

1330545520281083906 2020-11-23 00:15:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He will accept it! He is too vain not to!
1330545185252642821 2020-11-23 00:14:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s true Debbie! What kind of a society have we become?
1330544263994765314 2020-11-23 00:10:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A thousand time a more worthy recipient. She showed such courage and moral fortitude. He is a very talented spoilt and arrogant man!
1330538849680953349 2020-11-22 23:49:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well! He’s a plastic negro!
1330500641693839361 2020-11-22 21:17:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The birds were really noisy today ! It felt like a spring morning!
1330499648100966404 2020-11-22 21:13:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Debbie us right ! you should not give up on the idea of a life commitment to another person.

1330498098301456405 2020-11-22 21:07:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is the matter with Geldof ?
1330497937403736067 2020-11-22 21:06:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely afternoon !😍
1330482301948530689 2020-11-22 20:04:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am actually back in 1967 and very happy there!
1330481391239368704 2020-11-22 20:00:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Knighthood has been seriously devalued! He is a brilliant racing driver but as a human being he is totally lacking in every aspect.
1330444807626498048 2020-11-22 17:35:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Same here!😋
1330444677326249985 2020-11-22 17:35:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A little odd and more than that out of order!
1330411711258632198 2020-11-22 15:24:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't we all !
1330411596590542849 2020-11-22 15:23:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very fair accusation !
1330411305543606272 2020-11-22 15:22:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too Paul !😀
1330411173301379072 2020-11-22 15:21:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The curfew was proved to be a stupid idea. It never made sense.
1330410894451503105 2020-11-22 15:20:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This mayor has to be stopped ! He is destroying our capital.
1330410601298989059 2020-11-22 15:19:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nice bunch !
1330409879849283584 2020-11-22 15:16:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> nWhat is this obsession with slavery in all our institutions? How long is this cultural revolution going to carry on? It seems that the current generation of institutions ' leaders were educated by the same Marxist lectures. Chairman Mao would be proud however they will not
1330408755217969153 2020-11-22 15:12:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely !!!
1330408375142768642 2020-11-22 15:10:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here too in the South London !
1330408264920657921 2020-11-22 15:10:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't say that Joe ! Let us keep optimistic !
1330408135065038851 2020-11-22 15:09:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That didn't take long and this was the Prime Minister in waiting! Civil war on the way .
1330407865580982273 2020-11-22 15:08:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Joe please, surely it won't take that long ! Made me smile !
1330407650081857536 2020-11-22 15:07:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And no more of our money appropriated by brutal dictators.
1330406405753495553 2020-11-22 15:02:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite !
1330406021832040449 2020-11-22 15:01:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not all is well in the wonderful EU ! Poland is also expressing anger against Brussels.
1330405161668407297 2020-11-22 14:58:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very impressive ! I am intending to join at once, not ! What a bunch of spanners mindlessly repetitive !
1330404175461707776 2020-11-22 14:54:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is one of the worse archbishops ever and there have been some bad ones!
1330403750519959553 2020-11-22 14:52:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That says it all but what has the media actually achieved apart from most of us despising the lot of them !
1330403485200871426 2020-11-22 14:51:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you Alan. I like you !😂
1330403281835876352 2020-11-22 14:50:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Happy Sunday to you too ! At least it is a little milder at. the moment!
1330402220765040645 2020-11-22 14:46:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes all too true ! The nation of muzzled sheep !
1330401847568371714 2020-11-22 14:44:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And let us not forget he is totally anti - British !
1330401398324928512 2020-11-22 14:43:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In other words they are totally against this country, so what do they expect? The working class in this country has never liked unpatriotic people. They will end up in the sewers of history and let's hope they take the BBC with them.
1330400881213399040 2020-11-22 14:41:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not anymore ! The party has lost its purpose.
1330400612899491841 2020-11-22 14:39:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a catalogue of self obsessed idiots !
1330373544446976000 2020-11-22 12:52:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1330237312316346368 2020-11-22 03:51:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Badly I hope. One thing for sure her name is shit!
1330236548617482249 2020-11-22 03:48:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That would be a good start
1330224320275247104 2020-11-22 02:59:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It might be remade by the Americans with Zulus winning! The Americans made a complete hash of the “American Job” !
1330207199357005825 2020-11-22 01:51:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😂
1330204752328658945 2020-11-22 01:41:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Possibly 🤨 I am thinking more on the line of olive oil!
1330204196700872708 2020-11-22 01:39:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It will give your hair a lovely sheen although it might smell a little funny 😋
1330146089408851976 2020-11-21 21:48:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here here !
1330112983532531712 2020-11-21 19:37:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You will never hear the BBC say anything positive about Boris !
1330112629969477633 2020-11-21 19:35:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So what are the Conservatives supposed to do about the SNP ! It is the Scots themselves to have to engage with the SNP.
1330112139265191943 2020-11-21 19:33:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How can every time there is an election in Scotland the SNP get a significant higher number of votes ? Please explain and justify !
1330110735133929472 2020-11-21 19:28:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very toxic  and very smug !and the Lord high ponce never mentions his white mother !
1330110203589779459 2020-11-21 19:25:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The word phobic is. now used by the left to describe someone who has a different point of view from themselves to try and make him/her feel bad about him/herself !
1330109716308045825 2020-11-21 19:24:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know Ewa !
1330109225729740800 2020-11-21 19:22:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right Ewa. We are going to have a lost generation!
1330109110801608705 2020-11-21 19:21:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The buck stops with Sturgeon and she knows it ! Even Piers Morgan was trumpeting a superb performance bur of course that was a way of having a go at Boris !
1330107696851390468 2020-11-21 19:16:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant analogy !
1330107532547907584 2020-11-21 19:15:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You had better if you want a hot dinner !😀
1330107405884153861 2020-11-21 19:14:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said ! I think they should both keep their heads down! They should both be ashamed of themselves, a war criminal and a cowardly rat !

1330093229333766145 2020-11-21 18:18:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sad and shameful!
1330072337941729281 2020-11-21 16:55:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes not until the first of December! Not long to go now!😋
1330052736969216001 2020-11-21 15:37:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they still can't get over the result of the referendum !
1330052339030437895 2020-11-21 15:36:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True ! We are the silent majority !
1330051872653193218 2020-11-21 15:34:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Since when did the Guardian turn into the Nazi magazine "Signal" ?
1330050456803045377 2020-11-21 15:28:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the majority's custom ?
1330049978857877504 2020-11-21 15:26:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am not surprised !
1330049458822930432 2020-11-21 15:24:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pas bien monsieur le president !
1330047395971932161 2020-11-21 15:16:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Outrageous !
1330046311903727624 2020-11-21 15:12:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In a nut shell !
1330045791189217280 2020-11-21 15:10:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have never watched it ! I can' t stand Ant &amp; Dec. It seems rather reminiscent of these horrible Japanese survival programs.
1330044963493736448 2020-11-21 15:06:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Patel is the current hate figure for the BBC and Channel 4 . The amount of leading questions on the Channel 4 seven o'clock news were relentless.
1330044114302332932 2020-11-21 15:03:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So the figures are been built up to just try and justify the present lockdown measures.
1330043673099251713 2020-11-21 15:01:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope he doesn't see this tweet !😂
1330042847819681799 2020-11-21 14:58:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You do now !😂😂😂
1330042418222264324 2020-11-21 14:56:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Islamophobia is fear of having your head chopped off in the street .
1330042105528520704 2020-11-21 14:55:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you imagine the international uproar if the Conservatives ever tried to meddle with the SNP and of course we can't ignore the fact that may Scots still support them. The North London Labour Party ignored Scotland to their cost and the vacuum was rapidly filled.
1330041302008942592 2020-11-21 14:52:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thankfully this sort of pandemic is not a regular occurrence. In Tudor times there was a plague every summer yet with no medical facilities and no hygiene and yet we are still here 100 years later.
1330040815339659266 2020-11-21 14:50:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Labour Party doesn't apply the same rules to itself!
1330040299893231618 2020-11-21 14:48:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You could not make it up ! Would I want my child to be taught by this individual ? No.
1330039910192058371 2020-11-21 14:46:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nobody asks the SNP searching questions at their briefing daily sessions. I agree with you that we need answers to the questions you have raised.
1330039022916431874 2020-11-21 14:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for you George ! Hope your decorating goes well !🙂
1329856082206973963 2020-11-21 02:36:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a great husband but an extraordinary writer.
1329850390620286976 2020-11-21 02:13:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hardly!😂😂
1329847717670105090 2020-11-21 02:02:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s an understatement!😋
1329823567509417988 2020-11-21 00:27:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s not much of a claim!

1329771318695366657 2020-11-20 20:59:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't forget how the Civil Servants were constantly meddling with Brexit !

1329768663247937540 2020-11-20 20:48:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Its nonsense! We are financing shit stirring racists !

1329766932225077248 2020-11-20 20:41:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! Drain the swamp !
1329766744051814405 2020-11-20 20:41:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think she was just sorting out civil servants with their own political ideas !
1329764701811707904 2020-11-20 20:33:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shocking story !
1329757029548888064 2020-11-20 20:02:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! Mind you the Guardian is losing a lot of readers.

1329675622336049153 2020-11-20 14:39:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When at least one man had style !  https://t.co/Sov4eqtrta

1329672825498718208 2020-11-20 14:28:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You don't sound too happy ! That is what happens when you watch the news !😀
1329672528474861568 2020-11-20 14:26:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It was closed during the first lockdown but not this time because the Pilates is run by physiotherapists so it is considered a medical centre like chiropodists and the like.
1329672167563333635 2020-11-20 14:25:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very deep !😀

1329463263571140608 2020-11-20 00:35:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1329430943006924800 2020-11-19 22:26:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The true voice of the corbynista! Not pretty is it ?
1329430484590456833 2020-11-19 22:25:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure she is on the list ! She is devoted to Jeremy !
1329429452548403201 2020-11-19 22:20:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love it !
1329429174331826177 2020-11-19 22:19:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope the dream turns to nightmare !
1329428929917153280 2020-11-19 22:18:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It seems so ! Hopefully things can change !
1329428292055801859 2020-11-19 22:16:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes the mirror of the soul !
1329427554734837761 2020-11-19 22:13:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We hope not !
1329427281023016962 2020-11-19 22:12:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe if Corbyn has shown some humility and repentance maybe he could have got back his whip.
1329423718498570242 2020-11-19 21:58:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No we don't agree ! Corbyn has never apologised for his contribution to antisemitism in his party.
1329422267357474817 2020-11-19 21:52:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our European friends are insanely vindictive arseholes !
1329421580963864577 2020-11-19 21:49:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The last time I saw a fish person was on Stingray ! It was not handsome !😂

1329327589379497985 2020-11-19 15:36:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a good day Chris 😋
1329323880587079680 2020-11-19 15:21:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I love Booths! Fantastic place with a lot of local products and the staff are so helpful. Best supermarket in the country!
1329323553024569345 2020-11-19 15:20:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should hope so !😋
1329323040090550272 2020-11-19 15:18:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I miss the North West! My mother died five years ago so we don’t go back to Knutsford anymore. I will always love the North West and it’s people.
1329321779379187718 2020-11-19 15:13:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I see exactly what you mean Connor ! My parents used to live in Knutsford and I went to school in Altrincham, so I know the North West well. I know Cheshire is a little different from some parts of the NW.When we first moved to the NW we lived in Great Sankey outside Warrington
1329321052732796929 2020-11-19 15:10:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question ! Why is the rest of the world's homeless catered for and ours are not ?
1329320743964979201 2020-11-19 15:08:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Connor, no wonder the North West has had so many cases of Covid. It is sad state of affairs!
1329319993755000833 2020-11-19 15:05:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So we are supposed to be nailed to the floor whilst the rest of the world goes head !
1329319499238158336 2020-11-19 15:04:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Where we live in South East London every body wears the mask including all the school children . Only the vaccine will stop this cycle of lockdowns !
1329319097507700736 2020-11-19 15:02:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's true !
1329318177755566080 2020-11-19 14:58:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neil Basu is a bloody idiot take my word for it !
1329317708698169344 2020-11-19 14:56:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is Connor but I would still like to know where all these people are going to every day.
1329317435879677953 2020-11-19 14:55:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Scots have almost left it too late already. Little mother and big muslim brother have taken over ! Whatever happened to the Scotland we all knew and loved !
1329317044219752448 2020-11-19 14:54:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The rare voice of common sense ! The latest announcement by Boris is really a way of clearing millions of cars off the roads which are inconvenient. Simple as that ! We will still have Prince Charles lecturing us from his f ... Bentley !
1329315975376859136 2020-11-19 14:50:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All the SNP cares about and their whole existence is about bringing about independence at all costs. Unfortunately many Scots seem very passionate about their vision for Scotland. The Scots are convinced they are missing something which never really existed.
1329315094212304897 2020-11-19 14:46:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't believe they just want it !
1329314810681565184 2020-11-19 14:45:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And still the rejoinosaurs don't see it !
1329314593890590720 2020-11-19 14:44:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As far as I can see on the roads and in the streets what lockdown? This is nothing like the first one.
1329313819382910978 2020-11-19 14:41:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As Corporal Jones said : " They don't like it up' em !"
1329313225708613632 2020-11-19 14:39:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just typical !
1329311757484044289 2020-11-19 14:33:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scarily true !

1329310423158550529 2020-11-19 14:27:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Philip ! This man is full of good advice in his own mind ! He never apologises for stupidity or rudeness!
1329309284673449984 2020-11-19 14:23:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with you David ! By the time we get to Christmas we are sick of the sight of them ! Another annoying. thing is people who don't put their Christmas lights down on the 6th of January.
1329308886248136706 2020-11-19 14:21:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you blame her ?
1329308195794382848 2020-11-19 14:19:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This falls on deaf ears to all our woke obsessed institutions!
1329307846283042816 2020-11-19 14:17:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you look at the TV ads it is already all black ! I am dreaming of a black Christmas !😉
1329307493982461954 2020-11-19 14:16:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have yet to see an electric articulated lorry !😂
1329306972055867392 2020-11-19 14:14:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1329306484484739073 2020-11-19 14:12:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1329305504632418306 2020-11-19 14:08:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You don't wake up my bottom !😂
1329305359702503424 2020-11-19 14:07:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Labour Party still feels like it is a North London centered minority history gazing up their own bottoms !
1329305005640265730 2020-11-19 14:06:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is !
1329304720910020612 2020-11-19 14:05:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Top of the morning to you. too !😍
1329146227552907264 2020-11-19 03:35:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This makes no sense and will achieve nothing except annoyance at best or resentment at worst against mostly Black Britons. This pernicious BLM has been imported from the USA and all institutions have seized upon it as one!
1329142390171578369 2020-11-19 03:20:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s a total absurdity 🤨
1329123088806649857 2020-11-19 02:03:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right! We were much more appreciative because we were not as spoilt and demanding.
1329106492616806403 2020-11-19 00:57:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂

1329093921582956544 2020-11-19 00:07:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would rather not! Creepy photo and very  unphotogenic subjects!
1329092314900230152 2020-11-19 00:01:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mine is 🙈🙈
1329085921031929856 2020-11-18 23:35:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you. 😋
1329070639798308869 2020-11-18 22:35:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe !😋
1329070565592690691 2020-11-18 22:34:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and here they are called trainers, right!
1329069978738253826 2020-11-18 22:32:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think so !
1329069366344777730 2020-11-18 22:30:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> ????😂
1329066157253554176 2020-11-18 22:17:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Plimsolls?
1329053678641221632 2020-11-18 21:27:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet they haven't banned Halal meat !
1329053354992033792 2020-11-18 21:26:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth hurts doesn't it Starmer ! Worry about your own little nest of vipers !
1329051043704041478 2020-11-18 21:17:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Are you taking China's word for anything?
1329050878029000706 2020-11-18 21:16:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For once I have to say I agree with Morgan.
1329050406035607554 2020-11-18 21:14:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no solution until we get a vaccine which many people don't seem to want !
1329047899330768897 2020-11-18 21:04:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Among other things !
1329047642219958272 2020-11-18 21:03:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the satellite power stations . It would take power from the sun and beam it down to earth. That does sound like a good project.
1329046612786765824 2020-11-18 20:59:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the millions of Diesel lorries ?
1329046431047544833 2020-11-18 20:58:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He won't !
1329046264554598401 2020-11-18 20:58:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If that means voting for the Labour Party you must be joking !
1329045870550130688 2020-11-18 20:56:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That will be fine for those who can afford a minimum £30.000 to buy a car!
1329045571131334658 2020-11-18 20:55:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is no excuse !
1329045130364510209 2020-11-18 20:53:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The grid would not cope ! This is fantasy land !
1328990244050513921 2020-11-18 17:15:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but this wears thin after a while!😋
1328990065817739265 2020-11-18 17:14:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋😋
1328963501436637187 2020-11-18 15:29:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right! Historically extremists never fare well with the electorate. Unlike countries like France, Italy and Spain where socialist and communist parties have been powerful. BLM will never succeed in this country for the same reason.
1328961612078833664 2020-11-18 15:21:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How did the party who used to fight racism sunk so low!🙁
1328960415791976450 2020-11-18 15:17:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1328957963269181441 2020-11-18 15:07:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling!😍
1328957883631984645 2020-11-18 15:07:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right Paul! Labour is in shambles and it will take it years to recover if ever!
1328957137851195397 2020-11-18 15:04:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Clever !
1328956294846435328 2020-11-18 15:00:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Both look repulsive to me !
1328955933221933062 2020-11-18 14:59:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The old man and the muzzle !
1328955826539782148 2020-11-18 14:58:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are a shoddy bunch of vile tin pot commissars !
1328955533248884747 2020-11-18 14:57:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely Paul. They are living in the 1930's which is a bit strange for all these 20 years old Corbynistas. I am afraid the Labour Party needs a Tony Blair figure with vision.
1328954781294092291 2020-11-18 14:54:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Bob !

1328954059143909377 2020-11-18 14:51:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they do Connor because she is a bitch ! ( It might take one to know one though!
1328953831787536384 2020-11-18 14:50:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical Liberal voter !  https://t.co/0j8Fg7oADs
1328953714963574784 2020-11-18 14:50:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is a very good question Paul. I think we want a full on military dictatorship for a while anyway ! Looking forward to the uniforms !
1328953362235133955 2020-11-18 14:49:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nasty and stupid !
1328951532868558848 2020-11-18 14:41:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What best symbolises the US election !  https://t.co/xAM752JXGr
1328950682418892800 2020-11-18 14:38:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1328950299084591106 2020-11-18 14:36:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not ! Much talked up about the media. Let us see if they are still happy with their poster boy.
1328949972058955783 2020-11-18 14:35:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck with that Corbyn ! It will be many many years before the Labour Party will be electable again ! You have done a real good job for your party and continue to sabotage it !
1328948681295454209 2020-11-18 14:30:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What do you think ? Its the Tartan Stazis !
1328948469722177542 2020-11-18 14:29:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When you think about it , we have Nazis in Scotland and communists in Wales. Thank you Mrs Blair for this disgusting shamble which can never be put back in the box. Labour left an enormous vacuum in Scotland !
1328947747886690310 2020-11-18 14:26:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fisherpeople !😂😂😂
1328946533945978881 2020-11-18 14:21:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is piss taking on a grand scale !
1328946068978085890 2020-11-18 14:20:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a couple ! The Labour Party has just been set back yet another 5 years !
1328945472367697921 2020-11-18 14:17:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He never left !

1328788058855133194 2020-11-18 03:52:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical Corbyn supporter!  https://t.co/nsDLrRIbRb
1328787023902224385 2020-11-18 03:48:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If it has she would never admit it !
1328785752847683585 2020-11-18 03:43:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks yummy and healthy!
1328785546353774594 2020-11-18 03:42:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Like Markle , Obama and others.
1328782436717748224 2020-11-18 03:29:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1328780337141444608 2020-11-18 03:21:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It absolutely is!😡
1328774729642065920 2020-11-18 02:59:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😳😳😳😳
1328773478628077572 2020-11-18 02:54:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely! Making a mockery of the whole thing!
1328773090143313922 2020-11-18 02:52:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is totally disgraceful and disrespectful! Corbyn refuses to admit any culpability. A miserable man who should go to his allotment and stay there!
1328771494499979266 2020-11-18 02:46:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough!😋
1328770228210323459 2020-11-18 02:41:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Farcical!
1328767500625076224 2020-11-18 02:30:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He never left!😡
1328767151243743232 2020-11-18 02:29:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It didn’t take long to reinstate him!😂
1328762831907524613 2020-11-18 02:12:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who actually cares what Piers wants ?
1328727783636406272 2020-11-17 23:52:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is !
1328713227551858688 2020-11-17 22:54:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They only wheel him in to spout a particular point of view which he can be relied on to spout!
1328710946617954305 2020-11-17 22:45:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They only care about ratings!
1328700094611329025 2020-11-17 22:02:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good day Chris !
1328699680235073542 2020-11-17 22:01:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No these half and half never talk about their white parent! Meghan Markle is another prime example.
1328699170191003648 2020-11-17 21:59:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Owen you would never have been head prefect !
1328698442558922753 2020-11-17 21:56:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wonder how Starmer gets on with his Jewish relatives !😂
1328697533242241025 2020-11-17 21:52:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Other black people want to murder them.
1328697360793427968 2020-11-17 21:51:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course they would ! They would vote for a dog egg if it had a SNP sticker on it !
1328696679944646656 2020-11-17 21:49:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The last time I laughed was earlier this year watching a BBC  "Gone fishing".
1328696250636578816 2020-11-17 21:47:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt it !
1328695784120987653 2020-11-17 21:45:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Andy ! The problem seems a lot of SNP supporters live in the mythical world of Sir Walter Scott which does not exist now and did not exist then! Myths are dangerous !
1328695084016168961 2020-11-17 21:42:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she did ! And look how reviled she is when people rudely refer to her as "Thatcher". It is just not fashionable to praise her !
1328694650710921223 2020-11-17 21:41:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So should you !
1328693537706287104 2020-11-17 21:36:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The great difference is the SNP haven't got the media up their arses all their time because they bloody control it !
1328692639525433350 2020-11-17 21:33:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely must not be allowed to decide fishing quotas !
1328674722956111872 2020-11-17 20:21:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he is ! The SNP is becoming a totalitarian regime obsessed with the notion of independence and willing to sacrifice anything and anyone for it! Beware what you wish for!
1328673996896940033 2020-11-17 20:19:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1328673730730536960 2020-11-17 20:17:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wales hasn’t actually been a great success either!
1328672307838144512 2020-11-17 20:12:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it is! I am sure Lord Sugar did not do particularly well at school and yet had the enterprising spirit to succeed, but I still maintain abolishing grammar schools did not benefit the working class.
1328671145239994369 2020-11-17 20:07:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1328670882286407680 2020-11-17 20:06:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am happy for Marcus but so many able children never get a chance.
1328669625052241923 2020-11-17 20:01:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! Except it is not really working! Si ce grammar schools have almost disappeared working class academic children have lost out.
1328650093092876289 2020-11-17 18:44:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1328629470173990912 2020-11-17 17:22:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cannot disagree with you!😋
1328625879891767300 2020-11-17 17:07:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋
1328615432799064064 2020-11-17 16:26:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why do they keep wheeling in this dinosaur?🤨
1328609596286636032 2020-11-17 16:03:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t like it either! Fair point! I think girls do benefit from the educational system. As we know also a 16 year old girl is usually more mature than a 16 year old boy. Girls are better at verbal skills.
1328604765568327680 2020-11-17 15:43:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is well established that girls do better at exams than boys regardless of their ethnic origins .Your sarcasm is completely unwarranted 😋
1328604186477531138 2020-11-17 15:41:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We certainly do !
1328602731821625345 2020-11-17 15:35:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it has !
1328600318217777154 2020-11-17 15:26:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! Tony Blair again must be blamed .
1328599597418156032 2020-11-17 15:23:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just a bit more Boris bashing 😡😡
1328594132927918080 2020-11-17 15:01:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe 😳😳
1328593655859474438 2020-11-17 14:59:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Owen Jones and Piers Morgan are just good friends ( I presume)!
1328592168676712449 2020-11-17 14:53:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1328590666033672192 2020-11-17 14:47:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell the French fishermen they can stick their gunards  up their derrieres !
1328590045683585027 2020-11-17 14:45:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are in agreement there ! GMB is repetitive childish rubbish but it was better before Piers Morgan.
1328589751369261061 2020-11-17 14:44:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical ! We know what friends he has !
1328589217438572544 2020-11-17 14:42:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too Jen !  https://t.co/GP5VhKoraV
1328589043580489731 2020-11-17 14:41:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Priceless !
1328588598698979328 2020-11-17 14:39:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Paul , it is just that there is too much Government bashing at the moment which is helping nothing and no one. That's my point !
1328588251628711936 2020-11-17 14:38:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love you back !
1328588097853022209 2020-11-17 14:37:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> God preserve us from black snowflakes !
1328587779446607876 2020-11-17 14:36:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can we stop  the Hancock bashing ? Leave to Mr Potato head Morgan !
1328587540803297282 2020-11-17 14:35:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fill your garden with them ! Why don't you invite the BLM as well !😂
1328587258916646912 2020-11-17 14:34:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Connor ! Have a nice day as our American cousins say !
1328586057017946114 2020-11-17 14:29:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What does that say about the far left ?
1328585341490565120 2020-11-17 14:26:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is it so noisy in multi million pounds Holland Park ?
1328584861569982466 2020-11-17 14:24:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said and also little Britannia has made English the world's main language. Not bad for a small island!
1328583807436525568 2020-11-17 14:20:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with you about Nigel. He would not have allowed this constant influx of illegals! Unfortunately he will never be Prime Minister . He is not even an MP. It is very difficult to build a  new viable party .
1328578502707322880 2020-11-17 13:59:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More Boris bashing !
1328578122153938948 2020-11-17 13:58:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks yummy !
1328576905017253889 2020-11-17 13:53:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Rick ! Informative facts !
1328576637970096132 2020-11-17 13:52:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1328574934243827718 2020-11-17 13:45:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank Goodness your are not another Boris basher!🙂
1328574711836643330 2020-11-17 13:44:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Devolution has been a disaster for the United Kingdom and an event like this pandemic has highlighted all its failure. Where a united effort was needed , there was none.
1328408546585833474 2020-11-17 02:44:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! The truth Asian and Jewish boys took education seriously and that is because their parents instilled in them at an early age the importance of education.
1328407575466012672 2020-11-17 02:40:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shockingly true but it has been the case for a very long time. I used to be a secondary school teacher in the early 80’s in London comprehensives and white working class boys consistently underperformed.
1328406846890258435 2020-11-17 02:37:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1328405790655475717 2020-11-17 02:33:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What are you saying! Boris Johnson almost died from the virus! Honestly 🙈🙈🙈
1328402000720011264 2020-11-17 02:18:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said  !
1328395753644027905 2020-11-17 01:53:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I’ll say Patrick !😋
1328391615380123650 2020-11-17 01:36:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! What makes these criminals immune from prosecution. Since did the Met turn into hopeless pillocks ?
1328388808811876354 2020-11-17 01:25:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can’t imagine. I often wonder why they do it!
1328388136033005569 2020-11-17 01:23:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No they don’t but what is your constructive and considered suggestion on this matter? Would love to hear it!
1328387731643359232 2020-11-17 01:21:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes exactly with their thoughtless and constant criticisms. Is there not enough gloom and doom?🤨
1328387045874671616 2020-11-17 01:18:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So do I Deb! A lot of the criticism is very glib and often based on rumours.
1328386278728081408 2020-11-17 01:15:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Do you honestly think that that Labour shadow health minister could do any better? Honestly? I don’t think so.
1328384596308791297 2020-11-17 01:09:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a jumped up “connard” !
1328384435331403776 2020-11-17 01:08:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> To be honest I never did!😂
1328367756811640832 2020-11-17 00:02:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nobody has said he has got it!
1328363826073493505 2020-11-16 23:46:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can we wait and see what happens in the next few weeks?
1328341712633290754 2020-11-16 22:18:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And from me !
1328337179144318978 2020-11-16 22:00:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So terrible!
1328336635575070720 2020-11-16 21:58:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet 😂
1328336273476620288 2020-11-16 21:57:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I know what you mean but Marr is so biased he irritates me!
1328335304982474752 2020-11-16 21:53:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and if he didn’t follow the rules to the letter he would be also condemned
1328334983015112706 2020-11-16 21:51:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never 🤨
1328333372423348224 2020-11-16 21:45:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t watch Marr anymore!
1328332683450183680 2020-11-16 21:42:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he is ! We should all ignore him, he would hate that!
1328331960624828418 2020-11-16 21:39:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True 😋
1328317635247927296 2020-11-16 20:42:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please don’t darling, it’s a mine field!😳
1328317233928540161 2020-11-16 20:41:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this all about foreplay?What a revelation!😝
1328311922891104256 2020-11-16 20:20:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And I also like your style!
1328310578360758273 2020-11-16 20:14:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Boring !🙁
1328309590761594884 2020-11-16 20:10:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1328309403590811648 2020-11-16 20:10:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have heard of necking but “neck on” what’s that?😳
1328300591689457666 2020-11-16 19:35:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I preferred Terry and Bob the Likely Lads! They were funny!😂
1328292652819820545 2020-11-16 19:03:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! and yet very popular millionaires! I am not sure what it says about our culture!
1328288929976627200 2020-11-16 18:48:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I could never understand why they are so popular and win these TV awards year after year!🙈🙈
1328284310626045952 2020-11-16 18:30:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hancock has obviously more important things to do than listen to you potato head!
1328283642204987392 2020-11-16 18:27:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Has he though?😏
1328249865755877376 2020-11-16 16:13:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very welcome Clive. As long as someone stays in your memory that person never leaves you! All the best!😍
1328239000600121344 2020-11-16 15:30:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It does but for how long?
1328237632925675522 2020-11-16 15:25:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So very sorry for your loss! With Christmas on the horizon it is such a cruel time!
1328235132617166848 2020-11-16 15:15:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too ! Enjoy your break!
1328234483984822272 2020-11-16 15:12:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too darling!😍
1328234133500403715 2020-11-16 15:11:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Chris!😋
1328233922061332482 2020-11-16 15:10:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anything to bash Boris!
1328232086860410880 2020-11-16 15:03:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You old flatterer! Flattery will get you nowhere with me!😂
1328230845698740225 2020-11-16 14:58:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Less of the age and more of the beauty please !
1328230692812156928 2020-11-16 14:57:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hopefully not !
1328229765652881408 2020-11-16 14:53:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are missing the point completely. This is not to protect Boris but the people around him !
1328228943888052224 2020-11-16 14:50:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I knew you would !🙂
1328228845556801537 2020-11-16 14:50:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You do wonder at times where they are all going ! You have got a point !
1328227831986479104 2020-11-16 14:46:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank Goodness for Lord Frost !
1328227643733454848 2020-11-16 14:45:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Last night there was a very rare treat from the BBC . Ronney Scott on BBC 4 !
1328227413994639360 2020-11-16 14:44:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You cannot be a legend until you are dead. People misuse the term. King Arthur is a legend not some modern pillock like Lewis " earrings" Hamilton !
1328227086759305216 2020-11-16 14:43:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely agree with you ! Our silent heroes !
1328226840398401536 2020-11-16 14:42:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> WE have noticed the traffic is much busier. They are all going somewhere!
1328226115572408320 2020-11-16 14:39:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have done so !
1328225937574473729 2020-11-16 14:38:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !😍
1328224862847062017 2020-11-16 14:34:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sincerely hope so my darling ! Have a great week !
1328224500266184706 2020-11-16 14:32:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He certainly would do a far better job than the current mayor. (Some of) London would be grateful!
1328224043397505024 2020-11-16 14:31:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe it was all a performance ! He knows the media well!
1328223579100520448 2020-11-16 14:29:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning early bird !
1328223444002086912 2020-11-16 14:28:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, The BBCwill always be on the EU side and found no fault with them. We are the villains for wanting to leave the EU.
1328221947298197507 2020-11-16 14:22:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No you are. not ! I don't and never will ! I cannot stand Ant &amp; Dec !
1328080838290976768 2020-11-16 05:02:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tempting as it is I can’t because I have to use knowledge of a person before I can do a reading, and you are a stranger.😏
1328078148668432385 2020-11-16 04:51:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am trying to visualise me doing it but no I am definitely sticking to card reading! 😋
1328076754385334273 2020-11-16 04:45:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Little is the operative word I’m afraid!😥
1328075517942259712 2020-11-16 04:40:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s a thought!🤨🤨
1328072120195280901 2020-11-16 04:27:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Mary!

1328069184971026438 2020-11-16 04:15:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So modest !🙈
1328068254166822913 2020-11-16 04:12:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I used to many years ago but just for fun with friends.I think I still have a Spanish pack somewhere.
1328066427765612545 2020-11-16 04:04:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tarot card reading is more my thing!😋
1328065947484237837 2020-11-16 04:02:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am good at this. 😂
1328065403063504898 2020-11-16 04:00:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought you might be creative and maybe a little eccentric and a bit of a perfectionist! Just saying!😋
1328064228100628481 2020-11-16 03:56:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The age of Aquarius! I don’t know much about this sign! I think you are creative ...
1328062101630357506 2020-11-16 03:47:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Interesting summing up! Some truth in it but not the whole picture.  What sign are you ?
1328060186821586947 2020-11-16 03:39:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No !
1328059092573843456 2020-11-16 03:35:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scorpio !😏
1328056506223300610 2020-11-16 03:25:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1328054235200704513 2020-11-16 03:16:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂😂
1328038728204423168 2020-11-16 02:14:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she was !
1328023507188539397 2020-11-16 01:14:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They do and they never age! The best comedies tell us a lot about the human condition.😋
1328017161005256704 2020-11-16 00:48:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't forget "Steptoe and Son" super script and acting. Very superior and much more than a comedy.
1328016783010385928 2020-11-16 00:47:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Irish are getting brave again in spite of been shat on comprehensively by the EU !
1328016341459230726 2020-11-16 00:45:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Justine ! If BBC I player produces one more program on slavery I can't vouch what I will do !
1328015541399932928 2020-11-16 00:42:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nor has mine . She was crap then and she is crap now and probably always will be crap.
1328014964485976070 2020-11-16 00:40:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> WE still think she was crap !
1328014524620943360 2020-11-16 00:38:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If only I had known before I voted it would have made all the difference!
1328014028212498432 2020-11-16 00:36:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is blatant racism in action. Discrimination laws don't apply to whites !
1328013611676078082 2020-11-16 00:34:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No sense of irony ! What a knob !
1328013386983075842 2020-11-16 00:33:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck with all that Caledonia !
1328011878715502592 2020-11-16 00:27:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If he dares to answer you back don't flounce out ! Don't keep interrupting your weasel. She is paid a lot of money to back you up !😂
1328009001603313669 2020-11-16 00:16:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can shove your action plan where the sun don't shine !
1328008571372662786 2020-11-16 00:14:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought they were anti discriminatory laws but don't seem to apply in this case.
1328007543780745216 2020-11-16 00:10:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly Miss Abacus is still around !
1328006201418915842 2020-11-16 00:05:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good old Anglo Saxon names !
1327988055970549765 2020-11-15 22:53:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> NO !
1327987384894562305 2020-11-15 22:50:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s because it is so pretty and what probably many Americans think is typical rural England. Of course it is not typical anything but so beautiful !
1327973671227576323 2020-11-15 21:56:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1327945807270735873 2020-11-15 20:05:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If he is a student he is a mature one!
1327945592484618243 2020-11-15 20:04:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think it is a parody who knows?
1327934686186844160 2020-11-15 19:21:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I feel exactly the same as you, and I don’t think we are the only ones. My husband refuses to watch any news!
1327934304610119681 2020-11-15 19:19:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How could we forget?😡
1327930607188512768 2020-11-15 19:05:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And constantly attacking the Government. This got worse after the Brexit referendum !
1327930316519059457 2020-11-15 19:03:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC is just agenda led mindless trash!
1327929853916700672 2020-11-15 19:02:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I imagine that Marr was crossed legged on the floor listening to his every word!
1327929350600192001 2020-11-15 19:00:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are being cancelled, wrong age, wrong popular!
1327929069611208708 2020-11-15 18:58:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can agree with you in that Michael 😋
1327927692247838720 2020-11-15 18:53:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Did he now?
1327926973532925952 2020-11-15 18:50:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilary who? Not a patch on his father!
1327926460389199873 2020-11-15 18:48:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brown is the man who sold our gold reserves and for two whole days he was the man who saved the world. This is the man the BBC looks up too!😳😳
1327924559379648512 2020-11-15 18:41:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is never going to work!
1327924419797393408 2020-11-15 18:40:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Scottish media must have been gagged!
1327881387060375557 2020-11-15 15:49:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Like , so, gutted and devastated to just name a few.
1327876725305466881 2020-11-15 15:30:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Top of the morning to you Chris ! Extremely wet in the South East today !
1327875559679025152 2020-11-15 15:26:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1327875425318658048 2020-11-15 15:25:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nicola Sturgeon's daily reports is like the work Winston Smith was doing when he was rewriting history every day! I think "1984" is her bible not "Big Brother" but "little mother"
1327875061483794437 2020-11-15 15:24:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they have been relentlessly told so !
1327874602664669186 2020-11-15 15:22:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There will certainly not be the facilities to keep all these electric cars charged up even if everyone can somehow afford £30.000 on an electric car.
1327873538854952966 2020-11-15 15:18:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have a good idea who is in charge and it is not bloody Carrie.
1327872606876426245 2020-11-15 15:14:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right !
1327872272065970180 2020-11-15 15:13:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wishful thinking Blackford !
1327871982466183168 2020-11-15 15:12:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The only reason they are interviewing this relic of times gone by is that they know he is always reliable in trashing the Conservatives.
1327868988794286080 2020-11-15 15:00:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wish they were more like him !
1327868744937431040 2020-11-15 14:59:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are only three alternatives possible : he, she or it.
1327868393962270720 2020-11-15 14:57:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us just stick with black .
1327867266424254464 2020-11-15 14:53:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The thought people have finally got to them then !
1327865050548350976 2020-11-15 14:44:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂😂
1327864675531427840 2020-11-15 14:43:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Daisy I think we need to calm down . Boris did not get the PM job by been such a weak ninny as you are portraying him to be ! Let us have more faith in him !
1327863728042369024 2020-11-15 14:39:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are well shot off !
1327861526024294402 2020-11-15 14:30:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's how it should be ! Time for every one to calm down!
1327702639350571014 2020-11-15 03:59:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have a very sweet tooth! Yummy!😋
1327701067853860864 2020-11-15 03:52:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Interesting looking! Any coconut on the top?
1327700877860331524 2020-11-15 03:52:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just a bit more!😂😂
1327698589922037762 2020-11-15 03:43:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Busy bee  🐝
1327696654196219907 2020-11-15 03:35:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No of course not !😡😡
1327694912020733953 2020-11-15 03:28:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤨🤨🤨
1327693414205362176 2020-11-15 03:22:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Michael, I have heard enough!
1327691880814022656 2020-11-15 03:16:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Best wishes for a speedy recovery for your wife.
1327691145376391172 2020-11-15 03:13:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have to agree. These were barbaric and cowardly acts which can never be justified.
1327690754660196353 2020-11-15 03:11:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid he is !
1327690617825222657 2020-11-15 03:11:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Michael , my point is U do not believe that acts of evil perpetrated by one side justify similar acts in the other side. It is not about killing horses, cowardly acts, it is about all the innocent lives lost and for what?
1327687374374047754 2020-11-15 02:58:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Michael are you saying that the IRA was justified whatever they did . One crime justifies another !
1327669619293892614 2020-11-15 01:47:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I didn’t know about the statue. One of the IRA ‘s “speciality” was booby trapping the dead.
1327669125636829185 2020-11-15 01:46:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know, so sad!
1327667234119028736 2020-11-15 01:38:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And don’t forget the horses. The IRA were criminals, nothing else.
1327666904857763845 2020-11-15 01:37:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a specimen he would be as a Prime Minister. Both Biden and him are not in the real world. God preserve us from ageing old hits with strange fixations.
1327666043972628481 2020-11-15 01:33:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1327665857066119168 2020-11-15 01:33:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure he did!
1327665298678419462 2020-11-15 01:30:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Possibly but under Boris I am not sure that the civil servants have quite the same day as anymore.
1327664961456398337 2020-11-15 01:29:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why don’t you lie on the road in front of the houses of Parliament as a one man protest Piers because I fear it would only be one man!😜
1327664366238502912 2020-11-15 01:27:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So all these negotiations hang on just one man? I don’t see it.
1327662431204732931 2020-11-15 01:19:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and there are a lot of them!
1327662208675942401 2020-11-15 01:18:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In the 1950’s all this was mapped out in advance. It wasn’t a series of random developments. Devolution was a way of breaking us up into provinces.
1327661283622211585 2020-11-15 01:14:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Alastair Campbell is still dragged out by some broadcasters and his past disgraceful behaviour is completely forgotten. Ironic or what? Have you looked in the mirror Campbell?
1327658687494836224 2020-11-15 01:04:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It would be but try finding journalists who are unbiased these days. Not easy!
1327657939671379968 2020-11-15 01:01:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If that is the way you are, that is that!😋
1327657621164331008 2020-11-15 01:00:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No not an obituary but salacious tittle tattle in the Mail. The Mail has changed editor and is now largely anti Boris.
1327657234973790208 2020-11-15 00:58:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love you back!😍
1327656578686836738 2020-11-15 00:56:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s not only the Guardian. There are 16 pages on Sutcliffe in today’s mail. He was inexplicably pampered and introduced to celebrities like Bruno. That particular meeting was arranged by Saville!
1327655547282264065 2020-11-15 00:52:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Doesn’t anyone give them a good answer? I hope they do.
1327654020865986560 2020-11-15 00:45:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surely next Year cannot turn out worse than this one! Let’s stay positive 😋
1327653258278678528 2020-11-15 00:42:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Any positive news?
1327651399937691649 2020-11-15 00:35:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Happy New Year 🤩
1327644320283963392 2020-11-15 00:07:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True Chris! But kindness is sometimes in short supply the same as good manners which is a form of kindness and respect.
1327632911101808640 2020-11-14 23:22:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously!
1327627204415598592 2020-11-14 22:59:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😜😜😜
1327626792161697792 2020-11-14 22:57:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely! Let us see who has the last laugh
1327625962385764353 2020-11-14 22:54:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true!
1327624775636758529 2020-11-14 22:49:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That says it all Ricky!😋
1327596478521602050 2020-11-14 20:57:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know!
1327592636455247874 2020-11-14 20:42:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Bernie!
1327591458635980803 2020-11-14 20:37:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If he is referring to the SNP absolutely agree with him but I don’t think that is the case. I think he is talking about apparently breaking the law when we leave the EU! Absolute twaddle!
1327590672350765057 2020-11-14 20:34:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely
1327590419136475136 2020-11-14 20:33:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am very happy for you! I am an Anglo Gaul and proud of it. 😋  https://t.co/jY8haHiHPc
1327588982616633352 2020-11-14 20:27:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe Erin but who is going to replace Boris?
1327588378313969664 2020-11-14 20:25:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes all that ! Who would you actually  put your trust in now? Don’t say Nigel Farahe because that is not going to happen!
1327587716050128900 2020-11-14 20:22:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am impressed too Bernie! Many of us remember when London was not a multicultural cesspit and the Police was more respected and did not kneel to a Marxist rabble in the streets.
1327586801930874881 2020-11-14 20:18:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC always puts minorities before anything!
1327586512318423041 2020-11-14 20:17:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hypocrisy is their middle name !
1327569142648541184 2020-11-14 19:08:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No 4!🤣
1327568057980645377 2020-11-14 19:04:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too darling!😋
1327567090384052225 2020-11-14 19:00:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning though not very sunny in the South East!😋
1327565581831331840 2020-11-14 18:54:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Un escroc !
1327565334807793665 2020-11-14 18:53:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When the BBC stopped showing “ One man and his dog” that was the beginning of the end.
1327564883177697281 2020-11-14 18:51:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is ridiculous to try and compare our Police with the American Police. Absolutely extreme opposite!
1327563506103832576 2020-11-14 18:46:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it could well be !
1327563090687356928 2020-11-14 18:44:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is puzzling and so embarrassing !
1327562531624325120 2020-11-14 18:42:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not entirely surprised but still things need to change otherwise who is going to want to join the Police force never mind stay in it !Khan wants to fill their ranks with ethnic.
1327557691489730560 2020-11-14 18:23:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1327557474858176512 2020-11-14 18:22:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well Dick you are living in a dream world, you will never ever reach your quota. All this appeasement of a foreign Marxist movement is reprehensible.
1327556643727478786 2020-11-14 18:19:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t understand how these senior police officers gain these posts. They use the right hymn sheet! Why would they want to promote an organisation who wants to destroy them.
1327555413127155712 2020-11-14 18:14:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Less and less .....
1327555194268299265 2020-11-14 18:13:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is crazy!🙈🙈🙈
1327555087032602625 2020-11-14 18:12:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1327528796753457152 2020-11-14 16:28:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And so another victory for fake news! Accept to Peston the truth does not matter. it what suits the agenda. What an unprofessional journalist he is !
1327528097403506688 2020-11-14 16:25:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes so do I ! The fourth  Reich !

1327523769208942592 2020-11-14 16:08:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surprise! Surprise! Where is the justice for all the victims. The silly country is rapidly turning into the downright stupid country.
1327523069552971777 2020-11-14 16:05:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes please GMB !
1327522085737025536 2020-11-14 16:01:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I meant gits  not girls!
1327521791137492992 2020-11-14 16:00:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In fact not anyone! I like the image!
1327521531128389632 2020-11-14 15:59:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It escapes me why anyone would want to follow you in the first place! To actually beg to come back to you? There are some really sad girls in this world!
1327512194494423041 2020-11-14 15:22:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Speculating again !
1327511821541117952 2020-11-14 15:20:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1327511245101162496 2020-11-14 15:18:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very funny ! Have a lovely day Bernie !😍
1327510748122243072 2020-11-14 15:16:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely ! The problem is that now more than ever we need a media who gives her the real facts not distortions and wishful thinking.
1327509556503732225 2020-11-14 15:11:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are only stating the obvious, it does not make you a racist !
1327509334801133568 2020-11-14 15:11:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There was more going on during the war than there is now !
1327509044920274945 2020-11-14 15:09:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He can't bear to lose us ! He will never get over it ! 😂😂
1327508853488046080 2020-11-14 15:09:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well he would wouldn't he ? The EU have never been keen on democracy.
1327508525963218944 2020-11-14 15:07:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a bit of a fat joke ! He is like a parrot trying to recite Shakespeare !
1327508141723017218 2020-11-14 15:06:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why this negativity ???
1327507820934291456 2020-11-14 15:05:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Such negativity !
1327507593175166976 2020-11-14 15:04:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Chris !
1327507205818621954 2020-11-14 15:02:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Black lives don't matter to Khan in London !
1327507013908258816 2020-11-14 15:01:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who elected Verhofstadt?
1327506724580954112 2020-11-14 15:00:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is how it has been portrayed by the media but when have trusted the media to tell the truth?
1327506097364676608 2020-11-14 14:58:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And he might have preferred it !
1327505486657298433 2020-11-14 14:55:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Adorable !
1327504984267771904 2020-11-14 14:53:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What evidence is there really that this is the case ? The media thinks it knows more than it does and creates its own drama and narrative to suit its personal agenda. I think by now we should be wise to their moves.
1327504556427767808 2020-11-14 14:52:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too Angie !
1327504192643227648 2020-11-14 14:50:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely Paul ! This is obviously a way of stirring up the rejoinosaurs ! Pathetic and predictable!
1327503879391547392 2020-11-14 14:49:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All you have done Piers is try to scare people and get back to the Government for their slight of you. Relentless, childish and absurdly self centred.
1327503064979415040 2020-11-14 14:46:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Missed you right back !😂
1327502497158721536 2020-11-14 14:43:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are back darling !  I really missed you, you old tease! Is this a flying visit ?
1327502260537073664 2020-11-14 14:42:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The dishonourable Lady should shut her trap !
1327501686303289344 2020-11-14 14:40:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Sue !
1327501576781651968 2020-11-14 14:40:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> By burning your stupid calendar ! for God's sake get over it You have turned into the old misery guts in the corner of the pub. People will start avoiding you ! Boring !
1327500664109404160 2020-11-14 14:36:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is why so much abuse has been heaped on him !
1327500571348230145 2020-11-14 14:36:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1327500167029936130 2020-11-14 14:34:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too ! Looking very chilled out !
1327499622886084608 2020-11-14 14:32:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Massive wishful thinking there !
1327499040603467776 2020-11-14 14:30:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You know it all Femi! Your powers of deduction are Holmesian! Thank Christ you are not Prime Minister.
1327497876067508227 2020-11-14 14:25:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is way too much emphasis. Just turn on BBC I player and what do you see ? ..........
1327497643979890688 2020-11-14 14:24:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No
1327497477721903104 2020-11-14 14:23:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We do need clarification ! Both sides are showing irresponsibility !
1327496993103638528 2020-11-14 14:22:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A bit of both !
1327496911067226112 2020-11-14 14:21:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our European friends !
1327360303294771201 2020-11-14 05:18:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all! That’s the norm! Most positive news is never told. They like to magnify the gloom and doom. So predictable!
1327313461446107136 2020-11-14 02:12:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us see!
1327311251203035142 2020-11-14 02:03:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For cases like this yes!
1327308313827168262 2020-11-14 01:52:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1327306767689191426 2020-11-14 01:46:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it would!
1327306299969843200 2020-11-14 01:44:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We bloody hope not  !
1327305869449695233 2020-11-14 01:42:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Interesting analysis! You know what they say “ Love is blind”!
1327305357094424576 2020-11-14 01:40:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Junie! What this incident is that he is an intolerant know it all! Compassionate my arse!🙈
1327302898892599297 2020-11-14 01:30:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately our mayor is a very silly and dangerous man!
1327302704947978240 2020-11-14 01:29:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes let’s go for a complete blackout in the Met Police!
1327285494137430022 2020-11-14 00:21:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most of us do and want him out!
1327285239790571522 2020-11-14 00:20:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well he is !
1327252339024072704 2020-11-13 22:09:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The time on the clock.
1327246704987484165 2020-11-13 21:47:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1327246569545076736 2020-11-13 21:46:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are never going to find so many non white recruits?
1327217737932935168 2020-11-13 19:52:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bloody hell John!
1327217560044048384 2020-11-13 19:51:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s a lot of followers per month Mal!😋
1327181399808466944 2020-11-13 17:27:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are all wondering if anyone really moved in?
1327181039710707712 2020-11-13 17:26:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! Lammy ‘s comments seem to apply more relevant to Allistair Campbell.😋
1327170379148881920 2020-11-13 16:44:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Advisers have always come and gone, Alistair Campbell been a case in hand.
1327165405757136896 2020-11-13 16:24:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Big fat zero!
1327151238266449922 2020-11-13 15:28:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! A very good analogy!
1327149452549906440 2020-11-13 15:21:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too !😍
1327149013401997317 2020-11-13 15:19:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So very sorry for your loss Steve. Your mum will always be with you .
1327148027438567426 2020-11-13 15:15:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is Sturgeon’s mate! Birds of a feather......
1327146916933677057 2020-11-13 15:10:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1327146555179233280 2020-11-13 15:09:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadism is equally horrific whether the victims are people or animals.
1327145516279484418 2020-11-13 15:05:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surprise! Surprise!
1327142693391175688 2020-11-13 14:54:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The original Doctor Barnardo would have been disgusted. Yet another virtue signalling institution which will lose out.
1327141877917872128 2020-11-13 14:50:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is the penny finally dropping ?
1327141328740868098 2020-11-13 14:48:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They know that Cummings was a vital part in engineering Brexit and he won't be going anywhere until Brexit is done.
1327140581349462017 2020-11-13 14:45:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is just Westminster village gossip and of no interest to us at all.
1327140366303305731 2020-11-13 14:44:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well done the Scottish team ! Obviously not sheeple! badly done our team !
1327139566126583809 2020-11-13 14:41:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bob Dylan was right ! The world seems to be regressing !
1327139208687988736 2020-11-13 14:40:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not really that surprised ! Rob Roy Blackford has never struck as the most intelligent man in the world. His talent lies in mindlessly mouthing off !
1327138799755915264 2020-11-13 14:38:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Then if Brussels remains completely intransigent then it's no deal, what else can it be ? At this stage Boris will not back down.
1327138268987727876 2020-11-13 14:36:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's only a matter of time !
1327138152046350336 2020-11-13 14:36:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not lose hope Joe !
1327137843257487362 2020-11-13 14:34:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1327137667302219782 2020-11-13 14:34:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very moving pictures !
1327137492802412545 2020-11-13 14:33:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have summed it up David. The "bearded " children strike again !
1327136083629445126 2020-11-13 14:27:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because of our fearful liberal establishment .
1327135315514040327 2020-11-13 14:24:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How come in the EU in no way shares any blame ever with these people ?
1326950599729049605 2020-11-13 02:10:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Harsh!😳😳
1326950116205457409 2020-11-13 02:08:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never!
1326915581203902465 2020-11-12 23:51:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Chickens don’t quack but you rabbit!😋
1326915250013265923 2020-11-12 23:50:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds fair!
1326915145990336512 2020-11-12 23:49:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The day Boris leaves Downing Street, you will be struck dumb with nothing to say! And then you will be the wrong man in the wrong place!🤣
1326888231963652099 2020-11-12 22:03:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How dare they make such an assumption! Wishful thinking?
1326879369890066432 2020-11-12 21:27:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They would be in mourning for years and if they had teenagers it would be much worse again. Tantrums and  saying "My life lies in ruins" and other  tears at bedtime.
1326878394462720002 2020-11-12 21:23:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! we were in Cambridge relatively recently and we did notice the town seemed to have gone downhill.
1326875170116689920 2020-11-12 21:11:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Now they are universally despised as the BLM will be if they are not already !
1326874715068174336 2020-11-12 21:09:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good comment ! and to think that if it wasn't for the pandemic he might not be there now ! Another casualty of the pandemic.
1326872665362141186 2020-11-12 21:01:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The original attraction was just. money . Every single EU country does not want its culture.
1326872255129858049 2020-11-12 20:59:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they do and of course they have lost all credibility
1326871836806811648 2020-11-12 20:57:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Laura seems to think it is a one way negotiation. Is she implying that the EU is blameless in all this ? another traitor to add to the list.
1326871368374358018 2020-11-12 20:56:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly Chris !
1326870630004891650 2020-11-12 20:53:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And a total blackout on TV !
1326869883020341250 2020-11-12 20:50:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> BBC news is all gloom and doom. They don't want good news but just want things they can beat the government with.
1326869455792697344 2020-11-12 20:48:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a clue Maurice ! Maybe the n ..... word has been overused in certain quarters.
1326869037889040384 2020-11-12 20:46:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No I don't but I am not sure you have got all the facts. I would not completely deny that the racism factor played no role and in fact it did and it still does. Of course you are entitled to your opinion.
1326868267512762376 2020-11-12 20:43:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and once trust is gone it takes a long time to get it back as the Liberal Party has already found out .
1326867732642607105 2020-11-12 20:41:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for the Austrians !
1326867264147247105 2020-11-12 20:39:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Grilled tomatoes !
1326866457255424001 2020-11-12 20:36:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A load of rancid old fossils! The relics of many failed politicians!

1326786805954469890 2020-11-12 15:19:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They probably are !😋
1326781536486756352 2020-11-12 14:59:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1326781082784641031 2020-11-12 14:57:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here, here !
1326779550655787010 2020-11-12 14:51:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for you ! Take them to the cleaners.
1326779340391141376 2020-11-12 14:50:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet another British institution infiltrated !
1326778265646804992 2020-11-12 14:46:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell that to the liberal hand wringers!
1326777935878086659 2020-11-12 14:44:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you listened to the media Sturgeon is a paragon of efficiency when really she is a useless little demagogue, trying to cover her tracks.
1326773126458454016 2020-11-12 14:25:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This professor is just stupid! Across the road they have already put up their Christmas lights !
1326771874060185600 2020-11-12 14:20:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This has been decided by the "Minister of Truth" i.e. the woke media and is the law.
1326771289734995969 2020-11-12 14:18:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neither was Obama and if he was in for 8 years !
1326771036809998337 2020-11-12 14:17:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It has been beneficial but next year things might change and then what ?
1326770761550409730 2020-11-12 14:16:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is Sturgeon listening ?
1326603485098479617 2020-11-12 03:11:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are absolutely right!
1326594779422003201 2020-11-12 02:36:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is disappearing!
1326594487402029056 2020-11-12 02:35:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👍👍
1326584671791157249 2020-11-12 01:56:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes absolutely! It’s just people looking for trouble and fake outrage!
1326582756512591872 2020-11-12 01:49:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes indeed!🙈🙈
1326578434525499394 2020-11-12 01:32:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s why they are all clamouring to learn a foreign language! Not! Us leaving the EU is not destroying anyone’s life.
1326577990986305542 2020-11-12 01:30:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope the BBC is taken to the cleaners regarding the Bashir scandal!
1326574543209684992 2020-11-12 01:16:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beautiful!
1326564166803599360 2020-11-12 00:35:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree!
1326549086409908231 2020-11-11 23:35:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My goodness some remainers are relentless! Give it a bone!
1326548726651871239 2020-11-11 23:33:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a tragic event!
1326547926013759488 2020-11-11 23:30:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true !
1326546876242358278 2020-11-11 23:26:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Such a words of wisdom Zara!😂
1326522146030579712 2020-11-11 21:48:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This was not published at all and the police just watched !
1326521576486039552 2020-11-11 21:46:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Paul you are right !
1326521300026859522 2020-11-11 21:44:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Met police  are very brave with easy targets but confronted with the BLM they either do nothing or run away.
1326520352340668418 2020-11-11 21:41:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1326449232082038784 2020-11-11 16:58:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1326442810594238464 2020-11-11 16:33:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The word “ coloured” was used in America for at least 50 years as a polite euphemism for blacks. Now black is a perfectly acceptable label!🙈🙈🙈
1326433252865937408 2020-11-11 15:55:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning from a dry and very mild South East 😋
1326432737637634049 2020-11-11 15:53:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Traitorous as ever !
1326419801854636036 2020-11-11 15:01:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't think they do to the same extent ! This is reaching epidemic proportions,  they are all at it from Major to Clegg.
1326419495905337350 2020-11-11 15:00:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are "certain crimes" which are almost a hanging offence now !
1326418722840567809 2020-11-11 14:57:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Silly Country strikes again ! Will they never learn !
1326416739601674240 2020-11-11 14:49:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this Merkel talking ? The woman who was very quick to ruin her own country ? Why is she still there ? I thought she was retiring?
1326414713245343747 2020-11-11 14:41:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It was always a stupidly dangerous idea which was never going to work concocted by people who live in a dreamworld. Unfortunately they have destroyed the lives of so many and the life of European culture.
1326414173358714881 2020-11-11 14:39:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1326412470441955328 2020-11-11 14:32:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is  becoming a totalitarian take over and very dangerous. Mrs Sturgeon should have George Orwell's "1984" at her bedside or maybe she is reading it .....
1326411959294627843 2020-11-11 14:30:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I'll say ! It doesn't bear thinking about !
1326411569773891585 2020-11-11 14:28:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Jeremy is right . Khan is really still on under false pretences  and he has been proved to be totally incompetent and extremely biased towards certain groups.
1326410469150765056 2020-11-11 14:24:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with what you say ! If a very experienced man get be sacked for one word what kind of country has this become and what really really irritates is all the faked outrage.
1326243897736048645 2020-11-11 03:22:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As direct as always!😂

1326226124108673024 2020-11-11 02:12:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They will never stop !🤨🤨
1326183766184882177 2020-11-10 23:23:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Paul it’s all bollocks!
1326160170821545985 2020-11-10 21:49:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have been used to the Americans supporting the IRA for years and obviously it is still going on.
1326159803035561984 2020-11-10 21:48:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lucky you !
1326159639680069632 2020-11-10 21:47:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Forget Boris ! They hate the English and also they are under the illusion that all their problems will disappear overnight if they become independent and they believe it !
1326158845719310336 2020-11-10 21:44:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No please no more !
1326158062206455808 2020-11-10 21:41:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It has never been harder for a muslim because of all the terrorism they have engendered .

1326152164989923334 2020-11-10 21:18:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surprise, surprise, she got away with it ! and yet the media is still going about Cummings ! As far as the media is concerned there is one rule for the Conservative party and another rule for all others !
1326151416277250048 2020-11-10 21:15:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope he is donating his fees to starving children !
1326151088207245314 2020-11-10 21:13:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A lido is a sort of swimming pool and there is one in Saltdean , I have seen it !

1326138345043398656 2020-11-10 20:23:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet he is! He has committed criminal acts.
1326075648809570305 2020-11-10 16:14:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All forgotten Kevin! Let us move on! Have a good day!
1326074457140711424 2020-11-10 16:09:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What has all this nonsense you are talking about to do with this vaccination? Kevin no one is going to force you to take this vaccine so what is your problem?
1326072749601787909 2020-11-10 16:02:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When I was a child we were just lined up at school for the vaccines. No questions about it and the diseases disappeared from general circulation.
1326072098293477377 2020-11-10 16:00:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So after you are dead you will just move on !Neat trick !😂😂

1326064875341303808 2020-11-10 15:31:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is true but the man is so enormously egoistical that he would rather be vilified than ignored. Childish or what?😂

1326054988934688769 2020-11-10 14:52:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Want doesn't always get !
1326054338993795072 2020-11-10 14:49:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Less sportspeople and media rabble !
1326053788566884353 2020-11-10 14:47:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are quite right !
1326053344411082752 2020-11-10 14:45:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scotland is rapidly turning into "Air strip one".
1326052666145972224 2020-11-10 14:42:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are not some sort of colony of America ! Just because Biden is of Irish descent does not give him the right to boss us around !
1326052058118676481 2020-11-10 14:40:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the EU method , keep on voting till you get the right answer!

1325887171937656840 2020-11-10 03:45:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1325821906818396162 2020-11-09 23:25:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They can be very naive and full of their own importance so why not ?
1325821070570622977 2020-11-09 23:22:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Liar liar pants on fire ! Her whole body language is wrong and does not inspire confidence!
1325820661344964608 2020-11-09 23:20:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There would be joining a very long queue!

1325771820537163777 2020-11-09 20:06:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is one of your many X friends. However you were spot in regarding Meghan and Harry this morning.

1325769596155129856 2020-11-09 19:57:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This might be the final straw for the BBC as this scandal tops all

1325739333161250817 2020-11-09 17:57:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it seems in the nature of the job!
1325707699695259649 2020-11-09 15:52:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true!
1325705603373785088 2020-11-09 15:43:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! And a Bush and Blair alliance had disastrous consequences!
1325704847958609922 2020-11-09 15:40:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning to you ! Very mild and dry in the South East!
1325704383624065024 2020-11-09 15:38:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! Basta. !😡😡
1325703929309618176 2020-11-09 15:37:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a man who failed to become president twice before and he is not physically or mentally to be president. Is he really the best candidate the Democrats could put forward?
1325703114889027584 2020-11-09 15:33:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> NO! Stinks!
1325702265345347584 2020-11-09 15:30:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> People forget that the USA is a foreign country which happens to speak a version of English!
1325701946318196736 2020-11-09 15:29:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Another myth that needs to be debunked!
1325701447695077376 2020-11-09 15:27:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😍😍😍
1325701128286244864 2020-11-09 15:25:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day Chris!
1325697900119285760 2020-11-09 15:13:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂  https://t.co/stoECZKrml
1325697689854615553 2020-11-09 15:12:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1325696971915587584 2020-11-09 15:09:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is there such a leader?😋
1325696647196708865 2020-11-09 15:08:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1325696116042690560 2020-11-09 15:05:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And then what?
1325695330843844608 2020-11-09 15:02:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1325694747890028545 2020-11-09 15:00:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As usual the Americans just don't get irony and of course overestimates their own importance.
1325694444058914816 2020-11-09 14:59:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU is so used to bossing people around they can't conceive of the notion of a country standing up for its own rights to independence.
1325693964406677505 2020-11-09 14:57:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He had better not !
1325693568221110273 2020-11-09 14:55:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Guardian has some shred of common sense !
1325691431386832896 2020-11-09 14:47:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all ! You are using your best judgement!
1325691112674250754 2020-11-09 14:46:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is nothing like it was in March and April.
1325690881492602880 2020-11-09 14:45:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Olgachristie @pritipatel Where is the security ? Why can't they keep on top of this ? Why are there no navy patrols going up and down the Kent coast ?
1325690010235006976 2020-11-09 14:41:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not up to Biden. He has nor should he have any control over it !
1325688208630353920 2020-11-09 14:34:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well if Harry wanted to pay his respects he could have done it privately. Do they have to have their every move photographed?
1325687655330426880 2020-11-09 14:32:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope that Harry feels bad about all this. I hope she is worth it !
1325686357654724608 2020-11-09 14:27:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have always known that and they are just pushing their luck and at the last minute will concede something together a deal.
1325685828622966784 2020-11-09 14:25:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why should we ditch our prime minister just to please IRA Joe , ridiculous !
1325685410845089792 2020-11-09 14:23:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They look very alone !
1325684799923757057 2020-11-09 14:21:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1325683895161991173 2020-11-09 14:17:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> F ...... the lot of them particularly IRA Joe !
1325516921077379074 2020-11-09 03:13:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the man who failed twice to become president. Always the bridesmaid never the bride comes to mind 😋
1325515578841423873 2020-11-09 03:08:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤣🤣🤣
1325515043203637251 2020-11-09 03:06:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1325514784507392000 2020-11-09 03:05:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! Such an unpleasant smug woman 😫
1325513460386508800 2020-11-09 03:00:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they have a strong government who refuses to accept refugees. The Hungarians also refuse to accept refugees.
1325508781925609472 2020-11-09 02:41:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is hardly what is happening in Scotland. Lovely words and sentiments.
1325508335689457669 2020-11-09 02:39:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Okay Jeremy Vine, maybe you should maybe move to Scotland to be among the Sturgeon stasis!
1325507494622408705 2020-11-09 02:36:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1325506426542972928 2020-11-09 02:32:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It will all come out in the end!
1325503706989813762 2020-11-09 02:21:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Jane !😋
1325481520639987714 2020-11-09 00:53:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is not missed! Harry who?
1325480729577459723 2020-11-09 00:50:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He won’t be in the job for long. I would not feel too sorry for him!
1325478596379553798 2020-11-09 00:41:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1325477708973953025 2020-11-09 00:38:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think more than anything every thing this man says just confirms that he is not very bright.
1325476977160163331 2020-11-09 00:35:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!You want to avoid touching your face as much as possible!
1325473704567050246 2020-11-09 00:22:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And idiots !
1325456924394065920 2020-11-08 23:15:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true and incredibly sad!
1325455836932616195 2020-11-08 23:11:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s who they voted for apparently!
1325454789724037120 2020-11-08 23:07:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> ????
1325440348122918912 2020-11-08 22:09:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is reminiscent of the Stasis! What is Scotland turning into?
1325439856487575552 2020-11-08 22:07:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is absolutely beyond belief !
1325423758744702980 2020-11-08 21:03:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gorgeous !
1325423077539377155 2020-11-08 21:01:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totalitarian state in the making ! Wake up Scotland !
1325422399450476546 2020-11-08 20:58:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> God knows ?
1325421605087023105 2020-11-08 20:55:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😬😂😂
1325419380679847936 2020-11-08 20:46:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sulking because his wreath was rejected!
1325418422210064384 2020-11-08 20:42:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is the next stage for us turning into a military dictatorship !

1325329757752471556 2020-11-08 14:50:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope so !
1325329596926095360 2020-11-08 14:49:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks like Piers Morgan is securely lodged in Biden's fossilised arse !
1325328842635046913 2020-11-08 14:46:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Joe Biden after a month in office !  https://t.co/pGOfwJlk2K
1325327790267359234 2020-11-08 14:42:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Biden would make an ideal Davros if we ever got a proper Doctor Who back. He would not need any make up !
1325326428590714880 2020-11-08 14:36:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> America is going to go into a pseudo civil conflict. America is more divided than ever and I can't see the two sides reconciling !
1325326083898667013 2020-11-08 14:35:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a vile IRA sympathiser old creep !
1325324298928738307 2020-11-08 14:28:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She certainly would do a better job !
1325324086101364738 2020-11-08 14:27:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you Wendy !
1325323100033081344 2020-11-08 14:23:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but they are blatant and proud lefties. the whole vile bag of them !
1325322430957678593 2020-11-08 14:21:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is the end of them then !
1325322252720746499 2020-11-08 14:20:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is just a very silly and incompetent man !
1325321562694823936 2020-11-08 14:17:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't think Boris needs advice from yesterday's men like you !

1325115553992896517 2020-11-08 00:39:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Might well have been a blip  😋
1325115191332401154 2020-11-08 00:37:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> God knows!
1325114697394368514 2020-11-08 00:35:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So very sorry for you and your family.
1325095290328772608 2020-11-07 23:18:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are welcome! I forgot to mention there is going to be a Christmas special! Something to look forward to! Happy viewing!
1325092390009499649 2020-11-07 23:06:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Waitrose actually offers much better Chinese dishes! I have no shares in Waitrose. 😋
1325091697982894081 2020-11-07 23:04:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds vile !
1325090732336668674 2020-11-07 23:00:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Getting totally out of hand!
1325088105309876225 2020-11-07 22:49:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer’s is an empty vessel. He never says anything heartfelt or profound. He is Mr no personality!
1325086513147867138 2020-11-07 22:43:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant piece of satire! Welcome to the silly country!
1325086153696047109 2020-11-07 22:42:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂
1325085536890089474 2020-11-07 22:39:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> With respect to the intelligent Scots the average Scot seems to lose his/her head when it comes to this issue. “Flower of Scotland” reduces them to tears. Too much “Brave Heart” bullshit!
1325084369523011584 2020-11-07 22:35:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Patience it will come about!
1325084206561636354 2020-11-07 22:34:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nice label !
1325077091424100352 2020-11-07 22:06:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You don’t say!
1325072091570434051 2020-11-07 21:46:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So do I ! There is going to be a sequel to all creatures on channel 5. I recommend it . Timothy West is very good in it !
1325071495350071297 2020-11-07 21:43:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can't think why ?🙄🙄🙄
1325068695400558592 2020-11-07 21:32:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here speaks the voice of experience !😃
1325068521685049344 2020-11-07 21:32:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How could anyone congratulate that IRA sympathiser's hand I do not know !
1325068177278111744 2020-11-07 21:30:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! I presume it went down the pan as I stopped watching it when Clarkson left.
1325067761979043848 2020-11-07 21:29:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is !
1325067588251029504 2020-11-07 21:28:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is beyond shame but she will fall !
1325066966302908417 2020-11-07 21:25:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shove it where the sun don't shine Adolfina !
1325066628250394624 2020-11-07 21:24:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Channel 5 is taking this market over . Their "All creatures great and small" was very good. A rare treat !
1325065136399380480 2020-11-07 21:18:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And a phenomenal liar ! Your fall will come !
1325064606860136448 2020-11-07 21:16:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This plot is pie in the sky ! This is the last stages of panic !

1325060547608535040 2020-11-07 21:00:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I remember MPs marched in and forced to vote for this . It was said by a journalist that one day a price would be paid for this. Prophetic or what ?
1325059918265724931 2020-11-07 20:57:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Forget the BBC forever ! Watch Talking Pictures TV.

1324971498575171585 2020-11-07 15:06:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Biden is not in hiding he is back in the old people's home with a cup of cocoa and a blanket round his frail shoulders !
1324971164368834560 2020-11-07 15:05:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC shows no improvement under it new director if anything it is worse. Time the whole edifice was destroyed.
1324969869733990402 2020-11-07 15:00:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Children have not been taught our true history for. many years because it did not suit generations of leftie teachers and lecturers. The result is that they are totally ignorant and have been taught to despise their own culture. The French don't suffer from this problem.
1324968270722707456 2020-11-07 14:53:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sheer madness all around !

1324828631982592004 2020-11-07 05:38:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Few intelligent people are happy to do nothing for very long.
1324761947808665602 2020-11-07 01:13:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The real Lammy exposed!
1324761408714772481 2020-11-07 01:11:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolute joke ! Unbelievable hypocrites!
1324729644738818048 2020-11-06 23:05:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Right!😋
1324718819013775361 2020-11-06 22:22:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beyond scandalous !
1324717551063060486 2020-11-06 22:17:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She looks like a shoddy version of aunt Sally from Worzel Gummidge.
1324713867029684224 2020-11-06 22:02:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good one ! Mrs Abacus !😂
1324713510522265600 2020-11-06 22:01:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I loved the series! Very funny and moving !
1324706600997785602 2020-11-06 21:34:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are mocking the afflicted here 😋
1324705964864450560 2020-11-06 21:31:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not hold our breadth!😋
1324702137302077440 2020-11-06 21:16:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't think self analysis is her forte !
1324701301196922880 2020-11-06 21:12:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look Soubry, you may demand all you like but you are not getting it !
1324700848757366784 2020-11-06 21:11:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All I can say if the Police comes looking for public sympathy it won't be there !
1324700433454145536 2020-11-06 21:09:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What's DMS ?😉
1324699930036969473 2020-11-06 21:07:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You rude bugger !
1324699816434323458 2020-11-06 21:07:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unsurprisingly I have never seen anyone walk down the street dressed like this ! This was ,  the land of Beau Brummel , now it is the land of a random selection from an Oxfam shop!
1324699061706985472 2020-11-06 21:04:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I will miss you ! Hasta la vista baby ! How many years are you going down for ?😀
1324698662170222592 2020-11-06 21:02:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a case of the pot and the kettle ! Nippy is no politician just a rotten demagogue .
1324695620729344003 2020-11-06 20:50:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it matters . The point is you may not have symptoms but if you don't self isolate you might infect someones who could  in turn get zeros symptoms.
1324694230489583616 2020-11-06 20:44:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !
1324693804385972224 2020-11-06 20:43:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They haven't got a breadth to hold ! The latest wave of Biden supporters are veterans from the War of Independence. They are getting on ( so is Biden) a bit but they still can vote . Apparently Robert E Lee is now supporting the BLM.
1324672466296463360 2020-11-06 19:18:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This ragbag is neither big nor clever!
1324667792214364160 2020-11-06 18:59:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not cynical just sadly telling it as it is !
1324661225305870343 2020-11-06 18:33:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why do you think? She is a SNP MP!
1324632841058242560 2020-11-06 16:40:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😂😋
1324629674400632833 2020-11-06 16:28:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sweet and innocent days! No sexting then!
1324628903353327616 2020-11-06 16:25:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He will be a lame president !
1324628705315115008 2020-11-06 16:24:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shameful hussy! Sums up the SNP culture really! Birds of a feather ....

1324607228255604741 2020-11-06 14:59:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and it didn’t work for me as I got hurt.

1324598617005559808 2020-11-06 14:24:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! Some Muslims are either constantly angry or  offended ! FI or FO
1324424628434075648 2020-11-06 02:53:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is a menace !
1324420837261410304 2020-11-06 02:38:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well it is not working for him!
1324415335114694657 2020-11-06 02:16:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have loved all his books. The Bernie Gunther series is absolutely brilliant. He is sorely missed!
1324414717994164224 2020-11-06 02:14:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neither do I !
1324387323774197760 2020-11-06 00:25:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let it be a lesson to the wee cow. Can you imagine that last trip through Traitors ‘Gate!
1324385818794930176 2020-11-06 00:19:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is very dignified and indeed profitable crunchier crisps on TV! When is your next pathetically grateful arriving? My guess is never.

1324381316184461312 2020-11-06 00:01:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Biden got some particularly strong support from ex Civil War soldiers.
1324378746833506314 2020-11-05 23:51:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True ! People have a short attention span !

1324375161311776769 2020-11-05 23:36:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dictatorship !
1324374623836884994 2020-11-05 23:34:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Silence can be very meaningful 😋
1324361235656286210 2020-11-05 22:41:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂

1324337415142756353 2020-11-05 21:06:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I believe so !
1324335180539170816 2020-11-05 20:58:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It would have. been analysed to death !

1324243004929040387 2020-11-05 14:51:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you imagine what things would be like if Peter got to be leader ? The Scots must act now !
1324242458067304449 2020-11-05 14:49:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously not ! This is a tin pot third world system !

1324005386429452288 2020-11-04 23:07:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or people do not answer honestly when asked who they are going to vote for. Some say one thing and then do another.
1324003791759396865 2020-11-04 23:01:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well it won’t!

1323984486267293697 2020-11-04 21:44:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer has forgotten his vow to not play party politics during theorises. His pledge did not last long. A very crass self serving idiot !

1323959917796012034 2020-11-04 20:06:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Disgusting! Where is the justice?
1323910135593447424 2020-11-04 16:49:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1323903111254167552 2020-11-04 16:21:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And so convoluted! The money wasted !
1323902225282932738 2020-11-04 16:17:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Time they changed their ways !

1323899678161805312 2020-11-04 16:07:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Too few to mention!
1323892344295428096 2020-11-04 15:38:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! She is a nobody! I hope she never sets foot here again!

1323889953068195841 2020-11-04 15:28:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He would last no more than a month in the White House!

1323885793786605568 2020-11-04 15:12:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why so much talk about such a mediocre person!

1323878803748327430 2020-11-04 14:44:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All Femi is good at is trying to be as offensive as possible. Femi talks out of his trumpet !

1323871919196852225 2020-11-04 14:17:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A bit of a U turn Femi !
1323870653787840512 2020-11-04 14:12:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This again exposes the media as agenda led fantasists who refuse to admit the opinions of ordinary people.

1323656174479249412 2020-11-03 23:59:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In a pandemic this is the only thing to do! There is such a thing as social distancing !
1323614805052280832 2020-11-03 21:15:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They can wipe their arses with their petition ! The remainosaurs will be shortly evolving into the rejoinosaurs .
1323614451216646145 2020-11-03 21:14:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are obviously cells of these terrorists organisations in every European countries. Who know what reinforcement they are getting from across the channel.

1323610112200740864 2020-11-03 20:56:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the last gasp of the EU maffiosi before they drip in to the cesspit of history!
1323609777512026115 2020-11-03 20:55:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Couldn't disagree with that !

1323530150810656768 2020-11-03 15:39:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are like ostriches hiding their heads in the sand and hoping for the best!At least Macron is making a stand!
1323523036667138048 2020-11-03 15:10:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes sadly so! Vive la France!
1323520163975778305 2020-11-03 14:59:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! Of course Macron is thinking of the presidential elections next May but I also think he is sincere in his stand!

1323515198368612357 2020-11-03 14:39:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes slightly repulsive!

1323511289386311681 2020-11-03 14:24:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not solely about numbers but about the quality of your followers and the rapport you have with some of them.

1323509343086694400 2020-11-03 14:16:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are expected to pander to them even if they resent us !
1323508953788153862 2020-11-03 14:14:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are you leaving ! Don't want you to ! Will miss my northern mate !

1323346222825033730 2020-11-03 03:28:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A very dull one!
1323346029635424258 2020-11-03 03:27:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! It is not that hard to understand.
1323345601099141122 2020-11-03 03:25:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1323312129072635905 2020-11-03 01:12:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True but he has had his time!

1323305007635193856 2020-11-03 00:44:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who would want them? Not us that’s for sure!
1323304265713143810 2020-11-03 00:41:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋

1323300759266643968 2020-11-03 00:27:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How many are endorsing lair. The Labour Party would not have him back.
1323300110688751626 2020-11-03 00:25:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or invincible vaccines?🙈
1323299211983683585 2020-11-03 00:21:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes everyone outside Scotland can see it would be a disaster for Great Britain and Scotland if it became independent. The problem is a lot of Scots don’t or won’t see it.
1323284795431047170 2020-11-02 23:24:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !

1323283134184652801 2020-11-02 23:17:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Australians did the same in March !
1323282988835229699 2020-11-02 23:17:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A complete mystery !
1323281109468303360 2020-11-02 23:09:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What's the difference with us Mr Piers Morgan ?
1323279313916043268 2020-11-02 23:02:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Little did you know !
1323279185603895297 2020-11-02 23:01:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I couldn't put it better than myself !
1323278713556029440 2020-11-02 23:00:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The much talked up admired by some Germans have given up on track and trace.
1323277283189116928 2020-11-02 22:54:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Do you really think that a lot of the Scots will want to vote for the current Labour Party and very unlikely to vote  for the Conversatives. Who else are they going to vote for ? It is not that clear cut .
1323276655973044227 2020-11-02 22:51:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Polls !

1323247478037164032 2020-11-02 20:55:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious !
1323247271241240576 2020-11-02 20:55:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is !
1323246848417681408 2020-11-02 20:53:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's a good one !
1323246569060245511 2020-11-02 20:52:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well done !
1323246312037515265 2020-11-02 20:51:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Picture postcard or chocolate box !
1323244922242293761 2020-11-02 20:45:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid you cannot say that they are a minority because the polls state otherwise !
1323244227002736640 2020-11-02 20:43:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I share your sentiments Paul but you are preaching to the converted ! It's the SNP you have to convince !
1323223463482531847 2020-11-02 19:20:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we can ! Hopefully they will give us a break just before Christmas.
1323202771974266880 2020-11-02 17:58:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Paul the whole point of the SNP is hatred of the England invaders. There has always been a certain amount of resentment but for the last few years the SNP has gained a lot of ground because they appeal to a lot of Scots.
1323176320382181376 2020-11-02 16:13:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for you !
1323173116210794496 2020-11-02 16:00:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Knowing her she problems does! She hates the English but is happy to grab the money from Westminster.
1323172755899035648 2020-11-02 15:59:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1323161274549784578 2020-11-02 15:13:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True ! She is a cancer that needs to be destroyed.
1323159962202349568 2020-11-02 15:08:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think so Joe. She has way too much support! George Galloway is found his best to unite the opposition parties but ....
1323159406519980040 2020-11-02 15:06:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Suspicious!🤨
1323158298636541952 2020-11-02 15:01:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Next May there will be elections in Scotland.
1323157759114792962 2020-11-02 14:59:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good one !😀
1323157376925683712 2020-11-02 14:57:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't know Joe . I just don't get it !
1323156911831863297 2020-11-02 14:56:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes absolutely as it is treason against the State.
1323156780201971716 2020-11-02 14:55:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Could be . He was at death's door step let us remember so he knows the full horror of the virus.
1323156482347704320 2020-11-02 14:54:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What I can't get my head round is why has she gained so much support in the last few years . Do the Scots hate the English so much ?
1323155855353761795 2020-11-02 14:51:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I live in South East London and very happy to do so . I do feel for the Scots.
1323155658540199936 2020-11-02 14:51:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What most upsets me is the utter shameless and selfish greed been demonstrated. Together we must stand !
1323155177713655809 2020-11-02 14:49:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Joe we have to stick with him because there is. no genuine alternative now . You have to concede that point.
1323154938269208586 2020-11-02 14:48:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is sadly true !
1323154363993493505 2020-11-02 14:45:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true ! Unfortunately there are too many of us now and what happened to home visits .
1323153994395586561 2020-11-02 14:44:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just stupid French arrogance !
1323153728850067457 2020-11-02 14:43:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good point ! There are very few real Conservatives because the educational system is against it and has been for many years.
1323153336762327040 2020-11-02 14:41:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Joe you would not like it if you were under her control, the wee shite who is off her head !
1323153085187895296 2020-11-02 14:40:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is partly due to the fact that the circles they move in it is not acceptable to admit anything positive about this country . Also we are supposed to be ashamed of our colonial past and anyone among them who disagrees is shouted down.
1323152464468725760 2020-11-02 14:38:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think she has been there for a while. Talk about been pissed with power the little shite !
1323152122897223680 2020-11-02 14:37:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said and you are not helping in a time of national crisis.
1323151774434414592 2020-11-02 14:35:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am trying to say that even if Boris wanted to he could not do it . The upheaval would be immense.
1323150790488371201 2020-11-02 14:31:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Below 5
1323150490243399683 2020-11-02 14:30:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon has lost the plot ! You cannot have consulates if you are not even a country whether she adores the EU or not.
1323149731258867712 2020-11-02 14:27:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Boris cannot just force the removal of devolutions. Don't think that all Conservative MPS would vote for it and secondly can you imagine the uproar in Scotland, Wales and N Ireland. This is a fantasy ! Boris would be a labeled a dictator , a colonialist, a Nazy.
1323147045025288193 2020-11-02 14:16:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks !

1322942738464165889 2020-11-02 00:45:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The media is relentlessly dishing out daily miseries never offering positive news.

1322887797829718018 2020-11-01 21:06:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Excuse me ! Have you just forgotten one tiny detail ? Have you heard of the Chinese virus ? Think about it !

1322883673058729984 2020-11-01 20:50:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wonder if Mr Starmer who tried to pretend he was working class somehow really cares about all these workers.
1322883256853925890 2020-11-01 20:48:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Excuse me ! The Keir Starmer I have seen and heard sounds like a total plank. I am concerned however that you may not be able to extricate yourself from his rectum.

1322848858741899264 2020-11-01 18:31:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙈🙈🙈🙈
1322846253328277505 2020-11-01 18:21:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t shit yourself on the way!💩💩💩
1322845707838128129 2020-11-01 18:19:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are running out of reputable people wanting to appear on the BBC
1322836354032689162 2020-11-01 17:42:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1322836109668323328 2020-11-01 17:41:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bloody selfish idiots! Mindless behaviour
1322832361927725058 2020-11-01 17:26:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he is intensely disliked in many Labour quarters. Some very good Labour MPs lost their jobs in December and not a word of apology from the outdated old fool!
1322816940671467520 2020-11-01 16:25:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid we will never know at this stage.
1322816648345255936 2020-11-01 16:24:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scary !🎃🎃🎃
1322816484779974657 2020-11-01 16:23:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you will find that from now on every presenter and guest will be wearing a poppy.
1322815860923375616 2020-11-01 16:20:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You sound like a very bad wolf!😳
1322815685043650560 2020-11-01 16:20:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Only partly because of Le Pen. Most French people truly believe in the Republic and I don’t think he is been insincere when he speaks out against truly atrocious acts. I doubt Boris would be as brave !
1322814423539408896 2020-11-01 16:15:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a pretty pert nose 😋
1322813495902089218 2020-11-01 16:11:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Give it up love! He is a lost cause! Let him go back to his allotment full time!
1322808399898304512 2020-11-01 15:51:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @GeorgeMag3 I agree that the pay rise was a disgrace!
1322807730256506881 2020-11-01 15:48:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1322807004050657280 2020-11-01 15:45:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @GeorgeMag3 Don’t forget the virus in all this! Maybe China should take some of the blame!
1322802412214800384 2020-11-01 15:27:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @GeoffNorcott True !
1322801456764911616 2020-11-01 15:23:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question ! They must have been surplus to requirement.
1322801084881080325 2020-11-01 15:22:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not one bit ! Barbarism is what it is !
1322800920632168448 2020-11-01 15:21:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What's new Bernie ! We have a very selective media !
1322800726872121344 2020-11-01 15:20:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you darling !
1322800657070522368 2020-11-01 15:20:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shame on you Gary ! Absolute rubbish !
1322800329595985920 2020-11-01 15:19:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too sweetie ! Have another shower and don't forget the after shave !
1322800082480222209 2020-11-01 15:18:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely ! Despicable woman. I think Uganda beckons !
1322799341803839489 2020-11-01 15:15:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes criticism but not just name calling ! If anyone can come up with it !
1322799063109193729 2020-11-01 15:14:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said. The people who are calling for Boris to resign would almost certainly not be able to do the job. You never hear much in way of constructive suggestions for the simple reasons they don't exist. The nation must stick together!
1322798308927164416 2020-11-01 15:11:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course they are ! Last minute flings ! Pathetic , the same old story!
1322797675511689217 2020-11-01 15:08:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Connor ! Spot on ! Let us not make Boris the scapegoat !
1322797473463705601 2020-11-01 15:07:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer does not want a civil war . A divided party never wins favour with the public . They can all thank Milliband for all this . He brought Corbyn and Momentum to the party and it has been a disaster.
1322796789603405824 2020-11-01 15:05:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are the pits ! I saw this idiot from Hackney ranting away and repeating himself on the BBC News last night.
1322796467904458754 2020-11-01 15:03:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Macron has done a lot more than any other western government. He has closed mosques and put troops on the streets.
1322795450353799173 2020-11-01 14:59:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There must be a shortage of talent among the Labour ranks. Anyone who was any good was de selected or bullied out !
1322795198884257799 2020-11-01 14:58:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The smug bastard Morgan gets paid whatever happens ! He can pontificate all day long at leisure . He is the number one shit stirring pillock !
1322794720934940672 2020-11-01 14:56:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A bit premature Old Goat ! Give it another two years!
1322794526327640065 2020-11-01 14:56:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rayner should retire from Politics. She is not up to the job. She has the intellect of a beetle on the other hand this is unfair too beetles.
1322794056360087555 2020-11-01 14:54:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is just to give a few days notice to businesses .
1322793874713153536 2020-11-01 14:53:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie ! Maybe we should have to gone to Istanbul Kitchen after all !
1322793364979355650 2020-11-01 14:51:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Macron is taking a moral stand and defending the values of the Republic.  France is supposed to be the land of freedom an equality ! I know these are ideals but worth pursuing and should not be damaged by invading barbarians.
1322792434917691392 2020-11-01 14:47:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for your kind comments.
1322790626405081097 2020-11-01 14:40:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Need you ask ?
1322790351866859525 2020-11-01 14:39:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is 1984 ! The nightmare begins ... Khan would probably love to do the same in London if he could get away with it !
1322789862198681601 2020-11-01 14:37:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @HotelLubyanka @Crosscolin88 Thankfully no one !
1322789474372329473 2020-11-01 14:36:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well Nigel what do you suggest he does ? any constructive suggestions?
1322789076735533057 2020-11-01 14:34:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sympathise with your feelings but let us remember we are not the only country suffering and with severe problems. France has troops on the streets, the Italians are having mass demonstrations against lockdown, Belgium is in a terrible state and of course so is Spain.
1322629526917206017 2020-11-01 04:00:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly I think you are right!
1322625051338952704 2020-11-01 03:42:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cuties !
1322581513725247489 2020-11-01 00:49:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s the spirit!
1322569230378799104 2020-11-01 00:00:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I agree with your description of them but why are the Scots still voting for the SNP in great numbers.? I understand Labour left a great vacuum but still
1322552885545193474 2020-10-31 22:55:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I agree! They are poisonous bullies!
1322545210258300932 2020-10-31 22:25:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have to stop pandering to people who have no intention of obeying our laws, showing respect to the host country and amending their ways.
1322542668501704705 2020-10-31 22:15:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why should be tolerant of such a mindless vile cult ? They have been pandered to for far too long .
1322541960029179906 2020-10-31 22:12:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1322541714318499840 2020-10-31 22:11:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👋👋👋👋
1322540406576467970 2020-10-31 22:06:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It will definitely brushed under the carpet and not put on any agenda.
1322539885308354560 2020-10-31 22:04:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Considering he wasn't much of a patriot and much preferred living in Southern Spain than in his homeland!
1322539424425660417 2020-10-31 22:02:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is what most of us thinks and naturally it makes our blood boil !
1322539046900563968 2020-10-31 22:00:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And who is that going to be ?
1322538616128704512 2020-10-31 21:59:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> From what I understand Connery loved his homeland so much he never wanted to live there.
1322537430130528258 2020-10-31 21:54:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not very well Kirstie ! I hope the Muslims go into lockdown too ! That would be a plus !
1322535249100840961 2020-10-31 21:45:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The grievance is with the English . They don't like us and  never did. Increasingly the English do not like them.
1322534637554585601 2020-10-31 21:43:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are going to be running out of toilet paper again !
1322533881862639618 2020-10-31 21:40:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she is ! Thanks for that Sue !
1322533551259176960 2020-10-31 21:39:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dawn Butler judging by your recent antics you know of the British spirit.
1322533022315532288 2020-10-31 21:36:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Westminster will keep pandering to them and are not going to stop .
1322532059592773632 2020-10-31 21:33:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately you cannot put devolution back in the box !
1322531708672106496 2020-10-31 21:31:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Old man Steptoe had more charm and personality than Jeremy !
1322531363820605440 2020-10-31 21:30:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Get on dealing with your Lazy party Starmer ! You have enough on your hands.
1322530935045324800 2020-10-31 21:28:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Anshul__K No you are not ! you are in the right !
1322530738290499585 2020-10-31 21:27:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Muslims can shout and bowl in the street but the Royal Family cannot sing the national anthem! The country ruled by fucking idiots !
1322529141166661632 2020-10-31 21:21:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Carry on but you will have the Royal Navy to answer to ! See how you get on with that !
1322495212724387845 2020-10-31 19:06:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have done so!
1322488983151063040 2020-10-31 18:41:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Congratulations!👏
1322488908773470210 2020-10-31 18:41:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell your Muslim friends Khan!
1322488633903980544 2020-10-31 18:40:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our mayor has been strangely silent about the horrific attacks in France and about the antisemitism  within the Labour Party. I hope the Jewish and Christian do not vote for this creep next year.
1322487621025714177 2020-10-31 18:36:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it doesn’t! Imagine if a Christian had run amock in a mosque we would never hear the end of this!
1322487063732723715 2020-10-31 18:34:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shame on you and on Boris for his silence! Mrs Thatcher would not have allowed this demonstration yesterday. All our previous Prime Ministers have all been weak in this respect.
1322450180768223232 2020-10-31 16:07:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😂😋
1322449856129048576 2020-10-31 16:06:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Professor!

1322434510617796609 2020-10-31 15:05:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merkel have a word with your chum Macron !
1322433321406812162 2020-10-31 15:00:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly. Unfortunately quite a few Scots seem to feel like her.
1322432920397717505 2020-10-31 14:59:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1322432464061669376 2020-10-31 14:57:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So we can be confident that there will be no more : "Fuck off English" or are we the exception ?
1322430455845707776 2020-10-31 14:49:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @LeslieH24367191 Cheapskate !
1322430056740827136 2020-10-31 14:47:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why not ?
1322429808719089664 2020-10-31 14:46:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SocialM85897394 The French Muslim leaders have unequivocally done so Burt not the British ones ! Shame on their houses !
1322429054163832837 2020-10-31 14:43:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a gross insult to our culture.
1322428548217450499 2020-10-31 14:41:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is only a matter of time before there is a black Henry the 8th and a black Queen Victoria.
1322427935199027201 2020-10-31 14:39:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @dack_charlie @SkyNews He is the only man I know who gets more hair every year. There are horses losing their tails!
1322427125341822976 2020-10-31 14:36:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a proper journalist unlike the ragbags of sorry  creatures they have now ! Jug ears Marr look and learn !
1322426803370233856 2020-10-31 14:34:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Listen to this ! Great broadcast !
1322426084734967809 2020-10-31 14:32:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The tactic is not to intervene unless they start vandalising or attacking passers by .
1322424679882235904 2020-10-31 14:26:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Has the Arbishop of Canterbury expressed his condemnation of the atrocities perpetrated in France?
1322423488121081856 2020-10-31 14:21:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The sooner we stop offending Muslims the better. The rules should apply for all. Where was the riot police in Knighsbride?
1322422859222994944 2020-10-31 14:19:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But will you admit no !
1322422398478700544 2020-10-31 14:17:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we must stand with Macron ! Vive la France !
1322421387508830208 2020-10-31 14:13:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True Kevin !
1322248321302450183 2020-10-31 02:45:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The politicians are just looking the other way hoping for the best.
1322247934059171843 2020-10-31 02:44:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know Margaret. It is like we are living in a parallel world where nothing makes sense anymore. The media is the enemy, trying to scare us, and been very sparing with the truth . And politicians well, what can you say?🤨
1322246546671476737 2020-10-31 02:38:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes if only. 😥
1322245566206717952 2020-10-31 02:34:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Things cannot carry on like this! People are just getting angrier and standards are slipping. This pandemic is creating havoc and it is like been left at sea without a rudder.
1322232710874746880 2020-10-31 01:43:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! It is a war cry! It is a fight against an invaders.
1322232342455504901 2020-10-31 01:42:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It shows the dismal level of her intellect. As for Harry he may well be in a state of enforced stupidity. More fool him!
1322227028310065158 2020-10-31 01:21:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is the gift that keeps giving!😋
1322226480970141696 2020-10-31 01:18:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They have no respect for anyone who is not of their faith. We are the infidels!
1322217073246875649 2020-10-31 00:41:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Mark, Nazis of the world unite !
1322216862449651712 2020-10-31 00:40:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Western world is becoming a multi cultural toilet thanks to the liberal do gooders ! Time to wake up !
1322216236609056768 2020-10-31 00:38:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question !
1322201332959334400 2020-10-30 23:38:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The turks have always been very aggressive to their neighbouring countries and do not belong to the civilised world.
1322200374049165312 2020-10-30 23:35:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's the logic of the madhouse  but then mother Scotland knows all about madness.
1322200136651595777 2020-10-30 23:34:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are the Imams and muslim religious not condemning outright the horrific happenings in France ? Are they afraid of their own congregations?
1322199680206409728 2020-10-30 23:32:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is too much of this . Sickening.

1322153993376878592 2020-10-30 20:30:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True, you are right!
1322139599985086465 2020-10-30 19:33:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly true! Where are the likes of Robin Cook, Frank Field, Denis Skinner and Ian Duncan Smith!
1322134919913590785 2020-10-30 19:15:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so !
1322134565457154048 2020-10-30 19:13:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You would think so! These so called phobias are a modern phenomenon of excuse.
1322134051239694336 2020-10-30 19:11:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂

1322132704893247489 2020-10-30 19:06:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Margaret! Starmer’s kept quiet for years because of his personal ambitions. I am sure he detested   Corbin but he played the game and apparently win!
1322131486208937985 2020-10-30 19:01:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The sooner the BBC is flushed down the sewer of no regrets the better!
1322130036938461184 2020-10-30 18:55:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It happened once in New Zealand last year but I can’t think of another case.
1322129535584948224 2020-10-30 18:53:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great answer Keith!👏👏
1322129153752268800 2020-10-30 18:52:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course the mayor is right in saying that the attack was an Islamist attack.
1322128630751858688 2020-10-30 18:50:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps he couldn’t stand it more than one night listening to this handwringing pillock!
1322128159597305856 2020-10-30 18:48:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Excuse me it wasn’t the Establishment it was the general public. Get your facts right!
1322127800376152065 2020-10-30 18:46:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Adonis is the imbecile who wanted the statue of Oliver Cromwell so I wouldn’t take much notice of him.

1322064436195172353 2020-10-30 14:34:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question ! It is about time the Police was frightened of us rather than the Muslims.
1321895884251168769 2020-10-30 03:25:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Vive la 🇫🇷!

1321887270752919553 2020-10-30 02:50:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure it is fake! The whole Gary Lineker episode is farcical.

1321868584616923139 2020-10-30 01:36:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am hoping the Labour Party falls in half. On reflection there might not be enough anti corbynists to make half.
1321868194387251202 2020-10-30 01:35:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She should go! One of the most annoying woman ever! So self righteous!

1321855118917120002 2020-10-30 00:43:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes specially lately! Maybe it takes one to know one.
1321854929720496128 2020-10-30 00:42:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No one trusts Starmer!He is not a man of principles.
1321852896707825665 2020-10-30 00:34:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer’s did not want to rock the boat and was biding his time. He is not an honourable man just an ambitious one.
1321852286986051585 2020-10-30 00:31:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is scum but does not realise that he is!😳
1321851886694260737 2020-10-30 00:30:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Too many to mention! What a farce!

1321850381979308035 2020-10-30 00:24:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a loser but I consider him a dangerous and divisive man. He is no sweet little man. Let us see if he gets reinstated.
1321848907618521088 2020-10-30 00:18:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Corbin was never keen on the EU and secretly was pro Brexit but he toed the party line which was pro EU.
1321848326891933697 2020-10-30 00:16:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Are we supposed to tolerate murderous nut cases. Of course not all Muslims are like this but they don’t seem to want to criticise their crazy fellow Muslims.
1321846222269882368 2020-10-30 00:07:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We would love to see this sanctimonious woman taken down a peg or two.
1321845414690279425 2020-10-30 00:04:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he did and let us not forget the Palestinian leaders.
1321843245962403840 2020-10-29 23:56:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer’s is a man for all seasons!

1321805320805666816 2020-10-29 21:25:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It makes sense because people are avoiding others more, and constantly washing their hands and not touching their face.
1321804944496824325 2020-10-29 21:23:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @AdrianCroome Talk about blatant racial hatred !
1321804282316947456 2020-10-29 21:21:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I guess I got that one wrong !🙄🙄
1321803970415861761 2020-10-29 21:19:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Take care Nikki !
1321801467838214144 2020-10-29 21:10:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is and Scots have to wake up to the fact that they are becoming a police state. This is like Nazy Germany in the 30's . Create fear and division to better control.
1321801009140797440 2020-10-29 21:08:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No no one is going to sack Corbyn least. of all Starmer.that He does not want to start a civil war within his party.
1321799638408699904 2020-10-29 21:02:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know !🙉🤨
1321799253568692227 2020-10-29 21:01:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1321797690557112323 2020-10-29 20:55:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer won't do either of these things and we all know it!
1321797311094206464 2020-10-29 20:53:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You might well be right!😀
1321796620837670912 2020-10-29 20:50:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good decision Boris !
1321796445444448256 2020-10-29 20:50:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And they never will be . Some muslims are still living in the 15th century . They are medieval in their outlook and thinking, absolutely incompatible with the modern world.
1321795750976737281 2020-10-29 20:47:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Terrifying and so blind !
1321795525251862528 2020-10-29 20:46:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! We are all infidels according to some muslims,
1321787513011318785 2020-10-29 20:14:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he is . He is a man for all seasons!
1321781785081110529 2020-10-29 19:51:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The theatre of the Absurd. Why are some celebrities so vacuous!
1321775798190252035 2020-10-29 19:28:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Politicians who try to please everyone end up in real trouble.
1321773854633697281 2020-10-29 19:20:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Michael54651297 Make your own judgement. Considering he married into a Jewish family, the forensic QC has no defence!
1321725696796991488 2020-10-29 16:08:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Vive la 🇫🇷!

1321712851401297925 2020-10-29 15:17:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! I Democratic or what ! Quite a vile mouthpiece really!
1321711493478567937 2020-10-29 15:12:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anna Soubry a year ago was herself extremely angry and divisive and is now in the political wildernesses.
1321708224517734402 2020-10-29 14:59:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is the head of the new Scottish thought police ! 1984 is coming !
1321707851551748096 2020-10-29 14:58:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Vielen danken Frau Merkel ! Dummkopf !
1321706946710458368 2020-10-29 14:54:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We know why . Most politicians are scared of muslims. There comes a time however when this will have to change and it won't be pleasant.
1321706463044186112 2020-10-29 14:52:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question !
1321705324731129858 2020-10-29 14:48:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well done Marseille ! Vive la France !
1321702034857447427 2020-10-29 14:34:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too ! It does have certain after effects !😂
1321701681101418496 2020-10-29 14:33:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> and free speech would be a good idea too !
1321700933605220352 2020-10-29 14:30:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I totally agree with you !
1321700381357969408 2020-10-29 14:28:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @DocsControl Gary will have his own self serving version of the truth. Where are all his guests?
1321700027564249088 2020-10-29 14:26:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question ! Most people will be happy with this but of course there will be the usual candidates wringing their hands and whining about racism. How predictable.
1321699459122761728 2020-10-29 14:24:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it shows that for once a useless self promoting bastard has been refused . He is a nasty piece of work whatever colour he is .
1321699203568046082 2020-10-29 14:23:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And we are importing more every day !
1321698738834997248 2020-10-29 14:21:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not the disease but the so called remedies !
1321698354548584448 2020-10-29 14:20:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly they all do ! The media want people like this . They don't want fair minded journalists like used to exist.
1321696850366341120 2020-10-29 14:14:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SocialM85897394 Let us hope this includes insults against the English @
1321696634523234304 2020-10-29 14:13:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Boris shows sense refusing this posturing idiot any honours. He is no Stirling Moss !
1321524173781553152 2020-10-29 02:48:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a price idiot!🙈🙈🙈
1321523872827584516 2020-10-29 02:46:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is disgraceful !😡😡
1321504512918638592 2020-10-29 01:30:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Anna Soubry you were very divisive in a very loud way! I assume this is a public apology!
1321500400135143424 2020-10-29 01:13:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds like a very good plan!
1321497362578264066 2020-10-29 01:01:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are right!
1321494148940238853 2020-10-29 00:48:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What’s wrong with U turns? If Labour made a U turn it was called a change of direction.
1321493450211102720 2020-10-29 00:46:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is just an ignorant big mouth, a minor celebrity but no philosopher that’s for sure!😋
1321484664398336002 2020-10-29 00:11:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! When in Rome ..
1321482742643806208 2020-10-29 00:03:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Her chips are very good too!😌😌
1321480659995709446 2020-10-28 23:55:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BLM will never grow in this country. It is an American export and alien to this country.
1321475399826722822 2020-10-28 23:34:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know!😡
1321466002635370497 2020-10-28 22:57:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I live in South East London and not a starving child in sight! We are not living in Dickens time thankfully.
1321463751980318720 2020-10-28 22:48:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1321462611662221312 2020-10-28 22:43:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Scary!🤨
1321457508293201928 2020-10-28 22:23:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am slow !😳😳
1321457220786266112 2020-10-28 22:22:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know you are . Just didn’t get the Lucozade reference. All I know it tastes vile!😫😫
1321451611240226817 2020-10-28 21:59:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should hope not !
1321446366023950338 2020-10-28 21:38:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This woman has been promoted way beyond her capabilities and is now a toxic shit stirring mouth piece.
1321445614668943363 2020-10-28 21:36:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When will they learn ? maybe never !
1321438314185035776 2020-10-28 21:06:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shameful ! Vive la France ! Vive Macron !
1321436904093601795 2020-10-28 21:01:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who's not well darling ? you ?
1321436603185799168 2020-10-28 21:00:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for you !
1321436208204075008 2020-10-28 20:58:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It gives you energy right ! Like instant glucose .
1321429530565877766 2020-10-28 20:32:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shameless!😂
1321429144564080640 2020-10-28 20:30:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What’s that? A crusader?
1321357605424533504 2020-10-28 15:46:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite a big corner but yet it is changing. We don’t want our capital city to end up a multicultural shit heap.
1321350981095956486 2020-10-28 15:19:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s relentless!🤨
1321346933089325058 2020-10-28 15:03:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very much doubt it ! I can't wait to see the black elves !
1321346643200016384 2020-10-28 15:02:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So vile hate speech by an ethnic is perfectly acceptable to the snowflakes who are so easily offended by other things.
1321345830192844802 2020-10-28 14:59:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So stop and search is working !
1321345564416552960 2020-10-28 14:58:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Free speech is dead in Cambridge and probably every other university ! These students are the pampered plastic bubble generation who mindlessly follow the same indoctrination with no individual thought allowed !
1321344611214831616 2020-10-28 14:54:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on Pat !
1321343874581864448 2020-10-28 14:51:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That says it all !
1321342882851205121 2020-10-28 14:47:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More stupid lies ! The malevolent midget is not fooling anyone !
1321342619650347010 2020-10-28 14:46:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @abline11 The BBC is institutionally racist. Where are all the black people to be seen in their programs.
1321341776322592768 2020-10-28 14:43:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have you not seen photos of these people ? It's like the  cast of Wallace and Gromit film , specially the Oxford woman.
1321341041329508352 2020-10-28 14:40:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well sais Terry ! Sick and tired of this migrant issue and all the fake concern and outrage.
1321340760499884032 2020-10-28 14:39:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why don't we just let everyone in the world come here? Is that what you are proposing ?
1321340317627539462 2020-10-28 14:37:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have just noticed that for some reason you don't seem very keen on Boris ! Surely it is nothing personal !
1321339521263390720 2020-10-28 14:34:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never mind all. this ! What have you got to say about the beheading in Paris ?
1321338672483098624 2020-10-28 14:31:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The sooner the better ! Denmark has ! Ban it. now!
1321337789020078080 2020-10-28 14:27:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What this spineless know all really means you should think the same as me that is not going to happen ! Just to think this sad specimen was once a British Army officer!A disgrace to the Nation and we don't want to see him back here again. Another Edward the 8th !
1321173849036201989 2020-10-28 03:36:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope not Paul!😋
1321169315262070791 2020-10-28 03:18:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree it is a disgrace! His ratings are high on GMB and that’s all that matters!
1321169054137257986 2020-10-28 03:17:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Two only !🤣🤣
1321168955420119052 2020-10-28 03:16:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! He is self seeking and self promoting.

1321167751399002112 2020-10-28 03:11:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no accounting for taste! Maybe it’s his triple chins some women find attractive! 🤣🤣
1321167117371269130 2020-10-28 03:09:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly it could be !
1321166935451717632 2020-10-28 03:08:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What I don’t understand is why he is so popular.
1321165157414981635 2020-10-28 03:01:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a narcissistic and extremely nastily vindictive towards anyone who crosses him. Nasty piece of work.

1321075526698717185 2020-10-27 21:05:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC will never criticise a Muslim, simple as that !
1321074686688698368 2020-10-27 21:02:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is she not arrested for hate crime ? or does it only apply to whites ?
1321072139496292354 2020-10-27 20:51:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All I know is that they won't succeed in that they will just set back any progress made in race relations in America. America is a bit of a shit heap .
1321070177002442753 2020-10-27 20:44:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on Paul!
1321069294529224704 2020-10-27 20:40:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s an insult to snakes!
1321065643496640513 2020-10-27 20:26:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan  currently on BBC radio 2. He has been extremely critical of the BBC for a long time but as he is trying to flog a book his attitude seems to have radically changed. Hypocritical or what?
1321064523391008769 2020-10-27 20:21:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! The tides are changing, partly due to the EU’s response to the pandemic which was quite disgraceful particularly the lack of help Italy hot and let us not forget the Brexit impact.
1321056251351048192 2020-10-27 19:48:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we all know the answer to that one!😋
1321045804862361601 2020-10-27 19:07:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is doing a great job and that is all that matters!
1321045012579291137 2020-10-27 19:04:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most definitely not! That would just be too ridiculous !
1321019753863983104 2020-10-27 17:23:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1321013466312986626 2020-10-27 16:58:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s what I like about you Pat, you don’t beat around the bush 😋
1320998746570764288 2020-10-27 16:00:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1320992727438340099 2020-10-27 15:36:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good!

1320983399989944320 2020-10-27 14:59:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are right !
1320982713172709376 2020-10-27 14:56:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> One of the many inconvenient news item the BBC won't want to know about . There are so many .......
1320981940665802752 2020-10-27 14:53:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well it would because their views is not the same as yours. We know you of course know best you supercilious pillock !
1320979723342827520 2020-10-27 14:44:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Marcus you are not quite the saint some portray you as !Virtuous ?🤨🤨🤨
1320978390090919937 2020-10-27 14:39:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The House of Lords is full of Liberals whilst the Liberal party hardly exists. How democratic is this !
1320978072414396417 2020-10-27 14:38:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @jjcwow The House of Lords is stupidly full of Liberals even though the actual party hardly exists ! how democratic is this !
1320976071341334529 2020-10-27 14:30:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> First thing to do is to scrap this stupid hate crime bill.
1320975710136270849 2020-10-27 14:28:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I give you one guess! These are posturing idiots.
1320837476781596675 2020-10-27 05:19:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Vive  la France!
1320813171452641281 2020-10-27 03:42:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> An irresistible invitation 😌😌😌
1320806995344171008 2020-10-27 03:18:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😝😝😝
1320772365547130880 2020-10-27 01:00:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I cannot help but think that a BLM candidate will be in grave danger of losing their deposit.

1320748535306981379 2020-10-26 23:26:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Endless demands!🙈🙈
1320743481380405248 2020-10-26 23:05:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A good crisis to exploit and magnify as much as you can !
1320740972003819520 2020-10-26 22:56:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am forced to agree, this is an accurate description
1320738423645347843 2020-10-26 22:45:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Piers, but you can't help be ridiculous and spiteful !
1320737598411866117 2020-10-26 22:42:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A remainersaur bellowing from its prehistoric swamp of mediocrity !
1320735778729791489 2020-10-26 22:35:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @sylviamcc123 To thy own self be true !
1320717426431037444 2020-10-26 21:22:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The senior police officers are all the same type of liberal  posturers. This needs to change. Under the current selection system this will never change.
1320715860793794560 2020-10-26 21:16:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> John , I think a lot of people in England understand exactly what is going on in Scotland but they have had so much anti English abuse from the SNP followers that we are no longer interested.
1320714841535975424 2020-10-26 21:12:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course not ! We are the worse at everything but we have to take the media's word for it ! Enough !
1320712957794410498 2020-10-26 21:04:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I really hope Starmer will kneel in gratitude in front of  Rashford.
1320712187325878273 2020-10-26 21:01:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You sound somewhat critical of all this !
1320711311571984384 2020-10-26 20:58:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And wonderful Turkey wanted to be the part of the EU.
1320710431720284160 2020-10-26 20:54:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1320710139196964864 2020-10-26 20:53:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So this young lady seems to be saying that she can't afford not to stuff herself silly with crisps and chocolate. I fear for her children's health.
1320707912784924672 2020-10-26 20:44:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think the Police has been told not to confront them because if anything went wrong there would an orgy of Leftie screaming.
1320701714559832065 2020-10-26 20:20:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No leave him where he is!😋
1320696567507095556 2020-10-26 19:59:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Small of stature!😋
1320694825914695680 2020-10-26 19:52:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he looks more like an estate agent in waiting!
1320694344945459200 2020-10-26 19:50:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes well said but they have no intention of changing their ways. We are expected to tolerate their ways which can include vile behaviour. When in Rome do like the Romans do!
1320684226686144514 2020-10-26 19:10:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have never so much hypocritical fake outrage in the cause of disparaging the Government.
1320680840574181376 2020-10-26 18:57:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is just an attempt to minimise the event because Nigerians are involved.
1320649558054051840 2020-10-26 16:52:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How about “ Plunkers galore”!
1320648548300607488 2020-10-26 16:48:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙈😂😂🙈😂😂
1320647738632118272 2020-10-26 16:45:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Upon consideration I have come to the conclusion that you are a fool, madam!
1320637091651399680 2020-10-26 16:03:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!The absurdity taking place in Wales is beyond parody!😡😡
1320626261455179777 2020-10-26 15:20:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Claire!🌞🌞🌞
1320624030043484160 2020-10-26 15:11:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> By the way which company was it ?😋
1320620515409756160 2020-10-26 14:57:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie. Glad you agree. Maybe my language is a little direct but what the hell !😊
1320618903266091008 2020-10-26 14:50:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is likely to be a White man because it almost certainly was! This is just extremist twaddle like a lot of things nowadays and the instigators should be ashamed of their stupid selves. Marxist Corbyn supporters I am looking at you !
1320617877309894657 2020-10-26 14:46:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @carmic3 @STattisconie @No_Bikers Wait for the deportation of all England and the seizure of all England assets and refusing to repay all debts to us, but would still rather like to keep our pound. Deluded people who want their own way in everything!
1320615803033669633 2020-10-26 14:38:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can't get much more transgressive than cutting someone's head off, now can you ?
1320615463337021440 2020-10-26 14:37:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @France24_en Muslims don't seem to live in the same world as the rest offs ! Pity they can't find another one !
1320614219553902592 2020-10-26 14:32:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Forget New Labour ! This is the same old Labour of 60 years ago. It doesn't work in the modern world.
1320613227378724866 2020-10-26 14:28:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These Nigerians cause trouble wherever they go.
1320611216440676352 2020-10-26 14:20:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gross distortion of the facts which is getting very tiresome!

1320373421168013314 2020-10-25 22:35:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t take any bloody notice Margaret!😋

1320360126704996353 2020-10-25 21:42:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Self love is healthy! I am only teasing you which is a form of affection . You never tease people you don’t like.😋
1320359395398746112 2020-10-25 21:39:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So not just vain but fickle ! Love you  😍
1320350590032089088 2020-10-25 21:04:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't speak out because they won't hear a word against their Muslim friends no. matter what atrocities are carried out !
1320349853105459200 2020-10-25 21:01:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure most people on benefits feed their children at all times , with some exceptions.
1320346539378737154 2020-10-25 20:48:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it is not too much to ask . The way Politics are nowadays  short of a military dictatorship I can't see anyone getting anywhere. I am not advocating a dictatorship but our version of democracy in the west is not working .
1320336281109495810 2020-10-25 20:07:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem nowadays is that people expect so much more and consider some things to be essential which of course they are not. Poverty for some people is not to afford holidays.
1320321325781684225 2020-10-25 19:08:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most probably true! What a sad indinctment if our society!
1320320119533412352 2020-10-25 19:03:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course the latest!😋
1320314939068850177 2020-10-25 18:43:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about free clothes, trainers and free holidays in Benidorm? Why not! Just because they are worth it!😋
1320280498535530496 2020-10-25 16:26:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You don’t say 😂😂
1320279906605989888 2020-10-25 16:23:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, the sense of irony seems to escape some hard lefties. They take themselves so seriously. It’s what is commonly known as “ up your own arse!”
1320277174709092354 2020-10-25 16:13:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More bearded children appearing! Quite ridiculous! Yet again an example of the silly country !
1320275996352937984 2020-10-25 16:08:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hatred of the English is what drives the independence movement.
1320267956971065344 2020-10-25 15:36:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is called Democracy but of course it isn’t!
1320256683629830144 2020-10-25 14:51:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sensible!😋
1320256071974457345 2020-10-25 14:49:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Half of  the time I cannot like or retweet a tweet . Hope you made the most of your extra hour in bed !😊

1320250607874297856 2020-10-25 14:27:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tempting ! 😂😂
1320247849519632387 2020-10-25 14:16:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well obviously never ! I think we know what the current fashionable cause is however ridiculous. All this is doing is setting back race relations in a big way !
1320246123286716426 2020-10-25 14:09:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My twitter account is all over the place at the moment. What is going on ?
1320243675893534720 2020-10-25 13:59:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good idea !

1320240867987390464 2020-10-25 13:48:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely ! Making people dependent on the State for handouts is not the solution.
1320071080392929286 2020-10-25 02:34:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂

1319987672648122370 2020-10-24 21:02:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure you won’t!

1319983627585847296 2020-10-24 20:46:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shameful ! A country which forgets its past hasn't got a future !

1319982612425986048 2020-10-24 20:42:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, let us count our blessings and let Wales a reminder to us all !
1319980575831347200 2020-10-24 20:34:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the best tweet of the day! I know what you mean!
1319980241557749760 2020-10-24 20:33:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Okay !
1319980037412655105 2020-10-24 20:32:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No but I know a man who has, our chancellor . So much for gratitude!
1319979825738678272 2020-10-24 20:31:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are not shamans, they are hand wringing social workers in fancy dress !
1319979440743604224 2020-10-24 20:29:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they can't be arsed Tim ! It is the same people who will drive round and round the car park looking for the nearest parking space to the door to avoid walking a few yards. This is the land of the bone idle waddling bastards.
1319978879109500929 2020-10-24 20:27:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sincerely hope so too. Cannot wait to see the downfall of the evil bitch. She reminds of Mary Nesbitt without. the humour and the kindness.
1319978566528925698 2020-10-24 20:26:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They need to mind their own business. The church and the state are separate entities.
1319978287985295360 2020-10-24 20:25:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nothing is happening in the rest of the world. We are getting to be like the Americans.

1319975304077651969 2020-10-24 20:13:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem is you have anti English feelings in Wales and Northern Ireland and a lot of English people would not mind  getting rid of the Scots as they are becoming extremely tiresome and treacherous . Uncomfortable but it has to be said .

1319602676628393985 2020-10-23 19:32:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is none so vociferous as the man who does not know what he/she is talking about.
1319602041514319872 2020-10-23 19:30:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have come to the conclusion that when Covid 19 is discussed you could be ensured that nobody knows what they are talking about .
1319601568900091905 2020-10-23 19:28:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Was it a happy marriage Connor ?
1319601454164922369 2020-10-23 19:27:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The people who promote this bollocks have no notion of real history. It is the same people who say "embrace" when really put up with !
1319578838922395649 2020-10-23 17:58:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pas de question!
1319544258148376576 2020-10-23 15:40:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is a lousy politician but a wonderful bully!
1319544058465931264 2020-10-23 15:39:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Where are the days of good mannered and basic curtesy gone to ?
1319543850826911744 2020-10-23 15:39:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope not !
1319526911836553218 2020-10-23 14:31:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true!
1319526067128905728 2020-10-23 14:28:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sorry for your loss. Such a sad end to a life.
1319524259925004288 2020-10-23 14:21:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bloody hell Connor! If that’s the case I can’t wait to see it! Whatever it will be a black Christmas!
1319523549170880512 2020-10-23 14:18:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, she is a very dangerous individual.
1319523397857050624 2020-10-23 14:17:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are naughty but I like you 😋
1319523267041001472 2020-10-23 14:17:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1319521440627130370 2020-10-23 14:10:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps they have a point in China !
1319521250625060866 2020-10-23 14:09:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good ! The bastards don't deserve too !😂
1319520953492262912 2020-10-23 14:08:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I remember that image and George is a maverick but the is the only one standing up to the SNP ! No easy feat !
1319520720892944385 2020-10-23 14:07:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I totally understand that. The fact that Labour is almost non existent in Scotland has greatly strengthened the SNP. I know I am stating the obvious, What you are saying you are stuck with the SNP.
1319520214845952000 2020-10-23 14:05:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Paul, the simple answer is there aren't any !
1319519883248521216 2020-10-23 14:03:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In this country the term "child poverty" is misused . Usually the kind of household with at least one TV set the size of a wall. The fact they eat junk food is entirely their decision. ign aid ?ign aid ign aidgn anin an hn gn an hn n ahn
1319518780427481088 2020-10-23 13:59:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes at least!😂😂
1319518541578645504 2020-10-23 13:58:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They need to push harder ! I am expecting a lot from George Galloway !
1319517412094627840 2020-10-23 13:54:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie !
1319517192602386433 2020-10-23 13:53:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nippy seems to be a curious combination of the extreme Liberal Left and National Socialism.
1319516365556940800 2020-10-23 13:49:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is shocking !
1319516103316590592 2020-10-23 13:48:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How long till Black month is over? I can then turn on the television again ! I can't wait for the John Lewis's Christmas ad!
1319515640454139904 2020-10-23 13:46:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The sad truth is that if she did not have so much home support she would not be able to.
1319514941100085248 2020-10-23 13:44:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So one rule for them and another one for us !
1319514677085437952 2020-10-23 13:43:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon just won't work with the English unless it is some Labour Party dross who needs her support .
1319513443221884928 2020-10-23 13:38:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1319513256537489408 2020-10-23 13:37:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are all show aren't you ! Fur coat no drawers!😀
1319508331355144192 2020-10-23 13:17:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I suspect they are or are blinded by their hatred of the English and the Conservatives.
1319507880547127296 2020-10-23 13:16:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course they haven't and never will !
1319507385438928896 2020-10-23 13:14:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth hurts !
1319506636566941697 2020-10-23 13:11:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No there isn't ! Little miss Hitler cannot control everything! What's a digital Christmas? meaningless.
1319506264892805121 2020-10-23 13:09:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You and your showers ! 😀
1319350344267276289 2020-10-23 02:50:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1319347245003771909 2020-10-23 02:37:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If only !
1319341591715250176 2020-10-23 02:15:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can really understand how you feel. Very worrying times for so many
1319341199342305280 2020-10-23 02:13:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for that Paul!

1319298790046613506 2020-10-22 23:25:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The penny has finally dropped
1319277754810970112 2020-10-22 22:01:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It looks pretty staged. No Oscar for that performance!
1319249343325634560 2020-10-22 20:08:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is very sad ! We are listening to a product of Cambridge University !
1319249004107096065 2020-10-22 20:07:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Beatles !
1319248750108430336 2020-10-22 20:06:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Stop creeping up people' arses ! it's not a good look !
1319248377255759874 2020-10-22 20:04:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !❤️💔
1319247792271953920 2020-10-22 20:02:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he is not ! It suits the media to describe thus. Some while the German referred to Boris as the clown. I bet they are not saying that now !
1319247182072041472 2020-10-22 20:00:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe the mayor is embarrassed by his recent theatricals which did no put him in a good light. Victim he is not !
1319246797622202371 2020-10-22 19:58:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No they do not ! I suspect that Rashford got a lot of media attention for a very specific reason.
1319246212911026176 2020-10-22 19:56:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nowadays in particular they live in their own dream world.
1319246035399696384 2020-10-22 19:55:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some BBC are indeed made redundant. not because of the pandemic because of gross management stupidity.
1319245685414371328 2020-10-22 19:54:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right but it does not suit the Labour Party's agenda. All they are interested in is trying to buy more voters.
1319244601794924545 2020-10-22 19:49:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This country has shown the way to them in the past.
1319244325428121600 2020-10-22 19:48:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes in a nut shell !
1319243785650511874 2020-10-22 19:46:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She wasn't brave enough to admit it ! It is not brave enough to come out and say it to his face! Brave and dignified my arse!
1319243276197728257 2020-10-22 19:44:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Common sense will hopefully prevail !
1319242652135657473 2020-10-22 19:42:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not an universal right that you must be allowed to have children.
1319241685101142016 2020-10-22 19:38:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1319241073571581954 2020-10-22 19:35:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right !
1319240919753818113 2020-10-22 19:35:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, not at all unreasonable ! You might well ask! It's just that in certain quarters there are a lot of professional victims.
1319224302458241024 2020-10-22 18:29:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well there is a stench of something rotten!
1319203416405643264 2020-10-22 17:06:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shame we don’t!
1319202809687035904 2020-10-22 17:03:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Alan, you have it all! This is the silly country !
1319199499777155072 2020-10-22 16:50:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋
1319199148118282261 2020-10-22 16:49:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly true !
1319173803344363521 2020-10-22 15:08:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1319167302353510405 2020-10-22 14:42:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I totally agree with you Paul!😋
1319167025206480897 2020-10-22 14:41:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rayner has got a pea brain!
1319166408895483904 2020-10-22 14:39:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think so !
1319166325349060608 2020-10-22 14:38:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes darling! But remember a strong democracy requires a strong opposition!
1319164755299471361 2020-10-22 14:32:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You charmer 😋
1319163129704697856 2020-10-22 14:26:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The hypocrisy of it all!
1319162560826978304 2020-10-22 14:23:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sad! They are been sold a fake dream of independence. Anything wrong is been blamed on Westminster. Do the nationalists really believe that independent Scotland would be so much better of?
1319160953968205824 2020-10-22 14:17:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And what can the reason be? I wonder!🤨🤨
1319158462320988161 2020-10-22 14:07:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are not showing any genuine concern, just fake outrage.
1319151836377567232 2020-10-22 13:41:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @kateferguson4 Yes indeed !
1319149595566444545 2020-10-22 13:32:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Montpellier ! Free speech in action ! Do your worse muslims!
1319148937341796352 2020-10-22 13:29:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look Gary you are not fooling anyone with all this nonsense. If this "guest" exists he is surely an illegal. Anything else is weasel words. You must think us ordinary people are just idiots !  https://t.co/j3kcLdGCzE
1319148116935872513 2020-10-22 13:26:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @ItsJustaRide Don't forget ! According to the BBC the countryside is now racist , maybe you should think twice !🤣🤣🤣
1319147778061291521 2020-10-22 13:25:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @HHepplewhite This is reminiscent of the episode with Corbyn when he refused to admit his own words.
1319146798422892544 2020-10-22 13:21:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Answer that Morgan. You have shot yourself in the foot once again !
1319146634513702912 2020-10-22 13:20:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no answer to that !
1319146144728076288 2020-10-22 13:18:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just face up to it Barnier , you failed miserably and ever one knows it. You were all very brave mocking and bullying Mrs May. What wonderful European friends we have !
1319145521752252416 2020-10-22 13:16:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All I know about you is a very rude woman and a disgrace to the house of commons. If Starmer won't tell you what a lot of us will. Your apology was meaningless.
1319144087619031041 2020-10-22 13:10:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think a lot of people will agree with you. To a certain group  of people anyone who does not agree with them in any way is automatically far right. Quite ridiculous . They don't understand the term and are basically ignorant.
1319141961945796609 2020-10-22 13:02:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a pretty one at that !
1319141861831954432 2020-10-22 13:01:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He should but he won't ! I imagine he is rather isolated in his own cabinet.
1319141536811094016 2020-10-22 13:00:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely ! Shameful !
1319141447816413184 2020-10-22 13:00:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds depressing !
1319141326743609344 2020-10-22 12:59:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon is a ridiculous little witch . Anything England does she has to do differently just for the sake of it !
1318990325143228416 2020-10-22 02:59:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said
1318989394968301576 2020-10-22 02:55:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think I am going to give the latest Rebus a wide berth.😋Did you find any Denise Mina’s books. Another one of my favourite author is Philip Kerr. He sadly died last year but he is a brilliant writer. Have a nice evening!😋
1318988114245914631 2020-10-22 02:50:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All of the above!
1318983218977296384 2020-10-22 02:31:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would not be surprised but then again .....🤨🤨
1318981887352819718 2020-10-22 02:26:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I was taken in at first 😋
1318981767680954368 2020-10-22 02:25:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1318980176781414408 2020-10-22 02:19:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely! It’s becoming an embarrassment! Where are the likes of Denis Skinner. At least you knew he was a passionate man who said what he believed to be true even if you didn’t agree with him.
1318979550680940546 2020-10-22 02:16:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely hilarious and so clever! I love Zara whoever he or she is! Brilliant!
1318979293339418624 2020-10-22 02:15:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with what you are saying but really considering the pandemic should there be so many demos? It’s every week in London.
1318974296430120960 2020-10-22 01:55:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck with that

1318970007200686081 2020-10-22 01:38:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course we are taking the piss 🤣
1318969049934680066 2020-10-22 01:35:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> About bloody time !
1318955594460561409 2020-10-22 00:41:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂🤣🤣
1318954549772771328 2020-10-22 00:37:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A bit late in the day me thinks!
1318952794276175872 2020-10-22 00:30:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No way! The honourable lady won’t apologise either!
1318948822152843265 2020-10-22 00:14:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly very true! Parliament is becoming a sad spectacle!😥
1318947558589423619 2020-10-22 00:09:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The games people play!
1318947447469649920 2020-10-22 00:09:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1318947277013196801 2020-10-22 00:08:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😳😳😳😳
1318945205513539586 2020-10-22 00:00:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! How dare the spineless Liberals criticise someone like this!

1318890877117452289 2020-10-21 20:24:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You should watch "Come dine with me" for a real selection  of performing freaks !
1318890203529039877 2020-10-21 20:21:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are obviously Welcoming the destruction of their own culture !
1318889635842609157 2020-10-21 20:19:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dawn has a special talent which the Guardian appreciates and that is talking bollocks ! She never fails !

1318865574139727872 2020-10-21 18:43:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My husband went to his local chemist to have the jab done. It might be an idea to do that.
1318863725194022912 2020-10-21 18:36:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1318863549939286016 2020-10-21 18:35:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sorry to hear that! I received a letter from my surgery a month ago and they then gave me an appointment for today.

1318837311921152001 2020-10-21 16:51:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Monsieur Barnier your name is “merde” ! Oh dear!🙈🙈
1318837066264870912 2020-10-21 16:50:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How can you take this nonsense seriously! The media laps it up because that’s what they want to hear! It’s a farce!
1318819846247907328 2020-10-21 15:42:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is stretching it a bit! Caroline, you and I should probably meet up soon in case things deteriorate. Just a thought!😋
1318818885630644224 2020-10-21 15:38:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all! I am off to get my flu jab this morning .It’s only a five minutes walk to the surgery.😋

1318794333877903360 2020-10-21 14:00:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good ! You can do it if you try !
1318794111885975553 2020-10-21 13:59:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @jjcwow De Gaule wanted our help and was extremely ungrateful when he did get it ! I don't know how Churchill put up with him. De Gaulle never wanted Britain to enter the Common Party. He did not trust the Anglo-Saxons to play ball !
1318791548058931202 2020-10-21 13:49:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think they should !

1318788773904326656 2020-10-21 13:38:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Labour Party has always been like this.Don't forget they were very keen to close down state grammar schools for working class children. The people behind this of course  benefitted for a full education themselves.
1318788107337162758 2020-10-21 13:36:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1318787840650653696 2020-10-21 13:34:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> From personal experience London is a bloody. This man  has succeeded in disfiguring the whole city and the silly little sod has run out of money.
1318786734453293056 2020-10-21 13:30:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For a change !
1318786644233814017 2020-10-21 13:30:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The vile BLM has given an excuse for a Marxist field day and should be crushed. It is like Mao's cultural revolution and Cambodia's Polpot.
1318785736154501121 2020-10-21 13:26:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes a very impassioned and impressive speech ! Contrast this to Dawn Butler's previous drivel ! The latter has the intellect of a pickled walnut if that !
1318785134582181888 2020-10-21 13:24:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These are murdering scums , no way about it !

1318784390600773632 2020-10-21 13:21:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said ! Every one should listen to this ! She gets my vote!
1318783443325640704 2020-10-21 13:17:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ireland has now shut down till December the 1st !

1318604396473831424 2020-10-21 01:26:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wake up to what Piers? Your self promotion publicity? Who’s listening?
1318603401530384390 2020-10-21 01:22:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1318590860901089280 2020-10-21 00:32:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question! Because they tell us they are?😂
1318581243634720770 2020-10-20 23:54:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For once our mayor has come out with a sensible suggestion. The 10 PM curfew makes no sense!
1318553639800217606 2020-10-20 22:04:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1318553029478580227 2020-10-20 22:01:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Now I have seen everything ! An arse talking in the house of commons!
1318528255339732993 2020-10-20 20:23:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Brown's solution is to pay all these people their full income indefinitely really ? I knew he was no economist but this is ridiculous and pure political point scoring ! Shame on you Brown ! You would be better off standing up to the SNP ! Maybe too much a challenge!
1318525951345594369 2020-10-20 20:14:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They will !
1318525844189491200 2020-10-20 20:13:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That sums it up !
1318525572709044226 2020-10-20 20:12:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You sound like an intelligent man to me ,you must be right!
1318525116796571648 2020-10-20 20:10:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are only stating the obvious !
1318524683541749760 2020-10-20 20:09:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Would love to ! but I can't stand listening to Rob Roy Mcarsesake ! 😀 Independence might be a very good idea!
1318524083588505602 2020-10-20 20:06:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The only answer is white lives don't matter innocent or not .
1318523779610533888 2020-10-20 20:05:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is she not joining the opposition. She is a lot more vocal than some of them on the subject of Brexit.
1318522313462190082 2020-10-20 19:59:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And of course there is no balance in the House of Lords. As we all know there are a disproportionate number of Liberals  in that house. Probably clever Cameron was. trying to please Clegg. It is a feudal system not based on merit or democratic voting.
1318521739576594432 2020-10-20 19:57:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is an ignorant silly lady ! Wake up and don't believe everything the SNP tells you! They are conning you!
1318521024049258501 2020-10-20 19:54:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nothing stays the same. You are not stuck in this situation forever. Things will look different eventually, just hang on in there !
1318512144560902145 2020-10-20 19:19:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What do you think?😋
1318511482322194434 2020-10-20 19:16:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on.

1318491003720957952 2020-10-20 17:55:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievable! Since he left office all he has done is acquire more money and stir up shit! A millionaire war criminal!

1318435276608462849 2020-10-20 14:13:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It certainly doesn’t!
1318434442034221056 2020-10-20 14:10:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The answer is very little. They are yesterday’s people!

1318426343747584000 2020-10-20 13:38:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet another piece of good news you won't hear on the BBC or any other media.Anything positive they don't want to know. They want us to wallow in misery and criticise the government. That's their whole thing.
1318425896542404611 2020-10-20 13:36:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Heading either the Job centre or the old people's home.
1318425200027893760 2020-10-20 13:33:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, but apparently somehow it is in certain quarters!

1318423302013149187 2020-10-20 13:26:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are these special people such hypocritical bastards. He is in the same category as Tony Blair !
1318421005065441280 2020-10-20 13:17:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the arbishop is willing to pander to Irish criminals we are not !
1318419341575114753 2020-10-20 13:10:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shocking behaviour from the ultimate do goober ! and by the way where is the mysterious tenant? Answer: There isn't one and never will be !
1318416763705581568 2020-10-20 13:00:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Devolution has been a disaster for this country.  It has created divisions. Another thing we have to be grateful to Blair for !
1318414500811411456 2020-10-20 12:51:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but they won't have the courage to do so.
1318413239827550209 2020-10-20 12:46:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In other words we are not caving in to the EU's unreasonable demands.
1318412776495349761 2020-10-20 12:44:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The absurdity of it all ! It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic .  Lives are been destroyed daily.

1318412036137779200 2020-10-20 12:41:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yasmin is a vile self promoting individual. She is a racist herself and seems to hate this country and all it stands for . Why is she still living here ?
1318411428873764869 2020-10-20 12:39:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !

1318179792735358976 2020-10-19 21:18:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We will look back on this period and think it was mad! Destroying lives for what ?
1318179431073144832 2020-10-19 21:17:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is nothing wrong with the way we say bath!🤣
1318179095553986561 2020-10-19 21:16:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤣🤣🤣
1318178560511758337 2020-10-19 21:13:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not so much of the cockney because I also lived in the North West of England so still have a little northern accent. The way I say bath is a bit of a give away but the French accent is still there.
1318174008190316545 2020-10-19 20:55:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely! No doubt

1318163207186505729 2020-10-19 20:12:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite the opposite !
1318162919364886531 2020-10-19 20:11:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hardly !
1318162226587590657 2020-10-19 20:08:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! Common sense needs to be applied !

1318158825237741568 2020-10-19 19:55:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Welby is the original limp wrist liberal and not a pretty sight!
1318157991347105793 2020-10-19 19:52:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1318157166981877760 2020-10-19 19:48:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SWAM10056 Every European country must follow this example.
1318156933707202562 2020-10-19 19:47:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These clergymen should be ashamed of themselves .
1318156654823809024 2020-10-19 19:46:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Where I live we would say "All gobs and bollocks !

1318155449846407169 2020-10-19 19:42:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Everywhere where Labour has local control is a disaster area ! See the common denominator !
1318155045087698944 2020-10-19 19:40:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @GMunson10 You are ! but the funny thing is you might suffer as well !🤣🤣
1318148042965635072 2020-10-19 19:12:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have seen it and it was very interesting! Well worth watching!
1318138525636874241 2020-10-19 18:34:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly you are right!

1318082679892594688 2020-10-19 14:52:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totally agree with you!
1318079911366623233 2020-10-19 14:41:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I have noticed! Love the humour! We all need cheering up so thank you!

1318071885792481280 2020-10-19 14:10:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Clare!🌞🌞
1318068225582747648 2020-10-19 13:55:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Piers enough propaganda !
1318068041691824134 2020-10-19 13:54:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Take a moment to listen to this man !
1318067375145713664 2020-10-19 13:52:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not be defeatists !
1318067253917720576 2020-10-19 13:51:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mrs Sturgeon as we all know is a treacherous little witch who is been found out in a big way.
1318066789969002497 2020-10-19 13:49:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It shows how the Germans think which is not good.
1318066236769665024 2020-10-19 13:47:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know Connor but still we have to express our feelings somehow.
1318065374370385921 2020-10-19 13:44:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> WE don't want a stupid circuit breaker which will achieve nothing.
1318062357776683010 2020-10-19 13:32:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good !
1318061058293223424 2020-10-19 13:26:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> About time !
1318060539063554048 2020-10-19 13:24:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they did !
1318056127767207936 2020-10-19 13:07:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It must be a piss take !
1318054722889224193 2020-10-19 13:01:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @abline11 We are way too tolerant of this type of despicable behaviour! Where was the police ?
1318053397266825223 2020-10-19 12:56:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are not going to .  Sturgeon will scream all she likes about English oppression and she will play the monumental victim.
1318052784806166534 2020-10-19 12:54:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In my life time the worse PM was the vile Edward Heath lying to us about the European mafia. You trot off !
1317887531946561537 2020-10-19 01:57:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Je t’en prie!😍
1317886219280392192 2020-10-19 01:52:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy your lovely dinner! Forget calories! Bon appetite!🍗🍖
1317885330868080641 2020-10-19 01:48:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds delicious!Who’s coming for dinner?
1317868780689686530 2020-10-19 00:42:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! She is a good choreographer and she will cleverly play with the male/female lead.
1317866788428939265 2020-10-19 00:35:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious ! She seemed happy enough last night. She is very inventive and will see this as a challenge .
1317864215953264643 2020-10-19 00:24:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought so !🙂🙃
1317863647314612225 2020-10-19 00:22:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is that a promise?😛
1317837413528502272 2020-10-18 22:38:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Honestly!
1317831803823063050 2020-10-18 22:16:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course darling!🤣🤣
1317825874956341249 2020-10-18 21:52:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @actiontiff My point is that he will never be allowed to forget it whilst others .......
1317825117603438592 2020-10-18 21:49:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not really !🤣
1317824006926512130 2020-10-18 21:45:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Like Margaret Ferrier he will get away with it . Dominic Cummins on the other hand will be mentioned by Piers Morgan at least once a week for the next 20 years!
1317823515207360512 2020-10-18 21:43:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! Mind you that it is the way our media puts it !
1317823021361496064 2020-10-18 21:41:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This has got to be fake news ! Is she waiting for Biden to pop his clogs ! This is ridiculous and Harry would be the first man !🤣🤣🤣
1317822640866865152 2020-10-18 21:39:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should hope not !🤣🤣
1317822146136113153 2020-10-18 21:37:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I understand that but sometimes there comes a time when you have to fight your natural instinct. People must learn to appreciate you and they will if you make them. 😊
1317821152316837890 2020-10-18 21:33:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should hope so !
1317820967742279680 2020-10-18 21:32:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe with all respect you have to learn to say no. If someone does not appreciate your help then withdraw it . Simples !
1317820446339981312 2020-10-18 21:30:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That would be nice ! You have got to set your priorities. A sense of humour would come in handy too !
1317820120698421248 2020-10-18 21:29:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too !
1317819736491778049 2020-10-18 21:28:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why not both ?
1317819403866603521 2020-10-18 21:26:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤣🤣🤣
1317819153097625600 2020-10-18 21:25:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid very few people nowadays show any manners. People are courteous when they want a favour from you but when you have done them a favour you don't see them for dust. The problem is that a lot of people are totally self centred. Just saying !😊
1317818544407650309 2020-10-18 21:23:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All of us ! 🙉🙉🙉
1317798446485700609 2020-10-18 20:03:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mindless or what! Mrs May was so ineffectual and indeed half hearted that they were lulled into a false sense of security.
1317795693592018944 2020-10-18 19:52:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It just confirms our suspicions!
1317777674002223104 2020-10-18 18:40:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very wise !😂
1317776983015776261 2020-10-18 18:38:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course she must be !
1317776297851060224 2020-10-18 18:35:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s all I needed to know that you have a good woman at your side!😋
1317772042905800704 2020-10-18 18:18:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So handsome! I hope you have an Oyl by your side!
1317769429304987649 2020-10-18 18:08:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We must not lose our sense of humour.  I fear we are going to need it in the coming months! Have a good Sunday Mr Chesty and don’t forget to eat your spinach.
1317768867167539202 2020-10-18 18:05:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course you do darling! Modesty is your second name!
1317767917736517632 2020-10-18 18:02:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I suppose that's a reasonable size, about average.  You should be able to stick one or two medals. 😀
1317766400425996294 2020-10-18 17:56:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How broad are you ? Do you stick your chest out ?😂🙉
1317766124877025280 2020-10-18 17:55:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is an unfortunate the teacher was white ! White lives don't really matter !
1317765828759224320 2020-10-18 17:53:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes bus drivers and midwives.
1317765658671722496 2020-10-18 17:53:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we do !
1317765484599803904 2020-10-18 17:52:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No orientals, few Asians . We are just swamped with Blacks and it is getting a little irritating. Just wait for the black Christmas Santa ?
1317765212741783552 2020-10-18 17:51:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is your chest big enough?
1317763458448969739 2020-10-18 17:44:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We support the people of Paris !  https://t.co/I6cOY4Ovdn
1317762950602641409 2020-10-18 17:42:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For all dog lovers !  https://t.co/KBZ5nFWxjP
1317756487129845761 2020-10-18 17:16:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is an embarrassment for the BBC.They want this monstrous act to disappear from our consciousness as soon as possible.
1317754949326000129 2020-10-18 17:10:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some people never grow up! There are certainly plenty of Peter Pans. We have all met a few!
1317732230689587200 2020-10-18 15:40:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he was at the time giving his honest medical opinion.

1317708194777530369 2020-10-18 14:04:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I cannot believe that even Khan will not issue a statement of  solidarity with the mayor of Paris !
1317707772046282759 2020-10-18 14:03:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @RogerHelmerMEP Yes ! As much as you might loathe Macron you want a politician like him who says what he thinks instead of creeping around the muslim issue. Vive la France et Charlie Hebdo.
1317706526224748545 2020-10-18 13:58:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So French muslims think it is acceptable to cut someone's head in the street. Let us hear loud and clear condemn this vile act !
1317705552085082113 2020-10-18 13:54:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Muchas gracias !

1317699027144724480 2020-10-18 13:28:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The religion of hate !
1317698892503318528 2020-10-18 13:27:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bravo ! Bravo !
1317698758243700736 2020-10-18 13:27:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Freedom of speech is the most important element of a democracy, and we must fight for it . Look at Russia !
1317697463390773248 2020-10-18 13:22:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes BBC and all the other media channels why do you never mention good news. It is all gloom and doom with you .
1317697154362839040 2020-10-18 13:20:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Only idiots don't realise this ! Mind you there are a few of those about !
1317696839953637376 2020-10-18 13:19:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> To be fair the scenes in Italy in early March with Covid patients lying on the floor of hospitals etc prompted the Government to act. It was the right thing to do at the time.
1317696345696817154 2020-10-18 13:17:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Doctor gorgeous has changed his tune since then but we  know what he really thinks !
1317696023255502848 2020-10-18 13:16:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Russian one !

1317694151849369600 2020-10-18 13:09:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Je suis Samuel !  https://t.co/8YKEXtHliA
1317533927448416256 2020-10-18 02:32:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The police were only doing their job. This individual deliberately took another man’s life in the most barbaric way.
1317528885005832192 2020-10-18 02:12:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too!😋
1317500796053893125 2020-10-18 00:20:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can say that again!
1317500018551644161 2020-10-18 00:17:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1317496265438121989 2020-10-18 00:02:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Heaven forbid! That would be too positive!
1317491695143903232 2020-10-17 23:44:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I was born in Paris and still have there. I came to live in England when I was 15 a very long time. To me this is home but I do go back to France every couple of years or so. We have friends in Paris who are bouquinistes on the quai de Montebello.😋
1317487564815781890 2020-10-17 23:28:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> C'est vrai ! Guilty as charged ! Nee a Paris but now a cockney !
1317485891011698693 2020-10-17 23:21:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who cares where he lives. By the way why is Paul O'Grady still here and not in Venice after Brexit !
1317484364314431488 2020-10-17 23:15:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for the Polish !
1317483708354580486 2020-10-17 23:12:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They will flock there like flies to shit !
1317483502405824512 2020-10-17 23:11:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would never wear those !🙉🙉🙉
1317483325309714433 2020-10-17 23:11:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These French fishermen must not think of messing with the Royal Navy !
1317483103632449537 2020-10-17 23:10:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Interesting Lee. We have our own idea of what the average remainersaur is like. I would say it is not flattering.
1317482660583919616 2020-10-17 23:08:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! Imagine the shame of it if you had your oldest greyish knickers on !
1317481626075582471 2020-10-17 23:04:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think ladies tend to in case they have an accident and end up in hospital !😂😂
1317479146340126721 2020-10-17 22:54:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Je suis Samuel !  https://t.co/8FluXhIll9
1317478858422177794 2020-10-17 22:53:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The teacher 's name was Samuel , so in the same way we said "Je suit Charlie", it will be "Je suis Samuel".
1317478062523559936 2020-10-17 22:50:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1317477232932257792 2020-10-17 22:47:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can see that!
1317477130406711296 2020-10-17 22:46:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is only way to deal with bullies !
1317476873815949318 2020-10-17 22:45:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is a bit strong Maureen ! You are telling him to go f ... himself. Good use of colloquial French !😂😂
1317476045520556034 2020-10-17 22:42:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Non merci monsieur le President !
1317475774727966724 2020-10-17 22:41:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not one bit and it is a completely alien culture which does not export well !
1317473551151190018 2020-10-17 22:32:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Terry ! Spoken like a true English man!
1317457331039371265 2020-10-17 21:27:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1317444022504390656 2020-10-17 20:35:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1317441081051697155 2020-10-17 20:23:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1317417614012985344 2020-10-17 18:50:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This descends to a whole new level of atrocity!
1317406494736994304 2020-10-17 18:05:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1317375973311000577 2020-10-17 16:04:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Harry is the spare heir and thank God!
1317373982971219968 2020-10-17 15:56:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is treacherous but ridiculous!
1317373487716159491 2020-10-17 15:54:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s all grandstanding from little Mother Scotland!
1317354356925206528 2020-10-17 14:38:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! What a spanner!
1317353099489587201 2020-10-17 14:33:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most Riojas from Spain.
1317352934775152640 2020-10-17 14:33:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course you do!
1317349958706733058 2020-10-17 14:21:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too! You deserve it as you work so hard!😋😋
1317347697653960704 2020-10-17 14:12:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Top of the morning to you too!🌞🌞
1317343615308451842 2020-10-17 13:56:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don't forget the British Library and others. Time to drain the liberal sewer !
1317343042915995649 2020-10-17 13:53:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he doesn't !
1317341937226174464 2020-10-17 13:49:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And also it never seems to apply to ethnics !
1317341508778033152 2020-10-17 13:47:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We support Charlie Hebdo and free speech ! The pen is mightier than the sword.  https://t.co/98ujXP5VU1
1317339686256463872 2020-10-17 13:40:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ireland the EU 's puddle is not going to benefit from no deal. They should not have supported the EU unreservedly. They are been shat on already by the EU!
1317337778577920000 2020-10-17 13:32:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the cross channel migrants ! Who is keeping an eye on them ?
1317335309051363328 2020-10-17 13:23:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not if our media has anything to do with it !
1317333774854651905 2020-10-17 13:17:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this to please the Muslim vote!
1317331594907127810 2020-10-17 13:08:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not forget that she is married to a man who belongs to a race that she despises ! The hypocrisy of the woman knows no bound !
1317330988125556742 2020-10-17 13:05:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @BBalderdash44UK So so predictable !
1317330341884022785 2020-10-17 13:03:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Arrogance never wins at the end ! Mutual respect and willingness to compromise does ! This little island will not be bullied ! So proud of this Great Britain !
1317329566348836864 2020-10-17 13:00:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course !
1317329191205994496 2020-10-17 12:58:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true ! Their bullying tactics have not worked. As previously in history they have underestimated this country. The British when they need to stand up to bullies !
1317328239891763200 2020-10-17 12:55:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1317328107842510848 2020-10-17 12:54:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a silly man you are ! Nothing has been stripped from you !
1317327940858859520 2020-10-17 12:53:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Truer words were never spoken. Edward Heath was probably the worst prime minister we ever had !
1317327496577245184 2020-10-17 12:52:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC is if anything consistent ! Channel 4 7 o'clock news did spend time discussing it !
1317327142909337600 2020-10-17 12:50:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @petersingh206 @BBCNews I am very surprised they mentioned it at all !
1317326969583882240 2020-10-17 12:49:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes credit where it is due ! Macron is not afraid to call a spade a spade !
1317326607682592769 2020-10-17 12:48:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning to you too !
1317326371891326976 2020-10-17 12:47:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is there no limit to this woman's shameful and treacherous behaviour. Don't bit the hand that feeds you !
1317325865143963648 2020-10-17 12:45:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @profsked A truly horrifying experience!
1317325449299636224 2020-10-17 12:43:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mutti is partly responsible for this result! Like any relationship it has been based on mutual respect, if not it will die.
1317153815448211459 2020-10-17 01:21:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True ! It’s not over !
1317152386834665474 2020-10-17 01:16:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How horrifying!
1317145798908481536 2020-10-17 00:50:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1317143967486627841 2020-10-17 00:42:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> ?????    🙈🙈🙈

1317123882738999298 2020-10-16 23:22:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No a millionaire!
1317122978786775041 2020-10-16 23:19:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Possibly yes !
1317121564492660736 2020-10-16 23:13:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pointless last gasp of a remainsaur!
1317118818460852228 2020-10-16 23:02:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the day the EU started to fall apart!We have saved Europe yet again!
1317100204718477312 2020-10-16 21:48:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cela suffit !
1317100034962411522 2020-10-16 21:48:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The last refuge of the idiot pretending it did not happen!
1317099276334485505 2020-10-16 21:45:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merkel is responsible for a lot of this . She never took British demands seriously and was very scathing about them.
1317098971161133058 2020-10-16 21:43:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it has !
1317098076180566019 2020-10-16 21:40:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They called Boris the clown and now the clown has bitten their arse !
1317097843111481346 2020-10-16 21:39:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It has always happened with the British. They have always been underestimated and pushed until we snapped. Then they wonder what has happened.
1317097110504939524 2020-10-16 21:36:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😄😄😄😄😄😄

1317080691620929536 2020-10-16 20:31:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think there are but a minority in the world of sheep and they are sneered at by the fluffy white sheep! I hope this answers your question!
1317079136691781632 2020-10-16 20:25:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The answer is yes !  https://t.co/Z2yCa9Al2K

1317075576155504640 2020-10-16 20:11:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bravo Macron ! The deal is done, no access it is then ! Bonne chance for the elections next May. Please keep your head !
1317074324008951808 2020-10-16 20:06:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Nippy should get bitch of the year award and she has got competition !
1317073819992006659 2020-10-16 20:04:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is too recent ! It is not appropriate
1317073173414891521 2020-10-16 20:01:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, perish the thought ! She is one of those immune to prosecution ! I wonder if her husband sleeps well at night. His taste in women is odd to say the least !
1317072013605900294 2020-10-16 19:56:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @DavidJonesMP I thinks her comments sums up the EU attitude. They don't see us a a sovereign nation.
1317070115968569345 2020-10-16 19:49:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is great certainty and confidence in the EU at the moment, not !
1317069795213324290 2020-10-16 19:48:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And the Royal Navy to protect !
1317069156483801088 2020-10-16 19:45:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He hasn't surrendered !
1317068360904069120 2020-10-16 19:42:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well done Boris ! We never thought we would see the day ! UP U EU !
1317067944019492864 2020-10-16 19:40:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @lorrain00414525 Very sad news !
1317042319238062080 2020-10-16 17:58:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or the Brexit badger! Time will tell!

1317007674761007104 2020-10-16 15:41:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I'll say !
1317007253300543488 2020-10-16 15:39:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Try and tell the fanatical SNP voters that !
1317006280846905344 2020-10-16 15:35:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we do !
1317006108964327426 2020-10-16 15:34:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she is ! Yet  again the SNP. goes running to the Germans . They have a history of this !
1317005758970662912 2020-10-16 15:33:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Aldeanuk There is no alternative now . We need to walk away! They have taken the piss long enough!
1317005244254007296 2020-10-16 15:31:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No her priorities are : 1) Upset the English 2) Independence.
1317004484376231937 2020-10-16 15:28:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie !
1317003349196242945 2020-10-16 15:24:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Government cannot win !
1317002816402096129 2020-10-16 15:21:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Her downfall will come!
1316979199199092736 2020-10-16 13:48:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid I am an addict so I will be watching!
1316977662842359809 2020-10-16 13:41:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good one !
1316977456834879488 2020-10-16 13:41:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At least it wasn't a sheep !😆😕
1316976506216845313 2020-10-16 13:37:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would dread to hear the answer ! Patriots they are not !
1316976170508890112 2020-10-16 13:36:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These measures will not work. Put simply there are too many of us in too small a place ! High density is the problem.
1316975411583176706 2020-10-16 13:33:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No surprise ! What I would say to all SNP enthusiasts and independence voters be careful what you wish for ! It may not be what is been promised ! This myth that after independence Scotland would be transformed is dangerous.
1316970435528065024 2020-10-16 13:13:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Margaret !
1316970221148790785 2020-10-16 13:12:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely Margaret! Politically Boris is finished if he doesn't fulfil his promises to the electorate.
1316969873617113089 2020-10-16 13:11:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look what is happening in Sweden , France and Germany.  We have enough scum of our own without importing it!
1316969379293257733 2020-10-16 13:09:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There you have it !
1316968496237072385 2020-10-16 13:05:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Men will be men !🙉😊😀
1316967618511839233 2020-10-16 13:02:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it must take place !
1316967108996157440 2020-10-16 13:00:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good and pertinent questions Amanda !
1316966870520647680 2020-10-16 12:59:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nothing ever is and money grows on trees !
1316966479888371712 2020-10-16 12:57:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What I don't understand about this lovely lady is that she pours scorn on white men and yet is married to one such man ! What she is a professional shit stirrer and the media should give her a wide berth but they won't. Jeremy Vine often has her on his Radio 2 linch time show.
1316965212298280960 2020-10-16 12:52:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am quite horrible really but I like you !😀😕
1316965032454983686 2020-10-16 12:51:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1316964833590464512 2020-10-16 12:50:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a great day !
1316792028114685952 2020-10-16 01:24:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!👏👏
1316787916732018691 2020-10-16 01:07:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Depressing times ☹️☹️
1316787631632637954 2020-10-16 01:06:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It maybe that you are very attractive which of course is no fault of yours but may attract certain individuals.
1316783736462233602 2020-10-16 00:51:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is not a woman of her word!
1316746604532191232 2020-10-15 22:23:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A much better one!
1316742632832479232 2020-10-15 22:08:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No one ! In a couple of weeks his book will be half price in supermarkets and in three months time it will be pulp!
1316736656779681793 2020-10-15 21:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely and a hypocrite !
1316736026925301760 2020-10-15 21:41:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks !
1316735209770024960 2020-10-15 21:38:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let me know what you find ! 😊
1316734455105630209 2020-10-15 21:35:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am just finished her latest one and it is brilliant ! Yes the new Rebus is out . Get yourself out there ! 😊🙉
1316732716390510593 2020-10-15 21:28:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I did my PGCE in 1981 in modern languages. On another matter did you find any of the crime novels I suggested?
1316729935327887361 2020-10-15 21:17:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But that's all right ! He's not a racist pig unlike Laurence Fox apparently !
1316728899938721794 2020-10-15 21:13:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true Helen ! Funny enough I did my PGCE at Goldsmith's college many years ago !
1316728331505750016 2020-10-15 21:11:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And no one wore a stupid ineffectual mask ! Still waiting for your explanation doctor Gorgeous !
1316727988730441729 2020-10-15 21:09:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Still a good example at 94 !
1316727376974409729 2020-10-15 21:07:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are welcome. He truly is beautiful and he seems very sweet!
1316727252588077056 2020-10-15 21:06:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps we have the temerity to still exist after 1000s of years in our own country! Now we have heard it all from this deeply stupid woman. How on earth did she get a degree at Cambridge!
1316726572473290756 2020-10-15 21:04:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Another labour run institution going well !
1316726304839020544 2020-10-15 21:03:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon is popular because she promises idiots the earth, simple as that !
1316725227242520576 2020-10-15 20:58:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a lovely boy ! You are blessed !
1316724177550876678 2020-10-15 20:54:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So the French don't always get it right either !
1316722512319991808 2020-10-15 20:48:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @BBCPolitics Well said !
1316722129539403776 2020-10-15 20:46:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are playing into their hands by extending!
1316721702227894274 2020-10-15 20:44:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @BoerboelUK @Keir_Starmer @MetroUK I would like to see Hugh Grant playing Saville ! It would be a challenge !
1316721033060253697 2020-10-15 20:42:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please do us all a favour and shut up and bugger off! You are not wanted!
1316720799269744641 2020-10-15 20:41:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Helen, but in a normal interaction that would be completely unacceptable ! She is a rude person making money out of being vile. Who wants to listen to this witch?
1316720446667132928 2020-10-15 20:39:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly Maureen ! No one is forcing people to socialise outside of their  https://t.co/JK45Mn8IfI is  a personal choice!
1316719592421683200 2020-10-15 20:36:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There were a lot of important people including senior police officers who were protecting him !
1316718413872615424 2020-10-15 20:31:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SteveParker1971 A shambolic state of affairs !
1316718073987072003 2020-10-15 20:30:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers the granny says you can shove it up your precious arse !
1316717479666868225 2020-10-15 20:28:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gosh ! 🙉🙉🙉
1316717228243460097 2020-10-15 20:27:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What gain ? He is confirming people low opinion of himself ! He is much talked up by some but can't see the justification
1316636357108871168 2020-10-15 15:05:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree ! Doctor Gorgeous is not so gorgeous anymore and let us not forget what he said about masks back in March saying they were useless. He has never explained why he changed his mind !😕😕
1316635791955812354 2020-10-15 15:03:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course people from Glasgow get special treatment !
1316635182078857216 2020-10-15 15:01:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This woman makes a living shit stirring !
1316635092735926272 2020-10-15 15:00:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Laurence Fox is too much of a gentleman and too intelligent to stoop to her levels. The less he said the worse she came out !
1316634755434188800 2020-10-15 14:59:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling ! Missed you on twitter yesterday !
1316633576130187264 2020-10-15 14:54:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Eve_Wickens You are looking great !
1316633358542176257 2020-10-15 14:53:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope that charismatic George Galloway manages to regroup all the opposition parties. They need to unite for this common cause .
1316632780697210881 2020-10-15 14:51:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !
1316632590133100544 2020-10-15 14:50:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> None whatsoever!
1316632280752951296 2020-10-15 14:49:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope he has big balls!
1316632082458779648 2020-10-15 14:48:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Margaret !😀😀
1316631939021930496 2020-10-15 14:48:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thankfully no!
1316631816800010241 2020-10-15 14:47:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A sense irony the lady hasn't go . She is so much up her own backside she can't see it !
1316631610264039425 2020-10-15 14:46:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All tyrants eventually meet their fate ! Give her a long enough noose and she will hang herself. She should learn from history!
1316630796300673024 2020-10-15 14:43:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they don't want you to get a word in !
1316628557540601857 2020-10-15 14:34:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on !
1316627824967643137 2020-10-15 14:31:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Paul !
1316627657153482753 2020-10-15 14:31:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Traditionally a generation is at least 25 years ! maybe someone should inform wee Nippy of this fact !
1316626566651228162 2020-10-15 14:26:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shame on the liberal fanatic Cressida !
1316626229517332481 2020-10-15 14:25:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They will have to learn otherwise !
1316625826104868870 2020-10-15 14:23:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is thinking : " What a spanner I have been and how do I get out of this . "
1316625429156057088 2020-10-15 14:22:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right ! This is a shambles because no one really knows what to do !
1316625113970769921 2020-10-15 14:21:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It should not be Difficult ! Been a QC you would expect more from Starmer but I expect that elevation to be one is more who you know...
1316624498460942336 2020-10-15 14:18:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the BBC is going to be scrupulous with the facts it will surely be a great embarrassment to them. Curious choice of drama.
1316624010071937025 2020-10-15 14:16:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Clare !
1316623840106164225 2020-10-15 14:15:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I feel for you Connor.  Down in London things are little clearer at the moment but who knows what is round the corner. Stay strong !
1316623638934716417 2020-10-15 14:15:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nice neighbours and ridiculous police who have no interest in actual crime.
1316623181449490432 2020-10-15 14:13:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why has everything in the world turned so toxic in the last few years ?
1316622856785190912 2020-10-15 14:12:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a bunch of vile paedos !
1316621742203383808 2020-10-15 14:07:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look out Master Chef for your next series ! You have to have a black winner it is the law!
1316620620684300288 2020-10-15 14:03:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us cancel Nelson Mandela as well then !
1316620378475835392 2020-10-15 14:02:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Rosie !
1316477692749983746 2020-10-15 04:35:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We would love to see it!
1316429569470214144 2020-10-15 01:24:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1316399676732649473 2020-10-14 23:25:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think George you have just summed up all the inconvenient impediments which are studiously ignored by the SNP.
1316397383887056896 2020-10-14 23:16:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s nice !😋
1316357886830956546 2020-10-14 20:39:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thieves usually fall out !
1316357164332613634 2020-10-14 20:36:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !
1316356487351070725 2020-10-14 20:33:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cathy Newman only came on GMB to plug her new book!
1316356348427280385 2020-10-14 20:33:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very welcome darling !
1316356208996028416 2020-10-14 20:32:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You would !
1316355918876020736 2020-10-14 20:31:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Give him the facts as he seems pretty ignorant of them.
1316355431766388745 2020-10-14 20:29:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What has happened to the once in a generation pledge? six years does not make a generation.
1316355250958274560 2020-10-14 20:28:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As always Mark you offer a balanced and humane view of our present situation. 😍
1316354974243323904 2020-10-14 20:27:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1316354768294629376 2020-10-14 20:26:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He should not even be in his post. There should be an interim committee till the next mayoral election next May !
1316354415394263041 2020-10-14 20:25:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she is Jim but she is given too much air time. Who is really listening to this viper ?
1316339072013664256 2020-10-14 19:24:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1316331325163556864 2020-10-14 18:53:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely !
1316329082909609985 2020-10-14 18:44:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They never do !😄😄
1316328680243826689 2020-10-14 18:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @piersmorgan Disgusted !
1316327840766402562 2020-10-14 18:39:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Joanna !
1316327129819361287 2020-10-14 18:36:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth is no one listens to Starmer not even his own MPS. He has the personality of a dead cod !🐟🐟🐟🐟
1316326196062433281 2020-10-14 18:33:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1316325475870965762 2020-10-14 18:30:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is it then ?So it is an open, friendly all inclusive country, that is why they tell their neighbours the English too F..off at the border !
1316324834335428609 2020-10-14 18:27:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is happening with Hammersmith bridge ? He can't even sort out his own laundry!
1316324542139240449 2020-10-14 18:26:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What an annoying narrow minded privileged Asian woman.  Laurence Fox appeared very gentleman like and measured. She could learn manners from him ! Who listens to this wish ?
1316322730816438277 2020-10-14 18:19:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely !😂😂😂
1316322199519793153 2020-10-14 18:17:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yeah right ! Where is Khan's begging bowl ?
1316321814281367553 2020-10-14 18:15:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You old cynic ! 😂
1316321595670102016 2020-10-14 18:14:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not ! and after two weeks then what ?

1316308006255161346 2020-10-14 17:20:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You may be right!
1316305897753280512 2020-10-14 17:12:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!
1316292726523076609 2020-10-14 16:20:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not strange but predictable. The BBC seems to studiously ignore the whole thing.
1316292088867311616 2020-10-14 16:17:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BLM is an American export so knows nothing about British history and the BLM people over here are very ignorant about  history.
1316281278455574528 2020-10-14 15:34:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you darling!

1316255973108051968 2020-10-14 13:54:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Give it a bone Piers! What are you playing at ? I'll tell you what, insane vindictiveness and it is not a pretty sight!
1316254365234212866 2020-10-14 13:47:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It has happened in quite a few European countries and we could be next !
1316253416029663233 2020-10-14 13:44:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They should hang their heads in shame !
1316252478845878272 2020-10-14 13:40:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely disgusting ! Kafka is alive and well in Britain !
1316250940039729152 2020-10-14 13:34:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Charity should begin at home !

1316060220649607168 2020-10-14 00:56:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it does not but there is not long to go!
1316059727072239618 2020-10-14 00:54:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Priceless!😋
1316059000140705792 2020-10-14 00:51:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know how you feel!
1316057177887592450 2020-10-14 00:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a nightmare scenario!
1316056088916221959 2020-10-14 00:39:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am with you !
1316055856170127360 2020-10-14 00:39:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think Starmer’s pronouncements are going to go down in certain quarters. Another non vote winner.
1316054205958893568 2020-10-14 00:32:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are right!
1316011484669857797 2020-10-13 21:42:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! How ironic !  https://t.co/3iM4P9HcaT
1316010366875303937 2020-10-13 21:38:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is just outrageous ! Even the Spanish influenza was not  as catastrophic !
1316009532275847169 2020-10-13 21:34:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Anders !
1316005404682473472 2020-10-13 21:18:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should hope so
1316004097074626562 2020-10-13 21:13:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Your crazy world!
1315999847296753664 2020-10-13 20:56:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course they won’t!
1315996493141233666 2020-10-13 20:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant and so true!
1315994495553622017 2020-10-13 20:35:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1315992645227950080 2020-10-13 20:27:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1315990174409654273 2020-10-13 20:18:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can guarantee there won't be a monument to Khan in 50 years time, but Nelson 's column will still be there !
1315989746037002242 2020-10-13 20:16:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> F ... you Khan !
1315989228682186753 2020-10-13 20:14:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂🤣😅🤣🤣🤣
1315988958183075840 2020-10-13 20:13:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a lovely message !
1315988708366188544 2020-10-13 20:12:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> true.
1315988413011591177 2020-10-13 20:11:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I guess I am in the corner !😊😊
1315987246189883393 2020-10-13 20:06:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell those stupid bastards in the National Maritime Museum.
1315986778340429825 2020-10-13 20:04:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The gipsy name for a hedgehog is a Hodger pig ! ( not sure about the spelling)
1315986066722246656 2020-10-13 20:01:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> My only knowledge of Glasgow is Rabbles C Nesbitt and the wonderful novels of Denise Mina. They are tough cookies your lassies but I guess they have to be. I hope romance is still alive in Glasgow.
1315985557235937280 2020-10-13 19:59:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The picture will be black. It will not be a white Christmas!
1315984476812517377 2020-10-13 19:55:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well sai ! As always double standard Morgan ! Hypocrite does not cover it . He is actually not worth commenting on !
1315983523543744512 2020-10-13 19:51:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are on !😂
1315982872520556550 2020-10-13 19:49:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So you Scots prefer the Rap C Nesbitt style headbutt to French kissing ? I pity the Glasgow lasses !🤣🙂
1315981656831004674 2020-10-13 19:44:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totally agree. People who use the word "nazi" are usually supremely ignorant of the meaning of the word. People also use the word facist in a wrong way. The Left calls anyone who doesn't agree with them is branded a facist. Ridiculous !
1315981132631080966 2020-10-13 19:42:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have followed you !🙂
1315965322088906752 2020-10-13 18:39:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good one!😂
1315962753039949825 2020-10-13 18:29:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks vile ! Brown stains !
1315961663837925376 2020-10-13 18:24:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @sea_bouy @toryboypierce Exactly !
1315960986789187584 2020-10-13 18:22:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please !
1315960626657792000 2020-10-13 18:20:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We know that just by looking at the ads
1315960407459270663 2020-10-13 18:19:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too !🤣
1315953304388730881 2020-10-13 17:51:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We maybe should not mock the afflicted?
1315951353395662849 2020-10-13 17:43:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not surprising!
1315946597923004416 2020-10-13 17:24:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Leave it to your imagination!
1315930314607296641 2020-10-13 16:20:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They might now understand the feelings of our fishermen when they sold out to the EU so mes Amis get used to it!
1315928404936589312 2020-10-13 16:12:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some don’t and never will!
1315925457863348224 2020-10-13 16:00:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have a brain of the size of a pea Morgan! Accept it!
1315906319023517696 2020-10-13 14:44:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Stand proud Connor !
1315904601439297542 2020-10-13 14:37:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you darling!😋
1315904166141792256 2020-10-13 14:36:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Clare!
1315895982970806277 2020-10-13 14:03:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1315894855667769344 2020-10-13 13:59:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Khan says if we completely block the roads and completely grid lock London we can turn this around ! Who needs road transport in London? Let us go back to horse and cart.
1315892293505896448 2020-10-13 13:49:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I am !😊🤣
1315891767003222016 2020-10-13 13:46:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Bernie ! Hope you are well !🙂🙂
1315890528354029569 2020-10-13 13:42:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because the Scots have been promised for many years that Independence will magically solve all their ills and Caledonia will rise again !
1315889545003630592 2020-10-13 13:38:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is difficult to say who you can rely on to do this.
1315889310122602496 2020-10-13 13:37:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I too wasn't born here but this is the country I love and respect above else.
1315889006417248256 2020-10-13 13:36:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You should respect your elders but wisdom does not necessarily come with age.
1315888664275230720 2020-10-13 13:34:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> William actually had a brain put in unlike his gormless brother!
1315888352403566593 2020-10-13 13:33:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why should anyone listen to a third rate muck raker?
1315887897564905473 2020-10-13 13:31:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Morgan what about all these countries on the continent who adopted all these measures you are banging on about and still have serious problems. What is your considered medical opinion about that ?
1315887194335326208 2020-10-13 13:28:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because the BBC always supports minorities at. the expense of all else.
1315886816701091841 2020-10-13 13:27:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So what is Morgan suggesting as a solution ? closing down everything for a whole year? The really sad thing is Morgan thinks he is an intelligent person.
1315885602739494913 2020-10-13 13:22:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's all you need, isn't it ?🙁🙁🙁
1315885135846350848 2020-10-13 13:20:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely !
1315885014442180608 2020-10-13 13:20:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So who are these youngsters going to vote for then ? The Labour Party? really?
1315883872006090752 2020-10-13 13:15:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You too darling !
1315728752618483713 2020-10-13 02:59:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe more than one eh!
1315694993026281472 2020-10-13 00:45:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True!🙈🙈
1315690450737659904 2020-10-13 00:27:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂
1315688855014645760 2020-10-13 00:20:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I used to follow you on Facebook but you are not on it anymore.  “ Still Midnight “ was the first of your books I read and from then on I was hooked.😋
1315685478130241540 2020-10-13 00:07:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You tell them Andy 😋
1315678506043535360 2020-10-12 23:39:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly the hypocrite!
1315672629634838528 2020-10-12 23:16:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know. Maybe Mrs Merkel could have a wee word with him, put him in his place.
1315668547159371782 2020-10-12 23:00:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just wanted to say Denise that I am absolutely loving reading your latest book. Wonderful!😋
1315667358434852866 2020-10-12 22:55:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sincerely hope not!
1315660964801511425 2020-10-12 22:29:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That may well be Sturgeon ‘s plan.
1315660430895972354 2020-10-12 22:27:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Boring and self serving!
1315659048327487490 2020-10-12 22:22:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Biden is probably about when he was a lad during the American Civil War.
1315657929496948736 2020-10-12 22:17:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite !
1315643209553510401 2020-10-12 21:19:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Government has total disrespect for the white majority in this country .
1315643025113128960 2020-10-12 21:18:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is this country coming to ?
1315632351175675905 2020-10-12 20:36:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @MorrisseyHelena @channel5_tv The BBC is losing the plot and Channel 5 is gaining it ! Very smart!
1315632038725267457 2020-10-12 20:34:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The rules have changed but the French just can't believe it !
1315631253664739333 2020-10-12 20:31:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know what you mean and it can be frustrating .
1315630892195479553 2020-10-12 20:30:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Your arse most probably deserves an honour more than he does !😂
1315628127993958400 2020-10-12 20:19:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He has some competition there with the twat of the year award.
1315627632495656961 2020-10-12 20:17:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She will be dragged out kicking and screaming! She is addicted to strutting around like a banana republic dictator. It won't end well it never does.
1315626573207404544 2020-10-12 20:13:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Tony_Yorkshire I would not worry too much. My car tells me to take a break every couple of miles !😂😂
1315626225705025536 2020-10-12 20:11:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's a bit late love !
1315625791737167872 2020-10-12 20:10:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Tony_Yorkshire It is trying to tell you something, I am not sure what !😂😂
1315625429248737280 2020-10-12 20:08:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are right !
1315623806241828865 2020-10-12 20:02:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course he will be always our national hero besides the  whining of the current breed of Marxist shit stirrers and he  will be remembered centuries after these imbeciles will be forgotten.
1315621454306856960 2020-10-12 19:52:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Really Steve ! There is a little point because Piers would not let them speak, would constantly interrupt an show his usual exquisite manners !
1315620302861238273 2020-10-12 19:48:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And gorgeous they are too !
1315618869990563841 2020-10-12 19:42:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How could the queen possibly ignore and not reward such a caring talented individual ?😂😂😂
1315617198174613505 2020-10-12 19:35:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> On the other hand we have a situation where the opposition has been such a load of useless trash?
1315595391841206272 2020-10-12 18:09:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good !
1315594564195975169 2020-10-12 18:06:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we have a good idea of the surgical procedure involved .
1315594052658753538 2020-10-12 18:03:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are so far up their own rectums I fear they will not ever be able to extricate themselves but who really cares?
1315593566144655362 2020-10-12 18:02:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Talk about been caught on a fence ! This is extraordinary nonsense for a forensic QC !
1315593003046776832 2020-10-12 17:59:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What do you mean by "great country" ? I thought this  country has always been and is now a racist hellhole according to some !
1315592497100455936 2020-10-12 17:57:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1315592032111472640 2020-10-12 17:55:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought paedophiles were frowned up in this country!
1315590367736102919 2020-10-12 17:49:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We always had a Lord Mayor but who. needs a mayor like Khan ?
1315590175230230528 2020-10-12 17:48:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on !
1315587982582263808 2020-10-12 17:39:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! They should think themselves lucky they haven't be shot or deported.
1315587650481520640 2020-10-12 17:38:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Another suggested honour for Morgan services to doom mongering and self  promotion !
1315585826747748352 2020-10-12 17:31:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Piers Morgan should receive a special honour “Lord of the flies”.
1315584787252490240 2020-10-12 17:27:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The voice of reason as always! No histrionics just common sense.
1315570123235823616 2020-10-12 16:28:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he should walk away!
1315550581851934720 2020-10-12 15:11:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> His gob and his ego are too big!
1315540832641052672 2020-10-12 14:32:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling!
1315527925366652929 2020-10-12 13:41:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great record !
1315526321481617409 2020-10-12 13:34:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They can try all they want but the truth will out !
1315526050630250501 2020-10-12 13:33:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a lesson for all politicians. One stupid act will haunt you for ever !
1315524559483924480 2020-10-12 13:27:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You were a bit younger in the 1930's !😃😃😃
1315523723227787269 2020-10-12 13:24:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some Americans want to trash their own history , this will not end well.
1315522137516638208 2020-10-12 13:18:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @COLRICHARDKEMP I would not relish the prospect of naval battles if I were him ! Has he seen HMS Queen Elisabeth? Quel con !
1315327994639060992 2020-10-12 00:26:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1315326359779119110 2020-10-12 00:20:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe I have!🤨
1315325453712986112 2020-10-12 00:16:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Really!🙈🙈🙈🙈
1315301932345569280 2020-10-11 22:43:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for sharing your experience.
1315298962899980288 2020-10-11 22:31:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but for how long?
1315297645167104002 2020-10-11 22:26:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love testicles!
1315269232549081088 2020-10-11 20:33:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very saucy you are !
1315268284992937985 2020-10-11 20:29:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely! Unfortunately she will have to be dragged out screaming !
1315267222357643266 2020-10-11 20:25:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The North Circular as far as I am concerned.
1315266586035605504 2020-10-11 20:22:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1315266255247601664 2020-10-11 20:21:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The clue Jeremy is that when you drive across the borders and they are men with placards saying F ... off English ! A good hearted welcoming race !
1315264871290867712 2020-10-11 20:15:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @georgegalloway That's fair enough !
1315264508731031552 2020-10-11 20:14:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She won't though ! Too much of an attention seeker !
1315263873382047746 2020-10-11 20:11:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Meghan and Harry are even more unpopular in America now with their blatant support of the democrats.
1315262894582398976 2020-10-11 20:08:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well Ian, would you be happy with the alternative?
1315262206641164290 2020-10-11 20:05:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Am I the only one who is sick of professional victims!
1315259966224240640 2020-10-11 19:56:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The writer Graham Hancock
1315259253620387843 2020-10-11 19:53:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The real surprise is why some of these are still living here. A fine example is Paul O'Grady who was going to leave and  live in Venice. He is apparently living in Kent.All gob is bollocks!
1315258610591633408 2020-10-11 19:51:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1315258224602427392 2020-10-11 19:49:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who knows ? It is possible .
1315257522572464128 2020-10-11 19:46:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No one would dare stop those two. Perhaps Lammy is a secret drug dealer.
1315257102483574785 2020-10-11 19:45:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A bit more patience Paul but I agree that things are not looking good for little mother Scotland !
1315250096083271680 2020-10-11 19:17:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have a good point!
1315248465526632448 2020-10-11 19:10:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Liverpool is an university town and obviously some people in the North East have not been following social distancing. What other reason could they be?
1315247870795186181 2020-10-11 19:08:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Her bestie  nippy should make her understand she must resign! How could she go back to Westminster?
1315224902228606977 2020-10-11 17:37:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1315189962812387328 2020-10-11 15:18:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely!
1315184363118657536 2020-10-11 14:56:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes just pop in and have a chat with your GP! Good luck with that!
1315184114262253569 2020-10-11 14:55:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps the BLM would like to remain our country "Slavetannia".
1315183743800414209 2020-10-11 14:53:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we all are ! This is getting worse by the day, what next ?
1315183461683077121 2020-10-11 14:52:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> One hell of a blip !
1315183054541946882 2020-10-11 14:50:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😀😀😀😀😀😀
1315182833850351621 2020-10-11 14:49:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I agree with you. They just don't understand ordinary people and don't want to !
1315182493327335424 2020-10-11 14:48:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1315181971044216833 2020-10-11 14:46:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here we go Boris! You stick to the human right laws !
1315181410563641344 2020-10-11 14:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well sais ! The very idea is actually ridiculous and can be manipulated endlessly by trouble makers.
1315180952608542721 2020-10-11 14:42:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A question for the Scots what is the difference between Alba, Scotia and Caledonia? Are they all the same thing and which would you like to be called?
1315180173621329920 2020-10-11 14:39:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Big big mistake if we continue to have anything to do with this rabble. Don't let us down on this .
1315179797119725569 2020-10-11 14:37:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well we knew the BBC was losing the plot completely!
1315178483522433024 2020-10-11 14:32:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes please !
1315177792208883712 2020-10-11 14:29:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And yet another catalogue of your weak excuses.
1315177233808592897 2020-10-11 14:27:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Senior chief police officers have a lot to answer for . I think its time they were all  replaced. We don't want the thought police and its time they realise this !
1315175823125741569 2020-10-11 14:22:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So yet another British institution has been infiltrated by BLM supporters who seem intent on trashing our culture and history, No doubt they would like to replace his statue on Trafalgar Square with a slave.
1315174525303173120 2020-10-11 14:16:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes she should and she will disgrace the Royal family.
1315173629638971397 2020-10-11 14:13:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is anyone surprised why virus figures are going up in the North. Muslims don't tend to go to pubs and restaurants.
1315173244878684161 2020-10-11 14:11:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Durrels
1315173044265025538 2020-10-11 14:11:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Benny !
1315172761904525312 2020-10-11 14:09:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Margaret has not slept for 10 days because she has been up all night thinking up stupid excuses. Shameless or what ?
1315172426653880320 2020-10-11 14:08:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dear, dear, dear !
1315172183421988864 2020-10-11 14:07:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> NFI !
1315172065650053121 2020-10-11 14:07:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It says a lot about what kind of friends Nicola has ! Birds of a feather .......
1314973131946237953 2020-10-11 00:56:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Honestly!!!🙈🙈🙈
1314971111264784384 2020-10-11 00:48:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Harsh !
1314970966489997312 2020-10-11 00:48:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Same here! That’s one step too far!😡😡
1314965715657658369 2020-10-11 00:27:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks yummy! Enjoy!
1314939018178592768 2020-10-10 22:41:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely !
1314938903590305792 2020-10-10 22:40:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Scotland needs a break from her !
1314909152280563712 2020-10-10 20:42:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873>  https://t.co/0tMKpbXOOF
1314906602424733696 2020-10-10 20:32:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course she is . She is going nowhere!
1314903107508338688 2020-10-10 20:18:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Effie will they ever learn?
1314902573263052800 2020-10-10 20:16:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have a way with words and this vile individual could have been prime minister and we complain about Boris!
1314901873044992002 2020-10-10 20:13:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As anyone noticed that channel 5 has assumed the mantel of the "old" BBC with their programming? The silly BBC has left a massive gap in the market.
1314901358106030080 2020-10-10 20:11:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unlike the original it is very one sided !
1314900382070472710 2020-10-10 20:07:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's a bit of an understatement.
1314900170404962304 2020-10-10 20:06:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Happy but not grateful !
1314899571508736000 2020-10-10 20:04:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1314898980082507776 2020-10-10 20:02:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nos ennemis !
1314898805855223808 2020-10-10 20:01:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a lovely painting ! Very moving
1314897718888857602 2020-10-10 19:57:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer on the other hand does not do U turns he just changes directions ( apparently)
1314896419246034944 2020-10-10 19:51:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem is that they dare not criticise the perpetrators! Shame on them for their lack of moral courage!
1314895768466186243 2020-10-10 19:49:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So all this is threatening the journalists' very existence. So the Police are going to devote all their resources to thought crimes.
1314894000923586561 2020-10-10 19:42:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @BoerboelUK @SadiqKhan The hobbit is one of the untouchables but he has outstayed his welcome !
1314893471258497029 2020-10-10 19:40:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And they are getting a pay rise for sitting at home!
1314892705999323141 2020-10-10 19:37:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Adorable !🦆🦆🦆🦆
1314892292122202117 2020-10-10 19:35:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We would still be in the same impasse in four years time. The EU would be very happy to drag the negotiations for ever !
1314891963187986433 2020-10-10 19:34:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is wee nippy grateful though?
1314891823614226432 2020-10-10 19:33:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sincerely hope so ! The SNP are very divisive and dangerous organisation.
1314891617707462658 2020-10-10 19:32:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1314891380498534404 2020-10-10 19:31:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Big brother is well and alive and it is becoming seriously frightening!
1314890885386121216 2020-10-10 19:29:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks darling !😊
1314890792213807104 2020-10-10 19:29:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Change the record Piers ! How many thousand times have you said the same thing! Your are like the sad old git in the corner of the pub talking to himself!
1314890434691371009 2020-10-10 19:28:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not mock the afflicted !
1314889749967056901 2020-10-10 19:25:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes ! What's has happened to freedom of expression? This is a peculiar version of 1984 !
1314827160906067969 2020-10-10 15:16:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course not  !
1314819173588127744 2020-10-10 14:44:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can only talk from personal experience.
1314808332352454656 2020-10-10 14:01:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you darling , you too !
1314807441809453059 2020-10-10 13:58:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning Clare !
1314807203170222081 2020-10-10 13:57:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely !😀
1314806990401568768 2020-10-10 13:56:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have done so !
1314806430831181825 2020-10-10 13:54:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He has made his choice !
1314805860414226432 2020-10-10 13:51:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bloody disaster !
1314803698594443265 2020-10-10 13:43:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Glasgow resident not happy with current regulations.  https://t.co/FoURDMgK2z
1314800823277363201 2020-10-10 13:31:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A lot of Americans are supremely ignorant about the rest of the world of the world. I have actually hear an American ask if we spoke English in England and he thought Scotland was in England and also they stopped buying Scottish pullovers because of the mad cow disease.
1314799810952802304 2020-10-10 13:27:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and I don't want to see the anti British geriatric Biden get the presidentship .
1314799471369355266 2020-10-10 13:26:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said. Doctor Starkey has been disgracefully treated by Academia who are all desperate to display their anti racist credentials. What's happened to freedom of speech ?
1314798746400677888 2020-10-10 13:23:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Things are changing for the better ! Maybe the penny will finally drop !
1314798421073637376 2020-10-10 13:22:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it is far too racist a term and will upset the BLM
1314797985868533760 2020-10-10 13:20:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Looks like this journalist is going to be cancelled. When did our normal police force turn into the 1984 thought police. Ordinary crime is cancelled in favour of investigating cases for the BLM.
1314797088568479744 2020-10-10 13:17:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this a forensic judgement from a highly educated QC ? Not impressive. Shit stirring !
1314796436299616256 2020-10-10 13:14:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wonder how many bearded Children we are still getting ?
1314796027153588226 2020-10-10 13:12:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why on earth should Kamal Harris have to explain such a non issue ?
1314795160727965696 2020-10-10 13:09:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a gallery of undesirables with a lot to say !
1314794516927442945 2020-10-10 13:06:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our mayor is an incompetent disgrace and indeed should not even still be in his position.
1314794087158030336 2020-10-10 13:05:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good point ! Some groups are favoured no doubt about it !
1314793662832836608 2020-10-10 13:03:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wee Nippy is a very sincere woman so we are told !
1314793221717979137 2020-10-10 13:01:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think it would have been sensible for MPs to decline this pay rise.
1314793088813068288 2020-10-10 13:01:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not !
1314792878611333120 2020-10-10 13:00:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1314792629083820034 2020-10-10 12:59:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As long as Cressida is in charge nothing will change.
1314792344462524417 2020-10-10 12:58:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes in the sense that she pretended to be what she wasn't ! She is a turncoat wrapped in the Union flag.
1314791004726194176 2020-10-10 12:52:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hopefully she will lose her seat.I am not sure Parliament wants to see her again !
1314790791424991233 2020-10-10 12:52:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No we must keep asking or she will get away with it !
1314790598457520128 2020-10-10 12:51:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A very sad state of affairs !
1314636993708556288 2020-10-10 02:40:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet you have too 🙈
1314636656532692993 2020-10-10 02:39:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wear it as a badge of honour!😋
1314595891928596481 2020-10-09 23:57:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I respect your opinion.
1314591372926738435 2020-10-09 23:39:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can only say that it has never affected me or anyone else I know.
1314591079224803328 2020-10-09 23:38:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can only go by what a GP told me. I have not had any reactions to the flu jab.
1314586551008079874 2020-10-09 23:20:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is nothing active in the vaccine. It cannot give you the flu.
1314573062516469761 2020-10-09 22:26:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s the spirit! Things will improve!🌼🌼
1314571941072777216 2020-10-09 22:22:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely! Justice for victims!
1314568272126373889 2020-10-09 22:07:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think it’s fake news but who knows?🤨🤨
1314566647852736512 2020-10-09 22:01:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for you! The best things in life are free, love and friendship top of the list.Loyalty so important!😋😋
1314566279429320704 2020-10-09 21:59:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We can’t yet 😔😔😔
1314565687717892096 2020-10-09 21:57:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course you don’t! 😋
1314551768077004801 2020-10-09 21:02:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And he's about as interesting ! Mister expressionless!
1314551428971724800 2020-10-09 21:00:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought Nicola was a big girl now !
1314551210058420224 2020-10-09 21:00:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Like many other institutions The National Trust has shot itself in the foot!
1314550511597694983 2020-10-09 20:57:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So predictable BBC !
1314549298340810754 2020-10-09 20:52:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Listen to George Galloway Boris !
1314548488164737024 2020-10-09 20:49:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough it's totally normal . We know you are a leftie lawyer but this is ridiculous !
1314514550847426561 2020-10-09 18:34:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I understand !🙂
1314504022359932928 2020-10-09 17:52:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dare I ask what for?😋
1314464468026482688 2020-10-09 15:15:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! This whole idea is complete nonsense. It’s fashionable virtue signalling which is getting up every one’s nose!
1314440794850447360 2020-10-09 13:41:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They never want to adapt wherever they go. They just want to transform it. to suit themselves.
1314440305320615941 2020-10-09 13:39:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> BLM
1314439484596006912 2020-10-09 13:36:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are we not banning it straight away !
1314438979610185729 2020-10-09 13:34:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good point ! whereas in England no one is persecuted for their accent, Scottish or otherwise.
1314438472904646657 2020-10-09 13:32:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Witty she ain't ! Reminds one of Chairman Mao's audience! Nobody dares not clap.
1314437519061245953 2020-10-09 13:28:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is absolutely no evidence of this maybe wishful thinking ! She enjoys the power too much !
1314436643307356161 2020-10-09 13:24:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A couple of seconds is enough !
1314436457189302272 2020-10-09 13:24:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When the Conservatives change their minds it is still always and embarrassing U turn!
1314435043650162689 2020-10-09 13:18:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you ! You too!
1314434311102308352 2020-10-09 13:15:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @standardnews For once the penny has dropped !
1314432501734088704 2020-10-09 13:08:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Students would make so much fuss saying that their lives are been ruined !
1314431719597051909 2020-10-09 13:05:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gracias Connor y tu también !
1314263649045934080 2020-10-09 01:57:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She might be a useful distraction.
1314176949129023488 2020-10-08 20:12:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If she was a Tory she would be gone a long a time ago after been vilified by the whole media.
1314176715904749573 2020-10-08 20:11:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet again the silly country speaks!
1314176281542627328 2020-10-08 20:10:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please don't come back unless you ditch the witch !
1314175688417726465 2020-10-08 20:07:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That you will never hear !
1314174747098390529 2020-10-08 20:04:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never, never, we are all racists didn't you know?
1314173756839952385 2020-10-08 20:00:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The answer is sadly yes! Why is Mcguire not rolling his eyes  and mentioning her ?
1314171023336583171 2020-10-08 19:49:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> David, you don't seem at all interested in white working class people ? What kind of labour MP are you ?
1314170666166489088 2020-10-08 19:47:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How predictable !
1314169496391876608 2020-10-08 19:43:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not so great for every one else you little vixen!
1314161300671520769 2020-10-08 19:10:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You would think Piers was 5 years old! So undignified!😂
1314141025414402048 2020-10-08 17:50:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1314098679977046017 2020-10-08 15:01:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s for sure!
1314093742056501249 2020-10-08 14:42:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t give up!😋
1314091323822149634 2020-10-08 14:32:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hopefully not 🙈🙈
1314090520692617217 2020-10-08 14:29:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It really is Jack 😋
1314088294444040193 2020-10-08 14:20:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonjour Bernie!
1314084420740055040 2020-10-08 14:05:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1314083850000257024 2020-10-08 14:02:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If your idea of a great national government is a banana republic go right ahead. However as you are presumably English they will telly to F.....off as a member of the hated race!
1314082899948433410 2020-10-08 13:59:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All the Scottish media depends on SNP patronage.
1314080372121051139 2020-10-08 13:49:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's common sense!
1314079635173453825 2020-10-08 13:46:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We keep hearing this but far from happening!
1314078199580680192 2020-10-08 13:40:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope Lord Frost sticks to this policy !
1314077776727638023 2020-10-08 13:38:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More like they can't get their local people to behave in a civilised manner and they know it !
1314077303912239105 2020-10-08 13:36:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU is up to its old tricks, delaying an agreement till the last minute and pushing through their own agenda.
1314075984463826945 2020-10-08 13:31:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have now come to the considered conclusion that Piers Morgan is a total bastard and I don't care who knows it!
1314075212741332992 2020-10-08 13:28:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately Gary there must be quite a few !
1314075073377120256 2020-10-08 13:28:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know that !
1314074519447973889 2020-10-08 13:25:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But the Scots somehow are different. This dream of independence in completely thwarting their judgement. You only have to sing "Flower of Scotland" and they are away to the fairies in the land of Walter Scott.
1314073620818341888 2020-10-08 13:22:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I sincerely hope you are wrong !
1314073267884486662 2020-10-08 13:20:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And indeed Kevin McGuire still mentions him daily!
1314072717524709376 2020-10-08 13:18:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it's not difficult !
1314072359695941634 2020-10-08 13:17:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> BBC I player is a sea of black faces in every category.
1314071806433726464 2020-10-08 13:15:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonjour Connor !
1313906370551390217 2020-10-08 02:17:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so!
1313901569801367552 2020-10-08 01:58:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I should bloody hope not! 🙈🙈🙈
1313896382747627520 2020-10-08 01:38:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes let’s do it !
1313890593727184896 2020-10-08 01:15:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid it is. 🤨🤨
1313889955375190016 2020-10-08 01:12:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No they are strangely absent 😋
1313869925879025664 2020-10-07 23:52:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course she will !
1313864625855909896 2020-10-07 23:31:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very clever!
1313864320934203394 2020-10-07 23:30:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Back at 06.00 AM then fresh as a daisy!🌼🌼
1313862389255868417 2020-10-07 23:22:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What you are off to bed already!😦😦
1313861550898319366 2020-10-07 23:19:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes but Nippy is not as educated as Jean Brodie!
1313859129669234690 2020-10-07 23:10:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> None of them!🙈🙈🙈
1313836919500034049 2020-10-07 21:41:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely !
1313836026889228288 2020-10-07 21:38:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> YES !
1313826135432667141 2020-10-07 20:58:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She certainly gets around 😂
1313819465440788485 2020-10-07 20:32:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The literary event of the year I think !🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1313818100035452930 2020-10-07 20:26:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's the religion of oppression and aggression!
1313817029628039168 2020-10-07 20:22:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙃🙃🙃🙃
1313816794763796488 2020-10-07 20:21:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I knew it !
1313815915780345857 2020-10-07 20:18:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is that sensible ?😀
1313815615711465472 2020-10-07 20:17:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pot and kettle eh !
1313815406528864256 2020-10-07 20:16:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> FU EU !
1313814824908972032 2020-10-07 20:13:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Buckfast , Mars bar and fish supper diet !
1313814443650961408 2020-10-07 20:12:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a specimen of manhood !
1313813812768894978 2020-10-07 20:09:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because Aberdeen does not over all support the SNP
1313811527552700418 2020-10-07 20:00:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately there must be a lot of abnormal Scots ! mind you it's for the first time the SNP have supported the Germans.
1313810700704321536 2020-10-07 19:57:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true ! and women have phenomenal memories too !
1313809786056724480 2020-10-07 19:53:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said ! Judith is a deluded individual but another of many Boris bashers !
1313809408179175424 2020-10-07 19:52:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ruth is brilliant ! Next to her the Sturgeon looks like a minnow!
1313808739015831554 2020-10-07 19:49:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have just watched the Commons live and it didn't look to me like Starmer was wiping the floor with Boris. Really !
1313807052372926470 2020-10-07 19:43:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @BillEtheridgeuk This was a very silly thing to say !
1313806638877487106 2020-10-07 19:41:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are better off without him !
1313806174400253952 2020-10-07 19:39:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy your break ! I am sure it is well deserved !
1313798835899072518 2020-10-07 19:10:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋
1313761326179770368 2020-10-07 16:41:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it does !
1313761093236543492 2020-10-07 16:40:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are right it is a waste  of time watching it! One of my guilty pleasures!😋
1313733629785276417 2020-10-07 14:51:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Congratulations!
1313727226093936641 2020-10-07 14:25:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not!
1313726513280417792 2020-10-07 14:23:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Honestly Robert you are so funny 😋
1313718177386369024 2020-10-07 13:49:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Holly!
1313717666541076480 2020-10-07 13:47:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is this the new party uniform ? Where are the armbands?
1313717458600157184 2020-10-07 13:47:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are quite right but I can't see either of these things happening !
1313716463350550528 2020-10-07 13:43:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SummeryJen @NicolaSturgeon At least these pictures show that the Scots are capable of intelligent discussions, not !
1313716079445848066 2020-10-07 13:41:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't like anyone expressing the common view?
1313715838105591810 2020-10-07 13:40:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is that the Mcknobhead tartan ?
1313715602545139712 2020-10-07 13:39:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck to you Laurence ! We need more people like you !
1313714622516457472 2020-10-07 13:35:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course the Government could not trust the SNP as they are traitors so willing to go squealing  to the EU.
1313714276339781633 2020-10-07 13:34:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nobody seems able to get. rid of her. Let's face facts if she didn't an awful lot of support in Scotland she would not be able to say. Mind you Hitler had a lot of support except after the war all there were no nazis anymore !
1313712871524708357 2020-10-07 13:28:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us hope you are right !
1313712562970783744 2020-10-07 13:27:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In fact BLM is destructive and M&amp; S and Guiness and all the others why are you supporting it ?
1313712336050544640 2020-10-07 13:26:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The modern world is crap really, isn't it ?
1313711697010610176 2020-10-07 13:24:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Top of the morning to you Bernie !
1313711340968648704 2020-10-07 13:22:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Answer : It's all  Boris's fault , nothing to do with me !
1313710924423999489 2020-10-07 13:21:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quality broadcasting ? Really ? more like rancid muck racking !
1313521751813431297 2020-10-07 00:49:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1313506580537708545 2020-10-06 23:49:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Piers Morgan is deluded in thinking he is important. Actually every week his program becomes more boring and repetitive.
1313504817151709185 2020-10-06 23:42:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes brilliant series! There is going to be a second series .
1313500375882792961 2020-10-06 23:24:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy your reading!😋
1313481253405044736 2020-10-06 22:08:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Before I let you go, look out for another one of hers”Still Midnight “!Rendell is my all time favourite.😋
1313479475355693056 2020-10-06 22:01:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She’s a Glasgow writer. “ The Red Road” is particulate good. She has a strong social conscience and is also a terrific story teller.
1313478264015511558 2020-10-06 21:56:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can’t wait to read it! I have just got hold of Denise Mina’s latest “The less dead”. I have read all her books but then I am into crime fiction in a big way!
1313463427545919489 2020-10-06 20:57:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck George !
1313462934228660224 2020-10-06 20:55:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More like dumb shit house !
1313462696797507584 2020-10-06 20:54:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And the other favourite is "Now look!"
1313462016640778242 2020-10-06 20:52:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He has gravely disappointed the left ! Dominic West won't be jumping for joy now .
1313461480155754496 2020-10-06 20:49:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the devil could cast its net!
1313461092585295875 2020-10-06 20:48:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1313460391192809474 2020-10-06 20:45:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I noticed that ! She has an unfortunate dental configuration !
1313457758004482050 2020-10-06 20:35:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totally agree with you and it is infuriating!
1313435577023442944 2020-10-06 19:06:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shut up Morgan ! The main problem with the show when you are on it is that is so boring !
1313435080182976519 2020-10-06 19:05:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Dr Hilary has changed his tune but I don't think his opinion has changed.
1313434703052132353 2020-10-06 19:03:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a dismal spectacle she was ! According to Morgan she is very articulate and yet she talks like someone off at fish stall!
1313432748112183296 2020-10-06 18:55:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Margaret you are right ! He is apparently the best of a bad lot !
1313432482390462465 2020-10-06 18:54:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, her friend Sturgeon should expel her from the SNP and if not why not ? This woman is obviously a piece of work.
1313428061187117057 2020-10-06 18:37:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Strangely enough GMB is a noticeably much happier and relaxed show when Morgan is not there. Draw your own conclusions.
1313427201833029633 2020-10-06 18:33:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What all this shows is that the EU has a very uneasy view of its own worth?
1313426540047278081 2020-10-06 18:31:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Could she not have visited a mosque as well?
1313426195199991809 2020-10-06 18:29:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is the point of the Labour Party?
1313425695704481793 2020-10-06 18:27:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Morgan is reduced to having Bercow just to gain a few more cheap  Boris jibes! Talk about scraping the barrel of third rate content.

1313378007487217664 2020-10-06 15:18:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning Bernie!😀
1313361386207088645 2020-10-06 14:12:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> GMB this morning is not one of television ‘s greatest moments and Piers unfortunately is a very boring man with a false idea of his own importance.
1313353356635766784 2020-10-06 13:40:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !
1313352717868371968 2020-10-06 13:37:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @georgegalloway George you seem to be making a difference. Let us hope that the Scottish electorate are waking up to the reality of a corrupt and inefficient SNP.
1313351702565789697 2020-10-06 13:33:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not that I would have been watching it anyway!
1313347811577073664 2020-10-06 13:18:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have turned moaning into an art form! Have a great day!
1313346656272867329 2020-10-06 13:13:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wait till the snow comes then you will have something to moan about !😀
1313204348114083847 2020-10-06 03:48:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So beautiful and peaceful!
1313114172616568834 2020-10-05 21:49:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good one !
1313112153155678225 2020-10-05 21:41:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks!
1313105075200499713 2020-10-05 21:13:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s true ! It is uncontrollable 😂
1313099135667625986 2020-10-05 20:50:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These steroids are still affecting your gob!🤣
1313098812685275137 2020-10-05 20:48:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When is Nicola Thorp going to have a brain installed also she does not realise you are supposed to talk out of your mouth rather than out of your arse.
1313098228301205505 2020-10-05 20:46:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true but unbelievably these idiots could not see. I think they will do a U turn !
1313097866378915840 2020-10-05 20:45:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers were you not brought up properly! This is not a clever  remark it is plain rude. You do realise that Boris has plenty more things to think about than worry about your wounded ego.
1313096141391761409 2020-10-05 20:38:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hmmm let me think ! I would say if they deteriorate much more they will just disappear up their own virtually signalling rectums and won't be missed.
1313094043921010688 2020-10-05 20:29:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for your support Caroline. I could see that Becca is away to the fairies . You and I are Christians and we try not to mock the afflicted.
1313092808471908352 2020-10-05 20:24:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Are the BLM now totally untouchable by everything and every one and if so why? Enough is enough ! Mayor Khan will say nothing and we all know he wants the black vote!
1313091318206341121 2020-10-05 20:19:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Poor little sod, he is in tears because his playmate Boris won’t speak to him! Mentally Piers has not left the primary school playground!
1313090594772865024 2020-10-05 20:16:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s certainly better than an EU pleasing bad deal!
1313090200197836806 2020-10-05 20:14:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Grazie Mille Bella !
1313089925399576576 2020-10-05 20:13:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s time to try and move on from all this negative bollocks!
1313089157514907650 2020-10-05 20:10:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t lose your sense of humour!😋
1312989416542154752 2020-10-05 13:34:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is just unhinged Macarthyism ! She should be  ashamed of herself !
1312988473796833280 2020-10-05 13:30:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Another dubious poll !
1312985905859383297 2020-10-05 13:20:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> According to people like this labour MP all normal people are racist so I would not take any notice .
1312984209787584513 2020-10-05 13:13:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They must be getting fed up with wee nippy stoatin' aroond !
1312983648006795266 2020-10-05 13:11:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sorry about your friend. It must be very tough to lose someone close to you .
1312982329137287170 2020-10-05 13:05:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said ! At least you are starting to represent the majority  now !
1312981926047776770 2020-10-05 13:04:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a great day !
1312807770052325382 2020-10-05 01:32:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She’s no saint!😋
1312784945274814472 2020-10-05 00:01:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🤨🤨🤨
1312736285988130816 2020-10-04 20:48:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I politely thanked Becca for her opinions but I don't want to hear too many of them !
1312735268361908225 2020-10-04 20:44:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Becca !
1312733170748608513 2020-10-04 20:35:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it does !
1312732975013007361 2020-10-04 20:35:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No I wouldn't actually but thank for the concern !
1312732586670776320 2020-10-04 20:33:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious !
1312732146071732225 2020-10-04 20:31:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is no shortage !
1312730889282031616 2020-10-04 20:26:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You will be pleased to hear Becca that I too keep animals and plants alive . I do however eat both !
1312730419629092864 2020-10-04 20:24:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Becca for your kind concern. The sort of things that make me angry are shared by many. If you are happy with them that is fine with me.🙂
1312729560526487553 2020-10-04 20:21:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They do have an agenda. They don't like this government and they don't want Brexit.
1312728299018256386 2020-10-04 20:16:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would like to see the viewing figures for Lammy three hours show !
1312728142310764544 2020-10-04 20:15:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good point Trevor !
1312727546786721793 2020-10-04 20:13:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don't know about his surrogate father but we know who his real father was !
1312725603980840960 2020-10-04 20:05:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Positive action in France ! Let them pray in their mosques. Vive la France !
1312724242899836928 2020-10-04 20:00:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mr Corbyn why were you not beating back the black shirts in Brixton?
1312723336871514112 2020-10-04 19:56:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Oh I had forgotten all about that ! It's obviously fixed indelibly in your mind !
1312722050709164037 2020-10-04 19:51:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan you seem to have a pathological obsession with both Boris and Matt Hancock which is becoming unhealthy to say the least !
1312721044529086469 2020-10-04 19:47:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The only white history the BBC is keen on is slave owners and of course we were all involved in this !
1312713938333827072 2020-10-04 19:19:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer  is not allowed to have a strategy in case he upsets his Marxist masters. He is like a floundering cod out of waters!
1312712527785193476 2020-10-04 19:13:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> David Lammy your description of Boris sounds a great deal like yourself!

1312698334864445442 2020-10-04 18:17:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good point Mark! Some people just refuse to see the EU as they are really are.
1312697963865612289 2020-10-04 18:15:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid Boris is still too fat!
1312693248062894081 2020-10-04 17:57:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We had finally put a spanner in their original 1950’s master plan for a federal Europe.

1312685994412584960 2020-10-04 17:28:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am glad the new channel 5 “All creatures big and small” has proved such a massive hit! It wasn’t too white for them was it? The it didn’t fit in with the BBC’s agenda!
1312679849320906753 2020-10-04 17:03:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course it is!
1312678964117360640 2020-10-04 17:00:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> M&amp;S support the BLM for reasons best known to themselves but they haven’t insulted their customers yet!
1312678360355667969 2020-10-04 16:58:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> FUEU!
1312677939343962112 2020-10-04 16:56:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If this was a conservative MP there would be screaming for resignations, prosecutions, God knows what!
1312662080009506819 2020-10-04 15:53:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly !

1312647942386442240 2020-10-04 14:57:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Romans would have been astonished to see what happened to their tiny outpost Britannia !
1312647686798094336 2020-10-04 14:56:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's not rude in France, it's a pig sound effect !
1312647209758973952 2020-10-04 14:54:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do hope you are not gloating Piers, it's not a good look!

1312644978963869696 2020-10-04 14:45:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The remainosaurs are having a last minute panic attacks as the end draws near !
1312644067776516096 2020-10-04 14:41:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sainsbury's have publicly and stupidly shot themselves in the foot for reasons I can't begin to understand.
1312643111512952833 2020-10-04 14:38:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is anyone interested in their opinion?
1312642759745064960 2020-10-04 14:36:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ideal outfit for the fucking idiot market!
1312642419276607488 2020-10-04 14:35:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Slip of the.  tongue ! Carelessness or ignorance on the part of Sainsbury !
1312640140083372033 2020-10-04 14:26:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Meghan's husband how could such a success story happen in such a racist country as this one! Could it be that you and your wife are talking out of your derriere?
1312638844626522113 2020-10-04 14:21:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good speech !
1312638059146620928 2020-10-04 14:17:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And what about the damage the failing EU would do to us if we stayed.
1312637518463074305 2020-10-04 14:15:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There speaks the true voice of a the privileged Hampstead leftie !
1312636077157625856 2020-10-04 14:10:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Husband and spokesperson !
1312635863181000704 2020-10-04 14:09:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is plenty for both of them to comment on where they are living now !
1312441979054112770 2020-10-04 01:18:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very welcome!😋
1312437251901546496 2020-10-04 00:59:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely Andy!😋
1312431679043244032 2020-10-04 00:37:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly very true !
1312409328452763648 2020-10-03 23:09:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is so divisive and negative!
1312408039056642054 2020-10-03 23:03:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I understand that !
1312407616061046784 2020-10-03 23:02:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s very unfortunate because it can cost them dearly and make them look very unprofessional.
1312406140559523841 2020-10-03 22:56:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here, here!😋
1312405086287650816 2020-10-03 22:52:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Crocodile Dundee! Very sexy!😋
1312404134906204160 2020-10-03 22:48:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think a lot of us do!
1312403884179099648 2020-10-03 22:47:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously they have Pig ignorant twenty year olds doing their PR work. What next?
1312402151205998595 2020-10-03 22:40:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hardly! It would not be so bad if they had half a brain between them. They talk in platitudes and seem to inhabit a world of their own.
1312390244805881856 2020-10-03 21:53:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously not !😋
1312360999194853378 2020-10-03 19:56:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it shouldn't !
1312339861475667969 2020-10-03 18:32:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think you are missing the point completely! Yours is the logic of the mad house!
1312336323366223872 2020-10-03 18:18:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1312326538902282240 2020-10-03 17:40:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mine too!😦
1312306698472824833 2020-10-03 16:21:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I guess you are stuck with them!
1312291859667054594 2020-10-03 15:22:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bring back the Golly  https://t.co/HEDXByPvVQ
1312281815508492288 2020-10-03 14:42:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's an understatement !😀
1312279765504741377 2020-10-03 14:34:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He should be sacked on the grounds of incompetence and bad management. He is only an interim mayor anyway!
1312279089538109441 2020-10-03 14:31:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously ! I don't think she has any choice !
1312278451232165888 2020-10-03 14:28:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is just a way of describing their mannerisms,. The way they call each other darling etc. They are not of course not always so pleasant to each other or to one of their own who says the wrong thing!
1312277685511630848 2020-10-03 14:25:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The arrogance of the woman !
1312277254504841216 2020-10-03 14:24:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical of the mayor's weasel words!
1312276821711433729 2020-10-03 14:22:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Mr Phillips !
1312276489635856391 2020-10-03 14:21:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Answer came there none ! Also they struggle a bit with black inventors.
1312275919680176128 2020-10-03 14:18:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Liberals also haven't learnt the lesson!
1312274777495793664 2020-10-03 14:14:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What she did was far far worse !
1312273402917519361 2020-10-03 14:08:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What the hell are Sainsbury thinking ? The way they are going they are going to get a massive boycott of their usual shoppers.
1312271752333058048 2020-10-03 14:02:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @dunhillbabe The BBC and other medias love to present things in a skewed and alarmist way ! GMB was doing it yesterday!
1312271058465062913 2020-10-03 13:59:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Denmark !
1312093479615385601 2020-10-03 02:13:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Delicious!
1312087572064153602 2020-10-03 01:50:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You sound like a scratched record!
1312056001735032832 2020-10-02 23:45:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know it is silly! Have a good evening and keep warm. We were going up to London yesterday but with this weather I don’t think we will!
1312053451023679488 2020-10-02 23:34:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are too used to getting their own way. They are bullies!
1312004964676521985 2020-10-02 20:22:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not comparable . For once I have to say that Mrs Sturgeon has responded correctly.
1312003164661592065 2020-10-02 20:15:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes that is all he cares about !
1312002481405059072 2020-10-02 20:12:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Pathetic !
1312000488829845506 2020-10-02 20:04:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He was !
1312000011970936832 2020-10-02 20:02:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No of course not ! The world has become a much viler place. I think social media has a lot to answer for !
1311999536047554566 2020-10-02 20:00:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sainsbury's are much concerned with the hordes of marauding nazis you see in our streets every day ! Fucking Idiots !
1311998768309563392 2020-10-02 19:57:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A real bargain ! What an idiotic woman!
1311997649080459269 2020-10-02 19:53:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sorry about that Nikki ! thanks for following me. I always enjoy your tweets.
1311997324177141762 2020-10-02 19:51:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There is none that speaks with more authority than  the man who knows nothing !
1311996450751086597 2020-10-02 19:48:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just show some human decency and don't make a prat of yourself!
1311996040439050240 2020-10-02 19:46:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question !
1311995235338199041 2020-10-02 19:43:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most of Scotland sits cross legged in front of her in gaping in awe. She knows she knows that little mother Scotland is a very special person.
1311988936101822464 2020-10-02 19:18:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Harry has undergone a horrible transformation under the influence of the witch. For an ex army officer he doesn’t seem to have much up top.
1311958085964005377 2020-10-02 17:15:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Take care darling!
1311936578466574337 2020-10-02 15:50:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What wonderful human beings they all are. They are not at all vindictive arseholes are they?

1311931915025481728 2020-10-02 15:31:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are not going to see it !

1311905325440741376 2020-10-02 13:46:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They can be certainly !
1311905048532783115 2020-10-02 13:45:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the SNP got their way Scotland would become like a banana republic!
1311904047700545536 2020-10-02 13:41:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The modern world we know with all its technology and inventions was created by white people but we all benefit. Harry is talking in platitudes out of his rectum.
1311903077964877826 2020-10-02 13:37:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Margaret Ferrier has just fallen off her high horse an let us hope it tramples her.
1311900601475829760 2020-10-02 13:27:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This country has stood alone before and we will show our European friends once more. England : 2 Germany : 0

1311656956457816066 2020-10-01 21:19:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Right 😂
1311653633361051649 2020-10-01 21:06:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is there not a statue of him ! Surely apt !
1311652514408927234 2020-10-01 21:01:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true !
1311652361870422017 2020-10-01 21:01:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the BBC remade the series now James Harriot would be black !😀
1311651024470446080 2020-10-01 20:55:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Was he a good muslim though ?
1311650586748649472 2020-10-01 20:54:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @DailyMailUK When is Harry going to do a reverse Michael Jackson and have done with it !
1311650101681688577 2020-10-01 20:52:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Lin_121 Love it !
1311649791655530498 2020-10-01 20:50:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It does cut a sad figure ! Don't mock the afflicted !
1311649106151047169 2020-10-01 20:48:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a contrast to the intellectual pigmy Ian Blackford!
1311648987498328064 2020-10-01 20:47:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well done Jacob!
1311648307329073153 2020-10-01 20:45:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piss off Harry ! Go back to sleep again like the door mouse  you are !
1311647393838964738 2020-10-01 20:41:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think the answer is that it is no longer 1957!😀
1311646074554245120 2020-10-01 20:36:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on !
1311634849359425537 2020-10-01 19:51:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Harry and Meghan are firmly seated on the fashionable black bandwagon! Let us hope it runs off the road!
1311628594553270272 2020-10-01 19:26:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I demand these two mouthy pillocks  never return to this country again and get their titles stripped! Cheeky bastards!
1311621188611903489 2020-10-01 18:57:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the French Navy escorting illegals into our waters? Why do the remoaners support such a bunch of maffiosi bastards?
1311619289808543745 2020-10-01 18:49:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are aware of the problem. Remember the bearded children? The media is constantly covering up!
1311617721394700288 2020-10-01 18:43:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Really?
1311617488375951362 2020-10-01 18:42:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Arrogance or crash stupidity!😋
1311612311015247873 2020-10-01 18:21:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good!
1311547567524765696 2020-10-01 14:04:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s the only reason most people will come on chat shows and TV programs!
1311542901751640064 2020-10-01 13:46:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Love it !I much preferred the real Mrs Nesbitt ! At least she had a sense of humour !
1311542132885409793 2020-10-01 13:43:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They choke on their own propaganda!
1311541775476154368 2020-10-01 13:41:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You said it all !
1311541321677647872 2020-10-01 13:39:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think in reality Prince Philip is disgusted with her behaviour !
1311541115519201280 2020-10-01 13:39:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> With this lot we don't need Spitting Image puppets!
1311540813449572352 2020-10-01 13:37:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are all the institutions obsessed with Blacks with the exclusion of all else !
1311540369264443392 2020-10-01 13:36:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am glad the school did not bow to PC pressures.
1311539294012616704 2020-10-01 13:31:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tory cuts are to blame for everything ill of the world by Labour councils.
1311538924427390976 2020-10-01 13:30:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @RicHolden @UKLabour This is hardly a way to win votes.  Are they determined to be completely extinguished?
1311538567328432128 2020-10-01 13:28:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Kevin is greedy as well as totally obnoxious!
1311537688496005121 2020-10-01 13:25:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is the other agenda ?
1311537180058292224 2020-10-01 13:23:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I'll say !
1311536732773507072 2020-10-01 13:21:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's ironic !
1311536388853116928 2020-10-01 13:20:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @EarlyOakR Well said ! Things the BBC don't want you to know !
1311535488264798209 2020-10-01 13:16:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a lovely day !😀😀
1311535291690291201 2020-10-01 13:15:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> When will you be ready Connor ? Too busy showering I assume!🤣🤣
1311348908858257408 2020-10-01 00:55:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately being an a hole seems to come all too easily to some.😂
1311346880572461058 2020-10-01 00:47:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lefties always seem to have a chip on their shoulders maybe ugly women do too. A beautiful soul is what matters!😋
1311345255430713344 2020-10-01 00:40:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> After the pillar box episode there’s no much chance of Boris speaking out!
1311344255093309441 2020-10-01 00:36:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He didn’t do too badly today against the idiot Blackford.
1311341102763573248 2020-10-01 00:24:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very likely!
1311338312922271745 2020-10-01 00:13:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So now we have the Post Office which feels like every other institution indebted to blacks for little good reason.This is just fashionable posturing
1311306956364185600 2020-09-30 22:08:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She's leaving home !
1311306615107317761 2020-09-30 22:07:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or even if it will even exist in its present form.
1311306123782303746 2020-09-30 22:05:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It's as if every institution owes the blacks in particular something. Why?
1311304625241427969 2020-09-30 21:59:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What Verhofstadt is really saying is that he would like the EU to get rid of individual vetoes. So let us just have a dictatorship like we always wanted.
1311280947296428035 2020-09-30 20:25:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They look like little lamas from the back !
1311280645512081408 2020-09-30 20:24:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very valid point !
1311279315800264707 2020-09-30 20:18:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Boris confirms beyond  any doubt that Ian Blackford is a fucking idiot !
1311275975502630913 2020-09-30 20:05:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Piers ! I am surprised you get anyone coming on your show unless they are trying to sell some trashy nonsense of a book.
1311275233542799363 2020-09-30 20:02:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell the Liberals and the BLM that !
1311274944437858309 2020-09-30 20:01:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I have noticed.  It is a common theme among advertisements, even IKEA was at it and now we are getting a few back pillar boxes, what next ? Why can't we have the jolly Robinson Golly back ?
1311264488818171905 2020-09-30 19:19:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ciao !
1311247291714596864 2020-09-30 18:11:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Probably! Something like that!🤨
1311243602438303744 2020-09-30 17:56:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is a little known fact that in Elizabethan times London was full of mosques and men in night shirts! Cressida has been reading the Idiot's guide to History. There are a lot of pictures in it .
1311242915428139008 2020-09-30 17:54:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I was wondering what going on re Salmond now we know! What kind of a banana republic are they running up there? Good old Caledonia !
1311242146498916352 2020-09-30 17:51:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said !  https://t.co/njqxiMJCnN
1311241748027518976 2020-09-30 17:49:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A query ! Have David Lammy , Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler "taken the knee in public ? If not why not?
1311240785908695040 2020-09-30 17:45:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Govan"s finest !
1311240521881399296 2020-09-30 17:44:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I'll say they do !
1311191967372652544 2020-09-30 14:31:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quite!  https://t.co/1sSCAYOL17
1311188572473614341 2020-09-30 14:18:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t watch the BBC news anymore! Too boring and biased! Good morning darling!
1311188238749532160 2020-09-30 14:16:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This was the voice of the fecking Brussels poodle!
1311180380553318401 2020-09-30 13:45:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> For someone who performed so very badly she has an infernal cheek ! You would think she would crawl back under her stone or perhaps move over to Brussels and do us all a favour !
1311179404408754176 2020-09-30 13:41:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is the matter with these cringing do gooders. They seem intent on ruining their own countries.
1311176896948973568 2020-09-30 13:31:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Always !
1311176460468658176 2020-09-30 13:30:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling !
1311175119159656448 2020-09-30 13:24:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why not! Have a good day!😋
1310992393035014145 2020-09-30 01:18:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hell on earth!🙈🙈🙈
1310987206228611079 2020-09-30 00:58:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lewis Hamilton !
1310968402387898370 2020-09-29 23:43:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great news!
1310958766096101377 2020-09-29 23:05:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !😂
1310956337380065281 2020-09-29 22:55:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Loser, loser !
1310938608367546368 2020-09-29 21:44:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are spouting propaganda mindlessly !
1310938309473054721 2020-09-29 21:43:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They are part of the plastic bubble generation spoilt princes and princesses not equipped for the real world.
1310937921428639751 2020-09-29 21:42:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Kevin or maybe like Gary put your money where your mouth is !
1310937640724828164 2020-09-29 21:41:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are right and I think it is totally deliberate. Our media want this country to fail because they don't like the current government and they don't like Brexit. They are like spiteful children not getting their own way.
1310936979006263298 2020-09-29 21:38:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely!
1310935062200889346 2020-09-29 21:30:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neither would I !
1310934046579527685 2020-09-29 21:26:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What other official language could they use ? Esperanto !😀
1310932843456065545 2020-09-29 21:22:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure it will be very chic ! Lucky man !🙂
1310914747248844801 2020-09-29 20:10:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Honestly!🙈🙈
1310910784122257408 2020-09-29 19:54:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can't wait!
1310909741665792003 2020-09-29 19:50:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question Tony! The answer is bugger all because it was nothing because it did not suit them for their own reasons.
1310909079284600835 2020-09-29 19:47:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a disgrace !
1310907723488337920 2020-09-29 19:42:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good move ! That will shoot a few of these bastards up the trumpet !
1310867592702287874 2020-09-29 17:02:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Neither have I !😂
1310832062547587072 2020-09-29 14:41:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1310829810495692800 2020-09-29 14:32:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If Khan wants to remove this man’s statue he is a traitor!
1310823012145549314 2020-09-29 14:05:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Easy target Gary! Can't you be a little bit more original ! By the way how are you getting on with your refugee friend?
1310820586189447168 2020-09-29 13:55:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with the sentiments.  It does. not make you a racist if you object to your country been turned into something else against your will.
1310819805340012547 2020-09-29 13:52:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @Ara_MaHubbard Love it !
1310819493128613889 2020-09-29 13:51:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And yours is filthy ! You need to shower at least twice a day!😅
1310818802469351424 2020-09-29 13:48:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These people are professional grievance seekers with presumably nothing better to do .  Plenty of shit stirrers around !
1310817976153772035 2020-09-29 13:45:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Lammy how would you feel if your daughter became a victim of a grooming gang?
1310817655004299265 2020-09-29 13:44:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And there is no sign of change .  They will never reflect the views of the general population who is paying for them. Their attempt at indoctrination is just not working.
1310817022926876673 2020-09-29 13:41:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You got what you wanted, you should be happy!😀
1310816379042488326 2020-09-29 13:39:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievable ! What is this country coming to?
1310815979849609217 2020-09-29 13:37:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So they can't read, can't speak properly, can they even wipe their own arses.  What is wrong with some parents and teachers. So when these kids go out in the real world and see clocks they will be like sheep looking at aircraft engine.
1310814383627436034 2020-09-29 13:31:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You and your showers!😂
1310646344416100360 2020-09-29 02:23:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fair enough!
1310618975253000193 2020-09-29 00:34:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would not put anything past them!
1310605363344035841 2020-09-28 23:40:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The listeners speak ! Well done!
1310602560122871810 2020-09-28 23:29:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Monsieur Guillaume knobhead !
1310602256883101696 2020-09-28 23:28:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morgan's pet weasel !
1310601664504778752 2020-09-28 23:26:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I bet he never occurred to them when they laid down the regulations.
1310601448707756033 2020-09-28 23:25:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They were lying Andrew.  They are just a pair of grasping bastards.
1310595351775252480 2020-09-28 23:00:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The word racism is used far too casually and inappropriately. If is the Keft’s default term of abuse.
1310553508404506624 2020-09-28 20:14:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Morgan for once!
1310547311974649858 2020-09-28 19:50:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She is a powerful influential person in her own head!
1310546232134303745 2020-09-28 19:45:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s definitely not you! She is a nobody!
1310492310078095362 2020-09-28 16:11:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> One of the many!
1310491413612834817 2020-09-28 16:07:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More embarrassment for the Queen!🙈🙈
1310490864045748225 2020-09-28 16:05:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Plenty of Americans ! They are celebrities.
1310484913871826950 2020-09-28 15:42:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true! They were brilliant but then they didn’t take themselves seriously and both had a fantastic sense of humour
1310484653371985920 2020-09-28 15:41:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Meghan will end up having her own chat show. We will have another Oprah!
1310483352131194881 2020-09-28 15:35:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They do say love is blind!😋
1310482390675066881 2020-09-28 15:32:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totally disgraceful and shameless!
1310477371154276352 2020-09-28 15:12:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the couple who wanted privacy and they are now turning themselves into the Osbournes! Something is not right!
1310474674720190464 2020-09-28 15:01:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hilarious!
1310470274018615302 2020-09-28 14:43:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wouldn’t surprise me!😋
1310467227741634560 2020-09-28 14:31:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC!
1310455496772653057 2020-09-28 13:45:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning lovely!😋
1310453301608165376 2020-09-28 13:36:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are a spoil sport and a bit of a moaner too, I bet!😛
1310452720822882311 2020-09-28 13:34:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning sunshine!😀😀
1310450440874725376 2020-09-28 13:25:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s the spirit early bird!
1310449001536409601 2020-09-28 13:19:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Here we go ! Mental health issues excuse everything.
1310290930352762882 2020-09-28 02:51:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know!
1310250934853922818 2020-09-28 00:12:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sorry to hear that Connor!
1310245320589283329 2020-09-27 23:50:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hatred of the English that’s why and a belief that Scotland would do better if it was an independent country.
1310213822003765249 2020-09-27 21:44:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it won’t!
1310189210629005312 2020-09-27 20:07:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the BBC are not a marxist organisation I am a fucking China man !  https://t.co/peW8oz4SWd
1310188758982160384 2020-09-27 20:05:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Et vive la France libre !
1310184875849383936 2020-09-27 19:49:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who cares what the silly little puffed up bastard does?
1310183340780253184 2020-09-27 19:43:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or a poll in the Guardian which fortunately is not doing well financially.
1310183015025455107 2020-09-27 19:42:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can't give up on Strictly . The rest of the programs could not care less. I used to enjoy history programs but no more as they are all now related to slavery or other black issues In some way!
1310182327482548224 2020-09-27 19:39:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A lot of these so called polls are a little mysterious and I suspect are deliberately misleading or wishful thinking!
1310175270452764677 2020-09-27 19:11:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our mayor constantly parades double standards! As far as he is concerned BLM and Eco freaks can do no wrong whilst the white working class can do no right for him!
1310174430929313794 2020-09-27 19:08:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Surely not!🙈🙈
1310174271554179079 2020-09-27 19:07:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not buying it!
1310173848105635842 2020-09-27 19:06:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Please not! This is a vision of hell. If people think the country is in a bad way let the likes of them loose on them! What I would like would be a rerun of the French Revolution with leftie heads on poles!
1310172953779286016 2020-09-27 19:02:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t complain darling ! Keeps you safe.😋
1310172081254957057 2020-09-27 18:59:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That must be a full time job!😂😂
1310162791450451969 2020-09-27 18:22:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great !That’s all we need!
1310122415628972033 2020-09-27 15:41:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I’ll take that as a compliment Bernie!Thank you 😋
1310121682829488133 2020-09-27 15:38:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Lammy are you trying to incite the Tottenham riots again? You don’t seem to have any constructive suggestions just grievances.
1310118386714775552 2020-09-27 15:25:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We saw some of his road alterations in lLondon yesterday! A total absurdity under the guise of “social distancing” and I bet they will be there long after the virus has gone.
1310117407776739328 2020-09-27 15:21:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they are a bunch of fucking idiots and that’s the best I can say about them! Don’t they realise this is not actually America!
1310108113882710017 2020-09-27 14:44:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why is it that white people are always far right while as Blacks are always heroic fighters against oppression?
1310106502129225729 2020-09-27 14:38:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It always happen!
1310105832370171904 2020-09-27 14:35:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hungary is one of our true European friends unlike the perfidious French who are sending their navy into our waters escorting scum into our waters.
1310104313814028293 2020-09-27 14:29:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Morning darling !
1310104026965585920 2020-09-27 14:28:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good idea Laurance.  I agree with your sentiments.
1310103738116452357 2020-09-27 14:27:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought we were in a pandemic when the BLM were performing in the streets of Brixton.
1310103157888999424 2020-09-27 14:25:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is Khan going to do if the BLM decides to have another protest march ?
1310101871458213893 2020-09-27 14:20:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is a stupid and ill judged measure.  All they have done is cause other problems. What can't they think things through.  There is going to be another U turn !
1310101108610695169 2020-09-27 14:16:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why could'n  the Police just stand by like they do with the BLM and the eco friends.
1310100380680949762 2020-09-27 14:14:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So much for sympathy for the police! Let us see them trying to punch a BLM protester if they are brave enough !
1310099904770048008 2020-09-27 14:12:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This censorship is unsettling and sinister and most people know why it is been done.
1310099444675772416 2020-09-27 14:10:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonjour Connor !
1309823265783910401 2020-09-26 19:52:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1309819664227348485 2020-09-26 19:38:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Germania is in trouble!🤣🤣🤣🤣
1309815919452008451 2020-09-26 19:23:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It just might have something to do with it!😋
1309787325312925697 2020-09-26 17:30:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beautiful creature!
1309785736997109761 2020-09-26 17:23:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good point!
1309769045152010240 2020-09-26 16:17:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great news!
1309768827123781638 2020-09-26 16:16:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with all that! Enough is enough!
1309766307475320832 2020-09-26 16:06:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s Tony Blair without the talent!
1309742537549262848 2020-09-26 14:32:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have a nice day!🙂
1309738843478937600 2020-09-26 14:17:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU has always thought it knows best and has got away with things for too long.
1309738054026964992 2020-09-26 14:14:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good ! It won't be a comfortable feeling . These people usually get their just deserve in the end.
1309737257293799424 2020-09-26 14:11:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Totally agree! The Swiss are very proud of their country and don't want to ruin it at the orders of the EU like others have done.
1309735510559133696 2020-09-26 14:04:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we can predict the outcome!
1309734453179228160 2020-09-26 14:00:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Peugeot 404 in the Marais Paris  https://t.co/rcsK80gS1h
1309732806923350016 2020-09-26 13:53:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You see you are a philosopher!
1309732025700581376 2020-09-26 13:50:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are quite a philosopher ! Reality TV is heavily edited and far from reality .
1309730927187238912 2020-09-26 13:46:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The way the BBC is going you really don't want to be associated with it !
1309728749009670144 2020-09-26 13:37:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The early bird catches the worm!
1309728332976619520 2020-09-26 13:35:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well you are an early bird!🐦🐦
1309726640801538049 2020-09-26 13:28:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This shows the yawning toilet pan they are shortly going to be flushed down and bloody good riddance.
1309723032957706241 2020-09-26 13:14:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Une catastrophe
1309562181323829253 2020-09-26 02:35:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonne nuit !🌗
1309561208606011392 2020-09-26 02:31:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonne unit!😁
1309547100875747331 2020-09-26 01:35:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure they will! Its heart wrenching.
1309541513463042049 2020-09-26 01:13:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt it too!
1309535773780307968 2020-09-26 00:50:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly so true!
1309529758024249346 2020-09-26 00:26:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Merci!
1309529040471064577 2020-09-26 00:23:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We will leave it at that! Bon weekend!😋
1309527158474395649 2020-09-26 00:16:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What next?😋
1309525670771466240 2020-09-26 00:10:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tasty looking!
1309525172450480131 2020-09-26 00:08:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Odd not, predicted yes, and we know why.
1309492152934764544 2020-09-25 21:57:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are guilty of incitement!
1309491632027336704 2020-09-25 21:55:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who is this Starmer?
1309490657539567621 2020-09-25 21:51:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @SusanEacock I am pretty sure they will say f..... all!
1309490408855154688 2020-09-25 21:50:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You could wait a very long time!
1309490276646506498 2020-09-25 21:49:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Brilliant!
1309488911899594752 2020-09-25 21:44:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is that what you want?
1309487552081145857 2020-09-25 21:38:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Helen ! We do back him!
1309487179706454017 2020-09-25 21:37:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we know the answer!
1309486155969298432 2020-09-25 21:33:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not forget Charlie Hebdo !
1309467018211491842 2020-09-25 20:17:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873>  https://t.co/reQvPTdTlV
1309464898011910144 2020-09-25 20:08:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That's very true! What a hypocritical little shit Hamilton really is ! He's no Einstein either !
1309464055812362240 2020-09-25 20:05:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it cannot go on ! It appears this incident occurred due to an unwillingness to carry out stop and search correctly.
1309463230650159105 2020-09-25 20:02:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes the Nazys had a lot of slave camps filled with Europeans but that does not interest the BLM. They are totally fixated on the negro experience.
1309462510970580993 2020-09-25 19:59:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree !
1309461239001686016 2020-09-25 19:54:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So for example we can no longer call a black murderer back because it is apparently racist. They are not all locked uo. Let us call a spade a spade.
1309460518156021760 2020-09-25 19:51:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I guessed as much !
1309460352216825856 2020-09-25 19:50:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Facts cannot be racist !
1309459678926188550 2020-09-25 19:48:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The sooner the better!
1309459534918938625 2020-09-25 19:47:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes exactly !
1309459055337975808 2020-09-25 19:45:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They don't quite know how to tell us !
1309458430760046594 2020-09-25 19:43:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Draw your own conclusions !
1309458076802613248 2020-09-25 19:41:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No of course he won't. It's only black lives that matter!
1309429284184961024 2020-09-25 17:47:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If that's the case I would not pay the ransom, top him!
1309428876662247424 2020-09-25 17:45:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Another aspect of this is why are so many businesses and institutions supporting them ?
1309428486130593792 2020-09-25 17:44:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us also remember that it is an American export, the circumstances of which do not apply over here.
1309427846297849858 2020-09-25 17:41:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I totally agree, this has not been thought through!
1309425478277660672 2020-09-25 17:32:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Meghan is still writing it for him!
1309425235138146304 2020-09-25 17:31:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Actually I saw someone almost drink his coffee with his mask on. His companion told him just in time!😋
1309389319619125248 2020-09-25 15:08:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What nonsense! Surely black barristers wear the same rig as white barristers don’t they?
1309375920835264512 2020-09-25 14:15:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But it’s all right for them to wear night shirts in the street.
1309375482392195076 2020-09-25 14:13:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No. He just wanted people to match the name to the face!😋
1309373028682391552 2020-09-25 14:03:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The astonishing thing is that Sturgeon is still so popular in Scotland !
1309368524540915713 2020-09-25 13:45:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> None whatsoever! Except Koesnburg was very searching with Starmer in an interview .
1309364434293477376 2020-09-25 13:29:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1309363724478812161 2020-09-25 13:26:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer with no idea and no ideas!
1309210240085356544 2020-09-25 03:16:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes!
1309195124275122178 2020-09-25 02:16:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It certainly makes sense.
1309193600903901184 2020-09-25 02:10:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are probably right!
1309187521037963270 2020-09-25 01:46:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely no honour!
1309187371779457026 2020-09-25 01:46:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I knew what you were referring to, just a little fed up with the Covid business.😋
1309186996259246084 2020-09-25 01:44:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thieves falling out!
1309186685247401989 2020-09-25 01:43:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No thanks! Don’t fancy their winter!
1309186276923518976 2020-09-25 01:41:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a great positive attitude! A very welcome change from all the moaning.
1309185168280870912 2020-09-25 01:37:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Join the club!😋😋
1309184488262586370 2020-09-25 01:34:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on !
1309183365921333249 2020-09-25 01:30:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bloody hell!( Excuse my French)!🙈🙈
1309178638303137794 2020-09-25 01:11:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Amazing!🐦🐦🐦
1309157505944162307 2020-09-24 23:47:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes unfortunately not for the better.
1309156992766955525 2020-09-24 23:45:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What is most worryingly is what will happen after the pandemic is over. Will things really be ever as before?
1309156578050936835 2020-09-24 23:43:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It takes one to know one 😛
1309138355804872709 2020-09-24 22:31:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😿😿
1309137806451769347 2020-09-24 22:29:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is very particular after all!
1309137214555803648 2020-09-24 22:26:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True enough!
1309121008629096456 2020-09-24 21:22:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe he likes a slapper !
1309120554688020480 2020-09-24 21:20:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so!
1309117998070935554 2020-09-24 21:10:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe not but do watch it!
1309117690322333697 2020-09-24 21:09:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Me too! 😊
1309116753423855621 2020-09-24 21:05:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If Sturgeon actually achieved independence for Scotland she would have no one to blame and all her disciples would turn on her and judging by some of her supporters' attitude they might well have her pin head on a pole.
1309114613481562117 2020-09-24 20:57:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC is dismally ludicrous !
1309112795884072960 2020-09-24 20:49:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spain and France and Belgium have many more cases of Covid 19 at the moment.  Why not comment on this for change ?
1309112209247801350 2020-09-24 20:47:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> One of the best program on the BBC is : Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone fishing. It's good humoured with no agendas and beautiful scenery and wild life.
1309099928707366924 2020-09-24 19:58:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is immigrants 's gratitude for liberal hospitality!
1309098804054982658 2020-09-24 19:54:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you imagine how popular Harry is with half of America now ! This will end in tears.
1309098234594373632 2020-09-24 19:51:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He was only following orders !
1309096841817063426 2020-09-24 19:46:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sunak I think is the cleverest man in the government and maybe the Prime Minister we should have.
1309096382314221575 2020-09-24 19:44:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think he has got every right to !
1309096047936000004 2020-09-24 19:43:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The one on the right is the dummy ! Hilarious!
1309095639888924680 2020-09-24 19:41:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Labour Party is going to go the way of the Liberals if they are not careful. An unelectable bunch of pillocks.
1309010823617089542 2020-09-24 14:04:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes this was the patriot Starmer at his best! Would you buy a used car from this man?
1309004251318956038 2020-09-24 13:38:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer has no chance surrounded as he is by such a group of freaks. His address to the nation was ultimately ridiculous. I have never seen anything like it.
1308999989167886336 2020-09-24 13:21:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hasta luego! (laters)!
1308832251271094280 2020-09-24 02:15:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Spot on! Morgan behaves like a petulant child and very unprofessionally.
1308831809459945472 2020-09-24 02:13:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Once in a generation is not every 6 or 7 years.
1308805880616452100 2020-09-24 00:30:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How can anyone believe this from someone like Starmer. Judge him by his previous actions.
1308805389669015553 2020-09-24 00:28:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So the beloved EU of the remainers has tried it on like a common con man. Yet will anyone in the media admit this? No
1308804383518449664 2020-09-24 00:24:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Don’t overdo this gs and end up with a Viking burial!
1308802239146983425 2020-09-24 00:15:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1308800888341966851 2020-09-24 00:10:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I think you are not alone there. There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of the media and ad agencies to over represent blacks. It’s quite extraordinary.
1308796754276618240 2020-09-23 23:53:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very sorry for your loss.
1308793706284232708 2020-09-23 23:41:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Oh dear! Doesn’t say much for Starmer does it! Perhaps it was the kneeling that did it!
1308739682038091776 2020-09-23 20:07:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Beats me !
1308735201107939328 2020-09-23 19:49:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are right, it’s a shame they don’t.😋
1308734546364555266 2020-09-23 19:46:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so !
1308733246834868225 2020-09-23 19:41:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well actually I have got news for you it does!
1308729287042793479 2020-09-23 19:25:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is the unpleasant Scotsman who sneers at everything English whilst accepting massive subsidies from us with smug entitlement. No wonder a lot of  English would vote for Scottish independence given the opportunity.
1308721013945962496 2020-09-23 18:52:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is not fooling anyone not even himself. It is just hypocritical stupidity!
1308715101185355777 2020-09-23 18:29:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A nobody!
1308664672862732289 2020-09-23 15:09:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Would they be Caledonians?
1308662007655170049 2020-09-23 14:58:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> GMB daily session with the journalists is now just a series of leading questions by Morgan designed to bash Boris!
1308652420872929281 2020-09-23 14:20:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Susana’s main function is to be Morgan’s pet weasel and she fills the role well.
1308649406753845248 2020-09-23 14:08:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I am on the edge of my seat 😛
1308646953606090752 2020-09-23 13:58:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you darling, you too!😋
1308643826517635072 2020-09-23 13:46:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I suppose Corbyn could have managed this crisis expertly. You must be joking!
1308642500010225664 2020-09-23 13:41:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Robertson’s Golly now censored from Twitter!
1308641518870294531 2020-09-23 13:37:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan was mocking Boris for talking and not accepting questions. Last week Piers was praising Sturgeon for exactly the same thing.Morgan is a vindictive knobhead
1308639345239379969 2020-09-23 13:28:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yet another British institution totally buggered by ludicrous virtue signalling. Are they going to cancel Wordsworth the stupid bastards.
1308637899743690753 2020-09-23 13:22:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think we need HMS Elisabeth patrolling the channel.
1308637359773229056 2020-09-23 13:20:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bless her !
1308470924157607942 2020-09-23 02:19:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bonsoir Connor!
1308454561808633859 2020-09-23 01:14:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Come on, she’s a woman!😂😂
1308451644531716096 2020-09-23 01:02:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is there no end to this madness! We cannot erase history because it upsets our modern sensibilities.
1308448860780597255 2020-09-23 00:51:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How on earth do you name and shame a property! Most of us couldn’t care less past slavery as it has nothing to do with us. Get used to the idea!
1308430716359893000 2020-09-22 23:39:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The National Trust is now the National Joke!
1308423422435905537 2020-09-22 23:10:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The only thing GMB could do in retaliation to this is replace Morgan and his weasel with two black presenters. I would like to see Morgan’s face ( for once)!😂
1308421904039137282 2020-09-22 23:04:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How much more are we supposed to put up with!Boris, do the right thing, deploy the army against the BLM and eco freaks. Enough is enough!
1308420832822276099 2020-09-22 23:00:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! And Christ knows what sort of country he would like to see!
1308417432067989504 2020-09-22 22:46:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know how you feel!😀
1308415712214614020 2020-09-22 22:39:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think Macron should be more wary of his sans culottes. A head on a pole is not a good look!😋
1308373591612960768 2020-09-22 19:52:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You tell them !😋. We are sticking by Boris.
1308307029333770240 2020-09-22 15:27:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not!
1308301988279459840 2020-09-22 15:07:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What about the rest of Starmer’s sorry crew, would they make a good Government? I don’t think so! What nonsense!
1308294021672886272 2020-09-22 14:36:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely!
1308290705383739393 2020-09-22 14:23:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All the media was so insanely keen to have a go at Boris’s trip to Italy that they clean forgot to check that he actually went.
1308289297443819521 2020-09-22 14:17:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We should all listen to Teresa May who gave us such a wonderful demonstration of expert statesmanship. ( not)!
1308287973675298816 2020-09-22 14:12:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan . 147 days and You are the problem!
1308286104097837057 2020-09-22 14:04:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The reasoning is if the English want something I don’t!
1308284888802492417 2020-09-22 13:59:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is not even science, it’s guess work!
1308284197442781185 2020-09-22 13:57:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let’s have a detailed outline from Starmer about his proposals. We will have a long wait...
1308282344915177472 2020-09-22 13:49:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mrs May was a leader as weak as piss in the eyes of the world. If she had allowed her own negotiators to do their job we might not be in this mess with the backstop.
1308280201160294401 2020-09-22 13:41:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No wonder this vile bunch are unelectable!
1308144384467234818 2020-09-22 04:41:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The return of the pink panther
1308143660987568132 2020-09-22 04:38:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some like it hot !
1308133387304132610 2020-09-22 03:57:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps Khan wants a freer range for the BLM to demonstrate every weekend whilst the rest of us are under lockdown
1308117828864823301 2020-09-22 02:56:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it’s not !
1308079645095604226 2020-09-22 00:24:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bienvenus  😋
1308051977142767616 2020-09-21 22:34:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it is !
1308033600923807744 2020-09-21 21:21:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I feel guilty for nothing! I’ll give it six months and the whole of the BBC will be black and the laughing stock of the world
1308032590494994433 2020-09-21 21:17:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I’ll bet the House of Commons will have shat their breeches following her dire threat, not!😂
1308009983045513216 2020-09-21 19:47:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The media always revel in disasters. For example they like nothing better than a plane crash. They have now found something that can exploit indefinitely. They don’t seem to care about the state of this nation.
1307993874049249283 2020-09-21 18:43:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Last week I was informed by a busybody in Bluewater shopping mall that I was walking the wrong way on a way system even though I was only crossing over to get into a shop.We are turning into a nation of paronoid meddlers.
1307992873254760448 2020-09-21 18:39:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes this is hilarious! Piers is getting what he deserves!
1307926156876943361 2020-09-21 14:14:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shocking!
1307921045396086784 2020-09-21 13:54:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I was genuinely shocked to read this morning that the so called Lady Lawrence is now demanding that the police kneel in the streets during riots. Is there no end to this madness?
1307913406062698496 2020-09-21 13:23:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Labour Party now hardly represents anyone of the general party largely thanks to Milliband and his stupid thoughtless meddling of their voting system.
1307778276652396545 2020-09-21 04:26:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Piers will be displaying his stupid calendar and whining about it. He really is a sad git.
1307756615043551234 2020-09-21 03:00:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Regards this war business I have heard this drivel from the BBC before. They magnify the exploits of a few people into regiments. Perhaps they should tell us the tell of the Indian SS batallion but I bet they won’t.
1307737429856735234 2020-09-21 01:44:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Verhofstadt is a very unpleasant arrogant pig, and that is the best I can say.
1307720364777181186 2020-09-21 00:36:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Salud !
1307719763599261696 2020-09-21 00:34:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Enjoy!😋
1307712454890270720 2020-09-21 00:05:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That must be it!
1307679883829678080 2020-09-20 21:55:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I think it is !😋
1307676652990857216 2020-09-20 21:43:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly  what kind of a person is he? He is as bad as some remainers who were crowing that Brexiteers would die off soon.
1307669308953235456 2020-09-20 21:13:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes he was !
1307651775395254274 2020-09-20 20:04:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1307646471651688448 2020-09-20 19:43:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The latter is what he will always be remembered for long after the BLM is forgotten!😋
1307643545193451525 2020-09-20 19:31:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Look forward to it !
1307643273276780544 2020-09-20 19:30:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You obviously have no idea how bad Edward Heath was. Probably before your time!😋
1307642369962057734 2020-09-20 19:26:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they are terrified of the BLM more so the media support they attract. The same applies to the eco freaks.
1307610301370695681 2020-09-20 17:19:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer never really has any positive suggestions. His judgement is poor . If he was so forensic you would think he would be able to contribute more.
1307594048341975040 2020-09-20 16:14:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very true!
1307583492264517634 2020-09-20 15:32:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes and we all know what happened then!
1307582363979968512 2020-09-20 15:28:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! Blacks and climate fanatics are treated with kid gloves because they have big mouths and more media support.
1307581019156107265 2020-09-20 15:23:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If anyone is racist it is some Scots!
1307573423888109568 2020-09-20 14:52:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we are! The majority up to now has just been putting up and shutting up. We should have a Britannia resurrecting the ancient name of this island.
1307572242579161089 2020-09-20 14:48:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BLM idea does not really work here!
1307571965264310273 2020-09-20 14:47:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I’ll say! He has been absolutely hopeless! He makes Ken Livingstone’s efforts look good.
1307569600737968129 2020-09-20 14:37:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well apparently there are protests starting where these new migrant camps are been set up in Tenby and I feel that many many people are teaching the limit of their tolerance with various issues
1307568503566807042 2020-09-20 14:33:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Manchester mayor on the other hand seems genuinely concerned about his city and he is having a positive impact. We however are saddled with a piece of shit.
1307564743402622977 2020-09-20 14:18:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And the vile BLM!
1307563582947721217 2020-09-20 14:13:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we are not seeing much of that at all!
1307563081216688129 2020-09-20 14:11:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The media is going completely over the top with all this and I for one is completely sick of all this!
1307560778409676800 2020-09-20 14:02:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I have always supported the police in what is a difficult job, however now something seems to be going seriously wrong.
1307395832669405189 2020-09-20 03:07:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The slogan heard today in Trafalgar Square “Choose your side”! seems more and more appropriate.
1307394723322224646 2020-09-20 03:02:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Today’s events are absolutely disgraceful. What is the real agenda of the police? Are they frightened of BLM etc, do they have orders to let them do as they please? We need answers!
1307313087196860416 2020-09-19 21:38:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree !
1307312077325979648 2020-09-19 21:34:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Bernie! I have signed a petition going round Twitter asking for the mayor to stop all this nonsense and I think we should all write to our MPs.
1307310074390622213 2020-09-19 21:26:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We need us Londoners to write to our respective MPs!
1307307868555706370 2020-09-19 21:17:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These are national monuments and don’t solely belong to London.
1307307456138108930 2020-09-19 21:16:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They wouldn’t stand for  it !
1307307082555838465 2020-09-19 21:14:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree but he won’t!
1307278387505958912 2020-09-19 19:20:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A very well deserved title 👏👏👏
1307233663822766084 2020-09-19 16:22:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Typical! As bad as the Kennedys.
1307231490070261761 2020-09-19 16:14:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for the tip !
1307231241461288960 2020-09-19 16:13:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why can’t Khan be removed for incompetence. His mayorship expired in May.
1307230281812803585 2020-09-19 16:09:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they do! They avoid it at all costs and always s shout down anyone with a different opinion to their own.
1307197607727554560 2020-09-19 13:59:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC’s diversity is a misnomer. To them it just means more black presenters and more black interest. The result of all this of course will not be good.
1307026444606939138 2020-09-19 02:39:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Prefer pain au raisin !
1307026158580629504 2020-09-19 02:38:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! It’s so easy to criticise when you don’t have to do the job yourself.
1307017108467974144 2020-09-19 02:02:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s more like it !😋😋
1307015302383837184 2020-09-19 01:55:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Only one?😂
1307008022703673344 2020-09-19 01:26:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What else are they going to throw at her? This is persecution.
1306997597857607681 2020-09-19 00:44:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am not surprised Piers as you are such a wonderful human being compared to the devil ‘s dropping Hancock! 😂😂
1306992551925252096 2020-09-19 00:24:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is not cancelling Christmas just the fireworks on the Thames !
1306991839946342401 2020-09-19 00:21:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree! People have to learn to behave with common sense and consideration and good personal hygiene would not go amiss!
1306953196179468291 2020-09-18 21:48:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No Santa Claus won’t be banned because he will be black and that’s okay.
1306922454313578502 2020-09-18 19:46:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No it won’t, I agree!
1306921508514693121 2020-09-18 19:42:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know but I still think it makes sense to cancel the fireworks display. He is an interim mayor at the moment and I think he should be relieved of his duties!
1306917541869170688 2020-09-18 19:26:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Jeremy is a well known figure in that department trying the goods on his head!
1306910950117834753 2020-09-18 19:00:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thankfully that seems to be the case.
1306910435216678912 2020-09-18 18:58:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately we have to obey international laws and we do. We are of course the silly country.
1306904326196154369 2020-09-18 18:34:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Only Guardian readers!😋
1306901242149568512 2020-09-18 18:21:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We know why. It’s very simple SNP followers hate the English.They have no other reason for existing. It’s pathetic! Wake up Scotland!
1306900029848911873 2020-09-18 18:17:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes these mouthy pigmy weasels should shut their ignorant gobs and stop meddling with our history!
1306899612435984384 2020-09-18 18:15:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> @AllisonDowden71 @LBC The Government should sack Khan for gross incompetence and take over the running of  London until there can be another election next year!
1306885999730065408 2020-09-18 17:21:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1306883577766912000 2020-09-18 17:11:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nice one !
1306861392369274882 2020-09-18 15:43:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If Merkel has anything to do with it, she’ll insist they take more in.
1306858705045123072 2020-09-18 15:32:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s unbelievable!
1306840060503916545 2020-09-18 14:18:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is true! but you know very well that the situation could change and the Government has to be seen to act!
1306838770671644673 2020-09-18 14:13:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t believe that  😃
1306838605629992960 2020-09-18 14:12:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true !
1306838254298202112 2020-09-18 14:11:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s boring, negative and helping no one. We are saturated with Covid news.
1306837977738469376 2020-09-18 14:10:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes there are plenty more things happening in the world!
1306836988629266432 2020-09-18 14:06:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers knows but just can’t get over it!😋
1306836463825440768 2020-09-18 14:04:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Kindness
1306836341066526722 2020-09-18 14:03:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And she obviously does not do her homework!
1306836036656533507 2020-09-18 14:02:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Are your elderly or vulnerable neighbours holding 100 strong parties in their houses?
1306835407372517376 2020-09-18 14:00:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So is Lord Frost !
1306834771427962881 2020-09-18 13:57:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unbelievable! and we have a Conservative Government ‘! Are children not allowed a childhood anymore?
1306833930469900289 2020-09-18 13:54:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> These liberals will never learn until it is too late!
1306832712846766085 2020-09-18 13:49:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The point is that theGovernment is looking at what is happening in France and Spain. What is happening in Marseille is dreadful. I am afraid it is the case of damned if you do, damned if you don’t!
1306831881934176256 2020-09-18 13:46:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC’s idea of diversity is not that diverse. It just means the maximum numbers of black presenters, black issue programs and sod the rest of us who pay for it all!
1306830211628101636 2020-09-18 13:39:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they mostly definitely are. It’s relentless. Jeremy Vine radio show this week features nothing else.
1306828939285925889 2020-09-18 13:34:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly not! The BBC certainly does not reward loyalty!
1306828733962170371 2020-09-18 13:33:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tres perfide !
1306823766660579329 2020-09-18 13:14:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know!
1306665800732991489 2020-09-18 02:46:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you!😋
1306661499944013824 2020-09-18 02:29:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, he looks a lot like his father!😋
1306657402788421633 2020-09-18 02:12:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This country has not even got a National day! Yet Scotland and Wales have got a National day. If the English dare to fly their own flag they are labelled fascists and racists.
1306656053300531206 2020-09-18 02:07:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The problem with this country is that so many natives seem to hate it. The Poles have always been extremely patriotic. The British used to be patriotic and it has been beaten out of them by 50 years of leftist indoctrination.
1306653262096084994 2020-09-18 01:56:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I haven’t had your personal experience of communism so cannot relate to how you feel. There are no true democracies but I don’t feel that we are living under a totalitarian regime. This is not Russia.
1306650946919948288 2020-09-18 01:47:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think in any society we have to always stay vigilant. Our personal freedoms can be gradually eroded.
1306649477709692928 2020-09-18 01:41:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds nightmarish!😦😦
1306646940189368321 2020-09-18 01:31:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A marriage with secrets!😋
1306637836611977220 2020-09-18 00:55:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Actually a lot of us didn’t vote for him and don’t want him as our mayor. Only certain parts of London are shit holes. We don’t live in one.
1306633561735397376 2020-09-18 00:38:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True! Why does anyone bother!
1306632734010421250 2020-09-18 00:34:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You took the words out of my mouth!😋
1306631536515731458 2020-09-18 00:30:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lineker is a smug bastard who thinks he is a wonderful human being.
1306630975246479365 2020-09-18 00:27:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Phoebe !
1306630777292181507 2020-09-18 00:27:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As usual Morgan is ignorant and rude.
1306562850907971585 2020-09-17 19:57:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not particularly I would think! I think it’s more about the Irish influence in American politics. Irish Americans are very influential.
1306561263481352197 2020-09-17 19:50:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they did
1306540886013206529 2020-09-17 18:29:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! The SNP are pathologically ungrateful! They will accept anything offered from the English  with a sneer on their face. They are living in a fool’s paradise if they think they can be successfully independent.
1306478220448018435 2020-09-17 14:20:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The truth hurts!
1306476021043073025 2020-09-17 14:12:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No wonder this is known throughout the world as the silly country who hates itself !
1306473981462171648 2020-09-17 14:04:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Need you ask!
1306473568847495168 2020-09-17 14:02:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly ! There is so much happening which is completely ignored.
1306472935239176192 2020-09-17 13:59:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is there any other country which has so many of its politicians against it ?
1306471684245991427 2020-09-17 13:54:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We don’t want Khan meddling with our culture. London existed a 1000 years before him and will be there 1000 after he’s gone. He is a meddling pigmy!😡
1306470358451617793 2020-09-17 13:49:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! Is this Scotland’s finest? I don’t think so!
1306468655241269253 2020-09-17 13:42:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Our European friends!
1306306880973811713 2020-09-17 03:00:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Buenas noches !😴😴
1306304302395383808 2020-09-17 02:49:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers Morgan! It’s almost like a photograph of him!😋
1306302486005899268 2020-09-17 02:42:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sorry, meant that of course it is not transphobic! 🤭🤭
1306302255440826369 2020-09-17 02:41:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rubbish!
1306301727965155335 2020-09-17 02:39:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I don’t think there is one!
1306293471188316160 2020-09-17 02:06:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not appropriate !
1306279953206575110 2020-09-17 01:13:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes totally!
1306277578999828481 2020-09-17 01:03:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Poland sticking up for itself!
1306276697566851073 2020-09-17 01:00:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A very intellectual look!
1306276512509947905 2020-09-17 00:59:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And still the remoaners will love it!
1306276184314064896 2020-09-17 00:58:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That means EU members you do as you are told!
1306275751440809986 2020-09-17 00:56:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Lammy obviously did not watch the same event than I did! This is just silly talking up!
1306205253126291456 2020-09-16 20:16:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I knew that!
1306203955589001216 2020-09-16 20:11:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks the info! The Channel Islands will be pleased if it happens!
1306200523255799816 2020-09-16 19:57:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are welcome!😋
1306200312009687040 2020-09-16 19:56:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Channel Islands have their own Parliament. How could this happen?
1306199817891328001 2020-09-16 19:54:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You may be right!
1306199489552822273 2020-09-16 19:53:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This sounds horrific! Switch channels at once!
1306199100388454401 2020-09-16 19:51:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt you will ever satisfactorily renovate what you have! A replacement might be worth doing !
1306198480289964033 2020-09-16 19:49:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s more like a kindergarten show!😋
1306198250089787393 2020-09-16 19:48:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It didn’t seem to be bothering him much today and why should it? We are all equals now .
1306196648905891840 2020-09-16 19:42:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I must say I have never seen a cast iron shower tray!
1306195918224535553 2020-09-16 19:39:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It looked pretty dismal. They seem to be going through the motions.
1306195418305499139 2020-09-16 19:37:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question! Who needs them anyway?
1306190107305705473 2020-09-16 19:16:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In other words a typical leftie!
1306189602114473996 2020-09-16 19:14:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rayner trying to make a name for herself. Unfortunately it might not be the name she is looking for !
1306188818001866753 2020-09-16 19:10:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Does Labour want a maximum national wage then?
1306188066579771392 2020-09-16 19:07:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Most cars are now way too wide for our roadsHave you noticed how the width of roads has been reduced by parked cars! People are getting bigger so bigger cars but roads are not.
1306173283939889152 2020-09-16 18:09:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> George Osborne predicted the outbreak of World War 3 if we left the EU. I hope all the remainers remembered what they said before the referendum!
1306172596736712709 2020-09-16 18:06:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piers takes a total knob to the cleaners! See Piers you can still do it if you want to!😋
1306170263617318913 2020-09-16 17:57:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !
1306161596700524544 2020-09-16 17:22:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That goes without saying!
1306160262937014272 2020-09-16 17:17:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There you have it!If the BBC could rediscover how to make entertaining programs, of course I would watch but lately there hasn’t been many!
1306155930766045184 2020-09-16 17:00:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> In case it rains!😂
1306127176312352771 2020-09-16 15:06:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because Germany is the EU!
1306124817482035201 2020-09-16 14:56:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Poland is landlocked with solid borders.
1306116427661873153 2020-09-16 14:23:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> She will!
1306114505047453701 2020-09-16 14:15:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is child abuse ! That teacher needs to be sacked immediately!That teacher should not be kept in a position of trust.
1306113742170660865 2020-09-16 14:12:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A comprehensive answer to all the carping critics and saboteurs!
1306112150218387456 2020-09-16 14:06:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The point is if the BBC goes commercial who will watch their programs.?
1306110417576570881 2020-09-16 13:59:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Absolutely disgusting!
1306109764963840000 2020-09-16 13:56:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The key to success on television generally is to be an annoying gobshite.
1306106053294272513 2020-09-16 13:42:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Give it a bit of time!😋
1306105317856546816 2020-09-16 13:39:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope you enjoy Twitter!
1306104373005647877 2020-09-16 13:35:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Very good point! What the hell do they think they are doing, arrogant bunch of pillocks.
1306103661492424705 2020-09-16 13:32:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Take her to the cleaners Boris!
1306103200739713024 2020-09-16 13:30:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all ! 😋
1306102086824865792 2020-09-16 13:26:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Primary schools used to have drinking fountains. What happened to them? What happened to your child is shocking!
1306101000877596672 2020-09-16 13:21:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good morning to you !😋
1305968073854377986 2020-09-16 04:33:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If Piers got on his knee he would not be able to get up again! Him not a bad idea!
1305940903849320450 2020-09-16 02:45:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No he won’t . What I remember vividly on the day his death was announced was the look on Blair’s face when he got off the plane on arrival in Japan. He looked absolutely drained.
1305939512548364289 2020-09-16 02:40:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I hope Tony Blair loses sleep over this! Thanks again.
1305934724603543554 2020-09-16 02:21:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We all knew there was more to this sad event than what the official version was. A lot of unanswered questions!
1305933955502354432 2020-09-16 02:18:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for the information.
1305928537665351681 2020-09-16 01:56:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we must never forget doctor Kelly!
1305869252461826048 2020-09-15 22:01:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You took the words out of my mouth! What a self important, rude, ignorant and overpaid man Piers is!
1305868389018226688 2020-09-15 21:57:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not puff up this irritating windbag anymore!
1305839616017207296 2020-09-15 20:03:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Louisa they are completely mental !
1305839207563358209 2020-09-15 20:01:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is offensive because it shows up the embarrassing origins of ethnics. The truth is not popular.
1305838589259939840 2020-09-15 19:59:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I know! What is the end result all these people are looking for?
1305838139202850816 2020-09-15 19:57:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are right! Is there another country in the world quite like this ?
1305837779486756864 2020-09-15 19:56:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There are not all locked up yet !
1305835911037493248 2020-09-15 19:48:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Piss off Fritz !
1305825989423960064 2020-09-15 19:09:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Stick to your philisophying Descartes!
1305771429150044160 2020-09-15 15:32:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So Herr Gruppenfuhrer blockading food supplies isn’t an act of war then ?
1305769417557643265 2020-09-15 15:24:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Jeremy who ?
1305757043912040449 2020-09-15 14:35:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Macguire did not see the clip I saw.!
1305754776865566720 2020-09-15 14:26:13 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let us not forget that because of his meddling with Labour Party rules they ended up with Corbyn and couldn’t get rid of him.
1305752659668893696 2020-09-15 14:17:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Congratulations! Exciting day for you!😋
1305751109408092161 2020-09-15 14:11:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As always Blackford is playing to his audience in his banana republic!
1305749861283889153 2020-09-15 14:06:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you are one of these people who hate this country, off you go!
1305749673005719558 2020-09-15 14:05:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1305748458746322944 2020-09-15 14:01:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Mark!
1305747025292677121 2020-09-15 13:55:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! One up on all the treacherous bastards and John Major and Bliar we are looking at you !
1305620821336043520 2020-09-15 05:33:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great news!
1305580068174000135 2020-09-15 02:51:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> McFisheries!
1305547758548516870 2020-09-15 00:43:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Le singe proboscis!
1305529770680242178 2020-09-14 23:32:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There you have it !
1305529116117135361 2020-09-14 23:29:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So this program is been ethnically cleansed as well!
1305522545861550082 2020-09-14 23:03:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes that is very true!
1305504299502501888 2020-09-14 21:50:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We will be turning into a police state!
1305487347006439425 2020-09-14 20:43:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bien dit !😋
1305445597693046784 2020-09-14 17:57:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This morning Piers was inexcusable rude to a member of the public basically telling her she was a half wit and his weasel followed suit
1305425134073843717 2020-09-14 16:36:20 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cameron should shut his gob. He didn’t exactly cover himself in glory disappearing like a rat up a drain!
1305421024171884544 2020-09-14 16:20:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This morning Piers had the infernal cheek to say that we, i.e the British public who disagree with him, are the problem. He was smugly backed up by his weasel. Blacks can do no wrong for GMB.
1305419417153662976 2020-09-14 16:13:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is almost impossible to make an appointment with a GP at the moment and that’s a phone appointment. I fear the pandemic is been used as an excuse for a lot of things.
1305415248845864960 2020-09-14 15:57:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Never , it would never happen. For some people no matter how vilely  they behave the EU can do no wrong and this has been going on four years.
1305414370659381248 2020-09-14 15:53:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you are quite right there!It is utterly shocking!
1305400893509165056 2020-09-14 15:00:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is unbelievable! What is happening! It took my husband two hours on the phone just to get an appointment to get a blood test. He was No 47 in the queue at 08.15!
1305394397241061377 2020-09-14 14:34:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you for following me !😋
1305386341795061761 2020-09-14 14:02:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Des traitres !
1305385292904398849 2020-09-14 13:58:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know!
1305383838915473414 2020-09-14 13:52:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As soon as we actually leave there will be a massive campaign to rejoin the  EU! These  traitors want this country to fail and they want to plead to rejoin!
1305382665219170308 2020-09-14 13:47:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The only surprise is that they didn’t resurrect Hezelthine!
1305201564764770306 2020-09-14 01:47:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That really is saying something!😂
1305197783893278720 2020-09-14 01:32:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They have definitely had their day . The same applies to Gordon Brown.
1305141022557638657 2020-09-13 21:47:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am very sorry to hear that! It just doesn’t seem fair or right.
1305110213931028480 2020-09-13 19:44:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for your input!😋
1305104721523417088 2020-09-13 19:23:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> At the moment that is easier said than done given what we are dealing with! Sturgeon seems to be wrong footed at the moment. This could be the start of a slide.
1305103117009203207 2020-09-13 19:16:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Shetland and Orkney!
1305088128714264576 2020-09-13 18:17:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏🙏
1305081296025202694 2020-09-13 17:50:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So much for forensic! A good barrister checks his facts first!
1305080621941829633 2020-09-13 17:47:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No you are right he never does. Perhaps he is too busy with his repetitive vindictive rants! Mind you I don’t think he believes half of what he says.
1305079837690933248 2020-09-13 17:44:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Wouldn’t surprise me ! There is definitely something odd going on with all this !
1305076567849218050 2020-09-13 17:31:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks for the endorsement!😋
1305070856981409792 2020-09-13 17:08:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The enforcement they have is economic only!
1305070701381115904 2020-09-13 17:07:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No there isn’t!
1305033421543145475 2020-09-13 14:39:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is an unpleasant narcissist.
1305027577829089280 2020-09-13 14:16:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1305027255916257280 2020-09-13 14:15:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There’s only one answer to this. Show the EU Boris is not bluffing.
1304854564580057089 2020-09-13 02:49:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am surprised they haven’t dragged out the old fossil Hezeltine!
1304850772568551425 2020-09-13 02:34:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are they so side with vindictive bastards!
1304850051152384000 2020-09-13 02:31:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Perhaps it’s your age! Or maybe you laughed too much!😋
1304849533508161537 2020-09-13 02:29:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am most intrigued by your toilet fiasco!😂😂
1304847734227308544 2020-09-13 02:21:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They have turned up again likely the horrible creatures you find when you raise a paving stone.
1304823861901484032 2020-09-13 00:47:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The past is a beautiful country.
1304817466325991424 2020-09-13 00:21:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> About bloody time !
1304809748127191041 2020-09-12 23:51:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU is never criticised by the media .
1304809161738383360 2020-09-12 23:48:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😋😋😋
1304767007867506697 2020-09-12 21:01:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some of our natives don’t seem to have much respect either and seem proud of their ignorance of our past.
1304766519092695040 2020-09-12 20:59:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is unfortunately true.
1304759251701846016 2020-09-12 20:30:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sturgeon like stunned mullet!😍
1304751424123871237 2020-09-12 19:59:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Michael Gove is very good and careful with words and he doesn’t get wound up! A very good politician!
1304750416534687744 2020-09-12 19:55:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Headlines you would like to see:  3) Mayor Khan encased in concrete and put on a plinth in Trafalgar Square as part of an art installation!
1304749002630533120 2020-09-12 19:49:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Headlines you would like to see:  1) Kevin McGuire murdered in horrific illegal immigrant blood bath.  2) Gina Miller imprisoned in the Tower of London due to obscure ancient laws she did not know about!
1304743422318850049 2020-09-12 19:27:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Kevin Mcguire   is actually a nasty little man and he is sanctimonious with it.
1304739890454818818 2020-09-12 19:13:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What gives her the right her views? Who does she think she is? Who the hell voted for her?
1304739489621962752 2020-09-12 19:11:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you ask me this attitude has all been imported from America. A totally different environment!
1304672073701359621 2020-09-12 14:43:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1304670401864359936 2020-09-12 14:37:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sadly cannot see it happening anytime soon.
1304667480636502021 2020-09-12 14:25:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Americans have always been told a different tale about Ireland from the true ones and naively swallowed. It took terrorism on their own doorstep to change their mind.
1304665566314102784 2020-09-12 14:18:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because they can’t be bothered to take it home or find a bin. Someone else will pick it up. We were in Switzerland last year and there wasn’t an item of litter anywhere. It is all down to a different culture. The Swiss like to look after their country.
1304662326419820544 2020-09-12 14:05:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> More like a sodomite!
1304662019136684032 2020-09-12 14:03:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks Bernie!😋
1304661734477762560 2020-09-12 14:02:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! McGuire is a sneering disgrace!
1304661418051080192 2020-09-12 14:01:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Carry on the good work Effie!
1304660752129839104 2020-09-12 13:58:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The British Army has never been treated well after they served their purpose. I have seen photos of officers begging in the streets in 1920!
1304660138037567489 2020-09-12 13:56:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> But they know nothing about history and don’t care.
1304658006655807489 2020-09-12 13:48:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> With punishments like these no wonder the streets are so disorderly. The legal system has not backed the police for years.
1304494270506770438 2020-09-12 02:57:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure we will!😋
1304415739907014658 2020-09-11 21:45:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What diseases are they bringing in with them?
1304382382737420288 2020-09-11 19:32:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👏👏👏
1304382274713116672 2020-09-11 19:32:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Obviously! But they fear the contrary!
1304378661408313349 2020-09-11 19:18:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is absolutely disgusting!
1304365594175733761 2020-09-11 18:26:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Even the ridiculous McGuire could not be such a spanner! Fake news!
1304363855158575105 2020-09-11 18:19:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If they don’t do it properly it won’t be worth watching!
1304363510567239680 2020-09-11 18:17:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some remainers can’t accept it is happening and in their own private world still think they can stop it.
1304301651206066176 2020-09-11 14:12:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1304298975583965185 2020-09-11 14:01:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for them! They have resisted the infestation.
1304297679812472832 2020-09-11 13:56:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Today is the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain! Throw the book at the little shits!
1304297111111061508 2020-09-11 13:53:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Great stuff! Keep on battling these bullies!
1304296844609179649 2020-09-11 13:52:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Black lives don’t seem to matter to other blacks.
1304295857274134530 2020-09-11 13:48:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shockingly and very sadly you are right!
1304111558960836610 2020-09-11 01:36:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are welcome!🙏
1304110480613572608 2020-09-11 01:32:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I won’t be unfollowing you Sue! Thanks for following me!😋
1304104833360723979 2020-09-11 01:09:56 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Unfortunately some people lack curtesy.
1304093223045005312 2020-09-11 00:23:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is Gina actually been sponsored by the EU ?
1304092338860552192 2020-09-11 00:20:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nos Amis Europeens !😋
1304091217857310721 2020-09-11 00:15:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I thought it was about time somebody  dragged Gina out again! She is not an interfering witch is she?
1304072020892815360 2020-09-10 22:59:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Princess certainly, not of the people though!
1304071555392114695 2020-09-10 22:57:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> As soon as we leave the Remainers will be setting up a campaign to rejoin the EU. There will be problems and there they will be saying “I told you so”!
1304070086009946115 2020-09-10 22:51:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I wouldn’t worry about it any time soon!
1304068073213825024 2020-09-10 22:43:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Copy cat !😋
1304067791566376961 2020-09-10 22:42:44 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes definitely! The sooner the better! Jug ears should concentrate on his paintings. Bless him!
1304064143851388930 2020-09-10 22:28:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Because it is barely physically possible!
1304058868041998336 2020-09-10 22:07:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can remember politicians boasting they never read EU legislation before passing it through.
1304058040212246528 2020-09-10 22:03:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Know what you mean!
1304056751969501185 2020-09-10 21:58:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Once bitten .......😋
1304019572614459392 2020-09-10 19:31:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Piers we know you hate Hancock’s guts because he had the temerity to face you down live on television. Get over it !
1304018801575559169 2020-09-10 19:28:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1304018051503919104 2020-09-10 19:25:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I completely agree! These people are a complete pain in the neck! Haven’t we got enough to deal with! The police far too weak!
1304002848821309440 2020-09-10 18:24:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said Effie! We have dealt with tin pot dictators before!
1304000832581574659 2020-09-10 18:16:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU drove us into leaving by the means of pushing us to the limit and then beyond that. Others have found out that our patience although vast is not limitless. I think certain groups are again approaching our limits.
1303940624454955008 2020-09-10 14:17:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Let them stew in their own juice!
1303940327984762887 2020-09-10 14:16:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I would have left there indefinitely as an example to all.
1303939832289341440 2020-09-10 14:14:16 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU is the organisation that has never had its accounts signed off properly. No wonder Voerfstadt could afford his Austin Martin.
1303937520456142850 2020-09-10 14:05:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is an overpaid sanctimonious know all.
1303935100338475008 2020-09-10 13:55:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well of course they would!
1303764557446418433 2020-09-10 02:37:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Cannot say I have noticed. He seems to be floundering.
1303763304842768386 2020-09-10 02:32:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> GMB has actually changed since Morgan came back. It is now totally the Morgan show with little pretence at been anything else.
1303762491479072769 2020-09-10 02:29:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes exactly!
1303748849455058944 2020-09-10 01:35:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That’s  happening in Spain! Could happen here.
1303748423988973579 2020-09-10 01:33:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said 😋
1303739613853425664 2020-09-10 00:58:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you are a Muslim or BLM member don’t worry, it won’t apply to you.
1303737288619368448 2020-09-10 00:49:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Do we expect to ? No
1303737064849104896 2020-09-10 00:48:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No of course not! They are exempt!
1303734413113667584 2020-09-10 00:38:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I agree because certain people will still be able to run riot completely unchallenged so why should we go along with these restrictions.
1303733293481889793 2020-09-10 00:33:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The BBC has become infected by so called diversity and it will prove impossible to remove it.
1303731913425924098 2020-09-10 00:28:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And we all know diverse actually means black. Is there no end to all this nonsense!
1303722813145124865 2020-09-09 23:51:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It takes one to think he knows one !😋
1303696123106922497 2020-09-09 22:05:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! Heaven knows what some of his electorates are like? What’s their criteria? The number of sneering insults he comes out with?
1303690673040883716 2020-09-09 21:44:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not so brave then !
1303689706681573379 2020-09-09 21:40:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And also Khan just take a note of where the major viral outbreaks are. There’s a clue there. You are the last one who should preach at anyone.
1303687450515079169 2020-09-09 21:31:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Try blacking up !😋
1303686361501884418 2020-09-09 21:27:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is Starmer going to broadcast from his knees? If he does I’ll be watching!😂
1303686040104902656 2020-09-09 21:25:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We are wallowing in trash already on television without this nonsense!
1303680812999757827 2020-09-09 21:05:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A lot of SNP followers are anti democratic bullies, peddling false dreams.
1303671669580390400 2020-09-09 20:28:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is true! That would have been the nightmare scenario and we would have had Diane Abbott as Home Secretary.
1303666666560249857 2020-09-09 20:08:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It doesn’t bear thinking!🙈🙈
1303662006797586439 2020-09-09 19:50:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Certain groups are untouchable at the moment and much promoted. This is sowing  seeds for great problems in the future and for no good reason in this country.
1303660954945835008 2020-09-09 19:46:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer’s big mistake was the kneeling episode! He will never be allowed to forget it and rightly so. He showed total lack of judgement and the whole Labour ‘s Party silence about the Birmingham Stabbings has not helped.
1303659744754913285 2020-09-09 19:41:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Who is this Soubry woman? I seem to dimly recollect a sadly failed politician of that name!😋
1303613444978081794 2020-09-09 16:37:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And also leftist  lawyers eager to stir the shit and make money at the same time.
1303608194187571200 2020-09-09 16:16:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 👍👍
1303607919561314305 2020-09-09 16:15:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And bloody good riddance to them too!
1303607265610665984 2020-09-09 16:12:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Trumpet funfare ! At last some sense from David Lammy.
1303606827641380864 2020-09-09 16:11:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with all you say Julia . The BLM’s aim is to divide people and it seems to be working in some way.
1303602013444468736 2020-09-09 15:51:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Police, the media and politicians are a national disgrace!
1303579009423486977 2020-09-09 14:20:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You tell him!
1303577663571886081 2020-09-09 14:15:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂😂
1303577524702720001 2020-09-09 14:14:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are very welcome Clare 😋
1303576414344577027 2020-09-09 14:10:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mr Lammy you are black man with a massive big chip on his shoulders. We have established this, so now give it a rest!
1303572729640243205 2020-09-09 13:55:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes it does need repeating! This black favouritism is getting out of hand.
1303572258812841984 2020-09-09 13:53:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Liar, liar, baggy drawers on fire!
1303568910072131584 2020-09-09 13:40:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The same old story! They will be doing this until they are totally scraped. Why is the BBC so intent on talking this country down at every opportunity.
1303566038513135616 2020-09-09 13:28:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Will all demonstrations be banned then ?
1303398407533461505 2020-09-09 02:22:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good riddance!
1303373966174760960 2020-09-09 00:45:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hallelujah!
1303372285848551425 2020-09-09 00:39:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Mrs May should keep her trap shut!Pity she wasn’t so outspoken with the EU.
1303371817759932422 2020-09-09 00:37:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Macron remember Trafalgar! Another little man was put in his place.
1303369819652272129 2020-09-09 00:29:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is not so much biais as malevolent shit stirring! Anything to have a go at  Boris directly or indirectly! Piers Morgan just likes to get reactions and does not necessarily mean what he says.
1303360507810926592 2020-09-08 23:52:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said!
1303360297063845894 2020-09-08 23:51:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What I would really like to know is whether there are any lefties who are not half wits at the moment. It seems to go with the territory.  https://t.co/R6woJHynlT
1303359377622159361 2020-09-08 23:47:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Mr Mayor you seem to be doing your damndest to harm London ‘s economy and since when do you worry about all Londoners?
1303358177958821888 2020-09-08 23:42:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You can see why the libdems are absolutely nowhere! What is the point of them?
1303357474691575809 2020-09-08 23:40:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We can’t have that can we? Poor little sods!
1303356345656258560 2020-09-08 23:35:42 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Scottish Nasty Party strikes again !
1303353618171596802 2020-09-08 23:24:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ian Blackford! What a pig!
1303312661543780353 2020-09-08 20:42:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Some people don’t want to understand this!
1303271649870045185 2020-09-08 17:59:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes !
1303234508490244098 2020-09-08 15:31:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks !
1303228526536134657 2020-09-08 15:07:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes I agree! What has this country come to? Our  ancestors would be disgusted!
1303228012398358533 2020-09-08 15:05:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Gros connard .
1303224890716311552 2020-09-08 14:53:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Soubry should be going to a retirement home for bewildered failed politicians!
1303222309440937984 2020-09-08 14:43:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You are not missing much!😋  https://t.co/Attpza0f5e
1303222104926687237 2020-09-08 14:42:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know but I couldn’t resist it  ! Her hair is dyed raven black! She looks vile!
1303218426765365248 2020-09-08 14:27:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just seen Cherie Blair on GMB with the sound turned down. I presume she is talking about her new part in the new Adams Family film.
1303217848022691842 2020-09-08 14:25:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> You have said it all!
1303212926317277184 2020-09-08 14:05:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Christ help the English living in Scotland if Scotland became independent!
1303210958169538562 2020-09-08 13:57:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Supposed man of the people Piers Morgan and his silly sidekick Susana have not uttered one word about the Birmingham murder?
1303206393860812800 2020-09-08 13:39:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If a black is murdered the whole media is on it like flies to shit! White lives don’t seem to matter.
1303061785591902208 2020-09-08 04:05:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thank you !😋
1302995307593117697 2020-09-07 23:41:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a brave bunch you are Kent Police! Let us hope you are proud of yourselves!
1302980987517796354 2020-09-07 22:44:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Nothing! Sulk !
1302979789859549185 2020-09-07 22:39:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Tell that to the SNP MP’s
1302977585194954758 2020-09-07 22:30:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Hugh Grant and Patrick Stewart will be sitting with hands in heads!😋
1302976237737050114 2020-09-07 22:25:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes exactly!
1302975032625369091 2020-09-07 22:20:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Definitely not !
1302958664962248704 2020-09-07 21:15:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He also needs to be more honest with the general public and less stupidly PC. He is not fooling anyone.
1302958056561618944 2020-09-07 21:13:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The EU have got a bloody cheek, just because they are not getting their own way for once.
1302957701765517315 2020-09-07 21:11:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If the UK is in North Korea mode, then the EU has always  been   in Palermo mode ( if anyone is puzzled Palermo has always been a stronghold of the Mafia.
1302956091928707072 2020-09-07 21:05:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes give it a bone !
1302953003339702272 2020-09-07 20:52:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Starmer has no authority! The power such as it is lies elsewhere .
1302952552653299712 2020-09-07 20:51:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I still use mine!😋
1302939018586476547 2020-09-07 19:57:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The situation is in an historical context that we are once more standing up to a bully which no other country has yet been able to do. Perhaps our example will give other countries a bit more courage to stand up to this despotic crew.
1302937821217525761 2020-09-07 19:52:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is the Nikki Sturgeon show! She is the nearest thing we have to a “stand up politician “ and she is far from funny!
1302936248697458690 2020-09-07 19:46:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ils n’existent pas !
1302911982945865728 2020-09-07 18:09:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If there is I couldn’t think of one!
1302911760404549632 2020-09-07 18:09:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If there was I couldn’t think of one!
1302911215090511872 2020-09-07 18:06:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Is it because the actors are all dead except one and the BBC doesn’t have to pay them.
1302910848189509633 2020-09-07 18:05:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes many !
1302889851889618950 2020-09-07 16:42:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If by some mischance Scotland rejoined the EU they would be asked to join the Wehrmacht. The SNP has a history of assisting the German military!
1302889272731750400 2020-09-07 16:39:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes! Sometimes will find out don’t worry!
1302888191100432386 2020-09-07 16:35:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Forget the staff! What about their customers?
1302882248417517568 2020-09-07 16:11:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> They’re easily aroused!😋
1302857684933390336 2020-09-07 14:34:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If you like repetitive nonsense GMB is the program for you.
1302851101813809153 2020-09-07 14:08:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 😂😂
1302849740044992512 2020-09-07 14:02:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How is this silly myth perpetuated that the EU pays anything for us ?
1302849206349164546 2020-09-07 14:00:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they certainly will but it will come out.
1302848916531163136 2020-09-07 13:59:22 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is getting towards a no deal.
1302848611995115520 2020-09-07 13:58:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Plus ca change ......
1302848451743559680 2020-09-07 13:57:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I doubt the chief of police would have given such a pathetic explanation if the murderer had been white.
1302847923370242051 2020-09-07 13:55:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a stupid man this police chief is! He is excusing these barbaric acts. Shame on him !
1302845544306479114 2020-09-07 13:45:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! What were they doing for two hours? The police very cagey about this.
1302844951642898432 2020-09-07 13:43:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We all do Nigel ! It’s an inconvenient truth.
1302675830540324867 2020-09-07 02:31:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s all very deja vu !
1302668709148995591 2020-09-07 02:03:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!😋
1302666090682683392 2020-09-07 01:52:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I do too !
1302649811460591619 2020-09-07 00:48:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes Sky News we want an answer!
1302647377707364353 2020-09-07 00:38:31 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why do you think Tony? The truth was too unacceptable to broadcast. I know everyone is pandering to blacks but this is getting ridiculous.
1302645899399757824 2020-09-07 00:32:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This is the cleanest lemur in the world. He just needs to learn taps next.
1302645402823462914 2020-09-07 00:30:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not muddled, addled!😋
1302644658233847808 2020-09-07 00:27:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Fortunately I don’t have an employer anymore so can say what I like !
1302644204724719623 2020-09-07 00:25:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I like this idea!
1302641196163104769 2020-09-07 00:13:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good luck with that ! You’ve not at all got a chip on your shoulders have you!
1302640488386899968 2020-09-07 00:11:08 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We all know what it is code for !
1302640106348609537 2020-09-07 00:09:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It takes one to know one !😋
1302639349578838017 2020-09-07 00:06:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He seems to be a black man to whom life didn’t matter!
1302638791052742656 2020-09-07 00:04:24 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The police would rather not describe a black man as a back man rather than help public safety. What has this country come to?
1302637985230356483 2020-09-07 00:01:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes all too readily !
1302637220311052289 2020-09-06 23:58:09 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So do I !
1302625002328600577 2020-09-06 23:09:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Am I the only person in the world tired of the word “forensic” specially when used by jug ears.
1302603623428493314 2020-09-06 21:44:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are they keeping the lid on it? Why say that it’s not a hate crime?
1302599101670883330 2020-09-06 21:26:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What an idiot! So this was just an every day friendly knifing! Smelling a rat...
1302593093355679745 2020-09-06 21:02:49 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> And also tell us the same thing over and over again. Tedious!
1302569057028313088 2020-09-06 19:27:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This will lead to road accidents. There is too much going on.
1302568487362211840 2020-09-06 19:25:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Rab C Nesbitt had a good go at it but at least he is very funny and at times mocks the SNP. He is a realist.
1302560396289732610 2020-09-06 18:52:53 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Can you imagine Diane Abbott as Home Secretary?
1302559493549699072 2020-09-06 18:49:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Sounds exactly like the problems we have here.
1302556297255100416 2020-09-06 18:36:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The conclusion is that they are aiming for the easy target that won’t shout “racist” in their face. Certain groups are untouchable at the moment.
1302555816403308544 2020-09-06 18:34:41 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes, good question. Every British institution now lives in terror of been denounced as racist. This is the state we have got into.
1302553650745741313 2020-09-06 18:26:05 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not a great loss surely!😋
1302553071013199875 2020-09-06 18:23:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It’s a given!
1302543571329978368 2020-09-06 17:46:02 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I can just visualise what kind of exhibits are troubling them! Is there anything in the whole world that is not racist now!
1302506934264832001 2020-09-06 15:20:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No I wouldn’t say that ! I am sure there are many decent officers who are constantly undermined by their senior officers like Cressida Dike, oh sorry did I spell that wrong!🤭
1302505036304572418 2020-09-06 15:12:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes actually! Knowing the media’s records. It is obviously too big for the leftie media to cover up.
1302503871764459520 2020-09-06 15:08:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A lot of people in  Birmingham will know. Suspicious silence!
1302503540875759616 2020-09-06 15:06:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I cannot imagine who or what the perpetrator (s) is or are!🤔🤔
1302501866715123712 2020-09-06 15:00:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Have the EU thought how they are coming out to the rest of the world?
1302495326385954819 2020-09-06 14:34:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Channel 4 made no mention of the demonstration in Dover.
1302493097084047362 2020-09-06 14:25:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙏🙏🙏
1302492998698184705 2020-09-06 14:25:04 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> 🙈🙈🙈
1302491224444723202 2020-09-06 14:18:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This morning tried to brush off his comments as mere talk . We know which side they are on.
1302490667474718722 2020-09-06 14:15:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly! Far right just means anyone who doesn’t agree with them.
1302490331066306561 2020-09-06 14:14:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not at all! Enough is enough!
1302490114434707456 2020-09-06 14:13:37 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> To you Zarah most ordinary working class people are far right. At least they don’t parade around Brixton wearing uniforms. To you and your kind far right means anyone who doesn’t agree with you.
1302489483301003264 2020-09-06 14:11:06 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Being called names will not change our opinions.
1302489309728198656 2020-09-06 14:10:25 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly so! We are all fascists apparently! Madness!
1302488271348477952 2020-09-06 14:06:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I agree with you ! This was disgraceful!
1302487635806564353 2020-09-06 14:03:46 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I think a lot of people would look to someone else if there actually was anyone.
1302485682028449793 2020-09-06 13:56:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a useless bunch they truly are !
1302485046352375808 2020-09-06 13:53:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we are sick of these trouble making idiots! We are still in a pandemic!
1302484512669130752 2020-09-06 13:51:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am afraid the police will loose some of the sympathy they gained if they target their action in this way. Some groups seem to be virtually untouchable which is not on.
1302344669234425861 2020-09-06 04:35:40 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Not one bit ! It is blatantly obvious !
1302276126870581249 2020-09-06 00:03:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> David Olusoga seems to have made a whole career at the BBC talking about slavery and racism.
1302272930928361472 2020-09-05 23:50:36 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I am sure you would understand the word “scheisse”!😂
1302269205421662209 2020-09-05 23:35:48 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Exactly!
1302264502940037120 2020-09-05 23:17:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Quelle merde !
1302243295796625409 2020-09-05 21:52:50 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So true!
1302206227041128449 2020-09-05 19:25:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a stupid and thoughtless person Dawn Butler is!
1302168889254645762 2020-09-05 16:57:10 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What a stupid remark Dawn! These hippies are what we don’t need at the moment with all that is going on! You just want to stir up trouble in anyway you can.
1302135532173099008 2020-09-05 14:44:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> True !
1302126427014410240 2020-09-05 14:08:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What Lammy should be thinking is that if we get too many Britain will no longer be Britain.
1302124186689773569 2020-09-05 13:59:33 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Imbecilite
1302123161329324032 2020-09-05 13:55:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I know the world is going mad but this is totally ridiculous!
1301926500875329542 2020-09-05 00:54:01 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> A fine example of wishful thinking!
1301868732613099521 2020-09-04 21:04:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes they are! The fear is will we ever get back to normal after the pandemic is over?
1301828712288137216 2020-09-04 18:25:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The devolution was of course part of an overall EU plan to split up our country and make us less strong. It seems to have succeeded and causing sometimes malicious confusions and then blaming the Government who is stuck with it!
1301825915886936065 2020-09-04 18:14:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Maybe we should start with burning down our London mayor’s office ! I hope he’s not there!
1301820179408654336 2020-09-04 17:51:32 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Shocking ain’t it !😂
1301812458001256448 2020-09-04 17:20:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes we do!
1301759036203905024 2020-09-04 13:48:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Except GP’s and civil servants.
1301557134266597378 2020-09-04 00:26:17 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> How can one negotiate with this pathetic excuse for a statesman ?
1301496351906246658 2020-09-03 20:24:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good for Jacob the man in the smart suit!
1301494850064445440 2020-09-03 20:18:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Of course that’s the case!
1301481676690857986 2020-09-03 19:26:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I tell you what they would miss us if we were not bailing them out all the time. What a totally ungrateful and churlish bunch and Blackford is one of the worse.
1301458830618959873 2020-09-03 17:55:39 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> All the virtue signallers won’t recognise it until it is too late !
1301458236160258049 2020-09-03 17:53:18 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Left always takes the side of outsiders before their own people.
1301453598409322496 2020-09-03 17:34:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes , you have described the situation perfectly! It is very easy to cast the blame!
1301420538942951425 2020-09-03 15:23:30 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> I saw Kay Burley for the very first time this morning. What a vile witch!
1301419774027722752 2020-09-03 15:20:27 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The SNP deputy Prime Minister’s remarks is completely ridiculous. Who will take notice of this nonsense?
1301186837411778563 2020-09-02 23:54:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Thanks !
1301180312425201664 2020-09-02 23:28:55 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Labour people never want to look too smart for some peculiar ideological reason. As for their intelligence well who knows?
1301170504737476611 2020-09-02 22:49:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Did not mean to! I am trying to think of a snappy remark but I can’t!🤔🤔
1301163904077312001 2020-09-02 22:23:43 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> What exactly is the one trick, not seen it. 😂
1301163556885454854 2020-09-02 22:22:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Even Starmer has standards!😋
1301163362357669888 2020-09-02 22:21:34 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We have seen the kneeling forensic man’s judgement on various matters and he has been found wanting! You can try and talk him up but good luck!
1301161579786928135 2020-09-02 22:14:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> No, not a sausage!
1301089193351839749 2020-09-02 17:26:51 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Bravo President Macron.! We are with Charlie Hebdo!
1301045035388096515 2020-09-02 14:31:23 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Correct ! and rightly so.
1301042533183696897 2020-09-02 14:21:26 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Just what we need in London for 10 days, hordes of sillly hippies causing disruption!
1301041031631327238 2020-09-02 14:15:28 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question!
1301039523909062658 2020-09-02 14:09:29 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> So sorry for your loss.
1301037802717622272 2020-09-02 14:02:38 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> This just confirms how unhinged the SNP really are!
1301036683463454722 2020-09-02 13:58:12 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Difficult to say, I am not watching it!
1301033880431013893 2020-09-02 13:47:03 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The poor old sod does not understand does he?
1300800770128973824 2020-09-01 22:20:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> That is so sad!
1300774154434740225 2020-09-01 20:35:00 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> If they go on strike no one will notice anyway!
1300773393353109505 2020-09-01 20:31:58 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Ironic ain’t it ?
1300760310861762562 2020-09-01 19:39:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good question! It has  been admitted by some senior politicians that we should probably never has joined in the first place.
1300748566659506177 2020-09-01 18:53:19 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> He is a bit more impressive not to say more positive than Kevin!
1300748221094993922 2020-09-01 18:51:57 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> The Police are scared of certain targets. We all know who they are.
1300747817896603649 2020-09-01 18:50:21 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Or perhaps not! The BBC would like to see Brexit fail miserably !
1300737709829500928 2020-09-01 18:10:11 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> There’s a surprise! There are different rules for different people! The Police needs to man up and deal with ethnics who are contemptuous of the law. The law should apply equally to all !
1300735879569379329 2020-09-01 18:02:54 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Oh dear what a big hole in their contributions! Oh dear never mind! Mrs Merkel was very quick to give Cameron when he was actually asking for very little!
1300734203026436096 2020-09-01 17:56:15 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> We never hear about the British Brexit negotiators just what Barnier has to say! Why?
1300732779026681856 2020-09-01 17:50:35 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Monsieur Barnier!
1300701112723476487 2020-09-01 15:44:45 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Why are they not fined ?😡
1300700730395963392 2020-09-01 15:43:14 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Well said! Give it a rest Starmer!
1300674495791931394 2020-09-01 13:58:59 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> It is quite odd how all the ad agencies have launched on to this theme at once !
1300673939161722882 2020-09-01 13:56:47 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Get there and sort it out then Dawn! See how far you get!
1300672009752514568 2020-09-01 13:49:07 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Good point!
1300671195407437824 2020-09-01 13:45:52 +0800 <ClaireH38655873> Yes you would think they would!
