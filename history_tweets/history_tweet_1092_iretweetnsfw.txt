1337678984306278400 2020-12-12 16:41:37 +0800 <iretweetnsfw> @rjo727 @Azura__xx They would say that they were German First and Jews second, but that didn't save them. So I guess the mixing with goy as a strategy to escape prosecution is seen as futile now? The main problem always has and always will be lack of trust between factions and selfidentities

If people stopped self identifying as faction X, maybe faction Z would not be suspicious of them, but maybe not. Its a lose lose situation.

It should have been two female sisters making each other squirt, then it would not be incest sin. Im beginning to belive porn is teaching people to like evil.  There must be Calvinist porn. e.g. 700 wifes of Solomon make eachother sqirt.
