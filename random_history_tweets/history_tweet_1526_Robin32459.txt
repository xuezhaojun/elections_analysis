Now if you're talking trump. And it's not Democrats who are trying to overturn a fair election but again it's trump.

Investigation into possible crimes are not coup . But trump's attempts to overthrow the  election results is a coup attempt.

Use your common sense you really think they're going to fix the election so Biden can win without guaranteeing that they had control of Congress too?  And trump lost in Repubican states too and he never had over 45% approval.

Georgia counted three times and Biden won every time. Just because trump said there was no way he can lose without cheating doesn't make it true. Trump lost fairly.

The election is over. Your rigging of the election failed because you underestimate how terrible you are and how unpopular you are.

1337336636124827650 2020-12-11 18:01:15 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Because before there was no reason to report on Hunter and there still isn't, he is a private citizen who's taxes are being investigated. By the way has the IRS stopped investigating yours yet?
1337249166913908738 2020-12-11 12:13:40 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump By the way it's 74,000,000 but Biden got 81,000,000 that's 7,000,000 more than you
1337248195785748481 2020-12-11 12:09:49 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump You lost.  The news may not have known even your propaganda stations didn't report on it. As for the FBI maybe they kept it quiet for the same reason they kept the investigation they had on you quiet in 2016. Besides Hunter is not Joe.

I strongly believe that the only reason they're on Hunter because they can't find anything on his Dad so they're trying to find it here.

We should investigate like we should investigate all the allegations on the trump's(which look credible) it time for the Repubicans to stop bending over for trump and investigate all the allegations on trump
1336987552704847872 2020-12-10 18:54:07 +0800 <Robin32459> @ChuckGrassley Investigation into something doesn't mean the person is guilty of it. But I am wondering if the Repubs like you are using this to attack Hunter's dad
1336979934888210433 2020-12-10 18:23:51 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I am looking no further than you. You tried to rig it before the election and now you're trying to steal my vote and others like mine. You lost both popularity and electorally this time.

1336880855088828416 2020-12-10 11:50:08 +0800 <Robin32459> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump But unlike trump, Nixon was at least a patriot and knew when to leave.

1335641695233437698 2020-12-07 01:46:09 +0800 <Robin32459> @Bella_Marie70 @Anythingpork Yes he did and we don't know how much of his salary he gave away.
1335640696418689029 2020-12-07 01:42:11 +0800 <Robin32459> @TheSundayCC @Anythingpork It is according to a government website Obama golfed half of what trump did and at very little cost because it was usually at   some place like Camp David.
1335635716383133697 2020-12-07 01:22:24 +0800 <Robin32459> @jacobkschneider @realDonaldTrump Never was our president. Oh he had the job but never did it

1335416851585757184 2020-12-06 10:52:42 +0800 <Robin32459> @kmindeye @_Mammalsauce_ @davidmweissman @BrianKempGA I voted for the Democrats and am not dead. I can tell you my sister and nephew also voted Democrat and are alive. If there was fraud in PA than there was fraud in Ohio. I call bull on this election was fixed by the Dems. Slowing down the mail didn't work like trump hoped so he's

Once checked if it's mail in is separated from the vote as should be. Who I vote for is my business (wasn't trump). But the Senate race has nothing to do with the Presidental one. #trumplost move on

1332094598143946757 2020-11-27 06:51:15 +0800 <Robin32459> @LisaHagan7 That in 55 days it will no longer be trump
1332073013626482688 2020-11-27 05:25:29 +0800 <Robin32459> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Amen
1332072899759497219 2020-11-27 05:25:02 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Good for them. And no thanks to you.
1332072340595871747 2020-11-27 05:22:49 +0800 <Robin32459> @Hawkeye67ky @BlueRobotDesign @realDonaldTrump No 80,000,000 voted Biden.
1332072066980384773 2020-11-27 05:21:44 +0800 <Robin32459> @DaxGigandet No
1332056924184047618 2020-11-27 04:21:33 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel Last
1332056832265818122 2020-11-27 04:21:11 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel No, he would still have lost.
1332046784563212289 2020-11-27 03:41:16 +0800 <Robin32459> @mhdksafa Followers=people. So keep demanding human rights and justice here.
1332034364335661058 2020-11-27 02:51:55 +0800 <Robin32459> @MontanaDan30 Congratulations!
1332034143744626692 2020-11-27 02:51:02 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel True
1332033849870651393 2020-11-27 02:49:52 +0800 <Robin32459> @MontanaDan30 The no stubble one. You look more happy there.
1331999388948967426 2020-11-27 00:32:56 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump I was thinking there is no way you who had no more than 40% popularity the whole time you was president got 47% of the vote. So Biden should have had more votes.
1331995093323165696 2020-11-27 00:15:52 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel hope they do and win

1331553748288745477 2020-11-25 19:02:07 +0800 <Robin32459> @realTuckFrumper The Electoral college needs to go. So I am fine with that

1331542831039647744 2020-11-25 18:18:44 +0800 <Robin32459> @ArleneSchloss @LetsGoWVPower @Lrihendry Same here
1331542029483057153 2020-11-25 18:15:33 +0800 <Robin32459> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump So? Once the signature is verified the envelope is not needed.
1331445119971635200 2020-11-25 11:50:28 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel I would be happy to see that

1331372414303866880 2020-11-25 07:01:33 +0800 <Robin32459> @DaxGigandet Brown and Postman
1331359042716000256 2020-11-25 06:08:25 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump That is why we voted you out of the White House
1331271638768365568 2020-11-25 00:21:07 +0800 <Robin32459> @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump Doesn't matter trump lost and acted like a baby

1331231522238701575 2020-11-24 21:41:42 +0800 <Robin32459> @Alliseria1 @HaefeleJohn @realDonaldTrump I learned that in civic class about impeachment maybe instead of attacking someone you should check out about impeachment first. trump, Clinton and A Johnson were all impeached
1331179822362537985 2020-11-24 18:16:16 +0800 <Robin32459> @Alliseria1 @HaefeleJohn @realDonaldTrump He was impeached. The House impeached him just like Clinton and A. Johnson. Impeachment happens in the House and being removed from office happens in the Senate.
1331116775413526528 2020-11-24 14:05:44 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel Good
1331112197678837760 2020-11-24 13:47:33 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump The most corrupt election in American history is the one that got you in the Oval Office.
1331043982743392256 2020-11-24 09:16:29 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Loyalty to you is not loyalty to the country but the opposite
1330951695665418251 2020-11-24 03:09:46 +0800 <Robin32459> @MontanaDan30 No you're not.

1330819003032477696 2020-11-23 18:22:30 +0800 <Robin32459> @PalmerReport It makes sense to. Because trump isn't going to do the transfer of power and Biden's people need to hit the road running
1330750235438616577 2020-11-23 13:49:14 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump The ones you won?
1330749873755402246 2020-11-23 13:47:48 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews No you lost the election both popularity and the electoral college votes . Your cheats didn't get you the election this time

1330637093643694087 2020-11-23 06:19:39 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel Pardoning trump will not unify the country. I not sure what would unite us but proving beyond any doubt of his guilt ( or lack thereof) would be a step in the right direction.
1330625141701799938 2020-11-23 05:32:10 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel Not this time and I doubt in 2024 either

1330578758844248065 2020-11-23 02:27:51 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Stop your bs. Your observers wasn't stop from observing. You lost Pennsylvania fair and square.
1330520989642448896 2020-11-22 22:38:18 +0800 <Robin32459> @MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Pardoning trump will not unify the country.

I don't yet get why the GOP picked him. As for Biden seems all there and healthy if he sets it up right we don't have to worry about him

1329549408988516353 2020-11-20 06:17:35 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump You withdraw because you was losing the lawsuit and you still lost Michigan.  Stop tweeting about this and go back to pretending to do your job.
1329501528927952899 2020-11-20 03:07:20 +0800 <Robin32459> @NickAdamsinUSA Was. Now he's a joke.

1329419183965282304 2020-11-19 21:40:07 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Bs. Biden had more votes than anyone ever including you. And if the Dems bhad rigged it McConnell, Graham Collins and Jordan to name a few would have lost too guaranteed.
1329417667032346624 2020-11-19 21:34:05 +0800 <Robin32459> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump He mostly ignored his public duties of presidency anyways. He is a disgrace.
1329379950844145671 2020-11-19 19:04:13 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Give it a break

1329139848263905282 2020-11-19 03:10:08 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel That's because they lost and they drink trump's kool aid

As for stuttering he has a speech impediment and you should not pick on our President elect for it. Exspecially since you overlook trump slurring, forgetting and stuttering (no impediments) and not knowing where he is.

1328732619203371015 2020-11-18 00:11:57 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel No he doesn't deserve credit the doctors nurses and scientists do.
1328655855592611840 2020-11-17 19:06:55 +0800 <Robin32459> @CarmineSabia Ño , if they found 2600 votes and 800 was then it stands to reason 1800 goes to Biden. If there was a scam it benefited trump not Biden .
1328629077943717889 2020-11-17 17:20:31 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump The rate of rejection doesn't mean anything more than there was less errors and both parties had observers there at first they were farer away than at the end but they were there

1328533675131211776 2020-11-17 11:01:25 +0800 <Robin32459> @DaxGigandet Raising minimum wage to a livable one.

1328529983107702784 2020-11-17 10:46:45 +0800 <Robin32459> @HeemsR6 @SoySauceR6 @Exo_R6 @JoeBiden Not everyone can work 2 jobs. And if you work for minimum wage there is no fun for years you're just getting by if you can. By the way minimum wage is less than 11.15 an hour you gave for getting by.

1328522389861306369 2020-11-17 10:16:35 +0800 <Robin32459> @HeemsR6 @Exo_R6 @JoeBiden to get jobs they most likely get flipping burgers.
1328521911081574400 2020-11-17 10:14:41 +0800 <Robin32459> @HeemsR6 @Exo_R6 @JoeBiden I am a factory worker too.I worked there for over 25 years I make less than 15 dollars an hour.quit Workers at my job start out at just above minimum wage with a small raise of $0.10 a month until they get to top rate. So I can tell you people aren't going to quit working to try
1328509186590830592 2020-11-17 09:24:07 +0800 <Robin32459> @LisaHagan7 Yes
1328483204794363905 2020-11-17 07:40:52 +0800 <Robin32459> @twfarlan I don't know but it's a step in the right direction this poor person is tired of supporting the rich and they need to pull their own weight.
1328479553866637314 2020-11-17 07:26:22 +0800 <Robin32459> @HeemsR6 @Exo_R6 @JoeBiden The factory workers would be making 15 dollars an hour too. How would that close the factories?

1328477749594509312 2020-11-17 07:19:12 +0800 <Robin32459> @JammoPub @JoeBiden Give that tired lie a rest. Wages have been where they are for years yet prices keep going up. Also if they stop giving the CEOs raises and bonuses and give these to the blue collar workers instead it would be fairer and prices wouldn't be  higher than we keep giving to the rich.
1328475571295293448 2020-11-17 07:10:32 +0800 <Robin32459> @twfarlan @JoeBiden @MatthewWForeman He said he was going to raise the tax on them making over 400,000

1328449335953125376 2020-11-17 05:26:17 +0800 <Robin32459> @IvankaTrump American household finances are not in the best shape that they been in decades but right now worse than they were. You need to stop lying to make your dad look better.

1328134301133713408 2020-11-16 08:34:27 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump trump is Anti American
1328130722641694723 2020-11-16 08:20:14 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Bs if you had proof you would have showed it by now. This you being a whiny crybaby. Get over it you lost
1328128633932812289 2020-11-16 08:11:56 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump It is not progress. It's the guy who says he's our president attacking a quarter of the country when he is suppose to be working for them. But  that is why they voted for Biden.
1328124440920592385 2020-11-16 07:55:16 +0800 <Robin32459> @lightening801 @PatrickNova6 @realDonaldTrump Sorry but it's totally true.

1328080419221336067 2020-11-16 05:00:21 +0800 <Robin32459> @ShenanigansByD Still using the NBA championship celebration to make it look like trump is more popular than he is?
1328079427645870082 2020-11-16 04:56:24 +0800 <Robin32459> @ShenanigansByD I know he won and it wasn't a million  I think the last count was at less then 100,000 people. #BidenPresident
1328077103041044480 2020-11-16 04:47:10 +0800 <Robin32459> @LibertyxLiberty @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump He didn't win the popular vote.  He never got over 40% -45%  in popularity as president and he got 47% of the vote so he stayed pretty much around the same popularity here. And if you don't count trump's and the GOP leadership in some states actions there was no cheating.

1328043946153570305 2020-11-16 02:35:25 +0800 <Robin32459> @IvankaTrump There has been violence against liberals too. Your dad even was part of one instance. Violence is not the answer and instigators must be condemned and prosecuted be they liberals, conservatives, or your father. And people like you should stop blaming only one side. Stop your bs.
1327984038670454786 2020-11-15 22:37:22 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump There was no fraud. You lost for real. If it was rigged McConnell, Graham, Collins,Jordan, and etc wouldn't have won
1327979464136028166 2020-11-15 22:19:11 +0800 <Robin32459> @texaradogirl Yes, the Proud boys who support trump

1327955522188873731 2020-11-15 20:44:03 +0800 <Robin32459> @FoxNews It's a shame that some trump's supporters and some non supporters were violence. It's even more shameful that tramp only attacks an idea but seems okay with his supporters attacking others

1327874643940823042 2020-11-15 15:22:40 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Real news will never say it because it's not true.
1327873213645418496 2020-11-15 15:16:59 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump @nypost Yet it's you and your children who are barred from running charities because you cheated them.

He did say that his State along with 7 others wanted to have their experts to approve it so their citizens would feel safe using it and considering that trump has lied to us from the start good idea to do.
1327757248161079296 2020-11-15 07:36:11 +0800 <Robin32459> @jenahoge13 @CNNSitRoom Yes trump does but we have to wait until January 20.

1326710718683557888 2020-11-12 10:17:39 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump But Biden got more votes 5 million more than you and it's still widening.   And I hope RNC  rids itself of Ronna McDaniel as a leader. They need someone who is honest in that role.
1326709542663704576 2020-11-12 10:12:58 +0800 <Robin32459> @LogicalFallac18 @Phillip2020Vote @24sales2U @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Because he is respectful

1320732028673863682 2020-10-26 22:20:28 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump The person who called his wife (Melania) Melanie , Tim Cook calling him Tim Apple and others by names that's not theirs has no room to complain. And by the way no one is covering up anything unless it's you
1320717426443636737 2020-10-26 21:22:26 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Oh by the way you lose the voting numbers in 2016 Hillary got them.

1320715156595376130 2020-10-26 21:13:25 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Real news are reporting it because people are dying from it. And thanks to you that will continue until after Biden replaces you in January.

Secondly Obama is now a private citizen and like the other 3 expresidents don't have to show his taxes. What you say applies more to trump than Obama

1320047387604373506 2020-10-25 00:59:57 +0800 <Robin32459> True
1320046948066512899 2020-10-25 00:58:12 +0800 <Robin32459> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump It helps that the first three were already at peace with each other. And I doubt that he had anything to do with Serbia-Kosovo either.
1320045150475816963 2020-10-25 00:51:03 +0800 <Robin32459> @KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump Biden won the debate

1319853679600717836 2020-10-24 12:10:13 +0800 <Robin32459> @laurie_ohio Yes
1319853399211388928 2020-10-24 12:09:06 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel Biden. He was part of Obama's admin. when they turned the economy around and he might be able to do so again.
1319852362706681856 2020-10-24 12:04:59 +0800 <Robin32459> @DaxGigandet The first name that comes to mind Anne Wilson but I never thought about who my favorite female (or male) singer was
1319851008923754496 2020-10-24 11:59:36 +0800 <Robin32459> @BBehnke84 @FoxNews We should investigate too. But the accused (US) should be investigated by someone else also. If we are guilty and we're the only ones investigating it's very easy to say we did nothing wrong and continue doing it.
1319848673476562946 2020-10-24 11:50:20 +0800 <Robin32459> @Mgellis56 @FoxNews the violations that are said to be happening now should be first. I am fed up with the hypocrisy and fed up with the what abouts too. The past can't be fixed the present can be
1319846014572990479 2020-10-24 11:39:46 +0800 <Robin32459> @BBehnke84 @FoxNews When we are said to be violating human rights just like any other country we should be investigated by the UN. And we should allow it. We have no standing in calling others out on their human rights abuses if we are just as guilty
1319842629111132160 2020-10-24 11:26:18 +0800 <Robin32459> Exactly
1319842184917561351 2020-10-24 11:24:33 +0800 <Robin32459> @PhilSwindall @FoxNews @RepAOC What is anti- American about asking  the UN to investigate whether we treated people with dignity or not?
1319840075371393024 2020-10-24 11:16:10 +0800 <Robin32459> @BBehnke84 @FoxNews Then UN can investigate after the election then and should.
1319839381566464000 2020-10-24 11:13:24 +0800 <Robin32459> @JBBJ8 @FoxNews UnAmerican is what was said happened at the border detain centers. Standing up for others is suppose to be very American and that is what these ladies did.
1319838122096709632 2020-10-24 11:08:24 +0800 <Robin32459> @Mgellis56 @FoxNews There is a big difference between protecting and the way the detainees at the border was said to be treated and no one should be treated like that. So an investigation is needed
1319836176786784256 2020-10-24 11:00:40 +0800 <Robin32459> @FoxNews Let's pray that the UN does investigate

1319569221429415937 2020-10-23 17:19:53 +0800 <Robin32459> @JoeyWard1993 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump That's not how it works. Sometimes the better paying jobs aren't there and they what people with experience. And since most of the jobs that created are low wage jobs and/or part time it's even harder to fine a good paying job
1319567965776498689 2020-10-23 17:14:54 +0800 <Robin32459> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump That 290 is before taxes and health insurance. It be hard to live on that.
1319566776250867712 2020-10-23 17:10:10 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Biden did.

1319296191260205057 2020-10-22 23:14:57 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump I don't know if he said that or not but it sounds like the only reason you care about him is he's planning to vote for you. How arrogant of you
1319294316448198656 2020-10-22 23:07:31 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You didn't lead the vote even after the election Hillary won the popular vote and it should be her as president not you.

The Senate Repubicans and trump has done the same blocked better relief bills from the House. You have been playing politics yourself, blaming Democrats for your failure, rather than helping us.

Second Biden was there with Obama when they turned the economy around which does effect me. And since they slowed down under trump your statement is a lie.

1317219469274525697 2020-10-17 05:42:48 +0800 <Robin32459> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He's proven that the opposite is true.

1315640776332849152 2020-10-12 21:09:39 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Was it the left or was it the Radical Right?The Radical Right has proven that they can be violent.But acourse the racist jerk in the White House only blames the Left and does nothing but tweet about how bad the left is.There some violent zealots on the left and the "RIGHT"
1315637927142191104 2020-10-12 20:58:19 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump This is trump's America not Biden's yet. And the zealots on the left and the RIGHT need to be stopped. As the plan kidnapping of Michigan's Governor proves the violence is also  on the Right and exspecially trump supporters. If you want to blame anyone blame trump
1315635386794811392 2020-10-12 20:48:14 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump This is happening under trump. And he's trying to blame the guy who won't be in office until 1/20/21. By the way how do you know it was the left instead of trump supporters who did this?

Yes you can tell by 1 photo how shadows and reflections should be and unless there's a flag there unseen by us they don't line up right.
1312882715977560069 2020-10-05 06:30:06 +0800 <Robin32459> @SandiestPhoto @TigerGold59 @pp2boca @MetalBlonde True but maybe the video is photoshopped some how too. I don't know but the angles of the stripes don't line up like they should. It is just odd.

But mirror images and shadows can be lined up with the original one and the stripes in the mirror image on the table don't line up with the flag. They are at a different angle.

1312184542745124865 2020-10-03 08:15:48 +0800 <Robin32459> @realTuckFrumper Then Pence takes over and if he's unable to then it Pelois after that I'm not sure I think Secretary of State. They have a whole line of  who becomes president if trump is too sick to do his job ( in his case pretend to)

What was disgusting trump attacking the other son with things proven to be lies and the past drug problem. There was no reason to bring him up

But considering that health officials are asking people to social distance if he did it by web or tv from home what's the big deal? He's doing it right
1310322103195926536 2020-09-28 04:55:08 +0800 <Robin32459> @muskokabiggjohn @spectatorindex I'm hoping that's the case

1310294359057870854 2020-09-28 03:04:53 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Is that why your debates was so off and why your speeches and interviews are train wrecks? You're on drugs?
1310293693199536129 2020-09-28 03:02:15 +0800 <Robin32459> @realDonaldTrump Bs you picked her because you think she'll let you get away with your coup plan.

1310292112366333954 2020-09-28 02:55:58 +0800 <Robin32459> @realTuckFrumper Biden should demand that trump should too and it should be given in a way that he can't cheat

1310020773046870027 2020-09-27 08:57:45 +0800 <Robin32459> @danielledsouzag So? She has a family. What does that have to do with her qualifications to be a Supreme Court judge?
1310019270491992066 2020-09-27 08:51:47 +0800 <Robin32459> @charliekirk11 Why does that statement sound racist?  No one really cares about  her private life. And for your information there are people on the left that adopt and are people of faith

1309961690574921730 2020-09-27 05:02:59 +0800 <Robin32459> @politvidchannel trump already did that and if Biden wants to change what we have now going on  that's a good enough reason for me to vote Biden

Because if you wouldn't allow a vote on Obama's pick because 9 months before the election because it's too close to the election than one 6 weeks before the election is too close.

Now a person who has people say that he had sex with them when they was 13 and who said crude things to 13 years old but including their own daughter (trump) now that's a pedo. So you tell me do you want a sicko president?

If you pick on Biden's speech and not trump's then you're being a hypocrite. Because they both have made errors. In Biden's case some of it's his speech impairment and in trump's case I can't say but he use to speak

1302054588607066112 2020-09-05 09:22:59 +0800 <Robin32459> @FLOTUS @TheAtlantic Since he said similar things like this in the past he said it most likely. By the way I will believe anonymous sources over your husband anytime.
