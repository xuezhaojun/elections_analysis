1344065940586180611 2020-12-30 07:41:06 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @DWPippy Trump has McConnell adding elimination of Section 230 which basically ends free speech on Internet as no company can take liability for all users and a ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù bill. No voter fraud but they want to eliminate mail-in ballots as they can‚Äôt cheat through machines. #Extortion.

1341813091160494085 2020-12-24 02:29:05 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @JasonFyk Nope.
1341812620966432770 2020-12-24 02:27:13 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @ElieNYC No, now Trump &amp; Graham extortion. Must give up Section 230 which limits freedom of speech &amp; effectively kills Internet for the $2K

1341811970903826432 2020-12-24 02:24:38 +0800 <OMAPROUD> No you idiot. We will not give up our free speech or Internet
1341811671946436618 2020-12-24 02:23:26 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP. So Trump is basically extorting Americans for $2K to give up our freedom of speech and effectively kills Internet. No thank you!
1341811154692280323 2020-12-24 02:21:23 +0800 <OMAPROUD> No!  We will not be extorted to give up our freedom of speech and effectively kill Internet  for $2K.
1341810780593938434 2020-12-24 02:19:54 +0800 <OMAPROUD> So Trump‚Äôs offer if $2K is actually him extorting Americans to give up Section 230 thus eliminating our freedom of speech &amp; killing the Internet.

1341808971791921154 2020-12-24 02:12:43 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @JRehling This is Trump‚Äôs game. It‚Äôs not about $2K to everybody. It‚Äôs about extorting to get Section 230 taken out!  This, limiting our freedom of speech &amp; effectively killing Internet.
1341808458249744385 2020-12-24 02:10:40 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @everyone_blue No, Section 230 repeal limits our freedom of speech &amp; effectively kills the Internet. What company is going to take the liability for what users say?
1341808156142411779 2020-12-24 02:09:28 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @SpeakerPelosi DO NOT agree with this!  Limits our freedom of speech on Internet. Trump is using $2K carrot to get Section 230 taken out. He wants to take away our freedom of speech. This would kill Internet.

Trump‚Äôs attorneys claimed tv big not in court. Safe Harbor Day passed, Congress deadline. Electoral college certified.

1339619695452938241 2020-12-18 01:13:18 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @DEMS_R_GOP @AOC M4A is not popular. A public option would be popular as it goes with our capitalist society, can‚Äôt be called socialist and is the same as M4A. Much is about perception with American people. Like saying Defund the Police instead  of Reform the Police. Messaging matters.

She wasn‚Äôt afraid to stand up to him. @AOC has been gunning for Pelosi‚Äôs job since day one even with no real experience in government. Many are for progressive ideas. AOC can‚Äôt bulldoze House.
1339617510816145408 2020-12-18 01:04:38 +0800 <OMAPROUD> Does @AOC really think if @SpeakerPelosi were gone, she would be speaker?  After she ran people against incumbent Dems &amp; lost in General Election. After she started Defund the Police instead of Reform the Police &amp; scared voters away from the party? Radical &amp; entitled. Divisive.

Trump is trying for pardon but @JoeBiden pardoning would be political as suicide after Trump tried to overthrow our elections. Trump will try to get Pence to pardon.  Plus, Trump cheated to get into office.

Mueller report confirmed by Senate Intel report &amp; Stone trial. Trump conspired w/Putin &amp; Assange to get installed. He tried again for this election w/Ukraine. Why Trump was impeached. Many crimes since then.  Why he wants pardon

Hunter is private citizen.  @JoeBiden elected. Not Hunter. Trump under tax audit for 4 years now &amp; paid no or small amount taxes for years. Trump kids in Admin did corruption. #Hypocrisy.

Trump keeps stating he won election he lost, is inciting violence, insurrection, civil war, death threats, threats to overthrow of election, democracy &amp; US Constitution &amp; #Sedition. Seems Trumps doing criminal acts and needs to be exposed.

It‚Äôs only the country which is still red. I voted Biden/Harris as did a large portion of Texas. We also didn‚Äôt sign onto @KenPaxtonTX lawsuit &amp; using our tax $‚Äôa.

Trump Admin @FBI @DHSgov @CISAgov @DOJ &amp; others worked w/50 SOS to ensure safe election. No do-overs just because we voted Trump out!  Trump lost!

1332436470574034949 2020-11-28 05:29:44 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @SenateGOP. Heroes Act has been in Senate since May. No excuse for not passing this 2nd stimulus when Americans, small businesses, hospitals &amp; cities are struggling during pandemic.
1332435594065145859 2020-11-28 05:26:15 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @roper_93 I wonder, Trump reacts, as if he thought fix was in in voting machines &amp; they flipped votes like they accused Dems of doing. Mail-in votes were larger than he expected &amp; overwhelmed vote to @JoeBiden. They project everything they do. Explains why Trump keeps insisting he won

I think @JoeBiden can challenge &amp; win it. PA Legislature, even though GOP lead, said they would not do it.

1325836990504448001 2020-11-10 00:25:46 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @JSlanderz @vrundsa @daveweigel Exactly. I think reason Trump &amp; gang are so mad now is because their cheating didn‚Äôt work this time. FL counts were not adding up per poll watchers. I think they cheated in machines, w/USPS,  but because of COVID &amp; overwhelming voting, Dems lucked out this time w/mail-in ballots.

1325112274999275521 2020-11-08 00:26:00 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @CNN called for Biden/Harris!
1325111324322525185 2020-11-08 00:22:13 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @ShaolinPhan @jaketapper This video is very uplifting.
1325110869496311808 2020-11-08 00:20:25 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @RealJamesWoods Liberals/Democrats/Independents own guns, too. Get real. Just go away.
1325110325755179010 2020-11-08 00:18:15 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @joncoopertweets In hiding?  He should face prosecution.

1325109996762357763 2020-11-08 00:16:57 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @CyrusMMcQueen Yes, what could Trump tell @JoeBiden. Trump has done nothing right past 4 years.
1325109753002024966 2020-11-08 00:15:59 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @thomaskaine5 You got me. I didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt understand why people vote against their best interests , vote in a single issue or voted for Trump ever.
1325109442539630592 2020-11-08 00:14:45 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @essenviews I know I saw one just like that from a guy who said the same thing and said he was moving to Texas. It might be a joke.  If not, we need more education.
1325109204877766657 2020-11-08 00:13:48 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @KyleKulinski He will be indicted and so will his corrupt family before then.
1325108878653140998 2020-11-08 00:12:30 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @TexasMonthly @rez512 GOP caught flipping straight ticket Dem votes from Beto to Cruz in 2018. Voter suppression by GOP has continually been problem in black districts. Voters districts are gerrymandered. Texas GOP has constantly disenfranchised voters. Mail-in ballots almost overcame this cheating.
1325106871393529856 2020-11-08 00:04:32 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @realDonaldTrump You didn‚Äôt win. Get a grip. You are losing PA, GA, AZ &amp; NV. Concede already. It will be called &amp; certified. Face reality &amp; do what‚Äôs best for US. Act Presidential. Our democracy is precious. The voters have spoken.
1325106366764240897 2020-11-08 00:02:31 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @kurteichenwald @ProjectLincoln Exactly!  It seems to be @AOC and far-left, some Bernie Bros. Same ones who keep trying to divide Democratic Party. This must Stop!  We shouldn‚Äôt be shitting on our allies. @ProjectLincoln

1324477917334630402 2020-11-06 06:25:17 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @GeorgePapa19 @joebiden will win.

In the past month tRump and republicans have lost FIVE election law suits. Even republicans are calling tRumps  supposed law suits "frivilous" and a waste of time.

Cities take longer to count as more people. Nothing different than other elections except more mail-in ballots due to COVID. Election is checked by both Dems &amp; GOP at (2)
1324408336536739840 2020-11-06 01:48:48 +0800 <OMAPROUD> My response to Trump supporters &amp; some of my relatives: Trump supporters believed COVID not dangerous  because of Trump &amp; voted in person. Dems, Ind &amp; others voted heavily mail-in ballots due to concerns from COVID. That is what they are counting now. (1)

We are a capitalist country with social programs for the good of taxpayers like roads, police, Social Security, etc. These people just eat up disinformation like a cult.

These votes are being counted as in all elections. Trump supporters convinced by him not to wear masks &amp; they COViD isn‚Äôt real, voted in person. Mail-in ballots being counted now. #Sycophant

1324226868770304000 2020-11-05 13:47:43 +0800 <OMAPROUD> Yeah they think they can intimidate people into giving Trump the election. It doesn‚Äôt work that way but they are following their leader. Now Trump &amp; Barr send in DOJ federal agents to keep intimidation going. It‚Äôs just like Russia!

1324029657524670465 2020-11-05 00:44:04 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @StevenBeschloss Or Trump GOP flipped votes in the voting machines like in Texas in 2018 ( Beto &amp; Cruz) or they used Ivanka‚Äôs China voting machines or they used the Internet attachments to add votes.  So many possibilities since all they do is cheat. Trump only wants to count votes for him.
1324028910653366272 2020-11-05 00:41:06 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @politvidchannel You‚Äôre nuts. Or possibly Trump &amp; GOP cheated by flipping votes like in Texas 2018 or they used Ivanka‚Äôs voting machines from China. Mail-in ballots haven‚Äôt been counted! Blocking you.

1321261121609834497 2020-10-28 09:22:53 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @lifesashow What about the way she spoke to him?  He was trying to talk to her when she lost it.

1321260132739784707 2020-10-28 09:18:58 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @lifesashow Yosef told her the truth. She started yelling at him and attacking him first. I can‚Äôt feel sorry for Clare. She is manipulative.
1321259502482706437 2020-10-28 09:16:27 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @noraallens She was classless in stripping guys down last week. How many would put up w/that in reverse. Having Bachelor strip down women?  She is crazy narcissist &amp; went off on them because not enough attention. She‚Äôs already chosen Dale which is unfair to rest of the guys.
1321258819977170944 2020-10-28 09:13:45 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @lanarosay No, he told the truth. Clare is classless having the guys strip down. If they had women do that there would have been total outrage. Clare is being unfair to the guys choosing Dale already  and is crazy narcissist.

Guess you are fine with 225,000+ dead and 400,000 by Jan 2021. It‚Äôs irresponsible not to contain when possible. The rest of the world is doing it.

Trump Admin turned them into concentration camps, separated families &amp; kids then didn‚Äôt keep any way to reunite them after deporting parents. Just like Nazi Germany. Shameful.

If Barrett is confirmed, it swings SC far-right with no middle decisions. That means Roe v Wade being overturned as Barrett is not pro-choice &amp;  voting down ACA in November. This is unacceptable.

1313120119522983936 2020-10-05 22:13:27 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @dbongino Dan Rather served in war zones as journalist. Where was Trump?  At home with fake reasons for avoiding the draft. Your trying to diss Rather, a national icon, won‚Äôt work. Rather has always reported straight up to American people unlike Trump Admin clown show. @DanRather
1313118964814426114 2020-10-05 22:08:52 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @Yamiche Trump trying not to look insane. Sorry, that ship sailed with the drive-by.

1311798259506122752 2020-10-02 06:40:51 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @Tomsblessed @WatchChad Trump is losing nationwide. People are seeing him for what he is. A wanna-be dictator who would take our democracy &amp; a racist. Only people who are racist or don‚Äôt care about our democracy will now vote for him.

Her extreme views pushing women back to 1950‚Äôs is. Her voting to take away ACA is. Her voting to make Trump President again, &amp; thus dictator, over voters wishes is.

Start impeachment proceedings against Barr &amp; Trump? Dictatorship? Chaos? Do something!
1309195050736324609 2020-09-25 02:16:38 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @gallagdy @ericawerner I do believe ALL of Congress should stop Trump now and I am tweeting to them to do that. To impeach he &amp; Barr for #AbuseOfPower #Sedition #Treason  if Trump does steal election, shit will hit the fan w/American people in the streets. You could tweet them also.

1309194323855110148 2020-09-25 02:13:45 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @SenatorCollins Trump has threatened EO to stop Biden from being President, threatened cancelling elections, tried to destroy USPS, lied about mail-in ballots &amp; plans to steal states Biden wins through cheating. Trump is dangerous to our democracy. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP need to get him out now!
1309193560965742594 2020-09-25 02:10:43 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @gallagdy @ericawerner It‚Äôs true though. Trump moves toward dictatorship. Unless we overwhelm vote, he will win. Our democracy will be lost. At least, even if he steals Presidency, if we win both houses of Congress, Dems could impeach his ass.

Force GOP to choose NOW for democracy.

There are debates already setup. Why would he debate with a conservative gotcha host who is trying to help Trump. Chris Wallace  of Fox News  is already hosting debate.

How many more will die needlessly because he didn‚Äôt act to contain

1301348181884706816 2020-09-03 10:35:59 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @Savion No, @SpeakerPelosi is awesome in standing up to Trump. Maybe pay attention to moving US forward by getting rid of wanna-be dictator Trump!
1301347744548818944 2020-09-03 10:34:14 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @KellyannePolls You said you were leaving politics for your kids. That lasted less than a day. We see how important your family is to you. Leave @SpeakerPelosi alone. Her personal hygiene is not your concern.

1300637553847140352 2020-09-01 11:32:12 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @DanCrenshawTX Trump has incited violence since first campaign. @FBI &amp; @DHS has stated majority of #BLM protesters are peaceful. They said ANTIFA is not organized &amp; white supremacists &amp; anarchists are shooting cops, starting fires &amp; chaos to start race war. Not the left who just wants equality.
1300636479006412800 2020-09-01 11:27:55 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @Acyn Is he talking about the Eric Prince people he was planning to bring in or possibly the unmarked uniformed guys he sent into Portland.  Trump is trying to overthrow our government. For Putin. And dictatorship.
1300635623397695490 2020-09-01 11:24:31 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @Acyn He just makes up shit.
1300635172493234176 2020-09-01 11:22:44 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @PodSaveAmerica @realDonaldTrump The truth. The guy you‚Äôre defending was the aggressor &amp; went there because you incited violence in white supremacists. Just like white supremacists who crossed state lines into Portland w/another killing last weekend.
1300633552678199297 2020-09-01 11:16:18 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @RKJ65 Looks really good to me.

1300632549966872577 2020-09-01 11:12:19 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @SenRonJohnson @GovEvers Exactly. Trump is divisive, incites violence. It‚Äôs unfuckingbelievable that he is our President installed by Putin &amp; @SenateGOP @HouseGOP is complicit. #Treason

1300632139986284545 2020-09-01 11:10:41 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @RepDougCollins Flynn was Russian agent along w/Manafort. Flynn confessed twice. Page, Trump, Kushner, Stone.   They were all working w/Assange &amp; Putin to install Trump illegally in 2016. Mueller, Senate Intel Report &amp; Stone trial all confirmed conspiracy. #Treason

I worry about my family‚Äôs future. 4 years of Trump destroying our country &amp; democracy has felt like a lifetime. Cruelty, hatefulness, division. I want our US back. We are all Americans...let‚Äôs act like it.  Plus, we get Kamala, too! #ImVotingForJoe

1300621240508592128 2020-09-01 10:27:22 +0800 <OMAPROUD> The truth about Kenosha.... 17 yr old shot someone in the face. This guy tried to stop him and was shot in the chest.
1300620052161536000 2020-09-01 10:22:39 +0800 <OMAPROUD> @ClaireBerlinski I didn‚Äôt read your entire book. No one said all white people are racists. Anyone still supporting this racist, unstable President must be racist as it makes rest of us sick to our stomach. Trump is inciting violence by ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù while white supremacists carry out his orders.
