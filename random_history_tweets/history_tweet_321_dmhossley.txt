1343995109226983427 2020-12-30 02:59:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden This is an emergency. With that erratic loser in the white house who knows what he will do when he starts his shit about being robbed. I don't ever remember feeling that a president was so self serving and actually acting in a treasonous manner.
1343993343534133248 2020-12-30 02:52:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @RepsForBiden @GovChristie I just saw an article saying people are taking up golf to lose weight that they gained during the pandemic. What the hell is going on with trump. He's golfing everyday and is gaining weight.
1343767710539411456 2020-12-29 11:56:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Look at this picture. It is the picture of a loser asshole.

1343764231267749889 2020-12-29 11:42:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The profile of a fat triple chin.
1343763340808646658 2020-12-29 11:38:41 +0800 <dmhossley> Gop congessman sues Pence over election certification. How much more crazyness do we have to endure?  I hope we can figure out how to protect our country from a donald trump harming us again!.  Is loser trump warm and his stomach full tonight?
1343760559792140289 2020-12-29 11:27:37 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump is still golfing.

1341857660875005954 2020-12-24 05:26:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @JRubinBlogger I certainly hope not! Who needs that spiteful evil ass in the oval office again?
1341856669819678720 2020-12-24 05:22:15 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump is on his way to Mar a lago? I thought his neighbors made it plain that they don't want him there. I live in Fla and don't want him here. So how is he going to punish his neighbors? I would never go somewhere where I was not wanted but then i have more respect for myself.
1341851060470689796 2020-12-24 04:59:57 +0800 <dmhossley> Lock him up!
1341828359798583306 2020-12-24 03:29:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @SpeakerPelosi Does anyone in America still think this man, and I use that term lightly, is not a traitor to our country? Pardoning murderers and thieves  for his own rewards not for the good of the country? I can't remember him doing anything for the good of the country.
1341826000389324801 2020-12-24 03:20:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @morethanmySLE @bivens_e My heart goes out to you. Last year my 15 year old Lab passed on. I didn't think I would survive the loss. She was by my side through some bad times. I had to let her know it was ok to go as she would have hung on for me in pain.I still miss her every day. It does get easier.
1341537348253847552 2020-12-23 08:13:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e You should tell desantis in fla that. He keeps saying fla is not receiving vaccines that it is suppose to. I don't believe him as he lies so much he said the same thing about tests. Ibet he and his have access to tests and the vaccine

1341393005794738184 2020-12-22 22:39:49 +0800 <dmhossley> Please pray for or think of the calif hospital workers. The stress of losing patients is bad enough but to see them die alone with no family allowed to be with them is horrendous. We all need to show them our support.
1341387759416729607 2020-12-22 22:18:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepTomColeman Good for Adam Kinzinger the only one living in reality. Asshole loser trump is still living in his delusional crazy world. Maybe Santa will give him a brain for Christmas.

1341149434512625664 2020-12-22 06:31:57 +0800 <dmhossley> Kansas City Star appologizes for years of racist coverage! Good for them better late than never. Maybe we will see others follow suit.
1341140019172536323 2020-12-22 05:54:32 +0800 <dmhossley> What is wrong with a president who wants to give our nation and it's people over to Russia? I grew up having to hide under my desk when the siren sounded because " The Russians are coming"just to watch a treasonous president give his loyalty to putin insteadof the American people
1341138263051038721 2020-12-22 05:47:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @yashar @bivens_e @netflix I intend to watch this on Netflix tonight.

They say things like " I have donated alot of money to your hospital so I should jump ahead of the line"  this is the problem with these people. They think their money makes them more valuable humans than front line workers.
1340681095516446723 2020-12-20 23:30:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast Yes. I for one will enjoy watching the traitor dragged out screaming " it's not fair"

1340063545090830342 2020-12-19 06:37:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @PNS_News Some of the fat cats in washington could afford to give up a meal and  contribute to the children. Trump could hand over his burgers to a hungry child. How do these people eat knowing that even 1 child will go to bed hungry. The greedy bastards
1340062692430757900 2020-12-19 06:33:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I will be waiting. That will be the best show on tv.

1340044812360269826 2020-12-19 05:22:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @LucyRiseUp Not surprising. The wealthy have always been cheap. I hope you walked away. Let the bastards clean it themselves
1340043633056223234 2020-12-19 05:17:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaketapper @bivens_e He's golfing. That's more important than anything

1340040214018965505 2020-12-19 05:04:18 +0800 <dmhossley> 1 in 216 Americans tested positive for covid19 this week. A very grim statistic.

1340010473828347905 2020-12-19 03:06:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Are any of these people educators?
1340010167346356224 2020-12-19 03:04:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am glad my children are all grown!
1340009891231100931 2020-12-19 03:03:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @eainaire Happy Birthday! I hope you have a wonderful day!
1339983742564233218 2020-12-19 01:19:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @ChrisDcjdrn @WhiteHouse @Mike_Pence I really do not know. I guess it really depends on the woman. You mentioned execution. Why do the same people ex. Trump. Believe in executions? Trump actually orders them but says he's against abortions. Seems like double talk to me. Killing is killing.
1339976630555557890 2020-12-19 00:51:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I learned to drive in the snow and knew how to deal with it. My problem is people in the south never having been taught how to drive in the rain!
1339972947591761920 2020-12-19 00:37:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @donwinslow For what reason?
1339972177106497536 2020-12-19 00:33:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Asshole
1339970779186941954 2020-12-19 00:28:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @duncanaitken @Classclown66 I am sorry, i am not the person to argue this issue. I have been an animal advocate since i was a little girl and another child clued me in that the meat my Mother cooked at night came from animals that were killed so we could eat them. I have remained a vegitarian since then.
1339969536662138881 2020-12-19 00:23:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @ChrisDcjdrn @WhiteHouse @Mike_Pence So we give no consideration to young women who are victims of rape by a stranger or a family member? Where is their protection? Should they have to go through life caring for a child that reminds them of such violence?
1339688215364702211 2020-12-18 05:45:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidaxelrod @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Trump probably gave putin info to help them with their cyber attack. He will do anything to get Biden as he is so jealous of him. Apparently trump is not going to deal with it leaving it for Biden to deal with.
1339607422189617154 2020-12-18 00:24:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @morgfair @bivens_e He is such a loser ASS just like trump
1339596742841397248 2020-12-17 23:42:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @marcushjohnson @bivens_e I do!
1339596449722425350 2020-12-17 23:40:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @jimsciutto @RepsForBiden Ask trump

1339595291524169729 2020-12-17 23:36:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @donwinslow There are ways to make him leave. Does trump really want a scene aired on international tv?
1339594778787233794 2020-12-17 23:34:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @ANNSISCO1 @tcspeaks Not surprising!

1339593702616920064 2020-12-17 23:30:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @SecAzar @HHSGov He sure has. Most of us don't want anything to do with trumps "culture of life"
1339593087748689923 2020-12-17 23:27:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Trump is not interested in the reports. First because he obviously can't read and second because a lot of reports have to do with putin and trump will not stand for that.
1339591822230781954 2020-12-17 23:22:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @ResisterSis20 @bivens_e I never heard Pres. Biden say defund the police. He has always maintained that we need to reform the police. With all that has gone on this past year who could deny that?
1339591136097103875 2020-12-17 23:19:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden And trump will not address it. There is only one conclusion we can come to.
1339590057703837697 2020-12-17 23:15:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @Mike_Pence I was in the 60's and am today a firm believer in a womans right to choose. Something that has been repeated to me over the years is "why is it always men who are the loudest voices against abortion?" I have no answer.
1339587958173618187 2020-12-17 23:07:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @duncanaitken @Classclown66 All the more reason we should protect them. There are people who should not exist but we protect them don't we? Even when they have hurt people and destroyed families like trump and co.

1339392447194009600 2020-12-17 10:10:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @SueSiemko @WhiteHouse @SecAzar Imagine being a parent and having to tell your child Santa won't be coming this year. The children are the ones suffering the most. They are going hungry and they are watching their parents struggling to keep a roof over their heads. Congratulations Donald Trump!

1339378765298806789 2020-12-17 09:15:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @Klartale @WhiteHouse @SecAzar He never said American people first. He wants the country not the people

The lying bastard killed a lot of people with his selfish lies. History will tell the story and trump can't lie his way out of it. Fortunately there are videos with shithead running his lying mouth

1339363704853438466 2020-12-17 08:16:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @jwharris Trump led people down this path with his lies about the virus then his making the wearing of protective masks political. He is a piece of shit traitor.
1339362957302636544 2020-12-17 08:13:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Throw trump out on his cheating lying ass. His baseless voter fraud lies are so precise because that is what trump did in 2016. The lying cheating. dictator wannabe fraudulent president.

1339360484194213890 2020-12-17 08:03:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Tell trump he's the one spreading conspiracy theories

1339300690783563783 2020-12-17 04:05:42 +0800 <dmhossley> Sorry it's wed. Dec. 16th.  What will it be on the 19th?
1339300036807680004 2020-12-17 04:03:06 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump is still trying to GET Hunter Biden as payback for Russia Probe. The facts are Hunter Biden has nothing to hide but Trump was guilty on so many levels. When everything catches up to trump he is looking at a lot of time. He will be somebody's bitch in no time
1339294816799174662 2020-12-17 03:42:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Love that cat!

1339278899415543808 2020-12-17 02:39:06 +0800 <dmhossley> Maralago neighbors to loser trump " find someplace else to live" Where you gonna go trump no one wants you around?
1339275417673494530 2020-12-17 02:25:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @PNS_News We must never forget that this is LOSER trumps legacy!

1339271285277421580 2020-12-17 02:08:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @JRubinBlogger @bivens_e So we NEVER forget what a bunker hiding LOSER is capable of. Especially all the decent hard working Americans who lost their lives because of him and all the family members and their loss. Bunker hiding, loser trump.
1339269863525801985 2020-12-17 02:03:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Is anyone surprised? I am not. The White House is so full of evil. It needs to be completely scrubbed clean of people and germs before Pres. and DOCTOR Biden move in!
1339269186103676929 2020-12-17 02:00:31 +0800 <dmhossley> You can stop any New Yorker on the streets of New York and ask them what they think of trump. After they finish laughing they will tell you what they think. New Yorkers are not known to mince words they say what they really think.
1339266821942358019 2020-12-17 01:51:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @DWUhlfelderLaw @bivens_e He should go to jail along with trump. Desantis is a traiter to our state along with our country. He has no excuse for whatt he has done

He really hopes trump is going to help him become Pres.  One of desantis's people said that is his aspiration. If that ever happens it will be the end of this country. He is destroying the state of Florida.

Take care of that love and let him know how much you love him everyday. My husband had one rule that we never go to bed angry. Whatever we would be upset about could wait for the morning. Unfortunately my husband passed away.

1338950356068409347 2020-12-16 04:53:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump I am sure trump was on the phone with putin crying why have you abandoned me after all I have done for you? Trump can invite putin to see him turn the country over to Biden but he has to send his own jet to get him not Air force one.

Joe Biden recognize the families who will have an empty seat at the family table this year due to the death of a loved one from Covid 19. Trump seemed to feel he was too good to say something to the families.

1337871551253909505 2020-12-13 05:26:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I thought trump got rid of marco rubio
1337870041757396992 2020-12-13 05:20:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden One of them is the gov. of florida ron desantis. I hope floridians remember when it is time to vote him out he has trump evil disease. I bet he thinks trump will find a way to keep him in illigally.
1337866354469318660 2020-12-13 05:06:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoJoFromJerz @bivens_e Especially when it's your own family

1337595115657957377 2020-12-12 11:08:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP What secret Supreme Court? Don't call yourself my favorite President because you are anything but that.  YOU LOST  Do you even know what courage is? You are certainly not courageous. You are a sniveling, whining fool.

1337547742835568643 2020-12-12 08:00:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @tcspeaks All of the above. He must be going in his pants right now since the Supreme Court rejected that insane lawsuit. Trump just needs to get out maybe putin will take him in and console him! But then maybe not since trump is such a loser.
1337546523698225153 2020-12-12 07:55:16 +0800 <dmhossley> The Supreme Court has upheld the will of the voters!! They rejected Texas and trump. I have hope for our democracy again. Thank you for doing the right thing!!
1337531131755958273 2020-12-12 06:54:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @lisastark351 No child in America should go hungry. A real President would make sure all children are fed. I feel sick when i see the ads for feed the children. These are children from 3rd world countries. Trump has made our country a 3rd. World country.
1337529877843599368 2020-12-12 06:49:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @ruthbenghiat That is exactly what he is doing. Like a little boy seeing how far he can push his Mom. But Mom always has the last word.

1337528143083679746 2020-12-12 06:42:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Yes he is. Never in this country's history has there been someone like trump. Nostradamus predicted a force of evil would rear his ugly head and he was right.
1337495337813106690 2020-12-12 04:31:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @ossoff @bivens_e Can a family really live on $15/hr?
1337494839563313161 2020-12-12 04:29:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @PeteButtigieg Now trump wants a firing squad added to death penalty choice. I am confused if a person claims to be pro life doesn't that mean all life?
1337493562209013762 2020-12-12 04:24:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer This is what is wrong with America, people like trump and mcconnell who are sacrificing our country for the rich
1337274510848962563 2020-12-11 13:54:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @sapphiresdust And he was one of our most respected and successful presidents.

For the first time i actually am glad my Mom is no longer here to see this. She was a nurse in WW2 and loved this country so much it would hurt her heart to see what has become of us.
1337184045717975041 2020-12-11 07:54:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What in hell has happened to our country? The world is asking the same question. Trump is not respected or trusted by our allies for very good reasons.  How can the USA convince anyone that a democracy is the best way to run a country when trump has stomped all over our democracy
1337159661716447233 2020-12-11 06:18:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDrBirx Dr. Birx. I have a question i hope you may be able to answer. I know you worked hard for Aids pts and just wonder why they could come up with a vaccine in record time for this virus afflicting the world but in all these years there has never been a vaccine for Aids or HIV?
1337156814882877443 2020-12-11 06:06:42 +0800 <dmhossley> What the hell is wrong with desantis? Instead of hanging out with trump and joining the asses that want trump to stay in the WH, desantis should be here in fla and doing what he can to protect Floridians from the virus that he seems to want to ignore.
1337154536297926659 2020-12-11 05:57:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @ThePubliusUSA Get rid of the problem.
1337153216824438786 2020-12-11 05:52:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 A President is not supposed to be idolized he is supposed to go with the will of the people and do what is best for the country.
1337152496888844293 2020-12-11 05:49:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @DNI_Ratcliffe Sounds like trump. He wants to reshape and dominate our country.
1337152127488155649 2020-12-11 05:48:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Are they going to discuss the 2016 elections? Will we ever know the truth about that? All i ever hear is it was the will of the people so why is it not the same for Biden? That also is the will of the people.
1336851850394562561 2020-12-10 09:54:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @susandtom @realDonaldTrump It's the vaccine that will protect us from the trump virus
1336851063257903105 2020-12-10 09:51:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e She asked today how much the American taxpayers are going to give her so she can have staff and an office when she leaves the WH. I really needed a good laugh today and Melania didn't disappoint  She Is lucky she is not run out of this country.
1336849250689363969 2020-12-10 09:44:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP I just had to see donald trump jr's name on this. That tells me everything. He is such an ass just like his dad.
1336799679124807681 2020-12-10 06:27:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is pence saying donald trump wants to be king of the moon?

1336778195736145927 2020-12-10 05:02:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @MidwinCharles @bivens_e I thought there was talk a few years back that Texas wanted to secede from the union?  All that oil must have gone to their brains. They don't know what they want. They are just like trump they just want attention.
1336776746582986754 2020-12-10 04:56:27 +0800 <dmhossley> Is trump going to pardon ron desantis for his crimes in Florida?
1336774408309010432 2020-12-10 04:47:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @betsybblue Dosn't his life matter?. I watched his Mother on the news and saw his life mattered to her.
1336772881745895424 2020-12-10 04:41:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e They are slow learners.
1336772340408061952 2020-12-10 04:38:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I thought to organize a successful coup you have to have intelligent, loyal people with you. I can not think of one trumper that has those qualities.
1336769706024443908 2020-12-10 04:28:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It doesn't matter anymore what good he does, he will go down in history as a foolish idiot.
1336768850952642561 2020-12-10 04:25:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden That is what a decent American would do which he has shown he is not. I wish he would shut his mouth and go sit in the bunker untill we have. President Biden in the white house who loves our country.
1336767320790880257 2020-12-10 04:18:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Crybaby trump.

1336764776911953922 2020-12-10 04:08:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @sarahcpr @bivens_e He has talked out of his ass many times.
1336764498015891463 2020-12-10 04:07:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Where did the decent and law abiding politicians go?  Is the USA going back to the Nixon days? At least the Republicans were still decent and still cared about our country. They told Nixon he needed to resign before he ruins the Republican Party.
1336762905946152965 2020-12-10 04:01:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e And so are his children. After all he taught them.
1336762685015384066 2020-12-10 04:00:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He just keeps making a fool of himself.
1336762235822157824 2020-12-10 03:58:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @sazzygram3 @tcspeaks Thank you for reminding people. I have reminded friends that Pres. Biden has a speech impediment. Then they say "oh you are right thank you for reminding me" i sincerely believe we are a compassionate nation. We do not want to act like trump making fun of people with diabilities.
1336326294288519171 2020-12-08 23:06:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @ThePubliusUSA @bivens_e Are we still living in America?
1336077976312614912 2020-12-08 06:39:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS I wonder who paid for that?

1336011737854861315 2020-12-08 02:16:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump It's the RECORD TIME that worries me.
1336001165306302465 2020-12-08 01:34:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have always believed that trump did not win in 2016. Now that he is trying to get Georgia to put pro trump people in electrical college convinces me. After all he did not win the popular vote. Trump  has tried through the courts and through threats etc.
1335998977913856005 2020-12-08 01:25:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @Raoulkitty @tcspeaks @gpbnews @CNN Could it be that she can not think for herself?
1335998216261824514 2020-12-08 01:22:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @ksandnfam @tcspeaks Ron desantis is doing trumps bidding. He has been since the start of this pandemic. He cares about what makes trump happy not what makes Floridians healthy.
1335452725551763457 2020-12-06 13:15:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You lose!!    Loser and Sucker!!!!!!
1335317978640953345 2020-12-06 04:19:49 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump made wearing a mask a political thing.Pres Biden presents it as a patriotic thing. I like the idea of Patriotic much more than political.
1335315627037372417 2020-12-06 04:10:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @tedcruz @marcorubio @NikkiHaley Is trump attempting to pull off a  coup in America? What in hell is he doing telling the Governor of Ga. he needs his help to overturn Biden's win in Ga.
1334939787061583885 2020-12-05 03:17:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @paulwaldman1 @bivens_e I think God has more important thing to do.
1334892434115981318 2020-12-05 00:08:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing You reminded me of getting the polio vaccine. No one asked me if i wanted it. My Mother was so terrified of polio that she dragged us for the vaccine as soon as it was available. We never hear of kids getting polio today maybe the covid vaccine will do the same.
1333545233154531329 2020-12-01 06:55:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @tonyw1061 @therecount @RepsForBiden I am not sure what the connection is between the destruction of property and wearing masks but most of that havoc was the work of extreme right winged groups like proud boys, boogaloo bois and white supremist. groups.
1333542462745415683 2020-12-01 06:44:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan I agree. It will also be so nice to hear from Pres. Biden instead of big mouth trump. I think it's going to be difficult to shut trump up.
1333541835881508869 2020-12-01 06:42:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich Can we dump trump now?
1333541418531508225 2020-12-01 06:40:24 +0800 <dmhossley> Gov. Desantis has proven again today that he does not care about the health of Floridians. If He keeps doing what trump tells him to he will end up like trump
1332852864524414977 2020-11-29 09:04:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @KFILE I am so sorry. I can't think of anything worse than to watch your child suffer. I will pray for her!
1332851622255452160 2020-11-29 08:59:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @tirghrathoir @bivens_e Too bad for him. He can stay the hell off twitter if the truth bothers him. Better yet he can go in the bunker.
1332850466510807040 2020-11-29 08:54:49 +0800 <dmhossley> the Mayor of Mami talked about how bad things are in Fla. It seems our Govenor is missing again. Cases of the virus are rising deaths are rising and not a word from desantis. I am not at all surprised. Desantis has done nothing for the people of Fla.he is a fraud like trump
1332780913508438019 2020-11-29 04:18:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillyBaldwin @bivens_e So you are admitting that you are in the white house because of your fraudulently or illegally obtained votes?

1332777036843257857 2020-11-29 04:03:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Where DID he get the 3 million? Somehow i think the taxpayers have paid it.
1332776109658796035 2020-11-29 03:59:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @AprilDRyan @bivens_e It probably went into trumps private acct.

1332773755190439943 2020-11-29 03:49:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @therecount @RepsForBiden I have found it goes beyond their rights. When people say "oh you must be one of those Biden people who insist we all wear masks" no i do not consider wearing a mast political. I don't call people who argue against masks trumpers. I do believe in science.
1332431336406134784 2020-11-28 05:09:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom When he acts Presidential he will be given that respect. Since before he won the election he has acted like an uneducated ass and still to this day that is the way he acts. A groan man doesn't act like trump.

1331000432974499840 2020-11-24 06:23:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @MorriseyWV @WhiteHouse Has anyone checked to see if there is an owl hiding in the tree?
1330999554293063681 2020-11-24 06:19:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse We all heard how you hated Christmas. You exact words were F**k Christmas. Did you realize how inappropriate that was? Well then now you can try to rescue OUR country by convincing donald to give up the ghost. He lost. As a woman i am sure you kno how to get through to him.
1330998686634151949 2020-11-24 06:16:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep Poor trump soon he has to give up flying all over in Air Force One. America will save a lot of money as I was told it cost 85,000 per flight mile to run. I thought trump had his own jet whats wrong with that? Too expensive to run?
1330968082135781379 2020-11-24 04:14:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @cosmeticallyme @bivens_e Happy Birthday! I hope you have a grreat day!!!#
1330893269862141952 2020-11-23 23:17:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d I still believe trump is a wannabe dictator. He just can't seem to pull it off even with putins help.
1330892616255348739 2020-11-23 23:15:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @Bill_Maxwell_ Desantis does not care what happens to Floridians. He does nothing to protect the people. He seems to only be concerned with himself and what DonaldTrump wants. Gov. Cuomo on the other hand tries to protect NY. Trump has done all he can to tie Gov. Cuomo's  hands.
1330891525761490945 2020-11-23 23:10:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep If it is not, it should be. Americans have a lot of questions about our electorial system since the evil unamerican donald trump came along.
1330890953746427907 2020-11-23 23:08:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you I have been thinking the same thing after don jr posted his silly post. I hope don jr. Does not have any political aspirations because there is a record of all his nonsense.
1330617560098856962 2020-11-23 05:02:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidEggert00 Thats a lie.
1330617374656131077 2020-11-23 05:01:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @AlexandraHemmin @bivens_e Looks like trump was coming off a bender.
1330617162353025024 2020-11-23 05:00:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Trump is responsible for the food insecurity in this country. What is wrong with him? He only wants the protections and perks of being president. I can not remember a time in my life that there was so much hunger in this country.l. Send the money they took back to the people.
1330322055322083333 2020-11-22 09:27:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep One thing we have all come to understand is that the people who have been put in a position to protect us are ass kissers. DC is full of ass kissers
1330320945320439809 2020-11-22 09:23:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @bivens_e Florida is really in trouble. The mayors are calling on desantis to do something like make a mask mandate. I just laughed desantis does not do anything without trumps ok and to put out a mandate would be admitting we have a problem.
1330319499933999107 2020-11-22 09:17:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @bivens_e What in hell world are you living in donald trump?  Go to a hospital and watch the devastation not only the patients but the nurses and doctors. You were in a country club where everyone waited on you and you received meds.that no one else can have. Stop lying to Americans.
1330317822292090882 2020-11-22 09:10:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Have you seen the long lines all over this country for food. This is happening on your watch trump and by the way you don't look like you have missed a meal in a long tim maybe you should and donate the food to a pantry. It will do you good health wise.
1330316025913618433 2020-11-22 09:03:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @bivens_e Trump needs to go back to his golf course as he has nothing intelligent to say.
1330313726092828672 2020-11-22 08:54:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @JeffFlake @RepsForBiden Just when you think trump can't be any more crazy.
1330313325549408256 2020-11-22 08:53:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @Out5p0ken REAL busy playing golf. He is supposed to be the leader of the free world and the country is torn apart I am thinking back to a time when trump made nasty remarks about Obama playing golf. But Obama did not have the shit show that trump has going on.
1329516730234925060 2020-11-20 04:07:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I wonder if there were another vote how many trump supporters would be left after this trumpshitshow.
1329514593723543552 2020-11-20 03:59:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Out5p0ken @bivens_e @TwitterSafety Giuliani should be on the list of culprits that should go to jail for crimes against our country.
1329513699749613574 2020-11-20 03:55:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @Leslieoo7 Our forefathers did their best to protect the American people from someone coming into power who would damage the people or our country. They just could not imagine a trump trying to destroy our country. Too bad.
1329512856639983622 2020-11-20 03:52:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @Eleven_Films @tcspeaks @benFranklin2018 What a sick sob.
1329512149333516288 2020-11-20 03:49:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @DorisMoffet @tcspeaks Trump will go down in history as a total f**k up President who doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself. He deserves every harsh word said and written about him..
1329209166410502146 2020-11-19 07:45:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @onesinglethread @tcspeaks For some people there is never enough money so they cheat to get more.
1329207812342288387 2020-11-19 07:40:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @PNS_News Trump is a selfish, self centered, ignorant Ass.
1329205592804773889 2020-11-19 07:31:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @jimsciutto @RepsForBiden Too bad trump has no idea the right thing to do is. He only knows the selfish things to do for himself no matter how much it hurts the country. He has had his baby hissy fits and EVERYONE knows how he feels it is now time to concede and let us get on with dealing with the virus
1329154191273684996 2020-11-19 04:07:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Think they have done irreparable damage to the party. I just saw an ad that asked for donations for the Republican Senate race. Why didn't trump give his left over campaign funds into that campaign instead of his private account?
1328837205503201282 2020-11-18 07:07:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaymichael19811 @neal_katyal @SykesCharlie It is a shame remembering Rudy on 9/11 and the fool he is now.
1328836439707152384 2020-11-18 07:04:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @ElocinEnnis @neal_katyal Never. I don't how he passed the bar exam.
1328808940784717826 2020-11-18 05:15:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 Please keep him out of Fla Who knows what damage he will do. The Gov  Desantis is very easily led. One of the. reasonsI left NY was because of the team of trump and guiliani
1328807953273655297 2020-11-18 05:11:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP What happened to the campaign money trump put in his personal acct? Wasn't that illigal?
1328807470756720645 2020-11-18 05:09:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @JohnnyGWeir @Nelly_Mo @DancingABC Thats whats missing in America today. Thank you for reminding us what Americans are all about. I always believed we are a kinder and gentler society.
1328806255209668611 2020-11-18 05:04:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The rest of the world are so happy to not have to deal with the nasty, name calling inept asshole trump. They know President Biden and have dealt with him before. They know he is not an egocentric nut case like trump.
1328805194235326471 2020-11-18 05:00:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @BillKristol Exactly!!!
1328804979700883458 2020-11-18 04:59:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e History will not treat trump kindly. But he dosn't care since he doesn't read but his sons do and his grand children probably will. What will they say to trump?
1328781119978954758 2020-11-18 03:24:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindsaywise @bivens_e @WSJ Where are people learning these behaviors? From the top. Trump has to own all the division in this country.
1328778386525868033 2020-11-18 03:13:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @nytpolitics @bivens_e Trump is going to punish the voters and Pres. Elect Biden by getting us in a war. Tell me again what has trump done for America?
1328777242625839104 2020-11-18 03:09:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @FrankLuntz @RepsForBiden The people have spoken and said they want a different President  All he has accomplished is to make people not trust our election system. It was a wonderful thing  that so many came out to vote now with all this trump crap they are saying. "Why vote"
1328775297588752385 2020-11-18 03:01:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @FrankLuntz @RepsForBiden This should never happen in America. So what did Trump do for us? He denied a pandamic existed causing so many innocent people to die. Refused to help Americans who are in financial trouble causing long food lines. Now wants to risk our lives by getting into a war.
1328462878786121730 2020-11-17 06:20:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e And he moved donated campaign funds into his personal account. We would hear the screaming lock him up for decades if President Biden did that.
1328461268492177408 2020-11-17 06:13:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan It didn't happen.
1328460930926206976 2020-11-17 06:12:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I doubt it.
1328459668520361987 2020-11-17 06:07:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @joehagansays @realDonaldTrump All I can think of when i think of trump is:  Jim Jones
1328459325761794052 2020-11-17 06:05:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse That is because trump dangled money in front of them. Our money by the way
1328458737955246080 2020-11-17 06:03:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @wxyzdetroit Tump does hold grudges doesn't he?
1328458133602177025 2020-11-17 06:01:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @Strandjunker Yes I do. He is a thief, a liar and a selfish POS
1328456991786852352 2020-11-17 05:56:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @tcspeaks Those macho trump boys. I have seen more than one picture of them proudly showing off their kill. They are the lowest of humanity
1328448494374416384 2020-11-17 05:22:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump only cares about trump. He doesn't even care what his actions are doing to his family.
1328447860015321090 2020-11-17 05:20:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @MCmuckraker @MayorMikeDuggan All i can say is to parrot President Elect Bidens comment. "What the hell is wrong with these people."
1328446216368164865 2020-11-17 05:13:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden That is your fantasy. We all know better.
1328445887996162049 2020-11-17 05:12:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Are the trumps still trying to make this video something bad?
1328445070559879168 2020-11-17 05:09:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @ericalvino @bivens_e I thought that was illegal, but then when has trump cared about legal or illegal or right from wrong?

1328132781294186501 2020-11-16 08:28:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @mspmetrodet Just sickening.. I wish we could hunt the hunters
1328132248172974080 2020-11-16 08:26:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @YaBoiTedCruise @RepsForBiden Looks like he took too many drugs again.. Why they don't help him and put him in rehab. I don't understand.
1328131783574040576 2020-11-16 08:24:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It is time for you to leave, donny.
1328131333898592256 2020-11-16 08:22:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden president Biden WON accept it!
1328131079841210368 2020-11-16 08:21:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @santiagomayer_ I am not surprised by any Anti American crap he does because he is a traitor.

1328130015557541890 2020-11-16 08:17:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch This is just what trump wants. How could he care about this country and encourage this.
1328129635884863490 2020-11-16 08:15:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What a loser.
1328129399556812800 2020-11-16 08:14:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaketapper @RepsForBiden This is nonsense from a sore loser. I can not believe this loser ran this country at all.
1327773674326405122 2020-11-15 08:41:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Thete is. Nothing like the love of a dog
1327750644854386689 2020-11-15 07:09:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e If America is attacked by a foreign power that will be on trump and his childish behavior We are very vulnerable now and as long as trump keeps up his crazyness Of course the Proud Bpys were demomstrating today not Amtifa.

1326570540409245708 2020-11-12 01:00:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Dr. Biden would not be able to understand Melania anyway.
1326553286913056768 2020-11-11 23:52:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepMikeRogers @bivens_e @JoeBiden Particularly since Donald trump ignores them. Someone should know what is going on.
1326552856598491136 2020-11-11 23:50:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @tcspeaks The President, donald trump, is the whiney bitch. He' been whining since day one.
1326551660647247878 2020-11-11 23:45:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @tcspeaks My Mom always told me "show me your Friends and I will. Tell you who you are" I have tried to live by that rule. I have been very picky about who I invite into my life. I can only vote against the President, which I did. Never would such a selfish, liar and cheater be in my life.
1326549347991838721 2020-11-11 23:36:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Thank you!!  I have been disgusted with Rep. Party since they allowed. Trump to do whatever he wanted. When he claimed he could do whatever he wanted because he is Pres. Why are the Prebs so afraid of him? Why is he allowed to have such a close relationship with Putin?
1326273222292156417 2020-11-11 05:19:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Did he really think he was funny? What an idiot. This is serious Asshole.
1326272528915042304 2020-11-11 05:16:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @USMC Who the hell raised trump? A grown man acting like a spoiled little brat.
1326272266435489793 2020-11-11 05:15:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @USMC Trump is such a baby. He is acting like a 5yr old. I don't have a 5yr old but i raised 3 boy who were 5yrs old at one time and i would never put up with trumps crap. I am always told that my boys are nice and respectful. I was a strict mom. They always said please and thank you.
1326234442726330368 2020-11-11 02:45:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @PalmerReport @bivens_e You can say the same about Barr They should all go to jail.
1326233809277382658 2020-11-11 02:42:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The Republican party has become so much like trump. It is not the party i belonged to. It needs to be abolished. There is nothing good about the party anymore. The republicans can thank trump for all his bull shit and themselves for encouraging him.
1326229213708480516 2020-11-11 02:24:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I still dont want a vaccine that trumphad anything to do with. He knows the people getting the vaccine did not die of covid. I think he wants to kill us all
1326228527482630145 2020-11-11 02:21:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It would have been a good day to concede to Joe Biden I dont expect trump to invite Biden to the White House. My fear is he is trying to destroy our demockracy so he can take over. He said many times that he deserved more than 8 yrs
1326206840884125697 2020-11-11 00:55:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @maggieNYT @bivens_e Trump still has his hopes on being a dictator.   Wannabe dictator
1326206266390274048 2020-11-11 00:53:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Trump and his whole klan should get out of DC.

1326137524566323201 2020-11-10 20:19:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @mkraju @bivens_e Please dont encourage him. I want to be rid of the liar and cheater. He is the one cheating not Biden Trump has asked foreign countries to help him get elected.
1326136725899456513 2020-11-10 20:16:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden is my choice for PresidentI am not any of these people you accuse of voting for him. I am a suburban woman and am sick of your lies and trying to destroy our country. Go to Russia if you dont like America
1326135631932764160 2020-11-10 20:12:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Stop blaming Antifa for everything you are just amusing these people Instead blame the far right groups that you know and talk to.
1326134988597833730 2020-11-10 20:09:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump needs to stop acting like a big baby and welcome Pres  Biden. The people have spoken. Do what is good for our country.
1325863158804865027 2020-11-10 02:09:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @navyvetDC @RepsForBiden I was so disgusted when I offered a mask to a woman in a store. She said "i have my rights not to wear a mask if i don't want to"  i told her but you don't have a right to kill me.

1325616830141132802 2020-11-09 09:50:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @Donna3m1 @CrystalChild59 @TTasticDesigns @DailyCaller You mean fake fox news? What did Biden say about us putting our differences aside and not fight with each other. The only ones looking for a fight are trumpers. They are very combative people  I have been watching what they say to people here on twitter.
1325614983758098432 2020-11-09 09:43:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e They are too smart to do the stupid shit that trump does.
1325614740207493122 2020-11-09 09:42:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @morgfair @bivens_e @thedailybeast Did any of them vote? Trump wants theirvotes invalidated.
1325614202027913217 2020-11-09 09:40:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @KwikWarren And don't any of you steal the silverware when you leave. I really would like the housekeepers to see. That the trumps leave everything thereAnd as an American I would appreciate the trumps put the portraits back where they belong. Trump had some nerve taking them down
1325611981844443136 2020-11-09 09:31:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Does he feel anything about the fact that a lot of people could not vote because they died of covid. He is such an ass that he would make such accusations.
1325611298974019585 2020-11-09 09:28:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump He would have to care about them to do that. Trump is the only one important to trump.his kids seem to always be looking fir his approval.
1325591879887548416 2020-11-09 08:11:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Just the opposite he owes the American people. He has been running amuck spending tax payers money. I questioned what it was costing us to fly all over in air force one and was answered my someone in the military. It is costing us $80,000 per flight mile. Where is the trump jet?
1325590910097383424 2020-11-09 08:07:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Did they even want to?? Trump seems to be doing a good job of making an ASS of himself
1325590362455494659 2020-11-09 08:05:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @svdate @RepsForBiden The people have spoken and you refuse to accept it. You have been bound and determined to destroy our democracy.l You did what you wanted and the American people have let you but we have spoken and you need to concede now!!!  Myself and everyone i know voted you out.
1325545338996920322 2020-11-09 05:06:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @ABC Very sad news. He put up a good fight. We are losing too many people to this disease.

I can't wait for jan 20 when they kick his and his klans asses out of the White House.  Donald Trump can accept it or not. It is not good for our country

1324499738109091848 2020-11-06 07:52:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump is a loser
1324488288233787399 2020-11-06 07:06:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @oliverdarcy @bivens_e The people have spoken trump. Go away. We are done with you just GO AWAY
1324487916467462144 2020-11-06 07:05:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @justinamash @RepsForBiden You are an unpatriotic jackass!!!!!
1324478611123019778 2020-11-06 06:28:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @FLOTUS . Lets see what did she accomplish in the white house? Shevput those hidious gold drapes up. She tore up Jackies Rose Garden , she decorated the white house hidiously last xhristmas. Who wants to take bets that the place is going to be left a mess by the trump klan?
1324477191598559232 2020-11-06 06:22:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @PNS_News Trump does'nt give a damn about the environment. Just more trump destruction. I hate donald trump
1324476768376508419 2020-11-06 06:20:43 +0800 <dmhossley> VPJoe Biden is a true patriot. I pray he becomes our next President. Then I think Joe is such a good and faithful man, he doesn't deserve all this crap trump has left for him. The rhing is Joe has very good people around him to help.
1324457948597288960 2020-11-06 05:05:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Will he still be around in 2024? I would think he would be in jail or have run to russia as he is run out of usa.
1324456111097995265 2020-11-06 04:58:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @dvgvintage @RepsForBiden Much more than he ever did. How many of the Americans had the health care trump had when they got covid and died.? No one i know. And the ones i knew died alone wirh a strange nurse trying to comfort them. I wish that nightmare on trump minus the kind nurse.
1324454976480022533 2020-11-06 04:54:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @MariePe27763767 @RepsForBiden @MickMulvaney What does trump think he is? A loser or sucker?
1324453859557781504 2020-11-06 04:49:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Why would he do that? Do Americans have anything else he can take from us? He took our lives with the virus now he is destroying a priviledge we have as voters. He can go to hell.
1324452816765833216 2020-11-06 04:45:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump . I cry for the ones i have known who have passed. My heart has been broken over and over but trump does not care.I don't understand a president acting like him he just cares about him. Biden has met with professionals on the virus today. That is what a caring president does
1324411125883195392 2020-11-06 01:59:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Why can' i stop trump from emailing me about his being robbed of the election. Is this what he did to Hillery?
1324410279040528390 2020-11-06 01:56:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Trump keeps emailing me about how the election is being stolen from him
1324402078991720448 2020-11-06 01:23:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump On the resolute desk?  As of today and all the shit trump is doing i officially hate him. He is trying to take over our democracy and destroy it. Better men than him have tried it before. Don' t count the American people out!!!!!!!!!!
1324397011009982464 2020-11-06 01:03:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Get ready to move trump. Democracy WILL win despite you. From a trump hater i became that today after watching what you are doing to our country. Get OUT

1324395049568870400 2020-11-06 00:56:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Why is twitter blocking me from replying to anyone i did not call him a traitor in a long time that was when twitter blocked me before.
1324357447713280001 2020-11-05 22:26:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden America has been held up in europe as a display of how democracy works. Not this morn. Putin is laughing his ass off

1323681535028060161 2020-11-04 01:40:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is trump trying to be funny? Well there is nothing funny about this BS.
1323680398421929984 2020-11-04 01:36:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump But trump still wont face putin down about our soldiers.
1323679863723724801 2020-11-04 01:34:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump They promised to uphold trumps law. trump must think Americans are all stupid. We didn't miss what he did with USPS that he is now reaping the reward for with ballots missing and showing up late. Really do we have to talk about what he did with the Supreme Court? Trump cheats
1323678453535834117 2020-11-04 01:28:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 @grandmagrit That is why he put DeJoy in charge of the USPS. there was no other reason the man has no qualifications to run the post office. Now dejoy is paying. trump back for the chushy job. Wait until kavenaugh and barrett pay him back for their cushy jobs.
1323676469130891264 2020-11-04 01:20:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What about confronting putin about the bounty put our soldiers. No that you wont do because you think our soldiers are losers and suckers. You are a poor excuse of a human being and certainly not fit to be leader of this great country.
1323654682426880001 2020-11-03 23:54:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Where is you health insurance policy.

1323651547272806401 2020-11-03 23:41:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It's 5 o'clock somewhere.
1323649648326791168 2020-11-03 23:34:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @JosephNSanberg @bivens_e @JoeBiden I watched a washington fat cat say the minimum wage is enough to live on it doesn't have to be raised. I assure you that man has not missed any meals and knows nothing about budgeting.
1323646635860250629 2020-11-03 23:22:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @danarubinstein @bivens_e It's not about what you see it is about what trump has threatened.  He has his far right wing groups ready for the word from him. They are the ones who infiltrated peaceful protests.
1323645773955948552 2020-11-03 23:18:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Total trump lies. Ask a veteran.
1323644869445910529 2020-11-03 23:15:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @bivens_e Of course he is.

1323643254609448962 2020-11-03 23:08:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @LetHimGoMovie Just one more thing we have lost because of the trump virus. I loved going to the movies.  I have since learned to wait until the movie came on demand. It is not bad since you don't have to miss part of the movie for a bathroom break or can get food whenever you want.
1323642111087071235 2020-11-03 23:04:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I watch a piece on past presidential candidates and how they conceded to the president  elect. Not one said "their supporters will be violent if they lost" everyone back to Nixon were elegant and decent in their speech. Not one acted like BABY TRUMP throwing a hissey fit.
1323640606866944001 2020-11-03 22:58:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @AlexandraChalup @bivens_e This is right up trumps alley  Maybe was the inspiration behind his attempt to turn this country fascist. That is why he goes after Antifa so much. These people are against fascism and racism.
1323626796089331712 2020-11-03 22:03:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Peg33 @ladygaga @JoeBiden Bar needs to join trump. He is the brains behind trumps crazyness. Not far behind should be McConnell. They are all the epitome of FAT CATS in washngton.
1323614510285000704 2020-11-03 21:14:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @NHJennifer @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden I could not believe the trumpers were outside VP Bidens church protesting. Whats wrong with trump supporters? There is no spirituality in these people. They are, like trump, wannabe thugs. He is also a wannabe dictator.
1323594818128412675 2020-11-03 19:56:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @ladygaga @tcspeaks @realDonaldTrump Loved watching Lady Gaga last night. She and others are what makes America great. The love for our country is so apparent. Thank you!!!!!
1323593587909681153 2020-11-03 19:51:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @BarackObama Trump doesn't have the intelligence to look at anything you left to help him. He is like a jealous woman, he threw it away.
1323593009187954690 2020-11-03 19:48:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsallprettybad @tcspeaks Let them know you abhor anyone calling them losers or suckers.
1323591983642910720 2020-11-03 19:44:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @JustVent6 @tcspeaks @gtconway3d He also spent huge amount of taxpayer money on himself and his klan. I saw that jus  jetting around all over this country campaigning has cost taxpayers $80,000 per fight hour. Why doesn't his campaign pay for that? Trump takes all he can get.
1323590554253434880 2020-11-03 19:39:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Personally I have never taken anything that did not belong to me and i never tried to intimidate anyone to believe in what i do. Not religion or politics. A person who has to resort to these tactics should not be voted in office again.  It is not who we are as a nation.
1323588530317283328 2020-11-03 19:31:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You forgot to list voter intimidation and covid19.l I never even imagined that day would come that a man was so desperate to win an election that he would contact the worst in our society to go on election day to the polls and threaten people to vote for donald trump. Deplorable
1323586015202844672 2020-11-03 19:21:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Another new experience for election day. My local news has been putting up a phone # that they suggest we put in our phone. It is anticipated that supporters of a certain candidate may try to intimidate and threaten people going to vote. Please be safe everyone.
1323453858144768002 2020-11-03 10:36:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden This is trump inciting violence.
1323451271660163072 2020-11-03 10:25:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Does that include the workers that trump employed in New York that he never paid?
1323449596979384320 2020-11-03 10:19:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This is such bullshit. I help giving Americans box's of food because they are in such economic trouble. Without this food their children will go hungry. Have you  gone in the streets and talk to these people? No because they are beneath you. You put these people in this position.
1323447920520269824 2020-11-03 10:12:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @chrislhayes @bivens_e Thats why lawyers are not trusted.
1323447605469290496 2020-11-03 10:11:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are such a lying ass. Why did we (the taxpayers) have to pay for another fence around the white house? Where did the other go? Did you take it for mar a lago? By the way when you get scared go to the bunker like you did the last time. I think you owe the American people $$$$$
1323439297186435074 2020-11-03 09:38:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Does that mean if women don't have mammograms there will be no breast cancer. Why hasn't someone thought of that before? Good going stable genius

1323435367719198720 2020-11-03 09:22:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden It will be an economy for the people not the super rich.
1323419202074611712 2020-11-03 08:18:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse wow is trump really disconnected with the american people. The people he hangs out with in his country clubs are doing very well. And by the way the people have paid for that country club.
1323416956112953344 2020-11-03 08:09:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You have that backwards. trump terrorists win peace loses.
1323416402825519104 2020-11-03 08:07:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @sparkette123 @bivens_e @kylegriffin1 @Rachel_McRea I did the same. I am a New York/Florida girl. Once trump is gone I am going to campaign to get rid of that useless desantis. He and trump can party with their QAnon friends.
1323414551946317824 2020-11-03 07:59:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump lies. Does trump know how much the women of this country hate him? We are all voting him out no longer are we going to stand for his killing our loved ones. Destroying our decent and kind country. It will be so nice to have normalcy again not that crazy rhetoric.
1323411996608499713 2020-11-03 07:49:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @kpmnbhgft @bivens_e @ShironRedshift @kylegriffin1 @JoeBiden trump says it's a hoax and is putting in place more destruction.
1323411483489959939 2020-11-03 07:47:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden It is long overdue. He has destroyed so much he can not be allowed to destroy anymore.
1323411063732404224 2020-11-03 07:46:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @FrankenforIowa @tcspeaks the American people are a decent and generous people. trump doesn't want to lose our generosity. I think there should be an accounting of what we have paid for since trump took office. I bet we would all be surprised and dismayed of how much he has stolen from us.
1323409885988610048 2020-11-03 07:41:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump trump is a liar.
1323409567590588423 2020-11-03 07:40:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump lies. He has only taken care of himself and his klan. What he gave the American is a pandemic out of control because he did not do what need to be done in the beginning. He admitted it on tape. He has never read American history and learned about the American people.
1323408489264414721 2020-11-03 07:35:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump lies.
1323408263363387393 2020-11-03 07:34:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump is only interested in deals with dictators. He told dr. atlas to talk with RT.  trump is going to find out what the American people are made of.

1323331392856608771 2020-11-03 02:29:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh you could not be more wrong trump. You waged a war on American citizens with the virus. You are winning that war so far with 231,000 dead Americans. And approx 100,000 new cases every day while you lie to people saying the virus has gone. But we will stop you from killing us.

1323326987973332995 2020-11-03 02:11:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Another trump lie. Just like you saying to people the virus has gone around the corner while an average of 100,000 new cases a day. I watch an amazing sight today. People were lined up to vote and not far away there were people lined up for a covid test. You bastard!!!
1323325897357885445 2020-11-03 02:07:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Why are we paying for another fence to protect you from your far right people. Damn it you have the bunker what do we have to protect ourselves from your goons with long guns.
1323325192660275201 2020-11-03 02:04:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 Women better step up and vote this asshole out. He is determined to kill as many American as he can. Why does trump get to put a non scalable fence around the white house we pay for that but can't protect ourselves from his far right winged groups. He has a damned bunker!!!

He is totally useless to Floridians. We understand he is not very bright, but taking directions from trump is just plain stupid.

1323249184607293445 2020-11-02 21:02:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @NASA @NASAKennedy How does trump keep up with his lies? He doesn't he just goes on with a new one.
1323248711808524288 2020-11-02 21:00:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Oh yeah. trump cares for these people.
1323238912278646785 2020-11-02 20:21:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I stand with Dr. Fauci.
1323238663807971328 2020-11-02 20:20:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Gov Kasich is a true PATRIOT. Not the ignorant goons with their pick up trucks that trump told the crowd last night were real patriots.
1323237795591278594 2020-11-02 20:17:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump All you want to do is destroy Florida excluding MarALago of course. The protection for our beautiful Florida Panthers gone. The protection for our beaches gone And so much more. I won't be too affected but my children and Grandchildren will. When VP Biden takes office he will it
1323233949917847552 2020-11-02 20:02:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e trump keeps up with his lies about Antifa. Whatever, even if he were right thats 1 far left group. The far right groups, Proud Boys, white supremacists, kkk and Boogaloo Bois are doing all the damage to our country. trump tells them to stand back and stand down.WHAT? Explain that
1323082360947154944 2020-11-02 09:59:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZackCz @RepsForBiden I did and mine was received and counted on Oct. 19th in Fla.
1323080637297950720 2020-11-02 09:53:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden That is the way it has always been. trump is just trying to divide our country again. It is almost as if he is working for putin.
1323080002896863232 2020-11-02 09:50:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @FPWellman @RepsForBiden The FBI has investigated Antifa because of your accusations and found no violence. They have found the violence is from your far right wing groups like Proud Boys. White supremacists, kkk and Boogaloo Bois. So just keep lying your credibility is at stake. And call off your dogs.
1323078748145651722 2020-11-02 09:45:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You call this garbage patriots? Patriots from where russia? American patriots do not act like the lowlifes you attract. The FBI has said over and over Antifa has not been involved in any violence. It is the far right wing groups that you condone that do all the violence
1323069997950898177 2020-11-02 09:10:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Liar
1323069410148524032 2020-11-02 09:08:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 @RepsForBiden I have been through many elections in my lifetime and have never witnessed anything like this. But then we have never had an insane communist loving ass like trump before. The more he runs his mouth the more he reminds me of hitler.
1323068344963158016 2020-11-02 09:04:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @Lucyaldrich @RepsForBiden You are not alone. For me i think i am defending the country i love from an evil, hateful man who is bound and determined to destroy it.
1323067232260444162 2020-11-02 08:59:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @RepsForBiden This is the biggest thing that has happened in their little lives.
1323066665727193088 2020-11-02 08:57:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Another trump lie. trump has not done anything for the American people.What he is doing now is so ignorant. He is soiling the office of the presidency and the republican party. What i don't understand is the party defending him when he is doing all he can to destroy it.
1323046369658109952 2020-11-02 07:36:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @StandUpRepublic @RepsForBiden That's why he is called a wannabe dictator.  The stable genius is not smart enough to be a dictator anymore than he is smart enough to be president.
1323043942103920641 2020-11-02 07:27:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @danpfeiffer @bivens_e Now you can see one of the reasons trump hates Pres. Obama he's so jealous of him. The most trump can handle as a sport is to play golf. And i think as obese as he has gotten even that is pretty hard on him Stop the burgers and cokes trump.
1323042416019070976 2020-11-02 07:21:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @Out5p0ken @bivens_e He posted it on twitter yesterday right after it happened with the caption "I love texas" what a sick SOB I know quite a few men who have told me they would like five minutes alone with him. I tell them it wouldn't happen. He'd run crying like a bitch and then try to sue them.
1323039353040478208 2020-11-02 07:08:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump can not tell the truth if he wanted to.He lied to his parents then lied to his wives, he lied to his customers and his employees. He has run the White House in our country on lies. If anyone told him he should not betray the American people with his lies they were fired
1323023860934053888 2020-11-02 06:07:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 This is trumps way threaten and cheat and lie. I hope the FBI puts every one of those trumpers who interfered with the Biden bus in Texas in jail. That is not how we do things in this country, thats putins way. Go to russia trump!
1323022870533066753 2020-11-02 06:03:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He's right. VP Biden wants us all to live and be healthy. trump is trying to kill us. Look what he does at his rallys. I thank God I do not know anyone who would go to one. I always wear a mask when i have to go out because i could be on line in a store with a super spreader.
1323021776381714433 2020-11-02 05:59:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He can claim victory all he wants. He still will have to leave the White House on Jan 20, 2021. He can kick and scream like a baby but he's still going. I suggest he start looking for plane tickets for russia because he will no longer have Air Force One to use.
1323020156860289025 2020-11-02 05:52:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden This man is totally insane. He does not care how much he hurts this country.
1323019196897394688 2020-11-02 05:48:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump please stop coming to Florida. You are spreading the virus to very vulnerable people and you do not have the right to do that. Just do something right for once.
1323014932049334283 2020-11-02 05:31:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @SWAtlasHoover If atlas really wants to do something constructive he should x-ray trumps brain because there is seriously something wrong. Just watch him.
1323012065779458048 2020-11-02 05:20:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump This man makes me sick. He had this speech all ready in case he got caught. Well idiot you got got. Please don't call yourself a Dr. Its insulting to the wonderful caring Drs we have in the country. Especially Dr. Fauci. He is a genius and cares about this country.
1323010947645136896 2020-11-02 05:16:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer I love New York.
1323010693696786432 2020-11-02 05:15:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Liar trump
1323010286920572928 2020-11-02 05:13:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I did too to save our wonderful FREE country.
1323009747331751941 2020-11-02 05:11:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Another trump lie. Fact check it!
1323009514078113794 2020-11-02 05:10:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden trump doesn't even care. He hates the American people and is doing all he can to destroy us and our decent loving country. He wants to hand the ones that survive the virus over to Putin
1323008672042274819 2020-11-02 05:07:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump People really need to fact check this lying evil thing. He cares for nothing but himself and will lie lie lie
1323008189210759171 2020-11-02 05:05:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden We can't deny it. We have to something NOW or our children and grandchildren will suffer.
1323007830878752780 2020-11-02 05:03:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump If this is true why am i still helping to give boxes of food to families? They say they never thought this would happen to them in America. They overwhelmingly blame trump the liar.
1323006922942013444 2020-11-02 05:00:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe So precious!!!
1323006563297206274 2020-11-02 04:58:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP You are lying for trump and should have your medical licence revoked. You should not be around patients even though you just take pictures you can still cause harm. Everyone should contact the AMA and complain about this dangerous man.
1323005427668426757 2020-11-02 04:54:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP He has already stained our country. And what's with this BS that this radiologist talking with the russians? What has he told them? Does anyone doubt trumps alliance with the Russians?  Trump destroyed the relationships we that had with our allies.
1323004410906238979 2020-11-02 04:50:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden An asshole idiot.
1323004260167110663 2020-11-02 04:49:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Lies
1323004146753167361 2020-11-02 04:49:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Yes. He really needs to be tamed. He is says his supporters who surrounded the Biden bus in texas were simply making sure the Biden bus was safe? The Biden volunteer who's suv was smashed by the trump black truck will have something else to say. The FBI are looking into the case.
1322945897160941570 2020-11-02 00:57:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump For a second day in a row trump is thanking the very people he called thieves.
1322944966776205315 2020-11-02 00:53:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden These people have no respect for themselves or for anyone else.
1322936388078182402 2020-11-02 00:19:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump is not at all confident that he can win. Instead of petting a dog he incites violence. I am  happy he hates dogs because i would fear for a dog around him. I believe he is a kick the dog kind of person. Instead he surrounds himself with human sheep who will do his bidding.
1322934238056992770 2020-11-02 00:11:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I feel so sorry for trump. He is losing out on one of the strongest, loyal, and loving relationships that exist. My dogs have gotten me through terrible pain when i lost loved ones and they never judged me. trump can't understand such relationships as he is completely selfish.
1322923279636680705 2020-11-01 23:27:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @marcorubio I do not trust Marco Rubio.
1322919793788391425 2020-11-01 23:13:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @maddow @bivens_e Deplorable dirty tricks. I am glad no innocent people were hurt by the ignorant trumpers. Thats how they deal with life by intimidation. These are the same people who tied black people to their pick up trucks and dragged them through the streets. So sick.
1322918507051442177 2020-11-01 23:08:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @kyle_teamjoe @bivens_e What??? ?
1322917388015280129 2020-11-01 23:04:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 Typical trump and trumpers. If these people are so sure trump is going to win then why do they have to resort to violence?
1322916445504872449 2020-11-01 23:00:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Last week trump questioned whether people who voted early and then died of covid should have their votes counted.
1322889114983825412 2020-11-01 21:11:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @mollycol1028 @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden That is a typical trump lie. Dems are notoriously peaceful. Turn the other cheek. But trump incites violence and greed.
1322888530557865986 2020-11-01 21:09:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump you are the most vile person on earth. What kind of person thinks this is funny and condones it. The real donald trump comes out. We are going to work very hard to get our country away from you!!!!!
1322887853764943872 2020-11-01 21:06:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaketapper @RepsForBiden Deplorable! The man is pure evil. A decent human being would have condemned these actions. trump endorses it.
1322886820049408000 2020-11-01 21:02:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @brat2381 @tcspeaks trump cares for no one but himslf.
1322886351264632834 2020-11-01 21:00:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Then I see something that lifts my heart. Chefs are bringing food trucks to crowded polling places and are handing out food to people standing on long lines in the cold. This is the spirit of the America i know and want back again. Not the hatred of trump and trumpets.
1322756427128180736 2020-11-01 12:24:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @liziaroto @bivens_e The future does not look good for Americans.
1322756055156350979 2020-11-01 12:23:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden @BarackObama That is what we are counting on.
1322754231753969669 2020-11-01 12:15:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsallprettybad @bivens_e If this clip is not illegal it should be. It is absolutely immoral, disgusting, outrageous and f**ked up. What is wrong with that family? That is his own daughter. Is he admitting to an incestuous relationship with her? He is much sicker than i thought.
1322749701658185728 2020-11-01 11:57:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump is way out there. I am not a mental health professional but as i see it trump is suffering a psychotic break. He has lost his grip on reality.His hate is worse, his racial bigotry has increased, I could go on and on but the bottom line is he has no self control. He is CRAZY
1322706951353098241 2020-11-01 09:08:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @NorsemanActual @tcspeaks @donwinslow @springsteen Don't forget you are all losers and suckers.
1322705041871044608 2020-11-01 09:00:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @DycOfficial @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Make some good trouble.
1322704727361134592 2020-11-01 08:59:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I thought trump said he didn't like people that got caught. Does the trump asshole remember anything he says?
1322703393027170304 2020-11-01 08:53:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP The bus company said they weren't paid. They the people had to were masks on the bus none of them did. The bus company said other company's said they had not been paid. Sound familiar? trump didn't pay his workers on his construction co. He got away with it by hiring illegals.
1322699607642693633 2020-11-01 08:38:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump is stilled pissed that Xi would not help trump win the presidency. trump told Xi that the prison camps he was building for muslims was ok
1322681808274788353 2020-11-01 07:28:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I grew up in New York City and i can tell you trump was known as a phony, lying, thieving, disgusting POS. He ran to florida before NY got him. Now it looks like the NY AG has plenty on him. Thats why he said at one of his rallys that if he loses he will have to leave the country
1322678937378525184 2020-11-01 07:16:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @KamalaHarris @TeamJoe You gotta love this girl.
1322677505866739712 2020-11-01 07:11:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @MaxKennerly @bivens_e Modern day Republicans are just obscene.
1322675489211822081 2020-11-01 07:03:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Liar
1322675027809021954 2020-11-01 07:01:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Liar
1322674587470045184 2020-11-01 06:59:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e The Republican party has turned into lying cheating asshole. McConnell is right up there with trump. Evil men!!!!-
1322674209169068032 2020-11-01 06:58:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse And you proved it couldn't.
1322673006246854656 2020-11-01 06:53:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @lynnschmidtrn @bivens_e Thank you!!!
1322672495498067973 2020-11-01 06:51:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 @bivens_e He started the supreme court rhetoric. He said he could only lose if dems cheated and then he said he will take it to the supreme court.
1322671683988344833 2020-11-01 06:47:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 @bivens_e There was no question that he placed kavanaugh and barrett on the supreme court to decide that he wins the presidency. If he believed in himself and that he is a great president why would he have to do that. He knows he's a screw up and a wannabe dictator.
1322665706052296706 2020-11-01 06:24:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Every word is untrue. trump is the worse pathological liar I have ever seen Stores in NY,Calif etc are boarding up their store because trumpers have threatened that if trump doesn't win they are going to riot and loot. Does anyone believe trump will send federal agents after them
1322657658172825600 2020-11-01 05:52:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @ChangeAbout1 @bivens_e @gtconway3d @openDemocracy @MotherJones @tahovhannisyan How nice
1322657533677457408 2020-11-01 05:51:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @cecmunoz @bivens_e @JoeBiden So much sadness and the man we are supposed to look up to doesn't even care. trump isn't up nights worried about the people getting sick he's up all night taking Adderall and tweeting nonsense.
1322655947353968642 2020-11-01 05:45:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @Richster_SF @bivens_e @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump So true. These trumpers think they are so smart insulting people who were masks, or don't believe that they should not be in crowds. But that is trump talking. They are like sheep following anything he says. But let them get sick and off to the hospital demanding treatment.
1322654757614428160 2020-11-01 05:40:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e It happens. I can't count the times i have said oh shit after i push send.
1322654300720476161 2020-11-01 05:38:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Funny because trump doesn't even have a plan. He thinks ignoring it or lying about it is the way to go. It is NOT! We have to face it and do what has to be done. trump doesn't even have a health care plan while he wants the court to strike downACA.
1322653295245217799 2020-11-01 05:34:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @Richster_SF @bivens_e @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump Trump said the Drs are claiming pts died of covid when they didn't so they are paid more which is bull shit. Doesn't it concern people that the president of the USA thinks like that and not thinking about the ones who have died helping pts. Medical professionals are dedicated.
1322629497334702082 2020-11-01 04:00:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @MovementLincoln @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump trump can't read. Melania reads better than him and she can't even speak english
1322628884462972929 2020-11-01 03:57:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing Where a cop when you need one?
1322627022611427328 2020-11-01 03:50:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e You made a mistake. You are describing donald trump not VP Biden.
1322617900155502594 2020-11-01 03:14:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump donal trump you are now exhibiting signs of schizophrenia. Yesterday you told everyone that Drs are claiming patients have covid so they can charge more money. Now today you are admiring them. You really need help.
1322615657272430592 2020-11-01 03:05:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheBlueTrane @bivens_e I have never watched a Rugby match but my family came from Wales so maybe I should try it.
1322614065198518275 2020-11-01 02:59:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @glamelegance @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump trump appears to be on tract to turn our country communist. Everything he says and does is not for the good of the American people it is all for donald trump. His apparent proclivity for dictators and authoritarian leaders shows me where his allegiance is. It is not with the USA
1322570467702702082 2020-11-01 00:05:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse @POTUS I wonder did you spread the virus to the children? After all you certainly have the virus in the white house. Of course how silly of me. None of you care about spreading the virus to children after all this is the administration that ripped baby's from their mothers arms.
1322339561117261825 2020-10-31 08:48:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @rxjef77 @tcspeaks Looks to me like he could use a little time in Rehab.
1322289377368772609 2020-10-31 05:28:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeathMayo @RepsForBiden Well said. Too many people thought his Apprentice actions were funny. But it didn't take long for the reality of who he really is to set in.
1322286282987417600 2020-10-31 05:16:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 I was so angry when the asshole had a rally at the Villages in fla. This is the largest retirement area in the country. I was so afraid of what would happen to these people. I posted an article on here today about the elderly in the Villages testing positive to covid. Really?
1322285177435992064 2020-10-31 05:12:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am not Republican anymore. I changed to Democrat in Fla. The Republican Party is no longer the party i belonged to.
1322284548936314880 2020-10-31 05:09:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Does anyone in that family have values? They see values as what a person is worth to them.
1322284138511126531 2020-10-31 05:08:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump Seeing him or listening to him makes me nauseous and makes my dog growl. The man look like a cross between an orange and porky pig. He sounds maniacal. HE wants to make fun of people?
1322280147626692608 2020-10-31 04:52:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He can't sleep because he snorts Adderall. Very simple. Watch the jackass at a third and fourth rally in one day. Does he talk normal?
1322279630041210880 2020-10-31 04:50:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Jared said it the other day. "They don't want it enough. What an asshole. What is he going to do hen trump goes to jail an America is no longer supporting that bunch of losers.
1322278568769081346 2020-10-31 04:45:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @_ReaalAmerican_ @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump How much do you think he and his klan have taken from the American people. There was an abbreviated list of some things he has billed the gov.for. ie: $6000 dinners. $685 a day to put people up in his hotel. $3 a glass for water.
1322277125873934343 2020-10-31 04:40:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @MarkMazzettiNYT @bivens_e @adamnagourney The most amazing thing I saw was when Fla. was shut down and only essential services could be open. I saw an open liquor store and right next door was an open gun shop both called essential. That is the kind of Governor Florida has.
1322275606931869699 2020-10-31 04:34:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @gotklss2 @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump I believe he told the truth of how he feels when he accused our military men and women as being losers and suckers. In his sick mind they aren't good enough to vote
1322274664660480002 2020-10-31 04:30:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @the_resistor @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump The worst trump has done is to accuse Dr's in hospital putting covid as cause of death to get more money. I can assure anyone that the Drs and nurses caring for these people suffer when they lose a patient. I am a retired health professional and know what i am talking about.
1322193908055613440 2020-10-30 23:09:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @CFaanes @itsJeffTiedrich @JamesIsaak2 There's a lot there to melt.

1322189757540110336 2020-10-30 22:52:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @AbuRaziel @realDonaldTrump This is what the trump klan does for fun. Any surprise that trump kills Americans for fun  He really has fun at the virus spreading rallys
1322169795190685697 2020-10-30 21:33:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @Villages_News Is this a surprise? trump doesn't care ho he kills with his rallys and Fla. Gov desantis lies and covers up for trump. He is not allowing correct numbers of deaths or hospitalizations. He did this back when he fired Dr. Jones for telling the truth. trump taught desantis well.
1322163165057220609 2020-10-30 21:07:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @Dan_F_Jacobson @bivens_e Was there any doubt that the Republicans set the Supreme Court up to their advantage not to what is good for America.
1322162410480947203 2020-10-30 21:04:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 @RepsForBiden There is more profit associated with sick and dying. He has his hands in drug companies. In PPE's etc. Much more profitable than well people.
1322161688968339463 2020-10-30 21:01:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @Burrite @RepsForBiden What alternate reality is trump living in?
1322161361518997504 2020-10-30 21:00:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden When has trump and his klan done anything for other people without looking for a return. They are such a selfish bunch. Why don't they go out and hand out food to the less fortunate. Give away some of the money they have stolen since taking over the white house. I know lol.
1322160277417299968 2020-10-30 20:55:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I just watched a show that tells the story of the decency and caring of the American people. A childrens hospital put on a halloween for all the kids in the hospital. There was so much love put into it by Doctors and Nurses. What a stark contrast to trump hate, and lies.
1322148151814443008 2020-10-30 20:07:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Promises made, promises NOT kept.
1322147830400778240 2020-10-30 20:06:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e We have to have long memories and clean up all the damage done by trump when VP Biden takes office.
1322147270142398464 2020-10-30 20:04:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e trump lies he is the one who will bankrupt this country. Fill his klans pockets then sell our country to the highest bidder
1322145340657684482 2020-10-30 19:56:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @BeschlossDC @bivens_e I don't understand holding back voting. I put my ballot in the first day I could before trump ran to court again to take my voting tights away.
1322140498056957957 2020-10-30 19:37:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @curiouser1920 @RepsForBiden You are so right. I know I do.
1322139858308091906 2020-10-30 19:34:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @brianschatz @bivens_e What can we believe in anymore? Our rights are being eroded little by little. Thank you trump for destroying democracy.
1322139336133980161 2020-10-30 19:32:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaketapper @RepsForBiden I sincerely hope the trump klan never lose someone they love to this virus. It is a pain that VP Biden describes as a black hole in your  chest. I would not wish it on my worst enemy or the trump klan.
1322138490616848384 2020-10-30 19:29:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @RonBrownstein @bivens_e This is not the way our country runs  Never have so many liars and cheats  invaded our court systems. trump manipulated the courts so he and his klan can continue living high on the hog while American children are going hungry. We have to take back our country.
1322136987579670528 2020-10-30 19:23:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @NBCNews @RepsForBiden What about trumps begging communists to help him win election?
1322136615729418240 2020-10-30 19:21:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @Strandjunker @bivens_e I voted Democrat straight down the ticket.
1322136094901678081 2020-10-30 19:19:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It is just criminal. Who will stand trial for all the deaths.
1322135736959852549 2020-10-30 19:18:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @RyanAFournier @bivens_e So ridicules! If trump has done the right thing from the beginning we would not be in this position  How can anyone be so blind as to believe him anymore. Ask him about a health plan and when is the virus just going away. The man is a pathological liar.
1321994920903716874 2020-10-30 09:58:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @DrBiden @tcspeaks I so look forward to a time when as. Americans we treat each other with decency and respect again.
1321993722234621953 2020-10-30 09:53:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @LincolnsBible The children were taken from their parents and the parents were deported. trump was not done there he wanted the parents shot. He ordered the border patrol to shoot all of them. Did they? It would make sense that the parents could not be found because they are dead.
1321991177185468423 2020-10-30 09:43:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I just heard Al Gore say trump has duped the people who believe him  Everyone is in agreement of one thing we can't get rid of trump fast enough
1321990041086971905 2020-10-30 09:39:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 Wow so incredible! I am in awe of such talent.
1321988956481794048 2020-10-30 09:35:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So we don't have to worry about getting sick or dying anymore because trump made the virus go away?
1321959260893360130 2020-10-30 07:37:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden With all that has gone on with trump and the terrible pain he has inflicted on the American people i am not so sure the Republican Party can repair itself.
1321957426137104387 2020-10-30 07:29:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA @RepsForBiden Is trump really part of the human race?
1321956234086522880 2020-10-30 07:25:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @Starfish12171 @WhiteHouse Sorry it must have been wishful thinking or i am just mentally exhausted seeing and hearing trump.
1321953382869929988 2020-10-30 07:13:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @JaRonSmith45 @HHS_ASH What health care?
1321952687399849987 2020-10-30 07:10:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 I didn't like trump but when the terrible stories of what was happening to these children i have come to HATE trump. Anyone who can condone such treatment to children is unconscionable
1321949916378370049 2020-10-30 06:59:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @jaketapper @RepsForBiden Why????????
1321949463343190017 2020-10-30 06:58:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @SecretaryCarson Where's trumps health care plan? He going togo to supreme court to end obama care but there is nothing to replace it
1321904655287394305 2020-10-30 04:00:04 +0800 <dmhossley> This was a mistake? Only if they got caught. The trumps are a bunch of theves
1321903305807769600 2020-10-30 03:54:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Thank you for spreading the virus to vulnerable Floridians
1321902733788590080 2020-10-30 03:52:26 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump administration returns $3.4M taken from ailing 9/11 FDNY program in error  https://t.co/Xfpx5HtmFt
1321900781822500864 2020-10-30 03:44:40 +0800 <dmhossley> Dr. Birx has vowed to never sit in a WH task force meeting with dr. Atlas again. I thought she was going to walk away when trump made the comment about injecting disinfectants to kill the virus in the body. I watched her body language and she looked mortified
1321898989680095233 2020-10-30 03:37:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Florida is going to need them after the super spreader event in tampa today. I don't think the people will see any of those tests. I have a feeling desantis is selling them to the highest bidder since he shares trumps thinking. More tests more cases. That right stupid
1321896807719383043 2020-10-30 03:28:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @liziaroto @bivens_e Thats because trump is a racist bigot. Always has been like his father and always will be.
1321896049015988226 2020-10-30 03:25:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar @bivens_e Why is this man so full of hate. All he does is ridicule people and make baseless lies. Has trump looked in the mirror lately. If he did he would see he has no business making fun of some one else.
1321895177582202881 2020-10-30 03:22:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @JennaEllisEsq Did someone you loved die of the virus? If not then thank your lucky stars you don't have to go through this hell.
1321894216792969216 2020-10-30 03:18:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsallprettybad @bivens_e Not wearing a mask is not a personal choice. It is a very selfish choice that can kill another person. I don't remember Americans not caring for each other before trump. We were always a caring society now so many are only caring for themselves. I hope i never feel that way
1321892783356055553 2020-10-30 03:12:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Everything about trump is gross and freaks me out. I have to change the channel when he come on because my dog starts growling. Now I know why the trump klan doesn't have a dog in the white house DOGS HATE TRUMP. at least mine does and she loves everybody They say listen to a dog
1321891264703451138 2020-10-30 03:06:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SecBrouillette trump and desantes do nothing good for the state of florida. The only thing they do is attend QAnon parties. It terrifies many Floridians that QAnon is in our neighborhood. Brought here by trump and desantis.
1321890192819654657 2020-10-30 03:02:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden No one or nothing will stop him.
1321889965257666561 2020-10-30 03:01:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Nothing i want to see.
1321889420161798144 2020-10-30 02:59:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse How can you lie like that. If someone still has a job in fla. i can guarantee they have not gotten a raise. The fact is you are not only bankrupting the country but have plans to bankrupt Senior Citizens in Fla. Under you plan Social Security will run out in 2003.
1321888017309642755 2020-10-30 02:53:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @BN9 Why is Bay News Nine only showing trumps rally today. VP Biden is also in Fla.andIwas looking forward to seeing him. I have Bay News Nine because I have Spectrum cable and internet. I am very upset that Spectrum obviously is only going to show trump. That is so wrong.
1321871664641167360 2020-10-30 01:48:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump is so evil and self serving. Not good for a President of the free world.
1321870403694972929 2020-10-30 01:43:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @ananavarro @RepsForBiden A Biden victory would mend the relationships with our allies that trump destroyed. He only wants relationships with dictators and communists. Find out what he and putin talked about in Helsinki. They went into a room alone with only translators.
1321868723377098753 2020-10-30 01:37:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I read yesterday that trump asked that people who have voted and then died of covid have their votes thrown out.  What a sociopath.
1321867667532324870 2020-10-30 01:33:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse So many lies
1321867533645918216 2020-10-30 01:32:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep Maybe trump will bail him out
1321866476819808259 2020-10-30 01:28:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouseCEA @WhiteHouse Do you think we should be grateful that our loved ones died because according to trump "we suffered the least severe contraction" dead is dead, trump.
1321865792053481472 2020-10-30 01:25:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump took advantage of the American spirit. He does not care about the Citizens. He only cares about himself and wants to stay in the white house until he completely bankrupts our country and then hands it over to Putin
1321864529236676610 2020-10-30 01:20:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e There was a list put out yesterday listing all the money trump charged to the tax payers. He charged dinners at $6000. He charged for rooms at his hotel for guests to stay at over $650.per night. He charged $3.per glass for water.etc etc etc
1321863465879953408 2020-10-30 01:16:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecBrouillette @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump And the stock market dropped yesterday.
1321863142201303041 2020-10-30 01:15:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trump has not kept a single promise he made so why should we believe him now. He is just out for himself and his wealthy friends.
1321862639903977473 2020-10-30 01:13:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @EricTrump Is that something to brag about?
1321790410889506817 2020-10-29 20:26:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @CarnesOnQuack @realDonaldTrump Good for you. I wish you well!
1321779804472004608 2020-10-29 19:43:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The good news for Floridians planning on going to trumps covidathon in tampa today is that when he abandons you, you won't be left out in the cold the temps will be nice. I really pray anyone going will PLEASE wear a mask.
1321775695262060545 2020-10-29 19:27:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis If any Floridians are looking for their Governor today just look in Tampa where trump will be. Desantis is attached at the hip to trump so to hell with what the citizens may need. I wonder if they will be at a QAnon party after trump is done lying. Expect the lies about a vaccine
1321572344335314944 2020-10-29 05:59:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I hope you send the buses back to pick those people up. i kept saying that trump was busing those people in and i was right. Did the American people pay for them I saw today how much the gov. paid you for meals flowers hotel rooms in your hotels and $3 for a glass of water. Thief
1321570604831617024 2020-10-29 05:52:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The day Americans took their country back from donald trump.
1321570047006023684 2020-10-29 05:50:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump A new book alleges trump as a traitor and it alleges trump will go down in history as the worse president we have ever had. The book is traitor by david rothkopf.
1321562672857571329 2020-10-29 05:21:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Has trump found the parents of the 545 children he had torn from their mothers arms. How would trump feel if his son with melania was taken away because she is an immigrant? Or your 3 grandchildren taken away because someone accused your daughter of child abuse?
1321538965271388162 2020-10-29 03:46:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @mjs_DC @bivens_e Kavanaugh should never been seated on the Supreme Court, but he like barrett owe trump big time. Watch and see what those two do but don't be surprised
1321536578230145030 2020-10-29 03:37:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart @bivens_e The temperature was freezing while these people were stranded on the street. Some went to the hospital. This should not be surprising. trump doesn't care about people the sociopath only thinks about what is happening to him.
1321244232967954432 2020-10-28 08:15:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @curtrichardson @bivens_e @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump Fire the liar
1321243886040322063 2020-10-28 08:14:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden If trump were any kind of human being he would have a little compassion for the families of the dead.  The scientists advise that we forgo large family gatherings for the holidays. Well for 227,000 families there will be permanent empty chairs.
1321242578109562880 2020-10-28 08:09:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @DanielBShapiro @bivens_e Kavanaugh is showing his true colors.
1321241913354321921 2020-10-28 08:06:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar trump you had better hope VPBiden does not get shot. Since you made this comment on Oct. 27th you will be the prime suspect.
1321220986407211015 2020-10-28 06:43:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden If it were to your advantage you wouldn't have a problem. I will put your mind at ease the next president of USA is President Joe Biden.
1321219537803661312 2020-10-28 06:37:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @MovementLincoln @bivens_e Hopefully we will not hear any more from the liar, liar, liar
1321218717141839884 2020-10-28 06:34:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden NO!!!!!!
1321218536430338049 2020-10-28 06:33:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump is a disgusting low life.
1321218100373716993 2020-10-28 06:31:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I wonder if the wives he is talking to are white suburban women.
1321216860591935489 2020-10-28 06:27:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden @TeamJoe No American should be afraid to say Black Lives Matter. The only person i have heard talk against those words is racist bigoted trump.
1321204368230801411 2020-10-28 05:37:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @AlCardenasFL_DC @bivens_e Sounds like he snorted a little too much Adderall.
1321203306656604165 2020-10-28 05:33:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are right those of us who have died won't hear covid covid covid anymore. You made the comment more than once that you think you should stay in power for at least 12 yrs. You had better count your blessings if the American people let you stay until Jan 20th.
1321199283186606082 2020-10-28 05:17:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I see Melania looking like she wants to rip trumps toupee off.
1321198206399774720 2020-10-28 05:12:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I forgot that. trump did start this election out asking to extend the election because of the pandamic.
1321197478079827971 2020-10-28 05:10:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump didn't feel that way in 2016. He never said a word because he knew his cheating put him over the top. He did not win the popular vote.
1321196158316937217 2020-10-28 05:04:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I voted for Joe Biden and my vote is going to make a difference
1321195812387475459 2020-10-28 05:03:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @SarahLongwell25 @RepsForBiden I have yet to find a suburban  woman who likes trump. Actually i have been told he makes their skin crawl.
1321190019739115520 2020-10-28 04:40:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @AriBerman @bivens_e Kavanaugh is showing the true reason trump had him placed on the Supreme Court and if anyone doubts why Barrett is there just watch. This will mar the Supreme Court for a long time.
1321185936659591170 2020-10-28 04:24:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe Mike Bloomberg will loan trump some money.
1321185220616441858 2020-10-28 04:21:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @Bill_Maxwell_ @bivens_e By the way which is it you can't find the parents or the parents don't want them? You can't have it both ways.
1321183854296731649 2020-10-28 04:15:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @Bill_Maxwell_ @bivens_e I can't believe trumpers would use children to make a point. As a Mother I will not believe such bull shit.. The fact is trump had those children ripped from their mothers arms and anyone who tries to spin a lie about it is just as evil as trump
1321182259723014145 2020-10-28 04:09:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump is willingly and wantonly running a totally dishonest campaign. Jake Tapper said this and I wholeheartedly agree with him.
1321181318865162241 2020-10-28 04:05:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump It sounds like trump would be more receptive to getting rid of covid if there were millions of deaths. He downplays only 226,000 deaths. We may have millions before this is over with and we have donald trump to blame for it.
1321179062115729417 2020-10-28 03:56:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @cmarinucci @bivens_e @POTUS @politico Didn't you hear? Covid is going away we are rounding the corner (whatever that means). I am so glad I have sense enough to not listen to trump and his BS.
1321178418558439426 2020-10-28 03:54:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @BidenForFL @bivens_e @BarackObama I could listen to Pres. Obama all day. He makes sense not like trump who can't chew gum and walk at the same time.
1321177435107459075 2020-10-28 03:50:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @nicoleperlroth @bivens_e Doesn't everybody that crosses trump? The funny part is they are beginning to turn on him
1321176446551863296 2020-10-28 03:46:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @bivens_e @ProjectLincoln I can think of another. Lindsey Graham is a despicable lying ass who fits right in with the trump admin.
1321175904450740224 2020-10-28 03:44:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @NtvLdySteph @bivens_e He doesn't care about people unless he has a use for them. Money is all he cares about. How many people died because he didn't want the stock market fall. The man is pure evil.
1321173164815196160 2020-10-28 03:33:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @DonnaPimental @WhiteHouse No she is not. She has very little experience as a judge.i guess it is ok for a judge on the Supreme Court to get on the job training. Of course she is only expected to vote trumps way.
1321170058949918722 2020-10-28 03:21:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Oh please fair and impartial law? Nothing trump does is fair or impartial. He has an agenda for the jurist Barrett
1321169364364787719 2020-10-28 03:18:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e I am really hoping this will all change with the elections
1321131010982105092 2020-10-28 00:45:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @Olivianuzzi @bivens_e Send a little to Fla. It's hot as hell here.
1321129863303041027 2020-10-28 00:41:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @jonmladd She will never be able to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is only there to do the Republicans and trumps bidding. Time will tell. I certainly hope she is honest, but why would trump nominate her if she is.
1321128396978593792 2020-10-28 00:35:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @CNN @bivens_e I hope no one is surprised by this. I am sure there are many more that could not be tracked.
1321127859558223872 2020-10-28 00:33:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @DonaldJTrumpJr You HAVE nothing so you make up shit
1321126788735655941 2020-10-28 00:29:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I don't think any of us believe that If this is true what was the big rush to get her voted in?
1321126113729536001 2020-10-28 00:26:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheBlueTrane @bivens_e So precious!
1321125666444759040 2020-10-28 00:24:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheBlueTrane @bivens_e And what beautiful eyes they are.
1321087621754429442 2020-10-27 21:53:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Don't forget trump also pushed kavanaugh. Why?  so he would have his allegiance. Everything is so crooked including the Republican party since trump took office. I know that has always been the way trump rolls, but the Republican party?
1321085975586656256 2020-10-27 21:46:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @heislerbobbie @bivens_e @MeidasTouch I became an activist in the 60's protesting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Now trump pushed this jurist so she can destroy all the hard work women have done to have a voice. I am so afraid that women will go back to back alley abortions and death.
1321083977508265985 2020-10-27 21:38:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Was Barrett's oath to donald trump? It feels like she will vote however he wants her to because she owes him. It really is a shame that an American citizen has to feel this way but the Republican party I knew and loved has been decimated. There just doesn't seem to be much left.
1320892395777675271 2020-10-27 08:57:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Another trump super spreader event
1320891317686251522 2020-10-27 08:53:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump What lie will you tell as to why this happened?
1320890440967704576 2020-10-27 08:49:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Why don't you be a big boy and admit defeat. No body likes you jackass. Just go the hell away and let America recover from all the damage you have caused especially the quarter of a million American citizens you killed.
1320889028657487879 2020-10-27 08:44:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse And the most unqualified. She will be seated with jurists who have many years of experience and would never be bribed to vote in favor of the people who are responsible for them being there. This is such a disrespectful act against the memory of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
1320887001709727746 2020-10-27 08:36:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden As a health care provider for many years i am appalled by the insinuation that Drs. are inflating covid numbers to get more money. Drs. and nurses put their lives on the line to save covid patients. putting in long hours and staying away from their families as to not infect them.
1320885235110891521 2020-10-27 08:29:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Jared trump why don't you go back under the rock you crawled out of.
1320884681341079555 2020-10-27 08:27:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer They don't realize that the laugh will be on them when they are voted out. Americans have a long memory.
1320882968068579328 2020-10-27 08:20:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse Democrats should pack the court after this spiteful stunt.
1320882433957441537 2020-10-27 08:18:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Such a sham. At least you could have found someone with the qualifications to have a seat on the Supreme Court. You couldn't find anyone who would goalong with your sham but herShe is so desperate to be on the court that she has promised to vote for Republican cases as a pay back
1320880100305522688 2020-10-27 08:08:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Also Republicans who are finding out how spiteful the Republican Senate is. I think the Republican party will lose many Americans because of trump and now this. It is no longer a party that cares for it's citizens.
1320879161246965760 2020-10-27 08:05:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse This the second sham imposed on American citizens. The first is trump and all the lies he tells. I just can not believe that Senators who were voted in by Americans would put an unqualified jurist on the most important court in the land just to spite Democrats. That is really low
1320861730126385153 2020-10-27 06:55:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @DrBiden @RepsForBiden We need a National Day of Remembrance for all the Americans trump killed.
1320860632082767875 2020-10-27 06:51:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @DrBiden @bivens_e I hope you can take a few minutes to enjoy Savannah it is so beautiful.
1320856478979424257 2020-10-27 06:34:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump I saw two comments about trump that i really like  Fire the liar   Dump the trump
1320855338732670982 2020-10-27 06:30:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @chickiej1 @bivens_e If only God could stop the destructive maniac trump and the corrupt gov. desantis.
1320854577281982469 2020-10-27 06:27:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @TB_Times @bivens_e Desantis is culpable too. They must both be stopped before they totally destroy this state. Desantis obviously doesn't care about the people but ruin the environment for what?
1320853454777143297 2020-10-27 06:22:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scaramucci I bet trump wishes he didn't screw you over!
1320852384436932615 2020-10-27 06:18:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @MovementLincoln @bivens_e It would be interesting to know how many world leaders he has tried to extort money from. He hates XI Jinping because he would not promise to help him win this election.
1320850126060036097 2020-10-27 06:09:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @RickABright @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump trump has never been a leader. People said they voted for him as a business man. If they had taken the time to research him they would have known he is a failed business man.Just look at the companies he bankrupt. You let him bankrupt our country. Congratulations trump supporters
1320848113767190530 2020-10-27 06:01:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Obnoxious
1320847809965395970 2020-10-27 06:00:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @bivens_e Who does trump like?
1320847625428545536 2020-10-27 05:59:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @DemWrite @bivens_e Absolutely. The Republicans have allowed that nutcase in the White House turn them into spiteful, hateful idiots. They deserve every thing that happens to them because they don't have the spine to stand up to that babbling jackass.
1320846467532263425 2020-10-27 05:55:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are going to lose because you are a FRAUD and now most of this country knows it  The only thing you can do if spin your pathological lies about voter fraud. There are so many coming out and voting because of all the stupid shit you say.  Everyone know you are a sociopath
1320823567236423684 2020-10-27 04:24:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump It is all on trump. He ignored this virus until everything fell apart. He admitted it in Woodwards book. So every death or lingering illness, every business or every citizen that have lost everything is ALL trumps fault and he will have to live with that for the rest of his life.
1320821307466985473 2020-10-27 04:15:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump is a f**king killer. Does he think if he ignores covid it will go away. That may happen sometimes in life, but it will not with this virus. There are too many who have lost someone. We will remind him over and over. He doesn't get to forget.
1320819657314586625 2020-10-27 04:08:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Has anyone ever told trump he is a f**king ass?
1320818771439898624 2020-10-27 04:05:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump BS
1320817161141653505 2020-10-27 03:58:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli @RepsForBiden trump does not say or do the right things, jared trump
1320816660106911744 2020-10-27 03:56:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Yes, that's why he is so fixated on Antifa. It stands for anti fascist.
1320768439619903491 2020-10-27 00:45:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @mtomasky @bivens_e @thedailybeast Vote Biden/Harris to save our country
1320767931421216768 2020-10-27 00:43:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @JasonKander Jared trump is a crazy shithead.
1320767415257583616 2020-10-27 00:41:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How does trump dare to presume he knows what suburban women want. Any decent suburban woman would not let the likes of trump anywhere near them.
1320762723123298305 2020-10-27 00:22:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I thought he is going by the name Jared Trump.
1320761971625644034 2020-10-27 00:19:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Jared Kushner is a POS just like trump.
1320761350667251718 2020-10-27 00:16:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Absolutely. We should fight fire with fire.
1320760021957906434 2020-10-27 00:11:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Covid, covid, covid, you racist ass.

1320754126142267394 2020-10-26 23:48:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Racist piece of shit. No conscience or soul. Vote Biden/Harris.
1320753769483816962 2020-10-26 23:46:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Many Floridians have made their minds up about the gov. desantis. He is trumps puppet. He seems more interested in QAnon.  He doesn't give a damn that Floridians are sick. Mayors have been told to handle their towns themselves. We have to have Biden in and desantis out.
1320752072829161472 2020-10-26 23:40:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump and his thugs are collecting info on Blacks in Miami Dade county in Fla.They are following them on facebook Looking at their purchases on credit cards and other invasive actions why? To convince them to vote for trump through intimidation.  trump can't win on his own merrit
1320744424763232256 2020-10-26 23:09:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @Susan_Hennessey @bivens_e I wish the dems would! The Republicans have cheated and lied to get things to go their way. The Republican Party is no longer the party i knew .it is now filled with spiteful nasty old men
1320742939350470657 2020-10-26 23:03:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @Strandjunker @bivens_e I will bet those translators notes will be real bad for trump. He made the translators sign promises that they will not speak about putin and trumps conversation.
1320742176385585153 2020-10-26 23:00:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @kaitlancollins @bivens_e What a bunch of BS.
1320740825190510594 2020-10-26 22:55:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @matthewamiller @bivens_e He and trump do not give a damn for human life but their own.
1320740679698579458 2020-10-26 22:54:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @medit8now @bivens_e trump the asshole!
1320740281763930112 2020-10-26 22:53:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e We have one person who has encouraged White Supremacists and other right winged terrorists to engage in all this and that is racist, bigot TRUMP
1320739323772342272 2020-10-26 22:49:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @PaulLeeTeeks I don't know why he is spending time on this instead of figuring out how to save our lives from the virus.
1320738642248216576 2020-10-26 22:46:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Shopping. I am saving a lot by not going to the stores with friends. I may never go back.
1320738274864934913 2020-10-26 22:45:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Or health care to replace ACA that he is going to have his new Supreme Court justice rule against  That is the only reason she was rushed to the bench. It certainly is not her court experience. She will get on the job training.
1320737077194088448 2020-10-26 22:40:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e He' s desperate. desperate, desperate
1320689699250425858 2020-10-26 19:32:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @lotsofuss @bivens_e When he's done send him to the bunker.
1320689206268710913 2020-10-26 19:30:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @MarshallCohen @bivens_e Did anyone tell trump he won? He still running his 2016 campaign. Move on trump.
1320688391902666753 2020-10-26 19:27:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar @bivens_e He has been unfit for the job from the beginning. He knows nothing about what is needed to run a country. He cares nothing about the people he vowed to protect. People are hungry and people are dying all because of trumps leadership or rather lack of leadtship
1320687130272780293 2020-10-26 19:22:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @tedlieu @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Running away is trumps response to anything or anyone who does not agree with him including Suburban women.
1320686494152089602 2020-10-26 19:19:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoyceWhiteVance @bivens_e Just another example of trumps inability to deal with strong women. He keeps begging suburban women to vote for him that he is protecting our neighborhoods. Sorry no we want him to leave our neighborhood's alone.  Vote Biden/harris!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1320685329892954112 2020-10-26 19:14:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenKamalaHarris @bivens_e In Fla.we have a Republican Gov. who will not even recognize that our state is rising in cases. Instead he goes to all irresponsible trump rallys Floridians are on their own to protect themselves from people who will not be responsible for protecting others.
1320542744524300288 2020-10-26 09:48:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @yourauntemma @bivens_e The truth is he is an idiotic asshole
1320541267047129089 2020-10-26 09:42:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith It is a shame that trump has time for a bunch of BS, but has no time to try and help Americans dying from a virus he did not stop in the beginning. Not only is trump going to be remember for this tragedy but the Republican party is going down with him.
1320520073711374337 2020-10-26 08:18:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 It was in NY where the nurses and doctors were working around the clock and had to wear thesame masks because there were non available. He was at one of the hospitals and wanted to know whereall the PPE's went asif the doctors and nurses were stealing them. Typical trump bullshit
1320518561870340105 2020-10-26 08:12:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @NWSDetroit Are you sure you don't have a Christmas gig for him?
1320517801430450176 2020-10-26 08:09:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith I just had an epiphany while watching trump make a spectacle himself on 60 minutes.  I think his hands are shrinking. Could it be?
1320506447969570817 2020-10-26 07:24:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump says he's a Christian but what  true Christian curses, lies, steals, cheats on his wife and uses a church and a bible for a photo op.
1320505169856155649 2020-10-26 07:19:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 True. All Republicans are complicit. They don't say anything to trump because they are afraid of him which tells me volumes about them. trump just has a big mouth. He yells and curses at people who don't agree with him which makes him an ignorant bitch.
1320483040326520832 2020-10-26 05:51:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Instead of worrying about Sudan you should be worrying about the American people. It doesn't bother you that 225,000 Americans died on your watch. You say nothing tothe families who lost them. You have the nerve to salute the losers and suckers.Every military death is felt by all
1320481009184497664 2020-10-26 05:43:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Orange face
1320480789432336386 2020-10-26 05:42:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer She has little experience and is not qualified to sit on the highest court in the land. The qualification she has as far as Republicans are concerned is her promise to them to vote how they want her to. And she is so desperate  to get ahead the easy way she will promise anything
1320478547937546243 2020-10-26 05:33:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Liar
1320478311747899393 2020-10-26 05:32:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Another trump lie.
1320478102993145858 2020-10-26 05:31:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What about the 545 children that you had ripped from their parents arms. No one cares about the garbage you are patting yourself on the back about. You are just an ignorant ass who has killed over 250,000 Americans. The people you swore to protect. You let this virus run rampant
1320476136871219205 2020-10-26 05:23:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @DonaldJTrumpJr Go snort your coke asshole  You have nothing to say and you have nothing we want to hear.

1320158546919628800 2020-10-25 08:21:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mimirocah1 @bivens_e Enough
1320158286277206018 2020-10-25 08:20:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @ConservBlue2020 @RepsForBiden This proves the true evil of trump. He has no conscience or soul.
1320157548268408833 2020-10-25 08:17:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Of course they did.
1320156832036540416 2020-10-25 08:14:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump is so right the greatest day of peace is when he and his klan are kicked out. Since we are paying all of them a salary i wonder if they will try to collect unemployment.
1320156085861449730 2020-10-25 08:11:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden No trump wouldn't say it because he is a wanna be dictator.
1320155283306500098 2020-10-25 08:08:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsallprettybad @bivens_e That maniac trump makes fun of covid. I personally don't believe he had it.I think it was a ploy so he could say covid is nothing that he had it and it was no big deal.he said if a plane crashed with 500 people on board tbe news would not cover it they just keep covering covid
1320152633462710273 2020-10-25 07:58:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse In the last four years Americans have received nothing from Washington and trump but broken promises, brazen sellouts, and lost jobs. Unemployment has not been this bad since the depression. People do not have the money to pay rent or mortgage, or enough food for their children
1320135775019741184 2020-10-25 06:51:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @JohnnyGWeir @NBCOlympics @taralipinski @terrygannon83 @TanithWhite Thanks Johnny. I watched today and will be watching tonight.  It is strange seeing the cutouts instead of fans in the seat but to be able to see the skaters is worth it.
1320135098684100609 2020-10-25 06:48:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept Why did he all of a sudden remember them? Why didn't he do this 4 yrs ago? I can bet there have been lives lost because he waited until he could use it as a re election ploy What a bullshit artist!!!
1320133706418393088 2020-10-25 06:42:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump just makes up this shit then throws it out there hoping someone will believe it. Just because people are over 65 does not mean they are senile. They see what they are paying. Actually trump may be senile.
1320132237287936001 2020-10-25 06:37:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @GailHorn @artsyboy1985 @Angel2daMax You can go online to your Supervisor of Elections and put your info. It should tell you if your ballot was received and counted.
1320130269341503488 2020-10-25 06:29:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer The Republicans rejected it because the majority of them and their leader trump are all bullies.They can't stand up and be men. Look at McConnell his power comes from denying relief for citizens who are desperate. I would bet he was beat up a lot as a kid and probably deserved it
1320127965578039296 2020-10-25 06:20:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @AdrianEngGast @TeamJoe This is so great. Good for them
1320101127589974019 2020-10-25 04:33:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept We all know how trump feels about human trafficking especially the young girls.
1320100385567145984 2020-10-25 04:30:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse All he did for florida was put a bunch of senior citizens at risk for covid at the Villiages so he could fill there heads with his idiotic bullshit. I know one thing though. Seniors in Fla do nut trust hime. The same goes for suburban women.
1320099433598640131 2020-10-25 04:26:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Who's money is paying for this? I thought trump and his klan are broke. Are the taxpayers paying and trump will take the profits. He will do that if he thinks he can get away with it. Maybe he can who's supervising him?
1320098213999816704 2020-10-25 04:21:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Covid covid covid covid covid covid Covid is here to stay jackass

1320071665825517569 2020-10-25 02:36:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe They wouldn't be intimidating people at the polls if they thought they were winning.
1320070934900969473 2020-10-25 02:33:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaRaisner @TeamJoe @JoeBiden Trump just said there were only 4 people that showed up for VPBidens speech. The fact is trumpers had to disrupt the speech because they are afraid trump is losing
1320069501023625217 2020-10-25 02:27:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @USTreasury @realDonaldTrump American taxpayer can pay for this BS but can not feed children in this country. Shame on all of you trumpers
1320068821777063938 2020-10-25 02:25:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Is anyone surprised by these revelations? trump is a thief. He never worked for a living. He never missed a meal because he was broke. He never waited for 6 hrs on line to get a box of food for his klan. Instead of spewing his bullshit he should befiguring out how to fix all this
1320066698473603073 2020-10-25 02:16:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Have you advised trump about all the laws he has broken while in office. He is so desperate to win the election because he knows he is facing jail for many of his crimes. My wish for trump is that he is put in gen pop he deserves it.
1320065598802530305 2020-10-25 02:12:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The down side is that we still have to put up with trumps crap until ja. 20th. Can Biden as pres. elect make trump leave the white house when all the ballots are counted? Trump would do that.
1320064827511930881 2020-10-25 02:09:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump What a busy bee. You are doing last minute what you should have been doing for 4 yrs. So you only are doing all these things to score votes. You are so transparent. You have no other material to amuse people at your rallys but to make fun of others? You are an ass.
1320053110727938049 2020-10-25 01:22:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @quilterchick2 @ChrisCuomo We will see in a week how many senior citizens he killed with his stupid rally at the Villages in Fla last night. What kind of person does that?
1320052378553430016 2020-10-25 01:19:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Not true.
1320052083609997315 2020-10-25 01:18:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Trump was not elected by the American people. He cheated. That is what he does best beside lying.
1320051590724812800 2020-10-25 01:16:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Thats funny because you have been saying that VPBiden is hiding in his basement. How can he be in two places at the same time.
1320050721211940864 2020-10-25 01:13:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I can not stop laughing at you trump. You have a quarter of the donations VPBiden has so now you say the only people that support him are his donors. Even your donors are not supporting you. You are broke ha ha how does it feel?
1320048548260569088 2020-10-25 01:04:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @glamelegance @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Thank you!!!
1320048412960706561 2020-10-25 01:04:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheDemCoalition @bivens_e @ProjectLincoln Funny. What is this lawsuit # 201? I hope the trump and klan have plenty of money to pay all their lawyers. Oh wait they will have to defend daddy first because there are just as many lawsuits against him and then there are laws he has broken.
1320036016695218177 2020-10-25 00:14:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I am fine with saying trump is the biggest asshole in this country. He has to cheat and encourage his supporters to cheat to win. Biden supporters di not have to do that because we really believe in Biden
1320035516583116800 2020-10-25 00:12:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Why do trump people have to interfer and make so much noise when we are listening to our man,VPBiden. Are they so worried trump is going to lose? Why do they have harris people trying to vote? If they had confidence in trump they would not have to do these things.
1320020722744516608 2020-10-24 23:13:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS Will the children be wearing masks and social distancing? With the trump track record regarding children I think it is safe to say the safety of children is not a priority.
1319789974083063808 2020-10-24 07:57:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have never called trump my president. He is just trump to me.
1319789550168924161 2020-10-24 07:55:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @FlomamaFlo @tcspeaks @LarryLSandigo @MrJonCryer We have trump to thank for this unspeakable cruelty. I still have nightmares about those babies. I am sure it hurts all Mothers hearts.
1319788315583959040 2020-10-24 07:50:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @bebe1969 @bivens_e We used to call people who did that BULLYS There are ways of dealing with them
1319786890229415936 2020-10-24 07:44:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Another trump pipe dream. He just keeps racking them up.
1319786126849298433 2020-10-24 07:41:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden He had an earpiece in so when he started to go off they told him to calm down. It was so funny to a friend of mine on the phone while we watched. I would say look at his face its getting red He's going to go off and then he would calm down. Isn't that cheating?
1319784462629130240 2020-10-24 07:35:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Don't do us any favors. Very few people want anything to do with a vaccine that you pushed the drug co's to make fast. I will not have any vaccine that is not safe. I trust Dr. Fauci to let us know when that is. I would never listen to crazy lying trump.
1319782998947090432 2020-10-24 07:29:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 There are many Biden supporters at the Villages. Trump is so stupid he thinks people come to hear what he has to say. More often than not they come to see him make an asshole of himself which he does quite well. No one takes him seriously
1319781014168883202 2020-10-24 07:21:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Really? The least racist person in the room.
1319780740717043712 2020-10-24 07:20:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @lakersblake2 @laytenitecoffee @Acyn I ameven more determined to survive this hell so i can testify to the fact that this was all trump and the Republicans faultThey did nothing to protect us.They made it a political statement to wear a mask. I don't care what these assholes say about my wearing one. I hope to live.
1319778762737786885 2020-10-24 07:12:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Really? What senior citizens are they?
1319778077635989504 2020-10-24 07:09:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Volumes.
1319777561447141376 2020-10-24 07:07:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RexChapman @bivens_e Is that why he slapped Malenias hand away and pushed her? Did she forget his stash?
1319777095279611905 2020-10-24 07:05:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar @RepsForBiden Trump is still telling people his same old shit. He can't admit that he is a failure. He was a failure in the beginning and will still be a failure tomorrow. The virus is not going around a curve it is killing people every day and trump is the reason for these killings.
1319773723956809728 2020-10-24 06:52:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @NoahBookbinder @RepsForBiden Maybe trump can pay back some of the money he stole from American taxpayers. His hotel in Ireland was paid a lot for pence and family to stay there. A real sweet deal for trump. He also sent people visiting WH to his hotel then charged top dollar for them.
1319742849970327559 2020-10-24 04:49:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @crampell @RepsForBiden Isn't it strange that trump hurts children and the elderly with no conscience. Tonight he is in fla. holding one of his maskless no social distancing rallys in the Villages. A retirement place where i have relatives. They didn't even vote for trump.
1319741207115894787 2020-10-24 04:43:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @bennettbenn3 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Desantis is trumps puppet. He calls him for instructions. desantis is too stupid to think for himsel.
1319740646895325186 2020-10-24 04:41:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @PositiveChickie @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden And voting desantis out in 2 yrs. He is totally useless.
1319740376966713346 2020-10-24 04:40:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @CathyCJen @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Thanks to the do nothing governor desantis.
1319740158699294720 2020-10-24 04:39:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @ghgrossman1 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Tonight trump is at the Villages trying to kill our elderly relatives. No masks, no social distancing. That pig and #2 desantis think there is nothing wrong with putting these people in jeoperdy. They both need a QAnon party. desantis and trump have been to a few of them in fla
1319737857389580291 2020-10-24 04:29:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @POTUS @SenateGOP A person has to have a soul to begin with. Maybe a sociopath also is minus a soul along with a conscience.
1319737271503982593 2020-10-24 04:27:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You are just listening to that fool desantis. He will tell you what ever you want to hear. Maybe while you are in fla. killing vulnerable elderly people he can drum up a party with your friends QAnon. I saw the parties you and desantis went to. He will be voted out in 2 yrs.
1319736342335676417 2020-10-24 04:23:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom @RepsForBiden Trump is just racking up the bodies all for money. I am so glad i do not have that horrible greed in me.
1319735829707870209 2020-10-24 04:21:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse You are a disgrace to decent God fearing women. There will be a judgment day and you should be very afraid of your part in this pandemic.
1319735271949258752 2020-10-24 04:19:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @IvankaTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Is this another trump paid actor?
1319735021851316224 2020-10-24 04:18:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @POTUS @SenateGOP Actually trump is from Queens. I came from Manhatten and can tell you that trump and his father were not welcome there.
1319734483856330752 2020-10-24 04:16:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Totally destroy our country.
1319734149977198594 2020-10-24 04:15:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Me too!
1319733887644348416 2020-10-24 04:14:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Someone who reads history! The trump klan have no idea about this country or how it came to be. I could tell that trump has a hard time reading when he used to try to read at his little shows on tv.there must be someone in that white house that can read american history to him.
1319731551689674755 2020-10-24 04:04:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis What is wrong with you. Really? Attending a trump rally of elderly(the most vulnerable) no masks no social distancing. I tried to talk my family members out of participating but they said it was just something to do. They didn't even vote for trump.God help you if anyone dies.
1319710871250239491 2020-10-24 02:42:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP trump's coming to fla today and will be putting elderly people in jeopardy.I have family in the Villages and so do others here in Fla. I tried to talk them out of going to this maskless close encounter but they said it's something to do They can't stand trump. Keep them safe Lord
1319708298212507648 2020-10-24 02:32:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Trump is just an ignorant asshole
1319707572568469510 2020-10-24 02:29:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WesleyLowery @bivens_e I knew it was going on by these racists group but trump started defending them from the start so he also knew. The racist bastard.

1319704354677575682 2020-10-24 02:16:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse Are you proud of the fact that your father is putting the most vulnerable in the population at risk today by holding a rally with no face masks or social distancing. We here in fla. have family at the Villages. God help us that we don't lose our loved ones because of trump.
1319702867566100481 2020-10-24 02:10:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @therecount You sound very presidential  What other nasty names do you have for people. You must think you are something else. You are but not the way you think. You are an embarrassment to our country.  many people are ashamed that they voted for you. And yes VP Biden can do better than you

1319667844641099776 2020-10-23 23:51:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are wrong it is a sad day for America. You didn't care what RBG said while she was dying. She knew what your crooked ass would do. The remarkable thing is you don't care about the right or wrong about issues you just want to beat the democrats with an inexperienced judge.
1319666690259636232 2020-10-23 23:47:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I wondered how long it would take you to bitch about Kristen Welker. You really have a problem with strong women because they don't cowar down to your BS. I wonder do you have a lot of mommy issues?
1319665669584134145 2020-10-23 23:43:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @nypost Biden, biden, biden Laptop, laptop, laptop Russia, russia, russia trump is a broken record.  He needs to find a new tune, his constant whining is so boring.

He does not give a damn about Floridians. We have to remember his actions during this pandemic and vote him out of office in 2 yrs. He has no business holding any office since he has to be told what to do.

Worse yet why didn't you try to stop trump? If I were you I would not let my children around him not just because he callously throws those children away, but just the disgusting person he is
1319606047976423424 2020-10-23 19:46:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Trump was pushing so hard for those boys to be executed. If they were down south I think trump would have called white supremacists and kkk to hang them all.

Talk about how you are going to help Americans through this pandemic. How you are going to fix the economy. No one wants to hear about Hunter Biden.

1319025078508675075 2020-10-22 05:17:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I suspect trump is what happened to him. He was inspiration during 9/11/01. He was out in the trenches with everyone else. I was working in a hospital close to the scene and saw him upset a few times over the devastation. His actions since hanging out with trump is disappointing
1318986750451159040 2020-10-22 02:45:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump More lies. What more can we expect from a man who tore children away from their parents and now can not find those parents. Anyone with a child is horrified by a president who can do this without a conscience.  That president is trump.
1318979571912478723 2020-10-22 02:16:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @HillaryClinton I have nightmares over this. I can hear those children crying for their parents. I particularly hear the little girl crying for her daddy. What kind of person causes this kind of pain and feels nothing? A sociopathic president.
1318976306076372993 2020-10-22 02:03:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump When did he decide to do this? When he finds out he is slipping in the poles. So desperate.

1318967598441259011 2020-10-22 01:29:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Psychopath or Sociopath. I am not sure which one trump is. He emits signs of both.

1318904679003193345 2020-10-21 21:19:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump lies get bigger each day. He should be concentrating on how to keep himself out of jail. He is guilty of crimes against nature, crimes against the American people and so many other crimes. He can't lie his way out of this

The parents of 545 children that trump had separated from them can not be found. They think they must have been deported without their children. What kind of MONSTER does this?
1318689528027222017 2020-10-21 07:04:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @atrupar Enough to put him in jail?

1318290688077856770 2020-10-20 04:39:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I went to vote in Fla. today and it was like a Bidenfest. I never saw so many people voting 15 days before election day. Everyone was wearing a mask and all were very happy to be voting. I did not ask anyone but i do believe we were all voting for Biden/Harris.

1318277569284800513 2020-10-20 03:47:19 +0800 <dmhossley> Fox News should be taken off the air for horrible reporting of disgusting allegations about Hunter Biden. This is so damaging to the Republican party. If Democrats made such allegations about trump there would be hell to pay. if people wanted to start a smearfest trump would win.

1318270375348797441 2020-10-20 03:18:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @KellyO trump is so jealous of Dr. Fauci because he is so much smarter and is so respected by American people and trump is an ass and no one respects him or his ridiculous antics

1318009177328013313 2020-10-19 10:00:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @gelles @bivens_e Wow, this is my laugh of the week. trump is such an idiot. He does not have the slightest understanding of kindness, loving, understanding and virtuous.
1318007729949167617 2020-10-19 09:55:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You mean thousands are now dead. They are not home.
1318007485584805889 2020-10-19 09:54:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden An idiotic fool.
1318007287945007106 2020-10-19 09:53:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e I wonder how the "stable genius" feels about being  described as having the "attention span of a fruit fly"
1318001007427784704 2020-10-19 09:28:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e I am watching. We know what a treasonous bastard trump is. But it hurts my heart to listen to people who obviously love their country tell what they experienced with him. After he is voted out of office he needs to stand trial for his crimes.
1317985337478664193 2020-10-19 08:26:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e The New Yorker in me would punch him or her right in the mouth. Then if it were a man, i'd kick him in the gonads.
1317984526321188864 2020-10-19 08:22:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP What a fool little funny looking fat orange man is. Are his hands SHRINKING? They look like it to me. trump, guiliani, barr had better take care not to contract the virus as they are all obese
1317959109816258560 2020-10-19 06:41:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Of course, they all know they can't win honestly. The Russians helped the last time and are trying again.

1317957370207784965 2020-10-19 06:34:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @clairecmc trump has a drug problem himself so how would he help his son? Adderall VP Biden s a good decent and lovng Dad
1317955909411311617 2020-10-19 06:29:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @Amy_Siskind Exactly why he is so desperate to win. He will lie cheat and steal to stay out of jail. That goes for the whole trump klan. They are all broke so won't be able to put commissary money in for him.
1317954559214571520 2020-10-19 06:23:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Fox should be shut down. It is not Fox news it is Fox lies.

1317936857301266433 2020-10-19 05:13:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @yashar Oh please what bullshit this is.
1317936523648663552 2020-10-19 05:12:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRealHoarse This is true, but we can't change what we are. I see the meanness of the trump klan and wonder how they can be that way. How does a man who calls himself President of the USA say and do some of the spiteful things he does. I have never thought of him or called him my President.
1317934757364355072 2020-10-19 05:05:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch That explains everything! I watched her on CNN this morning. She is just as much a liar as the rest of the trumps.
1317933739830333443 2020-10-19 05:01:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump California is a democratic state. What changed your mind about helping them with tax payer money? You stated plainly that you will not help any state but republicans.
1317925578004189184 2020-10-19 04:28:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump trump is getting more and more desperate. Desperate people do desperate things.

1317857101587374080 2020-10-18 23:56:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @thehowie I wonder whats on trumps laptop. I can just imagine.
1317856037001744384 2020-10-18 23:52:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @SRuhle More trump fake news.
1317855142595694593 2020-10-18 23:48:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidCornDC What a sick SOB. Does trump have one of those mirrors? Mirror, mirror on the wall
1317854555191783425 2020-10-18 23:46:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @ScottMStedman The American people do.
1317854201142181896 2020-10-18 23:45:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RobertMaguire_ @RepsForBiden I thought trump was broke. Where did he get the $27 million? Did the American people pay? like we have paid for all the bills the trump klan has run up.
1317852586024837122 2020-10-18 23:38:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep When trump loses Gov. Whitmer should sue him for a whole range of damage he has done to her.
1317851984624558082 2020-10-18 23:36:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump said months ago that he should be in power for at least 12 more years. Thats when i realized he is looking to be dictator. No one has ever questioned elections like him before.
1317851257516732417 2020-10-18 23:33:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Are you still on this nonsense?  More tests more cases. Thats right we would not know we had these cases if we didn't have tests. Which you are purposely limiting so citizens cant get one.
1317821783362408448 2020-10-18 21:36:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @kirstiealley @tcspeaks @realDonaldTrump Here you have it kirstie alley. You are shameful. At least half your fans are Biden supporters so do yourself a favor and keep your mouth shut. If you said you were voting for Biden trump would be blasting you with "she is a no talent lousy actress"  and maybe he would be right!
1317819835015962624 2020-10-18 21:28:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 trump came a few times and now Florida is a red state on the map with over 50% increase in cases. Everywhere he goes he brings death and destruction.
1317818720102895617 2020-10-18 21:24:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump is the most corrupt politician America has ever had even richard nixon paled next to trump and his whole klan is a criminal enterprise. And crooked guiliani is a russian spy.
1317620706558021632 2020-10-18 08:17:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @stuartpstevens @bivens_e It is really pathetic that trump needs to have large crowds around him. It really must be terrible to be so insecure. No one would care but he is putting peoples lives in danger and doesn't seem to care.
1317618727748251651 2020-10-18 08:09:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @neal_katyal @bivens_e He knows that he will not have the protection of the presidency and will be "locked up" for all his crimes.
1317598553754259457 2020-10-18 06:49:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @JohnKasich @Used_To_Be_GOP The Republican party has become a very mean spirited party. The people say some outrages things encouraged by trump. It has QAnon and White Supremacists, Boogaloo Bois and Proud Boys etc. I don't recognize the Republican Party anymore.
1317596425535016966 2020-10-18 06:40:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Where is your health insurance plan?  We have been waiting for 4 years and nothing.
1317595508697927680 2020-10-18 06:37:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump and klan are corrupt.
1317593989634232320 2020-10-18 06:31:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Where is your health plan?
1317589978801721344 2020-10-18 06:15:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump How much is trumps rallies costing the American people. He uses Air Force One to travel all over. Are we paying for the gas and maintenance and personnel? I would think his campaign would be made to pay these expenses.
1317468311999873024 2020-10-17 22:11:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @Rschooley @bivens_e Putin will reward trump for his loyalty by sending him to Siberia.
1317454368392830977 2020-10-17 21:16:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden desantis has been preparing himself to do a whole lot of ass kissing. Funny but he can't be found when the people need him to be a governor but he's at all trumps rallys in Florida.
1317321572307394560 2020-10-17 12:28:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @mkraju Or better yet i would have Antifa visit him. Or would they scare trump too much.
1317315306637959169 2020-10-17 12:03:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I have been voting absentee ballot in Florida for years and because I have not trusted the USPS i have used the drop box near me. Today the republican secretary of state wants these drop boxes removed. This is blatant voter suppression. If trump wins it will be illegitimate.
1317312850822635521 2020-10-17 11:53:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @mkraju I only wish trump would be visited by a real organized crime family.
1317310427311841281 2020-10-17 11:44:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProjectLincoln Putin will take his puppet in.
1317310095114539008 2020-10-17 11:42:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Everything trump promised is total bull shit. Where is his supposed health plan  protect SS didn't he stop the paycheck tax? Defend us against the virus? We have been rounding the corner on the virus for 8 mos but have 218,000 dead family members and counting
1317308197397516288 2020-10-17 11:35:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Actually we now know why trump was really here. The republican secretary of state wants to remove the drop boxes so it will be harder for Floridians to vote. I will never believe that trump and desantis are not behind this. trump did the same with the republican gov of texas.
1317305055033294849 2020-10-17 11:22:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @mjs_DC @bivens_e @Slate Strange but this happened today while trump was here in florida. desantis was with trump. So those two sharp minds got together with the republican secretary of state and cooked up this scheme. I am sure trump was in on the bs in texas too.
1317251223452602370 2020-10-17 07:48:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This is such a despicable thing for that orange monster to say. He caused the death of our loved ones and the horror of it will be on him for the rest of his life. And when trump meets his maker he will have a hell of a lot of explaining to do.
1317248500053217280 2020-10-17 07:38:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Are you kidding? It looks tacky. But no one expects more from trump &amp; klan

1317243773722742789 2020-10-17 07:19:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @mjs_DC @bivens_e @Slate . I will to take my ballot to the drop box monday. If it is not there I will go immediately to the supervisor of elections and raise hell.that crap about if trump doesn't win it will be rigged. The republicans are interfering in our elections. This will damage the republicans.

1317236001509605376 2020-10-17 06:48:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I saw an article in a fla. newspaper that had trump and desantis at a party with people wearing QAnon shirts on. trump and desantis looked quite chummy with them.
1317234677690863621 2020-10-17 06:43:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @subaru_usa Actually underdogs adopted me and saved my life.

1317230593021804547 2020-10-17 06:27:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You should tell trump that fighting drug abuse starts at home.
1317229956242591744 2020-10-17 06:24:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e We are all aware of the contempt trump &amp; klan has for the military. Not one of them has served their country. All they have done is live off the American people, but fight for them? Hell no.
1317227478537129987 2020-10-17 06:14:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Where did melania come from.Maybe trump should send her and her parents back where they came from. Why are they any better than anyone else. According to trump anyone not born here don't belong here.
1317226456058109954 2020-10-17 06:10:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump No you won't. No you won't. No you won't. Do something with that asshole guiliani. Talk about someone demented. He also cannot go back to New York. So don't try to send him there.  You and melania should take care of him. you all have to get out in Jan.don't leave him in DC
1317224995630862336 2020-10-17 06:04:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I will not be able to hold myself back. I will tweet my condolences to trump and again advise him to seek a  mental health professional.
1317207876310605825 2020-10-17 04:56:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @DAMasiello trump is so evil. What president says he will only help one party and not another? He has said repeatedly that he will not do anything for democratic states.

Contrary to trump who is trying to kill us all. trump has lied an stolen from the American people long enough.
1317204988674924550 2020-10-17 04:45:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Thats right trump give all the senior citizens in Fla. the virus. Why don't you hang out with desantes and give it to him. He is useless as a governor.
1317204253228883969 2020-10-17 04:42:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @wmaye84 @bivens_e You are so right.
1317204017303400448 2020-10-17 04:41:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS You really have some nerve calling anyone self serving. That is all trump and klan has done since moving into The Peoples House. And that is what you are living in because of the goodness of the American people. You DO NOT own it and will be out come Jan.Start packing your things
1317203110692007937 2020-10-17 04:37:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Orange face
1317202980379176963 2020-10-17 04:37:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Everything that QAnon claims is what VP Biden and democrats do are actually what trump does. He is so despicable. He leads that pedophilia and satanic ring if there is one.
1317202076225703936 2020-10-17 04:33:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You really don't think seniors are that stupid do you?  Leave Social Security and Medicare alone or there will be a very angry group of seniors in Washington.
1316934244963418113 2020-10-16 10:49:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse She has 3 yrs experience as a judge. That is not nearly enough experience. Trump is pushing to get her in because she and Kavanaugh will vote according to what trump wants. That is why they are there.
1316933488701067269 2020-10-16 10:46:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 @bivens_e They are all clapping.!!!! Good for you Iowa.
1316851473142239233 2020-10-16 05:20:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump By the way you certainly do not miss any meals. You have really gotten FAT since entering the White House  I guess it's all the wonderful food the chef makes. Then you add McDonalds burgers and cokes. You have the audacity to keep money from Americans when it is their money.
1316849533666684928 2020-10-16 05:12:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are so full of shit  McConnell has said he will not approve your stimulus.I guess HE is in charge not you. Leave Dr. Fauci alone.He IS A REAL GENIUS. !!!!! Dr. Fauci, unlike you, cares what happens to Americans.  you and your thieving klan want as much money as you can steal
1316510805282742272 2020-10-15 06:46:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I just wanted you to know that I am a suburban woman and I DO NOT like you. I also am not voting for you. I am not voting for any Republican this time around and that is because of you. Also all of the suburban women I know DO NOT like you and are not voting for you.
1316506753866006530 2020-10-15 06:30:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @MiaFarrow I heard the Gov. of Iowa wishes trump will not come there with all his disease ridden entourage.
1316499535187845121 2020-10-15 06:02:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump What in hell is this lasted trump conspiracy theory? Bin Laden was not killed the body was a double  This from your good friends at QAnon. You have to be the craziest bastard In this country and maybe the world.
1316497515047510016 2020-10-15 05:54:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump John Brennan just said donald trump is a deeply disturbed individual.  I agree with him wholeheartedly.
1315998766017777664 2020-10-13 20:52:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZackCz Wow trump must have gotten a new supply of Adderall
1315838121322446850 2020-10-13 10:13:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Desantis can't be bothered to do his job in Florida but has time for this stupidity. I was sick of the man months ago. He never should have opened this state because now the cases and deaths are going up. Desantis does whatever trump tells him but we pay his salary.
1315782228740370432 2020-10-13 06:31:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @AlexSJerome @RVAT2020 @ProjectLincoln @BidenReps I think of it as I am not voting Republican or Democrat I am voting American. That means voting Biden/Harris.
1315779735704739840 2020-10-13 06:21:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @peterbakernyt @RepsForBiden Is trump confused or am i?
1315779478124146688 2020-10-13 06:20:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse More lies and encouraging people to be reckless with their health. We need truth not a damned pathological liar. This is the second time in my years of voting that there is a mentality unstable, sociopath running for president. The first time was 2016.
1315770128756355072 2020-10-13 05:43:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump All thats going down in history is what a failure trump is and how he destroyed the Republican party. It is going to take a long time to recover. All for.a selfish lunatic Who cares only for himself. He doesn't fool everyone. He did in 2016 but not know.
1315768213418979329 2020-10-13 05:36:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @Vets4Biden @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden @TeamJoe trump never served in the military . trump was a draft dodger during the viet nam war. I understand no one in his family served. His supposed bone spurs don't seem to stop him from playing golf.
1315766550692012034 2020-10-13 05:29:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 You don't have any health care plan any more than you had covid19. The people that i know who survived the virus were very sick for awhile. And you saying they had to tuff it out be strong is the most asinine thing you have said.
1315764651532210179 2020-10-13 05:21:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @dougmillsnyt @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump I am so sad that people here in fla. are at his rallys.These are the people who are infecting the rest of us.They believe trump that they don't have to wear masks or social. distance. So they are putting all the rest of us in jeopardy. Why would decent people put others in danger
1315763441278300161 2020-10-13 05:17:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Yes. She must know that is the only reason trump nominated her. It certainly is not her experience on the bench.
1315752689414950913 2020-10-13 04:34:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 Where is it trump. You know you don't have one liar.
1315752514478845954 2020-10-13 04:33:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @lalahhathaway trump is going to hell. Vote Biden/Harris
1315752259452637184 2020-10-13 04:32:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @MCmuckraker Is every one in Washington crooked? They are trying to be like trump.
1315751758854074368 2020-10-13 04:30:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e @googlenews trump has convinced his base that they have to make sure he wins by cheating. If they ate caught they need to go to jail
1315751261568995328 2020-10-13 04:28:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump should be arrested and convicted of murder. He keeps having these reckless rallys. Convincing these poor people that if they are strong they won't get the virus and if they do they will get over it easily like he did. He is a POS saying 215,000 dead Americans are to blame.
1315748567017979904 2020-10-13 04:17:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump is a complete ass
1315748319747092486 2020-10-13 04:16:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Hr says nothing worth listening to. The evil ass.
1315747982445342720 2020-10-13 04:15:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are such an evil bastard. You are trying to blame people for getting sick and not being strong and overcoming it. I am questioning whether you ever had covis19  You are a showman so you are very able to convince people of something that is not and i would not put it past you.
1315742591921651712 2020-10-13 03:54:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @JasonMillerinDC He is wasting his money as Seniors made up their mind and are rejecting the liar and cheat. Vote for Biden/Harris
1315712118545698816 2020-10-13 01:53:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Was he better at lying than you? Don't talk about military service when you are a draft dodger. My family fought for this country since the 1700's. No one tried to get out of it. It was patriotic to protect the nation they loved. Every single generation served. You didn't.
1315710626153594880 2020-10-13 01:47:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenTedCruz @WhiteHouse Of course you are and how much is trump paying you to say that?
1315710294887485441 2020-10-13 01:45:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump He is evil.
1315710157402386432 2020-10-13 01:45:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump is an evil bastard. He does not care about the people he is supposed to be leading. 215,000 dead and no one knows how many people are on the edge of starvation.
1315709351710150658 2020-10-13 01:42:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You can't keep promising and never delivering.
1315708756047605761 2020-10-13 01:39:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @Fahrenthold @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump trump and klan have been doing this for awhile.
1315708223316467713 2020-10-13 01:37:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Do you think anyone believes your lies anymore. You have been promising heath care for months and months. So it looks like you are going to take ACA from people and give them nothing in return. No one should be surprised. That has been your presidency promises and no acton.
1315661756992229376 2020-10-12 22:33:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e If this is how the Republican mind works. No wonder people are leaving the party in record numbers.
1315660907129835520 2020-10-12 22:29:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Fair doesn't seem to be in the Republican vocabulary any more. What happened to them?
1315659423877128192 2020-10-12 22:23:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @ForecasterEnten @RepsForBiden This no time to be complacent. Everyone needs to vote!
1315659134809837569 2020-10-12 22:22:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @RepsForBiden Maybe putin will take him in to be his little bitch.
1315658497984471042 2020-10-12 22:20:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump is going to hell in a handbasket. Vote Biden
1315658280220463106 2020-10-12 22:19:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol @RepsForBiden donald trump has going to hell in a handbasket. Vote Biden
1315472781979648000 2020-10-12 10:02:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I really hope someone goes after the  trump boys for killing that leopard. I personally am forwarding that picture and requesting something be done about them to the World Wildlife Org.
1315470880236072960 2020-10-12 09:54:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse More trump lies and if anyone believes him anymore after all the lies they should maybe see a professional and be deprogramed.
1315468278052118529 2020-10-12 09:44:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You really can't help lying can you trump.  i remember all the nasty things you said about him. You only cut that piece of film to put on you ad because you know people trust Dr. Fauci not you. Take it down it just shows your lying stupid self. You have nothing you can brag about
1315465773591203841 2020-10-12 09:34:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Trump should be watching How the World Sees America on  https://t.co/FuaTnwrX1v is an eye opener.I just pray that President Biden can reach out to world leaders and fix the damage trump has done. They do know him and I believe respect him not trump.
1315439636689358849 2020-10-12 07:50:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @MaryLTrump @bivens_e I agree.
1315439342609993729 2020-10-12 07:49:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden This is what compassion and empathy sounds like. Thank you VP Biden
1315438348673200133 2020-10-12 07:45:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trumpers might try to hurt you. I am not trying to be funny. I have come across angry trumpers saying very nasty things to me because i do and will continue to wear a mask but I am much more aware of my surroundings now.
1315437019301122053 2020-10-12 07:39:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse Wrong  She is not experienced enough. She should not cut her teeth on the highest court in the land. Kavanaugh was pushed through when so many Republicans and Democrats were against it.  Another example that Government doesn't give a damn about what the people want.

They are liars and cheaters
1315428437188907008 2020-10-12 07:05:53 +0800 <dmhossley> I really wish trump would shut his stupid mouth for one day! He is such an exhausting ASS

1315427244697935872 2020-10-12 07:01:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @discardedgum @bivens_e Absolutely true!!!
1315426276098879491 2020-10-12 06:57:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Dr. Fauci says he has never endorsed a political candidate and I respect him for that. Science is what he is all about.
1315425308812640256 2020-10-12 06:53:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @CREWcrew @bivens_e I am not surprised. The trump klan has been ripping off the American people from the beginning.  VOTE HIM OUT.
1315424433457246210 2020-10-12 06:49:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @kimara2627 @bivens_e Here is some advise.STAY AWAY that whole place is full of covid germs as well as everyone there.
1315423482029772807 2020-10-12 06:46:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Take the ad down that features Dr. Fouci!!!!!  How could you be such a lying ass especially when you said some not so nice things about Dr. Fauci. You need to watch CNN tonight at 9:00pm you can see what the world and so many Americans feel about you
1315422243560841216 2020-10-12 06:41:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @ATC01204068 @Reuters It was so ridiculous that trump thought he should get the Nobel Prize. He also thinks his likeness should be on Mt. Rushmore. I could tell him where his likeness should be and what prize he should get. What a buffoon.
1315420693807476739 2020-10-12 06:35:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @KatiePhang @bivens_e This is just how the disparate the trump klan is. They must be forced to take the ad down.
1315403488000696323 2020-10-12 05:26:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RsAndIs4Biden @realDonaldTrump Vote trump out
1315402892329840644 2020-10-12 05:24:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @FLDEO What about the 26,000 people who have not received their un employment. You avoid this subject bur you are supposed to be Gov. of all the people.
1315402281492283393 2020-10-12 05:21:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis Florida is now at 10% positivity rate. trump should not be allowed to further infect vulnerable citizen s. desantis should not have opened this state up . That was a mistake now we have to do whatever we have to stay alive. trump must stay away. Hasn't Florida been through enough
1315399124427116545 2020-10-12 05:09:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @thefalconette @tcspeaks I am and I also wear a mask when I go to the store. Why? Because I want to stay alive.
1315394896585535489 2020-10-12 04:52:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I can't wait to watch Jackie Kennedy's story tonight on CNN at 10:00 pm. Jackie was one of our most  beloved First Ladies. She had intelligence and grace. The White House was so beautiful when she took care of it.
1315390224692924416 2020-10-12 04:34:02 +0800 <dmhossley> We need to through Lindsey Graham out on his lying ass.
1315389757929730049 2020-10-12 04:32:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Well I won't be taking them at warp speed. You know where you can shove them.
1315389525506564101 2020-10-12 04:31:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden We know that. He cannot reside in the White House any more. He is just there to take and take. He never cared about us.
1315388777116962816 2020-10-12 04:28:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @NNVP_Lizer @WhiteHouse Trump still trying to buy votes. We are on to you trump
1315387855749906443 2020-10-12 04:24:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse So you can infect the American people? No thanks that White House needs to be fumigated because of your germs.
1315387282413813769 2020-10-12 04:22:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar Why is no one checking out his mind because he is definitely loony tunes. We should not have a man in the White House who is so far removed from reality. He is a danger to every American
1315386385533198336 2020-10-12 04:18:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @HomeDabrave @atrupar Yes he does because he is a racist bigot.
1315386174157004801 2020-10-12 04:17:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar trump should stop comparing himself to President Lincoln. He does not have a single quality of Lincolns and never will. trumps tells himself this crap then believes his own lies.
1315385182405513217 2020-10-12 04:14:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer I firmly believe she is not qualified to have a seat on the Supreme Court. She needs more experience. The Republicans don't care about experience they know she will vote their way
1315384399643451392 2020-10-12 04:10:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @politvidchannel Just as long as it's not you teddy
1315383852764925952 2020-10-12 04:08:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @KellyO @bivens_e @NBCNews Dr. Fauci should demand they remove that ad. Who fo these trump people think they are? They just prove over and over trump &amp; klan are liars and cheaters. Trump now has the audacity to say he wants the debate back on with Biden. I am sorry but you don't get to do that.
1315367828636266499 2020-10-12 03:05:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden We should be outraged by trumps remarks and especially anyone who has lost someone. We can't let ourselves become complacent. Every death is a tragedy.
1315366338400063488 2020-10-12 02:59:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e He also brings up Pres. Obama as well as Hillary. Maybe the virus has gone to his brain.
1315365166251470848 2020-10-12 02:54:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @nypost He's confused. He means the Republicans will continue to pull shenanigans and Americans are sick of it.
1315364162101542912 2020-10-12 02:50:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 Pathological liar?
1315083869570433030 2020-10-11 08:16:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @PimlicoBandit @bivens_e @midclassmoderat I  believe that is how our country was before trump. We will be saying for years before trump and after trump. He has really torn this country apart. Somehow he has convinced Republicans it is ok to lie and cheat to get your own way.
1315081779263537160 2020-10-11 08:08:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @PressSec @WhiteHouse I don't believe any of this. She does not belong in the Supreme Court. The court makes such important decisions and she does not have the experience and she can not separate church and state. These are just some reasons she should not be voted in.
1315079706253971458 2020-10-11 08:00:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @bivens_e People should not buy pedigree dogs. Years ago I went to a store called Puppy Palace and purchased a Cocker Spaniel. She had so many problems. I asked the Vet why she was like this and he said she came from a puppy mill and would never be normal. Now I will only get rescue dogs.
1315077669986410496 2020-10-11 07:52:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol @bivens_e People that I know at the Villages are determined that they will be voting for Biden. The reason they tell me: they think he is vulgar and not honest.
1315064714779652097 2020-10-11 07:00:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @FloridaChiefs I have news for you. There are so many women and elderly in Florida that are sick of the trump show. They have been telling me that they are voting for Biden. I know quite a few in the villages. Did you see the long line of gulf carts with Biden.
1315063689909809158 2020-10-11 06:56:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @ABC13News @realDonaldTrump This is all intended to suppress our vote. The only way something will happen to our votes is trump having people. trump has always been known in business as a cheater and liar. I have been voting by mail for yrs and this is the only time there has been a question. Coincidence?
1315062485838430208 2020-10-11 06:51:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @ABC13News @realDonaldTrump Trump has put his crazy people up to doing this. He knows that without cheating he will never win.  The decent people want their country back.trump had 4 yrs and look what he has done to the heart of America.
1315061939001794560 2020-10-11 06:49:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @WTKR3 @realDonaldTrump And he got caught. I understand he is Republican
1315061278625476609 2020-10-11 06:46:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @maemart08974056 @WTKR3 @realDonaldTrump At any other election I would agree but trump is encouraging his supporters to go to the polls for one reason only to try to get voters to vote for trump. He is so despicable. We never had a president do this and I pray when trump is out we will never have a president do it again
1315060079218094081 2020-10-11 06:42:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump October 10, 2020 Covid19 stats USA     7,706,286                    Total cases     214,286                        Total deaths  ???total soldiers killed by putins bounty  The blood of these people are on trumps hands.

1314998469334102016 2020-10-11 02:37:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @FrancoRipple @TeamJoe @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @BidenForFL @FlaDems Can we really get the White House back to what it was before Loser trump I have been watching films about many of our wonderful presidents and I see men who became president because they wanted protect our democracy. That is not trump he has selfish reasons

1314996329769205761 2020-10-11 02:28:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @LeslieProll @tcspeaks There is just no way this woman should get a life time appointment to Supreme Court. She and Kavanaugh will not vote fairly  I worry for the future of the young people today. I along with thousands of young women fought hard to get civil rights and women's rights into law.
1314994175264337920 2020-10-11 02:20:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for decency and truth.  Biden/Harris 2020  Vote vote vote
1314993515257102337 2020-10-11 02:17:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why does trump think that white women in the suburbs are stupid? He thinks paying a few hundred black people to show up at the White House to listen to his ridiculous rhetoric will fool us. Doesn't he try to scare white women that they are going to be raped by men of color.
1314967098200936448 2020-10-11 00:32:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @ida_skibenes When you find out, please tell the rest of us.
1314887541099843585 2020-10-10 19:16:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @clairecmc I thought campaigning at the White House was not allowed. How does trump keep doing things that are are against the law or frowned upon.?

1314780707030478848 2020-10-10 12:12:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @mercedesschlapp @JoeBiden Why in hell are you blaming Biden? Trump said he'd go then he wouldn't. Grown ups don't play those games.

1314773856524079104 2020-10-10 11:44:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @TimMurtaugh First of all trump said he would not participate and second I am sick of listening to the insane maniac ridiculous psychopath. And what the hell is this shit about VP Biden killing a baby after it's born  sounds like QAnon crap. Are they the only ones who will talk to you anymore
1314770964996030465 2020-10-10 11:33:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RetireB4IDie I will take Halloween any day over trump

1314690486205124608 2020-10-10 06:13:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @seungminkim @bivens_e There are still 26,000 people in Florida who have never received their unemployment check. But the system has continued to post large amt. of interest. desantis has a responsibility to the people. What in hell did he think being governor was playing golf at trumps country club

1314685105559011329 2020-10-10 05:52:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Because he has something to hide.
1314684148133621761 2020-10-10 05:48:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @seungminkim @bivens_e He should stay away from Florida. Our cases and deaths are rising since the Governor opened up the state and said people can't be fined for not wearing masks. trump will only make a bad situation worse.
1314683010755760129 2020-10-10 05:43:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @Local4News trump wants to hold on to the presidency and he will do it any way he can. He made the statement that he should stay for 10 to 12 years at least. He talks to putin on a regular bases and will not say anything against him like White Supremacists. Its not hard to put 2&amp;2 together.
1314681940939689984 2020-10-10 05:39:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @PeteButtigieg No one knows and the ones who should know are not talking.

One is the Governor of Florida. He is playing russian roulette with our lives. He completely opened the state and now our numbers are rising. He is irresponsible.
1314680349901778945 2020-10-10 05:33:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecAzar @WhiteHouse No thank you. Why would I have a vaccine injected in me when trump has made vaccines a political statement. I feel that is what this message is. For the first time in my life i do not trust the Government.
1314679293063106563 2020-10-10 05:29:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mimirocah1 @bivens_e The Michigan Sheriff should immediately be removed from office. His words are not only endangering the Governor but other people. How could someone who is supposed to keep the citizens safe be so reckless.
1314671127768322049 2020-10-10 04:56:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis This Gov. of Florida has put all our lives in danger and like trump he doesn't care.. I knew when he opened up the state while there were still cases cropping that this was not going to be good. And here we are. There are going to be many deaths on his hands.
1314663281710297093 2020-10-10 04:25:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @SamuelLJackson @TeamJoe @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris The Republicans are allowing trump to go on with his insanity. they don't understand this all reflects back on them. When Nixon was told to resign he did  for the sake of the country. Now there are threats by left wing wackos to the security of our country. trump encourages this.

1314655331838984193 2020-10-10 03:53:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheFrankOzJam @tcspeaks You are right. trump is hurting this country. The Republicans are enabling him. trump has become very dangerous. What is he doing alone in the oval office? Is he talking to putin? Putin just loves what trump is doing to the USA.
1314654025766391810 2020-10-10 03:48:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Billysthought @tcspeaks I disagree. I believe she will be re elected. We never had such wonderful president. Imagine if donald j trump was president what a mess we would have
1314653225572859906 2020-10-10 03:45:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump you'r in no condition to be president. You are erratic. You can't make up your mind which means you are confused. You need to leave now and stop hurting America. All over the world they know how crazy you are. We know you don't care what you do to the people but the country
1314651581275688965 2020-10-10 03:38:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump i don't understand why you don't follow another Law&amp;Order president nixon and leave Republican senators told nixon to leave on his own or they will make him. Nixon, not wanting to do more damage to the country he resigned. If you really love this country you will go.

1314424854209343488 2020-10-09 12:38:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @LittleKish @realDonaldTrump You should contact someone at QAnon. They believe that kind of shit too.

1314413688913367041 2020-10-09 11:53:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump Did trump write this. Sounds like him.
1314413480716439560 2020-10-09 11:52:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The thing with President Biden is that he will sit down and listen to you. He will not ridicule you. Biden probably is a stable genius but he'd never say it.
1314412353715404801 2020-10-09 11:48:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden We need to kick trumps ass out in the street

1314410766855008259 2020-10-09 11:42:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden No there is no other option. I am afraid trump has destroyed the Republican party maybe beyond repair. It does not even slightly resemble the Republican party i knew.
1314409682946191361 2020-10-09 11:37:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @gretchenwhitmer @RepsForBiden Mr. President. I have just read every one of these crazy insane ravings of yours. Really now you need to get some serious help.  Your going down hill fast. Get help before it's too late.
1314408260926148610 2020-10-09 11:32:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @CREWcrew @tcspeaks Because trump lets him. Why are all those people living in the white house?

Someone could have talked to trump before he totally lost it. I just heard himon a call to fox news. It was unbelievable. And then the horrible things he said about Sen harris and Mich Gov
1314389793757966336 2020-10-09 10:18:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @SpiroAgnewGhost Did you read that psych ward for you trump.

1314387601156177920 2020-10-09 10:09:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How can you say such vile things about a woman who was almost kidnapped.   STAY THE HELL OUT OF FLORIDA WITH YOUR COOTIES.  We don't want to catch your germs  Stay away.
1314385667871445005 2020-10-09 10:02:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidmweissman Sorry, but this makes me think about the old adage that men are not as smart as women. I didn't say that
1314385151040917504 2020-10-09 10:00:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Susan_Hennessey @bivens_e She will be there for a lifetime doesn't anyone think this is too important to rush through? For God's sake if she is so good waiting a little won't hurt her. I really felt Kavanaugh was rushed by trump and he really never belonged as a SS justice. Is morals stink.
1314383716521783296 2020-10-09 09:54:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Last I heard he was in the hospital. He has a few health problems beside positive for covid.

1314381062697627648 2020-10-09 09:44:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @marcorubio Don't trust Rubio. A few months ago when he thought trump was going win another 4 yrs he was saying not so nice stuff about VP Biden. Now he sees the writing on the wall he has switched allegiance.
1314379831493222403 2020-10-09 09:39:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer They should tear down that tacky, poorly decorated bldg. If you have ever been inside you know how ugly it is. I have a feeling it is very poorly built too knowing how trump cut corners. He could care less about peoples safety. The sociopath.
1314378189926477829 2020-10-09 09:32:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are all mouth and no action.. These people who plotted to kidnap the Gov.of Mich.were doing your dirty work but they are GOING to do the TIME How long do you think these idiots are going to do this for you? You are such a little man who is a coward.
1314359165456986112 2020-10-09 08:16:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @PeteButtigieg @bivens_e Not any more. We were before trump
1314358668398391297 2020-10-09 08:15:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump Of course not. He was probably in on it.
1314358290730500097 2020-10-09 08:13:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer She has no business on the Supreme Court. Americans fought long and hard for racial equality and Womens rights. She can't be allowed to take that and health care away from us because of her religious beliefs.
1314357432936787969 2020-10-09 08:10:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Hey trump, why don't you go in the BUNKER and shut the hell up you asshole.
1314356833163804672 2020-10-09 08:07:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e He really is a piece of work.

Decent Americans want him out. Remember you have had needs since 2017. He never helped you then
1314353674043482114 2020-10-09 07:55:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Why are you always calling men rapists? Do you know they are because thats what you are? I would imagine you have to rape to have a woman because not one in her right mind would let her touch you. And now that you are broke they won't even hang around for your money.

1314344979620409346 2020-10-09 07:20:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovWhitmer Governor Whitmer. I live in Florida and have followed you in the news. I am so sorry this has happened to you. I noticed you have been talking with Gov.Cuomo. I was born and raised in NYC and know of Gov Cuomo as a very good man he will give you good advise. Lean on him a little.
1314339975740239874 2020-10-09 07:00:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e What an asshole. I find it very suspicious that he is feeling so good so fast. He is either faking having the virus to get sympathy votes or has a monetary interest in the drug company. He did have an interest in the drug company that makes chloroquine
1314336548704448515 2020-10-09 06:47:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder And lock him up.
1314336228209233920 2020-10-09 06:45:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @JamesMelville @bivens_e This is heart breaking and cruel and just deplorable. People who do this, including trumps sons, should be put away forever. If they can do this to animals they can surely do it to people.
1314313581077422080 2020-10-09 05:15:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis Obviously desantis has decided to go down the rabbit hole with trump. Make sure you take all those drugs that he claims cured him of covid
1314311746392387590 2020-10-09 05:08:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Floridians hope not.
1314311486433636353 2020-10-09 05:07:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis What the hell does desantis think he is doing? Is he that far up trumps rectum? How dare him not want to allow people to register.Maybe he had the computers crippled himself  to suppress votes since trump is so far down in the polestrump is bat shit crazy and desantis enables him
1314301622646906894 2020-10-09 04:28:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You can be, but this woman won't. Why else would trump pick her. She has no special talents and is not especially smart.
1314300449911119885 2020-10-09 04:23:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @ODell_Nathaniel Some how, some way he is behind it.
1314299954102521858 2020-10-09 04:21:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP The jackass lives in la la land and i wish he would just stay there
1314299627164913670 2020-10-09 04:20:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding? You really posted this trump? I think maybe your drugged up son did it. Did he get into your Adderall?
1314298813906128898 2020-10-09 04:17:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 @RepsForBiden He needs to spend 30 yrs in a mental institution. He won't be cured but he will be old to be dangerous.
1314298244156010497 2020-10-09 04:14:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @thedailybeast Kick his ass out
1314297844996677642 2020-10-09 04:13:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @EamonJavers @bivens_e Of course he doesn't asshole because he not insane like you.
1314296772269879297 2020-10-09 04:09:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You communist bastard. You think you are going to stage a coup? First of all you are too stupid and second of all the idiots you engage to do your dirty work are too stupid to carry it out and they sing. Why don't you keep your fat ugly orange ass in the bunker
1314285364794843145 2020-10-09 03:23:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @vermontgmg @bivens_e So when have we elevated trump and his cohorts to above the law?
1314284641419964416 2020-10-09 03:20:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Trump is a despicable POS. He should be locked up for crimes against humanity
1314261228567527424 2020-10-09 01:47:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @TomJChicago How much is trump going to get away with. Listening to him the last few months with his hate rhetoric like today calling Kamala Harris a monster and a communist. He could be putting her life in jeopardy. Some of these people who seem to idolize the nut case are very sketchy
1314259185677328388 2020-10-09 01:39:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @factspusher @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Before they showed up at the state capital trump had called for them to "liberate Michigan"
1314245996721975303 2020-10-09 00:47:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @bivens_e It looks more and more like another trump shit show. Are we sure he even had the virus?. No one have SEEN the test results.
1314245131059552258 2020-10-09 00:43:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I have to ask you trump. You say you are 100% after having the virus. Are you sure you really had it or is this another ploy to get sympathy?
1314244383760363520 2020-10-09 00:40:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The attempt to kidnap Gov. Whitmer and take over of Michigan government has been thwarted by FBI. 6 men arrested. Wonder if they will talk. Didn't you talk nasty about her trump?
1314237623653855232 2020-10-09 00:14:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @Kevinliptakcnn Way to go trump, get them all pissed off at you. Its not hard to do just keep talking.
1314236926145236994 2020-10-09 00:11:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @reedgalen What an asshole
1314236277366099968 2020-10-09 00:08:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye @bivens_e White Supremacists are doing trumps bidding
1314236000277794827 2020-10-09 00:07:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Now trumpers are going to try to kidnap trumps enemies. Guess what trump you are not the mafia.
1314235399947067395 2020-10-09 00:05:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @JerasIkehorn @bivens_e Kicking McConnell out will be almost as much fun as kicking trump out. The only thing that would really make it great would be trump giving McConnell the virus
1314233478351814656 2020-10-08 23:57:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You have already lost trump. Pack your bags.
1314231679490416641 2020-10-08 23:50:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Did you rebuild the military with LOSERS &amp; SUCKERS?
1314231103188873221 2020-10-08 23:48:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden No one will ever forget trumps disgusting words about our military. He has no respect for anything.
1314230175564025859 2020-10-08 23:44:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump I believe it is going to take the Republican party a long time to recover from trump.
1314229724252700673 2020-10-08 23:42:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump October 8, 2020 Covid 19 stats USA  7,555,437.      Total cases 212,000.         Total deaths  ???soldiers killed by putins bounty  Is this acceptable to you trump?
1314225902017040394 2020-10-08 23:27:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e No trump can go near dogs.
1314225700912672768 2020-10-08 23:26:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @maggieNYT @bivens_e Not only can a Republican not win in NYC. but the trumps can't show their face there.
1314224600566423556 2020-10-08 23:22:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @JDiamond1 @bivens_e Demagogue trump
1314223816088989699 2020-10-08 23:19:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @bethanyshondark @bivens_e He should have worn a mask.
1314222319062183937 2020-10-08 23:13:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @michaelschweitz @tcspeaks @marcorubio Does anyone disagree that it absolutely should NOT be tRump
1314221741770788870 2020-10-08 23:10:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have yelled and cursed at trump on tv so many times that when my dog hears trumps voice she runs up and growls at him. Good thing trump &amp; klan hate dogs.
1314220975924432898 2020-10-08 23:07:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Finally went complete bat shit nuts. Where are the guys in the white coats? I think trump needs a shock treatment.!
1314220372645027843 2020-10-08 23:05:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e No!!!!
1314220242877452291 2020-10-08 23:04:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden And he just gets crazier. trump is just an insane loser. Where is the straight jacket.
1314218991192363009 2020-10-08 22:59:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump All trump poll watchers should be arrested for interfering in the elections. The only reason he is sending the is to intimidate voters There must be a law against this. If not then there will be because of this. What voters should do if a trumper comes near them is call 911.
1314214054194409473 2020-10-08 22:40:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump There is only one monster in this country and the name is tRump. Jealous bastard.
1314213512550379523 2020-10-08 22:38:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye @bivens_e I remember trump was with President XI Jinping who was telling trump about the camps he was building for Muslims. Trump told XI he was all for it. trump then asked XI to help him win re election. XI turned him down. Thats when trump turned against XI
1314210493972635648 2020-10-08 22:26:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Hey asshole, Biden/Harris don't have a direct line to putin, you do. Who's the communist?
1314209674258837505 2020-10-08 22:22:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Trump is a lying asshole
1314208184748314633 2020-10-08 22:17:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenMikeLee The only one thwarting that is tRump.
1314207371791462405 2020-10-08 22:13:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @HallieJackson I think it's a good idea that trump holds his rallys instead of debate. His base are responsible for themselves like the rest of us. If he infects a them then there will be even less to vote for him.  win win
1314206001764073472 2020-10-08 22:08:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are such a racist ass. I am a white educated suburban woman and my neighborhood is very diverse and thats how i like it.
1314193924131438597 2020-10-08 21:20:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @kaitlancollins @bivens_e Biden said he will go to the town hall. They are considering letting Biden go
1314193397440278528 2020-10-08 21:18:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Did trump find gloves small enough for his little hands?
1314192822854201345 2020-10-08 21:16:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @mcjojam @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump Did trump tell you he accepted Jesus? Do you understand that it is just a prop. He is a showman. Everything he says is a lie. There will be a day of reckoning for him and he won't be able to lie his way out.
1314191823364067331 2020-10-08 21:12:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump newsflash. trump is still insane. There is an added fact that he is also diseased.
1314191021878771713 2020-10-08 21:08:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e trump needs to be taught the art of blending his makeup
1314175319730008064 2020-10-08 20:06:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @danabrams I am so glad. trump is diseased and spreading his germs.
1314174692396347393 2020-10-08 20:03:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness I won't be watching.
1314164530969182208 2020-10-08 19:23:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @bivens_e Sorry trump you lose
1314164268753997824 2020-10-08 19:22:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @BarbraStreisand I really don't think so.
1314163943963848704 2020-10-08 19:21:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @sahilkapur @bivens_e Of course it was ignored because it's not true.
1314163151584325633 2020-10-08 19:18:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @levparnas @RepsForBiden @VP @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden He certainly is a trumper.
1314162802509197312 2020-10-08 19:16:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @EvanMcMullin @RepsForBiden Don't expect a peaceful transition. trump is crazy. Hr is going to try some more BS.
1314162204825055233 2020-10-08 19:14:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e LOL he wishes
1314162048570454016 2020-10-08 19:13:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Kamala was great tonight
1314031376325378048 2020-10-08 10:34:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @BarbraStreisand @bivens_e That is so true
1314031054164983808 2020-10-08 10:33:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @RadioFreeTom She couldn't shut him up.
1314030742272454657 2020-10-08 10:31:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @YangJews @RepsForBiden Thats funny
1314030560612941825 2020-10-08 10:31:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden He does not belong being president
1314029729150914560 2020-10-08 10:27:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @KFILE @bivens_e How dare anyone impose their religious beliefs on me. That is bigotry. Her decisions on the bench have been based on her beliefs. This is America. We are supposed to have religion.
1314028327586467840 2020-10-08 10:22:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Yes

1314025069165805570 2020-10-08 10:09:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I second that your full of shit
1314024561990565890 2020-10-08 10:07:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Most families don't have jobs. But the ones that do have not gotten tax breaks they are not paying social security taxes and will owe them next year
1313991179445338112 2020-10-08 07:54:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @sazzygram3 @tcspeaks They can't read so they don't fact check
1313990369969868800 2020-10-08 07:51:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Democrats, Democrats, Democrats You sound like a broken record. Is that it? Is that the range of your mental ability? Get a hobby
1313980782948560897 2020-10-08 07:13:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus What a piece of shit this man who calls himself president is. What will he do when he leaves DC? What will he play next? He can be the cartoon president.
1313979802400030720 2020-10-08 07:09:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast Thats hilarious coming donny jr who hasn't been straight for at least 4 yrs and probably longer. I guess his upbringing did not include having respect for others.
1313978726892351488 2020-10-08 07:05:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Because he broke
1313977469175824386 2020-10-08 07:00:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @JonLemire @RepsForBiden donald trump you are full of shit. How dare you put false hope in people. You are the cruelest most despicable piece of crap our country has ever seen. The day of reckoning is coming and you are going to have to answer to a higher power.
1313976325783388161 2020-10-08 06:55:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump At least somebody does because the rest of us, or at least me, hates him.
1313975453305237505 2020-10-08 06:52:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @heterodox_lefty @briantylercohen @realDonaldTrump It is funny but what trump puts on doesn't look like bronzer it is too orange. If it is he should change brands. And someone needs to tell him he has a makeup line.
1313974605581877253 2020-10-08 06:48:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @Sadie_day @TrumpNewsPolls @realDonaldTrump It sickens me that mice had to suffer so asshole gets medication
1313973878939680770 2020-10-08 06:45:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump There are some expensive historical items in the white house that i hope are recorded so when asshole and the klan leave they don't steal things which i believe low life's like them are not above doing I can't wait to never have to hear that stupid trumpy name or that silly voice
1313971990731030530 2020-10-08 06:38:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump He has not nor is he a president he is a showman playing a president. This asshole bullshitted people into believing in him. They are sorry now.
1313970943757352973 2020-10-08 06:34:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump I hate you trump for saying this shit. People i know had no access to the medical care you had or meds you had and people waiting on you all day. They died alone in a cold hospital not being able to say good by to their family. You can't even conceive of that kind of feeling.
1313969022434713600 2020-10-08 06:26:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @pheadrick @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump How dare that bastard say the virus is a "gift from God" i never liked trump but after seeing that I truly hate him and I am not a hater I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. I will bet that if you talked to any family members who lost someone  they will feel like me.
1313967758686728192 2020-10-08 06:21:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I despise you so much trump. I lost someone i loved dearly. She was only 52 and suffered terrible before she died. She died all alone. we were told we could not be with her. So your bullshit of how easy this is is just  evil. I can not believe you said it was a gift from God.
1313938856169869312 2020-10-08 04:26:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Trump knows he is the biggest loser of all. That's what all the bravado is about. He needs to convince himself and us that he is a brave man. His dodging the draft when everyone was going to Viet Nam is evidence that trump is the biggest loser. Our soldiers are the brave ones
1313937124941586435 2020-10-08 04:19:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol @RVAT2020 @murphymike I have seen it a few times. I really like it maybe thats because i am a woman.
1313934112756060160 2020-10-08 04:07:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @politvidchannel We can't rest now. Vote vote vote  Do everything you can to help people get out to vote.
1313933541235929089 2020-10-08 04:05:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProjectLincoln Maybe he is hiding in the bunker. He has been known to do that.
1313933228034732034 2020-10-08 04:04:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenDuckworth @realDonaldTrump Looks like you will have to do it until we kick his ass out.
1313932488998359041 2020-10-08 04:01:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Someone needs to stop him and his trumpers from interfering with our elections. He acts like a desperate man who knows he is losing and will do anything to stop it even interfering with our right to vote. Dictator wanna be
1313931759248199680 2020-10-08 03:58:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @KevinRobbins9 @scottlincicome @TheRickWilson When I was watching Marine 1 which was there for a long time my eyes were drawn to the fence. As i looked closer there are 2 maybe 3. Why are they still there? Is trump afraid someone is going to come after him and he  won't be able to get to the bunker?
1313930167212027905 2020-10-08 03:52:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @scottlincicome Sounds like this administration
1313929771638820868 2020-10-08 03:50:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 I spoke to a woman today who has voted Republican for 50 yrs. She told me it is over. What she has witnessed during this admin. and trump and his Republican enablers has convinced her that Democrats are more in line with her feelings so she voted Dem. right down the line.
1313928670575243270 2020-10-08 03:46:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol What a tough guy.
1313928083418894337 2020-10-08 03:44:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump There are no ends that you won't go to. You have done everything to ruin the environment. And we won't talk about your ignorance as far as climate change is concerned
1313914228424798208 2020-10-08 02:48:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @FOX2News Another strong woman who trump calls a "nasty woman"  anyone see a pattern?
1313913769534291968 2020-10-08 02:47:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus Are you going to try to sign these checks. You were told that was illegal the last time so you sent everyone a letter. I took great pleasure in tearing it up and burning it. Anyone would think that money came from you. It came from people who actually paid taxes.
1313912538451542017 2020-10-08 02:42:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @waltshaub @bivens_e You won't trump because you would never take your fat ass in a church
1313912003321384966 2020-10-08 02:40:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @VetsForRL @RVAT2020 Trump is a racist bigot. He has proven that over and over. He despises white people who object to his racism.
1313911175940386819 2020-10-08 02:36:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @tedlieu @bivens_e @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump Did all these people grow up being liars and cheaters? Did they not have parents to teach them right from wrong? It just seems to come naturally to them.
1313905361565421569 2020-10-08 02:13:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @WhiteHouse Like you really care about Floridians. I am sure whatever you received wil be given to your family and friends. We the people will never see them.
1313904535576903680 2020-10-08 02:10:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are so stupid that you believe everyone else is stupid. We all are aware that you had buddy putin fix the 2016 elections and he has been found to be doing it again. You are a lying cheat. Thats the way you have lived your life. You didn't win the popular vote
1313903213888839680 2020-10-08 02:05:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @LawEnforceToday @realDonaldTrump How phony. They are all paid actors. I thought your campaign was broke like you.
1313901272718868480 2020-10-08 01:57:29 +0800 <dmhossley> Sessions said " we need to take away children" what kind of monster says this. Then he tried to drag the bible into it. Can anyone forget the little girl crying for her "daddy".
1313899481931407361 2020-10-08 01:50:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Oh that nasty woman. Tell me trump is Nancy nastier than Hillary?
1313898527928528898 2020-10-08 01:46:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @eisingerj @bivens_e @RobertFaturechi @JustinElliott Can't win any other way but cheating. The whole damn bunch of them would get their ass's kicked in the school yard.

We can still remember what it was like to have sanity in the white house. Now we spend a lot of time wondering what the hell the insane idiot is up to.
1313896751422676992 2020-10-08 01:39:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I hope the people around trump are treading carefully. Losers like him become enraged the more they see themselves sinking.
1313896172394819584 2020-10-08 01:37:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @eisingerj @bivens_e @RobertFaturechi @JustinElliott Barr is right up there on my shit list there is hardly any difference between him and trump except barr may have a slightly higher IQ.
1313894426234814464 2020-10-08 01:30:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scotti31903356 @TrumpWarRoom Remember trump said, in 2016, that he liked uneducated people.  Educated people do not presume they know anything about someone they have never met.
1313893008857870336 2020-10-08 01:24:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe @KamalaHarris Kalama Harris is a pioneer for women and for the Democratic party. Good for her.
1313892288142213121 2020-10-08 01:21:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e My guess is she is not proud.
1313892100715487233 2020-10-08 01:21:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @jmartNYT @bivens_e @maggieNYT @anniekarni Time to get your CV's together and put them out there. There might be people who would hire a trumpers
1313891231810949120 2020-10-08 01:17:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @CharnaS17 @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Because they are trumps heros. If you notice he has nothing nice to say about decent people. I guess he sees decency as a sign of weakness. Funny, but the more he talks the weaker he sounds.
1313890083590856725 2020-10-08 01:13:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe down with covid. Those liars never tell the truth.
1313889481926291457 2020-10-08 01:10:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @LibertyBritt I agree. I voted straight dem.
1313869163404898307 2020-10-07 23:49:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @EmmaKinery @bivens_e This is why trump is so desperate to stay in the WH. He knows he is going to jail.
1313868286539509760 2020-10-07 23:46:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @lauriecrosswell @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump Of course he hasn't mentioned his sick wife. It's ALL ABOUT HIM! That is a typical sociopath.
1313867897392033794 2020-10-07 23:44:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Couldn't happen to a better person. He has made the country worse day after day.
1313867268997165056 2020-10-07 23:42:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @JuliaDavisNews @bivens_e Trump keeps spreading the trump white house virus around.
1313866053949284362 2020-10-07 23:37:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scotti31903356 @TrumpWarRoom Wow have you fallen for all the trump propaganda. The fact is VP Biden is a decent God fearing man who is very respected. Trump is a narcissistic, sociopath who has treated women disgustingly and really hates everyone but himself.
1313864134748930048 2020-10-07 23:29:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It's happening!
1313862968476655616 2020-10-07 23:25:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I couldn't have said it better!
1313862772300697601 2020-10-07 23:24:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @hshLauraJ @bivens_e @RealJamesWoods Oh right. Religion is more important than saving lives. If these people don't care about their own lives thats ok. But they want to infect others. There was a law in effect that if an aids pt has sex with someone without disclosing their disease they face charges
1313861567667150849 2020-10-07 23:19:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What a jealous ass. He has never gotten over the fact that McCain is immortalized as a hero and trump as a draft dodger. I cringe every time I see trump saluting our service members especially after calling them losers and suckers.
1313860061140320259 2020-10-07 23:13:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @jennalynn_84 @TrumpWarRoom I am tired of trump liars spreading lies on twitter.
1313859485081825280 2020-10-07 23:11:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @SykesCharlie He got his Adderall back from donny jr. That must have been a scene.
1313858666764947457 2020-10-07 23:08:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jim_Jordan Gym Jorden you are so full of shit. Why don't you keep your lying stupid mouth shut. Better yet go to the white house and hang out with trump for awhile.
1313857570948481026 2020-10-07 23:03:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I wouldn't think there much support for trump in Calif. Trump identified the state as a blue state and said he would not help them  He went on a rant about how Calif. needed to clean up the forests because that is the reason for the fires. The forests are mostly federal .
1313854914137710594 2020-10-07 22:53:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @but_abta @TrumpWarRoom Trump has someone else plagiarize for him because he's too stipid.
1313853747416772614 2020-10-07 22:48:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scotti31903356 @TrumpWarRoom What an asinine statement. VP Biden has relationships with leaders all over the world. He is very respected. Unlike trump who is only interested in relationships with communists and dictators.
1313836721591799815 2020-10-07 21:40:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @johnjimenezz @SVNewsAlerts @NYGovCuomo The virus doesn't care about your religion or symbolic weeks. So many have been working so hard to end this virus and people refusing to wear masks are making the job harder. Yourreligion and symbolic weeks will still be there when the virus is gone. Everyone has to do their part
1313830521747668996 2020-10-07 21:16:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @tomiahonen @bivens_e You would think the Republicans would try to save what is left of the party.
1313830002056716288 2020-10-07 21:14:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @CarolM39 @bivens_e @SVNewsAlerts @NYGovCuomo This sounds like trump talking.
1313829589882413058 2020-10-07 21:12:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @JJohnsonLaw When it comes to Rudy there are a lot of problems. The number 1 problem is he is another pathological liar. I thought Rudy was kicked out of New York. I know he and trump are not welcome there
1313829012431609857 2020-10-07 21:10:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @JCTheResistance @bivens_e @GOP There are children in the country going hungry and that fat bastard doesn't care. Have another burger and coke trump.
1313825476721475584 2020-10-07 20:56:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @kurteichenwald @RepsForBiden Stable genius.
1313803640327544833 2020-10-07 19:29:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @JCLRRA @tcspeaks I have been saying trump is a pain in the ass
1313682277256376320 2020-10-07 11:27:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @DanRather He wants to punish Americans. He blames everyone but himself for everything.
1313681689529507841 2020-10-07 11:24:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse @SecretaryCarson @HUDgov Melania trump needs to keep her infected self away from children. I guess because she doesn't come from this country she doesn't know what xmas means to Americans so please tell her to stop the"fuck xmas" quotes.
1313680117978333191 2020-10-07 11:18:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Why don't you shut the hell up. You are an obnoxious disgusting fat ass POS.
1313679346872221697 2020-10-07 11:15:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It is going to take a while to forget how so many republicans enabled trump to do so much damage because they are afraid of him.
1313678751687942146 2020-10-07 11:13:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You've got that wrong. The American people must come first. How could you, an obvious overeater, deny money for familys to buy food for their children. What kind of person does that. I guess the kind that put children behind fences crying for their mothers.
1313676769531232257 2020-10-07 11:05:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @maureenheverly @SpeakUp61906217 @paulsperry_ You left out trump and barr
1313665897974960128 2020-10-07 10:22:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You punish American family's by not giving them some relief. You are obese because you overeat there are children out there that are malnourished because they do not have enough to eat. I talked to people that are on line to get a box of food. This was not their fault it is yours
1313646277985546242 2020-10-07 09:04:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @wonderbread57 @fbnewsroom Sorry but you have been deceived. All the violence is being done by right winged groups such as: White supremacists, proud boys, kkk, boogaloo bois. FBI has reported that these groups are the ones who are doing all the violent acts

You want to talk about someone declining look at trump he'sgoing down fast of course he was never really with it. I experienced his bs in new york. He had to leave because his bullshit wasn't going over any more.
1313631228554350594 2020-10-07 08:04:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump My prayers were not answered. The asshole is still running his mouth. I have to try again. Maybe i'll go to wed mass.

You will lose Pennsylvania. Didn't you just make some nasty remarks about Pennsylvania because you are behind in the poles?

1313626844831395840 2020-10-07 07:47:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol @RVAT2020 Words of reason. This is what that sounds like folks.
1313625945094459393 2020-10-07 07:43:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP I am so used to the lies coming from these people that i have to limit my watching because i get so mad.
1313625352078581764 2020-10-07 07:41:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump No one believes a word you say. Actually it doesn't sound like your words in this text.
1313625001581518855 2020-10-07 07:39:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @crawdmc @WillTellLater1 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Ha ha ha lol lol lol the only one gong to prison is trump Lock him up lock him up lock him up  By the way the DOJ is not getting re elected. Americans know about his lies and cheating for trump. He is so corrupt.
1313623703587090432 2020-10-07 07:34:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Does anyone really believe your shit anymore? I have looked up you supreme court nominee. She is very one sided in her decisions. She liedwhen she said her personal views do not enter into her decisions.Anyone can see decisions she has made on cases. Is she also like you just lie
1313622458969264129 2020-10-07 07:29:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @JohnJHarwood Since there is no stimulus money going to the people before elections than there should not be a vote on the supreme court judge until after elections. Something is seriously broken in the white house.
1313621338930774016 2020-10-07 07:25:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @AOC @tcspeaks Here he goes again. He is only president to republicans. This is criminal from the pres. of USA. He has denied help to all dem. states and gave enormous amts to repub governors like desantis. The worse part is gov like desantis does not pass it. on to the people.
1313619123335843840 2020-10-07 07:16:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Brian Morgenstern. just made one of the most ridiculous statement besides trump i have heard yet. He said "having caronavirus is not a death sentence"  Oh really asshole tell that to the family's of the 211,000 dead.
1313615101438709762 2020-10-07 07:00:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Christie is just another ass in a long line of ass's. He has been hanging around trump for the longest time looking for trump crumbs. This is the low life who closed all the beaches in NJ as Governor then took his whole family to an empty beach to enjoy the day. He needs to diet.
1313613460463378432 2020-10-07 06:53:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I just saw the most vile trump ad in Fla. They claim Biden let a child rapist out of jail. This is just so sickening. I bet it was made by his drug addict son donny boy.
1313610938348601345 2020-10-07 06:43:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @PoliticusSarah @RepsForBiden Trump has made it clear over and over that he is president to Republicans only.
1313610223790239746 2020-10-07 06:40:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @kaitlancollins I have been accosted in the store by idiots calling me names for wearing a mask. I finally bought a pkg of disposable masks that I keep in my purse.and when someone starts with me I offer them a mask. That usually shuts them up.
1313608871932551168 2020-10-07 06:35:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol This is true. If they wanted to save this nation they would take over. That's what happened with Nixon. He was told resign or we will put you out. He had the sense enough to resign. Trump will stubbornly run everything into the ground. He dosn't care what happens to Americans.
1313607482678415360 2020-10-07 06:30:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @cindycrum @bivens_e @bblock29 He's actually threatening the American people that they will get nothing if he is not reelected. Then they will get nothing until mid jan. when Biden takes over. This is a desperate, mean, spiteful, evil man. He should never have been in charge of a nation. He is not fit.
1313606115226251267 2020-10-07 06:24:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @SarahLongwell25 @bivens_e Kamala Harris deserves to be safe. The admin. has lied so much no one believes them anymore. So to protect Kamala there should be a plexi shield between them. Who knows if Pence has the virus or not they would never tell us.
1313605008357765128 2020-10-07 06:20:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden The better Angels will prevail.

1313604573584601091 2020-10-07 06:18:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Because you are behind. Everything you do is convincing more and more Americans that you are a danger to our country. People are deciding COUNTRY OVER TRUMP.
1313586738175111169 2020-10-07 05:07:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Pathetic
1313586040683233285 2020-10-07 05:04:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have been voting for many years and i never remember such chaos and fear and threats. We believed in the system but we have a president now who is threatening votes will be thrown out or just not counted trying to discourage people from voting because he is losing.
1313583644120936453 2020-10-07 04:55:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden This is a presidential campaign from Joe Biden. Trump just puts on a shit show full of lies and BS.
1313577760523198464 2020-10-07 04:31:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @ms3fande @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @CNN Read the rest of these tweets and see that you are all alone. It is obvious that trump is going down both at the poles and his mind. No normal president would act like him.the selfish, spiteful bastard
1313576537673928706 2020-10-07 04:27:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZackCz Do really think promising stimulus money if you are elected is just one of the evil moves you have made. You hateful, spiteful bastard. You will not win. The only way you can is how you won in 16 by cheating. We all know by now that putin was involved and is doing it again
1313575411423608832 2020-10-07 04:22:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @pbump @RepsForBiden Of course because they all lie. They follow the leader
1313530182997868547 2020-10-07 01:22:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Typical Fla. crapThere are still thousands of people waiting for an unemployment check from back in the spring. The excuse is the computers need updating. Now computers crashed while people tried to register to voteIs this all a coincidence? Somehow I am beginning to have doubts
1313528368583897092 2020-10-07 01:15:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Who would take the word of a Doctor who purposely deceived the public about trumps condition. Not a Doctor I would have anything to do with. I worked with many Doctors and Surgeons over 35 years and never witness such irresponsible actions.
1313523452419149825 2020-10-07 00:56:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Hey, hey donald j How many Americans are you going to kill today?
1313496776301834241 2020-10-06 23:10:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @volunteermom113 This is a woman speaking: trump needs to keep his malicious mouth shut. He is a menace to society.
1313493495311671297 2020-10-06 22:57:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am sure they explained the dangers, but according to trump no one tells him what to do. I say leave him to his own devices.
1313492723543011334 2020-10-06 22:54:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden @DrBiden Thank you Jill. I hope you are preparing for your next job as First Lady.
1313492132984950793 2020-10-06 22:51:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @DebraMessing @MikeBloomberg More people are able to vote because of Mike Bloomberg. He stepped for to make sure the voters decision was upheld. DeSantis did all he could to stop it. We all will remember desantis and his doing trumps will and not the voters come reelection in 2022. He should start preparing.
1313490696507142145 2020-10-06 22:46:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @apbenven You go girl!!!!!!
1313489998851837956 2020-10-06 22:43:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar @RepsForBiden How lindsey conveniently forgot those words.
1313489414258032641 2020-10-06 22:40:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @jimsciutto @RepsForBiden trump is certainly a contradiction of ideas.
1313488934589136898 2020-10-06 22:39:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @kaitlancollins @RepsForBiden It goes back to at least tulsa. Agents were infected there and not a word of regret from trump.
1313488499996319746 2020-10-06 22:37:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @ejeancarroll Thank you, so very true.
1313488136325017600 2020-10-06 22:35:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @Timodc And poses for a photo op. This is even more strange than the bible incident.
1313487421338779648 2020-10-06 22:32:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @LanceUSA70 @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump I am so sorry for the loss of a wonderful woman. Please know a nation is grieving with you.  Don't look for any empathy from trump it is just not there.
1313486101047390215 2020-10-06 22:27:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden There should not be any discussion about Wade v Roe. Women against abortion do not have to have one. Women fought so hard for the right to decide for themselves. I can not believe this is still a discussion so many years later.Who has the right to tell us what to do?
1313481898207916034 2020-10-06 22:11:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @GabeDreyer I am so sorry for your loss. Please don't listen to the destructive ass in the white house. He obviously is not right in the head.
1313480679989161985 2020-10-06 22:06:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @shalomisnow @bivens_e He has been taking Adderall since the Apprentis according to others on the show. Adderall is an amphetamine and he supposedly crushed and snorted it
1313479474969743360 2020-10-06 22:01:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden His wife is hanging on to get that money trump doesn't have
1313478698327257088 2020-10-06 21:58:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Floridians go vote. Dems. ahead but we still need more. Vote for Biden. For those who are upset with DeSantis vote for Biden.
1313466995061522432 2020-10-06 21:11:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @ANNSISCO1 @tcspeaks trump is so reckless. These people should stay away from the white house and receive full pay.
1313466267710427136 2020-10-06 21:08:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden @tcspeaks Thank you VP Biden for bringing sanity an honesty to the American people.
1313465930442301446 2020-10-06 21:07:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scaramucci The Republicans need to remove this dangerous man from office. Nixon did not do anything like trump and he was told to resign or he would be removed. Times have changed. trump is getting away with reckless and dangerous actions that affects all Americans.
1313319931182809088 2020-10-06 11:27:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I can't feel bad for him anymore. We don't know what is real and what is show.
1313319577418424320 2020-10-06 11:26:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar We have an unhinged lunatic in the white house. He needs to be removed.
1313319282609135621 2020-10-06 11:24:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @BeschlossDC trump should have a complete mental evaluation. He is really unhinged. For security reasons i think he should be removed from office.
1313309095945031681 2020-10-06 10:44:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidaxelrod We have had some great presidents and some not so great but i have never seen such idiotic nonsense from any of them.
1313307374271295493 2020-10-06 10:37:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @PreetBharara Is that what you call it "standing strongly on the balcony"? That is the most ignorant statement i have heard in the last few days. The statement worse than yours is from trump telling people not to give in to covid. If he really does have the virus he may still go downhill
1313306142471344129 2020-10-06 10:32:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @USDOL @WhiteHouse none of these jobs will help the 210,000+ people who have died.
1313305483621605379 2020-10-06 10:30:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @SBAJovita @WhiteHouse For 210,000+ Americans there will be no jobs.
1313300492475404294 2020-10-06 10:10:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @PreetBharara I just love what Don Lemon just said "trump has taken an american tragedy and turned it into a reality show" he has done this to us over and over. I am so sickof trump. I watch stupid shows I never watch just to avoid that fat old man. I can't do it any more. He is too much drama
1313295518924263424 2020-10-06 09:50:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @karagoucher @RepsForBiden Kara, don't listen to trump. Anyone who has lost or are losing a loved one knows what you are going through. You are not alone I am so sorry you are going through this. Listen to people who have your best interests at heat. trump is just a big buffoon who talks too much.
1313281979509624834 2020-10-06 08:56:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 @OliviaTroye trump didn't seem like he understands the virus. He told people to live with it. 210,000 people can't do that.
1313279574625656832 2020-10-06 08:47:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @brenonade It's obvious he s having trouble breathing but macho man is trying to look like he is not. not working
1313278800919244806 2020-10-06 08:44:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e If trump treated the staff at Walter Reed like he treats his staff and everyone else he is around they are breathing a sigh of relief. I was hoping he would come up against an old fashioned Army Nurse who would not be intimidated by him but put him in his place.
1313277232073379851 2020-10-06 08:37:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @PreetBharara He is sick in the head.
1313276890405363712 2020-10-06 08:36:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidaxelrod Why is that? He certainly tried to push it on the rest of us. I did check it out and trump has interests in drug company's that make the medication.
1313275940273782786 2020-10-06 08:32:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @brenonade Another trump act. He is a showman
1313273862541504512 2020-10-06 08:24:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProjectLincoln Donald trump is a fake president
1313244903158222849 2020-10-06 06:29:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @lalahhathaway Unfortunately.
1313244324939919361 2020-10-06 06:27:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden And then did his wife give him permission to be in the same room as Kamala?
1313241672046858243 2020-10-06 06:16:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @JenniferJJacobs @bivens_e @SalehaMohsin More showmanship.
1313241482841784320 2020-10-06 06:15:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @Timodc I am not sure the Republicans can come back from all the damage trump and the Republicans in Washington have done.
1313240943890509830 2020-10-06 06:13:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Biden and Harris are going to be very busy undoing all the damage trump has done.
1313240436182593536 2020-10-06 06:11:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Really. Another example of sociopath trump having no feeling. This man was his friend and went to tulsa to support him. I never heard him say how sorry he was about what happened. Sociopath asshole.
1313239505244229632 2020-10-06 06:07:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Can they register to vote? They are so cute. And obviously very smart.
1313238882431971328 2020-10-06 06:05:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @KatieS @RepsForBiden I am so sorry for the loss of your Dad. I know exactly how you feel seeing this phony man playing president downplaying the suffering of our love ones and our suffering their loss. trump is a sociopath he has no ability to feel except for himself.
1313237301045145601 2020-10-06 05:59:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @dpzbestbkr @ClarisaClarity @SharonSharonh10 @OliviaTroye I thought that then I realized he didn't have his orange makeup on. He will be orange as soon as he is finished with his new BS.
1313236974703185923 2020-10-06 05:57:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @ClarisaClarity @OliviaTroye Don't forget they are broke and desperate and facing jail time for corruption.
1313236390759608326 2020-10-06 05:55:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye After all the antics trump has done i am beginning to believe this covid thing is just another ployThis time for sympathy to get votes. I hope the American people see through it. It is no different than the bible ploy. trump has no couth. Nothing dirty or nasty is too low for him
1313235153167290374 2020-10-06 05:50:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye @RepsForBiden Everything that klan does is plain showmanship. The thought with them is do everything legal or not to win. We have to remember the whole klan wins if trump wins. It  gives them a place to live for 4 yrs while they steal more from the American citizens. They are broke.
1313227215467950081 2020-10-06 05:19:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @DemWrite It is a crime. He should be charged with endangering the American people with his lies. Lock him up!!!!!
1313226723958325249 2020-10-06 05:17:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP He's no hero, he is a showman and good at it.
1313226440029200395 2020-10-06 05:15:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It is so despicable for a president to fake an illness just to get votes you are such an ignorant fool.. By the way jackass in case they didn't tell you taking steroids make a person feel great. That is the reason why they are used sparingly they mask problems.
1313224940569718785 2020-10-06 05:09:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If you are feeling so good give that expensive medicine to someone who is really suffering from the "white house virus" you ass. Always the showman right trump?
1313222793081872384 2020-10-06 05:01:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You are going to lose Graham. Why? Because you are another pathological liar just like trump. Biden is going to win by a landslide. You assholes can try to find a way to cheat, but we are all onto the whole lying bunch of you.
1313221511763894272 2020-10-06 04:56:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep You are a first rate human being, Bernie!!!!!
1313219230096150528 2020-10-06 04:47:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e He should be tired with all the lying he does.
1313218870199693315 2020-10-06 04:45:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson They are bat shit crazy
1313218651093311489 2020-10-06 04:44:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart tRump is a liar
1313218499419025409 2020-10-06 04:44:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @monacharenEPPC Liar
1313218160573718533 2020-10-06 04:43:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump would like to see the seniors die of covid then he can steal social security. He stole money for his idiotic wall. By the way does the wall protect us from the"white House virus" i love that. The chinese call the virus that.
1313217050064674823 2020-10-06 04:38:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Really, i can't believe this BS is still on twitter.
1313216737005973507 2020-10-06 04:37:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He made more appearances because it is doubtful that he ever had covid. He knows he is way down in the poles and the showman in him came up with this ploy.
1313214697362120705 2020-10-06 04:29:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @BidenReps @RepsForBiden He only cares about tRump.
1313213172006948864 2020-10-06 04:23:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @BidenReps I don't feel sorry for him. He is so evil that we can't believe anything he says. He is not fit to be in the white house. We should kick him and his klan out.
1313212331669835783 2020-10-06 04:19:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDrBirx With all the crazy stuff the President does why wouldn't we think that this is a publicity stunt. Having Drs lie for him is just not anything any decent dr would do. I worked with Surgeons for 35yrs and they would never do such a thing
1313211202311458816 2020-10-06 04:15:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Jason Miller IS a suck ass douchebag.
1313210823444234240 2020-10-06 04:13:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 I really believe now that this was a big publicity stunt. People really have to think twice about voting for an asshole that would do that to the people who believe in him. The man is such a lying cheat that it is not inconceivable of him to do this.
1313204174272765968 2020-10-06 03:47:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump This was a publicity stunt. tRumps a liar. Pass it on.
1313203227106525185 2020-10-06 03:43:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @stephenfhayes @RepsForBiden Because there is nothing to tell. He never had covid. Look at all the free publicity he received. All the people all over the world praying for him. He is such a phony ass that i would not put it past him.
1313202585575346179 2020-10-06 03:41:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @realjimpiddock @RepsForBiden I think it was all a phony ploy. He didn't have covid. Now he says it's nothing. That convinced me. I knew people who were sick and died and i can tell you it was not "no big deal". I don't put anything past this ass If he thought it would get him votes.
1313201567206694913 2020-10-06 03:37:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I wish you would stop dominating the news.Your Dr. will have to find another job since you made a liar out of him. Who wants to go to a dr who is a proven liar. Maybe you can get him to work on keeping you out of jail. He can make another phony claim that you are sick.
1313199472206319617 2020-10-06 03:28:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe this was just a publicity stunt. Nothing like a little sympathy to help you get ahead.
1313197982305734657 2020-10-06 03:22:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Aren't you lucky. 210,000 people did not get home to their family. You really suck. First you say there is no virus, it's just going away. Now when you can't say that any longer you say it was no big deal. Tell that to the families that lost love ones.
1313146735519297536 2020-10-05 23:59:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @yashar They are all super spreaders. Stay away from the whole infected bunch
1313145747362242562 2020-10-05 23:55:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @SykesCharlie They are so precious. I can take social distancing from people but not from dogs.
1313144962943512577 2020-10-05 23:52:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @happyhamers @SykesCharlie You just accept the hair as part of the deal when you love dogs
1313142301770817542 2020-10-05 23:41:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP McEnany just reported that she tested positive this morning and is isolating.
1313138753016393734 2020-10-05 23:27:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden We all need to watch an honest, decent Presidential candidate at the Town Hall tonight at 8pm from Miami.
1313136504466792449 2020-10-05 23:18:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch I hope there are no more trumps getting it at least until they are out of the white house.Not because i care about them but because Americans willbe paying millions for their care. Let them all get it when they are gone. Since they are broke they will have to deal with it like us
1313134375794544646 2020-10-05 23:10:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump VOTE We have to get this irresponsible, selfish, self absorbed, ridiculous fool out of the peoples house. trump is nothing but a liar and a cheat. He even makes the people around him lie for him soiling their reputations. VOTE VOTE VOTE for VP Biden. VOTE VOTE VOTE
1313131926962741252 2020-10-05 23:00:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Just be quiet. We would appreciate that rather than see you put out a phoney message like this. You know we all know you only care about yourself and how much you can steal from American citizens. Everything about you is phoney. Families who lost love ones know who is responsible
1313130009134014464 2020-10-05 22:52:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @fema I am so happy to see that Americans are paying attention around the country. trump is down 14 points. We have to keep going to clean this country out of ALL the cheating, lying self absorbed Republicans. I will never vote Republican again. The party is so tainted.
1313128077128601603 2020-10-05 22:45:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @fema Florida citizens are paying attention. We are third in the country with cases. The numbers have been going up since the governor opened up the state. This is the most irresponsible action a governor can do. He does not care about the health and well being of the people vote !!!!
1313113927451017216 2020-10-05 21:48:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How much is a human beings soul going for these days?
1313108110794465282 2020-10-05 21:25:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @Craig_A_Spencer @bivens_e The U.S. has more cases and deaths than anywhere in the world is because of DONALD TRUMP. The world have responded by banning US citizens
1313104520617000960 2020-10-05 21:11:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e More insanity. Are the Democrats the only one who care about humanity, that includes Republicans who have decided trump has to go
1313103887168086016 2020-10-05 21:08:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @ImmaculateLoo @bivens_e Are you kidding? There s no one more selfish than trump and co. How many have you infected including maybe the SS agents who, because of your selfishness, had to ride in that stupid car ride yesterday.
1313102861958557696 2020-10-05 21:04:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @FOX2News @charlielangton Another example of the evil uncaring Republicans. I do not remember the party being so evil before trump
1313102529954283520 2020-10-05 21:03:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidCornDC @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump I know i am sick and tired of all the attention he is getting. Does he care about the 209,000 innocent people who have died. He has never exhibited concern for them or their families who's lives have changed forever. He is a selfish ass.
1313099046928687104 2020-10-05 20:49:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @electroboyusa @tcspeaks @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump He doesn't need to he has enough idiots praising him.
1313098686407356417 2020-10-05 20:48:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @wigwam @tcspeaks Unbelievable. These assholes still try to say it is an entitlement. It is not but a lot of perks they receive are. They need to give up all their ENTITLEMENTS before they touch Social Security and Medicare. Next they will cut benefits to the military.
1313097577458528256 2020-10-05 20:43:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Really. I am so sick of watching all his BS. There are more important things going on in the world than trump and covid. He was not serious as hundreds of thousands were dying so why should anyone care about him?
1313096733094744064 2020-10-05 20:40:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart More proof of a selfish and self absorbed ass he is
1313096434540044290 2020-10-05 20:39:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @78_MissSunshine @tcspeaks @jaketapper @drsanjaygupta @CNN They have to figure out what lies to tell
1313095865511407618 2020-10-05 20:37:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP I saw them on tv a few times outside the hospital
1313095649378947072 2020-10-05 20:36:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Selfish bastard
1313095364329779202 2020-10-05 20:35:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @ktumulty @tcspeaks @PressSec I really doubt that. We are very aware that trump and company are pathological liars. If he cared about the other pts in the hospital he would have stopped all the horn blowing and yelling outside instead he encouraged it by going out there. He is such a selfish asshole.
1313094483505020928 2020-10-05 20:31:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing We know by now that trump doesn't care about anyone elses life. The lies his Drs have told is no surprise. I just wonder why they would compromise their credibility with other patients.
1312890144702238722 2020-10-05 06:59:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @micalaag @highstreetteam @Timodc I was really looking forward to him being sick enough to keep that stupid mouth shut. Not going to happen.
1312874917424234501 2020-10-05 05:59:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @Rapieress @tcspeaks Yes. Good idea. His idiot supporters will watch it and then maybe he won't be on the news so much with his ridiculous mouth  He is so annoying.
1312873672630300673 2020-10-05 05:54:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Crazy people. They don't care for him because of the good he does for the country,  they love his stupid ignorant antics. Because a majority of them are uneducated. Remember Jim Jones. He started collecting broken people in LA and they followed him to their 900+deaths. Like trump
1312870212811841537 2020-10-05 05:40:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol He has been on Adderall all this time and they didn't transfer his responsibility.
1312869878404177922 2020-10-05 05:39:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Rapieress @tcspeaks If anything came from God it would be a one way ticket to hell.
1312869532051046400 2020-10-05 05:37:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @mldauber @tcspeaks I also was on it for Rheumatoid Arthritis. It was back in the early days before the RA drugs came along. It ended up leaving little pin holes in my bones
1312868687376977920 2020-10-05 05:34:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @Rapieress @tcspeaks Trump is still the biggest asshole in the country. He had the SS drive him around to wave to his supporters. Why doesn't someone give him a tv show. Not the apprentice as that was a flop. So he is back in hospital.
1312866347597074434 2020-10-05 05:25:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @Rapieress @tcspeaks Trump just left the hospital at 5:20pm. I am sure the hospital is relieved to get rid of him.
1312861813965565953 2020-10-05 05:07:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @EmilyGlazer @bivens_e @pdberger @rebeccaballhaus @katie_honan When the donors find out that trump went there knowing he was infectious maybe they will think twice about their pledge. I would be very pissed. There is a possibilty trump will be even more broke.
1312860452704182273 2020-10-05 05:01:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @vanbadham @MollyJongFast Good catch Molly. In some ways i feel sorry for him, but not too much.
1312860009265590272 2020-10-05 04:59:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @bivens_e Doesn't she know they broke? I have never seen a president and his family want another term like these people. They will beg, borrow and steal to stay in the White House so their dad stays out of jail and they can mooch off the American people for another 4 yrs.
1312858677792124936 2020-10-05 04:54:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep This is how Republicans treat Democrats. Biden will treat everyone the same, but I will not forget this or trump helping red states not blue states. It would be child abuse if a parent did for one child and not another not to mention that that child grows up looking for revenge
1312853160348835841 2020-10-05 04:32:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @mattmurphoc @tcspeaks I love it. I'm going to tweet that to trump. He will really appreciate it since i will stop calling it the trump virus
1312852328421240837 2020-10-05 04:29:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @mainesleeper2 @janemarielynch Isn't that a shame.
1312850180115492865 2020-10-05 04:20:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Funny but if you look carefully you will see Proud Boys there
1312849924657160194 2020-10-05 04:19:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Does trump really have to have so much praise all the time? If he wants to go through the Pearly Gates he better stop with all that stuff because as serious Christians know demanding praise is a sin.
1312849054884339712 2020-10-05 04:16:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump Tonight at 10pm on CNN is the first of a series about our first ladies and what they accomplished  It starts with Michelle Obama. Yea!! I noticed Melania trump isn't listed but then what has she been known for in 4 yrs? Tearing up Jacky Kennedy's Rose Garden And saying "fuck xmas
1312845009255833604 2020-10-05 04:00:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Hey you selfish ass. There are real sick people in the hospital and would appreciate quiet. Many times in my career I had patients ask me to stop all the noise from inconsiderate patients and visitors. Often i had to ask visitors to leave. So keep that in mind.
1312842507898814470 2020-10-05 03:50:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @JDWackrow @bivens_e @sam_vinograd They are all learning as they go along, even trump. He had not learned much in 4 yrs  I personally think he is not teachable.
1312841461097005062 2020-10-05 03:46:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @AP_Europe @bivens_e Good for them. Maybe we can hire them to run trump out of the country.
1312836387910098947 2020-10-05 03:26:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Maybe Kelly Ann Conway gave the virus to Barr. They were very close at the event at the rose garden. Of course he can't get more attention than trump so he's hiding out somewhere. With al the evil things he has done, i hope he is suffering.
1312834421016453120 2020-10-05 03:18:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Who cares about barr. If the virus could choose to infect evil, lying, shit heads then barr would definitely be on his way out.
1312832502856388618 2020-10-05 03:10:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast Again I have to say watching the terrible assembly of noisy ass's outside Walter Reed. Trump is not the only patient in the hospital. They just said the crowd was organized by the local Republican party. This is typical of them. Selfish, self centered fools.
1312822427655774208 2020-10-05 02:30:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP The admin. should consider sneaky trump out in the middle of the night put him on Air Force One and send him to putin. He'll get excellent treatment in Moscow. Putin has a vaccine I am sure he will give to trump.
1312819292128374785 2020-10-05 02:18:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer You go get them, Chuck.
1312819067108065280 2020-10-05 02:17:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e What an asshole! Still not taking this serious. Your president is in the hospital because of irresponsible behavior and thinking. What is wrong with you people? The 209,000 and counting people dead is no big deal? Republicans have become such selfish and self centered people.
1312817756245569536 2020-10-05 02:11:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump A question. Why are those people outside the hospital allowed to be honking horns and screaming. I could barely hear what the Dr.said. doesn't the president call this an unlawful assembly? Does anyone care that there are very sick people in the hospital and they require quiet.
1312768838094778369 2020-10-04 22:57:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @Chef_KateM @tcspeaks Texas Lt. Gov. Said old people should volunteer to die to save the economy. He said this on Mar.24, 2020
1312760560082182145 2020-10-04 22:24:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @MalcolmFlex360 @nowthisnews Republican words.

1312759457986883586 2020-10-04 22:20:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @JayTCannon @bivens_e It is inching up in Fla. due to the irresponsible Gov. DeSantis.
1312758887725006851 2020-10-04 22:18:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @Kasparov63 @bivens_e You are a liar. 29 Firemen from died from radiation exposure. Another trumper who can not tell the truth
1312758352628322305 2020-10-04 22:15:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e 29 Firemen died of acute radiation exposure. Stop lying and "go about your business" kasparov.
1312757623624790019 2020-10-04 22:13:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @wsteaks @bivens_e @benyc What do we expect from the trump clan?
1312757406171107328 2020-10-04 22:12:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @socalaura @Kasparov63 Who will forget the sharpiegate.
1312756959553245184 2020-10-04 22:10:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RedState @realDonaldTrump "Don't use the word smart with me". Those words really belong to the stable genius. I have to say as a compassionate person I felt bad that trump caught the virus, but all the nasty remarks against Biden yesterday I lost my empathy for him and totally direct it to 208,000+ dead.
1312750230819962880 2020-10-04 21:43:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @GingerGibson @tcspeaks His chances are very high that he would not. Trump is only worried how he looks. Actually the mask is better on him, covers his orange face. I wonder how he likes being described as called old and obese.
1312749394631028738 2020-10-04 21:40:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Trump ads have not changed at all

1312748515702050817 2020-10-04 21:36:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @stevebenen @tcspeaks They just keep proving that the Republican Party is not on the up &amp; up. They lie, cheat and steal and have no empathy for all the people who have lost their lives to covid.Presidents call families when soldiers die but this one doesn't say anything to covid families.
1312746474921496582 2020-10-04 21:28:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RedState @realDonaldTrump This morning I watched Jason Miller. The thought I had was why do the modern day Republicans need to lie and cheat?  I made the decision to leave the Republican Party half way through trumps term because he just did not care about leading the American people. He just lies.
1312625786134949888 2020-10-04 13:29:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @FrKadel @jonathanvswan @HelenKennedy Well trump looked like crap on his video today.
1312622179150966785 2020-10-04 13:14:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Everybody lied.
1312621566342070272 2020-10-04 13:12:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @mayaharris_ @bivens_e Trump just wants to get back to the bunker where he is safe.
1312621016754065409 2020-10-04 13:10:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Does that include the 208,000+family's of the dead. You and trump should call every family and tell them you are sorry for your part in their death. That would be the decent thing to do.
1312619204273754112 2020-10-04 13:03:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @giufuliafa @CorvusCollosum @Tim_Walz @DrBiden @TeamJoe That is what trumpers do. They can't find anything nasty on Joe Biden so they make up crap. If we want to find nasties on trump we just have to google him. You can find anything from sexual complaints to his Adderall addiction.
1312616637972066304 2020-10-04 12:52:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @darakass @tcspeaks Sounds pretty damn desperate for the job to me.

1312604566484115456 2020-10-04 12:04:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @iamtheagent99 @jeromevanaken @BernerSanders @organicgay Really! He knew what he was doing when he turned down the salary. The people pay for everything else and pay trump when foreign dignitaries come to US. He puts them in his places and then charges the US top dollar. He flys all over campaigning. We pay for the fuel and maintenance
1312602562403725315 2020-10-04 11:56:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e And he is being taken care of by far left liberals.
1312602109792210945 2020-10-04 11:55:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @clwtweet @GovChristie I am so glad someone told him off about that. I could not believe he closed all the beaches and then took his whole family to enjoy the empty beach. They seem to forget that the people put them in their position, they work for us, and they can be voted out.
1312600442791174144 2020-10-04 11:48:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @rebeccaballhaus @bivens_e @WSJ Oh sure trump, just let everyone run around out there and get infected and they will get through it. Did you tell the 208,000 people that died that. You ASS. And Rudy you are ass #2
1312598830769213440 2020-10-04 11:42:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeyNurse_lb @tcspeaks I did yesterday but today I feel just glee.
1312593757838209024 2020-10-04 11:21:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @liseski @bivens_e Maybe Jackie gave them all the covid for screwing up her rose garden.
1312593332762275842 2020-10-04 11:20:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e He didn't have to because it was a hoax and then he said it is going away. I lost tract how many ways it was going. "It will just disappear"  "there were 5 then there were none" " when the warm weather comes it will just go away" and so on.
1312591941402492928 2020-10-04 11:14:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @Pikminister @Watson2038 @robreiner I didn't think about that. It is so true. Funny they have enough tests for him to have multiple times a day but we have to wait on long lines and they run out.
1312588972212846592 2020-10-04 11:02:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @shalomisnow @Coach_Milam @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Sorry, I was answering Aaron Milan. He tweeted he will save his empathy for Abbie. I guess he didn't like the fact that I said I had  empathy for the 208,000 people that trump killed.
1312586947353772032 2020-10-04 10:54:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RBReich They also have some old time nurses that were trained in the military. I would suggest trump keeps his mouth shut about losers and suckers.
1312586133738487809 2020-10-04 10:51:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @JAN_8892 @MeidasTouch One positive thing I have learned through all of this is that I kind of like people keeping their distance.
1312584672392736768 2020-10-04 10:45:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @Coach_Milam @shalomisnow @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Abbie doesn't need any ones empathy. She's happy and well adjusted and spoiled rotten. And I want to keep her alive. So I demand masks and socal distancing. Since I spent many years working in surgery she learned how to wash her hands thoroughly.This is what I can do for her.
1312580458761289728 2020-10-04 10:29:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @hopelesslibtard @bivens_e The more that comes out about her I am convinced that she does not have the temperament or the reasoning to serve on the Supreme Court. That position is very serious and has to have people who are serious. The reason trump wants her is that she has promised to vote his way.
1312578800719409153 2020-10-04 10:22:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You might try being decent to the professionals caring for you. You don't have the right to berate them and curse at them or make outlandish demands on them. Try being decent even though it goes against everything that you are.
1312577644249206784 2020-10-04 10:17:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e You'll never know cause he'll never tell.
1312576556125093891 2020-10-04 10:13:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @amandacarpenter Thank you!
1312576257104773122 2020-10-04 10:12:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden We can come together as a nation when trump is out of the picture
1312575453144788993 2020-10-04 10:09:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @shalomisnow @bivens_e @realDonaldTrump Today I have absolutely no feeling for him. His Dr lied through his teeth. His staff are all lying. The funny thing is they all have a different story so I am to a point that I don't give a shit about him. I save my empathy for the 208,000 people he killed.
1312545715583946752 2020-10-04 08:10:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e If trump feels better then kick his ass out of the hospital. We are paying for this expensive hospital stay.
1312544106770583553 2020-10-04 08:04:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheUSASingers @bivens_e I just don't know where she got the gall to destroy that garden. It looks terrible and they keep putting chairs and people all over the grass areas so it is so dug and nasty looking. If a friend says you can stay at their house for awhile do you mess with the house and gardens?
1312542454139232256 2020-10-04 07:58:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZekeJMiller @bivens_e Do you think he has guts enough to insist people have to were masks? He probably has to get permission from his wife first.
1312541891314020357 2020-10-04 07:55:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I just concentrated on his face. Where did all the orange go? He was a pasty shade of gray.
1312541171290431490 2020-10-04 07:52:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @rebeccaballhaus @bivens_e They are all full of crap.
1312540750018641921 2020-10-04 07:51:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch I would like to know why this guy is not in jail.
1312540233884413953 2020-10-04 07:49:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch This goes on all over by trump supporters. He has encouraged this behavior. I watch him tell a guy who was standing next to someone with a sign against trump. He said "punch him in the mouth and I'll pay your legal fees"  thats the leadership they have and want.
1312538818487017474 2020-10-04 07:43:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @maggieNYT @Used_To_Be_GOP All he had to do is say he can't give info because of the HIPPA privacy rule. Then he wouldn't have to lie to us. His own credibility is at stake.
1312536950054690816 2020-10-04 07:36:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @therecount Maybe Rick Scott should find a better class of friends.
1312536438680895488 2020-10-04 07:34:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP They should all be locked up according to trumps own law and order decree. No they will shoot rubber bullets and spray mace on peaceful demonstrators exercising their 1st amendment rights. All the trouble was done by the White Supremacists, the Proud Boys and the Boogaloo bois.
1312535151964942336 2020-10-04 07:29:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @BidenForFL @TeamJoe @fred_guttenberg DeSantis snuck around behind our backs and got the legislators to pass a motion that the prisoners have to pay all fines and fees before they get their voting rights back. That is not what we voted on. It was not on the ballot. DeSantis is a nasty son of a bitch.
1312534129544626176 2020-10-04 07:24:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @BidenForFL @TeamJoe @fred_guttenberg We just have to watch out for that sneaky DeSantis. He will try to pull some shit like he did with the felons.Fla. voters overwhelmingly voted for their voting rights to be restored when the finished their sentence.
1312531468351008768 2020-10-04 07:14:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing That's really funny. Trump and his clan are banging their heads against the wall trying to come up with someone they can blame. They are all masters of the blame game never taking responsibility  for any thing.
1312530071769374720 2020-10-04 07:08:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @joncoopertweets I felt bad for trump in the beginning but all the lies he and his people have told in the past few days have  really reminded me of what I can't stand about all of them. So no more sympathy from me. It is what it is.
1312528832050601984 2020-10-04 07:03:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @BobQuarantine @joncoopertweets What makes you think they haven't? You don't think they lie.
1312527754538098688 2020-10-04 06:59:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Why would they change now? The American people have been lied to from the beginning. I started to log all the lies and finally gave up because they were coming so fast that i could not keep up.
1312527092962058240 2020-10-04 06:56:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast Yes

1312515877946884096 2020-10-04 06:12:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @jelani9 @bivens_e And the campaign people and the Secret Service that all got sick. No one talks about them.
1312515061596917760 2020-10-04 06:09:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @michaelgwaltz @CNN @kaitlancollins Really? Have you been listening to all the lies from supposedly  people with integrity. It is just lie after lie then they ignore the question if they are asked to clarify a statement. The Government lies all the time for the sake of the people.
1312513004349521923 2020-10-04 06:01:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e It should be called the covid garden. It does not resemble the original rose garden.I think these people never live in a house with grass and gardens.

1312510881033383937 2020-10-04 05:52:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch They are already covering up the coverup.
1312510276726472705 2020-10-04 05:50:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA @WhiteHouse Would you believe them if they agreed. They lie so much who knows what is real or not.
1312509496938295296 2020-10-04 05:47:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @bblock29 @bivens_e Do people change? I really don't think someone like trump can. He is who he shows the world. He has probably has spent his whole life worrying about what people think. Sociopaths usually do not change especially when they have spent their whole adult lives acting out.
1312399384697606145 2020-10-03 22:29:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @joncoopertweets @JoeBiden Just reinforces what I believe:  Some Republicans are spiteful, selfish people.
1312373029641617409 2020-10-03 20:44:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @JuddLegum I know what we would be saying. trump &amp; co.did not get to the debate early enough to be tested. None of them wore masks even though they were asked to wear them, these actions put every ones lives in jeopardy. Republicans are selfish they don't care about other peoples lives
1312371592375283712 2020-10-03 20:39:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 Where ever Joe Biden is, he doesn't have the virus. He certainly was awake enough to listen to and implement the CDC guidelines. Wear a mask, socially distance and wash hands
1312174834093223936 2020-10-03 07:37:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @mattbc @TeamJoe @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris This is America. These people should not have to worry about healthcare.
1312174088190746625 2020-10-03 07:34:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidEggert00 We really have to vote in as many democrats as possible because the republicans have become a spiteful and nasty lot. They don't even know what they are voting for they were just voting against Gov. Whitmer because trump didn't like " that woman in Michigan".
1312172454232559618 2020-10-03 07:27:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @BresPolitico @bivens_e @Jim_Jordan Now that is one person that if he did get the virus I would not care a bit. Gym Jorden is foul, nasty and only half human. He can go to hell as far as I am concerned. That may be just where he will go i am sure he doesn't expect to go to heaven with the things he has done
1312171092107169792 2020-10-03 07:22:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @AshaRangappa_ @bivens_e I answered that stupid conspiracy theory this morning, i am not going through it again. Just to say that it is idiotic to say 208,000 dead are all Republican.
1312163302538006530 2020-10-03 06:51:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jim35221439 @kylegriffin1 Democrats are basically nice, compassionate people. They give not take. Thats my experience anyway
1312162435084689408 2020-10-03 06:47:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @walksuecan @kylegriffin1 All the 208,000 people who have died were alone except for the medical staff. Some kind nurses would contact the family with a tablet or phone and give the family the chance to say goodby. That would not be the case for trump. His family would be brought to him.
1312159487415865344 2020-10-03 06:36:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @JacquiHeinrich @RepsForBiden Seeing trump walking to Marine One with a mask brought me back to the other night at the debates when he badgered VP Biden about wearing a mask. It's not so funny now.
1312139996854329345 2020-10-03 05:18:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden President trump is on his way to Walter Reed Hospital. No matter what we think of him he is a human being and we need to pray for him
1312136736693125124 2020-10-03 05:05:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @PeterSchorschFL @bivens_e @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump @AGGancarski Somehow i don't have confidence that he will. If he hopefully survives i think he will go right back to his bullying and name calling and just plain nastyness
1312135536769859584 2020-10-03 05:01:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @bivens_e It has to be Florida. We have a very irresponsible and selfish Gov. DeSantis who can't think for himself he has to follow trumps direction. It is too bad that the citizens of Florida don't have a leader.We will Vote him out in 2022. Never deny the power of the people.
1312133907538558976 2020-10-03 04:54:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @megynkelly @RepsForBiden Does anyone think grace would be shown to Joe and Jill Biden if the circumstances were reversed? I would like to think so but somehow the Republicans have turned in to a mean spiteful lying party so i am pretty sure there would just be nasty comments and making fun of Joe.
1312131361713479680 2020-10-03 04:44:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @BFriedmanDC @bivens_e I vote no.
1312126798210064388 2020-10-03 04:26:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @schwartzbCNBC @RepsForBiden Maybe be more legal liability for trump? Giuliani will handle it.
1312125050506469376 2020-10-03 04:19:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Agree
1312124827654713344 2020-10-03 04:18:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden From what I see they still do not believe in masks. One actually intimated that there was a question as to why only Republicans are getting sick. Another Republican conspiracy. I answered that Republicans won't wear masks and Democrats do. Strange
1312078118694408198 2020-10-03 01:12:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @LALewman @Acosta Just plain stupid
1312078007301963777 2020-10-03 01:12:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @Acosta Someone ought to kick that stupid ass out. Let him go read some xrays. What the hell does he know about the virus.
1312077243758391296 2020-10-03 01:09:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @LALewman That s how shitty lowlifes are.
1312076794045095936 2020-10-03 01:07:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @aimeecarrero I agree. That is how the Republicans act. We just have to watch the sneaky assholes.
1312076220641816581 2020-10-03 01:05:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @shossy2 Trump is the one who should apologize. His actions were an affront to all Americans
1312075353234509826 2020-10-03 01:01:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @sulaviedilejo @robinskyleigh God gave us the tools to avoid the virus some people spit in his face and are now paying for it.
1312074567087722498 2020-10-03 00:58:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @TalbertSwan Do you think he will find a little compassion now that he has the virus. I didn't think so.
1312073288517062656 2020-10-03 00:53:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheDailyEdge Such selfish bastards. Drag everyone down with them.

1312072096340738060 2020-10-03 00:48:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheDemCoalition I can hear the bitching now. Those damn democrats. What would the Republicans do if the situation was reversed.
1312070517298520066 2020-10-03 00:42:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @blackwomenviews I absolutely agree. It is a shame that supposedly intelligent people can not be trusted.
1312070097008300032 2020-10-03 00:41:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @KatyJayne101 Who's laughing now?
1312069893395750913 2020-10-03 00:40:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Charliedesigns3 He followed it because he's not an idiot.
1312069484635619328 2020-10-03 00:38:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @SpittingImage Too funny.
1312069193341247490 2020-10-03 00:37:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @AynRandPaulRyan @DeAnna4Congress We were very lucky that Joe Biden was not infected by trump who was yelling and spitting like an idiot and don't deny it its on video. I taped it
1312068411766308864 2020-10-03 00:34:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @DeAnna4Congress It is not odd at all.We take care of our selves and keep safe and many have learned to wear a mask.Trump kept making fun of Biden and the dems for wearing masks.We have a Republican Gov. In Fla.who says we don't have to be carefulanymore. I think Republicans want us sick and dead
1312066917000261632 2020-10-03 00:28:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @AynRandPaulRyan I hope those people have been notified so they can be checked out. That is only fair.
1312065147394023424 2020-10-03 00:21:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @NicoleArbour Really? Let me know how that works out for you. You can do what ever you want and have been doing. You just have no right to kill others WEAR A MASK SAVE A LIFE
1312064196318842881 2020-10-03 00:17:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidmweissman I agree. We are above that.
1312034105555660803 2020-10-02 22:18:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @secupp @RepsForBiden The idea that how one looks is more important than a life is just insane to me. "I may die, but i won't die with a mask on"  these selfish people don't care if they give the virus to someone else. I posed that scenario to a young person months ago and he now wears a mask.
1312028318049460224 2020-10-02 21:55:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @2hrzes1dog @GreggJarrett I am always amazed at the amount of trump wackos that come out of the woodwork. They have no shame at all. WEAR A DAMN MASK ASSHOLES. Yes i did scream that because ignorant people don't get it unless you scream at them.
1312026362782285828 2020-10-02 21:47:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I can't believe that there are still idiots out there who spread fake news when we are in the middle of a health emergency.
1312025064200638464 2020-10-02 21:42:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Do you think your decision or rather trumps decision to open everything up in Florida was a bit callous? Apparently you do not care about what will happen to Floridians. This virus will get everyone who is not protected. We are responsible to each other to wear masks.
1312021952656281609 2020-10-02 21:29:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @bivens_e @KamalaHarris It is going to have to be completely sanitized first.
1312019623081136128 2020-10-02 21:20:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @davidmweissman No one believes anything anyone in that administration says anyway.
1312018598282625024 2020-10-02 21:16:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @MariaTeresa1 @RepsForBiden @FoxNewsSunday One of the most difficult problems in health care is non compliance by patients. Denial is such a destructive human trait. Such a simple thing like wearing a mask could have changed everything.
1312010476503564290 2020-10-02 20:44:08 +0800 <dmhossley> trump is supposed to have a phone call this morn on Coronavirus and vulnerable seniors. How appropriate.
1312007320461873152 2020-10-02 20:31:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Desperate people do desperate things.
1312005709727518722 2020-10-02 20:25:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA I really hope Nancy Pelosi made Mnuchin wear a mask when he met with her.

1311994664187297792 2020-10-02 19:41:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @ReallyAmerican1 @JoeBiden I am concerned about Joe Biden. I went to his twitter site but he has not been on there all night. The news said they have been trying to contact him but have not heard back. I pray he is ok.
1311959584257515522 2020-10-02 17:21:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @SovernNation @WhiteHouse Is this the dr who filled out trumps paperwork while trump sat in the car? Or is he dr feelgood?
1311953030007455750 2020-10-02 16:55:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @_texinca @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump It would be poetic justice.
1311950645243662337 2020-10-02 16:46:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WildRootsStudio @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump She is such a bitch. I wonder if she is demanding that donny make it go away.
1311916523645263872 2020-10-02 14:30:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @BrianSimsPA @tcspeaks Such stupidity. Unfortunately some may become very sick and some may die. Now that trump has the virus will there be a change in attitude? Who knows.
1311915944256602112 2020-10-02 14:28:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e I am not a child and trump scared the hell out of me. I still can see that face all twisted up and him yelling at. VP Biden who by the way really kept his cool as trump bated him over and over.
1311915108822650880 2020-10-02 14:25:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Another example that this adminstration does not care for the health and welfare of the American people. Now that trump has contracted the virus maybe he will have a change of heart. He has the best doctors to care for him. So many Americans have lost everything to this virus.
1311914056807317505 2020-10-02 14:20:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidFCavell @RepsForBiden The Obama's did make Christmas at the White House an American holiday. The First Lady did a terrific job decorating and welcoming many to celebrate with their family. We were very lucky to have had the Obama's for 8 yrs.
1311912575744049153 2020-10-02 14:15:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @venivelovici @bivens_e @mikiebarb So true. You never know with trump. He is a showman. I don't wish this virus on trump or anyone else. It is a living hell. If he is smart he will make up with Dr. Fauci and get rid of that screwball radiologist.
1311910606094692354 2020-10-02 14:07:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @angiel806 @bivens_e I remember a kinder gentler America. It hurts my heart to know we will never be able to go back before the trump admin.We have been changed as a people. I hope not all is lost. But the damage can be seen on a daily basis. Even with all trump has done to hurt us i hope he recovers
1311908716854288384 2020-10-02 13:59:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @terryschappert Enjoy him and give him all the love you can and you will be rewarded with love and loyalty that no human will ever give you. I had my yellow lab for 15 yrs. I was lucky she was healthy and very close to me for all those years.
1311905937037447169 2020-10-02 13:48:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e This is horrendous. America has never treated it's citizens in such a sneaky and underhanded way. How dare the Gov. of Texas take this stand and put restrictions on the voting rights of Americans. He needs to be removed from office.
1311904011382128642 2020-10-02 13:41:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @Carrasquillo @bivens_e @sam_vinograd This is no joke. Maybe now this virus will be taken more seriously. Trump is in a high risk group. He is elderly and obese and who knows what else. Trump has not been forthright about anything. My fear now is for Vice President Biden. He was on the stage with trump.
1311871638833631232 2020-10-02 11:32:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden One reason she said that is because she has no style.  Christmas was always a big deal in washington. The first ladies really worked hard to beautify the white house. The trumps have not given off the vive that they care.
1311869708510130176 2020-10-02 11:24:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @DanFesperman @maggieNYT @yashar And more time out of prison
1311869430423531520 2020-10-02 11:23:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @Sivacek @maggieNYT I bet that is a sobering fact to trump  Imagine Nancy Pelosi running the country.
1311868373723160578 2020-10-02 11:19:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @mountainviews @maggieNYT Such a presidential way to act. He does not take anything serious. He is the president of a powerful country. He is responsible to take extra care of himself and the vice president for the good of the country and does he? No. That man should never have been president .
1311866632004829190 2020-10-02 11:12:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @maggieNYT We would appreciate it if he stays away from florida. We don't need his virus germs here.Florida has enough problems.
1311847715853291520 2020-10-02 09:57:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @GregAbbott_TX What the hell is this about? this is ridiculous.. I hope trump is paying you enough to do this. Why do Republican Gov. kiss trumps ass? This is trumps election fraud he can't say anything else because he ordered Abbott to suppress votes
1311844058483109888 2020-10-02 09:42:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecBrouillette @WhiteHouse @ENERGY Just keep f**king up the environment trump. You are a bigger asshole than people know.
1311843392616308737 2020-10-02 09:40:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProjectLincoln @bivens_e I can't remember the white house not having a dog. Thank God trump doesn't like them because the shit going on there would be so unfair to a dog
1311842641823309825 2020-10-02 09:37:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @PhilipRucker @JaneMayerNYer What went wrong donny jr too drugged up and couldn't perform?
1311829373939601409 2020-10-02 08:44:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I really resent this. My fantastic, loving and very smart Mother died of breast cancer. Melania nor trump have any compassion for the 207,000 Americans who have died from the virus or their families so please don't act like breast cancer victims are important. It's an insult
1311825922744619008 2020-10-02 08:30:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @AndrewSolender Trump is just so crass and ignorant no decent person listens to him.
1311825167501406208 2020-10-02 08:27:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Joe Biden reminds me a lot of John McCain. I think trump hates them because they are what decency is and he does not understand that because there is not a decent bone in his body.
1311823454820335617 2020-10-02 08:20:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @gillu3 @bivens_e @ChrisMurphyCT @Alyssa_Milano Once we get rid of trump our country will be great again and we will have relationships back again with our allies. The really good news about Joe Biden is he already knows all the leaders. This is just a little blip on the radar. All will be ok
1311821553752043520 2020-10-02 08:13:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Congresswoman Omar would wipe the floor with asshole trump. She would have to be careful because he's been known to mess his pants and she wouldn't want that on her. Trump shows his racism with verbally attacking her. Asshole trump
1311819596626882562 2020-10-02 08:05:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @artsycarol @ChrisMurphyCT It is easy to see he has fallen out of favor with asshole trump.
1311817317341421568 2020-10-02 07:56:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @ReallyAmerican1 When trump gets bored and starts his shit with them we wil see how brave he. He won't have the bunker to run to because he and his clan will be evicted.
1311816623335133184 2020-10-02 07:53:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Oh shut the hell up asshole trump.
1311815852740751360 2020-10-02 07:50:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Trump should send his wife and her family back where they come from if he hates foreigners so much. I don't understand why she stays with that crazy mess anyway.
1311814537998467073 2020-10-02 07:45:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @freep A woman would not behave that way, they have a much better imagination and some are really devious.
1311813881849876482 2020-10-02 07:42:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @AmbJohnBolton Is everybody going crazy? What the hell!
1311813527053766659 2020-10-02 07:41:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Every day that the fact that trump is going to lose becomes real to him he becomes more loony tunes. I can't wait until it's over and he has a major meltdown. He should take care of donny jr as he really looks like he is going over the edge. Talk about drugs.
1311809114599763968 2020-10-02 07:23:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Still thinking
1311806130704842752 2020-10-02 07:12:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e This is such BS and you know it. Just because trump is stupid and most of the people around him are stupid that does not mean the American people are stupid
1311805194724933634 2020-10-02 07:08:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @sarahcpr @realDonaldTrump He should be allowed to. Joe didn't misbehave trump did.
1311803303970443265 2020-10-02 07:00:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Imagine if they have another trump shit show how much more Bidens campaign will raise
1311802092672163842 2020-10-02 06:56:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @vmsalama @bivens_e Everyone watching saw that.
1311801747174756362 2020-10-02 06:54:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Yes, absolutely. A president no matter who he is is not above the law contrary to what trump says.
1311800769461522432 2020-10-02 06:50:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You can't redefine feminism. You are either a feminist or you are not. We were the original feminists in the 60's and 70's who protested day in and day out with Gloria Steinem to win rights for females. Now all these years later all that work is in jeopardy of being erased.
1311799105115557894 2020-10-02 06:44:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @fwtoney @bivens_e I am still thinking.

1311794406555615232 2020-10-02 06:25:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @bivens_e Oh, when i read this i thought you were describing trump Where did you know Hunter Biden from and where were you when all this extortion and bribery and sex trafficking happened? I have to say you give him too much credit, i don't think he has the energy for all that.
1311792707640098816 2020-10-02 06:18:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @seanhannity Sorry, i never watch fake fox news
1311791616026386434 2020-10-02 06:14:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @danp2078r @bivens_e @MollyJongFast @GovRonDeSantis So true.
1311791252594200579 2020-10-02 06:13:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @AvivaHadara @StevenTDennis @GovRonDeSantis I have actually sent him messages telling him that when trump is finished using him thats the end of the friendship. Somehow I wonder if desantis's wife is behind some of this. they went to mar a lago a while back maybe she got a taste of that and pushes him to do trumps bidding
1311788972335656966 2020-10-02 06:03:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @amauloaku53 @bivens_e @narceducator You never know. He did go to a hotel in Moscow with prostitutes. That was were he decided he liked golden showers.
1311782251554918412 2020-10-02 05:37:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @CoxTake @WhiteHouse This is the president who accused the front line workers who were working double and triple shifts sleeping in cars so they didn't bring the virus home to their family of stealing PPE's. He had no idea how they go through that stuff.
1311778946904719361 2020-10-02 05:24:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @LALewman @WhiteHouse The worst part is the terrible things people say about them. I have seen it here on twitter. But let these same people get sick and they run to the hospital begging for help.people don't realize how horrible this virus is until they get it. Not being able to breathe is horrendous
1311775537535344657 2020-10-02 05:10:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @MisikoMichael @WhiteHouse The only thing is trump is no Hitler. Never could be. Hitler was the most evil man of all time, but he was intelligent trump is not.
1311774979424505857 2020-10-02 05:08:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I would like to know why you told desantis to open up fla. We are now going up in cases and deaths. In a week we will find out what damage the opening up the state has done. This is all money related the hell with how many people die.
1311771341796802562 2020-10-02 04:53:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jillbiden46 If they work for the government they are civil servants.
1311770951898591234 2020-10-02 04:52:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @narceducator @bivens_e Maybe he is suffering from undiagnosed or untreated syphilis. After time it erodes the brain and causes some very strange behaviour. I'm just saying.
1311768743085838338 2020-10-02 04:43:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovCTW @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump @RsAndIs4Biden It seems like Republicans are complicit. They do nothing about this jackass and he is destroying the Republican party. I for one do not think i can ever vote republican again. Right now with the way they have handled or not handled trump i do not trust them.
1311766431059582983 2020-10-02 04:34:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @dannyhanssel @CBSNews They also have to tell him how wonderful he is. Everything starts with "thank you mr president for your wonderful leadership" i had everyone laughing when i pointed that out.
1311762579950313498 2020-10-02 04:19:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @bockmann_bronco @brianstelter @IamLadyDi Absolutely. I have always believed the russians had a hand in his being elected and are doing it again. Trump says Heil Putin when he answers putins calls
1311761077835894785 2020-10-02 04:13:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA If trump wants to keep playing this game of citizens not belonging in this country then he had better kick that wife and her family out. The American citizens are probably supporting them too.  SEND THEM BACK
1311756492526280704 2020-10-02 03:54:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @oliverdarcy @bivens_e Somebodys strategy seems very confused but then Rush Limbaugh has been confused for a long time
1311755022938578946 2020-10-02 03:49:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Every single Republican needs to be voted out. They have turned into evil, hateful, racist, xenophobic, QAnon following assholes.
1311754095083106306 2020-10-02 03:45:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @AshaRangappa_ Actually she looks like she drinks the blood of children al la QAnon
1311753784469708800 2020-10-02 03:44:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @AshaRangappa_ It just looks so strange.maybe she has lower GI problems like trump
1311752859055263750 2020-10-02 03:40:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @thekjohnston @bivens_e She looks it.
1311752680814120963 2020-10-02 03:39:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I think 5 min.with trump and they will kick his ass. I am not anywhere near him and I want to kick his ass every day
1311752175714959363 2020-10-02 03:37:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You are getting better at lying. Some day you might be almost as good trump. Is that your goal?
1311751700659789825 2020-10-02 03:35:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Do your hearts break for the 207,000 dead from the virus? Their family and friends are still suffering their loss. I know!!!!
1311750305420390407 2020-10-02 03:30:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @Zei_kun @realDonaldTrump trump is an obese old man prime target for the virus
1311749996379766784 2020-10-02 03:29:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @someknew @realDonaldTrump Good reply!
1311749739134803976 2020-10-02 03:28:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump When will that happen?
1311749374062612480 2020-10-02 03:26:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @JosephDuong11 @realDonaldTrump Wow. I am glad I didn't have a father like him!
1311748931093704704 2020-10-02 03:24:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @Protogaea @realDonaldTrump I don't know what else he has to do for the powers that be to remove him. If any of us did a quarter of what trump does we would be doing some time.what about the 207,000 murders he has committed by denying the virus and continuing to lie about it.
1311747301799587841 2020-10-02 03:18:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Congratulations on losing the debate. But you did win the biggest asshole of all time. Enjoy!
1311744869996650497 2020-10-02 03:08:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidCoggeshall @bivens_e That is scary.
1311744565573976065 2020-10-02 03:07:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jillbiden46 @bivens_e It's going to happen no matter what trump does. This country still belongs to the people. trump is not dictator. Even putin thinks trump is too stupid to be dictator
1311737321524531200 2020-10-02 02:38:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @bivens_e I have to say this trump. You are an asshole. That spectacle you made of yourself was appalling and of course you would think it was a win you only have yes men around you to tell you how wonderful you are anyone who doesn't is fired. How many people have you been through?
1311734234529304579 2020-10-02 02:26:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @popodogo1 @StevenTDennis Not yet but if we keep going at this rate it won't be long. We also have had children die of the virus. When we were at our limit Gov. Cuomo from NY sent medicine, ppe's and nurses. Did desantis thank him? No he claimed trump sent it. I personally contacted Gov Cuomo to thank him
1311731704990707713 2020-10-02 02:16:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @DennisPochenk @StevenTDennis Well i don't know about that. Get covid and run to a hospital in fla and ask for help and see how ignorant you think they are. I have worked in health care in new york and florida and i can tell you that Doctors and Nurses in fla.are just as capable as any i have ever seen.
1311729336018448385 2020-10-02 02:06:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @SerLeonidas @StevenTDennis You should look at the deaths at the nursing homes in fla. And please stop labeling people. I am a republican who is voting for Biden because i can't vote for the racist, vile, disgusting person i the White House now. After his performance this wk i am now more sure than ever.
1311726829351337989 2020-10-02 01:57:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @DrTomFrieden I have had more than my share of the irate trumpers calling me names because i wear a mask. I just walk away because i know they are ignorant. I am not putting my life in jeopardy because of them or trump
1311725316239491075 2020-10-02 01:51:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @Tha_Florida_Man @StevenTDennis Until 2022.
1311724256615641097 2020-10-02 01:46:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @Bella_Davis @StevenTDennis Because trump and his desires are more important than their constituents.
1311723335928221696 2020-10-02 01:43:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @otto_maddoxx @StevenTDennis Sounds like putin has an affinity for Fla. How much better it would be to get rid of these pesky people. I guess Mar A Lago is not big enough for both the trump clan and putin.
1311721991548829696 2020-10-02 01:37:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @Derrick10439433 @StevenTDennis @DWUhlfelderLaw The problem is that Fla. was below 5% which was due to responsible people doing the right thing. It is now above 5% and climbing. The governor has been basically missing leaving it up to the Mayors to put restrictions out and now says don't listen to them open all and no masks
1311718643286372353 2020-10-02 01:24:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @Saylor117 @StevenTDennis @KatCapps So many of us do everything  necessary to keep healthy. It is the trumpers who made this a political thing. I can't count the times i have been approached with nasty remarks about being a Biden supporter because i have a mask on. I don't engage with these idiots.
1311717258373324800 2020-10-02 01:18:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @AvivaHadara @StevenTDennis @GovRonDeSantis We also can't forget all the people still waiting for an unemployment check from the spring. There are long lines for food and I talked to some people on these lines they said they never thought this would happen to them in the USA. While desantis apparently eats quite well.
1311716043874865154 2020-10-02 01:14:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @CalapooiaRiver @otto_maddoxx @StevenTDennis DeSantis doesn't think he does what trump tells him to do. Trump was here in Fla. the day before DeSantis lifted all restrictions . I only hope enough of us survive to kick desantis out in 2 yrs.
1311715066388123652 2020-10-02 01:10:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e With these #'s gov. DeSantis has opened up everything in the state and said people can't be fined for not wearing masks. He also said we are going to have a great Super Bowl with people from all over coming. DeSantis is trumps puppet and does what ever he is told.
1311712423456518147 2020-10-02 00:59:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I wonder how far I would get if I sent IRS notice that I am not paying my taxes because the President doesn't have to pay his and he is on the peoples payroll.
1311711334564851713 2020-10-02 00:55:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast @bivens_e Is that a promise? Put Florida on your list. Everytime you talk to DeSantis he comes up with some more BS for Floridians.
1311708260311986187 2020-10-02 00:43:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Good for you John Roberts. trump has a lot of explaining to do but he won't he'd rather blame everything on the media as he never takes responsibility for anything.
1311707080739389442 2020-10-02 00:38:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @KateBennett_DC @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Sunday night there is a show "first ladies" on CNN. I did not see her scheduled then thought they are only featuring First LADIES.
1311706207699247104 2020-10-02 00:35:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @VJones76276297 @ginaroitman @KateBennett_DC @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Well they got that wrong like everything else.
1311705359493599235 2020-10-02 00:31:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @karencollinsnyc @KateBennett_DC @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden I don't know if it is true, but I heard a rumor that she likes heroin. Could be she snorts a little Adderall that she steals from trump. That Adderall is getting around because donny jr sure acts like he's snorting too.
1311703716001714176 2020-10-02 00:25:10 +0800 <dmhossley> The FDA is right as far as I am concerned My distrust for a vaccine is because of trumps pressure. trump thinks he is all things but he is NOT a doctor and is not smart enough to be one. The radiologist. Dr Atlas does not know what he is talking about either.
1311698073299681280 2020-10-02 00:02:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @BensondogsM @Used_To_Be_GOP @PressSec Could be. She is tiny.
1311697352508534785 2020-10-01 23:59:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Because he is a racist, bigot with a proclivity for White Supremacists. Actually trump has a proclivity for anything vulgar, obscene, objectionable and just plain nasty.
1311693722959196162 2020-10-01 23:45:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @PressSec Give her a break. She is just a little girl playing grownup.
1311693066001092609 2020-10-01 23:42:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Oct.1, 2020 Covid 19 stats USA  7.237,043.       Total cases 207,008.           Total deaths  ???soldiers killed by putins bounty   So many Americans dead. So many families and friends destroyed by losing loved ones and not even being able to say goodbye
1311680288595087361 2020-10-01 22:52:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Acosta Biden is not cancelling the American people feel it should be cancelled as trump does not know how to behave himself. That last shit show has embarrassed the USA. Europeans are concerned that our democracy is being eroded by donald trump. Our allies still care for us. Not trump
1311678880172965889 2020-10-01 22:46:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @Acosta It is very well known that trump is a pathological liar. Instead of spending time lying he needs to do constructive things likecancelling his rallys in Wisconsin.They are practically begging him to cancel as they are having an enormous surge in covid 19 a decent human being would

1311672116518039554 2020-10-01 22:19:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 All I can say is:  WOW
1311660112180776965 2020-10-01 21:31:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @USDOT Thank you for lifting all restrictions on masks and social distancing. Now because I want to protect myself others are glaring at me for wearing a mask . I was a healthcare provider for 35yrs and know how to protect myself but am concerned about the crazy trump supporters.
1311650603416813569 2020-10-01 20:54:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @briantylercohen @CBSNews Cutting off trumps mic will do nothing as his mouth is so big he speaks over the mics. It is time to stop trump shit shows. He is only encouraged by any opportunity to act like an ass.
1311632856179826692 2020-10-01 19:43:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 @NeuSummits Why insist trump condemn far right groups that he has aligned with, it would only be another lie.When are the Republicans going to contain this man.He is not only a detriment to the American people, but to the Republican Party it self.People are leaving the party at a record pace
1311628010404093953 2020-10-01 19:24:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You better call off your dogs trump. The American people are not going to stand for you having the Proud Boys (i can't figure out what they are proud of) and White Supremacists groups threatening them at the poles. Is that why you don't want mail ballots?
1311626172023877632 2020-10-01 19:17:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Your friend Putin is accused by Navalny of poisoning him.
1311624381282562049 2020-10-01 19:09:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Brad had better think carefully about his own and his family's life. The trump clan is losing and Brad will lose along with them unless he tells the truth. The fact that they are afraid he will talk means there is something to talk about.
1311423201952641030 2020-10-01 05:50:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Yes, he is a lovely shade of orange.

1311403666771980289 2020-10-01 04:32:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @monacharenEPPC trump shouldn't have to be "willing to do so" as an American there should be no question.
1311403011827261443 2020-10-01 04:30:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @burgessev @RepsForBiden @igorbobic tRump is an abomination. There is nothing Presidential about him. He disgraces the USA all over the world except Russia because he is doing putins bidding.
1311398185840107520 2020-10-01 04:11:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump should be removed from office immediately for harming the USA and conduct unbecoming of the President of the United States.

1311392735308451841 2020-10-01 03:49:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenMcCollister @RepsForBiden @NEGOP It is not the Republican Party I used to know.
1311391697906159621 2020-10-01 03:45:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump should be removed from office. He made it abundantly clear of his contempt for American people last night. America is so diversified.  trump hates most Americans because he is plainly racist.
1311390285331664896 2020-10-01 03:39:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @monacharenEPPC trump has also condemn Black Lives Matter and he knows very well they are non violent. He hates them because of his racism.
1311389798322573312 2020-10-01 03:37:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @monacharenEPPC Joe Biden did not have to condemn Antifa because the FBI and other gov. agencys have said over and over this group does not engage in the violence of White Supremacists and Boogaloo Bois. Antifa is against Fascism and Racism. trump is very well aware of thisHe is trying to divert
1311387058691289094 2020-10-01 03:26:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I guess flotus thinks it is very funny to flaunt what she has done especially to the rose garden which was a place of so much history. When it was torn up it angered many people. Of course she is not from the USA so does not know or care about our history.
1311323262023094274 2020-09-30 23:13:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden There was no doubt about trumps racism last night, but his lack of empathy for the family and friends of the over 206,000 dead from the trump virus is just pathetic.
1311307355687129090 2020-09-30 22:10:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @OliviaTroye @RepsForBiden I really feel bad for Nixon. He didn't do half the nonsense that trump has done and the Republicans ran him out of Washington with his dog Checkers and his wife with her plain cloth coat. That was when Republicans had a conscience.
1311293927564156928 2020-09-30 21:16:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol trump is desperate to stay in the White House because he knows as soon as he loses the protection of the Presidents office he is going to be tried and convicted for crimes against America among other charges.
1311178590713786375 2020-09-30 13:38:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @Timodc Will you shut up man!!!
1311150308526108672 2020-09-30 11:46:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @secupp @RepsForBiden @CNN Santorum needs to be quiet he has nothing to contribute.
1311150005466599425 2020-09-30 11:44:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Nothing was wrong with that. trump is a clown.
1311145147363733508 2020-09-30 11:25:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Joe Biden kept his cool better than i could because this was a typical trump show.
1311141806172786688 2020-09-30 11:12:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @SheriffReese @TeamJoe He can not help lying. He is a pathological liar. This country is being driven off a cliff and trump is at the wheel.
1311140461868875777 2020-09-30 11:07:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @JGreenblattADL @RepsForBiden @POTUS This is another example of trumps racism and bigotry.
1311139951292149761 2020-09-30 11:04:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden No as a matter of fact he was scary and i am a white woman that according to trump is supposed to be afraid of men of color. trump is who i am afraid of. He is definitely not right in the head.
1311136562181222400 2020-09-30 10:51:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump Kayleigh you are such a silly little girl. Go play with you dolls and keep out of the adults room.
1311136173415424000 2020-09-30 10:49:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump Its just so funny.
1311135871882719232 2020-09-30 10:48:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RadioFreeTom He had some some nerve bringing up Joe Bidens sons drug problem when trump and his whole clan are on drugs. That is why he keeps bringing it.
1311134719371808769 2020-09-30 10:44:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Thank you PRESIDENT Biden for keeping your cool while that fool made an ass of himself.
1311133831672537089 2020-09-30 10:40:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Do you think that face on trump is because he messed his pants???
1311132144555757569 2020-09-30 10:33:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe How does trump know so much about whats happening with the ballots. He is sending people to do it.
1311131405074792449 2020-09-30 10:31:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @jimsciutto He will not.  I would love to put him alone in a room with him. He would start with that stupid mouth and they would f**k his little ass up.
1311129431218552836 2020-09-30 10:23:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Can anyone imagine working with trump? No wonder people leave he is a bully, a big mouth and an asshole
1311128694514163713 2020-09-30 10:20:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @morningmika Trump is going on about the forests burning because they are not maintained. They are FEDERAL forests asshole
1311127936796372993 2020-09-30 10:17:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Well putin can have him.
1311127735465631746 2020-09-30 10:16:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @Timodc @RVAT2020 Just the other night in Louisville there were many people with Proud boys on their jackets.
1311126974413312000 2020-09-30 10:13:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Antifa, antifa, antifa. What an ASS trump has made of himself tonight. How embarrassing for his family. I would never do that to my family.
1311126076098260992 2020-09-30 10:09:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @MiekeEoyang @TeamJoe SHUT UP TRUMP
1311124838904365057 2020-09-30 10:04:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @RepsForBiden And lies are a way of life with trump. I have not heard one word of truth from his mouth. I am so glad i am a radical left supporter of VP Biden.
1311122969557639175 2020-09-30 09:57:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden When my kids were five they would never lie like trump. I taught them better.
1311122480959021056 2020-09-30 09:55:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump got his ass kicked in the school yard as a kid and is getting it kicked now by Joe.
1311121590361436161 2020-09-30 09:52:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @realDonaldTrump @dbongino Wallace can't shut trump up. trump shows his ignorant ass every time he opens his mouth
1311120297601511424 2020-09-30 09:46:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I agree. trump can not control himself. Joe is better than me because i would have punched that bastard in the mouth by now. I don't understand why wallace can not control trump.
1311119558728724481 2020-09-30 09:43:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe We have been left with the heartbreak. We weren't allowed to be with our love ones when they died. donald trump couldn't care less about other humans just himself.
1311118636304797699 2020-09-30 09:40:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump says there have been no negative effects from his crowds. He forgets his friend that died at tulsa. He does not care. Now its open everything up. He did that in the spring and look what happened.
1311117319360438272 2020-09-30 09:35:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump nasty man.
1311116743734108160 2020-09-30 09:32:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am having diet coke because if i drink i am afraid i will smash the tv every time trump opens his mouth.
1311113947328765952 2020-09-30 09:21:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli Not talking about it does not make it not be.
1311113262616977409 2020-09-30 09:18:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He is showing his ignorant ass. trump should not be allowed to debate. All he wants to do is insult and call names.
1311112770218328064 2020-09-30 09:16:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @monicaraileybay Oh my, it is a trump show. He won't even let Wallace talk. trump has no manners he just an ignorant ass.
1311045790362673152 2020-09-30 04:50:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 If they are decent, honest people they will abandon the lying, cheating tRump and his whole clan.
1311045219358564354 2020-09-30 04:48:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 I really want an honest President not a cheating liar. I pick Joe Biden.

1311037145386233858 2020-09-30 04:16:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump All the tRump clan does is lie and lie. That is all your daddy taught you? He also taught you to cheat. That is your legacy: liar and cheater like your dad. Do you believe in a day if reckoning?
1311036411156594690 2020-09-30 04:13:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump It has been three days since desantis did what you told him to do, open everything up in Fla. and already the cases and deaths are rising. What do you care? Make lots of money until everyone succumbs to the virus.
1311034936057630725 2020-09-30 04:07:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovChristie You completely amazed me with the terrible untruths you are making up about Joe Biden Do you think trump is going to reward you? If he wins he won't know you. If he loses you will be just another loser and sucker. I guess you don't care about your reputation.
1311032173160521732 2020-09-30 03:56:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden tRump and his whole clan should be deported. Every day there is another lie to hurt other people. The whole clan is guilty of this

1311004070078021632 2020-09-30 02:05:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden The question is what does trump feel about all these dead Americans. The answer is NOTHING.
1310917228469125127 2020-09-29 20:19:57 +0800 <dmhossley> Why hasn't trump been charged with holding covid parties. They have people not wearing masks, no social distancing and lots of loud music so people have to scream to be heard that spread the virus.

1310912246093164547 2020-09-29 20:00:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @justinbaragona It never ends. This admin. is trying to accuse VP Biden of taking drugs. We have all been made aware of the drug use in the trump family.

1310679633298444288 2020-09-29 04:35:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @HHS_ASH Trump is a POS. How could anyone calling themselves an American do all the damage to the people who trusted him enough to put him in office. The joke is on the American people isn't it. trump really needs to stop all the noise now.

1310634494051876871 2020-09-29 01:36:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How much did the turkish dictator Erdogan pay trump to withdraw our troops and leave the Kurds unprotected from the Turkish forces. The world knows this is how the USA cares for it's ally's. trump only  cares about communism and dictators.
1310627715083628545 2020-09-29 01:09:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 @MilesTaylorUSA News flash trump it is the taxpayers money and you have no right to withhold it because you are spiteful. How much of taxpayers money are you putting in your own pockets. Given what we now know there should be investigation into our money and how it is spent.
1310625065264963584 2020-09-29 00:59:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Does that include all the health care professionals who died of the trump virus? Does trump feel anything for them and their friends and family? If there is no money in it for him he doesn't care.
1310624279986352135 2020-09-29 00:55:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 @MilesTaylorUSA That is how evil and spiteful he is. He really is an anomaly. One day he will pay for all the s**t he put people through.

He would do better to shut up about all the people trump put to work as it was very well known in NY that he hired illegals then refused to pay them threatening he would turn them in if they complained trump is such a sleeze

1310536632416833542 2020-09-28 19:07:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Thats why he lied about the virus. Then opened the country too soon. Everything he did was for his rich friends and family not for the good of the American people. He says everyone is picking on him but he has put this country in jeopardy with crooked dealings with communists.

Now I live in Florida and he made his residence here. I can't get away from him. He also corrupting Gov. Desantis. We have to VOTE him out.

He has many enablers in the gov. Now they are trapped because he has crap on many of them and the bastards want to save face.
1310427413164236800 2020-09-28 11:53:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @MrRaulJenkins @MeidasTouch Seems like some very expensive toupees even if he has one in every color.
1310422249183285248 2020-09-28 11:33:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What a good loyal man fit to be president. He evaded military service 5 times. He has paid 0 or very low taxes He lies and cheats his way through life. He has tarnished the office of the President of the United States. He has ordered attacks on American people
1310400393646571521 2020-09-28 10:06:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis You turned your back on the people of Florida for trump. Are you ashamed? You are going to be fully responsible for all the deaths going forward.
1310398343869235201 2020-09-28 09:58:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump, I know where there are food lines. It usually takes about 6 hours on line for a box of food. In case you think you are too good for that the people on those lines were hard working people who paid their taxes and took care of their familiesand lost everything thanks to you
1310395789341069312 2020-09-28 09:47:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He's an ass. But now we know he is  a broke ass. Someone had better watch out around the White House because trump and his clan will try to take everything that is not bolted down then try to pawn it.
1310394864375418880 2020-09-28 09:44:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar @Used_To_Be_GOP Wow was he taken advantage of. Oh wait we were taken advantage of because trump is broke.
1310394077679161344 2020-09-28 09:41:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeathMayo What is so bothersome to me is that the Congressional Republicans were aware that trump is a liar and a thief and did nothing. The least they should pay is to be removed from office and banned from running again for life. Their silence is a crime.
1310391498253504513 2020-09-28 09:30:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @DonaldJTrumpJr Who told you that, your daddy's friend putin?
1310384298877476864 2020-09-28 09:02:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump tRump - I have a $20 you can borrow but I will need it back because I have to pay my taxes.
1310376672827518976 2020-09-28 08:31:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump tRump- i have an extra $20. Want to borrow it? I will need it back though cause I have to pay my taxes.
1310370508576301057 2020-09-28 08:07:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Lock him up!!!
1310288737285349377 2020-09-28 02:42:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @lenore4evrmore @SenatorLankford @realDonaldTrump I believe that is one of the biggest reasons why trump picked her. He hates strong women. A subservient woman is right up his alley, but is she the best woman for this job. She is no Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Since she has very little experience she will depend on others for advise.
1310286809717501952 2020-09-28 02:34:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @CNNSotu @RepsForBiden @jaketapper The difference is when that happens to Joe Biden he does not say things like trump does "i didn't say that " " i don't remember" or "it was a joke".
1310285709337669635 2020-09-28 02:30:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @SteveDaines @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump No one wants to take away 2nd amendment rights. We just want to be safe from people. We had a man go home for his gun and go back to a park and kill a father in front of his child because of the noise. Then we had a man pull out his legal gun and shoot a young man in the movies.
1310284520730628096 2020-09-28 02:25:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Worse yet trump has directed the governor of florida to open up this state even though we have new cases and deaths every day. desantis has even put our lives in more danger by restricting mayors mask mandate. I am afraid florida is going to have another serious uptake in cases.
1310283195523518466 2020-09-28 02:20:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @JimInhofe @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Not all Americans agree. But who in the Republican Party cares about what Americans think they won't even listen to us.
1310260807171813376 2020-09-28 00:51:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Did you change your mind on labeling them as losers and suckers? Or was that another thing that you don't remember or are you realizing that that was a very stupid to say and may cost you votes. Are you truthful about anything?
1310259845812162561 2020-09-28 00:47:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse But you still will not tell the American people what your health care plan is.  Maybe you just don't want the Radical Democrats to know or maybe you don't have a plan. You need to come up with something as more Americans are contracting the trump virus
1310225898835251200 2020-09-27 22:32:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @SeppelRussel @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump It's a combination of mental illness and drugs.
1310225048301600769 2020-09-27 22:29:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Are drugs your excuse? It has been widely known as to your drug use.
1310063433145085953 2020-09-27 11:47:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @CBPMarkMorgan @WhiteHouse This is going on as Americans are waiting on long food lines. It is so sad to see our country deteriorate. I have volunteered to distribute food and talked with people who told me such sad stories about never being in this position before. So many said they would notforgive trump
1310060384712306688 2020-09-27 11:35:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I think all Joe Biden has to do is let trump destroy himself. I think trump with lose it probably due to too much Adderall.
1310053165841240064 2020-09-27 11:06:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 And why has he instructed gov. desantis in fla. to put all our lives in peril by opening up everything no restrictions.
1310051852986261504 2020-09-27 11:01:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It is very disappointing that again donald trump makes decisions that will affect all Americans without even having the decency to request our imput.
1309876889406844930 2020-09-26 23:26:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @Local4News Sorry I did it again. We will vote desantis, Gov. of Florida out of office in 2022.
1309876092908511232 2020-09-26 23:22:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump LOL this is the best joke of the day so far.
1309874996349669377 2020-09-26 23:18:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing The best Mom-ism my mom gave me was "show me your friends and I will tell you who you are" that served me well throughout my life.
1309714169307041792 2020-09-26 12:39:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 And he has brought the Gov of fla. desantis into his insanity. desantis  opened the state up no restrictions. Also says we will have a full Super Bowl.all this as we continue to have cases and deaths. Desantis said he will not shut the state down if infections rise.
1309697930094403584 2020-09-26 11:34:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis Have you watched every news program tonight? Medical experts, which you and trump are not, who have been saying you are crazy for doing what you are doing to this state. Do you really lack a conscience? There are going to be many deaths because of your greed.
1309678463121489920 2020-09-26 10:17:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse Impeach Kavanaugh. He should never have been seated in the SC. He is not morally fit.
1309677937264865282 2020-09-26 10:15:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @FDA You are wrong, he doesn't trust you and neither do I.  There is a growing group of people who are vowing not to have the vaccine. That's because of your involvement. You are not trustworthy.  I will personally do what I have been doing to stay healthy. trump vaccine no thanks
1309675863496167426 2020-09-26 10:07:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Desantis said if the virus increases he will not shut the state down. That came right out of trumps mouth. What desantis does not know is that when trump doesn't need him anymore he will drop him. Desantis wife got a taste of Mar A Lago and wants more. They are both so gullible
1309674034917974018 2020-09-26 09:59:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepJerryNadler Lock her up!
1309661272846278656 2020-09-26 09:09:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Local4News Desantis does what trump tells him to do. He does not care about the people who have and will die because of him. He was missing for a long time and left the mayors and the people to fend for themselves.we will vote him out in 2020 Desantis is totally useless to Florida
1309660195962916865 2020-09-26 09:04:57 +0800 <dmhossley> trump is throwing money to blacks, hispanics and especially Puerto Ricans. He has tried to scare white women in the suburbs saying these people are going to rape them. the women don't believe him and won't vote for him so he wants the votes of the ones he accused
1309657595255422977 2020-09-26 08:54:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @politvidchannel They are what was decent and kind in this country. Then along came trump.
1309657176642854912 2020-09-26 08:52:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis So you are willing to lie for trump because he wants this state open. Do you forget what he did to this country by 1st lying to us saying the virus was a hoax. 2nd insisting everything open up. The virus ran rampant. We have 204,000 dead. What amt do you think is acceptable
1309655257329405953 2020-09-26 08:45:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis Where are the stats for total cases and total deaths.does it bother you that there are 14,000 deaths and 700,000 total cases. 4 of them are mine. Why are you only loyal to trump and not us. Not mandating masks puts my life in jeopardy and killed ones i loved
1309647671913742336 2020-09-26 08:15:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Sorry, it is Sept. 25, 2020. It was a freudian slip. I wish it was year 2000 and there is no trump and we live in a kinder and gentler country. We have become used to all the trump insanity.
1309645535859675136 2020-09-26 08:06:42 +0800 <dmhossley> the head of the Justice Dept.,barr, is a f**king liar. How does that happen? Only in trumps world.
1309642900180029447 2020-09-26 07:56:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @MikeBloomberg @JoeBiden Thank you Mike Bloomberg for all you are doing for Florida.desantis is an ass and does trumps bidding. He does not govern and doesn't care what happens to FlaFor quite awhile he could not even be found when the Mayors of Miami and Miami Beach needed guidance. He is a non governor
1309640401071022081 2020-09-26 07:46:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump you had better not mess with Governor Cuomo. He can out do you in anything.  He along with all New Yorkers know what you did in NY and do not want you back. And so you know I will not take a vaccine that you have anything to do with. I really, really do not trust you.
1309638160217972741 2020-09-26 07:37:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 @MSNBC I am glad the disrespectful ass's stayed away. Only people who loved and cared for her belonged there
1309632723049426950 2020-09-26 07:15:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Florida covid19 stats Sept. 25, 2000  700,000     Cases 14,000        Deaths
1309630173529223169 2020-09-26 07:05:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The serious answer is desantis is doing trumps bidding. He has been all along. I was sure something was going to happen today when desantis was with trump last night. I just did not think he would put every floridians life in jeopardy. His term is up in 2022. We'll vote him out.
1309628055372132352 2020-09-26 06:57:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP The trumps do whatever they want and no one stops them. They just run amuck.
1309625788858236928 2020-09-26 06:48:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @JRubinBlogger What bothers me the most is that my family came here from England in the 1700's to have religious freedom.The Supreme Court is  making decisions based on religion no matter if their beliefs are the same as the country. Religion should not enter into a SC decision
1309623053085814785 2020-09-26 06:37:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @cssueta @JRubinBlogger What? Name the dems corruption? The only corruption in this country is that greedy horrible family living in the peoples house.
1309621414782291968 2020-09-26 06:30:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @MariaThePhD @JRubinBlogger You think democrats break the law? How many laws has trump broken then says "i am president i can do what i want" " i can walk down fifth avenue and shoot someone and get away with it" if the dems are guilty of something it is they let that evil jackass in office get away with it
1309619259308478470 2020-09-26 06:22:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @HaroldB93957514 @JRubinBlogger @DMBincredible Kavanaugh should be the first to be impeached.
1309617595755175936 2020-09-26 06:15:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP He got into daddy's Atterall.
1309595280510201857 2020-09-26 04:47:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @MikeBloomberg @JoeBiden Thank you Mike. desantis is trumps little puppet. What he pulled with prisoner's is horrible. We voted for them to have their voting rights restored and behind our backs he put the fees on them. He has no business leading a cub scout troop nevermind a state.
1309586549143724033 2020-09-26 04:12:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Now that you want their votes you pretend to care about blacks and hispanics. You know you are a racist. You have contact with the white supremacist and kkk. You praised them in Charlottesville. You are pure evil and take advantage of unsuspecting people like jim jones did
1309585354882678797 2020-09-26 04:07:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You have let this whole country down. Do you even care that Americans are dying every day because of you. Apparently not you didn't care when a friend of yours died. You are a fraud because you aren't honest. You are planning to be dictator.
1309582487908220929 2020-09-26 03:56:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis On top of all this desantis and trump want to charge Mike Bloomberg with a felony because he wants to help pay fees for prisoners so they can be allowed to vote we did not vote for the fees.They want to continue to punish these people. desantis and trump should go to jail
1309580343591272448 2020-09-26 03:47:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis What is bothering me so much is how Americans innocence is gone because of desantis and trump. Neither of them care about how many Americans die because of the decisions they make. Which as leaders of a country or state they are supposed to be doing what is best for the people.
1309579100235927553 2020-09-26 03:42:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis I was very worried about desantis meeting with trump in florida yesterday. my fears were realized today. desantis has opened up the state of florida. Restaurants fully open, bars fully open he also said if we have increase in infection we will deal with it.
1309513938447593479 2020-09-25 23:23:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Sorry.   trump keeps talking but never delivers.
1309513425366781953 2020-09-25 23:21:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What health care. trump keeps but never delivers.
1309511789546213377 2020-09-25 23:15:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @stuartpstevens Like Father like son. Look at the influence he has had.
1309511307184529410 2020-09-25 23:13:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @JTHVerhovek @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden @DrBiden @cspan A very emotional rendition from Opera Singer Denyce Graves, American Anthem - America, I gave my best to you. The trump administration can't say those words. They are going out of their way to give their worst to America. They can still turn that around but sadly they won't.
1309507746635673600 2020-09-25 22:59:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @GERALYNDOSSAN @JTHVerhovek @JoeBiden @DrBiden @cspan She holds a doctorate which gives her the title of Dr. Jill Biden. So what are you trying to say. It well known that she is in education and has always been. She has never professed to being an MD.
1309333871327092736 2020-09-25 11:28:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus I understand the Boogaloo Bois have been seen in Louisville for a few days.
1309304864950886401 2020-09-25 09:33:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 How evil and nasty.
1309304560029257732 2020-09-25 09:31:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse How are the players being protected from the trump virus or doesn't trump care?
1309294514218184704 2020-09-25 08:51:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Said by a true liar.
1309294192401747969 2020-09-25 08:50:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecAzar @WhiteHouse More Alex Azar lies. I really don't know how you lie so consistently i guess it takes years of practice.
1309293018055348225 2020-09-25 08:45:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Thanks but no thanks. I think trump is trying to kill the ones who didn't die from the trump virus.
1309292067491917827 2020-09-25 08:42:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What an evil lie. trump has no conscience at all.
1309291475587432448 2020-09-25 08:39:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse This is really funny trump was the first to incite violence and continues to this day. I watched him when he was running for pres. A man was holding a sign against trump and trump told the guy sitting next to him to "punch him in the mouth and i will pay your legal fees"
1309284325897252866 2020-09-25 08:11:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @ddale8 He needs to snort more Adderall.he has to watch that it doesn't fly out of his nose like last week.
1309281662337941504 2020-09-25 08:00:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @JenaGriswold @PressSec We have to give her a brake she's a little girl and knows not what she does.
1309280085070016513 2020-09-25 07:54:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Mark Meadows is a liar. Has been and probably always will be. I didn't think anyone took him seriously any more.
1309278854259847168 2020-09-25 07:49:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden You are just starting to think that now?
1309278574747287553 2020-09-25 07:48:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @FOX2News Thank you both for standing up for America.
1309258176697638913 2020-09-25 06:27:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @Yamiche @RepsForBiden The man is an evil SOB. I personally believe trump saw dollar signs with the Affordable Care Act and decided he wanted in. It does it bother him a bit that he is going to hurt the people who can least afford it  so trump can make money on them. Everything he does has $$$ for him
1309256430667608065 2020-09-25 06:20:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You evil SOB at this time when people are sick and have tremendous bills because of trump virus you are taking the only thing they have,the Affordable Care Act. So many people were hoping you would leave it alone until you're voted out and then there would be nothing you could do
1309254342319517699 2020-09-25 06:12:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What do your drugs cost you or do you get them from the cartel you are always chasing.
1309252754305617920 2020-09-25 06:05:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden That seems like a waste of time and money since you are going to let  Social Security and Medicare run out in 2023. You think we don't pay attention? We do!!
1309247049439809541 2020-09-25 05:43:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I was on the fence about a vaccine. it was going too fast. Then tRump opened his fat mouth about overruling FDA and he made my mind up for me. I will not have the vaccine injected in me. I have been successful so far wearing a mask, keeping social distance and washing my hands.
1309239906972073985 2020-09-25 05:14:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 What he doesn't realize is that he is only popular with the rich in fla. When Floridians lost their jobs because of trump theywent through hell trying to get unemployment some still haven't gotten it.DeSantis did not help these people at all. They said the computer system was old
1309236953565495296 2020-09-25 05:03:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Does trump support the taking of drugs? Especially snorting Adderall
1309223059505676293 2020-09-25 04:07:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump says "he doesn't know if the election can be honest"  the real question is how do we know if trump can be honest?  Since 2016 he has not been. Do we think he can change? No way in hell. And what about the 202,440 dead Americans. Can trump be honest as to how that happened.
1309220763635982336 2020-09-25 03:58:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @abbydphillip @RepsForBiden Lucky DeSantis. trump will be in Fla. tonight so DeSantis can do a whole lot of ASS KISSING and he will. He will also get his new orders especially how he can stop Mike Bloomberg.
1309218674478395393 2020-09-25 03:50:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden When Joe Biden is the president we will be able to breathe again.
1309215863539732482 2020-09-25 03:39:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Impeach tRump and kick that freeloading clan (the Hatfield &amp; McCoys) out of the peoples house.
1309214115655757825 2020-09-25 03:32:23 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump just said a TREMENDOUS number of people are turning out for him in Florida tonight. I know one person who won't show up. I believe a number of the people who do are paid actors. And then there are a lot of very rich here so who knows
1309212691903516672 2020-09-25 03:26:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Do your hearts go out to the family and friends of Breonna Taylor? What about the family and friends of the 202,404 human beings killed by the trump virus. No answer?of course not because the White House is full of heartless crooks.
1309211444672688130 2020-09-25 03:21:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @jeffgoldesq With everything trump has done, illegal or borderline illegal, is there any doubt that this happened? trump has unfortunately corrupted the Republican party. I am not sure they will ever be able to wash off the stench of trump.
1309206678949318660 2020-09-25 03:02:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast I guess I was not too far off posting this yesterday as I just found out that 2 employees of the right wing web site the Daily Caller were arrested at the protest yesterday in Louisville
1309202392345382912 2020-09-25 02:45:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump So donald trump i donated to a group months back to help the prisoners pay their fees. When your boy desantis had this put through i was outraged. I voted as did most of Florida to restore prisoners voting rights as long as they served their sentence. So am I a felon.? LOCK me up
1309196588645060611 2020-09-25 02:22:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @MaryLTrump Good for you Mary Trump.
1309196318334738433 2020-09-25 02:21:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse The radical right wing
1309182844758102016 2020-09-25 01:28:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @Yamiche According to trump. No one can tell him what to do he holds the highest position in government and can do what ever he wants. So if McConnell wants to keep his job he had better keep his mouth shut.
1309179376433532932 2020-09-25 01:14:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Does this mean you have changed you statement that mail ballots are rigged since you seem to promoting them here Also your home state is New York. I moved to Florida but was born and raised in New York the same as you. The difference is I am always welcome there and you are not.
1309176967598665732 2020-09-25 01:04:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @FOX2News Thank God someone is caring about the environment.
1309176220500873225 2020-09-25 01:01:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Vote the Autocrat out!
1309174040582643712 2020-09-25 00:53:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeathMayo @RepsForBiden Based on trumps performance so far what is any one supposed to believe?
1309172737999597571 2020-09-25 00:47:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis I pray that all Floridians are paying attention to Florida's Governor. Over and over he is doing tRumps bidding. He either has no knowledge or confidence to govern as he continuously bows to tRump. The good news is that he can be voted out of office in 2022. Will he go peacefully
1309158508529672194 2020-09-24 23:51:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 I could not believe trump had the audacity to show up. He certainly was notshowing respect. The Notorious RBG made it very plain what she thought of him. She made that last request because she knew what trump would try to do. Am I the only one who thinks trump is STARK RAVING MAD
1309156488645152771 2020-09-24 23:43:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli No one can anticipate what this mad man will do next. It breaks my heart to see the decline of our countryI have been voting for many years and sometimes my person gets in andsometimes not but NEVER has the President of the United States of America disrespected our constitution.
1309154512096186374 2020-09-24 23:35:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You must see what you are doing to the country you profess to love. You have convinced me that I can no longer consider myself a Republican. Thanks to you any decent white woman from the suburbs has to,in all good conscience, vote you out. And no TRUMP VACCINE.
1308936960627572737 2020-09-24 09:11:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden This is why I decided I could no longer be a part of the Republican Party. It is not the Republican Party I grew up with. The man in the White House has no respect for our country or the laws of our country. He says and does whatever he wants and encourages violence.
1308933338275684355 2020-09-24 08:56:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast I was watching Louisville after the AG gave the results of the grand jury. i saw cars with white guys getting out then a pick-up full of white guys went by. If there is violence tonight i believe it is far right winged Boogaloo Bois and White Supremacists. I might be wrong?
1308863765702742017 2020-09-24 04:20:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden All I see more and more is a president who is a blatant opportunist. If professing religion works he does that. If inciting citizens to act violent he does that. This man does not have the USA in his heart. Today is a prime example. He is just evil.
1308766722367905792 2020-09-23 21:54:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @MollyJongFast I think you are right!
1308619633604333569 2020-09-23 12:10:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I for one will be so happy to not hear the name donald trump, or to hear his voice or see that orange face. Beside being an idiot he is  extremely annoying.
1308602948025569281 2020-09-23 11:03:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump since trump has a good relationship with and admires putin so much he should move to russia so he can be closer to him. One bit of advise bring your own toilet paper.I was there about 10 yrs ago with my church They have very beautiful public rest rooms but no toilet paper
1308599668725686273 2020-09-23 10:50:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump The daughter of a man who passed from covid19 is starting a website for families and friends of covid victims. It is:          Marked by  https://t.co/vxRSAv42ZN  She said her dad said, before he died, that he never should have listened to donald trump
1308595612762415104 2020-09-23 10:34:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @briantylercohen She said "I will never lie to you"
1308595258477940737 2020-09-23 10:33:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder @RepsForBiden He is just a sneaky, slimy POS.he's a scam and a hoax who can never be trusted so it's no surprise that he tried to sneak a deal with castro. I bet trump was in awe of castro too.
1308592558818373632 2020-09-23 10:22:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @vickie_courson @ddale8 He had better not piss off a mob boss. They will take him down so fast he won't be able to cry he is being picked on or run to the bunket
1308578333387563008 2020-09-23 09:26:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The United Nations must have laughed their ass's off at you.we are leading the world in covid19 cases and deaths and  YOU failed the American people when you found out about this disease and hid it from us. How dare you take credit for anything except for the deaths you caused.
1308560876203585536 2020-09-23 08:16:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SecBrouillette @PeterNavarro45 Does anyone believe trump anymore about anything? Who would think a President  would be so callous about 200,000 citizens dead. He says that the only ones getting this disease are the elderly with underlying conditions. Does trump know he is describing himself? He's old and obese
1308557462283452417 2020-09-23 08:03:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP trump happened
1308537617122832386 2020-09-23 06:44:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Thenewmatthew @kylegriffin1 Maybe this way desantis can't contest it. I am sure desantis would come up with some law he either fabricated or dug up in some long ago rules not used anymore to say the money has to be donated. This is coming straight from trump because desantis doesn't think for himself.
1308531792929001473 2020-09-23 06:21:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA @RVAT2020 @PressSec No one has to make up lies about trump. He lies enough on his own.
1308529244750974983 2020-09-23 06:10:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @MaureenMcDowe14 @CUPCAKEWILLIAM6 @kylegriffin1 This is true. Republican Governor DeSantis did this and the voters are really upset. He is afraid Biden will get their votes and I for one hope he does. I am so sick of the Republicans doing whatever they want and not listen to the voters.
1308527268675940358 2020-09-23 06:03:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @wearevotingyes @RepsForBiden Maybe Kayne West will get ALL the votes and move into the white house. Do you think trump will object to that? We will see if trump is not racist then.
1308526417286701058 2020-09-23 05:59:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Sounds like they wanted the confederate flag up and trump would encourage that. Most of this trouble is from the far right anarchists and you know it!
1308525600492187652 2020-09-23 05:56:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @AJDelgado13 @MikeBloomberg Thank you. This trump boy desantis pulled all that behind the voters back. We voted overwhelming for people who have done their time to have their voting rights restored. The voters are really upset that desantis pulled this. He has 2 more years and then we can vote him out.
1308523977736847364 2020-09-23 05:50:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing Why do we still need PPE's if according to trump "the virus is going away and it only infects old people with underlying conditions" he said this last night. Does Pennsylvania only have sick old people?
1308522616513269762 2020-09-23 05:44:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trumps ex russian advisor says we are doing this to our selves. I don't know about anyone else but I really am sick putin and trumps relationship with him. trump refuses to tell putin to take the bounty off our soldiers. He makes it very clear that he likes putin.
1308521194463866881 2020-09-23 05:38:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @lachlan @RepsForBiden So the FBI telling the American people that the Russians are interfering in our elections again is not the truth Well thenwho do we trust. We have a president who lies to us all the time.We are losing family and friends to a virus that the president keeps denying.Where do we turn
1308497293453283330 2020-09-23 04:04:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 Good for you Bob. Our eyes are wide open and we see what trump is doing. I refuse to talk russian or live in a russian controlled country. I will go to Canada first
1308496081483976711 2020-09-23 03:59:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @MCmuckraker Republicans at it again. trump taught the republicans to lie cheat or steal whatever they want. That is the reason i will never vote republican again. They have become a very mean party like trump
1308495470629654534 2020-09-23 03:56:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @IvePetThatDog @TeamJoe @JoeBiden @DrBiden I am a huge dog lover!  They are so beautiful!
1308493934679789570 2020-09-23 03:50:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse When is trump going to tell putin to stop his interference in the US. What kind of president allows a communist country to infiltrate a free country. There is only one rational reason. trump want to be dictator. Look what he is doing. Now he wants the US to leave the UN. Why?
1308482404840071169 2020-09-23 03:04:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @PressSec Sorry dear but it's the radical right led by donald trump who has no regard for the Constitution or our country. And  200,000 dead Americans? Who of you even think about them.we who have lost a loved one think about them every day. What is so hard is that the president did this.
1308480583299985409 2020-09-23 02:57:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 It is not surprising that they are making up lies about you. That's all they can do so pity them for their ignorance. You were very brave to stand up to trump and do what you knew was right. There is no longer a conscience in the White House since trump moved in.
1308477874312302597 2020-09-23 02:46:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @Ifeanyi50247329 @StateDept @realDonaldTrump @UN Please don't use God's name in vain that is just sick.
1308477104732934144 2020-09-23 02:43:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @cindy_chojnicki @StateDept @realDonaldTrump @UN I actually have a physical reaction when i hear his voice or see his face.the reaction is nausea. It has gotten so bad that i have to quickly change the channel.
1308476060963672068 2020-09-23 02:39:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @End1913 @StateDept @realDonaldTrump @UN You people are really something. You are purposely trying to isolate US from the rest of the world. We have no allies left and now you want to leave the UN. I guess the only one that trump will talk to is putin. You are pushing this country closer and closer to a dictatorship
1308468690577391620 2020-09-23 02:10:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @rooprajfox2 @realDonaldTrump @FOX2News A Dr. Was on the show and made a comment about people using speed especially Adderall. So maybe the one making the accusation about Biden taking drugs should have a drug test himself and not from his Drs.but someone who is not involved.
1308455320935698432 2020-09-23 01:17:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @TroyMI_Police What a beautiful dog  I personally prefer dogs to people.
1308454902499348482 2020-09-23 01:15:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Absolutely not. tRump opened the door wide and invited putin in.
1308451017344913408 2020-09-23 01:00:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Never did trust him
1308446728761356290 2020-09-23 00:43:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Hey tRump call your dog putin off!!!
1308445990517641216 2020-09-23 00:40:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @adamslily Of course he did.
1308445516770967555 2020-09-23 00:38:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson @MSNBC Lindsey Graham is a trump ass.
1308445246246838283 2020-09-23 00:37:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Does someone help you with these lies or do you make them up yourself? Any thinking person sees your lies the others fall for them. That is why you made the statement in 2016 that you liked uneducated people.
1308444372049047552 2020-09-23 00:33:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse That is just another trump lie. Why would you lie about china? Because Xi refused to help you win the election why do you kiss putins ass because he IS helping you. He is again meddling in our elections and you being the sleeze you are won't stop it because its win anyway you can
1308442845557207041 2020-09-23 00:27:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I believe the russians are right up there with them. Look it up. Oh right you can't read. Well then find someone there in DC with half a brain and ask them what russia has been doing for a long time.
1308442121184120833 2020-09-23 00:24:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 It was obvious that his concern was with the rich in this county. They called him and told him he better not let the Stock Market fall and lose them money. After that that was what he was concerned with not the people getting sick and dying. He has no feeling for them.
1308441019067904010 2020-09-23 00:20:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse And don't forget putin and the russians undermining our democracy.
1308440602959376385 2020-09-23 00:18:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 Everything you are saying is so true. I was a healthcare provider for 35 years. I cared for patients with hep b&amp;c. Aids.infections etc.I knew what I was going into and had all the PPE's I needed to protect myself and my patients.I was horrified by what i saw through this pandemic
1308438270389432323 2020-09-23 00:09:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You are so full of shit. All your lying has caught up with you. People don't listen to you any more. Because you are a pathological liar.
1308437171871899648 2020-09-23 00:05:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer He now says the only ones getting the virus is the elderly with underlying conditions. WOW does anyone take that ass at his word?
1308420093576130560 2020-09-22 22:57:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Leslieoo7 Unfortunately this picture is not what all of florida or most of the nation looks like. The USA looks like a third world country when I see people on long food lines. The Republicans think helping these citizens gives them no incentive to work. So sad to treat Americans that way.
1308412877250981896 2020-09-22 22:28:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden The republicans have shown their position. They do not care about this country or it's people.All they care about is power. Keep the people down.Who doesn't see that republicans enable trump by turing a blind eye to his outrageous behavior. His close relationships with communists
1308408470366978049 2020-09-22 22:11:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Crazy trump is shooting his stupid mouth off again. What an idiot.
1308371177820377089 2020-09-22 19:42:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I understand this ass trump made racial comments last night telling people they come from "good stock"  he obviously thinks the arian race is the ruling race. That is why he bleaches his hair blond and why he never talks against White Supremacists and KKK.
1308254310954917888 2020-09-22 11:58:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar Another lie. Why is trump allowed to do this on twitter?
1308253850974015489 2020-09-22 11:56:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar Well his dad was arrested with the KKK. We know trump admires the White Supremacists. He is just a total asshole. Why did he calk the msnbc anchor being hit by a rubber bullet "a wonderful thing" the sick bastard.
1308252736199286784 2020-09-22 11:52:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar Why is he starting this crap again. It is an absolute lie.
1308251254095781888 2020-09-22 11:46:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan He is such a nasty evil old man who wants power. He and barr and trump should be charged with crimes against humanity
1308250610580545536 2020-09-22 11:43:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @BetteMidler Actually i think he should be locked away in a hospital on a ward for the criminally insane.
1308249970936631297 2020-09-22 11:41:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @DrAlGrossAK @RepsForBiden trump is such an evil denying asshole. He is responsible for all this death and heartache and doesn't even care.
1308249226250539008 2020-09-22 11:38:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @ConservBlue2020 No
1308233227585363970 2020-09-22 10:34:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @ShannonGroveCA @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @usbr @SecBernhardt All this crap that trump and friends are posting on here is to distract us from the virus. We have the most cases and the most deaths of any country in the world. We used to be leaders in the world, look at us now
1308230816523325440 2020-09-22 10:25:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump How many loved ones have you lost? Do you know the pain of knowing this virus was perpetrated by the president. That people we loved died needlessly because of him. We grew up believing the president was there to protect us not kill us. Times have changed no more innocence.
1308214594750513153 2020-09-22 09:20:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP How shallow can one human being be?
1308203791917948931 2020-09-22 08:37:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 trump has changed the fabric of the Republican party. It is no longer the party that i knew. trump has dragged the Republican party into the mud. I don't thing it will ever be the party i knew again.
1308196224206540802 2020-09-22 08:07:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP Because the Republican party has turned into a bunch of fools that think trump will give them the power over other people that they crave. When is the last time you have heard a Republican voice any concern for the 200,000 fellow citizens.
1308194414662217729 2020-09-22 08:00:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I saw 3 news programs that said all the anarchy is actually being perpetrated by the RADICAL FAR RIGHT! There have been arrests of these individuals.
1308193628213448704 2020-09-22 07:57:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @TimTebow Very nice now what about the 200,000 men, women and children dead from the virus?
1308190309843644417 2020-09-22 07:44:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @rooprajfox2 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sorry i do not watch fake fox news
1308189644576694272 2020-09-22 07:41:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Very nice to stand up for these children. I never saw any of this on the news but i will take your word for it. what about the 200,000 people dead and the family and friends they left behind through no fault of their but it is the fault o f barr and trump. Not one word for them
1308187595751460866 2020-09-22 07:33:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump What about the 200,000 dead because of trump? No one care about them or their mothers and fathers children brother and sisters.apparantly they mean nothing to any trump. You are all cold hearted. Don't post something like this to tell people you care because you don't.
1308154426193051652 2020-09-22 05:21:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @MariannaNBCNews @RepsForBiden @JoeBiden @shaqbrewster Why does Joe Biden do this? Because he respects peoples right to live. trump does not. This virus is just a big inconvenience to trump. He doesn't care how many die. I have yet to hear him have any remorse for all the people he killed.
1308152960334036998 2020-09-22 05:15:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @OJPgov @WhiteHouse What about helping the victims of the trump virus. Not only can we not be with our loved ones when they die we then have to figure out how to pay for a funeral. A lot of people left children behind that have to be taken care off. Who is caring about them.  Not Republicans!
1308151835291774976 2020-09-22 05:11:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @USMarshalsHQ Is this another trump lie. I never saw anything about this on local news. I would think this would have been a big story
1308148869163876352 2020-09-22 04:59:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @ClareGardens @StephenKing I was 17 when I joined the Womans Movement. We protested and occasionally were taken to jail. We protested civil rights and women's rights. Now it seems all that was done for nothing. The Republicans want women to be suburban house wives. We had Gloria Steinem on our side.
1308140303807807488 2020-09-22 04:25:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart It just shows what a low life he is  I can't wait for the trump clan (the hatfields and mccoys) to exit the White House. They should leave early so the WH can be fixed back up and thoroughly cleaned
1308139080375558144 2020-09-22 04:20:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @SecretaryCarson @ScottTurner45 Also this friend was a loser and a sucker because he spent 20 yrs in the military defending all of us including the draft dodger.
1308136787374673922 2020-09-22 04:11:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @nowthisnews @SenSchumer Everything Republicans want to take from us.
1308136476597682182 2020-09-22 04:10:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @ilyseh @SenSchumer We are dealing with the cheating Republican Party. They never say anything about putin either. They know russia helped trump get elected.
1308135279442747392 2020-09-22 04:05:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson Yrs he should! He is actually worse than trump. trump is stupid, barr is the mastermind so he is even more guilty.
1308134467618340870 2020-09-22 04:02:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @HillaryClinton I am voting early with mail in ballot. I will take it to the library which has a drop box. There are people from the election office overseeing the drop box.
1308130925616787463 2020-09-22 03:48:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich For as long as I can remember trump was hated in NYC. He was well known as a liar and a cheat. Why do you think he moved his address to Fla. He has an asshole Gov. that does what trump tells him.
1308125692786343937 2020-09-22 03:27:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @HillaryClinton Mitch McConnell is on tv lying just like trump. One by one we are finding out who are trumps enablers. He had the nerve say Kavanaugh was treated very badly.There are many people who think he was guilty of sexual harrassment but we don't get to voice our opinion. We have no voice
1308122971836420099 2020-09-22 03:16:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing Don't open anything from trump he may have found a way to slip some covid19 germs in there.  Happy Birthday!!!
1308122299439230976 2020-09-22 03:13:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @AmbJohnBolton @RepsForBiden Why do you think? It certainly was not for the good of the US.
1308119310821359616 2020-09-22 03:02:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @morethanmySLE Trump is an even bigger ass.
1308118867152121857 2020-09-22 03:00:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Save you first amendment. Vote for Biden
1308118612641800194 2020-09-22 02:59:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump There are 200,000 votes you won't get trump. They are the victims of covid19.
1308116518119583753 2020-09-22 02:50:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @SecretaryCarson @ScottTurner45 What a lie. For the last 3.5 years trump has done nothing except golf, tweet and watch tv. The american people for his inaction. I just found out another friend has succumbed to covid19. trump thinks my friend is a casuality of war. I truly believed he was murdered.
1308115345580810240 2020-09-22 02:46:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump and barr have outdone themselves with this latest insanity. Who do they think they are? They are going to charge NY, Seattle and Portland as terrorist cities and are withholding funds from them. What happened to our free country?
1307788975395004416 2020-09-21 05:09:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden trump spent the last 31/2 years golfing, tweeting, watching tv and being a general pain in the ass. Now on the eve of the elections trump is doing what he should have done years ago. Case in point Puerto Rico. He is  obviously just looking for votes. That's just cheap like him
1307784792369487873 2020-09-21 04:52:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump American people = russia, russia. russia  trump = china, china, china
1307775922620301318 2020-09-21 04:17:31 +0800 <dmhossley> John Dean just said "we are in an authoritative mode in this country".  That is very frightening. The closer trump gets to putin the worse it will get for us.
1307761204992114690 2020-09-21 03:19:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 He does hate the military because he is jealous. He was at all a draft dodger. Now he call soldiers losers and suckers. trump is the loser and sucker.
1307760489993244672 2020-09-21 03:16:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Two GOP Senators Murkowski and Collins support waiting until after the elections to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on supreme court. Thank you to two very brave women who have a conscience.
1307753123092615168 2020-09-21 02:46:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS September 20, 2020 Covid 19 USA  6,782,083.       Total cases  199,411.           Total deaths  ???soldiers killed by putins bounty.  All this death happened and is still happening on trumps watch. He says he loves this country. What would have happened if he hated this country?
1307750268898029576 2020-09-21 02:35:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan She knows right from wrong and I thank her for taking this position. Any decent Republican can't support trump in the replacing of RBG.  trump is a misogynist. trump said "I can grab them by the p***y." and other disgusting things about women.  RBG had no respect for trump.
1307739482624585736 2020-09-21 01:52:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Muchisimas Gracias
1307733510690689029 2020-09-21 01:29:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS Unbelievable. We have heard nothing from Melania all this time now she wants to help people. Why has she been silent while 200,000 Americans have died from covid 19? Does she have any empathy for the family and friends of ALL of these people?
1307731634553319427 2020-09-21 01:21:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @JackBrewerBSI @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Just amazing. Trump has shown his racist side over and over but now that he wants re election he uses people for his own agenda. The same as ignoring Puerto Rico since 2017 now helping them last minute. trump is so transparent.
1307700209540096001 2020-09-20 23:16:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Why wouldn't he? Lets just hope he doesn't have one of those press conferences from his country club later today?
1307698560775880704 2020-09-20 23:10:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @TinaJordanNYT Of course he is.
1307693000735240201 2020-09-20 22:48:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Why don't you worry about the people of America and the virus that is killing them every dayThe virus should be paramount and it is not. You will do anything even get involved in foreign affairs to take our minds off this virus that you allowed to become a pandemic. Country First
1307690933970927616 2020-09-20 22:39:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It is ironic that trump uses Nixon's words "law &amp; Order. Those words mean exactly the same thing to both = cheating and lying. The difference is that Nixon still loved our country and left office to preserve it. Whereas trump is perfectly willing to tear this country apart
1307493999628951554 2020-09-20 09:37:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 I thought it was herd mentality.
1307391236265836545 2020-09-20 02:48:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @Catheri75157424 @Leslieoo7 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump The real question is are you going to take care of all the unwanted babies that are born because of narrow minded people? If these millions of babies that you talk about are born and the mothers are young and can't support them who will? How many unwed mothers have you taken in?
1307388745201614850 2020-09-20 02:39:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Did you have an abortion? No? Because you are a man. What the hell do you know about being a woman facing such a decision? Many men don't stick around when they find out the impregnated a woman. She is then facing fear and shame alone. So keep your feelings of animus to yourself.
1307341224962125825 2020-09-19 23:30:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Jaime Harrison just said - his dad told him that a man is only as good as his word. Lindsey Graham are you listening?
1307335349773963266 2020-09-19 23:06:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom This is why Republicans are defecting. The Republican party is becoming more like trump in they are also moving toward an Authoritative State. Mitch McConnel and Barr act like little dictators.
1307312964844883968 2020-09-19 21:37:54 +0800 <dmhossley> Should the vacancy created by the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg be filled by President Trump and the current Senate?  https://t.co/l34WMyQgLM
1307127404306083843 2020-09-19 09:20:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @MysterySolvent I think every woman in America is heart broken and evey man who loves a woman feels our pain.
1307125676672200704 2020-09-19 09:13:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsjustbri3 @morethanmySLE @DevinCow But then trump will have the feds hit us with heat rays as he runs down in the bunker
1307116457831157761 2020-09-19 08:37:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 What a great woman. She was thinking of us even on her death bed.
1307115915037888513 2020-09-19 08:34:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @clairecmc I feel the same. My fear is that Kavanaugh will push to do away with  all that we fought for in the 60's and 70's for women and womens reproductive rights.
1307108518898667526 2020-09-19 08:05:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer You know trump will not let that happen. He will jump on this right away to get his man in.
1307107815216029698 2020-09-19 08:02:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse This is lie number ?. You refused to help Puerto Rico in 2017. Now when you are desperate for Hispanic votes in Fla. you pull this. All the people in Fla. Know who you are and we want rid of you and your lies and cheating. And by the way we have enough orange in Fla.
1307103842882985984 2020-09-19 07:46:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @danabrams I am so sorry. She had an amazing life and will be sorely missed. She was such a voice of reason.
1307102727944785921 2020-09-19 07:42:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Puerto Rico has been desperate for help since 2017. Your a bit late don't you think trump? You just realized you need the Puerto Rican vote. You are so transparent.
1307084329038815232 2020-09-19 06:29:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Biden supporters believe that Black Lives Matter.  According to trump they should all be put in jail
1307082365559336967 2020-09-19 06:21:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Why isn't twitter censuring him?
1307081224364740608 2020-09-19 06:17:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @ryanstruyk @RepsForBiden I am very proud to be among my sisters in this group and against trump
1307080537560027142 2020-09-19 06:14:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I think he is already thought of as the worst President the US has ever had. Worse than Nixon. As Woodward told trump history is being written. of course trump doesn't care because he can't read.
1307079715631628288 2020-09-19 06:11:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Why didn't you do that a long time ago trump. Oh yes you don't give a damn about Puerto Rico unless it would mean votes. Puerto Ricans suffered all this time and you ignored them.
1307077983883218946 2020-09-19 06:04:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse So trump has decided not to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland. trump will lie cheat and steal to win this election.. I am pretty sure our Puerto Rican citizens remember how they were treated during hurricane and floods.
1307053341529251842 2020-09-19 04:26:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @atrupar Wow he could pass for an orange here in Fla.
1307051400824852481 2020-09-19 04:18:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Wishful thinking. trump only had time to twitter and watch tv and golf. Now all of a sudden he is doing things he should have been doing all along. Example - puerto rico.
1307050760350429190 2020-09-19 04:15:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @fema Here we go again. Why didn't you care about Puerto Rico for the past 4 years? You are the one who said you would like to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland. You are only doing things to get re elected then you will go back to being a do nothing President. Have you no shame?
1307045778188382209 2020-09-19 03:56:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What's up with this? Are people not dying fast enough from the virus. Now you want to fast track a vaccine without proving it is safe. trump you take the first dose
1306997688077090818 2020-09-19 00:45:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump This is a false and deceptive post.
1306996227087708160 2020-09-19 00:39:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @MikeBloomberg @RepsForBiden trump, maybe Mike Bloomberg will give you a job when you leave office in Jan. And then again maybe he won't
1306995529474338819 2020-09-19 00:36:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @MikeBloomberg @RepsForBiden tRump why don't you stop the silly, childish name calling it is so beneath the office of the President of the United States. I am surprised one of your many advisors haven't told you that. And leave Mike Bloomberg alone. You are so jealous of him because he is wealthier than you.
1306993800422846466 2020-09-19 00:29:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @EllenLWeintraub @HillaryClinton No, no, no. False, untrue, get it donald?
1306992613434810375 2020-09-19 00:24:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Actually, if trump had any morals at all he would do what the other cheating, lying,  Law &amp; Order President, Nixon, did and leave.
1306989952123764740 2020-09-19 00:14:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are so full of shit donald. Come up with something else we've all heard this song before. It is boring now.
1306989417677160449 2020-09-19 00:12:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Thank you!!!!
1306989178467635202 2020-09-19 00:11:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump More deceit from the trump admin. CDC testing guidance  sidestepped normal review process.
1306985221548576768 2020-09-18 23:55:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @martyconiglio Empathetic
1306984404682764290 2020-09-18 23:52:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump is such an ass. He has "failed badly" with the covid 19. Obama, Biden did not have 200,000+ deaths on their hands like trump does.
1306983115437506565 2020-09-18 23:47:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump is demented  He does not see beyond himself. The people will let him know what they think of him on 11/3/00.
1306982410014294018 2020-09-18 23:44:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump has had almost 4 yrs to do things and all he has done is make the rich richer and allowed a virus to run wild through our country
1306981234921402371 2020-09-18 23:39:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @56blackcat I support Joe Biden.
1306980863608053762 2020-09-18 23:38:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecWilkie @WhiteHouse @DeptVetAffairs Just so you know - non of our military are loser's or suckers and our POW's gave so much and are our hero's
1306966810969993218 2020-09-18 22:42:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @jpalmiotti @RepsForBiden Broward County, Fla. Teachers union does not trust Gov. DeSantis to tell the truth as far as getting schools open.  He hid information on positive cases in children. I have for awhile thought that  DeSantis is just an errand boy for trump. Care about children not so much.
1306963327185309696 2020-09-18 22:28:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Who wrote this? We know trumps position on POW's. He likes people who don't get caught. Can anyone forget his horrible depiction of John McCane?
1306955627491659776 2020-09-18 21:57:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @HKrassenstein That's funny!
1306955061243904000 2020-09-18 21:55:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden They look like Biden supporters to me.
1306954434761588740 2020-09-18 21:53:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trustworthy.
1306946685822697472 2020-09-18 21:22:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @MarshallCohen @RepsForBiden The judge just came to the conclusion that we have known for awhile.
1306945485601726466 2020-09-18 21:17:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @MCmuckraker @GovWhitmer @dananessel That's what the republican party has turned into thanks to trump. They are the ones who show up with guns strapped to their chests. They are the ones being violent.
1306944576943542273 2020-09-18 21:14:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @clairecmc True the difference is that Biden can read and trump can't.
1306944050449330183 2020-09-18 21:11:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @RadioFreeTom The difference between VP Biden and trump is: The VP knows the oval office and is respected by our allies  trump does not and is writing his sit com as he goes along and has no respect from our allies not even russia.
1306941990467178496 2020-09-18 21:03:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RBReich We can never take anything for granted. Tricky trump most likely has more crap up his sleeve.
1306941320418689029 2020-09-18 21:01:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 That is the big question. What was in it for trump. He never does anything unless he is getting something in return. Why kill so many people
1306940524637679616 2020-09-18 20:57:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d I sure hope you are right  I am so sick of trumps face and voice
1306939849199493120 2020-09-18 20:55:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan VP Biden certainly lifted my spirits. There is so much negative coming out of the White House that I really appreciated Joe Biden and his calmness and the hope he gives me for the future.
1306938782072139782 2020-09-18 20:51:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am not sure trump likes anything but himself. Close second could be putin
1306801442091655173 2020-09-18 11:45:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @sabrinasingh24 @JoeBiden trump also has made it very clear that he is only president to red states. There has never been a president in this country that said he only will do for red states and denigrates blue states.I wonder did trump change his oath of office to say "I am only president to republicans"
1306798028175667203 2020-09-18 11:31:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @sabrinasingh24 @JoeBiden donald trump doesn't understand because he is an egocentric maniac who only listens to himself.
1306796105359818752 2020-09-18 11:24:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Acyn Trump is such an ass.
1306795890066092033 2020-09-18 11:23:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RadioFreeTom @RepsForBiden And there were no drugs involved.
1306795128682618880 2020-09-18 11:20:12 +0800 <dmhossley> The russians said a Biden Presidency would be an anti russian establishment. Well I would hope so. The russians are not our allies. They never have been and never will be. I don't know what putin promised trump in Helsinki but I am sure it wasn't anything good for the USA
1306789767560953858 2020-09-18 10:58:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @CBSNews @SenSchumer The reason is because trump does not know what he is doing. He just rambles on with non sensible nonsense. When he is kicked out of the White House maybe he can take his clan and move in with his buddies the White Supremacists.
1306785208373514242 2020-09-18 10:40:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It is undeniable trump is so jealous of President Obama.
1306784645657374726 2020-09-18 10:38:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump is such an ass.
1306784073776590855 2020-09-18 10:36:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Spoken like a real American president. You exude hope and a future. I for one am exhausted from all trumps hateful rhetoric and his fear mongering. I long for our kinder and gentler country.
1306781930910814209 2020-09-18 10:27:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse I would suggest that you and trump sit down and read the constitution. Actually you will have to read it to trump since he can't read and you can explain it to him because he does not have a clue of what the constitution is about.
1306780573747290113 2020-09-18 10:22:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump is a jealous little man. He can't be Joe Biden because he doesn't have what it takes. First of all he would have to have human feelings like compassion and empathy. He is devoid of those attributes.Joe Biden is the man we want and need for president. Not a white supremacist
1306770764310491138 2020-09-18 09:43:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Your the one who is going to do that? donald trump all you know how to do is kill people almost 200,000 of our family and friends and you do not even care. You are just not human. Too bad you don't have the empathy that VP Biden has.
1306754424929386502 2020-09-18 08:38:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @BougieBlackGurl @TeamJoe Thank you for saying that. VP Biden will be the peoples president.
1306745984244948992 2020-09-18 08:04:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @frequentbuyer1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Good for Mom!
1306745513459486723 2020-09-18 08:03:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You are thanking them for cleaning up your mess?
1306745263676063744 2020-09-18 08:02:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have to buy the book. If trump says it's bad it must be great. Trump didn't sound like  he thought the book was bad. we are not interested in the middle east or anything other than the virus that we now know he allowed to get so out of hand. So much death. He really doesn'tcare
1306733064039604231 2020-09-18 07:13:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Is trump shaking hands with those "disgusting people" that showed up at his rally tonight. It is such a shame that trump has such little regard for peoples lives.
1306728321347137539 2020-09-18 06:54:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @QAnominus @maggieNYT @OliviaTroye Keith kellogg says that trump has tried to have a positive outlook on the virus. Does he think 197,000 + dead Americans is positive?
1306726743986909186 2020-09-18 06:48:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What is pence trying to say? That none of us have been educated properly? I just do not know how I earned a Masters Degree being so poorly educated. Or maybe he is saying our children should be taught the racist BS that trump puts forth no thank you.
1306722258065518592 2020-09-18 06:30:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump News flash trump and barr. Not ALL Americans are criminals like you are trying to say. I am not so sure about you though. And I understand that barr has never tried a case so maybe he should keep his mouth shut about taking out criminal charges against any American.
1306718825136652290 2020-09-18 06:17:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @Leslieoo7 @RepsForBiden I think you are right. I very seldom saw Hillary signs. There were quite a few trump signs in my neighborhood in 2016 and today there is not one.
1306717683216535552 2020-09-18 06:12:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @ONDCP @WhiteHouse @FLOTUS @ManchesterFD @realDonaldTrump I don't get it. The trumps have had almost 4 years to do good and they did nothing. Now they want re election and they are going out of their way to act like they care about our country.
1306716673119080448 2020-09-18 06:08:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @Steve987650 @TheRickWilson Maybe you are right. I don't get that sense in Tampa. It could just be wishful thinking on my part but I have a lot of veteran friends and they have turned completely against trump.
1306713715010609163 2020-09-18 05:56:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @Steve987650 @TheRickWilson The trump campaign in florida is not happy. trump thought he had Florida and is finding out he doesn't.
1306711660208496640 2020-09-18 05:48:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @SarahLongwell25 @RVAT2020 @MilesTaylorUSA @NeuSummits @OliviaTroye They are true patriots. They see wrong and speak up.
1306709402658000897 2020-09-18 05:39:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @Timodc @RVAT2020 Well, trump and barr want to remove the first amendment. They will do just that if they have another 4 years. They are taking us closer and closer to an Authoritative State.If Americans want to hold on to our freedom we have to get rid of these boneheads
1306708061546074117 2020-09-18 05:34:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @KellyO There are an awful lot of disgruntled people around the White House. I wonder why.
1306700643852341249 2020-09-18 05:04:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Wow he is so high.
1306700443268120581 2020-09-18 05:03:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Does he even have the right to mess with the education of our children? If so that could be a big problem.
1306699766475239427 2020-09-18 05:01:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Most people are not hearing trump anymore. He is just too crazy. We are looking forward to watching CNN Town Hall with Joe Biden tonight.
1306698596834828290 2020-09-18 04:56:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I have never heard a President of the USA talk such nasty nonsense about the citizens he serves. trump wants to distort history and divide our country. Hr doesn't get it. He works for us not the other way around.
1306692803209179139 2020-09-18 04:33:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I have been saying to friends that there are so many more Biden signs than trump signs here in Florida. I think it has to do with the Senior Citizens not trusting trump.
1306691615902367744 2020-09-18 04:28:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson I bet they are not happy. Trump is going to have a hard time winning Florida. And his boy desantis is going to have a hard time being re elected as gov.
1306691055836897294 2020-09-18 04:26:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What about their being ashamed of an American president?
1306690771123347459 2020-09-18 04:25:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 @OliviaTroye @VP Thank you Olivia. You are very brave. Bravo!
1306689167846449181 2020-09-18 04:19:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @ceejay410 Oh i am sorry. Their is only one person that is a liar and that is trump.
1306688798399623169 2020-09-18 04:17:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why would anyone listen to donald trump on American history when he shirked his duty to serve in the military. This is the fool who called our heroic military losers and suckers. And HE CAN'T READ.
1306687166135836692 2020-09-18 04:11:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @ceejay410 Liar
1306684608839323649 2020-09-18 04:01:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @AmoneyResists @JoeBiden I really would like to tear down those hideous gold drapes in the White House.
1306683661878689792 2020-09-18 03:57:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why don't you take the time to read it.
1306683258437017601 2020-09-18 03:55:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @SistahScholar You and a lot of others. If he were my son he would be sent to the bunker without dinner.
1306682697692196872 2020-09-18 03:53:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @JasonMillerinDC He needs to lay off the Adderall
1306681675410280448 2020-09-18 03:49:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @43Biden @RepsForBiden There is good reason the world does not trust trump. He is a liar.
1306681300259090433 2020-09-18 03:47:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Where people like trump never owned slaves. It is unforgivable for a president of the USA to be so racist.
1306680804605595651 2020-09-18 03:45:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What does that entail teaching racist BS to our children?  Between trump and barr slavery never happened. Another QAnon conspiracy.
1306679452823322628 2020-09-18 03:40:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump knows the truth as he votes by mail in Florida. He is absolutely terrified of losing. I have to wonder why is he willing to go to such extremes to win. What is he afraid of? That Americans will find out what a fraud he is.
1306678542936281097 2020-09-18 03:36:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Just out. Trump has completely lost his mind. He looks like he is melting. Shouldn't a doctor look at him?
1306678206687334400 2020-09-18 03:35:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Just out. Trump is insane.
1306678041163300867 2020-09-18 03:34:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Another trump lie. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to do away with Social Security and Medicare. If he does that who will take care of the elderly? Their children?
1306646531538386946 2020-09-18 01:29:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How are you lowering Medicare premiums by eliminating Medicare?
1306645660196900867 2020-09-18 01:26:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I imagine there are quite a few as I think it is probably the only way he can get a woman.
1306605729130913803 2020-09-17 22:47:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I wonder who trump is taking his marching orders from: putin or barr
1306603454362722306 2020-09-17 22:38:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom Is that how trump won? By cheating?
1306602957610385408 2020-09-17 22:36:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I can hardly wait for CNN's Town Hall with soon to be President Joe Biden at 8:00 pm tonight. After all trumps insanity of the past few days it will be so nice to listen to a voice of reason.
1306600950111571970 2020-09-17 22:28:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @morningshowca @carolynglobal @jmacspeaks When one goes high the other goes low.
1306600550553841664 2020-09-17 22:27:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Why is this administration telling citizens to make sure they have plenty of ammunition?  Are they planning on a take over of America? In all my years I have never heard such a warning from the Government.
1306596859629109248 2020-09-17 22:12:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @MichelleObama @BarackObama President Obama has been and still is a great patriot. Unlike the man in the White House now, President Obama always remembered that the American people were who he worked for and he always wanted the best for us. trump is bringing this country down by dividing us.
1306579781014761474 2020-09-17 21:04:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @TheRickWilson Dr. Redfield , please don"t succumb to trumps BS. Keep telling us the truth.
1306578722758242305 2020-09-17 21:00:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @BarackObama I can't wait to read it. Trump has had enough attention with books that have been written.
1306578266891976705 2020-09-17 20:58:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @MilesTaylorUSA President or not there should be a law protecting our elections from trump. Hr is banking on people not voting because of his interference . maybe  they will be republicans. I raised 3 boys and if they acted like trump and embarrassed our family they would be grounded for life.
1306576829218725888 2020-09-17 20:52:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @chipfranklin I remember the Nixon era. He did  nothing compared to trump  At least nixon had the courage to step down when he saw what was happening to our country. This ass we have now just goes on destroying  everything and dividing our country
1306575022996303872 2020-09-17 20:45:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Not everything is about donald trump.
1306574737452273664 2020-09-17 20:44:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse What a terrible person you are. When you took the oath of office did you only promise to take care of red states? Does it occur to you there are also republicans living in blue states? No one matters to you but yourself.
1306427368274264064 2020-09-17 10:58:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse When i think trump could be any worse I find out that federal officials asked if they could use heat rays on the peaceful protestors in Lafayette park so trump could have his photo op. Heat rays cause burning sensations on the skin. What the hell is this Russia?
1306420676363014144 2020-09-17 10:32:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse The president has made it clear today that he is only a president to the red states not the blue states. That makes him half of a president. News flash trump This is the united states of America. What happens if he gets mad at a "red" state?
1306398648331374592 2020-09-17 09:04:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Sounds like Kanye is hanging out with trump too much.
1306379789423575041 2020-09-17 07:49:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSupport @jack @POTUS I was suspended for saying trump has committed treason. I guess the little bitch trump complained. It's ok now that i know we are censured and trump is not but i think i can still call him an asshole.
1306378440808038401 2020-09-17 07:44:26 +0800 <dmhossley> Tim murtaugh has it wrong it is tRump who is scaring people away from wanting a vaccine that he has named operation warp speed. As soon as trump said that i said i don't want any vaccine that will be made at warp speed.
1306377525837402114 2020-09-17 07:40:48 +0800 <dmhossley> Tim Murtaugh is an lying idiot. He just goes on and on with BS. trump will keep him because he has no problem being a trump liar.
1306375357646462976 2020-09-17 07:32:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @JonLemire @Used_To_Be_GOP If doing what he has done as president is the best he could do then he should resign.
1306374373486596096 2020-09-17 07:28:16 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump is so crazy now he blames the blue states for high virus death toll. He apparently does not think he is president to ALL of the states just republican states. He has said more than once that he will do nothing for blue states.  He is an illegitimate president..
1306371954719555584 2020-09-17 07:18:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I must have been asleep and missed when trump earned his medical degree.
1306342026217168896 2020-09-17 05:19:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @ValerieJarrett trump supporters.
1306341172357496837 2020-09-17 05:16:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @FEMA_Pete @WhiteHouse @POTUS @GovRonDeSantis @fema trump approved desantis's request because he is a republican governor. That is why desantis stay trumps boy. This is so wrong of a president to do. He feels democrats can just suffer.
1306339861897637888 2020-09-17 05:11:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @kaitlancollins The only reason she said that is because she didn't prepare for that question and could not come up with a lie that fast.
1306333385804185603 2020-09-17 04:45:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Good Lord i hope not. She is just a female version of trump
1306332852817145858 2020-09-17 04:43:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZerlinaMaxwell These fools are the ones having covid parties with no masks or social distancing. I understand the selfishness of young people but this is a different time and they have to grow up faster.
1306286075720200197 2020-09-17 01:37:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Lock him up!
1306285822832979971 2020-09-17 01:36:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart Not a word to putin but he did say our soldiers are losers and suckers.
1306285043988533248 2020-09-17 01:33:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecAzar @WhiteHouse @CDCgov You are still going to have to convince the American people to have the vaccine. trump has been saying it will be here before election day. He has run his mouth so much about HIS vaccine that the public is very skeptical.
1306283896586280962 2020-09-17 01:28:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump And I am not making a mistake now CRAZY DONALD.
1306277248358666241 2020-09-17 01:02:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 Actually he is from Queens,New York. I was born and raised in New York City and I can assure you he was not liked by anyone there. He had a very bad reputation for being a liar and a cheat.
1306275146311839744 2020-09-17 00:53:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan @Twitter Right, trump should be held to the same standards that we are. They suspended me because I said trump committed treason.
1306274334370082816 2020-09-17 00:50:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @TeaPainUSA It must be a side effect of herd mentality.
1306272934269509694 2020-09-17 00:45:11 +0800 <dmhossley> This endorsement is a very big deal!
1306238510853169152 2020-09-16 22:28:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 Why would he? He was a draft dodger so he has zero knowledge of the military except that every military person has to salute him which boosts his ego.
1306237833334714369 2020-09-16 22:25:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Trump will need an extra dose of courage.
1306237437581111296 2020-09-16 22:24:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse This from an openly racist president. Trump is so disgusting and a LIAR
1306236847098531840 2020-09-16 22:21:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Does trump really believe the NFL is more important to citizens than the VIRUS. If he does he is much more out of touch than people think.
1306220019852996609 2020-09-16 21:14:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @ConservBlue2020 I have been using a mask all along and won't stop now so yes I would support a national mask mandate. The only people I have run into who won't wear a mask are trump supporters. Not surprising.
1306209733796343808 2020-09-16 20:34:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @GStephanopoulos George tried a few times to call trump out on something and trump just talked over him and never answered George.
1306208815151558658 2020-09-16 20:30:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @Scaramucci Unfortunately some are that stupid and will follow him no matter what.
1306208263415967745 2020-09-16 20:28:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @reedgalen @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters have a herd mentality, but why would trump know that?   I hope he went home and looked it up because he certainly did not know what it meant in his town hall.
1306061902007631880 2020-09-16 10:46:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d @RepsForBiden I also remember a time when you would never call a president some of the names this ass is called. There used to be respect for the office of the Presidency. I believe we will bring back that respect when Joe Biden is in the office.
1306045976138911744 2020-09-16 09:43:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What an Ass.
1306045660387573760 2020-09-16 09:42:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP @abcnews Sorry, I watched about 15 min. and had to turn it off. Trump is just being trump. He never answers the question just rambles on and on about how wonderful he is doing. And all this " all these people tell me" who the hell are all these people he never answers that.
1306042854914043906 2020-09-16 09:30:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump No wonder you are obese look at all that food you are going to devour.
1306042242717700098 2020-09-16 09:28:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump really should not do town halls again. The idea of it is for people to ask questions. He never answered anyone's questions he just rambled on with the same old bs and then blame others. How many times did he say Obama and Biden.
1306041192182841351 2020-09-16 09:24:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @Used_To_Be_GOP I tried to watch and decided it was a waste of my time. trump just keeps lying and then patting himself on the back. I feel bad for turning it off because I really like George, but even he can't control trump.
1306019616142110721 2020-09-16 07:58:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan That's because trump is a cheap dick.
1306014190314889217 2020-09-16 07:37:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Well then trump tell your people to do their jobs.
1306013675996753921 2020-09-16 07:34:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @MelisaFranzen @TeamJoe @JoeBiden Trumps treatment of Puerto Rico is just hateful. VP Biden will help Puerto Rico get back on it's feet.
1306009817530728449 2020-09-16 07:19:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump hates our military heros because they are what he can never be. What he is is a draft dodger and is jealous of others who have actually worked to protect our country.
1305996400904343555 2020-09-16 06:26:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @MelisaFranzen @TeamJoe @JoeBiden It was abhorrent the way trump treated the people of Puerto Rico during emergencies. Then had the audacity to make the statement that he "would like to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland."  What an ass.
1305993234766848002 2020-09-16 06:13:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer There is very disturbing Hispanic women in custody at ICE detention centers have been taken to a Gynecologist and given hysterectomies. I wonder was ICE ordered to do this by trump. If so then he is more evil than anyone knows. These women had no medical problems reasons for this
1305991057713303552 2020-09-16 06:05:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You have many fantasies roaming around in your head. This is just one of them.
1305989352837742594 2020-09-16 05:58:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Just another trump photo op. Why doesn't trump try to end the pandemic in this country?
1305986040348499969 2020-09-16 05:45:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @jefftimmer If you believe that trump then drop out.
1305985551879864321 2020-09-16 05:43:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump What kind of insane president orders hysterectomies on woman at an ICE Detention center? Is this the actions of a Pro Life president? It sounds Hitler like to me
1305981181507313664 2020-09-16 05:25:52 +0800 <dmhossley> Who in hell wants a president who is so desperate to remain in power that he will say and do anything? Nothing is beneath him. I really believe that he cheated with the russians help in 2016 and he is doing it again. He let a virus kill so many because of his lies.
1305978757178687496 2020-09-16 05:16:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump is so vile and disgusting.
1305976288142929920 2020-09-16 05:06:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Don't take a bow yet trump.this has been going on for many years you did not change anything today except show off an you certainly are good at that. What are you doing about the virus?
1305975505607430145 2020-09-16 05:03:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RNicholasBurns @RepsForBiden Trump is not trust worthy. Trump is a disgusting person. trump has no respect for anyone and that includes leaders of other nations. He has a sick infatuation for putin and kim jong un.
1305973146705686528 2020-09-16 04:53:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It was not that long ago that trump said he was going to "get them all out of this country, and not let any in" because Hispanics are ALL rapists, murderers and thieves. Who does that sound like?
1305970258650464259 2020-09-16 04:42:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @thehill This has to be a false statement. I am a lifelong Catholic and no Catholic Church would endorse trump or oppose VP Biden. If this is a true statement then name the Church. That is only fair
1305969028050100225 2020-09-16 04:37:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Thurs. Sept. 15, 2020 Covid 19 Cases &amp; Deaths USA  6,590,827.         Total Cases  195,386.            Total Deaths  ???soldiers killed because of putins bounty.  Shame on YOU. donald trump this is all your fault
1305965151296815105 2020-09-16 04:22:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse The shame is  trump will put on a show like this not because he cares but for the attention.Too bad he doesn't care about America and try to bring us together as a healthy and content nation. Instead he divides us and encourages more virus to spread with his irresponsible actions
1305963692299890688 2020-09-16 04:16:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovCTW @RsAndIs4Biden Oh yes, very mature and presidential The worst part is that I don't think trump has a clue.
1305963117759860737 2020-09-16 04:14:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @ProjectLincoln Thank you.
1305962566770978818 2020-09-16 04:11:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse What in hell is enmity?
1305961896839913476 2020-09-16 04:09:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump has no respect for anyone. Lately it seems he is even losing respect for himself. He doesn't take care of his appearance, that is usually the first sign of depression.
1305960904463446018 2020-09-16 04:05:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The only thing I see is trump &amp; clan destroying more of the White House with chairs digging into the grass. But of course what do they care?
1305958123681853442 2020-09-16 03:54:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @RVAT2020 It is obvious that trump doesn't care about the people and has no respect for anyone but himself.
1305957152352350210 2020-09-16 03:50:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump alines himself with White Supremacists, KKK, Boogaloo Bois and other radical right groups.
1305955632844070917 2020-09-16 03:44:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Well at least he is among his own kind.
1305954744163135488 2020-09-16 03:40:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan It just shows everyone how ignorant trump is.
1305953857923698695 2020-09-16 03:37:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Did he take his meds today?

1305891521477177346 2020-09-15 23:29:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump We don't want to, trump. Americans still have their rights despite you trying to take them away from us.
1305889642869329920 2020-09-15 23:22:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmurraypolitics @RepsForBiden No
1305888253598470145 2020-09-15 23:16:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden As of this morning he is still lying.
1305883166671069184 2020-09-15 22:56:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump White Supremacists are most lethal threat of terrorism to America says Elizabeth Neumann. This group is a far right winged group that trump downplays as he does with Russia.
1305863830036152324 2020-09-15 21:39:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I had an epiphany listening to trump talk about Charlottesville. That was when i realized he was a racist , bigot.
1305714810890395648 2020-09-15 11:47:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @jayblackisfunny @RepsForBiden trump said today,when he was talking to GOV Newsom about climate change, it's going to get colder????
1305713631703769089 2020-09-15 11:42:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli @RepsForBiden Because they know better!
1305713139372175360 2020-09-15 11:40:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden They know this is all trump.When he attended the World Summit in Jan 2018 he showed his ridiculous self. The World started laughing at HIM. They know VP Biden and will resume relationships with him and the USA again. I pray for all our sakes this is what happend.
1305613248134348801 2020-09-15 05:03:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis @floridachannel Why are you ordering counties in Florida to hide covid 19 data on children?You should be giving this information to parents so they can make an educated decision about their children's educationThe information should not contain  personal information but withholding this is wrong
1305587172867743744 2020-09-15 03:20:13 +0800 <dmhossley> This shows that trump is getting really desperate.

1305573856661458949 2020-09-15 02:27:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump just can't get out of his own psychotic mind. He says the wild fires in Calif. Is because they don't pick up trees that fall or rake the leaves. No mention of climate change. What happened last Jan. in Australia did they not rake the leaves?
1305565964386349058 2020-09-15 01:55:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump donald trump you can get your sharpie out there is finally a hurricane heading to Alabama.
1305328712737529857 2020-09-14 10:13:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart They really are a cult and trump is the cult leader. The whole scene is reminiscent of jim jones.
1305289601582608384 2020-09-14 07:37:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden The CEO of Pfizer said people do not trust the vaccine. He said he will tell Americans the TRUTH as they develope the vaccine. He said you can't expect them to believe you if you don't. I guess trump never thought of that. The ass lied to us from the beginning
1305284737473425409 2020-09-14 07:18:27 +0800 <dmhossley> Trump just accused Biden and Obama of treason on CNN. I was censured for saying trump was commiting treason.
1305282432946581506 2020-09-14 07:09:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Has the price of Adderall gone down?
1305280200477990913 2020-09-14 07:00:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @Readygov @WhiteHouse Don't give trump a sharpie. Sharpiegate.
1305255893081239555 2020-09-14 05:23:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @gtconway3d WHAT? ?????
1305246984345915392 2020-09-14 04:48:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @John16280 @anniekarni True and he gets really confused when they all talk at once.
1305246345687597056 2020-09-14 04:45:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden It is just amazing how trump has perfected lying, but then he has spent a lifetime working at it. He says he cares about the latino's and Biden doesn't. Trump used and abused latino workers in New York. He did and still does want to stop Latino's from immigrating to US.
1305223985320398850 2020-09-14 03:17:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse His solutions are to take Social Security and Medicare from senior citizens. Trump has called it an entitlement. News flash trump. Workers have been paying in to Social Security since 1937 you do not have the right to take it away. Many senior citizens are very upset with trump.
1305182847574200327 2020-09-14 00:33:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Telling the truth is Joe Biden's reputation in Government.  Lying and cheating about everything is trumps reputation in Government
1305182036102127617 2020-09-14 00:30:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @LindseyGrahamSC Why wasn't he thrown off the flight? Does he walk on water? Why are there different rules for different people in this country?
1305181413575192578 2020-09-14 00:27:52 +0800 <dmhossley> Navarro is on Jake Tappers program lying through his teeth. Same old crap it's the Democrats fault. Does the man have any shame at all. He sounds like a complete idiot. He knows why trump hates China. It is because Xi refused to help him win the election.
1305178936574443525 2020-09-14 00:18:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden To claim that the fires are the fault of Democrats is more trump insanityWhen the country was shut down almost immediately the air was cleaner without the exhaust fumes and the news showed the beaches in south florida were so clearIt was so obvious what we are doing to our planet
1305174850206658561 2020-09-14 00:01:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @reedgalen Is there any doubt that trump is insane, that is what makes the man so dangerous.
1305173653114494981 2020-09-13 23:57:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 I think the Stable Genius thinks everyone is too stupid to handle the truth If trump would learn to read and look at history books he would find out that the American people have handled wars and depression and illness etc. and came through it all because they were told the truth
1305169668710248449 2020-09-13 23:41:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden trump says climate change is a hoax. I am sure he has some ridiculous explanation for what is happening.  It's Bidens fault. It's those Democrats fault. What it must be like lost in that head of his. He probably scares himself.
1305138676461170688 2020-09-13 21:38:03 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom @RepsForBiden There is no one to reign trump in. The Republicans just ignore what he says and does.

His penchant for QAnon is not what we want from a president We don't need any more craziness from him. His sick racism is not what Fla. is about I personally am having a hard time with his attack on the military as my family IS military
1303528516391235589 2020-09-09 10:59:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why didn't you protect and preserve the White House? Because you don't give a damn. All these years and many presidents and first ladies no one did damage to the White House but you and yours. You people are shameless.

1303502160810979328 2020-09-09 09:15:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom He knows that he won't win on his own merits.  Because he is a loser.he can only win by cheating. I personally believe he had the russians help him win before But really isn't it somehow illegal for him to tell trumpsters to vote twice? He is encouraging people to commit a felony
1303450184530243584 2020-09-09 05:48:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse I really hope the American people pay attention and ask questions of the scientists not you.

1303440474259288065 2020-09-09 05:10:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @SecBernhardt @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @Interior trump has done a great job at lying and saying disgusting, vile things about our great military. What do we expect from a man who went to great lengths to avoid the military. I do understand. If he were in the military the boys would have straightened his lying sarcastic ass out
1303431338444324865 2020-09-09 04:33:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse The Latinos in fla. need to stop listening to trump. He never does anything for Latinos and please look at how he has treated Puerto Ricans. He actually said he would like to trade Puerto Rico for Greenland. Is that the way a president should talk about the citizens?
1303429070894649344 2020-09-09 04:24:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse How can Floridians even look at trump when he wants to destroy the state by increasing off shore oil drilling. One accident could ruin the state. He has no respect for the environment. Everything comes down to money to him.
1303424232483958785 2020-09-09 04:05:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump is not safe guarding the country when he sends his hateful white supremacists people to Portland to kill Black Live Matter protesters. His group came there looking for trouble with the peaceful BLM group. When is trump going to stop this hate.
1303421120834686976 2020-09-09 03:53:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom I recognized his racist BS right from the beginning. I am fortunate to be a white woman from the suburbs who has a very diverse neighborhood. I love having many different neighbors and friends. We all look out for each other. Race or color never enters our minds.
1303419388641579008 2020-09-09 03:46:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @awidowsjourney @RepsForBiden I watched Kait Wyatt today. Her message is very powerful not all vindictive. She is a true American who has sacrificed so much for her country. trump caused her so much pain with his disgusting insensitive rhetoric. Does he feel bad?
1303417980437630976 2020-09-09 03:40:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoyAnnReid It is not right to teach this little girl how to lie
1303417628371845121 2020-09-09 03:39:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump protecting and preserving the environment? Isn't he the one who said climate change is a hoax? Isn't trump the one who withdrew the USA from the Paris Climate Change agreement?
1303416151385559040 2020-09-09 03:33:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @JRubinBlogger trump has contempt for everyone but himself. That is what makes him a sociopath.
1303415195507855360 2020-09-09 03:29:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Like rushing through a vaccine without knowing it is safe? And making unbelievably insensitive remarks about our military? You should hang your head in shame that people actually listen to you.
1303414324518629376 2020-09-09 03:26:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What kind of pharmaceutical co. Would rush a vaccine through just to placate an insane man who just wants to use it to win votes in his re election I understand him, he puts no value on human life.But a phara. Co? We are supposed to trust them with other vaccines and meds we need
1303405993959854082 2020-09-09 02:52:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump More trump bullshit.
1303405223822733312 2020-09-09 02:49:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich Isn't that where trump said the hurricane was coming to. I believe he marked it with a sharpie. The stupid ass.
1303404389739229196 2020-09-09 02:46:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump .What kind of man asks a friend to do something for him and when it goes bad throws his friend under the bus. Did DeJoy know this about trump? Does a person like trump even have any friends? He is such a vile little man.
1303401636979707907 2020-09-09 02:35:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @MMAHistoryToday @realDonaldTrump @joerogan Why are trump supporters so violent? Does he encourage this angry, hostile group to do whatever they can to hurt others? A president tries to bring peace to the nation not turmoil and hatred.
1303391859826462720 2020-09-09 01:56:49 +0800 <dmhossley> Since all this hateful rhetoric from trump about our brave and patriotic service members. It occured to me how wrong it is to have a draft dodger like trump be Commander in Chief. What in hell does he know about the military, he did what he had to get out of serving our country.
1303387659985969152 2020-09-09 01:40:08 +0800 <dmhossley> trump hates china almost as much as Obama. The reason? He asked Xi to help him win this election and Xi said no. So whenever he mentions Xi or china he speaks so venomously.
1303386231565422592 2020-09-09 01:34:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol @RepsForBiden Another of his lies. trump said he called melania a home. Melania was on the trip with him.

How evil can one man be?
1303371786973777924 2020-09-09 00:37:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The American people do not deserve a dangerous, lying, cheating fool leading our country He makes a fool out of the USA every time he opens his mouth trump really needs to stay at his golf club or in the bunker until jan.20, 2021. If he really cares about this nation he would.
1303368654759886848 2020-09-09 00:24:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump looks even crazier than people in the insane asylum. I did a rotation for school in an asylum and those people were more sane than trump His insane lies about covid, the economy and the office of the president which he as completely demeaned, are so idiotic.
1303360917581762562 2020-09-08 23:53:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Are you trying to convince Americans? You would do better convincing the trump clan. They are the ones that will be putting money in the commissary for you. When all your crimes are added up you will spend the rest of your life in jail. You are a present day Benedict Arnold.
1303359133329117187 2020-09-08 23:46:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @BillKristol trump only wants to be re elected to stay out of jail. He certainly does not LOVE his country.

1303356185513521152 2020-09-08 23:35:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Patriotic Americans should not have to be subjected to mad man trump. This insanity is a daily barrage of lies and insults.The world is watching and wonderingwhen the people are going to throw him out on his ass He is having his far right radical terrorist groups attack Americans
1303354322424602626 2020-09-08 23:27:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump want to surrender us to putin Trump is endangering our country with his insane bs. He is so jealous of Pres. Obama.he can't stop referring to him. And Vice Pres. Biden and Sen. Harris really get under his skin. trump acts like he is unraveling more and more each day.
1303347057852329991 2020-09-08 22:58:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoyceWhiteVance Certainly not the Godfather.

1303168264978280449 2020-09-08 11:08:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Only 700? That is just a small amt.
1303164715040993281 2020-09-08 10:54:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Kavanaugh should never have been put on the supreme court. He is just as corrupt as trump. That is why trump placed him there to his bidding. The next president needs to look into kavanaugh's position and decide if it is inappropriate because everything trump does is crooked.
1303162056431075331 2020-09-08 10:43:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse It would be nice if any of this was true,  but it's not. 1/2 of 1 % of every thing trump says may be true. All the rest is fiction or out and out lies. trumps biggest problem now is staying out of jail.
1303099672731570183 2020-09-08 06:35:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @mccaffreyr3 I hope this hero knows the American people are doing all we can to get trump out. I can't imagine how it felt to hear trump disparage POW's and call our troops losers and suckers.
1303098316830507008 2020-09-08 06:30:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @mccaffreyr3 trump is a draft dodger not once or twice but four times how can he even be the head of the military. It bothers me so much when troops salute him since he never spent a day in military service and  he calls THEM "losers"? Only one loser here and that is trump.
1303096935901995009 2020-09-08 06:24:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse Neither trump or pence has any respect for our military or Citizens.
1303096483122753543 2020-09-08 06:23:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @evelyn_knox11 @WhiteHouse trump is a draft dodging lying cheating POS. He wants to stay in the white house 4 more years because he knows NY is going to send him to jail. He thinks they will not be able to if he is still president News flash trump the soldiers HATE you and so do Americans. Loser, sucker.
1303095152047788034 2020-09-08 06:17:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @RacerXlive @WhiteHouse trump is a draft dodging POS
1303094713126445056 2020-09-08 06:16:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse trump should be prosecuted for draft dodging.He repeatedly lied about his health(bone spurs)to get out of serving his country. What kind of person does that? He is now disparaging our troops.he hates them because they did what he did not he should not be commander in chief
1303085166823452678 2020-09-08 05:38:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @ericowensdc @RepsForBiden It is trump who is inciting the riots so he can call in the feds. He knows who the far right winged radical groups are. I believe trump has been sending these people to peaceful protests to make them look bad. trump is just damned evil.
1303083844732694529 2020-09-08 05:32:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich He is also a shit head

1303081923137474565 2020-09-08 05:25:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse donald trump is a SUCKER and a LOSER. he is the biggest liar and cheater our country ever dealt with. He is so desperate to stay in the White House because he and his clan are living it up on the taxpayers dollars. As good as Americans have been to them they have destroyed the WH
1303067986178211840 2020-09-08 04:29:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe it is remnants of Adderall he snorted before he went on camera
1303067163687890946 2020-09-08 04:26:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump I actually thought when mike pence was chosen as VP and he talked about being religious that he would be a buffer for all your lies. But it turns out pence was comfortable with lying for you. Really eroded my belief in either of you. You are both terrible liars
1303065039054745600 2020-09-08 04:18:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You should be so ashamed of yourself making disparaging remarks about the military when you are a draft dodger. No one in my family dodged the draft and when they eliminated the draft members of my family signed up to serve. How dare you call them loser's.
1303063159733968900 2020-09-08 04:10:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump is a STUPID person. I am regular American person will NEVER take a vaccine that trump pushes. He is pushing an unproven vaccine no matter what it does to people. He has proven it over &amp; over by telling the public to take a few unproven drugs and told people to inject bleach
1303053766502080514 2020-09-08 03:33:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @DairylandPower Pence is a trump liar
1303053605558157312 2020-09-08 03:32:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer He is too busy trying to convince us that a vaccine will be ready by election day. He is really, really crazy.
1303053110126968834 2020-09-08 03:30:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Thank God this is not being aired in my area.  I really am tired of all his lies and sarcasm. Do i believe him or anything he says? NO!
1303051382514212868 2020-09-08 03:23:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump is the sick one

1303048571315466248 2020-09-08 03:12:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse We can't believe ANYTHING you say. I will never take a vaccine that you are pushing just to get votes.

1302999022718906368 2020-09-07 23:55:50 +0800 <dmhossley> @GuthrieGF this shows how desperate trump and the republican party are. Just low and disgraceful.

John McCain has the same values as VPBiden. trump hates and says terrible things about John because he is jealous that John McCain is a national hero. trump will never be considered a hero, he is hateful and not at all what 🇺🇸is all about.
1302996937914888193 2020-09-07 23:47:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 Because he needs putin. He can not win on his own merrits.

1302995918879428609 2020-09-07 23:43:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Because trump is a draft dodger
1302995396298448896 2020-09-07 23:41:25 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You should not be using a vaccine as a political tool. Based on you actions you do not care for lives. I would not take a vaccine until the scientist say it is safe. You just want it rushed through to help your reelection because you know you won't win on your merrits.
1302994478580617218 2020-09-07 23:37:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse They are probably over run with far right gangs like Boogaloo Bois. Get rid of them and there will be peace. But thats what trump wants. He has refused to look into far right gangs because they are doing exactly what he wants. Disruption

1302751138161229824 2020-09-07 07:30:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @chipfranklin How many laws do taxpayers have to break before they are arrested? Not many. So who the hell is DeJoy that he continues messing with the USPS and gets away with it as a matter of fact how many laws does trump have have to break before he is arrested.?  I think he has broken a few
1302623109997105153 2020-09-06 23:02:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump you are the only one putting out fake news &amp; hate. More and more Americans are finding you crass, distasteful and unreliable. You lie so much that even you can't keep up. You are a loser and a sucker.

How can trump call himself a patriot?
1302459312242126848 2020-09-06 12:11:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Draft dodger. Such a lowlife. Has anyone in your family ever served our county? No? So the trumps just took from this country but never gave back. How dare you disparage our men &amp; women who have or are serving our country with your disgusting bs.
1302456900269813761 2020-09-06 12:01:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden That sounds just like trump  Good thing he does not believe in God otherwise he would have a conscience and that would eat away at him which we know it doesn't.
1302455914021163008 2020-09-06 11:57:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I just watched the special on the trump virus. If anyone has any doubt that trump is absolutely evil they need to watch it. He failed to take action in jan but praised china on a good job they were doing. Anyone who lost someone to this virus blame trump.trump killed so many.
1302437056027725825 2020-09-06 10:42:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @HKrassenstein Lindsey graham is now and always has been an ignorant ass. I really don't believe that anyone listens to him
1302436280370946048 2020-09-06 10:39:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden What an insane idiot. Most of trumps hatred for Obama is racial. It is very clear that trump is a racist bigot. I am watching how he handled this virus from january when he praised Xi I guess he turned on him when trump asked Xi to help him win the election. Xi said no
1302434697826496513 2020-09-06 10:33:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The radical far right are going down. 2 of the boogaloo bois were arrested. Will you post their bond trump?
1302434132262301696 2020-09-06 10:31:09 +0800 <dmhossley> @LebaAndrew @realDonaldTrump I don't understand how one can be pro life and pro death penalty. Does not make sense to me. Of course most of what that ass called trump says is nonsensible.
1302432254870917121 2020-09-06 10:23:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @daddyandmacayla @realDonaldTrump Real nice. Totally disparage and lie about a person who can't defend themselves because they are dead. You would do better to admit to the evil and unpatriotic actions of donald trump. He is bound and determined to ruin our country.
1302396981181132802 2020-09-06 08:03:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @StephenKing A friend just called me and asked if i believed trump said that stuff. I said yes i do. Why? because of all the crap he has said for 4 yrs. He made his own reputation.
1302375230996963336 2020-09-06 06:37:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I bet you would not encourage your supports to try and commit voter fraud. Never in all the years i have been voting have i ever seen and heard a president talk like this maniac.
1302374040875786241 2020-09-06 06:32:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Have you told these poor people that they are going to end up with an enormous bill when it ends. trump you are really a piece of work.
1302372990307401731 2020-09-06 06:28:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden Personally I prefer trump golfing or sitting in the bunker. At least he keeps that nasty mouth of his quiet.
1302372262671273984 2020-09-06 06:25:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You are such an evil liar. Is it still getting you somewhere? Lying and cheating is all you have ever known. I know i am a NYer and you got out if NY before they threw you out. Liar/cheater
1302371523408338946 2020-09-06 06:22:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @theblaze @realDonaldTrump More racism from the president who only wants whites in the country. Didn't HITLER kill blacks as well as jewish people.
1302370592730025991 2020-09-06 06:18:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Because the RACIST, BIGOT calling himself president stopped it. So he is only the president of white people?
1302369979409534976 2020-09-06 06:16:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How do you know the owner of that salon is very good? Do you go there or did you set Nancy Pelosi up with this woman. You are the one who plays dirty And you didn't have such a good conversation with pres. Xi when he refused to help you win election. She won't be putins puppet
1302368287762853888 2020-09-06 06:09:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @KamalaHarris @TeamJoe Stay away from vp pence while you are there because he is an evil liar. He claims he is religious, i don't know any religion that allows a person to lie. pence lies constantly
1302359447856087040 2020-09-06 05:34:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden I wonder how much the American people are paying for these little golfing trips. I am sure he is billing for use of his own property. He has done it before
1302358769301688320 2020-09-06 05:31:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse I personally will not take a vaccine that has been rushed like this one has. Do i believe trump on this absolutely not. That man doesn't know the truth if it bit him in the ass. He will say anything or do anything to get voted back in. More and more people have become discusted
1302357715889598465 2020-09-06 05:27:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Who would listen to a radiologist about a pandemic? It does not sound right to me especially when there are very qualified Dr's in the FDA or CBC. Apparently trump just relies on people who tell him what he wants to hear he is not looking for the truth
1302292007059099651 2020-09-06 01:06:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @BreitbartNews The reason trump protects russia and condemns china is because Xi jinping refused to help trump get re elected. On the other hand putin knows he can manipulate trump so they are doing all they can to get him reelected. trump &amp; putin believe in cheating and they did it before.
1302289410936000514 2020-09-06 00:56:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @WhiteHouseCEA Well thats the most BS today.that big mouth racist asshole is out of his mind
1302288309029400584 2020-09-06 00:51:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe @KamalaHarris I am white and i have never understood people like trump who think they are better than others I was taught that I am no better than anyone else and no one else is better than me My mother taught me that. Isaid so on here and trumpsters jumped on me that my mother taught me wrong
1302285435608207361 2020-09-06 00:40:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @BreitbartNews It is just unbelievable that this great country has a blatant racist that some call president.He has no intention ofcalling out the russians for their interference in our elections. Most of us do know how badly trump wantsthis election that he again will welcome russias meddling
1302281758826803200 2020-09-06 00:25:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @tribelaw He doesn't just sound like an asshole he IS an asshole
1302281278876798981 2020-09-06 00:23:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @funder Perfect for that racist clown.
1302280943969935360 2020-09-06 00:22:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse But racism is allowed  Nice
1302243390927581184 2020-09-05 21:53:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @MichelleObama @Michaelsmithinc Too bad the trump clan has no desire to protect the history of the White House. They spend a lot of money to erase it. They don't consider the fact that the White House is part of America. They destroy parts of the White House for their selfish reasons like making a speech.
1302242062503378946 2020-09-05 21:47:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @smerconish @CNN @cnni @WHO Yes
1302218781146722305 2020-09-05 20:15:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You are the only one inciting people because you want this country divided. Now after all you have said and done you call for peace?
1302217872689819648 2020-09-05 20:11:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Loser
1302082804977668100 2020-09-05 11:15:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Greg gutfeld is pitifully uninformed. I get a kick out of people who defend donald trump seem to be just as angry as him.
1302048040006582273 2020-09-05 08:56:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Barr &amp; trump need to go on strict diets. They are both hideously obese.
1302040868778577921 2020-09-05 08:28:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He can't stop because he is a pathological liar. More mental disease.
1302039786820194304 2020-09-05 08:24:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich He will have to snort extra adderall for that
1302039373727371270 2020-09-05 08:22:32 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeathMayo I do not believe trump is naive at all. He knows exactly what he is doing. His involvement with communists shows his desire to be a dictator. He respects people like putin. He does not respect our military or the American people.
1302020964780306432 2020-09-05 07:09:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump donald trump is a sucker and a loser
1302020366001483776 2020-09-05 07:07:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump How did you call melania from france when she was there with you? LIAR
1302019366100365314 2020-09-05 07:03:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden How did you phone your wife when she was there with you  LIAR
1302019071580549120 2020-09-05 07:01:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse The radical right is living in the white house.
1302014153088012290 2020-09-05 06:42:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden He really needs to removed from office. Every American (even his supporters) are in jeopardy because of an unstable angry, unpatriotic, selfish little man
1302012733739675648 2020-09-05 06:36:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump You say what you say and you have said a lot to insult and disparage people.
1301959831272730624 2020-09-05 03:06:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @ReallyAmerican1 Never in my life time have i seen anything like trumps presidency. Now trump is telling us a vaccine will be available by oct. Convenient right before elections. trump is a killer and has no problem pushing for this vaccine before it is proved to be safe.
1301958904168017920 2020-09-05 03:02:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @cindymccain @RepsForBiden @McCainJack I had a dear cousin who was a major in the Air Force flying b52 bombers and was on his 4th tour of duty in Viet Nam when he was killed. His funeral was so emotional. His dad never recovered and died 6 mos later my aunt was a gold star mother. My brother was paralyzed in viet nam.
1301957065636749314 2020-09-05 02:55:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Kushner is just a puppet to trump
1301956901652041738 2020-09-05 02:54:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Another trump deflection. He doesn't want people talking about the trump virus. That is foremost on Americans minds.
1301948207904284678 2020-09-05 02:20:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You are a fake person
1301947908539985920 2020-09-05 02:19:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Thats the truth
1301947319940788224 2020-09-05 02:16:44 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidAFrench This is what happens when you cross trump  He is an evil spiteful disgusting little man.
1301943858620702721 2020-09-05 02:02:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @frequentbuyer1 That's because they are trump supporters and are grasping at straws. Pay no attention
1301942294682234882 2020-09-05 01:56:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @ProjectLincoln Actually trump hates everything and everybody except people who bow down to him. They are all trump asses
1301941552022007814 2020-09-05 01:53:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Asshole
1301941237612793858 2020-09-05 01:52:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump hates everything and everybody. Makes me wonder what happened to him or was he born that way? The strange thing is he believes his own lies.
1301940495053189120 2020-09-05 01:49:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus Ha trump is patriotic? trump is just an ignorant self seeking fool and if he doesn't know it well i don't know to say to him except that he is an ASS
1301901587271606274 2020-09-04 23:15:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I am doing all i can to protect myself from trumps virus. I wear a mask everywhere , i socially distance, and that is a big one for me because trumpsters are all out there not trying to protect me by wearing a mask. trump says to his supporters it's un american to wear a mask
1301899745187762183 2020-09-04 23:07:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse A trump vaccine? I don't think so. He just wants the vaccine to earn more votes he does not care if it kills people. He has no ability to care. He is a sociopath. He proves it every day. Winning is all he cares about.
1301898422488829953 2020-09-04 23:02:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden John McCain is an American hero. What is trump? An ass and a traitor. His relationship with puten make trump a traitor . calling the people in our military losers makes him the biggest ass this country has ever seen.
1301897397103144960 2020-09-04 22:58:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoelMartinRubin @RepsForBiden I remember him saying McCain was a loser because he got cought. trump said he doesn't like people that caught. Well trump what do you think now? You have been caught numerous times loser.
1301896608196497409 2020-09-04 22:55:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @MichaelCohen212 @RepsForBiden @TheAtlantic He is the biggest coward this country has ever seen. No one in my family "got out of serving" they fought for the country they loved from the 1st world war to the present. Many died or were seriously injured. None that i knew of regretted their service
1301895239301500933 2020-09-04 22:49:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @HeathMayo Americans eyes are wide open now
1301894982341734401 2020-09-04 22:48:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @JRubinBlogger He won't because he is crazy. The last law&amp;order president resigned because he knew it was better for this country. trump couldn't care less about what is good for America. If he did he would not have done all anti American crap he has done.
1301894060014276608 2020-09-04 22:45:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @ellefsenrachial @RepsForBiden @DevinCow Trump is the loser and sucker. Look how desperate he is. Each day he show increasing desperation. He knows the only chance to be re elected is with the russians. I was convinced that they cheated for him in 2016 and are willing to do it again because he is putins puppet
1301892660932890626 2020-09-04 22:39:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @ONDCP @WhiteHouse @Surgeon_General The rushed vaccine that does not show us that it is safe will not be taken by people.
1301892239338147842 2020-09-04 22:37:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @LindseyGrahamSC That is because trump is a traitor and a vile human being
1301884770599735298 2020-09-04 22:08:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump If trump thinks he is going to put my life and my family and friends lives in danger by pushing the professionals to get the operation. Warp speed out before the elections he is mistaken. Now i won't trust the FDA or CDC anymore because obviously you and they do not care about us
1301867931354226688 2020-09-04 21:01:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @Elle4Life_Love @DoYouEvenLif @BlackDi04229689 I am an older person and i knew he was on Adderall when he was on the Apprentis.

1301866732831870976 2020-09-04 20:56:31 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I second that. I wish there was a way to keep him off tv. His face makes me want to vomit.
1301866351770906625 2020-09-04 20:55:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Trump would not even be able to shine Governor Cuomo's shoes. Trump is a poor excuse for a human being. You had better take it easy when you take on Governor Cuomo. He will beat you down intellectually and you will not be able to recover. Go ahead trump walk the street of NY .
1301864214462640128 2020-09-04 20:46:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @MichaelCohen212 @RepsForBiden @TheAtlantic Trump is a cheater and a liar. He has been so all his life. He lied and cheated in New York so much he had to run to Florida.

How this country got to this point with an ass like trump i don't know. I do know that the people who defend him are as crass and vile as him.
1301859605274820608 2020-09-04 20:28:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @RooseveltTed @RepsForBiden Thank you. That man is not a president he is a loser masquerading as president. He has zero leadership qualities thats why he defends putin. He admires putins strength because trump has none. He has failed the people in this country over and over.

You have no business leading the greatest country in the world. You couldn't even run your own business's. You bankrupt them. The world is denouncing putin for what he did. All except you.
1301857010552631298 2020-09-04 20:17:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeghanMcCain @RepsForBiden Meghan, I want to apologise for that vile, disgusting excuse for a human being. When he said the things he said about your da i found that i had the capacity to hate. And i hate him.he says these things because he hates himself rightly so. Pray we elect VP Biden as our president.
1301851745035923456 2020-09-04 19:56:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @RadioFreeTom Thank you Trumps people are so nasty when they defend that obscene. Mad man. When he said the things he said about John McCain i was so disgusted? He made fun of disabled people. Yesterday he made fun of VP Biden because he was wearing a mask That is the kind of president we want
1301717256930553857 2020-09-04 11:02:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan Now that is a President. Thank you President Biden for your calmness and clear head. I am actually nauseous when jackass trump comes on tv. He really should wear a mask it is an improvement .

He never deserves a salute when he never served in the military.The poor thing had bone spurs. I never heard of such a lame excuse.Every male in my family served when they were called an some died protecting us.
1301712906011189248 2020-09-04 10:45:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse We never has all this craziness before trump. The fact is he will carry on with outlandish talk and just plain lies. The reason? It wants do divert our attention away from the virus.but we had better keep our eyes open. He is pushing for a vaccine before the elections.why???
1301711438889844738 2020-09-04 10:39:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse donald trump is full of crap. He lies and lies

1301637581180989447 2020-09-04 05:45:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @DanFliller @WhiteHouse @Surgeon_General Especially the grinding up and snorting Adderall.
1301637059564711936 2020-09-04 05:43:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @Surgeon_General I have decided i want nothing to do with any vaccine that trump has anything to do with especially something called operation warp speed. What are we 5 yrs old. No trump has pushed you people to get the vaccine out before the elections.he is such a selfish bastard.
1301635598067945473 2020-09-04 05:38:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @NYGovCuomo You are just pissed because New Yorkers hate you andi am one of them you have been an SOB all your life and will continue to be you are also a liar, thief and cheat and You were before you stole the presidency.
1301634480617201664 2020-09-04 05:33:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You won in 2016 are you saying you won because of voter fraud?
1301630619626041344 2020-09-04 05:18:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump is so funny with his on again off again love affair with Fox news. Now he calls them fake news.
1301629782061453312 2020-09-04 05:14:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse What is trump going to compensate his followers with if they are arrested for voter fraud when they try to vote twice. Sounds to me like that was a signal for his supporters to do just that then when it is found out he will scream he lost due to voter fraud
1301627123908648963 2020-09-04 05:04:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Navarro's is a slime bag. So nasty and get involved in stuff that has nothing to do with his job. He is just kissing trumps ass.
1301625814610567170 2020-09-04 04:59:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli @RepsForBiden I would love to hear an answer to that. Why does he get away with all the things he does. I have wondered if he has stuff on people during the Epstein days.
1301623620976943104 2020-09-04 04:50:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @MeidasTouch It looks to me like he got into his fathers Adderall
1301621632314810368 2020-09-04 04:42:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @kylegriffin1 @RepsForBiden Lock him up!
1301621259642507265 2020-09-04 04:41:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @kurteichenwald They are ranting about Nancy Pelosi because there is nothing they can say about the Biden/Harris team. Trump is such a low life he lies and cheats and probably will steal votes if he gets a chance
1301619966647709696 2020-09-04 04:35:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse That is one of the more stupid things trump has said. This coming from a president who will not wear a mask.
1301540458531782657 2020-09-03 23:20:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @lindyli @RepsForBiden And if not why not?
1301540303673929729 2020-09-03 23:19:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Just another trump lie
1301540139198566402 2020-09-03 23:18:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Just more trump lies
1301539318285168640 2020-09-03 23:15:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse One set of rules for trump and another for the public. On top of that trump is allowed to lie and cheat
1301534055809286145 2020-09-03 22:54:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden @LindseyGrahamSC I remember as a kid a siren would go off and we had to go under our desks in school.The reason "the russians are coming. When I grew up I do not remember any president protecting communism except trump. What's up with that
1301531387732860929 2020-09-03 22:43:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @NYGovCuomo The New York prosecutors are after you for your corruption going back years. I know you have a reputation in NY of being corrupt, liar, racist and cheater You can't help that is just who you are. Your comments of "I didn't say that, I don't remember, it's a hoax"  are ridiculous
1301527581347459075 2020-09-03 22:28:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart @SpeakerPelosi @FoxNews It is ridicules people going on about Nancy Pelosi' hair cut. Lets talk about trump. He is withholding funds to cities because of their politics. Isn't that against the law for a president to do?trump telling people to vote twice. Isn't that against the law for a president to do?
1301506670682669057 2020-09-03 21:05:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Trump is not going force me to take an unproven vaccine. Again trump does not care about the people he thinks rushing the vaccine through at "warp speed" will win him votes.what does trump feel is an ok number of people dying from such vaccine is alright with him. 186,000 death?
1301505376635031552 2020-09-03 21:00:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @WalshFreedom @RepsForBiden Trumps reason for trying to stop citizens from using mail in ballots (which they all use) is because he says there is fraud with them. Yesterday he called for republicans to commit fraud by voting twice. He knows some will do as he said and do it then trump will scream FRAUD.
1301503907957485569 2020-09-03 20:54:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Less than 2 mos to go and trump &amp; his corrupt administration are getting panicked and are making Americans feel less safe. we know from past experience with trump he plays dirty. He cheats and lies and uses the power of the presidency to punish everyone who disagree with him
1301348190898225153 2020-09-03 10:36:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @BetteMidler I have studied him thoroughly and think i can tell when he is lying. It's interesting when i turn the sound off and watch his expressions i believe his face changes when he is lying
1301346830098272257 2020-09-03 10:30:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @joelockhart He is something isn't he?  I don't think he knows he is a civil servant and not a member of royalty
1301345745774292994 2020-09-03 10:26:18 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Funny you should say you want to preserve the past. Then why have you and Malenia systematically torn down so much history at the white house. That house (by the way you don't own it) has been there through many presidents not one of whom has taken that house apart like you.
1301330753846992902 2020-09-03 09:26:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The only way you will win donald is to cheat. But you know very well how to cheat and lie Have you seen the poles?
1301329955075350534 2020-09-03 09:23:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump Everytime i think you can't go any lower, you go lower. Why can't you try to win without cheating and lying
1301329480489857027 2020-09-03 09:21:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @RussVought45 What about you taking federal dollars? You are spending our money like it is water. Is that why you won't release your tax returns because the American people will find out you are a tax dodger like you were a draft dodger?
1301328292654579712 2020-09-03 09:16:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you release your tax returns? What are you hiding?
1301227422885515265 2020-09-03 02:36:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @mmpadellan I agree. Trump did not i Win the popular vote but won the electoral. Seems to me that could be a cheaters drean
1301226020914294786 2020-09-03 02:30:33 +0800 <dmhossley> @JustOneVoice68 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse That is just not true. And where are the portraits of Pres. Clinton and Pres. Bush? It was not their right to remove them. As far as the Rose Garden is concerned Melania had no right to touch itShe blamed Michelle Obama for not taking care of it. Melania has been there for 4 yrs.
1301223718119768067 2020-09-03 02:21:24 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus VPBiden did not lie and make up a story about trump. He answered the question appropriately.
1301222377041399813 2020-09-03 02:16:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Why can't he? VP Biden is so positive and hopeful for the future of America. His calm effect is so contagious. I believe him.
1301202006204440577 2020-09-03 00:55:08 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Now we know why trump will not say anything against putin. The same russians that interfered in the 2016 election are targeting Americans again. This came from the FBI. Will trump say they are fake too?
1301199190349893633 2020-09-03 00:43:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @murphymike @RepsForBiden trump is such a slithering snake.
1301198687004229633 2020-09-03 00:41:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer @RonWyden trumps main objective is to end Social Security for people who paid into it all their live. It is not an entitlement as trump calls it. And by the way trump is spending taxpayers money buying votes. He is giving millons of dollars away but won't help unemployed taxpayers
1301197108045897732 2020-09-03 00:35:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @maggieNYT @RepsForBiden Next thing we know the racist bigot trump will blame black people for the virus. He blames everyone else but himself. The virus spread in this country because trump kept calling it a hoax. Then he would preach "it will just go away."
1301195611513946116 2020-09-03 00:29:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @SteveStruhs @JoeBiden You did disparage her. She was a decent, loving woman from Boston who did not want her daughter losing out on some wonderful relationships because of blind racism A person is good or bad in their heart not the color of their skin and I am so grateful that my Mother taught me that
1301190826400403458 2020-09-03 00:10:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @RAWRrubyy @JoeBiden Sorry, you are wrong. I have a master's degree. I am the White, educated, Christian Woman from the suburbs.
1301190062722420738 2020-09-03 00:07:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @SteveStruhs @JoeBiden Don't you dare disparage my Mother. That is very low. My Mother was the kindest woman. She is no longer here to witness all this horrendously racism.
1301189457589268483 2020-09-03 00:05:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @AlejandroSopra1 @JoeBiden You have to resort to fake ads like that? The truth hurts. God is not racist. He made us all the same. It is man who spread racism
1301188910865940480 2020-09-03 00:03:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @ging_nancy @JoeBiden Oh my God are you for real? You do know the south lost the civil war?
1301188193224720387 2020-09-03 00:00:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @NBierlair @JoeBiden More trump lies  How can you believe a word that evil man says
1301187959853641728 2020-09-02 23:59:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @DavidNathanaelx @JoeBiden That is not true of me. I was a republican until trump convinced me that it was no longer the republican party I know. trump is a racist bigot. really listen to him.
1301186817996226561 2020-09-02 23:54:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @HomelandKen You probably sent those 100 people there because you are a liar and a cheat
1301186395004981248 2020-09-02 23:53:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @HomelandKen Again trump is dividing our country and jeopardizing our standing in the world. He made disparaging remarks again against the WHO. The WHO has done remarkable work and many health professionals depend on their advise. He hates WHO and China because China would not help him cheat
1301182836653912069 2020-09-02 23:38:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @GovRonDeSantis   Nursing home patients are not the only people dying alone in Florida. Everyone who has contracted Covid19 and died in Florida have died alone. Do you know anyone who has? Maybe your attitude would be different if you did.
1301179847683735557 2020-09-02 23:27:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Those are broken promises. We don't trust trump anymore. He is a liar and a cheat and the white women from the suburbs are very aware of it.
1301179016712462336 2020-09-02 23:23:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden His propaganda to white women is not working!  He is just an ass.
1301178235699560448 2020-09-02 23:20:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Do you have a blank check of American taxpayer money with you? You are only going there to buy votes because you can't win on your own merits. You cheat or bribe.
1301177476824129536 2020-09-02 23:17:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Anyone who does is a fool.
1301176930058801153 2020-09-02 23:15:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer It is worse than that. trump wants the testing stopped. He is now saying if a person has no symptoms they do not need a test. He is too ignorant to know that that person can still spread the disease. In trumps mind:  no tests no cases. That is his goal.
1301175557640654849 2020-09-02 23:10:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump September 2, 2020 Covid19 stats USA  6,078,513.         Total cases 184,747.             Total deaths  ??? Amt soldiers killed by putins bounty  What will the stats for the trump virus be after labor day?  trump does not encourage Americans to be safe from the trump virus
1301172351128801280 2020-09-02 22:57:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The only way trump can win is by cheating. He is good at it, he has done it all his life. We will be watching.
1301171704627068930 2020-09-02 22:54:43 +0800 <dmhossley> @hogangidley45 @realDonaldTrump @JHoganGidley Thighland?
1301170832564195329 2020-09-02 22:51:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @hogangidley45 @realDonaldTrump @JHoganGidley What has trump paid you to lie to the American people? The people have their eyes wide open now.
1301169130285027329 2020-09-02 22:44:29 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump No you won't. The American people are sick of your lies and spending our money like water but refuse to help the unemployed ,that you created, with their own tax dollars
1301168498719293443 2020-09-02 22:41:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Ate you going to buy more votes? How much of taxpayers money are you going to give them
1301167314860113921 2020-09-02 22:37:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump No he doesn't he spends his time tweeting and playing golf while melania and the rest of the clan spends OUR money.
1301166482336944133 2020-09-02 22:33:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump trump is a liar and a thief. Pay the taxpayers back all the millions you stole. We are on to you and your whole damn clan.
1301165155590569988 2020-09-02 22:28:42 +0800 <dmhossley> @CheriJacobus The only people cheating are the trump clan. They are all thieves and liars. The American people will eventually be told the truth about how trump, including melania, have stolen huge amts of money from the taxpayers
1301164218650107905 2020-09-02 22:24:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @SuziMcCoyGMG Over the last 4 years the American people have seen all this trump nonsense. We are so tired of trump and his clan.what bothers us is trump giving away taxpayers money to buy votes. That is the only reason he went to Kenosha to pay them millions for their promise to vote for him.
1301162614605647873 2020-09-02 22:18:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The American people want justice for Jacob Blake
1301160922203983873 2020-09-02 22:11:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The Russian people are rejecting putins vaccine. I am sure trump will try to peddle it to us for his man friend. I'm not having it. I don't trust trump at all.
1301156773420769280 2020-09-02 21:55:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @BBayconich @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump And he gave them millions of our tax dollars to buy their votes.
1301156288135651328 2020-09-02 21:53:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @ceejay410 trump is a liar. pence is a liar The whole damn clan are liars

He is completely racist. And he spends the taxpayers money like it is his. He is buying votes with taxpayers money. The trump clan owes the American taxpayers an enormous amt of money

1301020423824515073 2020-09-02 12:53:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @BBayconich @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump And he paid a lot of taxpayers money to get those votes. That should be against the law.
1301019820058697729 2020-09-02 12:51:11 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't want to win reelection because he wants to help Americans he wants to win to take more taxpayers dollars. He and his clan have been ripping Americans off for 4 years. His wife is just as bad as him. She is spending our money and is determined to ruin the White House
1301015306299736065 2020-09-02 12:33:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @InvisibelleMS @Michell24826274 @PhyddleDD @Lawrence @maddow Oh my God they need to lock them all up. The whole trump clan has been robbing the American people for 4 yrs. Now trump is buying votes with our tax money. He gave them millions today in Kenosha buying their votes but he will not give any relief to tax payers who lost their jobs
1301011968598384640 2020-09-02 12:19:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @LEBassett @RepsForBiden Trump is a low life piece of crap

1301010377891885057 2020-09-02 12:13:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump In case someone has not told you today trump. You are a horses ass. A liar, a racist and a total fool.
1301009734749872128 2020-09-02 12:11:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Maybe he had a drug overdose. If he takes too much Aderall it would be. a trip to hospital for a stomach pump. Who knows?
1301008366089777152 2020-09-02 12:05:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @InvisibelleMS @Michell24826274 @PhyddleDD @Lawrence @maddow Trump does whatever he wants and no one stops him. He is really evil to do what he is doing to immigrants when he has an immigrant wife and her parents. He has children living in cages. I can't believe his wife doesn't put a stop to it
1301006922871697410 2020-09-02 11:59:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @QTMARIANNE @MayorBowser What about what the trump clan is doing to the White House? Don't you think the WH is history? They are tearing everything up to make it look trashy like them.
1301005868167819264 2020-09-02 11:55:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @honey_hushhh @MayorBowser You do know the south lost the war. It is racists like you that has ruined this country. The racist trump clan has ruined the white house but that doesn't bother you?
1301004825342214144 2020-09-02 11:51:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @LibertarianMam3 @MayorBowser What about the trump clan ruining the White House? Taking down past presidents and throwing them in a storage room or ruining the kennedy rose garden (you probably hated the kennedys) but that garden was there since the sixties. They had no right to ruin the WH.
1301002066916147200 2020-09-02 11:40:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jeri71712633 @kmgagie @Lawrence @maddow We will be sick because of trump. Our country will be bankrupt if it isn't already. That is what trump knows how to do. It is unbelievable how he spends the taxpayer money like it is his but will not help taxpayers that he had put in that position.
1301000291924443136 2020-09-02 11:33:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @InvisibelleMS @Michell24826274 @PhyddleDD @Lawrence @maddow And now he lives here. I wonder if trump promised him a spot in his dictatorship
1300998893656846336 2020-09-02 11:28:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @onlytruthhere @Lawrence @maddow Every cent of taxpayer money is OUR business.
1300998570724724742 2020-09-02 11:26:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich Another trump lie. That man is so sick. He spits out his lies then forgets he told them. Not a word that comes out of his mouth is the truth
1300997269408415745 2020-09-02 11:21:35 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse You really have a nerve to say that what you put at the white house must be preserved but you people did not preserve history that was part of the white house for generations.
1300957644405039105 2020-09-02 08:44:07 +0800 <dmhossley> @eddisonwalters @RepsForBiden Are you kidding? Look into trumps real estate and construction deals.he bankrupted most of his companies. He is well known in New York as a liar and a cheater.
1300955290188345344 2020-09-02 08:34:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Trump did not have it then, does not have it now and will not have it tomorrow
1300953276519718913 2020-09-02 08:26:46 +0800 <dmhossley> @ericowensdc @RepsForBiden Nixon was the original law &amp; order president and we all know what happened to him
1300952930388934657 2020-09-02 08:25:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden How wonderful it will be to have a non racist president. 4 years of trump has tried the patience of many americans. I was very lucky to have a mother who was not racist and she explained to me about racist people. I in turn raised my children the same way.
1300951226780200960 2020-09-02 08:18:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Name all these people. Oh you can't because you are lying again. Your lies must have reached 50,000 or more by now
1300950413450129411 2020-09-02 08:15:23 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Reform police are the exact words VP Biden says.
1300950091130449920 2020-09-02 08:14:06 +0800 <dmhossley> @ScottWalker @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @USNationalGuard Do you know that trump is not giving this money. The American taxpayers are. So don't thank trump thank the American people.
1300949561029033984 2020-09-02 08:12:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse All trump lies. The people all know about your lying game. You think you are smarter than us. Well trump you are not. Actually a racist bigot is very ignorant. And that is trump
1300948813021093888 2020-09-02 08:09:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @JudyYankees1 Trump wants to send 25million to a PR company to spread propaganda that we don't have to be anxious or depressed. That is 25 million of our dollars. Save it trump. When you get out we will be ok again
1300946699670695937 2020-09-02 08:00:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @justmarystweets That is just how i feel. I have been blessed in my lifetime to know wonderful people of all colors. What i would have missed if i was so narrow minded like racist trump
1300945761757167616 2020-09-02 07:56:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @Jillbiden46 I am voting for Biden in Florida
1300945473465917442 2020-09-02 07:55:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So now your game is to buy votes with the taxpayers money. If you are going to spend our money where ever you wish why don't you give some to taxpayers who are suffering because you ruined the economy. This must be a priority. It is not your money to spend as you wish
1300944105015513088 2020-09-02 07:50:19 +0800 <dmhossley> @DanRather My heart goes out to all those families. The terrible part of all of this is it could have been avoided. Instead trump used up precious time saying it was a democratic and media hoax. He is still blaming others for his shortfalls.
1300941320488456193 2020-09-02 07:39:15 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden trump lies and pence swears to it. Pence sickens me. trump is very open about his racism and how he does not care about America. But pence declares he is a good christian. A good christian does not lie and lie like pence. If he really is christian then shame on him.
1300940272164122624 2020-09-02 07:35:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden I watched what happened that night and i also heard that boy on his cell phone saying he had killed someone and was going to kill another. I saw the people chasing him after he shot the first person. They were yelling for police none of them answered. Kyle then killed another.
1300939009800232960 2020-09-02 07:30:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @tedcruz You are as stupid as trump. Don't make the mistake that he makes by thinking pro Biden people are uninformed or ignorant because we are not. We are also not racist bigots.
1300930183252373506 2020-09-02 06:55:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @JoeBiden What you have going for you Joe is your record. We know who you are. Trump on the other hand has only hurt Americans. He allowed the trump virus to spread. He ruined the economy. Now he wants us to be guinea pigs and take a vaccine that is not proven to be effective or safe
1300928695960559616 2020-09-02 06:49:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @MichelleObama @WhenWeAllVote We all have to do what we can to get people to vote. I have volunteered to take people to register and to vote or help them to get a mail in ballot. Our country is depending on us.
1300926812432855041 2020-09-02 06:41:36 +0800 <dmhossley> @a_tiny_ant34 @KathiOcean @SenSchumer I know a patriotic president would not have allowed putin t have a bounty on our troops. So we know where trumps loyalty is. Trump never served his country because he had so called bone spurs. I have no respect for a man who won't stand up for his country. My family died for USA
1300925384804925440 2020-09-02 06:35:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @morgandowney7 @rewegreatyet @EricTrump Oh really?
1300924988229386241 2020-09-02 06:34:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Where do you people come up with this shit. Remember VP Biden was in the white house for 8 yrs. He has a record that can be checked. He and Pres. Obama handed trump a great economy. Trump screwed that up.
1300924035317014529 2020-09-02 06:30:34 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump No they are not. Trump is just pissed because china would not help him to cheat to be reelected. Now russia did it before and is doing it now. I would really like to know how trump is going to pay putin back. So far he has allowed putin to put a bounty on our soldiers.
1300923049701715968 2020-09-02 06:26:39 +0800 <dmhossley> @VictoriaECM @ChristyG18 @EricTrump I asked him about the plane thing but realized he was lying again. There was no one who told him anything about people on a plane. What is that called? Pathological liar.
1300922344098144258 2020-09-02 06:23:51 +0800 <dmhossley> @AcidBurnLibby @EricTrump I was about to write and ivanka but saw you beat me to it.
1300921741150236672 2020-09-02 06:21:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @tydpg @EricTrump You obviously do not know what marxism is. Do you know what systemic racism is? Maybe you do
1300920998259232769 2020-09-02 06:18:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @antoniogat68 @EricTrump That is where trump wants to take us. I have confidence in the American people. They will stop him
1300920493596442626 2020-09-02 06:16:30 +0800 <dmhossley> @LeighCaron @EricTrump Funny, Vice President Biden did all that before and he never insulted our allies.
1300919976661061636 2020-09-02 06:14:27 +0800 <dmhossley> @Mr_Chops_MD @EricTrump It will be so good to see the trump clan gone. I know they can't go back to New York. Maybe they can all go to Moscow
1300919469934546951 2020-09-02 06:12:26 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProudlyCanadia4 @lesp67 @EricTrump Do you think he surpasses his idol putin? I can't decide.
1300919032770633728 2020-09-02 06:10:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @morgandowney7 @rewegreatyet @EricTrump Oh gosh. They are the Patriot prayers and the Proud Boys. Educate your self by googling them. Or just stick your head in the sand and believe lying donald trump
1300918101442260993 2020-09-02 06:06:59 +0800 <dmhossley> @fyotruth @EricTrump You are mixed up .It is trump who hides in the bunker that's how he earned the nickname Bunker Baby you ought to check it out it is really funny and on point.
1300917465065697281 2020-09-02 06:04:28 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProudlyCanadia4 @KarmaKatspeaks @EricTrump Or he might have messed his pants. I understand he does that occasionally. The poor housekeepers in the white house have to clean up after that pig.
1300916533028425728 2020-09-02 06:00:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @TesserBarbara @kathleenjmartin @EricTrump Too bad your hatred holds you back from listening to Vice President Biden. He is experienced and is very kind and caring man not like that asshole trump who is a wannabe dictator. He can't even do that right. I don't think trump can walk and chew gum at the same time
1300915418283024390 2020-09-02 05:56:20 +0800 <dmhossley> @soloyochapin @EricTrump @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS I love this. It is too funny.
1300914750054903808 2020-09-02 05:53:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @EricTrump You are such an ass.  Vice President president Biden was in the basement because he was following the law of his state. I had to do the same thing. It was called shelter in place. Now trump was in the bunker because he was afraid and that's where he earned the name Bunker Baby
1300913365662007296 2020-09-02 05:48:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump When is trump going to be arrested, prosecuted and punished? We are waiting.
1300912302435241986 2020-09-02 05:43:57 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Actually trump should go to walter reed and have his head examined
1300911880056311810 2020-09-02 05:42:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I want to know who told you that they were on a plane where all these bad people were. We need to know that NOW. If you don't tell the American people then we will assume it is just another trump lie
1300892176197582848 2020-09-02 04:23:58 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump donald trump. I am a white, educated, christian, woman from the suburbs and I know there is systemic racism in this country and it starts with trump. A racist president has no place in our country. We fought the civil war and won. Stop trying to start another. You will lose
1300887869763051520 2020-09-02 04:06:52 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You have a tell when you lie. You hem and haw then say i will tell you in time. In other words I am full of shit. You are giving a lot of the taxpayers money out like it is water. Why are you NOT helping the taxpayers that are in dire straits because of you? It is their money!!!!
1300886696033214465 2020-09-02 04:02:12 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump No trump they don't choke they KILL
1300885712351494149 2020-09-02 03:58:17 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It's going to be ONLY trump first
1300884943682367488 2020-09-02 03:55:14 +0800 <dmhossley> @Yamiche @RepsForBiden Good for you! Trump wants to use people and spread his racism. I am so sorry for what Jacob is going through. What kind of human being shoots someone in the back 7 times? A coward. That is exactly what that cop and donald trump are. Cowards. Just know many Americans condemn them.
1300883042760876032 2020-09-02 03:47:41 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse Right wing radicals, Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys are doing all the damage. Look them up you will see for yourself. Or maybe you don't want to know because you want to blame, blame,blame and take no responsibility. This obsession with blaming democrats for everything is crazy.
1300881561634603010 2020-09-02 03:41:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I wonder if Americans understand the first step in becoming an Authoritative State is to have Federal Agents go after citizens. If we do not watch trump he will destroy our way of life. He cares NOTHING for the American people.look how he is about the trump virus.feels nothing!
1300876777770885121 2020-09-02 03:22:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @SpeakerPelosi trump wants to pay a PR group 25million taxpayer dollars to spread propaganda to americans that they do not have to feel anxious or depressed over what is going on, but he will not help taxpayers with their own money. It is absurd!
1300875321944748032 2020-09-02 03:17:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe I can find a way to make money on all this damage.
1300874544656322563 2020-09-02 03:13:55 +0800 <dmhossley> @RonaldKlain trump you are one of the most jealous people i have ever seen. You wish you had Dr. Fauci's education or respect. You lack both and are not capable of ever achieving either.  You are just an ignorant ass. You don't like name calling? Too bad. That is all you do.
1300873109533331456 2020-09-02 03:08:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @SenSchumer Trump does not want to give money to taxpayers, instead he wants to spend taxpayer money. 25million to a PR group to spread propaganda that all is well and we don't have to be anxious or depressed donald trump will save us. Well i for one reject him spending our money that way.
1300871635084488705 2020-09-02 03:02:21 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Maybe we should all make fun of him! I remember his making fun of disabled people. I wonder how he would like it.
1300870957779816454 2020-09-02 02:59:40 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Teachers union in russia is advising teachers to refuse russia's vaccine. We should advise all Americans to refuse trumps vaccine. Trump wants everyone to take a vaccine that has not been proven to be safe and effective
1300864909715165185 2020-09-02 02:35:38 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump While you are there find out what they are going to do to the coward who shot Jacob Blake 7 times in the back. Don't encourage them to gloss over it. You racist ass just because that man is black you are trying to let that coward cop off.
1300862935963664384 2020-09-02 02:27:47 +0800 <dmhossley> @CreateRealityOf @RepsForBiden Will anyone ever forget what asshole donald trump said about him. The fact is trump said that because he was jealous. trump has never done anything courageous in his life. He has lied and cheated his way through life.
1300861988172689408 2020-09-02 02:24:01 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Who cares!
1300861824989114370 2020-09-02 02:23:22 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump What the hell do you know about football or any other sports? Golf is not a sport it is a pastime. Don't you have bone spurs?. Isn't that how you got out of serving our country or was that just another lie? Is there anything real about asshole donald trump?
1300860748709670912 2020-09-02 02:19:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @NBA Actually people are tired of your whiny talk and all your lies. Go golfing thats what obese men do. Leave our real sportsmen alone. They don't have ANY desire to listen to your shit.
1300859872859361281 2020-09-02 02:15:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump Do you want to know what makes me anxious and depressed?  YOU and all your lies. Now you want to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to put out propaganda telling us everything is ok. We are not stupid we know its not ok. Your base will believe that crap but most of us won't.
1300833495472902146 2020-09-02 00:30:48 +0800 <dmhossley> @ZackCz Could be that he had that bowel problem looked at or could have been a drug overdose. Who knows. One thing we know is that he will not tell the truth. We will have to wait until he is gone from DC then the books will really hit the fan. The history books will tell the truth
1300832561904660488 2020-09-02 00:27:05 +0800 <dmhossley> @itsJeffTiedrich My understanding is that it is a toupee that's why it is different colors. I was told that, but I can not verify it only trump can do that
1300826653371830273 2020-09-02 00:03:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump The democrats and republicans are disgusted with donald trump.
1300824793009315852 2020-09-01 23:56:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @RepsForBiden Excuse me? Who's favorite president? I think you did have a stroke. And it left you brain damaged. What normal human being dies the insane and dangerous things you do.
1300824039796203520 2020-09-01 23:53:13 +0800 <dmhossley> @JustVent6 @realDonaldTrump This is trumps america. God protect us from his tyranny.  Trump is a demogorgon Trump is a dictator wannabe
1300823385690312710 2020-09-01 23:50:37 +0800 <dmhossley> @sarr_flare07 @JustVent6 @realDonaldTrump This is trumps america. Is this what we, as americans, want for our country? I think not. Fight against dictator trump.
1300822734507827200 2020-09-01 23:48:02 +0800 <dmhossley> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I usually go to DC every year but will not be going again until the trump clan is gone and the peoples house is put back to original condition. You people have some nerve destroying the white house. So many presidents and first ladies have lived there and non of them destroyed it
1300818948993306631 2020-09-01 23:33:00 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @NBA I trust our media to fact check trump. Trump is the most dangerous president we have ever had. His insanity makes him dangerous. The man does not know how to tell the truth. I could not care about the stock market. I care about you taking away social security and medicare.
1300818147453407233 2020-09-01 23:29:49 +0800 <dmhossley> @ProjectLincoln Actually he is the most dangerous president in history. Our forefathers tried to protect us against a trump. He just s**ts all over the protections. The man is obviously insane and that makes him very dangerous
1300815996203290624 2020-09-01 23:21:16 +0800 <dmhossley> @HillaryClinton He is losing it big time.
1300792063139753988 2020-09-01 21:46:10 +0800 <dmhossley> @TeamJoe @JoeBiden And donald trump does not.
1300791492445974533 2020-09-01 21:43:53 +0800 <dmhossley> @WhiteHouse It is too remarkable. Why would you push a vaccine that is not proven safe. Sounds a bit like genocide to me. But not surprising coming from donald trump.
1300784663254925317 2020-09-01 21:16:45 +0800 <dmhossley> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @NBA The truth is people are tired of donald trump.  What in hell does he know about sports? His putting a ball around? We have to back our sports teams not denigrate them. And what the hell does trump know about ratings? He should pay attention to his own!
1300782183578251264 2020-09-01 21:06:54 +0800 <dmhossley> @Ronees_2_Cents @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trump is a liar and cheater. He has proved that over and over.
1300781686200971264 2020-09-01 21:04:56 +0800 <dmhossley> @bmjmk @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So that's the defence ? I watch the video over &amp; over and did not see a weapon.. Cops can now shoot you in the back 7 times then lie about the victim having a weapon. What has happened to America?

1300629468768239616 2020-09-01 11:00:04 +0800 <dmhossley> @yesIwill_Yes @beardomike @SecAzar So who can my family sue if something goes wrong with a rushed vaccine. It is so irresponsible to rush "operation warp speed" a vaccine. I decided i will not allow anyone to inject anything into my body just so that crazy man can look good.
