Microbiology experts have stated a mask doesn’t do anything. It’s like a mosquito going through a chain link fence. It mostly depends on your own immune system. Also herd immunity needs to happen for the virus to dissipate! Research
1312052090294939648 2020-10-02 23:29:29 +0800 <timothyrwoolsey> @Acosta He condemned this over and over again in the past. If you were an honest journalist you would call Joe Biden out publicly to condemn white supremacy and segregation! It won’t happen because you are not a journalist,you are only a shill of the Dem party! America knows! Not working

Common sense and reality doesn’t compute in their brains. President Trump has kept his promises and before the China virus had built the greatest economy the world has known for all! He will build it again!
