I've been looking into how cross races use IVF due to incompatible reproduction. It appears that Mother Nature is against some types of admixture based on the respective incompatible genetics. Race mixing is cruel, ignorant &amp; irresponsible.

Sue promotes diversity even though it's evident that diverse people adhere to their culture no matter where they are.

THAT is why it has been made legal &amp; also why accomms have been put in place for other major celebrations or a blind eye taken.

1331939953933131776 2020-11-26 20:36:45 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> Good point. Western "Powers That Be" are known for thrusting the well-being of minorities ahead of the majority. So why should minorities NOT be "first in line" for this wonderful vaccine? NB - NO ONE should take it.

Don't be fooled - this is not about "fighting racism". It's up to you and your in-group/s to decide whether or not you will be vaccinated

We were going along very nicely yet somehow we all suddenly hit a brick wall where Anne Boleyn &amp; Anne Frank are both black, our young ones don't know whether they're male or female &amp; hubby tells me there's a massive movement against white people thanks to NGO's. WTF?

African slaves' life expectancy was 3 X longer than European slaves. There would be millions more Africans if it weren't for the horrific castration of Black slaves where survival rate was 10%.

There was no need for farming, planning, delayed gratification or K-selection strategy as they had all they needed in their environment. Drought was the main reason for conflict between regions. Bantu wreaked genocides.

1321205087067271168 2020-10-28 05:40:14 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @thespacepirate I lived in West Kensington, Shep's Bush &amp; Finsbury Park late 80's. They were building Fins Park mosque when I moved to Oz in 1990. I lived on the same street &amp; didn't have pleasant experiences walking past it on my way to the tube.

It started when I saw that in-group preferences are a reality (LGBT, BLM, ANTIFA, Feminism) yet White in-groups &amp; male in-groups were frowned upon. Now I see that children benefit more from households where there is a father.

Yemini no longer works with Robinson since being under Levant's wing. Robinson was in iso due to death threats from Muslim inmates. He was severely mistreated the previous time he was in jail.

1318212108283097089 2020-10-19 23:27:12 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @WitsendClose @WakeAustralia Mostly but maybe not on the balancing act part. Many are moving away from Victoria &amp; Western countries as they are not as desirable as they were prior to Covid?
1318206336232927233 2020-10-19 23:04:16 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII Of course it is a good reason. I should legitimately be able to query the stupid decisions re: Holodomor, Holocaust &amp; 1066 Invasion. Don't get me started on Henry VIII's religious dalliances - he was another one who liked to dally with scripture which resulted in decapitations.
1318202121422974978 2020-10-19 22:47:31 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @WakeAustralia VIC needs to send a few people on their way.
1318201743918821377 2020-10-19 22:46:01 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @WakeAustralia There was a MSM opinion article earlier (paraphrase) "if you don't like it maybe you should leave".  Western economies have been in the process of being crippled for at least 2 decades.  Foreign students have been a recent $prop up in Melb.  Manufacturing memory here is strong.
1318195079421464576 2020-10-19 22:19:32 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> What if heavily invaded regions are using Covid as a deterrent? Interstates &amp; refugees used to gravitate to Victoria. Melbourne was The Most Liveable City for a few years. Now they're moving out. Ditto in Europe "going home". Is it a balancing act? Your thoughts @WakeAustralia ?

1318184049337270274 2020-10-19 21:35:42 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII Islam gets a bad rap because they don't respect all people. There have been many court cases regarding "the call to prayer" in western countries. It's pretty obvious that it's going to offend many people. Why was this beaut banned by a Muslim Council?   https://t.co/fzS9l2sQM0
1318175082401779714 2020-10-19 21:00:04 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII I agree. It's highly likely that your blood ancestors were Zoroastrians. They would have converted to the then religiously alien Islam due to the invasion as they wanted their lineage to survive. I'm amazed it survives. Would you consider reverting back to honour your ancestors?
1318164369742516230 2020-10-19 20:17:30 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII Islam definitely started off as peaceful. I prefer the Medina era. Islam was terrible from the Mecca period. So much bloodshed, jizya &amp; oppression. It's good to still see many churches &amp; other religious acceptance in Iran.

1318159337294942209 2020-10-19 19:57:30 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII I hear that Zoroastrians are a growing group in India too. I recall hearing a few years ago that it was all but gone. The UK speak of Freddie Mercury as their own but his origin is Persian. One of my fave journo's is Rita Panahi who has dual Australian/Iranian citizenship.

1318155456942989312 2020-10-19 19:42:05 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII I met a lovely Zoroastrian family in Australia (back in the 1990's) who had beautiful Persian wall murals. They served me tea from the finest decanter. Do you keep any of your Zoroastrian traditions?
1318153580776361985 2020-10-19 19:34:38 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII There are many different accounts. Some scholars say yes, others say no. They rely hadith as a back up which doesn't always correlate.
1318153210020810752 2020-10-19 19:33:10 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII Hadith says she had to put her dolls away &amp; stop playing outside with the other girls. That doesn't sound like a 17 / 19 year old circa 600 AD. It was normal for girls to be married young. One of the English Kings married a very young girl. They didn't know of internal damage.
1318148992761356289 2020-10-19 19:16:24 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII Maybe there are fake Muslim scholars just as there are fake Muslims like you suggest ISIS &amp; Taliban are. They certainly pledge their allegiance to Allah.
1318148265431298051 2020-10-19 19:13:31 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @Philipake_baba @XrXIII It was biologically impossible either due to internal damage or aged spermatozoa.

It wasn't the global norm due to lower life expectancy.  I'm happy you have had an education. What region are your ancestors from?

"What would you do if you discovered a massive island where people were living an Australian Aboriginal way of life &amp; how would you protect their way of life based on your values"?
1306957400855859200 2020-09-18 22:05:01 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @TheChChCharles @rashnok @hopenothate Label any organisation as you wish. So will I. It's not "shocking and surprising" at all. It's natural for people all over our planet to have a primary preference towards their own kind. You still haven't given an answer because you can't. Or daren't.

C'mon Charles! At least suggest who'd have been better with the treatment of Australian Aboriginals based on Discovery metrics.

They were mostly good eggs. Bad eggs used to be ostracised &amp; whittled out. Sadly, it seems like bad eggs now get promoted.

1302958935633063936 2020-09-07 21:16:32 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @mrbangla Do you think that Chinese, Somalians, Pakistanis etc would be concerned if they were told that they would be a minority in their own countries within 50 years? Would Chileans be uncomfortable knowing that the most popular boys' name was "Huang"?
1302954937651924999 2020-09-07 21:00:39 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> @JoesGuy Hence why I used the word "may". I'm not convinced that it's as bad as we are told it is. I'm not a fan of Dan but the inevitable circumstances were not in his favour. He has egg on his face &amp; he's too proud to wipe it off &amp; pull his head in. It's embarrassing.

It's awful that protesters may be putting others at risk due to an inexplicable &amp; illogically extreme lockdown. It shouldn't be like this.

We're on a 1/4 acre. The ground is very soggy due to all the recent rain so we can't bury them. It's a conundrum.

Why can an entourage of 400 VIC AFL people hang out at the pool bar? Why did Danni Minogue, Nicole Kidman &amp; Keith Urban get to go straight home? Why isn't Dan releasing his "map" before the Saturday protests? SMH

1301118660837220353 2020-09-02 19:23:57 +0800 <DawnieBrowning> The ref is to a pregnant mother of 2 who posted a Ballarat event on FB about a Peaceful Protest on Sat 5th Sept. She was arrested &amp; taken into custody an hour before her ultrasound appointment. She encouraged the wearing of masks. If masks don't work then WHY are we wearing them?

However, countries experiencing 2nd waves have decided not to go back into lockdown, some citing the personal stress it causes. France &amp; UK 1,000, Spain 8000 new cases.
