1326058230603108352 2020-11-10 15:04:53 +0800 <bernieshrugs> @RealJamesWoods Exactly. Give it a few months and the news will recall the summer of protests where some from both sides were violent.
1326021474788864000 2020-11-10 12:38:50 +0800 <bernieshrugs> Since truth is being changed in front of us. For the record...Trump has openly gay richard grenell on his cabinet. Also false, Joe is not the first pres to support gay marriage... Again Trump.
1326020977751281664 2020-11-10 12:36:52 +0800 <bernieshrugs> @PinkNews Bluntly false and I know it. Shameful lie.

Trump has repeatedly said he has no issues with it. He even highlighted his support in his nomination acceptance speech at the Republican Convention.

He does not have full control on platform and openly fought to remove this. He has hired and promoted openly gay activists as his closest advisors.

1322650629567770624 2020-11-01 05:24:18 +0800 <bernieshrugs> @thehill And, predictably, there will be one the morning of the election that puts them within the margin of error. And however the election goes, they will disavow all the insane polls showing 16+ Biden win and claim they were the best polls once again.
1322624848682577920 2020-11-01 03:41:51 +0800 <bernieshrugs> @Coylerspoiler @realDonaldTrump He says... As if Democrats haven't been burning down and looting cities for 8 months. #oppositeday

She is spot on in her synopsis of "cancel culture" and how it serves to seed the hate it claims to disavow. She only woke up due to her "cancellation".

1317725411233550337 2020-10-18 15:13:14 +0800 <bernieshrugs> @Cernovich A natural "right", by definition... Cannot obligate the labor of another. These are not rights ... Rights provide and protect others to pursue this for themselves. And don't confuse your willingness to force others to work as any form of compassion.

What a stupid uninformed...and irresponsible  comment to make. If any insiting is occurring it is from comments like this.
