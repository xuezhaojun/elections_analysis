1344065967295504387 2020-12-30 07:41:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @TeresaM51981532 vanky will eat her alive! Let the fur fly!
1344065265844289540 2020-12-30 07:38:25 +0800 <JUthergi> No doubt!   Apparently KY is the closest the US has come to socialism, but mcConsAll hates socialism so KY became our bigliest Welfare State!
1344059837135675406 2020-12-30 07:16:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @Goldbdoug @lifesafeast I thought trump said this? RIP Bluto

1344056418291351552 2020-12-30 07:03:16 +0800 <JUthergi> There is a thread, ever so fragile dividing Civilization from Anarchy.  Our Constitution strengthens this fragile thread.  In order to form a more perfect union we could strive to be a socially responsible Democratic Republic!  What has the elite done in the past 50yrs for WTP?
1344053240284016641 2020-12-30 06:50:38 +0800 <JUthergi> How long has 2020 lasted? Is it really almost over?
1344049387467583488 2020-12-30 06:35:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepJohnKatko  sir? Did you vote for the paltry stimulus being offered to YOUR CONSTITUENTS?  Did you vote fro $b in foreign aid while food lines grow? Is it true that you voted to not help communities? Never expected you to defund OUR PDs!  BTW, who won the Presidential Election
1344048069395025921 2020-12-30 06:30:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Hold on to your loved ones &amp; call your Mom! TY DR! Been clinging to hope but slipping bit by bit...

There are none for trump, he could start riots with bogus claims &amp; people could get hurt.  Of what consequence?
1343981494054871045 2020-12-30 02:05:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Say it ain't so, sir?  https://t.co/E4fFWDe2R6

Evolved bc over the past several decades the parties lost their way, intermingling ideals, corporate support &amp; quest for power.  Point being, they do not &amp; have not made our union more perfect or prioritized the common good of WTP...  https://t.co/cpAtN4nj3g

1343968944114307072 2020-12-30 01:15:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Free speech. So confusing that I can't yell fire in a crowded place but trump can yell fire, the sky is falling, they're coming for your guns and want to burn your churches or whatever he pleases to invite riots &amp; violence?
1343966889761009664 2020-12-30 01:07:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @kylegriffin1 If he golfs every day from now until his eviction, he'll have spent almost one entire year of his time in office, out of work.  Aren't we due some sort of tax break or at the least, our money back?

1343952276432498689 2020-12-30 00:09:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Don't forget that trump is offering free room &amp; board @ his DC hotel to all Proud Boys that support him!  Pass the word!   Free rooms at trump hotel for his people!

Thanks, good to know he doesn't actually eat children. i'm still concerned though.  You're right about the atrocities, President Eisenhower warned us about the military/industrial complex but our elected elite saw $.

We do have free speech, so in reality he can't allow you something you already have, right?  i've heard talk of this chosen one.

I know how distraught you must be that more people die everyday from your virus than on 911, but you really should be packing up your stuff.
1342639984365465602 2020-12-26 09:14:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we do a citizen's arrest on this slug? Obstruction of vital governmental operations?   Being so ugly as a living being that his momma tied raw meat around his neck just to get the dogs to play with him?  Anything to remove the psycho behind the madman?

1342628816548716550 2020-12-26 08:30:29 +0800 <JUthergi> It's getting to the point where WTP would rather suffer than get some of our own money back from those who have killed so many without recourse.  Isn't there some ancient curse we could chant until trump the terrible &amp; his minions are gone from history?  Calling all Wiccans? Help

1341451819042664449 2020-12-23 02:33:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir. You have a leak &amp; a spy very close to you &amp; the betrayals...oh how they plot against us all.  Can't you fire them???
1341450495114801152 2020-12-23 02:28:15 +0800 <JUthergi> "so much done for the people"? Hohoho haha ROFL!  What are you smoking?  https://t.co/Sem0L7SdpT
1341449805898391554 2020-12-23 02:25:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, don't let mcConsAll take credit for relief bill!  We know you did the tough negotiations! He'll betray you again!  He is not loyal! You saved his career &amp; he never could have won w/o YOUR endorsement!!  You should replace him.  He said you lost EC to Biden!
1341446796770504704 2020-12-23 02:13:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh poor jr.   Didn't vanky tell you?  The $ is to grease pakistani palms, daddy &amp; vanky have already got permits for a new hotel.  Seems like you &amp; eric will be left "holding the bag"! Told you to turn states evidence in NYC before they betrayed you!  Last chance for immunity...
1341444891893788673 2020-12-23 02:05:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Today? Is it, could it be? Is today 25th Ammendment Day?? Oh happy happy joy joy joy to the whole world!!!  What? What are they waiting for, Christmas?  Oh, well...
1341443651264757764 2020-12-23 02:01:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Discussed? Now i feel disgust...
1341439700788244486 2020-12-23 01:45:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Of the few miles of existing fence that was replaced, does anyone know how much is still standing? Saw a lot of vids with high winds knocking down sections as well as areas too close to river built in unstable soils. Last heard was lumpy trumpy claim of 500 miles...
1341437303391219713 2020-12-23 01:35:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @goldenluv10 Why is it "corp citzs" get to write off operational expenses but Human Citizens don't?  They write off rent mtgs telecoms internet autos lunches yachts office equip &amp; supplies, entertainment, food etc etc etc.  WTP have expenses too!   Pretty good indicators that WTP don't count!
1341432574477017088 2020-12-23 01:17:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @NotTodayMAGAts Been promoting the use of the word trump, as a curse word worthy of payment to the swear jar... Oh trump! I just stepped in a pile of dogtrump! Screw that neighbor's dog, this is bulltrump! trump you!!! asstrump! Muthertrumper! trump y'all!  Works for me how bout you?
1341429719443619840 2020-12-23 01:05:42 +0800 <JUthergi> 141 days! That is the total days "worked" by sens.???  This is why our country is shaken to our foundation.  Our sen is comprised of the MOST UNDER WORKED &amp; OVERPAID employees ever &amp; they don't even work for WTP?  Isn't this stealing? Theft of services?   A SCAM???
1341422085458059266 2020-12-23 00:35:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  This is most likely of no interest to you, but I just wanted these facts to be part of a wannabe, but failed EX president's official record for all of history...
1341421269623910401 2020-12-23 00:32:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @progressive_va @brianklaas Perhaps we could refer to leadership as "special" or even "precious"?
1341412061914521610 2020-12-22 23:55:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @docrussjackson Much the same way hitler used the am portable radios
1341408948256186370 2020-12-22 23:43:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  In case you don't go away as you promised us you would when your opponent beat you by more votes than any election in history...  Keep it up bucko!
1341408038717157376 2020-12-22 23:39:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Well?  You threaten us with a good time, then just change your mind?  We were counting on you to be a man if your word!
1341406118212472832 2020-12-22 23:31:55 +0800 <JUthergi> From your lips to trump's ear...
1341404647513317376 2020-12-22 23:26:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Cruel April fool's joke? It was the brightest day of the last 4 yrs...
1341152290418376705 2020-12-22 06:43:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr Kinda looks like you are the cause of all our suffering...now you have proven it!!!  https://t.co/noJhA4ayUD
1341150625732698112 2020-12-22 06:36:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @bryanbehar @DianHeymann How foolish of me, thought you were talking about his Russian handler, melanoma.
1341149964790095881 2020-12-22 06:34:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Just tell our dotard in chief anything he wants to hear...just get him out before he crashes the world's 2nd longest surviving democratic government!!!
1341148167828627461 2020-12-22 06:26:55 +0800 <JUthergi> That's A LOT of US TAX $ that could feed US Citizens if there was really an America First Policy and not the trumpian prime directive of "me first"!  https://t.co/nKLI3KGNua
1341146510558375937 2020-12-22 06:20:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Creativity in creating human space is now illegal? Thanks trump. Your taj mahal failure &amp; towers are the most garrish designs on US soil &amp; you now you want to impose your idea of "flair" upon us all?
1341087158413737984 2020-12-22 02:24:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  UnfuQinbelieveable! msm was needed to expose the character of the candidates we're forced to vote for!  WTP can never again be forced to vote for the lesser of 2 evils again... LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!  What if our children find this? What do we say? Shame on us!
1341086308844892160 2020-12-22 02:21:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @atrupar Whatever trump is planning it's enough to send this hard baller wild billy bad to the dugout!
1341083780078063616 2020-12-22 02:11:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Sarge knows!!!
1341083351759896578 2020-12-22 02:09:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Royalty has never really given a 2nd thought to the well being if it's subjects!  I feel like we're in some fuedal english story waiting for Robin Hood, or Guardians of the Galaxy or The Justice League, or x men or  WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD GUYS GONE?
1341082348285210625 2020-12-22 02:05:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Really, i'm not snickering or even laughing on the inside over this...i fell down &amp; am laughing so hard i can't get up!
1341063570436579328 2020-12-22 00:50:45 +0800 <JUthergi> the EX pres says everything is under control...??? Hug your loved ones, gather in the safest place, bend over, put your head between your knees, get ready then kiss your butts goodbye!
1341062514994458624 2020-12-22 00:46:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @OldParaTRP Disheartening thinking of the brave m&amp;w that sacrificed so much to preserve the ideals of our great Republic protecting WTP from horrors of a dictatorship. It is simply incomprehensible that the elite have thrown it all away...  God save USA? We're sorry about this trump thing!
1341058627382206466 2020-12-22 00:31:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Gop DEFUNDS POLICE cities towns &amp; villages!
1341058036346081280 2020-12-22 00:28:46 +0800 <JUthergi> This too  https://t.co/Hd7tHyrtXn
1341048869006827520 2020-12-21 23:52:20 +0800 <JUthergi> It's almost as if it has dawned on our elected elite how badly they have screwed up over the past several decades.   The house is on fire. The walls are tumbling down &amp; they're grabbing whatever valuables they can before running for cover!  Where is the Justice League???
1341046636940840960 2020-12-21 23:43:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @LuLuRoche @HappyBitchFace @JoeKoffee Deductions for "corp citizens" nearly endless but human Citizens can't even deduct life operational expenses, (housing food communications auto office supply etc)!  Isn't that discrimination against humans?
1341045732225245189 2020-12-21 23:39:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @AmyAThatcher They'll claim state governor can't determine Election results. Only electors, of which 26 red states will try to overturn elect. 1vote / state. Vp final vote.  Jan 5th could be a day of infamy remembered as the last day of OUR REPUBLIC...
1341043397101035525 2020-12-21 23:30:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @anyonewantchips Did he give up on his Mt Rushmore dream?

1341040653770383361 2020-12-21 23:19:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @5691Yenoh New pvt jet! Just like sen loafer's or joel osteen's! I can afford it now!
1341039858224144385 2020-12-21 23:16:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Even more disturbing is that he's already proven he doesn't need the Army.  Remember his federal law enforcement officers in DC Church photo op? Remember Portland? Michigan?  With barr's help he can legally sic his new federalized Gestapo style militia to kill us.  Legal...
1341036618401128448 2020-12-21 23:03:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @Richinnj3 @DecoherenceWave Been hoping someone could find &amp; post this classic! TY! So timely!
1341035572362670084 2020-12-21 22:59:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @DebHaalandNM Looking forward to the generational wisdom that can heal our lands &amp; all people...before it's too late. Congratulations!
1341034896630886401 2020-12-21 22:56:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Exactly how will you do all that hard work trying to be important in GA?   Working as an advisor to sen &amp; congress now too?  So unbelievably incredible!  Weren't you supposed to be in NYC? SDNY &amp; NY AG looking forward to when you will grace them with your presence, princess...
1341032503302340608 2020-12-21 22:47:18 +0800 <JUthergi> If there was ever a need for Robin Hood &amp; the good men of Sherwood Forest, it is here &amp; now!
1341032114238709761 2020-12-21 22:45:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't wait untill we're all waiting in line for our Government Cheese! Maybe they can make it orange this time???
1341031556119490560 2020-12-21 22:43:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @Alyssa_Milano Isn't there a spell you could use on mcConsAll from The Book of Shadows?  At the very least could you turn him into a slug?  TY  Asking for a fan
1341027911508369409 2020-12-21 22:29:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Which is worse? mcConsAll's financial crumbs for OUR CITIZENS or just lining up so he can spit in our faces? Is there even a difference here?
1341026941055488000 2020-12-21 22:25:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews @ThatLawGuyKev Jan 5th will be a difficult day...
1341022872572190724 2020-12-21 22:09:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @Advancedape2E Ikr? Is nothing sacred to those miscreants in the shining city on the hill?

1340804164016869379 2020-12-21 07:39:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @JayDavidMurphy @Forbes Great new Christmas gift that all Americans will enjoy &amp; keep forever as heirlooms?  Christmas pics of children of all ages flipping the bird to trump!  Hell, make a biz out it... i'll pay!
1340803223133798400 2020-12-21 07:36:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Please read
1340802843821961223 2020-12-21 07:34:43 +0800 <JUthergi> WE'VE BEEN ON OUR OWN since you got to be head honcho in sen!!! YOU &amp; nobody else ABONDONDED US back in May when house sent you Cares Act!  Anyone else that caused this much suffering death &amp; destruction would have been shame into hari-kari!  Try it, you'll like it...
1340800749618556930 2020-12-21 07:26:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Why lie if being a criminal is an honored profession in trumplandia?
1340798269283332097 2020-12-21 07:16:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Sorry. You're just too incredible &amp; unbelievable for us to think you would help us before you protect corps from liability if the trump virus or vaccines turn us into vegetables or dead meat.  What? you like dead meat?   Heaven help us! This gov guy says he's gonna help!
1340790052109111296 2020-12-21 06:43:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr! Mean old comedians @ SNL make fun of the trumpy family AGAIN?  Too bad you can't laugh with us, makes us laugh at y'all a lil bit more! You made a funny though. Referring to the elite as if it were others &amp; not you! Good 1, ROFL!  BTW so when you mtg with SDNY &amp; NY AG?
1340788368351883270 2020-12-21 06:37:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is it one of the wealthiest most influentially powerful nation's on earth can starve it's people to grow it's military, even bigger?  The elected elite know this, can fix this but they chose to throw us crumbs...is mitch pushing for more pay raises for himself?
1340786598284308484 2020-12-21 06:30:10 +0800 <JUthergi> X man wannabe? Thinks he has wolverine powers now that he's back with his lips on the royal orange derriere?  Go turd, sorry spell check malfunction, ted!
1340785785054908417 2020-12-21 06:26:56 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and since impeachment didn't work the 1st time you are not trying again?  Could you explain that?
1340770002258055170 2020-12-21 05:24:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Still not a single cab member or vp brave enough to draft 25th Ammendment?  How about if we search each one for a modicum of courage, combine them &amp; shove it down veep's throat?  STILL not enough courage?  We be doomed, huh?
1340768859830284292 2020-12-21 05:19:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @ChiefSoOWsP @StephenMCarter4 @preising @Juliet_notRomeo @jonathanvswan Considering both pros &amp; cons of our Space Force/ Guardians of the Galaxy, wouldn't we get a better ROI if we funded a Justice League to solve problems on earth before the elected elite screw up space too?  My apologies Chief, I know how hard it is to find work but WTP need help!
1340699769975558146 2020-12-21 00:45:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @Sandyk5251 @Advancedape2E Is it time for people that love this country but not the current gov, (definition of patriotism), to get a rebrand.  The most despicable &amp; corrupted of the elected elite often wrap themselves in OUR flag calling themselves "Patriots", perhaps we could call ourselves Citizen Pats?
1340698191281401860 2020-12-21 00:38:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... He's nearly there, God save OUR REPUBLIC!!!
1340692516719513601 2020-12-21 00:16:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Here i am thinking that what most people call stars are actually holes in the top of the box in which we're kept!?!
1340691085992071169 2020-12-21 00:10:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! That lou dobbins guy has betrayed you again with his false propaganda! He &amp; fox entertainment are trying to steal the election!
1340686682803351553 2020-12-20 23:53:08 +0800 <JUthergi> May WTP be the light for each other leading us through the coming days of darkness...
1340685846920507393 2020-12-20 23:49:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Ratings would be through the roof!
1340683814788542466 2020-12-20 23:41:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @thomaskaine5 Yep! That's how I can keep clinging to hope...  As a  lifelong student of Architectural Design &amp; Engineering it is difficult to look at nature, all life &amp; not see repetitive common intelligent design. Gotta blame that on on something, right?
1340681880979517442 2020-12-20 23:34:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, i can now tell my wife that it's not just my irrational fears...
1340681462006296585 2020-12-20 23:32:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Legal ethics?
1340681103515021318 2020-12-20 23:30:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Calling all fellow latibulators! America needs us! Step out of our corners now!  (If trump is still talking rigged elections &amp; Martial Law though, head for the bunkers!)
1340676684480204801 2020-12-20 23:13:24 +0800 <JUthergi> He just keeps winning, please make it stop!  Giving credit where due, trump did say there'll be so much winning we'd beg him stop!  The one &amp; only truth I  heard from the EX 1 term impeached biggest 2x vote loser ever pres.!  PLEASE! Make him stop!!!
1340674854736048130 2020-12-20 23:06:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Doesn't anyone else want to celebrate the joy &amp; unity of brotherhood on 21st AMMENDMENT DAY?
1340672074378072065 2020-12-20 22:55:05 +0800 <JUthergi> May your biz grow into a behemoth bringing chaos &amp; shame to the treachery &amp; corruption of the elected elite!  May you become the new msm of OUR REPUBLIC that exposes the truth that WTP deserve!  Truths that hold scoundrels to accountability!  Thank you for your gift of truth...
1340446204623204353 2020-12-20 07:57:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Jan 6th would be the official date of election winner certified. Let President Biden begin then.  Inaug is ceremonial, why spend the money when we have video?  Real Presidents don't care about crowd size!
1340445497954361344 2020-12-20 07:54:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @Exhausted_dad @jonathanvswan Even then, is there any politician we can accept at their word?
1340444823615119361 2020-12-20 07:52:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Could there really be any doubt that their silence, for years now, enabled trump? Still thinging that mcConsAll is the master mind &amp; they have assembled a team of like minded Fascists, now ready to go?  Hoping the world will now help us...
1340443532994240512 2020-12-20 07:46:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @StephenMCarter4 @preising @Juliet_notRomeo @jonathanvswan Likely in DC, in case barr can't justify legal call to Martial Law. Standing by &amp; standing back to be American Gestapo?
1340442914837688322 2020-12-20 07:44:29 +0800 <JUthergi> In a normal world... trump had barr creating legal scenarios in which to initiate his coup d'etat. Photo op @ dc church&amp; attacking peaceful protestors wi use of fed "law enforcement" merely a trial run to see if he could get away wi same tactics used by Hitler...Hold on tight!
1340441612565032961 2020-12-20 07:39:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Is there still doubt?
1340441420646277120 2020-12-20 07:38:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step, inching ever closer to trumpian anarchy?  How many times will he tell us his plans before we believe him?  He spoke of 3 terms, Lifetime rule like china's xi &amp; wishing "his" subjects treated him like nk lil kim's people, forced worship!  Are we next?
1340439568831705093 2020-12-20 07:31:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Now? PLEASE? Could today be 25th AMMENDMENT DAY?  What will it take???
1340439072762957829 2020-12-20 07:29:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Cowards don't take action unless it's to jump back into the dark shadows...
1340438141493194757 2020-12-20 07:25:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @MelissaHa @TeresaM51981532 @NotDevinsMom Cozy Bear, nice name to make us think oh how cute! Still frightening &amp; dangerous! The symbol of Russian aggression!!!  trumpy bear, nice name. So cute! But just as dangerous &amp; worse bc trumpy bear wants your money too!

1340436296234352640 2020-12-20 07:18:11 +0800 <JUthergi> He's awfully busy, you know? Focusing on Apprentice 2.0,(losers edition), rigged elections, Martial Law, mal lago reno NYAG SDNY...
1340358678139056129 2020-12-20 02:09:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this a pic of the world's two most powerful men? No Look &amp; remember the powerful chosen one as he returns from the pvt "woodshed" mtg. This is a man overcome by fear &amp; impotence!

1340348711826825218 2020-12-20 01:30:10 +0800 <JUthergi> The founding fathers were truly prophetic...
1340347479670345730 2020-12-20 01:25:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Perfectly logical...
1340347114979778561 2020-12-20 01:23:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not?
1340346921592958977 2020-12-20 01:23:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast Does the proud of their butts lil boy group plan to be violent again?
1340343175941132292 2020-12-20 01:08:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @docrussjackson If you must, but we often use that term in reference to his evil twin, donnie destructo.
1340340591260004352 2020-12-20 00:57:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @DNI_Ratcliffe @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump But IT'S YOUR JOB to protect us from these attacks. Did you surrender to putin just as you've done with your virus?  Gee, do ya think that just maybe DAILY SECURITY BRIEFINGS have a purpose now?  WTP know IT IS NOT UNDER CONTROL if you say it is!

1340326390248386560 2020-12-20 00:01:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @BCOOL333 Didn't we decide in 2016 to not have anyone lead us?
1340323806691418114 2020-12-19 23:51:12 +0800 <JUthergi> But isn't that what our royal elected elite expect of us?
1340323158436491267 2020-12-19 23:48:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @ptozer207 Surprised he's not promoting donnie destructor's claim of new mnfctrs coming to build plants (not) &amp; vanky's 14m jobs she alone created.  They don't work as hard as me though...i alone created over quadrillion jobs!  Who do you believe? lol
1340319474512252938 2020-12-19 23:33:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Such a great feeling to be informed?
1340317066948177920 2020-12-19 23:24:25 +0800 <JUthergi> &amp; here is a man with an outstanding grasp for the obvious?

1340312109993893899 2020-12-19 23:04:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @The_Lone_Apple @susan_j_eaton @Amy_Siskind As are most of our problems...if only the elected elite focused on our problems, instead of their own problems of their own making...ty
1340093653105201153 2020-12-19 08:36:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Aren't you chair of the sen Intelligence committee? How could you not this? We saw the evidence in '16, reinforced in Mar 20 &amp; you opened the food to our enemies! 15 depts directly tied to the security of this nation!!! Where is your intelligence?
1340090922839781379 2020-12-19 08:25:48 +0800 <JUthergi> he did gain A LOT of weight didn't he?

1340089922447941635 2020-12-19 08:21:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @ericgarland Ooh ooh!  I know who did it! It's all Biden's fault! trump would never be so negligent as to let our enemies in the front door, right? Or is it another hoax that will disappear like a miracle? Running low on hope today...
1340088584817283073 2020-12-19 08:16:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank goodness!  I was so worried that our Royal Elite would stick to the prime directive of putting WTP first! It terrifies me to think that y'all might have had to sacrifice by going to the end of the line!  BTW any chance you're retiring soon?
1340086361064427525 2020-12-19 08:07:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Dambit gumby! How could you let Clintons Obama &amp; President Biden do this to us?  Whaat? You are still the pres &amp; this happened on your watch?   You surrendered to putin &amp; the virus that keeps killing us?  This must be hoax bc you wouldn't do that to us, right?
1340082001899040768 2020-12-19 07:50:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he get his Christmas pardon?
1340081704594235392 2020-12-19 07:49:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @tiredofit10 @thedailybeast Wealth rarely married for love, especially if the parents believe you to be chattel... All transactional.
1340080860528324608 2020-12-19 07:45:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @ColoradoDavidSu apprentice 2.0 the losers edition?
1340080038172119041 2020-12-19 07:42:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @justinamash Just another confused guy here. The proposal sounds great for working people but in light of the corruption WTP have endured these past decades would it not be a good law to punish elected elite? Unless of course y'all exempted yourselves from this punishment too???
1340078319975460865 2020-12-19 07:35:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @The_Lone_Apple @Amy_Siskind Wouldn't that lead to the Ministry of Truth we learned about in 1984?
1340077685805096964 2020-12-19 07:33:12 +0800 <JUthergi> This stolen meme is proof of need for The Fairness Doctrine...  https://t.co/x0AUbrd0vf
1340077071456989184 2020-12-19 07:30:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you Ms Siskind! Some of us have been praying to bring it back since 1987 when our "people first!" gop sold out to foreign &amp; domestic msm.  It is the only chance we have to rebuild the fourth estate...
1340076084856025094 2020-12-19 07:26:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @Sharybean @mtgreenee @realDonaldTrump Yeah! Just look at all those swamp creatures that got fired &amp; replaced with upstanding corp biz ldrs &amp; lobbyists in charge of the industries they left!  He hired the best people!  Are we up to 30 officials now charged &amp;/or convicted?
1340074057253969920 2020-12-19 07:18:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Wait just a minute here...  Who is this?   vanky is that you in disguise? Did your daddy put you up to this?  There is help for abuse survivors of dysfunctional family dynamics!
1340073002269110272 2020-12-19 07:14:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @FrankAmari2 @RWPUSA Seems like russia. Confirmed attacks on '16 Elections and further confirmations supposedly in Mar of their 8n5ent to attack 20 Election. If I were china iran no I would make my attack look like it came from russia. Games they play...
1340071137095643140 2020-12-19 07:07:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper C'mon folks! trump &amp; jared need to sell all that hydroxy chloroquine &amp; regeneron before he can sell his own vaccines.
1340070020890714114 2020-12-19 07:02:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Now why would our good friend putin call to congratulate our President Elect, then give mitch permission to do the same, then launch a Pearl Harbor Cyber Attack they've worked on since Mar. on same US Institutions w/ ldrs recently replaced by trump minnions?  No coincidence here?
1340068256485416960 2020-12-19 06:55:44 +0800 <JUthergi> When my wife kicks me out, quarantine is tough, she said my only hope is a mail order bride... Anyone know how much an Einstein Visa costs?  If it's more than the stimulus check i mma going to be lonely...
1340067230067924993 2020-12-19 06:51:39 +0800 <JUthergi> That's a bit unsettling. In this age of Orwellian Doublespeak where war is peace, guardians must mean attackers? Now we can look forward to bombs from space?
1340043674772762626 2020-12-19 05:18:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Although i believe that The US Constitution is truly a living document that can adapted to present times, it is not perfect, not are we. It is still the best on Earth! bigger concern that a contract is only as good as the lawyer defending it. Why can't our USC scholars guide us?
1340041927094382596 2020-12-19 05:11:06 +0800 <JUthergi> As much as I want to keep family squabbles at home, i seriously wonder if we might need foreign assistance after trump the terrible burns down the house!
1340040886865063936 2020-12-19 05:06:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Congratulations sir! you are certainly the bigliest &amp; winningest most incredibly unbelievable losingest EX pres ever, in all history!!!

1340038581696536577 2020-12-19 04:57:49 +0800 <JUthergi> wannabe first ladies &amp; the baby daddies that worship them like a princess?
1340037352929042436 2020-12-19 04:52:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump So when is your depo for the NY AG?  Looking forward to your meeting with SDNY too?
1340035648821063681 2020-12-19 04:46:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Such a wonderful self congratulatory statement!  Call me crazy but brief meetings, after acts of war that could bring this country to absolute ruin is well, the most pitifully cowardly lack of action I never thought i'd imagine. Thanks.  BTW who won the Presidential Election?
1340033734582685696 2020-12-19 04:38:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @beavis617 @richones1 @CosmoKatz69 TY for that description of the Cowardice that is our elected elite!

1339987186477916161 2020-12-19 01:33:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Consider the intelligence or as in this  case, the lack thereof, &amp; let it slide like water off a lame duck's back...  TY for your expertise! WTP care!

1339985943592394755 2020-12-19 01:28:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like they have financial dealings wi china too?
1339983701925617665 2020-12-19 01:19:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Worth consideration or did I go off the short pier on my long walk?  Thought I heard some billionaire talk about this as a way to rebuild economy. Insights?  Who wants to be a millionaire?  WTP will spend it , give to our communities, trust funds for kids &amp; work to make gov work!
1339981085711712259 2020-12-19 01:09:21 +0800 <JUthergi> So true! However, am still clinging to hope...
1339980843637493760 2020-12-19 01:08:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   HAPPY IMPEACHMENT DAY!!!
1339980511008215040 2020-12-19 01:07:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like no better time for mass Education classes to help all US Citizens learn to speak Russian?
1339979064153661442 2020-12-19 01:01:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Aren't you supposed to be the guy that prevents this? Sen Intelligence guy?
1339978695843471361 2020-12-19 00:59:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Has there ever been an enemy of the US that has received so much AID?   Has any enemy been so COMFORTable that the attacks just keep coming?  Will it ever be 25th AMMENDMENT DAY???
1339975216257245186 2020-12-19 00:46:01 +0800 <JUthergi> It's today?  Is today 25th AMMENDMENT DAY? Oh please let it be today!  Mr Rather, sir? Do you know why they have yet to initiate this action?  If it's pure cowardice of those in cab/vp will we have to change our motto? Land of the free &amp; home of the brave, excepting politicians?
1339973669385363457 2020-12-19 00:39:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @ExpendableWe Unholy chaos! Where the hell is batman?
1339956457891127299 2020-12-18 23:31:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @sandibachom TY! Step by step. Tried to send this mssg back in Jan. Recently used frog analogy too bc it is so accurate. Hold on tight, grand finale will be greatest act of vengeance!  Just as hitler lost interest in protecting his People, we have his minion trying the same here...

1339950917504929794 2020-12-18 23:09:28 +0800 <JUthergi> As cic, is trump eligible to be tried by Court Martial for dereliction if duty?
1339949587591794688 2020-12-18 23:04:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @BobWarth22 @essenviews Only for career politicians
1339949216341356545 2020-12-18 23:02:42 +0800 <JUthergi> So, the only reason to negate the people's right / privilege to vote us to help the gop remain in power? This randy dude is just another fine example for why we need term limits!
1339947796242325509 2020-12-18 22:57:04 +0800 <JUthergi> We got trumped!

1339942813702742016 2020-12-18 22:37:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @NZflyingkiwi @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Well gop would tell us that since he didn't accept a salary, he's broke. He had to sell stuff...
1339941389853986816 2020-12-18 22:31:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @JoJoFromJerz When the russians sent Sputnik into space they sent a monkey to see how it might survive. Propaganda! It was actually our pres getting A LOT of $! He performed so well it was tremendously terrific &amp; incredibly unbelievable!
1339939731472314368 2020-12-18 22:25:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @Revsparrow @JoJoFromJerz What a great story! Onondaga People have given so much. remain the oldest true form of Democracy on Earth.

Am sorry to be the messenger of bad news, please don't shoot me, but Doug is retired, next gen not interested. Only way to get it now is for specific fundraisers in community. Local church may be next fundraiser but not until spring.  R u cny?
1339690118370758662 2020-12-18 05:53:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  UnfuQinbelieveable! msm was needed to expose the character of the candidates we're forced to vote for!  WTP can never again be forced to vote for the lesser of 2 evils again... LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!  What if our children find this? What do we say? Shame on us!
1339687110123642880 2020-12-18 05:41:11 +0800 <JUthergi> John Hopkins study, not msm...

Many refer to it as the same star seen over Bethlehem Israel  They call it the Christmas Star!  Symbol of light love &amp; hope for all mankind!  Good song: Age of Aquarius
1339681363423858688 2020-12-18 05:18:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @waltshaub @navywife53sco Well, these "people", we minions are just doing their job. We all remember trump's own words " I love the uneducated" .
1339680047964311555 2020-12-18 05:13:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Rep Porter, your work is exemplary! You give us all hope!  ALL Reps should be held to your standards for ethical representation of WTP!  Those who will not aggressively pursue those that rape &amp; pillage OUR REPUBLIC should be censured, removed,   TARRED  &amp;  FEATHERED!!!
1339676615832457218 2020-12-18 04:59:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Winslow is not just another guy! Step by step we are led to the precipice... Can't we make today 25th AMMENDMENT DAY???  Without anyone of good character as vp or cab members to initiate proceedings,  WTP better hold on tight for the grand finale episode of trump the terrible!
1339674388237578242 2020-12-18 04:50:38 +0800 <JUthergi> msm IS profanity!
1339673947344936964 2020-12-18 04:48:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @TeresaM51981532 The Band Genesis produced an early album called Selling England by the pound. I wonder if they could rededicate it to America bc trump is breaking us up &amp; selling us for parts! Our EX president is the biggest risk to the security of WTP since the Brits burned down the WH!  Idea?
1339672559898529793 2020-12-18 04:43:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump More dead people sir EX?

1339669730169384964 2020-12-18 04:32:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @ZemanLynnZ @dazyjane410 @senatemajldr Please no offense to ppl struggling wi weight issues, but look at how much this despicable being has gained!  Winner of the FAT CAT    POSTER BOY award!  No offense to fat 4 legged cats either...
1339668568913408005 2020-12-18 04:27:31 +0800 <JUthergi> They could easily afford  a monthly stimulus of at least $1200/m until virus is controlled. The economic benes give cred to UBI. If pentgn cuts daily $2b/d budget by 10%, for just 1 day, elected elite could give each Boomer &amp; Millennial $1m grant, (144m ppl tot).  Real Stimulus!
1339662091494551560 2020-12-18 04:01:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Any of our legal experts out there that can tell me, Is TARRING &amp; FEATHERING legal?  Our elected elite are certainly deserving!  i truly believe that WTP would give our consent!  PS i do not sell tar or feathers.
1339658549430001665 2020-12-18 03:47:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @VABVOX Trump &amp; the trump virus must be eradicated, trump must be punished to pay for his crimes against humanity. If he doesn't, then those responsible for punishment of crimed will be the focus of our anger! Heaven help us...  Nobody hurts us &amp; gets away with it, ESPECIALLY our own!
1339656488307093504 2020-12-18 03:39:31 +0800 <JUthergi> A tax until we upgrade to a sustainable unhackable infrastructure, equitable  education for all, and the right to free medical. WTP been paying with our blood sweat &amp; tears the past 50 yrs. It's time the wealthy paid their fair share!  Who among them is against fairness?
1339654548634431489 2020-12-18 03:31:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @LuLuRoche Just gathered the courage to go dig snow...severely lacking the will. Maybe it will melt by Winter Solstice?
1339654021502660613 2020-12-18 03:29:42 +0800 <JUthergi> The answer will make us all feel bad, um...worse.
1339651544459980802 2020-12-18 03:19:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @navywife53sco Than you! Whenever i am feeling blue, this is the face i like to turn to! He could put a smile on whomever met him! Smiles to all...
1339625340298276864 2020-12-18 01:35:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step, we need to hold on tight cause it looks like this sore loser wants to make EVERYONE pay for mocking him!
1339624385121017856 2020-12-18 01:31:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir? No worries that the traitor lawyer could make you look like a joke. Not a chance of that EVER happening.  You come out the winner again!  Nobody could EVER do any better than you for, sir!
1339622777482063886 2020-12-18 01:25:33 +0800 <JUthergi> The very least they could do, being that inauguration is mostly ceremonial, is to let President Biden &amp; Co begin the date House/Sen certify EC Vote, Jan 6th?
1339619642508255232 2020-12-18 01:13:06 +0800 <JUthergi> She tried to uphold her oath but the oath breakers imprisoned her! There is so much ongoing damage... Were clinging to hope Ms Winner, but our ride is about to get a whole lot worse out here! Be strong! Some of us will not forget your bravery and patriotism!
1339618495999463428 2020-12-18 01:08:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we all add our signature of approval?
1339616445173526531 2020-12-18 01:00:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @darafaye @TeresaM51981532 Just call Ms Lorena Bobbitt. She can provide you with the "final solution"...
1339615867269750785 2020-12-18 00:58:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @mmpadellan shhh, remember these are the people with the protest signs telling trump opponents to smarten up &amp; get BRIAN!

1339607091695284224 2020-12-18 00:23:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @StephenKing Sir?  Could use your talent to bring us another horror movie?  One to last the rest of time? Begin story wi evil trump-like character, rises to pres, through incompetence &amp; malignant narcissism attempts 2nd US genocide &amp; all souls return to haunt elected elite forever more? Pls?
1339605224017768448 2020-12-18 00:15:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Order of the day? Just more high crimes!
1339603811556413443 2020-12-18 00:10:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Aside from you being so crackers graham, didn't anyone ever tell you how foolish you look trying to show emotion? Pretty sad, pretend anger, tears for $, and now compassion?
1339602581237088257 2020-12-18 00:05:18 +0800 <JUthergi> With so much resistance from team trumpy it must be good for WTP?  Or does it affect one of his scams? Confused again...
1339601265895100416 2020-12-18 00:00:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Seriously, sir? Just between you &amp; me, how is it possible that you were not fired by the good people of SC?  What's that? You helped mitch rig the election for yourselves, but rigged it against that race baiting xenophobic misogynistic biggot? You know, that kook you so admire!
1339594672822370306 2020-12-17 23:33:53 +0800 <JUthergi> So worried he'll get blamed for the s.o.p. of his vindictive nature he gets eric to vouch for the truth of his statement?  Can't breathe! Ribs hurt! Eyes teared up can't stop laughing! eric lol!
1339591123551932422 2020-12-17 23:19:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Well then...if The House dies not take action under this LAW, are all complicit, guilty &amp; subject to removal? Maybe trumpys legal elite should take this to SCOTUS? It's a lot easier to build back better if the old structure is completely demolished!  Why can't today be 25th  A D?
1339586709860745221 2020-12-17 23:02:14 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Dr Sachs for showing all why WTP should be offended, no, incensed with righteous indignation! incomprehensible that alleged reps of WTP do not place our needs 1st. Why not free healthcare? We pd. Why not free ed? We pd. Why not more vacation? We pd. Infrastructure? Homes? Food
1339584481145966594 2020-12-17 22:53:23 +0800 <JUthergi> The word "trump" is obscene...
1339583431227760645 2020-12-17 22:49:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this the same as the "trickle on" economy that many of us survived though blood sweat &amp; tears? They didn't even have the decency to try to fool us into thinking that that stuff trickling down was rain!
1339581292195831808 2020-12-17 22:40:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Yes! Of course! i'd even buy haz-mat suits for friends &amp; family to join us! i'd like all to go me a favor though...BYOB!
1339580031597649925 2020-12-17 22:35:42 +0800 <JUthergi> It's been said that the biggest election Fraud of 2020 is our luvable trumpy bear.
1339579295384145920 2020-12-17 22:32:46 +0800 <JUthergi> One of our more Presidential Presidents once said that "the price of freedom is constant vigilance". In today's world, moving forward we must accept that the price of freedom is both vigilance &amp; decisive ACTION! For without active participation of WTP in gov, we will lose bigly!
1339575025146490889 2020-12-17 22:15:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Well princess, no admin has done more to kill working American Citizens than the one you're presidenting!  The 310k dead + is likely more than those fed employees needing childcare...that pretty much negates your feeble attempts to make daddy look good.  Visiting SDNY soon?
1339570722394562561 2020-12-17 21:58:42 +0800 <JUthergi> What shall we call our Nuremberg type Trials when prosecuting trump &amp; his admin for the 2nd American Genocide?
1339567887489634304 2020-12-17 21:47:27 +0800 <JUthergi> An outright attack on our institutions is called AN ACT OF WAR! Yeah msm, it's a big deal! You may wish to enlighten yourselves to the fact that wars are not just fought with big boomy things. Psyops, propaganda, economic system attacks etc = 21st Century Weapons.
1339565813934804993 2020-12-17 21:39:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @benferrer1025 @NCMmnUSA @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr *bigliest!
1339563760911052804 2020-12-17 21:31:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @benferrer1025 @NCMmnUSA @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr As Dr M.L. King tried to warn us; there is no greater danger than willful ignorance &amp; conscious stupidity. mr EX pres @realDonaldTrump wins again for being the biggest proof of this statement!
1339562957139832833 2020-12-17 21:27:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Doesn't everybody want to attack mcConsAll?
1339561711343382529 2020-12-17 21:22:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Even if, the likely hood of this cretin's grand finale episode will most certainly get the highly coveted ratings, the prime directive in its admin. If heaven helps us, the ratings will be higher than the daily toll of dying American Citizens! Still clinging to hope...
1339559773314887682 2020-12-17 21:15:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Just wondering, a bit off topic but can anyone prove to me that pence is NOT a walking Venus Flytrap?  Inquiring minds want to know...
1339556631944769538 2020-12-17 21:02:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @DayleBrand @ReallyAmerican1 After Really American 1 Meidas Brothers &amp; Lincoln Project get done can we call him  purDONE?
1339344130867142657 2020-12-17 06:58:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @InstigatorRules @tribelaw @run4urmny As in life we take the good with the bad, compromise is the model of OUR REPUBLIC, well it used to be that way...
1339342240725000195 2020-12-17 06:50:48 +0800 <JUthergi> The Citizens of many other Democratic Nations get much higher monthly stipends...  It's the least they could do for us, the elected elite are just as much responsible for 300k deaths as that trump  chump.
1339340776111747076 2020-12-17 06:44:59 +0800 <JUthergi> So many other countries give their people monthly stimulus, why not for WTP? Sensing a new call for raises in congress &amp; senate...
1339340247423979520 2020-12-17 06:42:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @mmpadellan Excuse me Sir Dad, but that guy you're referring to? He's an EX pres, impeached EX pres 1 term biggest vote losing EX pres' in history of elections, twice! Lost EC votes by a landslide &amp; lost dozens of court cases trying to overturn the will of WTP!  Sorry, I got carried away!
1339339041607716868 2020-12-17 06:38:05 +0800 <JUthergi> That's ok! We all start forgetting at your age.  We start making up a lot of stories too, are you lonely since putin wont take your calls anymore?
1339338447933353984 2020-12-17 06:35:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @texaslawdog101 @IvankaTrump Can't help but to wonder if this has anything to do with slave labor at his resorts?  They've been working pretty hard to protect the "pipelines" wi USN /CG in se fla &amp; humans are a sustainable commodity!
1339337598129594370 2020-12-17 06:32:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Pending announcement from our EX pres:  vanky has created another 14m jobs bc I did an EO thingy!  Isn't she beautiful?
1339334501361737735 2020-12-17 06:20:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheRickyDavila Leader of the prostrate eight still free?
1339333702195814401 2020-12-17 06:16:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @badbitchinaz Tune in, turn on &amp; drop out! Congrats are in order for HIPPIES everywhere!  Haircuts illegal, marijuana legal &amp; rock n roll is here to stay?  Still, there's a man wi a gun over there tellin me I got to beware...stop!  Children, what's that sound? Everybody look, what's goin down!
1339331171294064655 2020-12-17 06:06:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Still thinking that every living human in the good ol US of A is a target while this lunatic is in the WH! Oh oh those black helicopters are back, gotta run!
1339329247513554946 2020-12-17 05:59:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Ahh, the old "diplomatic immunity ploy"...
1339327975330881545 2020-12-17 05:54:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Is he referring to the same trump @realDonaldTrump that he called a race baiting xenophobic biggot &amp; a kook?  That graham is more crackers than I thought!
1339326808349683717 2020-12-17 05:49:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @chuckleof @CNBC Worse yet, when you shop for the best deal, as any savy consumer is expected to do, lenders frown!  Apparently they see shopping savy as you're looking too hard to get credit.  Some things don't change, if you don't need money, you can get as much as you want.
1339322672971456515 2020-12-17 05:33:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @samajdarn @navywife53sco It's been reported that this "entertainer's" own boss was in court of law claiming that nobody believes this guy to be a journalist! The boss is right...
1339321705110626304 2020-12-17 05:29:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Keep calling it Mr D!
1339321554468036608 2020-12-17 05:28:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Still, no less dangerous! Hold on tight, this ride ain't over yet...
1339320161342513156 2020-12-17 05:23:04 +0800 <JUthergi> She musta gradiated from trump university. S.O.P.
1339318987377807360 2020-12-17 05:18:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Tryin to be macho...
1339318410853969926 2020-12-17 05:16:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @MysterySolvent Backwoods KY macho? Looks like the perm mom's wore in the '70s?
1339316845296414722 2020-12-17 05:09:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't that how our Constitution was designed? What do i know? I don't have the elected elite perspective that "corporations are people too"... How ever did we lose the specified term limits &amp; exclusion from laws &amp; liabilities that our elite enjoy???
1339313876521938948 2020-12-17 04:58:06 +0800 <JUthergi> No better time for change...  Considering the weakness &amp; corruption of OUR gov all exposed these past few years, CHANGE is the only constant we must adapt to.   The royal dynasty of incumbencies must be dealt with now!  Every living thing on earth must adapt to live, politics 2!
1339310880874516490 2020-12-17 04:46:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Leadership has the duty to train replacements. Share wisdom.  Works everywhere in every culture, excepting of course in the self serving culture of the elected elite politicians...  Let mcConsAll, that crackers graham guy, SHEMPer, &amp; peLOSTi be the poster kids for term limits?
1339306901687898112 2020-12-17 04:30:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @toodeemo @JohnLukeSam1 Always be kind to each person you meet on the way up the ladder of success. Lest they be merciless to you when you fall... A quote that stuck with me but from whom I do not know...
1339306190002642946 2020-12-17 04:27:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Here's that l'il princess we've all come to know &amp; love! Spreading peace &amp; joy &amp; good will to all mankind?  This person's commitment to public service outshines even that of Mother Theresa???
1339305179569664001 2020-12-17 04:23:32 +0800 <JUthergi> But, he claimed to be immune! Could his claim to virus infection have been just another failed tv producer's idea to get attn? Another failed ratings episode in the trumpian soap opera saga? Yep!
1339303004814630912 2020-12-17 04:14:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @RonGOPVet4Biden @SheilaHallRay The same conditions exploited in russia &amp; Germany in our recent past...no similarities there though so just look away...?
1339298409119965185 2020-12-17 03:56:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't see it? It's right there in front of us all, 3 ring binders with tons of affidavits for all to see! Bet you can't even see the Ex pres's new clothes...me 2  Apology wi due respect Mr Weissman, people don't seem to understand that all tossed court cases means, NO EVIDENCE!
1339296257576226819 2020-12-17 03:48:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Ok sir, your right again, always right! Right?  Thanks for taking time from all the difficult work you do for us. Just wondering though, as EX pres couldn't you just walk away from the presidenting stuff &amp; leave the mess for the next guy?  You already did? Ok...
1339294239461691397 2020-12-17 03:40:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @Maybejustmaybe8 @texaslawdog101 trump got another new hairdo? Oh, sorry my bad. I thought that was trump in a tantrum! My gran just told me it's a baboon, not a buffoon! Out of the mouths of babes... He gets extra candy before I send him home today!                 jk lol
1339257841153085444 2020-12-17 01:15:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @kathrynw5 definitely should hit trumplandia, it's near denial...
1339256790702305285 2020-12-17 01:11:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone old enough to remember the Boston Tea Party? WTP, absolutely fed up with tyrannical gov., threw a party &amp; tossed a symbol of that tyranny into the Ocean?  Could we do that again? In front of trump's mal lago resort? We could toss gop members, the symbol of tyranny today?
1339253475939659776 2020-12-17 00:58:05 +0800 <JUthergi> It's likely that im still pretty confused. Learning everyday but I can't help but to still wonder Is today 25th AMMENDMENT DAY? please?
1339253021293891590 2020-12-17 00:56:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Great news! How likely is it that stimulus checks for WTP are the lowest of all gifts from the nobility?
1339252659665113089 2020-12-17 00:54:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone else old enough to remember when WTP would pelt these soap box slime balls with rotten cabbages fruits etc? Then just boo them away? Good times...
1339252074098401286 2020-12-17 00:52:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Are they too late? Heard the rose garden renovator already started demo to build the new EX presidential residence? Inquiring minds want to know...
1339251164802592768 2020-12-17 00:48:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Days*=yrs (of marriage) reverse Freudian Slip?
1339250066578673670 2020-12-17 00:44:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @avra_cadaver Nope, just another guy but I got green blood, tree hugger type. lol
1339249325927489547 2020-12-17 00:41:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Great work! I'm not allowed to have Christmas Trees anymore. My boss of 40ys days that 38 new Christmas Trees on a 3/4 a lot is too much! She is a bit perturbed she can no longer spy on her neighbors... Ain't love grand?
1339248256648437760 2020-12-17 00:37:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Um sir? We KNOW the election was rigged. You told us a gazillion times starting in 16 and why would we not believe? But even with your assistance in the fraud, YOU STILL LOST!
1339247620330561536 2020-12-17 00:34:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Um, i think he meant to say mr EX president, (ex 1 term impeached pres that lost the pop votes by more than any Pres in history twice + landslide EC loss), but i do not wish to put words in anyone's mouth, i could be wrong here...
1339244901406547969 2020-12-17 00:24:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we ID those pushing to the front of the line, despite their willful ignorance in not following the ever changing cdc guidelines?
1339243526069039109 2020-12-17 00:18:33 +0800 <JUthergi> What is an oath of office? Do gop exempt themselves from duty to WTP &amp; US Constitution?
1339243138788036611 2020-12-17 00:17:00 +0800 <JUthergi> See? Take that all you doubting Thomases!!!
1339242009375236099 2020-12-17 00:12:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Wondering if the 14m jobs he claimed that vanky created magically disappeared?
1339241357903343625 2020-12-17 00:09:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Here we go again, who will be forced to rename their high school after trump? It may have occured to him bust on Rushmore out so maybe a name on grade school or high school or park?
1339240617520619522 2020-12-17 00:06:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he learn any new dance moves yet? He's like a washed up actor doing game shows in attempts to regain some modicum of relevance... Is it true he's already signed with World's Dumbest Videos?  Does Tonya Harding have a crush on him?
1339238981758840833 2020-12-17 00:00:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Simply incomprehensible to me that anyone anywhere could think that a trump would want to pursue career in Public Service after a lifetime spent in self only service? Would she be able to even pass a Civil Service Exam, or did the elected elite exempt themselves from that too?
1339235773703462915 2020-12-16 23:47:44 +0800 <JUthergi> You despicable slug, shamelessly you to blame others for the wrongs perpetrated on WTP? You personally have failed WTP &amp; OUR REPUBLIC moreso than other in our short history! Even with your scapegoat for disasters, trump in office! trump gets the blame &amp; you try for fame... slug!
1339231763588141056 2020-12-16 23:31:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Please pay attention
1339226137092886528 2020-12-16 23:09:27 +0800 <JUthergi> We named the virus after him! What more does he want? #TrumpVirus
1339225450443386880 2020-12-16 23:06:43 +0800 <JUthergi> You folks could be a day late etc.? Recent announcement stated melanoma remodelling the place.  If you think he is not remodelling for his permanent home, despite '93 agreement, you might need new lawyers!
1339221637439295488 2020-12-16 22:51:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @BeschlossDC Transitioning into his ideal life...as a Venus Fly trap?
1339221028048932864 2020-12-16 22:49:09 +0800 <JUthergi> #PsychoTrump but of course!
1339217630620758016 2020-12-16 22:35:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @JayDavidMurphy @seanhannity Watch how quickly this meathead falls, unless of course trump gives him the job at trump tv, fair &amp; unbalanced programming for those who ask, " why's everyone always picking on me?"
1339215756060463106 2020-12-16 22:28:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Guessing everyone is still waiting for the grand finale episode? Hold on tight!
1339215314752598019 2020-12-16 22:26:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @AmyAThatcher All 3? Then accelerate in bigly fashion into a brick wall. (All seat belts, except for driver's removed)
1339214462004375552 2020-12-16 22:23:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @DumondVince Pothole Pete to the rescue! Imagine driving over bridges again without fear of collapse or hitting a pothole knowing they can no longer swallow your car? Jobs jobs jobs!
1339213832334479370 2020-12-16 22:20:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds just like what the bad guys say to their suicide bombers just before the mission. Be good lil followers, blow yourselves up for our ideals &amp; you get a zillion virgins in heaven. We get re elected...
1339212205313683462 2020-12-16 22:14:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Pay attention! Step by step...
1339210272670670848 2020-12-16 22:06:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @RobAnderson2018 @sharnettereese1 @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @donnabraziIe Perhaps vanky feels she did such outstanding work presidenting with daddy that she is deservedly entitled to a cabinet post with President Biden?
1339209665318690816 2020-12-16 22:04:00 +0800 <JUthergi> SWs rule! Politicians drool?
1339209108856115201 2020-12-16 22:01:47 +0800 <JUthergi> This photo/clip of him subserviently leaving room was frightening.  Had we lost,? Was Kruschev right? Was the red wave not trumpettes voting but russia defeating USA wo firing a shot?  Almost beaten from within...but OUR REPUBLIC held &amp; star spangled banner does yet wave!
1339206278720217090 2020-12-16 21:50:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step
1339202889454116864 2020-12-16 21:37:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @benni1028 @davidmweissman @jacquimwood Benni? Any interest in running campaigns for newbie old enough to not care about baseless accusations but young enough to weather the battles? Great advice TY
1339009062269313025 2020-12-16 08:46:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @mmpadellan Isn't there some sage advice about "birds of a feather" to describe purdone - trumped relationship?
1339008349996781570 2020-12-16 08:44:02 +0800 <JUthergi> It can never make amends for the US gov genocidal treatment of Indigenous Nations &amp; First People...but it is a great start!  Perhaps a member of those giving us the template for the US Constitution, The Haudenosaunee Confederacy could be called upon once again to lead us to heal?
1339007100664602627 2020-12-16 08:39:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @VABVOX Now, if someone asks me to name 1 thing trump accomplished... there's that!  Thanks! lol
1339006664431837195 2020-12-16 08:37:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @LuLuRoche Right back at you Lady LuLu!!!

Tomorrow begins a new day! WTP unite
1339003537737592832 2020-12-16 08:24:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @BettyBowers Don't forget sec treas munchkin &amp; his buddies...he still refused to give WTP a list of those cronies needing 'special circumstance  forgiveable loans' !
1339002791730294785 2020-12-16 08:21:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Encouraging!
1339002542387302401 2020-12-16 08:20:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Where are all the lil trumpettes  that are usually blathering about the Bidens?  vanky jared jr eric did you guys leave already or have you all betrayed your daddy too?
1339001567341633536 2020-12-16 08:17:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Does trump like to wear kilts, too?  Thought Scotland wanted him buried at turnberry club?
1339000469507682306 2020-12-16 08:12:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @Ghost_of_Nappa1 Am so confused. My understanding was the law specifically states by force.  Legally, is by force acts of violence, coerced riots or by manipulation of information, or all of the above? Guessing only scotus knows.  Worth a try though? TY N!
1338998237798264833 2020-12-16 08:03:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Doesn't anybody wonder why barr made big show of military action in se atlantic?   Pipelines move more slaves than drugs.  russian power is part drug czars wi putin's help &amp; pipelines, no matter the product must be protected!  putin migolevich mcConsAll trump epstein mxwll etc?
1338996166919401474 2020-12-16 07:55:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Please consider the bravery of this young woman! She is an inspiration to all who love this country!!!
1338995822898409473 2020-12-16 07:54:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not? Laws without consequence are the seeds of anarchy...  Let the 127 reap what they have sown in the near dismantling of  OUR REPUBLIC!
1338994394377097217 2020-12-16 07:48:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Laws without consequence are the seeds of anarchy...  And they are already sprouting!
1338992793121861632 2020-12-16 07:42:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Heey hammhead! You do realize that without trump's derriere to lead you the ratings will go &amp; so will you!  Has that trump virus thingy miraculously disappeared yet, you said it would too! Who won the Presidential Election? Lol!!!
1338991046928326657 2020-12-16 07:35:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Today! Today is a good day to effect the 25th AMMENDMENT, right?
1338989792273502212 2020-12-16 07:30:18 +0800 <JUthergi> It ain't over yet! This malignant narcissist will do everything in his power to hurt maim or spill blood as he continues in his goal to destroy OUR REPUBLIC! We heard him with xi &amp; lil kim. He truly believes he is entitled to rule for life! Cling to hope &amp; hold on tight!
1338987655166644224 2020-12-16 07:21:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @littlejackie66 @duty2warn Stamps? Um no!  Wanted posters? Dart Board? Scary posters to warn your kids? Chose one, much better chance of sales volume....

1338984076087275520 2020-12-16 07:07:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh no! The prostrate eight have surrendered too? Is EX pres the most betrayed leader, by his own people, ever in world history?  Ha! Take that losers! trump wins another world record...
1338982079128809480 2020-12-16 06:59:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @avra_cadaver @DrGJackBrown But the comfort level of my willful ignorance &amp; conscious stupidity proves that  well, um, I don't need your, um...what ever!!! &amp; You ain't gittin' my red hat unless you pull it off my cold genieus head... But dead, I gotta be dead first...right?
1338980541123747841 2020-12-16 06:53:32 +0800 <JUthergi> All American Mutt!  Rescued 4.27.10 Grew into a certified Service Dog and most beloved member of our clan! Rescues are the best breed!  https://t.co/GFi5dUHLaW

1338960747695575041 2020-12-16 05:34:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forgot the new sharpie &amp; coloring book I offered, along with trophy, but we need him to do us a favor though...
1338959074629709826 2020-12-16 05:28:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Biggest rats are now jumping ship...
1338956691371679746 2020-12-16 05:18:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Good karma?
1338956447053459456 2020-12-16 05:17:48 +0800 <JUthergi> The winningest LOSER in the history of humankind!
1338955854889029633 2020-12-16 05:15:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Did mitch make a deal to surrender or get a pardon? Inquiring minds want to know!
1338955528924491778 2020-12-16 05:14:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Who? Don't know this person, a lot of people say they know me..
1338952096457117696 2020-12-16 05:00:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Carpetbagging queen!
1338951110263001088 2020-12-16 04:56:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Why haven't you people left OUR HOUSE, yet??? Your boss mitch said it's ok! trump is an impeached EX pres. !
1338949933773230084 2020-12-16 04:51:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Ding ding ding! We got a winner here! Best oxymoron of the month.... fox news! Congratulations to the PVC team!!!
1338948148685910019 2020-12-16 04:44:49 +0800 <JUthergi> mitchie remained subservient to the end &amp; waited for putin's approval to speak.  Waiting for putin's prostrate eight to speak soon, c'mon senate subservients!   Putin said it's ok!
1338946971327926278 2020-12-16 04:40:09 +0800 <JUthergi> donnie destructo takes on moscow mitch? Cage Match of the century! No way! donnie will trip over his tie &amp; mitch will try to hide in the shadows under the cage... If only we had Thunderdome &amp; Ms Tina to lead us?
1338912398682558464 2020-12-16 02:22:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps if we pepper msm/am with actual quotes of trump's condescending &amp; patronizing treatment of we, the voters, we could ease the red hats back to reality? Punish the leaders, prepare the way back for the mislead...
1338910652472156163 2020-12-16 02:15:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Yep, still clinging to hope!
1338910189920137220 2020-12-16 02:13:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @GrassrootsSpeak Pssst! Please don't give up on the election rigging &amp; fraud truths that put moscow's mitch &amp; the crackers graham guy back in office. America needs your investigative skills! TY!
1338909339432652805 2020-12-16 02:10:36 +0800 <JUthergi> We are &amp; have been under attack since 2016 &amp; now it dawns on you people???
1338908127459237889 2020-12-16 02:05:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe the gop should no longer be able to express any opinion until they provide a gop platform that provides for immediate censured dismissal &amp; prison time for those that go against the ideals established? Same for dems while we're at it... It is ALL ABOUT WTP anyway, right?!
1338899930614820869 2020-12-16 01:33:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @benni1028 @JohnLukeSam1 Same here! But not as a distinguished SW, as just another guy that wants to see them in trial &amp; in prison!
1338899325192167429 2020-12-16 01:30:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey hammhead? You still around?  Who won the Presidential Election? Is that trump virus hoax going away soon?  Are you???
1338898630401544195 2020-12-16 01:28:03 +0800 <JUthergi> No mask? No vaccine!
1338898240431853570 2020-12-16 01:26:30 +0800 <JUthergi> We're from the government; we're here to help!  Oh nooooooooooooooo!
1338897639547547650 2020-12-16 01:24:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @BruceTheMooose1 @SANJOSEMAILMAN Maybe he needs a laxative?
1338896166654656512 2020-12-16 01:18:16 +0800 <JUthergi> No matter what he asks for...
1338895811695009792 2020-12-16 01:16:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, there's things like honor &amp; integrity...then there's the gop.
1338894171831152643 2020-12-16 01:10:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Why can't this guy be actually slammed...into a prison cell???
1338893607785394177 2020-12-16 01:08:06 +0800 <JUthergi> That's our trumpy bear?  Bigliest magnet ever for the best &amp; brightest people!!!
1338892656320110593 2020-12-16 01:04:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't wait to see the world reject this aberration of humankind too!
1338892133453983744 2020-12-16 01:02:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this a person to or an android? Why are they still here?
1338891516710969344 2020-12-16 00:59:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Not if WTP reclaim the civilization of OUR REPUBLIC...
1338890371116437505 2020-12-16 00:55:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps it is time to redefine the term "a comedy of errors" to mean "trump administration" but that seems a contradiction in terms... Am so confused, actually starting to think tricky dick nixon was was an upstanding citizen of good character after these past 4 yrs.!
1338888614743175168 2020-12-16 00:48:15 +0800 <JUthergi> You may wish to sit this one out?   Thought you info opinion people knew things like that?
1338887940789985280 2020-12-16 00:45:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews These people you quote, who ARE they? You might be more believable if you quoted Kristy the clown if sideshow bob, never mind. After these past 4 yrs I can't imagine any human falling within the NORMS of logic ever believing you again ever. Red hat present company excluded.
1338885491551318018 2020-12-16 00:35:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Are you referring to the EX 1 term 2x biggest loser of pop votes ever impeached pres? If he moves to russia we should all go with him! That'll teach those commie loving radical bad people!
1338883422752825345 2020-12-16 00:27:37 +0800 <JUthergi> J Smith? OR @realDonaldTrump ???  Is that you mr 1 term impeached biggest landslide vote loser ever EX president?  We know how you like to promote yourself &amp; wacky conspiracies!   Nobody wants to hear from you or your pseudonyms, (oops sorry, that means FAKE names!)
1338880725135876097 2020-12-16 00:16:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Moscow mitch had to wait for permission from putin to make it official...
1338880344293072896 2020-12-16 00:15:23 +0800 <JUthergi> President Biden, get us out of this place!
1338879755509239810 2020-12-16 00:13:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe now he can do what he does best, selling useless products?
1338878472178061314 2020-12-16 00:07:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @patrickosully @aeday2008 @UrbanAchievr Apparently so. trump's lawyers do. Call them "campaign contributions" though. Most recently donations went to cy vance after which vanky's lawsuit wherein she fraudulently inflated nyc condo prices to buyers then lowered values for the banks. So yeah, money talks so truth walks.
1338871206783676417 2020-12-15 23:39:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @aeday2008 @UrbanAchievr I love NY!
1338860388301983745 2020-12-15 22:56:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1338860191647846401 2020-12-15 22:55:19 +0800 <JUthergi> The stable genius contagion keeps spreading too...
1338859487386484741 2020-12-15 22:52:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Please pass this on to remind everyone how close they brought us to the precipice of destruction.  Their greed &amp; corruption of the ideals that built OUR REPUBLIC must forever be common knowledge!  Perhaps a plaque at the Lincoln Memorial listing names of the convicts?
1338850989860859905 2020-12-15 22:18:45 +0800 <JUthergi> It's good to see you finally accepting reality, does trump know you said these words of betrayal to all that stands against?
1338850424783310848 2020-12-15 22:16:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Great detective work, sir! Now we got them commie bastards right where they want us! Trump till 2100!
1338636516218859520 2020-12-15 08:06:30 +0800 <JUthergi> You the guy from upstate ny?
1338635938445062147 2020-12-15 08:04:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Hold on tight, that boy ain't right!
1338635596764491777 2020-12-15 08:02:51 +0800 <JUthergi> President Biden to speak?  hope stations cover this moment in time when Americans AGAIN fought &amp; won another battle in the ongoing war against facism, tyranny &amp; dictatorial rule!  Immediately following, on comedy central, the EX 1 term impeached biggest vote loser pres talks big!
1338633629036138498 2020-12-15 07:55:02 +0800 <JUthergi> What's this? The cover quote for the WH Christmas cards? Such a nice thought... vanky or melanoma, can't even guess the author!
1338632946299904005 2020-12-15 07:52:19 +0800 <JUthergi> If only...
1338632166201298944 2020-12-15 07:49:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner @senmajldr @LindseyGrahamSC   Why y'all so quiet?
1338630418329964545 2020-12-15 07:42:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @KlasfeldReports @dazyjane410 Still waiting for the sound of a record breaking "pop" on the day the crackers graham pulls his head out of trump's plentiful behind... Hopefully occurs moments after trump pulls his newly coiffed head out of mitchie's skinny pink &amp; wrinkly darker side... Only then can we move on
1338629314821173256 2020-12-15 07:37:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Based upon more intense observations of the the apparent absolute incompetence of the elected elite...i'm prepared to wear this damn thing for the next 5 yrs.
1338628650678308864 2020-12-15 07:35:15 +0800 <JUthergi> AND nobody thinks another hairdo, now with grey dyes, makes you look more distinguished or mature with flair...   Powerfully foolish, yes? Not the hair, just you, sir.
1338627636193619969 2020-12-15 07:31:13 +0800 <JUthergi> 2nd biggest embarrassment?
1338627268353142786 2020-12-15 07:29:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Now we start investigations into media openly supporting sedition &amp; treason, right?
1338604302080860162 2020-12-15 05:58:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we play this every day until the hoax stops killing us? Future generations need to be able to spot the STABLE GENIUSES before 300k dead + 16m  infected American Families suffer from the magically disappearing hoaxes.  These people belong on Most Wanted posters. H8 crimes?
1338602330997067777 2020-12-15 05:50:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Courage? Congratulations!
1338602133252411394 2020-12-15 05:49:53 +0800 <JUthergi> russian ron, leader of the prostrate eight to visit putin on OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY to show our subservience. Thanks ron, you'll be remembered as part of the con!
1338600385817292806 2020-12-15 05:42:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @fancythis @JohnCleese Sounds like equality wi men, judged by the same standards, is achieved? Maybe now we can value humans based on the actions led by our hearts?
1338599796546924544 2020-12-15 05:40:36 +0800 <JUthergi> If someone REALLY could speak that many languages why would they have to pose nude for attention?
1338599260594507778 2020-12-15 05:38:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Am i still in nightmare? Seems I remember trump telling us there'd be so much winning we'll be begging him to stop. But now his opponent won the pop vote, (biggest loss EVER), EC votes, 55 - 60 legal remedies thrown out of court, 2 SCOTUS rebukes, recounts, audits, etc.  WTP won?
1338596174673154050 2020-12-15 05:26:12 +0800 <JUthergi> But, but the gop electors aren't allowed in! Neither were the NACC, (natl assoc of circus clowns)...
1338594934593642511 2020-12-15 05:21:16 +0800 <JUthergi> They have gotten away with serving big money for so long they have forgotten WTP! Time for us....
1338594542996639749 2020-12-15 05:19:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Repeating the question since no Rep of WTP seems to have the courage to respond &amp; act!
1338593658573119496 2020-12-15 05:16:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Does she see the dead people voting too?
1338570365862371336 2020-12-15 03:43:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe we should have politicians prove that they too have labored to qualify for the job of representing WTP?  (surgically enhanced callouses will not be accepted &amp; will not make you one of us)
1338568634290024450 2020-12-15 03:36:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @tedlieu @jhburgess98 @realDonaldTrump USPS? Not likely!
1338568237261484039 2020-12-15 03:35:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Those guys at SNL! Most creative comedy team ever! Thanks for the laughs in helping us through this nightmare!
1338567435377643530 2020-12-15 03:32:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper ???
1338567017322975237 2020-12-15 03:30:20 +0800 <JUthergi> The crackers graham guy wants to name a school after himself? He had a better chance of getting a status of himself with 2 faces, one stuck to a trump rump, one in tears...
1338564630147371014 2020-12-15 03:20:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @politvidchannel Couldn't we just pretend the past 4 yrs were a prophetic nightmare? We can still warn the future, scare them straight?
1338553499127328769 2020-12-15 02:36:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step, inching silently ever closer to total dominion...
1338552298159689729 2020-12-15 02:31:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this that goofy english guy spoofing a james bond film? Benny Hill, no I forgot his name... Funny skit with British accent for American voters?
1338550875237789696 2020-12-15 02:26:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @MysterySolvent Looking at this picture of a guy that forgot to stop when the door shut in his face, mashed potatoes? Is this the guy forced to resign from gov in disgrace?
1338550262148030481 2020-12-15 02:23:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Even past president declared so.
1338549832705781760 2020-12-15 02:22:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Once again, in this land of liberty &amp; rugged individualism WTP are called upon to steer our own destiny...away from the corruption &amp; tyranny the politicians have thrust upon us...
1338548216602701830 2020-12-15 02:15:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Yes, but they were men of character holding firmly to ideals that unite us all...
1338547710413168642 2020-12-15 02:13:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @BirdDinners No worries, tomorrow is groundhog day, again!
1338546495482720263 2020-12-15 02:08:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Still having trouble with logically attempting to control your hoax hammhead?
1338544210748854282 2020-12-15 01:59:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @Amy_Siskind @marylferris1 From shining city to shi*+y city &amp; it ain't pretty...
1338543801980358662 2020-12-15 01:58:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Can someone tell me if that humanoid in the blond wig was made in China? Just curious bc it doesn't seem to show emotion...or any human characteristics.
1338542638845321219 2020-12-15 01:53:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Yet trump can be buddies with our enemies giving COMFORT &amp; AID? Mc cons all can freely &amp; openly obstruct gov operations with the crackers graham? Alternate electors to assist in vote rigging?  Doesn't anyone see a problem here?
1338540976508461057 2020-12-15 01:46:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, there's a guy in fl that makes islands out of plastic bottles, maybe they could build trump one, just off the mal lago prop? He doesn't deserve the privileges of US Citizenship. He could name it trump island, just like his pal jeffy e., maybe help vanky with modelling?
1338539255669411840 2020-12-15 01:40:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @Strandjunker @jawja100 Poor old ivan boesky, the elected must have changed the laws after he was convicted to make insider trading legal?
1338538781721366529 2020-12-15 01:38:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, is any of this sinking in yet? You can't really believe that you are still winning, do you? mitch &amp; lindsie did this to you, this cannot stand! Hope you still have the courage to act powerfully to destroy their careers! Their betrayal of you must be avenged
1338536654064279558 2020-12-15 01:29:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper How, in any universe, is this not a blatant attempt to overthrow our gov?
1338535209344569345 2020-12-15 01:23:57 +0800 <JUthergi> A final compilation of this guy's tweets should be distributed to every school in the country to show the storm that OUR REPUBLIC has survived. Even though 300k+ US Citizens lives were sacrificed to soothe one despicably corrupted man's ego, WTP have united again!
1338533864399056899 2020-12-15 01:18:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Just do it, Now!
1338533475125780481 2020-12-15 01:17:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Today would be a good day to effect the  25th AMMENDMENT, right? still cling to hope as the world's last foolishly optimistic voter..
1338531322516606976 2020-12-15 01:08:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @redwingschic @SethAbramson Based upon observations of the exemplary courageous &amp; brave character of our elected elite, NOT ONE! 0! NADA! ZIP! ZILCH! But, we must still cling to hope...
1338530353896693761 2020-12-15 01:04:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Still clinging to hope...TY for insights!
1338529850009772034 2020-12-15 01:02:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @JimJones2020 @KlasfeldReports ASAP! He must be sitting his rather portly behind on the drain!
1338529439681028098 2020-12-15 01:01:01 +0800 <JUthergi> sir? As EX president we know you know A LOT about BREAKING LAWS, but your understanding of what laws mean seems a bit, well, different...  "LAW &amp; ORDER!" means uphold OUR LAWS, not yours, to maintain ORDER.  The voices in your head have confused you, again!!!
1338526471955116034 2020-12-15 00:49:14 +0800 <JUthergi> No need to stop this group, it could be a gift to our civilized society if they did leave.
1338525735288336385 2020-12-15 00:46:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this one of those proud l'il boys everyone is talking about? Is he armed too?
1338524513567293448 2020-12-15 00:41:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Precedent set!
1338524360655552512 2020-12-15 00:40:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is mc cons All not charged criminally with obstruction of gov operations? Oh right, he's the guy that refuses to allow witnesses to testify against alleged criminals!
1338523661146308632 2020-12-15 00:38:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Are you talking about the EX pres?
1338523273236103176 2020-12-15 00:36:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! 2 different groups diametrically opposed.  In our civilized Republic we have a remedy.  Courts of law. What? One side already lost in the courts over 50x &amp; was kicked out of the HIGHEST COURT IN OUR REPUBLIC, TWICE??? Maybe it's time to silence this blathering?
1338519731809218567 2020-12-15 00:22:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Could I use my trumpy bear?
1338517812957106176 2020-12-15 00:14:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @kaitlancollins Is that the guy that looks like german dr mengele?
1338516053190725638 2020-12-15 00:07:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Oath yes. Seated no.  Because, did ANYONE ever meet a politician that did not lie?
1338515413613895680 2020-12-15 00:05:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Tweet daily, trump's twisting reality wi his daily rants has destroyed our collective short term memories...
1338514739140435973 2020-12-15 00:02:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Politicians on every level should be last in line!  (Unless of course we have sufficient doubts as to efficacy of super duper rushed to market vaccines &amp; need guinea pigs...)
1338512532726804484 2020-12-14 23:53:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @atrupar Or it could be a great day for 330m Americans if it silenced the loudest trumpet on earth?
1338511728246714369 2020-12-14 23:50:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @BirdDinners Yep, it's Monday!
1338509814452908032 2020-12-14 23:43:02 +0800 <JUthergi> On this day in history 300k souls lost, trump virus, elite get vacc, gov hacked by enemies, again. EC meets to insure the LAWS of OUR REPUBLIC certify the people's choice for a new pres. EX pres' lost 50+x, l'il boys proud of their butts show them off, world on edge but, hunter?!
1338506674827628546 2020-12-14 23:30:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! What a coincidence! Hitler, after breaking all norms &amp; standards of law went after the disabled first, then the seniors... Can't have unproductive people draining resources for the master races, right?
1338504807963889665 2020-12-14 23:23:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Part of the plan, step by step...
1338504571203842049 2020-12-14 23:22:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Carpetbagger christian trying to fit in as a foreigner in GA?
1338495348302602241 2020-12-14 22:45:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Still clinging to hope...
1338340790393823233 2020-12-14 12:31:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Wouldn't it be great if they were all shown getting the vaccine on tv? I mean if they want WTP to believe it's not another trump hoax, right?
1338339615682551808 2020-12-14 12:26:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @newtgingrich How did this clown escape? Making voting more accessible to WTP means someone is doing their job &amp; that is a good thing, oh wait it's still 2020?  So how did this clown get out?  Wow trump's party is really scraping the swamp bottom for support...must mean mitch needed a favor.
1338337765013004294 2020-12-14 12:19:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Melanoma having fantasy dreams &amp; talking in her sleep about Justin? trump must have seen the pic with her look of lust in Helsinki. Justin ignored her. But the voices, the voices, eh mr EX pres?  If only John Candy were still alive to lead the invasion for dear leader!
1338335925139542016 2020-12-14 12:12:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Wounded &amp; cornered &amp; at most dangerous...
1338334343014608897 2020-12-14 12:05:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Why? Did God tell you about the trump virus so you could cash in your stocks? He told me that the desire for money is the root of all evil...  Why are  trump's servants always pretending to be holier than WTP?  It's as if they truly enjoy the condescending way they treat US?
1338276603768565760 2020-12-14 08:16:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Finally! Now I finally understand the connection to the YMCA song, butt check brotherhood, with trumpian flair!
1338275920772276229 2020-12-14 08:13:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @Cynic96092787 @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Maybe we do, maybe we don't...lol
1338274984515526656 2020-12-14 08:09:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Anything to make him think he has some relevance, to somebody, somewhere???
1338274464878956552 2020-12-14 08:07:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @TeresaM51981532 Don't forget that trump flair he so often brags about...lol
1338238646726569996 2020-12-14 05:45:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @ponsford_mike Nah,  Read the papal bull of Pope nicholas V. Doctrine of Discovery. Actually authorizes rape pillage killing of children destruction of food sources &amp; other atrocities if any found humans do not submit... Still the basis today for US gov to break treaties &amp; take land...
1338236162486521857 2020-12-14 05:35:39 +0800 <JUthergi> So, the ex president lied? @realDonaldTrump
1338235742036897793 2020-12-14 05:33:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it today? Oh please please please let today be 25th AMMENDMENT DAY!!!
1338233723582603274 2020-12-14 05:25:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @Thuringwethill @kimmiecue1 @RawStory Severe injury. We can heal when WTP see that our fellow citizens are not our enemies. It is the elected elite that has made us enemies of their greed &amp; corruption... People over politicians!
1338233062124085253 2020-12-14 05:23:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Orwellian Doublespeak us now the official language of The Party. Step by step...
1338229693200396289 2020-12-14 05:09:56 +0800 <JUthergi> We most certainly have a case of a disgruntled employee... SECURITY!!!
1338229116835946497 2020-12-14 05:07:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Who wants to look at books when there's boobies? Heaven help us!
1338228721640218625 2020-12-14 05:06:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you sir for your leadership?
1338227554872946696 2020-12-14 05:01:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Trying my best to cling to logic &amp; hope... How does the possible financial malfeasance by a pvt Citizen yet to be convicted, bc " Innocent until PROVEN guilty", equate to high crimes &amp; misdemeanors committed before our eyes by one of the most powerfull dangerous men on earth???
1338225374585626631 2020-12-14 04:52:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @Deegan102 Demand that our "representatives" reinstate The Fairness Doctrine.   Not that they would actually listen... But it could sound the death knell for all the opinionated propaganda entertainment crap they spew at WTP...
1338222342317748225 2020-12-14 04:40:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Too much winning at being the biggest loser, ever? Isn't there something in the law that requires those filing frivolous lawsuits to pay all legal &amp; court costs as a deterrent to incessant Idiocracy?
1338220862831529984 2020-12-14 04:34:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @tracyk726 @funder @Jefiner68 @realDonaldTrump Premeditated, he knew what it could do &amp; how easily this aerosol virus could infect, but he "chose to downplay it"!
1338220264837046274 2020-12-14 04:32:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @jakkiisaid @funder @realDonaldTrump Premeditated
1338219958988320769 2020-12-14 04:31:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @larkwood6 @B52Malmet Is there any vaccine that could defeat the contagious disease of  cowardice now infecting our elected elite?  Well, it is the season of hope, so i had to ask...
1338219022341582849 2020-12-14 04:27:32 +0800 <JUthergi> I feel like a frog in water with the heat being turned up, STEP BY STEP! Our Democratic Republic must feel the same!  If the elected elite can't find the courage to uphold LAW &amp; ORDER, we're all cooked!
1338217304174235648 2020-12-14 04:20:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Who even invited him?
1338217028855992324 2020-12-14 04:19:37 +0800 <JUthergi> This can't compare to the generosity from your pockets when you bought sandwiches for fire fighters this yr.!  Your personal action is so presidential! You could be presidenting yourself one day?  Too bad the optics are always like when Marie Antoinette said "let them eat cake"!
1338183739139100673 2020-12-14 02:07:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @JimCassidy48 Well, with all the space cadets in trump's admin it does seem a logical place to dispose of them...
1338183290637922310 2020-12-14 02:05:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step
1338182979764490244 2020-12-14 02:04:19 +0800 <JUthergi> President Biden's term should begin 1/6/20 upon congressional certs. Inauguration day is just a ceremony.  Dump the trump chump early!
1338182235644698627 2020-12-14 02:01:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheDemCoalition @DaleGeldart @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump He wanted us to bow &amp; call him dear leader, now we call him dear LOSER
1338181474785390595 2020-12-14 01:58:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @SawyerHackett i think this is proof that safe spaces wi coloring books &amp; participation trophy's doesn't make boys into men?  Perhaps too many parents forgot about the benefits of a good switch &amp; trip to the woodshed form of discipline?  Just one trip can change a disrespectful person's p.o.v.
1338177262370295808 2020-12-14 01:41:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Hard not to imagine that those willing to overlook the assaults on OUR REPUBLIC &amp; on our way of life, are actually guilty of those same egregious acts, just not exposed yet? Order under Law should be a new rallying cry? Law &amp; order; different topics &amp; never the two shall meet?
1338175519364440065 2020-12-14 01:34:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @NineofSeven2 We fall down in order to learn to stand on our own...
1338174968421560325 2020-12-14 01:32:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Just so relieved that now when i search for news on POTUS/FLOTUS, i won't be optically assaulted by a surgically enhanced amazon type construct of a human female. Some things just can't be unseen! No nude FLOTUS, ever again?!?
1338173282101698561 2020-12-14 01:25:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Great, now we have a contagious "stable genius" virus too?
1338166602169245696 2020-12-14 00:59:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Might take that bet, but am kind of leaning toward a thunderdome challenge with Tina Turner as moderator? Any takers? Be a great way to get politicians to earn their keep?
1338163221618978817 2020-12-14 00:45:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! Not sure, but it appears that even the judges you put on the bench for mitch are trying to tell you something? You may have just won the world record for the most failed attempts to corrupt &amp; destroy OUR REPUBLIC! Maybe, for the sake of mankind, stop?
1337916159778320386 2020-12-13 08:24:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @WalshFreedom Past 4 years kept hearing "no man is above the law",  then teading  almost daily tweets about LAW &amp; ORDER! Now the LAW &amp; ORDER! tweeter is inciting violence, fomenting sedition &amp; treason &amp; trying to eat the laws!  Some very highly paid people are clearly not doing their job!!!

1337777791824261121 2020-12-12 23:14:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Worth a listen!  Why can't the accomplishments of this newbie, to the swamp of politics, be set as a minimum standard of performance? It should be demanded of every Rep, if they want to be considered true representatives of WTP!  Setting new standards, thank you Rep AOC!
1337774972392103938 2020-12-12 23:03:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Sue dem/gop parties too? The abysmal choices of political operatives forced upon us as our only "choices" for voting are the reason we are here, right now!  Make the them pay for the irreparable harm  emotional pain &amp; suffering to WTP!  Restricting our pursuit of happiness!

1337750710075740165 2020-12-12 21:26:38 +0800 <JUthergi> If WTP have been so divided by gop programs to conquer, we deserve to o lose Our Republic.

1337460662373670912 2020-12-12 02:14:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Could this be a practiced distraction tactic! Does trump's lawyer want to make another generous "campaign contribution" to the DA? i'm always sooo confused, but 1:00 on a Friday &amp; what?  HAPPY TIME! Light em up! Shoot em down! Jump for joy &amp; pass sum love around!
1337458423538061313 2020-12-12 02:05:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr Funny how that works?  The sens/congress don't loose a penny nor do campaign consultants assistants advisors to the pres etc. etc. etc, right? Those responsible for this fine mess take no responsibility for putting WTP in this fine mess, but they gettin our $! Ok
1337450385812955137 2020-12-12 01:33:15 +0800 <JUthergi> But we do...
1337409777350086656 2020-12-11 22:51:53 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP second the motion!
1337409073512329228 2020-12-11 22:49:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Well now that our Military has gone from the worst in the world, without any bullets, the chosen one thrust upon us immediately made our Military the bigliest &amp; bestest! So, yeah its time for effective financial management!

1337403268339658752 2020-12-11 22:26:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Full freeze on all their salaries until trump &amp; his virus are completely eradicated and all bills being held in mc cons all office are voted upon!  Divide the $ &amp; give it to families losing homes &amp; unable to keep food on the table?
1337401751805325313 2020-12-11 22:20:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Still no "journalists" to look into mitchie's illustrious military service? Or why he was released for eye irritation, thanks to his daddy &amp; senator? You'll get rave reviews &amp; ratings for min of 3 cycles!!!
1337396587602059266 2020-12-11 21:59:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like a very conservative estimate?
1337396183799623680 2020-12-11 21:57:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Logic &amp; trump's line of thinking...never the two shall meet!

1337395489990381568 2020-12-11 21:55:07 +0800 <JUthergi> So ironic that what the EX one term impeached pres, with the greatest losses in history seems unable to grasp is that HE could achieve what he calls upon SCOTUS to do by just being honorable enough to admit GREATEST DEFEAT in Electoral history &amp; go away...  Honorable? Lol

1337180734054862851 2020-12-11 07:41:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe in the spirit of giving, not wanting Santa to take unnecessary risks, we could shive not his baby down the wh chimney! eric will probably light the fire by mistake &amp; oh happy happy joy joy all the live long day?
1337177751523094530 2020-12-11 07:29:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Smells like someone popped their head out their derriere when they heard pardons were for sale?
1337177345778708481 2020-12-11 07:28:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Nuhuh! Only works for trumpasauras rex &amp; it's evil spawn! Good 1 lol
1337176762908889088 2020-12-11 07:25:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepSwalwell @DayleBrand With only 590 german deaths /d the GDR wants a total shutdown through new year! Their leader is a scientist &amp; is nearly apoplectic. Our "leader" is a game show host, doesn't care &amp; we die at 90 souls/ hr! So...everyone in our gov ok with that? Do something!
1337174419345727488 2020-12-11 07:16:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @BuckThis2 @Initforfreedom @beerkoozie @johnkruzel Well, after watching the crowd @ trump's rally sat for two gop in GA election, i think there's a new salute!? One of the big screens played extreme violence, (fox blocked/ not oan), &amp; the crowd kept chanting with a sort of chopping motion &amp; trump mimicked... Wannabe dictator?
1337112048724013057 2020-12-11 03:08:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepJohnKatko  Congratulations! Heard you were reelected!  BTW, who won the presidential election?

That was you? Now you're going for an encore but nobody 7m voters don't wants you back? See anything wrong with this picture?
1337103199329726466 2020-12-11 02:33:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is obstruction of gov or gov processes a crime for any single one of WTP, but not for any single member of house or sen? Are we all just servants of the elected elite?
1337102417054281728 2020-12-11 02:30:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Please Rep Porter! Save us from mc cons all!   How much did AT&amp;T contribute to his campaign? Starting to feel that it is criminal attacks against humanity every time he speaks!

1337087999541178372 2020-12-11 01:33:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't these corps he is trying to protect from liability for blatant negligence have scored of attys &amp; lobbyists to protect them? WTP don't!
1337085574000349188 2020-12-11 01:23:37 +0800 <JUthergi> So sorry but this has to be the worst dancer ever! Poster boy for "white men can't dance"! He hasn't learned any new moves since his ad for trump's house of wings! As a horrible dancer myself I speak from the experience of having made many many people laugh at my "hot moves"!
1337081836334424064 2020-12-11 01:08:46 +0800 <JUthergi> How is it that on the same day we rejoice in kushner's investigation into interntl financial self enrichment, we hear no more &amp; hunter is back? Dear info spreaders WTP truly believe that most politicians &amp; anyone within their circles are generally corrupt...as you have been.
1337079155586985986 2020-12-11 00:58:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Funniest most ironic moment of the day? Sitting down for a break, turn on my boob tube hoping to find that today is 25th Ammendment Day, &amp; there's an infotainment host with a FACTS FIRST sweatshirt on? lol seriously? That's like a politician saying I'm working for you!
1337077755037544451 2020-12-11 00:52:33 +0800 <JUthergi> The so far bloodless coup continues. Legally of course... step by step
1337077072326520835 2020-12-11 00:49:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps he missed the part about US gov being of the People, by the People &amp; for the People? WHAT? corporations are people too? That's the most ridiculous illogical thing I've ever heard!!!  WHAT? citizens united, oh right...when gop decided greed was more important than WTP...

1337073223893196809 2020-12-11 00:34:32 +0800 <JUthergi> How about this for lawsuit? WTP v US Gov officials Failure to defend Constitution, failure to protect people, financial malfeasance for self enrichment, legal bribery,(pac lobbyists), protect infrastructures, education, healthcare... So many grievances they refuse to address!
1337071374419062785 2020-12-11 00:27:11 +0800 <JUthergi> While recognizing sarcasm it struck me as  oddly coincidental that us gov has a history of placing perfectly self sufficient &amp; autonomous freedom loving people on reservations. The first people on this land were supposed to have been wiped out. Are WTP next? Will gov repeat ?
1337068703863730176 2020-12-11 00:16:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @lessag67 @tribelaw Absolute power has absolutely corrupted OUR REPUBLIC!

The swamp is full of corrupted elected elite &amp; their theft of our tax $, can't blame it all on trump.  https://t.co/6FD0LMwsyN
1336819733413376000 2020-12-10 07:47:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @aftalal @Mokeyscott @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump How could anyone doubt such a dignified person presidenting???
1336817956651737091 2020-12-10 07:40:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @AshColl53161021 @dmzway @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump Maybe she is worried what a malignant narcissistic EX 1 term impeached 2x highest vote losing pres that wants to be ruler for life might do?  I know i am!  Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men, especially failed game show hosts looking for revenge as a last episode???
1336815353683447811 2020-12-10 07:29:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Even a past pres called trump win illegit! GOD bless him! But giving credit where due, trump is the winningest pres ever in  losing People's Vote in record numbers, TWICE!
1336814180515647490 2020-12-10 07:25:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump sir? gotta prove all accusations,1-51? Not winning. SCOTUS says no too.  you think what you say is law, ok. "power of the pres" absolute &amp; nobody disobeys your orders, but historically that's reserved for a man in his own house.  Remember, LAW &amp; ORDER!   OUR House, OUR RULES!
1336796261140271105 2020-12-10 06:13:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Are we talking bone spur to avoid combat "courage" or hide in the bunker yelling out divisive propaganda via the Hitler Equivalent of AM Radios type "courage"?  Powerful messaging sir, right?
1336792617703657472 2020-12-10 05:59:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @donwinslow Be best swag? Guess i'm too socially distanced to understand...
1336791782177304581 2020-12-10 05:56:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @DavidFu76244435 @ProudSocialist Did you miss my extremes comment? Only propaganda predicts...observations of patterns of behavior however is also a good indicator of future behavior... Thanks though...always appreciate insight.
1336790248458694656 2020-12-10 05:50:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @Tolhaller @ReportsDaNews Oh, yeah we can lift that blockade thingy, after the check clears. Ok with you oh princely prince of saudi arabia?
1336788806163460127 2020-12-10 05:44:22 +0800 <JUthergi> So, is this an example of congress waiting for Christmas to get any work done?
1336788236996407299 2020-12-10 05:42:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Home is where the heart is...assuming of course you're not a russian asset handler from slovenia and that you HAVE A HEART!
1336785302548066304 2020-12-10 05:30:27 +0800 <JUthergi> This too?
1336784079094763525 2020-12-10 05:25:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Heaven help us! It's just all too mitch!!
1336783653641334784 2020-12-10 05:23:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Mitch approves!
1336783267316568065 2020-12-10 05:22:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Rep Porter!
1336782889640468481 2020-12-10 05:20:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper too far
1336782695918153734 2020-12-10 05:20:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Calling our EX pres by that name has gone to far. trump did not steal the election yet, he just failed to rig the election in his favor.
1336781847620149248 2020-12-10 05:16:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @ProudSocialist What do Citizens of the USA, despising labels, think of the damages brought by our darling trumpasauras rex?  Really appreciative of what you're doing but no change will come until we get the extremes put aside...WTP have more in common than the politics of divisive labelling.
1336778469087334401 2020-12-10 05:03:17 +0800 <JUthergi> On sat trump tells us he's worked harder in the past weeks than any time in his life...now this?
1336776983284490241 2020-12-10 04:57:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe Mr Krebs could be fed AG?
1336776090199724037 2020-12-10 04:53:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump sir? Those nice men in white are trying to help you. Did you see the custom jacket with the nice xl sleeves &amp; decorative straps in the back? It's just for you!  You'll look so stylish if you let them adjust it for you. You can wear it  to your inauguration, such flair! All good
1336773979546259458 2020-12-10 04:45:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @HillReporter @realTuckFrumper Hey pe rino! Don't forget to show some gratitude for the virus he loosed upon us all!  Seriously lady, did your boss force you to say this or be fired?
1336772759687467012 2020-12-10 04:40:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @JournalistJG @IsaacDovere Can we modify "by force" to something like "coercion, intimidation or manipulations" to etc.? Thinking that "by force" requires acts of violence, that being the reason for no indictments made? mitch &amp; his minions manipulating this loophole could still destroy OUR REPUBLIC? Attys?
1336769275575537668 2020-12-10 04:26:45 +0800 <JUthergi> New rule? From this day forward that mc cons All guy, with over 400 bills of the people's biz, (unlikely corp bills delayed), sitting in limbo, shall be forever known as Scrooge mcConsAll! So let it be written, so let it be done!
1336767687465324544 2020-12-10 04:20:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews @wishiwas20 If we took the cumulative amount of $ + benes paid to the 545 that are supposed to protect the welfare of WTP &amp; divided it among WTP could we survive, without losing food &amp; shelter, until the trump virus is defeated?  Hmmmm....
1336759554240098304 2020-12-10 03:48:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @Daily_Feed123 Is this an adv for the resurrected trump House of Wings?
1336758287266705414 2020-12-10 03:43:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Did anyone think they'd be praying incessantly for a miracle to save us from a hoax?
1336756064977625088 2020-12-10 03:34:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @Rebekah52854784 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Dambit gumby! Now we got to declare every election FRAUDULENT whenever a Service Member sent in their ballot from overseas while trying to defend the Constitution &amp; OUR REPUBLIC!  Good thing trump won, he's entitled to rule bc, well, just because! Right?
1336751587264503811 2020-12-10 03:16:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @daHoovster @AntarianRani @yashar Heart disease top killer but poor dental hygiene contributing to heart disease is optional?  Seems like ADA needs to learn to lobby like MDA?
1336750783585546243 2020-12-10 03:13:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @FoxNews  Breaking news! Kid told no gun for you! Woke santa tried to wreck Christmas!  Fictional character, invented by soft drink company, triggering adult fox viewers? mall Santa read US Constitution! Trying to take guns!  Christmas Story Santa: "you'll poke your eye out kid!"
1336744790092898304 2020-12-10 02:49:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @E71601376 @BMeiselas Thanks, I feel bad now that you let me know he was delusional as a kid.  Who lives life thinking they are president?  PS i was too poor to have candy so I took out the bullies stealing it ...
1336739937476030466 2020-12-10 02:30:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @BMeiselas He was that kid that always had bags of candy to buy friendship &amp; so bullies wouldn't pick on him...no wonder he is the way he is?
1336739003849187337 2020-12-10 02:26:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Knowledge is power, that is why our gov tries so hard to keep us uninformed... Ignorance however nurtures the incumbencies of our elected elite!
1336738123150225408 2020-12-10 02:22:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe if we use this vid with the #OVERTURNtrump tag it just might dawn on him that he's barking up the wrong tree?
1336736230084632576 2020-12-10 02:15:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @smcafee10 @georgehahn @sharnettereese1 Thank you, it's all just so confusing.
1336735983237292048 2020-12-10 02:14:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Proud Citizens of GA will forever be remembered for their bravery &amp; conviction that OUR REPUBLIC is the best &amp; *2nd oldest successful form of Democracy in history of mankind!  TY GA! You are the future! Ossof / Warnoff!  *Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Template for US Constitution.
1336730636355244036 2020-12-10 01:53:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Swing &amp; a miss &amp; a miss &amp; a miss etc.  sir, even scotus picks betrayed you...just give it up!  51 losses in the courts should be a lil bit of an indicator that you need to rethink your strategies. Should have used the mitch lindsie plan to steal an election!
1336727486827261960 2020-12-10 01:40:42 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Alison Greene! Everyone believing in the rule of law &amp; that no one is above the law SHOULD READ THIS! Great work! Exposing the machinations of mitch is truly frightening but it is ABSOLUTELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE that no "news" agency has run with this thread to indict mc cons All!
1336725234351812610 2020-12-10 01:31:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you for that insight into the trumpian mindset.   Some things we just cannot unlearn or unsee &amp; it's painfull...
1336723843772260355 2020-12-10 01:26:14 +0800 <JUthergi> He promised the elections were rigged bc he seems to have done the rigging? Typically trump flair however resulted in another giant bigliest trump up! (trump up! used in place of more vulgar language)
1336720747641917440 2020-12-10 01:13:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Dominion IS the distraction from vanky's Chinese Patented Voting Machines!!!  In history of OUR REPUBLIC has ANY individual EVER invested in voting machines?  Anybody EVER invest when daddy runs for 2nd term as POTUS? Ever?  Cannot comprehend any possible ROI 4 machine, unless...
1336717787390242816 2020-12-10 01:02:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he get vanky's voting machines into these districts? Vanky's machines wi dominion software, (appropriate name for domineering election fraud) are just too coincidental...dig deeper! Seems like voters got trumped! (new swear word)
1336715789848678401 2020-12-10 00:54:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Yep!
1336715046852960256 2020-12-10 00:51:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr. Nobody loves china over USA. It's just that sooo many can't stand trump clan &amp; what you all represent.  Can you get out of quarantine or did vanky get daddy to ground you?   You know she will do ANYTHING to keep you from ruining her chance to be pres, right?  SDNY 4u2!
1336713482826375169 2020-12-10 00:45:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump It's as if vanky's voting machines failed to flip votes for you as planned. You really screwed up a very simple process of rigging an election. Such a disappointment...even scotus betrayed you!
1336712750555426818 2020-12-10 00:42:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast @sharnettereese1 Can't listen to this guy for more than a minute...can just take Ms Molly at her word though.
1336706633192378369 2020-12-10 00:17:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Either that or give Human Citizens the opptys to deduct operational expenses for our lives like corporate "citizens" do.  Rent/Mtg exp Fuel exp Computer/Internet exp (gotta communicate with our gov. banks etc.) Comm exp Office exp Dining/entertain exp +++ What they get! We get!
1336702855013670919 2020-12-10 00:02:50 +0800 <JUthergi> So much winning! New record that will stand forever! Most losses ever in US judiciary!!!
1336699352895655948 2020-12-09 23:48:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @SharonWalkLoud @mmpadellan Seconding motion! Been trying to get all to get the name classified as a swear word requiring $ to the swear jar. trump y'all! well, trump you too! Oh trump! Just stepped in more dog trump! You are such a bull trump artist!  It could work...
1336695139528544256 2020-12-09 23:32:10 +0800 <JUthergi> New rule!
1336694660136308736 2020-12-09 23:30:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Great find!  Wondering if there is anyone in our senate NOT deserving of this title?
1336694049277882374 2020-12-09 23:27:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @jers_gal @88SEATTLE61 @mmpadellan But he is still a winner bc he lost by the most popular votes ever in our history, twice! Nobody could beat that!
1336693351010230272 2020-12-09 23:25:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @88SEATTLE61 @mmpadellan Maybe she is paying attention? Any action taken yet to remove him from office before his grand finale episode that could burn down your house too???
1336692767020421122 2020-12-09 23:22:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @AnnieHoff56 @syberghost @mmpadellan Many have, bc he let it in &amp; did nothing to stop the spread...every time he calls it something other than the scientific name,  please respond with "trump virus". Hopefully this will catch on?
1336691369553891329 2020-12-09 23:17:11 +0800 <JUthergi> But, my new biz plan to sell trumpy dumpy sustainable compost human waste chairs in fake gold color...  trump toilets already has a copywrite bc vanky &amp; jr are retraining.  But, you're right!
1336688995535826945 2020-12-09 23:07:45 +0800 <JUthergi> So missing house of wings, biggest biz success he ever had. Did anyone notice his dance moves haven't changed since this commercial?
1336687749512966146 2020-12-09 23:02:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @senmajldr @SpeakerPelosi  Hi kids!  Occured to me that it's likely you have never heard words as insightful as those of Mr Cohen.  Please listen. Now that you've heard what truth sounds like there is no reason for the continuous lies of your idiotacracy!
1336424158083727360 2020-12-09 05:35:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @MyFateMyDestiny @jmxkramer @joelockhart @realDonaldTrump We should all be afraid of the grand finale episode he has planned!!!
1336423703656230915 2020-12-09 05:33:35 +0800 <JUthergi> But, he said he's never worked harder than he had in the last 3 weeks?  Isn't that enough? What do we expect from our own stable genius, a 40 hr workweek? That's for suckers that don't work as hard as our EX president, right?
1336421422370058244 2020-12-09 05:24:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  At least k conway didn't betray our ex pres'! She knows real flair!  She should get to be one of the new founding fathers!
1336419326837059589 2020-12-09 05:16:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Are these actually vanky's machines?  What pvt citizen or biz has ever in the history of this country invested in (Chinese Patented/ Manufactured) Voting Machines?  Is there some pro forma showing exponential ROI!  Help me, i'm so confused....
1336417175020646407 2020-12-09 05:07:38 +0800 <JUthergi> But there's mitch...
1336416722694402050 2020-12-09 05:05:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Is there such a thing as a collective learning disability?  WTP must have it, it's contagious &amp; getting worse!!!
1336415606120312843 2020-12-09 05:01:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @poet_economist @BillKristol @JVLast The way barr had been working the shadows for decades, we can be reasonably assured it is all perfectly legal.  Another fine example of legal is not always right or just...
1336414663911858181 2020-12-09 04:57:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @jmxkramer @BillKristol @JVLast Sorry Mr Franklin! It appears that the work you guys did to give us OUR REPUBLIC is in jeopardy...  We allowed the unthinkable. We were too lazy to participate in our governance &amp; they took our silence to mean consent!  WTP should make it clear, now or never, we DO NOT CONSENT!
1336412811606585345 2020-12-09 04:50:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Just so confused...how could the elite continue to party while we lose our jobs, our homes &amp; starve or catch trump virus &amp; die?  Worse yet this young legal person thinks trump is a god!   I need a safe space with a coloring book &amp; dambit gumby, I need a participation trophy too!
1336408448146223104 2020-12-09 04:32:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @jaykayokay2020 @marceelias Maybe we should stop paying for red states and sue them for not contributing fairly to the general welfare of WTP?
1336408028472602626 2020-12-09 04:31:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @tj_melon @marceelias Watching our elected elite for over 4 decades now, i say with due conviction, that WASTING TAX PAYER'S $ has never been a relevant consideration!  Eisenhower &amp; Kennedy warned us.   "As long as it doesn't affect me" being the prevailing attitude of WTP, allows a bloodless coup...
1336405738147688451 2020-12-09 04:22:11 +0800 <JUthergi> They're back!
1336405585005305857 2020-12-09 04:21:35 +0800 <JUthergi> They couldn't divide &amp; conquer WTP so now they want to divide &amp; conquer each state bc someone thinks 3 scotus judges owe "the donnie"!!!  Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet???  What the hell are you cabinet members waiting for?  You going down wi the guy that will turn on you 1st???
1336404341989715969 2020-12-09 04:16:38 +0800 <JUthergi> strategically executed!  Look over there, the dems want to force socialism &amp; communism upon you all!!! Rigged election!  Don't look at us, we just want an autocracy, led by dictator mc cons All or trump, (if we must), to force you all to do our will!  Be subservient!
1336333768127258626 2020-12-08 23:36:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @vegalitarian269 @LuLuRoche Now now. This is very offensive to the trump family. Vanky wants her face, dad's, jared &amp; jrs faces there! Eric? They'll be blaming all crimes on him do he really doesn't fit the pic...
1336328755749351430 2020-12-08 23:16:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Endeavor to perservere!
1336325878926565389 2020-12-08 23:04:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Also, refer to him only as mr. EX president! You might even get to see his pumpkin head explode, right before your very eyes!
1336324094241898510 2020-12-08 22:57:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @realjpgil @DesireeK80 @jennyrachelpal @IvankaTrump It stealing from children with cancer through bogus charity. Did she ever take court ordered classes in how NOT to steal from charities?
1336323395764436996 2020-12-08 22:54:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe she is retraining for the 14m jobs daddy says she created?  More likely she wants her own model agency like casablanca's elite where she was "trained" &amp; learned about trafficking first hand.   Uncles jeffy &amp; john &amp; auntie g will be so proud!
1336322155508805634 2020-12-08 22:50:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @Mominsweats @IvankaTrump She has worked so hard to craft an image of her self importance to be considered as pres successor. Remember how the world leaders responded to her when she tried to join conversations? We saw it &amp; understood, but not lil vanky, she really thinks she is entitled to be pres.
1336320100937453570 2020-12-08 22:41:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @smc429 @IvankaTrump Maybe she is doing this to advertise for all her plastic surgeons? Heard they were broke...
1336319626842554369 2020-12-08 22:40:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump You are a very creepy scary looking person...
1336319345526525952 2020-12-08 22:38:54 +0800 <JUthergi> mc cons All &amp; the crackers graham seem to be the ring leaders having practiced the art of sedition for decades now. Much the same way russia seeks &amp; grooms their "useful idiots" they have found theirs in their lil trumpy bear...the ugly is growing exponentially!
1336316193431556098 2020-12-08 22:26:22 +0800 <JUthergi> TY! Been asking why no one would report on vanky's Chinese Patented/Manufactured Voting Machines?  daddy cried elections were rigged with such conviction bc they placed her machines. Her investment best paid off in KY &amp; SC! Machines will show reversed votes to B, intentionally?
1336314308133871618 2020-12-08 22:18:53 +0800 <JUthergi> But that would have required adapting the slavery biz model &amp; that would upset our whole colonial dominion mindset... Isn't it time for trickle up economics?
1336313358698557441 2020-12-08 22:15:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Adults too! We do not need to see russia's best useful idiot type asset handler in the glory of her surgically developed nakedness!
1336128768776220674 2020-12-08 10:01:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @pcon1 @ptozer207 Skeletons? Did HB die in jail? All those accusations? It was that mysterious laptop that rudy found right? So much evidence must have come out in that trial that the judge didn't even adjudicate, just sent him to prison! Justice!
1336127082997440514 2020-12-08 09:54:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @akuhl5 @OMGno2trump Is it possible that the pass on pfizer had anything to do with trump demanding that pfizer give gift cards to Sr Citizens wi his signature, to secure Sr votes?
1336126166114177025 2020-12-08 09:51:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @flipmom1 @OMGno2trump IKR? I'd just be lost wo trump house of wings, trump steaks, healthy pills, ties, my t.u. degree, my trump ff miles for flying trump air to gamble @ trump Taj Mahal...Soo much to be thankful for!!?
1336124751597678592 2020-12-08 09:45:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Hope so! Got a strange feeling he will attempt to hi- jack the jet, put his name on it &amp; head for Argentina to visit his genetically correct "kissing" cousins...
1336123825990365189 2020-12-08 09:41:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Mc cons All been lobbying! He just works so hard, but not for WTP!
1336123408036270080 2020-12-08 09:40:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @a2znan2 @BorisTrump6 &amp; that's the sanitized version bc king j1 didn't like the Genoa Bible that was paid ok with the rest of the world roughly 1070 - 1500s?  Evangies might not know that the book they preach from is not the same the pilgrims bought here to Plymouth...but shhh!  Easier to fool...
1336121064246665217 2020-12-08 09:31:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @DjentuhPeter @MWJ1231 KY too! Asking for blue states; is the abbreviation for Kentucky, KY, because mutch is sticking it to the rest of us for his welfare state? Like greasing palms, but worse?
1336120229592784898 2020-12-08 09:27:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Audit graham's rigged election!!!
1336119988328030210 2020-12-08 09:26:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @LindseyGrahamSC  3-4 separate certifications of the legal votes is not enough? You really must hate trump, like the old lindsie, to force him to watch himself lose again &amp; again &amp; again, etc.?
1336118579423481864 2020-12-08 09:21:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like lindsie is crying out for help? He must want to be investigated himself for govt obstruction before the new Spec Prosecutor gets to him?  mutch mc cons All had to have forced him to say this. Mc cons All said the same about previous admin attempts to govern. Exgop
1336116149474512899 2020-12-08 09:11:28 +0800 <JUthergi> trump &amp; so many of his "people" claim the elections were rigged &amp; dead people voted!  Could the souls of the 280k fellow CITIZENS killed by the trump virus &amp; negligent "leadership" have actually coordinated energies to flip even vanky's voting machines?  ghouliani team where r u?
1336113390230581250 2020-12-08 09:00:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @JimEverage There's always wacky weed cigars?  a doobie a day keeps the magas away, but since they've obviously been smokin sumpthin it could be a nice gesture to share...  Holiday Spirit! Better than eggnog?
1336111838224932867 2020-12-08 08:54:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Did tyrannosaurus rex go extinct bc it couldn't eat hamberders with it's tiny hands?  Or did all the other dinosaurs gang up on him bc he was tyrannical?  Either way it would give WTP hope that nature will rid us of our trumpasauras rex, our laws don't seem to be working! P2A!
1336110530235392000 2020-12-08 08:49:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @kathy_eisel Now people, pfizer was mean to the EX pres, they could have given Sr Citizens money to vote for trump but they didn't! He really wanted to steal, I meant buy, (but this pencil eraser is just not working), the Sr vote.
1336020143034556416 2020-12-08 02:49:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Now he's outright threatening...
1336018832109031427 2020-12-08 02:44:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe they could give him a colonoscopy? You know...just for kicks???
1336017449792266240 2020-12-08 02:39:16 +0800 <JUthergi> IKR? Thought i was just nodding off, snapping awake to the same response over &amp; over. i couldn't watch anymore bc i truly believe GA voters know A CARPETBAGGER when the iconic CARPETBAGGER arrives!!!
1336015025488752645 2020-12-08 02:29:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Uh sir? Pardon my ignorance but is this coach gable getting the M.O.F. gym jordan's coach???
1336014339824881670 2020-12-08 02:26:55 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Dr Lee! If ever there was a time that WTP collectively need guidance...
1336013006782787589 2020-12-08 02:21:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @bflomickey @francisckfoo @tribelaw Most frightening is that all we had to do to prevent a trump was to simply PAY ATTENTION!   Now knowing that almost 70m people didn't pay attention, i might have to quarantine from my fellow citizens, forever.  In GDR, 1/3 say it wasn't happening 1/3 believed &amp; 1/3...
1336007718411399168 2020-12-08 02:00:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @Sethmcneil5V @tribelaw Please, don't insult the Mafia.  Trump, through his countless ties to Russian oligarchy &amp; criminal enterprise he was made a Mafiya Donnie!  Just ask simion migolevich...
1336006831056056320 2020-12-08 01:57:04 +0800 <JUthergi> If the press just followed the stories, or even ever followed up stories, trump &amp; his ilk would already be in prison. Just because they think WTP have the attn span of a fly on veep's head, it doesn't mean we...sorry i forgot what i was saying.
1336005358859538435 2020-12-08 01:51:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Best performance of the chicken boy's life!!!
1336002911076225027 2020-12-08 01:41:30 +0800 <JUthergi> That was BEFORE china filed out vanky's patents &amp; BEFORE her voting machines were built. trump never lies, he just alternates...
1335997648625676293 2020-12-08 01:20:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is this person from another state even in GA? Like H.Clinton, she moved into NYS to run for sen. Having difficulty here bc it seems like we have prof candidates whose only job is to get elected to support elected elites. Hasn't been about WTP it's only about power 4 party...
1335995094579613696 2020-12-08 01:10:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReverendWarnock @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! This one betrayed you too! She thinks you lost &amp; couldn't hide it! Lock her up too!
1335992752920727555 2020-12-08 01:01:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @Shelbel325 Sumpthin to do wit da devil goin to GA?
1335983627511980033 2020-12-08 00:24:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Just stop! You do know that Pearl Harbor is nowhere near mal lago, right? Why bother, you really think you can be president? Sure Jan.
1335982529388670982 2020-12-08 00:20:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @CokerBill @ArleneRabenbau1 @myhlee True, but he is the bigliest worse loser in the history of humanity here on earth! That's winning, right?
1335980336640118785 2020-12-08 00:11:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Am so confused...thought his legacy would be trump house of wings &amp; the chicken dance he does trying to look hip after so many decades. Such flair!
1335978557697384450 2020-12-08 00:04:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh vanky! Such a devoted daughter you are! Good thing this photoshopped pic was avail to show how powerfully handsome, with such flair, your daddy would look on this sacred Indigenous mt. Was he so upset after sat in GA that you had to tell him he could be memorialized in stone?
1335975528495534081 2020-12-07 23:52:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @JuddLegum Is this one of the dead voters people are talking about?   Thought this guy died in jail after his elitist behavior got him censured? Didn't he make a promise to WTP but forgot all about it after re elected?
1335970630693433344 2020-12-07 23:33:14 +0800 <JUthergi> The trump virus rages on
1335968906926813193 2020-12-07 23:26:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Call me crazy, but creatures barely just learning survival outside of swinging in the trees, might not even be able to tie the knot to hang others in those trees...so much love the trump family shares in this season of hope &amp; good will to all.
1335966153630429187 2020-12-07 23:15:26 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's last chance to do something good, boot the back room boys, lindsie &amp; mutch
1335964951375192069 2020-12-07 23:10:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Nothing to see or compare right here, move along. Oh, look! Shiny objects over that way!  https://t.co/bM8U60a1Re
1335620686610632706 2020-12-07 00:22:40 +0800 <JUthergi> An example of the value the elected elites place upon WTP...
1335401060131803138 2020-12-06 09:49:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Is trump about to nullify the election? Hoping to be wrong
1335389243951157253 2020-12-06 09:03:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Is he about to explode momentarily? It's a bit disconcerting, to say the least, right now!!!
1335384152045203460 2020-12-06 08:42:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Someone just worked harder these past three weeks than any time in his entire life?  mmmm, ok?
1335382807808454659 2020-12-06 08:37:26 +0800 <JUthergi> "Irrefutable fact", now forever forward shall now mean: "win"!  trump, not me!   Apparently he's convinced his scotus nominees owe him a nullification of this election.  Best win out of three tries?  Sooner or later he'll win BY A LOT?
1335374535772803073 2020-12-06 08:04:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Sure she was...best on earth since time began...  Wait! Did the Romans have porn mags?
1335373312432746496 2020-12-06 07:59:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Please please please could you really make this happen?  JDM for Superman 2020!!!
1335372892931022849 2020-12-06 07:58:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @DocuMom @DanRather Let us pray...
1335372630107582464 2020-12-06 07:56:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @NKhanarian @DanRather Magic, that which has yet to be proven scientifically, right? E.g. sleight of hand, card tricks work only bc hand is quicker than the eye...
1335369725346533376 2020-12-06 07:45:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Go JDM!  For a moment, i really thought that this whole trump episode of the TZ really happened!!!  It was just a nightmare i had, right???
1335368551583129600 2020-12-06 07:40:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it gone yet, the trump virus?  We're not supposed to talk about it after 11/3/20 are we?  Why is it so difficult to disperse with these pesky hoax thingys?
1335367785489321988 2020-12-06 07:37:44 +0800 <JUthergi> How could anyone truly dedicated to serving WTP, (under oath), actually allow these power grabs to continue? I wonder if the more divided by voter data districts are held by those elected elite who have been in office longest?  Might tell us a lot as to what happened to United S?
1335365173918490627 2020-12-06 07:27:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @davidfrum Maybe a bit more like Cathy Bates?
1335364573201829888 2020-12-06 07:24:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @ginnernyc @davidfrum @realDonaldTrump Well, he was a dem, tried to garner dem support on several attempts to be pres. He was rejected, thus the vitriolic meltdowns attacking clintons dem party &amp; OUR REPUBLIC!  Remember the kid who would kick over the board games? He became pres.   We probably shouldn't tell kids this
1335343875922202625 2020-12-06 06:02:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch She WAS fired?
1335343362011000833 2020-12-06 06:00:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Please?
1335343141394784261 2020-12-06 05:59:49 +0800 <JUthergi> He was likely advised by senmajldr mc cons all...
1335342436109922310 2020-12-06 05:57:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @blinxeto Great news! Been having so much trouble with the fit...google must have some ideas?
1335340658454880257 2020-12-06 05:49:57 +0800 <JUthergi> How do they let him continue? He's not the only one in favor of dictatorial rule...
1335340213149765633 2020-12-06 05:48:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Pay attention people! He's nearly rid of those pesky Civil Servants dedicated to the laws of OUR REPUBLIC!  Step by step...
1335339489976324098 2020-12-06 05:45:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Are we still not to mention his new hairdo?
1335337901140406273 2020-12-06 05:38:59 +0800 <JUthergi> So true! Help trump by NOT voting in another rigged election! He is counting on us, don't let him down again, stay home!
1335337318090240001 2020-12-06 05:36:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepKatiePorter TY for putting people over profits!
1335335876809854983 2020-12-06 05:30:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Rep Porter for Madam Speaker!   younger leaders bring possibility of not just one mixed party, but we might have two distinctly different parties (*prefer 3). Parties dedicated to human Citizens with the "citizens" granted via citizens united relegated to community services.
1335333888516886529 2020-12-06 05:23:02 +0800 <JUthergi> hope springs eternal that i'll learn to type on this thing or at least proof read. Sorry.  25th! Ammendment Day might make more sense of my blather.
1335333264513519616 2020-12-06 05:20:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Sure wish today was 24th Ammendment Day...well hope springs eternal, right? Plus+! This day ain't over yet &amp; i heard they released trumpasauras rex to wreck GA' s voting system!  all i want for Christmas is two fired trump's &amp; a kushner in a pear tree...  Been missing you Dr Lee!
1335280779694366724 2020-12-06 01:52:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Another failed biz venture? Poor donnie, he couldn't even improve his dancing skills after all those years, hopefully he'll only  be remembered as the chicken dance guy...
1335279072520376326 2020-12-06 01:45:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Why can't i believe that these two actually stalked and killed in the wilds of Africa? Thinking that the local boss raised these cats from birth to wander the wilds of a 10x12 pen so beevus &amp; butthead could climb the dangerous ladder to the shooting platform...
1335276561608699906 2020-12-06 01:35:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @LuLuRoche Asking/ seem to recall when trying to get help to WTP she referenced the despicable position mitch had on corp liabilities. Hopeful that she would fight it but naivete seems to be my strong suit. Still seems like one party dedicated to the gdp, our product is the $.
1335271546840096776 2020-12-06 01:15:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReesusP @DayleBrand @Acyn @LaraLeaTrump @JoeBiden Is this lara or vanky or tiffany or melissa or GA kelly or conway kelly or kelly mc enemy or laura fox or ... All these bleach blonde stepford types look alike to me!  Shouldn't these iconic women be the new "karen" , kelly seems more appropriate!
1335268904436965376 2020-12-06 01:04:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Think of all the improvements to the general welfare of WTP if that revenue was sent to Education! Is the resistance here by alcohol, tobacco &amp; firearm industries? Not a lot of potheads getting drunk chewing tobacco &amp; shooting guns before driving home drunk to beat wife &amp; kids...
1335267675740794886 2020-12-06 00:59:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Would anyone else like to see 24h Meidas Touch tv? Public service channels!
1335266332238082051 2020-12-06 00:54:36 +0800 <JUthergi> she caved to mitch on the corp liabilities? This is out of control and it's gonna get even uglier! Now, free from liabilities if we catch c19 @ work, or if the vaccine side effects maim or kill us, we can rest assured that stock values will continue to rise! Mitch &amp; Nancy get $!
1335264249262829568 2020-12-06 00:46:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @GOPAreCorrupt @ReportsDaNews Already selling our top f35 jets...
1335262083131301893 2020-12-06 00:37:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @smith_kennet @HelenKennedy @Jeanne_Mann Here I thought it was a SNL rerun! Comedy writers will be out of biz soon. The next hit comedy movie could be real life film clips of our trumpian titans in action!
1335259111966056454 2020-12-06 00:25:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Wisdom for the world!
1335257567723917312 2020-12-06 00:19:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @MunisMomma @cmclymer With the advent of AI we've advanced to Artificially Generated Intelligence. Computers think! Advantage could provide instant data mining to find antiquated laws then streamline + so much more!
1335248172625621000 2020-12-05 23:42:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Good read. Corporate social &amp; ecological responsibilities sounds like oxymoron of the day. Corps exist to profit. They love self regulation over gov regulation claiming benefit to WTP/Enviro. If that was true there'd be no need for regs in 1st place.   A republic without laws???
1335242017987829760 2020-12-05 23:17:59 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Rhol! But he ain't done yet!  trump's new army leadership &amp; his sens talking about ML &amp; Iran a lil too much for this ol dog.  He ain't the only wannabe dictator in DC!
1335012644198244354 2020-12-05 08:06:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir? Is it true that mitch &amp; lindsie took President Biden out to dinner tonight, to congratulate him on his victory?  Isn't that like a betrayal of their loyalty to you?
1335009935768363017 2020-12-05 07:55:46 +0800 <JUthergi> So trumpasauras rex is goin down to GA?   Going to convince people to vote, in same voting process he claims stole presidency from him?  Were the tiny, logic starved starved brains, the reason dinosaurs like trump went extinct, or was it just the tiny hands?
1335001059543056384 2020-12-05 07:20:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Still looks like a used car salesman in a leisure suit...
1335000161664323584 2020-12-05 07:16:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Does this people will no longer die in jail for smoking a doobie?
1334999334497161222 2020-12-05 07:13:39 +0800 <JUthergi> If only he would dare to stand, then we could pelt him with cabbages, tomatoes &amp; rotten apples like they did for the carnival barkers of old when caught scamming the people...
1334997533010120705 2020-12-05 07:06:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Another tantrum?
1334994793588527106 2020-12-05 06:55:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this about his weight? Below his neck we can let him slide because, well, trump virus. But that rather large meathead...no excuses!
1334992880847482882 2020-12-05 06:48:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Mc cons all?
1334909949571452930 2020-12-05 01:18:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Still no call for a moment of respect for innocent Citizens killed by trump virus. Which is most difficult to accept: willful negligence by those in power focused only on retaining that power, or the fact they forced almost 300k innocent souls to die bc of them?
1334903821517148160 2020-12-05 00:54:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Nothing to see here...just move along &amp; make America great (for greed corruption &amp; no laws to restrain us)
1334901412556386306 2020-12-05 00:44:32 +0800 <JUthergi> trumpy bear need feed!
1334898484592472066 2020-12-05 00:32:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Sure hope the new Admin talks to ex pres about his uncanny ability to find &amp; hire "all the best people"!
1334896824969289730 2020-12-05 00:26:18 +0800 <JUthergi> No Russian collusion, it's just biz as usual!
1334896433531596801 2020-12-05 00:24:45 +0800 <JUthergi> she's living la vida Loca!
1334884525558685704 2020-12-04 23:37:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Nearly completed, loyalist to control military needed for final steps to dictatorship. Seems like he's just getting started...  https://t.co/R22zvuJfus
1334656172671045633 2020-12-04 08:30:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Write in trump! Is it true that rona woman secretly donated to Biden/Harris campaign? You know, just in case she betrayed our dear leader and wanted a job? Write in trump bc he wants us to! The more votes for trump the closer he gets to victory!!!
1334655069489393666 2020-12-04 08:25:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Starting to think that all her facial surgeries and augmentation surgeries were actually paid by WTP as she wrote them off as deductible biz expenses...
1334653765299867653 2020-12-04 08:20:28 +0800 <JUthergi> That face! Arrghhh! Sometimes i wish he would just run face first into a block wall, over &amp; over etc. How many of us have to catch ourselves from pounding our heads on the wall every time he talks corp liability protection while WTP die? Arrghhh!!!
1334652207883489282 2020-12-04 08:14:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Even dubya was afraid of it...
1334651346344161281 2020-12-04 08:10:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Any of our neighbors near Toronto Ontario Canada hear about the meteor that hit around 1200h yesterday? Apparently visible in Buffalo NY &amp; felt/heard across lake in Onondaga County/central NY?  Big enough to be seen &amp; heard but no reports of landing or any damages.  Odd? TY
1334647669315276803 2020-12-04 07:56:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Great now all trump supporting women will be sporting the Melissa's mess hairdo...
1334646813949915143 2020-12-04 07:52:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Working her propaganda before more charges filed that daddy can't pardon her for?  Formal depo=you're screwed. Seems like the nyc condo deal, inflated condo values to "Market Rates", (low qual condos), then told the banks completely deflated prices. Just more trump trickery!
1334643984245923840 2020-12-04 07:41:36 +0800 <JUthergi> hbsc? Nice commercial but don't you think it's important to tell people you are a chinese owned bank?
1334643248917307394 2020-12-04 07:38:41 +0800 <JUthergi> She must study propaganda promotion with mitch &amp; lindsie...
1334565060547579905 2020-12-04 02:28:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @RADrebel43 @DeanObeidallah The elected elite have already absconded with the once honorable term of Patriot.
1334563528347443201 2020-12-04 02:21:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like mitch is the leader of the NFFA, (New Founding Father's of America), and he's close to sounding the horn for THE PURGE of those who fight fascism.  Just remember NFFA wannabes, the people never react well to tyrants...
1334561188164857857 2020-12-04 02:12:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like the key factor here is that trump's version of good govt does not match that of anyone else's, anywhere on earth.
1334560500022190083 2020-12-04 02:09:52 +0800 <JUthergi> We all have differing abilities..why not support each other?
1334559297011904513 2020-12-04 02:05:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @ememess @ericgarland Seems like the great white jr hunter is out hunting again, this time for the ever elusive CASH COW?
1334557895380373507 2020-12-04 01:59:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @GeminiAf @tadster2 @MarisaKabas Is she a "special" lawyer like rudy &amp; jen?
1334556509376831499 2020-12-04 01:54:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Uncovering truth?
1334546746391859201 2020-12-04 01:15:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Not over yet!
1334545833581273091 2020-12-04 01:11:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @OldParaTRP Our impeached one term biggest loser of elections in US history sets another record!  21 Convicted/Indicted best people hired hired in our short history?  Historians will write of the times of trump the terrible, world's greatest criminal that nearly stole USA to sell for profit!
1334543111549227010 2020-12-04 01:00:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @Delia1donegal Shouldn't FCC require this sign to be posted before every hamhead opinion entertainment show?
1334542087929344002 2020-12-04 00:56:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Now that barr has blown his chance of a pardon, does anyone think he's man enough to open an investigation into the ex pres' actions in office?  Me either...guess domestic enemies don't really count as bad guys if they've been elected to an office.
1334539753966931968 2020-12-04 00:47:26 +0800 <JUthergi> The incompetence &amp; our lack of leadership is not merely staggering, it is malignant negligence bordering on genocide...  Will the UN or any countries come to our aid?
1334535264841109505 2020-12-04 00:29:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Force trump to sign a NDA under penalty of treason &amp; loss of all post pres benefits.  With no SS protections the Russian Mafiya &amp; South American Cartels will hopefully deal with him in their own ways for not paying his bills.
1334533771471835138 2020-12-04 00:23:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't this a Chinese bank?
1334254139157700620 2020-12-03 05:52:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe it's bc this group of elites spends money on msm advertising? i'd hate to think that msm is biased against WTP...
1334252810196701192 2020-12-03 05:47:13 +0800 <JUthergi> It almost sounds like you've been trafficked yourself, it is good to see your contrived message... Heard daddy wants to pardon you. Why would such an innocent wannabe president need a pardon? Bad optics there too.
1334251229279625217 2020-12-03 05:40:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, at least somebody up there figured it out.
1334250390037159938 2020-12-03 05:37:36 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP would welcome this training but our masters seem to want us fat, dumb &amp; silent. Happiness is an individual choice....
1334222493490552841 2020-12-03 03:46:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Heard that President Biden broke his foot &amp; has to wear a boot, that's too bad.  Please tell me he only KICKED trump's ASS figuratively?  Although, it is something 80m of us wouldn't complain about if he actually did...such a huuuge target!
1334219871496843272 2020-12-03 03:36:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Which crimes against humanity are they finally admitting to?
1334219449491140612 2020-12-03 03:34:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Still hoping that Mother Nature will step in to hasten the extinction of   #trumpasaurasrex   and the trump virus...
1334215916746395650 2020-12-03 03:20:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Obviously, they're still afraid of the trumpy bear tantrums.
1334215005110226944 2020-12-03 03:17:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper But didn't trump claim children are immune, just like him?
1334214608366809089 2020-12-03 03:15:25 +0800 <JUthergi> An inside look to questioning the ilk that believes it is above the law... TY Rep Porter!!!
1334212804606308353 2020-12-03 03:08:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @ratfink6923 @LauraBe08859061 @ncst8pe2020 @mkraju Aaron Burr or bill barr? Thought it was a witty comparison! lol
1334206318798901248 2020-12-03 02:42:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Please please please let it be done! We cannot get that despicable old gelding from KY back in the barn soon enough! Let him burn his own house down, not ours!
1334204327746002947 2020-12-03 02:34:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Rep Porter for AG!  This Rep just destroyed the munchkin guy who likes to lie!  U corrupted too? KATIE COMING for you!  TY Rep Porter!!!
1334200656182259719 2020-12-03 02:19:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Do we have to relinquish the rights to live just so big biz can be free from responsibility to protect employees from trump virus? Do we have to give up our right to live if C19 vaccines/therapeutics turn us into vegetables or dead meat? mitch thinks so!
1334198774990839819 2020-12-03 02:12:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Truth hurts!
1334198448237785096 2020-12-03 02:11:12 +0800 <JUthergi> What other TAX PAYER funded programs have they stolen from? Surely this can't be the only one...dig deeper!
1334197582558539776 2020-12-03 02:07:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @mrctv How hard is it for ALL elected elites that practice; do as we say, not as we do bc we exempt ourselves from any association with you disgusting people of the horrid masses?  Have you considered that both parties are corrupted beyond belief?
1334193851687456775 2020-12-03 01:52:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheRickWilson @ClcpierceCarol Sorely needed laughs!!!
1334193486816538624 2020-12-03 01:51:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like it already is...
1334193181597032448 2020-12-03 01:50:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Instead of listing achievements of their tenure, gop elites throughout the land we're all saying, I hope I can leave office with my reputation intact.  It's like they know they're bad guys &amp; want to keep that reputation for street cred.
1334192172355244034 2020-12-03 01:46:16 +0800 <JUthergi> As this appears to be trump's plan all along and since trump likes to leak info, i can't help but to think that trump shared his stable (mad) genius plan with the q people.
1334191566991265797 2020-12-03 01:43:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @anyonewantchips Best hypothetical question of the year?
1334190826013007874 2020-12-03 01:40:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Every day i ask myself who is most despicable corrupted member of elected elites? This guy outshines trump on many days and all others every day!
1334189763948138504 2020-12-03 01:36:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Do those senators exist?
1334189551477288962 2020-12-03 01:35:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Just wow!
1334180302877564931 2020-12-03 00:59:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Have WTP figured out what the real hoax is yet? (hint: starts with t &amp; ends with p &amp; it's not something we use on our derriere, but if the name could be printed on t.p. it would be a sell out!)
1334178869604212736 2020-12-03 00:53:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Soo many similarities. Those reports from court docs, (on trump divorce), claiming trump kept a book of Hitler's strategies locked in his nightstand makes the coming days even more terrifying!
1334177855316643840 2020-12-03 00:49:23 +0800 <JUthergi> #boycotttrumps All we have to do is LOOK AWAY!  Many other shiny things to look at.
1334177294320087045 2020-12-03 00:47:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @mortgageconsult @dazyjane410 Sounds like internet laws would hinder trump's new on line media venture?  He can lie if he wants to because "the power of the pres is absolute", right?  Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet???
1334175930311462913 2020-12-03 00:41:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @sarahkendzior @AndreaChalupa @gaslitnation Posh with trump's flair?
1334174059991617539 2020-12-03 00:34:18 +0800 <JUthergi> The coup d'etat in USA was achieved without firing a shot, Kruschev was right. We lost because the battle was fought to gain control of hearts &amp; minds, achieved step by step...
1334173251363336194 2020-12-03 00:31:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! Another betrayal of all you stand for, who is this person without german genes like yours?
1334171183047204866 2020-12-03 00:22:52 +0800 <JUthergi> A manly man?
1334166632915197954 2020-12-03 00:04:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Beginning to understand why the 25th Ammendment has yet to be invoked... cowardice is contagious too!
1334162453148692481 2020-12-02 23:48:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging to hope, how much longer?
1334161963891503108 2020-12-02 23:46:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Election Fraud Opus! The musical comedy of the trump tantrums...
1333894481800728576 2020-12-02 06:03:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Heaven help us! Plagues on our elected elite might wouldn't upset us at all! You could restrain it only to those that keep buying their seats,  anyone over two terms in office.
1333892810748157954 2020-12-02 05:56:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Just in case you missed it, sir.
1333892395214180354 2020-12-02 05:55:04 +0800 <JUthergi> jr? Any coincidence that your clan is trying to get hotels built in these countries, (also turkey SA, UAE Israel ect.)?  Did vanky rat you out to SDNY yet? Seems like you have better things to sorry about?  How's that trump virus hoax working out for ya? Any miracles yet?
1333890409005801472 2020-12-02 05:47:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Betting that mc con All, the crackers guy from SC &amp; jethro kennedy from LA won't be able to pay respect to a woman boss...
1333888475486097408 2020-12-02 05:39:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @JIFlagg2 @ReportsDaNews Trump must have refused to pardon billy boy. Barr got trumped!
1333887892276514817 2020-12-02 05:37:10 +0800 <JUthergi> But the pres read through all of the data. You'd be surprised how quickly he grasps the details...sure doc. Some of us remember her commitment to trump over WTP. When did birx know it was transmitted through air?
1333819089450627074 2020-12-02 01:03:46 +0800 <JUthergi> More please, please can we have some more?
1333815860214059009 2020-12-02 00:50:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Too bad we don't have a Mccarthy type to chase down &amp; expose all the trumpettes lurking in the shadows just waiting to launch their treasonous attacks on OUR REPUBLIC!
1333800537205002241 2020-12-01 23:50:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @JuddLegum @USChamber Seems like they are dedicated to corporate rule by design. Thanks to lewis powell they became the true manipulative juggernaut in the 70s.
1333525930032164872 2020-12-01 05:38:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Just like in DC?
1333525591522504704 2020-12-01 05:37:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @AntarianRani He had to buy vanky's Chinese Patented/ Manufactured Voting Machines to insure his win!
1333524861868716035 2020-12-01 05:34:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @FightGandhi @twpolk @ESCochrane @LiveSquawk And most of us are paying for KY's abysmal failures to contribute to our country's well being!  Imagine the infrastructure improvs, health care &amp; education investments we could enjoy if we weren't paying for mitch's WELFARE STATE!
1333522968715153409 2020-12-01 05:27:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Does Russia's best handler even have feelings? Does she really care?
1333522469660094469 2020-12-01 05:25:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Tech is a weapon of war &amp; we need to work with allies as diligently as we do for nukes!
1333521642639810563 2020-12-01 05:21:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @CNN Wasn't this a threat to those who dared to not vote for him?   Isn't it possible he could include  wall St in his scorched earth plans?
1333520768328732674 2020-12-01 05:18:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Any of our elected elite that does not create/ support a single clean bill for C19 relief based on the following, do not represent WTP... 1-immediate &amp; cont. $ aid to human Citizens only. (Ppe food shelter) 2-$ aid/ppe equip for medical pers. 3-hospital $ equip needs K.I.S.S. !
1333517461996580864 2020-12-01 05:05:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @ddanpereira @BidenInaugural @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Any way we can get him out the same day house/sen certify new President's victory? Evict by Jan 6?
1333515155792142343 2020-12-01 04:56:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @marilyngho @googlenews I think trump meant that he would crash the market if we dared vote against him.  He still has time to do more damage...
1333512792679321602 2020-12-01 04:46:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Do good &amp; good things happen to you. Obviously poor trump never learned about this.
1333510626841415685 2020-12-01 04:38:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like he had a Karen as his best brave hero to " testify".
1333508357131554816 2020-12-01 04:29:02 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Sarah Kendzior!
1333508150973124611 2020-12-01 04:28:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Did our new FLOTUS decorate while ex flotus wasn't looking?
1333505941300523009 2020-12-01 04:19:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking that this weasel &amp; master instigator may be trying to start a war?  the trump show, preparing for grand finale episode is leaning towards blood in our streets/ruler for life or war with Iran. Seems like they're testing possible ratings now.
1333504651115769858 2020-12-01 04:14:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Dear twitter, Please tell us if you would have passed out the am radios Hitler used for direct comms with the people in his steps to DICTATORIAL RULE? Oh, you would never do that? Then why have you not banned trump?  Does TWITTER SUPPORT DICTATORIAL RULE???
1333502321632931849 2020-12-01 04:05:03 +0800 <JUthergi> #trumpisirrelevant
1333501970477408256 2020-12-01 04:03:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet???
1333501523716943872 2020-12-01 04:01:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @stucam7771 @TeresaM51981532 Starting a war with Iran is also very likely!
1333500241753092099 2020-12-01 03:56:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe these folks should accuse trump for fraudulent presidenting and failure to do his job?
1333497634674380800 2020-12-01 03:46:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @AOC @pamgriffa What about his fighting to guarantee vaccine mnfctrs liability protection if vaccines turn us into vegetables, it just dead meat? Keep up the good fights! TY!
1333496402912145410 2020-12-01 03:41:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... Very fine between trump admin &amp; total dictatorial rule...  Is today 25th Amendment Day???
1333491098854035459 2020-12-01 03:20:27 +0800 <JUthergi> She does think GS Citizens are all idiots! Why else would she run in GA and not her own state? Carpetbagger?
1333490329027276802 2020-12-01 03:17:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Anyone else vote for ex flotus to turn over WH decorating to our new FLOTUS?  Otherwise, i fear she'll place Charlie Brown type Christmas Trees everywhere!
1333488887981813762 2020-12-01 03:11:40 +0800 <JUthergi> How do WTP get rid of this abominable being?  It's obvious the house/sen members like what he is doing to WTP!!!  If any current rep. or sen. fails to speak against or take action to impeach mitch, THEY SUPPORT mitch and his policies!!!
1333486657673326592 2020-12-01 03:02:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Doesn't this same gop bill also hold harmless from liability all c19 vaccine makers if their drugs turn us into vegetables, or dead meat?
1333484042193342466 2020-12-01 02:52:25 +0800 <JUthergi> There are no laws if there is no recourse for breaking them...
1333480785253445636 2020-12-01 02:39:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Doesn't this make her a carpetbagger? All proud Citizens of the South despise carpetbaggers!
1333477669623779337 2020-12-01 02:27:05 +0800 <JUthergi> C'mon! Show us that beautiful smile?
1333477302370521096 2020-12-01 02:25:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Support trump! Write in his name when you vote in GA! He needs help! Stop the steal w/ your write in and maga forever!

1333475514049306625 2020-12-01 02:18:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently becoming irrelevant is one of his biggliest fears, yet with each word he spews, he becomes even more irrelevant.  Similar situation, The Peter Principle, wherein one rises to the level of one's own incompetence?
1333473778945445893 2020-12-01 02:11:38 +0800 <JUthergi> I think that game ended with tricky dick nixon?
1333471221460201472 2020-12-01 02:01:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Perhaps this could help you to understand, sir?
1333470027207634946 2020-12-01 01:56:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Proof has yet to be added to the trump lexicon...
1333469403124523008 2020-12-01 01:54:15 +0800 <JUthergi> No. trump wasn't born yet, no maga trumpettes either. What a wonderful time it must have been, despite pandemic &amp; world war! A world without trump means the sun will come out tomorrow!
1333467955959574530 2020-12-01 01:48:29 +0800 <JUthergi> So happy i have such a tremendously terrific grasp of the obvious.
1333464166011645954 2020-12-01 01:33:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Are they still on vacation?
1333462118172151808 2020-12-01 01:25:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Even comedians know how frightening trump is &amp; it's NOT FUNNY!
1333460085759225856 2020-12-01 01:17:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Has any of this dawned on you yet?
1333458972272156675 2020-12-01 01:12:48 +0800 <JUthergi> It ain't over yet, the most dangerous human is hate filled &amp; seeking revenge upon us all!
1333448684126793730 2020-12-01 00:31:55 +0800 <JUthergi> There is good reason for calling mc con All moscow's mitch...
1333446596344811523 2020-12-01 00:23:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Premeditated &amp; willful negligence?
1333446113630826500 2020-12-01 00:21:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Is Jan 6th is the official date of certifications by house/sen?  Why then do we wait for ceremonial act of swearing in elected? In these times of great peril, we need to move trump out ASAP!  Today is a good day to initiate 25th Ammendment!  If only we had a courageous cabinet...
1333444693787602947 2020-12-01 00:16:03 +0800 <JUthergi> how many times did trumpy bear promise the economy would crash if Biden elected?  It was always his intent to take misguided revenge on us all!  Step by step.
1333443010948952065 2020-12-01 00:09:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is he involved? Does he need more financing or is he the messenger to start a war with Persian Empire?
1333440541753810945 2020-11-30 23:59:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @PaulaWarmath @moothepuk @DianaRVA1 @MeidasTouch @Perduesenate @NydiaTisdale Ty!  heard that touching ones nose is a subconscious attempt to hide from truth? Body language expert can offer better insights...
1333438650412044290 2020-11-30 23:52:03 +0800 <JUthergi> It's not working. Almost seems like soc media is the place to see info, then research it for factual content. We all become more informed &amp; that is enough to make msm obsolete!
1333437311183413248 2020-11-30 23:46:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Crying trumpy bear seems to think that bc there were a lot of votes in his favor he won. He just can't seem to grasp concept that you need to get a lot more votes than your opponent to win. Stay sharp people this is the point he usually flips over the game table! Most dangerous!
1333096795925327874 2020-11-30 01:13:38 +0800 <JUthergi> He would give even more credence to the statement, that he who represents himself in a court of law has a fool for a client!
1333095367441850381 2020-11-30 01:07:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Sure pops! No worries bc no one would talk disrespectfully to the Real POTUS. Have you forgotten you lost the recent election by 6m pop votes, twice that of '16, got impeached, didn't keep promises, lie more often than you breathe &amp; not deserving of our respect?
1333092728800948227 2020-11-30 00:57:28 +0800 <JUthergi> He has already stated publicly: "nobody disobeys my orders, the power of the president is absolute!"  He really believes it too!  Buckle up baby, the crazy train is getting ready to leave the station!
1333091349768380427 2020-11-30 00:52:00 +0800 <JUthergi> All this, despite taking an oath of honor...
1333090542826233862 2020-11-30 00:48:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @BizzleMcDizzle @MustweSuffer @Acyn Good thing he was so focused on solving the low flo toilet crisis. 15 flushes or more but now that we're in "massive" territory is trump the only man that can save us all?
1333089462763610117 2020-11-30 00:44:30 +0800 <JUthergi> She is aging well...
1333089015915012098 2020-11-30 00:42:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @Nerzog999 @DonGone5 @WarlickLeslie @Acyn Sucker born every minute
1333087545337520132 2020-11-30 00:36:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like he's ready for the new "Burning Down The House" video by Meidas Touch?  We certainly are! Thanks!
1333086286421385216 2020-11-30 00:31:52 +0800 <JUthergi> The true ugly is yet to begin...
1333072081119027205 2020-11-29 23:35:26 +0800 <JUthergi> But how can the elected elite do their work without help?
1333070676652126208 2020-11-29 23:29:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1333068265040597002 2020-11-29 23:20:16 +0800 <JUthergi> "Dead people filled out ballot applications and many thousands, tens if thousands of dead people voted! They cheated I won!" Glitches!  Did you see the dead people vote sir?  This is a good day for the 25th Ammendment!
1333065498444124164 2020-11-29 23:09:16 +0800 <JUthergi> i'd be happy if i didn't have to wear a hamberder around my neck just to get my dog to look at me like that!  (wife's idea after asking why she never looks at me like pence does his master)
1332810010804547585 2020-11-29 06:14:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @greywan @AynRandPaulRyan Momma, don't let your boys grow up to be...gop cowboys.
1332809077349634048 2020-11-29 06:10:21 +0800 <JUthergi> He led the way!
1332808762822963202 2020-11-29 06:09:06 +0800 <JUthergi> That's the newtie we all remember!  It's so entertaining to watch him on those cable opinion shows pretending to be knowledgeable. We know you newt, are you related to, (or dating) mitch, you could be twins!
1332807777790664705 2020-11-29 06:05:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Trump who?
1332807418657583106 2020-11-29 06:03:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Lone voice in the wilderness?
1332806600235642881 2020-11-29 06:00:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Uh sir? Maybe you could get someone to read this to you? Seems you might have miscalculated...
1332772731251789824 2020-11-29 03:45:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Did mitch buy vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines? Seriously, unless you truly hate yourself and want to be abused why would anyone vote mitch?
1332770677636681740 2020-11-29 03:37:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Who's next? Charlie Manson? Jeffrey Dahmer?
1332764463355858951 2020-11-29 03:13:04 +0800 <JUthergi> So this is where you've been hiding?  You need a better spot bc your wonderful family is about to leave you holding the fort to fight off the prosecutors!  Turn on them first, get immunity, become president in 2024?
1332762235492593668 2020-11-29 03:04:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @PaisleePearl Living in a gop town adjacent to a gop city in a gop county. Would love to fly this balloon!
1332761218415816705 2020-11-29 03:00:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Are you sure about this? Must be fake news bc i didn't read anything about he'll freezing over today... lol
1332711239022223363 2020-11-28 23:41:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @TomJChicago @dennisaoconnor Arrogant one term biggest pop vote loser impeached ex president  deserves to be spoken to like speaks to everyone else.
1332710398974451716 2020-11-28 23:38:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Is why they call you "diaper don"? Poor guy, no wonder you have to pay so much money for sex!  Stormy should have charged you double!
1332709593374453769 2020-11-28 23:35:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Keep up the great work! Any chance you could hit trump with a "burning down the house" theme, backed by the Talking Heads song of same name? A warning to keep us in our toes until he's really gone?  Thank you.
1332707760249708544 2020-11-28 23:27:45 +0800 <JUthergi> he must care bc he sent a Thanksgiving message to all who have no clue how truly corrupted he is? Why can't we fire mitch???
1332706861783638016 2020-11-28 23:24:11 +0800 <JUthergi> trump virus now eating brain cells!
1332697732646113280 2020-11-28 22:47:54 +0800 <JUthergi> What in earth could make you think WTP want to hear from you. You're the cause of our misery!
1332688098447282177 2020-11-28 22:09:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @girlsreallyrule @Frankie12559230 Looks like this guy is auditioning for the part of trump. They apparently think trump's story will make a terrific musical comedy...
1332443767555715080 2020-11-28 05:58:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @kylegriffin1 Thought it was reported that vanky &amp; jare had their own Pvt servers too?
1332442600649920515 2020-11-28 05:54:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Well presented dangers that are retreating into the shadows. Vigilance requires action to guard our Liberty...
1332441393856385028 2020-11-28 05:49:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @hyoyoonkang @tatiandersen Consider too that sen ldrs are fighting tooth &amp; nail to protect vaccine mnfctrs from any liabilities if their products turn humans into vegetables or just dead meat... Delicate perceptive balances don't need legal liability protection.
1332438095799734272 2020-11-28 05:36:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! Even your children...the betrayals!
1332434309005905925 2020-11-28 05:21:09 +0800 <JUthergi> New rule: Sen must vote on each bill w/in 1 week of receipt so all bills presented to sen voted upon in the same year submitted. No vacation unless bills presented are voted on. Any bill not brought to vote in given yr. shall cut sen pay by 10%/wk up to 100% until all bills voted
1332429564333715456 2020-11-28 05:02:18 +0800 <JUthergi> July seems like a lifetime ago, trump time, where the pain just lingers. Sure would like to see him take that test again!
1332384509145337867 2020-11-28 02:03:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Live the wave from Lincoln to donnie the destroyer in background!
1332383973478117376 2020-11-28 02:01:08 +0800 <JUthergi> That date is merely for  a formal ceremony.   I think the date of Jan 6 is the date upon which both house/sen certify election results.  That is the date Pres Biden / VP Harris are certified as legally in charge.  How many out there think that should be the day trump is removed?
1332380844586098689 2020-11-28 01:48:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't know he could be trusted with secrets.
1332379198468616192 2020-11-28 01:42:09 +0800 <JUthergi> "Nobody disobeys my orders, the power of the pres is absolute" said the squatter in the wh...
1332378560464621572 2020-11-28 01:39:37 +0800 <JUthergi> It is well coordinated behind the scenes.
1332377716956553216 2020-11-28 01:36:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Did trump give the ok? Seems like an awful lot of activity wi SA, Iran, UAE, Israel &amp; US lately. Even fox entertainment doing a lot of orts on Iran.  US pentagon leadership in quandary...looks like trump getting ready for his grand finale episode?
1332374934581108739 2020-11-28 01:25:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step his control grows to enhance the dangers we face...
1332372323031191557 2020-11-28 01:14:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Just saw your statement that Biden can enter wh only if he can prove the most votes ever in our history were not fraudulent. Funny! if you want to stay can you prove that those record votes were fraudulent? Better yet, prove your votes legit! Please just go...
1332371060356952074 2020-11-28 01:09:49 +0800 <JUthergi> So it's still ok for the US to violate treaties, scotus?
1332368101816594436 2020-11-28 00:58:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Fun thought? After trumpy bear's convictions &amp; seizure of his properties he has nowhere to live but at the Y M C A!
1332367307990048771 2020-11-28 00:54:55 +0800 <JUthergi> His relative silence is unnerving at best...
1332362129853337600 2020-11-28 00:34:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Great news!!!
1332360878646292486 2020-11-28 00:29:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Just look at all trump accomplished! It ain't over yet...  https://t.co/kZ0TMhbbyH
1332356920095760384 2020-11-28 00:13:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @jilevin Of course it will.
1332356518025580544 2020-11-28 00:12:02 +0800 <JUthergi> So who in this group is now infected with the trump virus?
1332355491071135746 2020-11-28 00:07:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems our impeached one term, bigliest popular vote &amp; EC loser in US history, has not only surrendered the war to the trump virus but he quit the job too? No surprise, more important things like war with Iran or troops in our streets need to be organized.
1332353250876682240 2020-11-27 23:59:03 +0800 <JUthergi> The seed of chaos has been planted deeply within our collective consciousness, fertile ground for exponential growth...  Step by step, the trump coup d'etat is yet to be defeated.  Please read this report.
1332349226920124419 2020-11-27 23:43:04 +0800 <JUthergi> If we did this to any other sovereign Nation it would be a crime against humanity, likely leading to war?
1332077912217038849 2020-11-27 05:44:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @MalcolmNance @IGLV_05 The wannabe tv producer needs a grand finale episode. War with Iran? Blood on our streets? Scorched earth policies like his role model, hitler?
1332073351263739904 2020-11-27 05:26:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  You like football?
1332066048934375426 2020-11-27 04:57:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Mine too!
1332063608063324161 2020-11-27 04:48:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @goldenluv10 She'll never lie to us, right? lol
1332062129084633089 2020-11-27 04:42:14 +0800 <JUthergi> No better time to keep this going until new doj begins work, starting top down investigations.
1332061498005458955 2020-11-27 04:39:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheUSASingers @Stoptheinsani20 Me too! But she'll always be a Russian handler for putin's assets.
1332059244137508864 2020-11-27 04:30:46 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mr Mazie! We all need to read the words of scotus members to see where our country is headed!
1332054727736127488 2020-11-27 04:12:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Unless your bucket list of places to visit is within the US borders, you might want to consider some changes! That guy squatting in the wh tried to ban so many peoples &amp; countries no one wants the ugly American anymore... gonna have to live vicariously through Clark Griswold!
1332053399400042508 2020-11-27 04:07:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it simion migolivitch, (sp?) russian oligarch living in trump tower nyc? Looks like that guy would seize that asset before our gov gets it!
1332052464321880064 2020-11-27 04:03:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Just do it! They better start collecting before the Russians do.
1332051856118456321 2020-11-27 04:01:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Ha! Start with ethics under enforceable penalty for violations and term limits. Otherwise you have lost the trust &amp; consent of WTP for generations to come...
1332050567489785856 2020-11-27 03:56:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Some governments understand their sworn duty to the people. Apparently an oath is merely semantics for the US elected elite?
1332049171721949190 2020-11-27 03:50:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @MSNBC_rocks_ Still betting they all dump on the youngest, of legal age, poor eric.  I say this bc if he was the smart one, he could have already turned &amp; gotten first &amp; likely the only immunity.
1332047296712806401 2020-11-27 03:43:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging to hope... with only a few fingernails until this nightmare is over!
1332047012347441159 2020-11-27 03:42:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Could ex flotus concede to avoid the embarrassment of another hate filled hideously decorated wh  Christmas?  Please Santa?
1332045736142385153 2020-11-27 03:37:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @TeresaM51981532 How can there innocence when the accused, under oath before a judge, admits guilt?  Never mind, for a minute there I imagined the impeached one term biggest electoral loser in the history of elections to be gone already. Sorry
1332044162133356549 2020-11-27 03:30:51 +0800 <JUthergi> All I heard from pence was how thankful he always was for the "great leadership" of trump in doing something or other while over 260k of us died...  Looks like this fine lady has already started school for politically disturbed?
1332042492221517824 2020-11-27 03:24:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Asking the same questions of our senate &amp; congress here across the pond! Misery loves company, so is it time yet for all people across this glorious earth to rethink the qualifications of the elected elite?
1332020530749304833 2020-11-27 01:56:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Ours too! But it still ain't over?
1332020325819817986 2020-11-27 01:56:08 +0800 <JUthergi> There has to be more to the story. He wouldn't just resign to get his kid a job with trump, right?
1332018874863194120 2020-11-27 01:50:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @MichaelArt123 It's not them sir. It's you.
1332017992935354369 2020-11-27 01:46:51 +0800 <JUthergi> No worries boys! i'm pretty sure ol mitch &amp; his boys have granted all vaccine mnfctrs immunity from liabilities &amp; prosecution if your drugs turn us all into vegetables, or just dead meat. Better keep up with the corp "donations" bc quid pro quo don't work without the dough $!!!
1332016175992221696 2020-11-27 01:39:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Historic reports show how the pilgrims were starving &amp; in danger of not surviving another winter. Indigenous people took pity on them, sharing &amp; teaching survival. Next spring some pilgrims committed atrocities against their hosts.   So set the path of relations...
1332012008779231235 2020-11-27 01:23:05 +0800 <JUthergi> As civic duty along with lessons on how to be good citizens have all but disappeared, please read this article and look into our futures. WTP must unify and teach our elected elite that they only have the right to govern BY OUR CONSENT! Does anyone really consent to what they do?
1332005823082598401 2020-11-27 00:58:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Wondering if that place is called the corner of the elected dc elites?  Do they get told to "go stand in that corner and you just think about what you've done, &amp; don't move untill I tell you!" Hope springs eternal, right?
1332004483463843844 2020-11-27 00:53:10 +0800 <JUthergi> He's just so... powerfully handsome?
1331982290788999170 2020-11-26 23:24:59 +0800 <JUthergi> May all white flags of surrender be known forever from this day as the trump flag of surrender!
1331976941864411141 2020-11-26 23:03:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheOnion @pamgriffa Can't drain the swamp with his exceptionally rubenesque behind plugging the drain...
1331976387981406215 2020-11-26 23:01:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Lie &amp;  admit guilt in behalf of nefarious gov activity, get a pardon? Try to save country from enemy attack risking all, get attacked by the gov you tried to save!  Free a real hero, not the self admitted criminal!
1331975217065975809 2020-11-26 22:56:53 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Reality Winner! Stay strong just a bit longer!
1331974458714755072 2020-11-26 22:53:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Journalistic integrity! Oxymoron of the day! Journalism surrendered to corp $ when the Fairness Doctrine was killed in 1987... Thanks again to the gop!
1331969936311382024 2020-11-26 22:35:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Brilliant strategy!   Maga should know how loafer &amp; chicken man betrayed the pres.  Boycott the vote magas! Show those two that they can't betray the pres &amp; be entitled to 0ffice!
1331966275413807113 2020-11-26 22:21:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @AaronBlake @BirdDinners Because trump can't spell it's likely the misspelling was intentional so as not to offend that guy squatting in the WH.
1331965707777609730 2020-11-26 22:19:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Van Langeveld for DOJ AG!  Thank you for the courage to do what no other gop members would do! We are that gov of laws!
1331747796244967425 2020-11-26 07:53:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Just think how much $ the private white collar resort "prison" could take in if they charged admission for people to visit, like a zoo?
1331747001059467264 2020-11-26 07:50:02 +0800 <JUthergi> yes I am embarrassed by my typis...really dislike this smart phone bc it really makes me look more stupid than my words tend to. More convenient than laptop though. Pardons again pls.
1331746256155271171 2020-11-26 07:47:04 +0800 <JUthergi> 3400 conflicts if interest!!! Remember the days when just 1 or 2 conflicts could sunk a politicians career?  Since no one in congress or sen stood against this, (except qpq impeachment), doesn't this mean that THEY'RE ALL COMPLICIT?
1331744860483837953 2020-11-26 07:41:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Are we upset that President Biden has the support of "citizens" for his picks? Gee, wait those supporters are "Corporate citizens" and they have more rights &amp; priveleges that us human Citizens!  Wow, thanks scotus for "citizens" united!  Same old tracks, just a new conductor?
1331679768346054657 2020-11-26 03:22:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @OANN @RudyWillingham Got one of a dumpster fire for that guy squatting in the WH?
1331679244213170177 2020-11-26 03:20:47 +0800 <JUthergi> How foolish I am, thinking an affidavit is merely a statement by an alleged witness. Only after cross examination and approval by judge it can be admitted as evidence. But what do I know, I just watch Perry Mason &amp; Matlock reruns?
1331676604255318016 2020-11-26 03:10:18 +0800 <JUthergi> This man has given a very good summary if where WTP are today. Please read and find just one family to help!
1331674159269769220 2020-11-26 03:00:35 +0800 <JUthergi> The kid your parents wouldn't let you play with...here is how he turned out!
1331671569266044934 2020-11-26 02:50:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump You worked so hard mr impeached one term greatest electoral loss in history president, you deserve to take a rest...
1331669560081195012 2020-11-26 02:42:19 +0800 <JUthergi> The first question i plan to ask my Creator when my time is up, how could so many buy what this salesman was selling?
1331600411309051909 2020-11-25 22:07:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @squirelskitchen @BFriedmanDC Born of the Patriot Act wondering if that was the plan as follow up to Citizen surveillance?
1331597583786061825 2020-11-25 21:56:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Inciting riots now are we?
1331241350679973894 2020-11-24 22:20:45 +0800 <JUthergi> The people's business? Wasn't that some political slogan from the 1800s? If the elected elite did the people's biz we would all have work homes healthcare &amp; food security. We would not have millionairess/billionaires that declaring themselves above the laws for self enrichment!
1331238439279337474 2020-11-24 22:09:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Ignoring the trump virus as a hoax didn't work.
1331237590079561731 2020-11-24 22:05:49 +0800 <JUthergi> JFK said the price of freedom is vigilance. WTP dropped that ball. Our freedoms can only be preserved by constant vigilance &amp; critical action to stomp out the trump disease that has ravaged our country.  We have to fight the trump virus too...
1331235317865701379 2020-11-24 21:56:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Co conspirators...
1331231318668095488 2020-11-24 21:40:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Last episode of the trump show could be the grand finale to end all grand finales...
1331229042037714944 2020-11-24 21:31:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @NiftieIndies @MaryLTrump Truly a dilemma for all. Cult worship is truly dangerous.

1331030030315646976 2020-11-24 08:21:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump  vanky dear, did you pay attention to where they planted those trees?  Your "leadership" apparently planted trees in a burn zone and we'll, I'm addition to 260k DEAD CITIZENS you are now responsible for 1t DEAD TREES?  Just brilliant!
1331028123421454336 2020-11-24 08:13:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Bring back the Fairness Doctrine. Reagan admin., lobbied by new media looking to get piece of US Market, rescinded doctrine, ca. 1987. No more opinions by people whose opinions are not respected talking about what someone else might be thinking!  Please @PresidentBiden ?
1331026778354315264 2020-11-24 08:08:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Greatest (grifting) generation?
1331025755543900161 2020-11-24 08:04:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @KellyannePolls  Why so silent sweetie? Any alternate facts to share?
1331025066071650312 2020-11-24 08:01:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Down to zero?
1331021341580009473 2020-11-24 07:46:31 +0800 <JUthergi> It's all he's got left. Maybe that's why he overruled nsa on jare &amp; vanky?
1331021002160168960 2020-11-24 07:45:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @lindaandherdogs On the security wall, outside the WH or on Mexican Border wall?  Joe's pub us looking for a new dart board though...

1330989760614182917 2020-11-24 05:41:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @NiftieIndies @MaryLTrump What then happens to rule of law if there are no consequences for breaking it? Hasn't our elected elite done enough damage to OUR REPUBLIC? 3 co equal branches. Legislative corrupted, admin corrupted, all hope now lies with the judicial...
1330988861950988288 2020-11-24 05:37:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Still clinging to hope...
1330988412493574146 2020-11-24 05:35:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @PinkLemAde1 @kikirusty @MaryLTrump Maybe daddy will blame all his ungrateful kids?
1330988022041600000 2020-11-24 05:34:07 +0800 <JUthergi> 4th &amp; goal! Clock is running out!  Rather than holding my breath any longer I'll just take bets on whether trump takes his ball &amp; goes home or will he fumble, adding to the bigliest losses by a team in the history of the world?
1330986384438538240 2020-11-24 05:27:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @RENEEWEATHERS2 @donwinslow @ikabas All the states that keep on paying to support this clowns welfare state...
1330984568158101504 2020-11-24 05:20:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @thorchrs trumpy bear can look foolish all by himself without anyone's help! In fact, he's the best!
1330983858708377605 2020-11-24 05:17:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps the dems like it this way? Gop gets today's blame, but game is same.   Sue the gop &amp; dem parties on behalf of WTP for the lousy candidates they continue to force upon us.  Wealthiest country on earth and 50 yrs of the elite is killing us by their incompetence...
1330981478709260290 2020-11-24 05:08:07 +0800 <JUthergi> That's how history has been written for eons. Did the masses ever have the means to manipulate the media if the day? Ever?
1330980704851800064 2020-11-24 05:05:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @donwinslow Betting that this corrupted good ol boy even has the enemies of the Union flag printed on his panties.  Bless yer l'il heart mitchie!
1330979738458972165 2020-11-24 05:01:12 +0800 <JUthergi> We should not be forced to give up our information to a government that has proven, time &amp; time again, that it cannot be trusted...said the people of the world!  We respect laws but trust is earned &amp; seriously, can anyone anywhere say they wholeheartedly trust their governments?
1330954516825575425 2020-11-24 03:20:59 +0800 <JUthergi> What happen to the sen turkeys from KY &amp; SC?
1330949557061038082 2020-11-24 03:01:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Funny, huh?
1330948769228201984 2020-11-24 02:58:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow, just another example that trump had been planning his coup d'etat all along. Why did he not pick carrots? Something to do with wanting to be the only orange in wh?
1330947313792143362 2020-11-24 02:52:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Send more ppe?
1330946813277458432 2020-11-24 02:50:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @dean_kimball @alexsalvinews ? If you request a web site is have to refer you to congressional record. I watched cspan testimony in Jan 2020. It was the ceo. as an eng.  could you agree that such things are possible? It is that possiblity wherein the danger lies.
1330945256850927616 2020-11-24 02:44:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @KellyLoeffler
1330944922044784640 2020-11-24 02:42:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @WarriorWoman23 @Stoptheinsani20 An ideal corrupted by the hubris &amp; greed of men like mc con All, graham, collins, kennedy gaetz cruz rubio + 42 &amp; 50 corporate dems. But a new day is dawning, new ideas are nurtured &amp; the corrupted old guard will be defeated...
1330943553896374275 2020-11-24 02:37:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @dean_kimball @alexsalvinews Sir, I do appreciate your insights but i watched the testimony, he admitted back doors as well as ability to manipulate votes.  i've enjoyed many discussions with S Eng.s, IT pros and one of the foremost election law experts in the country.   Conclusion = paper ballots forever!
1330896554035646468 2020-11-23 23:30:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Could today be a good day for invoking the 25th Ammendment? please?
1330892356808306688 2020-11-23 23:13:59 +0800 <JUthergi> It must be done!
1330888514213437440 2020-11-23 22:58:43 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's grand finale, Iran?
1330887611985113099 2020-11-23 22:55:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Prosecution is necessary to preserve the rule of law.
1330885404619382787 2020-11-23 22:46:21 +0800 <JUthergi> The psychological damage that must have been done, being told you're not beautiful and forced to have so many surgeries to correct genetics, this could only create a very unstable &amp; angry person.  All for approval of a father figure? #MeToo should still attempt rescue...
1330878105100185602 2020-11-23 22:17:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @dean_kimball @alexsalvinews Ty for the insight. While I want to trust the FEC, S of S, local EC it seems like team trump tried to exploit the same back doors the designer of system admitted to providing, in testimony before congress. If man can create something, other men can it exploit it. Esp. computers.
1330525940229804033 2020-11-22 22:57:58 +0800 <JUthergi> But she has such a catchy slogan...harassment politics &amp; rage!
1330524258003464192 2020-11-22 22:51:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Always follow the $
1330521149432795138 2020-11-22 22:38:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @H_MitchellPhoto @mariarhernande2 Bet the dealer gets a gov grant for financial losses incurred due to the hoax?
1330520861825232903 2020-11-22 22:37:47 +0800 <JUthergi> jr caught the hoax? Was wondering why he was so quiet, for a change.
1330516504350240768 2020-11-22 22:20:29 +0800 <JUthergi> trumpatized &amp;  suffering ptsd...
1330515053439758338 2020-11-22 22:14:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @alexsalvinews Listening to this person it is difficult to NOT conclude that the software was used in battleground / red states specifically for the algorithm described. She described trump's stated pov in terms of what the software could do, so why not use it to rig elections as he promised?
1330510440783376391 2020-11-22 21:56:23 +0800 <JUthergi> He did win recently by beating Sen Romney for the greatest defeat in the history of elections! He wins as the worst leader in the history of the world! He wins as the leader who killed more of his Citizens than any other dictator in the history of the world! Goals accomplished!?
1330507351590391814 2020-11-22 21:44:06 +0800 <JUthergi> GA can save our country, vote to defeat gop!
1330506818611798016 2020-11-22 21:41:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Wow! They must be giving you some outstanding feel good drugs! By any chance do you wear rose colored contacts?
1330505211786518530 2020-11-22 21:35:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Yet those sworn to protect us, (house/senate), that choose not to, is even more terrifying!
1330503645016756224 2020-11-22 21:29:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @OANN @ChanelRion @realDonaldTrump  Is that like trumpitizing where you traumatized the families of over 260k DEAD AMERICAN CITIZENS?
1330502611607441409 2020-11-22 21:25:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Blessings!
1330499185796390912 2020-11-22 21:11:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! You win again! So much winning you now beat Romney for the title of having the greatest defeat in the history of politics!
1330299518806536192 2020-11-22 07:58:15 +0800 <JUthergi> He still angry he didn't get the nomination in 2012? He should be happy he finally got there after all his previous attempts.
1330297588998922242 2020-11-22 07:50:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @katgal2 @Cubfan13241 @NewJeffCT @Bullsranch99 @katierogers @gtconway3d Without knowing any facts, i just couldn't help but to think here's this tv producer looking to boost ratings, wakes up mid of night with this genius of a plan. "They'll be sorry now" as he hoped for sympathy.   Now just worried about his gran finale show!
1330296202592718854 2020-11-22 07:45:05 +0800 <JUthergi> It felt very reassuring to be united in our pledge. We were a part of something good...
1330295371067756548 2020-11-22 07:41:46 +0800 <JUthergi> So true... Of course, trump makes  Arnold look like a choir boy... We have a new most dangerous person in history.
1330294509595398152 2020-11-22 07:38:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Change the locks!
1330293438118498304 2020-11-22 07:34:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Recruited
1330291721578700800 2020-11-22 07:27:16 +0800 <JUthergi> He surrendered. The self proclaimed war time president who knows lots more than the Generals just quit, just surrendered.  Wondering what  supporters of trump thing of his royal wimpiness. White flags anyone?
1330290171699453963 2020-11-22 07:21:07 +0800 <JUthergi> There appears to be no end in sight, trump virus rages on!
1330282924239892483 2020-11-22 06:52:19 +0800 <JUthergi> The guy who rec'd $50k "campaign contribution" from trump's atty after dropping charges against vanky &amp; jr?  Great, just great! Guessing no jail time for trump cartel...
1330281266848075781 2020-11-22 06:45:44 +0800 <JUthergi> At least move up start date for Pres Elect to Jan 6 the date house/sen certify elections. Legal start date. Be great if President Biden just walked in &amp; the impeached one term ex pres that lost so bigly gets escorted out.
1330263082736754690 2020-11-22 05:33:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Now he's talking about himself in 3rd person?  Is the breakdown that breaks us?
1330261619180511234 2020-11-22 05:27:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't SOMEONE do SOMETHING to save OUR REPUBLIC???
1330261175783858179 2020-11-22 05:25:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump How about a "which of these is not like the others, which does not beling" pic?  Numbers are so confusing...
1330260534768381952 2020-11-22 05:23:21 +0800 <JUthergi> mc con all can only be this corrupted by the years of his youth getting picked on &amp; bullied.  Then he joined the service to toughen up but was quietly discharged for eye irritation, to distract from inappropriate behaviors before don't ask don't tell policy.  He seeks vengeance!
1330249734217457668 2020-11-22 04:40:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Hope so bc our elected elite are still shaking in their boots...may history judge them even more harshly.
1329872281103896583 2020-11-21 03:40:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @atrupar Clinging to hope, to hear that one day nobody will ever ask, where is that ghouliani guy?
1329871322793582594 2020-11-21 03:36:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @atrupar Thought this presser was actually a SNL clip, only not as funny!
1329870970518204418 2020-11-21 03:35:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Was he offended by his own incompetence?
1329870043396644865 2020-11-21 03:31:40 +0800 <JUthergi> It looks more like the vp that works for WTP is the one showing the disrespect &amp; entitlement, thinking he's not responsible to WTP for helping to kill over 250k humans!
1329868952546250753 2020-11-21 03:27:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @wcbuecker @pamgriffa Did they count too fast?
1329868608709795844 2020-11-21 03:25:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump "Politics publicity &amp; rage", is this your new 2024 campaign slogan?   It sure seems to match that endearing personality of yours!  Btw your complaining reminded me to ask how that flatulence problem worked out? You're not still blaming the person next to you are you?
1329867848127229952 2020-11-21 03:22:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget hyper inflating the values if condos for buyers then claiming major devaluation to fool the banks &amp; IRS!
1329866455714832389 2020-11-21 03:17:25 +0800 <JUthergi> But the virus is already named after him! His name is everywhere and it is killing us!
1329863931188416512 2020-11-21 03:07:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems designed to assist developers in absorbing up entire neighborhoods for redevelopment?  Forced relocations, Trail of Tears initiative ring a bell?
1329863169746022400 2020-11-21 03:04:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @SophiaSoliloquy Stochastic terrorist?
1329862937075474432 2020-11-21 03:03:26 +0800 <JUthergi> If by "resist" you mean leave write a book &amp; then tweet about resisting, ok. Gee, thanks.
1329861915439460354 2020-11-21 02:59:22 +0800 <JUthergi> He must have very important orders from our wannabe dictator to undertake the risk of death...  Step by step...
1329859355072720896 2020-11-21 02:49:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Today it's Germany.  Will trump unleash this upon WTP tomorrow?  Will we have the fully armed US Army in our streets &amp; at our doors "offering" vaccines for "our own good"?
1329857809475915777 2020-11-21 02:43:03 +0800 <JUthergi> This insight may just be a day late &amp; a dollar short? A LOT of damage has been done...
1329856896698814467 2020-11-21 02:39:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Sorry but I prefer my doctor over some young teenage warrior with a gun. Call me crazy!
1329856414681092100 2020-11-21 02:37:31 +0800 <JUthergi> NYC all over again? Is trump pretending now to be his sister to make him look good?  Lol
1329854590624428032 2020-11-21 02:30:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @RexChapman Elite strike force legal team? Wait us this clip from SNL?
1329853865756413952 2020-11-21 02:27:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump  "Times of discomfort &amp; uncertainty", were you referring to that time in high school where your flatulence was out of control and you blamed the quiet girl next to you? Or was it the time in daddy's elevator with the Russian "biz man" setting up shop? Tough times!!!
1329852290480664579 2020-11-21 02:21:08 +0800 <JUthergi> That makes trump bigliest loser ever in the history of the world!
1329849125320478720 2020-11-21 02:08:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems it has been moscow mitchie's plan all along.
1329848823183781890 2020-11-21 02:07:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Wondering if it's time yet to get under a table bend over with head between my knees &amp; try to kiss my behind good bye???
1329846608155062273 2020-11-21 01:58:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet? Today is good, before trumpy bear gets too grizzly.
1329846017416716297 2020-11-21 01:56:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @CHueyBurns @dazyjane410 It has also been reported that trump demanded that everyone refer to him as "mr president" the very next morning after elections. Ego therefore he is...
1329821385116553219 2020-11-21 00:18:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @itsJeffTiedrich That and trump didn't have anything to do with the vaccines. He let the virus in, did nothing but try to profit by buying hydrox chlor, remdsvr &amp; ppe.  It's his virus and may it be forever remembered as the trump virus!
1329820278248103936 2020-11-21 00:13:55 +0800 <JUthergi> the trump virus continues to kill...
1329819663161757696 2020-11-21 00:11:29 +0800 <JUthergi> The narrative should include trump's personal investments in hydroxy chloroquine, remdesivir &amp; ppe stock.  When he realized the dangers in Jan he moved to make personal profits hoping for shortages if these products. Those are just his salespeople attacking you.
1329817807572393986 2020-11-21 00:04:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Her defense? But daddy said I could &amp; he's the president...
1329816785328201729 2020-11-21 00:00:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Tucker didn't listen when rudy gave him his insights as to truth of facts?
1329816087136002049 2020-11-20 23:57:16 +0800 <JUthergi> He bought so much now he's trying anything to get rid of it!
1329815549275238402 2020-11-20 23:55:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @tenntuxx @docrussjackson It kind of looks like my brain after listening to msm
1329815326062751747 2020-11-20 23:54:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @tenntuxx @docrussjackson Beneath the fragile of our ego, we are all the same...
1329814731234955264 2020-11-20 23:51:53 +0800 <JUthergi> TY that just made my day!
1329814498006491140 2020-11-20 23:50:57 +0800 <JUthergi> The Conald! Best nickname yet!!! Can we use this in our trolling efforts?
1329813623104004096 2020-11-20 23:47:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Sheesh, you make it sound like Germany just before hitler secured his SS. Oh, right this is just like Germany where so many doubted and thought this could never happen here!
1329812783127523333 2020-11-20 23:44:08 +0800 <JUthergi> How very trumpian of him...
1329812512271978496 2020-11-20 23:43:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Bring back The Fairness Doctrine!
1329810573752750081 2020-11-20 23:35:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Think how much money could be raised for the swear jar though if the trump name replaced swear words. Just stepped in dog trump? Go trump yourself! trump you! That's such bulltrump! Wow, you just got royally trumped!
1329807447704416259 2020-11-20 23:22:56 +0800 <JUthergi> That's the plan man. Thought dershowitz was still on epstein island?
1329802504524214273 2020-11-20 23:03:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1329801304600944643 2020-11-20 22:58:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Nobody ever listens...
1329790632626360324 2020-11-20 22:16:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Is there even anyone still in the cabinet that could write the letter for effecting the 25th Ammendment? Did they just quit?  Are they that afraid of the wrath of trump? How could they not want to remove trump fro office, our lives???
1329789746760065024 2020-11-20 22:12:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Selling USA by the pound...
1329788345300480008 2020-11-20 22:07:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Still clinging to hope!
1329784247771607040 2020-11-20 21:50:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are mc con all &amp; graham crackers, alleged leaders in the gop so silent? What are they guilty of?
1329779377534623745 2020-11-20 21:31:24 +0800 <JUthergi> What i find so incomprehensible is how this guy thinks his sister should have any relevance to his antics?
1329778192324947968 2020-11-20 21:26:41 +0800 <JUthergi> How about today? Today would be just perfect to effect the 25th Ammendment! No time like the present!
1329775258996514817 2020-11-20 21:15:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step Closer &amp; closer  Please make today 25th Ammendment Day! Today is a good day!  https://t.co/lonhFIzNNU
1329571353045987329 2020-11-20 07:44:47 +0800 <JUthergi> You guys still there? Seriously now, after all you have claimed since this started you want us to believe you now???
1329569420520398849 2020-11-20 07:37:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Imagine if we could unite as consumers to boycott "corp citizens" for bad behavior like we did to fire trump? Remember when businesses helped to upgrade playgrounds, ball fields, sponsor community events, etc.? WTP could force good corporate citizenship,( I know, oxymoron), wi $!
1329567437877092355 2020-11-20 07:29:14 +0800 <JUthergi> It specifically states the use of "force' to effect the crime.  His past use of force in states may not qualify...
1329566552732168194 2020-11-20 07:25:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @bradheath That is the goal!
1329566362218475521 2020-11-20 07:24:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Election interference.
1329565687317192710 2020-11-20 07:22:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @OBXJEN @jtcinct @martyargyle1 @ReportsDaNews Better for the whole country, the world &amp; the ever expanding universe for all time!  Investigate mitch!
1329564519732039685 2020-11-20 07:17:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Who wants to spend Thanksgiving at mitch or lindsie's?  We could all dress like the walking dead!  Never mind, they would most likely enjoy our suffering better if we're up close.
1329563791156260866 2020-11-20 07:14:44 +0800 <JUthergi> But he's given so much comfort &amp; aid to our enemies we should charge treason!   Doesn't sedition require taking gov property by force?  Better punishments under treason...
1329562530252001280 2020-11-20 07:09:43 +0800 <JUthergi> If the leaders refuse to meet the wannabe dictator &amp; he arrest then BY FORCE will he then be guilty of sedition?  Btw WHEN IS 25th Ammendment Day?
1329560198952972290 2020-11-20 07:00:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Just the way mitch planned it...
1329559962251628549 2020-11-20 06:59:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Get trump in jail &amp; we'll start a go fund me to give you a bonus!!!   PS gov gives raises by law? Does that apply to WTP?
1329559138284744705 2020-11-20 06:56:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @Amy_Siskind @Stoptheinsani20 Thinking that moscow's mitch should be top of the list?
1329558926996746246 2020-11-20 06:55:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Good for today but what about on 12/12?
1329557744563654665 2020-11-20 06:50:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @SenSanders Is the senate still refusing help to WTP until mitch gets his C19 liability waivers for his "corporate citizens"?  Is that why you guys are on ANOTHER PAID VACATION, AGAIN???  We do not consent &amp; y'all need to get to work!
1329556522897174528 2020-11-20 06:45:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't trump just do the same thing to MI? Why do our law enforcers only enforce laws on WTP? Did mc con All make the elite above these laws too?
1329510140819746821 2020-11-20 03:41:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @fknfedup @ReportsDaNews Wow! Doesn't this guy have any family to help him?
1329509695065911296 2020-11-20 03:39:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...getting closer!
1329508655683817476 2020-11-20 03:35:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @donlemon @oprman apparently trumpy bear don't share. he's laughing at ghouliani bc his makeup runs &amp; trumpy bear's doesn't!
1329505009155923971 2020-11-20 03:21:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be getting close to investigating mc cons All bc he is calling for vacation today. Guess he quit along wi trump? Our marie antoinette in pants won't even offer WTP cake? Maybe he's upset he's not one of the turkeys to be pardoned for Thanksgiving?
1329502195914592257 2020-11-20 03:09:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Only embarrassed?
1329500204916203520 2020-11-20 03:02:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Arrest warrants yet?
1329468192218083328 2020-11-20 00:54:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Guys? Please do one on mc cons all? He is so good at lurking in the shadows, people need to see the puppeteer in action.
1329466106445246464 2020-11-20 00:46:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't that the trump mc con All goal, to end our democratic Republic?
1329463980121874433 2020-11-20 00:38:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @sarahmccammon @IndivisibleMich But, IT IS HAPPENING!
1329462756706291715 2020-11-20 00:33:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @slak909 @NoahShachtman @ChrisCoons @SenatorLankford There's a senate ethics committee? C'mon really? This is a submission for oxymoron of the day, right? Senate ethics...lol
1329459488596877320 2020-11-20 00:20:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Is the trump virus turning into the trump holocaust?
1329458665380859904 2020-11-20 00:17:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Still no call for a moment of silence &amp; prayers for over 250k DEAD AMERICAN CITIZENS? Apparently our elected elite just don't care about WTP? Did they ever really care?
1329456924342030337 2020-11-20 00:10:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Ain't gonna happen, he's too busy orchestrating the coup d'etat!
1329455969131241479 2020-11-20 00:06:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is there no pressure on cabinet to effect 25th Ammendment???
1329448808225402886 2020-11-19 23:37:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @OBXJEN @ReportsDaNews @gigiwarriorgirl He thinks only of himself. WTP are expendable...
1329447239064883202 2020-11-19 23:31:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @Freehandguy @SpeakerPelosi Shouldn't we sweep our own house first? We separated children from their parents, killed over 250k of our citizens &amp; we call out the Chinese? What is she distracting us from knowing?
1329446022901325831 2020-11-19 23:26:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... Seems trump &amp; mc con All are closer to their goal than WTP are to ours...
1329443385929773059 2020-11-19 23:16:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Like in Greece &amp; Rome our congress/senate men have had scandalous sexually abusive activity for decades...
1329440666326327297 2020-11-19 23:05:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @mmpadellan It ain't over yet. It gets uglier...
1329440068382167043 2020-11-19 23:03:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like someone we all know...
1329439092225007629 2020-11-19 22:59:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Negligent or premeditated &amp; intentional?
1329436621691875328 2020-11-19 22:49:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...  Too many gop followers believe in autocratic rule. all re programmed &amp; trained over the years by moscow mitch mc con all.
1329434515115274248 2020-11-19 22:41:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @pamgriffa Bannon may only be following mc con All orders. Strategic evil genius mc con All pulling the strings of our stable genius to stay in power.  The ride ain't over yet...
1329433522239631365 2020-11-19 22:37:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Great article! Authors insights confirm trump lawsuits are the distraction. EC manipulations &amp; SCOTUS intimations encourage a coup d'etat.
1329427342427615235 2020-11-19 22:12:32 +0800 <JUthergi> While trump family gathers national secrets to sell, whistleblower heroes like Ms Reality Winner rot in jail. Topple the trumps!
1329426124980563971 2020-11-19 22:07:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @JassicaSunday1 Couldn't agree with you more. My issue is with hierarchical elite offering platitudes to the truly good samaritan sacrificing all to help others. Why tweet when a leader could call direct,(facetime, zoom, etc), to encourage those heroes wi/out self  recognition? Resources 1st?
1329210653278687234 2020-11-19 07:51:29 +0800 <JUthergi> You admitted that theres no help for WTP unless you got liability waivers for your corp donors if employees are killed by C19 while at work! What have you done to OSHA? Why are you trying to destroy this country, someone hurt your feelings too?  Is it bc we know about army days?
1329207585136926722 2020-11-19 07:39:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Where are the investigators???
1329207030385610753 2020-11-19 07:37:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... Fasten your seatbelts !
1329206327873331201 2020-11-19 07:34:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @donwinslow @Yahoo Cynically speaking i find his antics rather entertaining, but then I realize it's not SNL &amp; I get truly unsettled.
1329205831141875715 2020-11-19 07:32:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Days he "would" but that's just Doublespeak. He's the guy that says we could take his word until he changes his word.  Investigate this thing
1329205159600267264 2020-11-19 07:29:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Poster girl for Murphy's Law?
1329201965209968641 2020-11-19 07:16:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @fuckcancer56 @Cubfan13241 WTP are &amp; have been in our own for many many years now!  Take care of each other
1329201333400952834 2020-11-19 07:14:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Well vanky, we all know how important it is to you to build hotels in moscow &amp; turkey.  Getting rid of our troops as a condition to feed your greed is such a small price to pay.  Just think, wi only 5k troops left how easy it will be for al qaeda to collect bounties!
1329191809956925440 2020-11-19 06:36:37 +0800 <JUthergi> It's pretty frustrating that this is not common knowledge...
1329190202187915274 2020-11-19 06:30:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Does this mean he won't pardon two dc turkeys as is a time honored tradition?  Looks like mitch &amp; lil lindsie are in big trouble now!   Better run boys!
1329188922568679425 2020-11-19 06:25:08 +0800 <JUthergi> WTAF
1329188597954727939 2020-11-19 06:23:51 +0800 <JUthergi> trump can read. He obviously read the entirety of Hitler's book he used to keep locked in his nightstand decades ago...
1329188077810675712 2020-11-19 06:21:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Update: Murphy's Law Whatever one can do to obstruct hoping for approval by a wannabe dictator.
1329180791373488129 2020-11-19 05:52:50 +0800 <JUthergi> ... and each enabling traitor to OUR REPUBLIC!
1329120446550302723 2020-11-19 01:53:02 +0800 <JUthergi> It's not today? Bummer.
1329120202282446859 2020-11-19 01:52:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper They invoked the 25th Ammendment?
1329120028315291649 2020-11-19 01:51:23 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mrs Kendzior! Is today 25th Ammendment Day?
1329119003885916162 2020-11-19 01:47:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Just saw you posted again that you won the election! That's absolutely impossible bc I voted for myself &amp; I WON THE ELECTION!  Just like you did upon becoming pres elect in '16, i now DEMAND TO BE CALLED MR PRESIDENT until further notice!
1329116072365199360 2020-11-19 01:35:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Sure you did. How could it be otherwise? No one would dare to vote against you dear leader! Just because you are the only one in the whole country,(along with people pd to agree), making this claim it doesn't mean you're crazy...  Everybody else is?
1329113266744942597 2020-11-19 01:24:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @thorchrs Break the fragile shell of our egos &amp; we're all the same?
1329112414374277123 2020-11-19 01:21:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1329093741550981124 2020-11-19 00:06:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Gop are the masters of Orwellian Doublespeak
1329086878583144459 2020-11-18 23:39:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Truly relieved to hear others see what I've feared. i may still be a lunatic but not on the fringe.  The danger is not over!  Truly fearful that the defication is about to hit the rotary oscillator and it will be more than ugly!  When oh when will it be 25th Ammendment Day?
1329082944921583623 2020-11-18 23:24:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it today? It must be today right? Happy 25th Amme What? Still not one cabinet member brave enough to draft the letter? What the hell are y'all thinking? Coup da what? What are you plotting now???
1329081711443939335 2020-11-18 23:19:07 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and he's about to go postal!
1329081432011022338 2020-11-18 23:18:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @Farmerkelly @MilesTaylorUSA @realDonaldTrump Except maybe a coup d'etat? He has dismantled and replaced those who could stop him...
1329080595113156618 2020-11-18 23:14:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step
1329079561754079233 2020-11-18 23:10:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! Appointing a person that loves &amp; respects the land instead of another dc politician that wants to rape the land? What a novel idea! Common sense &amp; logic, there is hope for us yet!
1329076522343251971 2020-11-18 22:58:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like KY &amp;  SC were given vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines?  Is this why mc con all &amp; lil lindsie are in hiding &amp; not leading us forward?
1329075281613647874 2020-11-18 22:53:34 +0800 <JUthergi> We need to unite in this war against the trump virus. We can &amp; we must protect ourselves!  it IS NOT a hoax that will miraculously disappear and gov does not have it under control as claimed!
1328839897201963009 2020-11-18 07:18:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't let go sir!
1328837690800877575 2020-11-18 07:09:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Good thing this is in pictures! We have a lot of folks that don't read...
1328837332800245762 2020-11-18 07:08:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @Robertson4TX03 @katheyjberry Totally agree and we should all be praying for their safety! But if trump doesn't surrender our troops putin &amp; erdogan won't let him have more  hotels in turkey &amp; moscow. Transactional pres needs $$$!
1328834991330095106 2020-11-18 06:58:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Are you surprised? WTP are our last &amp; best support for each other, be safe.
1328834393541144585 2020-11-18 06:56:22 +0800 <JUthergi> 1933?
1328834085918269445 2020-11-18 06:55:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Survivors of Battle of Kamdesh may disagree lil lindsie, you #*¥✓×∆!
1328833474468392964 2020-11-18 06:52:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Remember when we only worried about high crimes &amp; misdemeanors?  Now it's who is dismantling OUR REPUBLIC or who committed treason or who conspired to take dirty money to rig elections? Good old days, right?
1328832317054398464 2020-11-18 06:48:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Good reason for structural rehab... If only the elite could be prohibited from voting on any issue until 661/3% of constituents respond w/ yes or no on issue. Voting against people = auto dismissal for term. If they won't listen, we do not consent. Tech is avail but they'll fight
1328830741795495943 2020-11-18 06:41:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Most western nation's do this.
1328830242421608450 2020-11-18 06:39:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Well at least mc con All didn't give the senate another raise, or did he?
1328829483961479169 2020-11-18 06:36:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @titsymcgitsy Logical, but not likely. He's angry &amp; plotting revenge on all he feels that betrayed him. Same feeling when you scold your dog, he disappears for a bit &amp; returns with your wife's new chewed up shoes! Dog loves it bc the hubbie now sleeps in the garage...like this guy did!  https://t.co/56wNojRjR8
1328827705664663554 2020-11-18 06:29:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Star wars technology? Remembering when first spoken of it was described as trying to shoot a bullet in outer space with another bullet! TY for your expertise &amp; professionalism!  Almost feels like Christmas!
1328814222940262403 2020-11-18 05:36:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Did mitch just say "make me. I dare you!" ???
1328813457169375233 2020-11-18 05:33:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Will we have to modify the Christmas Stories to help kids understand 2020? The trumps who stole Christmas might be scarier than the grinch story.  whatever are we to do? Why won't they leave?
1328811566024847360 2020-11-18 05:25:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Only two witnesses needed for treasonous acts to be prosecuted
1328809883823710218 2020-11-18 05:18:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Would that be treasonous?
1328809620584996865 2020-11-18 05:17:56 +0800 <JUthergi> And WTP pay the bills. Does anybody see the big picture yet?
1328809145345191940 2020-11-18 05:16:02 +0800 <JUthergi> We never were...sigh
1328809019738378242 2020-11-18 05:15:33 +0800 <JUthergi> They had to pay for  graham crackers &amp; mc con All their election rigging, right?
1328808502832336897 2020-11-18 05:13:29 +0800 <JUthergi> 1st American self proclaimed "war time president" to surrender BEFORE the first deaths! Another bigly win for the trump legacy!
1328807269258158082 2020-11-18 05:08:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @DarleenWilkin11 @NDIRISH1964 @AriFleischer It was trump that defined his EC win as a landslide, how are the same EC counts for his opponent not a landslide? Can't change the rules bc of losing, right?
1328804964844625929 2020-11-18 04:59:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @mkraju @cooperchip1 He must have quit knowing he would be fired. Anyone see melanomas white flag?
1328804374873825282 2020-11-18 04:57:05 +0800 <JUthergi> That's the trumpy bear setting records all the time. Bigly historical?
1328803828221829120 2020-11-18 04:54:55 +0800 <JUthergi> It doesn't seem like they'll turn on their own, waiting for thoughts &amp; prayers for lil lindsie.
1328800479506288642 2020-11-18 04:41:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @LindseyGrahamSC But better for you doesn't count lil lindsie! Bless that lil heart. Remember that you're sworn to make it better for WTP? What? No we will not give you more money!
1328799039584952322 2020-11-18 04:35:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA But sir, mitch &amp; lil lindsie betrayed you not GA.   Remember when mitch &amp; lindsie guaranteed your win? They rigged elections only for themselves.   You could have won if not for those two traitors! Don't let them get away wi it, send in the barr hit squad!!!
1328797466561572866 2020-11-18 04:29:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently trump was right about election rigging. Too bad mitch pulled a switch and instead of his guarantee to trump he would win, he only allowed himself &amp; his pet graham crackers to win! Investigate rigging in KY &amp; SC!
1328796496486129665 2020-11-18 04:25:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Is she crushing on the trumpy bear?
1328796192109711362 2020-11-18 04:24:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @TimmyB67 @AntarianRani @JoeNBC mitch must have changed the law for gop as so many appear to be interfering! If the one term impeached ex president  does nothing isn't he at least aiding &amp; abetting fed crimes?  Is there such a thing as the 25th Ammendment anymore?
1328795203155746816 2020-11-18 04:20:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Did trump start a war with Iran yet? He is too damn quiet!
1328779152330280963 2020-11-18 03:16:52 +0800 <JUthergi> There but for the grace of our Creator go we all...
1328723049886208001 2020-11-17 23:33:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Two or more discussing a crime is conspiracy to commit such crime, so when does get charged &amp; cuffed?
1328722336376369152 2020-11-17 23:31:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheUSASingers @hanOlie Date night?
1328721361083260930 2020-11-17 23:27:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Not in SC, they did the ol step n fetch it for massa graham crackers! This good ol boy of the south thinks slavery was a great biz model. Is he still friends with thurmond &amp; wallace groups?
1328720174384603138 2020-11-17 23:22:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @girl_gardenia @seanhannity This guy is trying anything to get back on trump's good side after betraying trump. Louie d is gonna be trump's man @ trump's new tv empire for the criminally insane &amp; hammhead is jealous.
1328719409507078146 2020-11-17 23:19:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Iran is still a shiny object in the eyes of our one term impeached ex pres!
1328712040593186816 2020-11-17 22:50:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Ban trump from our lives!
1328710758511878145 2020-11-17 22:45:05 +0800 <JUthergi> The fires may be put down but the decay of the integrity &amp; ideals we hold dear runs rampant throughout gov.
1328709031310090243 2020-11-17 22:38:13 +0800 <JUthergi> How could graham NOT be involved here?
1328707989256220673 2020-11-17 22:34:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Most despicable moment... Investigate!
1328703007752658946 2020-11-17 22:14:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they fire the Park Service? Trump declared hundreds of thousands &amp; mc Enemy what promised she would never lie said 1m attended. So confused...
1328701496435814405 2020-11-17 22:08:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @donellefranklin Wasn't graham the lead character in the dc page boy scandals many yrs ago?
1328695489819267077 2020-11-17 21:44:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Take the pardon lil lindsey, have some fun before your other crimes catch up to you!
1328694803417227265 2020-11-17 21:41:41 +0800 <JUthergi> GA ask yourself, is corporate freedom from liability over your dying from C19 at work what you want? That's what mitch wants. Our deaths are insignificant where corporate donors are concerned...
1328506470758019073 2020-11-17 09:13:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Has that ever stopped trump. He needs a grand finale before he leaves and Iran could still be in his head!
1328505962538340352 2020-11-17 09:11:18 +0800 <JUthergi> So have the arrest warrants been issued?
1328505486258417665 2020-11-17 09:09:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @funkytowntx @stphnfwlr Clinging to hope...
1328504619262152704 2020-11-17 09:05:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Tomorrow? Is tomorrow 25th Ammendment Day? I'm sooo excited I'll never get to sleep!
1328503844796592129 2020-11-17 09:02:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe we should just start here? Love it!
1328502400206958592 2020-11-17 08:57:09 +0800 <JUthergi> So when does he get charged with federal election tampering? Look a little deeper &amp; treason may be another viable option...
1328500841205157889 2020-11-17 08:50:57 +0800 <JUthergi> If the official certification of President Biden's victory by The House is complete on Jan 6th 2021 why can't they take over then?  Inauguration has always been symbolic only, right?  Let the new Admin begin 1.6.21!!!
1328499693077323778 2020-11-17 08:46:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe the new Admin will hang them for all to see? Wondering if any dart leagues would bid on them if the $ went to the kids cancer charity the trump family stole from up in NY?
1328499036521951233 2020-11-17 08:43:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't we somehow remove officials that buy their way into office? We can't out vote CU $  Oh, right. We probably wouldn't have any one in office for longer than 2 terms.  Now there's an idea worth looking into... TERM LIMITS everywhere &amp; forever!
1328497783469387776 2020-11-17 08:38:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump mr one term impeached ex president? Would it really have been to difficult for you to be more like this Leader?  Thank you President Biden! Lead by example!
1328495245273731072 2020-11-17 08:28:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Trump selling America piece by piece. The world is about to see the damage a malignant narcissist scorned can bring!
1328494492664688640 2020-11-17 08:25:43 +0800 <JUthergi> So glad to hear. What possible purpose could he have besides gathering support for trump? The world wants nothing to do with us while trump is around.
1328492450537730048 2020-11-17 08:17:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he win? Did he win the 25th Ammendment award?  It's today? Today is 25th Ammendment Day!  Oh, happy happy joy joy!  WHAAAT? still not one of his cabinet found the courage to draft a simple letter?  did trump yell at them again so they would  help him plan a coup d'etat? darn
1328488856744849408 2020-11-17 08:03:20 +0800 <JUthergi> trump knew was coming. trump knew how dangerous it truly was. trump China ban was a joke &amp; it never occurred to him it was coming from EU until too late. Can we please call it what it is? trump virus, so history will remember...
1328486718710943746 2020-11-17 07:54:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are mitch &amp; lil lindsie still in hiding? Investigations underway?
1328486062138777601 2020-11-17 07:52:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @jilevin Not a bad idea. We could try them all in abstentia for their crimes against humanity, financial crimes govt obstruction etc. Once convicted, seize properties issue international warrants through interpol wi $ bounty &amp; the whole world will chase them down!!!  press is out of way!
1328482840561020928 2020-11-17 07:39:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @ptv1024 Driving that train, high on cocaine? donnie trump better watch your speed!
1328481198176395269 2020-11-17 07:32:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Kindness doesn't kill
1328394737183764480 2020-11-17 01:49:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @AmbroseAdam @Mikel_Jollett Maybe if the trump clan didn't start the whole elementary school name calling behavior the public would not have responded.  Think of how many parents had to tell their children "just bc the orange man said it does not mean you can say it!" "Now go to your room!"
1328392881086853121 2020-11-17 01:41:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @ElkeHollings @AntarianRani @mehdirhasan @BasherRedux With de-escalation training &amp; discipline...
1328391791507349507 2020-11-17 01:37:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @Advancedape2E Perhaps i'm officially lunatic fringe? Thespian trump is also a malignant narcissist planning the bigliest of grand finales! Step by step the dismantling of OUR REPUBLIC occured before our eyes. No one noticed?   War wi Iran or blood on our streets wi his coup d'etat?
1328385464424951808 2020-11-17 01:12:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Courage is not in the official lexicon of the house or senate, right?  Yeah that's it, that's the ticket to hide their cowardice!
1328384642425221120 2020-11-17 01:09:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Again?
1328384423511863296 2020-11-17 01:08:21 +0800 <JUthergi> ms mc Enemy, you said you would NEVER lie to us!  Yet, here you go again!  Everyone knows that a malignant narcissist is incapable of empathy especially if that one is responsible for the 2nd most horrible genocide ever orchestrated on this continent.
1328382905559568384 2020-11-17 01:02:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @jayrosen_nyu @pamgriffa Are you referring to the infotainment opinion show about opines on what others think about something  someone might have said while expressing the opinions that yet another might want them to babble about? We call it the fix the channel station! So many of them to chose from...
1328380661573562370 2020-11-17 00:53:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @ProudSocialist @TheSpinReport The Military Industrial Complex that took control of the elected elite is the evil empire.  WTP carry the blame by giving our consent through our silence...  Now is the time of our discontent and we must establish communications that the elite can no longer ignore...
1328373071368118272 2020-11-17 00:23:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  mr one term impeached ex president?   It seems that you may not be understanding just exactly what happened in the recent election...   Don't believe me but maybe this Gentleman could provide you some much needed insight?

Offered hamberders, kfc, cofeve &amp; trophy if he would just go with the nice men in the pretty white uniforms.   Even offered a nice new jacket with xxl sleeves &amp; shiny leather straps on the back, still wouldn't bite!  Your trophy is bigger than mine, might work?
1328361051075829760 2020-11-16 23:35:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Corporate socialism is perfectly ok?  Socialism for the people is apparently a new crime against humanity?
1328359530330251264 2020-11-16 23:29:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Nobody gets this absolute power without being absolutely corrupted! Investigate this destroyer of democracy!
1328356566177865737 2020-11-16 23:17:39 +0800 <JUthergi> That look after you've been taken to the woodshed...shameful

1328347167942119426 2020-11-16 22:40:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Coup d'etat or 25th Ammendment? Perhaps each cabinet member is part of the plan to overthrow our gov &amp; should also be charged with treason? Guilty by silent acquiescence?

1328330570854768640 2020-11-16 21:34:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Fact check, by vanky? This must be the oxymoron of the month!!!
1328329025811574787 2020-11-16 21:28:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step
1328327447830474757 2020-11-16 21:21:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @1Markrebel @reech13 @TimMurtaugh @seanmdav Didn't he go to Qatar first? After rejection he lobbied for their blockade, then got money &amp;  blockade lifted? Am so confused...
1328326647309864964 2020-11-16 21:18:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently trump's advisors were not technically qualified to watch a live stream event? Video cams everywhere helped to insure the most secure elections in our history.
1328323775901872128 2020-11-16 21:07:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @kneerecon trump leadership?
1328323419910369285 2020-11-16 21:05:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews @KristiNoem How about a maga rally in Sturgis, next week?
1328322569527848961 2020-11-16 21:02:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Well well. Even though the pres quit at least the propaganda machine still works.  Nice try princess, maybe you should have bought more of your new voting for daddy machines?
1328120860016775169 2020-11-16 07:41:02 +0800 <JUthergi> It did not go away! It is not a hoax!
1328119314197716993 2020-11-16 07:34:54 +0800 <JUthergi> trump hasn't tried to protect us from the trump virus &amp; hasn't even attended task force mtgs in 4-5 mos.  As CIC isn't this DERELICTION OF DUTY and worthy of Court Martial? Impeachment? 25th Ammendment?  Was there really ever such a group as Guardians of Liberty?  Where are they?
1328115252991569920 2020-11-16 07:18:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Since our elected elite refuse to help WTP in this deadly pandemic, can we rescind their royal health care pkg &amp; golden parachutes?  Did anyone of WTP consent to treating them like royalty? Anybody?  So they govern us WITHOUT CONSENT?  We have the right to change this, how?
1328113943622127616 2020-11-16 07:13:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Designed &amp; timed to make it look like the next President Elect takes the blame!  mitch mc con All strikes again!
1328112132878192640 2020-11-16 07:06:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Looking forward to a FLOTUS that I'll NEVER HAVE TO SEE NAKED!  eeewwwe!
1328110232921366528 2020-11-16 06:58:49 +0800 <JUthergi> For them!
1328108918464258049 2020-11-16 06:53:35 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP pay our taxes...for the common good of all. Our elected elite pay high priced "tax avoidance" lawyers to find tax loopholes but they claim they're all for us working Americans.  Does anyone else get it yet?   WTP are the only ones that care abt WTP &amp; what if we cannot unite?
1328107435412873219 2020-11-16 06:47:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Investigate mitch
1328106962106654720 2020-11-16 06:45:49 +0800 <JUthergi> jr jr jr? Poor, poor jr.  how can you expect anyone to be respectful of you &amp; your family's hurt over the landslide loss when you take such joy in other's misfortunes?  Don't be a despicable donny!
1328105029857849344 2020-11-16 06:38:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Sounds even more ominous than war with Iran!
1328104679583133698 2020-11-16 06:36:45 +0800 <JUthergi> He can still pressure gop give to load state EC with "loyalists" and is trying everything to get stated to miss 12/8/20 certification deadline.  More chaos on the horizon before this carnival barker's grand finale!
1328102217904164864 2020-11-16 06:26:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they attack any WWII veterans that saved the world? You know the type,  Anti - Fascist!  Maybe they don't understand that antifa means anti Fascist?  i wonder how many of their own family members fought the Fascists?
1328099567494164483 2020-11-16 06:16:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Is he actually salivating at seeing his "highly uneducated" followers?
1328099157446418433 2020-11-16 06:14:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Be patient.   i fear trumpy bear's grand finale will be the most incredibly unbelievable super hydro sonic tremendous &amp; terrifically horrible end!  He's programmed to go out with a bigly bang!
1328096437222174721 2020-11-16 06:04:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump Does that apply to daddy when grabbing women "by the *!∆∆✓" or yanking out a clump of women's hair in a fit if rage? How is your mom btw?
1328079779300511745 2020-11-16 04:57:48 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's red wave is the blood of almost 250k DEAD CITIZENS with 1m CITIZENS infected by the trump virus each week. This cannot be undone...
1328076203241185286 2020-11-16 04:43:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Their plan seems to be working. Step by step...
1328053808409309188 2020-11-16 03:14:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Is today 25th Ammendment Day? Today. Today, it MUST be today right?  Oh please please please let it be today?
1328052507902406656 2020-11-16 03:09:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @RBReich @DianHeymann Mr Reich Attacking the core of Democracy yes, but we seem to be witnessing a strategic dismantling of OUR REPUBLIC?  Why not invoke 25th Ammendment?  hoping it's my own ignorance, but i can't help but sense a war with Iran or blood in our streets wi coup d'etat? Insights pls?
1328050873050804224 2020-11-16 03:02:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @CaslerNoel @pamgriffa @realDonaldTrump After learning which one was sent to casablancas elite modelling school it's not too difficult a task. But thanks
1328050416693735426 2020-11-16 03:01:07 +0800 <JUthergi> And the trump virus task force us nowhere to be found...
1328047747900067840 2020-11-16 02:50:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @ScottDavid2020 @ReportsDaNews @realDonaldTrump Especially so if all you got left is ghouliani! lol
1328045453171109889 2020-11-16 02:41:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Emily, dear. Do you think your loyalty to trump equates to his loyalty to you? Can anyone be that naive? There is no pardon coming from him for your crimes of gov obstruction so sign the letter and let's get it done!!!
1328044474560286721 2020-11-16 02:37:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @SenJeffMerkley @Stoptheinsani20 mc con All won't allow WTP to get help unless y'all vote to remove liability from corporate donors that fail to protect employees from C19. Ditch mitch so WTP can cling to hope that it's not just biz as usual,!
1328038888393289734 2020-11-16 02:15:19 +0800 <JUthergi> How many people can we share this with?
1328037126559182849 2020-11-16 02:08:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews @realDonaldTrump Breaking news! After his formal concession and acceptance of the great victory achieved by the B/H, trump is seen leaving the WH!!??
1328036370548482048 2020-11-16 02:05:19 +0800 <JUthergi> 1st step to Fascism is to destroy media
1328034936931151878 2020-11-16 01:59:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @ananavarro @DayleBrand This guy is so animated i thought he was a cartoon!
1328033651670519808 2020-11-16 01:54:30 +0800 <JUthergi> See? He is such a bigly powerful leader he takes the high road and accepts his defeat. Such integrity! A true man of character?
1328032946268360706 2020-11-16 01:51:42 +0800 <JUthergi> But wouldn't that violate barr's loyalty oath to trump?
1328032575982612482 2020-11-16 01:50:14 +0800 <JUthergi> That rudy! He's the best, at what though nobody can be sure.
1328031021951037440 2020-11-16 01:44:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Our only consolation in this election is taking the matches from the kid before he burns down the WH.
1328030395217088512 2020-11-16 01:41:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @dazyjane410 @ericgarland Ms Jane it seems like stopping elective/ optional surgeries will keep open, for as long as possible hospitals ability to take c19 pt. An effort to save children's lives prior to the coming storm of red waves if trump virus? But then again i'm always confused...
1328023347607777281 2020-11-16 01:13:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @McFaul @DianHeymann Could impeached 1 term ex president work too?
1328021639896965122 2020-11-16 01:06:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @kurteichenwald Food lines? Not discounting any comments abt trump I think this looks more like hurricane evacuation. All headed one way... Still, what almost seems inevitable are national food lines.
1328019476466503681 2020-11-16 00:58:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @KevinSaunar @Pontifex I read and see only pics and am frustrated by what appears to be only platitudes. Vatican is one of if not the wealthiest org on earth and what the nuns &amp; jesuits taught me about Catholicism seems to differ from the actions of the hierarchy. It is truly painful to see suffering.
1327988062316617728 2020-11-15 22:53:21 +0800 <JUthergi> If only they could direct this energy at the corrupt gov leaders that divided us into extremist groups.  What a wonderful world it could be...
1327984318065618951 2020-11-15 22:38:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @Pontifex Considering the vast wealth &amp; resources at your disposal, don't you think you could send food med supplies &amp; $ instead?  Imagine what a 10% tithe could do?
1327982066303164416 2020-11-15 22:29:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepsForBiden @ClcpierceCarol Joe Cool. He's back!
1327974572667383809 2020-11-15 21:59:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @UsingKeep @foof343 @realDonaldTrump All I see in this comedy of errors is the old Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle cartoon. vanky is Natasha Badenough, trump is Boris. Where's Rocky???
1327972947626254338 2020-11-15 21:53:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @foof343 @realDonaldTrump If only his campaign people didn't rip him off he could have bought more of vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines designed to guarantee his win.  Well at least vanky's investment in Chinese Patented Caskets will pay off well...
1327968039799820288 2020-11-15 21:33:47 +0800 <JUthergi> But if all the other senators are doing the same thing it's ok, right?

1327754648296493056 2020-11-15 07:25:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget people!  Trump has offered the first 250 supporters to register at his hotel a free nights stay!   Free beers too!  AND free overnight parking anywhere in city limits!  MAGA on trump's dime!
1327753253384294407 2020-11-15 07:20:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Thought her name was mc enemy. I get so confused ...
1327749679715586049 2020-11-15 07:06:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity Didn't trump fire you for your betrayals?  You know he's taking louie d to his new entertainment empire and not you, right?

Think of how difficult it will be for our people overseas, in the hospitals etc.  They make sacrifices to protect us, we CAN do the same...
1327737931994370049 2020-11-15 06:19:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step donnie the dictator just waiting in the shadows. FBI head still here?
1327737527399223297 2020-11-15 06:17:49 +0800 <JUthergi> So what's new? Now they tell us? They couldn't figure out he had ignored his duties all along?  We have almost 250k DEAD CITIZENS! 176k just today!
1327736307511144448 2020-11-15 06:12:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @RzstProgramming @MeidasTouch Don't they know trump uses a new flag? It's all white, both sides! Someone should tell them that their flag is a flag surrendered after fighting against the USA!
1327729579935621126 2020-11-15 05:46:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Was she buying new maternity clothes? Oh, congratulations! The donnie gets another gran!

1327722829207531522 2020-11-15 05:19:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Biz as usual. If we're gonna go after the loafer lady we might as well investigate all incumbent sens &amp; congress people...  Wow! Lightbulbs here! What a great idea if I do say so myself?!?
1327720316160921600 2020-11-15 05:09:25 +0800 <JUthergi> trump just said hundreds of thousands.  Why is this important when WE ARE DYING from the trump virus???
1327718742005047296 2020-11-15 05:03:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @DebraMessing @dennisaoconnor That's right sir! Millions &amp; millions all bc they luuv you!  Are you already? Time to go. See those nice men in the white uniforms?  They'll be taking you for more hamberders &amp; cofeve if you put on that nice white cost with the extra long sleeves &amp; nice straps in back.
1327716266765930496 2020-11-15 04:53:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Why is the great negotiator afraid to negotiate with mitch?  Please, tell us sir?
1327712389417082880 2020-11-15 04:37:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Powerfully impenetrable, hmmm
1327710264775626752 2020-11-15 04:29:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Despite claiming he was elected to work for the American people for 4 years, he spent over full year golfing?  Do we get a refund?

1327697554222493696 2020-11-15 03:38:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  WTP defeated you and now we will defeat your legacy... The trump Virus!
1327695772381556740 2020-11-15 03:31:54 +0800 <JUthergi> He heard that prev Presidents tended to start graying by second term. Naturally, he overdid it...
1327695385020817408 2020-11-15 03:30:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't Gov Cuomo build a wall too? Please?
1327693218260135936 2020-11-15 03:21:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging to hope...
1327693036462202880 2020-11-15 03:21:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step He has completed these 14 steps. What does logic tell us his next move will be?  https://t.co/wHpaDKPqql
1327691825784762370 2020-11-15 03:16:13 +0800 <JUthergi> The world IS watching!
1327657965596381185 2020-11-15 01:01:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Investing in Education offers the best ROI!!
1327656392979865600 2020-11-15 00:55:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Hopefully they're in line to get the free hotel accommodations trump offered at his hotel?
1327654788222357504 2020-11-15 00:49:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Not an experienced lip reader but did he just say f#*" you?
1327654239770906625 2020-11-15 00:46:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, if he doesn't care about russian bounties on our service members...
1327652065032728576 2020-11-15 00:38:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @J_Mei21 @BMeiselas Can you tell them trump is giving a free night in his hotel if they bring in BH signage?
1327650874294939649 2020-11-15 00:33:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Such a powerful wall!  For his ego, he took gazillions $ from service member bases requiring upgrades for security, infrastructure, housing &amp; education...  Is he still getting a % of Russian bounty kickbacks ?
1327642478934171650 2020-11-15 00:00:08 +0800 <JUthergi> No room for WTP in the gop!

1327637220048723969 2020-11-14 23:39:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @rmojomojito1 Hammity tried to tell louie he was washed up &amp; that trump was only taking ham and the tall anorexic blond women to his new media empire.  louie is jealous...
1327636313194065920 2020-11-14 23:35:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Wow! Such a wonderful gesture to give maga supporters free room &amp; board your dc hotel! The traffic violation pardons too! Parking is so difficult but not worrying about parking laws makes it so easy to support you.  Trump 2024! He gives maga free hotel rooms!
1327633645973204993 2020-11-14 23:25:02 +0800 <JUthergi> In the same breath she claims gop poll watchers not able to see votes counted bc they moved counters so far away she claims they observed fraudulent counts?  2020 doublespeak award winner?
1327619735693922306 2020-11-14 22:29:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Today right? Today must be 25th Amendment Day!  Is not almost 250k DEAD CITIZENS reason enough?
1327619255349768193 2020-11-14 22:27:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't the impeached outgoing pres grant parking immunity pardons for all of his supporters? I think the declaration gives them the right to park anywhere?
1327617171082588162 2020-11-14 22:19:34 +0800 <JUthergi> KY? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?  Investigate mitch! He has given both comfort &amp; aid to russia!  Did he rewrite what is considered treason &amp; pass new definition in the night? Is treason suddenly legal?   Is he more guilty than trump for his role in dismantling OUR REPUBLIC!
1327611685230796801 2020-11-14 21:57:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Yet another brilliantly terrific decision by the stable genius?
1327605565347028992 2020-11-14 21:33:27 +0800 <JUthergi> But isn't this what all of our elected elite do?
1327603993036673026 2020-11-14 21:27:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are the same charges not brought against trump???
1327601657547460608 2020-11-14 21:17:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Leaders do not fear the challenges of criticism...
1327600054799126528 2020-11-14 21:11:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Guess he loves us to death?
1327592450551144448 2020-11-14 20:41:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @docrussjackson Greetings neighbor!  Read your post &amp; thought it was written for us in the states across the pond. Sorry for your troubles, be strong &amp; be well!
1327591232537759747 2020-11-14 20:36:29 +0800 <JUthergi> American icons for what we do right...
1327398047261855744 2020-11-14 07:48:50 +0800 <JUthergi> And the youth shall lead them... It is WTP v gov &amp; it's time for new rules.
1327397619438678018 2020-11-14 07:47:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't this what all senators do?
1327396817777139714 2020-11-14 07:43:57 +0800 <JUthergi> This the boy who was in tears begging $ on tv? Oh? He has the power to block any investigations into himself? That's our elected elite!
1327395711575613441 2020-11-14 07:39:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @enbyclover 14253 as a lefty I &amp; others like me are the only ones thinking in right brains. Ok, I'll go see a shrink!
1327392828658491392 2020-11-14 07:28:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @ptozer207 I tried to remind him of his duties to moscow. Thanks for the laugh, hard to come by lately!
1327392466807435265 2020-11-14 07:26:40 +0800 <JUthergi> He got his wall...
1327391906217791491 2020-11-14 07:24:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @ptozer207 Not a chance...
1327391785753210880 2020-11-14 07:23:58 +0800 <JUthergi> The infamous prostrate eight!
1327391216116391938 2020-11-14 07:21:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Today? It's today?! Been waiting for so long!  Today is 25th Ammendment Day?  This is the luckiest Fri the 13th ever!!!
1327389585412935680 2020-11-14 07:15:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @PaulTodd01332 @ReportsDaNews (not the same prison you might be thinking about) White men wi wht collars get hotel type accomodations.
1327388241566326786 2020-11-14 07:09:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Holding our breath since they told trump he lost...
1327386571230892032 2020-11-14 07:03:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Men can have new hairdos too!   It's the second term &amp; he heard that all pres. start getting a little grey as the years take their toll.  He missed the word "little".  He just wants to look presidential...
1327384580790378502 2020-11-14 06:55:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Practice run?
1327383509447663617 2020-11-14 06:51:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @LACaldwellDC @SpeakerPelosi Did she say "let them eat cake" when referring to our wanting to dine in groups?
1327382566249385987 2020-11-14 06:47:20 +0800 <JUthergi> So confused. Will employers now require applicants to divulge health info outside HIPPA?  Will c19 cert. be required? Are we disqualified if c19 positive? If not tested can they demand testing or vaccines? Will we be able to buy gas or food or anything wo tests or vaccines? Help?
1327355977994280961 2020-11-14 05:01:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like the elected elite should try to be more like this woman!  Those that think they work for us, join Rep Porter &amp; support her as she sees fit.  Excepting a few on that hill, Y'ALL NEED TO PROVE your worth to WTP!  Now that we learned to vote you better watch out!
1327354472809574401 2020-11-14 04:55:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @WeepingNaiad @RepKatiePorter @federalreserve Is Rep Porter alone on this? Seems like Sen Warren has been here and they could roll heads together?
1327353727439822848 2020-11-14 04:52:44 +0800 <JUthergi> So is it war with Iran or war in our streets?   Seems like he's locked up all the pieces needed for absolute power?   When FBI dir. goes we could hear a new "shot heard 'round the world"...
1327351237042262016 2020-11-14 04:42:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... Something is not right. We're still not sure of anything except the dangers presented.
1327349524696879105 2020-11-14 04:36:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1327348825212805120 2020-11-14 04:33:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @vegix @ABrooksdeVita Leave the dems to put it out? Both parties owned by $.  Maybe we consider a 3rd option?  A united citizenry that forces whoever's in office to actually obtain our consent to govern?  In today's digital world our voices can no longer be ignored.  Non violent...
1327345588619407360 2020-11-14 04:20:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity Well, you guys did tell everyone the trump virus was a hoax. Nice.  Such a grinch! You're just upset the pres won't be pardoning You on Thanksgiving Day!  you thought you were the only turkey deserving of the president's royal pardon???  You poor boy...
1327343397846327296 2020-11-14 04:11:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @MsMaggieMaye @realDonaldTrump Lol!
1327343332301942785 2020-11-14 04:11:25 +0800 <JUthergi> At this point...send me a case!
1327338054307221504 2020-11-14 03:50:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Sir you're so quiet, everything ok?  We know how that hammity &amp; fox betrayed you.   You don't need them for 2024!  Let it all slide... Even nicknames like impeached rino pino should flow on by like water off a duck's back, right?  Just don't kill us all, Ok?
1327335981448654856 2020-11-14 03:42:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Is the crisis just beginning?  https://t.co/SEb8t1ZpvP
1327302780080558080 2020-11-14 01:30:17 +0800 <JUthergi> You guys are working?
1327302532494979075 2020-11-14 01:29:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Hammity!   Still working on that plan to be a leading world class comedian?  Good idea bc you betrayed trump &amp; he'll never forget!
1327300855641612289 2020-11-14 01:22:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Corporate responsibility? Oxymoron?
1327300347287711753 2020-11-14 01:20:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Sworn as a doctor to  1st do no harm?
1327286315986063360 2020-11-14 00:24:52 +0800 <JUthergi> But fox infotainment betrayed the pres.   What could be more important than that?  WTP have become expendable...
1327285345742970880 2020-11-14 00:21:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @jordanzakarin The American way.  The slave biz model has always been successful and has adapted quite well to changing times.  Gov has always supported it because biz men paid to adapt our Republic to that of a gov of the corp $, by the corp $, for the corp $...
1327280293368242177 2020-11-14 00:00:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Those darned lawyers, they refused to go on fox...
1327278696307302400 2020-11-13 23:54:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Did the binders miraculously appear?
1327278017324920835 2020-11-13 23:51:53 +0800 <JUthergi> 250k Citizens died? Too bad, they'll get over it.  fox said WHAT? I'll destroy those sons of b*#!hes, how dare they do this to me?!?!
1327272762218606592 2020-11-13 23:31:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Now trump us going to get reeeally angry!  Don't know whether to jump for joy or head to the bunkers?
1327269775525998592 2020-11-13 23:19:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Still no answers?  Guessing any good Countrymen expressing their refusal to consent got the standard elite response, "thank you for bringing this to my attention, we'll look into it".  Seems like all of the elected elite are silent hoping not to be destroyed by the new regime...
1327265643083821056 2020-11-13 23:02:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @sctadsen @kaitlancollins @PersuasivePR Evil operates in the shadows and it is where plots are best conceived...  I can't help but to think this is the calm before the storm?
1327263942876549121 2020-11-13 22:55:58 +0800 <JUthergi> The purge begins? Lockdown @ 1200h Bless the few founding fathers???
1327261083590127617 2020-11-13 22:44:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Makes sense
1327260641636315138 2020-11-13 22:42:50 +0800 <JUthergi> The attacks on the EC have begun!  Allowing trump supporters to manipulate &amp; delay counts will result in no consensus &amp; no cert of EC votes by Dec deadline.  This is part of the plan and it's execution to bring us under the control of the all new DICTATOR donnie!  Step by step...
1327039470936485888 2020-11-13 08:03:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @FalconEddie9 I don't doubt that but they are not militia.   National Guard is the militia and is well regulated as by design.  These are angry men with ideals outside the norms of civil society, like al qaeda or isis.  Dangerous with terroristic fear tactics.
1327037992087728128 2020-11-13 07:58:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Brilliant idea! Don't mess with the donnie because hell hath no fury like a disappointed narcissist! Wow! Imagine the entertainment of watching fox get dismantled by its own monster!  That could be trumpy bear's legacy!
1327036818567671811 2020-11-13 07:53:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @FalconEddie9 Having a hard time thinking that any one in these wannabe groups actually filed for a permit? Quick way to get shut down!
1327034884095873029 2020-11-13 07:45:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Remember when societies used to put the enemies head on a pike? Is that illegal? Asking for 330m+ friends...
1327034395627315202 2020-11-13 07:43:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Kendzior's intelligence &amp; journalistic integrity are only second to her courage in presenting truth!
1327033604841615364 2020-11-13 07:40:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @FalconEddie9 No i didn't but I can certainly take you at your word. Thanks. Buckle up friend! Stay safe &amp; be well...
1327032683562749952 2020-11-13 07:37:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Good advice!  Watch their antics, on TV, as pres tweets to convince all that the few hundred supporters are actually a few million supporters!
1327031749851963397 2020-11-13 07:33:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @johnpavlovitz @Cubfan13241 They must still be in hiding
1327031261303607302 2020-11-13 07:31:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Coup d'etat or war with Iran?   Either way trump believes in a scorched earth policy for his enemies, which now that he lost, is WTP!
1327030456332775425 2020-11-13 07:28:10 +0800 <JUthergi> The trump virus did not miraculously disappear &amp; we are still talking about it after the elections because it is not going away &amp; due to the lack of leadership that surrendered, its going to get very ugly!  Science is not an opinion or political perspective!!!
1327029153955246085 2020-11-13 07:22:59 +0800 <JUthergi> It's more fun to report him...
1327028846672162817 2020-11-13 07:21:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @Getsmart4 The proof of trump's reliances upon russia is well documented.  The proof of money trails from russian mafiya &amp; wealthy oligarchs is well documented.  Only those having yet to dig deeper than fox entertainment info shows could possibly have doubt.
1327027499591733255 2020-11-13 07:16:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Herculean effort achieved!
1327026364642418695 2020-11-13 07:11:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Poor kids are the only ones that believed trump claims of virus miraculously disappearing, now this!  trump trying to kill babies too?
1327025665569394688 2020-11-13 07:09:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Impeached president
1327025492424265728 2020-11-13 07:08:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Still, not one call from those sworn to protect us, to grant our dead a moment of silence/prayer...
1327025015192231937 2020-11-13 07:06:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Wondering if WTP ever really had representation? Good insights! TY!
1327006820628623360 2020-11-13 05:54:15 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's favorite in wh pressers!
1327004364054147074 2020-11-13 05:44:29 +0800 <JUthergi> trump virus is still here?
1327003374475161602 2020-11-13 05:40:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1327003121109889030 2020-11-13 05:39:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1327000646868983809 2020-11-13 05:29:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe this trump virus was designed to seek out trump sychophants and invented by Hunter Biden so nobody could find his laptop?
1326999466256240640 2020-11-13 05:25:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Mc con All had been obstructing gov ever since he became sen maj "leader" and has already promised to to the same in the Biden/Harris Admin.! Investigate mc con All's election?
1326995420732645379 2020-11-13 05:08:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Power to all people...
1326994344268754947 2020-11-13 05:04:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @FalconEddie9 "legal" lies?
1326993494947340289 2020-11-13 05:01:18 +0800 <JUthergi> All part of the plan. Step by step...
1326992070393925632 2020-11-13 04:55:38 +0800 <JUthergi> The primary reason for trump's success lies with mc con All. He knew Russia was involved but in his insatiable quest for power he refused to tell WTP.  It was more politically expedient to try to blame previous Admin &amp; keep the world on edge for so long!  Investigate KY election!
1326942488200876034 2020-11-13 01:38:37 +0800 <JUthergi> We ARE in the Twighlight Zone!
1326942045915779072 2020-11-13 01:36:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Pres for a day game? We should have thought of it earlier. lol
1326939478066421761 2020-11-13 01:26:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  We know you're upset about tv ratings right now but that virus thingy is getting worse.  i was wondering, since you are the ventilator king, if you sold them all?  Looks like we're going to need them back &amp; there's still ppe shortages.   You could get bigly $!
1326935466352979968 2020-11-13 01:10:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Such an important topic for dear leader to focus on.   So glad ratings on an entertainment info show are so much more important than nearly 250k dead citizens!  This is even more important than troop bounties!!!
1326932105742397442 2020-11-13 00:57:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  But sir, you claimed that you won?
1326930155827310593 2020-11-13 00:49:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  He wants to run again in a rigged election system?  Well, is that a confession to rigging the system?
1326909860785643521 2020-11-12 23:28:58 +0800 <JUthergi> From this day forward can we accept that trump's "red wave" is a reference to the blood of hundreds of thousands of OUR people?  If the elite won't call for a moment of silence/prayer to respect our dead perhaps WTP will have our own on Thanksgiving Day?  The trump virus kills!
1326907622277193729 2020-11-12 23:20:04 +0800 <JUthergi> At the very least we should be able to prosecute on dereliction of duty
1326906328204382209 2020-11-12 23:14:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Recount KY! Having been in sen for so long with only the goal of power, there us no way mc con All played fair! Looking for rigged elections, look into KY &amp; SC. It's likely where trump got his ideas.
1326903195193536512 2020-11-12 23:02:29 +0800 <JUthergi> A moral imperative to preserve the integrity of the Union...
1326899107122835456 2020-11-12 22:46:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Yes, it is humiliating.  WTP allowed corruption of the elite to the point of their perceived entitlement.  Thanks to the good character of allied leaders, we can be sure we are not alone in our common goals to defeat our wannabe dictators and grant no quarter!
1326895804544675840 2020-11-12 22:33:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe no one told them the virus didn't miraculously disappear? Who cares about the virus if you're orchestrating a coup d'etat?
1326893201450541056 2020-11-12 22:22:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Lawyers all across this country must be really proud to have their brethren work so hard to destroy the rule of law?  Watching these lawyers fight for team trump to destroy the rule of law make a great case for the coming Artificially Intelligent lawyers!
1326891368061480962 2020-11-12 22:15:29 +0800 <JUthergi> When the goal is to make people believe that our electoral process is corrupted beyond repair, one has to wonder, why the bad guys are trying so hard to destroy it?  Our electoral system works.  If it didn't produce legal &amp; fairly conducted results they wouldn't spend so much $.
1326638395905495040 2020-11-12 05:30:15 +0800 <JUthergi> mitch stealing an election? Bless his l'il heart!
1326637838176235522 2020-11-12 05:28:03 +0800 <JUthergi> When trump is prosecuted &amp; convicted for crimes against humanity he becomes an enemy.  Can we prosecute these guys for treason bc they are giving aid &amp; comfort to the enemy?  Or did mitchie mc con All already grant liability waivers???
1326634761285230594 2020-11-12 05:15:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @YahyaJohn @realDonaldTrump Can't. Listen. To. This. talking head.   Heard the poll results she babbles about though &amp; I cannot help but to believe all who were polled were long time viewers of this entertainment opinion show.
1326633065939161094 2020-11-12 05:09:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Need a reason to enact term limits? Look what mc con All &amp; graham the crackers guy have done in just the past 4 yrs!  WTP deserve a refund!
1326630645095931905 2020-11-12 04:59:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... He keeps rolling along unimpeded by all those elected elite wrapped in OUR flag calling &amp; themselves patriots!
1326629561140973568 2020-11-12 04:55:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Is vanky hiding them in jare's 666 bldg?  Rumour has it that vanky is going to open a modelling school just like the one she went to at elite for uncle john cassablancas. Auntie g would be so proud!
1326628445032501248 2020-11-12 04:50:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @marylferris1 Why did he salute the wreath instead of laying in the tomb? Was it a dig at unknown veterans ?
1326627732969709573 2020-11-12 04:47:53 +0800 <JUthergi> This appears to have been the goal from the beginning and they continue step by step.  If more like you sir speak out we may have a chance.  Remember though, bc of barr, whatever trump does will now be legal...
1326626421972852737 2020-11-12 04:42:41 +0800 <JUthergi> The trump virus has not magically disappeared, again, after election day as we were told.  Could whoever spouts this nonsense be a lying bigly type of person? Hmmm...

1326621380465594368 2020-11-12 04:22:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @Inojbird @MeidasTouch @DonaldJTrumpJr Right you are JW! putin &amp; all russian media are beside themselves in anger bc their "useful idiot" trained &amp; financed for decades failed bigly. NK &amp; China are worried too!
1326619930712813569 2020-11-12 04:16:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently jr they are people with dignity that accept losses &amp; move on.  you are inviting violence &amp; chaos into our lives bc that is what your life has been?  You really think a scorched earth policy is best for your family?   Are you trying to cancel jr 4 pres 2024 + forever?
1326582863085490178 2020-11-12 01:49:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr  WTP by our blood sweat &amp; tears have feathered your nest, your wife's as well any friends or relatives and you fight for trump to destroy OUR REPUBLIC. Why?  Why do you hate USA &amp; WTP? Stop this while you can...
1326581263969497090 2020-11-12 01:43:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Been saying Step by step... Stay vigilant!
1326577636022366209 2020-11-12 01:28:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Who me?  You must be talking to me cause I resemble that remark?
1326576530881961987 2020-11-12 01:24:26 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP do not consent!  The worst performing employees that would not find jobs in pvt sector have risen to be the elected elite?  WTP deserve a refund!  Nowhere on earth has the consumer of "pro svcs." received so little for such a great cost! #refundWTP!
1326573967394607105 2020-11-12 01:14:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @InTheNoosphere @OGrady_Texas Must be Jethro Bodine's brother?  He's the smarter one that dun git all the way to 8th grade gradiation.
1326571020359266304 2020-11-12 01:02:32 +0800 <JUthergi> USGov gas stripped them of resource &amp; infrastructure. They may be most susceptible to the trump virus.  Encouraging that President Biden has already spoken of the disenfranchisement Indigenous Peoples.  WTP are our brother's our brothers keepers in the USA, even if USGov isn't.
1326567842381246465 2020-11-12 00:49:54 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP for so long have failed to recognize the behemoth of power we become when held in unity by our ideals...it is time to be united and wield that power to eradicate from our midst those who fail to recognize their primary duty to OUR common good!
1326564868032507908 2020-11-12 00:38:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Just saw the dignified ceremonial wreath laying to honor Veterans. i'm confused again, why did you only touch the wreath &amp; not actually place it on The Tomb of The Unknown Soldiers?  PS I heard they already changed the locks back @ wh. driver could stop @ hotel?
1326561388945354754 2020-11-12 00:24:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @LABirdlady @glennkirschner2 putin is still the marionette for his l'il trumpy bear puppet!    ain't over yet.
1326560103336697858 2020-11-12 00:19:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Exactly the reason for putin's stated goal, US Citizens doubting election integrity. Step by step...
1326555964540145665 2020-11-12 00:02:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Was it vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines that secured his election?  While the impeached one claims fraudulently rigged hoax of an election, mc con All (&amp; crackers graham) are ok with election's integrity bc they claim they won?  Investigate KY &amp; SC!!!
1326551724962689026 2020-11-11 23:45:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump The bigliest rino ever says what?  Is the donnie still raging bc the dnc rejected him so harshly for all of his previous attempts to gain fame as pres?
1326550069181521927 2020-11-11 23:39:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Have they been installed in all the red states? Can't be sure bc Chinese Made is usually a cheap knock off of an original &amp; typically breaks or falls apart shortly after purchase. The ones in KY &amp; SC appeared to have worked. Still no investigation or msm opinions on this?
1326546831346597889 2020-11-11 23:26:25 +0800 <JUthergi> What? Thought this was an AI generated meme, is that really a human speaking?
1326545914341728258 2020-11-11 23:22:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, Pres Obama's team did take away all the "T" keys off WH computers and trumpy bear wants revenge!  He's probably still raging that dnc rejected him for all his previous attempts to be pres prior to 2016.
1326544763777032193 2020-11-11 23:18:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging to hope...

1326544065886736386 2020-11-11 23:15:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't shake this feeling that we are about to learn a whole new definition of craaazy?  Is it 25th Ammendment Day, yet?
1326543159443091458 2020-11-11 23:11:49 +0800 <JUthergi> It's today? Is today 25th Ammendment Day?  Oh please, let it be today!
1326541860286865413 2020-11-11 23:06:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Referring to vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines? Seems like they worked fine if mc con All won?

1326315651762413568 2020-11-11 08:07:47 +0800 <JUthergi> But that guy said he had the most tremendously terrific &amp; incredibly unbelievable health plan in the history of the world! Even better than the sen/congrss health plans that people can't touch? He's gonna release it as any minute now, or in 2 weeks, he never lies...
1326314073991077889 2020-11-11 08:01:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step the people were led down the path to autocratic rule.  They laughed all the way, can't happen here they said, then it was too late...
1326312996650541056 2020-11-11 07:57:14 +0800 <JUthergi> The very definition of lawful orders began to change the minute barr was installed at doj. Remember the Patriot act he helped to author under bush? Worth a read.  Step by step...
1326309443701760000 2020-11-11 07:43:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Yeah, but this disgruntled employee is about to postal!!!
1326308688014024704 2020-11-11 07:40:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr! Really, you should run for president in 2024!  Will vanky let you?
1326308452587737088 2020-11-11 07:39:11 +0800 <JUthergi> That's exactly what jr &amp; eric have been hollering about! It must be true?

1326305949036982273 2020-11-11 07:29:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @SemansL @kylegriffin1 It's been reported that the minute @realDonaldTrump trump was confirmed pres elect in 2016, he demanded that everyone call him mr president!  Maybe we should all follow his example &amp; refer to President Elect Biden as Mr. President starting today?
1326304435589537793 2020-11-11 07:23:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we all commit to honor our VETERANS tomorrow?  A great way to honor those who sacrifice for our freedoms, is very simple.  DO NOT SPEAK THE NAME:   t-r-u-m-p    (The whole day!)

1326291345850458112 2020-11-11 06:31:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @Couchmans_View @RBReich Giving aid &amp; comfort to the enemy is treason. How have they not filed charges for trump's relationships wi Rus. NK TURK CHINA etc is incomprehensible.  His new deal, shaking the foundations of elections is precisely putin's stated goal.  Step by step...
1326289855735885824 2020-11-11 06:25:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @pnoel20 @RBReich There's more report that FBI CIA could be next? With NSA HS under control that would give all necessary tools to keep the enemy,(WTP), under control.  Step by step...

1326169469597732864 2020-11-10 22:26:55 +0800 <JUthergi> So the Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines bought by vanky end up in SC &amp; KY where both mc cons all &amp; lil lindsie are not expected to win reelection, but somehow do? Well, guess those machines will be everywhere before WTP get a chance to vote in 2024. vanky wanna win!
1326163156239065088 2020-11-10 22:01:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Stating publicly that trump is not plotting to prevent pres elect from taking office is pretty much the clarion call that he is doing exactly that!  Step by step...

1326153728886509568 2020-11-10 21:24:22 +0800 <JUthergi> You can just tell how powerfully athletic this guy was? lol he called himself an athlete?!?!

1325956933120122881 2020-11-10 08:22:22 +0800 <JUthergi> All they need is to create &amp; nurture the illusion long enough so state ballots not certified on time to get certified by the EC on time, then it's too late bc coup d'etat will be completed.  Step by step...

1325955383853256709 2020-11-10 08:16:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like if you want to be with trump, you just gotts say   "oath shmoath"
1325954803239964673 2020-11-10 08:13:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't trump say if they take the 5th that they're hiding some crime?
1325954381213274113 2020-11-10 08:12:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Just look a little deeper!  mitchie's corruption by moscow goes back decades, almost as far back as trump's!  Don't be surprised by the many moscow 'useful idiots' to be found.  Remember when Obama wanted to release proof of 2016 Russian interference?   mc CON ALL stopped it!
1325922077719859204 2020-11-10 06:03:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Now she's babbling about it's media job to root out probs wi election. oan only place to listen to this entertainment.

1325917843687436294 2020-11-10 05:47:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Did our elected corporate owned elite ever even get the keys to gov back? If so, gonna be very difficult to prove to WTP...
1325914597371617280 2020-11-10 05:34:08 +0800 <JUthergi> All for pursuit of $
1325913710129520640 2020-11-10 05:30:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Almost as if it's an attempt to delay certification if votes by dates required by state laws?  Delay until past due date for EC certification? He wants to rule forever!
1325912151383543810 2020-11-10 05:24:25 +0800 <JUthergi> putin's plan?
1325911946105921544 2020-11-10 05:23:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper It's been reported that trump had a deal wi USGov to not pay fed taxes for 30yrs, ending recently. Did this guy neg the deal and get his own? Absolute corruption by the absolutely corruptable elite?

1325874953779077120 2020-11-10 02:56:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Russia etc etc claims our impeached ex president about Russian election interference being a hoax.  This article quotes Russian media confirming their interference and how if trump did more for them, they would have insured his 2nd term!  No hoax, they undermined our elections.

He called for investigation, implying his opponent was dirty. Seems like classic projection. Almost as if he knew his dark money was coming to buy his seat... AGAIN!
1325566090219491329 2020-11-09 06:29:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @gigatess @JerasIkehorn Women with no life choices left are prosecuted. Elected elite often the most frequent patrons of these women, have choices. Political prostitution should be the equivalent of treason. Punish accordingly!
1325565330010337281 2020-11-09 06:26:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Moscow remains active in dark money "contributions". lil lindsie &amp; mitch are owned?

1325531245451874311 2020-11-09 04:10:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @dvillella @realDonaldTrump IKR? Did you hear him election night? The whole world wants to know results of my win now!  If not for his hubris it might be sad...
1325530009726017537 2020-11-09 04:05:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Must be a conspiracy!  BTW, since you like to dance so much i wondered if you were dancing with the rest of THE WHOLE WORLD yesterday?  This "conspiracy" to fire you actually worked out quite well?
1325528752013660160 2020-11-09 04:00:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @mpuhlman @realTuckFrumper He won't even consider that it's the hypocrisy of gop leadership that may result in no more gop presidents?  He &amp; mc cons all are  speaking only of more division &amp; how to best obstruct the country from moving forward!  KY &amp; SC, what on earth were you thinking?
1325527498575253506 2020-11-09 03:55:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir? What's this?  Must be a mistake bc your whole existence &amp; purpose in wh was all about the bigliest crowds anywhere in history. That &amp; you saved the world from your virus! You need to address this fakery, their just being mean...
1325524535672795137 2020-11-09 03:44:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @AynRandPaulRyan @FLOTUS Well she apparently knows about transparency.  Won't it be great to have a FLOTUS that doesn't have nude pics, etc. that pop out of a twit feed when least expected?
1325521866291892226 2020-11-09 03:33:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @13speedOD @realDonaldTrump Can't believe he didn't declare bankruptcy in order to renegotiate to save him $m as 8s his practice. This time however he may have to sacrifice a pet property instead of loser property like Taj Mahal NJ.
1325520569404694529 2020-11-09 03:28:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @ams1701 @jeans77_2000 @ReallyAmerican1 @JamesKosur CU was created by incumbents overstaying their welcome.  Term limits needed as outlined in US Constitution. If power is the prime directive, evidenced by people like sens from KY SC CA NY etc., WTP will continue to fight their attempts at socio-economic control over us forever...

1325231030953979904 2020-11-08 08:17:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Tell us again, what was it you said about losers? Hey, big guy. Don't be upset because you're still the only impeached pres to lose incumbency by millions of popular votes, twice in a row! That's got to be the bigliest win our country has ever seen! Winnings!
1325226107562565634 2020-11-08 07:58:20 +0800 <JUthergi> He needs to be removed from office asap. Too dangerous &amp; his strategies to secure his power have yet to be played out...

Stop trying to scare people ghouliani! Halloween has passed. Take off that scary costume, go back to your lair!

1325203603712331776 2020-11-08 06:28:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Hasn't it occured to l'il marco that his agenda means nothing to WTP? The elected elite need to re eval whose agenda is more important? Yours,(as in the past 50 yrs), or that if WTP.  We see what y'all have done...
1325201019702140929 2020-11-08 06:18:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Are you hiding from those nice men in white uniforms?

They have a nice coat wi xl sleeves just for you!  Be best now...

1325197065157140480 2020-11-08 06:02:55 +0800 <JUthergi> But that has been the plan all along, step by step... We cannot let our guard down, ever again.

1325156686412328960 2020-11-08 03:22:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @WoefulMage Did your daddy throw you too? Lil puffball, where's your head? Lol
1325155898608611328 2020-11-08 03:19:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Um, didn't anyone tell this guy that his sugar daddy got fired?
1325155154597961730 2020-11-08 03:16:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Loose the lawyer hounds of war!  The work begins, we must all join the fight for OUR REPUBLIC!  Overwhelm your representatives with calls letters emails texts emojis &amp; any other communication tools available to let them know that nobody is above the law, especially them...
1325146662906388480 2020-11-08 02:42:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @saraecook @CBSNews No videos of his reaction to being fired? Yet another failure of msm. The one time we look to be entertained...
1325145913178812416 2020-11-08 02:39:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Didn't you say that the president's term is for 4 FULL YEARS?  Get back to work!  Or did you quit the presidency like you did after losing the trump virus war???
1325144458699083776 2020-11-08 02:33:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging now to a fully restored, new HOPE...
1325143015065784320 2020-11-08 02:28:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Dear msm: PLEASE STOP! Just for today, no opinions of what you think someone said or did or might do in the opinion of yet another.  PLEASE, just for today show us only people joyously celebrating in the streets...in silence?
1325141978380689409 2020-11-08 02:24:02 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Boris! You can step back but stand by! lol  Family ALWAYS needs to stick together.  Hopefully our family will come out stronger and more united after this messy divorce.  power to all people!
1325118735800266756 2020-11-08 00:51:40 +0800 <JUthergi> If msm can't catch his reaction on video it will be your biggest failure yet!!!
1325118169456013316 2020-11-08 00:49:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @katestarbird @AshaRangappa_ Just stepped out to bang my pots in celebration. Stopped a baseball game in park next door, got booed! Heading back for more pots and my drumsticks!
1325117043155283969 2020-11-08 00:44:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump YOU'RE FIRED! (Pass it on)
1325116418875142146 2020-11-08 00:42:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Yesterday not soon enough!!!!!
1325116317519769600 2020-11-08 00:42:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh NO! Fix just projected Biden win, is this fake news too??? Or did they finally cut ties with the trump virus still trying to kill us?
1325114987631714305 2020-11-08 00:36:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Let the celebration begin!!! GOD blessed America!!!
1325114586757033984 2020-11-08 00:35:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @itsJeffTiedrich Will trump still speak???
1325114400164995076 2020-11-08 00:34:27 +0800 <JUthergi> More MSM calling elections!!! Except fox &amp; oan...
1325113847016022018 2020-11-08 00:32:15 +0800 <JUthergi> It's happening!!!!
1325113371012833285 2020-11-08 00:30:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Something to unite us...
1325113261579231233 2020-11-08 00:29:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @subnetbot @RosenzweigP It's time for the honest members with integrity sitting in OUR house/senate to reenact the  FAIRNESS DOCTRINE they took away '87+/-. This time it needs severe financial penalties for violators. Penalty funds collected could perhaps fund education grants for journalists?
1325111240004411392 2020-11-08 00:21:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you Dr Fauci
1325110127125467136 2020-11-08 00:17:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh no! Et tu jr???  Did you surrender already to the Biden Harris camp?  Why aren't you tweeting about your poor daddy's predicament?  Heeey, are you still in the country?
1325109363074342912 2020-11-08 00:14:26 +0800 <JUthergi> It's not 25th Ammendment Day? What are they waiting for, he could fire entire cabinet, then what?   Try impeachment? Not with mc cons all in power.  Anyone remember when those folks in our shining city on the hill were more interested in us than their own mange ridden hides?
1325107851984048129 2020-11-08 00:08:25 +0800 <JUthergi> trump virus IS STILL HERE? But, but he said it was all a hoax and it would disappear, like a miracle? Could there be anything else he might have mislead us on?
1325107248872493057 2020-11-08 00:06:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Guess he's going for working man optics? Think maybe he'll wear plaid flannel &amp; camo???
1325106247113248770 2020-11-08 00:02:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Both parties have been complicit, different only in name for decades now, enrichment for themselves at our expense.
1325105296679833603 2020-11-07 23:58:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Good find!
1325104958807695362 2020-11-07 23:56:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Have WTP been divided and conquered by the elite? Divided? Yes! They are do good we turn on each other. Conquered? No! Time for WTP to make changes...time to tell them how to do their jobs and try working for their reward. Time to stop stealing from WTP!
1325102797591896065 2020-11-07 23:48:20 +0800 <JUthergi> This must be a trick question, right? Oh eric, you're such a clever boy!
1325101618052927489 2020-11-07 23:43:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! I told you this guy would betray you! He just wears all the orange make up like you bc he is trying to mock you! Dump that chump! Oh, not you sir...
1325100989288951810 2020-11-07 23:41:09 +0800 <JUthergi> trump played the macho man song, it's kind of a dog whistle for wannabe machos?
1325100448727130112 2020-11-07 23:39:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Likely she didn't tell him , then asked him to tweet this for her. Poor eric. He'll be left to pay for the family crimes. Good thing Barron is still a minor...
1325098953642274816 2020-11-07 23:33:04 +0800 <JUthergi> He is fighting to protect the American People?
1325098625018552321 2020-11-07 23:31:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Long after trump is forcefully removed from office the trump virus will continue to poison our lives killing our loved ones.  Thinking this is what a malignant narcissistic really means by winning. If this is winning donnie, you were right I am begging you to stop!!!
1325087430161166336 2020-11-07 22:47:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Guessing he should have kept his gas mask on for this dem virus hoax???
1325085315661524992 2020-11-07 22:38:52 +0800 <JUthergi> As trump's actions become more dangerous with each passing minute, I just have to ask...  Is it 25th Ammendment Day?
1325078079669145600 2020-11-07 22:10:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @lifesafeast @JenniferJJacobs Selling ppe &amp; covid-19 vaccines &amp; therapeutics are personally profitable to trump.
1325076939233751042 2020-11-07 22:05:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step, the strategy unfolds as we are transitioned to autocracy &amp; no one will notice until it's too late...
1325076429407711232 2020-11-07 22:03:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you! We will need all of our friends &amp; neighbors to help in the coming months. Don't give up on US!
1325073627310682114 2020-11-07 21:52:26 +0800 <JUthergi> This appears to be a summation of all trump admin claims over the past 4 years...
1325071663176818688 2020-11-07 21:44:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is it that those with the least integrity always speak of it? The bigliest liars always say believe me?
1325070834462035969 2020-11-07 21:41:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step he continues to dismantle OUR REPUBLIC to further dictatorial fantasies!  Our gov &amp; everyone responsible for protecting us are either cowards or have already surrendered to trump's autocracy!  WTP must unite to save our union, or else...
1325068859754344448 2020-11-07 21:33:29 +0800 <JUthergi> trump may go but the trump virus will continue to kill us.  Can't somebody develop a plan to eradicate this?  Sorry, I know it was supposed to disappear like a miracle again, after elections, but whoever said that must've just pulled their head out of their own ass...
1325067005926453259 2020-11-07 21:26:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @GabiMccauley So true. If people like division and chaos then why is it so difficult to understand that the true enemy of the people is the corrupted elected elites that keep us divided for their own benefit.  Mostly to profit off of our labor, slavery biz model was merely modified...
1325064023218548738 2020-11-07 21:14:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1324862903556698115 2020-11-07 07:55:05 +0800 <JUthergi> She's still here?
1324861377220120580 2020-11-07 07:49:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Wouldn't it be more fitting to make their name into a swear word requiring $1 for the swear jar?  Go t-r-u-m-p yourself man! t-r-u-m-p you!  oh, just t-r-u-m-p it all, that t-r-u-m-p-i-n-g hurt!  It could work...
1324859606573723648 2020-11-07 07:41:59 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and both parties team up to divide us from each other.  Can WTP finally unite against the corruption of the elected elite &amp; their big $ owners?
1324854147812921344 2020-11-07 07:20:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Best film of 2020!!!  Makes me wish we could put all politicians in Tina Turners thunder-dome!
1324852797012135939 2020-11-07 07:14:56 +0800 <JUthergi> You are not alone funny lady! Can you do a jr lip synch?
1324852349291106306 2020-11-07 07:13:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe trump didn't get an invite?
1324851473411461124 2020-11-07 07:09:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Venezuela?
1324851334160535556 2020-11-07 07:09:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Thanking GOD for the small favors, still clinging to hope...
1324848703052632067 2020-11-07 06:58:39 +0800 <JUthergi> If he spent more time presidenting like vanky does, instead of whining about how mean everyone is, he could have been a contender!   Truly great in the nefarious madmen circles of power, but he failed there too!
1324847424549068800 2020-11-07 06:53:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, did you know this? Your own lawyers are against you! It's a plot to get you! Everyone, seems to have betrayed you! Perhaps it is time to go? Nobody truly  appreciates stable geniuses until their gone. It's our loss, we'll move on, you too!
1324843580209483778 2020-11-07 06:38:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Umm, no. Please!  Hard enough to listen to disco. i hear this i am forced to pic a roly-poly ol man with a fake tan &amp; yellow coon skin cap wobbling like a weeble across a stage.  The inhumanity! An indelibly stamped image to keep us in the nightmare trumpy bear era.   Please. No!
1324832658371858434 2020-11-07 05:54:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Yet another fraud perpetrated by trump's on WTP?  What were vanky &amp; jared doing in NY?  Oooh, did vanky catch flotus Barron &amp; jare trying to escape without  her?  Does that mean they are placing all blame on jr &amp; eric!  Who turns states evidence 1st for immunity? C'mon eric!
1324830676412149761 2020-11-07 05:47:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Evidence, today? From the MI gop Chair?   Good try jr!  You still haven't read the Peter &amp; the Wolf story i recommended just for you?  The more you cry out the less people listen!  Why jr?
1324827468813971459 2020-11-07 05:34:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are you still here? Your boy is losing, stop promoting accusations wo proof. Oh, right. Only journalism requires factual evidence to make accusations...my bad.
1324825936630583297 2020-11-07 05:28:12 +0800 <JUthergi> But but....
1324825845945536512 2020-11-07 05:27:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Poor jr, the only statistical impossibility you should be concerned with is how you could still be here?  Did the "family" already pack &amp; leave you, alone with your phone again?  Just leave man or you'll never get the nomination in 2024!  Hearing rumors that ivanka got u out?
1324823319015837697 2020-11-07 05:17:47 +0800 <JUthergi> When you finally cheat lie etc your way into halls of power in DC is there some disease you catch that makes you start to look like a turtle?   Or is it some disease spreading through our confederate states?  Or are these two some evil twins separated # birth?  So confused...
1324821231783337986 2020-11-07 05:09:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @Colie_Braun @FrozenAlchemy @newbielives @CarIegend @truth_tesla He gets his coin via his buying up all the supplies of the miracle drug cures he's been promoting.  Check out Sarah Kendzior books to follow dirty deals with big pharma &amp; ppe suppliers.
1324818913809620993 2020-11-07 05:00:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Just wondering, if eddie munster cruz ever pulls his head out of trump's behind, will the whole country hear the POP, or will just the Texans?
1324817951363633152 2020-11-07 04:56:28 +0800 <JUthergi> We knew it! Cruz IS eddie munster!
1324816892083752960 2020-11-07 04:52:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Good for you teddy boy! Finally got the courage to tell us all of the trump plan after all!  You still make Texas look weak...
1324815776512172037 2020-11-07 04:47:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr so presidential of you jr!  How can I donate to your "2024 jr for pres bc my daddy was one" campaign?  Should i send $ to that kids cancer charity in NY first? You know, in case you are forced to change plans &amp; run for your free life, instead?  eric says he'll tell on you!
1324814540584964096 2020-11-07 04:42:54 +0800 <JUthergi> This witch!
1324813420596776960 2020-11-07 04:38:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Bushwhacked again! Can't understand how they remained silent?
1324809345897517064 2020-11-07 04:22:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't this horrible trump virus miraculously disappear yet??? Why are we still talking about it after our dear leader said we couldn't talk about it after elections? lol
1324808596962578432 2020-11-07 04:19:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Shortly after Citizens United passed? Personally I believe it began after they saw what nixon could get away with and risks were thereafter minimized. Can't even count how many laws elected elite have exempted themselves from that still apply to WTP!
1324803687697567747 2020-11-07 03:59:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Better late than never! Today must be 25th Ammendment Day, right?
1324803138063372289 2020-11-07 03:57:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Please, let it be over with?
1324802431738355716 2020-11-07 03:54:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast Thought this guy was tied with Jethro kennedy from LA.?
1324802051063336962 2020-11-07 03:53:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper So NOW it occurs to them? From wh to the poor house...
1324801032334004226 2020-11-07 03:49:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Listen to the people!
1324800444988796928 2020-11-07 03:46:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Totally credible. That means believable. Tremendously terrific!
1324799856515362821 2020-11-07 03:44:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @cjcFlint @GOP What federal deficit?
1324799594660831238 2020-11-07 03:43:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Great news sir!!! When do you start?
1324797350431334406 2020-11-07 03:34:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @dickmilhousrock @KFILE Is that like what the Russian leaders are working on? Heard they are voting on a new law that grants blanket immunity to past Presidents, like putin.  Please tell us that mitchie didn't already pass a law like that, please?
1324795599598792704 2020-11-07 03:27:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Heard rumors that jare already took off wi flotus &amp; Barron in his new jet paid for by trump campaign?
1324794034825666561 2020-11-07 03:21:26 +0800 <JUthergi> How about those hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in all the newly built factoried the donnie brought back to the USA?
1324793560034627586 2020-11-07 03:19:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Are you sure the walking (brain) dead actually have feelings tricky ricky?
1324792561324728320 2020-11-07 03:15:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Just can't make stuff like this up! Comedians for the next few centuries will still have material for trump jokes!
1324791799395831809 2020-11-07 03:12:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Elections may be over but the trump virus keeps rolling along...
1324790981762363394 2020-11-07 03:09:18 +0800 <JUthergi> If rush limbaugh can get one, they kind of lost their value.  They are however available at walmart for a limited time only.   While there see their finest collection of china made trump products including caskets &amp; slightly used  voting machines that only vote for trump!
1324789058837581825 2020-11-07 03:01:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Hamm truck &amp; trump? Sounds like his old legal team of Doowe Screwem &amp; howe!
1324788357298298881 2020-11-07 02:58:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Great! So NOW he finally starts to act for the greater good of the American People?  Well that's certainly the bestest most incredibly unbelievable terrifically tremendous &amp; bigliest good news he has ever given to WTP!  Too bad he's a day late &amp; $400m+ short!
1324786733402251264 2020-11-07 02:52:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Seriously, there must be some legal precedence for sen ldr that refused to bring bills to floor for votes &amp; willfully obstructs gov operations daily, right?  Clinging to hope here &amp; fear losing grip if  mc cons all is allowed to continue corruption of OUR REPUBLIC!
1324782843550179329 2020-11-07 02:36:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Just part of the job for a highly trained Russian Handler controlling her assigned asset.
1324781392014856192 2020-11-07 02:31:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1324781048429948929 2020-11-07 02:29:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @FalconEddie9 Putin must pay pretty well? lol
1324780691012411393 2020-11-07 02:28:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @TaysInsane @realDonaldTrump Just another guy here that truly tried to be supportive of the EC appointed pres. Duty.  Tried to keep an open mind. hope he would drain the swamp.  But then the swamp began to grow and creatures lurking in the muck slithered into our lives.  Supporting 46, ahhh! Mmm good!
1324775588893249538 2020-11-07 02:08:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @pete_piccolo Joy to the World? Three Dog Night
1324775112571260936 2020-11-07 02:06:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Meiselas? Live your work and this tweet. Having a hard time lately with the term patriots. So many politicians, wrapping themselves in the flag, have truly bastardized a once proud title.  What if WTP went by Countrymen?  It's become WTP v gov and the elected elite like it.
1324772494872584198 2020-11-07 01:55:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Just another step towards autocracy...step by step
1324771854142312448 2020-11-07 01:53:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Trying to predict who pays for 2020 campaign?
1324770872251551745 2020-11-07 01:49:23 +0800 <JUthergi> We must never forget that the trump/gop red wave of voters is actually the red wave of the blood of 245k dead American Citizens!  Better dead than red had taken on a 21st Century perspective...
1324762354891005957 2020-11-07 01:15:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Voting trump out for his despicable nature included all his sychophants...that means you too hammhead!
1324761009370837024 2020-11-07 01:10:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Are we sure it's not  25th Ammendment Day  Today would be good!
1324760421081952256 2020-11-07 01:07:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Trick question?
1324757951073210369 2020-11-07 00:58:03 +0800 <JUthergi> But wait!  Is this jr building his platform for 2024?   Isn't he entitled to win, considering of course that vanky mysteriously disappears...like a miracle?
1324754374229434368 2020-11-07 00:43:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Hmmm. Very inspirational. Kind of makes one think, with great relief, that there is a plan.
1324753569174724608 2020-11-07 00:40:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Again?
1324751840421023744 2020-11-07 00:33:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   only in your own mind
1324749707378348034 2020-11-07 00:25:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Only thing he has of value...
1324749532408762369 2020-11-07 00:24:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment day yet? C'mon, just one cabinet member must have been humiliated by trump for the last time?  He's apparently ready to call 4 Martial Law to stay in office!
1324746186000125952 2020-11-07 00:11:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like your billionaires paid more to buy their own politician?
1324745535727742976 2020-11-07 00:08:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Be honest vanky, if possible...  Does daddy force you guys to tweet everytime he gets angry? Sure seems that way.  Shouldn't you be paying more attn to all the time jare spends with that "other woman" in the WH? melanoma, is that her name? She really likes younger men, ya know?
1324744410001743876 2020-11-07 00:04:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @JaredKushner_ @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr   You guys better hold your breath!
1324726859268038658 2020-11-06 22:54:30 +0800 <JUthergi> More fun than whack-a-mole!!!
1324723677158612993 2020-11-06 22:41:51 +0800 <JUthergi> With maga hats? Wonder what they pray to?
1324722483786846208 2020-11-06 22:37:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they call Lincoln "honest Abe" because he was the last republican ever to tell the truth? I thought so too!
1324720957668364289 2020-11-06 22:31:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Does anyone think that daddy took over jr's account?
1324719621434388482 2020-11-06 22:25:44 +0800 <JUthergi> jr must've heard fox tell about daddy now losing in PA &amp; GA too!
1324718451194212352 2020-11-06 22:21:05 +0800 <JUthergi> jr jr jr, you just don't get it.
1324716393548361728 2020-11-06 22:12:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news!  Biden takes lead in both GA &amp; PA!  trump refuses to accept  the election results, he thought he had it rigged!  Claiming fraud bc everyone is out to get him, trump declares  Martial Law?  until he alone fix voters that betrayed him!  What? Sorry, no ML yet!
1324713246763425793 2020-11-06 22:00:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Amendment Day yet???
1324712068294053889 2020-11-06 21:55:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Da
1324502257694580736 2020-11-06 08:02:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Did trump just tell us he got his dirty tricks training at the dem school? Does maga know yet he was once a dem but couldn't win nominations in 88 96 00?
1324498542539476992 2020-11-06 07:47:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh eric, people all across this land are fighting fraud. You can see it happening.  Q for you is whether you can wrangle immunity for tell all or do you wait for vanky&amp;jare to blame all past crime/fraud on you? Your, not you're like your tweet should have said, in big trouble!
1324496249479979009 2020-11-06 07:38:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone know if deutsch bank called trump's loan yet? Seize assets yet? Clinging to hope...
1324491655676919808 2020-11-06 07:19:53 +0800 <JUthergi> PLEASE!
1324491356262277124 2020-11-06 07:18:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Will it be difficult pretending you won moving forward as pres with no plan for next 4 yrs? (fearful that he will come out claiming martial law &amp; no new elections until he alone can fix the rigged system...he ain't going peacefully!)
1324488564906876929 2020-11-06 07:07:36 +0800 <JUthergi> What happens if we refuse to watch?   Will you still give him free air time?
1324482821927428098 2020-11-06 06:44:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like something a leader would do?
1324482083314651137 2020-11-06 06:41:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Still here? Seems like an awful long time since this trump virus was to miraculously disappear. No worries though bc those vaccines &amp; therapeutics trump promised momentarily &amp; are being distributed by our powerful army. Oh, not yet?  Never mind me, but  PAY ATTENTION to the docs!
1324480326828249088 2020-11-06 06:34:52 +0800 <JUthergi> At least they're consistent, excepting of course flip floppery on issues of import to WTP...
1324461200344784899 2020-11-06 05:18:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step and looks like he's still trying! This ain't no potomac two step!
1324460765470957570 2020-11-06 05:17:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! I thought trump said a ballot is only a legal vote if you use a sharpie, &amp; must vote for him! Did I miss again?  Can I revote if trump wins?  My ballot was illegal, right?
1324458269910409224 2020-11-06 05:07:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper 1st rat to leave ship? Not sure bc kelly anne con job just mysteriously disappeared?
1324434221453160448 2020-11-06 03:31:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Translation out of doublespeak: If a vote is not for me then it is not legal!
1324432849567711232 2020-11-06 03:26:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Clinging to hope...
1324372714279284739 2020-11-05 23:27:15 +0800 <JUthergi> More obstruction of gov process? Tell us something new, like impeachment of mc cons all is imminent?
1324371819932061702 2020-11-05 23:23:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Impeach mc cons all?
1324371345963102208 2020-11-05 23:21:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone seen the melanoma?  After seeing so many  trumpy bear tweets flagged today as misleading, it seems like a good chance for her &amp; Barron to hit the ground running!
1324367810869559298 2020-11-05 23:07:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey! The pres said that the virus would disappear, again, after election day!  Do you think you can report on this hoax just bc 240k American Citizens died or 9m infected miraculously?  Oh, the guy that called the virus a hoax is the real hoax?  That makes much more sense.   TY!
1324362660033548290 2020-11-05 22:47:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Waiting for the pic of:  "that look when your assets get seized"
1324011275068809216 2020-11-04 23:31:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Are we talking polling places, polls? Or we talking poles, does he mean like stripper poles?
1323778475891843073 2020-11-04 08:05:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump C'mon man! What a hammhead! The polling places just closed in the east &amp; you already turned on trump?
1323777193386872838 2020-11-04 08:00:52 +0800 <JUthergi> It's 7:00 pm edt &amp; polls are closing in the east.  Did trump claim victory yet?
1323766968646860800 2020-11-04 07:20:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @drdave1999 trump likely would have been the kid wi marbles but most other kids would've taken them to throw @ him until he ran home.  Kids could have saved the world 4 yrs it can't get back!  If only trump hadn't lost his marbles such a looonnnggg time ago?  What a world i imagine! TY!
1323756191462301696 2020-11-04 06:37:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Bravo! Best yet!
1323754312305135617 2020-11-04 06:29:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Election Day!  The only day we get to see the elected elite actually work up a sweat for their pay!  The day after, its back to managing their economic &amp; social controls over our lives...  Our work continues!
1323649896361197569 2020-11-03 23:35:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Wow! 3rd past President to endorse Biden/Harris!  Any past Presidents endorsing you?   Not even from your own party?   Do you think that they're sending WTP a message on who we should vote for?   Actions always speak louder than words, huh?
1323648371740020744 2020-11-03 23:28:58 +0800 <JUthergi> vanky? Did you resign as sr advisor to the pres? How sweet, to avoid any improprieties of a Sr Adm illegally campaigning for a politician, vanky quit just to support her daddy!!!  Such noble character &amp; integrity you've shown!  PS did you start packing yet?
1323646470470438912 2020-11-03 23:21:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Got any proof?
1323643404321017867 2020-11-03 23:09:14 +0800 <JUthergi> jr! you're up early today! Packing up for your move to thighland?
1323639939024769024 2020-11-03 22:55:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Abuse of power has become a norm under trump's lack of leadership...but in the bright side at least he is using a well regulated, Real Militia?
1323634451717509127 2020-11-03 22:33:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! Even fox can't believe him anymore?
1323633775650185221 2020-11-03 22:30:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Life imitates art?
1323629245126660103 2020-11-03 22:12:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... mc cons all has been our unstable (evil) genius playing trump all along?
1323624028091879426 2020-11-03 21:52:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @michele2435reis @msvespa @Fix8d2020 @WotanMars @realDonaldTrump As Calonice might say, "indeed we are", ya rascal! lol
1323622354669477891 2020-11-03 21:45:35 +0800 <JUthergi> ELECTION DAY 2020! May God bless us all!  We are the people of the United States of America.

1323411756522168320 2020-11-03 07:48:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr stable genius with good words,( hamberders cofeve united shhtates, thigh-land, hydro sonic super duper weabons, etc), got tired of succinctly presenting details of his plan, &amp; puts greatest gaffes of Biden vid up to talk for him!

Biden wants you dead/take your guns. Looters. rioters. antifa. Biden will lock you down. Want more $? Only me! I'm greatest bc I got 4 "noBLE piece" nominations,(no awards).
1323406849262190592 2020-11-03 07:29:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Election eve your crying about the crooks.  Bad Obama, Biden, Clinton etc, every time. Not one person you've accused of crimes had been charged.  How many now of your assoc, appointments, lawyers, friends &amp; emplys have been charged &amp; convicted?  Historical!
1323405549216632833 2020-11-03 07:24:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  oan says you have a massive team of lawyers to oversee a "potential" legal battle post election night? Deployed fed agents to oversee "possible" fraud &amp; irregularities? What i see is a massive expense of taxpayer $ as your only strategy to win! Still whining?
1323399843927199745 2020-11-03 07:01:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @evansrc717 @KlasfeldReports @hmbryan @lawcrimenews But won't it hurt the donnie? If he loses he could charged convicted and imprisoned where he could get hurt.  What nationality is that Judge? Lol!

1323392869927919617 2020-11-03 06:33:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Someone not afraid of trump's wrath within dem ranks needs to step up this game!  Oh, it's President Obama to save us all from detailed trump train turning the curve &amp; headed for the cliff!  What's that? No comeback donnie?  TY President Obama!
1323387820380196866 2020-11-03 06:13:38 +0800 <JUthergi> It is sundown with ever increasing darkness here in the East.  Did trump claim victory yet?  Keep voting!

My tweet was in resp to a great meme I missed. Cat reading military strategy bc no one ever should grab a kitty!
1323355069182599168 2020-11-03 04:03:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @msvespa @Fix8d2020 @WotanMars @realDonaldTrump Just wondering now, if trump wins how many men will have had sex for the last time, ever?  If you love sex don't vote for trump!
1323352195329335299 2020-11-03 03:52:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Woo hoo! Sure hope it's on tv!  Betting that jare &amp; vanky blame jr who turns on eric who tells all for immunity!  Tell @eric if he does we'll vote for him to be pres. He's gonna have to work hard since vanky the got daddy to kick the boys out of his Last Will &amp; Testament, right?

1323345629188411396 2020-11-03 03:25:59 +0800 <JUthergi> I might start watching their infotainment opinion shows. Not likely though, unless house/sen re-enact The Fairness Doctrine. But it's a start!
1323344648656605187 2020-11-03 03:22:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step
1323344469471711234 2020-11-03 03:21:22 +0800 <JUthergi> When you send your own teen daughter to Elite Modelling school run by trump epstein personal friend John casablancas...there is something wrong. I still think #MeToo needs to step up to help evil vanky, but likely too late to bring her peace.

1323313846468157442 2020-11-03 01:19:41 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's new ambassadors to WTP? (Apparently he is still having trouble relating to anyone making less than $1m per yr?)
1323313036577353728 2020-11-03 01:16:28 +0800 <JUthergi> But how can the elected elite Bal the budget if they don't steal from OUR soc sec?  Sorry, forgot that they really don't care about budgets when it's the money of WTP!
1323312061510754304 2020-11-03 01:12:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Time to change my ho auto, boat, rv, dirt bikes &amp; sleds, bye state farm!  Aapu, I'll miss your 6 day old cheesey dogs! Say hi to Homer for me cause ain't going back to 7 eleven!

1323304769042161665 2020-11-03 00:43:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @GeoffRBennett Is that like the "non-scalable" wall in Mexico-US Border. Right, I've seen several videos of people from Mexico not scaling up one side &amp; down the other side of this boondoggle of a trump donor CONtractor's wall!
1323302913905729538 2020-11-03 00:36:15 +0800 <JUthergi> If you remain undecided, please read more on trump's failures.
1323301911320285184 2020-11-03 00:32:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @thehill Most terrifying moment of Halloween Weekend!
1323299988613533697 2020-11-03 00:24:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Just imagine what his minions in the WH are doing to us!
1323299685155688448 2020-11-03 00:23:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget that her daddy's lawyer "contributed" to nyc DA campaign resulting in  criminal charges from over inflating val of condos to buyers &amp; lowering val of same condos to IRS &amp; Fincl institutions being dropped!  Coincidence? No! Pattern of nefarious dealings?
1323296754943565824 2020-11-03 00:11:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this a threat of what your daddy is planning to do Wednesday morning? C'mon jr, try to be honest, it only hurts a bit at first but you must have a smidgen of good from your mom's side?  The people will love you, you'll need it when vanky &amp; eric blame all the crimes on you!
1323295285024563200 2020-11-03 00:05:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Lol, did they know trumpy bear doesn't want to count all the votes?
1323294250352676864 2020-11-03 00:01:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @GOP Recovered 52% of jobs lost to virus? i'm confused, were all those positions filled to replace dead men &amp; women?  Maybe you folks are just too confusing, or crazy claiming like trump. Does not look good for you...
1323292095222816770 2020-11-02 23:53:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @Dbwagner104 Why can't the elected elite have a lifespan of a fly? Hmmm... like it!
1323291582016217089 2020-11-02 23:51:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @ProudSocialist Clinging to hope... Structural renovations are undoubtedly called for and can only be achieved by WTP.  The work is just beginning to end our gov of, by &amp; for corporate donors...
1323290656450764803 2020-11-02 23:47:32 +0800 <JUthergi> trumpy bear is the prime example of all that is wrong with our elected elite.  The system does need structural repairs.  Sitting "officials" are just as corrupt &amp; do just as much damage as trump but they are just quietly working their cons in the shadows.  Clinging to hope...
1323276598980812806 2020-11-02 22:51:41 +0800 <JUthergi> What about your own personal lawlessness? Why do we have to support Law &amp; Order if you guys don't?
1323275643778465792 2020-11-02 22:47:53 +0800 <JUthergi> What? Another trump fiasco?
1323273554855665666 2020-11-02 22:39:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Rounding a curve heading right to the cliff. This guy really is jealous of the attn his virus gets over him.  Now he wants to fire a true genius of science for telling truth? step by step he dismantles OUR REPUBLIC and destroys our ideals, time to crush the disease that is trump!
1323272073595228162 2020-11-02 22:33:42 +0800 <JUthergi> When? Can WTP watch?
1323271936080781312 2020-11-02 22:33:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Hooray for Dr Fauci! Someone had to tell the wannabe king he had no clothes on!
1323270320485208064 2020-11-02 22:26:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Most elected seek endorsements from respected party members or even past presidents. Y'all have no one of credible character, hundreds of past officials in daddy's admin have come out against him. Doj lawyers, med pros etc all against him.  But yea! You got an athlete, again?
1323268844249620482 2020-11-02 22:20:52 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP are not of the hubris of our elected, we are strong enough to ADMIT OUR GREATEST MISTAKE!
1323267585165709315 2020-11-02 22:15:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @PeteButtigieg @dazyjane410 Can blood sucking vampires even see themselves in a mirror?  Clinging to hope here...
1323266687974723584 2020-11-02 22:12:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @MastersonTx First read of it in Sarah Kendzior's book. Hiding in plain sight. Excellent research and summation of step by step actions of our criminals history.
1323266003917221889 2020-11-02 22:09:35 +0800 <JUthergi> If only there were true Statesmen that valued their oath to the US Constitution &amp; WTP...
1323261372935872513 2020-11-02 21:51:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Y'all got trumped?
1323259202828144644 2020-11-02 21:42:33 +0800 <JUthergi> mc con all seems to be outshining his minion, don the con? Need a lil ego boost mitchie?
1323256163757133825 2020-11-02 21:30:29 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and the virus produced little viruses, then the little viruses produced more until it destroyed the suburbs.
1323254435523514369 2020-11-02 21:23:36 +0800 <JUthergi> It's been reported that trump made a deal with US Gov to AVOID paying taxes for 30 yrs.
1323058656154451969 2020-11-02 08:25:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Led by their stable genius the elected elite was absolutely dumfounded at what happened to their own $ cons of the American People...
1323056217556733952 2020-11-02 08:15:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...trying to tell y'all!
1323056045296619520 2020-11-02 08:15:17 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and switch to beer commercials.
1323055509751083008 2020-11-02 08:13:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Knew he wasn't tall!
1323055052060327937 2020-11-02 08:11:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Aha! Knew I could find a voice of reason! Can't wait for your book !
1323053447843704832 2020-11-02 08:04:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Mighty crowded in there!  Did that virus miraculously disappear and you didn't tell your followers?  Oh eric.
1323052400312242176 2020-11-02 08:00:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Whole story sounds like the narcissistic tv producer awoke from a dream and played it out!
1323051723934601216 2020-11-02 07:58:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Wouldn't it be great if saying the name t-r-u-m-p became likened to a nasty curse word that requires users to put $ in the swear jar?  You voted for who? Ha you got royally trumped! You voted for him too so trump you! Oh trump! Forgot my wife's birthday! Step in dog trump again?
1323050165784203271 2020-11-02 07:51:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trump already claiming victory?
1323049472469946369 2020-11-02 07:49:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Worth a reminder, seems many of us still don't get the while picture?  https://t.co/qhR17Hkv21
1323048043718025223 2020-11-02 07:43:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Trump was born in Germany right? He never showed his birth certificate and his dad was kkk. Think he's a decendant of that guy he mimics, I think his name was dolf? No. Adolf, that's it!  trump is a descendant of Adolph Hitler and he can't prove he's not!!  Oh no!  Pay attn! VOTE
1323043086008786944 2020-11-02 07:23:47 +0800 <JUthergi> After all his campaigns to stay our of prison, he just looks too old &amp; tired &amp; beaten to lead anyone anywhere...
1323042479969587200 2020-11-02 07:21:22 +0800 <JUthergi> I wonder if the geniuses stopping traffic across the old Tappan Zee/MC Bridge realize that it may not be designed to handle the added structural stressors of stalled traffic? Disaster on the Hudson? Thanks trump, 230k &amp; counting!!!
1323041305300262914 2020-11-02 07:16:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Why doesn't mass media cover this &amp; trumpy baby balloon in ME.?
1323040725513183232 2020-11-02 07:14:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Can you call the UN for us?  We have not one member of our elected elite that does not fear the wrath of our lil trumpy bear!  Got any trained grizzlies that would wear an ugly orange toupee for us?  Thinking it would be a good body double his supporters won't recognize...
1323038148528640000 2020-11-02 07:04:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Stealing in plain sight? Haven't y'all southern gents been doing that for...decades?  Bless yer lil heart !
1323037435278905346 2020-11-02 07:01:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are you still in office you hopping lil hypocrite! Resign now before you get dragged out on your  rubenesque derriere!
1323035438903382019 2020-11-02 06:53:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  It is a terrible decision by scotus that all votes count? The world will be upset if they don't know on election night? If people wanted their ballots in they should have done it months ago? Did the virus disappear months ago? Was postal equip vandalized ? HELP!
1323032060085391364 2020-11-02 06:39:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast Who ever he is I'll bet a constipation product selling company could do great with him as spokesman!
1323031157072666629 2020-11-02 06:36:23 +0800 <JUthergi> No irony here as she tries to relate to "the working people" with diamonds &amp; an outfit costing more than most WTP can earn in a year with daddy's economy!  I hope eric rats you out to SDNY for your picking on him so mercilessly...
1323030074824757250 2020-11-02 06:32:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like a bad case of y'all queda isitus?
1323027021828640768 2020-11-02 06:19:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @JohnLukeSam1 He's out for glory. Almost ran in 88 &amp; 96 but couldn't twist enough arms to get nominated. Actual runs in 00 12 16 &amp; 20. Enough already!
1323026010082824202 2020-11-02 06:15:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Did you choose the Genesis song at GA rally with lyrics "if you were drowning I would not lend a hand" specifically as your official good bye Screw You for WTP, for not re- electing you? Rockefeller &amp; Nixon manned up to say it and fly the birds right at us!
1322960676730638337 2020-11-02 01:56:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step... Dump trump before he completes our gas chambers!

1322955497868267520 2020-11-02 01:35:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey genius wannabe?  Hasn't it occured to you yet that there are working American Citizens in every state?   Have you ever considered that demicans live in red states &amp; republicats live in the blue states?  Shheesh! Don't your advertiser's believe in one America either?
1322953243983577088 2020-11-02 01:26:47 +0800 <JUthergi> She is amazing in her presentations!
1322953018128687104 2020-11-02 01:25:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Long road ahead but this guy @ point has good instinct!   #WTPstructuralrenovations
1322950220817305600 2020-11-02 01:14:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @CathyNotToday @AngrierWHStaff But trumpy bear gets a good feeling that it will all disappear, like a miracle! my GOD! What have we done?
1322949474906460161 2020-11-02 01:11:48 +0800 <JUthergi> This very moment trump is saying he saved so many lives and now his virus is going away. "China stopped it from spreading from Wuhan", (but he couldn't stop spread from 1 city?) Claims saved lives as virus shatters all previous damage from spring, simply incomprehensible!
1322946626151919616 2020-11-02 01:00:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Bankruptcy is &amp; always has been part of the trump biz plan. He is using the same plan for America...
1322945886037704707 2020-11-02 00:57:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, you just told MI, pandering to working man voter, that you are not a politician.  But FEC Records confirm you considered running for President in '88 &amp; '96. You actually ran in '00 '12 '16 &amp; now! Is this is another win for you bc you now lie to us &gt;1x/min?
1322943342817218561 2020-11-02 00:47:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Structural renovations and upgrades need to be designed by WTP, and the work may well be overwhelming.  Endeavor to persevere!
1322942527796903939 2020-11-02 00:44:12 +0800 <JUthergi> trump?
1322939793928540161 2020-11-02 00:33:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Our stable genius
1322936635969982464 2020-11-02 00:20:47 +0800 <JUthergi> ...and after 230k more deaths of American Citizens not even a moment of silence?
1322930880998944778 2020-11-01 23:57:55 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Sarah Kendzior! Great read!  Your insight as just one of WTP that spent many years studying the rise of autocratic rule &amp; it's leaders should be taught in all curriculums. Hope to hear this mom get nominated as sec, of ed., (once we disolve our Orwellian Ministry of Info.!)
1322923926650003457 2020-11-01 23:30:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Please share...
1322921063190323206 2020-11-01 23:18:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Just like with the trump virus, stop testing &amp; it disappears! Don't count votes &amp; Biden/Harris disappear, right?  Well, not if we VOTE for the preservation of OUR REPUBLIC!
1322690405079650304 2020-11-01 08:02:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Are there more people at the rally than the number of people dead from the trump virus? Because, daddy's plan for our future is all about crowd size! Why is that I wonder?  PS were you a tough guy like daddy in SDNY deposition, hmmm eric??? Did you tell all? vanky blames you &amp; jr
1322689116673290240 2020-11-01 07:57:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Not sure bc the image of trump, after pvtly meeting putin in Helsinki, looked like a little boy after being sent to the principle's office! Can't un-see that one!
1322687611069210624 2020-11-01 07:51:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @texaslawdog101 @realDonaldTrump Step by step...
1322686997970997248 2020-11-01 07:48:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Still didn't vote yet? Just take a look below if you're undecided on how best to serve your country.
1322685674596798465 2020-11-01 07:43:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @BY1959 @googlenews Time for another bike rally in Sturgis yet?
1322685173897613312 2020-11-01 07:41:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @el_perro_crema @TimInHonolulu @TheDemocrats Odd isn't it how putin was able to speak of their hyper sonic weapons, then shortly thereafter trump starts talking of his super duper weapons?  Then he brags again, but to trump the weapons are incredibly unbelievable &amp; terrifically tremendous hydro sonic! Like a toothbrush?
1322684103511183363 2020-11-01 07:37:19 +0800 <JUthergi> State secrets are a commodity to be sold for a profit in the trump admin. That's why he was adamant about getting sec clearances for vanky &amp; jare! Are making the connections yet?
1322682056787300352 2020-11-01 07:29:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1322681867234103296 2020-11-01 07:28:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step...
1322677392025001986 2020-11-01 07:10:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like there's only room for one over confident idiot to control the president's thinking, right jare?
1322676125907255298 2020-11-01 07:05:37 +0800 <JUthergi> trump in PA babbling about  insane dangers to fear, then tells people it's ok if you want to run through the streets smashing windows looting if Biden is pres bc Biden supposedly allows it, then seemingly realizing he just loosed his crazies, almost whispers, but not ok w/ me?
1322667172938874880 2020-11-01 06:30:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Tough guys don't pretend to be war time leaders, then quit!  WTP are dying bc of the  C19 virus, and trump claims he defeated it as an accomplishment in WH press release!
1322663865788878848 2020-11-01 06:16:54 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mr Huffman! Take this man's warning!   trump keeps attacking our RIGHTS TO ASSEMBLY!  His attacks on our liberties &amp; institutions is a multi pronged approach to his DICTATORIAL RULE!  It has become our CIVIC DUTY to VOTE HIM OUT!   WTP must unite against   the enemy within!
1322659030322597890 2020-11-01 05:57:41 +0800 <JUthergi> We're the police "just following orders"?  Authorities have already built "holding facilities" &amp; separated m from w &amp; children from mothers...  All sounds so familiar for some reason.  Did the AUTHORITIES BUILD our GAS CHAMBERS, yet?  This is how it's done, step by step!  VOTE!!!
1322654816364044289 2020-11-01 05:40:56 +0800 <JUthergi> The old "if they throw us out we'll stick it to 'em" play? That mitch!
1322653321254129664 2020-11-01 05:35:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Let us show all people that our country was born bc of tyrannical rule &amp; a disbelief that all men are created equal.  WTP hold to the ideals of unalienable rights. WTP will persevere.  We will change the course, we know we were conned.  Change is coming, for the good of all man
1322649129454096384 2020-11-01 05:18:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Hold on to her love!
1322589356599771141 2020-11-01 01:20:49 +0800 <JUthergi> What if you're the pres of a country and have already personally purchased the majority of the actual product stock of medicines for resale at grotesque profits? That's ok right?
1322581441713262593 2020-11-01 00:49:22 +0800 <JUthergi> From the people that know the trump's best of all, his home state!  Oh, I forgot that he suddenly moved to Fl. Curiouser &amp; curiouser...
1322576292085174272 2020-11-01 00:28:54 +0800 <JUthergi> It's been said that people are best known by the company they keep. Good example shown below
1322575501123330048 2020-11-01 00:25:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Wm Shakespeare had a great idea too!
1322574897273593862 2020-11-01 00:23:22 +0800 <JUthergi> One coincidence? Two coincidences a pattern when dealing with nefarious characters or circumstances.
1322574003618357254 2020-11-01 00:19:49 +0800 <JUthergi> No call for a remembrance of the 245k dead American Citizens or the 8m American Citizens infected by the virus he let in to this country?  Perhaps WTP, on Thanksgiving Day, we could all just stop EVERYTHING we are doing to pray for our dead? Total shutdown?  1m @ 1200h EDT?
1322565584001900544 2020-10-31 23:46:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Does it become difficult to count numbers as we age, sir?   You said 500 miles of wall, on a 2k border, would be built by year end, but you do say a lot of things we know you don't mean...  what are plans for the remaining 1500 miles of open border?
1322282899329208321 2020-10-31 05:03:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Things people say for the rating gods they worship?
1322272385463160834 2020-10-31 04:21:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step so we don't notice, then BOOM!!!  Autocratic Rule!  That sob will probably all make us act like North Koreans under threat of death!  KEEP VOTING!!!
1322271151968628741 2020-10-31 04:16:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Hooray!  Go on tour so big boy trump can finally achieve the elusive crowd size he craves since inauguration humiliation!  Call that spicer guy so he can finally report the truth about crowd size!  How can we get one?
1322268378879397893 2020-10-31 04:05:22 +0800 <JUthergi> But we're supposed to slow the testing down!  Does he know about this mutiny???  Oh, well it is the least y'all can do after infecting those folks at all the damned rallies!
1322266638885027841 2020-10-31 03:58:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @BarryVictor5 Shouldn't it be disbanded after it's leaders are convicted &amp; imprisoned?
1322266340204384256 2020-10-31 03:57:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Good one eric!  Now that you endorsed her she'll lose and some dem will win, all because you just can't keep it shut!
1322264926837219330 2020-10-31 03:51:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news!  ruby ghouliani, fearing imminent indictments by several fed agencies &amp; SDNY rolls over on his boss in attempt to negotiate his way out of life in prison!!!  See his statement &amp; trump's reaction below!  trump, 1st time ever is speechless! More to come!  (TY TLP!!!)
1322261998621609990 2020-10-31 03:40:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @stuart_dolan The only stimulus this guy will take up is a good swift kick in the ass, preferably by Wisconsin's Red Foreman!!!
1322260238179966978 2020-10-31 03:33:01 +0800 <JUthergi> We're tired too!   Don't be decieved by the carnival barking buffoon persona.  He is a dangerous heartless coldly calculating tyrannical wannabe dictator.  Even those closest to him have reported these same personal opinions...
1322258972389314560 2020-10-31 03:28:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @didikins4life @13speedOD Wow! Is my nightmare over? What? It's still 2020?!  TY ma'am, i used to believe this, as an idealistic child. However, as an idealistic adult i clinging to hope for a structural renovation of this gov of corps, by corps for corps. WTP have more work to do than most would imagine!
1322257021366898689 2020-10-31 03:20:14 +0800 <JUthergi> daddy loves you!?
1322255997554098181 2020-10-31 03:16:10 +0800 <JUthergi> She's gotta be around 55-57 yrs old by now, right?  Maybe after retraining she can restart Elite Modelling for her deceased "uncle" john casablancas? After "auntie" ghislaine gets out she can be of great help in recruiting!
1322252183086239746 2020-10-31 03:01:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Been searching for those nice white jackets with the extended sleeves and series if straps on the back, hoping to gift it to dear leader... apparently they don't have his size?
1322220680621031425 2020-10-31 00:55:50 +0800 <JUthergi> They are politically appointed subservient party members.  They are appointed by the same greed motivated absolutely corrupt elected elite that got us into this mess in the first place!  KEEP VOTING!!!
1322219400846544896 2020-10-31 00:50:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Aaarrrrgggggghhhhh!!!
1322219029038333952 2020-10-31 00:49:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Persistent, eh? Also CREDIBLE!  (That means         BELIEVABLE!)
1322217917849755655 2020-10-31 00:44:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet?
1322216831147515905 2020-10-31 00:40:32 +0800 <JUthergi> She killed her husband in June? Is this trump's sister-in- law?
1322215430514188289 2020-10-31 00:34:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @JohnLukeSam1 @realDonaldTrump Please consider that any vote not counted is an affront to our Democratic Republic. It also gives the autocracy contrived legal stand for challenge.
1322214203323809793 2020-10-31 00:30:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Cool, new Orwellian Doublespeak!  Baseless rumours spread by those so badly needing attention, not reported in the entertainment info shows must now be referred to as MEDIA BLACKOUT.  That is all.
1322192994074841095 2020-10-30 23:05:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Why don't the trump's holler about this? Aren't they all about Law &amp; Order? lol
1322192148746457088 2020-10-30 23:02:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh look! trump posted a pic of himself just like the one from the George Orwell's 1984 at his rally!  Nothing like subliminal advertising to force subservience to the trumpy party!!!
1322185881634177025 2020-10-30 22:37:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Ghouliani probably can't find those either, even if they dropped from the sky onto his head...
1322180328858013701 2020-10-30 22:15:29 +0800 <JUthergi> How dare he offend the great white dope?  i know, the goofy boorish babbling buffoon act by trump is just to distract us from his destruction of OUR REPUBLIC, but he mocks us everyday by being in what was once a place of honor.
1322178573659230214 2020-10-30 22:08:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Can we confiscate his passport?  WTP can have the most memorable party in the history of our country on election night!  DUMP THE CHUMP called trump!!!
1322171136252194817 2020-10-30 21:38:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps a suit also against each member of the house/sen pres &amp; cabinet, individually, so their assets can be seized to fund healthcare programs?  Somehow they must be accountable for their willful negligence!  likely already passed laws to "hold them harmless" from liab.
1322164607931342848 2020-10-30 21:13:01 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mr Olbermann!  Incomprehensible how any sitting cabinet members could witness this catastrophic failure of leadership and refuse to draft a letter that could save OUR REPUBLIC, unless each one is complicit in this path to autocracy...  Is it 25th Ammendment Day, yet???
1322160585191075842 2020-10-30 20:57:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Stable genius with a good brain has been rounding so many corners he running in circles...
1321951845628153858 2020-10-30 07:07:35 +0800 <JUthergi> We are the new expendables...
1321949688019509248 2020-10-30 06:59:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like they went to jared. He just said that!
1321949373912240130 2020-10-30 06:57:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @BlurryBitsPhoto @kathy_eisel @TheRealHoarse At 60yr of age I don't have any friends or family that ever wrote, called, or showed up for local gov meetings to address idiocracy of our "representatives". Yep! i'm still the crazy one, but i did graduate to crazy ol geezer!  Is CIVIC DUTY even taught anymore?
1321947626456174593 2020-10-30 06:50:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Never thought I would say this, so many immigrant's try so hard to assimilate by learning English, but speak English melanoma!  14 months later she finally plays loving wifey on campaign trail...ain't that love?
1321945666243993602 2020-10-30 06:43:02 +0800 <JUthergi> pre-nup requires she vote for him or she gets nothing?
1321929321670414339 2020-10-30 05:38:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Especially now in light of the lung cancer clusters adjacent to fracking wells. Even big oil is transitioning after recognizing the profits  they can reap from sustainable energies. Remember, oil/frack lobbyists bought &amp; paid for our gov for decades now...
1321924601211953153 2020-10-30 05:19:19 +0800 <JUthergi> All part of the trump plan...
1321922370634977287 2020-10-30 05:10:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @kristyj72 @navywife53sco @IngrahamAngle laura who?
1321921346457272321 2020-10-30 05:06:23 +0800 <JUthergi> This ought to be added to school curriculums, for centuries to come...
1321919579044618247 2020-10-30 04:59:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Considering his decades old relationships with Russian ambassadors, oligarchs &amp; financiers well, yeah!
1321919108573810688 2020-10-30 04:57:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking! Afraid Floridians will not vote for him he orders crowd to be sprayed with deadly virus then threatens the spray team!!?
1321917850752225281 2020-10-30 04:52:30 +0800 <JUthergi> The wuss in chief?
1321848708640788480 2020-10-30 00:17:45 +0800 <JUthergi> what this man speaks of as a warning is already taking place as part of trump's plan. trump looks forward to economic collapse and rioting to burn the country down in order to get back to what thinks were great times.  PLEASE spread this video mssg!  WTP must stand against him!
1321844318571794432 2020-10-30 00:00:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast @rmojomojito1 Rhetorical question?
1321843095533686786 2020-10-29 23:55:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  You been yelling about this for years. You got your chance!  4 yrs later i just have to ask, HOW could you possibly do that?  WHEN the hell do you start???
1321840085780860928 2020-10-29 23:43:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks more like the conjob witch?
1321839664463052807 2020-10-29 23:41:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  Hey jr! Are you hiding the proof from us now so you can release them when you try appointing yourself pres?  What did i tell you about crying wolf?
1321838198683783169 2020-10-29 23:35:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @sarahkendzior Thank you Sarah Kendzior for confirming &amp; piecing together the long history of trump stone &amp; cohn plan to destroy this country!
1321832923834863617 2020-10-29 23:15:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this yet another attempt to take away our right to free assembly?
1321831654298562561 2020-10-29 23:09:59 +0800 <JUthergi> ...anyone, anywhere on this entire planet.  He is going down &amp; he'll take us with him.  Does he start war with Iran before or after losing election?
1321829348027043840 2020-10-29 23:00:49 +0800 <JUthergi> But trump has the best infrastructure plan in the history of our country. Best ever in the whole world! Better than the Romans, right?  What? trump never delivered his infrastructure plan?  How could that be?   he gave us his healthcare plan though didn't he?  i'm so confused...
1321827772566851585 2020-10-29 22:54:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step the autocrat dismantles OUR REPUBLIC.  Good read on his corruption of agencies we look to for protections.
1321588066558029825 2020-10-29 07:02:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Thanks Conor! Kudos to you, to your parents, your friends and their parents and your whole generation!!!  DUMP THE CHUMP called trump &amp; forever be known as the generation that saved OUR REPUBLIC!
1321586843117408256 2020-10-29 06:57:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe Dr Trump would offer some of hers? Would absolute irrefutable proof of rape convince people not to support him?  Oh, am so foolishly hopeful but...forgot about maga people!
1321585881208311809 2020-10-29 06:53:22 +0800 <JUthergi> I liked beer too but never thought I would want to be on scotus! The stuff kills brain cells, must also have an hallucinating affect in fear boys?
1321585111704477697 2020-10-29 06:50:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Is today 25th Ammendment Day?????
1321584874252390400 2020-10-29 06:49:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Now the pd knows what it's like to work for trump.
1321579851472666624 2020-10-29 06:29:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump  sir, to be credible you must show proof. Gop sen found none. It's ok, we all think that's our incredibly unbelievable tremendously terrific stable genius using his good words to substitute for good hard work! But hey. It is what it is bc you are what you are.
1321577640537608192 2020-10-29 06:20:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Remember the Patriot Act? The gov fears WTP will expose decades of corruption at our expense and they started making GESTAPO TACTICS legal and subject to interpretation by guys like sessions &amp; bar!  Our only weapon is peaceful resistance &amp; self policing would be violent looters.
1321574165640630273 2020-10-29 06:06:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @cooperchip1 Better late than never?
1321573998724108288 2020-10-29 06:06:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Impartiality? Will it be no longer required of our judicial system? Oh boy! Right in time for Halloween, we can burn witches again?  There goes one now! Proof? We don't need no proof she looks like one, right?
1321567102701064195 2020-10-29 05:38:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Been waiting so long for this guy! Great book!  Thank you Mr Taylor! Could your next book be about barr&amp;trump administration's abuse of Patriot Act?  WTP need to see the import of the elected elite attempts to keep WTP divided. TY
1321498908254785545 2020-10-29 01:07:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Another wolf jr? i meant it when i told you to read Peter &amp; The Wolf! You can't just keep spewing vitriol to get daddy's approval. There's 1m more...did you see it? Count it?  No proof, no truth, no wolf!  What's your take on 230k+ dead by dad?  your red wave is the blood of WTP!
1321495237362176002 2020-10-29 00:53:11 +0800 <JUthergi> As every living thing on this earth adapts to survive, so must man &amp; it's constructs...  Our framework remains intact, a living document that is our blueprint to control the system 4 the benefit of WTP.  We will never change the corruptable nature of man, so we adapt the system.
1321491857763950592 2020-10-29 00:39:45 +0800 <JUthergi> An opportunity to reconsider the security of paper ballots &amp; the machines that recorded them.  If a computer is programmed by one man, it can be hacked by another...
1321479747721900032 2020-10-28 23:51:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Fake news? Totally infected with the trump virus hoax, entertainment show DUMPS THE CHUMP called trump in favor of his opponent?  #ageofbewilderment
1321478425647992833 2020-10-28 23:46:23 +0800 <JUthergi> TY! A great description of WTP, not just in Michigan but across this great land!

1321464975085502464 2020-10-28 22:52:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Florida ready to DUMP THE CHUMP called trump!
1321463802634899459 2020-10-28 22:48:16 +0800 <JUthergi> jr, what is wrong with you? Fear mongering about what you think will happen on jobs? Are you so self absorbed in seeking approval that you're unaware that your daddy has killed more Americans than all our wars together?  Have you ever spoken truth?
1321458285581664262 2020-10-28 22:26:21 +0800 <JUthergi> C'mon chuckie! Don't just tweet about it develop a plan yourselves! You elected elite play your blame games while our country bleeds.   Do something or go home!
1321456906087661574 2020-10-28 22:20:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Feeling abondoned by your pres, yet?  Don't worry. The feeling will disappear one day like a miracle!
1321456048436355074 2020-10-28 22:17:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Ugh. It is most distasteful to rt something by this entertainment guy, but his info is correct.  trump VIRUS WILL GET WORSE!  No worries though, trump's war is over now bc virus is magically disappearing?
1321208497191686145 2020-10-28 05:53:47 +0800 <JUthergi> I was asked why trump would run in 2016. After due consideration with the logic of occam's razor I could only conclude one thing. trump was broke again and somehow politicians get to write off campaign exp as loss. Never truly comprehended that he could steal our cookie jar too!
1321202399994875907 2020-10-28 05:29:33 +0800 <JUthergi> TY for showing the true lil lindsie! SC citizens have had the truth hidden for too long! These proud people will help us all by crushing the crackers graham!
1321171682762121223 2020-10-28 03:27:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't there some law where you arrest people who are a grave danger to the public when they run around spouting craziness? Isn't there supposed to be men in white coats that can put the dangerous one in a straight jacket? WTP would gladly pay for a nice white cushioned room.
1321169819329269761 2020-10-28 03:20:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he part the seas yet?
1321167872710893570 2020-10-28 03:12:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be losing polls in MI.? He also has to protect militia buddies.
1321167341812633604 2020-10-28 03:10:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @Fahrenthold @sharnettereese1 @realDonaldTrump Could you add a separate item for his campaigning on our tax dollars? AF 1 costs alone must be close to $1b? TY
1321162336443473920 2020-10-28 02:50:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @donwinslow Isn't harvard that wannabe wealthy club that pretends to be a school since 70s?
1321161714944118793 2020-10-28 02:47:53 +0800 <JUthergi> We're they waiting for him to change or did they figure that by waiting this long they could avoid public scrutiny and wrath of donnie?
1321161041322147841 2020-10-28 02:45:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @Getsmart4 It is so easy to talk tough about what a great job you would do if you were in charge of a pandemic, until you get there &amp; your incompetence kills 1/4m people in &lt;9 months, did I get that right deadly donnie? Oops, my bad that guy never takes responsibility for anything.
1321156059126484994 2020-10-28 02:25:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Unfortunately, this joke is on us, and donnie destructo is laughing all the way to the bank.
1321153325312712705 2020-10-28 02:14:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Rounding a corner...&amp; heading right off a cliff! Oh why can't trump be a leader and jump first?
1321112556266790914 2020-10-27 23:32:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Lawyers pray?
1321112311759835136 2020-10-27 23:31:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Better yet is to take MI Ballots directly to drop boxes at your local BOE
1321110645920698369 2020-10-27 23:24:57 +0800 <JUthergi> That's not good for lil lindsie, oh too bad!
1321104013480386567 2020-10-27 22:58:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Fake news jr!!! This was a meeting to tell the people that a vote for trump is like a vote for andrew jackson! Remember him? Started the whole Indigenous American Genocide thingy?
1321101255163392001 2020-10-27 22:47:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Oh boy! Look at how much winning you have accomplished, sir!!!
1321099885656027137 2020-10-27 22:42:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Likely to allow doj to rep him in rape case when he brings recent ruling against him to his subservient new judge...
1321095682003030021 2020-10-27 22:25:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't that why ACB is new scotus judge, hired for subservient nature?
1321094626766426114 2020-10-27 22:21:18 +0800 <JUthergi> But YOU said we shouldn't be moving to nominate a judge in the last term of a pres. YOU said that it shouldn't be done even if it was a republican pres.!!!  Why did you lie to us?
1321093403476664320 2020-10-27 22:16:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Any chance you could lead us in a petition to gov to fire mitch mc con all? TY
1321092880275001347 2020-10-27 22:14:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Reading my copy now! Sarah K makes it all so clear!
1321091643781644290 2020-10-27 22:09:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Since when do qualifications matter to the trump regime?
1321090746771013632 2020-10-27 22:05:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Got DNA donnie?
1321090402863239171 2020-10-27 22:04:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @DanWhitCongress @marcorubio For regular folks, of course.  This is about the predator elite &amp; they're self entitled to make up their own rules, right?
1321089234950914048 2020-10-27 21:59:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr!  Don't you see the dichotomy of terms here? One simply cannot vote for Law &amp; Order and your family crime syndicate at the same time.  PS wasn't the shooter a trump supporter?
1321086829148426240 2020-10-27 21:50:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Rounding the turn, right off a cliff! Why, oh why can't our war time pres lead &amp; go first?
1321083851855323136 2020-10-27 21:38:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @marylferris1 @realDonaldTrump Trump IS virus?
1321081629230641152 2020-10-27 21:29:39 +0800 <JUthergi> l'il marco seems to be trying awful hard to convince us of the "legitimacy" of this shameless abuse of power.  Never forget!  WTP must unite against a gov that has no regard for our needs...
1320856051680530434 2020-10-27 06:33:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Great Work! But it is truly a sad state of affairs to think that not one trump supporter will read this. Even more disheartening is the question of how many could actually read &amp; comprehend...
1320853402432294914 2020-10-27 06:22:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget the lack of courage by the twin sister party, the dems.  It's the elected predator elite against WTP!  NEVER FORGET THIS! Please!
1320852314777915393 2020-10-27 06:18:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Do you get rid of elected elite that convinced scotus to vote for 2010 citizens united or rid us of scotus that politically approved it?  Either way you violate predator elite oath by Lewis Powell. Ca.1972?
1320850782330257408 2020-10-27 06:12:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Is dumbfuckification a word? Could be a great new verb to describe the trump admin?
1320850152500977665 2020-10-27 06:09:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Did trump cut his testicles off for the botched smear the Biden's campaign?  Presuming of course that rudy hasn't transitioned from being ruby. He looked so great in that dress he wore for pic with trump!
1320848885351415809 2020-10-27 06:04:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @Themed_Teams @seanhannity TY TT been trying to get this message out everytime he says red wave! Keep it going!
1320848069609619458 2020-10-27 06:01:34 +0800 <JUthergi> The only love this despicable donnie gets must be bought!  Pay suburban women $130k each, (going rate, right?), that might get you a few votes.  Certainly most will women would rather  spend $ saving their families from the trump virus!!!
1320846911365144576 2020-10-27 05:56:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Gee mitchie, did you fail again to protect employers from liability if unsafe workplace during trump virus kills us? You telling us you failed again to grant liability waivers to big pharma if their botched therapies &amp; vaccines kill us?  WTP don't want you &amp; now big pharma?  Bye!
1320844772064534531 2020-10-27 05:48:28 +0800 <JUthergi> A new day has dawned! mc con all just figured out the trump virus is out of control. Although he stopped USPS from delivering masks for all he is now pretending to care. Notice how he hides to protect self from wh people bc unsafe practice yet does nothing for KY? Or any of WTP?
1320842836812726273 2020-10-27 05:40:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Every living thing on Mother Earth must adapt &amp; change to survive. How is it that man is so ignorantly arrogant that he believes no adaption of ourselves is necessary &amp; cannot see Earth's Natural Response to a virus that is us?
1320840307982958599 2020-10-27 05:30:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Gee, sorry i missed your great interview, 8s this a good summary of what i missed. You the rule!
1320839250594680834 2020-10-27 05:26:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Best characterization of ghouliani yet! Kudos to the artist!
1320755884633542659 2020-10-26 23:55:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Why claim all these companies returning to US but tefuse to give us just one name we can verify. Same with mnfctrng claim, we've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs but you claim the opposite w/o naming one company hiring.  Recalls from lay offs due to trump virus don't count!
1320751506006659075 2020-10-26 23:37:52 +0800 <JUthergi> At this point I'd be happy to hear just one truth, about anything, from gov before I die...
1320750949233762304 2020-10-26 23:35:39 +0800 <JUthergi> So proud of his healthcare plan his secretary delivers it w/o statement? The long awaited incredibly unbelievable most tremendously terrific health plan in the history of mankind and the pres says nothing on introduction?  Is today April 1st?
1320748325310812162 2020-10-26 23:25:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news! God fearing American Citizens, horrified by trump's actions, gather to exorcize the evil demons rotting his mind.  Apparently they couldn't find his soul...
1320746111716495361 2020-10-26 23:16:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Is today 25th Ammendment Day?  Still no courage amongst the cabinet members?  By now aren't they giving aid &amp; comfort to the enemy, their boss, and therefore treasonous in their refusal to act?
1320742103685730312 2020-10-26 23:00:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking the term for this is The Peter Principle, where one rises to the level of their own glaring incompetence.
1320740079099383809 2020-10-26 22:52:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  What? apprentice faux celebrity got fired? There goes his moscow hotel.
1320738525034196993 2020-10-26 22:46:17 +0800 <JUthergi> None of us will matter if we don't all vote! Autocracy or Democracy? No brainer right, no one man can rule WTP, ever!
1320736116354502657 2020-10-26 22:36:42 +0800 <JUthergi> His path to autocracy.
1320735395294908416 2020-10-26 22:33:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Thanks for telling us that donnie pumpkin head!
1320734849498550273 2020-10-26 22:31:40 +0800 <JUthergi> On the road to autocracy...
1320733833734619136 2020-10-26 22:27:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Ikr? trump's can deal with Russia saudi arabia Egypt yemen qatar etc. International biz is for everyone.
1320732096458051584 2020-10-26 22:20:44 +0800 <JUthergi> jr you're always so right about everything, like daddy. Any inside info when the proof of hrc crimes, obamagate or hunter &amp; family crimes come out? Seems like FBI &amp; DOJ haven't got the proof from you yet, what's the hold up?
1320730151940927489 2020-10-26 22:13:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @legitimateNegro @Nick_Carmody @rmcough @HoarseWisperer @nazosan2 Yeah, concession speaches on election night are such fake news...
1320729386434367490 2020-10-26 22:09:58 +0800 <JUthergi> SCOTUS in the making! Does he like beer?
1320728020265652228 2020-10-26 22:04:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Tough questions are so mean! Seriously, this is exactly how you make news unbelievable, he's an expert, discredit for disbelief!
1320501447373561856 2020-10-26 07:04:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Now, that's entertainment!
1320499622092165127 2020-10-26 06:56:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Uh, think it dawned on them about the time they brought in jared
1320499271771267079 2020-10-26 06:55:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Trumpian tactics, give up file bankruptcy burn everyone and everything to the ground.  Then stand and declare war time pres saved gazillions more from dying! Only I the chosen one can rebuild ameritrump!  Profit from disaster, it's so much faster!!!
1320495976075960320 2020-10-26 06:42:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Did you know?  YOU'RE FIRED!  Even putin considers you a liability now!
1320495165157625862 2020-10-26 06:39:15 +0800 <JUthergi> So now barr is send to the bunker/ political prisoner's dungeon?  Hahahaha
1320494213407088640 2020-10-26 06:35:28 +0800 <JUthergi> These are the pro extinction disaster investors. Profits from chaos &amp; calamity!
1320493784363393025 2020-10-26 06:33:46 +0800 <JUthergi> 1st war time pres to throw up a white flag:  The virus king, donnie t trump!
1320491917520576513 2020-10-26 06:26:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @EricRubenLaw What's your #?
1320491581707878403 2020-10-26 06:25:01 +0800 <JUthergi> MANA Make America New Again! 40y observing daily growing corruption deep within our system of gov, it is time for a complete, down to the structure renovation throughout! absolute corruption of the elected elite of both parties demands it if there is ever to be a true United SA!
1320489440570126336 2020-10-26 06:16:30 +0800 <JUthergi> You guys referring to the secure systems of the pvt companies that own machines  manage and oversee employees with no security clearances or even IT security knowledge?  You're the reason trump knows it's rigged....
1320488106232041472 2020-10-26 06:11:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like republican town meetings across our country... The town I live in has been run by town atty (head of local gop) &amp; his hand picked fav lady 30 + yrs. No dems or independents about for 25 yrs. Oligarchy or autocracy or democratic Republic?
1320486426610421760 2020-10-26 06:04:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Autocrat v Democrat? Heaven help us
1320431158438580228 2020-10-26 02:24:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Speaking at a rally trump tells audience, live free or die! See? He has a plan to fight C19! Live free of the killer trump virus...or die!  This will make us great.
1320428483697364996 2020-10-26 02:14:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! All this winning makes USA #1 in the world!   So many categories that we are winning only because of you and your great work!
1320427605775077382 2020-10-26 02:10:48 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP have long suspected the "protect and serve" applies only to corporate donors &amp; their puppet politicians...
1320425873871437825 2020-10-26 02:03:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trump calls this people v people winning!
1320375479203975168 2020-10-25 22:43:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Yee haw! Beevus &amp; Butthead for pres!
1320369676959027200 2020-10-25 22:20:36 +0800 <JUthergi> If trump wins he has decided that these folks will be his new cabinet.  Maybe bc he knows that they can't draft a 25th Ammendment letter?
1320369078696136705 2020-10-25 22:18:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe trump himself is a body double? What? Oh i see now that he is actually a very large being &amp; it just looks like there's 2 of him.  I sure hope the world doesn't judge us by the health/strength of our pres...
1320367418586398722 2020-10-25 22:11:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Another stroke of genius! Give up &amp; hope the faux science will save all!
1320366996605816837 2020-10-25 22:09:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Baron Cohen, ty for offering to help this poor man. He so desperately needs attention and you could give him the game he feels he is so deserving of! Ty!
1320365476917219329 2020-10-25 22:03:55 +0800 <JUthergi> He needs to be crated, he's already chewed through the leash. Happens a lot with rabid dogs... To be kind, the humane thing to do is for the family to consider euthanasia?
1320364698085240832 2020-10-25 22:00:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be traitors to the cause...just faking to be mean &amp; make pence look as bad as trump. trump virus strikes again!
1320363800063770624 2020-10-25 21:57:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Not sarcasm, truth. Loyalty to the donnie above all else?
1320363401407811586 2020-10-25 21:55:40 +0800 <JUthergi> C'mon!  Everyone knows that the trump virus is a hoax.  The red wave is the blood of our family members that were libs trying to make the donnie look bad and even more people are faking symptoms to get tests just to make the donnie look bad. People are mean to poor donnie. lol
1320361120205516800 2020-10-25 21:46:36 +0800 <JUthergi> How did we go from Honest Abe to Dishonest donnie?
1320092140177940480 2020-10-25 03:57:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Guess melanoma won that argument with lil vanky?
1320091651298164736 2020-10-25 03:55:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Not nearly as good, but it's like a never ending SNL Skit! Seems like he saw dangers of climate change &amp; is trying to escape to another planet. Wait! New idea, send his gop to mars!  Happy days are here again!
1320090689590484992 2020-10-25 03:52:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Meaning if they won't vote he'll send his militias to break everyone's home ac units. Beware in the north too! He'll be sending dhs to disconnect power &amp; heat for blue states counties cities towns &amp; villages. Then the sky will fall on us too because we dared defy the chosen thing
1320089374860759041 2020-10-25 03:46:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't take anymore. Forced to deep breathe under the covers, not leaving bed until voting day. Jk. But it might be easier than trying to comprehend the depravity of trump family syndicate crimes against us all!
1320082687638503432 2020-10-25 03:20:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Our youth have the power to change our world.  It is my fervent hope that the 4mil turning 18yrs before this election, plot a new course for our 21st Century journey!  Vote blue stop the fire then set the plans that YOUTH desire.  WTP need your help to right this ship!!!
1320080942229225480 2020-10-25 03:13:17 +0800 <JUthergi> But, he says he loves women? More than anybody in the history of the world, right?  Isn't it time for every grandmother mom sister daughter to unite and protect our ideals for the next 7 generations?  Us guys seem to have been beaten by our lust for power by any means possible...
1320025059562606592 2020-10-24 23:31:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Again? His 666 bldg is a bigger money hole than daddy's Taj Mahal!
1320024357880664064 2020-10-24 23:28:26 +0800 <JUthergi> But Mr Lipton? This is a well conceived plan &amp; our war time pres likely doesn't understand it. He likes to trust his oversized gut attached to his incredibly unbelievable &amp; tremendously terrific very good brain. Sincere TY for your work!
1320021289994768386 2020-10-24 23:16:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Too late, vanky got it for her campaign fund!
1320021027833995266 2020-10-24 23:15:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Great insight granny! But look, we put lipstick on a pig and told it to act like someone who cares about WTP!
1320019700609331200 2020-10-24 23:09:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @lotownlust @donellefranklin @TomiLahren Silly me. i thought it was the donnie going after Ivana when her plastic surgeon screwed up the donnie's hair implants!
1320017904826449925 2020-10-24 23:02:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Ridin' that train, high on cocaine! donnie trump ya better watch your speed! It's almost as if he was offended anyone might take away his family treat?
1320016858578358273 2020-10-24 22:58:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @AnonYmo44465733 When your plan is nefarious, play dumb. Learned that from a lawyer...
1320013199236911105 2020-10-24 22:44:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Life, Liberty &amp; Happiness? Didn't the trump family syndicate take these from us too?  When king george did this he got quite the surprise on July 4th 1776.  Maybe its time to update our collective beliefs to declare our Independence once again, from the tyranny of the trumpists?
1320008607983947777 2020-10-24 22:25:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh Canada! TY, your insights mirror that which we too are experiencing at the hands of those in power.  What our govs have done to Indigenous Nation's they now bring to its own native citizens.  Civilized humans are in dire straits unless we come together.  Gov is no longer 4 WTP
1320002362782744578 2020-10-24 22:01:02 +0800 <JUthergi> If you love our Republic &amp; the ideals it stands for, please read, look at what is happening around us with due consideration, then rt.
1319640469840822278 2020-10-23 22:03:00 +0800 <JUthergi> If we can't force our will by standards of procedural policy we'll just break the the damn rules!
1319635879649042436 2020-10-23 21:44:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @EricLiptonNYT Great!?!? So if a dedicated CS uncovers a great danger to WTP but it might hurt the feelings, expose a crime or hurt ratings of our dear leaders they can be ordered to not speak of it? Somebody must've gotten this idea from another dear leader in the world?
1319629170503274509 2020-10-23 21:18:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this poor soul your daddy's new black guy? Do we meet him at the next rally pandering to African Americans?
1319628582017171459 2020-10-23 21:15:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Shh! Keep it down. You could get hammhead fired over this.  Isn't this the account that trump pays for  hammhead's insightful consulting fees?  fox entertainment values it's integrity, I think?
1319627251240079361 2020-10-23 21:10:28 +0800 <JUthergi> You're leaving? I knew you were the smartest one. Hit the road before they drop the load...even Tiffy is conspiring to blame it all on you!
1319440862879928321 2020-10-23 08:49:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @titsymcgitsy No. Not a fair question during quarantine though.  My wife wants me to do a man bun, whatever the hell that is?
1319435593001111553 2020-10-23 08:28:53 +0800 <JUthergi> This is how trump practices for the debate?
1319433779740659715 2020-10-23 08:21:41 +0800 <JUthergi> He's just waiting for ACB ty I get to scotus and strike it down. Why does he think anyone might possibly believe him???
1319430377635827718 2020-10-23 08:08:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Breaking New polls! Biden leading trump 98%-2%!!! Good thing your not running against Hunter! lol  https://t.co/G0Cftqb3LF
1319405727732109312 2020-10-23 06:30:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, hoping you could answer me this. I wanted to get a momentum of your pres.  Saw the trumpy bear fund raiser, but I really don't like the damned commies &amp; the symbol for Russia is the Bear!  Knowing you're really tough on Russia could I get a trumpy eagle?
1319403800088674304 2020-10-23 06:22:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Why do you think trump has been crying about election rigging? Because it worked once &amp; he'll do it again!  Vote for our lives!
1319402508159242241 2020-10-23 06:17:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget that both she &amp; hard have Pvt servers to do gov biz on. Don't forget they were refused sec clearance until daddy overruled DNI  State secrets for sale!
1319399604643823617 2020-10-23 06:05:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Please just put down your guns &amp; vote!¹ This is the last test of our great experiment. Wait to see if the peoples voice is heard over damned politicians buying all the voting machines. If the politicians cheat again we cannot fight ourselves! Fight the power! They fight WTP!
1319395379230744576 2020-10-23 05:49:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems to be the plan, only not jr, vanky for pres...
1319394900463570945 2020-10-23 05:47:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Birds of a feather?
1319393030173085697 2020-10-23 05:39:46 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Gutsy Woman! Well worth the time to read entire article! Haven't been able to comprehend why ruler class readily disregards law. They just buy incumbencies from Pvt companies controlling all voting machines! Knew an EC, said paper ballots ONLY way to secure elections! TY
1319383937916018690 2020-10-23 05:03:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Toughest guy in the world can't handle any questions without saying that's a tough question. You're so mean, we caught you !
1319382350476738561 2020-10-23 04:57:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @stuart_dolan Got a case to get us through tonight!
1319381832895500316 2020-10-23 04:55:16 +0800 <JUthergi> 'Murica man, wanna beer?
1319381067808362496 2020-10-23 04:52:14 +0800 <JUthergi> So that's where vanky's Chinese Patented Manufactured Voting Machines ended up? C'mon KY! It's up to you to save us all from the great mc Con All!  Hadn't he been using y'all long enough?
1319380250850111488 2020-10-23 04:48:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Great idea, but the cat fight between vanky &amp; Ms Daniels, over who daddy loves more would steal the whole show!
1319376553080401922 2020-10-23 04:34:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Very close to pitiful, if not for that endearing personality...
1319371519697498117 2020-10-23 04:14:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey guys! Love the way your product loosens rusted bolts, strips paints &amp; stains too!  My wife keeps trying to get me to drink it, think I should change my will?
1319367406272262144 2020-10-23 03:57:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Do you know if they will have men in white coats carrying an extra long sleeve white jacket with stylish straps on it to escort trump out after his pending meltdown?
1319359381209755648 2020-10-23 03:26:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr  mr mc Con All, sir? Why is it we haven't seen you interview with any other entertainment  news shows, ever?  Imho, is it that nobody believes you care about anything but $?  Do sorry i missed you. Did you get that corp liability waiver done for your donors?
1319352287752486912 2020-10-23 02:57:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Looking forward to instant tantrum on first mute! Will he throw things around? Rip mike off podium? Step out yelling at monitors &amp; Biden? Order his kids to storm tech room to smash mute buttons? Or if asked a tough q WTP want answers to, just walk out? Get your beer &amp; chips!
1319342378495389699 2020-10-23 02:18:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they take the judge ordered mandatory classes in HOW NOT TO STEAL from children?
1319341413700698112 2020-10-23 02:14:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Please sir, may I have some more?
1319339844963885062 2020-10-23 02:08:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  Pitiful jr tries so hard to create inappropriate relations to child trafficking / dark money. sis too. Do people know how much uncle John Casablancas and uncle Jeff Epstein just loved l'il jr &amp;vanky? To suffer abuse as a child does not mean everyone is an enemy!
1319337497726492672 2020-10-23 01:59:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't you get fired?
1319336344863281154 2020-10-23 01:54:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, it seems that your fear of all reporters everywhere asking "tough" questions has got guys like putin, xi, kim, ayatollahs, erdogan, even Hillary rolling on the floor laughing their collective a**es off at you!  C'mon, pull up those big boy panties &amp; man up!
1319332578797768704 2020-10-23 01:39:33 +0800 <JUthergi> We can only hope!
1319332416771772416 2020-10-23 01:38:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Too late guys! Swamp is now a lake. trump dump lake...
1319331381533675527 2020-10-23 01:34:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Straight from putin's playbook...
1319303259442565120 2020-10-22 23:43:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Anything to protect the corporate elite from C19 liabilities exposed in unsafe working conditions. It's called the mc con all creed!
1319302528576544768 2020-10-22 23:40:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @judgeyourself99 @sharnettereese1 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How is it that the allegedly most powerful man in the world gets his feelings hurt so much by so many?  Is our pres just a big wussy?
1319301026801983488 2020-10-22 23:34:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh oh!  Maybe its time for us all to learn  THE trump TITANIC TWO-STEP?  https://t.co/5PqTZKpV4j
1319299740647948291 2020-10-22 23:29:04 +0800 <JUthergi> It hurts to just look at these people after they have raped &amp; pillaged us all...
1319293150289141760 2020-10-22 23:02:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Oh look! More winnings! Historical! Credible &amp; believable! Terrifically tremendous action by potus keeps up high scores! USA! maga (someday right?)
1319292186542903296 2020-10-22 22:59:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not just expose his "indiscretions" that almost got him a court Martial in the Army? The actions his daddy took with the paid sen to keep it all hidden? Wasn't it mc con all that worked so hard for "don't ask, don't tell" policy for army? Read daily.cos Out him &amp; he'll walk!
1319290145409912832 2020-10-22 22:50:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Give him hell Mr Harrison!!!
1319289251540856832 2020-10-22 22:47:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Any chance for a swarm on the donnie tonight?
1319288485258219525 2020-10-22 22:44:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Can they do that?
1319288068227002368 2020-10-22 22:42:41 +0800 <JUthergi> We've lost over 220k family members to the trump virus. not one of the elected elite has called for a moment of silent prayer. Instead of more tricks wo treats, could WTP unite this coming All Souls Day/la Dia del Muerto/Hallows Eve for our own silent mourning? Full stop on biz?
1319285496233685000 2020-10-22 22:32:28 +0800 <JUthergi> DNI ratman strikes again!
1319280274581041157 2020-10-22 22:11:43 +0800 <JUthergi> If you would like to confirm your suspicion Sir, may i recommend reading the lewis powell "manifesto" memo on how to strategically provide corp america dominance over democracy? The blueprint powell developed has been followed and flawlessly executed.  Today we suffer the results
1319277569724723204 2020-10-22 22:00:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Rewrite on US Constitution? How is that possible &amp; why wouldn't mc con all be arrested for vandalizing the sacred document of WTP? What happened to law enforcement for the elected elite? Oh right, LAW &amp; ORDER on the people, not the precious elite.
1319270666819035136 2020-10-22 21:33:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Not 'the donnie', he could NEVER say this because he LOVES us! Fake news! USA! MAGA rules all fools!
1319084121340207104 2020-10-22 09:12:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @Goss30Goss @fresh2oh @SenRonJohnson @maxseddon @JoeBiden johnson was leader of prostrate eight gop sens sent to bow go putin on our Independence Day! Upon return the Russian narrative took over! This guy! Arrghhh!
1319083078074195969 2020-10-22 09:08:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @danielsgoldman Mr Goldman. This great article both Informs &amp; confirms many questions we've had. TY Could you comment in why this aid &amp; comfort to so many enemies is not treasonous?  extrajudicial killing of US Citizen &amp; siccing doj on Biden's is not crossed line 2 Fascism? 25th Ammendment Day?
1319079958455746561 2020-10-22 08:55:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Straight out of the  goebbels propaganda class 101.   It takes a former POTUS to shine the light!  Now, if our remaining Presidents can help us, we can send pres trump away from all that we hold as sacred ideals of OUR REPUBLIC.
1319051668206604288 2020-10-22 07:03:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone that has suffered the abuses of a parent has the propensity to become a stark mad &amp; cunning lunatic, especially in her quest for power &amp; acceptance, just like daddy?  Beware the bleached blonde barbies! They're everywhere!
1319048611393658881 2020-10-22 06:51:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Operable cancerous tumor we can cut out &amp; dispose of? Cool beans!  Let's all be surgeons voting this cancer out!
1319047738806444033 2020-10-22 06:47:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Did you catch President Obama's speech? Don't be humiliated by truth, get out &amp; fight the way you do. Everyone is turning against you bc we love you so much we don't want to see your further humiliation &amp; disgrace.  Better get the kids to start tweets to help!
1319045021698588673 2020-10-22 06:36:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr, another wolf cry? When will it ever occur to you that all these horrible people are not working to hurt WTP?  It is everybody everywhere united to dispose of your daddy! If you stick around too long, they'll be after you too! PS did gop campaign buy your unsold books yet?
1319041373807480832 2020-10-22 06:22:24 +0800 <JUthergi> mr ghouliani? If there is one thing that speaks to your integrity and truth telling it has to be how quickly &amp; adamantly you present denials.  The tell that tells all is  how truly less than forth coming you are having become trump's lackey. Run away while you still can!
1319039757666652160 2020-10-22 06:15:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Healthcare is an earned right. WTP earned it!   Consider gazillions of taxpayer $ paid to big pharma/hospitals etc. for r&amp;d, testing, equipment grants, study grants, bldg expansion + all accompanying tax breaks, etc.  It is an earned entitlement &amp; those claiming otherwise? Paid!
1319013833592143877 2020-10-22 04:32:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Thought flynn turned on trump until last lines.  This new breed of trumpatriots is an aberration, an assault on the ideals of our Republic. They have bastardized the term so much that we see red. Where are the Statesmen we used to learn about? WTP should call ourselves Countrymen
1319005936472756227 2020-10-22 04:01:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Gotta follow the rules if you want to get paid.  Isn't this the responsibility of all paid employees?
1319003985915858945 2020-10-22 03:53:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like cdc night be stepping out of trumpian rule. Still, all cdc info subject to change with each new trump appointment.
1319000419457245195 2020-10-22 03:39:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Courage is contagious!
1318998484167593984 2020-10-22 03:31:59 +0800 <JUthergi> You going to bring the faux tv doctor used in your ads? Adds such credibility to your unbelievably incredible campaign.  Wish I were a senior, it's so entertaining to watch our elected elite patronize the seniors that built this country...
1318994287519059974 2020-10-22 03:15:18 +0800 <JUthergi> ACB is Roman Catholic. RC members believe the Pope to be infallible. With the Pope believing it necessary&amp; timely to comment on same sex relations I can't wait to hear how ACB will reconcile this wi originalist take on our Constitution!
1318992364317396995 2020-10-22 03:07:40 +0800 <JUthergi> So now we know why ghouliani is trumpy bear's lawyer...wannabe macho playboy, the donnie, moved on her &amp; just started kissing her. But when he went to grab her by the p**"y, ghouliani yelled "GOTCHA", here's my invoice!
1318990603347263488 2020-10-22 03:00:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Is he ruminating about how despicably he has treated WTP at facing our bigliest challenges ever? Maybe he is walking the halls telling himself he's right, everyone is wrong?  Reminiscing his good old days in the army before no ask no tell?  Got caught playing pocket pool to relax
1318936639775903744 2020-10-21 23:26:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe princess vanky already shipped them to Epstein's Island?  Is it true the donnie is starting a new offshore trump teen model agency &amp; pageant?
1318932650917306373 2020-10-21 23:10:23 +0800 <JUthergi> This most insightful article is further confirmed by the whole vanky/China body bag/ casket investments.
1318923609772052485 2020-10-21 22:34:27 +0800 <JUthergi> It's always about the donnie, if PA votes him out they will be happy to know that he will never return.
1318919241664516096 2020-10-21 22:17:06 +0800 <JUthergi> The only items of value trump &amp; kids have are US STATE SECRETS!  Russia? Want our defense of EU plans only $999.99b! Rocket man? Want to be sure your missiles hit CA? Today only $999.99b! China? Iran? Turkey? C'mon down!
1318910339908501506 2020-10-21 21:41:43 +0800 <JUthergi> It's not as if the bill will actually help WTP... Here's a few bucks, now leave us alone.  other advanced Nation's provide monthly stipends, yet our elite throws us crumbs and calls it a feast!
1318909223678476290 2020-10-21 21:37:17 +0800 <JUthergi> eric! Only 2 trump signs in that whole traffic jam! Either the campaign can't afford to make signs for lack of $ support or those are American Citizens proudly waving their flags in protest if the least American Family attacking our liberty?  PS does SDNY know you left NY?
1318905803693326342 2020-10-21 21:23:42 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mr Zaid! Usually tell survey &amp; poll takers no, unless they pay a fee of $250 up front.  This one i took for free, couldn't stop chuckling, everyone should try it.  choose trump or cheating lying low iq social commie radical leftist?  It's no wonder trump only trusts his polls.
1318902797992165379 2020-10-21 21:11:45 +0800 <JUthergi> trump supporters, please help me, i'm so confused...  How is it that our president can pay $188k to China for taxes on all his biz there, but here for WTP he only pays $750?  Doesn't he love &amp; support us the way we do him?
1318629697530564619 2020-10-21 03:06:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Glad you cleared that up! You guys 9nly give your " contributions" go the lobbyists, the do the qpq for you, right?  Hey exxon, remember the Valdez? Equador?  We do!
1318624924613939201 2020-10-21 02:47:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @jkbelk @MarcACaputo Raise &amp; paid vacation? New trump cabinet member?
1318620494271270914 2020-10-21 02:29:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @morethanmySLE @ClcpierceCarol Could it be a battle royale for daddy's love?  Right, not that.  More likely bc vanky works for daddy and wants his job &amp; melanoma has a job working for putin?
1318619346118283264 2020-10-21 02:25:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Anything to control the news cycles...
1318618563855482880 2020-10-21 02:22:19 +0800 <JUthergi> More examples of bad parenting or just wanton ignorance?
1318617816103309315 2020-10-21 02:19:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr Moscow mitch mc con all, says anything to avoid questions about your military service!  It's the 21st C, you can talk about your intimate exploits with a fellow soldier in your youth. Why worry, your dad and sen. buried the unbecoming &amp; inappropriate behavior stuff! Ask? No tell?
1318615224497430529 2020-10-21 02:09:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Collins breaking regs? No way! jr says he is just triggering the libs with his new Halloween Costume! Tricks, no treats for the people!
1318613227908046851 2020-10-21 02:01:06 +0800 <JUthergi> This is just so unfair to such an incredibly terrific &amp; unbelievably tremendous leader!  That jared, so cunning that he's already got his list of gop elite that wants to replace trump with vanky!  Watch out mr pres, those closest to you are the most capable &amp; likely to betray you
1318610446279114752 2020-10-21 01:50:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like something putin would say Or kim jung un Or xi Or Mao Or Mughabbi Or Ghadaffi... Likely though it could have been Hitler or Mussolini?  Is it 25th AMMENDMENT DAY?
1318324033448968196 2020-10-20 06:51:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Is today 25th Ammendment Day???
1318322879956721664 2020-10-20 06:47:22 +0800 <JUthergi> I fear the SCOTUS knew exactly what they were doing...
1318322305664155654 2020-10-20 06:45:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Excuse me. mr president, sir?  That red wave you started talking about? Not good.  Red Wave is the blood of over 220k dead American Citizens bc you let the China Virus, that they let out... INTO OUR COUNTRY!  The cursed trump virus is rising! More blood coming!
1318320515996545024 2020-10-20 06:37:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @JRehling @kathy_eisel Shh! They feed him reruns when his entertainment info peeps aren't on...don't tell anyone.
1318319434822541314 2020-10-20 06:33:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @LeonaLioness6 @DoYouEvenLif Will you be wearing a mask, Lady? lol
1318319150662635522 2020-10-20 06:32:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Isn't our portly president a bit less offensive?  His supporters in hats are angry enough!  TY great work, I think you really give us hope!
1318317409091145729 2020-10-20 06:25:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @PamGibs64104547 @DonaldJTrumpJr Cool! You saw this? where can we see them bc if jr doesn't bring them to authorities, i will. (I don't think the FBI is very happy wi jr right now)
1318316495529779202 2020-10-20 06:22:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @atrupar Apparently he could raise $1b in 1 day if he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. lol  i told him to go for it! He could pay every voter more than a pretty penny if we did him the favor of voting for him.  He didn't respond, yet!
1318308557373251590 2020-10-20 05:50:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr jr, there you go again!  i told you, read the story of Peter &amp; the Wolf. You can't go crying wolf everytime daddy gets upset. His mistakes, not yours.  If you want us to believe, GET PROOF, you been crying this sad song for years, any proof that can bring charges? Law &amp; Order?
1318305923392245761 2020-10-20 05:39:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Did any of the 535 elected elite take any kind of financial hit?  Insider trading grand slams don't count.
1318305018278273037 2020-10-20 05:36:23 +0800 <JUthergi> See, our elected elite still love us, right?
1318303982931091462 2020-10-20 05:32:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Great news?  Who in gop keeps their word? C'mon tell us!  There must be at least one of our elected elite that keeps their word,  right???
1318302895889174535 2020-10-20 05:27:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Gotta have someone to blame! Didn't everyone know that our adorable trumpy bear is blameless?  Confession: (i saw the ad on foxy biz show, please don't hate me).   Btw anyone know why it's a trumpy bear, it is the Russian symbol of strength?  Maybe trumpy eagle couldnt fly?
1318300294963482625 2020-10-20 05:17:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @LSmom9 @JonathanTurley It's been said that USA is the last greatest hope on earth;   WTP are the USA's last &amp; only greatest hope!
1318299325622005761 2020-10-20 05:13:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @blanghinrichs @JonathanTurley Well Sir, i think the answer to that question lies in the fact that we've chosen the only candidates the parties gives us, just look at the clown show our elected elite put on? All 535 if them! lol
1318298329764212737 2020-10-20 05:09:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @prof_forrestal @JonathanTurley Kind of like "president trump"? Cursed! I thought I could go 4 whole yrs wo using those 2 words in the same sentence!!!
1318297348452352005 2020-10-20 05:05:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Well then, maybe our totally unbelievably incredible terrific pres should have stopped the virus at our border?  Because he failed so miserably wi so many dead citizens, is that why it's called the trump virus?
1318296300807389187 2020-10-20 05:01:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @ericgarland This is likely why jr has been tweeting to disband FBI?
1318294794796474371 2020-10-20 04:55:46 +0800 <JUthergi> What? I never stopped believing in our advertiser's creations &amp; trump lies?
1318293910532272128 2020-10-20 04:52:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Shh! Don't tell trumpy bear!
1318293219130691591 2020-10-20 04:49:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, somebody should!
1318292500054945793 2020-10-20 04:46:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Did you find someone to believe this yet?
1318292015583535104 2020-10-20 04:44:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Intelligent life in DC? Whoda thunk it?  How if CPI or GDP drops then elected salaries drop too?
1318291057050898433 2020-10-20 04:40:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trump just claimed 11m new jobs. Does that include the 14m he claimed that vanky did by herself? wish I had a trump steak &amp; trump healthy pills to assist me on choking down this good news! What no more steaks &amp; pills? I guess I can choke myself wi a china made trump tie!
1318289036922990592 2020-10-20 04:32:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow, this program is do cool! After all the donor companies get the free $ how much for real small biz? Kinda seems like our gov is now buying votes directly? Like the pharma certificates for our seniors? You writers ought to run away while is Az.!  Seriously! Do you hear him?
1318287188057071618 2020-10-20 04:25:32 +0800 <JUthergi> eric? Does SDNY know you snuck out of NY?   Thought you had to stay in NY while under deposition for all the crimes, committed by others of course, under the trump biz model? Or was it that children's charity money missing thingy?
1318284107579785217 2020-10-20 04:13:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @MattGertz Well, trump KNOWS criminals! What's that quote, it takes one to know one!
1318283568964055041 2020-10-20 04:11:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Wow, you could raise a billion $ in one day just by making a few phone calls! you're incredible!  Why would you chose not to? you could buy everyones votes, be pres forever! So why not fundraise that billion$, you told us you could?   Did you surrender already?
1318282030178816009 2020-10-20 04:05:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Kind of sums up the mindset of donnie destructo's supporters?
1318281050007785472 2020-10-20 04:01:09 +0800 <JUthergi> We love your new mustache donnie! So becoming of you!
1318204534607482881 2020-10-19 22:57:06 +0800 <JUthergi> the donnie's ronnie swings with a miss!
1318202241795448834 2020-10-19 22:48:00 +0800 <JUthergi> So, no change to the successful strategy that has kept him there for decades?
1318201709978595330 2020-10-19 22:45:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they give him a facility? Seems like since he doesn't pay his bills to host cities he's been restricted to airports. Free to him &amp; campaign because, again, he profits off of our tax dollars...
1318197832994721793 2020-10-19 22:30:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Nobody seems to have an answer Sir. Been asking for it a while now. Maybe perm members and their voting blocs would veto? Sure seems necessary !
1318194745513025538 2020-10-19 22:18:12 +0800 <JUthergi> All part of the show... Who gets out of bed in the middle of the night to announce they've been infected? Tv producers that dream up plots?
1318192427308621824 2020-10-19 22:09:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Haven't we yet learned that when trump claims he did something, he didn't? "Totally defeated isis"?
1318190257288916993 2020-10-19 22:00:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Since we all know that trump's financial status is never what he says it to be, is it possible his hints to leave are subtle requests for $ to help him flee?  Let's all chip in $1 to get him to go, then not pay.  We could send it to a c19 victims fund after he's gone...
1318182311779860481 2020-10-19 21:28:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @WoefulMage Well, he dies have a better hair do than the donnie!
1318181247852695552 2020-10-19 21:24:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @RuthLangmore1 @bokoo143 Why threaten burbs with African refugees only?  Indicator of his hate for black folks at the top of his list?
1318180574998253568 2020-10-19 21:21:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr How convenient.  When the director, in response to Q on validity of emails states " the fact that I know so little about those emails" he gets cut.  jr, did Hunter call you a mean name? Steal your girl? Do you secretly have a crush on him? So obsessed.
1318178072454193152 2020-10-19 21:11:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @IvankaTrump Dropping off more of your special Chinese Patented &amp; Manufactured Voting Machines?  Just curious, is the patent granted for the secret way your voting machines only count votes for daddy? How sweet!
1317965156593422337 2020-10-19 07:05:54 +0800 <JUthergi> jr didn't jump yet?  He better get out soon bc vanky jare &amp; daddy are setting up eric to take the blame in SDNY! A lot of very smart people say vanky got daddy to drop jr from the will...time to roll jr!
1317961337629270017 2020-10-19 06:50:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @don
1317961149892186113 2020-10-19 06:49:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @jilevin She must have refused to say how impressive trump's ability to absorb the medical date and details again? Nah, likely just fired.
1317960392375750656 2020-10-19 06:46:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Worse yet is that he isn't even a good player!
1317958647033614337 2020-10-19 06:40:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Journalism lives! It just moved out of the USA and must've got stuck overseas by trump's immigrant bans. Let journalism return to USA!
1317956386270154754 2020-10-19 06:31:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir, the whole country is turning red! This is winning bigly, right?
1317954813905244161 2020-10-19 06:24:48 +0800 <JUthergi> So now after playing lawyer mayor spy the ghouliani wants to be a comedian too?  Hanging around trump so long that now everybody wants to be a tv star?
1317872276113661958 2020-10-19 00:56:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Vote out incumbents! I  N eed C ash U M ake B ecause E lected elite N eed T o S pend...  Our Money for their own benefit!
1317870775026786305 2020-10-19 00:50:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @jilevin TY Mr Levin!  Just tweeted yesterday, wondering if another Sturgis Rally could be held before election?   you know, to support the presidents herd immunity plan to stop C19?
1317868748578164736 2020-10-19 00:42:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @ehforgetit @bokoo143 No worries Sec Kerry. You never looked like there was a broomstick inserted to your anatomy from behind... Btw I thought you preferred R &amp; R over disco?
1317867604015517696 2020-10-19 00:38:16 +0800 <JUthergi> And like jr donnie does, they even call to get rid of the same FBI that investigates them!
1317865062061789184 2020-10-19 00:28:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Not paying attention to this group is the kryptonite to scare the donnie right out of his superman feety PJs!
1317864305451274240 2020-10-19 00:25:09 +0800 <JUthergi> See? Step by step dismantling of a Democratic Republic. Just following the wannabe dictator's plan to total Fascist Rule!  Even jr knows...  This is no joke, this IS the end game!   Truly hope to be wrong and call myself the fool when all is done.
1317861748192481280 2020-10-19 00:15:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @CaslerNoel @sharnettereese1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Did the location say Hillary st.? No irony there! lol
1317860643064762370 2020-10-19 00:10:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @NikkiEastment @realDonaldTrump Shh, don't tell @realDonaldTrump but every time you day the t r u m p word you must put $1 in the swear jar.  t r u m p is the nasty new swear word to replace f*#k!  i.e.,  in 2016 the opponent got 2.9m more votes than the EC designated pres so WTP got royally t r u m p e d !!!
1317857601208680448 2020-10-18 23:58:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @MarkJacob16 She's been talking to mommie dearest kellyanne con(all)way about alternative facts again...
1317853030159683584 2020-10-18 23:40:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @__free61 @OrinKerr @TimNoEgo @IvankaTrump It's been reported they have their own Pvt servers that is used for gov biz.  They have security clearance. I wonder how much US State Secrets are going for on the open market? Anyone bet at least $420 million?
1317852386732421121 2020-10-18 23:37:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @four_hack @Bunk_Brewski @OrinKerr Only in trumplandia
1317803798581137415 2020-10-18 20:24:43 +0800 <JUthergi> trump tells us it's China's Virus &amp; their fault bc "they let it out". Who then, after discarding PRT let it in? trump did. trumpologically speaking, it should forever be known as the trump virus.
1317799067884392448 2020-10-18 20:05:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Humans everywhere choose peace &amp; it flourishes when we listen and recognize our commonalities.  Be patient with us world help us &amp; we will again be back on the path to peace.  Moving forward in this 21st Century we can no longer be a warring nation!  Peace &amp; Good will to all
1317606913958420480 2020-10-18 07:22:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Still not a single formal charge by any law enforcement body?  Anywhere? Hmm, me thinks the ghouliani protest too much!
1317603556300644352 2020-10-18 07:09:02 +0800 <JUthergi> When the gov locks people up or approves the killing of people that oppose it's leader... hmm isn't there a term for that? Guess I'll have to read that third reich book.
1317602100721930245 2020-10-18 07:03:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @nexusmt4 @CamilleLarou @KevinlyFather Shh, I think that's why he wears his ties down below his crotch, makes look slimmer!
1317601531554836493 2020-10-18 07:00:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he learn that dance in Epstein Island or backstage at trump modelling school?
1317596154197049344 2020-10-18 06:39:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Nobody knows that, did you know that? A lot of very smart people are saying...it's incredible &amp; unbelievable. Tremendous &amp; terrific! lol
1317593430663495681 2020-10-18 06:28:48 +0800 <JUthergi> His tantrums are just getting started...after his tacit approval over the gov killing of a citizen against Fascism, he now calls for his opponent to be locked up!  Sounds more like putin each day.   Don't drink the tea !
1317592128768380930 2020-10-18 06:23:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't you worry ma'am, WTP will love &amp; protect you forever!
1317585851631738886 2020-10-18 05:58:41 +0800 <JUthergi> He has officially crossed the line into Fascism...heaven help us all!
1317585408713232390 2020-10-18 05:56:55 +0800 <JUthergi> If i start a militia I can get a loan? Just LOVE this country!
1317580155032866817 2020-10-18 05:36:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @EdwardTHardy Special ops at GRU?
1317571607129411586 2020-10-18 05:02:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Let's have another Sturgis Rally, just for kicks?
1317571233387585537 2020-10-18 05:00:35 +0800 <JUthergi> jr! What're you doing up so early? Just wondering if your daddy would ride his bicycle to the trump tour du force race for us? When is that btw?
1317570283788697605 2020-10-18 04:56:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Now that trump authorized extrajudicial killing of a citizen against Fascism...is it logical to fear he may order the death of his opponent...putin style?
1317567936127766529 2020-10-18 04:47:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Humans assembled together asking the gov for a redress of grievances. Beautiful thing, how Democratic! New scotus judge forgot this is a fundamental right.  Still, not a peaceful protest until trump's gestap, oops, fed protectors arrive with assault weapons lrad &amp; chemical sprays
1317564782854242309 2020-10-18 04:34:58 +0800 <JUthergi> moscow's mitch mc con all, is it time to run away yet?  Can't wait for the movies to come out based upon nazi trackers work, only now we need a team of trump trackers!
1317563397467144194 2020-10-18 04:29:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @JoyAnnReid If trump is declared enemy of the people and indicted for treason  are his senate/congressional followers are also treasonous?  Asking for WTP against authoritarian rule...
1317555823430815747 2020-10-18 03:59:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like you want us to vote as if we are all part of the HUMAN FAMILY...well, Ok then!
1317513722152222720 2020-10-18 01:12:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Now that the gov can kill it's citizens at will wo recourse, does this mean the Republic is officially dead yet?  They'll call it patriotism but isn't really just Fascism in disguise?
1317511292975042561 2020-10-18 01:02:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @robreiner @sprbrighting What do we do when trump refuses to relinquish power?  How do you defeat an authoritarian regime without the USA coming to the rescue?
1317510766174535688 2020-10-18 01:00:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @nickdanger69 @OfficialJLD Wait, are you talking about politicians?
1317508766577926145 2020-10-18 00:52:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @JohnLukeSam1 Might be easier to make list of who not to send?
1317508268781129730 2020-10-18 00:50:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @EugJHawk @realDonaldTrump We all might understand this better if they both had the mustache? Graphic artists?
1317506436432338948 2020-10-18 00:43:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Is this the reason trump wants her so badly or is it so she will keep him in power? Am so confused...
1317503155702239232 2020-10-18 00:30:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @williamlegate @sharnettereese1 Or maybe the donnie Sr just continues his pattern of severe child abuse? Cannot even hazard a guess as to what he's done to his daughters...
1317491704157642755 2020-10-17 23:44:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @JackElgin7 @MariaJeanne17 @ProudSocialist No
1317491517444022273 2020-10-17 23:43:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @mikquattro @ProudSocialist No, but before our Republic is destroyed we must defeat his step by step path to his absolute control.  Hopefully, somehow, he is removed. Then WTP must be angry enough to take action and use the living constitution to change from gov of the  corrupted elite to gov of WTP, or ...
1317489069186830339 2020-10-17 23:34:06 +0800 <JUthergi> While hopeful that trump will run to avoid prosecution, he has already laid the groundwork to retain power, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!  Think of the shiny objects over there, it's what happens each time he breaks more rules.  PLEASE read article and give due consideration. RT &amp; LOOK
1317478267209895938 2020-10-17 22:51:11 +0800 <JUthergi> When trump assets worldwide are seized trump will have only our nation's secrets left to sell. He'll do it with extreme vengeful motive to pay WTP back for the humiliation.
1317238821927456768 2020-10-17 06:59:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone up for 25th Ammendment Day?
1317237929383788545 2020-10-17 06:56:10 +0800 <JUthergi> What an excellent summary. TY Mr Elgin!  It's as if justice Powell achieved his dreams laid out in the memo he wrote before his appointment. Watching latest scotus scam pretty much proved his memo &amp; your story!  May i have another?
1317234148453527553 2020-10-17 06:41:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @ProudSocialist While you offer many valid perspectives to which we agree on, would it not be best to stop house from burning down? We could still have a structure, then begin a structural renovation for the people, by the people and make corporations subservient to our quality of life... TY!!!
1317232824160866304 2020-10-17 06:35:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  As it appears you are losing i was hoping, maybe, you could pretend to act like these #RealPresidents?
1317231896212983809 2020-10-17 06:32:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump guess it's true! trumpy bear just proved WHITE MEN CANT DANCE! &amp; It's not always a good thing to dance like nobody can see you!  Still got the same moves as when he was 'the donnie' @ Epstein's Island?  Creepy?
1317230503079120896 2020-10-17 06:26:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Brave men all!  But did you know trump's gfather was german? His dad was kkk and he fought for them? trump is so courageous he tried to sign up for Vietnam 5X???  Sorry, Anti Fascist servicemen in my family too and I wanted to contrast  COURAGE v COWARDICE!  TY!
1317228778997862407 2020-10-17 06:19:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir? This article, a fair observation many would agree with but you taught us that it's all fake news. I only believe what you say, but to be sure Did I miss release of better health plan? Responses to putin? Infrastructure plan? Virus gone yet?  Tour du trump?
1317202115668942851 2020-10-17 04:33:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Please! Just stop this unbelievably incredible attempts to make the boss look good! Y'all failed miserably! Still tryin to put makeup on a pig? Why not be more productive w/ your time &amp; get the hell out while the gettin is good?
1317200407106564096 2020-10-17 04:27:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Remember when this wannabe famous guy had a tv show and we just turned it off? If WTP work hard we can just turn him off after elections. Thereafter anytime anyone anywhere says the t r u m p name it will be likened to a nasty curse word throughout the civilized world!  $ in jar!
1317198703925538816 2020-10-17 04:20:18 +0800 <JUthergi> t.r.u.m.p.
1317196728739790848 2020-10-17 04:12:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @SenatorHassan @dazyjane410 Good points. Courage is contagious, stay strong!
1317195742763749376 2020-10-17 04:08:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Better to go direct to your local BOE. They welcome it.  Btw, USPS workers can be trusted, unless of course trumpy &amp; the  appointed guy makes everyone go postal!  All was fine until our lumpy trumpy started rigging elections.
1317194533181050882 2020-10-17 04:03:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Destructo donnie told us he would rig elections!  But nobody listened.
1317194087662059521 2020-10-17 04:01:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Been hoping for UN Observers, but on the bright side all those dodgie wannabe dictatorial banana republics have a brand new biz model thanks trump! Sorry, seriously called for and still believe UN is necessary but I fear putin xi would veto attempts...  It's up to WTP!
1317192744671055873 2020-10-17 03:56:37 +0800 <JUthergi> It will most certainly be easier to count votes using the vanky Chinese Patented/ Manufactured Voting machines she bought.  No worries about WTP though, even w/ the likely unbelievably incredible and terrific increase in suicides,  she also bought caskets for us all!
1317190981448585218 2020-10-17 03:49:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @tdotrob @SRuhle @RepRoKhanna @MSNBC Jan 2020 to May, how many unnecessary deaths due to trump virus? May 2020, when Cares Act passed to present, how many intentional deaths due to trump virus assisted by Grim Reaper mc con all?  Thinking that inquiring minds would reeaally like to know!
1317189422962663424 2020-10-17 03:43:25 +0800 <JUthergi> The greed and incompetence of our elected elite will bring pain for the next 7 generations...
1317188652603215873 2020-10-17 03:40:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @azlibertad Apparently not enough dead American citizens for the self proclaimed GRIM REAPER?
1317187752585236481 2020-10-17 03:36:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @EricTrump  You tell it eric!  The only polls of any value are the polls bought by your team, to show daddy how much he thinks he is liked!  Good strategy, it'll help when you grow up &amp; run for president!  PS are you gonna tell all before everyone blames you?
1317184456252411906 2020-10-17 03:23:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @mmpadellan Hey mitchie mc con all, why is it that your incompetence in mngmnt of Gov is never to blame for such grotesque budget deficits?  You are paid too much for such lousy work. Can't imagine a Pvt company ever hiring you...
1317183280668704777 2020-10-17 03:19:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Doubtful that we can ever trust our "representatives" again because we can't even afford to get them to listen. What was once "our" government has become the gov of the rich, by the corporate donors, for their continued profit off of our blood, sweat, &amp; tears!
1317125574243061761 2020-10-16 23:29:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently they're learning from trump how easy it is to use taxpayer $ to promote themselves?
1317124345588797445 2020-10-16 23:24:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Just considering the unholy amounts of $ raised for the party's candidates... Imagine what we could do for enviro healthcare education infrastructure &amp; work opptys with the gazillions they spend on themselves? There must be a better way for the benefit of WTP?
1317119579894722560 2020-10-16 23:05:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Um, M Guthrie? He does have a niece and well, um, maybe you could rephrase that statement about him as an uncle?
1317118321800716288 2020-10-16 23:00:53 +0800 <JUthergi> After election, gonna go trump air to watch the tour de trump races. On flight i'll play trump board game, devour a trump steak, trump chicken wings &amp; trump vodka. i'll wear my trump tie hat &amp; tee  while grabbing flight attndts. Come join me? What, all those companies r bankrupt?
1317114938498912256 2020-10-16 22:47:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't this against fed judiciary order? Notify law enforcement.  Contact your sen it congress rep. If they're gop go to press!  Legal eagle input needed...help?
1317113674230882304 2020-10-16 22:42:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @moe6977 @mmpadellan Perhaps it is more likely that gop promotes mail ballots at this late date bc their Oct surprise is absolute disqualification of all mail ballots?  Take ballots to local BOE yourselves to be sure.
1317111713544720391 2020-10-16 22:34:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @NatalieReid @mmpadellan Check w/ local BOE they like it when you drop off ballots at their offices. Quicker counting &amp; helps our USPS!
1317110910960500739 2020-10-16 22:31:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @CarrieMarzec @mmpadellan $
1317110780500824065 2020-10-16 22:30:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @pamzinoregon @mmpadellan Safer way to secure vote is a direct delivery to your local BOE office. Call them, it helps them &amp; USPS!
1317110310398984193 2020-10-16 22:29:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @bethany38683249 @mmpadellan Please tell your followers that each local BOE would likely prefer you deliver ballots directly to their offices. Ours did and we coordinated w/ dozens of neighbors for our VOTER CONVOY! Try it, you'll like it! BOE did!
1317108835656531970 2020-10-16 22:23:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps, in light of all being done to compromise USPS we could make the effort to deliver our ballots directly to the local BOE.  We called our BOE and asked what to do to make their jobs easier, they advised BRING BALLOTS TO BOE offices.  47 neighbor convoy here! Start one!
1317097982517497856 2020-10-16 21:40:04 +0800 <JUthergi> trump interacted warmly?  Hahahohohohaha! Stop! This is like a SNL skit! Sign this comedian up!!!
1317095003576016897 2020-10-16 21:28:13 +0800 <JUthergi> It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood! Won't you be my neighbor? Can't we all just be, good neighbors?
1317089822792683522 2020-10-16 21:07:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Just like the Russian immigrant's gdaughter said last night, "such a lovely smile. You're so handsome when you smile!"
1317087818812895237 2020-10-16 20:59:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @Thomas_Howden @trumpharmsusall @EricTrump VOTE NO to Hunter Biden!
1317086928882204672 2020-10-16 20:56:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey l'il eric, what was it that your daddy said about people that take the fifth?  So eric, just between us, you gonna tell all or let vanky convince daddy to drop all the blame on you?  If you tell on them you could grow up to be president!
1317085826740781058 2020-10-16 20:51:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh no! Did he hurt himself?
1317085641277059073 2020-10-16 20:51:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @EricTrump Poor eric, doesn't he understand it's the breitbart &amp; fox types that advocate for his family? Seriously eric, has any other media invited you to opine? Why is it every time daddy screws up you kids take to twitter?
1317080733568192515 2020-10-16 20:31:31 +0800 <JUthergi> After all the eons trump has been in our face that's a rhetorical question, right?
1317079866634866688 2020-10-16 20:28:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump And here i was thinking that trump had dirt on Murdoch, why else would the entertainment network give him air time?  Looks like the donnie is done, lol.
1316921860756570113 2020-10-16 10:00:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Heaven help us, looks like a tantrum coming on!
1316918327747485697 2020-10-16 09:46:11 +0800 <JUthergi> For a lifetime job? No way, she'll choose excommunication...
1316916535148019712 2020-10-16 09:39:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Wow! You were just incredibly unbelievable!  Did you wear your Superman jammies under your suit? It made you look just... so bigly!  PS Why did Biden get so much more air time to answer questions than you got?  Doesn't anyone like you anymore?
1316913395837390853 2020-10-16 09:26:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Now wait a minute, here here!  trump was a teacher too, at his own university!  What? trump never even held a class? The university was sued and had to close?  Never mind.
1316911667582803970 2020-10-16 09:19:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @stonecold2050 @MSNBC_rocks_ Melanoma must be bummin'!
1316911341265965062 2020-10-16 09:18:25 +0800 <JUthergi> "oh mr president, you have such a lovely smile".  He didn't answer that woman's questions either!
1316910871570976768 2020-10-16 09:16:33 +0800 <JUthergi> How much of the wall, that Mexico is now using to keep US Citizens out of Mex, is still standing?  Pretty shoddy design and foolish placement by the donnie's builder!
1316909465338339328 2020-10-16 09:10:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow jr!  Really packing them in! Is this your announcement to run for president?
1316908233169186818 2020-10-16 09:06:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @LeeHolly81 @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @cspan They look like vampires
1316903955700584448 2020-10-16 08:49:04 +0800 <JUthergi> A woman to challenge "the donnie" is all we need to see his orange balloon head explode?  Trump is melting down, again!!!
1316902247066980355 2020-10-16 08:42:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh jr! So courageous!  Stepping out from daddy's shadow, you can save us all!  Jr for pres 2024, start the campaign paperwork now bc vanky wants to beat you !  PS we heard she got the daddy to write you out of the will before next bankruptcy, so watch out!
1316900389288017922 2020-10-16 08:34:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Are there any problems that he identified in his ramblings that he actually fixed?  Just 1?  Doesn't count if he caused the problem and made an incredible claim that he alone fixed it...
1316897013863153664 2020-10-16 08:21:29 +0800 <JUthergi> How can WTP, of which I've never heard anyone say; " vote endless incumbencies for our elected elite, they do such a good job of looking out for us!"  If the elected elite don't agree with us, they have far more tools to silence us than we do for them?
1316814116158410753 2020-10-16 02:52:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @girlsreallyrule @ReportsDaNews Is the state not for sale bc the "donors" he sold out to won't give it back to the people?
1316812732759408645 2020-10-16 02:46:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  One of a triple gazillion reasons why do many people don't like you, no matter how much you pander and beg for it!  Which is scarier? trump virus or trump tantrum after losing election by a miraculous turn out of WTP that stand for the ideals of this Republic?
1316807116888432647 2020-10-16 02:24:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Quit gloating mac! The only way this could be true is if you owned our government! Oh, right. How foolish of me, i thought our government was of the people, by the people and for the people but obviously you paid enough to control our elected elite!
1316746693916884993 2020-10-15 22:24:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Fired for not being good enough to be trump's personal atty.?
1316745762911531009 2020-10-15 22:20:28 +0800 <JUthergi> donnie who?
1316745184168869890 2020-10-15 22:18:10 +0800 <JUthergi> mr hammhead, sir? Are there any new polls from your entertainment network that show Hunter losing to trump in this election? What, Hunter is not running 4 pres? Oh. Is this just you angling for a cabinet position again?  Hammhead for Minister if DISinformation!!!  You go, boy!
1316742356356526081 2020-10-15 22:06:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe the trees have little labels attached with daddy's signature?  More likely she's trying to brand herself an environmentalist for her presidential run...
1316737776025579520 2020-10-15 21:48:44 +0800 <JUthergi> I would just have to ask him to prove that he is not Jethro from Beverly Hills. Prove he gradiated 5th grade and that he's not related to Grannie Uncle Jed and Ellie Mae!
1316734618939293699 2020-10-15 21:36:11 +0800 <JUthergi> At the very least we need to exorcize the ghouliani! To bad churches only let men do that work bc, well, our new judge!
1316733295787466752 2020-10-15 21:30:56 +0800 <JUthergi> I guess that he talks about winning so much that we'll ask him to stop he was only referring to his personal wins.
1316732417760260099 2020-10-15 21:27:26 +0800 <JUthergi> So the only reason he's there, is not bc he cares about the people?  He just wants them to vote for him and they get nothing in return?  Oh, my bad. They will get the trump virus, death, starvation and no work...
1316729341208911872 2020-10-15 21:15:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Love your work! Since our elected elite and those who would wrap themselves in our flag have seemingly rebranded the term Patriot, could those of us that believe the ideals upon which this last greatest hope on earth be called Countrymen?
1316726421440598018 2020-10-15 21:03:37 +0800 <JUthergi> The most discouraging part of this article is not the absolute corruption that could collapse our last greatest hope on earth...it is will any trump supporters even read it?  TY Mr Frum!  BTW, is it 25th Ammendment Day?
1316510207791509521 2020-10-15 06:44:27 +0800 <JUthergi> How is it possible that this became acceptable to maga people?  This pic doesn't show all the others under indictment, (30?), and all the pending criminal indictments for trump &amp; family.  It is incomprehensible
1316457870288920576 2020-10-15 03:16:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it odd the only right citizens are supposed to have to address the gov for grievances, is the one that our future scotus member forgets?  They stifle our speach, the press helps. Right to assemble compromised by "Patriot" Act. Relig and gov are almost ready for honeymoon! HELP
1316381068774309889 2020-10-14 22:11:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Guessing we can never again refer to "the dignity of the presidency"?
1316379768842051584 2020-10-14 22:06:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Something the trump family would NEVER do because of such high moral integrity! Right donnie jr?  Lol, any proof yet? Even billy boy barr is having trouble with proof of President Biden &amp; family illegal acts. Btw, you take that court ordered class on HOW NOT TO STEAL from kid's?
1316377139193806848 2020-10-14 21:55:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Quite acceptable now days. But it's been rebranded!  Once you pay a fee, you can have an anullment!  Got children? No probs, pay more &amp; the kids become illegitimate!  Works great for tax purposes and alimony denials...
1316366102851710980 2020-10-14 21:11:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! When I get to be his age I sure hope whatever rx they're doping him with is avail for us poor peons!  Can't imagine disco dancing like bozo the clown though...
1316129430251679744 2020-10-14 05:31:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @wolfblitzer  Not a fan of sen pelosi but gotta say her slap down spank on you wolfi was priceless.  As a news entertainment reporter she called you out for thinking those outside current negotiations don't know what they're talking about either!  But you respect everyone, right?
1316117377453568005 2020-10-14 04:43:29 +0800 <JUthergi> All we need is stewie! Brianna Stewart in the house!
1316113383222059018 2020-10-14 04:27:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Every working class citizens, no, every citizen needs to read the Powell Memo that Expendable We dug up 4 WTP.   TY! Couldn't be more timely with the scotus show, elections and shameless power grabs by our beloved elected elite! Please, for the sake of all, Read &amp; Retweet!
1316075719844417536 2020-10-14 01:57:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Although this speaks directly to gop, it us also true if the dems.  WTP, have we had enough yet?  TY Mr Cooke!!!
1316069515600498689 2020-10-14 01:33:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Another great entertainment reporter confirming her grasp for the obvious!  Isn't it the job of the fourth estate to uncover dark money / nefarious intent of the elected elite?  Oh, my bad. Forgot about the dissolution of the fairness doctrine that allows 4 entertainment reports!
1316067816232161281 2020-10-14 01:26:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @emmiegray @sharnettereese1 @Chicago1Ray @FLOTUS To be one of putin's top asset handlers, uglier is better... See how well "the donnie" is performing? She works hard for her money!
1316066442132029448 2020-10-14 01:21:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @tedcruz  It's do wonderful that you bring up ACB long distinguished judicial record.  When did you guys appoint her, 2017 was it?  Life appointment for 3 yrs actual practiced experience?  Was that a jab bc the donnie didn't appoint you???  roflmho
1316064709880287232 2020-10-14 01:14:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh jr, all the tough questions to another if daddy's girls got you triggered?  What are you doing up already?
1316060507749724163 2020-10-14 00:57:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @kcrknp @pamgriffa @Merv515 @Yamiche @SenFeinstein How could she ever be nominated by trump without pledging him unquestionable loyalty?  We already know that is 1st requirement to be part of trump circle!
1316054213357641728 2020-10-14 00:32:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Hand raised!  Now how many good countrymen trust Mickey Mouse more than the donnie?
1316053657784324097 2020-10-14 00:30:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @lasienk @Only_Sn0wman @Amy_Siskind Mockery, isn't that the last stronghold of ignorant cowardice???
1316053144930050048 2020-10-14 00:28:15 +0800 <JUthergi> ...after only 3 mos in service.   https://t.co/NhPCkeX3ne ran story about his inappropriate behaviors, (before don't ask don't tell policy), and reason he was not dd was bc his daddy's pd for powerful politicians assisted and ushered mc con all into politics. Now KY is on knees!
1316046431447404546 2020-10-14 00:01:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Kind of like Col. Custard? His hair color is like the losing Col too! Bet that mask he says he carries us actually a white flag!
1316044772667281408 2020-10-13 23:54:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @sahilkapur Poor l'il lindsie sounds jealous he's not getting enough money. It seems like he knows he's lost and he's just crying for $ to take home with him...
1316043645301260289 2020-10-13 23:50:30 +0800 <JUthergi> The old sick guy that saved a gazillion lives here in America by proving trump virus a hoax because it only killed 1/2 mil people and only infected 7mil mire people before the end of his term.  Forget his name though, was it the donnie?
1316041203104780302 2020-10-13 23:40:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Is today our cherished 25th Ammendment Day?
1316037266721124353 2020-10-13 23:25:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @MSNBC_rocks_ Me! Bought a clipper and trained myself! Wife won't let me out in public anymore, quarantine or not! She thinks I look  so ugly that I look like a dog whose butt was shaved and taught to walk backwards!!!  Ain't love grand?
1316031742873133057 2020-10-13 23:03:12 +0800 <JUthergi> TY for that info! Here i was thinking he was Jethro from Beverly Hills all growed up after gradiating 5th grade!  Left Granny Uncle Jed &amp; Ellie Mae to go to DC!
1316028868394876928 2020-10-13 22:51:47 +0800 <JUthergi> When real actors meet the pretend actors...
1316016743270117376 2020-10-13 22:03:36 +0800 <JUthergi> No self respecting maga supporter would wear a mask in this hoax, right?  Look at all those voters in masks!   Blue looks good on you, go Texas!!!
1316011891550941186 2020-10-13 21:44:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Great! Can't wait for mine!   How about WTP submit to vaccines/cures AFTER a televised event that shows pres senators congress people and SCOTUS all taking the vaccines/cures themselves.  Then WTP wait 6 mos to see if any of them are still alive?  WTP are not your guinea pigs!!!
1316009881506181124 2020-10-13 21:36:20 +0800 <JUthergi> mitch, do you mean to say that you're not proud of your time in the US Army?  You really need to be truthful about that behavior unbecoming a soldier!   Remember how you needed daddy &amp; daddy's politicians to help you off your knees &amp; into politics???  Tell us about that!
1316008074478579712 2020-10-13 21:29:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Moscow's mitch mc con all has profited immensely while Kentucky citizens suffer !
1316006973800951808 2020-10-13 21:24:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Time is up for mc con all! Please KY! Do something for us all, bring Amy Mcgrath to the senate!
1316003202865737729 2020-10-13 21:09:48 +0800 <JUthergi> *prove
1316003054831968257 2020-10-13 21:09:13 +0800 <JUthergi> But of course, the 3 appeals judges were trump appointees.  Who is stacking the federal judiciary for political motivations?  Not moscow's mitch, right?
1316001368390369285 2020-10-13 21:02:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @Advancedape2E He's starting to move like the trump baby balloon seen throughout europe!  Sure wish we had them here!
1315999002589093888 2020-10-13 20:53:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  You may feel powerful, drugs do that to a person, but you really come across as a weak scared dottering old man.  Please don't kill anymore of us pretending the donnie virus that you let in to our country is still a hoax.
1315996368801071104 2020-10-13 20:42:39 +0800 <JUthergi> It was pretty obvious the "protest" was only for exploitation and ego.
1315758117544767491 2020-10-13 04:55:55 +0800 <JUthergi> How ironic that on a day to celebrate the first people's of America, the government that practiced genocide is now pushing for a SCOTUS nominee whose religion requires she adhere to the Doctrine of Discovery designed to decimate Native People.  Court used doc to break treaties...
1315732375830253580 2020-10-13 03:13:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! Look at all of trump's accomplishments!!!  Am I better off than 4 yrs ago?   Oh, dear lord...help us, please???
1315731250238361605 2020-10-13 03:09:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Why does trump never questions moscow mitchie's service of &lt;3 mos when political connections got him out of army service, apparently for conduct unbecoming a soldier?   Highly inappropriate behaviors prior to don't ask don't tell policy of the army?   https://t.co/NhPCkeX3ne info
1315727963321757696 2020-10-13 02:56:06 +0800 <JUthergi> But isn't that the job of our elected elite?
1315727297916407809 2020-10-13 02:53:27 +0800 <JUthergi> That's bc this is what trump actually means when he says he's winning bigly!  His distraction tactics put the press and all our laws to shame...
1315725714356871168 2020-10-13 02:47:09 +0800 <JUthergi> trumpy's legal eaglets spanked in PA TX too!  Strike 3 yet out donnie! Next batter!  Hey donnie! That's not your ball, give it back &amp; just go home!
1315723798994391040 2020-10-13 02:39:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @tribelaw WHAAAT? He finally released the long awaited health plan and I missed it!  Been waiting almost 4 yrs &amp; no one told me?  It's because I'm just a lowly citizen, isn't it?
1315719977530544129 2020-10-13 02:24:22 +0800 <JUthergi> What a good son... to put all the blame on!
1315719719010414592 2020-10-13 02:23:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Be careful when presenting facts to our pretend pres!  It could be offensive to him &amp; he doesn't play well with others!
1315713559691767810 2020-10-13 01:58:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  Hey jr! Heeeres Hunter!  Did your kids cancer "charity" ever feed anyone? PS Did eric rat you guys out at the depo? Is that why you &amp; vanky are hiding?
1315711520228155392 2020-10-13 01:50:45 +0800 <JUthergi> The same religion that wrote the Doctrine of Discovery that directs the absolute decimation of cultures not bowing to Rome? The same religion that forced children into schools to kill the Indian &amp; spare the child?  The same religion that allows divorce via anullment for $?  Oh...
1315710192416415744 2020-10-13 01:45:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Someone should tell the chosen immune guy with the new "glow" that it's just a new bottle of makeup they slather on him so he doesn't look like the walking dead...
1315708111630499841 2020-10-13 01:37:13 +0800 <JUthergi> More like an untied balloon, set free to fly about the room bouncing off walls or other objects until it deflates and drops like a disposed condom yo the floor...
1315706754823585802 2020-10-13 01:31:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Proud of his obstruction of the senate in doing it's job? Well, why he is obstructing the job of gov to write and pass laws?  How many bills are sitting on his desk along with the Cares Act, designed to help WTP?  What a swell human being. (Super wealthy elite little liar)
1315687083823058945 2020-10-13 00:13:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity Fascism &amp; it's leaders reeaally hate Anti Fascists don't they?  Surprising that such a fantastically incredibly unbelievable tremendous entertainer type guy like you can't figure that out...  If you widen your soc circle mr hammhead, you could learn stuff like this!
1315685023803113476 2020-10-13 00:05:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Sure, ok!  But how can anyone hear WTP when the halls of justice, congress &amp; senate are filled with the best sound proofing money can buy?  It seems that none in that shining city on the hill want a d mned thing  to do with WTP, least of all is to listen to our needs...
1315683381968019458 2020-10-12 23:58:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe lil lindsie didn't consider this man or his neighbors needs for a good reason?  Seriously, how could rural citizens ever afford to buy his time?  Did they contribute $millions to his campaign over the decades? Did they ask to change laws to enhance their income?  Well, then
1315680217785077760 2020-10-12 23:46:22 +0800 <JUthergi> SCOTUS relied on D of D to rescind &amp; restrict Indigenous Rights, despite USC claiming all men are equal.  Catholic Pope, although aware of the D of D's devastating effects on the people has yet to rescind the bull.  How will ACB reconcile rights of all Americans with canon law?
1315678320336539648 2020-10-12 23:38:50 +0800 <JUthergi> the right to exist and own land, with established treaties of Indigenous Americans?  How will nominee reconcile this papal bull that directs the death, destruction of food shelter, rape of women &amp; children to abolish entire cultures that do not confirm to Catholicism?
1315675975708028928 2020-10-12 23:29:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @senjudiciary  As you rush to stick another judge onto the bench, there is much discussion about religious belief.  Baptised/Confirmed Catholic as a child, but my search for truth shook my foundations of belief.  SCOTUS allows Doctrine of Discovery to rule to this day,
1315666960814944256 2020-10-12 22:53:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like trump is getting those hotels built in turkey! Did trump write erdogan love letters too?
1315666211196276739 2020-10-12 22:50:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Russia moves on Syrian &amp; Kurdish People like our donnie Sr, the love machine, moves on married women!
1315406435019350016 2020-10-12 05:38:27 +0800 <JUthergi> So the fight starts now?   I get it. Better late etc?  Where were you, of our elected elite, when he refused the prev admin hundreds of fed appointments over 8 yrs.???
1315404888982147072 2020-10-12 05:32:19 +0800 <JUthergi> But, trump always yells out at everyone LAW &amp; ORDER!  Could it be possible that our impeached pres misunderstood that laws are for everyone?  A lot of very smart people in the elected elite would agree with him, you know, bc they can!
1315403749209313280 2020-10-12 05:27:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Judge ordered that donnie jr vanky &amp; eric all take mandatory class in how TO NOT STEAL from charities. They are also forever banned from opening any further charities in ny. It's a family thingy
1315397748968087555 2020-10-12 05:03:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Mikey pences fly was on the wall. He said that trump thanked judge and said that the judges kid now could start work Monday morning in the WH. Then trump said the pay was $7.25 per hour! That trump! What a joker!
1315394270363291648 2020-10-12 04:50:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Gee, don't they like the graham crackers guy?
1315290810745839619 2020-10-11 21:59:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Rocket man and donnie sitting in a tree, k i s s i n g! First comes love, then comes... Poor donnie, lost another love but look at the great parting gifts he gets!
1315282241807962112 2020-10-11 21:24:57 +0800 <JUthergi> C'mon people, this Christmas thingy and someone's kids are not her job. Putin's directives to our favorite melanoma are quite explicit, focus on trump and see that he follows my orders!
1315280646391107584 2020-10-11 21:18:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Just more proof that the poor are desperate for work. When trump claims to be the jobs pres, remember this rally. It just about covers the jobs he has actually created v his grandiose claims.
1315033524949397505 2020-10-11 04:56:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Saw your wh rally. Couldn't afford to pay 2k strangers to dress alike &amp; pretend to love you?  All minorities, only a few whts like you.  Why no mention of these programs for poor rural wht folk?  We're your base, you forget us?  We got no jobs! No health ins!
1315030066552860673 2020-10-11 04:42:54 +0800 <JUthergi> He's been watching our elected elite scam the system for personal enrichment and thought why not get some?  Swamp water attracts only the nastiest critters, right?
1315028424050737152 2020-10-11 04:36:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Never met a person that claimed a foreigner took their job.  Didn't all this happen ca. depression era when the elected elite, failing at their jobs, sought to distract and divide us?  Seems that the only working system politics gave us is the system to divide and conquer us!
1315026586186526720 2020-10-11 04:29:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't help but to wonder where all the other survivors are, don't they all debillating residual affects?  His miraculous recovery just doesn't seem right.  Was it all a stage show to keep our attention for the final act?
1315007558499921920 2020-10-11 03:13:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow mitch. you going to just let this go?   trump is actively trying to destroy you guys bc you're not campaigning for him.  mitch, only you could convince some cabinet member to draft the 25th A letter and still keep your coveted positions!  Fight back before he destroys gop!
1315005680554840064 2020-10-11 03:06:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Every single drs office says the same...
1315004818050744320 2020-10-11 03:02:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't forget all of you proud Kentuckians, mad mitch has also made you the biggest welfare state by sucking up fed tax $ paid by blue states.  That's pretty embarrassing considering what a proud state you were before mitch made himself rich!  Save us Kentucky, DITCH mitch!
1315002566393188352 2020-10-11 02:53:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Sure looked like stage props to us...
1314996797786513408 2020-10-11 02:30:42 +0800 <JUthergi> It looked like a staged production rather than actual supporters.  The few minutes seen showed audience approval only when he blathered something about how great he was for the only 2 minorities he's aware of.  On a moment's notice 500 ppl show up in the same outfits, up front?
1314993031343411200 2020-10-11 02:15:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are they more concerned with power when we are dying?
1314988787680903169 2020-10-11 01:58:52 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Ok, since my heart dropped reading your response, can I hide out at your place a while?  Just until 25th Ammendment Day?  I wear a haz mat suit with my own o2 drink disinfectant and if there is a purple hue coming from my backside...well, nm. I think there is a pandemic going on.
1314985354773106688 2020-10-11 01:45:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Don't think a fed pardon works for felonious state crimes. We are a union of independent free states. That was the plan. Not quite sure anymore
1314948472748077061 2020-10-10 23:18:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Let's take back our power!  The one party wi 2 faces that has so efficiently divided us needs to be divided by us.  WTP make our elected elite tremble in fear, when we vote!  Then our work begins to repair the machine.  Hippies did it. Pot legal. Hair cuts not.  Power 2 People!
1314933622558859264 2020-10-10 22:19:40 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's best, most direct response to the question of pre EC med coverage...  So insightful, such eloquence, the forethought &amp; specifics!  More of the incredibly unbelievable!
1314929658144620544 2020-10-10 22:03:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Looking for insight, tried to think like trump, it hurt. tv guy lying in bed, gets idea to save his campaign? Tweets. If they think I have C19, they'll feel bad 4 me I show my power to recover, sell my cure, no more tests, I am the greatest! Vote 4 me! Tv focus all on me! What if
1314924065111629824 2020-10-10 21:41:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Remember when you sent that bird to Sen Sanders podium during his campaign? Beautiful sign we just seemed to ignore. maybe an eagle could be sent to trump's podium today and as a sign for us to vote him out, could the bird maybe drop a turd? On the head of the speaker? Please?
1314747770604007425 2020-10-10 10:01:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @GreenEyesSeeU @hugolowell Saving that for his Florida rally on Monday.
1314746221416906753 2020-10-10 09:55:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @writesuntildawn @SteveSchmidtSES Great point! TY  But to answer your question, I think the elected elite took our money to sound proof those walls long ago.  They don't want to hear us...
1314744823199535105 2020-10-10 09:49:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Who can help this worthy charity? 4ericsmile.trumpcharity
1314743557312389122 2020-10-10 09:44:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @Sharon11609729 @FLBlueBird1 @sunnyinjax2 Don't know trump's pov. Hurt my head w/ reflex laugh, thinking about trump thinking earth is flat.  Who can really conceptualize what exists in the minds...of MADmen!
1314700477330845699 2020-10-10 06:53:14 +0800 <JUthergi> We reeaally need all of our former Presidents to speak out for the sake of OUR REPUBLIC!  WTP have relied upon your leadership for the past 4+ decades.  If there was ever a time that our country was in absolute peril, it is now as we stare into the abyss of destruction!  SOS!!!
1314694041980764161 2020-10-10 06:27:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Any chance you have a vid if that debate? The teams at Lincoln Project and Meidas could do wonders with it. Anything to defeat that critter, right?
1314690935922601984 2020-10-10 06:15:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Wasn't there someone else in history that taught us to honor The Creator above all else and love each other as we would ourselves?  Didn't he sacrificed his life, his blood and soul that we might all be reconciled with The Creator?  What is your sacrifice???
1314685661107150854 2020-10-10 05:54:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir, a politician that truly works for WTP!  Did you notice, Rep Porter didn't try to take credit by putting a letter in the pkgs!  Imagine that?
1314683695538810881 2020-10-10 05:46:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like our dear leader is pretending to be a dictator again!  Don't they all speak from balconies or raised platforms to present the optics that they are above us lowly peons?
1314682390867042310 2020-10-10 05:41:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow, the pineapple guy should have stayed in, wait? Bob dole the politician? Still alive?  My bad, good to see he hasn't lost that myopic gop p.o.v. good health to you sir.  Don't let donnie Sr. Infect you too!
1314680686645837825 2020-10-10 05:34:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @FLBlueBird1 @sunnyinjax2 Twins? Did i miss trump bringing up that this mailman's actions could hurt his opponent?  trump's unerring compass for truth and fairness is an example for all, right?
1314671548859641857 2020-10-10 04:58:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Finally! TY  Been trying to get this term traction since January.  My pc Dr said I might have it, last Oct but not to worry, could be stressed.  He referred me to Crimson Report of 10/19 and then had to change my boots.  I think all md knew something but wanted no panic wi WTP!
1314669686257319939 2020-10-10 04:50:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  sir, is it true? These guys really are just using you to get power!  Don't they work "at your pleasure"! Fire them before they succeed in helping the dems overthrow you!  Why are so many of your own team trying to destroy you? Not fair, jealous of you!!!
1314667411472343041 2020-10-10 04:41:50 +0800 <JUthergi> And while we sit aghast by our tv the politicians, instead of helping WTP, are actively looking to spend $ hundreds of mills in lawyers to determine our next pres.  WTP might get that $ to survive IF we just vote out gop!  Besides the wealthy, IS ANYONE BETTER OFF than 4 yrs ago?
1314660246887989248 2020-10-10 04:13:22 +0800 <JUthergi> His hubris... please Kentucky, please? WTP need you!
1314659117928263683 2020-10-10 04:08:53 +0800 <JUthergi> This idea could actually give merit to UBI.  It seems that this kind of stimulus actually helps citizens.  Oh, what am I saying?  Our elected elite are sworn to help only corporate citizens...
1314655193070436354 2020-10-10 03:53:17 +0800 <JUthergi> trump was so offended that the clinton camp wouldn't accept him back then.  Was revenge his only motivation in running for POTUS?  Btw, are the boys wearing tweedledee &amp; tweedledum matching prison shirts? (Logo hard to see)  Nostradamus type preview of the future?
1314653287593971713 2020-10-10 03:45:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Grabbing every penny in their attempts to remain relevant.    Guess they can't call it "clean" energy anymore!  Good thing they still think oil/ gas is the future bc where would our elected elite get their bribes , sorry, campaign $ to change laws for oil/gas?
1314652249751269376 2020-10-10 03:41:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  In mal-a-lago country?  sir, did you know about this?  Shut them down!  you're the ultimate authority and nobody disobeys YOUR orders!  you can't let these people personally offend you by choosing your opponent, in your backyard?  Show us your real power!
1314650672902615040 2020-10-10 03:35:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Does that count for the guy in wh that's above the laws?
1314648118101774338 2020-10-10 03:25:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  That's right sir! You nailed it! That's the ticket and you figured out their strategy!  They aren't thinking 25th A for you at all.   Really, what could you have done deserving such mean treatment by that mean lady that will become our pres?  You do what you do!
1314646991012593667 2020-10-10 03:20:42 +0800 <JUthergi> 210k+ dead American Citizens &amp; counting.  Not 1 of the elected elite has called for just 1 min, 1min of silence or prayer.  And we will keep dying bc some self entitled babbling carnival barking buffoon is pretending to be a leader so he doesn't go to jail?  Are we bankrupt yet?
1314645385508421635 2020-10-10 03:14:19 +0800 <JUthergi> The more effort he expends pretending to be a tough guy world leader, the more the world laughs.   Of course, we all then tremble in fear because this madman is just beginning to show how absolutely mad bonkers  looney toons crazy he can be!  Is it 25th Ammendment Day yet???
1314600989308211200 2020-10-10 00:17:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! People are cutting off their own hands to show their support for you!!!
1314599463885955074 2020-10-10 00:11:50 +0800 <JUthergi> He must have hired more goats to maintain the lawns...
1314598262989619205 2020-10-10 00:07:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh poor jr. Did you ever consider that only your army of stable geniuses supporting daddy are the only ones that need to wrap themselves in our flag to feel secure?
1314596466749575170 2020-10-09 23:59:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Admittedly, most of your twittering is at best confusing, but this forces me to ask; do you really think that you count?   vanky &amp; jare are not going to let you do anything when they seize control. They're out to get you for leaking all the wrong info.  Did eric get arrested yet?
1314594556063690759 2020-10-09 23:52:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Good insight into the chaos that is our pres and how he further exposed our weakness to the enemies.  Let the Generals decide!
1314587540863807489 2020-10-09 23:24:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh no! So did trump stick one of his 'i did it all bc I'm the only one that could" letters in each pkg, again ???
1314578848562974720 2020-10-09 22:49:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @The_Lone_Apple @grandpooba5440 @glennkirschner2 Sure hope so. trump has always been a scorched earth type of being...
1314578106947117056 2020-10-09 22:46:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Good insight as to how many wealthy politicians "legally" obtained ppp loans to help fund their campaigns.  Their constituents could lose their jobs, their homes and be starving, but hey, we always need elected elite to scam the system. Right?
1314574243406000129 2020-10-09 22:31:37 +0800 <JUthergi> The art of war teaches the greatest victory comes without firing a shot... not a quote, but same message and Russia has excelled at creating chaos throughout our world.
1314572893918031875 2020-10-09 22:26:16 +0800 <JUthergi> If not for the FBI these lunatics would have executed a sitting gov.  What part of "well regulated militia" do these anarchists not understand?  It's actions like this that force governments to act against all people!  Beware the man who accuses others of coming for our guns!
1314564912249819138 2020-10-09 21:54:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment Day?
1314564218482561024 2020-10-09 21:51:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Thought the trump virus would miraculously disappear...well, at least we'll have a vaccine as any minute now!  Can't wait for captain contagion's cure all! Maybe it will taste good with trump steaks?
1314341063671394306 2020-10-09 07:05:03 +0800 <JUthergi> jr is obviously lonely.   Maybe eric got sent to jail already or maybe he begins the tell all?  Either way, beevus and butthead are in for a rough ride... Expect tweetstorm to distract attention from daddy's failures?
1314337467340926976 2020-10-09 06:50:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Not much of a defense against bio warfare, if the enemy can give it to our country and our own president spreads it around and denies it happened.  Looks like we lost ww3.  Time to rebuild. Give thanks that our losses were not comperable to the feared nukes!
1314332445886615554 2020-10-09 06:30:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Any chance pres zero will hire more of "the best people"?  Seems like he sunk so many of his own that the drain to the swamp is permanently blocked.
1314328901993275392 2020-10-09 06:16:43 +0800 <JUthergi> So, another day passes and it's still not time to invoke 25th Ammendment?
1314309817637445634 2020-10-09 05:00:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @EugJHawk @realDonaldTrump When they mentioned Independence Day i thought it was a reference to the film.  Nasty trick! Was expecting wh to blow up and it was only a commercial?  It's Soo hard to not be disappointed when destructo donnie speaks.
1314307170691932161 2020-10-09 04:50:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Now, who do we know that fits this description?
1314306781296893980 2020-10-09 04:48:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Somebody told him he has to debate and follow rules for civil conduct expected of a gentleman.  He's been in the bunker ever since!
1314224954158833667 2020-10-08 23:23:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Could it be the adderall cartels?
1314220844332314626 2020-10-08 23:07:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Oh please, you can't skip the debates!  How will you ever project what a bigly powerful virus eating man beast you are if you're afraid to debate the guy you call senile?  It'll be like taking candy from babies that you enjoy so much!  be donnie the debate dude!
1314215597744422913 2020-10-08 22:46:30 +0800 <JUthergi> How is it, that in the entirety of the bldg with all the other people present this fly gets in and goes straight to the only decaying matter to be found?  Is that guy some kind of zombie?
1314213976419385345 2020-10-08 22:40:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Intervention anyone?
1314213596264505347 2020-10-08 22:38:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! Now it's tucker, next it'll be hammity! Those treasonous traitors are all out to get you!  you're the ultimate authority and no one disobeys your orders so you better shut down these enemies trying to destroy you!  Oh, the horror of betrayal...
1314210904418865160 2020-10-08 22:27:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look sir! The fake news enemy of the people is attacking you again.   Betrayal and conspiracy designed to hurt your feelings!  Demand this disinformation channel be taken off the air!!!
1314209008652181504 2020-10-08 22:20:19 +0800 <JUthergi> mikey took some of donnie's 'talk too much pills', and mikey liked it!  Isn't there something called Robert's Rule of Order that governs civilized debates?  Our p &amp; vp are like children in the classroom when teacher steps out for a minute.
1314205439588925449 2020-10-08 22:06:08 +0800 <JUthergi> The "leader" has no clue as to what a debate is about.  Can't do it virtually bc he needs to confront? Too entitled to be forced to shut up as rules dictate?  Isn't a debate a forum for civilized ladies/gents to discuss ideas/solutions?  He turns our world into a sit com...
1314030109301575681 2020-10-08 10:29:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Thank you Sir! Still laughing, seemed like minutes up there! Sure hope SNL writers saw it !!!
1313952706621566979 2020-10-08 05:21:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it coincidence that this is roughly the same amount of women he has "allegedly",(smirk), assaulted?  Seems consistent in his disregard for humanity.
1313897063239888897 2020-10-08 01:40:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Poor hammhead!  Ratings down so low and book sales even lower that you are hawking oral appliances?  Maybe it's time to follow vanky's advice... retrain!  I hear stand up comedy is worthy of your "talents", but you can't use a script!
1313894231845597184 2020-10-08 01:29:30 +0800 <JUthergi> in trump's America this is happening? How could he betray us like this?  Good thing we learned that Jesus the Nazarene had no use for temples. All his teachings of Our Creator's Kingdom were held outside, where people gathered in his name to bring God into their midst...
1313892779123245057 2020-10-08 01:23:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump So what if they close down all the churches?  you, as the self proclaimed "chosen one" could rebuild all the temples in the world at once!  Shout out your power!
1313887414012784646 2020-10-08 01:02:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Likely he ate hamberder roll without leaving a trail of crumbs to follow home. Too bad.
1313884976904052738 2020-10-08 00:52:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Will pence resign after getting spanked by Harris tonight?  Plan for daddy to replace him wi vanky, who in turn becomes pres when trump virus incapacitates daddy.  The new queen pardons daddy and beheads jared, jr &amp; eric to secure power.  melanoma gets beheaded for kicks...  Help
1313878707698884608 2020-10-08 00:27:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @UncleOdit putin's top handler, angry that she has to work with such a buffoon?
1313878214331297794 2020-10-08 00:25:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @Danielsand @texaslawdog101 @amandawgolden @Popehat Good point, but you mention rational folks then mag next breath. Rationale and mag are diametrically opposed.
1313862386948935682 2020-10-07 23:22:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it 25th Ammendment day?
1313618148990554112 2020-10-07 07:12:27 +0800 <JUthergi> But mikey liked it!
1313616228729135106 2020-10-07 07:04:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! This guy really knows the pres!
1313615900348747778 2020-10-07 07:03:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Is the nominee infected yet? Her kids?
1313615060305149952 2020-10-07 07:00:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Is everybody in trump's cabinet too sick to draft the 25th Ammendment?  Then get busy!
1313614172584902658 2020-10-07 06:56:39 +0800 <JUthergi> He feels great that his virus killed over 210k if the citizens he swore to protect? I feel sick...
1313611847476670465 2020-10-07 06:47:24 +0800 <JUthergi> These entertainment shows about someone talking about someone else's opinion of somebody somewhere who supposedly said something, are not very entertaining.  Bring back the fairness doctrine so WTP can see news again!
1313611069072568322 2020-10-07 06:44:19 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Rep Porter!  I seem to remember some guy bragging about doing all the work you are doing. He's the same guy that will claim credit for your efforts. He gets free med care and apparently all the drugs he wants.  You are the only Rep with the courage to help!!!  TY!
1313609289978851328 2020-10-07 06:37:15 +0800 <JUthergi> Did mitch bend over and say thank you, or did he get on his knees, like when he was in the service then say yes your highness?
1313608148817711106 2020-10-07 06:32:42 +0800 <JUthergi> This is encouraging.   If I understand correctly then trump or the senate and congress would never be allowed to own guns due to their collective mental impairments?  Hope springs eternal in the USA, we just gotta keep looking!
1313604917811179520 2020-10-07 06:19:52 +0800 <JUthergi> These people need haz mat suits, or maybe find a mechanical problem every time the pres wants to go spread his virus?
1313603250466123776 2020-10-07 06:13:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @PraetorianGua10 @grandpooba5440 @Logitics82 @IvankaTrump Plastic surgery is expensive, you know?
1313602135444131841 2020-10-07 06:08:49 +0800 <JUthergi> mikey DOESN'T like it? Maybe he doesn't like to debate an intelligent woman that could make him subservient?
1313583678744915971 2020-10-07 04:55:28 +0800 <JUthergi> News flash! trump angry that stocks dropped when he further delayed help for WTP! So he took even more drugs and set OUR HOUSE ablaze!  Run for your lives!
1313538248631877632 2020-10-07 01:54:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Communication device so ivanka &amp;jared can tell him what to do and say. Been there for many many months. donnie destructor couldn't get advisors to agree to ivanka over pence for vp, Soo he made her de facto pres. jared helps on dirty deeds done dirt cheap...
1313536727508824064 2020-10-07 01:48:54 +0800 <JUthergi> No way this could be fake news!!!
1313536208069427200 2020-10-07 01:46:50 +0800 <JUthergi> But. But trump said let there be light and he invented the world, right? So everything ever made is really bc he's the only one that could do it? Sorry. Just living on the edge and trying to laugh at myself...
1313534810376278017 2020-10-07 01:41:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently that's why moscow's mitch called for another 2 wk paid vacation.  Pretty amazing that with all this tech available to communicate ol mitch is afraid to work because even his own are ready to eat him alive.
1313484656331894789 2020-10-06 22:22:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Thought this was a pic of a cornered rat, after a double take I couldn't convince myself otherwise.
1313482114097127425 2020-10-06 22:11:53 +0800 <JUthergi> How did this thing come back to life? Is someone channelling the dead for another "promise to America"?
1313481185948045314 2020-10-06 22:08:12 +0800 <JUthergi> This IS the trump virus!
1313479809306112000 2020-10-06 22:02:44 +0800 <JUthergi> We've all seen trumpy try to throw a ball and the comedy of him trying to catch one. This clown compares an obese Sr to a robust qb?  Love the "news"!
1313475196322484231 2020-10-06 21:44:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Another genius apparently unaware that his lordy trump was a demon democrat,  and after suffering from rejection became a rino.
1313470595183632384 2020-10-06 21:26:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently the conquered one thinks he is the conquerer?  He also thinks he's more relatable to WTP suffering from the trump virus. Did anyone tell him over 210k people died bc they didn't have a chance to be treated @ WRH?
1313468725903929346 2020-10-06 21:18:41 +0800 <JUthergi> kac at work kac at home
1313467225148448771 2020-10-06 21:12:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @kenjeong Just trying to look powerful but all I saw was a weak ignorant narcissist making a fool of himself. Btw, what was that pathetic salute for? Seemed to have difficulty holding arm up while trying to catch breath.
1313462727902408708 2020-10-06 20:54:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Someone from CPS needs to look into mommy dearest and her very stable emotional parenting skills.
1313460634797985792 2020-10-06 20:46:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Did someone just buy stock in flu vaccines?
1313458901036208136 2020-10-06 20:39:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Polls say... A whole lot of nothing. The polls are as useful to WTP as entertainment "news".  Please ignore the pundits and vote in the most important election in the history of country.
1313256524798726144 2020-10-06 07:15:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! Mr strong and healthy looked ready to pass out after taking off mask to look more powerful!  Sweat beading and totally out of breath!  Poor guy, actually has a face that calls for a mask!
1313251907343978498 2020-10-06 06:57:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews  Was it Dr. Steve Bannon that mixed a cocktail to control his rage tweets and then turned into the incredible hulk?  Good heavens, what's next? An orange rubenesque hulk that rampages throughout voting stations???
1313248498398171136 2020-10-06 06:43:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Hooray! Just saw super duper very powerful bigliest leader in the history of the world walk out of the hospital.  Great optics &amp; ratings bc the show must go on? PS we would rather see your face. The mask makes you look weak and kind of ruined " the exit" part!
1313247266858246145 2020-10-06 06:38:42 +0800 <JUthergi> If his name is said or a camera nearby it is all about him. That is his victory and the media doesn't seem to get it yet.  Living for the day when the trump word is synonymous with the f#!k word.  Y'all got trumped! Go trump yourself! Etc.
1313222903169789952 2020-10-06 05:01:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @baryonic @ThePlumLineGS @DrPhillipsMD @jasonintrator Good that he didn't! Nobody wants to see a fat man with man boobs flipping in the wind like his wig, eeewwwe!
1313218937451147264 2020-10-06 04:46:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be some money to be made for corp donors...
1313154554293256193 2020-10-06 00:30:17 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  Good for you jr! Call up your courage and confront the monster! You could tell us all what you see, become America's hero and our next pres 2024? Jk. Too difficult to spit out that silver spoon?
1313147139426529281 2020-10-06 00:00:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @MSNBC @Rickydeckard49 At first hearing this I ashamedly thought 14 days without being peppered with lies?  What was I thinking? It's 2020 and trump is still here.
1313141736026365952 2020-10-05 23:39:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @Atticus02515588 @navywife53sco @joyouswarrior @CarolPe64837759 @gtconway3d @SecretService Body double in attempt to present a super duper pres?
1313137769787658240 2020-10-05 23:23:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @DayleBrand @realDonaldTrump Wondering if stock market rising is because wall street is betting that trump won't survive his own willful ignorance?
1313135902999404545 2020-10-05 23:16:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe they are all just looking to hide from the voters?  More likely that they just want another paid vacation.
1313134768037548038 2020-10-05 23:11:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Somebody has to be presidenting and playing govermentor ruler while daddy is rethinking campaign to stay out of jail, right?
1313128165171245056 2020-10-05 22:45:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Most compassionate person in the history of the world ?
1313125204479094784 2020-10-05 22:33:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he finally develop a plan for the future or is the drug cocktail causing hallucinations? So hard to tell, even before his hospitalization.
1313121001841086473 2020-10-05 22:16:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Our very stable genius ar work
1313120621287534597 2020-10-05 22:15:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Well worth a listen to better understand each other.
1312824359489351680 2020-10-05 02:38:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like you poor hard working souls need another PAID vacation!
1312823406753198081 2020-10-05 02:34:25 +0800 <JUthergi> since our pres determined virus to be a hoax, what is really going on with pres.?   Certainly can't be that he caught some fake virus, could it?  That guy in the vid saying it was a hoax, could he reassure us that trump is actually in Chinese jungle fighting xi barehanded?
1312820651829473287 2020-10-05 02:23:29 +0800 <JUthergi> @daveregrets Isn't this s.o.p.?
1312817005066674176 2020-10-05 02:08:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Very difficult to trust a man who don't like dogs...
1312816710035136515 2020-10-05 02:07:49 +0800 <JUthergi> How does anyone support two tongued lindsie graham-crackers?
1312814224033357824 2020-10-05 01:57:56 +0800 <JUthergi> 8/19 wife noticing inordinate amount of Asian students @ local internatl univ wearing masks everywhere. 10/19 wi md for flu symptoms &amp; chest x-ray. MD says biggest fear is world pandemic, mentions Crimson Report, usa no longer prepared due to trump dismissal of plan.  In Q 11/19.
1312810724088066048 2020-10-05 01:44:02 +0800 <JUthergi> You'll have to take my gun from my cold dead hands. A quote by nra members everywhere.  You'll have take this king's scepter of rule from my cold dead hands cried trump.  But sir, it's only your sharpies...there there you can rest easy and feel better.
1312808547244269570 2020-10-05 01:35:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking that he's signing letters to food program recipients claiming he is the only one that can feed them?
1312808016601919489 2020-10-05 01:33:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @Crowman1979 @AntarianRani @GeorgeTakei Did trump's daddy sell steaks to the kkk that frequented his houses of ill repute?
1312807160586395649 2020-10-05 01:29:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Campaign contributions, Silly.   Regular folk cannot afford to pay the elected elite...
1312806337676546048 2020-10-05 01:26:36 +0800 <JUthergi> See? No worries!  This guy assured us trump is  like a robust nfl quarterback getting o2.  An almost 400lb  quarterback? Must be trump started his own league after Buffalo Bills turned him away.  Bad move Buffalo, you coulda had the bigliest most incredibly unbelievable mascot!
1312804575506845696 2020-10-05 01:19:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Looking to be corrected with new info please.
1312804317376774144 2020-10-05 01:18:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Last heard that only 50% of people eligible to vote are registered. Of that less than 20% actually vote. 330m pop.  &amp; 127m+/- votes?  It's not that we don't want to vote, it's because we are only offered sychophants of the 2 party system to vote for!
1312799729693208580 2020-10-05 01:00:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @StevenBeschloss @ABrooksdeVita Dah!
1312798773156945922 2020-10-05 00:56:32 +0800 <JUthergi> @marybl62 @13speedOD @matthewjdowd Ca. Late 70s our elected elite, under guidance of the 6 corp media giants controlling 90% of "news", dissolved the fairness doctrine. The doctrine required equal time for opposing viewpoints and opinions were saved for editorials. The day the news died...
1312773807329992704 2020-10-04 23:17:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Are her Chinese Patented/Manufactured Voting Machines in your state?
1312488821603196929 2020-10-04 04:24:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Note Information presented by cdc subject to change if trump feels he is behind in any polls...
1312481871729582081 2020-10-04 03:57:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Translation: they're running out of agents.
1312462980756328449 2020-10-04 02:42:13 +0800 <JUthergi> If they say he's resting comfortably, it's safe to presume he is unconscious &amp; might be on the ventilator.
1312462487808176128 2020-10-04 02:40:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @dvglasgow Not the cancel election line again? Isn't this performance about his abysmal acting at the debate &amp; his fear if failing again? I'm so confused...
1312461022079279107 2020-10-04 02:34:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @LaurieInQueens @AntarianRani @joshtpm @JessicaValenti Better check with melanoma, mel onknees, darned spell check. That woman putin sent over to keep an eye on trump. You know her she did the be best thingy to the WH Rose Gard. for trump campaign.  She just loves Christmas! Heard she might go with blood red decor again?
1312408698539606017 2020-10-03 23:06:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Please remember that this guy's show is more about comedy and entertainment then info of substance.  Claiming trump walked into battlefield of virus, bone spurs and all, is simply satire.   Who could believe he caught the virus for us when his entire life behavior is about him?
1312406416272089088 2020-10-03 22:57:27 +0800 <JUthergi> To see honorable men in action and then see how little respect they get from our elected elite is most disheartening.  Lurie, with the help of survivors, brings the bs of off site leadership to light but the men in field rise pulling victory from defeat. Again!  On netflix
1312399627224834050 2020-10-03 22:30:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Really thought alternate kelly would have done the cauldron double bubble toil &amp; trouble spell by now...
1312397265038962688 2020-10-03 22:21:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @DebbieRhoden57 Any word on wild billy boy's testing???
1312390995116519425 2020-10-03 21:56:10 +0800 <JUthergi> vanky is, always was,  her minion jared helps.
1312384386487201797 2020-10-03 21:29:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @KatiePhang Maybe now he should be sent to visit putin again? Send the prostrate eight to get a new plan...
1312170768524955649 2020-10-03 07:21:04 +0800 <JUthergi> How us it the money needed to help them recover matches the amount that he is in debt to foreign "financiers"?  The grift goes on...
1312165732252151809 2020-10-03 07:01:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Err on the side of caution...  INCOMPETENCE
1312164806938423296 2020-10-03 06:57:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Multi day stay? Like a vacation?  He was admitted to the hospital, why can't you   Admit it?
1312162880377118720 2020-10-03 06:49:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe it was when trump made jared's mistress hopeless hicks steam press his pants.   Apparently he was wearing them.   No social distance there!
1312159600368476160 2020-10-03 06:36:42 +0800 <JUthergi> No changes.   ivanka and her minion jared, as always, are still in charge.
1312153013516070914 2020-10-03 06:10:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @MiaFarrow Incapacitated pres makes vp pres. gop nominee would be vanky, daddy demands it!  Pence is shipped back to life of infamy in IA
1312138946806050817 2020-10-03 05:14:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @MeidasTouch Honor system for trump family? Now that's funny!
1312069035488575489 2020-10-03 00:36:49 +0800 <JUthergi> 2008 again?  Overpriced property values crash and possible defaults by kushner company on fed backed loans?  Why is our gov giving him $ when he can get it for favors from S.A., Qutar &amp; russia?
1312065398725128193 2020-10-03 00:22:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @TheDailyEdge What a fitting epitaph!
1312063849613406208 2020-10-03 00:16:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Considering that pence is now asking to help raise $421m to help trump "recover" from the trump virus, one logically must question the narrative. Is it a coincidence that we just confirmed that trump owes $420m to be paid in &lt;3yrs?
1312059775014797314 2020-10-03 00:00:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Russian handlers, handling putin's most valuable assets do not believe in Christmas.  godless commies!
1312059308788641800 2020-10-02 23:58:10 +0800 <JUthergi> So maybe trump wasn't lying? trump virus is a hoax and just another scam to raise more $ from his depleted campaign?
1312058627554004993 2020-10-02 23:55:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Really! The rest of us have to go to work no matter how poorly we feel. Can't afford to take a sick day!  With greatest tech devices avail to pres, why the hell can't he keep working?  Just a few sniffles and maybe a fever &amp; out of work? WEAK!  trump virus is a hoax, right?
1312055777755123718 2020-10-02 23:44:08 +0800 <JUthergi> After putting their lives at risk they should demand refunds of donations!
1312051419084718081 2020-10-02 23:26:49 +0800 <JUthergi> I think President Wilson believed in the pandemic of his day. Even tried to assure people and allay fears.   your pres does the opposite and that incompetence has killed over 200k countrymen.  So people may not have a lot of empathy for a man who has none for others.  Genius
1312050360278802432 2020-10-02 23:22:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Like the ill will you expressed before he was appointed by the EC? Something like him destroying the party &amp; country? Being a misogynistic, race baiting kook?  Funny how you never seem to remember your own cruelty &amp; disgusting behaviors.  So, what are you doing after elections?
1312020332673458183 2020-10-02 21:23:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @BandyXLee1 TY Dr Lee for your insights. It helps. Do you think that after the briefing to congress that the C19 dx of pres is actually just pulling him from spotlight as had been suggested? Did 25th A proceedings begin? Please keep us informed. You &amp; colleagues are our essential information
1311803075494109184 2020-10-02 06:59:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Hinting? They've been at it for years!
1311799590618836997 2020-10-02 06:46:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @SenJeffMerkley @katheyjberry Potential? Really, ya think so?
1311797322574180355 2020-10-02 06:37:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Breaking News!   Our pres just keeps on winning!  Another world record nobody can EVER beat!  This award by a prestigious university will stand throughout the world's history!!!  Oh, thank you! you're the best?
1311794318819176454 2020-10-02 06:25:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Noo!  Am I hallucinating?  I knew I should have read the liability side effect waivers for those rx happy pills!  Good thing WTP have big pharma instead of street rx! Their crap is legal. Am digressing too?  Is it over? Can't. be. best. Too scared by the mean lady!
1311791850781585415 2020-10-02 06:15:23 +0800 <JUthergi> The saddest thing about pb tough guys is that when the NG Soldiers arrive they'll cut through pb "warriors" like a knife through butter. More death caused by trump and he'll call his loyal pb suckers and losers too...
1311789798856818688 2020-10-02 06:07:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Not enough???
1311786921333608450 2020-10-02 05:55:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently the bible was constructed by emperor Constantine's team. They argued with To and each other.   Canonical Law often seemingly differs from the teachings of Scripture.  That's why there is a Pope with hierarchical rule. The kingdom of heaven lies within...
1311784574041681925 2020-10-02 05:46:28 +0800 <JUthergi> He was looking for support and the much needed "you did good donnie" to restore his bloodied ego and she just spanked him!
1311782133497724928 2020-10-02 05:36:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Great work BC! Info has been there but nobody listened!
1311781431216144402 2020-10-02 05:33:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Ever since kruschev's antics &amp; shoe pounding threats in UN!
1311775857439051778 2020-10-02 05:11:50 +0800 <JUthergi> He can't bully 1600 of you, right?
1311774965574832128 2020-10-02 05:08:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Exchange of ideas. Rules are to allow for discussion of topic's pros &amp; cons, presenting plans to solve problems for the audience.  Rules insure gentlemanly civilized behavior and prevent any embarrassing emotional irrational breakdowns into absolute boorish buffoonery!  Get it?
1311770278104576000 2020-10-02 04:49:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @AnonYmo44465733 Don't think anyone could argue with the absolute corruption of our Republic. In '72 i read 1984 by George Orwell. In '73 i was convinced we were living it's nightmare.  40 yrs of "I need you to do me a favor though, before I contribute $ to your incumbency"...  Most disconcerting
1311767933715197955 2020-10-02 04:40:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Release the mongoose!!!
1311765561450401794 2020-10-02 04:30:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Well at least we know why trump money is invested in new Chinese Patented/Manufactured Voting Machines!  We just don't know where they are sneaking them into...
1311764366438604805 2020-10-02 04:26:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like just thinking you have absolute power, corrupts absolutely!
1311684178614857728 2020-10-01 23:07:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Y'all might want to make them pay for security up front. In cash.
1311679040944844801 2020-10-01 22:47:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @LindseyGrahamSC  Too bad l'il lindsie!
1311674513021644833 2020-10-01 22:29:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Can i enter my stuffed trumpy bear?
1311673746453868546 2020-10-01 22:26:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Gee whiz mr pres. i'm pretty sure no one would call you smart on purpose. Everyone, (except you of course), makes mistakes.
1311671892584128513 2020-10-01 22:18:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps we should just call it another "performance"? He didn't debate anything, did he?
1311669112624439298 2020-10-01 22:07:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Turtles aren't generally known for courage.
1311666436369084416 2020-10-01 21:57:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @StephenKing @DayleBrand Please Mr King, that is quite offensive to all of us having that particular body part!  Of course, I can't argue with such an accurate depiction.
1311664789546921988 2020-10-01 21:50:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like someone's still not paying his bills for the burden his visits place on cities. Maybe he'll trade you some trump steaks, ties or Chinese made campaign crap for security? Who doesn't love our broke billionaire?
1311663820457213952 2020-10-01 21:46:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @SenTedCruz  Poor lyin ted!  Didn't get nomination to SCOTUS so he's having a tantrum and wants to hurt others because the pres hurt him.  Did you really think being on list meant you had a chance?  You spoke badly about trump, he got his revenge.  PS did you play Eddie Munster?
1311445999194435585 2020-10-01 07:21:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Silly me, i thought it was a listening device McEnemy planted so she could keep him focused...must have shorted out when Biden referenced trump being so smart! lol
1311445090020274177 2020-10-01 07:17:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Wouldn't it be great for these clowns to realize they've been fired before Election Day?
1311444309485522946 2020-10-01 07:14:23 +0800 <JUthergi> They protest too much,  WTP notice how bizarre their behavior is...someone else is doing it first!  1st we see daddy &amp; jr drug behavior &amp; daddy wants to test Biden. jr wants to accuse Biden's son.  A trump family pic would be a great poster for all America's sins come to haunt us
1311442440059080707 2020-10-01 07:06:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Sadly, donnie destructo thinks he did great and that everyone agrees with him....
1311441182677962752 2020-10-01 07:01:58 +0800 <JUthergi> We still don't know how many Chinese voting machines are being delivered to red states...  The coffins, kind of hard to deny knowing how bad the trump virus would be when you're looking to profit off dead Americans!
1311440197020782595 2020-10-01 06:58:03 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Olivia Troye!
1311438852817645572 2020-10-01 06:52:42 +0800 <JUthergi> There is no way he has enough hair yo justify those costs!  C'mon, comb over and spray?  Maybe they used the $ for more plastic surgeries for vanky. She wants to be vp!
1311436574874370048 2020-10-01 06:43:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Does anyone think trump will allow a rule change that forces him to act in a civilized manner as a professional gentleman would be expected to act?   He'll cry foul and that everyone is out to get him and walk out, if not refuse to even show up!
1311408404578131970 2020-10-01 04:51:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity  C'mon hamhead, you don't believe that!   Heard you guys were  laughing hysterically the moment he staggered on stage!  If your truly his friend, tell the truth!  Ya know, if they ever reinstate fairness doctrine,dropped in the 70s, you would be out of a job!
1311403172108423173 2020-10-01 04:30:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Look at this! More fake news just because nobody, even a lot of smart nobodies, are just being mean!  You were the loudest, hardly ever stopped talking about stuff you wanted to talk about and they couldn't make you answer one question on how to save us! You win
1311401902165417988 2020-10-01 04:25:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Thought i heard donnie destructor yell, "I know you are, but what am I?  C'mon we all heard him say it, right?
1311401353944719366 2020-10-01 04:23:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe he is just reading the emails his campaign sent out BEFORE the debate?  You know, better than anyone, they claimed trump won.  Likely written up so he wouldn't rage on the team for his abysmal attempt to debate!
1311400201631019009 2020-10-01 04:19:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @kylieatwood @navywife53sco Why give ink to the enemy?
1311399330964738050 2020-10-01 04:15:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey pesky boy! We won't interfere with absolutely every goal you putinite slaves have around the world, really! You couldn't leave well enough alone... We saved your frozen butts once, never again.
1311398460084678660 2020-10-01 04:12:12 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  How is it when lots of very smart people, well educated &amp; concerned about truth say one thing, you ALWAYS say the opposite???  Do you think nobody notices?  Storybook king without his clothes and no one tells him...sad but true.
1311344042953838592 2020-10-01 00:35:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @rolandsmartin @sharnettereese1 @JHoganGidley @realDonaldTrump Was that vanky look alike, McEnemy fired?
1311343436075880455 2020-10-01 00:33:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Wondering why Biden didn't just ask trump: donnie, you seem so upset? Those bone spurs that got your 5 deferments keeping you out of service acting up again? Take a pill don ol boy, toughen up!
1311341706776850433 2020-10-01 00:26:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking: Due to extreme financial difficulties trump has a new djt school for professional debates! Only $50k per class and you too can learn to shout down the monitors, your opponents &amp; the audience! You'll learn how to avoid every single question! Art of distraction &amp; more!
1311324781912952837 2020-09-30 23:19:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Stop to this embarrassing display of the downfall of our civil discourse and the display of ones man personal mental health crisis meltdown live.  There should be no more of this. If you cannot / will not control boorish behavior this ugliness will spread.  CONTROL THE NARRATIVE
1311323295246159872 2020-09-30 23:13:31 +0800 <JUthergi> You gave us nothing but a fox entertainment replay of the very unstable buffoon calling advisor hammity  to blather on about a perceived slight that day.  You gave us a monitor who appeared no more than a hammity wannabe. You have shamed WTP on the world stage by not putting a
1311321541402071046 2020-09-30 23:06:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Still overwhelmed by what was supposed to be a debate.  An exchange of ideas, discussions of plans to lead us out of the horrors we have survived over 4yrs. Debate Monitors Commission you have failed us. There was no debate, you encouraged the death of civility &amp; decorum.
1311315616301801472 2020-09-30 22:43:00 +0800 <JUthergi> George Carlin tried so hard to awaken us. Please review and remember, it's that 1% that bought our gov and our gov only wants us to be their labor.  Almost as if the slavery biz model has been adapted for political correctness, so we don't think we're slaves...  Please rt!
1311308556218634245 2020-09-30 22:14:57 +0800 <JUthergi> But that guy in the oval office said it's the best economy the world has ever seen, is that great?
1311307334795300864 2020-09-30 22:10:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Do you really have to ask?
1311101895067529216 2020-09-30 08:33:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Breaking news!  ghouliani suddenly betrays trump on his big debate night?  Why, oh why? Did you not pay his bill?
1311099784032382977 2020-09-30 08:25:22 +0800 <JUthergi> my job had me meeting many successful RE Developers, not one anywhere, ever had to sell steaks, chicken wings, ties, re schools and so much more in their successes.  This p.t. barnum schtick is proof of donnie's financial failures and desperate attempts to pander for $$$!
1311095635895033856 2020-09-30 08:08:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Like the band Dire Straits' song? "Money for nuthin and chicks for free, I live to work at nothing all day"? Ok, McEnemy we got ya, loud and clear!
1311093022768197632 2020-09-30 07:58:30 +0800 <JUthergi> And the wood nymphs have been hiding his taxes!
1311092002507960321 2020-09-30 07:54:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey mr turtle head! You sure they aren't just referring to your worship of money? Love your video, you look so, dead? You've been sitting behind hundreds of bills on your desk for so long I think you died, someone should tell you so you can go home. Nice funeral pyre waiting...
1311090287029215232 2020-09-30 07:47:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @R1mElvis @DanielleCandela @BillKristol @melvisr1 Read only 2 stories so wasn't sure. Ty!
1311086884614012928 2020-09-30 07:34:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr jr jr jr?  Why is it that EVERY TIME there's some scent of bovine scat about a leak, you're there trying to make everyone look away from you?  Upset daddy wants vanky to be vp? Is she taking away your big chance to be pres 4 life? Did you tell on eric?  Are YOU the leak???
1311084032395010048 2020-09-30 07:22:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @R1mElvis @DanielleCandela @BillKristol @mElvisR1 Good point. German guy with kkk affiliations, i better rethink this...
1311083366532423680 2020-09-30 07:20:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Sarah saves!
1311083083379232768 2020-09-30 07:19:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Open Everything!  What do we have to loose, right???  Our lives? because of an absolute failure to contain the trump viral pandemic?  Oh, never mind...
1311082192559321088 2020-09-30 07:15:28 +0800 <JUthergi> "They buy all sorts of toys from trump, apartments $40-50m they give me" Also, "I have no business with SA, couldn't care less"  Who is this guy?
1311079109141975040 2020-09-30 07:03:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Just lol can't lol take lol it lol anymore roflmao!
1311078830086459392 2020-09-30 07:02:06 +0800 <JUthergi> How is it that ghouliani keeps returning from the shadows? Is he the trump virus's next incarnation?
1311077873390956544 2020-09-30 06:58:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Flynn's own lawyer tells trump not to pardon? Somebody finally listened to FBI tapes???
1311076442990678016 2020-09-30 06:52:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Great strategy!  trump is so broken they'll walk him to stage , do intros, when he's panicking after 1st question, he calls opponent a childish name and walks away, forgetting it's not a wh press briefing.  Email already sent so he claims victory and the fake news begins again...
1311074687099842565 2020-09-30 06:45:38 +0800 <JUthergi> By now people should be able to recognize this aberrant pattern of behavior...what am i saying, for a momentary lapse i forgot about donnie destructo's followers. Never mind.
1311073907777077248 2020-09-30 06:42:32 +0800 <JUthergi> But George!  Maybe you just don't understand how badly we all need a drink just for surviving this long!  Couldn't we break rules to suit ourselves, just during debates?  https://t.co/TIf3Q68yo4
1311072719992217605 2020-09-30 06:37:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, apparently someone's social circle has to keep up the appearance that they don't impregnate children...
1311067491481915397 2020-09-30 06:17:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @DanielleCandela @BillKristol Hope that Biden as a senior of some wisdom looks trump in the eye and in best condescending manner says: Now donnie, is that really what you want people to believe. Shame on you, your father would be so disappointed...
1311060017370595331 2020-09-30 05:47:21 +0800 <JUthergi> But of course! Cheating works!
1311056550560178177 2020-09-30 05:33:34 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Crew! How does a closed operation generate 1m? Any insights as to which battleground electoral states are sporting vanky's brand new Chinese Patented / Manufactured Voting Machines???  Inquiring minds, etc.
1310971495603208193 2020-09-29 23:55:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Not a word to constituents about job performance? Just send me money??? gop 2020
1310961808572919816 2020-09-29 23:17:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @EricTrump  Oh, no! eric, don't testify!   Everyone is saying that vanky convinced your dad let you be the fall guy! She and jr ratted you out!  Time to fight back, tell all! You'll get immunity and be an American Hero!  Tell all and you can grow up to be the POTUS!!!
1310957495322542083 2020-09-29 22:59:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Is she consulting for these businesses too? Retraining herself? Any new plans for making the Chinese Patented Voting Machines here?
1310954061420728320 2020-09-29 22:46:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @thalia25123534 @mjence @mckaycoppins Is it possible there is a war on our Republic, and the rule of law?  PS last week US Troops were sent back into Syrian territory where we're "protecting the oil" as stated by the pres. Isis kept attacking our people and Bradley Armor and the cavalry was sent to rescue. Isis lives
1310951135419797508 2020-09-29 22:34:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Hooray! The turtle head changed his mind!  Oh, sorry was just foolishly hoping at least one of our elected gop elite had at least a modicum of decency, my bad!
1310946960355086337 2020-09-29 22:18:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Did lil lindsie finally get the courage to stand up to his bully? Bless his heart!
1310685736585363456 2020-09-29 05:00:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Lock them up!
1310679593955848194 2020-09-29 04:35:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, you know there's a lot of corners in this maze he's dragged us into with his incompetence.
1310674987074965504 2020-09-29 04:17:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Preparing for a debate by practicing with two men whose character, moral compass, dedication to public service and aversion to truth is the exact opposite of the guy he has to debate?  Great plan!  Man plans &amp; GOD laughs...trump plans and the whole world laughs!
1310670732616232960 2020-09-29 04:00:28 +0800 <JUthergi> I think jr still thinks he is next in line for pres. Poor eric just doesn't know any better.  Been hoping eric tells all so he doesn't get blamed by family.  He could go to Slovenia as a free man if he negotiates for immunity!  Do it eric!
1310669428581978114 2020-09-29 03:55:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Using tarmacs for rallies and refusing to pay cities for security, still? Sounds like trump's be- best people are scamming him as he scams WTP!
1310668579512233985 2020-09-29 03:51:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Silly me, i thought that you had to be a race baiting, misogynistic wife beater kook to work for trump?
1310663456924880896 2020-09-29 03:31:33 +0800 <JUthergi> jr jr jr, you try so hard but appear so woefully incompetent. only candidate for pres compromised by Russia is bigly daddy.  US Security Agencies said your whole family is a sec. risk. you &amp; eric claimed $ pouring from Russia when too risky 4 US banks.  Are u a Slovenian citizen?
1310660932624961539 2020-09-29 03:21:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Sorry but am not too confident anyone will jump in. They've chosen to go with no real time fact checking. How can you debate a subject(s) if one party is unable to stay on topic? Sensing it will be like the "I know you are but what am I?" Challenge.
1310606674844057600 2020-09-28 23:45:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Our elected elite created this system long ago and it was recently codified by SCOTUS decision in "Citizen's United".  trump merely exploits and has become the poster boy for all that is wrong in DC.  Now is the time for WTP to make changes...
1310605386743984129 2020-09-28 23:40:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @NightlyPolitics @AntarianRani Makes one wonder if trump himself also has Slovenian Citizenship?  With m as his Russian handler and control putin has over Slovenia, is this the planned escape route?
1310604045334327296 2020-09-28 23:35:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Note: all guidelines subject to change if president is suffering losses in his sacred polls.
1310602885936410626 2020-09-28 23:30:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Very true! But it will be only an exercise in futility without fact checking...
1310601891022241795 2020-09-28 23:26:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Without fact checking IT IS NOT A DEBATE! we've been subjected to 4 yrs of tangential blathering and bragging about achievements existing in one man's mind. Debate is supposed to educate WTP on candidate's character, ID of the problems we face and offer solutions. Do your job!
1310599567839236098 2020-09-28 23:17:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Unless of course you're born low, with defective genetics...
1310597870081507328 2020-09-28 23:10:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @joanneintexas That's almost $10 per each hair, every day?
1310595537712885760 2020-09-28 23:01:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Squatting. Such an excellent description for the portly person pretending to be pres.
1310595081930526720 2020-09-28 22:59:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Will this include vanky's voting machines, clothing lines, trump ties and maga paraphernalia?  What about those delicious trump steak?
1310591144724705284 2020-09-28 22:44:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Great work!
1310591009118654465 2020-09-28 22:43:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  @JoeBiden  Hi guys Here's a great start to opening debates! Is this kind of practice in wh the reason for 31.7% drop in gdp? Certainly there's an explanation for this creative accounting... Even SDNY is interested.
1310583599670927363 2020-09-28 22:14:14 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  And you want to run on your record? Great idea! Such a genius with a great , um you know and understand better than anyone!
1310580168889700359 2020-09-28 22:00:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @JoeBiden  Sir? This article looks like a very specific plan to insure your victory and our hope for the future of our Republic.  Or,  you could just let him speak if the monitors use real time fact checking...
1310328701125644289 2020-09-28 05:21:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1310327165813219329 2020-09-28 05:15:15 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Say it ain't so, we'll believe anything!
1310323304352317440 2020-09-28 04:59:55 +0800 <JUthergi> They get paid by the hr. to be there. Trump just just kept babbling on...  Not really sure people want to be there...
1310322568881201153 2020-09-28 04:56:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @OMGno2trump @JimCassidy48 Any grand jury will see that delivering anything without trump's approval is a crime! Besides. The perp had Biden campaign literature stuffed in his pants and socks!  LAW &amp; ORDER, or else!
1310321210681683969 2020-09-28 04:51:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @realTuckFrumper Looking at this pic, i'm just rolling the floor laughing so hard my ribs hurt! He wants Biden to take a drug test!!!
1310320235770241024 2020-09-28 04:47:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Hey Mrs K don't forget how hard lil trumpy bear fought, in his own words, communicable diseases. He worked hard to be a wannabe playboy.
1310318723434192898 2020-09-28 04:41:42 +0800 <JUthergi> If trumpy bear demands anything, ever, it is the duty of every citizen to just laugh.  "I demand" , "Everyone follows my orders", sure boss.
1310317550278975489 2020-09-28 04:37:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Great idea sir!   You could beat the pants off him in a test of who can do more drugs!  you got him now!  Party on bro...it's almost over!
1310315386315964418 2020-09-28 04:28:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Great advice, but not so sure it's working.  Been foolishly trying to make fun of the incredibly unbelievable and bigly narcissists that are our elected elite, since i got here.  Thinking im the only one laughing. The Mrs always said that I'm my own best audience...
1309839025948295170 2020-09-26 20:55:34 +0800 <JUthergi> That eric! A bastion of truth in a sea of uncertainty! lol
1309837380430508033 2020-09-26 20:49:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh, now it makes sense.  When she sold stocks off after trump virus secret briefing, I thought it was pure greed. Who knew she just really wants to be a public servant?
1309831541607092226 2020-09-26 20:25:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Sorry, but this seems to sum up trump's oratory skills.  Perhaps this quote will be memorialized on a plaque, then becoming his own epitaph.  This guy is the Rodney Dangerfield character at the club in Caddy Shack ...and our EC's political appointees made him pres!
1309632783032123392 2020-09-26 07:16:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe it's all a scam to find a new legal team? Obviously needs one.  Imagine a wrong, hire attys with taxpayer $, if they win their on team trump.   Lawyers always win. trump gets new kamikaze bombers!  Wasn't that Japanese guy an Emperor? trump's end game?
1309630777680945158 2020-09-26 07:08:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently big pharma caved after balking at $100 cards.  Maybe that's why they're fighting for liability protection in eu, in case of unforseen consequences from side effects of vaccines?  Oh no! Maybe trump caved and released them from consequence of side effects on WTP???
1309627694263480320 2020-09-26 06:55:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Kind of sounding like jr?
1309626086368702465 2020-09-26 06:49:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Wild billy barr claims mail in votes undermine people's confidence in fair elections.  (duh, he's been trying since appointed)  Wow, the more they cry foul the more confident I am that OUR REPUBLIC can take a few hits by these wanna be 'dear leaders'!
1309623472251981826 2020-09-26 06:39:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Note: all info below subject to change if it looks like our boss is losing in fox news polls.
1309622204162813952 2020-09-26 06:33:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr You awake now jr? Man those crashes, eh???  Hey, remember all that dictator stuff your dad said about news?  All fake. Enemies of the people, etc.?  Turns out he is right! News is the enemy of the people, just look how your elected elite is freaking out!  You're believable, lol
1309589712416444416 2020-09-26 04:24:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Was carson there by chance, or was trump finally speaking to an african american group?
1309586057671987206 2020-09-26 04:10:21 +0800 <JUthergi> trump sure does hire the best people!
1309583985643847686 2020-09-26 04:02:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Are we all gonna die?  Please sir, by now you must have a plan to make your virus magically disappear, right?
1309580537309401095 2020-09-26 03:48:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Did we miss the tour de trump this year?
1309579276598026242 2020-09-26 03:43:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  with all your fear of mail in ballots, you need to understand something.  You lost the people's vote. You got impeached with a list a mile long of your "inappropriate acts" and "criminal allegations".  If WTP want to mail votes, we will!   it is what it is!
1309575982798573568 2020-09-26 03:30:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @EugJHawk @realDonaldTrump Well, thanks.
1309575681072918537 2020-09-26 03:29:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Does anyone remember when the news consisted of one person reading about factual events, then wishing us goodnight?  All I see or hear now is entertainers asking each other what they think about someone else's thoughts. No wonder donnie the destructor destroyed their credibility!
1309572655629172739 2020-09-26 03:17:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, he is planning for new reno at his mal lago resort. As somebody has got to pay, why not seniors they're almost dead anyway, right?  PLEASE VOTE to end this madness !
1309570564940537861 2020-09-26 03:08:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Isn't mitch a great leader?
1309570328096641026 2020-09-26 03:07:51 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  What is the plan to eradicate this scuurge, mr pres leader of the world, sir?  Are we all gonna die, we know you did an incredibly unbelievable job fighting this virus, but really?  Are we all gonna die?  You can IM me, I won't tell anyone, really.
1309568810266046464 2020-09-26 03:01:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! From ricochet rabbit to bulwinkle moose jr is in trouble.
1309549550701604864 2020-09-26 01:45:17 +0800 <JUthergi> It's all just so surreal. Everything they accuse others of is exactly that which they're doing themselves.  Another tell by the wannabe dictator is quote:"nobody disobeys my orders".   This is not my beautiful house, how did I get here?   Letting the days go by...
1309548320768045058 2020-09-26 01:40:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Beautiful sun dog in the northeast today!  Anyone know what the white dot @ 1100 is?  Saw it last night behind the moon too, but amber color.  TY for insights!  (Kid next door says it's SuperMan coming to save us from the president.) Really don't wanna disappoint, lol.  https://t.co/vqc9dKZf3y
1309546132268343298 2020-09-26 01:31:42 +0800 <JUthergi> But isn't that SOP for grads of wannabe dictators 101?  After destroying credibility of any possible opposition, of course!
1309544119459606528 2020-09-26 01:23:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @Mitumba10 @DonaldJTrumpJr like myopic blindness?
1309543759793790976 2020-09-26 01:22:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Do not resign!   You sound like the elected elite that got us here!  You sword and oath to protect the US Constitution, not some wannabe dictatorial lunatic!
1309540900704485379 2020-09-26 01:10:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trumpy's eo claiming to protect pt with pre EC is all about protecting CORPORATE LIABILITY.  Kill ACA in SCOTUS and  surprise, no pre EC!  No corp liability if us stupid careless workers choose to catch trump virus on our own...  We're on our own now!
1309536034842128384 2020-09-26 00:51:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Well then.   If wild billy barr says he never heard any crap about HIS MINION trump seizing power, we must be imagining things?  Don't look at how barr has already tested "unlawful assembly" and "insurrection" responses with US Troops v WTP!  Didn't barr work on Patriot Act?
1309513915307634694 2020-09-25 23:23:41 +0800 <JUthergi> How could he siphon tax dollars to his pet projects if he paid WTP a few more pennies to survive?
1309511214851125251 2020-09-25 23:12:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Great idea Mr Walsh!  Wondering if maybe we should go to next step, mailing actual pennies to our elected elite?  To show how much we truly value them...they won't know how to get rid of them all!  Pennies 4 politicians! Because WTP aren't worth much to them...
1309509805309071361 2020-09-25 23:07:21 +0800 <JUthergi> How about, WTP only accept Election Results if trump loses?!  (Unless of course we still have Allies in this world that can force UN to act &amp; MONITOR US ELECTION!)
1309507939141652486 2020-09-25 22:59:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Mail in ballot rec'd!  Because of lies being spread by trump the terrible we're getting a caravan of neighbors &amp; fam together &amp; driving to BOE on Monday!  BOE says ty because they want to count mail in ballots asap BEFORE Election Day!  (Not one trump vote from over 43 of us)  https://t.co/qP55GEEqiM
1309502687550017536 2020-09-25 22:39:04 +0800 <JUthergi> @NBCNews LOCK HIM UP!!!
1309502145633366016 2020-09-25 22:36:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Be honest now, what could be sweeter than this chant for our cheater?
1309501267086106631 2020-09-25 22:33:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Recent reports from Syria says we are SENDING TROOPS back in, with Bradley Armor to protect our Soldiers! They're being menaced by russia, Syrian and Isis soldiers because we are protecting someone's oil ... Does anybody else care? Obviously our gov doesn't!
1309469147215077377 2020-09-25 20:25:48 +0800 <JUthergi> We failed our national IQ test and did what trump wanted.  Anyone think that listening to doctors a good idea yet?
1309468185037598724 2020-09-25 20:21:58 +0800 <JUthergi> How else would he get campaign "donations"?  Just waiting for the rest of the story where each tax cut is designed specifically to benefit our lumpy trumpy's businesses.
1309466208752861184 2020-09-25 20:14:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Now he wants to kill babies? His words, is there really any context for what he spews forth? Maybe he's afraid they might send mailed ballots to defeat him ?
1309274665987309570 2020-09-25 07:33:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Ferrer wasn't it 20k lies by end of 2017?   I'm so confused, it seems like he has lied 10x that amount!  Almost as if one human dies everytime he lies and now over 200k souls are lost to the trump virus and incompetence. TY
1309267892580610049 2020-09-25 07:06:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Can you hear the voices of those whose votes you're trying to mess with yet?                OR  Could those actually be the voices of those souls that you killed with YOUR VIRUS??  Please, vote this terrible being out of the land of the living!  ( Did RBG lol?)
1309262607912763395 2020-09-25 06:45:05 +0800 <JUthergi> If we had any true allies left why wouldn't they try to help WTP by calling for UN Monitors?  trump shows us every dayay that we are just like any other dictatorship trying to silence the voice of the people!
1309261750731145223 2020-09-25 06:41:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @MollyJongFast @harrisonjaime Why do you think people hate your guts mr graham cracker? Are you just looking for pity like trump does, poor lindsie! Oh wait! Do you think it has anything to do with your record of bowing to trump's every wish?  Maybe it's bc people are sooo tired of your lies? Or greed?   Bye!
1309260173366697987 2020-09-25 06:35:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Ooooh! That animosity in her voice makes one think trump wanted her to pose in Playboy, but she was rejected?  Saying trump will accept free &amp; fair election results is pretty twisted since trumpy bear has already declared elections rigged &amp; fraudulent! Stabley
1309258112818438145 2020-09-25 06:27:13 +0800 <JUthergi> This guy is starting to remind me of a character in Animal House Movie. Remember Flounder?
1309255269382225920 2020-09-25 06:15:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh, oh, do one that says trump orders white house to be white! It is, so we can believe him, right???  (Why the theatrics when his team are fighting pre existing conditions/ACA legality in SCOTUS?)
1309252291749445633 2020-09-25 06:04:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Commendable for speaking out, but won't lindsie prevent any action? We've known about his giving aid &amp;comfort to our enemies yet there are no formal charges and no one brave enough to draft a simple 25th A letter.  Just another teaser to keep us distracted?
1309250637138399232 2020-09-25 05:57:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Lol! You guys are trying to be sustainable Still buying water rights that compromise water needed for our citizens? Does your reverse osmosis process really use sewage water for drinks? By the way, had a 10yr old rusted bolt your cola freed in minutes!  Nice try?
1309247200304734210 2020-09-25 05:43:51 +0800 <JUthergi> lindsie said that the next pres, oh what?  lindsie graham cracker?  Never mind...  See video to better understand.
1309245671459950596 2020-09-25 05:37:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @on_pipe @katheyjberry Good news! Sort of, considering his portly proportions he could clog the drain and we'll never drain the swamp!
1309243870597783552 2020-09-25 05:30:37 +0800 <JUthergi> @AmyAThatcher @sharnettereese1 Who is this prima donna? One of the trump men's girlfriend?
1309200262230409217 2020-09-25 02:37:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Finally!  Guess daddy's lawyer couldn't bribe, my bad, contribute enough to the da campaign fund?  Poor eric, left holding the bag for daddy's vanky's &amp; jr's dirty deeds!  Don't let em use you eric! Tell it all!   Trade for immunity and you could  be our hero &amp; next POTUS!
1309196803762458625 2020-09-25 02:23:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Surprise! WTP may be treated like nobodies, so it is what it is when nobody votes for you donnie destructor!  Oh, your high-ness you are so bigly large and incredibly unbelievable as you play trump the terrible, but NOBODY really wants to see you win, except maybe P.T. Barnum?
1309134039266230274 2020-09-24 22:14:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Does this # match trump's # of appointments?   It would help make sense that the only fraud is committed by trump &amp; team sychophant.
1309133097611468803 2020-09-24 22:10:27 +0800 <JUthergi> I pray the freedom loving peoples of the world are patient with us, WTP don't want to be the world's enemy because we elected the world's greatest con artist!
1309130994025455618 2020-09-24 22:02:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Good work, keep it up!  It is refreshing to see summary lists of trump the terrible, (terribly unethical), and his activities.  It makes jr's blathering about the H. Biden that much more comically entertaining!
1309128141756137473 2020-09-24 21:50:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow jr! It's almost as big a deal as your family's interest in elite teen modelling agency or teen beauty pagents or miss america for Russia or daddy's best friend  jeffie epstein or auntie g maxwell or vanky's failed modelling career and creepy relations with daddy or or or or
1309123781194125312 2020-09-24 21:33:26 +0800 <JUthergi> No comments, still, from our elected elite???
1309123423440953344 2020-09-24 21:32:01 +0800 <JUthergi> They won't. They should but they're just too happy to make $ and keep focused on their own agendas.  The 4th Estate has been oversold by real estate bankruptcy pros!
1309122387435192320 2020-09-24 21:27:54 +0800 <JUthergi> i'm so confused...  How is it hundreds &amp; hundreds of Generals, former Asst Attorneys General, Psychiatric Pros, lawyers MDs, Gov Service Pros, past Presidents etc can all write or speak of the dangers of trump the terrible, and our elected elite is pretty much silent???  Why?
1309108820308889600 2020-09-24 20:33:59 +0800 <JUthergi> They say history is destined to repeat itself when people fail to remember...here we go again!
1309107604170387471 2020-09-24 20:29:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @BREntzminger @MollyJongFast @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @DNCWarRoom @DNC @HouseJudiciary Or vanky's Chinese Patented/Manufactured Voting Machines count votes only for daddy???
1309106892598378507 2020-09-24 20:26:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news! America's pastime turns political and gives us all a new campaign theme song! Next batter!
1309105473266814993 2020-09-24 20:20:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps trusting trump is not such a great idea after all?
1309102465086877696 2020-09-24 20:08:44 +0800 <JUthergi> While considering your pain i can never feel the depths of your suffering. Please know you are not alone. There are over 400 million Indigenous American survivors of history's worst genocide... Perhaps you could relate and gain strength from their perseverance?
1308821335574040577 2020-09-24 01:31:37 +0800 <JUthergi> How many $b will ins execs make if everyone who even tests for is ex with trump virus is labeled with pre existing conditions? How much more to their pockets when trump SC kills ACA?  Asking for mitch mcconnell...he won't stop smirking!
1308820088951365638 2020-09-24 01:26:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like 11 nursing home deaths/hr is acceptable for sen Maj bc not many dead seniors vote. Only 200k+ dead voters losses are acceptable too so that's why there is still no plan to stop pandemic? In 9 mos 1 life enters the world, in 9 mos the pres and senate have killed 200k!
1308817691315253248 2020-09-24 01:17:08 +0800 <JUthergi> And it's another swing and a miss by this trump team. Seems like they just can't focus in the game... Next batter!
1308816384529444864 2020-09-24 01:11:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Please Cy Vance, explain in your best legalese how a $25k campaign contribution by trump's personal lawyer is not bribery for you to have over ruled regarding ada in your office on trump kids? Then explain how you got $50k after dropping trump case and how you will now return it?
1308758204604612609 2020-09-23 21:20:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems our prostrate eight are failures on two continents.
1308388174012592131 2020-09-22 20:50:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps he is just lying again?
1308189145249001478 2020-09-22 07:39:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Trumpy judge?
1308188849689047046 2020-09-22 07:38:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Please someone tell me when giving aid and comfort to our enemies became no longer treasonous. Not if this guy overuses the term incorrectly it's no longer the most heinous act ever?
1308187103495323648 2020-09-22 07:31:25 +0800 <JUthergi> Good heavens! Please don't let the world see this!
1308186721889267714 2020-09-22 07:29:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Great news! Be even better if we could count on somebody to enforce it!  It's 2020 we don't need no stinkin laws!  (Jk)
1308186008190701581 2020-09-22 07:27:03 +0800 <JUthergi> It gets worse... Ol mitch apparently got his sen/daddy to get him out of military service too, after apparently caught in act unbecoming of a soldier.   If only they would, look they might find damning info that'll bring this boy to his knees. Again!   https://t.co/NhPCkeX3ne ty
1308184058325807107 2020-09-22 07:19:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @TeamPelosi @sprbrighting So y'all gonna do nuthin about the fascist takeover and just hope that Biden wins? What is wrong with you people! This is not about WTP saving country! You people need to back up the laws of OUR REPUBLIC if you truly want it to survive! Sounds like y'all about to retire on our $!
1308183051403505673 2020-09-22 07:15:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  jr jr, you can hardly get people to buy your book without gop campaign funds to help sales. Why torture whoever this poor guy with a bad trump wanna be haircut might be?  So did that goofy lady that screams to an empty room leave you yet?
1308181815782453248 2020-09-22 07:10:24 +0800 <JUthergi> That's our prump, as he recently referred to himself at rally!
1308180630157627392 2020-09-22 07:05:41 +0800 <JUthergi> The power of the Patriot Act as interpreted by lil billy barr. Is he related to Roseanne? She must have quit law school when he got in.
1308174875971006472 2020-09-22 06:42:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @amvetsupport @grandfla12703 @Hnhb22554210 Don't forget personal costs to avoid the trump virus. Save receipts, if the elected elite can write off expenses so should we.
1308147378160054281 2020-09-22 04:53:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Good work dailykos! One if the reasons the nys leg was the most corrupt in country for decades was bc if people like her, follow don't lead and stay the hell out of the leaders way...
1308145589188788225 2020-09-22 04:46:27 +0800 <JUthergi> Best indicators of drinking trump brand kool aid? They claim it's incredible! It's unbelievable!  Anyone not know what these words mean?
1308143858144903168 2020-09-22 04:39:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Not sure they just don't run away? Dem getting tough? Lol
1308142799804604417 2020-09-22 04:35:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not, he knows all?
1308139601370976256 2020-09-22 04:22:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe jr's dealer got trumped? jr didn't pay so kg won't be around to play...
1308139094241927171 2020-09-22 04:20:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it clear yet why trump keeps bellowing about 2A rights?  Past patterns 4 previews of future acts. When accuses others of coming for our guns, it means he's already working on it wi barr!  Anarchist cities? No coincidences here...
1308137858566414336 2020-09-22 04:15:44 +0800 <JUthergi> Great find! But aren't the Aussies just following the American Model for voting?  Like they say, if voting actually worked, they wouldn't let us vote!  Love lots of your insights, not all, but you are on a path I've only been able to dream of!  Let's get rid of trump, #1 priority
1308135988980482054 2020-09-22 04:08:18 +0800 <JUthergi> @HonorDecency It's all tied to the trump virus.   Corps want to be held harmless from liability if employees catch virus /hospital $/deaths.  It's why mitchie won't allow Cares Act to pass without liability protection for his donors.  It's up to us, we've been betrayed like never before!
1308134151170732033 2020-09-22 04:01:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Where did all the money for Kentucky go? Just like his service records, mitch makes everything but the trump virus disappear, it's a miracle!
1308133374956122113 2020-09-22 03:57:55 +0800 <JUthergi> While always threatening to go bankrupt leaving lenders holding over valued properties. S.O.P. for trumpy
1308116708683546625 2020-09-22 02:51:41 +0800 <JUthergi> @frank_brown38 @sprbrighting @grantstern @kurtbardella just how many citizens feel that they are truly represented by the elected elite? Anyone?
1308116220923830273 2020-09-22 02:49:45 +0800 <JUthergi> As they have been, since barr's appt! Keep trying to tell people with their heads in the sand is exhausting, eh?
1308115569233874944 2020-09-22 02:47:09 +0800 <JUthergi> His demeanor at final hearing said it all...
1308115200294486019 2020-09-22 02:45:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Notice how they claim different acting vaccines to get to "our most vunerable first"? Test on the poor, elderly and disabled first, sound familiar?  WTP should demand every one of elected elite and SCOTUS should have to get vacc live on tv! We take care and watch for 1 yr.
1308113867638214660 2020-09-22 02:40:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Remembering to never forget historical atrocities? We couldn't have that here just because trump invites religion into gov and creates patriotic education program, could we?  Ty for tweet, so many similarities wi hitler, goebbels, mengele etc.
1308112554376470529 2020-09-22 02:35:11 +0800 <JUthergi> mitchi is holding up the may bill to help WTP fight the trump virus. He knows corp liability falls back to sen who failed in containing this virus. We'll have over 500k new pre existing C19 conditions in months. How many more c19 to new borns with "good genes"?  SCOTUS, keep ACA!
1308107907230298118 2020-09-22 02:16:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Instead of his saving the world from conspiracy supporters should we consider that he might be saving them from WTP? Is he a card carrying member of Q? He's had an awful lot of relationships with those type of deviants...epstein. maxwell, elite models guy, the Brit in hiding
1308105752679190528 2020-09-22 02:08:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Always thought he was short, but he wears his ties sooo looonnnggg that he looks like a very powerful giant. Knowing he is truly a little person I can fully believe his weight claims...
1308104614382891014 2020-09-22 02:03:38 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Dr Brown! Here is the best RX!
1308104277194403841 2020-09-22 02:02:17 +0800 <JUthergi> They've already rolled over and are playing dead. It's time for good swift kicks to their collective backsides!
1308085073313492998 2020-09-22 00:45:59 +0800 <JUthergi> How much do I have to donate if I were to consider reading this? Do I have to kiss snakes or marry my daughter?
1308082203713253377 2020-09-22 00:34:35 +0800 <JUthergi> @ManibotRoman @ProudSocialist idea of a 3rd party has merit due to the last several decades of corruption on 2 sides. But in this natl emergency, we need to put out the fire that is trump. 1st &amp; foremost. Biden will give a breather but focus in repair work. Gives WTP 4 yrs to prep for a complete reno of gov!
1308059133585903618 2020-09-21 23:02:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Oh, man!  Now he tells us? This should be a sign hung above the entrance to every voting center until the end of time!!!  Wonder if trump will make Plato mandatory reading in his "patriotic" school program? lol
1308057988553412609 2020-09-21 22:58:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Wherever there is darkness the ghouliani lurks!
1308057116066885633 2020-09-21 22:54:53 +0800 <JUthergi> More breaking news! Look at all those brave gop men of honor, integrity and good character stand up to the pres. on plan to fill SCOTUS!! Like their maj leader they firmly believe that no new appointment should occur until after election! Be strong! Let nothing change your mind!
1308053621905526786 2020-09-21 22:41:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Well then, this certainly explains a lot?
1308051695130247168 2020-09-21 22:33:21 +0800 <JUthergi> He will go lower &amp; lower &amp; lower &amp; lower etc. Until we all have to look up to tie our own shoes, sigh...
1308049940183224324 2020-09-21 22:26:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @seanhannity  Hey hamm man! What a great idea!   Think of your ratings to have a 2x impeached pres. on your entertainment show!   Advertisers salivating already!  Your promotion of this great idea means it's a MAGA idea!
1308046235715207168 2020-09-21 22:11:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Breaking news! sen mcconnell takes bold &amp; courageous stand for WTP! He must be a man of incredible integrity to stand up to the pres like this demanding WTP have a say in choice of new SCOTUS Judge, right? (Sounds like he wants a new pres too!!!)
1308043036878876676 2020-09-21 21:58:56 +0800 <JUthergi> What is this? Is this photo shop? Isn't this some kind of pornography? Heavens help us!
1308042340314079232 2020-09-21 21:56:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @jessie4324 @realDonaldTrump You betcha he did!  Two weeks to the day after promised for third time to release the most unbelievable and incredible HP ever! Unfortunately, when he says things are incredible or unbelievable, he ain't lying! ( Actually, i think he's waiting for SCOTUS ruling on ACA death)
1308039221488291841 2020-09-21 21:43:47 +0800 <JUthergi> So fear &amp; cowardice once again prevents doing the right thing?  How do these people think WTP would react if pres shut down investigation to protect his offspring?  WTP do not consent!
1308037483431694337 2020-09-21 21:36:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Dearest countrymen, i understand supporting our pres, but please, please listen &amp;  reconsider voting for a man that believes he deserves an A to A+ grade for the death of over 200k Americans, &amp; can't fix problem. Doesn't matter how it got here or who sent it. WTP must fix this!
1308031629554839554 2020-09-21 21:13:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Everyone talks about "owning" this or that.  What WTP fail to notice is that WE ARE OWNED by the corruption that has taken over govt  Ex. below, they have the power to change for our better quality of life but they choose to reward themselves &amp; donors.  Our fault! We let it be.
1307821869408624641 2020-09-21 07:20:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Reference to Military Service? Informative article needs to be brought mainstream to finally silence him.
1307820944833105925 2020-09-21 07:16:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Garland? Is it possible, in light of China's recent squadrons of fighter jets/bombers crossing taiwan's border in a practice run to our base in Guam, along with the shipping lane menacing of our Navy, they are not panicked, but well planned?
1307818550606823432 2020-09-21 07:06:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Every time you tweet this it sounds like YOU are threatening to take our guns!
1307813700779339777 2020-09-21 06:47:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @courageousgirl2 @Frankie12559230 @ProjectLincoln Somebody needs to look into mitchie's service records. If the details are published it could bring him to his knees! Again!  Why does he not want to release his stellar 3 month service reports???
1307812936300331008 2020-09-21 06:44:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @norcalresists @TheJavaJunkie1 TY Norcalresists!  Any chance you could keep this going daily?  It is our Civic Duty voters, to express our discontent to the elected elite.  Tell them: WE DO NOT CONSENT!
1307811115225808908 2020-09-21 06:37:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Debate Monitors? ARE YOU LISTENING?
1307809539845222401 2020-09-21 06:31:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @jilevin Seems like someone slipped some testosterone into both tapper and todd's coffee this am?
1307807489451270145 2020-09-21 06:22:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, isn't that what madmen of power do all the time?
1307805632775495680 2020-09-21 06:15:35 +0800 <JUthergi> One of  jos mengele's students trying some gene therapy for our dear leader? Twins study next? From what depths of darkness do these trump people come from?
1307804155394875393 2020-09-21 06:09:43 +0800 <JUthergi> The oldest surviving Democracy in the world chooses it's leaders through the timeless wisdom of women.  The Haudenosaunee People of NYS have even given us the foundation for OUR REPUBLIC! If we could only listen though the cacophony of politicians...
1307802295829245952 2020-09-21 06:02:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Please let us all vote early.
1307796958858432514 2020-09-21 05:41:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Can't do anything to jeopardize that election..
1307795073204203524 2020-09-21 05:33:37 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Kentuckians!  Please be there every day to show him the faces of suffering in 45th ranked state while he and laine suck up corporate dollars like a hoover vacuum! He could have done so much these past 40yrs for your incredible state! Once again you can save this country!
1307793460326477826 2020-09-21 05:27:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Looks like Alabama was hit pretty hard by Sally. I was counting on you and your sharpies on a map to show the way to safety...
1307791519491985408 2020-09-21 05:19:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @WitchCherokee Me too, me too!
1307788877948743681 2020-09-21 05:09:00 +0800 <JUthergi> Spidey senses tingling again! The more trump accuses others of destroying our 2A Rights, the more I believe he's got barr working on taking our guns. The path to dictator in OUR WH is more clear each day!
1307786536214310914 2020-09-21 04:59:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Great! While we're all praying for miracles to stop the step x step dismantling of OUR REPUBLIC, the elected elite have been largely silent. But hey! More talk to make us think they are fighting for our protection! Boy, am I ever hopeful now!?!?
1307784865270685696 2020-09-21 04:53:04 +0800 <JUthergi> Well worth consideration, wasn't he a constitutional lawyer b4 politicking?
1307744930400530434 2020-09-21 02:14:22 +0800 <JUthergi> The grasp for the obvious is a skill yet to be developed by trump's and their supporters...
1307744260905676801 2020-09-21 02:11:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @HKrassenstein @Advancedape2E @DonaldJTrumpJr How do we arrange an all expenses paid hunting trip for eric jr jared and daddy to go on safari with that Dick cheney guy?
1307743851159973891 2020-09-21 02:10:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @_ReaalAmerican_ @Advancedape2E @DonaldJTrumpJr Every accusation he's made had me thinking oh no, heaven help us!   he got away with doing it himself already!
1307742241197371392 2020-09-21 02:03:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Woulda coulda shoulda had a miracle to save us all?
1307740584312999936 2020-09-21 01:57:06 +0800 <JUthergi> This is how big banks got big, as soon as they were invented, right?
1307738764576468992 2020-09-21 01:49:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Please Mr Joel! Update your song for a 2020 special, it could be our new battle hymn for the Republic!
1307736908538277891 2020-09-21 01:42:30 +0800 <JUthergi> The more discord this guy causes, the closer to the abyss we get, the more he retreats to his Pvt sanctuary...  Today he will hit his ball into a tree, it will bounce back striking him in the forehead and back into humanity...  ok, so i'm the foolish and hopeful optimist.
1307732087483650048 2020-09-21 01:23:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Hear the, hear ye!  The most principled leaders of the gop take an irreversible position to insure WTP are part of the process to choose our next SCOTUS Judge!  Lend your support to the principles these great men of integrity have established to strengthen our Republic!!!  (lol)
1307729529927094272 2020-09-21 01:13:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Great, another trump lie we all want so badly to believe!
1307713761122422787 2020-09-21 00:10:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @KremlinAnnex @MarjukkaKaminen It's as if our bunker boy pres is terrified that WTP rreeaaaly don't want him in OUR HOUSE?
1307709806728314885 2020-09-20 23:54:48 +0800 <JUthergi> The resistance to the dems taking any action at all is disturbingly incomprehensible.
1307708798996557826 2020-09-20 23:50:48 +0800 <JUthergi> The moment barr was appointed he has begun setting precedent for the takeover...
1307696905196130304 2020-09-20 23:03:32 +0800 <JUthergi> How much fun would it be to see this gif on every tweet by our elected elite?  Ty Dayle Winston!
1307693078732513282 2020-09-20 22:48:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Peace without compromise?   Sounds a bit dictatorial considering that OUR REPUBLIC was founded upon compromise.  Our whole social construct is that of compromise.  Any peace treaties actually signed or is all the hooplah over an agreement to talk for election optics???
1307329713061363713 2020-09-19 22:44:27 +0800 <JUthergi> In our IC there are no coincidences.  Perhaps just more evidence of the biggest crime wave in history?
1307328649973174272 2020-09-19 22:40:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @longwall26 @BirdDinners Ghouls ? Oh no!  Does that mean rudy ghouliani will be back?
1307327225113477121 2020-09-19 22:34:34 +0800 <JUthergi> The timing of this is telling, must be getting close to auntie g's, (maxwell), trial.  Someone got a guilty conscience?  Now for something completely different  Seeing pics of vanky's youth v today's look, I was wondering if she's had plastic surgery? LOADS of plastic surgery?
1307322899209105417 2020-09-19 22:17:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Silence here, is the barrtrump hypocrisy on full display!  Love the pic of the full grown man proud of his love for proud (little) boy group with big guns!
1307320600986292230 2020-09-19 22:08:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Our power is in our UNITY AGAINST TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT, but only if we PROJECT POWER PEACEFULLY! We must not allow the govt to incite rioting &amp; violence, that is their stated goal...
1307313398175207424 2020-09-19 21:39:37 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Mr Corn &amp; Mother Jones for uncovering the real donald trump!  EVERYONE, especially trump supporters, that can vote must take the time to see what trump tried so hard to hide!
1307302956367319041 2020-09-19 20:58:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Words if wisdom from lil lindsie? Will wonders never cease?
1307301910697988098 2020-09-19 20:53:58 +0800 <JUthergi> It is not hard to believe...
1307297162687021056 2020-09-19 20:35:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @CChang1124 @JoshuaPotash Preferably where they dump the horse manure so he'll always be reminded of his time in DC?
1307296606493052928 2020-09-19 20:32:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Any chance you could compare your service to mitchie's. Really hoping, for the sake of our Republic you defeat him!
1307294772827226112 2020-09-19 20:25:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Birds of a feather flock together?
1307291305316319233 2020-09-19 20:11:50 +0800 <JUthergi> "most fervent wish"? What did Judge RBG know that we don't? God rest her soul
1307094524280344578 2020-09-19 07:09:53 +0800 <JUthergi> Who is this madman?
1307091741649104896 2020-09-19 06:58:50 +0800 <JUthergi> 1300 Kentuckians MIA? you've been in office for 40 yrs and now you mention it???  Oh. you're campaigning.  Pandering to POW/MIA families suffering for decades won't help!  What is wrong with you, especially after your stellar military service, apparently spent on your knees!
1307090041416626176 2020-09-19 06:52:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Just think of how much trump could've accomplished with just a little integrity and humility...instead he has killed almost half of those lost in the Civil War.
1307085743576285185 2020-09-19 06:35:00 +0800 <JUthergi> trump can and will get bigly uglier!
1307082975004291072 2020-09-19 06:24:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Even a Snickers Bar won't help...
1307067941893156864 2020-09-19 05:24:16 +0800 <JUthergi> It's often said that behind every successful man there is a good woman... Here is the exception to good.
1307066083900297216 2020-09-19 05:16:53 +0800 <JUthergi> How do you bankrupt a cash cow?
1307065704689160192 2020-09-19 05:15:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by step!
1307065247237378050 2020-09-19 05:13:33 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  If as you say, "paint is a defensive mechanism", maybe you could paint yourself in camo colors to hide from all those mean people picking on you? i'll bet you could a lot better than your makeup people...
1307056845698347008 2020-09-19 04:40:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  "problem is that nobody wants to hurt anyone anymore", that sir is called living in civilized society. Those who like to see other's pain and people hurting people are psychologically damaged, as you continue to prove to us all!
1307055467802300417 2020-09-19 04:34:42 +0800 <JUthergi> What next?
1307054228515553280 2020-09-19 04:29:46 +0800 <JUthergi> It could all very easily be changed, but money has so corrupted our elected elite they have no incentive to play fair. If voting worked they would likely not let us do that?
1306981228067856388 2020-09-18 23:39:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, at least we have one fed judge that saved USPS.  New order issued to disregard deboy's work and reinstate all changes he made.   Replace mail sorter, boxes, delivery standards before trumpy's boy tried to destroy it all to win election. Hope springs eternal!
1306979358222028801 2020-09-18 23:32:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Since that money is NOT your money why not use it to protect WTP? Even you know we are NOT better off since you barged your way into our lives!
1306978400540725248 2020-09-18 23:28:27 +0800 <JUthergi> trump can't fix anything, he is the one breaking it all up...
1306976192118091776 2020-09-18 23:19:41 +0800 <JUthergi> "I didn't lie" is even a lie!
1306970000834658304 2020-09-18 22:55:05 +0800 <JUthergi> So, your upset that no one gave you credit for almost 200k unnecessary deaths?  hamhead strikes again!
1306969093375840256 2020-09-18 22:51:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't do it! Remember the gifts from US gov in the past? Have some blankets to keep warm, never mind the small pox infection.
1306968366322790401 2020-09-18 22:48:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Quid pro quo with trump?
1306966757937221645 2020-09-18 22:42:12 +0800 <JUthergi> While this idea has merit, it overlooks the basic premise of politicians. Keep the people broke and we can keep them divided while we take care of ourselves and our incumbencies...
1306962714632351746 2020-09-18 22:26:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @petro21805 @bokoo143 Watching only if they provide real time fact checking and monitors to stop tangential blathering... One candidate will present plans. One will create more chaos. Nothing new...
1306961708108460034 2020-09-18 22:22:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Easy to understand voting machine scam to cheat bc that's trump, but their plan to invite rioting violence then call us insurrectionists so army can shoot us seemed too far fetched.  Until now. Terrifying evil princess seeks to profit by death. Who invests in coffins w/o plan?
1306958158288556032 2020-09-18 22:08:01 +0800 <JUthergi> But he claims he's done more for farmers etc etc etc
1306957631601479681 2020-09-18 22:05:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it gone yet?
1306955989917347842 2020-09-18 21:59:24 +0800 <JUthergi> He's like Winnie the Pooh, or his promo trumpy bear with his paw in the honey jar...doesn't care as long as he gets the honey. His whole show is like a Mad Magazine cartoon.
1306745042866974721 2020-09-18 08:01:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe she should go hunting with hubby dick? Never mind, dick is probably afraid to go hunting with her!
1306738523215626240 2020-09-18 07:35:16 +0800 <JUthergi> @SunnySkyes53 @Advancedape2E Isn't that crazy? 6 corporate monopolies own 90% of all news outlets in this country. How did we get here? Apparently Nixon admin signed bill allowing news to present only one side of story and editorialize...to raise "viewers" for entertainment purposes.
1306736992613531649 2020-09-18 07:29:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Think about this mr stable genius, decisions you have made created the trump virus. You allowed it in, you failed to contain it. WTP won't forget trump the terrible!
1306735374081896454 2020-09-18 07:22:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Great statement by a rep.! Can't wait until vanky reads the fact check on her daddy worshipping. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese travelers came here after China's report to WHO and 40k more after the great and powerful travel ban? trump the terrible teetering towards failure...
1306733708091838466 2020-09-18 07:16:08 +0800 <JUthergi> @Advancedape2E Still wondering here, why not one "newshound" has dug deeper into vanky's Chinese Patented/Manufactured Voting Machines? Is it bc the are easily hackable to help daddy? Still sooo confused...
1306732272473837568 2020-09-18 07:10:26 +0800 <JUthergi> More bravery in the face of trump the terrible! Watch out Ms Troye, pence the pitiful will shortly begin his campaign to make you out as evil, but WTP know better!
1306729805665185793 2020-09-18 07:00:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Finally a brave soul to call out buffarilla barr!
1306724787415388162 2020-09-18 06:40:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Prior to the fall of the Roman Empire, there was the incident on the Ides of March.  Just wondering how different life could be if we had senators brave enough to take on our lunatic leader back in March?
1306723691330445313 2020-09-18 06:36:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Did they arrest wolf yet? Certainly they fear acting against barr.
1306723229617328129 2020-09-18 06:34:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Another rat getting ready to leave the trump ship?
1306722733359759361 2020-09-18 06:32:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Cowardice is often difficult to overcome, poor lil lindsie.
1306722047817588737 2020-09-18 06:29:48 +0800 <JUthergi> trump biz plan 101
1306657182923055106 2020-09-18 02:12:03 +0800 <JUthergi> For my wife, our daughters and our country's daughters u cannot vote for any coward of a man that forced himself upon another human being. If trump provided his dna or tried to prove innocence without attacking the women, could be worth the benefit of doubt...but he seems proud.
1306652587723231233 2020-09-18 01:53:48 +0800 <JUthergi> And we still can't get any n95 masks.
1306651489855836160 2020-09-18 01:49:26 +0800 <JUthergi> @girlsreallyrule Laughable Laura still at it? Haven't heard this "nails on a chalkboard" voice in a while...
1306650365446717440 2020-09-18 01:44:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @WhiteHouse Commendable! Maybe, if he didn't do all that damage by re-starting the Dakota Access Pipeline across the Sioux Territory protected by TREATY! Swing and a miss! Next batter!
1306649391432904706 2020-09-18 01:41:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like trump the terrible hit every Dept.?
1306648683811831809 2020-09-18 01:38:17 +0800 <JUthergi> So confusing...no masks to fight pandemic, but plenty of ninja tactical hoods? Dutiful citizens ready to rumble for something they just can't seem to understand? God blessed the USA only for us to be doomed by the dumb?
1306640674910015489 2020-09-18 01:06:27 +0800 <JUthergi> When will we realize that the enemy of the people is trump's corruption of govt?
1306640073379774465 2020-09-18 01:04:04 +0800 <JUthergi> While you're at it, please keep your pets close by, so many animals are trying to avoid the fires they could be seeking shelter in your neighborhood.  Leave buckets of water out daily. Don't approach, be aware. God speed west coasters!
1306636774417076224 2020-09-18 00:50:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like putin has mitch's military service record! Now it makes sense!  Mitch wasn't on his knees for fun he is on his knees bc putin could tell us all what mitch did during his military service of only a few months! See dailykos article for what a brave warrior mitch is not!
1306634430237335558 2020-09-18 00:41:38 +0800 <JUthergi> Are the rats getting ready to leave the sinking ship?
1306628195278614531 2020-09-18 00:16:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Already happening!
1306627437174890497 2020-09-18 00:13:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Once upon a time...
1306626993677643781 2020-09-18 00:12:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @AmyMcGrathKY @pamgriffa Check out dailykos article on mitch. Seems his attempt to hide his military record is failing. Seems there may have been inappropriate action by him that if revealed could bring him to his knees. Again. Ditch mitch!
1306621332214427648 2020-09-17 23:49:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @gibney2020 @kestrel607 @waltshaub Nixon opened the gates...
1306618984641572866 2020-09-17 23:40:16 +0800 <JUthergi> If they would just look into mitch's military records they might just find the inappropriate behaviors that could bring him to his knees, (no pun intended).  Dailykos has an insightful story them good ol boys of ol Kentucky need to hear!
1306614835006836736 2020-09-17 23:23:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe his quest for power is to keep his military record hidden?
1306611729091244032 2020-09-17 23:11:26 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be some new definition of a "journalist"?
1306611157248114688 2020-09-17 23:09:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey mitch!  Tell us about your service during the Vietnam War?  Optic neuritis? Lol! Political interference from a senator? Dishonorable discharge? Court Martial? Apparently some unbecoming behavior related to add sodomy?  Lots of questions in this article, tell us it ain't so?
1306605571492196352 2020-09-17 22:46:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The only mayhem is you!   You've absolutely failed us and can't protect us from your virus!  Its a pandemic, if we die to vote who will vote for you in 2024, 2028, 2032 etc?  Weakness, paranoia and fear seem to have consumed you.
1306603641609039877 2020-09-17 22:39:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Only in a red state...
1306603278764052482 2020-09-17 22:37:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't revolts produce anarchy? Maybe we should focus instead on top down renovations?
1306601847650750465 2020-09-17 22:32:10 +0800 <JUthergi> A weak, sickly loser!
1306364939930664966 2020-09-17 06:50:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Dr Lee? Guide us here, please.
1306363286712184833 2020-09-17 06:44:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Ever, right?
1306362754350157824 2020-09-17 06:42:06 +0800 <JUthergi> If 2/3 of our young folks don't know about holocaust, does that imply that 3/4 know even less about the  Indigenous American Genocide? The latter is the most horrific in all of world history...
1306361388214947845 2020-09-17 06:36:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Couldn't understand trump's reason for another meandering presser, then I read this. trump is just so disturbed, Biden is driving him craaazy.
1306358914460651520 2020-09-17 06:26:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Thought that was campaign literature, had trump's signature on it too. No one really understood why he signed it other than to promote himself.
1306339975189979136 2020-09-17 05:11:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be a bunker boy brother to trump...
1306339267417866248 2020-09-17 05:08:46 +0800 <JUthergi> But he'll cry failing is actually winning! He really thinks he is just the best he can imagine!
1306338747462619136 2020-09-17 05:06:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Why aren't his comments seditious? How is this not fomenting violence and inviting riots? i'm so very confused...
1306338021911007233 2020-09-17 05:03:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @RVAT2020 Did trump think it was one of putin's assassins? He better watch out, it's that easy!
1306331754664529922 2020-09-17 04:38:55 +0800 <JUthergi> It just gets uglier every time he speaks.  Is this the ONLY coherent plan WH developed?  WTP are seditionists bc we don't want trump to steal elections and rule by Military force.  Bad leadership? Take over country and blame the people!   no more statesmen to guard OUR REPUBLIC?
1306291415719260160 2020-09-17 01:58:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Of course he does, it's Joe Biden's job, but not until Jan 2021!!! Ol lumpy trumpy getting grumpy?
1306259835294568450 2020-09-16 23:53:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Step by wobbly step...
1306257418423328769 2020-09-16 23:43:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Why isn't this pic shown everywhere? It's perfect for a "just say no" campaign!
1306255131395190784 2020-09-16 23:34:27 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr So, you're still trying to protect corporate liabilities from the deaths of their employees due to your failure to stop the trump virus? Bless your l'il heart, you devious dude.
1306235352710029312 2020-09-16 22:15:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe the chosen one is getting ready to perform a miracle?
1306231132359471105 2020-09-16 21:59:05 +0800 <JUthergi> Since i'm always whining about the 6 news monopolies beholden to the parties/ corporate interests, i'm gonna check this independent agency out. If you do too, pls share insights wi me. TY
1305962529521360901 2020-09-16 04:11:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Greatest deal maker ever, cheated?
1305962136951287810 2020-09-16 04:10:11 +0800 <JUthergi> @ddale8 @fresh2oh Maybe he only read the jacket...
1305961283909570560 2020-09-16 04:06:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Was this pic taken just before their Pvt meeting in Helsinki?  Sure would explain trump's demeanor heading to podium to tell us about putin's very powerful denials of election interference.
1305957266336645127 2020-09-16 03:50:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Prove it! Maybe vanky won't let him, his leash is pretty tight.
1305956771559862275 2020-09-16 03:48:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Public records.
1305955495413514243 2020-09-16 03:43:48 +0800 <JUthergi> UN is silent? How do we get Nuremberg Trials started again? Seriously, what are we doing?
1305951449940140032 2020-09-16 03:27:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Get em !!!
1305950602502057984 2020-09-16 03:24:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1305897753734787074 2020-09-15 23:54:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news! The 6 corporate giants owning 90% of all "news" outlets have agreed to allow trump's sadistic nature to lead us into civil insurrection! Why? Because of the advertising dollars from ratings covering Martial Law! Greed goons gone wild!!!
1305896081419636736 2020-09-15 23:47:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Based on team trump's telling us that the election is rigged and already a fraud, like 2016 he cannot be the legitimate pres. He keeps on same path of lying/cheating he will hand presidency to Spkr of the House per US Constitution. Brilliant stable genius?
1305894093130694657 2020-09-15 23:39:48 +0800 <JUthergi> jr jr jr, does your daddy know you said the word "science", shame on you! Don't you think the most important question is how did almost 200k people die because of the trump virus? Or what will daddy do to STOP the deaths of 200k more people? Not very presidential of you jr.
1305890880310702082 2020-09-15 23:27:02 +0800 <JUthergi> WOW!!! This must be the most accurate &amp; informative summary of trump's step by step dismantling of OUR REPUBLIC rules for law &amp;  order to date. It was so painfully disconcerting i couldn't finish and had to print it out before it goes "missing". Please read! Knowledge is power!
1305885020373086209 2020-09-15 23:03:45 +0800 <JUthergi> And the Guardians of Liberty went into hiding first...
1305884089812242433 2020-09-15 23:00:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Did he already collect his cut?
1305883006054412290 2020-09-15 22:55:45 +0800 <JUthergi> and the trump virus rages on...
1305881721091559424 2020-09-15 22:50:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Seems like he is trying to get even wi WTP for voting for a woman over him in 2016! Maybe after 2.9m of us die he will "miraculously" present a plan to eradicate C19, but not until he gets total death count.
1305880845295783936 2020-09-15 22:47:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump    TY Dr Blotcky! Summary of the sadism that is trump!   Seems like trump is still so angry he lost pop vote to a woman by 2.9 MILLION VOTES that he wants 2.9 MILLION of us to die for his revenge!
1305877363700445186 2020-09-15 22:33:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews Vote for our lives and for those souls buried by trump's incompetence &amp; greed!
1305876621375741952 2020-09-15 22:30:23 +0800 <JUthergi> These people didn't drink the kool-aid, they are iv mainlining, like heroin!
1305858945135894535 2020-09-15 21:20:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Wow! GW must have had a premonition of mitch!!!
1305858582416633857 2020-09-15 21:18:42 +0800 <JUthergi> What do you think the framers would say about you? You perpetrate bad ideas for WTP and reward bad ideas for corporate donors. Didn't anyone ever tell you the only way to defeat a bad ideas is to come up with a better idea? You failed miserably in better ideas for several decades
1305849472526757889 2020-09-15 20:42:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Perfect example of willful ignorance and conscious stupidity...
1305849094477426688 2020-09-15 20:41:00 +0800 <JUthergi> vanky &amp; jared..
1305848758903754754 2020-09-15 20:39:40 +0800 <JUthergi> That would be great, especially because even under oath it's not likely he can be truthful!
1305847173930782720 2020-09-15 20:33:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Imagine how great our country could be if all the reps in DC were like this woman? No more greedy wrinkly white entitled corporate stooges!
1305635917311422465 2020-09-15 06:33:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @KOVO1029 @NikkiEastment @ZackCz @ProjectLincoln Maybe we should all mail a trumpkin to the WH?
1305635365450067969 2020-09-15 06:31:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Not just a meme anymore!
1305635100902780931 2020-09-15 06:30:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not ask your buddy trump where are his tax returns? Good optics, stand in a gun store in your casual outfit so you can be one of the people?  Be brave lil lindsie, go hunting wi dick cheney! Please, real men do!
1305633495281262592 2020-09-15 06:24:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Careful sir. They'll be playing your songs at the next rally...vengeance is donnie's says donnie
1305631528408547330 2020-09-15 06:16:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Again, he hopes and denies Science...what is wrong with this beastly being???
1305630848310546432 2020-09-15 06:13:46 +0800 <JUthergi> trump us killing us...
1305629515104825344 2020-09-15 06:08:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Biden was forced to gather team bc trump already has his minions doing everything they can to disrupt/ rig election.  EC doesn't vote until December, why not keep counting until December 1???  trump feels entitled to 12 more years and using all means avail able, not legal to win!
1305626364947714052 2020-09-15 05:55:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like she's going to vote for Biden? Be best baby!
1305563484231471105 2020-09-15 01:46:05 +0800 <JUthergi> hey jr, any chance all that work you claim your daddy is doing, will it ever help WTP? Is it true vanky is trying to get rid of you &amp; eric? A lot of people are talking bc she wants to be vp after pence is fired...
1305561875262984193 2020-09-15 01:39:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Entitled, says it all.
1305516720845721601 2020-09-14 22:40:16 +0800 <JUthergi> No body wants to see this, but many thanks to SK for bringing this out in the open!   Keep an eye on ivanky, she seems like the trumpy clan puppet master!
1305515199504551936 2020-09-14 22:34:13 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  We see through your pt barnum bs.
1305511335506202624 2020-09-14 22:18:52 +0800 <JUthergi> please pay attention!
1305511058107445250 2020-09-14 22:17:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @funder @fresh2oh WTP were calling it the trump virus long before a politician latched onto the term!
1305505529423433731 2020-09-14 21:55:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump don't forget how we captured airports from the Brits in the 1st American Revolution!
1305504673781121024 2020-09-14 21:52:23 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Did you see this sir? It's all the talk at our senior community! Everyone thinks your ship is sinking!
1305502497050685441 2020-09-14 21:43:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Is your whole team turning away from you?
1305279255455117312 2020-09-14 06:56:40 +0800 <JUthergi> With trump at the helm at least citizens united corps will not be funneling as much money as usual to buy Presidents, sens &amp; congress.
1305272489057099778 2020-09-14 06:29:46 +0800 <JUthergi> @DenbrotS @marylferris1 The last of our statesmen...
1305272268902338562 2020-09-14 06:28:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Dear President Carter:  Thank you! Any chance you could gather the rest of our real Presidents for a joint statement of condemnation on trump before he destroys OUR REPUBLIC? Please?
1305271390334005250 2020-09-14 06:25:24 +0800 <JUthergi> Hey ronna! Were you named for the corona virus or beer? i'm not president either but since trump us failing so miserably you could blame me too!
1305270423643402241 2020-09-14 06:21:34 +0800 <JUthergi> This woman is actually blaming all of lumpy trumpy failures on Biden. Their campaign is so bereft of ideas on how to overcome trump's failures that everything he did wrong is now Biden's fault! Does trump campaign offer lobotomies to all workers &amp; supporters, or is it voluntary?
1305188105016815618 2020-09-14 00:54:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Ol mitch is likely blocking the law bc elaine beats his wrinkly pink butt and humiliates him daily. He wants protection for all wimps like him to be included in bill.  The worst of humanity is seen when one uses physical power to attack the weak...
1305186666366210048 2020-09-14 00:48:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Finally someone pulls the mike on these twisted trump sychophants!  If you don't answer the questions you have no right to babble on.
1305184221854601217 2020-09-14 00:39:02 +0800 <JUthergi> ghouliani ingratiating himself once again hoping trump will give him a job...
1305182471689056257 2020-09-14 00:32:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @DonaldJTrumpJr  You might try telling that to your daddy if he grants you an audience... Why do you always look so stoned ever since convention? Your girlfriend trick you into sniffing sugar, for energy in interviews?
1305179711069401090 2020-09-14 00:21:06 +0800 <JUthergi> It shows! @realDonaldTrump
1305170416340738049 2020-09-13 23:44:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps dipstick donnie is devoid of dna? His big secret is that he is simply not human? Sure would explain a lot! It could prove his innocence so logic dictates he must be guilty of raping our women, something enemies do in war...
1305169029968076800 2020-09-13 23:38:40 +0800 <JUthergi> If he determines something in his mind he speaks it out as fact. My grand do the same thing. They're 4&amp;6. Yet his family just let's him babble on, how embarrassing is that?
1305159789668950020 2020-09-13 23:01:57 +0800 <JUthergi> @WitchCherokee Keep safe
1304858472098541569 2020-09-13 03:04:37 +0800 <JUthergi> mitch mcconnell does though, as evidenced by his recently rejected "skinny bill".
1304855947899211776 2020-09-13 02:54:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Without fact checkers and immediate reports to monitors and candidates, there is no point for debate. Monitors must call out all lies, half truths, alternate facts etc. So that WTP can find one last spark of hope through integrity of debates.  Only 6 "news" monopolies, just 1?
1304851864006131712 2020-09-13 02:38:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Confirmation is great, but does anyone seriously have any doubts? It may be hard to prove that this is not the S.O.P. for every agency...
1304850546818514949 2020-09-13 02:33:07 +0800 <JUthergi> Another song from decades ago proving that history does repeat itself, especially when we don't pay attention...
1304848569892036609 2020-09-13 02:25:16 +0800 <JUthergi> How us it that people most familiar, (e.g. lawyer), with the laws and especially laws of treason, are able to actually commit treason without repercussions?  How did he escape from the dark place he's been hiding anyway?
1304845448973291526 2020-09-13 02:12:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Funniest joke I've heard in months!
1304843288957067268 2020-09-13 02:04:17 +0800 <JUthergi> All these witch hunts are a hoax right? presuming trump is of male gender that would imply any witch hunts were for females. No warlock hunts yet. Many very smart people always thought they were after you, sarah huckleberry, and creepy anne conway bc of all the leaks...
1304764441569955840 2020-09-12 20:50:58 +0800 <JUthergi> @Ky_Gill28 @Stoptheinsani20 More likely that in this admin, he'll get a promotion.
1304552871946584068 2020-09-12 06:50:16 +0800 <JUthergi> This is his way of saying he will not go quietly! He's already calling the election fraudulent &amp; rigged. Using the term "insurrection" means once he gets rioting in the street he calls in US Military to end it. Martial Law, all legal per Patriot Act &amp; barr's test run in DC!  Real
1304487094522388482 2020-09-12 02:28:54 +0800 <JUthergi> People observe trump's symptoms, running nose, particles falling from nose, speech impediments etc and opine he is in drugs. Que fox so he can run out and accuse his opponent if that which he appears to be guilty of...same old same old.
1304483718850109442 2020-09-12 02:15:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Perhaps it's time to start The Orwellian Doublespeak Award annually for the most prolific liars, (liers for trump), of our elected elite. 1st prize = expense pd vacation, (permanent) 2nd prize = 50% pay cut and no lulu's 3rd prize = no public speaking ever  Term limits?
1304480813724192770 2020-09-12 02:03:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @DayleBrand Spying on us???
1304480558731460609 2020-09-12 02:02:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Or LA hurricane victims? Or the farmers devasted by last spring's flooding in the Midwest? Silly me, I thought people's lives should be prioritized over campaign...
1304479620356505603 2020-09-12 01:59:12 +0800 <JUthergi> I guess if they agreed to talk peacefully, that's enough for you all to make grandiose claims about bringing peace to ME, it's what you do best! Just let us know when there is an actual treaty signed... PS jared's fly was open in breaking presser wi your daddy.
1304475836943302661 2020-09-12 01:44:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @SPending2020 @grandpooba5440 @IvankaTrump Poor child...no wonder she is so evil.
1304474378680307713 2020-09-12 01:38:22 +0800 <JUthergi> If ever law enforcement had to "throw the book" at someone, that person is trump! It seems the only crime he certainly cannot be convicted if is a traffic violation, only because he has a chauffeur.
1304470762619887617 2020-09-12 01:24:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @JohnLukeSam1 The only possible comparison is the portly proportions of the men.  Churchill led.  trump is the newest barker of the Barnum &amp; Bailey sideshows...
1304420225253863426 2020-09-11 22:03:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Why this blatant attempt to manipulate the market is not being reported everywhere confirms that we no longer have a free press. It is bought and paid for... Behind this lies the truth if how the pres is trying to bankrupt our country...
1304419313873498113 2020-09-11 21:59:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @slem63 @bokoo143 In this pic ghouliani looks like he's just risen from the crypt at sundown!

1304408579458379776 2020-09-11 21:16:54 +0800 <JUthergi> If you read this please consider it your Civic duty to RT.
1304406677563805700 2020-09-11 21:09:21 +0800 <JUthergi> @senatemajldr mitch, you focused on protecting corporate donors from liability because you have no plan to protect us from C19. You've done nothing to help WTP you forced out of work. Sounds like dems did the right thing, thanks for letting us know! When did you get back from vacation?
1304404266472308737 2020-09-11 20:59:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Our farmers might disagree...
1304404041783562241 2020-09-11 20:58:52 +0800 <JUthergi> trump's economic prowess will bankrupt of all us
1304402225549185024 2020-09-11 20:51:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Another fine example of how much WTP are truly valued by our elected elite...
1304398989840834563 2020-09-11 20:38:48 +0800 <JUthergi> @wallydog12967 @FilipkowskiRon @AJDelgado13 @TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump Doh! BOC of course! Guess i'm in my way to being the dotard of this group! TY folks! Been thinking that with all this craziness, dark side of the moon would be a good place to hide out?
1304230091497631745 2020-09-11 09:27:39 +0800 <JUthergi> @HKrassenstein @michpoligal Wondering if the supporter with his "Get a brian! U morans!" sign is there? Is it an incredible and unbelievable bigly crowd, setting all new records?
1304226384911441920 2020-09-11 09:12:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @FilipkowskiRon @AJDelgado13 @TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump i gladly 2nd your Door's nomination, if, in good ol DC fashion, you'll do me a favor though... Thinking your song should be followed by Pink Floyd's "Don't Fear The Reaper. Deal?
1304224015742111746 2020-09-11 09:03:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @LivelyHuman @grandpooba5440 @CLH45 @IvankaTrump @newsobserver thinking she doesn't need to buy votes.   daddy's job, quid pro quo, u know?  She's sneaking her Chinese Patented/Manufactured voting machines into blue states to help daddy.
1304212260332679171 2020-09-11 08:16:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Do they get it yet?
1304170363396542470 2020-09-11 05:30:19 +0800 <JUthergi> He has given comfort and aid to so many that want OUR REPUBLIC to fail, how is this not treason? Why no 25th Ammend. removal? Why no arrests?
1304168825055776768 2020-09-11 05:24:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Who writes this? It's like you want the guy to look bad...  No worries though, most of us already know how bad he is, we're mostly afraid if what he might do!  Get out now, while you still can!
1304167294357180416 2020-09-11 05:18:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @sabinenamba @hanOlie @politvidchannel @BrendaFB @KamalaHarris @RodRosenstein Lawyers never ask a question unless they have the answers before hand...unless it's wild b barr asking rhetorical questions to distract us from trump.
1304166369487982593 2020-09-11 05:14:27 +0800 <JUthergi> According to mitch his job priority is to insure gop supremacy in senate and protect corporate liability due to C19...wow
1304163822702297088 2020-09-11 05:04:20 +0800 <JUthergi> Apparently dead people can't contribute to his campaign and the working families having lost loved ones are too broke to compete with his big biz cronies...
1304161901367230464 2020-09-11 04:56:42 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Knight, agree with much of what you tweet, but is it not the absolute corruption that is invited in DC. by the elected elite? Rather than despair over capitalism, it is part of the successes we share. We need to find balance in socially oriented democracy for our Republic. TY
1304158345910198274 2020-09-11 04:42:34 +0800 <JUthergi> @SethAbramson @Cubfan13241 @SenJohnKennedy So, nobody told him about his lobotomy yet?
1304157821362110465 2020-09-11 04:40:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Just wondering if it would it be difficult to introduce to us any congressional "rep" or senator NOT corrupted or involved in scamming WTP?  Sure would make your job easier, right?
1304156227560255488 2020-09-11 04:34:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Perfectly l'il lindsie! SC for the sake of our country please send the graham cracker home to a tub of milk.
1304101267401302018 2020-09-11 00:55:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Our moscow mitch calls gop senate "battle", (ooh, such powerful words), like a knife fight in an alley! rofl! Like this guy ever held anything sharper than a butter knife? Just his way of telling donors he needs more money?
1304097189464072193 2020-09-11 00:39:33 +0800 <JUthergi> Great, just great! ghouliani back from the dark shadows... Does anyone doubt that his giving aid &amp; comfort to our enemies is treasonous? Well, excepting trump of course...
1304066580674994178 2020-09-10 22:37:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Rage over what you yourself said, sir? Say it ain't so!
1304061299928846339 2020-09-10 22:16:56 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe you could remind us in the next speech how trump also disregarded established plans expecting virus, then he fired the CAT Team?
1304060122940035075 2020-09-10 22:12:16 +0800 <JUthergi> It is gonna get uglier
1304059635016577026 2020-09-10 22:10:19 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   We see you hiding!
1304058337613549568 2020-09-10 22:05:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Dear Presidents Carter, Bush, Clinton and Obama: OUR REPUBLIC teeters on the edge of disaster. Those sworn to protect WTP have been corrupted beyond our ability to effect change. Please, can we count on your words of wisdom to guide us? Before it's too late...
1304049254613295108 2020-09-10 21:29:05 +0800 <JUthergi> This works! However for his followers and for trump to understand it, it is spelled m o r a n. Otherwise he could call us l i e r s.
1304047152222605314 2020-09-10 21:20:43 +0800 <JUthergi> They always attack the truth tellers so listeners  can't focus on the truth in all the distraction, but truth always prevails.
1304045438568407040 2020-09-10 21:13:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trump the terrible is The Great Pretender!
1303841345862275072 2020-09-10 07:42:55 +0800 <JUthergi> trump the terrible strikes again!!!
1303840302533431297 2020-09-10 07:38:46 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking we won't know just how heavily involved in the trump virus conspiracy  we can watch all the elected elite use the same replies.
1303839163721093120 2020-09-10 07:34:15 +0800 <JUthergi> If trump is the self proclaimed chosen one, why the hell is he not performing all these miracles he keeps blabbering about???  He could use one about now, but i think he's just going to blame it all on eric, jr, jared, lindsie &amp; mitch.
1303837968130617346 2020-09-10 07:29:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Why not just cut your BS and honor your oath of office? Oh right, you forgot about that when you and laine started offering quid pro quo to donors? The enemies of the people are the elected elite hiding in DC.
1303836154568081412 2020-09-10 07:22:18 +0800 <JUthergi> Poor eric. Did it occur to you that this is just another white flag if unconditional surrender? Just like with trump virus...our war time pres just surrenders.
1303809607354155008 2020-09-10 05:36:48 +0800 <JUthergi> Anyone else expecting this talking head to just explode one day?
1303809191853912066 2020-09-10 05:35:09 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking that trump tapes will make nixon tapes look like an innocent schoolgirl's fantasies in her diary...
1303771572642164737 2020-09-10 03:05:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @OldParaTRP @DanPrats @NatashaBertrand Often thought the funding came from the almost $1b rumsfeld made disappear after 911. Fine print in Patriot Act was like some sci fi future! Almost as if they took Orwell's 1984 as a template for being our overlords! TY O.P!
1303769542666190848 2020-09-10 02:57:36 +0800 <JUthergi> Hope so! Anything to get him out! Pardons do not extend to charges brought after he is out, right? Please correct me if i'm mistaken. i'm just grasping for hope...
1303768239072251906 2020-09-10 02:52:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @VP  Head of task force? Was your task to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans? Is it because jared told you it would only affect blue states?
1303765587563339779 2020-09-10 02:41:53 +0800 <JUthergi> PLEASE! Somebody take action!
1303764493462372355 2020-09-10 02:37:32 +0800 <JUthergi> Well alrighty then, guess this sets precedent for wild billy boy to defend him in all cases known and as of yet, unknown accusations of rape!   Dozens of women that deserve to NOT have the fed gov to rape them all!  No innocent man would use this power!  Is it time for 25th A yet
1303762004134551552 2020-09-10 02:27:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you Mrs Simmons! Not from your state, wish i was. Your courage to speak out about the cowardice of the congress / senate cabinet members reminds this country that we are A REPUBLIC! Governed by law and the necessary consent of WTP! Proof is everywhere!  Vote 4 her!
1303732838844506112 2020-09-10 00:31:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Where is Benedict Arnold's grave site?
1303732500959723521 2020-09-10 00:30:25 +0800 <JUthergi> @TomJChicago Mr Chicago, sir, I think you just gave him another excuse... Likely we'll hear him make the claim, lol.
1303730364918231048 2020-09-10 00:21:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Maybe never again...all the more reason to make the change!
1303730095358705667 2020-09-10 00:20:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Why is there not one cabinet member willing to draft 25th Ammendment letter to senate? It's not like we couldn't see this daily! Miraculously disappear?
1303729082874703872 2020-09-10 00:16:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't they all? Service to an informed electorate is pretty non-existent. It's all about service to advertisers.
1303727165889015808 2020-09-10 00:09:13 +0800 <JUthergi> Just another rich white boy knowing he could get away with murder?  He sounds so much like  saddam hussein's kid...
1303725502163824640 2020-09-10 00:02:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @chuckleof @senatemajldr Rhetorical question right? He believes our willful ignorance allows him free reign, they all do. We do not consent!
1303724222456442882 2020-09-09 23:57:31 +0800 <JUthergi> i'd guess they spent the money on vanky's new Chinese patented/ manufactured voting machines.  trump knows he is losing, her machines will tip the balance to enable his goal of king for life. Hers to be princess, after she makes jr &amp; eric disappear on the upcoming grizzly hunt.
1303722249669746688 2020-09-09 23:49:40 +0800 <JUthergi> Well, it sounds like the guy has a true grasp for the obvious.  Can you tell us something we don't know???  trump had been telling us this from the beginning and no one listened bc they figured he could help their own personal agendas.
1303720664478691331 2020-09-09 23:43:23 +0800 <JUthergi> Unbelievable, (not believable), courage from Aman with the best healthcare in the world!
1303718596762312704 2020-09-09 23:35:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Thinking the reason for the deafening silence from DC reps is due to their own corruption.  As long as heat is on trump they can continue their scurrying around in the darkness, like rats...
1303683457059561478 2020-09-09 21:15:32 +0800 <JUthergi> So funny! This can't be real, unless it's transactional. Did you promise a trump hotel in Norway? Is today April 1st?
1303682087178981377 2020-09-09 21:10:05 +0800 <JUthergi> It ain't over yet! Just picture the day when the fat man sings as he is dragged out of OUR HOUSE!
1303681070915870720 2020-09-09 21:06:03 +0800 <JUthergi> Why would an innocent man fight so hard to not clear himself?
1303674644466147328 2020-09-09 20:40:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @wearamaskbrah @DonaldJTrumpJr Perfect pic for a model of the lumpy trumpy bobblehead doll?
1303672458474643458 2020-09-09 20:31:49 +0800 <JUthergi> Are there no laws they will not dismiss?  Why are the elected elite so silent as team trump dismantles OUR REPUBLIC?  The cowardice of these politicians in DC cry out to us to vote them all out!  Let us begin with all new representatives of WTP, if we can find worthy candidates.
1303479524466843648 2020-09-09 07:45:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Must be that he is freaked out that courts ordered him to give DNA sample? Billy boy, save me?
1303440704149037058 2020-09-09 05:10:55 +0800 <JUthergi> Protestors the world over are practicing silent marches so as not to invite the authorities to crack skulls etc. Can we find a way to work with authority to stop the violence? If we don't, we could lose our rights to PEACEFUL assembly!
1303438203530153984 2020-09-09 05:00:59 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepDonBeyer @Cubfan13241 @JeffreyGoldberg Don't forget how trump took reno/upgrades $$ foro military bases in europe, to pay for his 3 or 4 miles of actual new border wall in South... Btw is that wall still standing?
1303437102445670403 2020-09-09 04:56:36 +0800 <JUthergi> @benferrer1025 @RepDonBeyer @davidfrum @JeffreyGoldberg Only 20k lies? Sir, we need a fact check here. Since the trump virus hit he has doubled down on the lies. Betting he has at least 40k by now? TY!
1303435664713752577 2020-09-09 04:50:53 +0800 <JUthergi> @LissaKEvans @atrupar If it is paid for by govt, just another crime that he gets away with.  TY for sharing. Please RT! He is doing all he can to rig election. If he makes an accusation, he is doing just that which he accuses others of. Patterns of past behavior are the best indicators of future acts!
1303424876812865539 2020-09-09 04:08:01 +0800 <JUthergi> Are you upset that the other spinners are better at spinning than you are, mr hammity?
1303301013944885249 2020-09-08 19:55:50 +0800 <JUthergi> ???
1303087428836696065 2020-09-08 05:47:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Had to make sure you saw this, sir.
1303083153792405505 2020-09-08 05:30:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Why are you promoting a vaccine for HOAX?  Didn't our war time pres already win this fight, were his actions against the invisible enemy... invisible?  i'm so confused!
1303081378901364739 2020-09-08 05:23:05 +0800 <JUthergi> @politico @Cubfan13241 Wow, I actually might agree with that. You can't have a successful Military Industrial Machine without war. Politicians would lose donations. Oh no! They want to go to war again!
1303078442250969091 2020-09-08 05:11:25 +0800 <JUthergi> vanky? Love it, she seems always cranky. cranky vanky fit?
1303077770138988547 2020-09-08 05:08:45 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  But I thought the farmers loved you for doing more for them than anybody in history? So many ungrateful?
1303076465995665408 2020-09-08 05:03:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Much better. TY! ghouliani 8s most appropriate, my nephew thinks he looks like the cartoon dad in "Despicable Me"?
1302974652998877186 2020-09-07 22:19:00 +0800 <JUthergi> @ReportsDaNews gooliani still around? was thinking moscow recalled him for his failures in attacking Biden...
1302973931079503872 2020-09-07 22:16:07 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Got any miraculous plan to stop C19 from killing another 250k people before inauguration day? Anything?
1302971683943387138 2020-09-07 22:07:12 +0800 <JUthergi> TY Dr Lee! You and your seem to be the only ones trying to save OUR REPUBLIC! That our congress was informed &amp; did nothing is more heinous a crime than the illegalities if the trump syndicate. That trump supporters will not read this ENTIRE report is so disconcerting...
1302962920473661441 2020-09-07 21:32:22 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1302961738581774337 2020-09-07 21:27:40 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  ...and if they don't treat our veterans well, we say sorry, your fired, get out! Can you hear us yet???
1302960536682889216 2020-09-07 21:22:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it contained yet?
1302959603458736128 2020-09-07 21:19:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Mr Winslow, sir?  Based upon the referenced sens. lack of action to stop the destruction of OUR REPUBLIC, is that a rhetorical question???
1302954816075894784 2020-09-07 21:00:10 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1302952059193393154 2020-09-07 20:49:13 +0800 <JUthergi> The 6th extinction?
1302951468966858756 2020-09-07 20:46:52 +0800 <JUthergi> trump has repeatedly over the years stated his intent to not accept election results!  At least there is one Sen., Senator Sanders willing to see this truth.  Election is no longer about choice of best man to lead. It's about the direct challenge to the laws of our Republic!
1302681602506600449 2020-09-07 02:54:31 +0800 <JUthergi> Reassuring news, as ive been preaching to the choir far too long.
1302679875455799297 2020-09-07 02:47:39 +0800 <JUthergi> So far...01/20/2021 is a looonnnggg time.
1302678614056620032 2020-09-07 02:42:38 +0800 <JUthergi> @OBXJEN @ReportsDaNews But so does trump, that's why their such good friends.
1302675470941663233 2020-09-07 02:30:09 +0800 <JUthergi> The old guy that keeps screaming LAW &amp; ORDER strikes again.  his orders, his laws
1302674426710953984 2020-09-07 02:26:00 +0800 <JUthergi> What journalism used to be...
1302670013019684864 2020-09-07 02:08:28 +0800 <JUthergi> The trump virus rages on.  He knows it kills us and will do nothing to stop another 250k deaths coming our way.  If he's the chosen one where is his war time presidential miracle?
1302667896716484612 2020-09-07 02:00:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   Does it hurt your feelings to know the only people that salute you are our own soldiers, because they are forced to? Kim's guys are laughing at you too...
1302663031793606657 2020-09-07 01:40:43 +0800 <JUthergi> Any info dug up on the almost $1b that mysteriously disappeared under cheney &amp; rumsfeld ? That would make a great read too. Any chance we could get cheney to take trump hunting?
1302370178701942786 2020-09-06 06:17:02 +0800 <JUthergi> oh no! eric are these all the veterans that your dad offended?  https://t.co/P4JTCkQx5r
1302303402588868614 2020-09-06 01:51:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Thank you for the courage you show in speaking out Major Demarco! Stay safe! By your courage we hope many will follow!
1302301726167441410 2020-09-06 01:45:01 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Why is everybody always picking on you?   sir, if you like I will be your friend.   I'd like you to do me a favor though, I feel that I should get the medal of freedom award cause everybody will be picking on me too.  What do you say? People say I'm very loyal...
1302300486570254337 2020-09-06 01:40:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @Getsmart4 Very disturbing that "cdc guidelines" mailed earlier this we're basically campaign materials wi his childlike scratch signature.
1302297704433938433 2020-09-06 01:29:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump
1302296681069842435 2020-09-06 01:24:58 +0800 <JUthergi> Is it so his supporters can vote twice?
1302294124184432640 2020-09-06 01:14:49 +0800 <JUthergi> If 700 out of 1m+/- soldiers sign a letter he calls it support?  As credible as his make believe polls.  What does he call the hundreds of doj officials, bar assoc lawyers, judges, medical professionals and Armed Forces leaders that call him unfit?
1302290821769760769 2020-09-06 01:01:41 +0800 <JUthergi> Next our lumpy trumpy will take credit for winning all the wars USA Armed Forces ever fought.
1302224053034520578 2020-09-05 20:36:23 +0800 <JUthergi> And the children shall lead them
1302223333753266177 2020-09-05 20:33:31 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  You still wondering why people, many smart people don't like you???
1302219005344784387 2020-09-05 20:16:19 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like trump needs more donations to his campaign fund and maybe a few new charities?
1302216856741253120 2020-09-05 20:07:47 +0800 <JUthergi> @VP  Well sir, you should probably reconsider how great a job your doing on C19.  Seems that your homeland is the latest hit spot spreading the disease that miraculously didn't disappear. Don't forget to thank the pres for his leadership.
1302210140947582976 2020-09-05 19:41:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Leaders of our Armed Forces know a wannabe dictator when they see one...
1302042676578185222 2020-09-05 08:35:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Lol! That's not a new strategy, it started in Jan 2017, right?
1302041732553543680 2020-09-05 08:31:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Looks like those C19 stimulus loans went to good use?  Sad part is that his loan was a mere pittance compared to what that guy in the treasury is hiding from WTP.
1302025047360573442 2020-09-05 07:25:36 +0800 <JUthergi> If one looks at the video of trump and putin coming out of pvt meeting at Helsinki, it becomes quite obvious that putin had trump on his knees...still does.
1302023398621577217 2020-09-05 07:19:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @JohnLukeSam1 Preferring not to discuss religion I do however have to agree.  Likely their vote for trump is on cultist loyalty and that they wouldn't believe that Jesus was Jewish or dark skinned...  I do pray for Divine Intervention daily since 01.21.17.
1302021180606554113 2020-09-05 07:10:14 +0800 <JUthergi> In grade school we were taught about yellow journalism.  Today all I see are entertainment shows.  Our 4th estate? lol  What i see today has no color, just the stench of excrement hitting the rotary oscillator.  Didn't want to be crude, apologies to the ladies and gents...
1302018469614030848 2020-09-05 06:59:28 +0800 <JUthergi> @Katpa73 @pamgriffa @Barkiologist They all were driven...apparently our darling boy was mad at something Macron had said.  Or, more likely he saw the pic of the look of lust melania had for Macron?  Either way, it just seems  trump cannot tell a truth...
1302016831155326977 2020-09-05 06:52:57 +0800 <JUthergi> here is an intelligence test for fox viewers...  Would trump be so angry IF he hadn't said those horrible things?
1302011913157648385 2020-09-05 06:33:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  Still confused here, sir.  With 410k deaths now predicted over next few months, how will you prevent these deaths?   War time pres strategically plan to prevent casualties.  As war time pres you have the allowed more deaths to occur than any pres in history! WHY
1301885976709664770 2020-09-04 22:12:59 +0800 <JUthergi> Add instant report to candidate's so we can see their reaction to being caught in a lie?
1301885204978597889 2020-09-04 22:09:55 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   If you are so worried about voter fraud and election tampering, why not just call in the UN to monitor our elections???  The USA is one of the first to call the UN when a power hungry dictator type seems to be manipulating elections.  What do you have to lose?
1301872853009260544 2020-09-04 21:20:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Don't we have enough to worry about? This is a very informative look at our genius with the power to destroy life as we know it. Please vote to remove this unbalanced man...
1301863708583440384 2020-09-04 20:44:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Ooooh, so scary!  jr so how do i become a mind reader like you and your daddy? Do u just not listen to anyone and wait for something to enter the emptiness of your mind?  Is it like a coven or a cult?  It must be more than trying to stay on the gravy train.
1301661551003406337 2020-09-04 07:21:12 +0800 <JUthergi> Suspecting he has laid the groundwork, assist by barr, he will declare election void, claim nat. emergency &amp; Martial Law.  If we do not consent, if we resist our streets will be bloody and he will attack WTP so mercy.  TY Dr. Lee! We need your help as our elected elite refuse to!
1301657065287450624 2020-09-04 07:03:22 +0800 <JUthergi> Seriously people!  We must call for psychiatric, physical and common sense testing for all future Presidents!
1301656299994853377 2020-09-04 07:00:20 +0800 <JUthergi> So tell us l'il lindsie, how much did your lunch cost WTP? I mean in all the tax breaks, non repayment loans, material tax / labor exemptions, etc.?  PS your C19 stewardship has a major breakout at USC, why not visit there wl thoughts and prayers?
1301655042538250241 2020-09-04 06:55:20 +0800 <JUthergi> @business @StanChart Maybe WTP should declare a war on corporate treasuries?
1301654073247256576 2020-09-04 06:51:29 +0800 <JUthergi> No members of senate &amp; congress. Since both are owing to their corporate donors and they make the laws that guarantee corp profit stock market investments should be criminal.  WTP already pay too much for decades of profits over people!
1301648849195462657 2020-09-04 06:30:43 +0800 <JUthergi> @journopixs @navywife53sco @JeffreyGoldberg @BoutrousTed @TheAtlantic It seems that he expects all to worship him and is seriously confused as to how that could possibly be that we don't.  You've heard him many times, that guy didn't go to my party, that guy was mean...  Now he just hates everyone, excepting other dictator's of course.
1301644147678478339 2020-09-04 06:12:02 +0800 <JUthergi> @SethAbramson Nobody expects wolfie to be that intelligent.  Great insights, TY Mr Abramson!
1301643142043758600 2020-09-04 06:08:03 +0800 <JUthergi> @smc429 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Breaking news! Ivanka and jr signed dear ol dad into a psychiatric unit!  Apparently she stated that the way he's running things she'll never get to be president. jr had a runny nose and refused comment. eric just grinned.
1301628997093208069 2020-09-04 05:11:50 +0800 <JUthergi> @OlivaArce1 @FAIRImmigration True strength comes from survivors of the greatest genocide in the history of mankind, (1492-1938+/-).
1301627827687690245 2020-09-04 05:07:11 +0800 <JUthergi> What i find most despicable is how often admits it !
1301625025372524547 2020-09-04 04:56:03 +0800 <JUthergi> It's been reported that the REAL store owner's refused to meet with trump.  Trump met with the guy that owned the land only!  But hey, great optics eh?
1301624398571622404 2020-09-04 04:53:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Things just keep getting uglier each day... I have a 12 yo nephew that thinks trump is the cause of so much hate. His parents voted trump. Can one logically conclude the typ trump supporter is less intelligent than a child?
1301621358367997954 2020-09-04 04:41:29 +0800 <JUthergi> Going to deliver your Chinese patented &amp; manufactured Voting Machines so daddy's supporters can vote twice?  PS Are you really considering how to make jr disappear so you can be president? Or is the rumour that he's after you? Trust no one!
1301618847481573376 2020-09-04 04:31:30 +0800 <JUthergi> Yes! As a person's integrity helps us to decide our vote, from this day forward candidates must debate with live fact checking, but the facts should also be related immediately to candidates so WTP can judge integrity and see if it is a single error or a pathological pattern.
1301617254883299328 2020-09-04 04:25:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Despite this administration's claims, C19 8s not disappearing or going away miraculously!  We pray for miracles only after we have failed...and still no plan?
1301616630988967937 2020-09-04 04:22:42 +0800 <JUthergi> @TResistance7 @TKarmen7 Fact checking relayed immediately to the candidates so WTP can see either simple error or pathological intent!
1301615585860694017 2020-09-04 04:18:33 +0800 <JUthergi> mitch did it! he still sees no urgency to act on bipartisan bill to help WTP, sent to him in May 2020...
1301498938369945600 2020-09-03 20:35:02 +0800 <JUthergi> Just the next step in his ruler for life plan. While he preaches, barr sets legal precedent for emergency declaration on election fraud, trump declares results void, declares Martial Law against protestors and tells all he is chosen one to fix all.  We do not consent!
1301495164305920007 2020-09-03 20:20:02 +0800 <JUthergi> To date, trump has yet to call for a national moment of mourning for the loss of 180k+ beloved souls. Worse is that our elected elite has also failed in recognizing the pain they inflict upon us all with their corrupted daily bickering. Give us a chance to mourn!
1301305367683629059 2020-09-03 07:45:51 +0800 <JUthergi> Moments before this comment i thought he said we need to let the legal process and investigation work, then prejudices the investigation in his next breath?
1301303842596884482 2020-09-03 07:39:47 +0800 <JUthergi> Didn't jr pay the salon owners to setup pelazy?
1301303174561701893 2020-09-03 07:37:08 +0800 <JUthergi> Now I get it. Doh! Lumpy trumpy gets his followers to vote twice so he can claim election fraud, declare elections null/void and send in barr's beastly boys with guns to declare trumpy pres for life!  No worries folks, ivanka &amp; jr will take him out so they get their turn to rule.
1301301253599879171 2020-09-03 07:29:30 +0800 <JUthergi> @hopelikehell @Stoptheinsani20 Wolfie was just a wolf puppy again today.  Barr just as brazen and happy as he could be in dismantling OUR REPUBLIC!
1301296332850843652 2020-09-03 07:09:57 +0800 <JUthergi> Sounds like l'il lindsie has gotten another donation from his friends in the desert.  Any chance you'll donate some of that money to stop C19 explosion at USC?
1301271134248329216 2020-09-03 05:29:49 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump   You sure about the market, sir?
1301269897335496709 2020-09-03 05:24:54 +0800 <JUthergi> Why have no sens or congress people called for UN Observers? Barr is speaking right now on how to disrupt this election!!!  Speaks of foreign interference and vote fraud, laying groundwork for trump to disavow election results!!!
1301267089014042631 2020-09-03 05:13:45 +0800 <JUthergi> Are these all machines or just the ivanka patented/Chinese manufactured voting machines?
1301264000152416263 2020-09-03 05:01:28 +0800 <JUthergi> Really support the boycotting of corporate products because after higher voter turn out the second scariest thing the elected elite face is refusing to spend our money where they want us too.  Sure hope boycotting can show us our true power as consumers, enlightened consumers!
1301263109613662210 2020-09-03 04:57:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @RepSwalwell @sharnettereese1 @realDonaldTrump Well at least his loyal supporters will try it first!  After they become ill and cannot vote we can hope for a brighter future!
1301259751674830849 2020-09-03 04:44:35 +0800 <JUthergi> Yep! Real owners told huff post they didn't want to be associated with his photo op, and more! His handlers are off the rails too!
1301258383715168256 2020-09-03 04:39:09 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump You don't sound desperate at all, sir!  Do you think maybe it would be to your advantage to present plans to solve all these crises, instead of calling everyone and everything lies and hoaxes?   Just wondering cause I listen intently to you, but it's all so confusing!
1301257146429042691 2020-09-03 04:34:14 +0800 <JUthergi> Funny isn't it? No person ever will say the same thing about trump...
1301256476057534465 2020-09-03 04:31:34 +0800 <JUthergi> This guy needs to be at the debates! Should be a monitor?
1301254557318737924 2020-09-03 04:23:57 +0800 <JUthergi> GA, ALA, SC , sure are a lot of red states winning wi trump advice that his trump virus would just disappear...
1301251964400005120 2020-09-03 04:13:39 +0800 <JUthergi> Add to that, if one of the candidates goes off on some tangent or gets lost from topic, the monitors step in to restate the specifics of the topic.  Real time truth reports should be mandatory.
1301248631006265346 2020-09-03 04:00:24 +0800 <JUthergi> @DemocracyInn @realDonaldTrump  Please, sir! This winning will kill us all!  How will you manage pres for life if there is no left alive to praise you? Think about it.
1301246963397132291 2020-09-03 03:53:46 +0800 <JUthergi> jr jr jr again you project that which you fear people seeing in you. Rather than take a stand, your tweet speaks volumes of you &amp; your family's relationships wi epstein, his pimp, elite model agency guy, porn stars, etc.
1301242515010576385 2020-09-03 03:36:06 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump  He's just joking!  C'mon, since the birth of OUR REPUBLIC, no man in history has broken more laws, disrupted more order or shown such absolute disregard for moral ideals than donnie the destroyer!
1301241080009175046 2020-09-03 03:30:24 +0800 <JUthergi> trump claims that the environment is very important to him. He obviously wasn't referring to Earth's Environment.  donnie the destroyer strikes again!
1301239845679960066 2020-09-03 03:25:29 +0800 <JUthergi> It's all about tv! Why would anyone think it's about honesty and integrity?
1301235488494362624 2020-09-03 03:08:10 +0800 <JUthergi> Do you see what you've done with all your fear mongering?
1301234422730174464 2020-09-03 03:03:56 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump you got that right, sir. Those Russian boys are stoked! Fired up and ready to secure your reign forever!  PS WTP are quaking in our boots over your "leadership", and yes, many of us have to change our socks, every time you tweet...
1301136256605270016 2020-09-02 20:33:52 +0800 <JUthergi> Somebody must have told ol mitch that he is losing bid for re election, but if he wears a mask he'll look "patriotic".  After all the times we've seen these clowns ignore science to curry favor with trump it's the height of hypocrisy with every word he utters...
1301131398926028802 2020-09-02 20:14:34 +0800 <JUthergi> Quit trying to make yourself look relevant l'il lindsie, nobody wants to defund the police. So typical of you to distract from the problems to instill fear when you can't offer solutions. Just because you think you're a celebrity, (anything to be on tv), we don't.
1300886829705695232 2020-09-02 04:02:44 +0800 <JUthergi> @realDonaldTrump Good thing that you specified that my favorite president was you...never could have guessed that in my own.  Why not put this lie to rest. K
1300801634197438464 2020-09-01 22:24:11 +0800 <JUthergi> WTP all got your back and every brave souls that took the oath to defend us and this Republic! TY! Just ask and you will see the value of you that we all see...
1300800877641555968 2020-09-01 22:21:11 +0800 <JUthergi> Even more reason to walk that mail in ballot directly to your local election board the day you receive it!!!
1300795505585336320 2020-09-01 21:59:50 +0800 <JUthergi> Really hamhead? You know everybody wants to be like trump. Why attack this guy, just because he mimics trump at every campaign presser where someone asks for a truthful answer?  Looks like your low ratings are scaring you into truly mediocre entertainment.
1300794104641712135 2020-09-01 21:54:16 +0800 <JUthergi> Breaking news! Alien ship lands in florida! Humanoid figures pouring out all dressed in black, (no masks), carrying weapons and equipment, storm gop nursing homes! Did Biden send them?
1300792599259774978 2020-09-01 21:48:17 +0800 <JUthergi> Dear Kentucky Please, for the sake of this great Nation, elect this woman over the moscow asset that has bankrupted your state into a welfare state.  Proud Kentuckian people know what he has done.  Ask yourself this: would Daniel Boone have voted for mitch?
1300790791615455233 2020-09-01 21:41:06 +0800 <JUthergi> Just another step for this hitler wannabe. Waiting for the brown shirts wi trump logo to be 4sale on trump website.  Our complacency will kill us!
1300787833469382657 2020-09-01 21:29:21 +0800 <JUthergi> Every accusation trump makes against others has proven to be precisely that which he is doing behind the scenes, in the dark.
1300782304630054912 2020-09-01 21:07:23 +0800 <JUthergi> "Never did i ever", expect to hear something like this from someone in real life. To hear the pres say this with all sincerity is... Where the hell are all our superheroes needed to defeat the evil villains?
1300780350629650436 2020-09-01 20:59:37 +0800 <JUthergi> Note jr's statement on a "pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets", quite telling. Russia holds their investment and manages their investments with absolute control. The family greed / corruption and fear of losing their wealth forces subservience.
1300776393060614144 2020-09-01 20:43:54 +0800 <JUthergi> @Nick_Carmody @brianstelter TY Mr Carmody! People need to understand the plan in play. Hitler would have been proud at the efficiency of the fox trump team...
