1338148569837166593 2020-12-13 23:47:35 +0800 <just_mindy> And she is not regularly referred to as such in the media.  That’s my point
1338133484511047681 2020-12-13 22:47:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Love it
1338133430631096321 2020-12-13 22:47:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Exactly
1338133364239454210 2020-12-13 22:47:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @dizzheart She’s not a real Doctor
1338133283582992387 2020-12-13 22:46:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @La18ngden Wouldn’t doubt it

1338125007541690368 2020-12-13 22:13:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists @MeerkatYitz It’s no assumption at all.  She wrote a paper on “community college retention” to earn her Ed.D
1338124789328863232 2020-12-13 22:13:05 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said, she wrote a research paper.  In the midst of a pandemic when she insists on speaking out about matters of healthcare, it’s inappropriate to use her title as it misleads.  IE: Whoopi Goldberg thinking she was a medical doc
1338124298897281025 2020-12-13 22:11:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac It really is

1338120057906458626 2020-12-13 21:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> The same people who tell me Rand isn’t a real doc because he’s “only an eye doctor” (insane logic btw), and who would never call him Dr. Paul,  insist I call Jill Biden a Doctor because she can write a decent research paper.
1338119571694366731 2020-12-13 21:52:21 +0800 <just_mindy> That part.
1338112846681534466 2020-12-13 21:25:38 +0800 <just_mindy> This right here
1338111712218787842 2020-12-13 21:21:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @buelldawg Yes!!! I did the same
1338038425342144514 2020-12-13 16:29:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule Yes!!! So many young moms I know still getting up 2 or 3 times a night with 10 month olds. No mam.
1338036587284881409 2020-12-13 16:22:36 +0800 <just_mindy> This one thing saved my sanity. I woke up to every loud sigh from my baby.  My Gma said “Mindy, we never had monitors.  If you need to hear, you will”.  I took out the monitors and slept and was a decent human again.  Stop with these monitors.

1337948946463862786 2020-12-13 10:34:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy I agree
1337945380617674753 2020-12-13 10:20:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Ha!!! Doesn’t surprise me
1337945105760727043 2020-12-13 10:19:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I think most pro-life advocates would agree to end the death penalty tomorrow if we also ended abortion.  So, if that’s their big objection, let’s do it.

1337847804258099200 2020-12-13 03:52:27 +0800 <just_mindy> I’d also like to point out that 90% of journalists failed to follow the AP style guide this election cycle then as I only saw Jill Biden referred to as “Doctor”  cc: @JoeSilverman7
1337847449390608387 2020-12-13 03:51:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Using the term “scientist” for anyone engaged in study using the scientific method, is really insulting to professional researchers.  My first graders used to follow the “scientific method” when planting beans in milk cartons.  I hope your paper wouldn’t hv termed them experts.

1337802008796008449 2020-12-13 00:50:28 +0800 <just_mindy> The solution can only be rage against the machine.  Open the businesses.  Every one and then customers, all of us, must go patronize the businesses.  All at once. Dare the government to do something.  But Americans, all of us, have lost our nerve.  We’ve become too compliant.

1337773199292043264 2020-12-12 22:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Well, yes, that’s just a given.
1337772361098145794 2020-12-12 22:52:40 +0800 <just_mindy> WHO &amp; CDC have updated their guidance to state children under 5 should not be required to mask.  Why aren’t airlines adjusting their standards to comply with “science”?
1337770569958350854 2020-12-12 22:45:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Is that the first time we agree on something?
1337770379339771906 2020-12-12 22:44:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Probably more enjoyable for her if it’s just 3 pumps from him
1337770234904764417 2020-12-12 22:44:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa 3 pump chump  https://t.co/PutX1rXzJE
1337770084849373185 2020-12-12 22:43:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATLSAHM That thread was so thirsty, I needed water after reading it
1337769378721488896 2020-12-12 22:40:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrAmishMan Absolutely yes
1337768985065086976 2020-12-12 22:39:15 +0800 <just_mindy> If you’ve ever been a somewhat attractive woman in Florida, this is every over 50 married guy down here on a guy’s fishing trip &amp; desperately trying to get laid in the beach bar after 11 pm.
1337767938766606338 2020-12-12 22:35:05 +0800 <just_mindy> So dad is a 3 pump chump.  I guess we are just putting it all out there these days.
1337767661527310342 2020-12-12 22:33:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok gross.  We all know how babies are made.
1337767344035287042 2020-12-12 22:32:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty Or reruns of Honey Boo Boo
1337767029810606082 2020-12-12 22:31:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone tell Jacob Perry that even though he thinks “I am dumb and have an IQ of 45”, at least I didn’t buy into all of this.  Like he did.
1337766514200604672 2020-12-12 22:29:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 I like it

1337766357270732801 2020-12-12 22:28:48 +0800 <just_mindy> And finally, if you thought Hunter’s Daddy wasn’t aware of it all, frankly you are just the kind of mark people who run grift organizations like Lincoln Project are looking for, &amp; you should ask a friend to help you manage your money before you become a bigger victim.
1337765762262392833 2020-12-12 22:26:26 +0800 <just_mindy> And if you believed the Ukraine story was all there was and wasn’t just scratching the surface of the iniquity, maybe politics isn’t for you because you’re gut intuition is way off.
1337765466056642560 2020-12-12 22:25:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Reasonably intelligent people knew a guy who got kicked out military for cocaine, slept w/ his brother’s widow, cheated on her &amp; got a stripper prego was likely not making 60k a month in Ukraine for his wise counsel.  If you believed that, maybe you’re not reasonably intelligent
1337763601218670595 2020-12-12 22:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU It made me sad for him
1337753055861870594 2020-12-12 21:35:57 +0800 <just_mindy> And then leave your phone number on the bill.

1337618621800083456 2020-12-12 12:41:45 +0800 <just_mindy> “I don’t care at some level” as he goes on a multi-tweet tirade about Marco Rubio.  Bro, we all know you have micro peen.  Hide your crazy.  That’s what we do in the South.
1337618045674676226 2020-12-12 12:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> If y’all would have told me 10 years ago, a Pastor who leads a congregation could proclaim his support of abortion, and possibly win a Senate seat in GA, I would have laughed in your goofy face.  Yet, here we are.  IN GEORGIA, y’all.  Not Yankees. Georgia. I’m sick.
1337615474650177536 2020-12-12 12:29:15 +0800 <just_mindy> There should be an ad running in GA right now with Biden telling them to hush about Defund the Police until after the election.

1337605706657247237 2020-12-12 11:50:26 +0800 <just_mindy> The Lincoln Project’s next grift will be raising money to form this new Conservative party now that they shilled for Dems for 2 years

1337579218079784960 2020-12-12 10:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ An Apple Watch is good though
1337579079009185792 2020-12-12 10:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Amen
1337579031299055617 2020-12-12 10:04:26 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s almost as if people in NYC and Silicon Valley forget sitting and typing on laptops all day doesn’t build homes, grow food, maintain electrical lines, teach kids, deliver mail, put out fires, protect citizens, unclog toilets..you know other useful endeavors. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1337577696214310913 2020-12-12 09:59:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @LadyElinorD I just sent that tweet to mine and he replied “I don’t want to get beat senseless”.  🤣🤣
1337577416169025536 2020-12-12 09:58:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude He better be giving them to me only
1337576511235379202 2020-12-12 09:54:25 +0800 <just_mindy> There you go
1337576415957553152 2020-12-12 09:54:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @rggepi @hcraig0062_h @WPTV @tracybeanz That’s the truth
1337574233254277120 2020-12-12 09:45:22 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s fine.  Everyone is safe though.
1337573861416693761 2020-12-12 09:43:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Rewarding them for keeping that Hunter story hush hush
1337573493869862915 2020-12-12 09:42:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Grady protects the county where my son is a firefighter so I know he is always safe.
1337572382085615616 2020-12-12 09:38:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dan_Camm Probably true
1337572307989049346 2020-12-12 09:37:43 +0800 <just_mindy> The left really loves the idea of tattooing people, or branding people, or making them wear some identifier and that’s creepy.
1337571912650776578 2020-12-12 09:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> You mean a Christian plans to celebrate their most religious holiday next to Easter?  How could he?
1337571002906238977 2020-12-12 09:32:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You would find life much different without food
1337570871322533889 2020-12-12 09:32:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, Florida with its ports and offshore oil and fish and seafood and agriculture trade would wither in minutes.  I wonder if this much stupid hurts? 🙄
1337569210550149123 2020-12-12 09:25:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Lololol do you know where your food comes from
1337568938251710469 2020-12-12 09:24:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s do it
1337566907004841989 2020-12-12 09:16:16 +0800 <just_mindy> As Ariana says, “baby you might need a seatbelt when you ride” this narrative
1337566017241886720 2020-12-12 09:12:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bonespurs7 So is Ron
1337565961784872960 2020-12-12 09:12:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines Yes!
1337564234457243650 2020-12-12 09:05:38 +0800 <just_mindy> I love my Governor.  He protects the rights of citizens of Florida and won’t be cowered by inflammatory journalism
1337563770709827584 2020-12-12 09:03:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Hands down

1337537733825359875 2020-12-12 07:20:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Dear God

1337531772331036681 2020-12-12 06:56:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ I highly recommend it
1337530910082732037 2020-12-12 06:53:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude @RBPundit Clearly they have very low dining out standards
1337530744932093952 2020-12-12 06:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> More muted tonight but still dreamy  https://t.co/p41pz10LWO

1337518397739905025 2020-12-12 06:03:30 +0800 <just_mindy> If I wanted to reach young Miami Dade voters who are mostly Latino, you’d def be my first choice.  🙄  https://t.co/v3qth9ZxqU
1337514188177104896 2020-12-12 05:46:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Exactly
1337513176166961152 2020-12-12 05:42:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1337512917663707141 2020-12-12 05:41:44 +0800 <just_mindy> There is zero evidence shutting down “keeps us safe”
1337512811631677440 2020-12-12 05:41:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Did any of our politicians? Because they certainly aren’t following the advice of most medical professionals.
1337507524375883776 2020-12-12 05:20:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine @Machovell1an 🤢🤢

1337413129983193096 2020-12-11 23:05:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists @BrunusCutis No he looks like a man who doesn’t eat meat or 🐱
1337412933802921984 2020-12-11 23:04:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @BrunusCutis No that makes me want to puke
1337411823675592704 2020-12-11 23:00:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @BrunusCutis 1000%

1337367012608184320 2020-12-11 20:01:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @BrunusCutis No
1337366791396405248 2020-12-11 20:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/FkddJyiHbq
1337366161504219136 2020-12-11 19:58:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Her mom died giving birth so she had to be nursed by another dog mom until we took her.  https://t.co/143FCHYgjc
1337365100148248576 2020-12-11 19:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @noble150 Really stellar parenting happening here
1337363172131475456 2020-12-11 19:46:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Come back daily for tips on healthy non manipulative conversations with your teen.
1337363004653002752 2020-12-11 19:46:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Actual convo with my 14 year old last night (who btw has an awesome voice) Her: mom, do I have to sing at the Christmas party? Me: yes Her: argues for 10 minutes  Me: I housed you in my body for 39 weeks, you gave me stretch marks and I puked everyday.  You will sing &amp; like it
1337360359557095424 2020-12-11 19:35:31 +0800 <just_mindy> A 1600 week old fetus
1337358404239699969 2020-12-11 19:27:45 +0800 <just_mindy> And here’s my other question... Donna Shalala lost her election.  Why doesn’t her disclaimer say “Maria Salazar is the winner per....”.  Just asking for some consistency.  https://t.co/6XjBhSEDFH
1337357565164974080 2020-12-11 19:24:25 +0800 <just_mindy> And if this is their new policy, it best be across the board in 4 years if Biden loses reelection.
1337357229901623298 2020-12-11 19:23:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Has there been a cogent explanation from IG as to why they are now putting this Joe Biden disclaimer on LITRALLY anything @realDonaldTrump posts? This post was simply a Chanukah greeting and they added this disclaimer.  Trump is still POTUS until 1/21 no matter what.  https://t.co/YQ8P5sTyIw
1337356173004115971 2020-12-11 19:18:53 +0800 <just_mindy> They should start with y’all smothering the Biden story in October tbh

1337120726470565893 2020-12-11 03:43:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 I think it’s mostly about easy land division

Bro, it’s your fam and a photographer who usually isn’t near you.  There’s no need to justify that for your acceptability points.

1336475040095801344 2020-12-09 08:57:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Fun little gift.  If you hit @bathbodyworks yesterday for hand soap day or today for stocking stuffer day, @Target has these cute little bags for a buck. So for less than $5, teacher/voice coach/whomever gift.  https://t.co/5DlcfxIftM
1336474515216412675 2020-12-09 08:55:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Yujinesque Thank you!!
1336470841027141638 2020-12-09 08:40:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @GeorgeWept Thank you!!! 😍😍😍
1336470797116973057 2020-12-09 08:40:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @roads7682 That stinks!!!
1336094398535372800 2020-12-08 07:45:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @IsaacArshav @Bro_Pair The answer is no.  He is going to lie
1336094271892500480 2020-12-08 07:44:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bro_Pair Do you normally exploit the death of a beloved teacher to advance a false political narrative or just this time? He was no longer teaching in a physical classroom.  Also, you are contributing to the neglect of millions of kids with your attitude. Kids need to be in school.
1336069859453652999 2020-12-08 06:07:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Wake up, sheeple!  https://t.co/4pUD1ASuVL
1336065459288993794 2020-12-08 05:50:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @THERealWDLWife Exactly!!!
1336055509871431685 2020-12-08 05:10:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @yeahrightgirlhg I wonder this too, so I’m interested to see responses
1336051484228726788 2020-12-08 04:54:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Not really. IQ is also a prerequisite
1336048722992631808 2020-12-08 04:43:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree @SuperAndrea 🤗🤣🤣🤣
1336047211998797829 2020-12-08 04:37:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThePowersThatBe @karol Yep
1336047099960569856 2020-12-08 04:37:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @OCpatriot123 @SuperAndrea 🤣🤣 have to have some levity in the day
1336047010802184208 2020-12-08 04:36:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Patriot_Musket @SuperAndrea That’s Southern when you first wake up and are tired
1336045639604506629 2020-12-08 04:31:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobRichards57 Apparently
1336044728488521730 2020-12-08 04:27:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently the medical doctors who told him to wear a boot for weeks aren’t “science”
1336044521440817152 2020-12-08 04:26:51 +0800 <just_mindy> And he’s 78. No 78 year old has that kind of miraculous recovery
1336044237922725889 2020-12-08 04:25:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @RBPundit And Cuomo shilling his book?!
1336037056129200132 2020-12-08 03:57:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas Totally agree!!
1336029486828097536 2020-12-08 03:27:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @JanieBeachGirl I’m so glad to hear that
1336029391982387200 2020-12-08 03:26:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Absolutely
1336028912795660288 2020-12-08 03:24:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @winningatmylife I’m so heartbroken
1336028684608790530 2020-12-08 03:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Oh yes.  It is literally killing people
1336028534456918017 2020-12-08 03:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC I know.  4 people
1336028484381110276 2020-12-08 03:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @RebelRae13 It’s awful
1336027084557152256 2020-12-08 03:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m 45 years old so relatively young.  Since March, I’ve lost 4 classmates to drug or alcohol abuse.  3 men &amp; 1 woman.  Unbelievable what this constant COVID hysteria is doing to people’s mental well being.
1336019452341723141 2020-12-08 02:47:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Does Deniro or Pacino have nipple piercings?
1336018613686448132 2020-12-08 02:43:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine *reprehensible manner
1336018451480137731 2020-12-08 02:43:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine Teachers have behaved in a really reprehensible this whole pandemic
1336018260182114312 2020-12-08 02:42:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB @KenGardner11 @GPollowitz @BruceExotic @justin_hart I agree
1336018194511892480 2020-12-08 02:42:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @GPollowitz @KenGardner11 @BruceExotic @justin_hart I understand but she is a teacher and hasn’t missed a paycheck (just like me) and there are a lot of people who don’t have that luxury.  Yelling at people who want to make a living is a bad look
1336010382008315906 2020-12-08 02:11:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @KenGardner11 @GPollowitz @BruceExotic @justin_hart I know she could have kept driving like seemingly all the other vehicles were doing?
1336010128865304577 2020-12-08 02:10:11 +0800 <just_mindy> You have no idea how if here were acting and she could have kept driving and never acknowledged their existence
1336009914087563269 2020-12-08 02:09:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Not for nothing, but someone who loses it as this level should not be unsupervised around kids. I’m not kidding.  She’s unwell.
1336009124371439616 2020-12-08 02:06:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Let me preface this with “I’m a 5th generation Floridian who has grown up swimming in alligator infested lakes” and I have never been on an airboat &amp; it will remain that way, yet @bethanyshondark did it with 4 kids.  I have not recovered from this news.  #betterwomanthanme
1336004726874394626 2020-12-08 01:48:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha ❤️❤️❤️
1336003752390750208 2020-12-08 01:44:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I will take that all day and twice on Sunday.  https://t.co/j509JR5VhG
1335997599439073281 2020-12-08 01:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB @DeAngelisCorey Sounds fair to me.
1335987778950193152 2020-12-08 00:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @AtlantaJohnD Yes!! Love that!
1335913228447191041 2020-12-07 19:45:08 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/kG5f5imquc
1335800473828388864 2020-12-07 12:17:05 +0800 <just_mindy> All of this
1335783143727640576 2020-12-07 11:08:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdj6248 To you? Yes, I agree.
1335775126638440448 2020-12-07 10:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I think so too
1335764931287846914 2020-12-07 09:55:51 +0800 <just_mindy> People are also saying this isn’t Warnock’s church.  This certainly isn’t the pulpit today.  Does anyone know when this pic was taken?  https://t.co/GUmW55nGY9
1335764074987212801 2020-12-07 09:52:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Hating the military and cops isn’t a “religion”. Opposition to infanticide, like ACB, is actually a part of Christianity
1335763735298908161 2020-12-07 09:51:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the kind of nonsense I hate.  Clearly she isn’t there as a parishioner, she is on stage, at I’m sure, some event.  Parishioners don’t sit on stage and the front row isn’t on stage Charles.  Have you ever gone to church?
1335666216342577154 2020-12-07 03:23:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer Love those!!!
1335666161728577539 2020-12-07 03:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @k3rdann Always!

1335664602877734916 2020-12-07 03:17:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Yes! I refuse to live in one anymore
1335664537010401281 2020-12-07 03:16:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB Oh I like that!!
1335664469205250052 2020-12-07 03:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdrache @JHolmsted I do some practical stuff too
1335664415144861699 2020-12-07 03:16:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @roads7682 Clermont!
1335664375353528321 2020-12-07 03:16:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity That’s right
1335664306713669641 2020-12-07 03:16:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @JHolmsted Good idea!! I forget about them
1335664259255201796 2020-12-07 03:15:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @BlackCross5 Oh neat!!!! I will look!
1335656809206571011 2020-12-07 02:46:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Calm down
1335656669439733764 2020-12-07 02:45:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @roads7682 Thank you!!
1335656624925663232 2020-12-07 02:45:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Nahhhh I like giving them stuff
1335656533586305024 2020-12-07 02:45:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @roads7682 I know.  The stockings are the one fun thing
1335655984157618178 2020-12-07 02:42:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @roads7682 It’s so hard to find things now 😫
1335655891580940290 2020-12-07 02:42:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @josephcphillips 😍😍😍
1335655848245407747 2020-12-07 02:42:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Thankfully my oldest 3 are done with that
1335655771284135942 2020-12-07 02:42:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 Yes
1335655370778435589 2020-12-07 02:40:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @tfranco817 Definitely gas!
1335655081522442245 2020-12-07 02:39:21 +0800 <just_mindy> So far: cell phone chargers, face sheet masks, lip scrub, mascara, hair clips, fuzzy socks, rings, earrings, some mustache cream (for my son), cologne, lip balm
1335654656970788866 2020-12-07 02:37:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s crowdsource stocking ideas. My oldest is 30 &amp; youngest 14, &amp; they generally just want money now so I try to be creative with their stockings (yes my 30, 26 and 20 yr old kids get stockings, it’s fine).  What do you put in your teens &amp; 20’s stockings? Mine in next comment
1335654006765596673 2020-12-07 02:35:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas Oh yes!!

1335653879648751622 2020-12-07 02:34:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Choppy3030 @AnnieOakley17th Merry Christmas!
1335638826216284163 2020-12-07 01:34:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Absolutely
1335635416230268929 2020-12-07 01:21:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @texlovera @Gormogons Big yep!
1335635373611945986 2020-12-07 01:21:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @memes_range @BruceExotic It’s a money making proposition in Florida where HOA’s can take your house more easily than a bank
1335635069713739777 2020-12-07 01:19:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Legitimately my quandary 🥴🤣😘  https://t.co/zQt6XWAiGL

1335632702716907521 2020-12-07 01:10:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel That’s exactly right!!
1335632651735199744 2020-12-07 01:10:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @seb404 I really do make great banana bread.  I always make a girl and a boy loaf.  One with nuts and one without
1335632457207586816 2020-12-07 01:09:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Yep!
1335632374483259393 2020-12-07 01:09:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx Same
1335632108010807303 2020-12-07 01:08:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @seb404 It’s me
1335631780574015499 2020-12-07 01:06:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Yes.  You honor their sacrifice
1335630954459783177 2020-12-07 01:03:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @memes_range @BruceExotic The “board” isn’t really running the HOA anymore.  Property managers who line the pockets of attorneys are, and they receive additional funds when petty letters are sent out.  I’ve been on all sides of it.
1335630675857248256 2020-12-07 01:02:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @memes_range @BruceExotic There really is zero legitimate purpose that shouldn’t be taken care of with city taxes.  A neighborhood pool or tennis court can be handled as a co-op with residents who want that amenity.  Most HOA’s are now run by property managers who advise boards to sue &amp; be heavy handed
1335630082807881729 2020-12-07 01:00:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Person that doesn’t understand overpopulation and would rather deer starve to death or be hit by cars.
1335629732084375555 2020-12-07 00:58:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @RiceyCoops @TheMaverick21 Yes!! An entity that can take your home LITRALLY.  It’s insane
1335629635078467587 2020-12-07 00:58:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Like Orange.  I hope DeSantis smacks him down
1335626893144563723 2020-12-07 00:47:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @RiceyCoops @TheMaverick21 The worst

1335617227719143428 2020-12-07 00:08:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Ha!!  My boyfriend sent that to me last night.  Can confirm this is fake news

1335602321053667328 2020-12-06 23:09:42 +0800 <just_mindy> You notice this was voluntary and not compelled by the government
1335602079293976578 2020-12-06 23:08:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah Christians never feed or dress the poor.  You got us!   (Fact check: Catholic charities are the largest charities in the world by FAR, with other Christian charities also very high on the list:  see Samaritan’s Purse, etc)
1335449991142383616 2020-12-06 13:04:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 We are the saddest twins lol
1335449925178564609 2020-12-06 13:04:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Very well could be
1335449759612547074 2020-12-06 13:03:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx I think A is more utilitarian but both are great
1335448993892093952 2020-12-06 13:00:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @_CrotalusAtrox_ Yep.  Addiction ended my second. I def get it
1335448401220145153 2020-12-06 12:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @_CrotalusAtrox_ One of my exes would reconcile and the other hates me

1335447688410755072 2020-12-06 12:55:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Also true
1335447375276544000 2020-12-06 12:54:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Also the second.  I’m very bad at marriage is the tweet.
1335442847974236160 2020-12-06 12:36:00 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve said this like 20 times but I can get tested at like 6 places within 3 miles of me. In Florida.

1335398515271458817 2020-12-06 09:39:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Attila70260000 Nothing wrong with it but plenty of people have comments and emotions about it
1335394294673403911 2020-12-06 09:23:04 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend sent me a little note and it had 10 encouraging points on it.  I share this one because I think women are made to feel guilty or weird if they desire a relationship after divorce or the death of a spouse. Anyway, just in case someone needed to see it.  https://t.co/hAI9jDRiCb
1335391344655798278 2020-12-06 09:11:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @bayoukellyfish And we don’t need handouts from the government

1335390575940538370 2020-12-06 09:08:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Which is why we need to open the US
1335389942202109952 2020-12-06 09:05:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @rggepi I agree
1335389821599158273 2020-12-06 09:05:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Like I said, DeSantis is getting good press so he is doing this to try and ride his coattails as “the guy who will stand up to DeSantis”
1335385501826756609 2020-12-06 08:48:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Just realized they have an Orlando location near me. We will check it out since @ChefGruel has stood for the American small business!

1335382990948618241 2020-12-06 08:38:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Would love to hear @AnthonySabatini take on Jerry Demming’s latest threats.  I know he is attempting to go head to head with DeSantis to help his “wife” and her political career, but this is not ok.
1335382057950863360 2020-12-06 08:34:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Interesting they decided to start in downtown Winter Garden tonight, a mostly Republican area.  How Bizarre.  How bizarre.  How bizarre.
1335381327902871557 2020-12-06 08:31:33 +0800 <just_mindy> He could have stopped after qualified

1335319615711436801 2020-12-06 04:26:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @tchangel I am a teacher.  You’re preaching to the choir.  Firefighters work 48 hours a week and 72 the next and they aren’t paid overtime.  Fire school and EmT is a year, and then you have medic school for another year.
1335311299362893824 2020-12-06 03:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @coUzo4 @MarcACaputo So you have to commute.  Yes, I used to as well because I taught in a wealthy community.  Teachers are never going to live next door to millionaires.
1335310949243363336 2020-12-06 03:51:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Yes
1335308637963751434 2020-12-06 03:42:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Right. Apparently he didn’t dictator hard enough
1335308506963062786 2020-12-06 03:42:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Also Bingo
1335308172924432389 2020-12-06 03:40:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember when y’all scoffed when we said schools would reopen after the election.  🤣🤣 Pelosi &amp; Biden screwed all of American for their octogenarian political fantasies and y’all lap it up like Jeni’s ice cream
1335305907148877835 2020-12-06 03:31:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists The new one
1335304421924855811 2020-12-06 03:25:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 There are decent apartments available for couples who make 100k in miami.  Otherwise, my student’s families would all be homeless
1335304059151142912 2020-12-06 03:24:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet he still had a fraction of the nursing home deaths as Cuomo.
1335303586092371971 2020-12-06 03:22:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Ilhan Omar’s husband collected like 3 million.
1335303295192227841 2020-12-06 03:21:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m more often 10, but if it’s cold 5.  Women shouldn’t wear constricting bottoms to bed.  Messes up your ph. I taught my daughters that early.
1335302806648070148 2020-12-06 03:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @MWWilliams80 What a cutie!
1335302625563172864 2020-12-06 03:18:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @le_blah @MarcACaputo Bro.  Clearly many people are in need of my reading comprehension class. The announcement DeSantis was making is it all teachers must make a minimum of $50,000 per year. The original poster states he makes $50,000 and his wife makes $50,000. That’s $100,000

1335301182068305920 2020-12-06 03:13:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @Yahoo And at least it was toward the other kid and not the adult, but good on you for requiring exceptional behavior
1335300916774383619 2020-12-06 03:12:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @MonsieurUgarte I can barely do math which is why I’m a Reading Specialist but dang these people are worse than me
1335300110423629827 2020-12-06 03:08:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno Absolutely
1335299542208614400 2020-12-06 03:06:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @Yahoo Absolutely.  I would have been horrified if my son did that
1335299074262790145 2020-12-06 03:04:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @Yahoo That young man has serious problems.  I understand that heartbreak.  My son was pulled from a state final by an ump when he was pitching because he forgot to remove his gold chain.  It stunk but kids don’t get to behave like that.
1335297242522132480 2020-12-06 02:57:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Yep.  The trade off for no state income tax
1335295499318996997 2020-12-06 02:50:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I have 6 dogs and have never pulled any of their tails.  I’m weird, apparently
1335295128093782016 2020-12-06 02:49:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @sandsalamander I made 23k 😭😭😭
1335293987201163264 2020-12-06 02:44:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Also I now have 23 years in the system and make 59K so I have zero sympathy for starting teachers making 50K whining about it.
1335293531003510785 2020-12-06 02:42:41 +0800 <just_mindy> And by the way, this is my son’s choice.  I don’t think he deserves kudos.  It’s just the reality of public service starting salaries and why teachers in Fl should be grateful
1335293325818138632 2020-12-06 02:41:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 ❤️❤️
1335293266774941696 2020-12-06 02:41:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @jeffreylbragg Yeah.  50k will be a first year teacher so I was being conservative
1335293134318788608 2020-12-06 02:41:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @davidcmeyer It’s close to that here and we also get personal vacay days.
1335292906387763212 2020-12-06 02:40:12 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is a Firefighter|/EMT who could die any shift and works weekends and holidays and started at 40k in Florida so please cry more teachers making 50K at 21 years old and working 10 months a year.
1335292315057971201 2020-12-06 02:37:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @coUzo4 @MarcACaputo Lake Worth.  I’m quite aware of rental prices in Miami.  People have apartments that make less than 100k
1335292055258591232 2020-12-06 02:36:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I swear, people can’t read. Original poster - makes 50K His wife also a teacher - makes 50k That is 100K
1335291724915204112 2020-12-06 02:35:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I swear teachers are the worst &amp; I’m one.  DeSantis gets starting salaries in the top 5 IN THE NATION, we work 10 months a year, have decent healthcare, no state income tax and they still complain. We don’t miss holidays with our kids.  We work in AC.  Always aggrieved
1335290926403641353 2020-12-06 02:32:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 No, I’ve actually been a teacher in Fl who started making 23k in 1997 and appreciate a politician FINALLY addressing salaries and then people crap on it
1335290389021028352 2020-12-06 02:30:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @FuckDHSandICE Yeah no.  The new law states teachers have to start at 50K.  That’s the announcememet Desantis was making.
1335290093863653376 2020-12-06 02:29:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 And frankly he and his wife don’t work holidays or weekends and have lots of summer off and have great healthcare (just like me, also a public school teacher) so maybe he should realize his lower salary has lots of perks
1335289763918716931 2020-12-06 02:27:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 Because the Governor worked hard to get Fl salaries up in the top 5 in the nation and he replies “yeah let’s celebrate high salaries when my wife and I can’t afford a house”. So his personal issue means DeSantjs didn’t do good work on behalf of teachers?
1335289194139312134 2020-12-06 02:25:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @theamericanrd 100K is the minimum they would make.  New teachers have to make 50K in Fl
1335288991260807174 2020-12-06 02:24:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 They earn a minimum of 100k in Fl under this law. Teacher salary starts at 50K here by law.  If they have student debt, that has nothing to do with the salaries they are earning
1335288674314047493 2020-12-06 02:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ouachita77 Yes, all of that
1335288187837702147 2020-12-06 02:21:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @JayPSU @MarcACaputo The announcement being mocked mandates starting teacher salaries at 50K in Florida.  Thanks
1335288016902959104 2020-12-06 02:20:46 +0800 <just_mindy> 2 people teaching is a minimum of 100K
1335287879963205633 2020-12-06 02:20:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Smitty9215 @MarcACaputo People have apartments in Miami that make less than 100k a year.  Many of my students and their families for example.
1335287624026779649 2020-12-06 02:19:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @Smitty9215 @MarcACaputo I’m a public school teacher.  The new law mandates demands 50K starting for new teachers.  He said he and his wife both teach. 50 plus 50 means they make a minimum of 100k
1335287154193338370 2020-12-06 02:17:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ouachita77 I understand with how they’ve treated their elderly
1335286107622281216 2020-12-06 02:13:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all make 100k minimum and can’t afford an apartment in Miami? I mean, yeah not on the beach but.....

1335269755243081730 2020-12-06 01:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @GovRonDeSantis.  Please address.
1335269527630848001 2020-12-06 01:07:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Because the majority of our state doesn’t want @RonDeSantisFL to be a petty tyrant.  If you want that, move to NY or Cali.
1335268739365957632 2020-12-06 01:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> I worked my way through college in 1997, pal. Hershey bars were like $1.80.
1335245366690779141 2020-12-05 23:31:17 +0800 <just_mindy> The misogyny.  Explain how she is a moron, Nick.  Use facts are arguments rather than name calling.
1335245111916171273 2020-12-05 23:30:16 +0800 <just_mindy> We have fewer deaths and hospitalizations which actually matter.
1335244553062912002 2020-12-05 23:28:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @2021Labs @BenFischerSBJ She lives in NY.  Pretty sure she can find it on a map
1335244273445429248 2020-12-05 23:26:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @kagamine_taylor @NarwhalNico @NateSilver538 No he’s not. Infection rates are meaningless.  Hospital beds &amp; deaths matter.
1335244016582012928 2020-12-05 23:25:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Ppl in NYC claim it takes hours to get tested.  I can get tested right now at 6 different places in Fl within 3 miles.
1335243768480587778 2020-12-05 23:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Except for like 3 days this week, people in Fl run AC EVERY DAY all day long.  Not sure who told you we don’t use AC in Fl in November.  Mine is on right now.
1335127655243542528 2020-12-05 15:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Bye!!!
1335127567305732101 2020-12-05 15:43:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Or what? Like Matt or any other Floridian cares what the Gov of NJ thinks.  People leave NJ in droves to come to FL, not the other way around
1335086279663493121 2020-12-05 12:59:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you

1335065454692487170 2020-12-05 11:36:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @GMarctweets @mktldy10 @karol What actually matters is deaths and hospital beds.  Our deaths are lower than NY and our hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.  We are FULLY open.
1335065248760524802 2020-12-05 11:35:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @GMarctweets @mktldy10 @karol Number of cases is indicative of nothing.  People on Twitter complained before Tgiving of waiting hours for a test in NYC. I live in a rural Fl &amp; can get tested at 6 different places in a 5 mile radius.  Testing is easy here = more cases

1334969730965401605 2020-12-05 05:16:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1334927000721649664 2020-12-05 02:26:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @j_mt_ams I have no idea what can or will be proven but “it’s only fraud if you can prove it” isn’t an acceptable answer.  No matter the outcome of this election, things need to be investigated
1334925151717232640 2020-12-05 02:18:52 +0800 <just_mindy> The reason I know there was fraud is because Dems in my own county attempted ballot harvesting. They were just dumb enough to put their illegal activity on FB.  Other Dems apparently are slightly more capable.

1334726797452304384 2020-12-04 13:10:41 +0800 <just_mindy> She has this caricature of Republicans as people riding around passing Grey Poupon to each other.  My Dad came straight out of Appalachia &amp; worked in a grocery store at age 13 and put himself through college.  Calm down.
1334720458055356420 2020-12-04 12:45:29 +0800 <just_mindy> She didn’t have to be so damn loud.  Dang.  https://t.co/fPgD7Wtidp

1334638384086659078 2020-12-04 07:19:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas I hate that it isn’t what you want and I TOTALLY get wanting the blonde. I have to be blonde.  You look beautiful but I know that’s not the point when it isn’t what you want
1334635946818625540 2020-12-04 07:09:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Great thread!! Also a good time to send kudos to @Publix who hire people with DS to work in their stores and their presence makes the shopping experience even more of a pleasure.
1334635087904854017 2020-12-04 07:06:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Yes
1334635033265631237 2020-12-04 07:06:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrAmishMan Yes!!  The cognitive dissonance is staggering

1334634851211898882 2020-12-04 07:05:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC People are insane
1334630879923200002 2020-12-04 06:49:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan I have no idea
1334630794762080257 2020-12-04 06:49:12 +0800 <just_mindy> They are livid he won’t be a dictator and force them to comply and send cops after people who don’t obey.  What have we become as Americans? It’s nuts.
1334630588553322496 2020-12-04 06:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> After seeing people denigrate DeSantis for allowing Floridians to live free &amp; have personal choice, I get it.  Ppl go on the #DeathSantis hashtag and demand he force people to wear masks, shut down schools and businesses, &amp; force us all to our homes.  They are angry at him.
1334630036272541698 2020-12-04 06:46:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So if you spent a lot of time in Sunday School as a kid, you learned about the Israelites begging God for a king. It was such a hard idea to grasp.  Why would people want to be ruled over after experiencing freedom?! Why beg?!
1334629200284803072 2020-12-04 06:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @BJLoVerde Yup

1334620860750188544 2020-12-04 06:09:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 It’s cold in Fl.  I have gone in Walgreens and the gas station with no bra because of my puffy vest.  It’s freaking amazing.  The only good part of the cold.  I don’t have panties on under my leggings either because eff all restricting things

1334256905661915145 2020-12-03 06:03:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ I mean, what a ridiculous thing for him to weigh in on
1334256452219916293 2020-12-03 06:01:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell It’s pretty great!

1334242981008838656 2020-12-03 05:08:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell I literally live on a lake, I have an acre of land with a metal shop building, a nice kitchen with a great view, but I do need to upgrade to a king size bed.  That’s the view from my back porch  https://t.co/v15Tv2rchA
1334237251019091973 2020-12-03 04:45:24 +0800 <just_mindy> What if we, now hear me out, don’t judge how people fall in love &amp; what they determine to take on &amp; who they love. These things are deeply personal &amp; the heart wants what it wants.  Love &amp; intimacy surprises us all, sometimes.
1334236392927481856 2020-12-03 04:41:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @coryadair I’m not surprised, honestly.

1334227085699796992 2020-12-03 04:05:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG It makes me laugh. Particularly being told I have an IQ of 45 from a guy who can’t run a winning campaign

1334224998874157057 2020-12-03 03:56:43 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s Varad. You’re welcome from the girl with the IQ of 45 who just corrected your spelling so I’m not sure what that says about you.    cc: @varadmehta
1334224476138074124 2020-12-03 03:54:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Someone sent it to me.  I forgot all about it until I was cleaning out my DM’s today.  It’s the IQ of 45.  It makes me forgetful.

1334156666045149189 2020-12-02 23:25:11 +0800 <just_mindy> And children.  See @SethDillon thread yesterday about his experience with one confronting his child.
1334153631587766275 2020-12-02 23:13:07 +0800 <just_mindy> I RT’d a similar story from Canada and said “it will be here next”.  Welp, it’s here.  No surprise Cuomo is in charge.
1334145032878698496 2020-12-02 22:38:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Clearly he hasn’t looked at the tweets of some Dem Senators 🙄
1334144874715746306 2020-12-02 22:38:20 +0800 <just_mindy> New York has already chosen.  The rest of us still can do better.

1333905667413995520 2020-12-02 06:47:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah really shocking
1333904952587063305 2020-12-02 06:44:58 +0800 <just_mindy> After listening to @RuthlessPodcast today, it is my belief, the minions should be holding candles and singing outside of @ComfortablySmug home.  The vigil of the minions is his only hope.  https://t.co/WVdXJPlVau

1333894633110298625 2020-12-02 06:03:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @grsvt81 We’ve already seen online learning doesn’t work for many families.  We’ve seen schools aren’t dangerous when opened.  If teachers are over 65 or ill, they should be offered a virtual option
1333893607959523329 2020-12-02 05:59:53 +0800 <just_mindy> All of the people in this thread complaining are welcome to move
1333893367588134912 2020-12-02 05:58:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Cases are a meaningless metric.  Our hospitals are fine &amp; our death percentage is stable.
1333893183311253505 2020-12-02 05:58:12 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why Florida is open, our kids are being educated, our businesses are operating, our citizens aren’t losing their livelihoods, &amp; are hospitals aren’t overrun.  Thanks, guys!!
1333892752992591874 2020-12-02 05:56:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Go back to NYC.  Then you can be under the rule of the amazing Cuomo.  I’ll help you pack.
1333891122041643008 2020-12-02 05:50:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @THERealWDLWife @GovRonDeSantis Ha!!!
1333890595216125953 2020-12-02 05:47:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @Crapplefratz @TheAmishDude @BruceExotic As am I
1333890368098721794 2020-12-02 05:47:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida is the best
1333889987931234304 2020-12-02 05:45:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m 65.  I want my social security
1333889826924486657 2020-12-02 05:44:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude @BruceExotic Yep
1333888068428959745 2020-12-02 05:37:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @Gormogons That was enough for me
1333884886973812739 2020-12-02 05:25:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Amen. A 20 year old man tries to correct my 4 year old.   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 He will be embarrassed
1333884628642525188 2020-12-02 05:24:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @BassettoDi It’s ridiculous
1333884525114494976 2020-12-02 05:23:47 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s terribly ableist.  People who are blind or visually impaired can’t see pictures and depend on NEWSPAPERS TO TELL THE STORY WITH YOU KNOW, WORDS!
1333884085962502157 2020-12-02 05:22:03 +0800 <just_mindy> And no one would know who you were talking about but ok

1333881722463789058 2020-12-02 05:12:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I had zero idea who this person was until someone said Juno so...

1333265502345551873 2020-11-30 12:24:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @logiccounselor I did mine at 21 because of the stones.  I’m super fastidious with oral health because my mom worked for a dentist but I couldn’t stop the bad breath from the stones. My first husband said we had to do something.  Never another issue since.
1333264901771587584 2020-11-30 12:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 Yes.  At 21.  It sucked for a week but so glad I did it.

1333264530114220033 2020-11-30 12:20:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Easycure That’s a great encouragement
1333264462116163584 2020-11-30 12:19:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmrz60 And y’all are the cutest!!!!! I didn’t know that!!!
1333263661918547969 2020-11-30 12:16:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Ha!!  That too
1333263606599790594 2020-11-30 12:16:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @DaGhostOfRichie Yep.  For a mother too.  I’m so sorry you are going through this, friend.
1333263150226022400 2020-11-30 12:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @sandsalamander Ha!!! Same!
1333263101974769664 2020-11-30 12:14:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity What is meant for me will come.
1333261504389533696 2020-11-30 12:08:08 +0800 <just_mindy> But what I’m not fixing to do is cry because these eyelashes cost too much for me to wash them away and look like one of those skinless cats
1333260929811746818 2020-11-30 12:05:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Ha!!!  Apparently it’s not that hard!
1333260811372998656 2020-11-30 12:05:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq I hate that he lost his first wife, but so glad he found happiness again.  Thank you for sharing that
1333260444195229696 2020-11-30 12:03:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Yep.  Let’s not do that.  Just be honest and not waste each other’s time.
1333260183246688256 2020-11-30 12:02:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Tazatator I love that!!
1333260112903933953 2020-11-30 12:02:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth @Ruggable Oh I don’t want meh for all that money!!!
1333258542107734017 2020-11-30 11:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, can we normalize just being honest and open and not beating around the bush if a dating relationship is no longer serving you? I would rather just get the truth. Don’t try &amp; spare my feelings. Don’t be mean in hopes the other person just gets the hint. Just end it.
1333257661022949376 2020-11-30 11:52:51 +0800 <just_mindy> If you have lost all hope in finding love after 40, this encouraged me tonight. Sweet people. ❤️❤️
1333257497755443200 2020-11-30 11:52:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @purpleowl23 @kelseyhuse30 Weren’t they the cutest
1333240376065470464 2020-11-30 10:44:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @okmaher @Ruggable I’m so on the fence!! They look amazing!!
1333234857103724544 2020-11-30 10:22:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @kelseyhuse30 This couple gave me hope today  https://t.co/rEVlLM1OXF
1333228061337284609 2020-11-30 09:55:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @aurora_g96 I’m a total loser of all things and so far I haven’t lost them.  My 14 year old has had hers for a year and hasn’t.  One good thing is they can be put on your find my device on your IPhone.
1333226239558094849 2020-11-30 09:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep! A king size bed is also on my list
1333226133240901634 2020-11-30 09:47:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Get the Air Pods. Love mine
1333226012528832512 2020-11-30 09:47:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I have already thought this through.  🤣🤣 1. Dyson AirWrap 2. @Ruggable - scan my TL. I discussed this earlier. 3. Bath &amp; Body Twisted Peppermint anything  4. New Make Up bag 5. My accent wall in my master bedroom done
1333221952836792324 2020-11-30 09:30:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought the same
1333207491363090432 2020-11-30 08:33:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh good. The 25 states that went for Trump will all go our merry way.  Good luck with that whole eating and natural resources thing though.
1333206301699137542 2020-11-30 08:28:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @MadridFederer It is
1333206018340294658 2020-11-30 08:27:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v They know they won’t be in the cool club if they challenge Dems now
1333205446275035136 2020-11-30 08:25:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @MadridFederer 🤣🤣
1333205079801946113 2020-11-30 08:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s so goofy
1333204577257213957 2020-11-30 08:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v She and Harf were complete idiots.  As always, Dems fail up
1333198444324859905 2020-11-30 07:57:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @davidcmeyer Yep
1333195186671935490 2020-11-30 07:44:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 Ha!!
1333195163783585794 2020-11-30 07:44:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @OrneryThe8th @JeffJoh41591476 Like most women lol
1333193348706865153 2020-11-30 07:37:18 +0800 <just_mindy> One of the Pod Saves bros
1333175546709225472 2020-11-30 06:26:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love I hope not
1333175468619657220 2020-11-30 06:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember Psaki was responsible for this campaign that totally changed Russia’s mind about Ukraine.  https://t.co/6CPTYpewb3
1333174539551969281 2020-11-30 06:22:34 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s already been in the WH with Obama.  Everyone knows how to say her name, doofus
1333174302947094536 2020-11-30 06:21:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Psaki was embarrassing during Obama.  Yuck to having to see her again.
1333170935331921920 2020-11-30 06:08:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden literally didn’t answer one question of any substance the whole campaign but ok
1333170715768582148 2020-11-30 06:07:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  The media was so fair and their coverage so glowing in regards to Trump 🙄
1333166753409605633 2020-11-30 05:51:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @KinCali1 @bccover @Ruggable I know!  I’ve been so tempted and I’m glad to hear all these great reviews
1333166544583598082 2020-11-30 05:50:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude @thefactualprep Exactly
1333166186629099520 2020-11-30 05:49:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Because he’s old and feeble and not very lucid and for some reason, the press pool chose to ignore this the whole campaign.
1333165135645601793 2020-11-30 05:45:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @bccover @Ruggable Thanks for the tip!!  I think I’m going to order one!
1333162262597603332 2020-11-30 05:33:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock She’s throwing banana peels in his path!
1333162164283174913 2020-11-30 05:33:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @josephcphillips They aren’t even trying to hide it
1333162093047144449 2020-11-30 05:33:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez You’re welcome
1333161764561838082 2020-11-30 05:31:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought Biden was 76.  He’s 78.
1333161143980986370 2020-11-30 05:29:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @JeffJoh41591476 I am beginning to wonder
1333161045960110097 2020-11-30 05:28:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @TagSherman You know anytime a very old man has an orthopedic issue, it leads to decline
1333160884085149703 2020-11-30 05:28:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez  https://t.co/EMNDhJQxt8
1333159581984444420 2020-11-30 05:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought they would at least wait until Biden was sworn in to start laying the groundwork for “his health has declined &amp; he is stepping down”.
1333159260801347587 2020-11-30 05:21:51 +0800 <just_mindy> This
1333158465867575297 2020-11-30 05:18:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom Yup
1333158387270479874 2020-11-30 05:18:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala will be President sooner than we imagined
1333155263113781252 2020-11-30 05:05:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth @Ruggable Awesome!!  I will check it out
1333154339213500420 2020-11-30 05:02:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth @Ruggable Is that a cleaner?
1333154269042765830 2020-11-30 05:02:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @ZacBissonnette @bethanyshondark This hospital chain has 21 hospitals and a total of 49 ICU patients with COVID.  That’s like 2 per hospital.  This reporting is ridiculous
1333153232651169795 2020-11-30 04:57:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel @Ruggable Just got another thumbs up testimonial!
1333153125386121222 2020-11-30 04:57:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @bccover @Ruggable Awesome!! I’m so excited because I wanted a big rug but the dogs made it impossible until I saw this option!!
1333152764545953794 2020-11-30 04:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This is what I mean. This article has been debunked but people still believe it
1333152479211642887 2020-11-30 04:54:54 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, data has shown 30 year old people rarely get in “critical condition” from COVID. A total of 12 people in their thirties have died from COVID in all of VA for example.
1333151833397858305 2020-11-30 04:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe, just maybe, anytime a 30 year old gets sick from anything, they usually ignore it because young.  Duh.
1333150963331379200 2020-11-30 04:48:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @bethanyshondark Her data makes me incredulous as well
1333150705167851520 2020-11-30 04:47:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude But her thread was talking about 30 year olds.
1333150601782419466 2020-11-30 04:47:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel @Ruggable So far, one person answered they love theirs!!!
1333150462216982528 2020-11-30 04:46:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy She said she worked with @BalladHealth.  They have 21 hospitals in Va and TN &amp; currently have 49 total COVId patients in ICU.  I’m confused about how staff is seeing multiple dead people a day
1333150171329421315 2020-11-30 04:45:44 +0800 <just_mindy> This hospital chain has 21 hospitals &amp; just reported they have 49 people TOTAL in iCU for Covid.  That’s like 2 people a hospital.  How are they seeing multiple dead a day?
1333148659282825217 2020-11-30 04:39:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Would love to know where in Appalachia they are seeing multiple deaths a day in a hospital.  This feels like that other story where it was revealed there had been a total of 8 deaths in the whole town in months.
1333147939536056324 2020-11-30 04:36:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I learned about @Ruggable on Tik Tok, per all other things in my life.  https://t.co/LaX0aDqGAg
1333146796340768777 2020-11-30 04:32:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @lhcamp @Ruggable Ok!!!  That’s awesome to hear!!!  Thank you so much!! It looks great!
1333145706350186497 2020-11-30 04:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, I’m considering this one.  My house is very cottage boho vibe in case you want to comment on that as well.  https://t.co/D0iJ7iSFh1
1333145524808069125 2020-11-30 04:27:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @KurMudGin Too fast!!
1333145293832003597 2020-11-30 04:26:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Have any of my Tweeps (particularly pet owners) purchased a rug from @Ruggable? My doxies have occasional accidents so I have no large rugs and it seems like such an awesome option to be able to remove the top layer &amp; wash.  Do they wash up well? Do you like?
1333144150498271234 2020-11-30 04:21:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 Don’t blink!!
1333143340800483333 2020-11-30 04:18:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 Time flies
1333142937304264705 2020-11-30 04:16:59 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughter and her bestie Bella over the last 11 years 😭  https://t.co/M4LcYavblT
1333142786128875529 2020-11-30 04:16:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @tolin43959 I know.  Very sad
1333126065036939269 2020-11-30 03:09:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @josephcphillips @MatthewOlmstead I love it!!
1333124038378524672 2020-11-30 03:01:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @MatthewOlmstead Too
1333124026902982664 2020-11-30 03:01:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @MatthewOlmstead Awesome!!!! Thank you!!!! My son would want his department tok
1333123942123413509 2020-11-30 03:01:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @Rookie_San I know it must be hard
1333121851502026756 2020-11-30 02:53:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @MatthewOlmstead Did you make or order?
1333121188839755777 2020-11-30 02:50:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @MatthewOlmstead Omg!!!! I’m showing my son
1333121120623538178 2020-11-30 02:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @MatthewOlmstead Love!!
1333121023932239872 2020-11-30 02:49:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD You can carve the foam with that 😂😂
1333113685431242753 2020-11-30 02:20:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all make fun of me for Tik Tok, but his is crazy cool.  I mean, if I hadn’t lost all my guns in that terrible boating accident.  https://t.co/UWjKz54VkV
1333098938711371777 2020-11-30 01:22:09 +0800 <just_mindy> As usual, everyone made fun of Rand as some kook, although he’s an actual doctor (unlike Jill Biden), and one again, Rand was right.
1333097960243081217 2020-11-30 01:18:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Ridiculous
1333097810271612928 2020-11-30 01:17:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @bfwebster @JoeSilverman7 Yes. My now 30 year old step daughter drove me crazy from 16-19. At 20, she regained her sanity
1333093512385077249 2020-11-30 01:00:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Dear God.  Do I understand.  Mine literally calls my bf and says “he’s the only one who can talk any sense into you”
1333092692910366720 2020-11-30 00:57:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @HonkyTonkJew @JoeSilverman7 Same girl, but I can diagnose a reading disorder.  Does that help?!
1332929776420581377 2020-11-29 14:09:57 +0800 <just_mindy> At least once a week, we turn around and go back because I can’t remember if I unplugged the straightener.  https://t.co/z8DIoNRcQd
1332903635362181121 2020-11-29 12:26:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenjhall Right!! Lay low!!
1332897891694891008 2020-11-29 12:03:16 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s his handler
1332897006654812160 2020-11-29 11:59:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Clemson lost when they didn’t have Trevor.  I like him a lot but I don’t see them beating Alabama
1332894906969415680 2020-11-29 11:51:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenjhall Yes!! I saw one who used cash but she used her customer appreciation guard number.  Are you kidding me?!
1332892977409257472 2020-11-29 11:43:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenjhall More good advice!!
1332892889081319425 2020-11-29 11:43:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 Don’t play with me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1332892823054643200 2020-11-29 11:43:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @jer2911tx Thanks!! I’ll check them out!!
1332892746391166981 2020-11-29 11:42:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 I have a boat and I live on the edge of the green swamp full of gators
1332891161736974336 2020-11-29 11:36:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 Yep. Do it yourself
1332888611814043650 2020-11-29 11:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 You just have to hope you cover your tracks long enough that they tape over themselves after 48 hours or 7 days
1332888450677297153 2020-11-29 11:25:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @caeser_pounce Yes!!! Toll booths mess folks up
1332888375695695872 2020-11-29 11:25:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 It will be a battle.  I’m friends with Forsythe’s Dad (OL) and Trask’s GF is the daughter of my friend who passed away from breast cancer in her 30’s.  So for personal reasons I want them to excel.
1332887187239694337 2020-11-29 11:20:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 My BF is a Bama fan so I hear this all the time and like I told him, Bama will likely win this year.  It’s just the game everyone is waiting on.
1332886887162372096 2020-11-29 11:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Don’t take your cell phone with you.  Don’t go through any toll booths.  Antifreeze tastes like Gatorade is pretty effective. Throw out the bottle and receipts when done.  Also the glass you used.  Have a burner phone for your side piece.  Look nothing up on the home computer.
1332885755417473024 2020-11-29 11:15:02 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to fast forward to the UF vs Alabama game.  That’s what everyone is waiting for and how the Heisman will be decided.
1332885016955777029 2020-11-29 11:12:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like when UF beats FSU

1332864382620102658 2020-11-29 09:50:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Women need to communicate what works and doesn’t and that generally only happens when there is enough relationship to support that vulnerability.  Monogamous sex can be very fun. I know that’s not the general opinion, but 🤷🏼‍♀️

1332371072910553089 2020-11-28 01:09:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @SharkSandwhich Exactly
1332366725241856003 2020-11-28 00:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir It is
1332365925102784514 2020-11-28 00:49:25 +0800 <just_mindy> My Dad just finished chemo &amp; I am now helping my son’s Aunt through chemo. Both have to have COVID tests before they take their chemo treatment each week.  We live in Florida.
1332363168904048640 2020-11-28 00:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @ams_willis I agree
1332360544804810757 2020-11-28 00:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Walmart, Target, etc have all thrived during this pandemic.  They don’t need your money.  Your local store does.  Desperately.
1332360149462360065 2020-11-28 00:26:28 +0800 <just_mindy> For me? Sweet Nothings Marketplace in Mascotte, Fl.  They don’t Twitter but they do FB so I’ll hype them there.  I will buy ornaments for our work ornament exchange.
1332359874299224068 2020-11-28 00:25:22 +0800 <just_mindy> We all know Small Business has been hit hard by quarantine. To some that is a bug, others of us feel maybe that’s a bit intentional. To combat that, use your dolla dolla bills baby. Think of 1 small business you can shop with this weekend. Then, hype that store on social media.
1332357120277291010 2020-11-28 00:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Sounds that way

1332355575213137920 2020-11-28 00:08:17 +0800 <just_mindy> This is accurate. It’s like the time my boyfriend asked if I had a winter coat.  TF are you talking about sir.  I have winter bathing suits (1 pieces).  I don’t have “coats”.  https://t.co/cPba1a28Ml
1332354002663731206 2020-11-28 00:02:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp Thank you!!!  I hope your day was great!!

1331985083650158593 2020-11-26 23:36:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Even if you don’t read it to your family, read it yourself.  What a blessing.
1331984947813478400 2020-11-26 23:35:33 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my favorite follows on FB (Monique McClean) is reading the original Thanksgiving Day Proclamation to her family today, and now more than ever, these words are so important. I’m going to read it to mine today as well.  https://t.co/Nzmai2u9Zc
1331983136532652033 2020-11-26 23:28:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear If it requires Reading, I still win though 😝🤣

1331981467354849281 2020-11-26 23:21:43 +0800 <just_mindy> People do understand that the supreme court ruling does not require them to go to church, correct? You can still stay home if you want.
1331981094309203968 2020-11-26 23:20:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB @RBPundit I am beginning to wonder

1331980911752196097 2020-11-26 23:19:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Since I have a M.Ed in Reading, apparently I can tell y’all what anything that requires reading says, and you can’t argue with me. #whoknew

1331973701189898240 2020-11-26 22:50:51 +0800 <just_mindy> To all the big mads about the Supreme Court decision, welcome to America where what you think of anyone’s religion doesn’t matter and we all get to worship or not how we choose.  Literally, why our nation was founded.  If you don’t like that, maybe try another country?
1331972990939041793 2020-11-26 22:48:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dale38651586 Clearly
1331972743307407360 2020-11-26 22:47:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Also Happy Thanksgiving to @RonDeSantisFL @govkristinoem because they are not only ridiculously attractive Governors, but they also love freedom.
1331972360719790081 2020-11-26 22:45:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Now that DeSantis has a fully open state and things have remained stable, you never hear his name in the Media.
1331971938315628546 2020-11-26 22:43:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Because they allowed religious gatherings? Weird take.

1331662164755685377 2020-11-26 02:12:55 +0800 <just_mindy> How many times can Saban get COVID?
1331660878190669828 2020-11-26 02:07:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins @breakfastclubam Yes!
1331660801007030282 2020-11-26 02:07:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @ShawnSloan70 Maybe then we would win a game
1331660235665240070 2020-11-26 02:05:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Look, the man that is in love with me is effusive in his praise and adoration, and we make out, and he still doesn’t have this level of adoration for me.
1331658078551420928 2020-11-26 01:56:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @ShawnSloan70 As a Jags fan, I feel your pain
1331657843905323011 2020-11-26 01:55:45 +0800 <just_mindy> If it takes 660 days for an elephant to walk across America, how long will it take to do 330 million vaccinations twice?  https://t.co/2onfYz2zQc
1331657210485731330 2020-11-26 01:53:14 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the stupidest analogy I may have ever heard and I used to teach analogies to fifth graders
1331656784789057538 2020-11-26 01:51:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m @pipandbaby I have to do corn casserole and green bean casserole today.  I’ll mix them up so they only have to go into oven in the morning
1331656335864291329 2020-11-26 01:49:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets Exactly
1331656257896390659 2020-11-26 01:49:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity @breakfastclubam They are unable to see a different perspective is ok and I don’t have to hate the other side
1331655720681566212 2020-11-26 01:47:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude A thick smarmy layer
1331655649520988160 2020-11-26 01:47:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets Oh yes.  And Latinos and Jews
1331655357538725895 2020-11-26 01:45:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1331655280149532675 2020-11-26 01:45:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m @pipandbaby Which I should be doing but procrastinating
1331654993997393925 2020-11-26 01:44:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Pierce your nipples.
1331654761351950346 2020-11-26 01:43:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Once again for those slow on the uptake, Obama’s remarks on Evangelical Hispanics today on @breakfastclubam are (say it with me) “exemplar 23678 of why we got Trump”. He is divisive &amp; nasty, and Trump was the divisive &amp; nasty conservative answer.
1331653867575144454 2020-11-26 01:39:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @ModericO Totally

1331647587234029568 2020-11-26 01:15:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU He’s so arrogant, he doesn’t care
1331647502198706177 2020-11-26 01:14:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @2Cookies4All @AF632 I know.
1331645879846047747 2020-11-26 01:08:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Many of the Cubans and Venezuelans who voted for Trump are Catholic so it’s interesting Obama singles out Evangelicals only.
1331645527126110208 2020-11-26 01:06:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I also give gift giving ideas  https://t.co/QCIRqu7YAv

1331575780116209665 2020-11-25 20:29:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @tillqi Basically, yes 😝
1331575716639596544 2020-11-25 20:29:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Oh my!!  You were the Alex Keaton.
1331573980403290118 2020-11-25 20:22:31 +0800 <just_mindy> My whole family is Republican so the only fight might be how many ways the Democrats cheated
1331573584217731074 2020-11-25 20:20:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Oh really?  Interesting
1331573523291181058 2020-11-25 20:20:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bearcat50 Depends on who is cooking!
1331573435647070209 2020-11-25 20:20:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists It seems to me it is
1331573072370028546 2020-11-25 20:18:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Or she funneled like 3 million dollars to her lover, wrecked his marriage, and went on frequent anti-Semitic rants. Either one.
1331571458888359943 2020-11-25 20:12:29 +0800 <just_mindy> That would make me suicidal
1331570775267086338 2020-11-25 20:09:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1331570027271741440 2020-11-25 20:06:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I see lots of Joe Exotic answers but his crimes weren’t federal, were they?

1331566431562035201 2020-11-25 19:52:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy I agree
1331566368702025729 2020-11-25 19:52:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Makes total sense
1331566322002616320 2020-11-25 19:52:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @ShawnSloan70 Very badly
1331566283096256515 2020-11-25 19:51:55 +0800 <just_mindy> I try to remember to say this every year, but as a Mom of a firefighter, please unplug Christmas tree lights at bedtime and ALWAYS ALWAYS sleep with all bedroom doors shut. I was stunned when I learned how that one step can save your family in a house fire.  #closebeforeyoudoze
1331562158484807683 2020-11-25 19:35:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle I know no other way

1331561839294099456 2020-11-25 19:34:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Marmalade402 Amen
1331499180548907019 2020-11-25 15:25:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Why is every leftist bitter and estranged from their family?
1331498978635116545 2020-11-25 15:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Some families know how to cook, and enjoy spending time together.  I’m sorry you seem to be descended from humorless trolls who also were terrible cooks, but please work that out in your own therapy sessions and allow the rest of us some joy.
1331498470293835779 2020-11-25 15:22:28 +0800 <just_mindy> This person has never had my dressing.  Or any good dressing apparently

1331307281359769602 2020-11-25 02:42:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @gonolesglp Yes, it’s more like Southern or at least swampy southern places
1331307191215775745 2020-11-25 02:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 I’ve never had rabbit
1331306286571466759 2020-11-25 02:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m 32 so clearly I’m a Texan 😝
1331305897822482439 2020-11-25 02:37:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy For sure!
1331305852083597312 2020-11-25 02:37:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_Hicks_303 I don’t either
1331305796286734337 2020-11-25 02:36:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @jamiemoulthrop I just have to imagine all these old Obama and even more establishment picks wasn’t what they expected

1331305513779388420 2020-11-25 02:35:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @ljsheeley3 @xavierdreyman That’s right!
1331305427951300616 2020-11-25 02:35:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @SwoverH Exactly
1331303790008479750 2020-11-25 02:28:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. Also, I have a daddy so no DM’s necessary.
1331303289535819776 2020-11-25 02:26:53 +0800 <just_mindy> So Biden played the Bernie/Warren contingency like fiddles for their voters and hung them out to dry or am I missing something?!
1331302084805877763 2020-11-25 02:22:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @ljsheeley3 Us either in Fl

1331301195860877312 2020-11-25 02:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> This guy is from KY, my second favorite state, and is my hero.  https://t.co/tJ0NeZrZuR
1331299068417613827 2020-11-25 02:10:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Who is we? We have been open in Fl since August
1331298860036202497 2020-11-25 02:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Thread 🧵
1331298639570997248 2020-11-25 02:08:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Thank you!!
1331298160292081676 2020-11-25 02:06:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Death rate is now 1.9%
1331297255400345604 2020-11-25 02:02:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida has been open since August.  Amazingly teachers show up to teach when they realize they won’t get a paycheck otherwise
1331296907377971202 2020-11-25 02:01:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @AliOnCities971 I’m so sorry.  My 14 year old declined significantly in the time home.  She is herself again after our schools reopened.  This is so unfair.
1331296496973705216 2020-11-25 01:59:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @HypocriteH8err Exactly
1331296363473211392 2020-11-25 01:59:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1331295758436462594 2020-11-25 01:56:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 Thank goodness!!
1331295055227858948 2020-11-25 01:54:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x What would you suggest they do they aren’t doing? Biden’s team also has no new suggestions.  It’s a virus.
1331294836373262339 2020-11-25 01:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Our school sends a recording if there has been a case
1331294736011980800 2020-11-25 01:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @VeritasAntequam Since we have seen kids aren’t great vectors of disease, probably not many. A single mom with a 6 yr old needs her kid in school. It’s way more risky for her to not have an option for her child
1331294410215133187 2020-11-25 01:51:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yep
1331294366326018049 2020-11-25 01:51:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x You do know a radiologist and a psychologist are completely different things? A radiologist is an actual MD
1331294161614614529 2020-11-25 01:50:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Are we equating a radiologist with a psychologist? Please.
1331293981075005442 2020-11-25 01:49:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @bbanck Always does
1331293929812205576 2020-11-25 01:49:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly!!!
1331293848186839041 2020-11-25 01:49:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude It is a beautiful thing
1331293724626784257 2020-11-25 01:48:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok?! And. A kid caught a virus. They likely will be asymptomatic.
1331293517524643841 2020-11-25 01:48:03 +0800 <just_mindy> You know who else cares about their kids?Police, firefighters, Nurses, Doctors, Grocery workers, truck drivers, sanitation workers, linemen, mailmen, retail workers, people who work at Disney, child care workers..but they are all going to work.  Teachers aren’t a protected class
1331292321447546886 2020-11-25 01:43:18 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re a psychologist. You understand zip about virus spread.  And as a psychologist, you should know mental health in children is at a crisis level
1331292003854905346 2020-11-25 01:42:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Are the teachers sick or exposed? If it’s “exposed”, this is why adults should not be working closely with more adults than necessary.  They should only be quarantined if they are around an infected adult for more than 30 minutes within 6 ft
1331291607233159174 2020-11-25 01:40:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Then they should lose their jobs.  All kinds of other essential workers are going to work.
1331291449455996931 2020-11-25 01:39:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Is it sick staff or “exposed” staff quarantining?
1331291274939420682 2020-11-25 01:39:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Where is the evidence of sick students?
1331291183830749185 2020-11-25 01:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida is completely open and so are schools and have been for months and are numbers aren’t bad
1331291020999471104 2020-11-25 01:38:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet it’s not happening, you aren’t calling out Cuomo and other blue state Governors, you aren’t criticizing teacher unions, you aren’t criticizing Biden for stacking his Ed Transition team with Union heads adamantly opposed to choice by families.  Do your job.
1331283570728579073 2020-11-25 01:08:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @VixenRogue I’m so glad you’re getting such a joyous experience with a loving partner.  You deserve it
1331282811505041408 2020-11-25 01:05:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @UtterDisgust Obviously, good people feel it’s our responsibility to rear our own children.  Unfortunately, not all parents are good people and school was a safety net for the kids of abusive (or more often, neglectful) parents
1331282143297888265 2020-11-25 01:02:51 +0800 <just_mindy> So you’re saying the market works? Ok cool yes that’s true.
1331280507892592651 2020-11-25 00:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmie_c_ As they should be
1331279832412516352 2020-11-25 00:53:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba I was so glad he did that!!

1331278447738556420 2020-11-25 00:48:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmie_c_ Awesome to hear!!
1331278378775834632 2020-11-25 00:47:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @flinnie Right?
1331277064142532608 2020-11-25 00:42:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh @marcorubio has 4 times the followers you do, pal.
1331276717407801346 2020-11-25 00:41:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Not Florida.  We can dance, sing, go to church and school, wrestle alligators, go to the beach, go to Disney, eat out, go to the movies, get married, drink wine with friends and live our free lives.
1331275839418331138 2020-11-25 00:37:48 +0800 <just_mindy> For real
1331275722548256775 2020-11-25 00:37:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden doesn’t care about y’all or your bloc of voters.  He used you to get elected.
1331274862338433024 2020-11-25 00:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Zero Christians should even slightly consider voting for @ReverendWarnock. Any Pastor who openly advocates for abortion is diametrically opposed to the Bible and is a dangerous false prophet.  He should not have the vote of any Christ follower.  Democrat or not.
1331273926954119176 2020-11-25 00:30:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  Oximeters are so important.  Docs have said people don’t realize how low their Oxygen saturation is with this virus.  I have my parents check twice a day.
1331273030300000257 2020-11-25 00:26:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth Thank you, friend!! 🥰🥰😍😍
1331272841623429121 2020-11-25 00:25:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda I have to get rich first
1331269755102244869 2020-11-25 00:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1331269369830236162 2020-11-25 00:12:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love @bakerlizzie1 For real
1331269195322036225 2020-11-25 00:11:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @RBPundit @RemindMe_OfThis since I know RB will be right
1331268476938412033 2020-11-25 00:08:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you.  People do not realize this
1331265786200133632 2020-11-24 23:57:51 +0800 <just_mindy> This shocks me.  People would be rioting in Fl.  Like losing their ish.
1331264106641448960 2020-11-24 23:51:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Oh I’m sure it won’t be long
1331263738805170178 2020-11-24 23:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @FredMcFly2 @GovRonDeSantis Yes we do!!
1331263608706228226 2020-11-24 23:49:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!
1331263424781836288 2020-11-24 23:48:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @WhiteWolf61 So true!
1331263386013851648 2020-11-24 23:48:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Exactly.  Trying to be woke.
1331263294926184456 2020-11-24 23:47:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @Neoavatara I know it.  It’s frustrating
1331263212172537858 2020-11-24 23:47:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @OCpatriot123 It really is a good state!!
1331260493051334661 2020-11-24 23:36:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g It doesn’t surprise me
1331260183528558595 2020-11-24 23:35:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly.
1331260143317770244 2020-11-24 23:35:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @OCpatriot123 Oh my family are all conservative and voted Trump.  They just didn’t realize we were so open here
1331259954259501057 2020-11-24 23:34:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara That’s the one thing that makes me nuts.  They move away from NY and vote for the same bad policy here
1331259503086608391 2020-11-24 23:32:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Scottbiggie @thebradfordfile @EdAsante77 Most do, but to have our kids back in school and playing sports and having clubs make it worth it
1331258998272749571 2020-11-24 23:30:53 +0800 <just_mindy> No we don’t.  And that’s clear as we picked up more seats in the House, the state house and went for Trump
1331258575159783425 2020-11-24 23:29:12 +0800 <just_mindy> They really don’t.  I talked to my cousins in San Clemente and they had no idea we were living normal lives.
1331258284913942530 2020-11-24 23:28:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Mostly NY transplants who are used to government mandating their every move.  Natives love Gov DeSantis. As do other freedom loving folks who’ve moved here
1331257649862676480 2020-11-24 23:25:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait, what??
1331257440898310146 2020-11-24 23:24:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 @manuphatak @thebradfordfile No state income tax in Fl either!
1331243833447866368 2020-11-24 22:30:37 +0800 <just_mindy> The reason we are back in school is this is a right to work state and Unions don’t run it. We don’t elect Unions.  We elect legislators. They need to get a backbone.
1331243579382132736 2020-11-24 22:29:37 +0800 <just_mindy> No parent in these United States should accept the premise kids can’t be back in school.  DeSantis demanded it &amp; it happened in August in Fl.  Kids are great.  We know there is no evidence kids spread it. This is the third largest state in the Union folks. There is no excuse.
1331242934956683270 2020-11-24 22:27:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcusWhaley1 @sarah_wxtx Florida schools have been in person since August with very few having to shut down for 10 days.  We are having sports, etc. There is no need for prioritizing kids. They should all be back
1331227544595685376 2020-11-24 21:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude The issue is they aren’t enforcing a law.  They’re enforcing an edict from a power hungry Governor
1331131677574311936 2020-11-24 15:04:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh she will be dead in a few days
1331131354193530886 2020-11-24 15:03:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Or a train.  Or go to a concert.
1331128188852973568 2020-11-24 14:51:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @awstar11 Also really dumb
1331127984930086912 2020-11-24 14:50:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @shaunpatdavis @katearthsis @johndail1591 Are you concerned about any against Biden? Are you concerned that Biden ruined a man’s life lying that he killed his wife &amp; daughter while driving drunk when the man wasn’t drunk and Biden’s wife was actually at fault?  Do you care Biden doesn’t acknowledge his grandkid?
1331127548575670274 2020-11-24 14:48:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @shaunpatdavis @katearthsis @johndail1591 Love how the leftist feminist allies show their true colors.
1331127277946548225 2020-11-24 14:47:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @johndail1591 @katearthsis @shaunpatdavis The VP elect LITRALLY fucked her way into the WH so have a seat
1331126893618327552 2020-11-24 14:45:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Melania speaks 7 languages.  Jill Biden is a fake Dr who would cry after one day in a high school classroom.  Calm down. Also, I thought the left decried insulting sex workers and “slut shaming”?
1331124803001069568 2020-11-24 14:37:38 +0800 <just_mindy> The House controls the purse strings.  Dems control the House. Where is Nance?
1331124418068815872 2020-11-24 14:36:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @MustangMommie @foodgod The amount of infections is a useless measure.  All that says is people have it and they may be asymptomatic and we are getting closer to herd immunity.  Our death rate and hospitalizations low.  That’s the important metrics.
1331124225483141120 2020-11-24 14:35:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @TeriLinnN @foodgod The amount of infections is a useless measure.

1330974194432155649 2020-11-24 04:39:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Expeltrump @SenatorCollins You realize she is announcing 4 people may have lost their lives and this is how you reply? Maybe you should think about standing for the right thing and leave your stupid politics off of a post about 4 missing human beings.

1330960778355159040 2020-11-24 03:45:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets It’s a sad state of affairs
1330960529721004032 2020-11-24 03:44:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Also we lost the AR-15 and magazines in an unfortunate boating accident.  May their memory be a blessing
1330959545397628928 2020-11-24 03:40:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Oh yes!!! I’ve been able to find one container in the last 6 months

1330957695273340932 2020-11-24 03:33:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Exactly!!

1330950591791632386 2020-11-24 03:05:23 +0800 <just_mindy> There you go!!!
1330950460350615554 2020-11-24 03:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I know someone is going to say nuh-uh, so I’m screenshotting places with 10 miles of me  https://t.co/fsCVjN9FYK
1330948489145159682 2020-11-24 02:57:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DavidDaniels71 @JessicaTarlov @RonDeSantisFL We have a larger population than NY so it makes sense we have more cases. Our hospitals are not overwhelmed and the death rate is low.  We also have more cases because clearly it’s way easier to test here than in NY.
1330947497288720386 2020-11-24 02:53:05 +0800 <just_mindy> There are LITRALLY 6 places, yes 6 places I can go right now &amp; get a rapid test with no wait.  Within 10 miles. So, how is @GovRonDeSantis “failing” his citizens yet Cuomo is receiving an award? Please explain.
1330946854826233859 2020-11-24 02:50:32 +0800 <just_mindy> So I just listened to @JessicaTarlov on Fox &amp; she states in NYC she waited for 6 hours for a COVID Test.  That is a blue state with the amazing Governor Cuomo at the head.  I live in a red state led by @RonDeSantisFL in a rural area.

1330944951266529281 2020-11-24 02:42:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all know Joe or Nancy do not possess the hearing to actually communicate from that distance.  GTFOH
1330944301254275073 2020-11-24 02:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Really glad y’all voted for Biden because Trump hurt your precious feels so that we can now pay 1000 for our AR-15 and magazines or sell it back to the government.

1330618460414611461 2020-11-23 05:05:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheJovialLife I only do Turkey Breasts so that makes that way easier.
1330618321641803785 2020-11-23 05:05:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheJovialLife I will decorate and set my tables on Tuesday night so that is done.  I will go ahead and mix up the green bean and corn casserole on Tuesday night and then press and seal and refrigerate it.  Then they will just need to bake on Thursday.  I usually do pies on Wed

1330591691405930499 2020-11-23 03:19:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, any pastor who says abortion is fine is a fraud and a heretic and people should flee as he is a false prophet
1330590512508772352 2020-11-23 03:14:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Can we please stop being stupid and comparing ACB believing actual things from the Bible is the same as this man making up his own race grievance religion that also is fine with abortion?

1330547810719166468 2020-11-23 00:24:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @melifix That’s exactly how I felt.
1330525312132800519 2020-11-22 22:55:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep. Georgia has been 3% rejection in years past yet this year it’s more like 0.3%
1330524638548471808 2020-11-22 22:52:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @gubmintworker She’s so bizarre
1330524392997220353 2020-11-22 22:51:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @melifix I can’t imagine.  Last year, my ex husband, his new wife, me, my son and my son’s aunt were with my son’s great grandmother when she left us. To go out surrounded by people that love you is a gift.
1330521115974889479 2020-11-22 22:38:48 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s a mystery why she doesn’t win elected office in Fl

1330514543055958019 2020-11-22 22:12:41 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s sad. This is who y’all simped for.
1330513793349259267 2020-11-22 22:09:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 Wonder where I can get a giant toddler?
1330504173549465603 2020-11-22 21:31:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @THERealWDLWife Exactly!!
1330502801286369280 2020-11-22 21:26:02 +0800 <just_mindy> The Governor of Minnesota is from the Dem-Farm Party which is about as far removed from Trump as could possibly be.  What is your point?
1330502125697310727 2020-11-22 21:23:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jahaza @CaitEMarchand @bethanyshondark Last year’s flu vaccine was about 30% effective so no

1330377010271674376 2020-11-22 13:06:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Darth_Mommie This isn’t right.
1330376934317056000 2020-11-22 13:05:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas 🥰🥰🥰
1330376705849094148 2020-11-22 13:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re a pro-choice heretic.  Jesus already opined on the value of a child.  Your addition to the gospel doesn’t overrule him.
1330375460631539712 2020-11-22 13:00:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @CityofAngelle @NellieBowles You should evaluate why you think you get to tell other people what to think.  And people are literally dying in isolation right now from drug and alcohol overdose, domestic and child abuse, and suicide.
1330375062889910274 2020-11-22 12:58:26 +0800 <just_mindy> It stuns me people think this.  There is no evidence anywhere in the world that this has worked

1330373640102219777 2020-11-22 12:52:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas It sucks.  We are too cute for this
1330373546908987393 2020-11-22 12:52:25 +0800 <just_mindy> So when is @smittie61984 wife dropping the glute workout on the timeline because holy crap.  We are not on her level, friends.
1330372539168731138 2020-11-22 12:48:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir I have a few days of easy mode occasionally

1330313406231040003 2020-11-22 08:53:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Because they are rational adults who can work through sets of facts like “Joe Biden got a million more votes than Obama” or “Rep flipped 13 House seats, had kept the Senate until GA hinky, flipped 2 state houses, but lost POTUS” and think...that feels off?

1330226441653522433 2020-11-22 03:07:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @FletchMatlock Exactly.  They don’t understand  not every family is baking bread and watching Christmas movies.  Some are locked up with addicts, abusers or even just the stress of not paying bills and Christmas around the corner.  It’s a lot

1330222333701840898 2020-11-22 02:51:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  If you can work from home, and your paycheck hasn’t been effected, &amp; you believe everyone should stay locked down, what have you done to help someone who can’t work? And extra tip to the door dash guy doesn’t count

1330178263453474818 2020-11-21 23:56:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Some of us aren’t insufferable and don’t descend from insufferable lineage and enjoy seeing our families.
1330175186776301569 2020-11-21 23:44:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax I should do the same
1330175144787054592 2020-11-21 23:44:02 +0800 <just_mindy> My son &amp; his fellow firefighters got off shift today and went to WalMart and had professional pics taken together in ugly Christmas sweaters. Just a glimpse into this fire world.
1330173897547911168 2020-11-21 23:39:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax She is dancing because Jr has COVID

1330169099943632898 2020-11-21 23:20:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes yes yes!!! Again, there are so many similarities to people being HIV + in the 80’s. We vilified people &amp; they didn’t test or tested and didn’t tell people.  This is terrible for public health.
1330168283954343941 2020-11-21 23:16:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Vets4AP Great minds

1330003233083887618 2020-11-21 12:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> He can’t even get the saying correct: mi casa you casa? Bro, it’s “mi casa es su casa”.
1330002032321814533 2020-11-21 12:16:09 +0800 <just_mindy> This is actually a great question that shows a concern for the children of America so I’m sure @brianstelter &amp; @Acosta will mock Bo for this.
1330001705031897088 2020-11-21 12:14:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Seems like the next administration will be much more accommodating @kaitlancollins

1330000910001577987 2020-11-21 12:11:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Our kids are in school, playing sports, going to piano lessons, playing in the park, attending youth group at church, allowed to have birthday parties &amp; go bowling.  We don’t want him to feel unsupported and I assure you the other side is aggressive and hostile.
1330000463425654789 2020-11-21 12:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> States are closing churches again.  He has refused to.  States are closing schools again.  He has refused to.  States are closing restaurants &amp; entertainment again.  He has refused to.  Our unemployment rate is back in the 6% range &amp; our hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.
1330000058926948352 2020-11-21 12:08:18 +0800 <just_mindy> I know I fan girl for @GovRonDeSantis &amp; @RonDeSantisFL but when I see and hear what other states are facing, it is so clear we are blessed to have a Gov who respects our freedom.  There is tons of pressure on him to force masks &amp; vaccines.  Please thank him for saying no.  https://t.co/YRHdlXUyK3

1329995633630072834 2020-11-21 11:50:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Now we just got the guy who lied about his wife and child’s death, done nothing but government jobs so he’s lived off the tax payer, locked millions of black men up and is senile.  Man, what an improvement.

1329962750383153152 2020-11-21 09:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> In an orange grove around a bonfire drinking beer and reminding everyone to close the gate so the cows don’t get out.  Ending the night in the Quonset Hut getting it on with what became husband #1 eventually
1329961813262393346 2020-11-21 09:36:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1329961315167858691 2020-11-21 09:34:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Actually not what the Constitution says.  It doesn’t make allowances for viruses that kill less than 1% of the time
1329960977476046848 2020-11-21 09:33:01 +0800 <just_mindy> You realize science LITRALLY says lockdowns don’t work so this has nothing to do with containing a virus?
1329960569487699968 2020-11-21 09:31:23 +0800 <just_mindy> For a virus with less than 1% death rate.

1329950168804945920 2020-11-21 08:50:04 +0800 <just_mindy> If Trump being President kept you awake for 4 years, seek therapy
1329949838839066627 2020-11-21 08:48:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Can you people retain a tiny shred of dignity?  Biden is a old man. Surely he can’t stand this much fellating? I don’t know a 20 year old man who could take this much, really.

1329934648391184384 2020-11-21 07:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ElaineFox @NBCNewYork I can’t stop laughing at this.  He has a Gavin Newsome one as well
1329934531793743873 2020-11-21 07:47:56 +0800 <just_mindy> I love this because we all know Cuomo hates to be the butt of the joke more than anything

1329926965554507776 2020-11-21 07:17:52 +0800 <just_mindy> You have a dick on your head in your profile pic so at least you’re self aware.
1329926559529103360 2020-11-21 07:16:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @dee_white @michcusejac5 @stillgray @peterjhasson @mtgreenee Amen
1329926454763806720 2020-11-21 07:15:50 +0800 <just_mindy> No actually we don’t do that.
1329926362661068800 2020-11-21 07:15:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Omar calling someone else “looney” is wow.
1329926086839427076 2020-11-21 07:14:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @federalistmemes Yes.  I def need to read Narnia as an adult
1329926003272146944 2020-11-21 07:14:02 +0800 <just_mindy> About a week ago I realized we will be forced to wear masks always from now on

1329924543671128065 2020-11-21 07:08:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Little House on the Prairie series &amp; Chronicles of Narnia
1329922454744150016 2020-11-21 06:59:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @winningatmylife They don’t.  At all
1329922416374583305 2020-11-21 06:59:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes
1329921599894663169 2020-11-21 06:56:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @dabears1973 🤣🤣
1329921470668165127 2020-11-21 06:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @OrdyPackard @RachelWilder_ @mtgreenee @IlhanMN And talk about how evil white men are and then bang a married one and divorce her husband
1329921321325760517 2020-11-21 06:55:26 +0800 <just_mindy> You notice she didn’t argue the content of @KLoeffler tweet because it’s all true.  I bet Ilhan knows all about the clap.  https://t.co/ndF3CJ5cD1
1329920987769540610 2020-11-21 06:54:06 +0800 <just_mindy> The Dems lost a lot of seats. Like a lot
1329920129736585217 2020-11-21 06:50:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @michaelamoore97 @PoliticalSock True
1329920000333897732 2020-11-21 06:50:11 +0800 <just_mindy> “New Normal”, “wear the damn mask”, “owning the quarantine”, “Safe at home”
1329919497306841088 2020-11-21 06:48:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen  https://t.co/b8QYwLj3dD
1329919293174280194 2020-11-21 06:47:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @michaelamoore97 @PoliticalSock Right. But the other issue was the person could talk and not on a vent?
1329919153315192839 2020-11-21 06:46:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Fletch8311 But thank you!!! 💋😍
1329919064706314246 2020-11-21 06:46:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Fletch8311 There will be no modeling of athleisure in my future lol
1329918562186776576 2020-11-21 06:44:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @clydeechols @CNN @realDonaldTrump @govkristinoem Yep!
1329918411271516160 2020-11-21 06:43:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Just like they do @GovRonDeSantis in Florida
1329918132908126210 2020-11-21 06:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @Twitter @TwitterSafety @TwitterVideo You’re welcome
1329917844390293504 2020-11-21 06:41:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @winningatmylife It’s so infuriating and they do it over and over again
1329917247276642306 2020-11-21 06:39:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Exactly!!!
1329917169245835264 2020-11-21 06:38:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @Twitter @TwitterSafety @TwitterVideo  https://t.co/MzjE3HhLs5

1329915788812226562 2020-11-21 06:33:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem Mine is just always frizzy lol
1329915645996249090 2020-11-21 06:32:53 +0800 <just_mindy> also @Twitter @TwitterSafety @TwitterVideo should put a warning on this as it has been proven false
1329915442010402817 2020-11-21 06:32:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Read the replies. So many people believe this.  They’ve shared it with others.  The lie already has legs.  Now the walk back will get no coverage. CNN should have to do a 6 minute long correction
1329914281954058251 2020-11-21 06:27:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, this segment was SIX MINUTES LONG!
1329914001002815488 2020-11-21 06:26:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes
1329913199441928192 2020-11-21 06:23:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @gubmintworker That’s fair.  I forgot about that one

1329913029425762317 2020-11-21 06:22:29 +0800 <just_mindy> As I told y’all days ago, this woman wasn’t believable. Her body language &amp; demeanor was totally off. You should have also had other nurses confirming her claims. This woman went viral &amp; @govkristinoem was vilified.  Lots of apologies owed &amp; this woman shld be unemployed
1329912128006975489 2020-11-21 06:18:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @office_chick Oh wow!!!!  Thank you for tagging me

1329910674210910209 2020-11-21 06:13:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden didn’t answer a question his entire campaign
1329909602494914563 2020-11-21 06:08:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m currently eating Peppermint Bark &amp; Little Debbie Christmas Trees to assuage my hurting heart but sure, sign me up.  (This woman and I went to high school together btw)  https://t.co/MOtWbjCbc4

1329895760968740864 2020-11-21 05:13:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno He’s too fickle for me to get attached
1329895405748936706 2020-11-21 05:12:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle Girls are nothing but trouble
1329887944308613126 2020-11-21 04:42:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarrioLemieux @yashar Yep

1329887758475780096 2020-11-21 04:42:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok  https://t.co/TxSn7D5ghw
1329886902875459584 2020-11-21 04:38:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The fact she looks like a giddy school the whole time?
1329886756959899648 2020-11-21 04:38:05 +0800 <just_mindy> The blue tip is a nice touch
1329886439971151873 2020-11-21 04:36:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Exactly!!
1329886353174171653 2020-11-21 04:36:29 +0800 <just_mindy> I told my son to stop introducing me to girls because I get too much anxiety when he breaks up.
1329882255012093953 2020-11-21 04:20:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @mannoname4 Yes.  Never let dogs off leash around ponds
1329881387520897024 2020-11-21 04:16:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @josephcphillips I understand that
1329880075542654977 2020-11-21 04:11:32 +0800 <just_mindy> I showed this to my Dad and his one remark is “why didn’t he just poke him in the eyes?”.  Typical Florida man ish.
1329879124861706240 2020-11-21 04:07:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Floridians aren’t like you
1329875058005839873 2020-11-21 03:51:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @JulesInFoCo Same
1329874484254347264 2020-11-21 03:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Leave some chicks for the rest of us, bro.
1329871349788012544 2020-11-21 03:36:52 +0800 <just_mindy> She was correct
1329868965275897866 2020-11-21 03:27:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ltthompso @KateHydeNY @SirajAHashmi May his memory be a blessing

1329864321678123009 2020-11-21 03:08:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC I knew you were a good man the minute I laid eyes on you

1329861100637212675 2020-11-21 02:56:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Your PM looks as if he never brushes his hair
1329860854884544512 2020-11-21 02:55:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC We would fight over them
1329857401391099907 2020-11-21 02:41:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally me literally with those Little Debbie Christmas Trees  https://t.co/VXovCl9iIZ

1329823715668996099 2020-11-21 00:27:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Like why tf does an actor whose dad happens to be a lawyer who says a bunch of dumb crap become like Holy Grail to Twitter Moments
1329823181595680768 2020-11-21 00:25:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m no military person but I grew up with a Dad who was a SFC in the Army and he taught me a lot so I’ll say this...I have some thoughts about war.
1329821805738123267 2020-11-21 00:20:00 +0800 <just_mindy> You should @ Nancy Pelosi
1329821631095726080 2020-11-21 00:19:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan @ajzeigler Me too!!
1329821581061873664 2020-11-21 00:19:06 +0800 <just_mindy> The DNC &amp; their PR win continue to be super panicked about an election result they swear is completely legit.
1329819651480702976 2020-11-21 00:11:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax @Custom716 @SuperAndrea Right!!

1329815599581720579 2020-11-20 23:55:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @CLetha Always
1329774566378496002 2020-11-20 21:12:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Johnandeva There’s a concept called “cutting off your nose to spite your face”.  This is it.
1329774195614638080 2020-11-20 21:10:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @TRHLofficial  https://t.co/9MsyiVNNeM
1329773137114836993 2020-11-20 21:06:36 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t know you and I feel like this is totally doable
1329772982470922242 2020-11-20 21:05:59 +0800 <just_mindy> My main reason for feeling like something is very wrong
1329772879437815814 2020-11-20 21:05:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Feeling super confident about the safety of our country. I can’t believe people actually voted for this. Like literally, this is nuts.
1329771531669557251 2020-11-20 21:00:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I need one with @GovRonDeSantis holding an American flag, riding on an eagle, and shooting a gun whilst shouting Merica. Thanks!!
1329770847863795714 2020-11-20 20:57:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I kind of want this
1329770693685354496 2020-11-20 20:56:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Miss this ❤️❤️🥰🥰
1329768455923437573 2020-11-20 20:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This
1329768390379102213 2020-11-20 20:47:44 +0800 <just_mindy> This is me right here
1329768119955582979 2020-11-20 20:46:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 No way!!!
1329768040075026432 2020-11-20 20:46:21 +0800 <just_mindy> It was a press conference about COvID
1329767140942077953 2020-11-20 20:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> She fell in love with a Hawaiian florist and got lei’d
1329765552219451393 2020-11-20 20:36:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Any that he owns or his friends own or his friends like to go to for their “birthday”
1329765282341130240 2020-11-20 20:35:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Yup
1329765154406461446 2020-11-20 20:34:53 +0800 <just_mindy> This should absolutely be eliminated
1329763678376357895 2020-11-20 20:29:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Those mainly happen to women. No biggie.
1329763073691951107 2020-11-20 20:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Preach
1329760503544107010 2020-11-20 20:16:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq Stuff like this freaking terrifies me
1329760246718476289 2020-11-20 20:15:23 +0800 <just_mindy> The 78 year old version is already terrifying
1329759426824253440 2020-11-20 20:12:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @EIowaGuy The press was way worse with Biden.  They’ve made it clear they will not report on anything that hurts a Dem candidate.

1329756626056863748 2020-11-20 20:00:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @NathanMartin  https://t.co/zRusFXgYrQ
1329755931882688512 2020-11-20 19:58:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, people who don’t have enough self awareness to recognize Trump is a symptom of Obama.
1329755580655931392 2020-11-20 19:56:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Me too &amp; it’s no longer political.  He’s just so arrogant &amp; impressed with himself.
1329755059333304321 2020-11-20 19:54:46 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is the spirit in which we all should move
1329754860934336512 2020-11-20 19:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @NathanMartin Yes!!!!  Lots of heart attacks!! That’s how Matthew McConaughey’s dad died.
1329661501238620161 2020-11-20 13:43:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1329661405570674688 2020-11-20 13:42:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh yes!! That was another thing.
1329661253103591425 2020-11-20 13:42:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Frank_Gotch I definitely can see his point
1329661061637791744 2020-11-20 13:41:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t walk around questioning election results. I knew Obama won 2008. 2012 I had hopes for Mitt but knew he had been beat.  The “Biden win” just doesn’t feel feel right or real or valid in my bones. Sorry.
1329660572992942083 2020-11-20 13:39:19 +0800 <just_mindy> 15. I can listen to Biden like most logical humans and know he isn’t fully cognizant.  People hates Kamala. Even Dems.  She was like 12th in NH. I won’t ever believe people thought those 2 would be fit leaders. Trump is Trump but is the devil you know
1329660017851715585 2020-11-20 13:37:06 +0800 <just_mindy> 12. The left is cray &amp; will stop at nothing to oust Trump 13. A 3% rejection rate in GA for absentee ballots in the past is more like 0.3% this year.  14. Trump winning Florida by 3 points which is unheard of in Florida lately. Florida is a diverse population.
1329659384381779974 2020-11-20 13:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> 8. The Georgia broken water pipe was a lie  9. Philly making it so difficult for poll &amp; ballot watchers  10. The AG of Penn tweet that Biden couldn’t lose.  11. All kinds of reports of bad behavior at Philly polls that came in all day long.
1329658741130731528 2020-11-20 13:32:02 +0800 <just_mindy> 5. Biden’s whole campaign was very strange as if they knew there was no way they’d lose. In essence, they didn’t campaign. At all. 6. The left was adamant about mail in voting and that was ripe for fraud 7. Ballot harvesting happened in my county
1329658256504057856 2020-11-20 13:30:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Here’s why I’m willing to wait to see what happens w/ Election: 1. Biblical prophecy (fine if that isn’t your jam) 2. don’t think Biden got millions more votes than Obama 3. The 6 states where all the problems were all suddenly stopped counting 4. Florida &amp; Ohio are bellweathers
1329657326060662784 2020-11-20 13:26:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes
1329657249330061313 2020-11-20 13:26:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I would like to see some evidence too but I’m willing to wait a couple more weeks.
1329655727779172354 2020-11-20 13:20:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @debi_curry @uknowwillywill @MommyMoose @D_Dot519 @AndrewYang Treated our allies? Are you aware of who protects Canada every day of its existence so it can have a skeleton military force.  That would be the US.
1329655348760883203 2020-11-20 13:18:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Bye
1329654993708781571 2020-11-20 13:17:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @RestingBeeFace @D_Dot519 @joepeters17 @AndrewYang You can thank America for all the extras y’all have because we protect you  https://t.co/ilwXPJ89qm

1329652969730617346 2020-11-20 13:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s sad
1329652887635550211 2020-11-20 13:08:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Holla!
1329638260835049475 2020-11-20 12:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> She fell in love with a programmer and he manipulated all her insecurities
1329637652203769856 2020-11-20 12:08:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Me too
1329628830936559620 2020-11-20 11:33:11 +0800 <just_mindy> “We are spirits. That bodies should be lent us, while they can afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowledge, or in doing good to our fellow creatures, is a kind and benevolent act of God.” -Ben Franklin
1329628433920430080 2020-11-20 11:31:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Keep your feet firmly on the ground
1329624080337793025 2020-11-20 11:14:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear That’s why there is DM 😂😂
1329623625213882374 2020-11-20 11:12:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 I’m sure many have had it.  Probably asymptomatic because healthy.
1329623458410598402 2020-11-20 11:11:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines I’m glad you insisted.  Our older relatives have listened to so much Media it can be overwhelming for thrm.  Yes, this has to stop
1329623205062070272 2020-11-20 11:10:49 +0800 <just_mindy> We fly planes, drive cars, climb mountains, ride bicycles, swim in the ocean, bungee jump, ride horses, eat food, have elective surgery, drink alcohol, scuba dive, have sex, give birth.  People have died doing all these things yet we still do them. Safety isn’t everything.
1329620570225455112 2020-11-20 11:00:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!! What has come of us?
1329620419662516225 2020-11-20 10:59:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray I wish!
1329619254283554818 2020-11-20 10:55:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh good.  We hardly ever hear from him. Glad to see he is well
1329613286321643520 2020-11-20 10:31:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @bechillaxed ❤️❤️
1329613235209768960 2020-11-20 10:31:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  She always has a new demon
1329613112127971334 2020-11-20 10:30:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Ha!! Fair!!
1329609912117317634 2020-11-20 10:18:00 +0800 <just_mindy> You are not an asshole
1329609667656486913 2020-11-20 10:17:02 +0800 <just_mindy> And after 10 days they all come back and then they can teach again.  That doesn’t mean schools stay shut forever.
1329608942469713921 2020-11-20 10:14:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. Just like adults are forced to be doctors, nurses, police, firemen, grocery store employees, realtors, amusement park workers, waiters, sanitation workers, linemen, etc.  Teachers aren’t a protected class.
1329608398418169859 2020-11-20 10:11:59 +0800 <just_mindy> There have been 5 in one Arizona county recently
1329608308026728461 2020-11-20 10:11:38 +0800 <just_mindy> You also say you are married af.  Many men &amp; women aren’t.  Who is caring for their kids so they can work? You understand having a partner makes life more doable in circumstances like this.
1329607966312566784 2020-11-20 10:10:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Schools aren’t breeding grounds when everyone is masked, additional sanitation measures are taken, kids practice social distance and kids with fevers are excluded.  My child goes to a school with 2400 kids. There have been 9 cases since August.
1329607207823028232 2020-11-20 10:07:15 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, I know for sure there was ballot harvesting in my county because they weren’t trying to hide it.  A local commissioner told ppl to bring their ballots to her at a park for food and free tutoring for their kids.  ON FACEBOOk! It didn’t matter in Fl, but it happened.
1329606222060920832 2020-11-20 10:03:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 @AbigailShrier He does
1329606136069300224 2020-11-20 10:03:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Hilary Clinton comes out at least quarterly claiming she is the rightful President &amp; her election was stolen.  If you didn’t faint over the fragility of the Union every time she did that, have a seat.
1329604215161958405 2020-11-20 09:55:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh yes.  Identical
1329604128675401730 2020-11-20 09:55:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @ilikedags17 Sure, but don’t expect me to get vapors over Guiliani
1329604027659788288 2020-11-20 09:54:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @DestructiveChem The last 4 years the Democrats who also allegedly represent the US have talked about pee tapes and Russian interference and stolen elections.  For 4 years.  Trump was Putin’s bitch.  You remember all of that, I assume .
1329603661824208898 2020-11-20 09:53:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @TXVet4Trump Ha!! Same
1329603579095773185 2020-11-20 09:52:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Very much on the pulse of the people
1329603510334332928 2020-11-20 09:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I wonder if Dem lawmakers or members of Biden’s cabinet will be allowed to eat in peace? Being part of the “resistance” seemed so fun until your guy is in power.  I wonder if Kevin McCarthy will get the chance to dramatically tear up a speech.
1329602995764547585 2020-11-20 09:50:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe have Jill’s first husband &amp; Hunter’s stripper baby mama on Fox News.  Hell, we know very little about Ashley and why she is always hidden.  That might be fascinating TV.  They might even find enough to impeach old Joe.
1329602457756905473 2020-11-20 09:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> So yep, our side might decide Biden isn’t entitled to one ounce of respect.  Maybe they’ll investigate him and Hunty if we win the House in 2022 for the next 2 years and lay out all the salacious details of his family life.  Perhaps find old friends to write books about it.
1329601934614007808 2020-11-20 09:46:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Don’t even get me started on the press acting like cheap escorts anytime Adam Schiff “leaked” some new salacious story or Obama’s govt spying on the Trump transition with no consequence. They gave Trump not one ounce of respect his entire Presidency.  Not a modicum
1329601418823659521 2020-11-20 09:44:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Person who doesn’t get ramming through Ocare in the middle of the night, Obama’s pen &amp; phone, Obama’s “win elections” snark, Pelosi’s refusal to do anything worthwhile, the press acting as an arm of the DNC is what led us here.  73 million ppl don’t care how he’s acting.
1329600457929617408 2020-11-20 09:40:26 +0800 <just_mindy> But y’all think Guiliani looks crazy on TV.   K.
1329600126462140422 2020-11-20 09:39:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh it is, but they are way more intellectual than you or I, you see.
1329599595454803968 2020-11-20 09:37:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Some of these same people think Stacy Abrams had legitimate gripes in her race against Kemp as well.
1329599028930240512 2020-11-20 09:34:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Some of them still believe that
1329597838402215938 2020-11-20 09:30:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy They still made him quarantine 10 days. He never had any symptoms
1329596048931696641 2020-11-20 09:22:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy Same thing happened to one of my son’s friends.  He is a college athlete and took 2 one day that were positive and 2 the next thing that were negative.  It’s nuts

1329564906824331270 2020-11-20 07:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 They really don’t get that Twitter isn’t real life
1329564778751287296 2020-11-20 07:18:40 +0800 <just_mindy> I say this because my Dad is a popular bloke and about 10 of his friends have called excited about the press conference. These are all men who had pretty brilliant careers or owned businesses.
1329563930897813509 2020-11-20 07:15:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh You always bring me joy
1329562825786789890 2020-11-20 07:10:54 +0800 <just_mindy> I know we are all very intellectual and above it all here on the Twittah, and think Giuliani is a silly goose, but please be aware the general public does not see things the way the pundit wonk mind trust here sees it.

1329559001294647297 2020-11-20 06:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 I’ve started wearing my air pods in the grocery and listening to a podcast or music and it’s surprisingly so much better

1329490538538655744 2020-11-20 02:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> We want liberty and freedom.  What our country was founded upon.
1329490276075892741 2020-11-20 02:22:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Nope.  I’m not locking down and my Governor says I don’t have to.
1329488887861932043 2020-11-20 02:17:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen There should not be public section unions
1329488003165806593 2020-11-20 02:13:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m enjoying the ratio.  How about that thought?  https://t.co/sa7yLc4I1A
1329487588357533698 2020-11-20 02:11:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @EthanBearman @UTLAnow @WeAreCTA @NEAToday I’ve been a public school teacher for 24 years and I can assure you unions serve to protect negligent &amp; slothful teachers and do absolutely nothing in regards to the welfare of students.

1329463652185935872 2020-11-20 00:36:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy @SAPoliceNews Of course.  You must run to the car after he shats
1329460089305108482 2020-11-20 00:22:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @jwestonharvey @JoeSilverman7 Sure!!!  I’ll send you an address of where you can send them. 😉
1329459135373602816 2020-11-20 00:18:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1329417959891202051 2020-11-19 21:35:15 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s your choice.  The rest of us choose not to live in fear and hide in our homes.  That’s our choice.  Yay, freedom!

1329377605850632199 2020-11-19 18:54:54 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s simple really.  We want to cancel gambling &amp; mortgage debt because fun &amp; housing are human rights.
1329374429101649920 2020-11-19 18:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 Oh, those are never going away now.

1329163735664128002 2020-11-19 04:45:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets Yes.  It’s so bizarre
1329162278608965633 2020-11-19 04:39:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Long overdue
1329162129086287873 2020-11-19 04:38:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Always
1329162102804721664 2020-11-19 04:38:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1329162063462195200 2020-11-19 04:38:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Probably mostly the latter
1329161549877972992 2020-11-19 04:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are insane
1329161421909860353 2020-11-19 04:35:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, why does every public official from NY look like they come out of Hunger Games central casting
1329161163003875328 2020-11-19 04:34:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Why are they closing them?
1329138824316858369 2020-11-19 03:06:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @ArmChairIR Always
1329129042214342656 2020-11-19 02:27:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  The hospitalization &amp; death figures aren’t panic worthy anymore so this is the new metric
1329126674328412161 2020-11-19 02:17:47 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s a weird jump because people can be in the military and not make it an idol
1329126362838396932 2020-11-19 02:16:33 +0800 <just_mindy> He literally said he was Jewish and didn’t know the New Testament
1329125592210567169 2020-11-19 02:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s time for you to explain 2.7 million dollars to husband’s firm

1329121718301044742 2020-11-19 01:58:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 We all always disappoint them
1329121481427652608 2020-11-19 01:57:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1329118962156703745 2020-11-19 01:47:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Also that
1329118392025034754 2020-11-19 01:44:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Right. Live there all you want but realize you will have to drive to reliable internet to do your job
1329118061576728576 2020-11-19 01:43:34 +0800 <just_mindy> And of course the “complaints” were the other parents wanted Obama for their coach too 🤣
1329116988615036932 2020-11-19 01:39:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Yep.  If my home internet goes out, I have to make other arrangements. I can’t just cancel class.
1329116416528805904 2020-11-19 01:37:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Exactly.

1329114703046565897 2020-11-19 01:30:13 +0800 <just_mindy> If she can’t get internet, find a Starbucks or McDonald’s or ask the school if you may come in and “broadcast” using school wifi.  You can’t sit at home and cry &amp; expect kids to teach themselves.
1329113083613245448 2020-11-19 01:23:47 +0800 <just_mindy> This exactly
1329112396909178883 2020-11-19 01:21:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I feel really sorry for Ivanka &amp; Melania.  They have terrible friends.
1329111510854066181 2020-11-19 01:17:32 +0800 <just_mindy> What statement did ACB make from the pulpit that make you question her ability to fairly hear cases?
1329111146079674373 2020-11-19 01:16:05 +0800 <just_mindy> If ACB’s religious beliefs included hating cops, the military, and America as a whole, they would have absolutely mattered.
1329110469697794048 2020-11-19 01:13:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, they are big with the youths 🤨
1329105191917002760 2020-11-19 00:52:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @wrongnowshutup2 I’m so happy for you but so so sorry for the pain I know you felt

1329094278241529864 2020-11-19 00:09:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Dear God.
1329094067842650113 2020-11-19 00:08:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMSombrio I want to read that!!
1329092973963960322 2020-11-19 00:03:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Oh yes
1329092705893363712 2020-11-19 00:02:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I know this much is true by Wally Lamb
1329092444923731976 2020-11-19 00:01:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Or you might want to have a seat and learn instead of opining on Christian theology.
1329092310341017609 2020-11-19 00:01:14 +0800 <just_mindy> As I’m not Jewish, I don’t comment when Jewish people share theological takes concerning their orthodoxy.  Therefore, when Rubio, a Christian, chooses to share about Christian theology, perhaps you should not comment.
1329075634383908866 2020-11-18 22:54:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Grant’s future MIL is a good friend from high school. Literally the best family.  Hopeful it’s a big night for them!!!!!

1328935042245144576 2020-11-18 13:36:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Same.  It sucks.  Thankful for my 2 doggies
1328932542838427651 2020-11-18 13:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Every time. Second verse same as the first.
1328931915378929664 2020-11-18 13:23:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Our county commission released numbers today.  We have 70 news cases each day for the past week, up from an average of 50,  but only 5 ppl are in ICU for COVID in our county of 450k.  Also, patient hospital stays are now an average of 3 days rather than 5. Perspective.
1328930942258470916 2020-11-18 13:20:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow that was a squeaker. 🙄
1328930347271286785 2020-11-18 13:17:39 +0800 <just_mindy> As is Ghislane

1328929057656999936 2020-11-18 13:12:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Me too.  I hate not being able to go out and be normal but I’m soooo glad to not have people touching me
1328926287273086978 2020-11-18 13:01:31 +0800 <just_mindy> If I ever find a man who loves me as much as Obama loves Obama, I will marry him that day &amp; make him happy all the rest of his days.  (This man does not exist.  This is me dreaming)

1328878617326182409 2020-11-18 09:52:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This was my daughter EXACTLY
1328878128832385025 2020-11-18 09:50:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @flinnie Meh. They just don’t even have to try.  I have to drink protein shakes and crap
1328877395168948225 2020-11-18 09:47:15 +0800 <just_mindy> All 3 of my daughters have naturally perfect figures with zero effort and I’m all like “God, did you skip a generation or what the heck”?  (In actuality, their dad is 6’4” &amp; never gains an ounce. One of the few good genetic attributes he gave them)
1328875635700338688 2020-11-18 09:40:15 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is half and is 6’3” so yep
1328875234615844865 2020-11-18 09:38:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not.

1328867442806943746 2020-11-18 09:07:42 +0800 <just_mindy> When IG stories became a thing, I basically stopped putting actual pictures over there.  I mostly just watch stories and add to my story.  I wonder if that’s how Fleet will go?

1328861992229220360 2020-11-18 08:46:02 +0800 <just_mindy> My Aunt who lives in Assisted Living was finally allowed to see her daughter today after 8 months.  My Aunt had Covid &amp; survived. Many of y’all prayed for her.  Her daughter was allowed to see her outside, both in full PPE &amp; 6 feet apart (no touching). My Aunt is 81.

1328746046890127360 2020-11-18 01:05:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Georgia friends.  This is what coastal Democrats think of you.

1328734763063107584 2020-11-18 00:20:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1328734664945774598 2020-11-18 00:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow.  I had to sit down after reading this

1328698725385056257 2020-11-17 21:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @_David_Edward Is this a cry for help
1328697368016019461 2020-11-17 21:51:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans.  The media? Nah.

1328696040367611904 2020-11-17 21:46:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden went a whole campaign and didn’t answer a question.  Have a seat.

1328695113015582720 2020-11-17 21:42:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.
1328694721410195459 2020-11-17 21:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> We must stop all programming we don’t like says the party that calls the other party “Nazis”
1328694194458779648 2020-11-17 21:39:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Plants aren’t an actual thing you can Mom.  Seek help
1328693523110125568 2020-11-17 21:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> The SJW’s in this thread would hate the podcast I just listened to where Dolly said don’t ever call her a feminist.  😂😂😂

1328692383463182340 2020-11-17 21:32:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Particularly when I have friends who bought cars and vacationed with student loan money.
1328692000888123393 2020-11-17 21:30:33 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean, we’ve all seen your ahole if that’s what you mean.
1328691779001069569 2020-11-17 21:29:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The OnlyFans account helped too
1328690705448005632 2020-11-17 21:25:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, the Army is a such a breeze. I wonder why everyone isn’t doing it.  Ohhhhh....
1328690300978688001 2020-11-17 21:23:48 +0800 <just_mindy> And if you’re in Florida, Bright Futures.  Make sure your kids are meeting all the requirements once they start 9th grade
1328689989257994240 2020-11-17 21:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen.  Kids can start with community college, live at home, do AP and Dual Enrollment in high school, do some online classes, get scholarships (apply, apply, apply), and go to in state uni.
1328689500348944386 2020-11-17 21:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @office_chick I hope you’re right
1328687802549219329 2020-11-17 21:13:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Like Biden and the persona the media created for him, it’s all a con.
1328687556091932673 2020-11-17 21:12:53 +0800 <just_mindy> People simply no longer don’t want to not see their parents, not visit their grandparents in nursing homes, they want to allow their kids a childhood and to play with other children, they want to earn a living?!  These monsters!!
1328687191825002496 2020-11-17 21:11:27 +0800 <just_mindy> There are tele-health mental services you guys.🙄
1328686915500068873 2020-11-17 21:10:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Look who she is married to
1328686540453711872 2020-11-17 21:08:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Only Democrats are allowed to have their say in the elections of other states, you see.  You nasty Nazi Republicans need to pipe down. 🙄
1328685926801936385 2020-11-17 21:06:25 +0800 <just_mindy> And Lindsay Graham can call whomever he wants
1328682067610263552 2020-11-17 20:51:05 +0800 <just_mindy> They truly believe it’s fine because “it’s punching nazis”
1328680815883071489 2020-11-17 20:46:06 +0800 <just_mindy> So if your school district is closed or you’re new to homeschooling and feeling like a dismal failure, just read to your kids a lot and have good conversation. I’m serious. That’s how you rear literate people.  It all falls into place!
1328680396054278145 2020-11-17 20:44:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Reading @bethanyshondark and @ElishaKrauss IG stories this morning.  Your local Reading Specialist (they give actual graduate degrees in it!) confirming reading to kids and talking to kids are the single biggest predictors in academic success!!!  That’s it!! It’s that easy!
1328679756255072257 2020-11-17 20:41:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @txtiger1 Yes!
1328614013291343873 2020-11-17 16:20:39 +0800 <just_mindy> This guy is the dullest, most self important and arrogant dolt on television today. Also? He had COVId and was out and about so he can take a seat. He and Governor Barbell Nipples will def see their Mom.

1328609659880677379 2020-11-17 16:03:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Wonder how that happened?
1328576751807721474 2020-11-17 13:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy I hate it!!  And children can’t see smiles!!

1328574590621278208 2020-11-17 13:44:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the number of people who have died thus far by age group in Fl.  Our kids have been back in school since August.  Schools should open now.
1328571794987622401 2020-11-17 13:32:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Philly_Hoosier Absolutely!
1328571069079412738 2020-11-17 13:30:01 +0800 <just_mindy> This also.  Why wasn’t Kamala ever pressed about this after becoming his running mate? She was ok with partnering with a man she considered a rapist?

1328503130972106753 2020-11-17 09:00:03 +0800 <just_mindy> How about if you want 50k of Loan Forgiveness, we start with those who served in the military, first responders, teachers in high need areas, lawyers willing to do pro Bono, docs willing to donate time to clinics...etc

My dad who just finished chemo will thankfully be with us.  I’m not putting off holidays.
1328476375758540803 2020-11-17 07:13:44 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my friends who is ecstatic about this 50k of loan forgiveness bought a car, a new Apple Air, went on a vacation to NY (they earned it after a hard semester) with her loan money.  Between her and her husband they have 150k in student debt.  He’s never gotten a job. Lol
1328475629096984577 2020-11-17 07:10:46 +0800 <just_mindy> and took extra money so you could live in a dorm of suites with a lazy river.
1328474896805093377 2020-11-17 07:07:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude @Sjanderson86 Yes and Thomas definitely felt that way
1328474372609351683 2020-11-17 07:05:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 Also that
1328474241919053824 2020-11-17 07:05:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Exactly
1328473554464149507 2020-11-17 07:02:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @Messyanic1 I agree
1328473228302495747 2020-11-17 07:01:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 Clarence Thomas said “you ruined my life.  I cannot ever get my good name back” to him.  That’s how he felt.  Just awful
1328472784662618114 2020-11-17 06:59:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings Preach
1328472383376793601 2020-11-17 06:57:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Joe Biden had an affair with his nanny who was married and then married her, he lied about a man killing his wife, he has 2 children with significant drug issues, &amp; he ruined the life of Clarence Thomas.  He’s kind of a jerk, actually.
1328471048686284801 2020-11-17 06:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m 45 and same

1328436014139006982 2020-11-17 04:33:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1328434233971527680 2020-11-17 04:26:17 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are comparing Republicans to a party that killed 6 million Jews, gay people and disabled in gas chambers so you aren’t required to take them seriously and we should be terrified they have any power at all.
1328421374659072000 2020-11-17 03:35:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Yessssss!!!

1328411840339120130 2020-11-17 02:57:18 +0800 <just_mindy> No hospitalization among my friends so far thankfully
1328411635036401673 2020-11-17 02:56:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jdnmachi How did you do
1328411506275479552 2020-11-17 02:55:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 You did good though!
1328395083448725504 2020-11-17 01:50:42 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve known about 10. No hospitalizations. One older man (late 70’s) had a few bad days but at home.
1328390347282669570 2020-11-17 01:31:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ljsheeley3 @ATxFellow I agree
1328386182246526978 2020-11-17 01:15:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ljsheeley3 @ATxFellow It should be

1328384586313830401 2020-11-17 01:09:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @ValeriaPugliesi Exactly
1328384517166526464 2020-11-17 01:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!
1328384439412514820 2020-11-17 01:08:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Very true
1328384357577461761 2020-11-17 01:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley It all seems odd
1328384306394390529 2020-11-17 01:07:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 I agree
1328384263054647296 2020-11-17 01:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @MadridFederer Exactly
1328339605393960962 2020-11-16 22:10:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC 😘😘😘
1328339245426216960 2020-11-16 22:08:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC Phat
1328338103665307648 2020-11-16 22:04:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BJLoVerde She seems very broken up
1328337788484390914 2020-11-16 22:03:02 +0800 <just_mindy> The CDC and Fauci advised him masks were useless way back then. We all heard it.
1328337218205847552 2020-11-16 22:00:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis I know.   She has found her fellow crazy people
1328337105676853250 2020-11-16 22:00:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie Not at all
1328337043387260929 2020-11-16 22:00:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobRichards57 Which was her goal
1328336879788417024 2020-11-16 21:59:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @JodiDoering My best friend is married to an ER Doc. They were who convinced me to send my daughter back to in person school.
1328336234993823744 2020-11-16 21:56:52 +0800 <just_mindy> LITRALLY watch this with the sound off and just look at her expressions and mannerisms.  This is a terrified nurse?
1328336062708641792 2020-11-16 21:56:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, check her timeline back to March 2020.  She has been in full blown panic mode since then insisting even that her hospital would run out of IV’s &amp; they were practicing manual pumps.  At that time, there were FOUR cases in ALL OF SOUTH DAKOTA.  She’s insane.
1328334270662848515 2020-11-16 21:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW the handle for this woman is @jodiDoering.  A quick scan of her TL shows she hates Trump and Tim Allen is a garbage person because he’s a Republican so consider her motivation for this rant.
1328332883833069569 2020-11-16 21:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> This woman seems particularly animated and chipper for someone watching people die as she describes.  I would be gutted.
1328329011106361344 2020-11-16 21:28:10 +0800 <just_mindy> We all should and do like my friends who used the money to buy a car.
1328328200179560450 2020-11-16 21:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x @TheDemocrats Oh absolutely.  Chief Broadway came from NY and he will say he left because he didn’t want to do that type of policing but wanted a community police force. I know he’s too often the exception
1328327903000530944 2020-11-16 21:23:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets @KatMcKinley Oh I do too.  They are wonderful people.  We continued to pay them while he recovered (he was out 3 weeks) and she said every client they had did as well.  That speaks to the kind of service they provide.
1328327463177490433 2020-11-16 21:22:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep! Fire Rescue can’t go into volatile scenes until police arrive to secure.
1328327181035048960 2020-11-16 21:20:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x @TheDemocrats Demilitarization is definitely a goal as is reducing uneven community policing which has worked well in my community. For example our chief doesn’t allow his officers to set speed traps.  But the department is also well funded because when you pay better, you get quality.
1328326508323155969 2020-11-16 21:18:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley He recovered and she insists it’s because he stayed home.  Apparently they have had many in the Mexican community who have gone to hospital and died
1328326264768393216 2020-11-16 21:17:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Our lawn guy is got COVId.  He said he was desperately sick and begged his wife to take him to ER but she was terrified to as she said people die once they go to hospital.  She insisted on taking care of him at home.
1328324497116700677 2020-11-16 21:10:13 +0800 <just_mindy> So when you say #DefundThePolice, you are not only losing police officers and their families and friends and people that support them, but also all other first responders who depend on police officers so they can do their job and return home safely.
1328324245194235904 2020-11-16 21:09:13 +0800 <just_mindy> But many times firemen can’t do their job without the police. Police ensure the scene is safe so my son and his colleagues can do their jobs. Without police they can’t do their jobs safely and successfully. Therefore, firemen know they need police officers.
1328323986980278272 2020-11-16 21:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> People love their houses not burning down, their loved one being saved during a heart attack or drug overdose, calling for help when their 16-year-old is having a panic attack at 4 AM, being extricated from a destroyed car after an accident.
1328323602769453056 2020-11-16 21:06:40 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t think @TheDemocrats understand how they lose a whole sector of the public with the #DefundThePolice stuff.  My son is a firefighter.  People love firefighters. No one wants to defund them.
1328320488385417220 2020-11-16 20:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @e2pilot I see people outside not masking but all private businesses here still require it.
1328318825926897665 2020-11-16 20:47:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Who isn’t masking?  I live in a state that doesn’t require it yet everyone masks.

1328172652255727616 2020-11-16 11:06:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Standing Rib Roast or Honeybaked Ham. Alternatively, just do a Turkey breast.  Much easier &amp; the tastiest part.

1328110790117904384 2020-11-16 07:01:02 +0800 <just_mindy> So what you are suggesting is, to earn welfare, people should clean their community or work around their neighborhood. You just said people who need food at the potluck do chores if they can’t contribute in order to eat.  Woooo boy.

1328106660792049664 2020-11-16 06:44:37 +0800 <just_mindy> If “shutdowns” meant these morons couldn’t get Shipt to deliver groceries, and door dash for snacks, and they weren’t allowed to use their laptops so they didn’t get paid like the little people, they’d be begging for the country to reopen tomorrow.
1328105799923720194 2020-11-16 06:41:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Florida is the third largest state in the US.  Of course we are going to be at the top.  The average age of death in Fl is 78.  Kids should be in school
1328105475175550976 2020-11-16 06:39:54 +0800 <just_mindy> and who is watching the kids of the people who have to work?!
1328105353930797056 2020-11-16 06:39:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @modelsforprez Yes
1328105333231931392 2020-11-16 06:39:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Truth
1328105183776296962 2020-11-16 06:38:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @pnltboxx Awesome!!
1328104699673899009 2020-11-16 06:36:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1328104360744718336 2020-11-16 06:35:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Then they need to reconsider their safety protocols.  Covid isn’t different in FL than in Alabama.  The only difference would be safety protocols.  Are they taking temps, making kids wear masks, cleaning appropriately? It’s up to state govt to ensure that happens
1328102551888289793 2020-11-16 06:28:17 +0800 <just_mindy> They are crazy. Biden literally has no plan outside of what Trump did.  They are psycho.
1328102427095158784 2020-11-16 06:27:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Schools have been fully reopened in Florida since August with no issues.  There are virtual options for families who choose but most kids are back in school
1328102085137747968 2020-11-16 06:26:26 +0800 <just_mindy> As a person who lives in a fully reopened state, where we eat out, go to high school football games, go the gym &amp; church, shop, kids all go to school, &amp; life is relatively normal except face diapers, I sometimes forget others are still living like prisoners. I can’t imagine.
1328101431967100934 2020-11-16 06:23:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, who isn’t wearing masks?!
1328101273653174273 2020-11-16 06:23:13 +0800 <just_mindy> How are the teachers in Florida living?!
1328101176676470785 2020-11-16 06:22:50 +0800 <just_mindy> You aren’t a hero.  Kids need to be in school.  Kids don’t die from COVID.  Many states have kids entirely back in school with no issues.
1328100783536082946 2020-11-16 06:21:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe go leave a comment supporting kids being back in school on this post because the crazy “we should lock our kids in the basement for another year” people are weighing in.
1328100394447364096 2020-11-16 06:19:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Your bio says “dare you to enter the chamber of farts”.  I’m sure your child is being properly homeschooled.  For sure.
1328099897388769281 2020-11-16 06:17:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1328099488418902016 2020-11-16 06:16:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Why didn’t Trump use his superpowers to stop a virus?

1327499706713464832 2020-11-14 14:32:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Ha!!
1327488067725381634 2020-11-14 13:46:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Def plenty of women in that situation.  I used to be one
1327487917145681920 2020-11-14 13:45:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Are
1327487864913977350 2020-11-14 13:45:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @awstar11 It’s so tiring to hear about this tiny country with a very tiny population is doing as if it’s comparable
1327486841113743361 2020-11-14 13:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe learn about the actual US and not what leftists who are perpetually aggrieved our shilling.  Also? They can be mad and unemployed because their parents support them off their American dream money
1327486298186199040 2020-11-14 13:39:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Our and our waiters would tell you they prefer tips.  Many make 30-40 dollars an hour.
1327486068694732800 2020-11-14 13:38:36 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re an island with a small number of people.  The scenery in the US is more exceptional.  NZ can exist because super powers like the US defend you.  There is a reason the US is developing the vaccine.  Calm down.
1327485635725316098 2020-11-14 13:36:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Nothing changed in your life in 4 years.  The media convinced you it did, but Trump did nothing to you.

1327483762305884160 2020-11-14 13:29:27 +0800 <just_mindy> I  might lose followers over this, but it needs to be said. I find it extremely disrespectful when people don’t stand for the national anthem. As soon as you hear “Hank, why do you drink”you need to be OUT of your effing seat.
1327483007410843648 2020-11-14 13:26:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Hmmmm

1327477304235323392 2020-11-14 13:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @BoreGuru 👏🏽👏🏽
1327477233716441093 2020-11-14 13:03:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I really do feel like @RonDeSantisFL @GovRonDeSantis needs to address this as it’s not a child’s decision how their family celebrates. This note was out of bounds and DeSantis should ensure stuff like this isn’t happening.
1327476738952204293 2020-11-14 13:01:32 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t
1327476703891951618 2020-11-14 13:01:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I do appreciate @RonDeSantisFL @GovRonDeSantis but was shocked when this note was sent home to parents.  Fl DOH telling families to only have holidays w/ ppl who live in their home &amp; it is still meaningful. I don’t want kids being made to fear a holiday.  https://t.co/wd3Bmb8g7R
1327475011637141504 2020-11-14 12:54:40 +0800 <just_mindy> No mam. People were being encouraged to move there and vote
1327474829499490307 2020-11-14 12:53:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Now they need to be vigilant.  Anyone registering now should be highly scrutinized

1327394750715088904 2020-11-14 07:35:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Like maybe our Latino people are different here and that’s why they voted for Trump, but you ain’t going to go around calling folks “spic” here and walk away.  Don’t try that in Florida.
1327393759890452481 2020-11-14 07:31:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield First trimester as that is the worst. And anytime after that.

1327392992777400321 2020-11-14 07:28:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly!!!
1327392938729598976 2020-11-14 07:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Me too
1327391437978284034 2020-11-14 07:22:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Too late.  It has bred resentment.  That ship has sailed.  We need to go back to life.
1327391032238018560 2020-11-14 07:20:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t do what I’m told.

1327388887178752001 2020-11-14 07:12:27 +0800 <just_mindy> But people needed to go celebrate Biden winning.  I continue to hold the non controversial view you are a hypocrite. Call those folks out &amp; then people will care what you say.  Also, what do you suggest?  We know lock downs don’t work.
1327388060783403008 2020-11-14 07:09:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Yikes
1327386934470119427 2020-11-14 07:04:41 +0800 <just_mindy> One final note @RonDeSantisFL kids shouldn’t influence the plans adults make for their family holidays and the Health Dept putting kids in the position of bad cop with their parents is completely disrespectful of constituents.
1327386495435632647 2020-11-14 07:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 He gets much better PR when he stands up for liberty and says he encourages families to make decisions based on individual circumstances
1327386244096077824 2020-11-14 07:01:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally @RonDeSantisFL you need to instruct the health department they don’t define what is “meaningful” to families.  That isn’t their role.
1327385929754038273 2020-11-14 07:00:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas @RonDeSantisFL Exactly and that makes me furious
1327385843032608771 2020-11-14 07:00:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Stop instilling fear into kids.  Kids are now going to be scared of Thanksgiving and being around family because of this nonsense. I thought Florida had dodged a bullet with the over the top rhetoric but I guess not.
1327385011335667713 2020-11-14 06:57:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @lhcamp @RonDeSantisFL I am super angry.  Like you said, they want the kids to insist to their parents that having Thanksgiving is bad.
1327384804875231233 2020-11-14 06:56:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I understand reminding Floridians to be safe, but discouraging families from gathering is gross to me.  People like me will just live my life, but impressionable people will cancel because of this &amp; that is antithetical to the attitude of your admin thus far.
1327384001707986945 2020-11-14 06:53:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @RonDeSantisFL I’m super unimpressed with the flyer sent home with school students today from the Florida Dept of Health encouraging Thanksgiving meals with only ppl you live with &amp; indicating they are still “meaningful”.     https://t.co/Nndu0WjVOV

1327296820968648705 2020-11-14 01:06:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi fought for who? Pelosi LITRALLY held up COVID relief.

Not sure how it relates to Toobin forcing coworkers to watch him play with himself.  Consent is a thing.  Miller didn’t force women to sleep with him &amp; they both knew he was married

1327119917267755009 2020-11-13 13:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And that is the truest thing I’ve ever said. They are why I breathe and find joy and my greatest accomplishment is them. I’m so glad the convo gave me the chance to tell her that.  It’s just so sad some kids aren’t valued like that
1327119527667245059 2020-11-13 13:22:06 +0800 <just_mindy> One other thing, my daughter &amp; I want for eyelash fills tonight.  On the way home she said “my friend’s Mom said in the back of their mind, all parents feel their kids ruined their lives”.  She asked me if that was true. I told her no way, I wouldn’t have a life without them.
1327119023738384385 2020-11-13 13:20:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @modelsforprez I don’t understand it.  People are so easily taken in
1327118855483895808 2020-11-13 13:19:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Yep
1327118774236012549 2020-11-13 13:19:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Human beings are social creatures made for intimacy with others. This is why we talk about the danger of solitary confinement. Some of y’all have parents or grandparents who have seen no one but their nurse for almost a year.  That’s equivalent to a prisoner only seeing the guard
1327118232021512192 2020-11-13 13:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Not for nothing, but depriving your elderly parents and grandparents of companionship and their grandchildren and holidays and affection is way worse on the immune system than COVID could ever be. 🤷🏼‍♀️

1327115311980683265 2020-11-13 13:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> This person doesn’t realize Thanksgiving is about the memories and the love and taking time to love your people.  He/she is “better to be pitied than censured” as my Granny used to say.
1327114932933046272 2020-11-13 13:03:51 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m a 45 year old woman who has lost many family members in the last 2 years.  In addition, I lost 3 family members to a traumatic car accident years ago and it still haunts me.  See your families.

1327034621859598336 2020-11-13 07:44:43 +0800 <just_mindy> IOW, @PeteButtigieg had a panic attack when he realized @SenTedCruz would question him about it during his cabinet confirmation since it was founded by all his former staffers.
1327034021487009793 2020-11-13 07:42:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Please RT this thread.  This is why we fight so hard for school choice.  Public schools have been holding families hostage via zip code for decades.  Allowed to provide a subpar service with zero accountability.  Now, they are holding us hostage using COVID as a cudgel.
1327033641474674688 2020-11-13 07:40:49 +0800 <just_mindy> This is asinine.  Parents with kids with an IEP should sue as online learning is not least restrictive environment and zoom is not meeting the needs of the IEP. That is literally breaking the law and school systems receive extra money to provide these services.

1327010663655481344 2020-11-13 06:09:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax @J_C_Elias ❤️❤️
1327010604679311362 2020-11-13 06:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie I don’t either!!!
1327010546034618368 2020-11-13 06:09:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @MommaShark36 Oh you’re exactly right
1327010451650121728 2020-11-13 06:08:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell I am 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣
1327006183362883586 2020-11-13 05:51:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL I don’t understand
1327006029364797446 2020-11-13 05:51:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Going to fluff my Christmas Tree, listen to Christmas music, and light my Twisted Peppermint @bathbodyworks candle.  Eff Covid.
1327005426936913921 2020-11-13 05:48:43 +0800 <just_mindy> I live on what’s basically a compound with me in one house, my parents in another and my son in another. So yes, we are extra family togetherness but there is zero probability I would go a year without seeing them for any reason.  That thread guts me.
1327004782138159113 2020-11-13 05:46:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Really good point!!
1327004368181342208 2020-11-13 05:44:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 It’s the weirdest cult
1327004161796411394 2020-11-13 05:43:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax @RealSagacity I knew you would be shocked
1327004114220421131 2020-11-13 05:43:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @FrankPizzacalla @WaltzingMtilda For real!
1327003454888415234 2020-11-13 05:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> This grieves me.  I can’t believe people are not seeing family over an illness with a 98% survivability rate
1327003045125890054 2020-11-13 05:39:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  This is an abusive government and it’s not ok
1327002931204337666 2020-11-13 05:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  There are people who believe everything the government says and then they do things like this. That’s why we should all be working to constrain government.  For people who can’t protect themselves.
1327002430689652740 2020-11-13 05:36:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @FrankPizzacalla @WaltzingMtilda We need it federally
1327002297294000130 2020-11-13 05:36:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets Oh yes.  Ticketmaster is already saying you will have to prove you’ve had a vaccine to attend concert.  It’s insane
1327002051272970240 2020-11-13 05:35:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria @TFC3Tweets I went shopping yesterday and they had people at the door checking for masks and making you use hand sanitizer.  At every store

1327001263993708551 2020-11-13 05:32:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly!!!!!  This!!!!
1327001131290140672 2020-11-13 05:31:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 It is pathological at this point.  WTF is wrong with people

1326977050683564035 2020-11-13 03:55:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  The Dems see they have to cheat now before they become a party left behind

1326930181823586305 2020-11-13 00:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Oh my word!!!
1326925789867233280 2020-11-13 00:32:16 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying
1326925679892570112 2020-11-13 00:31:49 +0800 <just_mindy> We acquiesce with our submission.  Refuse to submit.
1326919760081268737 2020-11-13 00:08:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Have you seen him in the last year or so?
1326919591117922304 2020-11-13 00:07:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, baby.  Mindy for Ed Sec in a DeSantis or Rick Scott admin
1326917179871256577 2020-11-12 23:58:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep! This is what he needs to address because I ABSOLUTELY can see split ticket voting.  Just not only voting Biden at that level
1326916485902643208 2020-11-12 23:55:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Andrew Cuomo is a narcissist blow hard high on his own supply.
1326916296274014210 2020-11-12 23:54:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Thankful for everyone’s sake that is happening
1326916092762189825 2020-11-12 23:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno @CortesSteve Awesome!!! Thank you!
1326915321115123713 2020-11-12 23:50:40 +0800 <just_mindy> I deleted the Steve Cortes tweet as Dan says his numbers are off.  @CortesSteve needs to address his numbers in light of:    https://t.co/KffTqvGFCO
1326914771262861316 2020-11-12 23:48:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley I guess Dan is saying Steve’s numbers are wrong:   https://t.co/KffTqvGFCO
1326914599459971072 2020-11-12 23:47:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is a rebuttal that says Cortes’ numbers are wrong.   FYI:    https://t.co/KffTqvGFCO
1326911924244787200 2020-11-12 23:37:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Also this.
1326911870142459909 2020-11-12 23:36:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Fantastic!!
1326911656069312513 2020-11-12 23:36:06 +0800 <just_mindy> All reasonable people go, hmm...there are tons of ballots with only President marked? Sounds like someone had a bunch of ballots and went through right quick and marked just POTUS because time was a wastin. Occam’s Razor, fan.
1326911085799239683 2020-11-12 23:33:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Blank.  Eff auto correct
1326910952936189953 2020-11-12 23:33:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @LisaTurnage12 Right.  You wouldn’t see such a huge discrepancy between voter behavior.  818 vs almost 100k?  Nah.
1326910773050925062 2020-11-12 23:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @physicsgeek I’m telling you, it’s weird

1326910655987912710 2020-11-12 23:32:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @DestructiveChem In a state like GA where there was 2 senate races?  Nah. I don’t buy that.  Not 100k of those people. It takes one second (if you are filling out your own ballot) to mark Senate choices.
1326909972769280001 2020-11-12 23:29:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Learn to hold his cigarette correctly.  @RealBillOkeefe

1326896761978433538 2020-11-12 22:36:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @SapperK Exactly
1326893778045689857 2020-11-12 22:25:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Exactly
1326893571996327940 2020-11-12 22:24:14 +0800 <just_mindy> It won’t be “sick people” as it is illegal to kill gators in Fl. Yes, a trapper will kill it.  It has lost its fear of humans.
1326893103156957184 2020-11-12 22:22:22 +0800 <just_mindy> They don’t relocate alligators.  They kill them. Relocation is a nice thing we say to make people feel better.
1326892799724294150 2020-11-12 22:21:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Alligators are faster than humans.  Zig zag and get up high.
1326892464523923458 2020-11-12 22:19:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes he’s big.  He’ll now be “relocated”.’ RIP.
1326889503664050178 2020-11-12 22:08:04 +0800 <just_mindy> I say all this to say, unless you make voters actually request the ballot, it is ripe for fraud, and even then, it is not ideal.  The mail in ballots are what screwed up this election.  Period.
1326889179142377473 2020-11-12 22:06:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Her mission was made more difficult though, because in Florida, you have to actually request your mail in ballot.  They just don’t send them.  That is an extra step most people don’t want to do if they really don’t care.
1326888881460031489 2020-11-12 22:05:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Fl law states you may bring in ballots for up to 2 other people. Period.  Obviously she has hundreds of ballots.  The supervisor of elections allowed the votes to be counted but told her she couldn’t do that anymore.
1326888618577842178 2020-11-12 22:04:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Ballot Harvesting- a city commissioner in our county was caught doing it. She advertised “free tutoring and homework help” for kids if parents brought their mail in ballot up to her.  We had the screenshots from FB.  This is against FL law.
1326887584820244482 2020-11-12 22:00:27 +0800 <just_mindy> And Joe Biden is making Union heads the bulk of his transition team so all kids will be back home soon.
1326770650640494592 2020-11-12 14:15:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 @AF632 🤢
1326770598639505422 2020-11-12 14:15:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa 1 out of 10.  Do not recommend
1326768994947358722 2020-11-12 14:09:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Pipe down and be a good Republican.  Damn
1326768658790670337 2020-11-12 14:07:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ Exactly.  Probably more a cocktail wiener
1326768463772327936 2020-11-12 14:07:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Let’s keep your private kinks to the DM
1326768341659361284 2020-11-12 14:06:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AF632 Possibly
1326768202895020039 2020-11-12 14:06:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Exactly!!!
1326767936913240066 2020-11-12 14:05:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist That would be amazing
1326767004464910339 2020-11-12 14:01:18 +0800 <just_mindy> He probably doesn’t get to work for a major newspaper again, no.  Employers are funny about sexually assaulting other employees &amp; the liability of all of that.
1326766560481062912 2020-11-12 13:59:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You say “virtually” every company.  Is there one who is ok with this because I want to ensure I never send them a resume.
1326766114018353153 2020-11-12 13:57:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Or anywhere if we haven’t said we would like to see it
1326765305033617412 2020-11-12 13:54:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Seeing someone I don’t want to see manually stimulate their sex organ is victimizing, yes.
1326764967106924545 2020-11-12 13:53:12 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s not harsh to fire someone for masturbating in front of colleagues.  This isn’t difficult.  This is like a base line behavior expectation right next to don’t take a dump in the middle of the office floor or don’t lick a coworker.
1326763946708185088 2020-11-12 13:49:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 @JerryDunleavy It makes me laugh every year
1326763845457735683 2020-11-12 13:48:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany Yes!!! Lol
1326763696383725569 2020-11-12 13:48:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist I mean, God was so gracious
1326762176791588864 2020-11-12 13:42:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Here’s your crisis PR: apologize and get new leadership.
1326761853163360256 2020-11-12 13:40:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh
1326760389628088322 2020-11-12 13:35:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL 🤣🤣
1326760351757709316 2020-11-12 13:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany Exactly
1326760297152073729 2020-11-12 13:34:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Floridians of good conscience say a prayer every night for our families, friends and community &amp; give a special thanks to Heavenly Father that Ron Desantis is our Governor and not Andrew Gillum. The disaster was too close.
1326759708468908032 2020-11-12 13:32:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ll go for it!!! 🤣🤣🤣
1326759596778721280 2020-11-12 13:31:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta @KenGardner11 Particularly Floridians!!!

1326759453627195406 2020-11-12 13:31:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @kamranpasha ❤️❤️❤️
1326759028006002690 2020-11-12 13:29:36 +0800 <just_mindy> We are the third largest state in the nation so it would make sense we have the third largest amount of cases. What is your point?
1326758047600037888 2020-11-12 13:25:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You should move
1326757975457927174 2020-11-12 13:25:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, like it or not, DeSantis is an example of Trump being a great judge of character and leadership and putting his support behind him. DeSantis won (thank God!) because of that
1326757620758274049 2020-11-12 13:24:01 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s like Trump but more charming and the media can’t stand it

1326725625428762624 2020-11-12 11:16:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ChinoHillsLA Unions don’t represent good teachers. Unions represent bad teachers and hurt kids. I’ve been a public school teacher for 21 years.
1326722597111926784 2020-11-12 11:04:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Oh yes

1326711944900980739 2020-11-12 10:22:31 +0800 <just_mindy> This is terrifying and makes me so so so angry.  I’m so exhausted.  We’ve worked so hard to give kids a chance and now this.  I’m angry at people who say they are for justice &amp; equity and then elect this man who wants to deny parents the right to educate their children.

My parents have multiple restrooms so they could do that so thankfully we already have that in practice.
1326529046264549379 2020-11-11 22:15:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, if you need a little comedy relief, you have to listen to @RuthlessPodcast this week.  @ComfortablySmug &amp; @HolmesJosh go in on Chris and it is one for the ages.

1326526629607301121 2020-11-11 22:06:08 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad wasn’t willing to not have Thanksgiving at all because cancer has taught him nothing is guaranteed and he said he isn’t missing holidays with his grandkids. He will wear his mask, we will spread out on the well ventilated porch and we will wash our hands.
1326526244117164036 2020-11-11 22:04:36 +0800 <just_mindy> As y’all know, my Dad just finished chemo &amp; his immune system is weak so we are having our Thanksgiving on my back porch because it’s large and open and I live where Nov weather is amazing. That is my family’s choice &amp; freedom means  your family can make choices too.
1326525498902650880 2020-11-11 22:01:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump doesn’t have to order you not to have Thanksgiving.  If you are scared of Thanksgiving, don’t have one.
1326524363865288705 2020-11-11 21:57:08 +0800 <just_mindy> People gathering in their own homes is not equal to people using shared roadways.
1326524043663695872 2020-11-11 21:55:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not having virtual Thanksgiving when your political  party has no problem with mass gatherings to celebrate Biden among strangers whilst drinking out of the same champagne bottle.  Not doing it.
1326523417999396866 2020-11-11 21:53:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  As a conservative woman, that era has been every minute of my adult life.
1326522961285816321 2020-11-11 21:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @RBPundit I thought he said if the polls were wrong, his profession was over?  Shouldn’t he be on the job hunt right now?
1326522533697515521 2020-11-11 21:49:52 +0800 <just_mindy> This argument is dumb when you realize many of the disputed ballots only voted for POTUS and the rest of the ballot was blank.
1326521821127204864 2020-11-11 21:47:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @BJLoVerde Exactly
1326521746447589376 2020-11-11 21:46:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Tonight’s CNN List “Americans who didn’t clap hard enough for Joe Biden”.
1326520554963218441 2020-11-11 21:42:00 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/2mLr5UTD0Y
1326519292377096193 2020-11-11 21:36:59 +0800 <just_mindy> I can’t remember, did CNN have a list of Senators who didn’t congratulate Trump or a list of Congresspeople who boycotted Trump’s inauguration?
1326518838956085250 2020-11-11 21:35:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Alternative list title: “Senators respecting the will of the people &amp; waiting until vote counts are verified”
1326518401116803073 2020-11-11 21:33:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @jscdad Oh yes!
1326518338839863297 2020-11-11 21:33:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir I also don’t get that
1326510904196947969 2020-11-11 21:03:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What I don’t understand is why people who should know better, would allow their elders to think SS or Medicare was at risk just to win an election.  Her daughter should have told her Mom neither candidate was touching either so her mom wasn’t inconsolable for months.  Elder abuse
1326395458940448769 2020-11-11 13:24:55 +0800 <just_mindy> That would be the most attractive ticket ever as well as one of the best
1326394473643905026 2020-11-11 13:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @SusieD57 Absolutely
1326393192598605827 2020-11-11 13:15:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @GeorgeWept That’s one of the things I am most proud of my parents for.  They never recoiled in fear over people with HIV and I know they comforted many people and brought some to Jesus.
1326392891787317248 2020-11-11 13:14:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 ❤️❤️
1326392848112099328 2020-11-11 13:14:32 +0800 <just_mindy> What have we become that we feel so superior to others because they caught a virus and we didn’t? Or at least haven’t yet?
1326392398281396230 2020-11-11 13:12:45 +0800 <just_mindy> I was maybe 11 or 12 and the scenes of people suffering alone in this woman’s house who would take them in when family had deserted them.  My parents and church would take food and pray and visit. That’s such an awful way to treat the sick &amp; we are doing so much wrong w/ COVID
1326391961406873600 2020-11-11 13:11:01 +0800 <just_mindy> When so much was unknown  about HIV in the 80’s, my church in Orlando was one who wanted to continue to minister to those who tested positive.  I remember taking food &amp; going to pray with my parents to comfort sick patients who had been utterly deserted.
1326391400385159168 2020-11-11 13:08:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!  The fact we mock, scorn &amp; deride people who contract a virus is asinine. Masks aren’t 100%, nor is social distancing or washing hands. We do what we can, but ppl aren’t bad or naughty if they catch a virus. This feels like the way people treated AIDS patients in the 80’s
1326389562717966336 2020-11-11 13:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Excellent
1326388657868189699 2020-11-11 12:57:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Heck yes!!!!!
1326387929959313408 2020-11-11 12:55:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Who is we?  The Democrats hate y’all.  @aoc &amp; @IlhanMN have wrecked y’all on Twitter.  Take a hint.  Also, GOP hates you too.  Try the Green Party.  https://t.co/VrEXCbbIvA
1326387492145270784 2020-11-11 12:53:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Because he has hair and is attractive? I know that’s a difficult concept for a group of guys with faces made for radio

1326375337240965122 2020-11-11 12:04:57 +0800 <just_mindy> So much looks good
1326375052007378944 2020-11-11 12:03:49 +0800 <just_mindy> This ploy by the Democrats shows you what levels they will stoop to in order to cheat and win.  That’s why I have zero qualms with @realDonaldTrump pursuing every legal remedy.  They’ve shown us who they are. We need to believe them.

1326289031064383511 2020-11-11 06:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Here’s a whole ass ad Rick made about Jeremiah Wright.  As a reminder the opponent of @KLoeffler is @ReverendWarnock.  He idolizes Jeremiah Wright &amp; loves Fidel Castro.
1326288417223798790 2020-11-11 06:19:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh this one is gold @ProjectLincoln.  Your founder is criticizing Axelrod for defending Jeremiah back in 2012,  yet y’all are now funding the campaign of @ReverendWarnock who is a Jeremiah disciple. You can’t make this mess up.
1326287656121233408 2020-11-11 06:16:33 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, here is Rick Wilson of @ProjectLincoln referring to Jeremiah Wright as “Rev Crazypants”, yet now Rick wants to help elect his acolyte @ReverendWarnock in Georgia.  Such principles.

1326286363151437830 2020-11-11 06:11:24 +0800 <just_mindy> A reminder:  @ReverendWarnock praised Fidel Castro so this is really on brand for Lincoln Project.

1326258623111196676 2020-11-11 04:21:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Lincoln Project can target and harass legal professionals for doing their jobs, encourage harassment of their clients by distributing client lists, organize a campaign of stalking on Linkedin but I was suspended for discussing a vasectomy.

1326245571536039937 2020-11-11 03:29:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike He’s obnoxious
1326245461691424770 2020-11-11 03:28:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Please make sure you are actually reporting the Lincoln Proj Twitter account specifically and not just their obnoxious tweets.  https://t.co/Lo9l09hXa0
1326242714845900804 2020-11-11 03:17:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @HawleyMO &amp; @SenTedCruz can you ask @jack why the Lincoln Project’s whole TL today isn’t target harassment?!
1326242031426002945 2020-11-11 03:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq @Twitter @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety Exactly.  Harassing their secretaries, clients, neighbors is fine though
1326241892162531329 2020-11-11 03:14:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @THERealWDLWife @MrsRotnjetski  https://t.co/QJsfaUAEPg
1326241550393880576 2020-11-11 03:13:20 +0800 <just_mindy> And @LinkedIn you should shut this down on your platform
1326241460191195137 2020-11-11 03:12:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Again @Twitter @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety how is this not targeted harassment
1326241120700026882 2020-11-11 03:11:38 +0800 <just_mindy> We’ll need to locate the stone tablet
1326240837110534144 2020-11-11 03:10:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This will make tonight’s chores so much more amazing.
1326239961260183554 2020-11-11 03:07:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrsRotnjetski @THERealWDLWife My mom only has me and yes lol
1326239788874264576 2020-11-11 03:06:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @THERealWDLWife Same, friend, same
1326237367666094081 2020-11-11 02:56:43 +0800 <just_mindy> People get panicked when they are running out of money &amp; the cash cow is drying up
1326227627842154498 2020-11-11 02:18:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Of course they do
1326222819177484290 2020-11-11 01:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> I have
1326222763615522825 2020-11-11 01:58:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Justinland1980 Right!
1326222712017195008 2020-11-11 01:58:29 +0800 <just_mindy> I had the privilege of being on his first transition team when he was first elected Governor of Florida and he runs everything exceptionally well.  This is an outstanding choice and he will be do a great job! He is meticulous.
1326221706088882176 2020-11-11 01:54:29 +0800 <just_mindy> The world is watching us go through the legal process over votes that are disputed?’ They aren’t seeing cities torn down or buildings burned. They’re seeing us go before a judge. How atrocious?!
1326220771249823748 2020-11-11 01:50:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Please repost this tweet for harassment
1326220438083686400 2020-11-11 01:49:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @ProjectLincoln Please report for harassment
1326206659857936386 2020-11-11 00:54:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine @Artist_Angie  https://t.co/6USBUcIh3Q
1326206122622119936 2020-11-11 00:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe because they’ve been told they’re going to die for 7 months straight
1326200744656166915 2020-11-11 00:31:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM @KatMcKinley You have 3 precincts that kept discovering votes.
1326198114785652737 2020-11-11 00:20:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM @KatMcKinley States can be run by Republicans and have districts plagues by problems. That is the issue DeSantis had to root out here in Dade.  This time their election seamless.
1326197762074025984 2020-11-11 00:19:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Exactly!!!!
1326197439838228480 2020-11-11 00:18:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @DenverLarry7 Yes she is
1326197312100704256 2020-11-11 00:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Yep.  And cry again when she sees she worried about nothing for years but her daughter was too much of a scumbag to tell her Trump wasn’t taking her Medicare
1326195336839376899 2020-11-11 00:09:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @bayoukellyfish It is
1326194484909125633 2020-11-11 00:06:19 +0800 <just_mindy> TFW Joy puts up an inaccurate tweet to prove Trump should stop pursuing a recount and now all the comments are Democrats relitigating it and saying Gore shouldn’t have given up.  Thank you, Joy, for proving our point.
1326188792064172033 2020-11-10 23:43:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Randy_Shannon That looks so good!!
1326185923969691648 2020-11-10 23:32:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Awesome
1326175442911506433 2020-11-10 22:50:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Very sad
1326174959673241603 2020-11-10 22:48:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Ohhhhhh
1326172096297394176 2020-11-10 22:37:21 +0800 <just_mindy> The election is contested.  Read the last point
1326171893045587968 2020-11-10 22:36:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Jill Biden has a Doctorate in Ed.  Melania speaks 7 languages.  I can assure you the latter is way more impressive.
1326170009324941312 2020-11-10 22:29:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Awesome
1326169732203106304 2020-11-10 22:27:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely!  Glad we agree
1326168620687364098 2020-11-10 22:23:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @DavidDaniels71 It hurts my heart
1326168019513577473 2020-11-10 22:21:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DeebsFLA @FormerlyCBM @kris_kinder Absolutely, but we also know this isn’t one off typical stuff.  We know a machine “glitched” &amp; changed 4000 votes.  We only know that because that county was reliably red so it raised alarms.  Those machines were in use many places.  We also know PA defied Alito’s orders
1326167304799969281 2020-11-10 22:18:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Just did!! Please join in
1326166503448842243 2020-11-10 22:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> As does @PeteButtigieg if he wants a cabinet role
1326166304764596225 2020-11-10 22:14:20 +0800 <just_mindy> I was cruisin, got no bruisin
1326165549064327168 2020-11-10 22:11:20 +0800 <just_mindy> This is so sad that this woman has been so deceived that at age 86 she was this worried about a fantasy because media lied to her.  You should all be ashamed.
1326162113954459648 2020-11-10 21:57:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I agree.  I used to think the sides could have honest disagreement among decent people.  I no longer feel the majority of Dems, and certainly those with a platform, are good people.

1326146021064368134 2020-11-10 20:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> 420 is the Blaze up number for marijuana because you can get a bag “4 20 dollars”
1326145596760133632 2020-11-10 20:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq She is paid to commentate on politics
1326145305901981697 2020-11-10 20:50:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Will @Twitter or @NateSilver538 do a fact check?
1326145111319867394 2020-11-10 20:50:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Yikes
1326129747710136321 2020-11-10 19:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> I ask these questions all the time and can never get an answer  https://t.co/5ZM6QDTL7T
1326090046232014850 2020-11-10 17:11:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope he has an army
1326032085337993216 2020-11-10 13:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> He stopped being helpful to the party decades ago.  Clearly you don’t understand the GOP.
1326031391319068673 2020-11-10 13:18:14 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m there
1326031190260903936 2020-11-10 13:17:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Who is we? The @TheDemocrats don’t like you boo boo.  Traitors find no harbor in either party.  Enjoy being nothing of consequence.
1326030263315558400 2020-11-10 13:13:45 +0800 <just_mindy> I love this man.

1326006863394181121 2020-11-10 11:40:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe the Senators are waiting to see how the court cases resolve? Seems reasonable

1325999316973056001 2020-11-10 11:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Oh my word.  The stretch
1325996914463166464 2020-11-10 11:01:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Carlos Curbelo has been calling for Trump to resign for 3 years.  Also:  https://t.co/xomA2vo61V
1325996521247166465 2020-11-10 10:59:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley He is.  That guy is desperate to keep a paycheck coming
1325996408982425600 2020-11-10 10:59:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @woohooPhilly She played a witch was is appropriate
1325996255516962816 2020-11-10 10:58:37 +0800 <just_mindy> No sweetie. We allowed parties from every side in the room, every day the numbers of VBM  was updated for anyone to see and by party affiliation &amp; voters could check to ensure their ballot was counted.  Don’t drag Fl, who had a picture perfect election, into your delusions.
1325995529680146432 2020-11-10 10:55:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes

1325990944022409218 2020-11-10 10:37:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Me too
1325990176770945027 2020-11-10 10:34:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Bill is actually worried because he knows PA overstepped, he knows AZ is too close to call, he knows there was voter machine irregularities &amp; he knows common sense tells us GOP didn’t have a stellar night and lose POTUS.
1325989532949426176 2020-11-10 10:31:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @DestructiveChem Yep
1325989392171880448 2020-11-10 10:31:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @Twitter @TwitterSafety this needs a fact check.  Actually it’s @RichardGrenell

1325985487002226689 2020-11-10 10:15:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd We should
1325981572533792775 2020-11-10 10:00:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @LaBeardGuy @Artist_Angie Exactly
1325981440950099973 2020-11-10 09:59:45 +0800 <just_mindy> And jumpy
1325973982575783937 2020-11-10 09:30:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @whybanflatearth Yup
1325973766883729415 2020-11-10 09:29:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Grouchy_OG I mean, this is too much
1325973718741430272 2020-11-10 09:29:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @whybanflatearth She has a really bad case of Jason Miller didn’t leave his wife
1325973632976379904 2020-11-10 09:28:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @MJNDesigner I mean, she invented the crazy ex girlfriend meme

1325971380173762560 2020-11-10 09:19:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth I mean they want to pretend Al Gore didn’t live
1325969805736865794 2020-11-10 09:13:31 +0800 <just_mindy> And literally no one would object
1325969672504827904 2020-11-10 09:12:59 +0800 <just_mindy> The difference is those 42 other states all counted in a timely and organized manner &amp; had returns in within hours.  Amazingly all these states with “issues” still can’t seem to finish up.  That’s a little concerning.
1325969359072866313 2020-11-10 09:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Go right ahead.  Forensically audit all the votes.  Sounds great to me.

1325963964031918080 2020-11-10 08:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @SapperK Right!! Who cares what legal maneuvers happen.
1325963472534982657 2020-11-10 08:48:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity That’s awesome!!!
1325961784717701127 2020-11-10 08:41:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And then Democrats continued to call the election fraudulent and investigated it for 3 years.
1325961572674625538 2020-11-10 08:40:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Then y’all have nothing to worry about 🤷🏼‍♀️
1325961315626659840 2020-11-10 08:39:47 +0800 <just_mindy> I know you were like 7 in 2000 but recounts have gone over 37 days and the republic survived.  You’ll be fine.
1325961064798937090 2020-11-10 08:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Right.  The difference between a coup and not a coup
1325960455232303114 2020-11-10 08:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac It feels like they know Biden didn’t really win
1325960276412395527 2020-11-10 08:35:39 +0800 <just_mindy> The @TheDemocrats investigated the last election for 3 years and still don’t accept it as valid.
1325959937726566400 2020-11-10 08:34:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, my question is, “what are these people afraid of?”.  Why does a recount terrify them? Why are they so appalled a judge is going to hear a case? Biden won’t be inaugurated until January, at best, so why not assure 70 million ppl their votes were counted?
1325958924223254531 2020-11-10 08:30:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Unlikely? Maybe.  We’ll see.
1325958626008326145 2020-11-10 08:29:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Asking for recounts and the Supreme Court to comment on voting irregularities is the exact opposite of a coup.  It is using judicial avenues to ensure all legal votes are counted.
1325957953271246848 2020-11-10 08:26:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Thread
1325957651147206656 2020-11-10 08:25:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1325957598231793665 2020-11-10 08:25:01 +0800 <just_mindy> This
1325956897065852928 2020-11-10 08:22:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Isn’t if fun you will spend the next 4 years completely incurious about anything the White House says as an arm of state news?
1325956434761289728 2020-11-10 08:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Right?! Now it’s impossible for elections to be hacked!
1325956239529029632 2020-11-10 08:19:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @adamgreeney @KatMcKinley That is what people are working on. Gore took 37 days in 2000. Its fine to take some time .
1325956051481604096 2020-11-10 08:18:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @e_warren @KatMcKinley There was proven ballot harvesting in my county.  It was by Democrats.  Have a nice day.
1325955862196871169 2020-11-10 08:18:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanielRomanell4 @KatMcKinley If you don’t believe it will make it to court, don’t worry about it
1325955586815614977 2020-11-10 08:17:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimS_Bosco @KatMcKinley @MarkSalter55 People weren’t allowed within 6 ft of the ballot
1325955496034111488 2020-11-10 08:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley @MarkSalter55 One clear problem were machines “glitching” to change 4000 votes from Republicans to Dem.  Maybe that is isolated but since many counties used those machines, those voters need to be checked.  My boyfriend is a programmer &amp; says glitches like that don’t happen.  It’s intentional
1325948800163319809 2020-11-10 07:50:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Ain’t that the truth
1325947620926365697 2020-11-10 07:45:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Where’s the bad part? Elections need to have fidelity and people have the right to ensure all legal votes counted.
1325946937284161543 2020-11-10 07:42:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @RantyAmyCurtis So glad to hear and so grateful to so many for helping. You are loved and lifted in prayer constantly.
1325940532355457024 2020-11-10 07:17:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @FletchMatlock Yep.  We need to fight on all fronts
1325940460372832264 2020-11-10 07:16:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @FletchMatlock I totally get it
1325933845821214720 2020-11-10 06:50:38 +0800 <just_mindy> For now
1325932482953424898 2020-11-10 06:45:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @FletchMatlock The best thing to do is not concede if we want the Senate.  If Republicans lay down, this base won’t come out to vote

1325927081029627905 2020-11-10 06:23:45 +0800 <just_mindy> All of y’all hyperventilating over a vote recount...were y’all so salty when Gore took 37 days or are y’all afraid they might actually find something? Biden won’t be President until January no matter the outcome so maybe take a holiday &amp; have some sex
1325926515616473090 2020-11-10 06:21:30 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  The large coastal cities don’t like the majority of this country and think they know better
1325926262729216005 2020-11-10 06:20:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Bro.  Y’all just elected a man who has to take 4 days off after any activity that requires him to be mobile and can’t speak without a teleprompter.  Calm down.

1325854133564354560 2020-11-10 01:33:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Did you cry like this when Gore took 37 days for the Fl recount
1325849492302815236 2020-11-10 01:15:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @LadyElinorD Oh yes.  There are some for profits that did terrible things

1325846776390307840 2020-11-10 01:04:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And everyone called him a liar
1325846458826960897 2020-11-10 01:03:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Just remember, in March, masks were ineffective and unnecessary.  Now that is Biden’s whole plan.

1325813078827655175 2020-11-09 22:50:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 I just need Christians to stop patting themselves on the back for voting for “decency” when they literally just voted for the wholesale slaughter of babies. That’s pretty indecent to me.
1325812819460231168 2020-11-09 22:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp 🤣🤣
1325812766297509889 2020-11-09 22:49:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, has anyone considered his behavior is a read run to the way the Media acts on a consistent basis and the fact he hasn’t been able to ever govern in peace?
1325812498679918594 2020-11-09 22:48:26 +0800 <just_mindy> This.  I’m not married to him.  I don’t lay down with him or cook his supper or rub his back.  I don’t care how he acts.  Keep the country safe and prosperous.

1325811947451912194 2020-11-09 22:46:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Jesus Chicken was a huge oversight
1325811812495986690 2020-11-09 22:45:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Let me clarify.  I love wine, but your Mom group sucks
1325811684922023936 2020-11-09 22:45:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 I’m just saying it all now.  I don’t care.  So sick of these women
1325811574712504320 2020-11-09 22:44:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Me to other Christians: you are voting for Planned Parenthood, dead babies, the demise of Israel, and for us to be disarmed.  Why?  Them: but Jen Hatmaker said I was a big mad meanie if I voted for fascist Trump and I don’t want my Bunco friends to shun me.
1325810769305464834 2020-11-09 22:41:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I need to stop 🤣

1325810065362857991 2020-11-09 22:38:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @the_GOAT_hunter There is so many things lol
1325809991333326848 2020-11-09 22:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I’m praying
1325809945422524423 2020-11-09 22:38:18 +0800 <just_mindy> But Mindy, he’s a “madman”.  Ok person who can’t name one thing he’s done that demonstrates he’s a “madman” and is firmly detached from reality.
1325809621496377345 2020-11-09 22:37:00 +0800 <just_mindy> But Mindy, he sends really mean tweets.  Have you considered not following him?
1325809095425871872 2020-11-09 22:34:55 +0800 <just_mindy> A vaccine that looks promising and the markets hitting record high.  Really glad we got rid of this President.  🙄🙄 Some of y’all are fools.

1325803028939730944 2020-11-09 22:10:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Funny that!
1325802968701145089 2020-11-09 22:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @zippyelf @MittRomney He is disappointing af
1325802848668495872 2020-11-09 22:10:06 +0800 <just_mindy> No and in fact, the boss of some of the most prolific list makers, @PeteButtigieg, is being considered for a cabinet position.  We can assume he may be bringing his little fascist crew with him to the White House.
1325802391380373506 2020-11-09 22:08:16 +0800 <just_mindy> You first
1325802251278032896 2020-11-09 22:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Interesting for @MittRomney to take the lead of Health and Human Services under Biden since we are told he is adamantly opposed to abortion. Much like all things Mitt , his allegiance &amp; principles are fungible based on who is courting him.
1325801241461579781 2020-11-09 22:03:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Makes sense  https://t.co/sZTdlXR6c3

1325535046200078341 2020-11-09 04:25:56 +0800 <just_mindy> There’s like a million typos &amp; grammatical errors in that but I don’t feel like fixing them.
1325534772869914625 2020-11-09 04:24:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, I’m a Christian who fails ALOT, and I sometimes cuss, and don’t act charitably, and I’m working on all that too.
1325534577658646530 2020-11-09 04:24:05 +0800 <just_mindy> So, in unity with other believers who feel this is not over, I’m doing my best not to speak against what God has said.  I’m not living in fantasy land.  I’m doing my best to be obedient to God’s call to His people.
1325534204751450112 2020-11-09 04:22:36 +0800 <just_mindy> As a Christian, I’ve seen God orchestrated and designed events these last few months that lead me to believe God is still working and He hasn’t has his final say.  Where God speaks, I will stay silent.  I fear God more than Twitter followers.
1325533798436655112 2020-11-09 04:20:59 +0800 <just_mindy> So, just a PSA so I don’t have the same argument over and over.  I’m a Christian and a Republican but I’m a Christian first.  I have the utmost respect for those of you who believe this election is over &amp; Biden is POTUS, even if that wasn’t your desired result.

1325526082511048705 2020-11-09 03:50:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Looks like someone was trying to create votes for Biden real fast and didn’t bother to fill out the rest of the ballot
1325520634651226113 2020-11-09 03:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> One of @PeteButtigieg former staffers.  Save me the reconciliation talk
1325519913474256896 2020-11-09 03:25:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Pete has nothing to say until he publicly condemns the behavior of his own staffers

1325455357225938946 2020-11-08 23:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s only ever worked at the college level.  She understands zip about the average classroom.  Good day, sir.
1325454449821757447 2020-11-08 23:05:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v And it worked
1325451737298333697 2020-11-08 22:54:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Look for “journalists” to delete old tweets as we forge ahead.  They won’t want their hypocrisy exposed
1325451373551493122 2020-11-08 22:53:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Many of my 40 something Mom friends who voted Biden did so for this reason.  They said “the Dems will calm down &amp; we can all have some peace”.  That’s literally hostage taking of the American public.
1325450415115280385 2020-11-08 22:49:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 @govkristinoem I agree with is why I wanted to know more about her

1325446478815432705 2020-11-08 22:34:00 +0800 <just_mindy> I woke up this morning with a desire to learn more about @govkristinoem and discovered she is like 49 years old.  As someone who prided herself on looking young for my age, I have nothing on her.  Holy moly.  Tweet the skincare routine, sis.
1325443222097813505 2020-11-08 22:21:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah all those people in those boat parades looked miserable

1325308617923375104 2020-11-08 13:26:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Also the baby Republicans were formed under Trump as I was formed under Reagan and they have a whole lot more fight in them.  It will be interesting to see.

1325307585982050305 2020-11-08 13:22:06 +0800 <just_mindy> If you wondered if I raised a more rabid Republican than myself.  Yes, yes I did.

1325284615070822400 2020-11-08 11:50:49 +0800 <just_mindy> It will be fine.  Biden said he is going to shut down the virus.  It’s all over.

1325276385355640833 2020-11-08 11:18:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp That’s what I told them.  We can’t give up

1325276116173656065 2020-11-08 11:17:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m I told them we need the house in 2022 and we aren’t giving up until the court cases are heard
1325275519454162944 2020-11-08 11:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @CoachMarcWilson I know but right now sucks
1325275431176712193 2020-11-08 11:14:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I know I have to be the grown up and tell them how sad I was when George HW lost to Clinton, but eventually Republicans win again, and I did that.  I want them to stay engaged.  Keep the faith, hold the line, own the libs.
1325274975507410945 2020-11-08 11:12:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently our home has become the place for disheartened young Republicans to come to grieve tonight. All voting in their first election &amp; feeling the system is rigged. I dug deep to give them the “this will resolve &amp; we have the Senate &amp; SC speech” but dammit, I get their pain.
1325274117042565121 2020-11-08 11:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThebanMonk Never!! You don’t try to argue with me over every syllable I utter

1325264938508685313 2020-11-08 10:32:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @NathanNix @Chug_A_Lugg Exactly.  He can take that mess out my timeline
1325264785382969344 2020-11-08 10:32:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m blocking a lot now.  I don’t care if friends on here make love to Biden. A friend is a friend &amp; I don’t respond to your praise Biden tweets w/ my nonsense.  I don’t need a reply guy on my Trump tweets. I have a man, a son &amp; a Dad so I have plenty of men telling me I’m wrong.
1325263905409667072 2020-11-08 10:28:31 +0800 <just_mindy> He lied for 20 years.
1325263768239083521 2020-11-08 10:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg Or you could not be a clown and answer the question I posed.
1325262986802565126 2020-11-08 10:24:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg So you would use your national platform for 20 years to say “a man killed my wife and daughter because he chose to drink his lunch instead of eat it” ruining that man’s life and reputation because your wife ran a stop sign?  That’s weird behavior.
1325261387447275522 2020-11-08 10:18:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg The man didn’t.  The accident was Biden’s wife’s fault.  She ran a stop sign.  He also wasn’t drunk
1325261162338988032 2020-11-08 10:17:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @zippyelf That’s true.  I will always give a hot woman credit
1325260852430331910 2020-11-08 10:16:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m just going to pin that tweet for anytime anyone asks me why I have rage toward Biden.  I used to think he was harmless until I researched that story, and any man who will use the death of his family for political gain, is a whole trash bag.
1325260290720718848 2020-11-08 10:14:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @thefactualprep He will be our firewall
1325260203856629761 2020-11-08 10:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 I’m not sure
1325260007299026946 2020-11-08 10:13:02 +0800 <just_mindy> He caused a family significant grief for many years by lying about their father killing his wife &amp; kids while drunk driving. He ruined the man’s life &amp; only after the man’s death did he apologize when the man’s daughter exposed him so no.
1325259440535298054 2020-11-08 10:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh yes.  And cheated on her with a stripper.  And then got the stripper pregnant while still with his brother’s widow.  Then married another girl and knocked her up to
1325259058161520640 2020-11-08 10:09:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer Exactly
1325258965371015168 2020-11-08 10:08:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @thefactualprep Oh we’ll see.  Trump’s base are freedom lovers.  Biden’s are baby fascists.  Watch the overreach happen

1325257013924950017 2020-11-08 10:01:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I truly don’t believe he’s capable of understanding it but his wife has to.
1325255278049304576 2020-11-08 09:54:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Democratic staffers of @PeteButtigieg to be clear.  So all of you who thought he was sweet and cuddly, he literally hired fascists and that rot starts at the head

1325188124771672064 2020-11-08 05:27:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I should probably be clear here: I’m not a kumbaya Republican who wants to join hands and have charcuterie with Democrats. I don’t really like Democrats as a general rule mostly because we have nothing in common.  So, excuse my angst today.  Just know my attitude rarely improves.
1325186076034519042 2020-11-08 05:19:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all underestimate what some pissed off middle ahead betches will do for an Anthro candle, a Yeti wine tumbler, a new Naked palette and a fluffy Duvet.  If I’m not #onhere tonight, y’all know nothing.

1325178914667311111 2020-11-08 04:50:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman I agree.  We need a plan
1325178677588582401 2020-11-08 04:49:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Every day for 4 years
1325178434457374720 2020-11-08 04:48:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s pace ourselves
1325178269205991427 2020-11-08 04:48:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Stay in groups.  Wear your mask
1325178158455382017 2020-11-08 04:47:48 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to hit Target then
1325177746658570240 2020-11-08 04:46:10 +0800 <just_mindy> It would be nice if the GOP Governor of Georgia could say a few words to help us in this fight
1325177046214070272 2020-11-08 04:43:23 +0800 <just_mindy> And @PeteButtigieg whole staff is making a list of conservatives to purge from society.
1325176521330339841 2020-11-08 04:41:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Stacy, it’s like you don’t even know me.
1325176452971520000 2020-11-08 04:41:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Yes girl.  Let me grab all new Christmas decor so I don’t have to go into my attic
1325176316702777344 2020-11-08 04:40:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 Me too
1325176271073107969 2020-11-08 04:40:18 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s a sign.  Trump will prevail in court. 😉
1325175400759259138 2020-11-08 04:36:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I need some new anthro candles so I’m ready to roll out
1325174914794483713 2020-11-08 04:34:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Them too.  LP, BLM etc.  all grifters
1325173818952998914 2020-11-08 04:30:33 +0800 <just_mindy> ❤️😘😍❤️❤️
1325173389900750848 2020-11-08 04:28:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @SenatorCollins Really sad
1325171778298114048 2020-11-08 04:22:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC That’s the truth
1325171708584714240 2020-11-08 04:22:10 +0800 <just_mindy> To be fair Newt @aoc @PeteButtigieg just want us on lists unable to be employed or feed our families
1325171398927593473 2020-11-08 04:20:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @scottevanjenk @Heritage @MZHemingway @SenatorCollins It makes me sad you are an Educator
1325171076574433280 2020-11-08 04:19:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I had never heard this.  Please take 4 minutes and listen to this.  It makes me sorry for all @SenatorCollins has been made to endure. I’m so glad the people of Maine re-elected her so soundly
1325169150398902273 2020-11-08 04:12:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @J_C_Elias Biden literally ran against Romney and couldn’t remember his name.  It’s not a badge of honor.  Also? “That Mormon” wasn’t a term of endearment
1325168432569004032 2020-11-08 04:09:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Head scratcher
1325168371147673600 2020-11-08 04:08:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @SamanthaPfaff Exactly
1325168322393092101 2020-11-08 04:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @bouvier_abraham He needs to go away
1325168195234271232 2020-11-08 04:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock That made me laugh
1325168008919134208 2020-11-08 04:07:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope we investigate Hunter every day for the next four years, as well as Joe’s brother who seems to be the family enforcer, and all their family business is drug out for the world to see.  Cheers.
1325167630920003584 2020-11-08 04:05:58 +0800 <just_mindy> In the South, there are two things you don’t do to a man.  Mess with his family or his dog.  The Trumps don’t have dogs but they’ve become our family since they are now official Floridians.  So, I say, give em hell and I hope Joe Biden has zero peace.
1325167080455368704 2020-11-08 04:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Official press release from the Just Mindy Organization:  Donald Trump was never given one second’s peace from the moment he was elected.  They rioted, spat, harassed his family, endlessly sought impeachment, humiliated his court picks, and lied about his every intention.
1325166362751197184 2020-11-08 04:00:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden called you “that Mormon” the other day, bro
1325166238939578369 2020-11-08 04:00:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Poll watchers must stand back 6 feet and hide behind large farm machinery to watch counts though
1325165830846312451 2020-11-08 03:58:49 +0800 <just_mindy> If this isn’t an official account, why are you verified on this account?
1325164692382343168 2020-11-08 03:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle I agree with all those feelings.  Thank you for some needed perspective.
1325163588093415424 2020-11-08 03:49:54 +0800 <just_mindy> One would think a Dr would know masks aren’t beneficial with zero social distancing
1325162454683439105 2020-11-08 03:45:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @RuckyRuciano Yep
1325162367857037312 2020-11-08 03:45:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle How so?
1325162238097956866 2020-11-08 03:44:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Probably
1325162188152123392 2020-11-08 03:44:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @cmvalentineb You’re right
1325162129524023297 2020-11-08 03:44:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @JeremyR86 @BecketAdams This is what I’ve been told
1325160134243348481 2020-11-08 03:36:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @JeremyR86 @BecketAdams Oh no. This is righteous rallying in the face of evil and stuff.  Covid knows the difference
1325159330019221504 2020-11-08 03:32:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @cmvalentineb I don’t have confidence in that anymore
1325159231448780801 2020-11-08 03:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Praise be!
1325159055774552066 2020-11-08 03:31:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Yes
1325155369216319494 2020-11-08 03:17:14 +0800 <just_mindy> But unite and join hands guys
1325154909742718976 2020-11-08 03:15:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Disagree.  The Dems know they can cheat now &amp; the media will celebrate it and the GOP will say “aw shucks, maybe next time”.  We’ve lost the Trump coalition.
1325151946932580354 2020-11-08 03:03:38 +0800 <just_mindy> But don’t celebrate Thanksgiving OR SING IN CHURCH
1325151401299873793 2020-11-08 03:01:28 +0800 <just_mindy> No it’s over.  Biden said he will shut it down without shutting down the economy.  It’s fine.
1325151199251755013 2020-11-08 03:00:40 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s a fake President and she’s a fake Doctor.  Fitting.
1325150899426086917 2020-11-08 02:59:29 +0800 <just_mindy> DeBlasio is too busy sending his secret police to spy on Jewish schools and synagogues
1325150499100880898 2020-11-08 02:57:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @MattCover @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/EibK44TBXV
1325148887502499840 2020-11-08 02:51:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric We have extra Scott in case of emergency only
1325148687199330304 2020-11-08 02:50:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @owen_smommy Yep!!  BJ’s is nuts
1325144665906032640 2020-11-08 02:34:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1325144383830683650 2020-11-08 02:33:35 +0800 <just_mindy> So @JohnKasich continues to be the world’s most useless idiot
1325143281928429568 2020-11-08 02:29:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I sure hope they root out any Jews in the crowd.  They aren’t allowed to gather according to @NYGovCuomo
1325142871352238080 2020-11-08 02:27:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut There you go
1325142744587595780 2020-11-08 02:27:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently, there is a run on toilet paper.   I would say it’s due to the bull 💩 of this election, but apparently people are freaked about Biden winning and buying the stores out.  Wonderful.
1325135877455159297 2020-11-08 01:59:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Something tells me a guy was Toobin with the help of a passenger
1325135244081684487 2020-11-08 01:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @SuperAndrea Their parties are righteous. Covid doesn’t spread there
1325126612904390657 2020-11-08 01:22:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Duh!!  Covid is over!! Defeated by the white almost octogenarian, praise be.
1325126348596187136 2020-11-08 01:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Of course
1325125096416047110 2020-11-08 01:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Ahhhh.  I’m so not mystical and vibing.
1325123540429885440 2020-11-08 01:10:46 +0800 <just_mindy> They’ll let him play President for a month or 2
1325123294232629253 2020-11-08 01:09:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 He is going to shut the virus down but not the economy.  I’m riveted to see how he does it
1325122356830822403 2020-11-08 01:06:04 +0800 <just_mindy> So, is Biden going to shut down the virus today or do we have to wait until January?
1325119592528744448 2020-11-08 00:55:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @rebekahkg Totally

1325095672694104066 2020-11-07 23:20:02 +0800 <just_mindy> 🤣🤣🤣
1325094762463039491 2020-11-07 23:16:25 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s really unfair to whomever these people are
1325093274026201093 2020-11-07 23:10:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThebanMonk You know there has to be.  As several programmers have said, make the code public
1325091867487318017 2020-11-07 23:04:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1325091807605231616 2020-11-07 23:04:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @DurinnM Particularly when I know how popular he was in 2008
1325091608602288129 2020-11-07 23:03:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThebanMonk I am skeptical
1325090662082109441 2020-11-07 23:00:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1325089987466043399 2020-11-07 22:57:26 +0800 <just_mindy> No one knows what a fortnight is in the US, Ben.  We fought a war to not have to use the word fortnight
1325089457192755201 2020-11-07 22:55:20 +0800 <just_mindy> As have been 2 million other Americans and probably more than that.  Water is wet.  Dogs bark.  The sky is blue.
1325089012302950400 2020-11-07 22:53:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Hillary doesn’t bother me.  She was awful.  I can see how people didn’t come out for her.  When they try to tell me Biden did better than Obama, when I know many of my Republican friends voted Obama in 2008, that’s a problem for me.
1325088546315784193 2020-11-07 22:51:43 +0800 <just_mindy> If the Confederate cooler fits.....
1325087885809356801 2020-11-07 22:49:05 +0800 <just_mindy> They are hoping to pocket a couple more million off the Georgia run offs first.
1325087624739119104 2020-11-07 22:48:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Grouchy_OG Yes, it is

1325084536326270978 2020-11-07 22:35:46 +0800 <just_mindy> This was the other evidence that convinced me there was fraud
1325084072780161024 2020-11-07 22:33:56 +0800 <just_mindy> PA is going to get interesting
1325083168890818561 2020-11-07 22:30:20 +0800 <just_mindy> It takes time to make up new ballots
1325082882285723650 2020-11-07 22:29:12 +0800 <just_mindy> One of those stats is amazing. The other is “glitches” in voting machines.  I’ll let you decide which is which.
1325082259582562304 2020-11-07 22:26:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler Us this morning  https://t.co/Y1PwZHoAip
1325081764931510278 2020-11-07 22:24:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I really didn’t realize how goofy that man is.  No wonder they had to cheat to get him to run off numbers.
1325081052830953472 2020-11-07 22:21:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThebanMonk @Arkwright99 @SavingAmerica4U He should read @jenvanlaar
1325080769547603969 2020-11-07 22:20:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly this.  My smart Dem friends can’t even keep a straight face.  They know it’s BS but it’s BS that they like, so just wink and nod.  The problem is, nobody, even them, will trust elections now.  There are conservative programmers (I love one), too.  Believe that.
1325079159794708480 2020-11-07 22:14:25 +0800 <just_mindy> 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
1325078905691254786 2020-11-07 22:13:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Grouchy_OG Done!
1325078271353085954 2020-11-07 22:10:53 +0800 <just_mindy> I love her
1325078188788215809 2020-11-07 22:10:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate Exactly

1325077519222116352 2020-11-07 22:07:53 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  You’re just ignorant.
1325077444928434176 2020-11-07 22:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans won state houses, only lost 1 Senate seat, &amp; won eleventy House seats but lost the Presidency. Makes sense.  https://t.co/6exNM7LnGk
1325076796023447553 2020-11-07 22:05:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Not America.  States trying to make up ballots to steal the Presidency. Like 4 of them.
1325074137660977152 2020-11-07 21:54:27 +0800 <just_mindy> ICYMI: all those machines with the “glitches” are being used in most of the swing states.  @jenvanlaar does a deep dive
1325073858324553728 2020-11-07 21:53:21 +0800 <just_mindy> There you go
1325073574282006528 2020-11-07 21:52:13 +0800 <just_mindy> As my man explained to me last night.  There is no “glitch”
1325073406145007623 2020-11-07 21:51:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Isn’t it quirky and glitchy
1324964411241590785 2020-11-07 14:38:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow!!  Even more!
1324961215215497216 2020-11-07 14:25:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I really hope one of the @gop court cases looks like: any precinct utilizing this brand of machine must have a forensic audit. Right @AnthonySabatini?
1324960625206964224 2020-11-07 14:23:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Also @secupp this is why people have zero confidence in this election.  Be actually intellectually curious and not devoted to Orange man bad religion for 5 seconds
1324959793182887938 2020-11-07 14:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Actually, you’re not a better person than me.  You believe in fairy tales way more than me
1324958110973370368 2020-11-07 14:13:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously.  Read this.  This is insane.  If you can honestly tell me after this, you have full confidence Biden really won, you’re a better person than me.

1324935042871799809 2020-11-07 12:41:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  My Republican friends voted for Obama.  No way Biden got more votes.
1324934829805350912 2020-11-07 12:40:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The Lord is exposing the schemes. Tariq is one of the first messengers.  More will come.
1324934484517670915 2020-11-07 12:39:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Also this.  Biden damn sure isn’t more popular than Obama
1324934332641910784 2020-11-07 12:38:55 +0800 <just_mindy> He knows what we all know.

1324933868210716672 2020-11-07 12:37:04 +0800 <just_mindy> My son’s baseball friend said “Ms Mindy.  I was up in those counties for baseball camps this summer.  They don’t like Biden and they were like us and don’t wear masks even.  No way those votes are coming from them”
1324933400164249601 2020-11-07 12:35:13 +0800 <just_mindy> See Georgia right now
1324933139354046469 2020-11-07 12:34:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Props for caring about the country past this election
1324932882511564800 2020-11-07 12:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, Hari has now removed his association with @PeteButtigieg from his bio but it was there as well as the fact he was a teacher.
1324932561752174593 2020-11-07 12:31:53 +0800 <just_mindy> So @PeteButtigieg must be so proud of his little merry band of fascists.
1324932239084429313 2020-11-07 12:30:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Please read this thread.

1324922676843081729 2020-11-07 11:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> And if that means Biden wins when it was such a favorable climate for all other Republicans, so be it.  Perhaps it was a specific repudiation of Trump.  But I think it’s imperative the cases are heard and recounts are done in full light of day.
1324922112272904199 2020-11-07 11:50:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule Thank you so much.  I really appreciate that!! ❤️
1324919190776668161 2020-11-07 11:38:45 +0800 <just_mindy> All sides should want transparency. All sides should want to ensure a fair election.  If people don’t trust the process, this country is done.  If we don’t trust elections, there is nothing left.  Love for your children &amp; grandchildren should compel us to fight for integrity.
1324901086822535172 2020-11-07 10:26:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @MWWilliams80 Absolutely

1324865986827325446 2020-11-07 08:07:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1324865864840187905 2020-11-07 08:06:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @DHenderson1617 Because they can’t win in the South and Midwest and they won’t acknowledge it’s a policy problem
1324865689279225857 2020-11-07 08:06:09 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s the messaging challenge for Republicans ahead of regaining the House in 2022. Help the average American understand these people can’t be in power. Showing my parents things on Twitter made them see.
1324865390141431809 2020-11-07 08:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> We need the average voter to see the Dem party isn’t the party of unions anymore. The message has to get thorough to those who are completely or mostly politically disengaged. The average American doesn’t want abortion to 40 weeks &amp; no cows because they fart.
1324864928730255360 2020-11-07 08:03:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Most people know she is insane but mainstream media cover up a lot of her drivel. Conservatives need to figure out a better way to expose the Democratic agenda.  It’s not protecting SS &amp; making sure you make a good living.  It’s all the crazy GND, PP support, off the rails stuff
1324864446653665281 2020-11-07 08:01:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Part of the issue is so many of our voting electorate isn’t on Twitter to see the inane crap @aoc &amp; others spew every day.  The media doesn’t cover it because they know she’s nuts so your average news consumer has no idea she believes in making blacklists of conservatives.
1324863742547472389 2020-11-07 07:58:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Did they not teach civics or govt at rich people prep schools because there’s a whole lot of white privilege running around that don’t understand branches of government
1324863268393979907 2020-11-07 07:56:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate Every time

1324862959458406402 2020-11-07 07:55:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Clearly he’s a baby Fascist judging by the staff he hired
1324862799655415810 2020-11-07 07:54:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate Ezra doesn’t understand that after all these years and explanations
1324862655585275912 2020-11-07 07:54:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Lots of jealous women mad that Kailey’s husband acknowledges their baby
1324862394527571968 2020-11-07 07:53:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Let AOC keep talking and y’all will lose the whole South &amp; Midwest.  Carry on.
1324861964493983745 2020-11-07 07:51:21 +0800 <just_mindy> No one cares
1324861586301923329 2020-11-07 07:49:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest @emabrams Yes

1324848906946158592 2020-11-07 06:59:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gator_Country They sure do
1324846458647023616 2020-11-07 06:49:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m so glad she belongs to the Democrats now
1324846204728053760 2020-11-07 06:48:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, this is literal fascism

1324838370325991428 2020-11-07 06:17:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ @gabrielmalor Yes people want their whole lives to be consumed with politics
1324831678947299328 2020-11-07 05:51:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Earlier I was conflicted.  After talks with 2 friends, I’m #notevenoneinch. It’s not about Trump.  It’s ensuring fair elections.  I saw ballot harvesting in my own neighborhood with my own eyes.  I know there is rampant fraud
1324825398530682881 2020-11-07 05:26:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Yes!

1324825239084290049 2020-11-07 05:25:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @FletchMatlock That’s true.  I’m ready to not have our tax dollars used that way
1324824520822325249 2020-11-07 05:22:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Let’s go to Belize and start that colony

1324823664861290496 2020-11-07 05:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon At least she is honest.  Too many folks just want to deny who she is
1324823561777852416 2020-11-07 05:18:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Yes.  I’m ready
1324823265764782080 2020-11-07 05:17:35 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s “servant to the taxpayer” as all congresspeople are to me
1324822275162595329 2020-11-07 05:13:39 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying
1324822169638064129 2020-11-07 05:13:13 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no way back.  I’m convinced.  There needs to be an amicable split. They won’t be happy until conservatives are subordinate to them.

1324766608720564226 2020-11-07 01:32:27 +0800 <just_mindy> For once I agree with Newt: when you don’t allow watchers in, when you board or paper over windows, when you put large farm machinery in the way of watchers, there is ZERO reason those votes should count.  There is no obligation to trust those ballots.
1324763958885187587 2020-11-07 01:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Let me show you how a real Governor deals with county shenanigans.  May I submit Rick Scott 2018   https://t.co/5yNWIPyJa9

1324541644360863744 2020-11-06 10:38:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @flinnie @SaintRPh Tell the people, Matt!

1324540832213553159 2020-11-06 10:35:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs We will pray
1324540717562290178 2020-11-06 10:34:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Lindsay Graham is going to donate 500k to Donald Trump’s legal fund to fight for this election.

1324525586363092992 2020-11-06 09:34:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy It’s so funny

1324483167202480131 2020-11-06 06:46:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Best line from latest @RuthlessPodcast epi: “the only time @ProjectLincoln got a Republican elected is when they became Democrats”.  I’ll close with some Republican “iconography” for you:  https://t.co/v1YKO9yrIf
1324474985017151491 2020-11-06 06:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 Amen
1324458787651158017 2020-11-06 05:09:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!! Also Ohio!

1324455811729469453 2020-11-06 04:57:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @The_Real_Hank_ Of course.  Bald, round short guy with micro peen mobile
1324455673271406598 2020-11-06 04:56:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings Thank you for confirmation!
1324455344035270657 2020-11-06 04:55:35 +0800 <just_mindy> You need new IT folks if camera footage is days of work
1324455033631608834 2020-11-06 04:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> You should worry about Finland
1324454675463241729 2020-11-06 04:52:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Dems &amp; the Media are one entity bro
1324454033516646400 2020-11-06 04:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @joerobinson769 Yes it is
1324453954097422342 2020-11-06 04:50:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @SamanthaPfaff Yes he is
1324453894748033027 2020-11-06 04:49:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @KenGardner11 @DanIsett That’s the whole thing.  It was all going his way and then suddenly folks stopped counting
1324450658020413445 2020-11-06 04:36:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1324450585089921024 2020-11-06 04:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanIsett @KenGardner11 What I said to my boyfriend today too.  Ohio has picked 94% of Presidents correctly since 1896.  The ultimate bellwether.  Trump wins Ohio handily but loses the election. Funny that
1324450203575947266 2020-11-06 04:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule @FormerlyCBM Why? Florida has a larger population
1324449306116587520 2020-11-06 04:31:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Correct &amp; he’s my hero  https://t.co/XRGHBey0dj
1324448420124368898 2020-11-06 04:28:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @_David_Edward That’s the only joy I’ve had for 3 days
1324447820066234370 2020-11-06 04:25:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep. That fixed a lot
1324447479832653826 2020-11-06 04:24:20 +0800 <just_mindy> This particularly is making me mad
1324447171236765696 2020-11-06 04:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Ha!!! No since COVId, no dependents
1324447079696080896 2020-11-06 04:22:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v It takes more than just the SOS.  Our Governor had to do lots of fixing things in many counties
1324446906437742596 2020-11-06 04:22:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM @jarchie But we know suppression wasn’t an issue this election by data
1324446520402432001 2020-11-06 04:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe What is happening
1324446395177312257 2020-11-06 04:20:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa I’m still not allowed in our commissary.  I’m over it
1324445838857457664 2020-11-06 04:17:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x I should say officers at least. Sigh
1324445554521350144 2020-11-06 04:16:41 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s why Florida and Texas are done in 3 hours.  Maybe the reason all the states having issues reporting are run by Democrats should be a clue
1324445063246761984 2020-11-06 04:14:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Texas &amp; Florida are run by Republicans. That’s all anyone needs to know.
1324444914801934341 2020-11-06 04:14:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Good.  At least the military are generally smart and vote Republican
1324444398969593857 2020-11-06 04:12:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Which is why we can report in 3 hours
1324444314592825346 2020-11-06 04:11:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule @FormerlyCBM It still shouldn’t take days.  Up until 2018, we were the same in Fl and it didn’t take days.
1324444015585075204 2020-11-06 04:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @AndySwan  https://t.co/y1n4DFoFON
1324443418513342469 2020-11-06 04:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> As “pro-life” has now “anti-choice”
1324442938047422464 2020-11-06 04:06:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Ryan1973 We had a ton of mail in ballots in Fl.  Millions and millions.  They were counted in hours
1324442716747538439 2020-11-06 04:05:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM And all those places are run by Democrats. So either they are uniquely inept or there’s a bigger story
1324442473662480384 2020-11-06 04:04:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @angry_blue_dot @FormerlyCBM I’m sorry, did I intimate somewhere I thought Democrats were smart? If I did, let me relieve you of that notion.  They aren’t smart.  Also, Kentucky is run by Republicans as is SC so it’s much more difficult to cheat.
1324441947923251201 2020-11-06 04:02:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM I submit if there isn’t a conspiracy, you don’t mind folks watching.  It also doesn’t take days to count ballots when you are on the up and up which is why the other 40 states managed
1324441596591525889 2020-11-06 04:00:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC He really is
1324438803449262081 2020-11-06 03:49:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield @AOC Yes!!!!  Susan is a particular inspiration
1324438657282068480 2020-11-06 03:49:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @AOC Def follow @ComfortablySmug &amp; @WINRED
1324438125213605889 2020-11-06 03:47:10 +0800 <just_mindy> They didn’t think Hilary would lose.
1324437546080833539 2020-11-06 03:44:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is your list, kind sir
1324435794195632128 2020-11-06 03:37:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Time for a nap

1324433852664848384 2020-11-06 03:30:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist Shocking discovery!!!
1324433776122933255 2020-11-06 03:29:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Exactly!!!
1324433617108566016 2020-11-06 03:29:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Jeb and then DeSantis really made things accessible and transparent
1324433465694179332 2020-11-06 03:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Breaking:  Mindy is in her home office at her job today too.  News at 11.
1324432670730969090 2020-11-06 03:25:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee All voter data is public
1324432530104324096 2020-11-06 03:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Were received.  You can track your mail in ballot online to ensure it was counted.
1324432366660669440 2020-11-06 03:24:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee We have 10 days of early voting in every county.  We can vote by mail but you have to request your ballot.  All ballots have to be in by Election Day at 7 pm.  Our website is real time and shows by party affiliation, how many people voted early each day and how many Mail ballots
1324431878632464386 2020-11-06 03:22:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly
1324431538143059969 2020-11-06 03:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep.  Sometimes you have to be party loyal
1324431421407141888 2020-11-06 03:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Follow the lead of Florida
1324431204876197895 2020-11-06 03:19:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Also true.  We should have been boots on ground before Election Day
1324429396560760839 2020-11-06 03:12:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1324429292533665792 2020-11-06 03:12:04 +0800 <just_mindy> The Miami Dade supervisor of elections acted like some of these Georgia supervisor of elections are acting right now and Ron DeSantis replaced her. Kemp should be working on that
1324428951217971205 2020-11-06 03:10:43 +0800 <just_mindy> We should absolutely not be having these problems with accountability and transparency in a state where there is a Republican governor. That’s outrageous!
1324428749115457541 2020-11-06 03:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m beginning to think governor of Georgia is trying to protect his future political ambitions over ensuring that this election has integrity
1324428603262722058 2020-11-06 03:09:20 +0800 <just_mindy> And I would really like to know what the heck the Republican governor of Georgia is doing right now? I can assure you, these shenanigans would not be happening under a Rick Scott or Ron DeSantis.
1324420683796008966 2020-11-06 02:37:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly. Nope.  https://t.co/K2JK0nEl5t

1324408872128438272 2020-11-06 01:50:56 +0800 <just_mindy> This is outrageous!!!
1324407411067752453 2020-11-06 01:45:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Always
1324407178535575552 2020-11-06 01:44:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Progressives find voter fraud whimsical.  Conservatives, not so much
1324406601818787842 2020-11-06 01:41:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Third largest state in the country

1324381437517275138 2020-11-06 00:01:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest Oh yes!!
1324381331598512131 2020-11-06 00:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy It is nice to have beaches, good weather and Republican rule
1324380919151603715 2020-11-05 23:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 Yes!!! And I will donate and signal boost!!  That’s awesome
1324380673189289985 2020-11-05 23:58:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Because our state is run by Republicans
1324380035759919112 2020-11-05 23:56:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 Yep!!! Exactly!!
1324379944730955776 2020-11-05 23:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes including distance education which Jeb also created and perfected in Florida
1324379795510185984 2020-11-05 23:55:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Right?! And they have ONE JOB
1324379708285440000 2020-11-05 23:55:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Yesssssss
1324379659203760134 2020-11-05 23:54:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem @NickP13 I hope so
1324379610381955072 2020-11-05 23:54:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 That needs to change
1324379470095175687 2020-11-05 23:54:06 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, when a mail in ballot comes in, it is marked “received” and that number is then reflected on a real time website anyone in the world can see.  This way, there aren’t “found” ballots or “oops” ballots.  Everyone knows how many ballots there are in real time. How quaint
1324378839938670598 2020-11-05 23:51:35 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/ipIKKaeei7
1324378514179739648 2020-11-05 23:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> The weakness across Georgia seems to be their ability to keep track of how many ballots they have
1324377839198785539 2020-11-05 23:47:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 I agree

1324374820235083778 2020-11-05 23:35:37 +0800 <just_mindy> And of course Perdue now has to have a run off.  Of course.

1324369410082197504 2020-11-05 23:14:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Since 1896, Ohio has been the ultimate bell weather state.  It has chosen the President correctly 94% of the time.  In this year with all these other “discrepancies”, Trump wins Ohio bigly, yet doesn’t win the Presidency. Such a kwink a dink.
1324368666163634184 2020-11-05 23:11:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly!!

1323762739785965568 2020-11-04 07:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Um.  Woah. To give some guideposts, this is where everybody’s favorite Sheriff Grady is sheriff and my son is a fireman in this county.  GOP does well here.
1323759483206721536 2020-11-04 06:50:29 +0800 <just_mindy> So @Wizard_Predicts is very bullish on Fl looking good for Trump whilst @umichvoter99 thinks it looks good for Dems. I just wanted to clarify since I’ve been sharing Trump positive news for Fl.  There are def 2 very divergent takes.
1323757552950222849 2020-11-04 06:42:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s go Florida!! Please remember our panhandle is on Central time, friends.

1323724451427586048 2020-11-04 04:31:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @bearshrugged @OldRowOfficial My son and his friends all voted early. They bugged each other and his girlfriend even called him because she was confused about some of the amendments
1323724188193095680 2020-11-04 04:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @bayoukellyfish They scare me

1323659979031777280 2020-11-04 00:15:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m that person!  For me, Kavanaugh was a huge turning point. I’m a mother of a son and seeing Kav’s mother suffer through that was too much for me.  Also, Trump has been a full throated supporter of pro-life &amp; school choice.  I thought he was an imposter in 2016.

1323658972612669440 2020-11-04 00:11:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb I hated Trump.  I voted Johnson.

1323657042326937602 2020-11-04 00:03:25 +0800 <just_mindy> As a person who participates enthusiastically, I don’t have “oops” encounters because I know every single time, he’s going to ejaculate.  I’m just that good. 🙄 So there is a birth control plan in place. Also, there is now Plan B for those oops occasions.

1323500472293068800 2020-11-03 13:41:16 +0800 <just_mindy> You telling a successful woman what she should advertise in her bio, and I mean this as disrespectfully as humanly possible, is not one of your finer moments.  Although I suspect, you have very few fine moments so what is one more?

1323449311456333826 2020-11-03 10:17:59 +0800 <just_mindy> People need to vote tomorrow.  Wow!
1323442846314254336 2020-11-03 09:52:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Yep
1323442817050562560 2020-11-03 09:52:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @jscdad Possibly
1323442763141124101 2020-11-03 09:51:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir But what it Senate and Trump held
1323442667607461889 2020-11-03 09:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @GlennMorrisUSA This sudden shift is odd
1323442588104404992 2020-11-03 09:51:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @federalistmemes It’s strange
1323442555191775232 2020-11-03 09:51:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Yep
1323442514351869957 2020-11-03 09:50:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sinclair_D_F @KarstenKinstler Fair point
1323442445854613505 2020-11-03 09:50:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Mauty480 It’s odd, right??
1323442403781521408 2020-11-03 09:50:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @RealSagacity Me too
1323438153957605378 2020-11-03 09:33:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity @irishspy It would be real nice
1323438083375878144 2020-11-03 09:33:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Oh yeah.  A big deal
1323438028241723394 2020-11-03 09:33:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @KarstenKinstler It’s a fine time to do it now
1323437947476189184 2020-11-03 09:32:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @ElaineFox Oh yes he is
1323437902211260417 2020-11-03 09:32:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @RealSagacity What’s going to happen
1323437865079132162 2020-11-03 09:32:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 I hope he was wrong
1323437573340090368 2020-11-03 09:31:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir I’m nervous
1323437505035816962 2020-11-03 09:31:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five True.
1323437369626939394 2020-11-03 09:30:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity @irishspy So what do y’all think?
1323436646340136972 2020-11-03 09:27:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Is anyone else feeling a shift tonight by pundits toward actually giving Trump a chance to win this or is just me?
1323436406157574146 2020-11-03 09:26:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Yep
1323435493959344128 2020-11-03 09:23:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell It’s so fun
1323435449797484544 2020-11-03 09:22:54 +0800 <just_mindy> And again Biden is vetting @rweingarten for his Ed Secretary who is single handedly keeping millions of kids out of school.  Randi is training teachers how to stay out of work and get paid.  It’s theft from tax payers
1323434180210995203 2020-11-03 09:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth Exactly
1323433285234679812 2020-11-03 09:14:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell Oh yes.  Have to kill the nervous tension

1323426890426814464 2020-11-03 08:48:53 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  Each of those voters get one vote within their state.  We don’t do 3/5ths anymore, Robert.  Don’t be a weirdo.

1323411242405580805 2020-11-03 07:46:42 +0800 <just_mindy> And everyone will watch Fox as usual.  This is why MSNBC has lower ratings than the DIY channel

1323330071931867139 2020-11-03 02:24:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 Right? Why haven’t Trump’s secret police arrested her for speaking against him.  These people are insane
1323329947180666881 2020-11-03 02:23:40 +0800 <just_mindy> This also
1323329483722706948 2020-11-03 02:21:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Who has been sacrificed?  Y’all criticize Trump 24/7 and are praised for it.  You receive social capital for it.  Who is stopping you from criticizing him? Who has been killed for criticizing Trump? If anything, they are given 6 figure checks on CNN.
1323328025929371648 2020-11-03 02:16:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Cuomo will.  Probably have one of his “irons in the fire” over too.

1323295897070063623 2020-11-03 00:08:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh so that’s what happened to me.  🎃
1323293515850387456 2020-11-02 23:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> I also want to add we make fun of Tik Tok creators, but they are doing great work spreading the conservative message to Gen Z. It’s important young people see it’s ok to be a Republican &amp; they see all races &amp; religions embracing conservatism.
1323291379208957955 2020-11-02 23:50:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, when I was polled, I answered truthfully and now they are all mad at me.  Lol  Sorry!! I didn’t understand the game lol
1323290617653374978 2020-11-02 23:47:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  So I was a Skeptical Sally about people “lying” to pollsters.  I will say, however, I am in a private FL FB Trump group with over 10k people and hundreds responded they lied. Several reasons: fear, dislike of polls, depress Dem turnout.  So, it could be a thing.

1323286894327828484 2020-11-02 23:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> What is false is that they did anything wrong or worth investigating. There is clear video footage

1323284426336456708 2020-11-02 23:22:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq Yes. It’s a terrible situation.  No one has insurance because it’s too expensive
1323284229422305283 2020-11-02 23:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs Nervous.  I’m afraid we cannibalized our E day vote during early voting.

1323277070286413824 2020-11-02 22:53:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh my word.  Just wait until @rweingarten is the new Ed Sec and no one is allowed to go to school.

1323270021632708609 2020-11-02 22:25:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 Mainly why I want Trump to win
1323268735151579137 2020-11-02 22:20:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 I hate all these people
1323268133407391746 2020-11-02 22:18:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @JDandTurkelton Yes no one I know uses Latinx
1323267309776130050 2020-11-02 22:14:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida is always lit.  You might die any second, but it’s always fun.  We are a different breed.
1323263510118338562 2020-11-02 21:59:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 I have no predictions other than it won’t be by 7 either way
1323261904475856897 2020-11-02 21:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> In case anyone needs the linkage:   https://t.co/ib1nc9WR3d
1323261715811880966 2020-11-02 21:52:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Exactly
1323260798261743622 2020-11-02 21:48:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy That’s the truth
1323259797282717697 2020-11-02 21:44:55 +0800 <just_mindy> I will never not watch this when it comes up in my tl
1323259087463874560 2020-11-02 21:42:06 +0800 <just_mindy> If anyone in Florida wants to bet Biden takes Fl by 7 points, I’m your girl.
1323257303806738432 2020-11-02 21:35:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump voters only: How did you vote?
1323256684995846145 2020-11-02 21:32:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 So strange
1323256447556329473 2020-11-02 21:31:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh he was great last night!!
1323254037626736640 2020-11-02 21:22:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomFLDude I’m just ready for it to be over
1323253438600404992 2020-11-02 21:19:39 +0800 <just_mindy> They’re smart?
1323253225378689025 2020-11-02 21:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> You’ll get me million dollar jobs on the boards of foreign companies?! Sign me up!!

1323251559464095747 2020-11-02 21:12:11 +0800 <just_mindy> This is what I’m clinging to
1323250657432842246 2020-11-02 21:08:36 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s always the anonymous accounts afraid to use their own picture who discuss the looks of whole swaths of folks.
1323250384186544128 2020-11-02 21:07:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Kitty is apparently putting people in ditches.
1323249964022145026 2020-11-02 21:05:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Somebody needs to hear this.  Me.  I’m somebody.  😂😘  https://t.co/VAlH7K8yyl

1323246022689259520 2020-11-02 20:50:11 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s me!!!  Lake County!
1323245800311394306 2020-11-02 20:49:18 +0800 <just_mindy> A tiny good sign

1323134676303810560 2020-11-02 13:27:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC Only because I’m not there
1323134444962795520 2020-11-02 13:26:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Bro.  Biden didn’t do 5 rallies in all of October.  Calm down.
1323134014690070530 2020-11-02 13:25:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC That’s what I like to hear
1323133477642997760 2020-11-02 13:22:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC As long as I am one of them
1323133419488989184 2020-11-02 13:22:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ I know.  It’s so strange with him!!! Yes, S Fl is always 5-10 degrees hotter than Central Fl
1323133232947335169 2020-11-02 13:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @HonkyTonkJew Yep!!
1323129477036167171 2020-11-02 13:07:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC Anything less hasn’t even crossed my mind

1323128866257383424 2020-11-02 13:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Ha!!  It’s not that warm where I am but my ex husband lives there and he just told me
1323128394440212482 2020-11-02 13:02:46 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s 82
1323127662790004736 2020-11-02 12:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC And so am I
1323127135293345793 2020-11-02 12:57:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC I’ll make it worth your time
1323126888391495680 2020-11-02 12:56:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC Sounds perfect to me
1323126720342466561 2020-11-02 12:56:07 +0800 <just_mindy> And Biden is considering the leader of the unions @rweingarten to be his Ed Sec. All schools will be back to virtual learning in a hot second.  People better go vote.
1323126167449280512 2020-11-02 12:53:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Reminder. It’s midnight and people have to work tomorrow and this Miami really is still packed

1323074526469640192 2020-11-02 09:28:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 People cheat for a myriad of reasons.  For my ex, he will always cheat.  He’s on wife 4 now
1323069966220972037 2020-11-02 09:10:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Fair enough

1323068929753944064 2020-11-02 09:06:28 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s not incredible.  It’s the....  https://t.co/yDwRxcuUeE

1323066140189511685 2020-11-02 08:55:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @UtterDisgust For sure.  Her son will resent the invasion of his privacy one day
1323065906042490880 2020-11-02 08:54:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 I’m totally shocked.  In Fl, it’s very easy to request one.  My ex did just to be a jerk.  I passed and the therapist DX him with borderline personality disorder.  🤣🤣 Miller’s attorneys are dropping the ball not to at least get a gag order
1323065401190723584 2020-11-02 08:52:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @UtterDisgust I get that it’s hard.  I can still remember finding the letter from his mistress like it was 5 minutes ago, but you’ve got to stop litigating it on social media every single day of your life.
1323064779771125760 2020-11-02 08:49:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Are we missing kissing Cal?
1323064351130083341 2020-11-02 08:48:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RC9511 @redsteeze Yes!
1323064267994791937 2020-11-02 08:47:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Like my actual husband (I wasn’t his side piece like AJ was) started sleeping with another woman when I was 6 months pregnant &amp; I left him when my son was 7 weeks and I was nowhere near as bitter as AJ.  Bih, let that shit go and move on.
1323063716758343686 2020-11-02 08:45:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  The flags said BLM and Antifa and they also threw Molotov cocktails and burned down buildings and beat up drivers
1323063351757492224 2020-11-02 08:44:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @RC9511 @redsteeze She’s actually first because Biden will last 2 months
1323062865985757184 2020-11-02 08:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1323062775539785729 2020-11-02 08:42:01 +0800 <just_mindy> One day, I’m going to check AJ’s account and she won’t be talking about her custody case that is now like 3 years old and surely causing problems for her son later in life.  Today isn’t that day.  https://t.co/OpIFdGNI4C

1323050057592164358 2020-11-02 07:51:29 +0800 <just_mindy> This makes me want to vomit.  If you have a child in charter, private, virtual or homeschool, this should terrify you.  Randi is truly awful.  You better vote &amp; ask family to vote with you.
1323049680918425601 2020-11-02 07:49:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh my word
1323047877325848577 2020-11-02 07:42:49 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  We had no idea Democrats would refuse to accept the results of an election &amp; plunge the country into angry marches, sham impeachment hearings, daily vitriol all because Hilary lost. The boarding up isn’t for Trump voters &amp; every honest broker will admit this.
1323045743658192897 2020-11-02 07:34:20 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  That’s when there is merging.  You can’t just decide to go into another lane and run someone off the road
1323045024179867648 2020-11-02 07:31:29 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, it’s illegal to drive with your caution lights on.  Is it permissible in Texas?

1322692185330982916 2020-11-01 08:09:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Cubans, yes. Not sure about other Latinos.  I haven’t seen the AA vote switch yet.  We will see
1322691549814267907 2020-11-01 08:06:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Getting worse, yes
1322691374211354625 2020-11-01 08:06:12 +0800 <just_mindy> All of that said, I’m a huge pessimist and didn’t think DeSantis would win in 2018. I just don’t believe we can win Florida at this moment.  I think too many NPA will go to Biden.  The media perfectly curated him &amp; people buy it.  I desperately want to be wrong.
1322690835046109184 2020-11-01 08:04:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And this age group of Christian women listening to Hatmaker, Bessey, Howerton, etc sell them on leftist Christianity hasn’t helped. It’s worked splendidly and is peeling off significant Evangelical vote.
1322690421135462401 2020-11-01 08:02:25 +0800 <just_mindy> College educated 25-40 year olds are going to be a yuge problem for Trump.  They are all about who is nice and kind and warm fuzzy. They don’t think logically as a whole.  Obviously lots of exceptions but it’s a very groupthink generation
1322689839947522050 2020-11-01 08:00:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Anecdotal things that make me worried about Trump in Fl: 1. I hear lots of “Trump fatigue” from moms and professionals my age. They see Biden as a friendly uncle. 2. Some people fear COVID very much &amp; are mad we are so open.  3. Too many Biden signs in my usually very red county
1322689324626837504 2020-11-01 07:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Anecdotal things that make me happy about Trump chances in Florida: 1. High turnout in many red counties  2. Republicans slayed early in person voting  3. Boat &amp; road rallies had high enthusiasm 4. We are open in Fl and we appreciate that.

1322614667966074881 2020-11-01 03:01:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I had to stop watching.  It’s a joke
1322613479329697800 2020-11-01 02:56:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield My dad has a friend voting for Biden.  I kid you not, when my Dad questioned him about this very thing, he said “Trump’s rhetoric and racism incites these people to do this.  Once he is gone, they’ll stop rioting and burning”.  This is a very smart man.

1322609363522097154 2020-11-01 02:40:19 +0800 <just_mindy> This is like my family.  My son is way more into Trump than me.
1322608930376372225 2020-11-01 02:38:36 +0800 <just_mindy> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1322599949784305680 2020-11-01 02:02:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Mine is trick or treating tonight
1322599660628987904 2020-11-01 02:01:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @bbanck I know!! Glad to hear I don’t have the hate them!
1322590619223662592 2020-11-01 01:25:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @josephcphillips Funny that?! Right!
1322590530862284802 2020-11-01 01:25:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings Yes
1322588681702690819 2020-11-01 01:18:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Awesome!  Will shop there more now!
1322587951751143425 2020-11-01 01:15:14 +0800 <just_mindy> And he slept with his mistress in his own house.  Couldn’t even spring for a decent hotel room
1322585147775029250 2020-11-01 01:04:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I received a text from this same group yesterday.  I told the truth though.  https://t.co/5aC6SdKiuo
1322584193818386437 2020-11-01 01:00:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh that would be awesome
1322584047412039681 2020-11-01 00:59:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 My son went once and got to be on the news and it was such a great experience.  He’s been die hard Trump since then  https://t.co/eBsUKUWuB5
1322582800420261888 2020-11-01 00:54:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Hey y’all!! Will y’all RT this?
1322582226345857024 2020-11-01 00:52:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @Gormogons @atomickristin lol!! I’m just glad my kid isn’t going to die of heat while out trick or treating
1322581152385933314 2020-11-01 00:48:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @LorenSethC Yes.  I agree Reagan was way better lol
1322580584535891968 2020-11-01 00:45:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @LorenSethC Me too
1322580537828147202 2020-11-01 00:45:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @atomickristin @Gormogons I can’t imagine
1322580457880473600 2020-11-01 00:45:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons @_BatMN_ @atomickristin It’s finally going to be 54 here in the morning
1322579492431368198 2020-11-01 00:41:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @james_penrod I don’t know why you’re so confident.  I wish I could be
1322579457505460226 2020-11-01 00:41:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @LorenSethC My son is Gen Z and his friend group are ardent Trump supporters.  Like more Republican than me. This is one of his irl best friends.  They all made sure they voted  https://t.co/A4OBKFOugN
1322578750547070979 2020-11-01 00:38:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @atomickristin @Gormogons As soon as it gets cooler here, I’m making it.  It sounds so good for fall
1322578497907445760 2020-11-01 00:37:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Right but he has to speak every once in a while.  He is just always a mess
1322578310900158466 2020-11-01 00:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin This is going to be my yard work entertainment in a few minutes
1322578168994213889 2020-11-01 00:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @LorenSethC Definitely the liberal millennials and the boomers who think Biden can cure a virus
1322578038966636546 2020-11-01 00:35:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @atomickristin @Gormogons That sounds really good!
1322577952425598976 2020-11-01 00:35:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod He barely did anything. I don’t know how he could have done less
1322577811236966400 2020-11-01 00:34:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @james_penrod But I think Biden is going to win
1322577511180623873 2020-11-01 00:33:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin Oh now I want to listen
1322577257869778945 2020-11-01 00:32:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1322577040223178753 2020-11-01 00:31:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ @atomickristin @Gormogons I haven’t done that yet!!
1322576966176903169 2020-11-01 00:31:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Probably very likely
1322576154486808576 2020-11-01 00:28:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Important! There was a mail back up and that’s a problem, but only 7 ballots in the back up
1322575742564208640 2020-11-01 00:26:43 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s easy to be “error free” when you don’t allow the candidate out of the house and the media never asks questions
1322572113270710272 2020-11-01 00:12:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin @Gormogons Boiled eggs!!

1322542703763202053 2020-10-31 22:15:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Melania was deeply private &amp; didn’t tell her own stories says the woman who was supposed to be her best friend but sold her out for a book.  Looks like Melania had a solid read on her.  https://t.co/9km9VjDblL
1322541619531440128 2020-10-31 22:11:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I love women supporting women.  Gosh, it’s so beautiful and uplifting and inspiring.  I can’t wait to show my teen daughter this beautiful display of women cheering for the success of other women!! ❤️🥰😍😘 You’re an inspiration, Anita!!
1322541007284641795 2020-10-31 22:08:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @Chris_arnade it feels like this paragraph from this Atlantic article is why we got Trump.  https://t.co/Mw1kReGllB
1322535882214248448 2020-10-31 21:48:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba How fun!!! What a cutie!!!
1322535749267456000 2020-10-31 21:47:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, of course.  Those of us who work on school choice advocacy know every time you find a Dem adamantly opposed to school choice, you’ll find a Dem who sends their own kids to private school.  Every time.

1322529738041315331 2020-10-31 21:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait.. I thought you wanted to defund police.  Why didn’t you call a social worker?
1322529549561876481 2020-10-31 21:23:10 +0800 <just_mindy> We are celebrating Halloween in Florida so Dr. Eric must have a frog in his pocket

1322289975212331010 2020-10-31 05:31:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @RuthlessPodcast Fair enough.
1322285939394306048 2020-10-31 05:15:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp Yes, every day
1322282501570732034 2020-10-31 05:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp I’ve never had it but the fried shrimp and lobster bisque there are out of this world.  I bet it’s good
1322279727382626304 2020-10-31 04:50:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity 🤣🤣🤣
1322279682465767424 2020-10-31 04:50:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Exactly

1322277591164878856 2020-10-31 04:41:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Hopefully the final act for both in politics
1322277375342710784 2020-10-31 04:41:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly!!  She’s like “we will hold the line”.  Mam. These 2 counties are full of young Republicans with large trucks, arsenals &amp; survival skills. Your golf cart is laughable.
1322276196625879040 2020-10-31 04:36:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 Me too
1322275924864323592 2020-10-31 04:35:21 +0800 <just_mindy> And he is now persona non grata turncoat.  People spiral.  It’s sad.
1322275396725936132 2020-10-31 04:33:15 +0800 <just_mindy> A bit of a geography lesson. “The Villages” is located in very very very red Lake &amp; Sumter counties in Florida. Therefore, this lady in the article isn’t going to do shit if Trump wins. She really needs to heed her rhetoric.  That’s how nonsense gets started.
1322273514418786305 2020-10-31 04:25:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Pretty much
1322267306802745349 2020-10-31 04:01:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 I’m so worried
1322267210774175745 2020-10-31 04:00:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Another day, another fail for the anti-Semitic leadership in NYC 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
1322266560426377216 2020-10-31 03:58:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Very true
1322266475563024389 2020-10-31 03:57:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Favorite line from the new @RuthlessPodcast epi: “sir, the Lincoln Project is not a charity”.  😩😂😉🤣 Also, important to note that Kissin Cal tapped his side piece in his own house so that makes him extra ew.
1322265421349900290 2020-10-31 03:53:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 I did see that.  I don’t know how to feel
1322261148440449027 2020-10-31 03:36:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1322260636458471424 2020-10-31 03:34:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  That’s really bizarre
1322260047834030081 2020-10-31 03:32:16 +0800 <just_mindy> True. His erection coverage was riveting

1322240430851969025 2020-10-31 02:14:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMSombrio I hope so
1322238770624815104 2020-10-31 02:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMSombrio There are too many R’s and people in their 30-40’s who don’t like Trump as a person and can’t get beyond that.  They are cutting off their nose to spite their face but they think Joe is nice and kind and that is all they care about.  I’m hearing it from friend after friend

1322236547643617281 2020-10-31 01:58:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Yes.  I was talking to my boyfriend about this.  For some reason, there is a large number of Repubs who think Trump could have done more
1322232908954951681 2020-10-31 01:44:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists I agree
1322232854928121856 2020-10-31 01:44:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno I hope not

1322175107880673283 2020-10-30 21:54:45 +0800 <just_mindy> In case any pale ginger people feel attacked, this is the fruit of my very loins and I love him more than any other human on this planet (equal to my daughter) so I love white ginger people. So does AOC apparently but then she says how bad white men are so I’m confused.  https://t.co/10V8IS50nK

1322173502062026752 2020-10-30 21:48:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Except Republicans don’t call for putting rich people in the guillotine.  That’s the difference.
1322173295412813824 2020-10-30 21:47:33 +0800 <just_mindy> This whole “let’s kill the proles &amp; the white patriarchy sucks” while you pose in $6,000 suits in fashion magazines and your partner is the whitest white ginger besides my own son I’ve ever seen, is what is actually a gimmick.

1321989407851819009 2020-10-30 09:36:50 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s hot in Florida.  People get overheated. There is always people that overheat at any event.  We live in a swamp.  The firefighters (my son is one) can handle it and are paid to do this.  Take a deep breath.

1321885092768292864 2020-10-30 02:42:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I want to!!! I’m scared!!
1321884837364584449 2020-10-30 02:41:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden continues to say “we aren’t going to close down the economy.  We are going to close down the virus” yet has no plan for shutting down the virus.  Has anyone in the press ever asked Biden what he means?
1321884134806069250 2020-10-30 02:38:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @BruceExotic We’ve discussed the danger of crossing the streams

1321849557370679296 2020-10-30 00:21:07 +0800 <just_mindy> No one cares if athletes go on their personal social media and express their political feelings.  No one wants it shoved down their throats while we are watching sports for fun.

1321842275496923137 2020-10-29 23:52:11 +0800 <just_mindy> As an also obviously not true conservative, it bothers me that votes can be counted for 9 days.

1321840756261294081 2020-10-29 23:46:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Focus on the good ahead!
1321840523951378432 2020-10-29 23:45:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem Definitely pray for Biden and his team.  The reason for this series, however, was her impression from the Holy Spirit there were specific schemes &amp; threats against Trump individually.

1321838249770426368 2020-10-29 23:36:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets @mattbearnest And Biden isn’t offering anything Trump hasn’t done

1321827703247482881 2020-10-29 22:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq Exactly.  Which would entail wanting to keep a conservative Senate as a check and balance on the executive which they don’t want.  So they’re Dems

1321810099099324417 2020-10-29 21:44:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Yes.  I believe many more kids will be in school after the election
1321803519867977728 2020-10-29 21:18:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Guess what? School boards are beholden to citizens. Demand they reopen the schools.  We know this is awful for kids, we know it is increasing suicide rates, abuse rates, poverty as parents can’t work and it’s FOR NOTHING.  School is safe for kids.
1321803016924782593 2020-10-29 21:16:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Schools in Florida are going on 3 months in school, kids wear masks, staff cleans, we have sports and normalish lives.  It is STUNNING parents across this country aren’t demanding schools reopen immediately.
1321802426161254400 2020-10-29 21:13:50 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend lives in Memphis, TN &amp; her kids are still not back in school.  There is a plan for them to go back soon and the plan was shared with the families.  It is asinine.  This is the high school plan.  https://t.co/ClHx3UNcmD

1321547421671919616 2020-10-29 04:20:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @buckeye328 Truth
1321542638781300742 2020-10-29 04:01:32 +0800 <just_mindy> If Jill was decent, she would stop calling herself “Dr” while discussing COVID leaving people with the impression she is a medical professional.
1321542097808359424 2020-10-29 03:59:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, Florida is completely open because our Governor isn’t a tyrant and decided to do the right thing for the people of Florida
1321541672346505216 2020-10-29 03:57:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Because our media is a succubus of DNC disinformation designed to depress voters up until the election so they vote for Biden in a desperate bid for normalcy.  Our Media doesn’t exist to provide Americans with facts. It’s propaganda.

1321525770381131776 2020-10-29 02:54:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 I’ll check it out!!
1321524741627383809 2020-10-29 02:50:25 +0800 <just_mindy> There are absolutely easy answers.  Florida (the third largest state in the US) has been back in school for 10 weeks and there have been no major outbreaks.  Kids wear masks.  There is virtual options for families who choose to not do Face to Face.  Open up schools.
1321523114413563905 2020-10-29 02:43:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan @KatMcKinley Exactly
1321523020175974403 2020-10-29 02:43:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 Oh I would have liked to see that
1321516011733078021 2020-10-29 02:15:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Yes.  I hated it when she left. But it was getting constant so I understood
1321515567661092866 2020-10-29 02:13:58 +0800 <just_mindy> And no “why does the patriarchy get a say” replies.  BF has to make out with me so he gets a say, my son is young and knows what looks good and I have respect for my dad. Don’t get pressed about it
1321515158976536579 2020-10-29 02:12:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Speaking of small hoop nose piercings, I really want one. Major changes to my lewk get run by my BF, son and Dad.  BF and son are good with it, my Dad is adamantly opposed so I’m not doing it while he’s sick.  I will one day though
1321514243011825671 2020-10-29 02:08:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @datawatts Using term loosely
1321512523653328896 2020-10-29 02:01:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley The Lincoln Project and that old Buckley whatever group were endlessly harassing her

1321512085742899200 2020-10-29 02:00:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I like a small hoop nose piercing on women. Not so much on a man. Sorry, Jack.
1321511739901566976 2020-10-29 01:58:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Orlandodanny Let’s hope it holds!!!
1321511704921051136 2020-10-29 01:58:37 +0800 <just_mindy> This is one good sign!!!!
1321511056511041540 2020-10-29 01:56:03 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re a Democrat.  Thank you for letting us know you vote for who Democrats vote for.
1321507689709637632 2020-10-29 01:42:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity ❤️❤️
1321502538886242304 2020-10-29 01:22:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan Thank you!!
1321501737744781314 2020-10-29 01:19:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally you can early vote anywhere in your county.  It doesn’t have to be just your usual precinct. Bring acceptable ID.  You can wear candidate gear as long as you are not soliciting votes.
1321500823466246144 2020-10-29 01:15:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Only mail in ballots received in the SOE office by 7:00 pm on Election Day will be counted in Florida.
1321500562479828993 2020-10-29 01:14:21 +0800 <just_mindy> If you see/ hear people offering to take MORE THAN 2 other mail in ballots to drop off boxes, that could be ballot harvesting and is against the law in Fl.  Take screenshots and call your Supervisor of Elections office.  You can return ballots legally in Fl for up to 2 other ppl
1321499913046425600 2020-10-29 01:11:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Ask your friends and your adult kids, y’all.  The world is nuts and not everyone is as plugged in to politics as you.  You can turn it up to 2 ballots for other people in drop boxes in Fl.  Ask your friend if you can drop theirs off if you know they are busy.
1321499358085500928 2020-10-29 01:09:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Right now, Republicans have over 600k ballots out.  We can’t let those votes be lost.  Trump won by mid 100k in 2016.
1321499046683545601 2020-10-29 01:08:19 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, if you requested a ballot and now want to vote in person, you can.  BRING THE BALLOT TO YOUR POLLING PLACE and surrender it and you can vote in person.
1321498677010194433 2020-10-29 01:06:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida friends:  if you are planning to vote by mail and have not returned it, PLEASE take it to a drop off box and then track it on your Supervisor of Election site.  Make sure it is received and counted.  DO NOT MAIL IT NOW. It might not make it in time.
1321480246403747843 2020-10-28 23:53:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chimp_HQ Yes.  Terribly cruel.  Thank you so much and prayers for your friend as well.
1321478796441169921 2020-10-28 23:47:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s also be honest that as people cut the cord, sites like Twitter and FB become the place people get news.  It’s the place government officials communicate with the public.  It’s not just a social media site any longer.
1321478143060905988 2020-10-28 23:45:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Hire actual conservatives

1321254339860680706 2020-10-28 08:55:56 +0800 <just_mindy> The Media knows Biden is crooked af. They will drag him across the finish line so he can pardon who needs to be, and then insist he step down for Kamala to enact her leftist agenda a/ glee. They just need to hide stuff fr voters for 6 more days.
1321252721731768320 2020-10-28 08:49:31 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Miami Dade and Broward will be closer than people think because school choice is always on the ballot in Florida and people love their schools.  I know Biden lost most cops and FF families in Fl during riots. All in all, go vote!!!
1321252297654046722 2020-10-28 08:47:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I believe we are cannibalizing some E day turnout.  I believe some Repubs will defect.  I believe Dems encouraging early voting by mail is a mistake as even if 1% are discarded, that could be 100k votes. I think Latino vote for Trump is higher than people think.

1321115836204068865 2020-10-27 23:45:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Impossible for her as she has never been classy
1321109788143554560 2020-10-27 23:21:33 +0800 <just_mindy> A woman, Monique McClean, who I follow and consider a spiritual mentor, has asked Christians to join with her in praying specific prayers over POTUS over the next week.  I believe prayer is powerful, affirmative, &amp; uniting.  If you do, join in!  https://t.co/0duNzQxBFP
1321094667795156993 2020-10-27 22:21:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Because the court isn’t a legislative branch where securing the majority is the goal.  Our concern should be securing judges who hold fidelity to the Constitution. Also, it pains me to know school systems are taking money meant to help kids and paying you for Zoom scolding.
1321094100913922048 2020-10-27 22:19:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida and LA are LITRALLY swamps.  Leave us and our AC alone

1321091791697911810 2020-10-27 22:10:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 I think there is some hidden Latino and AA support pollsters are missing.  I say this because at Trump events I attend, over half the attendees are Latino.
1321089626761842688 2020-10-27 22:01:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  Republicans killed it at EV yesterday.
1321089167334531075 2020-10-27 21:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 And Trump fatigue but the media contributed to that as well
1321088733358284802 2020-10-27 21:57:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Nobody has this wrapped up.  If you have a AB, take it to EV site and drop it in a box.
1321088202086764545 2020-10-27 21:55:46 +0800 <just_mindy> This is what we need to see.  We expect to go into E day in a deficit but we need it lower.  This is progress.
1321087713496412164 2020-10-27 21:53:50 +0800 <just_mindy> This!!

1321083839763107842 2020-10-27 21:38:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Too bad the name Crooked Media is already taken.  That’s a shame.
1321083485663219713 2020-10-27 21:37:02 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t know but I have the worst cramps right now, so if someone wants to come snatch my fertility, I won’t even put up a fight.

1320895861006704640 2020-10-27 09:11:28 +0800 <just_mindy> CNN &amp; MSNBC broke away and are not covering the swearing in of ACB.  How petty.

1320885066680205317 2020-10-27 08:28:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi says they can’t make a deal with Republicans on coronavirus because Republicans won’t agree “to crush the virus”. I know this sounds dumb but she and Chris Hayes are running with it.
1320884538923536385 2020-10-27 08:26:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi on @chrislhayes stating she agrees with packing the Supreme Court but she also wants to add additional district courts

1320876883681124359 2020-10-27 07:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @daveweigel who was interviewing him here so we have context as to why he can’t articulate a sentence
1320875380773978116 2020-10-27 07:50:06 +0800 <just_mindy> What you don’t understand is he was being interviewed by George Lopez and that context was important for why he once again makes no sense
1320872730158338048 2020-10-27 07:39:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 It was so cute
1320871688356188167 2020-10-27 07:35:25 +0800 <just_mindy> My girl Bristol Palin is working on a Pro Life - Pro Gun - Pro God sweatshirt and your girl is here for it.  It will be on Mindy’s Christmas list in several colors.  That is all.

1320869806837583875 2020-10-27 07:27:57 +0800 <just_mindy> And Navarro was on Biden’s concert last night with full Biden regalia, hosting the show, with a full Biden step &amp; repeat behind her.  She wants to be a Dem.
1320868380832866305 2020-10-27 07:22:17 +0800 <just_mindy> He sees that.  That’s just an inconvenient point

1320862677045022720 2020-10-27 06:59:37 +0800 <just_mindy> With the current media environment serving as an arm for the DNC? Nope.  Sure is not. We would get Romney or McCain losses over and over again.  You can’t send the Beav out to deal with this Media
1320861702875942912 2020-10-27 06:55:45 +0800 <just_mindy> I need you to find out what “originalism” means before you make this comment and expose your ignorance.

1320854635318575109 2020-10-27 06:27:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes, them lying and you swearing to it is embarrassing

1320840055922085895 2020-10-27 05:29:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @tramblin_man Right!?  That still makes no sense

1320839444014997504 2020-10-27 05:27:18 +0800 <just_mindy> “4 more years of George uh” isn’t the improvement you think it is.
1320838564150759424 2020-10-27 05:23:48 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my son’s friends just poked his head in my front door and said  “Ms. Mindy, I wanted to tell you I just voted and I voted all  Republican”.  I thought that was the cutest.

1320659339833708544 2020-10-26 17:31:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Ahhhh.... the new verbiage leftists will use to destroy an institution of government is: rebalancing.  Fascinating.  Also? Filling open seats isn’t court packing &amp; Mitch is able to do so because of Harry Reid nuking the filibuster. Direct your angst to him.
1320658551505887233 2020-10-26 17:28:29 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re right.  You don’t understand American governance.
1320654642297131009 2020-10-26 17:12:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Clearly Biden is recalling 08 when he and Obama were positioning themselves as the antidote to 8 year of of GWB.  This is really sad and again, I can’t believe people won’t acknowledge what is right before their eyes.

1320521706176454656 2020-10-26 08:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. The refusal of Democrats to confirm a highly qualified woman just because she won’t agree to suspend her own cognitive ability is extreme misogyny and very telling
1320519118257332225 2020-10-26 08:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> All the “Joe is getting his message out virtually because he doesn’t want to have big crowds in a pandemic” ignore he is sending out Kamala &amp; Obama in person to have in person rallies. So it’s ok for them to risk their lives but not Joe? Seems racist, tbh.

1320479436173643778 2020-10-26 05:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> So who knew @HawleyMO could preach? Listening to him now at the worship service on the National Mall &amp; he’s incredible.

1320473618816638976 2020-10-26 05:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @skippyisanidiot Me too!!
1320473534511108098 2020-10-26 05:13:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @puzzzld Exactly.  He has gone above and beyond what I expected
1320471882739703808 2020-10-26 05:06:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @RevConwell That’s not bad!
1320471353829560322 2020-10-26 05:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @RevConwell I might have to
1320469198418706432 2020-10-26 04:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Stupid question, I know
1320469123953033217 2020-10-26 04:55:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @SharkSandwhich That’s fair

1320468280109400066 2020-10-26 04:52:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also @RaheemKassam just offered to let Ben view the materials so there you go
1320467936004505602 2020-10-26 04:51:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Why would a search warrant be necessary? The laptop was the property of the shop owner &amp; he brought it to the FBI and reported what he saw.  The FBI  then had reasonable suspicion
1320466625200590849 2020-10-26 04:45:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Why does she look like a Marvel villain?
1320466123930914817 2020-10-26 04:43:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Oh yes!  That drives me nuts too
1320466000022851590 2020-10-26 04:43:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five I just thought supply would be back by now

1320465842191147014 2020-10-26 04:42:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom Exactly and no one knows who you are other than Cardi B’s husband
1320465512170725377 2020-10-26 04:41:25 +0800 <just_mindy> He should be focused on getting tested for STD’s.  Also if he was my husband, he would be real worried about health care after he caught these hands
1320464867887894532 2020-10-26 04:38:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel It’s so annoying
1320464485572845570 2020-10-26 04:37:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Bucs!
1320462151291686913 2020-10-26 04:28:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Maybe I should check at the Spanish grocery.  Good idea!
1320461682230124546 2020-10-26 04:26:12 +0800 <just_mindy> He and Cardi are getting divorced so he needed attention
1320461492077142019 2020-10-26 04:25:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chestertweet I shouldn’t be

1320456541959577607 2020-10-26 04:05:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth I was at BJ’s and Publix.  It was crazy

1320456417036390401 2020-10-26 04:05:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrDavidDaniels I don’t know what is up?!

1320456191588372482 2020-10-26 04:04:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @bradcundiff Had to go to 3 stores for my dog’s food
1320456085506035713 2020-10-26 04:03:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @ByronHoffman6 Yes!! It’s crazy!
1320453086100574210 2020-10-26 03:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Is anyone else noticing paper towel shortages again.  And pet food?

1320414967489826816 2020-10-26 01:20:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Passport is a legal form of ID to vote in Florida.  What is wrong with you lately, Mark?

My Dad also has cancer and there is zero possibility I would argue politics with him right now.  This young woman needs to get a grip.
1320409943883874306 2020-10-26 01:00:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Mauty480 ❤️❤️
1320409613641125888 2020-10-26 00:59:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump is frying to steal the election which is why he is asking his people to vote in person.  Makes sense.

1320342113335320580 2020-10-25 20:31:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Your daily reminder that Joe and Faux Dr. Jill are not good nor fine people as they continue to pretend their youngest grandchild doesn’t exist even after definitive DNA tests.  😘😘
1320341771038167041 2020-10-25 20:29:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Exactly and I know many families, where the child wasn’t accepted by the parent, but because the grandparents had more life experience, they embraced the child.  It shouldn’t matter what Hunter does. If Joe and Jill were “fine people”, they would embrace the child

1320340410733121538 2020-10-25 20:24:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @CaseyMattox_ So kind of you, Casey
1320339707151196160 2020-10-25 20:21:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Reminder, if you early voted in Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota, and the Biden revelations are making you regret your vote, you can change your early vote.
1320338606255472640 2020-10-25 20:17:09 +0800 <just_mindy> I finally went to sleep at like 3 am
1320336829472821248 2020-10-25 20:10:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba My son was working yesterday so he was at the fire department but the rest of us went crazy here!! Lol
1320333812056924160 2020-10-25 19:58:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @neontaster No one and he never will again

1320252307091705856 2020-10-25 14:34:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD ❤️❤️
1320245322724102145 2020-10-25 14:06:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @mattbearnest Yes, exactly
1320245240847097856 2020-10-25 14:06:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Exactly
1320242959510609920 2020-10-25 13:57:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I shouldn’t have
1320242193504866304 2020-10-25 13:54:02 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s so beautiful
1320241199123435521 2020-10-25 13:50:05 +0800 <just_mindy> and this is why you should go to your voting booth and make sure these people don’t get any more power
1320238473052377088 2020-10-25 13:39:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Duh  https://t.co/sTg9zQm886

1320237514427334657 2020-10-25 13:35:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest So nice and cozy and Aw shucks
1320235054698737664 2020-10-25 13:25:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I don’t get that either
1320234997752729600 2020-10-25 13:25:26 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s not the child’s fault Biden’s son is a louse.  Biden should be better than this
1320234725357817856 2020-10-25 13:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I can’t figure that out but the baby is only like 2 and he says his youngest is 16
1320234548232335365 2020-10-25 13:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez ❤️❤️❤️ I love when we agree
1320234382666457088 2020-10-25 13:23:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This is so galling to me. They made the mom get a DNA test.  She did.  The child is his Biden’s grandchild.  Acknowledge that child!
1320233295930675200 2020-10-25 13:18:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 So true!!!!

1320232222125936640 2020-10-25 13:14:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir @RaysBaseball @kayleighmcenany Still a lot of baseball to go
1320232153825873920 2020-10-25 13:14:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 😂😂😂
1320231992672329729 2020-10-25 13:13:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I just adore that man.
1320231886569046017 2020-10-25 13:13:05 +0800 <just_mindy> So one last sappy post. I was really missing my guy today &amp; wanted him with me.  He said this morning “I’m not there today but I promise you a UCF and a Rays win”.  The whole Rays game he kept saying “I promised you a win”.  This was our text after:  https://t.co/CEyJLpzpIg
1320230301826768896 2020-10-25 13:06:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon Me too!
1320228936358440960 2020-10-25 13:01:21 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ll take it!  And his Press Sec husband is part of the Rays org so it’s even more fitting!!!
1320225509796708355 2020-10-25 12:47:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Gosh I wish that win would have happened in the Trop
1320224405528715271 2020-10-25 12:43:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist That’s the crazy thing
1320224336222060545 2020-10-25 12:43:04 +0800 <just_mindy> My son’s text to me about the @RaysBaseball “We have the magic”.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I told him it’s because @kayleighmcenany husband is part of the Rays org, and the Lord favors Republicans 😂😂🤣☺️ I was kidding.  Relax.  Kind of.
1320223502843154433 2020-10-25 12:39:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 I get it!
1320223337545666560 2020-10-25 12:39:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL Ha!!! I get it!
1320223282478698496 2020-10-25 12:38:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist Insane!! My son said “we have the magic”
1320223215407501314 2020-10-25 12:38:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL The Rays win!
1320222585406279681 2020-10-25 12:36:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 🥺
1320221949117796354 2020-10-25 12:33:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!!
1320220588271689728 2020-10-25 12:28:11 +0800 <just_mindy> My Rays and my Knights won today!
1320220469425995776 2020-10-25 12:27:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @chetmorton Oh my word!!
1320219237567389696 2020-10-25 12:22:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m crying.  My son is at the fire station so I’m sure he just woke everyone up
1320216663049064450 2020-10-25 12:12:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @9mmbetterthan45 Oh yea
1320204280255610881 2020-10-25 11:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m @irishspy @Crapplefratz @GaybibiBruce @BKudron Good point
1320203270044962816 2020-10-25 11:19:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @davidcmeyer Thank you!!
1320203070085660672 2020-10-25 11:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @Crapplefratz @GaybibiBruce @BKudron Yes.  That is also a huge concern
1320201448962088963 2020-10-25 11:12:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @davidcmeyer My cousin has had zero symptoms.  My dad’s friend is recovering well at home thankfully
1320201229599985664 2020-10-25 11:11:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno  https://t.co/LJbb7C2iu7
1320201045029670913 2020-10-25 11:10:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Exactly!!! They know where their bread is buttered
1320200742876205060 2020-10-25 11:09:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Right? Omggg, Pence’s staff has a virus!!!!
1320200615776182275 2020-10-25 11:08:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Do you think George Cowway wants to lose the income his wife brings in? Puh-lease.  He’s not going to short his alimony that way.  Would be cutting off his teat to spite his ginormous face.
1320200236749459456 2020-10-25 11:07:19 +0800 <just_mindy> They probably dropped their mail in ballots in the mail the first minute they could voting straight R
1320200023682985984 2020-10-25 11:06:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist I have smelling salts
1320199891344384000 2020-10-25 11:05:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Lincoln Project is hoping for a Trump win way more than you or I. If Trump loses, Dems aren’t interested in them.They’ve proven themselves traitors.  They are pariah to GOP so no job there either.  They need a Trump win to finish shoring up their retirement cushion for 4 years.
1320198279850827776 2020-10-25 10:59:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m My dad used to be that way too lol
1320197706158059520 2020-10-25 10:57:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Breaking:  my dad’s best friend has coronavirus as well as my little cousin at college
1320196714544963591 2020-10-25 10:53:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m It’s so good
1320195377866412035 2020-10-25 10:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This Rays game tho
1320194721973735424 2020-10-25 10:45:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Couldn’t have said it better
1320194245588881409 2020-10-25 10:43:30 +0800 <just_mindy> A pink Oxford or a pink Hilfiger or Polo is 👅
1320194033847762948 2020-10-25 10:42:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes
1320193512739098624 2020-10-25 10:40:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 Or STD’s
1320193460868173824 2020-10-25 10:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @yeshuaislord3 @melifix @irishspy Exactly.   Let him go out as a beloved VP.  This shouldn’t have been his legacy
1320190300908900357 2020-10-25 10:27:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Crapplefratz @GaybibiBruce @BKudron @irishspy Yes! I hear so many people say they are this with their own family member
1320189386026328066 2020-10-25 10:24:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark I will never know
1320189322600075264 2020-10-25 10:23:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 @melifix I think that is a distinct possibility
1320188520028405768 2020-10-25 10:20:45 +0800 <just_mindy> The Villages is a huge retirement village. Probably more than 12 people died yesterday
1320187835689897987 2020-10-25 10:18:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix @irishspy Very sad and I almost wonder if that’s why you don’t see his daughter or Jill’s kids campaigning more.  They don’t agree with this
1320186997315698690 2020-10-25 10:14:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix I for sure get that
1320186858576502784 2020-10-25 10:14:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @BKudron Yes
1320185412233592832 2020-10-25 10:08:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @irishspy Yes.  For his wife particularly to participate in this sham is really hard to watch
1320185265072254979 2020-10-25 10:07:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @johncalvarado That’s awesome!!

1320184376475422720 2020-10-25 10:04:17 +0800 <just_mindy> I love Hunter Renfroe
1320183710206099457 2020-10-25 10:01:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy It’s so evident
1320183592673251329 2020-10-25 10:01:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix Say more.  You’re an empath and intuitive
1320182441835900928 2020-10-25 09:56:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Right?  She hit the jackpot
1320182338341474304 2020-10-25 09:56:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany @aurora_g96 @justanurse25 I try but she is so sneaky.  And too cute so all the boys are always around

1320181906458161152 2020-10-25 09:54:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep.  They’re voting for Kamala
1320181842272833537 2020-10-25 09:54:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 Indeed

1320181112145170432 2020-10-25 09:51:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 I’m not blocked yet, just unfollowed
1320180977453441024 2020-10-25 09:50:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod He shouldn’t be
1320180877297700864 2020-10-25 09:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 🤣🤣 I’m sure it says something about my mental state
1320180701732478978 2020-10-25 09:49:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD @SME_In_Italy Oh I’ve voted, my parents voted, and my son voted
1320180279928029184 2020-10-25 09:48:01 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said, I want to give good ness too
1320179948783620097 2020-10-25 09:46:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @SME_In_Italy @GameOnJD I don’t feel that in my bones rn.
1320179800959569920 2020-10-25 09:46:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is still funny
1320179559204065280 2020-10-25 09:45:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Bill Kristol unfollowed me.  Time to bring back #holdmeJohnKasich
1320179216080605184 2020-10-25 09:43:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v @GameOnJD I want to be wrong and I’m a pessimist so we will see
1320179119393562626 2020-10-25 09:43:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I want anyone considering voting for Biden to go listen to him speak in 2016 and then now.  It is a marked difference and it isn’t a stutter.
1320178781651374080 2020-10-25 09:42:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It’s def me in 2020
1320178737745362950 2020-10-25 09:41:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Good!! The popular vote matters to the narrative
1320178620074201088 2020-10-25 09:41:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Love that man
1320177961086181376 2020-10-25 09:38:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Oh same
1320177788234702848 2020-10-25 09:38:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1320177642545565697 2020-10-25 09:37:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Def an FU contingent in the Trump vote
1320177218786557952 2020-10-25 09:35:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG @JohnEkdahl Ok I couldn’t remember if you were a Johnson voter like me in 2016
1320177047310798849 2020-10-25 09:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD I’m skeptical Trump will win.  I don’t think independents are breaking for Trump.  But we’ll see
1320176899398709249 2020-10-25 09:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth That would be a beautiful thing
1320176836173811713 2020-10-25 09:34:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 He’s a Kentucky man through and through
1320175245811240960 2020-10-25 09:28:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @ADowling34 @MarcACaputo @ryan_tyson I have seen plenty from Marc about Biden being able to win here. There was an article this morning or yesterday that totally depressed me.  He’s called balls and strikes
1320174808764645382 2020-10-25 09:26:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I am a Floridian who didn’t vote Trump in 2016 as is @JohnEkdahl and maybe @NiedsG and plan to in 2020.  I think there are many of us.
1320174493885661184 2020-10-25 09:25:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m still skeptical but I think his Hispanic numbers are way closer to what we will see than other pollsters are predicting.  I say that because when I go to Trump events, nearly half the crowd is Hispanic. I think his AA is actually low and might be more like 12%
1320172662258270208 2020-10-25 09:17:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Gosh, he’s so good
1320171071102963716 2020-10-25 09:11:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth I meant specifically people hanging out in Times Square where the ads are
1320168381308375040 2020-10-25 09:00:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Truth.  No one is actually visiting there right now and everyone in New York is already voting for Biden.
1320167733544275968 2020-10-25 08:58:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric  https://t.co/bjmRQX5UyK

1320154127192739842 2020-10-25 08:04:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @AdamR2973 So glad it isn’t just me
1320153965770756097 2020-10-25 08:03:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, this isn’t commentary on my financial status.  I’m blessed by my family’s hard work to live where I do and it has nothing to do with my own accomplishments. I was dealt a good hand
1320153605060677632 2020-10-25 08:02:01 +0800 <just_mindy> These kinds of posts always make me laugh because I live on what is termed “millionaire’s row” in my town, and 3/4 of the houses have Trump signs and exactly zero have Biden signs.  So is there some sociological message there too?

1320109903168573440 2020-10-25 05:08:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest We have had a lot of rain lately but still, there are lots of days to vote
1320104654013857792 2020-10-25 04:47:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I need a fact check
1320102702387503104 2020-10-25 04:39:45 +0800 <just_mindy> My mom was born in Key West and my grandfather was a Pastor there.  One of their favorite parishioners was a Cuban man and he gave all my grandparent’s kids their middle names.  That’s how my mom has the middle name Edilia ❤️❤️
1320100954713280512 2020-10-25 04:32:48 +0800 <just_mindy> And we are fine with that
1320100421843800065 2020-10-25 04:30:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I think you should drag God into court and prosecute Him for making it rain.  Also? There is like 9 more days of early voting if people didn’t want to wait in line

1320039277959516162 2020-10-25 00:27:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Sweetie, the divisiveness started long before Trump.  Y’all just aren’t used to a Republican fighting back.
1320038999986216962 2020-10-25 00:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Can not name one thing Trump has done to make him a authoritarian 👇🏼
1320038384627232768 2020-10-25 00:24:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Grifters always find easy marks
1320038043563286532 2020-10-25 00:22:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m told they are the best at what they do and the GOP will come crawling to them in 2022 to help win back the Senate because they are so effective.
1320027485141164032 2020-10-24 23:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg They’re targeting Senators who did what their constituents sent them to do.  Not many people get to make careers off of what they did 10 years ago with little to no success since then but you do you.  I mean Palin was the last big campaign for Steve. Give me a break
1320020479898488837 2020-10-24 23:13:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg If Trump loses, it won’t be because of them.  It will be because of himself.  To be good at what you do, you need to win campaigns. That’s the metric. They don’t.  They’re good at being grifters. I’ll hand that to them.  They may have more in common with Trump than they think
1320019385017389056 2020-10-24 23:08:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Found the person the email was literally about

1320016421305393152 2020-10-24 22:56:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes and that is why they should never ever ever have a home in the GOP again

1319878987934519299 2020-10-24 13:50:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes yes yes
1319878883555115010 2020-10-24 13:50:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Thank you!! 11 years of school choice policy and I can spit it out quick now
1319876412401135618 2020-10-24 13:40:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton ❤️❤️❤️
1319876368423899136 2020-10-24 13:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Thank you
1319876326619336704 2020-10-24 13:40:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF It’s such a hard thing.  I totally agree
1319876166858268672 2020-10-24 13:39:34 +0800 <just_mindy> And their parents will start demanding tax scholarships for private schools like we have in Florida.
1319875887899226112 2020-10-24 13:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I promise you if @realDonaldTrump signed an EO tomorrow diverting these funds to any state not open by 12/1 or whatever arbitrary date, Governors would open schools again stat.  Why? Because they know if kids get in private schools they like, they won’t go back to public
1319875456724848642 2020-10-24 13:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember, states like Florida wouldn’t need to participate since kids are back in school so we are only talking about kids in states where Governors refuse to follow the Science and the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatricians.
1319875052742037505 2020-10-24 13:35:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Currently the federal government provides about 79 billion dollars per year to states for education.  The average private school tuition is 10,000 dollars.  That means about 8 million kids could be served by this program and be out of a failing Zoom system
1319873236134395905 2020-10-24 13:27:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Very true
1319873155041722368 2020-10-24 13:27:36 +0800 <just_mindy> If you have the schools apply in batches on behalf of new students, it should be rather cut and dry. Have a list of approved private schools prepared by the Gov. office in the state, those schools advertise number of open slots, then school completes paper work for funding
1319872587019784193 2020-10-24 13:25:21 +0800 <just_mindy> There would be some abuse of the system obviously but if you only allow reputable private or charters to participate, it would be minimal.  The tiny risk of fraud is worth it for most kids to have options at this point
1319872110840500224 2020-10-24 13:23:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton They should have to go on record opposing her for no reason
1319871855700938752 2020-10-24 13:22:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF That’s why the option of using tax dollars at private schools is appealing
1319871640231137281 2020-10-24 13:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Private schools can tell federal govt “we have 35 new students” and offer verification signed by parent.  The check can go directly to the school to cover student tuition. This is basically how we handle corporate scholarships in Florida.
1319871092337631232 2020-10-24 13:19:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Any school system not making plans to reopen should lose  federal funding and parents should be able to seek grants for those funds to send their child to private school.  Alternatively, the federal govt can allow private schools to apply on behalf of new enrollees to streamline
1319870368505647107 2020-10-24 13:16:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Children are being left alone, abused, not properly fed, and many aren’t even signing on for school. Suicide &amp; depression rates are sky rocketing. Drug &amp; alcohol abuse is at insane levels. Divorce rates are through the roof.  This cure is way worse then COVID.
1319869656035983361 2020-10-24 13:13:42 +0800 <just_mindy> I see so many financially and mentally stable parents on Twitter at wits end about school closing. These are ppl with resources &amp; support systems. I cannot imagine what many children are facing with families who cannot offer those safety nets. Reopen schools now.
1319867161318404098 2020-10-24 13:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Thank goodness!!!
1319867049200521216 2020-10-24 13:03:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Senators earn a good salary.  There are only 2 fr each state and I assure you, there are many who would love the job &amp; would show up to work.  We should absolutely expect our elected officials to be at every meeting unless there is some emergency
1319866010623758336 2020-10-24 12:59:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I attend many meetings where I don’t agree on the agenda or outcomes. If we started docking legislator pay if they did not show up for work, I bet they would show up for work.
1319864208964673536 2020-10-24 12:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax That’s what boggles!!! I’ve been doing this for 11 years.  There are people like me who know what we are doing.  Why did districts try to recreate the wheel rather than bringing in subject matter experts to show them best practices!!
1319863731036295168 2020-10-24 12:50:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax And it’s so much better for the teacher to be available one on one or for small group in zoom rather than making all kids sit when there 65% know what to do and should be working independently
1319863239115669505 2020-10-24 12:48:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Yes you do!!! The way it’s being done now in many states is so detrimental and awful for kids!!
1319862097916940288 2020-10-24 12:43:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!!
1319862000856551425 2020-10-24 12:43:17 +0800 <just_mindy> We’ve had full day of school in Florida for 9 weeks now and zero collapses

1319805743210635264 2020-10-24 08:59:44 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to let kids go back to school. We just finished our first 9 weeks of school in Florida with minimal issues.  It is criminal to continue to keep schools closed with zero scientific evidence.  The people must stand up &amp; demand their school boards listen
1319800996005093379 2020-10-24 08:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas @danielc4liberty So Publix is now making a chicken tender with bacon , cheese, special sauce and pickles on a brioche bun in the deli.  They are on sale for 2/$6.  We got them for dinner.  So good!!!

1319781192527392769 2020-10-24 07:22:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes as long as you vote Republican when you get here

1319754622249193473 2020-10-24 05:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Tell the Senate Dems to stop filibustering then
1319753902611419137 2020-10-24 05:33:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope the rest of your family sees this behavior and recognizes you are not a trustworthy person
1319753713544822784 2020-10-24 05:32:59 +0800 <just_mindy> You are a terrible person for tweeting this about a family member.  Some things should supersede politics.

1319749180542287873 2020-10-24 05:14:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 True!
1319745646119866368 2020-10-24 05:00:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Did Joe Biden do any events today?
1319745363344052224 2020-10-24 04:59:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @MomTo6Lambs She doesn’t like any push back
1319741678262095875 2020-10-24 04:45:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @MomTo6Lambs She is.  She also blocked me.  I don’t understand pro-aborts making bombastic statements they know will draw attention yet they are unwilling to back it up when given push back
1319741365727744000 2020-10-24 04:43:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 No. I’m a proud Republican

1319721134946996224 2020-10-24 03:23:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Me too
1319713643697754112 2020-10-24 02:53:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Just listened to the first epi of Ruthless with @ComfortablySmug &amp; @HolmesJosh.  First part was super informative about the courts but the Toobin segment is what you stay for.  Hilarious.
1319712281933062145 2020-10-24 02:48:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 No I did it.  I want to be polled
1319710923855155204 2020-10-24 02:42:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Just had my first phone call poll. Tweet 2 days ago I haven’t had one ever and now I’ve had 2 in one week
1319704646299099136 2020-10-24 02:18:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 I haven’t seen it but Dems are like half a mill in the lead there
1319703744469225479 2020-10-24 02:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, can I just say, if you live in Florida, and even with everyone wearing masks, you feel the need to be the social distance police, why not absentee vote and save yourself the terror
1319702813727969280 2020-10-24 02:10:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It is.  The Cuban vote is very R though

1319701894697259014 2020-10-24 02:07:05 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is home. He got yelled at by a Biden voter for “not social distancing enough” even though he says he was &amp; everyone was wearing masks. 2 older women behind him must have felt motherly and jumped to his defense.  🤣🤣🤣 They rang a bell for him as he was a first time voter
1319696354977992706 2020-10-24 01:45:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Latest numbers for Florida!
1319692197638397952 2020-10-24 01:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge Yes.  We don’t want apathy.  That’s for sure

1319690028138770432 2020-10-24 01:19:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Will do.  He’s excited to vote
1319689367825403905 2020-10-24 01:17:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC P said the line is full of Trump voters right now
1319689252809170946 2020-10-24 01:16:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge I don’t want us to get complacent
1319689137700601856 2020-10-24 01:16:23 +0800 <just_mindy> He just texted me.  45 minute wait.  I didn’t wait at all yesterday.  He said he lots of trucks flying Trump flags and lots of folks wearing Trump gear waiting to vote.  We live in Lake County, Fl.
1319687107326205952 2020-10-24 01:08:19 +0800 <just_mindy> This article scares me
1319684313072439299 2020-10-24 00:57:13 +0800 <just_mindy> My kid just left to vote flying his Trump flags and wearing his Trump hat.  His first Presidential election.  (You can wear campaign gear into the polls in Florida as long as you are not soliciting votes)

1319678821944143873 2020-10-24 00:35:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid It’s iffy to me.  I trust the 18 year olds more than the 29 year olds lol
1319676699165032448 2020-10-24 00:26:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I can say my kid and all of his friends are 20 and all voting Republican
1319672193312325634 2020-10-24 00:09:03 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s super moderate and loves Jesus with all his heart.   Side note:  I’m a Christian who sometimes curses but like GD is a huge no no no

1319484208306376704 2020-10-23 11:42:04 +0800 <just_mindy> As a legislator, you should educate yourself about what is happening at the border, maybe

1319467744161632258 2020-10-23 10:36:39 +0800 <just_mindy> It doesn’t matter what Biden says at his inauguration because he won’t be President after 6 months.  Kamala will be &amp; that is terrifying.  #Debates2020 #DebateTonight

1319458182377447424 2020-10-23 09:58:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden better not dare act like he supports first responders.  Don’t even try that mess.  #DebateTonight #Debate2020
1319457889757659136 2020-10-23 09:57:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  My friend just said the same
1319457530142183426 2020-10-23 09:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes he really did
1319457400223637512 2020-10-23 09:55:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly right
1319457350663741442 2020-10-23 09:55:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Seems so!!
1319457308036968449 2020-10-23 09:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump is not running against Joe Biden and we all know it.  #DebateTonight #Debate2020
1319456664504979459 2020-10-23 09:52:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1319456141403918336 2020-10-23 09:50:33 +0800 <just_mindy> I lost my plan under Obamacare.  #factcheck
1319441813795635202 2020-10-23 08:53:37 +0800 <just_mindy> It feels like the deal still happened but Joe just cut out everybody except his family
1319441704299233280 2020-10-23 08:53:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL @DRussell76 @JoeBiden Exactly
1319441351499501569 2020-10-23 08:51:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle I loved watching that show with my Granny
1319440994593591302 2020-10-23 08:50:21 +0800 <just_mindy> You work for CNN.  Calm down, sis.  https://t.co/nIfnk7U911
1319440845460934658 2020-10-23 08:49:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle I was going to say she was a welker weight boxer
1319440419562946563 2020-10-23 08:48:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @MichelleInCAL @JoeBiden Yes.  It’s sad his child died but that doesn’t excuse criminal behavior

1319439066346246146 2020-10-23 08:42:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC Yesssssaa
1319439025833414656 2020-10-23 08:42:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod He had to apologize.  He knew what he was doing
1319438135118471173 2020-10-23 08:39:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC That’s the spirit!!!

1319437318063869953 2020-10-23 08:35:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC They’re in cahoots likely
1319437186098409472 2020-10-23 08:35:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod He was dead before the apology came, yes
1319436788285558789 2020-10-23 08:33:38 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t know, Bobulinski looked and sounded pretty American to me? 🤷🏼‍♀️
1319436433858375681 2020-10-23 08:32:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod A lie about the death of your wife and kid? And that ruins the life of the man you lie about? Who does that?
1319436123568037888 2020-10-23 08:31:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @SME_In_Italy I mean he really doesn’t look like a guy making millions

1319435647376117766 2020-10-23 08:29:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @tillqi I’m not sensitive.  No disrespect taken
1319435501418483718 2020-10-23 08:28:32 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not.  After finding out he lied about the man who “killed” his wife and child, when actually his wife ran a stop sign &amp; the trucker wasn’t drunk at all, showed me he was capable of anything to be power adjacent.
1319434958235205633 2020-10-23 08:26:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @N5Tiny @beyondreasdoubt Technically they are

1319405293286100992 2020-10-23 06:28:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Here’s an idea.  Ask Biden to sort it out for you
1319388110057332745 2020-10-23 05:20:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 So nerve wracking

1319385178117230594 2020-10-23 05:08:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Too_Much_Reason We need to make up that AB deficit

1319383113789853699 2020-10-23 05:00:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Political masks are allowed in polling locations.  The uniform is the problem.  You can wear political gear to vote in Florida as long as you don’t try to persuade others

1319357720726745091 2020-10-23 03:19:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow.  What a bitter cow Stahl has become
1319356933086773250 2020-10-23 03:16:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon I’ll take it
1319355951997214720 2020-10-23 03:12:26 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s kind of perfect
1319354920139718665 2020-10-23 03:08:20 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s already had COVID
1319352049323200518 2020-10-23 02:56:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Very true
1319350801500864515 2020-10-23 02:51:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I never thought there would be a day when all the Media, Social Media, etc would collaborate to control the messaging at the expense of our President.  This is a bizarre timeline.
1319350377775570947 2020-10-23 02:50:17 +0800 <just_mindy> The gaslighting feels so unreal.  We all know the Hunter Biden laptop and implications are at least worth investigating but our media insists it’s “Russian disinformation” with actual zero evidence. They insist we must look away and what we see with our own eyes is false.
1319349666681675776 2020-10-23 02:47:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo
1319349212618907649 2020-10-23 02:45:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Which is how Kamala will become President
1319347346489167874 2020-10-23 02:38:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba I don’t blame you
1319343356628054016 2020-10-23 02:22:23 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m fully a woman and I found Stahl’s behavior appalling and her starting with “ready for tough questions” was combative and unnecessary
1319342866594934787 2020-10-23 02:20:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Good

1319337464364994560 2020-10-23 01:58:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Yes.  He was quite composed

1319337105429041154 2020-10-23 01:57:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay @beyondreasdoubt It had to be God protecting him because he nailed it with this one
1319336668835577856 2020-10-23 01:55:48 +0800 <just_mindy> He even replies “just be fair” and she makes some comment and he again just says “just be fair” and she just wouldn’t let up
1319336350815047682 2020-10-23 01:54:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Yes.  She looked very petty
1319336281655095301 2020-10-23 01:54:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot @nyetjgoldblum Omg! How funny!!
1319335976729182208 2020-10-23 01:53:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I agree.  Very bad.  She sounds extremely petty
1319335816607531008 2020-10-23 01:52:25 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Stahl starting the  interview with “ready for some tough questions” was pretty adversarial in tone and wasn’t a great foot to lead on.

1319310415441047555 2020-10-23 00:11:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @varadmehta You know I can see what you’re writing
1319310099647782920 2020-10-23 00:10:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, I don’t think Biden wins Fl
1319309510398365696 2020-10-23 00:07:53 +0800 <just_mindy> A solid campaign is him never leaving his house apparently
1319309123863924737 2020-10-23 00:06:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Dems aren’t getting that big of share of Asians or Hispanics and probably not AA.  I promise you that
1319305509091102720 2020-10-22 23:51:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen Exactly

1319295279116505088 2020-10-22 23:11:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  They clearly say newds are fine as long as consensual
1319291476099084288 2020-10-22 22:56:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @RC9511 🤣🤣
1319288022643347456 2020-10-22 22:42:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m Difi taking off the mask:  https://t.co/3MImenQDjf
1319283003797852162 2020-10-22 22:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump should have a website domain like “HunterNews” or “WheresHunter” or some ish he promotes tonight during his debate closing with all the stuff the media is hiding easily accessible
1319274479617359874 2020-10-22 21:48:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously, do you know any other man who has 4 adult children that are constantly by his side, as well as their spouses/sig others? Like LITRALLY the whole family moves as a unit? Hell, I didn’t know Ashley Biden existed until yesterday?! Let’s stop acting like Trump is a bad dad
1319273902099496961 2020-10-22 21:46:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig I mean, the man has 5 children that are CONSTANTLY at his side AND THEIR SPOUSES but they want me to believe he hates his family or something
1319273647945572354 2020-10-22 21:45:23 +0800 <just_mindy> “Biden is an exceptional father and very close to his kids we never see, trust us, but Trump is a wooly legged ninny monster whose children hate him yet they all are by his side 24/7.  What a terrible father who doesn’t know how to love and is an emotional leper” - our press
1319272467588808706 2020-10-22 21:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is the other part that bothers me. Stop pretending Trump exists in a vacuum. The way the press treated men like Romney &amp; McCain gave way to Trump. He fights back.  And clearly he is a good Dad.  We don’t see Biden’s kids ever.  Trump’s kids are at his hip. All of them.
1319271821062144000 2020-10-22 21:38:07 +0800 <just_mindy> A couple of things. Biden is lauded for his “closeness” w/ his sons, &amp; that’s fine, but Trump is also very close with his. They are a unit always together and they are devoted to him. As are his daughters.  Clearly, he is beloved by them. But their relationship is mocked
1319267246582222850 2020-10-22 21:19:57 +0800 <just_mindy> We will be too busy impeaching Biden for all this Hunter stuff.  See the slippery slope Nance started when she decided to let AOC boss her around?

1319101864177270784 2020-10-22 10:22:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Seminole is more blue now than in 2016.  I think any serious Florida election watcher doesn’t expect it to go for Trump.  That’s why I said it would shock me.

1319006366598647809 2020-10-22 04:03:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Every time I see and listen to these ex GOP consultant flunkies &amp; LP types, they are so weird.  Explains why they lost so much.

1319000037054156801 2020-10-22 03:38:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Or you could leave him alone and allow him his own religious and political beliefs fully knowing we all have an expectation of privacy &amp; the freedom to hold opposing views in the United States.  Or you could be a passive aggressive little fascist like you are here. 🤷🏼‍♀️

1318995442026319872 2020-10-22 03:19:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida Voters:  you CAN wear candidate gear to the polls.  You CAN’T solicit votes in said gear. This is clarification from the Seminole County Election Office. Just an FYI!! This has been the case since 2018 when the SC amended the law.   #sayfie #trump2020  https://t.co/OPSql04NkX

1318970167720894469 2020-10-22 01:39:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @KinCali1 @HotepDadMax True that
1318970132077682688 2020-10-22 01:39:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Truth
1318970086833741828 2020-10-22 01:39:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman We had a good bloodwork report today thankfully!!
1318967874522959877 2020-10-22 01:30:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ I’m confused
1318967788329930756 2020-10-22 01:30:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman It’s astounding
1318965166755766272 2020-10-22 01:19:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Actually I’m uneasy with him sleeping with a colleagues daughter, getting her pregnant, insisting she have an abortion and refusing to pay CS after the baby was born. Actually.
1318948733887729669 2020-10-22 00:14:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon I have no idea what to think
1318947941160202240 2020-10-22 00:11:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon And there def is a message in pro-Trump circles to vote ED
1318947238094245889 2020-10-22 00:08:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon On Election Day 2016, Dems had over 400k VBM lead over Repubs and ED voting swamped it.  Repubs have also won both days of EV
1318944452925399041 2020-10-21 23:57:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  Kavanaugh woke me up.
1318942887489449984 2020-10-21 23:51:03 +0800 <just_mindy> When my Dad dropped his off, there was an off duty cop watching it for overtime pay
1318941836535304195 2020-10-21 23:46:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcACaputo @dminor85 Amen
1318941354043543555 2020-10-21 23:44:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 @MarcACaputo Happy Anniversary!! I’m seeing a good amount of Biden signs in my very Trumpy Lake County so who knows?!

1318937720945860608 2020-10-21 23:30:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Thank you!!! 😘
1318937496777097217 2020-10-21 23:29:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 @MarcACaputo And then this is at someone’s house on the Turnpike going into Orlando  https://t.co/FaaojhRynk
1318937282909523968 2020-10-21 23:28:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 @MarcACaputo I mean, I see the excitement for Trump around I-4 corridor in Orlando &amp; that is sort of encouraging.  I know we see this differently. Lol That was on 17-92 in Orlando yesterday  https://t.co/a5mTyDNBnS
1318936625712406529 2020-10-21 23:26:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons Also? Many of these kids don’t even arrive with parents.  They arrive with relatives or friends in hopes they will be allowed to stay in the US
1318935699333197826 2020-10-21 23:22:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This is asinine
1318935590847598595 2020-10-21 23:22:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Man, it’s bad
1318935008359424003 2020-10-21 23:19:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @plug_maker True that
1318934752905363457 2020-10-21 23:18:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @dminor85 @MarcACaputo I’m still very iffy.  I want data
1318934190923091969 2020-10-21 23:16:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This
1318933753511792641 2020-10-21 23:14:46 +0800 <just_mindy> So @MarcACaputo I have a need, a need for data, and only you can fill it.  Drop those EV numbers, pretty please
1318933240359563265 2020-10-21 23:12:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF @infobee  https://t.co/P6r7NVPG5v
1318933003373084672 2020-10-21 23:11:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule Yes!!!! So true!!! ❤️❤️
1318932306674044928 2020-10-21 23:09:01 +0800 <just_mindy> And I’m also not sure why you keep defending Dems.  Your party hates you and makes fun of you.  They aren’t laughing with you, so you know what that means.
1318932019947147265 2020-10-21 23:07:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Mam.  I know you are wack, but he’s been President for 4 years and hasn’t rounded up a soul.  He has released a whole lot of folks. Go place your crystals outside in the sun so they can recharge.
1318931483973779456 2020-10-21 23:05:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax That’s real
1318931427895988229 2020-10-21 23:05:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @JRA19591 Thank you!!!
1318926540609146880 2020-10-21 22:46:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee @Gormogons We are all supposed to clap like seals over everything Kamala does
1318923744908333057 2020-10-21 22:34:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s keep a watch for this friends
1318921683080806400 2020-10-21 22:26:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut Yes!
1318921637710995457 2020-10-21 22:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @2my_rossi38 I appreciate that word!! The encouragement is so helpful
1318921523105845250 2020-10-21 22:26:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @mymundanemind @RuairiOMahony5 @ConceptualJames @EricRWeinstein @MayorJenny @tedwheeler Which exhibits the failure of the church to feed the flock. Seeker friendly churches are turning out shallow Christians who see the Bible through the social justice lens rather than social justice through a Biblical lens. Not their fault. We’ve abandoned the Word in church
1318920485514739720 2020-10-21 22:22:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Me too and thank you!! 😘❤️

1318917693093957635 2020-10-21 22:10:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Exactly

1318913399632384003 2020-10-21 21:53:53 +0800 <just_mindy> The death rate in Fl continues to be .02%

1318909134742368256 2020-10-21 21:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone should educate Elleni on how to write a complete sentence.

1318764478629117952 2020-10-21 12:02:07 +0800 <just_mindy> In case you are wondering, this is literal fascism.  Attempting to rob people of social and vocational capital because of who they vote for
1318763250222325761 2020-10-21 11:57:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @jstan_7561 I’d pay for that

1318633225854529542 2020-10-21 03:20:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Do not get complacent y’all.  Vote. Offer rides. Make it a date w/ your honey.  Go w/ friends grab a drink after. I had a cousin die last week &amp; he loved Trump but hadn’t voted yet. That was my cue to vote early.  Life isn’t guaranteed &amp; I want to know I did my part to KAG.

1318612358894333952 2020-10-21 01:57:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I just realized this is the first time my boy can vote for President &amp; he gets to do it as a #FirefightersforTrump.  He was too young to vote in 2016.  That’s kind of cool.

1318534741302431744 2020-10-20 20:49:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @mirihawk @EmmaJoNYC @nypost Let us know when Biden is ready to
1318534549203263494 2020-10-20 20:48:28 +0800 <just_mindy> And it’s not just that.  That I could stomach.  They are also trying to lose the Senate.  So you are giving the opposition the Executive &amp; the Senate &amp; they will pack the court and it will take decades to repair if ever.
1318511984602730497 2020-10-20 19:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five 😂😂😂
1318502464606380033 2020-10-20 18:40:58 +0800 <just_mindy> So while y’all imagine yourselves Mel Gibson, you’re way more Benedict Arnold.  You are actively facilitating the undermining of the foundations of our country.  All because you do not like Trump.  It’s laughable.  You’re not heroes. Collect that CNN check though.
1318501841588670469 2020-10-20 18:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> If that were true, this would be just about Trump. It’s not. Y’all are actively trying to lose the Senate.  You are handing  POTUS Kamala Harris the executive &amp; the Senate unfettered.  That’s not saving anything. That’s losing our country to the most liberal member of the Senate

1318387254440697856 2020-10-20 11:03:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 I mean he already cheated and had a kid with another woman while married to her so this is small potatoes
1318386805532774400 2020-10-20 11:01:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Men you don’t have to get on  Twitter tonight and defend Toobin.  You just don’t.

1318384801674612738 2020-10-20 10:53:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Has been sidelined?  As if he doesn’t bear any responsibility? This was just some event that happened to him &amp; he was powerless?  What a bizarre misogynistic take.

1318357741845598208 2020-10-20 09:05:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Did Toobin’s mistress have the baby or no?
1318356799473537025 2020-10-20 09:02:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ByronHoffman6 I saw it on our local news.  It was weird
1318355050708828160 2020-10-20 08:55:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @ByronHoffman6 They made everyone stay in their cars.  It was at our fairgrounds.  People honked their horns if they liked something she said
1318354347193925638 2020-10-20 08:52:24 +0800 <just_mindy> To be fair, there is a second video call happening at the same time at Toobin’s place so while technically loving himself, he had an audience. 😉
1318352900133953537 2020-10-20 08:46:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  First of all, it was 90 degrees here today.  Why are you dressed for the Arctic? Secondly, you’re doing the dumb black chucks with navy blazer thing again. Finally you are outside &amp; people stayed in their cars.  Why are you wearing a mask?

1318350074615824384 2020-10-20 08:35:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Good question
1318334171434110978 2020-10-20 07:32:14 +0800 <just_mindy> #1. The Biden campaign hasn’t disputed them
1318333715840442369 2020-10-20 07:30:25 +0800 <just_mindy> But I prefer older men 🤷🏼‍♀️  https://t.co/2H4IwlhCkr

1318328899143688192 2020-10-20 07:11:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Notice she annotates Biden/Harris because she knows Harris is the actual candidate.  These are alleged “conservatives” voting for the most liberal member of the Senate to be POTUS, even more leftist than Bernie.  And they think they will rebuild the “GOP”.  No thank you.

1318322532391489536 2020-10-20 06:45:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth You got that right
1318322458672455685 2020-10-20 06:45:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Or not as he was seeking other forms of entertainment
1318320788240539649 2020-10-20 06:39:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently he was also on a second video call which means he was “having fun” with a partner which explains apologizing to his wife.

1318267697239592963 2020-10-20 03:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> She appeared at our fairgrounds.  People had to sit in their cars  and beep their horns when they agreed with her.

1318209183146278912 2020-10-19 23:15:35 +0800 <just_mindy> As @ajzeigler said, if you believe in government accountability, you should vote for Trump. The media stays curious about every move Trump makes. If you vote for Biden they’ll go back to sleep for the next four years.

1318208402179477505 2020-10-19 23:12:28 +0800 <just_mindy> There are just the last week.  I know you might like Trump but your vote for Biden supports this kind of media/govt collusion.  To say nothing of abortion, 2A, and school choice.
1318208137753669642 2020-10-19 23:11:25 +0800 <just_mindy> *The NYT runs an editorial doing a deep dive into ACB’s adoption of her two children to imply something nefarious *the media accuses Trump of doing something untoward for giving an offering at church  *the debate moderator and her parents are rabid Democrats.
1318207568087552000 2020-10-19 23:09:10 +0800 <just_mindy> I want everyone to remove Trump from equation                    In 1 week: *Twitter blocks stories abt Hunter Biden. As does FB *debate committee changes foreign policy focus because of Biden leak *Biden goes into hiding &amp; media is unconcerned  *news refuses to report on Laptop

1318203258494746625 2020-10-19 22:52:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously eff all the way off, Fascist.  An ad maker says shit like this?  Seriously?! Next time you make an ad, just host it on your company website.  Don’t put it on social.  https://t.co/G7cTmJo5Fo
1318202114712215554 2020-10-19 22:47:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Children who have been adopted do not owe you or anyone else their origin story.  People shouldn’t ask.  Newspapers should not dig.  When they are old enough to decide, they can share how they feel comfortable.  Deeply troubling @nytimes.  Shame on you for this editorial.
1318201601463668736 2020-10-19 22:45:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Woah.  This is such a low down nasty tactic by @nytimes it makes me sick on my stomach. Twitter should be blocking the link to that drivel.  How is that not invading privacy of minors? ADOPTEE STORIES ARE THEIR OWN AND NOT FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

1318179978190704643 2020-10-19 21:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden has been in government exclusively for 47 years.  Just 3 1/2 years ago he was VP for 8 years.  Why exactly does it take this many days for him to cogently discuss government affairs. It should be second nature to him with zero prep.
1318068607088271360 2020-10-19 13:56:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Your parents aren’t ghouls.  That’s to their credit.
1318068374543519745 2020-10-19 13:56:03 +0800 <just_mindy> The economy was incredible before COVID, &amp; because I don’t live in a blue state, my kid is happily enjoying football games and high school with a few common sense protocols! No outbreaks in 9 weeks.  I see my parents everyday.  Maybe your problem isn’t actually Trump.
1318066746725642241 2020-10-19 13:49:35 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re doing her an incredible favor.  Tell her now before she wastes another minute tending your friendship

1318031758923804674 2020-10-19 11:30:33 +0800 <just_mindy> The press are all campaign surrogate.  They don’t have to do a thing.
1318023280171847680 2020-10-19 10:56:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m I love that.  What a good man
1318021904918335488 2020-10-19 10:51:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m Right!! He’s the kind of man who always wants to have cash.  My dad is the same
1318020580214558720 2020-10-19 10:46:08 +0800 <just_mindy> A church going Catholic who waged war on the Little Sisters of the Poor and supports abortion making him ineligible to receive communion in some parishes.  Report that part.
1318019899483095040 2020-10-19 10:43:26 +0800 <just_mindy> There is a battle and there is darkness.  Abortion is demonic and you support it so stop pandering
1318018933740503046 2020-10-19 10:39:36 +0800 <just_mindy> What POTUS did was entirely appropriate.  Tithing is for members of a congregation to bring into their local “storehouse”.  You don’t tithe where you aren’t a member.  You give in offering when visiting a church where you aren’t a member. Cash is most appropriate.

1317992786864594947 2020-10-19 08:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick This woman says there are caged children. I’m asking why they aren’t at the border demanding their release
1317992634833620992 2020-10-19 08:55:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick Abortion rights activists are committed.  No doubt.  So are pro-life people.  There have been tons of restrictions put on abortion providers in the last 10 years thanks to their work.  The difference is, there isn’t a room full of caged babies to go free.
1317991574102511616 2020-10-19 08:50:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick I do believe abortion is murder but I don’t hold any Democratic President personally responsible for it the way they do the “caged children”.  Also, what happened to the marches and protests at the border?  Pro-life folks never stop.
1317991191032496128 2020-10-19 08:49:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman My apologies!!
1317991096472010752 2020-10-19 08:48:59 +0800 <just_mindy> The “caged children” trope is really their effort to allow anyone to come into the US, be immediately released into our populace and everyone knows they’ll never show back up for their hearing.  Let’s be honest.
1317990820377710595 2020-10-19 08:47:53 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s almost as if she knows children aren’t really “caged”.  That activists demanded they not be separated from their parents, and their parents broke laws, and until they are processed, the children stay with them.  They used to go to foster homes.
1317990354306650112 2020-10-19 08:46:02 +0800 <just_mindy> We talk often about people who sat idly while the Jewish people were killed in Germany, but here is a woman with w platform and means, who truly believes there are caged children yet she just plays on Twitter and sleeps easy at night?! Really?
1317989993252610048 2020-10-19 08:44:36 +0800 <just_mindy> When people say “focus on the man caging children”, I wonder how monstrous they must be.  If they truly believe there are “caged children”, &amp; they just complain on Twitter rather than collect a mob to go demand the freedom of the kids, that’s the height of inhumanity.

1317902494018752512 2020-10-19 02:56:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley A daughter I wasn’t aware he has?
1317902432026923010 2020-10-19 02:56:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 Isn’t is weird!! Nothing than 3 calls
1317902326133329927 2020-10-19 02:56:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chestertweet Oh wow!!! Probably best you didn’t
1317902149255385088 2020-10-19 02:55:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy I’m a wife of an addict who just recently almost killed himself so I get it.  My issue is the double standard and Hunter was profiting off his dad’s name while very sick and that’s not ok for our national security
1317901758111375360 2020-10-19 02:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings That’s what baffles me!!
1317901598685863941 2020-10-19 02:53:21 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the double standard I mean
1317900529431883778 2020-10-19 02:49:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark It’s really bizarre
1317900453988962311 2020-10-19 02:48:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelBlum3 Ha!! No
1317899223040405505 2020-10-19 02:43:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @fi_virginia I think in a perfect world, that would be great, but the divide between the parties now is a chasm.  Also? The Media is so disparate in the coverage of the 2 parties, I don’t think anything is possible until they improve.  Trump is the manifestation of that anger
1317898479641964544 2020-10-19 02:40:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings So Jill had 5 daughters?  So strange none of them travels with her
1317898269108899841 2020-10-19 02:40:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman And everyone knows it
1317898139861475328 2020-10-19 02:39:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta It seems like text poll replies would skew younger honestly.  My parents would never answer a text poll
1317897494794244099 2020-10-19 02:37:02 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m all for leaving kids out of things, but y’all know if Trump had 2 kids who were frequently in and out of rehab for cocaine addiction, it would be a story.
1317896901270884352 2020-10-19 02:34:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait? Biden has a daughter?
1317896751483920385 2020-10-19 02:34:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve never been polled and I have been a resident of a swing state all my life and have voted in every election.  What the heck? Followers: have you been polled in 2016 or 2020?
1317896199328960513 2020-10-19 02:31:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @clukens1 Ha!!
1317895432085901312 2020-10-19 02:28:50 +0800 <just_mindy> The third best day of my life happened on one of my kid’s birthdays also, so 3/30 is a good day for me all around
1317895204817481729 2020-10-19 02:27:56 +0800 <just_mindy> I think they’d say the birth of my kids and that’s true

1317891098249994241 2020-10-19 02:11:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom I totally get it
1317891034295226368 2020-10-19 02:11:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I plan to vote in person but my Dad has cancer and can’t be around people during treatment.  He is using black ink but this discrepancy concerns me.
1317890670581981185 2020-10-19 02:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m concerned after seeing absentee ballots sent by Lake County Florida Board of Elections.  Blue secrecy sleeve (#2) says ballots may be marked in BLUE OR BLACK INK. The ballot, however, says only black ink. @AnthonySabatini @marcorubio @SenRickScott  Will ballots in blue count?  https://t.co/ek6kbuiISw

1317875481727950848 2020-10-19 01:09:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I am going to say one thing.  I get lots of DM’s from married men (don’t DM me married men) and wife friends who aren’t having fun and experimenting, should maybe try.  It’s good for everyone!
1317874808886091776 2020-10-19 01:06:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp Sometimes they get the Fins or Bucs instead.

1317863251238133760 2020-10-19 00:20:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Isn’t it though?
1317861484517609473 2020-10-19 00:13:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Exactly.  So so sad
1317861182829715458 2020-10-19 00:12:45 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why people need to vote and encourage friends to vote. These people are insane.
1317860358988746760 2020-10-19 00:09:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Also this is why kids belong in school.  Kids that are most vulnerable are left in situations like this.

1317858317339889665 2020-10-19 00:01:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Yes and his family and his people and his charities.  You have sons.  I know you see it like I do.

1317857093307817991 2020-10-18 23:56:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Love this
1317856437557776384 2020-10-18 23:53:53 +0800 <just_mindy> I like how his opener was definitive.  He assumed the sale.  They were getting drinks and just needed to plan the time.  That’s a good primer for a guy asking a lady out.

1317851314404102144 2020-10-18 23:33:32 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why the Women’s March was way more of a “super spreader” event than any Trump rally.  People came from all over US to DC &amp; will now go back to every corner.  Trump rallies are people staying in their own geographic areas. You won’t hear the news talk about that tho.

1317677673838149632 2020-10-18 12:03:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ He seems miserable
1317677575557316609 2020-10-18 12:03:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @JohnEkdahl @Neoavatara @BKudron He’s a machine.   No doubt.  I like the kid a lot
1317675357408010241 2020-10-18 11:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m going to cry my fake eyelashes off
1317675283223203841 2020-10-18 11:54:03 +0800 <just_mindy> My boy was 8 last time his @RaysBaseball did this!!!  2020 has sucked but man this is good!!
1317674521390886912 2020-10-18 11:51:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan Yes
1317674461253042176 2020-10-18 11:50:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @BKudron @JohnEkdahl I’m not sure.
1317670937945378817 2020-10-18 11:36:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Probably for the SEC championship
1317670720214884357 2020-10-18 11:35:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @JohnEkdahl @Neoavatara Maybe.  As I said, maybe Clemson.  I just don’t know
1317670606406639617 2020-10-18 11:35:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @coryadair Yep.  I don’t know if even Trevor can do it
1317670473744920576 2020-10-18 11:34:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @JohnEkdahl @Neoavatara I think Bama takes it all this year
1317670066926878721 2020-10-18 11:33:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear 😂😂
1317669982407446528 2020-10-18 11:32:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I don’t know.  We’ll see!
1317669670980386817 2020-10-18 11:31:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Only Clemson can beat Bama imo.  I’m not sure even they can.
1317669491497721856 2020-10-18 11:31:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Right?
1317669112202579971 2020-10-18 11:29:32 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the portrait they just released.  That is not the face of a happy man.  She seems very pleased so maybe she doesn’t see it.  https://t.co/V2vZhE7VX1
1317668671481815040 2020-10-18 11:27:47 +0800 <just_mindy> And I hope we all find love like this.
1317668383190548480 2020-10-18 11:26:38 +0800 <just_mindy> This is awful. What has been done to people is just criminal
1317668118827880448 2020-10-18 11:25:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Truth
1317667631109967873 2020-10-18 11:23:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Donald Trump has chosen good SC justices, selected a great VP, supports school choice and 2A.
1317664581452517382 2020-10-18 11:11:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @willchamberlain Congratulations!!  Beautiful ring!!
1317659759487700992 2020-10-18 10:52:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow They don’t
1317642660593737728 2020-10-18 09:44:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 @_BlakeEddins Yes, indeed
1317641207518986243 2020-10-18 09:38:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @josedutch46 @danieltobin He received copious monetary enrichment trading on his dad’s name &amp; there is evidence he split the money with his dad.  That is a problem
1317639319029415936 2020-10-18 09:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Ha!!!
1317638751653421056 2020-10-18 09:28:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 @_BlakeEddins Did Keith Olbermann ever play or was he just a commentator
1317638172755529730 2020-10-18 09:26:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m @SaintRPh He’s a fraud
1317637730017382400 2020-10-18 09:24:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Practically everything
1317637243557785600 2020-10-18 09:22:54 +0800 <just_mindy> You having almost a million followers for stealing content sends a terrible message
1317636996068683776 2020-10-18 09:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @russsalerno Also dumb
1317635678977597440 2020-10-18 09:16:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Apparently we mock people for catching a virus now
1317635412412739584 2020-10-18 09:15:37 +0800 <just_mindy> The behavior of Cuomo has been abhorrent all around but his treatment of Orthodox Jews is straight bigotry!!
1317634862757588993 2020-10-18 09:13:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Really going to make Florida voters sympathetic to your cause 😤
1317633897677660161 2020-10-18 09:09:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Yes most of the time it is
1317633616671899654 2020-10-18 09:08:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Normal ppl will pray for his recovery and not revel in a man catching a virus unlike you ghouls
1317633407766171648 2020-10-18 09:07:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope they do.  Drive more votes to Trump.  You clearly don’t understand Gator fans
1317633108011876352 2020-10-18 09:06:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Rick Wilson is a big FSU fan and his envy is evident.  Not sure why mocking kids for catching a virus is helpful, but whatever.
1317631536729030657 2020-10-18 09:00:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Spot the difference, my fine friends.  https://t.co/gmMucjNwq1
1317631000692797441 2020-10-18 08:58:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa I’m also stunned
1317629952813109256 2020-10-18 08:53:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/SJhDhCIfNX
1317629714270388225 2020-10-18 08:52:58 +0800 <just_mindy> This isn’t on you in the least.  You were beast mode today.  Knight Nation stans you!
1317619097224568832 2020-10-18 08:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!  We would love them to take him!
1317618809944014848 2020-10-18 08:09:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 4 years but the first 2 he had the program Scott Frost built
1317618418540007425 2020-10-18 08:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’m probably not real cute right now
1317617711162249216 2020-10-18 08:05:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Heupel has zero control or discipline of this team. You can look at him and the lack of pride he takes in his own appearance and that extends to how he coaches.  Period.
1317616544986353666 2020-10-18 08:00:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’m so frustrated!
1317615636869222400 2020-10-18 07:57:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally
1317614772175732741 2020-10-18 07:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh I knew we didn’t.  I know who our coach is
1317613946333954048 2020-10-18 07:50:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Orlando is literally a Soccer Mecca for the US.  Maybe we can find a kicker
1317613632650383360 2020-10-18 07:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> What a joke.
1317613458796515329 2020-10-18 07:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Here we go
1317612827096588288 2020-10-18 07:45:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  It’s been a wreck
1317612601015152641 2020-10-18 07:44:58 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/yj2dQw2R5P
1317612340750278659 2020-10-18 07:43:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1317612226824622085 2020-10-18 07:43:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Probably not
1317612139960565760 2020-10-18 07:43:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Our defensive coordinator is also trash
1317612000978083845 2020-10-18 07:42:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He sucks.
1317611880744181762 2020-10-18 07:42:07 +0800 <just_mindy> #FireCoachHeupel
1317611368531566592 2020-10-18 07:40:04 +0800 <just_mindy> As bad as Heupel losing every game is, watching him go into the press conference looking like he’s just came off a 2 day bender and mumbling dumb nonsense makes me even more ragey.
1317610928809119744 2020-10-18 07:38:20 +0800 <just_mindy> This
1317610786278309888 2020-10-18 07:37:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’ve seen what Heupel does.  I have zero hope
1317610451069472768 2020-10-18 07:36:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It’s frustrating
1317610099255422977 2020-10-18 07:35:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Heupel is trash. That’s the tweet.
1317609770413625347 2020-10-18 07:33:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Our coach is trash.  He always loses close games
1317609617510273026 2020-10-18 07:33:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!! Over the water makes them special
1317609505212014594 2020-10-18 07:32:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 This game is making me crazy and it’s making me hate our coach even more
1317607336165445634 2020-10-18 07:24:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 It’s a whole mess
1317607277361324032 2020-10-18 07:23:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @FL_Chelle It’s always nuts here
1317606138733613063 2020-10-18 07:19:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL @SaintRPh @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis 🥰😂😂😂😂
1317605467410042881 2020-10-18 07:16:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gardrail It’s one of my greatest blessings.  That view
1317605352456835074 2020-10-18 07:16:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Awesome!!!
1317605316914253825 2020-10-18 07:16:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @MichelleInCAL @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis That so cool!!
1317605237818085376 2020-10-18 07:15:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL @SaintRPh @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis I love that!!!!
1317605188753043458 2020-10-18 07:15:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis She’s conservative now
1317605141697253376 2020-10-18 07:15:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ It does.  My daughter gets mad I am messing up her hair on the way to school
1317604455580389383 2020-10-18 07:12:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @redsteeze @seanmdav They are only doing that at MAGA rallies
1317604266589171723 2020-10-18 07:11:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepWithit Yes please!!
1317604013169381379 2020-10-18 07:10:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL @SaintRPh @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis Oh he is
1317603974091071489 2020-10-18 07:10:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFromJerzee I might need new wipers.  It’s time for the yearly service and I need to take it in
1317603840796053506 2020-10-18 07:10:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jerrymusings No I have a great car.  It’s me
1317603779940917251 2020-10-18 07:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb It’s a miracle
1317603425601966081 2020-10-18 07:08:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes!!!!! I’m going to early vote on Monday
1317603299017871360 2020-10-18 07:08:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @UncleHotep @HotepJesus @jenvanlaar @SuperAndrea @xan_desanctis Why?!
1317603257758420994 2020-10-18 07:07:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ I usually do
1317603209402146816 2020-10-18 07:07:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFromJerzee I do but it’s a whole mess
1317602856472662017 2020-10-18 07:06:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @UncleHotep @HotepJesus or @jenvanlaar &amp; @SuperAndrea about AB5 or @xan_desanctis about Pro-life or @SaintRPh about people being insane about COVID therapies
1317602180304699398 2020-10-18 07:03:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFromJerzee But I use my wipes and it comes right back
1317602091444113408 2020-10-18 07:03:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @BeltoWNC I always do the wrong thing
1317601402760450048 2020-10-18 07:00:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  It’s not funny.  This is literally me every morning.  https://t.co/meSX6MmRbN
1317600415303766016 2020-10-18 06:56:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u It’s so amazing!
1317600279928442881 2020-10-18 06:56:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @rhinegelt Thank you
1317598096528900096 2020-10-18 06:47:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  This scene.  https://t.co/focpS6sDe8
1317595278585847809 2020-10-18 06:36:08 +0800 <just_mindy> My Dad is watching videos as loud as he can on his phone and my team looks like trash &amp; I’m ready to fight someone.
1317594779602006016 2020-10-18 06:34:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DatOtherMichael @Wishful_wink Y’all are cute! 😘😘😘
1317594567693262854 2020-10-18 06:33:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean, it’s so embarrassing
1317594363862618112 2020-10-18 06:32:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle I can’t blame you there
1317594298746109954 2020-10-18 06:32:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb We should be great.  Our coach is trash
1317593937742278658 2020-10-18 06:30:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I beg Texas to take Heupel.  Please.
1317593666668630022 2020-10-18 06:29:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m already there.  He did fine for 2 years under what Frost built and it’s been awful since.  He looks like a frumpy disheveled mess all the time and is embarrassing.  The guy has zero charisma and isn’t inspiring.
1317593059488632833 2020-10-18 06:27:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @DatOtherMichael Hunter’s
1317593002886483969 2020-10-18 06:27:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I know I say this often and maybe it’s annoying, but I’m going to say it again.  Vote in person, if possible.
1317584066041073670 2020-10-18 05:51:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @markknoller Very few
1317583931420643329 2020-10-18 05:51:03 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s really good that COVID is a registered Democrat and doesn’t infect people protesting on behalf of leftist causes.
1317583679225516032 2020-10-18 05:50:03 +0800 <just_mindy> These folks don’t look very social distanced @markknoller
1317583292842053633 2020-10-18 05:48:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Yep.  You’re exactly right!!
1317583094145294337 2020-10-18 05:47:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JMR1834 @markknoller Exactly!!  Social media has changed the landscape
1317576303273443328 2020-10-18 05:20:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Right.  The texts indicate they know he is in a bad place.  Watching Jill allow Joe to run in his cognitive state shows me there is a total lack of self awareness in that family
1317574733425238017 2020-10-18 05:14:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ He definitely was in rehab at one point because he was writing letters from there. I can’t get over believing it’s a good idea to send your son to other countries when you know he’s in full addict mode
1317574166896431113 2020-10-18 05:12:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrKarlynB Welcome!

1317566860821495808 2020-10-18 04:43:13 +0800 <just_mindy> This is right on
1317566437909778433 2020-10-18 04:41:32 +0800 <just_mindy> I want you to make the decision
1317564974789742598 2020-10-18 04:35:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @FrEmmanuel4 Hello!!  Praying for your peace

1317545154753007618 2020-10-18 03:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> This happened in my county yesterday.  This man worked for our Supervisor of Elections &amp; killed himself at the office.  This is unbelievable.

1317517585689284611 2020-10-18 01:27:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Our brains are advanced enough to concern ourselves with both stories.
1317517354943893505 2020-10-18 01:26:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden is running for President and has already been VP for 8 years.  You’re uninterested he may have sold access to our government to Chinese and Ukrainian officials?  That’s pretty telling.
1317516994271465472 2020-10-18 01:25:04 +0800 <just_mindy> The Trump tax returns, of course, were not a set up

1317440180740104192 2020-10-17 20:19:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrTate @ATxFellow Again? I can look at Biden and know he won’t make it one year in the Presidency. It’s a shadow campaign for Kamala and as far as I’m concerned, she’s a better looking Bernie. I’m praying for scales to fall off eyes and people vote for Trump
1317439308391981057 2020-10-17 20:16:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd It sure is
1317439137595727873 2020-10-17 20:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrTate @ATxFellow Biden isn’t the candidate.  Kamala is, and she was rated as more “progressive” than Bernie so no, it’s not amazing in any way.
1317438798469435392 2020-10-17 20:14:21 +0800 <just_mindy> “Voluntary buy back” 🤣🤣 Kind of like how I pay “voluntary taxes” every April 15

1317334938727948288 2020-10-17 13:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, many Republicans are also artists.  Those people happen to have well developed creative sides yet also see the need for pragmatic government and liberty because that is where people can best express and create
1317334389186039810 2020-10-17 13:19:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Liberals make Art. Republicans keep the world safe for creatives to make art. Both are required.  If the creatives are tasked with the work of governing &amp; managing and protecting, they cower in fear and then the country is taken over by those who will tell you what you may create

1317325484548567041 2020-10-17 12:44:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Timm989 @ltthompso And what does that say about allowing him to work for foreign companies in a vulnerable state?
1317325307653820421 2020-10-17 12:43:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Yes and you know and I know, had he gave you access to 50K a month, you might not be alive
1317325149696413696 2020-10-17 12:42:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 Exactly
1317325082348445697 2020-10-17 12:42:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Addicts aren’t angelic beings who get caught up and if it weren’t for the drugs, they’d be sweet loving people all the time.  Just like all other people, addicts are sometimes selfish jerks even when sober.  The innocents are their kids
1317324629841760260 2020-10-17 12:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Please please stop behaving like addicts don’t hold responsibility for their behavior.  I can assure you Hunter had access to every rehab known to man.  He chose to skip meetings.  He chose in a lucid mind to start again.  He put everything else behind his drug of choice.
1317324227184369664 2020-10-17 12:39:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I say this from a personal place.  My husband (almost ex) has devastated me, our kids, his siblings and another marriage.  He isn’t an innocent in this. Yes, it’s a disease, but every time he used, he made a choice. He was offered help and love time and time again.
1317323602958712832 2020-10-17 12:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> One more thing I want to say about addicts &amp; addiction.  We want to infantilize addicts often.  That leads to more sickness. Addicts have a problem &amp; need help, but we also must acknowledge they are selfish &amp; liars while using. These are choices.  Addicts still have free agency.
1317322550783971328 2020-10-17 12:32:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, I disagree. It shows a father who knows his son is very sick and very broken, but still allowed him to trade on his name &amp; position, to get lucrative seats on boards against his son’s best interest &amp; that of our nation.
1317319744370954242 2020-10-17 12:21:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m Yes.  I think Hunter always believed he didn’t measure up
1317317824201826310 2020-10-17 12:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1317317562238205953 2020-10-17 12:12:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1317317475911041024 2020-10-17 12:12:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t hate anyone.  I know what life with an addict is. I was an enabler.  I get.  I just think allowing your addict kid to be a pawn or foreign government and taking a slice of the bribe is gross
1317317086629253121 2020-10-17 12:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I know!! Why don’t I parent or something!!
1317316438638682112 2020-10-17 12:08:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love Yep!!
1317316324490620928 2020-10-17 12:07:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Where did I say my kids haven’t made bad choices? I wouldn’t allow them to use access to me to score huge sums of money that they would them snort up their nose. I can’t control what my kids do, but I can certainly stop them from using me as an incentive if I was a govt official
1317314284679024641 2020-10-17 11:59:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Um I have four children. The oldest is 30, then 25 and then 20. I also have an addict spouse who I would never ever give unfettered access to money and never allow him to be used in schemes with other governments because he’s unstable!

1317302755057434624 2020-10-17 11:13:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @RuckyRuciano 😂😂
1317302606453219328 2020-10-17 11:13:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ The Biden campaign hasn’t refuted it.  That’s a huge tell
1317302443080810496 2020-10-17 11:12:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @BiasedGirl @DeusVult1911 Yes.  It also has to do with the children never getting attention because their parents were too enamored with chasing clout and in Biden’s case, finding a new woman.  Children are often pushed to the back burner.
1317301769786064896 2020-10-17 11:09:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @DeusVult1911 That he knew for 10 days!!!
1317301665238798336 2020-10-17 11:09:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @ohsoshabbyblog @BiasedGirl Oh please what? What part is inaccurate?
1317301447399264262 2020-10-17 11:08:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @DeusVult1911 Yes!! Very dysfunctional.  And while he is sleeping with his brother’s wife, he gets another woman pregnant
1317301127109615616 2020-10-17 11:07:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly!
1317300997803417600 2020-10-17 11:06:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Probably what the “book advance” on his taxes were
1317300836838576128 2020-10-17 11:06:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Oh. My. Word.
1317299747858878464 2020-10-17 11:01:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t think his texts to his son are damning. What is a problem is Biden knew his son was quite sick and was fine with him sitting on boards and earning huge sums of money which we all know were for access.  He allowed his his son to be a pawn.  A son he knew was broken.

1317298811417579520 2020-10-17 10:58:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I mean, what a dumb statement
1317297294069432320 2020-10-17 10:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @JohnEkdahl Yes.  And it was an illegal recording
1317297095787876357 2020-10-17 10:51:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl And he was a former Democrat!! Now a happy warrior!!

1317296303332872192 2020-10-17 10:48:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Oh yes
1317296009794457600 2020-10-17 10:46:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 I mean, yum
1317295938197663746 2020-10-17 10:46:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Obviously there are exceptions
1317293374072905732 2020-10-17 10:36:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 He is so hot
1317293341541847040 2020-10-17 10:36:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Way into their 60’s for me.  I don’t see guys in their 30’s as attractive mostly
1317292746286288896 2020-10-17 10:33:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @MelissaTweets @ben_woods15 I can see it when he faces any type of difficult questioning.  He gets nasty!!!
1317292204763774976 2020-10-17 10:31:50 +0800 <just_mindy> What about Biden exudes “strong” to you? I’m seriously fascinated to hear this.
1317291912722788352 2020-10-17 10:30:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @MelissaTweets @ben_woods15 I’m so tired of hearing that.  He’s not a good person
1317287253052477442 2020-10-17 10:12:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Yessss

1317281798649503744 2020-10-17 09:50:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 I hope you’re right
1317281692617506822 2020-10-17 09:50:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Really stellar day for the Democrats
1317281250592378881 2020-10-17 09:48:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 I sure hope so!!
1317281200785051648 2020-10-17 09:48:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  If there are underage girls, he should be immediately
1317281098804695040 2020-10-17 09:47:42 +0800 <just_mindy> At this point, Biden needs to shore up Independents &amp; Republicans who don’t like Trump.  Allowing tweens to transition is not how you reach them.  Really dumb move.
1317280721275412480 2020-10-17 09:46:12 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not sure how the “trans” question last night was intended to help Biden.  I believe that demographic of parents was already firmly in his camp.  I’ve had 2 ppl reach out today &amp; say they will now have to vote Trump because they disagree with that answer from Biden.

1317275553188220929 2020-10-17 09:25:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep and so is everything else which is why the Biden camp is mum.  They hope to ride it out like Cunningham and Northam
1317272307937804288 2020-10-17 09:12:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow.  Cristiano is going to the mat for the Biden campaign
1317272157240655872 2020-10-17 09:12:10 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m sure Cristiano was incensed when the Trump tax returns were released.  And the Melania friend tapes.

Let’s stop pretending the media is fair.  Like at all.

1317092726228291587 2020-10-16 21:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  As someone who lost 3 family members in a fatal car accident, I cannot imagine lying about the circumstances &amp; trying to vilify the other driver as a drunk for years.  He wasn’t drunk and he wasn’t even at fault.  It’s more of Biden’s fabulist nature.

1316906108771045377 2020-10-16 08:57:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1316905270770077696 2020-10-16 08:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden is having a buddy chat with some guys son who served under Reagan but was best friends with Tip O Neil if you are wondering about the @GStephanopoulos cuddle puddle.
1316904451400257537 2020-10-16 08:51:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet out of the other side of his mouth said millions of people are already voting 🤷🏼‍♀️
1316904146637828097 2020-10-16 08:49:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden still won’t answer court packing question

1316902285889441795 2020-10-16 08:42:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 Exactly
1316901366200176640 2020-10-16 08:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden just said cops should shoot people in the leg and not to kill.  Anyone in law enforcement can tell you why that’s nuts .
1316898636601692160 2020-10-16 08:27:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Yep!!! And they found out by requiring records from their cell phones

1316835048319004672 2020-10-16 04:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I live in Florida.  We have had kids back in school since August.  Our state is back open.  Our hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.  Our death rate is .02%.
1316834695678767104 2020-10-16 04:13:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Apparently I have a huge wart on my face

1316833924341993473 2020-10-16 04:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m 45 &amp; happy to say so!! People do die fr COVID.  Mostly elderly and the compromised. Those people should protect themselves in the way they see fit.  We can’t expect economies &amp; life to halt when death rate is less than 1%.  I suggest an eye exam if you see a wart on my face.  https://t.co/9GyzHPVDab
1316832660673769485 2020-10-16 04:05:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba She was brilliant!!!
1316826497039114241 2020-10-16 03:41:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Yes.  They are way too convinced they are clever
1316822750875594752 2020-10-16 03:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> You appear to be elderly so I suggest you take precautions.  My dad is doing the same.  He, however, doesn’t believe my teen should be locked up at home with no life. It’s selfish for you to believe that.
1316820803745468425 2020-10-16 03:18:39 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/H5HMIubzUt
1316819859917942784 2020-10-16 03:14:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The death rate in Fl is .02% and people want to lock up young healthy people.  Makes zero sense
1316819539334762499 2020-10-16 03:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> This is where I get my data btw    https://t.co/Jm5PPYJqIn
1316819189534011392 2020-10-16 03:12:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree Depends on where you live in Fl.  That isn’t a conversation you hear in central or N. Fl.  Not that there is anything wrong with that convo.
1316818902429696001 2020-10-16 03:11:06 +0800 <just_mindy> The actual death rate in Fl is .02% currently.  So less than 1%.  And we are completely open with no mask mandate
1316818103477710849 2020-10-16 03:07:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin Yes!!!  That’s awesome he does too!!

1316817966126829568 2020-10-16 03:07:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @jamiedupree Hmmmm.  I live in Florida and we were told that over and over.  Our kids have been back in school, our businesses are open and our hospitals aren’t overwhelmed &amp; our death rate is around 1%.  Where is the mistake, exactly?
1316817501511188482 2020-10-16 03:05:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin 😂😂 I only do politics on Twitter.  Lol my guy is on Twitter but he doesn’t speak like that to women
1316817260900741126 2020-10-16 03:04:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 I think maybe so too
1316817204009205765 2020-10-16 03:04:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @BillWicker5 LITRALLY what some of the leftist men on here should be wearing
1316817024207683584 2020-10-16 03:03:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Shauna74891161 The polls scare me.
1316816848097288195 2020-10-16 03:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Again? Number of cases shouldn’t concern us.  Number of hospitalizations &amp; death rates should.  Tons of college kids have it.  They’re asymptomatic.
1316816140690165773 2020-10-16 03:00:07 +0800 <just_mindy> If my man got on Twitter and called a woman names or disparaged her appearance rather than operate in good faith and present a cogent thought, I would be super annoyed.  I don’t know why women are ok with their husbands acting like trash bags.
1316815505127342081 2020-10-16 02:57:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @kmwsoon Literally 😉
1316815443693367307 2020-10-16 02:57:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Always nasty and angry
1316814973104988160 2020-10-16 02:55:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @kmwsoon It’s a LP sock account likely
1316813422101757958 2020-10-16 02:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Um, we are fully open in Florida.  Anyone who wants can have a party. Maybe you should take your ire out on your elected officials rather than a girl who isn’t in politics and is trying to live her life.  Twat.
1316812855153434625 2020-10-16 02:47:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @ChrisjHowerton Thank you!!!
1316808316148953088 2020-10-16 02:29:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ChrisjHowerton I missed that article.  I will look!
1316806227100303363 2020-10-16 02:20:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan I know!!!! I wish I was meh again!!! Less stressful
1316806067649683458 2020-10-16 02:20:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @MikeHoncho1127 I hope for a definitive win
1316804214111326213 2020-10-16 02:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @e2pilot Yes, that’s so true!!
1316804159799164928 2020-10-16 02:12:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @MikeHoncho1127 Yes but will it matter
1316804099418009613 2020-10-16 02:12:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I want a win.   I just am not confident
1316802754237562880 2020-10-16 02:06:56 +0800 <just_mindy> No matter your political affiliation, are you confident in a Trump victory in November?
1316800522762977286 2020-10-16 01:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Very likely
1316800473907822598 2020-10-16 01:57:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL Yes. She also fails at humor
1316799086641676291 2020-10-16 01:52:21 +0800 <just_mindy> If you don’t understand the difference between you, a law student, and ACB, a judge who has to be unbiased, you should definitely drop out of law school.  For sure.
1316797991706128384 2020-10-16 01:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> And that is why she explained the difference between academia and actually being a judge, as she is now.
1316797776458649606 2020-10-16 01:47:09 +0800 <just_mindy> They’ll be lucky to pass the bar exam
1316796661868498945 2020-10-16 01:42:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @djmooreuk @lyndseyfifield @timjim59 @fashonnaupstate @theferocity What was the point then!
1316788941043961859 2020-10-16 01:12:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @litehearted101 Exactly.  The folks complaining already know who they are voting for
1316788760382767104 2020-10-16 01:11:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @MommaShark36 Absolutely
1316788707861635074 2020-10-16 01:11:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @MommaShark36 They don’t care.  They are afraid Trump will get higher ratings and they is their whole reason for panic
1316787285149577218 2020-10-16 01:05:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrDavidDaniels I mean, watch it on apps even
1316787212533592066 2020-10-16 01:05:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @litehearted101 I don’t get why this is baffling so many folks
1316787094455545858 2020-10-16 01:04:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin Always
1316787032992120837 2020-10-16 01:04:28 +0800 <just_mindy> And why watch Trump if you loathe him so much? Watch Biden, fan girl, wet your pants, get tingles up your leg, and go to bed.  Why do they care what Trump says?
1316786284548034565 2020-10-16 01:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @soccerdhg Probably
1316786247994675201 2020-10-16 01:01:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, this
1316786196354412545 2020-10-16 01:01:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark I mean, at one point the NBA finals and the MLB games were both on at the same time and I had to DVR.  I didn’t scream that it was a miscarriage of justice
1316785791868309504 2020-10-16 00:59:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Unprecedented!!
1316785177662820355 2020-10-16 00:57:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently people haven’t heard of the “DVR” and can’t record one town hall to watch after watching the other town hall? Even us rednecks in the South know about the DVR.
1316784775164760064 2020-10-16 00:55:29 +0800 <just_mindy> So?
1316784431684825091 2020-10-16 00:54:07 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are loathsome
1316772723377438721 2020-10-16 00:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Public schools aren’t “owed” tax dollars.  The students of the state are “owed” tax dollars.  The education is for their benefit.  Let families choose best &amp; least restrictive placement for their child.
1316771985163157507 2020-10-16 00:04:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Public schools take tax dollars from citizens &amp; give them back a subpar product.  Opportunity scholarships allow parents to make better choices for their child.  Kids can’t wait for public schools to improve.
1316771494035427329 2020-10-16 00:02:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 @proteinwisdom And that they don’t check with experts
1316769164040851456 2020-10-15 23:53:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @6doctorb My whole life with men has been a mulligan unfortunately.  I’m proficient with everything except relationships
1316768317449940992 2020-10-15 23:50:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @UncleHotep @BiasedGirl  https://t.co/gnvinp0wAh
1316761154581147653 2020-10-15 23:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @HawleyMO I am eagerly awaiting it
1316760578258595840 2020-10-15 23:19:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @suze109 @jack We shall see
1316760525733326848 2020-10-15 23:19:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @jack Yes!
1316760049310629889 2020-10-15 23:17:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @suze109 @jack I hope so
1316759981350432769 2020-10-15 23:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 @HawleyMO Same
1316758781469040646 2020-10-15 23:12:12 +0800 <just_mindy> My note: @HawleyMO is so fine
1316758669850275843 2020-10-15 23:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Now @HawleyMO speaking.  Says this is attempt by monopolies to rig an election
1316758497418190849 2020-10-15 23:11:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Now Senator Graham is speaking.  He states even if you are a Democrat, this censorship should scare you because it could be you next.  States nothing about Trump has ever been shut down.
1316758137848901632 2020-10-15 23:09:38 +0800 <just_mindy> The Democrats can try to delay the subpoena until after the election but @SenTedCruz hopes they will not.
1316757910811181057 2020-10-15 23:08:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham will issue a subpoena to @jack to testify next Friday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee
1316749128009953281 2020-10-15 22:33:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell It was prescient
1316741642616033286 2020-10-15 22:04:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Miss that man
1316716419959095296 2020-10-15 20:23:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle We sure did!!!  Small but powerhouses!!

1316619580924624900 2020-10-15 13:59:04 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the actual Twitter standard:      Does it hurt Trump?  No.  It’s ok, no matter how it was obtained.     Does it hurt Biden? Yes. Banish it to hell.    We all know this is true.  Let’s stop pretending otherwise.

1316549811760517120 2020-10-15 09:21:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @Justmindy Yay!!  😍😍

1316543564848009216 2020-10-15 08:57:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  They have one narrative
1316543392738934785 2020-10-15 08:56:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb @Justmindy  https://t.co/mA72flaPNJ
1316543325638361088 2020-10-15 08:56:03 +0800 <just_mindy> The pic is just a good hair day for attention.  I really just want friends on Parler so I’m not bored when they boot us all
1316543021379457024 2020-10-15 08:54:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay @Justmindy 😘😘😘😘😘
1316542968371859456 2020-10-15 08:54:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @Justmindy Um look who’s talking and why I always take it as a compliment when RB confuses us 😘😘😘
1316542716482813952 2020-10-15 08:53:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!! They don’t want to defend the opinion the media and their friends told them to have
1316542404070121473 2020-10-15 08:52:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi! I’m @justmindy on Parler, btw.  I’m a conservative woman, and they are getting nervous about us this week because ACB is a dang superstar.  I’ll probably get banned soon, so follow me there pretty please?!  https://t.co/F9BKsd3wvf
1316541409592258560 2020-10-15 08:48:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes there has never been equal conservative representation
1316541194009280518 2020-10-15 08:47:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @GStephanopoulos You know those folks are Democratic operatives
1316541065244147713 2020-10-15 08:47:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Also true
1316540816169590784 2020-10-15 08:46:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly right
1316539856399593472 2020-10-15 08:42:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 She is pretty up front that she hates conservatives
1316539709422743552 2020-10-15 08:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> When you leave your laptop behind at a repair shop and don’t pay the business owner, they own the computer.   He had every right to share info on a computer he now owned
1316538899188117504 2020-10-15 08:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray Oh yes.  They are celebrating this article being blocked
1316538795513257989 2020-10-15 08:38:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Pretty blessed indeed.  Having a partner to share it with would be the cherry on top, but if not, I already have more than I deserve
1316538451840335873 2020-10-15 08:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes.  I tried to move away from Fl once and I couldn’t.  I was miserable
1316538270134738944 2020-10-15 08:35:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray No.  @GStephanopoulos won’t even ask him about
1316537921487462400 2020-10-15 08:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer Clearly
1316537872938340352 2020-10-15 08:34:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 She just hates conservatives
1316537779719991298 2020-10-15 08:34:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Lol!! I have both of those things too
1316537353599692800 2020-10-15 08:32:19 +0800 <just_mindy> You understand the difference between a rally &amp; a social media platform censoring a major newspaper in favor of their preferred candidate, no?
1316536529075011584 2020-10-15 08:29:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I could never leave Florida
1316535956170735616 2020-10-15 08:26:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes.  My soul has to live by the water
1316535665467838464 2020-10-15 08:25:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy Yes.  There is no justification
1316535406414958592 2020-10-15 08:24:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Very true
1316534777986658305 2020-10-15 08:22:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I love living on the lake
1316534188661788673 2020-10-15 08:19:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 That is really my view.  Standing on my porch looking down on my dock. 😍😍
1316533274035056640 2020-10-15 08:16:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes!! In theory!
1316532685326766082 2020-10-15 08:13:46 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no hacking.  The computer was not picked up and the owner followed the law of his state and took ownership
1316532477280817152 2020-10-15 08:12:57 +0800 <just_mindy> The only right thing is to allow the story to be shared.  Period.
1316525727152574465 2020-10-15 07:46:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 She was great.  I believe angels surrounded her
1316525638451433472 2020-10-15 07:45:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb @marcorubio @SenRickScott They better
1316525595703083008 2020-10-15 07:45:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @ugatapie That’s true
1316523513323364354 2020-10-15 07:37:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Or that she was flirting with Ben Sasse
1316523401608130571 2020-10-15 07:36:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @PegLegPilot That’s what all that hate does to you
1316523343567294466 2020-10-15 07:36:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 She makes me ill
1316522958849028097 2020-10-15 07:35:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I know!!! People seem really perplexed
1316522885796724736 2020-10-15 07:34:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Apparently it’s a weird concept
1316522817320558592 2020-10-15 07:34:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I mean, I always end up banging but whatever
1316522692128931841 2020-10-15 07:34:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius I know.  It’s a concept
1316522544913166336 2020-10-15 07:33:29 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope to see something from @marcorubio &amp; @SenRickScott soon!

1316521916598038529 2020-10-15 07:30:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Men and women can actually be kind and have fun with one another without banging
1316521498358804480 2020-10-15 07:29:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @cardi_mark I’d love a guide if you have one!
1316520771708227584 2020-10-15 07:26:26 +0800 <just_mindy> My view is more subtle tonight but still pretty  https://t.co/mDJuQobk7q
1316519618719166479 2020-10-15 07:21:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Exactly
1316519553346818050 2020-10-15 07:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Probably
1316518200142688258 2020-10-15 07:16:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC They didn’t mention the Biden story
1316516365046624258 2020-10-15 07:08:55 +0800 <just_mindy> If you live in Orange or Lake County, Florida, you can start early voting at 10:00 am on Monday 10/19.  Just FYI. #Trump2020
1316516069817962497 2020-10-15 07:07:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Ridiculous
1316515303371739137 2020-10-15 07:04:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq More important to folks in the South tbh
1316514930632294401 2020-10-15 07:03:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax I mean. There is apparently no bottom to their willingness to be humiliated at the behest of the DNC
1316513876960305153 2020-10-15 06:59:02 +0800 <just_mindy> With everything happening in the world, the NBC national news leads off with....Barron Trump had COVId

1316507878228926475 2020-10-15 06:35:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Totally agree
1316507222302695426 2020-10-15 06:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @SaintRPh Yes.  We also have a lot of Anglo/Hispanic in Fl also obviously. It’s really seem as no big deal.
1316505574436151296 2020-10-15 06:26:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely!
1316504680982351878 2020-10-15 06:22:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @SaintRPh Oh yes.  Very common in the South now
1316503308077543435 2020-10-15 06:17:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Preach
1316502102068416515 2020-10-15 06:12:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I’m convinced there is way less racism in the South

1316497333996183557 2020-10-15 05:53:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo!!
1316497194720153603 2020-10-15 05:52:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Fair point. I should have said “leftist males”

1316475900720971776 2020-10-15 04:28:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon It’s what the liberal media would like people to believe
1316475777920139266 2020-10-15 04:27:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I assume @Twitter and @TwitterSafety will block @CoryBooker videos of his questioning of ACB since he is repeating proven lies.
1316470359684714497 2020-10-15 04:06:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Very glad to hear he is well and that like most teens who have contracted COVID is well and healthy

1316389405402202115 2020-10-14 22:44:26 +0800 <just_mindy> “In an attempt to rehabilitate the witness”.  As if, ACB has an image he tarnished yesterday.  That is an actual statement @DickDurbin just made about ACB.  @secupp can I get a mansplaining ruling? This really offended you with Kamala so I know you must be reeling rn.

1316180862594154501 2020-10-14 08:55:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @_Daddy_Ace_ Right? That poor guy
1316180802879795201 2020-10-14 08:55:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly right
1316180741064200192 2020-10-14 08:55:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @skippyisanidiot @redsteeze Funny that
1316179792304238593 2020-10-14 08:51:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @magicalmomU7 So it seems
1316179740072517632 2020-10-14 08:51:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @bostonwriter Slightly
1316179587869667328 2020-10-14 08:50:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @bigdaddyofnine Truth
1316179294780096513 2020-10-14 08:49:31 +0800 <just_mindy> I really wish someone would make a mash up of Northam, his rapey Lt. Gov, Gillum, and Cunningham to illustrate how Dems never pay for their misdeeds
1316178902218354695 2020-10-14 08:47:58 +0800 <just_mindy> For all the discussion about how conservatives let men slide, when Roy Moore was revealed to be scum, Alabama R’s gave up a Senate seat.  Dems protect their own no matter what: blackface, affairs, rape. They circle the wagons. Sick.
1316177322983206912 2020-10-14 08:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd 😂😂😂😂
1316166496217976835 2020-10-14 07:58:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, as the Mom of a First Responder, it’s insulting for Pelosi to invoke her “love for police and firefighters” when her party is LITRALLY putting them in danger every time they go to their jobs with all this racism garbage.
1316166136753512454 2020-10-14 07:57:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi revealed her hand when she said “check with Trump’s name on it in the mail”.  That’s exactly what this is about.  She is fine with Americans struggling because it might help Trump to help them.
1316164728150949895 2020-10-14 07:51:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m grateful he exposed you and your vitriol to the American public tbh
1316162482759766017 2020-10-14 07:42:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala is tee ball and ACB is major league.  There is no comparison.

1316161783330156549 2020-10-14 07:39:56 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s not supposed to be RBG or any other justice. She is supposed to be an independent thinker who applies the law.
1316161421521149953 2020-10-14 07:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not ever astounded by Hirono’s ignorance
1316160750394769408 2020-10-14 07:35:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Bro.  Don’t embarrass yourself trying to polish that turd.
1316160417673207810 2020-10-14 07:34:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 @SenTedCruz @BenSasse It does not
1316158619478634496 2020-10-14 07:27:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @Neoavatara Exactly
1316158018292154379 2020-10-14 07:24:59 +0800 <just_mindy> IT IS NOT GINSBURG’S SEAT!! @SenTedCruz @BenSasse   Please address this tomorrow
1316157250512314371 2020-10-14 07:21:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 Exactly
1316157192958074883 2020-10-14 07:21:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Ginsburg was way more forthcoming because she had been a PP employee.  It wasn’t a mystery.  ACB hasn’t worked for an abortion provider.
1316156878515318784 2020-10-14 07:20:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Way way way out of her league
1316156553469333505 2020-10-14 07:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 She’s much smarter than Kamala.  ACB had to get where she is using her brains.  Kamala took the short cut.
1316156325160783872 2020-10-14 07:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 I get it!!!
1316156244420329478 2020-10-14 07:17:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five @SouthernKeeks With a quickness
1316154914700234753 2020-10-14 07:12:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Your husband is exactly right

1316106417858842624 2020-10-14 03:59:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaxNordau Exactly right
1316106264531927048 2020-10-14 03:59:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle Duh
1316106139885543431 2020-10-14 03:58:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Blumenthal has a lot of nerve to speak about integrity.
1316104407294058500 2020-10-14 03:51:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle But it wasn’t in the OrIGinAL.  😂😂😂
1316102496218238976 2020-10-14 03:44:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, you would never have the balls to ask a conservative woman this to her face
1316102353519509504 2020-10-14 03:43:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @Modern_Templar Fair point
1316101043667832833 2020-10-14 03:38:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I like asking leftist men if they have low T or mommy issues.

1316092968466513921 2020-10-14 03:06:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait. They get to ask her more tomorrow? Someone explain this to me?
1316092584142540803 2020-10-14 03:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Tell them to Google me
1316091429282873347 2020-10-14 03:00:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Thank you!!!
1316091236089036803 2020-10-14 02:59:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG That’s also fair
1316090069317562368 2020-10-14 02:54:58 +0800 <just_mindy> This is driving me nuts and I wish one of the Republicans would correct this.
1316089886026366976 2020-10-14 02:54:15 +0800 <just_mindy> IT IS NOT GINSBURG’S SEAT!!!
1316089666706251781 2020-10-14 02:53:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG That’s pretty terrifying

1316080233821470728 2020-10-14 02:15:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Exactly
1316080183296831488 2020-10-14 02:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Yes, apparently

1316079714965094401 2020-10-14 02:13:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 It’s insane
1316079642541916161 2020-10-14 02:13:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig @Neoavatara True
1316079577127628801 2020-10-14 02:13:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone should tell Klobuchar that Ginsburg is gone now and it wasn’t “Ginsburg’s Seat” and she needs to compose herself and move on.
1316079065976246272 2020-10-14 02:11:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara She is off the rails
1316078996388409344 2020-10-14 02:10:58 +0800 <just_mindy> No, but seriously, Klobuchar needs to take a Xanax
1316078763604676608 2020-10-14 02:10:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Is Klobuchar going to cry?
1316078575695663113 2020-10-14 02:09:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @bearshrugged @amyklobuchar Fair enough

1316078377435095042 2020-10-14 02:08:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG She acts like she is tweaking
1316078002636292096 2020-10-14 02:07:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 She’s aggressive
1316074062414843904 2020-10-14 01:51:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Klobuchar is even acting erratic today.  Trump has broken them all.
1316070817860661248 2020-10-14 01:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally impossible

1316065619347988481 2020-10-14 01:17:49 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, loved @KatiePavlich breaking this down to “a chance for conservative women to finally get a chance at the table” today.  That’s exactly right.

1316063261046046721 2020-10-14 01:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Maybe we need a sanity test and an age test
1316062429332332548 2020-10-14 01:05:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 No.  He’s nuts

1316055343873634304 2020-10-14 00:36:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines He was particularly awful today
1316055283035189248 2020-10-14 00:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Said ACB was not sympathetic enough to the medical stories of people who may lose health care

1316045902294011910 2020-10-13 23:59:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @wajhawk Also true.  I do think there are very good arguments about the lucidity of 87 year old people though
1316045646080749569 2020-10-13 23:58:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree @HoosierInfidel And then let’s move on to almost 90!!!! That’s ridiculous
1316045274595422208 2020-10-13 23:56:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Albany__Rose @Tamzilla_52 Swoon 😍
1316044699317174275 2020-10-13 23:54:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Feinstein was afraid to ask her anything
1316044483017015299 2020-10-13 23:53:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Oh, absolutely
1316044407012032515 2020-10-13 23:53:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree  https://t.co/rO4YgOkX8a
1316044340670746626 2020-10-13 23:53:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Yes!  As someone else said, these aren’t boomers even!! They are parents of boomers!
1316044026756444165 2020-10-13 23:52:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @MitchMidnight @ComfortablySmug New banner.  🥰
1316043583363874817 2020-10-13 23:50:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 Oh yes.  Although in Fl, Rick Scott is our oldest at 67, so not quite so bad
1316042761431404547 2020-10-13 23:46:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!
1316042656192114690 2020-10-13 23:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Both parties do
1316042535266070533 2020-10-13 23:46:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot There’s exceptions but not enough for octogenarian to be next in line to run the greatest country in the world.  AOC isn’t a product of youth but rather ignorance and indoctrination.  She’ll be just as lost at age 70.
1316041543795572744 2020-10-13 23:42:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.
1316041463466164225 2020-10-13 23:41:50 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad was an executive in a Fortune 500 company.  When he turned 59, his company made it quite clear they expected him to retire by 62, at the latest.  An 87 year old running a major company is unheard of and should not be considered in terms of running a country either.
1316040868759994374 2020-10-13 23:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Holy crap!! I didn’t even think of that!
1316040767882883072 2020-10-13 23:39:04 +0800 <just_mindy> There should be zero elected officials that are 87 years old.  That is pure stupidity
1316040448058830850 2020-10-13 23:37:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all?  87?! That’s freaking ridiculous
1316039710230433794 2020-10-13 23:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi Dr. Choi!  Please discuss originalism and the severability clause.  I’ll hang up &amp; wait for your response.
1316038679496925185 2020-10-13 23:30:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally, he’s the poster boy for term limits
1316038483316805632 2020-10-13 23:29:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Durbin doesn’t give a crap about Black or minorities.  If he did, he would be appalled and shouting from the rooftops about the deaths in Chicago &amp; insisting  the people he represents be protected.  Yet every weekend is a new bloodbath.  So eff him and the horse he rode in on.
1316037835334529024 2020-10-13 23:27:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Exactly.  He needs to stop embarrassing himself
1316037136022462468 2020-10-13 23:24:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 😂😂😂😂
1316036801962876928 2020-10-13 23:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 It’s shrieking for attention!!!
1316036734036185091 2020-10-13 23:23:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Literally, Biden ran against him in an election and accused him of everything from killing Big Bird to grandma, but to add insult to injury, can’t even recall his name, calling him the Mormon.  Romney needs to get out of politics. It’s not a gentleman’s game
1316035892855951360 2020-10-13 23:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you “Heather I desperately need the touch of a Man”  https://t.co/1dEc3MENAp

1316025720989126662 2020-10-13 22:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok, Uncle Patty. Why don’t you rest for a bit.  I have to go stir the gravy.

1316025096482373635 2020-10-13 22:36:48 +0800 <just_mindy> LBJ, JFK, RFK, AOC, MLK hardest hit.
1316024565282164739 2020-10-13 22:34:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Listening to Leahy is like talking to my perpetually drunk uncle on Thanksgiving.
1316023634654187526 2020-10-13 22:30:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Thanks, Chad (it’s always a Chad).  The women will try to “yone” our praise for another brilliant woman down.  Sorry we disturbed you.

1316020474619469826 2020-10-13 22:18:26 +0800 <just_mindy> There is so many unsolved mysteries these days.  Maybe aliens?
1316016546997661697 2020-10-13 22:02:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Joe Biden is refused communion at times.  This isn’t a good example.
1316015766693584898 2020-10-13 21:59:43 +0800 <just_mindy> I have a teen and we are slightly affluent.  This lockdown was extremely harmful to my child.  She is a new person back in school with friends and her activities. I haven’t heard one parent friend share their kids flourished.  Like zero.
1316013069688991746 2020-10-13 21:49:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD @SenFeinstein I’m also terrified

1316010750817767424 2020-10-13 21:39:47 +0800 <just_mindy> I wonder why Americans bought so many guns lately, @SenFeinstein. It’s a huge mystery, right?
1316009661246644224 2020-10-13 21:35:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Code3America Hi!! I sent you a DM
1315982758301380609 2020-10-13 19:48:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Black men want prosperity, freedom, the protection of black children in the womb, the preservation of the family &amp; the right to protect themselves.  I’m not floored.
1315974663290458113 2020-10-13 19:16:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @WhiteWolf61 @albertodelacruz Always a huge line at one of those places

1315882955080822785 2020-10-13 13:11:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @KinCali1 Oh of course!!!
1315879575121952773 2020-10-13 12:58:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @xbradtc The perfect metaphor for them.
1315878506757337088 2020-10-13 12:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Acosta &amp; Yamiche would literally hyperventilate
1315877882489602048 2020-10-13 12:51:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @packbrewfan1 I’ve seen it several times today
1315877822733463552 2020-10-13 12:51:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I didn’t even notice that because of all the other dumb.  😂
1315877107713617920 2020-10-13 12:48:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @ModericO She is indeed

1315814937869025281 2020-10-13 08:41:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Gemi Bordelon.  Her husband was a big LSU football player back in the day and now he’s just rich
1315814681618022406 2020-10-13 08:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Hahahhahaha. Actually I just checked again and we were both born in 1975.  So we are the same age
1315814044255780865 2020-10-13 08:38:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Everyone loves an encouraging word once you become a woman of a particular age

1315812462604713986 2020-10-13 08:31:52 +0800 <just_mindy> As a reminder, this woman is a year older than me and if I can ooze sex appeal like a tenth of what she does, I’ll be a happy lady
1315812163387351047 2020-10-13 08:30:41 +0800 <just_mindy> We love you for saying this

1315809914342735874 2020-10-13 08:21:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1315808002423828480 2020-10-13 08:14:08 +0800 <just_mindy> These people have a month to vote! They can also request absentee ballots.  What the hell are you talking about?
1315807649393528833 2020-10-13 08:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Ed_W_Jones You’re not even a Floridian

1315806822947852289 2020-10-13 08:09:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Or Sanford has an airport his plane can easily fly into.  Also, Sanford is 60% Black, so why would Trump choose there if he was a racist?
1315806364304920576 2020-10-13 08:07:38 +0800 <just_mindy> We live in Florida.  Our Governor is not a tyrant.  He isn’t a dictator. He allows us to be adults and make big boy and girl decisions.  Thanks.

1315777665014661125 2020-10-13 06:13:35 +0800 <just_mindy> The overwhelming sentiment I have for the women complaining about ACB today is: get lain.

1315745158428753922 2020-10-13 04:04:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Or women and men can take responsibility and use birth control.  Or that, right?
1315744794505871364 2020-10-13 04:02:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Believe it or not, parents not wanting to parent a child isn’t a reason to justify infanticide. Weird, I know.
1315744367819317250 2020-10-13 04:01:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Black woman are 14% of the population yet 43% of all abortions are performed on Black women.  Literal genocide.

1315729597426806789 2020-10-13 03:02:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe you should find some use for your vagina and you won’t be terrified.  When I’m particularly stressed, I find it extremely relaxing.

1315714752782499842 2020-10-13 02:03:36 +0800 <just_mindy> I love how supportive women are of each other and how we don’t attack characteristics a person has no control over.

1315701060456067073 2020-10-13 01:09:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Lee has been cleared by his Dr to attend.  Anyone who didn’t want to attend could attend via video.
1315697625748955138 2020-10-13 00:55:33 +0800 <just_mindy> The weirdo misogynist sex cult is actually those who insist on unfettered abortion at the expense of women so men don’t have to bear any responsibility for unprotected sex
1315696904508977152 2020-10-13 00:52:41 +0800 <just_mindy> You know the guy with the magic underwear and the dancing horses and the dog on the roof.

1315685729062793217 2020-10-13 00:08:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Mine is bald so I guess I’m an extreme fan
1315684456959807488 2020-10-13 00:03:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s be honest.  If a SC opening comes during an election year and a party has POTUS &amp; Senate, it will be filled.  If they don’t, it won’t.  There’s no reason to pretzel ourselves into feats of logic.
1315680137266987008 2020-10-12 23:46:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba I cannot even

1315671352309882882 2020-10-12 23:11:09 +0800 <just_mindy> And the funny thing is, I want to see everyone get on with their lives just like this (particularly young people) but the hypocrisy is deafening

1315670376513445893 2020-10-12 23:07:16 +0800 <just_mindy> She isn’t shutting him down.  It’s a dance battle, rap battle. She’s talking smack and he is talking it right back.
1315668309308735488 2020-10-12 22:59:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevLRNE @Annie_Bannany Oh did they leave? I missed that!

1315662116070854656 2020-10-12 22:34:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Am I the only one who feels awful that ACB’s kids have to sit through this endless droning? Dear God.  She should get a parenting award for just that.

1315394196719775749 2020-10-12 04:49:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs I think October 2016 was nastier among ourselves with the infighting. Now that most of us have decided to back Trump, the infighting is gone

1315374801125601285 2020-10-12 03:32:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, Tapper is super sweet &amp; loving with Trump surrogates.  Like what planet do you live on?

1315059578648899586 2020-10-11 06:40:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Well, thank you!!! Yes, we have to go on with life
1315059389284392966 2020-10-11 06:39:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We shall see.  I hope UCF can turn it around against Memphis next week
1315059217334775813 2020-10-11 06:38:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany Oh yes.  It’s effecting my Dad that way too.  He’s very down
1315056972669083648 2020-10-11 06:29:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @lifebythecreek @Annie_Bannany My dad’s cancer doc doesn’t want him going anywhere so I’m having to do his errands.  I’m so glad y’all have been able to get this treatment
1315056751662837762 2020-10-11 06:28:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany I absolutely don’t think you should if you feel healthy.  The stats for people age 64 are good as long as they are in mostly good health
1315056428877578240 2020-10-11 06:27:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It was close but Fl was a mess the whole time
1315055389180932097 2020-10-11 06:23:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Much better than the non existent Fl defense today
1315055106249953280 2020-10-11 06:22:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @scissors247 Yes. As long as hospitals are capable of handling patients
1315054743589396480 2020-10-11 06:20:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @FilthyFireman That’s how I see myself lol
1315054697850507267 2020-10-11 06:20:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest It’s time to just move on
1315054094227329025 2020-10-11 06:18:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 @RantyAmyCurtis Agreed
1315054054310121479 2020-10-11 06:18:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Yep!!  He will get them there!
1315053935556734976 2020-10-11 06:17:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Most people are going to get this and most people will recover.  Dragging it out isn’t helping anything.
1315053702579879938 2020-10-11 06:16:49 +0800 <just_mindy> If I was queen, I would say go back to work and school, concerts and regular life, stay home if you are elderly or have another comorbidity, &amp; let life go on. Wear a mask or don’t. Add an extra $150 to any SS check going to someone over 70 for delivery fees.
1315051501463711750 2020-10-11 06:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I miss Scott Frost
1315049989354196994 2020-10-11 06:02:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  They live behind me so he can come to my house to sleep if he needs to.  I’m hoping they can resolve it tonight.  We’ll see.  Yes, the fall wasn’t bad thankfully.   TN is hanging in there.
1315048220456873985 2020-10-11 05:55:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Mine is fashion, snacks, and funny kids. That’s about right.
1315044473806688256 2020-10-11 05:40:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I wish you could send your AC tech.  Our guy is really sweet and is going to try and come tonight.  I can’t believe this GA game
1315042841505271809 2020-10-11 05:33:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @bigdaddyofnine Blessed man!
1315041552692117506 2020-10-11 05:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  UCF is on bye and UF 💩 the bed.  Sigh. I need to turn on the GA game.  My dad fell out of bed and their AC stopped working so I’ve been helping him and calling the AC company lol
1315038672744599553 2020-10-11 05:17:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1315013020867796992 2020-10-11 03:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1315012983408427008 2020-10-11 03:35:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I know the Gators lost.  Bring on your hate.  My Rays won last night so that sustains me.

1314996664130834432 2020-10-11 02:30:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @alx730 Probably
1314996620614930435 2020-10-11 02:30:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest @irishspy Exactly
1314991011882586112 2020-10-11 02:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re a huge POS if you do this to your kid

1314986225309229057 2020-10-11 01:48:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love Me too
1314984682090647553 2020-10-11 01:42:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Welp
1314983399887691777 2020-10-11 01:37:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 They are so deranged they don’t think
1314983266802438148 2020-10-11 01:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy @Autie_Radig Absolutely!
1314983197025996805 2020-10-11 01:36:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Really makes you think
1314983155078701056 2020-10-11 01:36:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @ButchM737 Exactly
1314982182579040257 2020-10-11 01:32:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Autie_Radig @politicsofamy That’s a glow up!!
1314981808149323777 2020-10-11 01:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m shocked
1314981048271417344 2020-10-11 01:28:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 The illusion Trump is going to jail always makes me laugh
1314977010305961984 2020-10-11 01:12:05 +0800 <just_mindy> But if he loses and we lose the Senate, I can assure you Lincoln Project, Bulwark, etc. will have exactly nothing to do with rebuilding the party.  Your ilk are pariahs and will never be welcome in the movement again. Either way, this election is your last grasp at relevancy.
1314976515210313728 2020-10-11 01:10:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone saying “he outsourced judges to the Federalist Society” isn’t the least bit concerned with conservatism.  He may lose badly.  We’ll see. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1314976099638669315 2020-10-11 01:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michstfr1 The economy by all accounts was anemic in its recovery.  Who else picked the judges if not him? This is fascinating to me.  Biden has also been credibly accused of sexual assault. Furthermore, I’m voting for the person who will further what I believe.  That’s not Trump.
1314975611589459970 2020-10-11 01:06:31 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no such thing as “money meant for public schools”. That’s like saying RBG’s SC seat “belonged” to her.  The money is for educating children.  The money should follow the child.  An institution isn’t “owed” public tax dollars when underperforming.
1314975125083742211 2020-10-11 01:04:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Gata!
1314973881388740610 2020-10-11 00:59:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Thank you so very much.  We covet all those prayers
1314972971426029568 2020-10-11 00:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle They lay low!!
1314970592043569152 2020-10-11 00:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michstfr1 Really?  He has selected conservative judges, been full throated in his support of pro-life and 2A, has defended the right of churches to worship, started working on criminal justice reform, fully supports school choice.  What is he missing for you?  He doesn’t talk nice?
1314962468842676229 2020-10-11 00:14:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 @BeIayaSmert It’s through my screen.  I was on the porch with my dad

1314940125852454914 2020-10-10 22:45:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman But this is just one chain of lakes with 2 ramps on it.
1314940004150521858 2020-10-10 22:45:02 +0800 <just_mindy> I tweeted the first video 8 minutes ago and they are still coming.  #Trump2020  https://t.co/gs3gZ2Jy1W

1314937874584875009 2020-10-10 22:36:34 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad was too sick after treatment to take the boat out today so we are watching from our porch.  It keeps going and going.  #Trump2020 #trumpboatparade  https://t.co/AxNOau1yuR
1314936281093242881 2020-10-10 22:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Hellnutt @HolmesJosh And it’s not just the cheating.  It’s the multiple affairs, it’s sleeping with your mistress in the bed you share with your wife.  That’s next level humiliation.
1314934857273933825 2020-10-10 22:24:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines Gosh I hope so

1314923225680416768 2020-10-10 21:38:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @GodIsMaestro @exjon They only understand power
1314922642940596224 2020-10-10 21:36:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Many of us voted for Johnson in 2016 because the other 2 were unpalatable.  It was more that Johnson was a decent human who cared about liberty than alignment with the Libertarian platform.  Trump has now proven he will protect conservative ideals, mostly.

1314915228463833088 2020-10-10 21:06:35 +0800 <just_mindy> This win was God’s little kiss to @RonDeSantisFL after Joe Cuomo talked about him.
1314914764192198656 2020-10-10 21:04:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not crying, you’re crying
1314913873095536645 2020-10-10 21:01:11 +0800 <just_mindy> I love these guys with my whole heart.  They’ve got good Florida man spirit.
1314910997195390976 2020-10-10 20:49:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Judd is right
1314908654978596864 2020-10-10 20:40:27 +0800 <just_mindy> This.  Why can’t people have a good life doing good work and just loving their families? That should be enough.

1314788413946712064 2020-10-10 12:42:40 +0800 <just_mindy> You need new friends
1314788298162929664 2020-10-10 12:42:12 +0800 <just_mindy> I just called Cal Cunningham a smug bitch if it makes you feel better.
1314787936857214976 2020-10-10 12:40:46 +0800 <just_mindy> The US is far from having the highest COVID death rate, so that’s wrong, and also you’re Canadian so just be glad we continue to let your country exist. Sleep well knowing we protect you.
1314782941575290880 2020-10-10 12:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It would be better if he stopped being so smug
1314782484073263104 2020-10-10 12:19:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @WellSetBanana Agreed

1314781960397639681 2020-10-10 12:17:01 +0800 <just_mindy> There are absolutely other women and anyone watching this, knows it
1314781454430330880 2020-10-10 12:15:00 +0800 <just_mindy> A man that will bang his mistress in his own house, doesn’t give a crap about you
1314781163760824321 2020-10-10 12:13:51 +0800 <just_mindy> And he did it in the home he shares with his wife which is incredibly demeaning
1314780778065211394 2020-10-10 12:12:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Cal Cummingham and his pecker apparently are concerned with multiple things.

1314777130128019456 2020-10-10 11:57:49 +0800 <just_mindy> He means Rays/Braves obvs
1314777035294810114 2020-10-10 11:57:27 +0800 <just_mindy> No one has to admit that
1314776757816438784 2020-10-10 11:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Sorry Florida men excel when the world is on fire.  It’s just how we do.

1314775165927129088 2020-10-10 11:50:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberBinGA Yes!!!  There have been 4 known cases at my daughter’s school and none of them caused a huge outbreak
1314774983667843073 2020-10-10 11:49:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes, they did.  Since we know kids aren’t as susceptible, they probably either had it and were asymptomatic or they didn’t get it.
1314774668264583168 2020-10-10 11:48:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @KinCali1 Of course
1314774216718389248 2020-10-10 11:46:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom Exactly!!  Even conscientious people get it!!
1314774082265788417 2020-10-10 11:45:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 If their parents are conservative.
1314774008706064387 2020-10-10 11:45:25 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW, people on this thread acting like ACB is a pariah, there is an excellent chance you and your kids will pick up this virus eventually so maybe cool it.
1314773557763862528 2020-10-10 11:43:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray They are just disgusting.
1314773473709957122 2020-10-10 11:43:18 +0800 <just_mindy> And ACB had it months ago and from everything “science” tells us, is immune now.
1314772839258619904 2020-10-10 11:40:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 😂😂😂
1314772793419014144 2020-10-10 11:40:35 +0800 <just_mindy> They all tested negative so apparently Brett could use a day back in school to review reading comprehension
1314772261455441920 2020-10-10 11:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> She needs to not be a SC justice because her kids tested negative for a virus?
1314772057503215618 2020-10-10 11:37:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Nice mother and grandmother judging another woman’s parenting abilities.  Very feminism.

1314771474822160387 2020-10-10 11:35:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Because their Mom is a conservative.  That’s all the reason they need to harass children.

1314604658850234368 2020-10-10 00:32:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeBiden Are you going to pack the court?
1314604344533282816 2020-10-10 00:31:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Listening now
1314604215717765122 2020-10-10 00:30:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLoneRedshirt @RagnarsMate Good!! I have been happy!
1314603755191635969 2020-10-10 00:28:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 I hope they know that
1314603694831398915 2020-10-10 00:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Exactly!!!
1314603630520139776 2020-10-10 00:28:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLoneRedshirt @RagnarsMate Are you happy?
1314603556062859264 2020-10-10 00:28:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate Oh my!! What a mess.  Thankfully the people who chose virtual here are a separate issue.  Sometimes I think teachers don’t want to learn.
1314603268211965952 2020-10-10 00:26:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve heard this frequently!
1314599070724509698 2020-10-10 00:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate I’m so glad mine is back in school. She could not sit in front of the computer for 7 hours.  It was a mess!!!!
1314598862003335170 2020-10-10 00:09:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @awstar11 @CamEdwards 💕💕💕
1314598752515129345 2020-10-10 00:09:01 +0800 <just_mindy> What about the stress of kids being home with no supervision, assistance, food, social services?  What about kids not receiving services they need?
1314597771790503939 2020-10-10 00:05:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Open up schools!!
1314597375374229504 2020-10-10 00:03:32 +0800 <just_mindy> And I hope no matter what happens, they never get another job within the GOP.  Even if you dislike Trump, their stated mission to defeat Senate Republicans is inexcusable &amp; they deserve no harbor.
1314596902948745217 2020-10-10 00:01:40 +0800 <just_mindy> We like to call her fake @DrBiden

1314595553234300929 2020-10-09 23:56:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @CamEdwards Praying and ready to donate.
1314563262550355968 2020-10-09 21:47:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you, Dave!! 💕💕💕
1314523089758281728 2020-10-09 19:08:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Totally agree
1314510393503551489 2020-10-09 18:17:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Is the American dream: a country welcomes you and your family as refugees from your war torn homeland, you rise to one of the highest offices in the land &amp; then complain abt that country non stop while funneling campaign cash to your new husband after you divorce the old one?
1314508872183406598 2020-10-09 18:11:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans “attack” because Biden refuses to answer a question seems like weird framing
1314385664620855296 2020-10-09 10:02:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike I am a sucker for a good love story
1314384646709407744 2020-10-09 09:58:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike I love that
1314380725685231628 2020-10-09 09:42:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 Exactly!!!
1314374909016117248 2020-10-09 09:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU True that
1314374839067648000 2020-10-09 09:19:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love She does
1314370065782001664 2020-10-09 09:00:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Representation is important including inside the conservative movement  https://t.co/4xIOPfu1vz
1314369811204444162 2020-10-09 08:59:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Very true
1314369070637166592 2020-10-09 08:56:20 +0800 <just_mindy> People say these same things about Pelosi. By the way, they’re true about her as well.
1314368701026754561 2020-10-09 08:54:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Hmmm.  Seems like you are the one making judgements on a whole swath of people you don’t know based on an anecdote.  Maybe you’re the classist trash, here. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1314368332678733824 2020-10-09 08:53:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Or Kamala’s facials were rude and annoying.  Just as if I made them, and I do.  And then people tell me my face is rude and annoying.
1314359666332364801 2020-10-09 08:18:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 Always is
1314359622631936002 2020-10-09 08:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Gotta get one more in before the election!! High is 90 and low is 75 and rain isn’t coming until the afternoon!
1314358446062481409 2020-10-09 08:14:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 Absolutely!!!!
1314358367285137409 2020-10-09 08:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Levimatron So far, he hasn’t disappointed me
1314358291028377600 2020-10-09 08:13:30 +0800 <just_mindy> The Senate should vote on ACB tomorrow.  Pelosi wants to be dumb. Show her you’ll fight back
1314357910403723264 2020-10-09 08:12:00 +0800 <just_mindy> If you are in the West Orange/Lake County area of Central Fl, we have the Trump Boat Parade this weekend, October 10 at 10:00 am.  We are beginning on Lake Minnehaha at Cypress Cove Marina. If you don’t have a boat, you can flag wave from the 561 Bridge or Lake Hiawatha Preserve.  https://t.co/omx8iPRBVI
1314353017047613441 2020-10-09 07:52:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish Yes.  It would be interesting to hear more his plan
1314352591405551617 2020-10-09 07:50:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s so nice!! That made my night!!  We are doing our best to keep our head up and be positive!! One day at a time

1314350020754321412 2020-10-09 07:40:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @jack @TwitterSafety @Twitter! I know y’all only police the conduct of conservatives, but just for funsies, can you look into a death threat.  Thanks!!!
1314349479949078528 2020-10-09 07:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish Sounds like a death threat
1314348782377730048 2020-10-09 07:35:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You best come with more than just your SAG card &amp; hairdresser.
1314348378499809280 2020-10-09 07:34:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 He thinks it makes Trump look bad
1314348227945213952 2020-10-09 07:33:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer  https://t.co/iP7X4jgimq
1314347604713635840 2020-10-09 07:31:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I love Pence but that’s not his vibe.  Dan Crenshaw, that’s a vibe.
1314346846429552641 2020-10-09 07:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd That’s true.  Just refuse to take a stand on any topic.
1314346382287867904 2020-10-09 07:26:11 +0800 <just_mindy> A favorite tweep can use some help. If you have a bit to spare, I know he would appreciate it!!
1314346070894407680 2020-10-09 07:24:57 +0800 <just_mindy> He was worth waiting for
1314345704958066688 2020-10-09 07:23:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy 😘😘😘😘
1314344868131602433 2020-10-09 07:20:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Love always finds a way
1314344638912892928 2020-10-09 07:19:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not reading the rest, but that line rings entirely true.
1314344185214926848 2020-10-09 07:17:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenniferlee_75 @SeanBannion I bet!!
1314344141837537281 2020-10-09 07:17:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Ha!   I wish I could take credit.  It was Jesus or karma
1314343627288645633 2020-10-09 07:15:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenniferlee_75 @SeanBannion That looks so good
1314343495457529857 2020-10-09 07:14:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 You’re alive!!! Good to see!
1314343398397153280 2020-10-09 07:14:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @litehearted101 @ajzeigler Mark Knoller
1314343270542082049 2020-10-09 07:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I know.  I’m super disappointed
1314342354728476673 2020-10-09 07:10:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe the journalists should chill with the constant snark and just report the news and then they wouldn’t get the day wrong.  🤷🏼‍♀️ Also, he used to be way better than this.
1314341830721523714 2020-10-09 07:08:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric She is so ridiculous
1314341475933720577 2020-10-09 07:06:41 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s Thursday night
1314341009057361921 2020-10-09 07:04:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Be careful what you wish for
1314340436023095299 2020-10-09 07:02:33 +0800 <just_mindy> After Pelosi’s latest stunt, let’s do it
1314335011156504576 2020-10-09 06:41:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Anything to excuse incompetence
1314334882210951169 2020-10-09 06:40:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley In my head many times.  No, at a company function she got really drunk and acted a fool and got fired the next day
1314332960401821696 2020-10-09 06:32:51 +0800 <just_mindy> The crazy boss who tried to ruin my career for me.  She actually did for a while but thankfully she’s gone now.
1314332789500710912 2020-10-09 06:32:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g That’s the truth
1314329574088617984 2020-10-09 06:19:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I know Lucy from Charlie Brown and her fee for counseling lol.  I appreciate you always remembering and asking about him.  It means a lot to me
1314329287978364929 2020-10-09 06:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy They could keep negotiating I suppose but Pelosi wasn’t budging.  That’s different than literally refusing to tell the American public if you plan to blow up the SC or not
1314320447153070081 2020-10-09 05:43:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  He is doing ok today.  They gave him something for nerves so that has been a HUGE help.  He was able to go with me &amp; buy a washing machine.  I was happy about that
1314312191806517248 2020-10-09 05:10:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 @CindyPerry6 @debates The Biden campaign had everything to do with this.  If Biden’s campaign said they would participate in person, there would be an in person debate.
1314311886796709896 2020-10-09 05:09:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy A stimulus bill demanding no more cash bail, nationwide mail in voting and all the other crazy things Pelosi is demanding isn’t going anywhere.
1314310667286048768 2020-10-09 05:04:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @MarcusHUSA @varadmehta Same here!! Also no problem.
1314309917864538113 2020-10-09 05:01:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish It definitely would not
1314309817855549461 2020-10-09 05:00:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @soccerdhg That’s the truth
1314309735584276491 2020-10-09 05:00:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Extreme!
1314309692596912133 2020-10-09 05:00:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany Shocks me
1314307625564229632 2020-10-09 04:52:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So this is supposed to be like a fun surprise? That’s not how this  works.
1314307107882180637 2020-10-09 04:50:07 +0800 <just_mindy> All this move does is make Pelosi look desperate.  Period.
1314262491686371328 2020-10-09 01:52:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Ha!!!  Clearly he needs a wake up call
1314262364771016710 2020-10-09 01:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanLtcR Ha!! I need to discuss that with him
1314260216507179010 2020-10-09 01:43:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I feel like he’s not taking my new rules very seriously  https://t.co/OcX3NAhGce
1314259985354948610 2020-10-09 01:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s the truth  https://t.co/QpSGiVmZ28
1314257158951907329 2020-10-09 01:31:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I wonder if @DanicaPatrick expected the other race car drivers to go slower for her, give her prime pole position every race, draft for her because of toxic patriarchal culture, or talk more quietly when they were around her? Or did she just ask for equal opportunity? Hmmm.
1314256036086374406 2020-10-09 01:27:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @aggierican @TCC_Grouchy  https://t.co/vzbeXEe3Vq
1314255252959371264 2020-10-09 01:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> “The best me has his arms around you” 😍😍😍   https://t.co/ZrvaPtaRj8
1314254327255621632 2020-10-09 01:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> It was down one day.  They extended the deadline another whole day.  This is ridiculous
1314253646733901824 2020-10-09 01:17:41 +0800 <just_mindy> With friends like this....
1314251001722023938 2020-10-09 01:07:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yes the LGBT has been surprising but great!!
1314249296783519748 2020-10-09 01:00:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @MomTo6Lambs Me too
1314249262650269696 2020-10-09 01:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Dems never do well with Cubans but he’s doing way worse than ever.
1314248854196424707 2020-10-09 00:58:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Why is Pelosi refusing COVID testing?
1314248611753005059 2020-10-09 00:57:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Nancy Pelosi is way more impaired on a regular basis than Trump has ever been.  And, she refuses to test for COVID.
1314247268468482049 2020-10-09 00:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @joe_duque2 @KurtSchlichter Right.  And the man should say thank you
1314247149593526272 2020-10-09 00:51:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @darrellpwest @KurtSchlichter Precisely
1314244570226536448 2020-10-09 00:41:37 +0800 <just_mindy> I think the Biden campaign is making a huge mistake not to debate in person.  The debate was in Miami, a city in a state Biden needs, in a Latino area Biden can’t afford to lose, yet it appears he is bleeding support.  Not a good look to not show up.
1314243390339461121 2020-10-09 00:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @ValeriaPugliesi Clearly
1314242666570436609 2020-10-09 00:34:03 +0800 <just_mindy> No. This is McConnell saying he is in charge of the Senate and made decisions there and POTUS controls the executive and he made decisions there.  This actually shows Trump isn’t a dictator trampling on the other branches of government &amp; their autonomy.  That a good thing.
1314240101698985987 2020-10-09 00:23:52 +0800 <just_mindy> You mean he considered the data and made a decision based on his status as a free man in America?  How could he?
1314222573526319109 2020-10-08 23:14:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Also, I’m in trouble
1314221366053306368 2020-10-08 23:09:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @shipthesememes I’m sure they did
1314221025828261888 2020-10-08 23:08:04 +0800 <just_mindy> This guy is insane
1314220822148640768 2020-10-08 23:07:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Oh of course!!
1314220602518110209 2020-10-08 23:06:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @NormanFBirnberg And it was going on during the campaign

1314220320425947139 2020-10-08 23:05:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep!!  Usually they are Dems

1314214700834525184 2020-10-08 22:42:56 +0800 <just_mindy> You can tell he’s a Personal Injury Attorney watching this.  He’s been watching John Morgan tape. He sounds just like him.

1314210653305860101 2020-10-08 22:26:51 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t rely on any face.  I rely on being more competent.  Try that.
1314209463050539008 2020-10-08 22:22:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes, it makes it hard to have personal relationships with co-workers for sure
1314209317000671234 2020-10-08 22:21:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 😂😂😂
1314208819824660481 2020-10-08 22:19:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 There have been days when my dog couldn’t and I celebrated when they finally could so I feel this is journal worthy stuff.
1314207565299900416 2020-10-08 22:14:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Yep!!  Would be perfect!

1314206633753362432 2020-10-08 22:10:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yep.  That’s the whole plan
1314206280966262791 2020-10-08 22:09:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Or a former Governor of SD
1314205783383445505 2020-10-08 22:07:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Me too

1314205338833313792 2020-10-08 22:05:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse @KamalaHarris Amy Klobuchar would tell people to stop the mansplaining defense.  I truly believe that
1314205148944637953 2020-10-08 22:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I just need a ruling on when it’s ok to challenge a woman who is asking to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, actually.
1314204612837040128 2020-10-08 22:02:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATLSAHM @emzanotti Me too, particularly when a woman is asking to run the free world
1314204494540926981 2020-10-08 22:02:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse @KamalaHarris Absolutely.  Pence has 4 years experience as VP under his belt and knows the foreign policy goals of this admin
1314204131427520512 2020-10-08 22:00:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I think personal interaction is different than someone going to a job interview to run the world
1314203979941900288 2020-10-08 22:00:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATLSAHM @emzanotti Oh yes. Now we must be very gentle and never interrupt the women
1314203858894155778 2020-10-08 21:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @lifebythecreek Exactly right
1314203822940655616 2020-10-08 21:59:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk @Neoavatara  https://t.co/ukUyD5kbe8
1314203700554993665 2020-10-08 21:59:13 +0800 <just_mindy> If after watching @KamalaHarris last night whither next to basically Mr. Rogers, you want her standing toe to toe with Putin or Xi, then vote for the Democrats.  No one who cares about their children’s future and this country can truthfully say they feel confident in her.
1314203131111038985 2020-10-08 21:56:57 +0800 <just_mindy> One more time:  absolutely zero people believe Biden will last 4 years.  So Kamala is actually the candidate.  She couldn’t handle MIKE PENCE who never raised his voice. This woman is going to negotiate with China and Russia on behalf of me and you?  No thank you.
1314202459791912960 2020-10-08 21:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick Exactly
1314202288777506821 2020-10-08 21:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Why didn’t he hide under the table and let Kamala talk?!
1314201810501074945 2020-10-08 21:51:42 +0800 <just_mindy> 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼a must read!!
1314201689906466816 2020-10-08 21:51:14 +0800 <just_mindy> To summarize, the feminists, the Media and leftists (but I repeat myself) are mad that: Pence called the moderator by her correct name, talked for a shorter amount of time than Kamala, talked at all, and kissed his wife.
1314201147893116928 2020-10-08 21:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 Well said
1314197445392424960 2020-10-08 21:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany She makes me nuts
1314196700005830657 2020-10-08 21:31:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs @lazyone2222 Yes!!!
1314195869667938305 2020-10-08 21:28:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs @lazyone2222 Exactly
1314195846033014784 2020-10-08 21:28:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 @vbspurs I agree
1314195813652934656 2020-10-08 21:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany So very vapid
1314194924355624960 2020-10-08 21:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 @vbspurs It’s true
1314193471377465344 2020-10-08 21:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m assuming they do married people things so I’m pretty sure her unmasked self near her husband is ok.
1314190924113678337 2020-10-08 21:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> If you keep your body clean, than scream. Peace out.    (This is actually a really vulgar song and and I changed the word to body and y’all won’t get the reference because you don’t listen to what I listen to while I’m working out).
1314188699110969344 2020-10-08 20:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @EEElverhoy 🥰🥰🥰
1314188652021452804 2020-10-08 20:59:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Your character is not “something other than the issues”.  The fact nudes of you could drop any minute, is a spectacle and a problem. That you slept with another woman in the bed you share with your wife speaks to your judgement. Sorry, Cal.
1314188005729603585 2020-10-08 20:56:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick 🥰🥰
1314187869397962752 2020-10-08 20:56:19 +0800 <just_mindy> No we aren’t.  I’m a woman who doesn’t need a Hollywood actor or a journalist making excuses for my poor performance with accusations of misogyny.  No mam.  Either I hold my own with a man, or I’m not the best person for the job.  Period.
1314187000392671235 2020-10-08 20:52:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorraineHirsch @lyndseyfifield @MarkRuffalo @KamalaHarris Harris spoke for 3 1/2 more minutes total than Pence.  Your argument is factually inaccurate
1314186757634691073 2020-10-08 20:51:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, I’m sure Putin and Kim Jong Un will review “Ruffalo’s rules for dealing with precious women” and abide by them in negotiations.  I don’t want someone this delicate representing the US.  Sorry.
1314186242519642112 2020-10-08 20:49:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman @office_chick Exactly
1314185624627351552 2020-10-08 20:47:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like the lavish funerals that took place all summer when no one else was allowed to grieve their relatives? Yep, it sucks when our political class lives by different rules.
1314184630308876290 2020-10-08 20:43:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Exactly!!
1314184583794102273 2020-10-08 20:43:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius Oh yes!! Very threatening!! Lol
1314184485605388288 2020-10-08 20:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s right.  If you can’t run with the big dogs, stay on the porch.
1314184348397174784 2020-10-08 20:42:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Exactly what I just posted!! I’m sure Putin will be careful not to mansplain
1314184110294937600 2020-10-08 20:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> What the Press is inadvertently admitting when they cover for Harris this way, is she can’t handle it.  They are saying she is so fragile, we have to run cover for her to mitigate her poor performance last night.  We’ve nothing substantive so we’ll throw out misogyny.
1314183663375052800 2020-10-08 20:39:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Negotiating and holding power in the room is a huge part of relationship and consensus building with other nations.  If Kamala cracks because a man challenges her, how will she deal with N. Korea? Putin? Is she going to cry “mansplaining” to the press if Putin interrupts her?
1314182918814793728 2020-10-08 20:36:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius Oh my word!!  It’s ridiculous
1314182700098564096 2020-10-08 20:35:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t give a damn about Kamala’s feelings or Pence’s feelings. Answer the questions, if someone interrupts you, do it back to them, whatever you need to do to get your message out.  But stop whining and acting like women are so tender and precious we whither around men talking.
1314182193846071297 2020-10-08 20:33:45 +0800 <just_mindy> And journalists like Tapper &amp; @GStephanopoulos and Andrea Mitchell pretending like mansplaining should be a thing we are discussing after 2 people debate, 2 people who could be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, is insulting to the American public.
1314181663182774272 2020-10-08 20:31:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I do my best to be respectful of my partner who has earned some deference, but otherwise, I’ll argue with a man the same way I would a woman.  And if a woman can’t hold her own with a man, leading the free world probably isn’t for her.
1314181190245642243 2020-10-08 20:29:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m so weary of the mansplaining garbage and maybe it’s because I grew up the only child of a domineering father &amp; a submissive Mom.  I learned quickly he would bulldoze me if I didn’t defend myself, and it prepared me for the world.  There isn’t a man that intimidates me.
1314180665529847808 2020-10-08 20:27:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok. Enough with this mansplaining bologna.  If women want equality, you don’t get to cry when a man goes toe to toe with you.  If you can’t deal with someone with the demeanor of Pence, some of these world leaders will really rock your world.  Kamala needs to grow up.
1314163935336189953 2020-10-08 19:21:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman I’m really really sure

1314039652538626048 2020-10-08 11:07:21 +0800 <just_mindy> In Biden’s current state, everyone knows he won’t make it 4 years.  You saw Harris tonight. They are back door pushing in a radical leftist agenda.  Don’t allow it.  #VicePresidentialDebate #VPDebate2020 #VPdebate

1314036837682479104 2020-10-08 10:56:10 +0800 <just_mindy> As a Christian, don’t believe Trump is a Christian if you choose.  No one at all can question the sincerity of Pence’s faith and that’s who I want a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  He will ensure the church is protected.  #VPDebate2020 #VPdebate

1314029860340236288 2020-10-08 10:28:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @CoachMarcWilson That was the most dishonest tweet I’ve seen tonight
1314029723660570624 2020-10-08 10:27:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut There is no evidence at all for S.E.’s claim
1314029609185415170 2020-10-08 10:27:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Pence was far and away the winner in this debate.  His calm demeanor is reassuring and I feel comfortable knowing he would step in and be President if Trump could not. Harris as President is terrifying.  #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate  #Trump2020
1314029063942672395 2020-10-08 10:25:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u Amen

1314027719567511555 2020-10-08 10:19:56 +0800 <just_mindy> I choose to believe God send the fly to give Pence super powers #VOTE #VPDebate

1314022589401051138 2020-10-08 09:59:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom It’s getting ridiculous
1314022512079122434 2020-10-08 09:59:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Harris has spoken for more time than Harris
1314022196335898626 2020-10-08 09:57:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC At least she actually says what they really believe

1314021672782098434 2020-10-08 09:55:54 +0800 <just_mindy> AOC tells the truth, at least
1314021459031994369 2020-10-08 09:55:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala has spoken for 4 minutes straight now
1314020344815144960 2020-10-08 09:50:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Denise_1Cor1558 It’s the follow up time I’m wondering about
1314020261935677440 2020-10-08 09:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 I think so too
1314019417869742080 2020-10-08 09:46:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Can someone do a time comparison between Pence and Kamala.
1314018121938808833 2020-10-08 09:41:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe 😂😂😂
1314017248043040769 2020-10-08 09:38:19 +0800 <just_mindy> There is a definite difference
1314016061436710912 2020-10-08 09:33:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!

1314006522427564032 2020-10-08 08:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> While we are discussing abortion, Black Mothers are 14% of the population yet 44% of babies murdered in abortion clinics are Black.  That’s a literal genocide happening under our noses but Trump hurts my feelings and stuff.
1314005429802938370 2020-10-08 08:51:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 Beauty
1314004824720105473 2020-10-08 08:48:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeSilverman7 @SaintRPh @noahsmom7 Calm down
1314002309416968192 2020-10-08 08:38:58 +0800 <just_mindy> If you read the Bible, men like king Nebuchadnezzar were hardly righteous.  They were vulgar and sinful.  But Neb protected God’s people.  That was his role.  Same with Cyrus.
1314001714123603968 2020-10-08 08:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, the church &amp; its voters need to distinguish between people called to build the church (the faithful) &amp; people called to the messy, get in the mud work of defending and PROTECTING the church.  That’s Trump.  He’s proven he will do it. That’s his role. He’s not a Pastor.
1314000725492609024 2020-10-08 08:32:40 +0800 <just_mindy> That should be the attitude of every Believer
1314000620848848897 2020-10-08 08:32:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Evangelicals should care about the life of the unborn, our ability to worship and spread the Gospel, the ability to practice religious conscience in every facet of life, &amp; the protection of Israel &amp; safety of American Jews who are currently being targeted.  Period.
1313999718410792965 2020-10-08 08:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> This is a lie.  Trump designated the KKK as terrorists on 9/25.

1313997804373766150 2020-10-08 08:21:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I know but we can pray for Pence to be bold and calm

1313996915848212480 2020-10-08 08:17:32 +0800 <just_mindy> And doesn’t want you to be able to gather in church, but opening the casino and flying on planes and having street parties is fine.
1313996636855599104 2020-10-08 08:16:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Praying people, say one for Mike Pence, because we know he will be debating the moderator and Kamala.
1313996201558188032 2020-10-08 08:14:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 They know it’s a bunch of crap
1313996120331374592 2020-10-08 08:14:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Right?  There are more kids in my daughter’s high school

1313995773164560385 2020-10-08 08:12:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Glad to see the makings of a ratio happening here.  This guy is a complete hack, trying to accuse a Navy Vet who happens to be Latino, of sympathizing with the KKK. @ksatnews you aren’t giving us your best.
1313995001886629890 2020-10-08 08:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> What do the eyes mean Dillon?  Are you side eyeing a hack reporting job? Surely that’s what it means.
1313994816993329152 2020-10-08 08:09:11 +0800 <just_mindy> An important discussion on the KKK? Is it 1960? Can anyone confirm we are in 2020 for me?
1313994556468350976 2020-10-08 08:08:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump designated the KKK a terrorist organization on 9/25, bro. Is there lots of KKK activity happening in Texas I’m unaware of? Do citizens of Texas list the KkK as a top concern?
1313992222963052547 2020-10-08 07:58:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 There is also nude pics and that is ripe for blackmail
1313992074308595718 2020-10-08 07:58:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Morgan Wallen broke the rules of the left and didn’t wear a mask while making out with U of Alabama co-Ed’s this weekend so now @snl cancelled his appearance.  Reminder SNL cast regularly overdose &amp; die and stuff but not wearing a mask is too far.
1313991267274162176 2020-10-08 07:55:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @RichardGrenell And they all lie to her so, this is on brand

1313981177271914497 2020-10-08 07:14:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines At least Edwards was held accountable
1313981096439222272 2020-10-08 07:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @WellSetBanana And they’re right!
1313981035361832960 2020-10-08 07:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> But ignoring it completely is brand new.  Dude is tweeting about the census today
1313980864657870849 2020-10-08 07:13:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa He’s got cooties for all kinds of reasons
1313979994356547589 2020-10-08 07:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> He can’t wear a mask correctly and he’s a disgusting cad.
1313979661135814657 2020-10-08 07:08:58 +0800 <just_mindy> The Daily Beast managed to turn this into an ad for how mean Republicans are to poor Cunningham and he’s raising money off it.  Gross.
1313978406250442753 2020-10-08 07:03:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, Cal Cummingham is trying the new Ralph Northam playbook of just ignoring scandal &amp; if you’re a Democrat, the media will make it go away.  Disgusting.
1313978034362494976 2020-10-08 07:02:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Romantic tweets?? How about the banging in the home he shares with his wife? Or the mocking her husband’s suicide attempts? Or even the second mistress who has been discovered.  Or maybe the nude photos she alleges are out there?
1313976190177214464 2020-10-08 06:55:10 +0800 <just_mindy> A blue check can tweet this and that’s fine.  Interesting

1313937215333060608 2020-10-08 04:20:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Lee is good with a man sleeping with his mistress in the same bed he shares with his wife.  That’s the kind of guy Lee approves of.  I hope Lee isn’t married. If he is, his wife should check his phone .
1313936431413370880 2020-10-08 04:17:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So did you count your mistress as living in your house or? Or do y’all just bang there?

1313909515809689601 2020-10-08 02:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 I don’t know what to think
1313908373042102272 2020-10-08 02:25:42 +0800 <just_mindy> There is zero chance Biden is up 11 points in Fl.  You would be hard pressed to find a Dem who wouldn’t laugh at that.  I fully believe Trump will win Fl, but if he doesn’t it will be a 1-2 point loss

1313869431358066689 2020-10-07 23:50:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Too low brow
1313868955405213701 2020-10-07 23:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> A great example of implicit bias in Media: “@GStephanopoulos worked for the Clintons. Now, he pretends to be a straight news reporter”.  Do you think he might have an implicit bias towards Democrats?

1313867018563719168 2020-10-07 23:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @debitking @KamalaHarris Of course not.

1313866057787019264 2020-10-07 23:37:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jamisen That’s insane.
1313866019216261130 2020-10-07 23:37:24 +0800 <just_mindy> So Moss is going to bang her staff and then act like a martyr? Sounds like straight to Pornhub to me.
1313865140551417856 2020-10-07 23:33:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jamisen This is the first I’ve heard it and I’m very online
1313864698853457922 2020-10-07 23:32:09 +0800 <just_mindy> She could have made that a teachable moment.  “We can disagree with the President’s policy while not using the r word out of respect for the differently abled” and then move right along.  The fact she wasn’t struck immediately at the offensiveness at that statement is telling
1313864116801613824 2020-10-07 23:29:50 +0800 <just_mindy> In case @KamalaHarris isn’t aware, using the verbiage “retarded” as a pejorative is a no no.
1313863906071400452 2020-10-07 23:29:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Can someone ask @KamalaHarris tonight at the debate why someone calling the POTUS “mentally retarded” was greeted with “well said” by her?!
1313862581086556160 2020-10-07 23:23:44 +0800 <just_mindy> “Mentally retarded” and the crowd cheers and Kamala responds “well said”? Is this real life? If a Republican had said this, it would be all over Twitter

1313854345369325570 2020-10-07 22:51:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @SoRealJC @SaintRPh I should take up the moniker
1313854172815659011 2020-10-07 22:50:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh That’s a good reason to care
1313854091693625344 2020-10-07 22:50:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Mike Murphy, if you will all remember, spent the Jeb! money  destroying @marcorubio or attempting to, &amp; is a reason we have Trump.  Now, he’s getting rich grifting to “defeat Trump”, an issue he helped create. Nice work if you can get it.

1313603901015437312 2020-10-07 06:15:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Considering calling him Cal Cummingham but is that too much?

1313601211728310274 2020-10-07 06:05:09 +0800 <just_mindy> If Tillis wants to flip some votes, run with the CUNNINGHAM CHEATED IN HIS OWN HOUSE angle.  You’ll lose every Southern woman with a quickness.  cc: @ThomTillis
1313600541784772609 2020-10-07 06:02:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Bro, if any man ever cheated with a woman in my house, it would be on like Donkey Kong.  My first husband cheated but not in my house.

1313598498315603974 2020-10-07 05:54:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Gross.  Cunningham slept with his mistress in the house he shared with his wife.  Guys? Let’s not do this. It’s trashy.

1313568503639748608 2020-10-07 03:55:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @MollyRatty @chrislhayes Exactly
1313568454583226368 2020-10-07 03:54:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Ok we def get wild hogs aplenty!!
1313568273485770753 2020-10-07 03:54:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty Right?? This mindset is the antithesis of a free society.
1313567580829949952 2020-10-07 03:51:30 +0800 <just_mindy> He has no problem tweeting this, friends.  This is who they are.
1313567362852024320 2020-10-07 03:50:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty I mean, if folks can’t see it, I don’t even know what to say.  He’s literally tweeting it
1313567087948894208 2020-10-07 03:49:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoseMar39348119 Yes!
1313566028677476352 2020-10-07 03:45:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow.  Prayers for his family
1313565709889417217 2020-10-07 03:44:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Armadillos are the worst for destroying AC units in Fl
1313562847914401794 2020-10-07 03:32:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @PastorKynan Def listen!!
1313562779706589189 2020-10-07 03:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelDKocian @PastorKynan Yes and I think a lot of Christians have erred in trying to make him like us, when God knew “us” weren’t equipped to fight the cabal as Pastor Kynan terms it
1313562461228933121 2020-10-07 03:31:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s for dang sure
1313562361714880512 2020-10-07 03:30:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @PastorKynan He actually mentions LBJ in his talk
1313560639164624896 2020-10-07 03:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s true
1313560537364656130 2020-10-07 03:23:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 Absolutely
1313560485388849155 2020-10-07 03:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelDKocian @PastorKynan But his behavior as a Believer had bothered me at times.  This talk allowed me to see his role isn’t to me my Pastor.  He’s fighting some really terrible enemies and it requires his demeanor
1313560080596504577 2020-10-07 03:21:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac @PastorKynan I was changing the sheets on my bed and listening and it was such an aha for me!
1313559797569073152 2020-10-07 03:20:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Azusa Street was began by a black man with one eye who could barely read.  Anyway, listening to @PastorKynan gave me clarity and offered new understanding I wanted to share. If you’re not a Christian, I love you &amp; you can scroll on by if this isn’t for you.  🥰🥰🥰
1313559236396421120 2020-10-07 03:18:21 +0800 <just_mindy> The last thing @PastorKynan said is God revealed to him in a dream there is a pervasive effort to destroy the Black community via abortion &amp; the destruction of foundations because the Black Church have long been keepers of the faith. Pentecostals &amp; other charismatics can testify
1313558702574776322 2020-10-07 03:16:14 +0800 <just_mindy> This climate is hostile to the church.  We see it w/ casinos open, protests happening, airplanes flying, but churches forced to remain closed.  Yesterday, Cuomo threatened to close synagogues. He had no fear of making that threat.  It’s time for the scales to fall off our eyes
1313558096732655617 2020-10-07 03:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> So when people say, Trump is so brusque and rude and not nice, how can Christians vote for him? Because he has and is proving he will protect the church. That’s his role.  Period.  He is picking judges that protect us. He’s doing what God ordained him to do.
1313557670792658946 2020-10-07 03:12:08 +0800 <just_mindy> And @PastorKynan continues:  Pastors &amp; Christians are in charge of building the church. Trump wasn’t tapped by God to build the church. Stop expecting him to behave like a Pastor.  Trump’s role is to PROTECT the church &amp; y’all sometimes bodyguards aren’t cute and don’t play nice.
1313556960042774535 2020-10-07 03:09:18 +0800 <just_mindy> So @PastorKynan was talking about his own realizations about current politics and he said God revealed to him there is difference between the “builder of the church” and the “protector of the church”.  Y’all, this is so good.  Christians are characterizing Trump incorrectly.
1313555086849839113 2020-10-07 03:01:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine @dbetzel Particularly on Friday afternoon

1313538979204128768 2020-10-07 01:57:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @e2pilot Absolutely!!  I plan on it!
1313521194596012032 2020-10-07 00:47:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @e2pilot He definitely has flipped police and fire.  Fire, particularly used to always be Dem, and their National Union still endorsed Biden but tons of state unions were furious about it and came out vocally about it.
1313520591266369538 2020-10-07 00:44:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Then let’s just vote
1313519451816550401 2020-10-07 00:40:15 +0800 <just_mindy> This is gaslighting and every honest broker knows it.  It’s laughable she isn’t being called on this.
1313518348278300672 2020-10-07 00:35:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBTX2017 It sure doesn’t!

1313504552776327168 2020-10-06 23:41:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Another person who thinks a fence stops a wild boar
1313504408609730563 2020-10-06 23:40:29 +0800 <just_mindy> A question someone who has never dealt with feral hogs would ask.  The answer is no, they will destroy your fence, your crops, your yard and your house foundation if given the chance

It’s not enough to just be vocal about support for Israel.  We need to be visible and vocal on behalf of Jewish Americans.

1313167368831594496 2020-10-06 01:21:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @BJLoVerde Truth
1313167287189491716 2020-10-06 01:20:53 +0800 <just_mindy> No Matt!! Biden is leading by 1700 points nationally.  That’s why they are all acting like hysterical ferrets.
1313166753992761345 2020-10-06 01:18:46 +0800 <just_mindy> The Trump family were masked at the debate until they were seated and socially distanced (same thing that happens in restaurants).  I don’t know why people continue to say they were not masked
1313165062794813440 2020-10-06 01:12:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Then why doesn’t she say that
1313164937766809603 2020-10-06 01:11:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine You know what’s worse than that? No nookie.  Something to think about.
1313164498166059009 2020-10-06 01:09:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi is second in line to the Presidency.  Why is she refusing daily testing?
1313161832090292224 2020-10-06 00:59:12 +0800 <just_mindy> But also this looks like a list of things you tweeted to highlight your technical and medical expertise which is great, but none of what you listed is info the general public needs or understands.
1313161113782153217 2020-10-06 00:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Why doesn’t CNN send you instead of Acosta who asks dumb questions every day? Have you asked?
1313160869992333312 2020-10-06 00:55:23 +0800 <just_mindy> My feelings also.  I used to be the person who would research down ballot races &amp; occasionally vote for a more qualified Dem. Not any more. Sen. Bill Nelson proved to me there was no longer a moderate Dem &amp; any Dem will join with their party no matter what.

1313155401962188801 2020-10-06 00:33:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Is it dangerous when my son rides in an ambulance with a COVID patient wearing the same protective gear the SS has on? My son is also doing medical procedures on the patient. Probably, but that’s his job.  Just like this is their job.

1313143186370551815 2020-10-05 23:45:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Friends, even if you do all the right things, mask up, wear your gloves, wash your hands, we are all likely going to get this.  It’s not if.  It’s when. Blaming people for contracting a virus is silly.  If you need someone to blame, blame China.
1313134430618345474 2020-10-05 23:10:19 +0800 <just_mindy> These are all examples of people taking public transportation.  Not riding in their personal armored vehicles.
1313133927557668865 2020-10-05 23:08:19 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my students was making an office hours appointment with me and ended our text exchange like this.  17 and 18 yr olds are funny.  🥳🤪  https://t.co/2mmscUIFT5

1313077544535678977 2020-10-05 19:24:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @deerskin1789 I’m so sorry!!!! Sending healing prayers and hugs!
1313077061456736256 2020-10-05 19:22:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yeah he’s completely stable and sane
1313076947753332736 2020-10-05 19:21:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Exactly
1313076893768392705 2020-10-05 19:21:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @JustEric It’s astounding.
1313076832120573952 2020-10-05 19:21:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @CaptainDeplora8 Yes
1313067778723717121 2020-10-05 18:45:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @CaptainDeplora8 Project Lincoln
1313067478709350408 2020-10-05 18:44:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @JustEric That’s what I’m saying.  The guy can’t do anything right.  Yes, it would be best if he rested quietly in the hospital for his health.  But when he does that, they say he’s on death’s door!
1313067035560116224 2020-10-05 18:42:31 +0800 <just_mindy> This thread is deranged

1312979649526460418 2020-10-05 12:55:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman They would lose it
1312978975006830593 2020-10-05 12:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Tonight they are saying it’s North Korean style

1312977436888502273 2020-10-05 12:46:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Now the left is convinced this was a body double.
1312974710976770048 2020-10-05 12:35:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh And you know that answer
1312919664276762624 2020-10-05 08:56:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 @SaintRPh They’re running rampant on Twitter lately
1312919451134840833 2020-10-05 08:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And apparently there was an outbreak back in August at SS headquarters so logistically there would be immune personnel
1312919051476312064 2020-10-05 08:54:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrewHolden360 Yes!!!! Please Drew!

1312916101626564608 2020-10-05 08:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @FreeTreeBark100 Such a nice sentiment to root for the financial ruin of your fellow citizens
1312915933061578753 2020-10-05 08:42:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s for sure
1312915826035642372 2020-10-05 08:41:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @razonie Of course!
1312914562459545601 2020-10-05 08:36:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @rcjparry @RBPundit Ahhhhh makes sense

1312906075717369856 2020-10-05 08:02:55 +0800 <just_mindy> To be fair @JohnEkdahl tried to warn us
1312905709114265600 2020-10-05 08:01:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @rcjparry @RBPundit Oh I didn’t realize she’s an abortion doc
1312904514773684224 2020-10-05 07:56:43 +0800 <just_mindy> And that’s why the POTUS making appearances normal people wouldn’t make is valuable
1312903366394208258 2020-10-05 07:52:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @realboochon That’s for sure
1312902240785629185 2020-10-05 07:47:41 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s exactly right
1312901240020520960 2020-10-05 07:43:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth She would try
1312898890098671616 2020-10-05 07:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Good luck doing that to the President of the United States
1312898137556758529 2020-10-05 07:31:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @SaintRPh Yes.  Matt had stated earlier it was a pretty common steroid so I was surprised when I read this lady stating this
1312895668885880832 2020-10-05 07:21:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Speaking of @Travistritt one of my all time faves of his     https://t.co/kKDsANnun9

1312895138075729921 2020-10-05 07:19:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @independentgrly She has gone off her rocker
1312894637611405312 2020-10-05 07:17:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jcburley @realDonaldTrump Right?
1312894511144677376 2020-10-05 07:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Exactly!

1312893475789078528 2020-10-05 07:12:51 +0800 <just_mindy> As if the SS isn’t around him constantly sick or well
1312893337377136640 2020-10-05 07:12:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Could any drug Rubin is taking contribute to her inability to comprehend how insane she sounds?

1312892589335621633 2020-10-05 07:09:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh That’s what I thought but I wanted to check with someone who actually knows
1312891462108024833 2020-10-05 07:04:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Cc:  @SaintRPh is this true
1312890145608265728 2020-10-05 06:59:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge True!
1312890023071625216 2020-10-05 06:59:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @BooRad859 And it’s better ice cream than you eat too
1312889887180419073 2020-10-05 06:58:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Yep!
1312885306656522242 2020-10-05 06:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> I just wanted to pull the band aid off quick so y’all wouldn’t be shocked that the leader of the Free World lives differently than you.
1312885075265163265 2020-10-05 06:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> To all the people shocked POTUS is getting better medical care than you:  (clears throat) He also: eats better food than you, lives in a nicer house than you, has a better staff than you, has better protection than you, flies on a better plane than you, has better cars than you.
1312883673583280129 2020-10-05 06:33:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maureen22198991 @OneFineJay Yes
1312883429076328450 2020-10-05 06:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @technonovice That would be great!
1312880191321055233 2020-10-05 06:20:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @independentgrly Me too
1312879932314390529 2020-10-05 06:19:02 +0800 <just_mindy> So @cnn finally admitting the SS agents had on masks, protective eyewear and gowns as I said 20 minutes ago
1312878272888410113 2020-10-05 06:12:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe everyone decided the most important thing was Americans seeing their leader was healing and strong and Trump having COVID isn’t like your friend having COVID because your friend doesn’t run the country.
1312877477438554112 2020-10-05 06:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Me too
1312877326133321734 2020-10-05 06:08:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Mark please don’t start doing this.  You used to be the one readable journalist left
1312876613042876418 2020-10-05 06:05:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @OceandocScott As usual
1312876566020489216 2020-10-05 06:05:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Do any of us know if those SS agents may have already had it? Are we saying masks don’t work now because the SS agents are masked.  They are also wearing gowns.  Someone should tell @cnnbrk @CNN
1312875346954510337 2020-10-05 06:00:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @kpsmith46 Apparently not since they are saying those SS agents are going to die now
1312875165051744261 2020-10-05 06:00:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Anyone that gets on a subway in NY tomorrow is way more in danger of catching COVID from a fellow passenger than what Trump just did
1312874786398314496 2020-10-05 05:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jones4440 Exactly!!!
1312874577417166848 2020-10-05 05:57:45 +0800 <just_mindy> You are an insane person
1312874167583244288 2020-10-05 05:56:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @KurtSchlichter Yep.  It’s what my son wears
1312873154818330624 2020-10-05 05:52:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest She does
1312872993014636544 2020-10-05 05:51:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @selfdeclaredref 😂😂😂
1312872516248051713 2020-10-05 05:49:34 +0800 <just_mindy> are you asking Kamala to arrest him or?
1312872241630244866 2020-10-05 05:48:29 +0800 <just_mindy> And everyone was masked and wearing gowns.
1312872116870578177 2020-10-05 05:47:59 +0800 <just_mindy> He didn’t interact with the public crazy person
1312871314634551297 2020-10-05 05:44:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok all those panicked, everyone in the car with Trump had on full gown and mask and Trump was masked.  Trump didn’t exit the car.  You can all breathe.
1312869730001334272 2020-10-05 05:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> He never got out of his vehicle and was wearing a mask.
1312868600118677505 2020-10-05 05:34:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @UriBlago @bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump You know they will
1312868555105370112 2020-10-05 05:33:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @jones4440 @JohnEkdahl That’s also perfect!
1312823011280662529 2020-10-05 02:32:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes!!!  Perfect!!! Lol@
1312819931273064448 2020-10-05 02:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Truth
1312808946151944197 2020-10-05 01:36:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I also love a firm eggplant, fake Dr. Jill.  🍆 🍆
1312808223955705857 2020-10-05 01:34:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  I hate the feminists for this.
1312806529565888517 2020-10-05 01:27:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve watched this 20 times.  It’s hard to see someone else living your dreams.
1312803218427179008 2020-10-05 01:14:12 +0800 <just_mindy> By your logic people who pay no taxes deserve no medical care?
1312802864088133632 2020-10-05 01:12:48 +0800 <just_mindy> A note:  we saw her practically collapse into a van and her campaign refused to release basically any info
1312802357785309189 2020-10-05 01:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> The real victim is his wife but she has decided to stay with him, so again, she has agency.  She knows what he is capable of.
1312802095398105088 2020-10-05 01:09:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Baby Mama is a lawyer.  Let’s stop acting like women have no agency and can’t decide not to sleep with married men and can’t practice birth control.  Is he a prick for not caring for his son?  Yes, if true.  But let’s stop petting her like she has limited capacities or something.
1312800971681148929 2020-10-05 01:05:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @NursePatrickQ I hope she has at least switched to Lights and quit the Reds now
1312800555320909826 2020-10-05 01:03:37 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Miller is a total cad but let’s be clear, Baby Mama knew he was married and for some reason, grown people didn’t practice birth control.  Let’s stop acting victimized.
1312800042865098758 2020-10-05 01:01:35 +0800 <just_mindy> How could anyone just be hearing of Miller’s child support and custody case? His Baby Mama has tweeted about it literally every day for the last 2 years.
1312798954371903490 2020-10-05 00:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @PetiteNicoco @_CrotalusAtrox_ I heard his mom stays hunkered down
1312798559360757760 2020-10-05 00:55:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins Right.  As long as he has an R after his name, they’ll never like him
1312798433225441280 2020-10-05 00:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 Definite TDS everywhere
1312797080851800091 2020-10-05 00:49:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins It really makes me question his motives.
1312796913058680834 2020-10-05 00:49:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @mooshakins Allow the Doctors to give medical updates.  This seems like a no brainer. It’s like when a Doc comes and gives an update to a family and then one family member goes on FB and adds their own commentary.  Never helpful.
1312796242376880128 2020-10-05 00:46:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins I mean, Meadows knows how this press is!!  Why do such a dumb thing
1312796070934704131 2020-10-05 00:45:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 It really is
1312795788427382784 2020-10-05 00:44:41 +0800 <just_mindy> He should be.  Meadows was out of pocket.
1312795065362898944 2020-10-05 00:41:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @CraigR3521  https://t.co/EOsN2o6XU9
1312794495277293574 2020-10-05 00:39:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  This is the one that makes me laugh the most
1312793626934743040 2020-10-05 00:36:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Also yes
1312793568587788289 2020-10-05 00:35:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 Right!  He is allowed a measure of privacy
1312792832957087744 2020-10-05 00:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> The Dr said he could be released as early as tomorrow.  They said his Oxygen level is 98 now. That’s really all the public needs to know.  We aren’t entitled to know the intricacies of his lung cilia. This is getting absolutely ridiculous.
1312790993092173825 2020-10-05 00:25:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 Yes he did.
1312790430203994112 2020-10-05 00:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s terrifying
1312790303502479366 2020-10-05 00:22:53 +0800 <just_mindy> He won’t win Florida.  Anyone who lives here knows that.  Even the Dems who live here know the chance of them winning here is low.
1312778765127294982 2020-10-04 23:37:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 I’m so glad we have Desantis
1312778664107540482 2020-10-04 23:36:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @rechnen And again you have the issue of incubation and time to show symptoms being too short since the rose garden event
1312778285408030722 2020-10-04 23:35:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @rechnen But it’s fine if you’re protesting
1312778220085878785 2020-10-04 23:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @CraigR3521 Yes!
1312778166478540803 2020-10-04 23:34:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @dieseldave97 Exactly
1312762734644277250 2020-10-04 22:33:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 😂😂😂
1312758536225591301 2020-10-04 22:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I like this.  A lot.  The positivity.  The let’s get it done mentality.
1312757787542290439 2020-10-04 22:13:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 I’m shocked he hasn’t embraced masks.  We know how he loves to dress up!
1312757551377809412 2020-10-04 22:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Exactly!!
1312757262948196353 2020-10-04 22:11:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear True
1312757210884321280 2020-10-04 22:11:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Leftists are so bizarre

1312756228544749573 2020-10-04 22:07:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Interesting.  I forgot Northam had it. I thought only dumb Republicans caught COVID.  We know Northam is a particular fan of masks of many kinds.  Wonder how he got it.
1312754718838599681 2020-10-04 22:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Because of my Dad’s cancer, he and my Mom sent in their ballots but we sent them in already and I will track them online to ensure they were received (that’s an option in our county).  So it you mail and can track, please double check.
1312754325693837312 2020-10-04 21:59:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Piggybacking on Mickey (@BiasedGirl) please try to vote in person this year.  It will make election night much clearer.  Also, drive someone else to the polls.  We have early voting in our huge library so I know we can social distance and vote safely.
1312753505162203142 2020-10-04 21:56:40 +0800 <just_mindy> As do all the rest of the conservative academics.  We know better.
1312752770533986304 2020-10-04 21:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @BeltoWNC Seriously? How strange!!
1312752655895277569 2020-10-04 21:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is an example.  Even Trump showing severe symptoms on Thursday don’t fit this “Rose Garden Massacre” Timeline.  We know Hicks showed symptoms on Wed.  That would have only been 4 days after this.  No way.  Plus Tillis has it &amp; was wearing a mask at this event.
1312751674482663427 2020-10-04 21:49:23 +0800 <just_mindy> So all the “WAIT TWO WEEKS” and “YOU WONT KNOW ANYTHING FOR 2 WEEKS” any time DeSantis does any opening of Florida, becomes 2 DAYS if it happens in DC?  There is no way the ACB ceremony was the super spreader event and it also belies what we know a hit outdoor transmission.
1312750973526446081 2020-10-04 21:46:36 +0800 <just_mindy> So, to buy what Democrats and Media are selling, we have to believe in 2 1/2 days, POTUS/ First Lady started having symptoms and went to the debate any way.  2 1/2 DAYS for a virus we know can have a 10-14 day incubation period and then another 3-5 days for symptoms to begin.
1312750229511385089 2020-10-04 21:43:39 +0800 <just_mindy> ACB’s Rose Garden ceremony was 9/26. This is the event being dubbed the “super speeder”. The Left &amp; Media (but I repeat myself) want us to believe Trump &amp; FLOTUS knew they had COVID on debate night 9/29. That flies in the face of everything we know about this virus.
1312748154043936768 2020-10-04 21:35:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 He can’t because the House controls the purse strings. The travel ban (it wasn’t a Muslim ban as 3 of the world’s largest Muslim countries were not on the list), fell under National Security &amp; he is given a wide berth to make executive decisions in that regard.
1312606673308090368 2020-10-04 12:13:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Oh my word!!!  That’s crazy!!!  My son’s department hosted the Brotherhood Ride today. He said it was neat having them.
1312606263025569793 2020-10-04 12:11:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie It is very sad
1312605389041664002 2020-10-04 12:08:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BellAMerican Exactly right
1312605330161971200 2020-10-04 12:07:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  I blame the Media for filing people with this invective
1312605163853578240 2020-10-04 12:07:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB Fair point
1312605112590893056 2020-10-04 12:07:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac I know.  She needs an intervention
1312605036376137728 2020-10-04 12:06:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love At some point, people are so toxic, you have to.  A daughter posting a pic of her father while he is sick should not invoke this sort of vitriol
1312604576198123520 2020-10-04 12:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I really did not like President Obama.  If he had a health crisis, however, I would never have of dreamed of commenting something nasty if his daughters chose to post a pic honoring him.  What is wrong with people?
1312604108113817600 2020-10-04 12:03:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I find it unbelievable too but that’s what her Wash Post Bio says
1312603966337937408 2020-10-04 12:02:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Right.  You would think they could control themselves until he is well
1312603567430172672 2020-10-04 12:00:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay She actually has a husband and sons. That’s why this astounds me!
1312603477865123840 2020-10-04 12:00:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig Exactly
1312603417089576960 2020-10-04 12:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  It was a bad day for many teams
1312603146728992769 2020-10-04 11:59:11 +0800 <just_mindy> There are several offices in the Presidential wing.
1312602979971850240 2020-10-04 11:58:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You people are really sick.  Normal daughters post nice tributes to their parents on social  media during a health crisis.  That event makes you realize how precious your parents are to you and it’s a sentimental gesture.  You’re a mother. You should know better.
1312602277400715265 2020-10-04 11:55:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We don’t deserve to be
1312601987947671552 2020-10-04 11:54:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta Judging from the outcome of that campaign? Yes.
1312601601782185985 2020-10-04 11:53:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Take a look in the mirror
1312601499638394880 2020-10-04 11:52:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Love the underlying misogyny here that an accomplished woman and mother is still begging for her Father’s approval &amp; can’t just be posting a photo because she chose to honor him out of love.
1312599067273441281 2020-10-04 11:42:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  That’s my only comfort.  The Gators won
1312595662207365121 2020-10-04 11:29:27 +0800 <just_mindy> And she learned nothing
1312590119384371200 2020-10-04 11:07:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 They are a whole mess tonight
1312590026753048577 2020-10-04 11:07:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons True!
1312585384971431941 2020-10-04 10:48:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Not usually this bad
1312584096397373441 2020-10-04 10:43:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest He’s such a drama Queen
1312583386511355904 2020-10-04 10:40:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons Right!! He has an office there and the Doctors have access to everything they need
1312582165540958214 2020-10-04 10:35:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons Pretty sure the President isn’t taking up beds meant for others in the Presidential suite at Walter Reed.  Unless she is talking about Christie and I’m quite sure he has health challenges
1312580295233806336 2020-10-04 10:28:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ See?  They’re peaceful.
1312578751969013760 2020-10-04 10:22:15 +0800 <just_mindy> They’re peacefully protesting Auburn.

1312570623307251713 2020-10-04 09:49:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m dying

1312567347241250819 2020-10-04 09:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Sends out a tweet calling all Republicans stupid or racist and is shocked people might reply.
1312564212129030144 2020-10-04 09:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany No don’t!!!  More is better
1312562132685389825 2020-10-04 09:16:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It’s not so bouncy today because they are letting so few fans in but once it can fill up again, it will bounce like it should again
1312558283958484992 2020-10-04 09:00:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank goodness because our offense is trash today
1312558201909506049 2020-10-04 09:00:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’m fun but loud.  Cute is probably in the eye of the beholder lol
1312556839012360194 2020-10-04 08:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I told you we are a mess tonight.  I scream and clap loud
1312555465079959553 2020-10-04 08:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It just means you have good taste!  https://t.co/vz2jc8C447
1312554358693933057 2020-10-04 08:45:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Why do you require that number?
1312554202007252992 2020-10-04 08:44:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’m hoping we move up.  It’s really rainy here so that’s not helping
1312553636858417152 2020-10-04 08:42:27 +0800 <just_mindy> The CDC recommends children NOT wear masks when engaging in outdoor activity as the masks get wet with sweat and inhibit breathing.  They should social distance. So, your child’s ballet school isn’t following guidelines.    https://t.co/OU8Ru2AjiB
1312551699735867392 2020-10-04 08:34:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We still look sloppy but we are hanging in there
1312548290584621056 2020-10-04 08:21:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Right.  I would put nothing past her

1312547412997701633 2020-10-04 08:17:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle I get it
1312546028650979328 2020-10-04 08:12:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Yes.  I have a hard time with her in general

1312541867943264256 2020-10-04 07:55:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Interception, Baby!!! #UCF
1312541073886130178 2020-10-04 07:52:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Or they believe in school choice, or they are pro-life, or they believe in the ability to protect yourself as the 2A provides, or they believe in less taxes and smaller government
1312538622273351680 2020-10-04 07:42:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @bithits Always the “they protest too much” syndrome
1312538343746363393 2020-10-04 07:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobsFunGirl @Neoavatara I am worried because of his color but his voice is strong
1312537165285388288 2020-10-04 07:37:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes.  Those movies terrified me
1312537110398681095 2020-10-04 07:36:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @bithits Exactly
1312536989128749056 2020-10-04 07:36:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem Exactly
1312528817135603712 2020-10-04 07:03:50 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are insane.  This is in reference to our President, btw.  https://t.co/Rj9h7sMk76
1312522078222909441 2020-10-04 06:37:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Proud of you!!! ❤️❤️
1312517763538120705 2020-10-04 06:19:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle I do too and I might kind of believe part of it
1312517551298019329 2020-10-04 06:19:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons @Darth_Mommie Oh I’m so sorry.  He’s sorry.  He’s a good boy
1312511948206956544 2020-10-04 05:56:48 +0800 <just_mindy> All these replies “oh he can just check in?”.  Y’all know good and well that man is obese, probably has diabetes and high blood pressure, and if he has had any breathing issues, he will be admitted. Some of y’all need to chill.
1312497395649769472 2020-10-04 04:58:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Yep.  Many republicans were so angry after the way the Dems acted and how Mitt was so complacent, it started this Trump phenomena
1312496559582445569 2020-10-04 04:55:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And while it was kind for Mitt to forgive, the damage wasn’t just to him.  Reid muddied the political discourse &amp; took character defamation to new heights. Mitt was the figure Reid used, but the damage was done to all Americans &amp; trust of our institutions.
1312491952567316480 2020-10-04 04:37:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 It’s ridiculous
1312490730057654273 2020-10-04 04:32:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @APLMom Did they say 96 was concerning!?

1312488480644034560 2020-10-04 04:23:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @MizElizaBennet Yes!

1312482902664331264 2020-10-04 04:01:23 +0800 <just_mindy> This never happened.  The US never had overcrowded hospitals
1312482515756576768 2020-10-04 03:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @GeorgiaPeachesT Yes he’s always very measured and responsible
1312481979997188096 2020-10-04 03:57:43 +0800 <just_mindy> He walked to the helicopter on his own yesterday but he’s going to die in 3 days.  K.

1312480540105142272 2020-10-04 03:52:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @dana_ma It’s an enigma
1312479726452137984 2020-10-04 03:48:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton Probably a LP bot
1312478321179992065 2020-10-04 03:43:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @bothofus7 @AmberBinGA Yes!!! Or heard helicopterS
1312478243820249089 2020-10-04 03:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @dana_ma All conspiracy theories have to have some grains of truth
1312478020276416512 2020-10-04 03:41:59 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m convinced these people are paid to say this embarrassing nonsense
1312477725123178497 2020-10-04 03:40:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve literally never seen people who are so naive and dumb think they are so wise and nimble as people who worship the LP founders
1312473231400476673 2020-10-04 03:22:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrishFowler10 If the Dems don’t deny it, it must be true!
1312472780751790082 2020-10-04 03:21:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy @SpeakerPelosi That’s how this works, right?!
1312470949829074945 2020-10-04 03:13:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 They would certainly accuse the GOP of it
1312470814084616193 2020-10-04 03:13:21 +0800 <just_mindy> See how easy it is to just make up facts to fit whatever narrative one would like?
1312470660698927104 2020-10-04 03:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh also all the Dem Senators thought ACB was going to get COVID from the person they sent in to her ceremony so that’s why they refused to meet with her.  It wasn’t about ethics.  They knew she had been exposed to COVID &amp; thought she could give it to them.
1312470077229330433 2020-10-04 03:10:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Or maybe the reporter intended it.  Who knows!
1312469629109825537 2020-10-04 03:08:38 +0800 <just_mindy> I have as much evidence for this as yall do for calling these Doctors at Walter Reed liars and quacks.
1312469368559693824 2020-10-04 03:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> They figured they would get ACB and Senators sick, as well as the President, and that would delay her confirmation until after the election.  That’s my theory and unless Nancy Pelosi denounces it, I’ll assume it’s true
1312468923359481856 2020-10-04 03:05:50 +0800 <just_mindy> If we are going to peddle in conspiracy theory, I’m going to just say the Dems sent someone in with CoVID to the Barrett ceremony to infect as many people as possible.  They wanted ACB also but didn’t realize she was immune.  This was Nancy’s “arrow in her quiver” she discussed.
1312467932736233472 2020-10-04 03:01:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Indeed
1312467883725709312 2020-10-04 03:01:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberBinGA It was this one  https://t.co/PgR87RGFuz
1312467615940403200 2020-10-04 03:00:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Who cares?
1312466869995991040 2020-10-04 02:57:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Yes!! Apparently these are quacks or something
1312466772436500481 2020-10-04 02:57:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @CillizzaCNN They act like these Doctors are Q or something
1312466662088609792 2020-10-04 02:56:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Exactly!!!
1312466601514397696 2020-10-04 02:56:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @TolleCpa 🙌🏼
1312464278184632321 2020-10-04 02:47:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis Those movies freaked me out!!  I kind of want to rewatch now.  They are on Amazon prime!
1312464130083713025 2020-10-04 02:46:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 They don’t!
1312464056498831361 2020-10-04 02:46:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This is inflammatory.  These are highly trained professionals &amp; officers in the Army &amp; Navy.  To question their integrity over tiny errors relaying info is ridiculous
1312459988212695042 2020-10-04 02:30:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis We had to watch it every year starting when I was like 9
1312459867983020032 2020-10-04 02:29:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis Yes!!  Here is the trailer!!!  https://t.co/8ze75LrcDG
1312459186349907971 2020-10-04 02:27:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Ethical_Ethyl @atomickristin I live in Fl and I didn’t know about this!!
1312459050655776768 2020-10-04 02:26:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Ha!! I’m trying to remember that movie!!
1312458205042106368 2020-10-04 02:23:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse Yep! He might be more palatable to some Christians who can’t vote Trump
1312458050368729088 2020-10-04 02:22:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok other people who grew up Fundamentalist or Pentecostal.  The Rapture movies we all watched in the 80’s, doesn’t the President get sick and everyone speculates he is dead but then he is healed.  Y’all help me remember.
1312457483739262976 2020-10-04 02:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse They are hoping for his death
1312457411811180545 2020-10-04 02:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdh_jr As she should have been
1312456239536730112 2020-10-04 02:15:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdh_jr A great idea
1312456163758231554 2020-10-04 02:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> This same press will then ask why the White House isn’t answering more questions and why the Docs aren’t updating more.  Maybe because when they do, y’all say they’re lying anyway. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1312455314675916800 2020-10-04 02:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin Yes!!!!  You aren’t a princess.  Y’all can build together
1312455194530082817 2020-10-04 02:11:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ReturnToGlory93 Oh RTR has shown up in my mentions
1312455048434085888 2020-10-04 02:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @TolleCpa I will hate for the both of us
1312449065586626561 2020-10-04 01:46:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist I love it!!
1312449029976940545 2020-10-04 01:46:47 +0800 <just_mindy> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1312448927778578433 2020-10-04 01:46:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Oh next week you and I will have to smack talk
1312448557991907329 2020-10-04 01:44:54 +0800 <just_mindy> His brother’s name is Hawke. They have big boy names.
1312446374676320256 2020-10-04 01:36:14 +0800 <just_mindy> 🐊 🐊
1312444478842523653 2020-10-04 01:28:42 +0800 <just_mindy> He was reared in public housing by a single mom and become a millionaire.  Yeah, he’s real dumb
1312444219168968704 2020-10-04 01:27:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The American people are entitled to know generally how our President is doing &amp; if the 25th has to be invoked.  We are not entitled to the very minutia of his healthcare.  He’s still a human with some privacy and agency.
1312443478157135873 2020-10-04 01:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @realDonaldTrump Glad to hear it!! Continuing to pray for you and our @FLOTUS
1312442317878427649 2020-10-04 01:20:07 +0800 <just_mindy> I still wake up every Saturday rooting for this.
1312440953077030912 2020-10-04 01:14:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes please
1312429919637516288 2020-10-04 00:30:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @daysathome It’s so awesome you see it that way!!!!  I know it is so beneficial for your kiddos!
1312428889671716865 2020-10-04 00:26:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @daysathome That is my daughter’s school protocol as well
1312428793802510337 2020-10-04 00:26:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @JCoopWylie @sarah_wxtx That’s so awesome!!
1312428729424056320 2020-10-04 00:26:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @birdandwolf That’s great!!!
1312428688940707841 2020-10-04 00:25:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Oh yea
1312428646452408327 2020-10-04 00:25:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @lammyleap Absolutely!!!
1312427335082270720 2020-10-04 00:20:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @JCoopWylie @DRussell76 @sarah_wxtx That’s smart!!
1312427282288517121 2020-10-04 00:20:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @JCoopWylie @sarah_wxtx And look how long y’all have been married!
1312427131431944193 2020-10-04 00:19:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @lammyleap It is.  I’m so glad my child is back in school.  She is so much happier
1312425649156624384 2020-10-04 00:13:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Please remember Florida has been back in school with no major outbreaks for almost 7 weeks
1312424107947053063 2020-10-04 00:07:45 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s great news
1312423504835497985 2020-10-04 00:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> He can’t answer if Trump has ever been on oxygen ever,  you goofs
1312395926330380295 2020-10-03 22:15:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU It’s very tame!! Lol
1312395819555971076 2020-10-03 22:15:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @pinktastic615 She clearly has no clue
1312395719614046208 2020-10-03 22:14:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @S2VA123 @SaintRPh Yes!!
1312364049582247939 2020-10-03 20:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Sen Graham has already said anyone who chooses may participate via video feed.  You can choose that option if you feel your health is in jeopardy.
1312363091636649984 2020-10-03 20:05:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Be ready to kiss a lot cracks me up
1312362983251685377 2020-10-03 20:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 I know!! As if anyone would use a wheelchair if they could walk! Particularly across grass
1312362667278041089 2020-10-03 20:03:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Truth
1312362554866499584 2020-10-03 20:03:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 I agree
1312360446599585793 2020-10-03 19:54:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @AliLaurelG Amen
1312360350122217472 2020-10-03 19:54:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Janemecom Right.  Why are the all so panicked if Biden truly has a 10 or 12 point national lead?
1312360160246071299 2020-10-03 19:53:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Because all of Twitter had muted your hysterical rantings
1312359422665072641 2020-10-03 19:50:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  He called that one right!!!
1312358698698842112 2020-10-03 19:47:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Should he have cartwheeled, had aides carry him on their shoulders? He was clearly capable of walking so why would he choose any other option?
1312358136838344709 2020-10-03 19:45:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Rick and Steve’s Excellent Grift
1312356955944620032 2020-10-03 19:40:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Making memes and tweeting sick burns isn’t Normandy, pal.
1312356543921295360 2020-10-03 19:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ImmersiveeKevin She something, that’s for sure
1312356451025932288 2020-10-03 19:38:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I literally cringed reading that
1312356269399977984 2020-10-03 19:38:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @slynhiggins Particularly when I know things they said and did before
1312356143495290880 2020-10-03 19:37:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Just don’t buy that these guys sit around at night devising plans to save America like modern day Paul Reveres or something.  It’s dolla dolla bills, baby.
1312355737771954178 2020-10-03 19:36:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Time will tell.  It’s in the favor for Trump to win again because then they can take in donations for 4 more years to “fight Trump”.  If Biden wins, I assume they’ll start taking money in to “rebuild the GOP”.  Either way, they don’t think Trump is Hitler.
1312355242344960003 2020-10-03 19:34:06 +0800 <just_mindy> None of the the founders of Lincoln Project think Trump is a fascist.  They don’t like him, sure. He operates outside of the political structure that enriched them for years. They want that back and Biden is that old structure.  Maybe they’ll get it.
1312354211586285568 2020-10-03 19:30:01 +0800 <just_mindy> they’re storming the beaches of Normandy now, apparently
1312353465205764097 2020-10-03 19:27:03 +0800 <just_mindy> 😂🙄
1312352573454725120 2020-10-03 19:23:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin Oh absolutely!! No contest
1312351389327208455 2020-10-03 19:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin That is slimy.  He’s trying to make people think he was a war hero
1312350163319615488 2020-10-03 19:13:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin Oh he looks the type
1312349291424481281 2020-10-03 19:10:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy Well yes, but he also is very bad at sexting
1312347504218906625 2020-10-03 19:03:21 +0800 <just_mindy> They are the driest sexters ever.
1312345044477673472 2020-10-03 18:53:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Says a person who has no problem writing that on the internet with zero fear of reprisal. If Trump was a fascist, this person would be scared of state police dragging him out of his home today &amp; arresting him.
1312245818410373120 2020-10-03 12:19:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Yes.  I thought they had seen that need but it doesn’t seem like they are intervening enough
1312244356183658497 2020-10-03 12:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas I mean, right?  What in the world!
1312223983350280195 2020-10-03 10:52:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @AGimpsey Clearly he doesn’t mind her looks so maybe she should work on not being a jerk
1312223177339265025 2020-10-03 10:49:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @HighCap12 Yes.  Big time BS
1312223007331540993 2020-10-03 10:48:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @PegLegPilot @SeanBannion Me too really

1312218598472126465 2020-10-03 10:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @treehuggingsis I know it!
1312218547117006850 2020-10-03 10:30:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Sounds like she drank a bottle of wine before coming out
1312218028080279552 2020-10-03 10:28:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @treehuggingsis My face exactly

1312217844839591936 2020-10-03 10:28:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria The one who causes all the trouble
1312215424738578432 2020-10-03 10:18:31 +0800 <just_mindy> He &amp; your Mom are in good company then
1312215209096802306 2020-10-03 10:17:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Claudia Conway says her mom (Kellyanne) has COVID  https://t.co/aN9EWyCCbL
1312214311201198080 2020-10-03 10:14:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dogez1 @WriteGrlProbs Ha!!!
1312213155708248065 2020-10-03 10:09:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I know it!
1312211513000648704 2020-10-03 10:02:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 She totally would 😂🤣🤣
1312211030651543552 2020-10-03 10:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I know!  I’m like he was still upright friend
1312210340839518210 2020-10-03 09:58:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 She needs a Xanax
1312210215689834498 2020-10-03 09:57:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @CalTexMix Yep!!!
1312209766022668289 2020-10-03 09:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought Jen would be salivating at the possibility of a President Pelosi
1312207976216711169 2020-10-03 09:48:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @strongpoint71 Yep!!

1312202172046561280 2020-10-03 09:25:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja @NerdKing52 I should probably do the same 🤣🤣
1312200932847882242 2020-10-03 09:20:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @sealeadams @NiedsG Yep!! Nothing but misery in his future
1312200852052955137 2020-10-03 09:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja @NerdKing52 Then it was a good thing. Trust me, being with someone who doesn’t love you is its own kind of lonely
1312200624222597120 2020-10-03 09:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @UncleBobsReason Yep!!!

1312194213300191232 2020-10-03 08:54:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Applejacks_71 Oh hell yes
1312194085780774913 2020-10-03 08:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Exactly!!  It’s so dependent on your desire to do that and what the resources are at that time

1312158487833526272 2020-10-03 06:32:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He just got off the helicopter and went down the steps well.  He saluted and waved

1312156883805892608 2020-10-03 06:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The President looked good walking up into the helicopter.  That’s good.
1312155264796119042 2020-10-03 06:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Fox reported POTUS walked out on his own and waved.  That is reassuring.
1312154175183048704 2020-10-03 06:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are legends in their own minds, I swear
1312153481306804224 2020-10-03 06:12:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Perhaps the Press Pool would have more access, and have a Doc answering their questions, if they hadn’t set themselves as dishonest purveyors of information this whole administration.  Just spitballing.
1312153021481013249 2020-10-03 06:10:33 +0800 <just_mindy> I wouldn’t drink out of the cup ever but otherwise Fl is fully open and they are outside.  They aren’t breaking any laws.

1312139302139170816 2020-10-03 05:16:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This concerns me but let’s remember Boris Johnson had to go to hospital as well and he emerged very healthy

1311961520671199233 2020-10-02 17:29:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember when you lied in a tweet.  That was like 4 hours ago.  It’s this tweet.

1311874754371112964 2020-10-02 11:44:49 +0800 <just_mindy> That seems racist.  I have many Black friends who are police.  Are they suppressing themselves? I know many whites who are criminals and are in jail.  Why didn’t your racist police protect them?
1311874315994968066 2020-10-02 11:43:05 +0800 <just_mindy> No more CRT training for Federal entities.  Insulin will be cheaper.  School Choice is important.  I have a right to gather and worship.

1311871476027490304 2020-10-02 11:31:47 +0800 <just_mindy> A staff member has a virus He’s renounced the Proud Boys about 20 times today  A former staffer had a mental health crisis.  (Is that funny now?) Her name is Melania   This is what y’all are paying yourselves millions to uncover?
1311869377474629633 2020-10-02 11:23:27 +0800 <just_mindy> I love when Progressives show their true colors.  Clearly, she speaks English or you wouldn’t know what she said in the recording.  Sorry you’re so bigoted that an accent bothers you.
1311869005163044865 2020-10-02 11:21:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Exactly.
1311868939778088966 2020-10-02 11:21:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @misterchambo And she works for public television so we all contribute to her well being.

1311867859279241218 2020-10-02 11:17:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump has 4 brilliant older children.  Melanie speaks many languages.
1311867436124299265 2020-10-02 11:15:44 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s not what she said but we are all used to Yamiche lying at this point.
1311867013787254789 2020-10-02 11:14:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler He should!!!
1311866944568668166 2020-10-02 11:13:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @SouthernKeeks Yes!! That’s exactly what I tell her
1311866839711051777 2020-10-02 11:13:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @JonathanTCasey @jaketapper Did you listen to audio or do you just play Christian reply guy on Twitter? She discusses trying to reconcile a family.  Her larger point was all this was going on during Obama admin ppl like you didn’t make a peep.
1311864870330138627 2020-10-02 11:05:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, most Christians know Christ wasn’t born on December 25.  That’s the day we observe his Birth.
1311864592780455942 2020-10-02 11:04:26 +0800 <just_mindy> I urge you to stop supporting the wholesale slaughter of babies and funding violence in the womb.  Trust and believe that is way more offensive to Christ
1311863978365251585 2020-10-02 11:02:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest @Boomieleaks Exactly the point she was making
1311863901814956034 2020-10-02 11:01:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb So over these people
1311863763792994304 2020-10-02 11:01:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @JonathanTCasey @jaketapper She literally says she was trying to reunite a family.  She wasn’t flippant.
1311862356893290496 2020-10-02 10:55:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Yes!!! I’ve told mine to stick with her friends from second grade who have earned her trust
1311862203516149761 2020-10-02 10:54:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @ValeriaPugliesi It’s going to be awful!

1311860845761179649 2020-10-02 10:49:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Yes. My daughter is the same.  She also has never met a stranger and is kind to everyone so most people like her.  All the boys like her.  It’s a recipe for jealous girls to target her.
1311859957428518917 2020-10-02 10:46:01 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughter is only 14 and has already had 2 massive betrayals by friends.  Also, private recordings they shared of her.  She’s already learning this at 14.  Teach your daughters to be better humans.
1311859458113445889 2020-10-02 10:44:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobsFunGirl Absolutely!!!
1311859373879164928 2020-10-02 10:43:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobsFunGirl Very pissed
1311859044035039232 2020-10-02 10:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> As I tell my daughter all the time, women are the worst to other women.  And when you’re pretty, it’s ten times worse.  And when you’re smart and pretty, it’s 50 times worse.  You might find 2 or 3 women you can really trust.  Other than your sisters and me.
1311858459386798085 2020-10-02 10:40:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets Oh yes
1311857908481753088 2020-10-02 10:37:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Michelle Obama said worse things about Americans and this country on mics to our face and the press nodded along.

1311856288620576769 2020-10-02 10:31:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Find me a lie in one of these quotes? You’re doing a great job @FLOTUS
1311855162424778755 2020-10-02 10:26:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha I’m holding you to it!
1311855075061530625 2020-10-02 10:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @THgo69 Yes.  Clearly she needs to know there are people who think she’s doing just great!
1311854684349620224 2020-10-02 10:25:04 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s not what she said.  She said Obama did the same thing and y’all didn’t make a peep.  And she’s right.
1311854355734200320 2020-10-02 10:23:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Another grifter sharing the quotes out of context.  At least they are outing themselves.

1311851792838340608 2020-10-02 10:13:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally her friend is a c u next Tuesday for betraying her like this.
1311851565121261569 2020-10-02 10:12:40 +0800 <just_mindy> She didn’t say “give me a effing break” about the plight of the kids.  Her point was OBAMA DID THE SAME THING &amp; press was fine with it.  Yet, she was being criticized personally for not changing the policy.  Also, she apparently did try to help &amp; it was ignored by press
1311851033522569216 2020-10-02 10:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> She isn’t complaining about Christmas or decorating.  She’s a frustrated wife and Mom trying her best and is constantly being criticized.  Any woman who listens will know it wasn’t about Christmas.
1311850741259214850 2020-10-02 10:09:24 +0800 <just_mindy> A pastor friend once told me “when you are sharing what a person said, you have a moral responsibility to share the context”.  Edward-Isaac here is misrepresenting the context.  Please listen to the entire recording.

1311847858530922499 2020-10-02 09:57:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @captnwentworth @chadfelixg Exactly!!! Her issue isn’t the Christmas!! All women know that!! That was the symptom that day.  Her issue was constantly trying her best and being mocked and made fun of in the press.
1311847349115850753 2020-10-02 09:55:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth Yep!!!! Exactly right!!
1311847258720284673 2020-10-02 09:55:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha 2021!!!
1311846635803234305 2020-10-02 09:53:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Probably same although different
1311846043068305409 2020-10-02 09:50:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I just read your timeline and as an American tax payer, I’m thrilled with the results of this EO.
1311845164911153152 2020-10-02 09:47:14 +0800 <just_mindy> She sounds like a woman frustrated that she is trying to do everything she can to fill a role but the Media only want to criticize her.  Since the media inserted their noses into the rectums of the Obamas, and still do, this would never have been released.

1311742548684275718 2020-10-02 02:59:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP Although my 4 kids get along better than most natural siblings and there are 2 moms and 2 dads 5 divorces between us all
1311742324003741696 2020-10-02 02:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP also all of that
1311741871501250560 2020-10-02 02:56:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP And my point is large families getting along and working side by side and having their marital or intimate partners do the same is pretty rare in my experience.
1311740756831481863 2020-10-02 02:52:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike I forgot, how are you such an amazing kisser?!
1311740541013569536 2020-10-02 02:51:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP No.  The things I listed above that are the modern day DNC.  This is an issue you and I won’t agree on and that’s ok

1311737332618457088 2020-10-02 02:38:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Will you make sure I’m on your Christmas Card mailing list?
1311737252855324674 2020-10-02 02:38:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Have you chosen fabric for the new Oval Office curtains?
1311737049662337025 2020-10-02 02:37:38 +0800 <just_mindy> How amazing is Dr Jill?
1311735743430234118 2020-10-02 02:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Me too.  Voting policy and ignoring the noise.  I can do that this time because Trump has an actual record now that reassures me
1311735043346386945 2020-10-02 02:29:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP I find that all way more reprehensible than anything Trump says.  Also, that abortion up and until a baby comes out of the birth canal is way more offensive to me.
1311734769063993346 2020-10-02 02:28:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP I have a different experience.  Most of my friends with large families and multiple siblings usually have one sibling or their partner who is on the outs. It’s not the GOP burning down cities, accosting people while they eat, not allowing people to worship or go to school.
1311732691029630977 2020-10-02 02:20:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly

1311712787278761984 2020-10-02 01:01:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @DPaulMatthew Oh of course!!
1311712627664596999 2020-10-02 01:00:35 +0800 <just_mindy> And if our gauge is: “wanted babies deserve life but unwanted babies can be murdered in the womb”, there is something deeply wrong in our society and we absolutely should have this conversation right now.
1311711131149520897 2020-10-02 00:54:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Go vote in person fam
1311710283816202243 2020-10-02 00:51:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @DPaulMatthew I just thought about it today and it is quite unusual
1311710157571846146 2020-10-02 00:50:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u I mean, it doesn’t even make sense!!!
1311710063510401024 2020-10-02 00:50:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 I know.  I’m blonde
1311709990374313985 2020-10-02 00:50:06 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW, Trump seems to get on well with all of his children’s intimate partners. Lara &amp; Kim work the campaign, Jared works w/ him, Tiffany’s boyfriend clearly likes him &amp; his Dad is an avid Trump defender. It’s very unusual to have that many kids &amp; all of them like Dad &amp; vice versa
1311709034928582657 2020-10-02 00:46:18 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean if he had demanded Ivanka not convert, or tolerated Jared for family harmony but still disliked him deep down, maybe I can see it, but none of this is accurate.
1311708746679279617 2020-10-02 00:45:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, the “Trump hates Jews” line is always a head scratcher for me.  He is obviously very fond of Jared, his SIL, &amp; gives him enormous decision making power.  His beloved daughter is also Jewish as she converted &amp; there is no indication he opposed this.
1311707658353868802 2020-10-02 00:40:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m very online obviously and I thought they were gay conservatives until a month ago

1311704719304404993 2020-10-02 00:29:10 +0800 <just_mindy> This from @LysaTerKeurst today was much needed.  If you’re healing, give it a read. 💕  https://t.co/iVAnkWnx0a
1311702865895985154 2020-10-02 00:21:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Happy Birthday!!!!  Now a rando on Twitter has!  https://t.co/Rm60MkPIU1
1311700439008714753 2020-10-02 00:12:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Yes.  I am a teacher but do not want to teach my own kid.  We don’t do well together with me as teacher lol
1311699200757895169 2020-10-02 00:07:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Got it.  Our kids have to stay masked so that probably has something to do with it too
1311697946153570306 2020-10-02 00:02:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrickDaddy116 @g8rlitig8r @PoliticalSock @rumpfshaker @Mediaite Also  https://t.co/kjjuOPhfls

1311697007917105154 2020-10-01 23:58:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrickDaddy116 @g8rlitig8r @PoliticalSock @rumpfshaker @Mediaite I was replying to his example of Spencer and Duke IF THEY TOOK UP ARMS.  Spencer hasn’t endorsed Trump so my point was “if they took up arms” THAT would be on Biden to denounce, not Trump. Trump has forcefully denounced the KKK as well.  Even declared them a hate group.
1311696168192299011 2020-10-01 23:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Yes! At our school, they did ask students who had been around the affected children for more than 15 minutes within 6 ft to stay home for 2 weeks.  That didn’t effect my child
1311695865870987266 2020-10-01 23:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I’m so glad kids are back in school in Florida
1311695768865124354 2020-10-01 23:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman 🤣🤣
1311679810196905985 2020-10-01 22:50:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Exactly!!! Ours were more toward the beginning too
1311679124927377408 2020-10-01 22:47:27 +0800 <just_mindy> We have been open in Florida for 6 weeks with no major outbreaks. Kids can choose to learn from home or go face to face.  My child is in a school of 2k and there have been 2 cases. It was announced to parents immediately.

1311664952164327425 2020-10-01 21:51:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @rumpfshaker @Mediaite Richard Spencer has endorsed Biden.  Biden needs to denounce him, not Trump
1311664706030108672 2020-10-01 21:50:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Patriot_Musket @RantyAmyCurtis At minimum, it’s Alabama, so who would have thought this was a rule?
1311664443701555200 2020-10-01 21:49:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @rivkaehh @_David_Edward First of all, crazy person, you do not know David and how he respects women so why would you say such a thing? Many men value the unborn &amp; adult women and David is one of them.  Finally, who elected you the purveyor of who will rot in hell?
1311662565383114752 2020-10-01 21:41:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @UncleHotep @wi1d1ifenature To me, it’s an invitation for people to consider why our instinct is to seek attention on social media at our darkest hour.

1311662160632836096 2020-10-01 21:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @wi1d1ifenature I mean you can start here:   https://t.co/7lhSwrZeNl  And oftentimes the something that has gone “horribly wrong” is DS and that is not an excuse to rob a child of personhood
1311661855853641728 2020-10-01 21:38:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @wi1d1ifenature Wow.  That’s a very substantial retort full of information I will ponder

1311656774253019137 2020-10-01 21:18:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida, the third most populous state in our nation, has had schools open now for 6 weeks with no major outbreaks.  There is no excuse for schools being closed anywhere

1311653976497160193 2020-10-01 21:07:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @BrewCrewGold As we always say, we are UCF and UF fans, and fans of anyone playing Alabama
1311653218930372609 2020-10-01 21:04:31 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s the University of Alabama.  What can you say?
1311647260401438721 2020-10-01 20:40:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep.  Addiction isn’t easy to beat.  It’s also not an excuse to abuse people
1311640643295477763 2020-10-01 20:14:33 +0800 <just_mindy> And trust when I say, no one understands an addict like me so I say this as disrespectfully as possible
1311638288311226369 2020-10-01 20:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @OneFineJay I’m assuming with phone polls, people might be reluctant to say they are voting Trump if they felt it would upset their partner

1311435895850127367 2020-10-01 06:40:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb These are supposed to be female leaders and all they can come up with is “let’s get naked” tf?
1311435627221614596 2020-10-01 06:39:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax And they wonder why young girls feel the need show more and more on social media.  It astounds me

1311434933328654337 2020-10-01 06:37:08 +0800 <just_mindy> There are no haters.  No one is jealous of these women. We are pointing out the hypocrisy in telling young women their worth doesn’t lie in their ability to attract attention with their bodies and now these “leaders” are doing just that.
1311434364027392001 2020-10-01 06:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Women need to get naked for voter turnout and journalists think this is an amazing strategy
1311434127116242949 2020-10-01 06:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Women are tired of being objectified and women don’t have to take off their clothes to be successful and women should be lauded for their brains and accomplishments.  Got it.
1311430785111658499 2020-10-01 06:20:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And that was only because of who his dad was.  And everyone knows that

1311392470299795457 2020-10-01 03:48:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Honestly, with the way the Media defames and disparages the character of anyone who works for Trump, and does anything possible to make them appear as scourges of society and rob them of social capital, it doesn’t surprise me people struggle after working for him.
1311391432104726528 2020-10-01 03:44:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh That gif has needed to be used

1311384511826063361 2020-10-01 03:16:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 I guess
1311379414735818753 2020-10-01 02:56:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden shouldn’t have addressed the military that way then.
1311374250478055425 2020-10-01 02:36:00 +0800 <just_mindy> And of course she is tweeting about her....custody case.  Good to know in the crazy year of our Lord 2020, she’s still tweeting about her custody case.  As she did in 2019 and 2018 and 2017......
1311373792015417344 2020-10-01 02:34:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Jason Miller was trending so I thought AJ must be telling more about their custody case.
1311356099417776129 2020-10-01 01:23:52 +0800 <just_mindy> So, if I walk up to a random man and start accusing him of rape, and he feels “threatened” because I called him a racist, he’s a hit dog? Interesting.

1311324401800032256 2020-09-30 23:17:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Just kidding:  I used to say “shake a bootay” to him when he would dance around and one day he was playing with Guadalupe and they were dancing and he said it to her &amp; it was catchy and we all threw our heads back and laughed and it stuck and she loved it and him.
1311323914535084034 2020-09-30 23:15:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes, I raised a baby misogynist.  Shut up

1311145266658062337 2020-09-30 11:26:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump won the Republican primary in 2016 because no one could match his cult of personality.  They all withered.  I saw the same thing tonight.  Biden was fine but he look withered next to Trump.  Trump owned the stage for good or bad.

1311123645016813568 2020-09-30 10:00:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Officers and Chiefs and LEO have no desire to meet with Biden.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates2020

1311119191903285248 2020-09-30 09:42:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida schools are reopen and there have been zero major outbreaks.  They have been reopen for 6 weeks.  Schools need to reopen.  #Debates2020

1311103892692836354 2020-09-30 08:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I really do.
1311103795770859520 2020-09-30 08:41:18 +0800 <just_mindy> The point is most people aren’t drinking alcohol that expensive either.  I can afford if.  I can afford the ice cream. So can you.  That’s because we are both white collar workers unaffected by COVID.

1310993072533184513 2020-09-30 01:21:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @CreativDisparit @BillyHallowell It’s not “separating church and state” when elected leaders allow people to fly/ go into casinos yet don’t allow Christians to worship in person.  It’s further not separation when govt compels religious orders to provide Birth control, for example, against religious beliefs
1310992342787207168 2020-09-30 01:18:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo
1310982053912076289 2020-09-30 00:37:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC And she is basically right
1310981979186302976 2020-09-30 00:37:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjrsmith5 Exactly
1310981853474684931 2020-09-30 00:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @andrewnpike1 It’s like they feel they will win no matter what they do.  Hmmmmm
1310981472317255683 2020-09-30 00:35:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @IncHeathen @Neoavatara They should have
1310981044829597702 2020-09-30 00:33:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Very bad actually
1310980995403993093 2020-09-30 00:33:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Exactly
1310979521152266243 2020-09-30 00:27:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja We have a viewing party planned.  I’m excited
1310979357012365315 2020-09-30 00:26:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Patriot_Musket @MollyRatty @JulieDiCaro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1310979287089139714 2020-09-30 00:26:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja TP for my bunghole
1310978926043373568 2020-09-30 00:25:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty @Patriot_Musket @JulieDiCaro But she’s writing a book, Mo.
1310978815091519489 2020-09-30 00:24:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The approval of a MAGA man is so voluminous &amp; massive &amp; overwhelming &amp; filling I can only handle it from one MAGA man.  How does Mo handle the approval of multiple MAGA men? Reason 2,678 that Mo is my hero!
1310977922631692288 2020-09-30 00:21:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja That would be awesome
1310976121949818880 2020-09-30 00:13:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem If he has one maybe
1310975066642026496 2020-09-30 00:09:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!
1310974880310067200 2020-09-30 00:09:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1310974797170565127 2020-09-30 00:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean cocaine would give someone tons of energy but no, we shouldn’t want them to take it
1310974578789933065 2020-09-30 00:07:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude @Jringo1508 @JulieDiCaro @MollyRatty And many of the false accusations today continue to be against Black men
1310974439388073986 2020-09-30 00:07:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Why would there be any problem inspecting an ear piece unless you’re doing something nefarious?
1310973564300951553 2020-09-30 00:03:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Women absolutely did and do make false claims.  See Duke Lacrosse.  See Rolling Stone debacle.
1310971828559654913 2020-09-29 23:56:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @doublee64 @PatriotBeez @JustEric I need all the help I can get

1310966579081998338 2020-09-29 23:36:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez @JustEric Let me clarify. I’m not eating beaver.
1310966462539083778 2020-09-29 23:35:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez @JustEric I mean, by the end, I’m basically catatonic so eating beaver always works for me

1310934540366606337 2020-09-29 21:28:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @DeebsFLA @_David_Edward LITRALLY me at Panera yesterday
1310934385559064576 2020-09-29 21:28:08 +0800 <just_mindy> As if I needed to find another reason to crawl over broken glass to vote for Trump, this is exhibit 9,543,213 of good things he has done.
1310934056117436417 2020-09-29 21:26:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I feel like our government probably also has bomb ass lawyers who will “defiantly” defend that clause

1310742264625405952 2020-09-29 08:44:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @MornevanderBerg Oh stunning!
1310741031663669248 2020-09-29 08:39:48 +0800 <just_mindy> According to the Catholic faith,  Biden is not permitted to publicly advocate for abortion.  That’s the tenets of his church.  Abortion is against the Bible and in direct opposition to God as well

1310440523551956992 2020-09-28 12:45:42 +0800 <just_mindy> A reminder while the Lincoln Project fellows drone on and on about tax debt and Russia ties, many of them have exactly what they deride Trump for themselves.  Methinks the ladies doth tweet too much.   https://t.co/vKaEgCEv5b

1310375867386920962 2020-09-28 08:28:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix Tax evasion I guess? Who knows?!
1310375777381343237 2020-09-28 08:28:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, college educated white women are apparently very dumb.  I mean, I am one, but I’m not one of the dumb ones.
1310375478365237251 2020-09-28 08:27:14 +0800 <just_mindy> If Trump wins, I hope y’all know we owe it the Hoteps educating people the last 4 years.
1310375164333494272 2020-09-28 08:25:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @jeremyvyoral Probably but nah the abortion thing
1310374117280014336 2020-09-28 08:21:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Perfect
1310373813805363207 2020-09-28 08:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all aren’t going to like this, but I totally agree.  Men should confront men and it’s generally really inappropriate for men to confront women unless it’s a professional setting.  Too many men are afraid of other men so they target women.
1310372894661373953 2020-09-28 08:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Right? It will be an unmitigated waste of time but Trump lives for this stuff
1310372444314783744 2020-09-28 08:15:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 They are very convinced Trump is scared to debate Biden.  I don’t think Trump is a great debater, but he won’t ever be upstaged
1310372155360710661 2020-09-28 08:14:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy He was literally denied Communion because of his support for abortion.  I doubt very seriously Trump is a Christian, but he’s actually doing things to prevent infanticide    https://t.co/RiHAE835gc

1310370723219812359 2020-09-28 08:08:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Why do they keep doing this?  If all Dems are doing it, the GOP should pass on the meetings and let’s go to a vote

1310369412285960194 2020-09-28 08:03:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank you!! We are hopeful!
1310369311010234371 2020-09-28 08:02:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 You’re exactly right
1310369146853634048 2020-09-28 08:02:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly. CINO
1310367917117255680 2020-09-28 07:57:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 She is an actual adherent to the religion though. That’s the difference
1310367307030573056 2020-09-28 07:54:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Exactly!!
1310367232921305089 2020-09-28 07:54:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I will do that!! Thank you!!
1310367115816382464 2020-09-28 07:54:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Oh they would be a force together!!!  That’s so funny!!!
1310366976745836544 2020-09-28 07:53:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @tashatl @OrwellOf @thehill He just doesn’t get to take Communion  https://t.co/Dje02EJi03
1310366754846240768 2020-09-28 07:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Do they let him take Communion there?
1310364512210608133 2020-09-28 07:43:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @leepd84 Ha!!!
1310364464114552833 2020-09-28 07:43:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  He is retired from the National Guard after 20 years.  We are grateful he has Tricare with Medicare.  It helps get the best treatments.  We fish in Boca Grande which is by Port Charlotte several times a year.  Immokalee is about 3 hours from us
1310358608572485632 2020-09-28 07:20:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He is doing well overall.  He has his 3rd treatment on Wednesday and he has to have a total of 8.  Everyone else is good! Thank you for asking!
1310351372437651456 2020-09-28 06:51:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @ChipChairman @melifix Exactly
1310350640745525249 2020-09-28 06:48:32 +0800 <just_mindy> A gentle reminder now that Blake Bortles is back in the NFL, there will be zero slander of him on this timeline.  He is revered to #UCF fans and it shall always be.  #BuiltByUCF
1310350132664315905 2020-09-28 06:46:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Exactly.  Instead he lived off taxpayers his whole life
1310348964584136705 2020-09-28 06:41:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Very true.  Even when he was at his best and he certainly isn’t now.
1310348804617654272 2020-09-28 06:41:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes he did!!  We love you Blake!!
1310348503093325824 2020-09-28 06:40:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Yes!!!  I love watching those hearings
1310348401255624706 2020-09-28 06:39:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Exactly.  Certainly not intellectuals, but to pretend they aren’t in the same league as Biden is laughable.
1310348106043621379 2020-09-28 06:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> #BuiltByUCF
1310347524478251010 2020-09-28 06:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I mean, let’s please not pretend Christie &amp; Giuliani can’t match Biden.  That’s nonsense
1310346767549030400 2020-09-28 06:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Have you heard Biden lately?
1310346564922204162 2020-09-28 06:32:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Did they make up numbers and stutter and nap a lot?
1310345661859147781 2020-09-28 06:28:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom @robbystarbuck Right?
1310344682845679616 2020-09-28 06:24:52 +0800 <just_mindy> This was my FB status update from 10 years ago.  My daughter was 4.  She’s now 14 and still probably threatens me under her breath.  https://t.co/OV180Hpvcs

1310337303206821888 2020-09-28 05:55:32 +0800 <just_mindy> She is disgusting
1310335736911196160 2020-09-28 05:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> #TrumpTaxReturns  this will be the thing that sinks him.  I just know it guys.  🤪
1310332534564290560 2020-09-28 05:36:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @_CrotalusAtrox_ I get pissed at mine all the time.

1310320543694979078 2020-09-28 04:48:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 My dad added it bounces because it is made of aluminum
1310317602846240771 2020-09-28 04:37:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh my word
1310317334779830272 2020-09-28 04:36:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear @lesUCF Ha!! The diamond is a fair trade off though

1310309450801086465 2020-09-28 04:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Which are making people sicker
1310308694798761989 2020-09-28 04:01:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s right!! Lol
1310308122691502081 2020-09-28 03:59:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Is it because she’s a woman? It is.  This is blatant misogyny.
1310306791453007873 2020-09-28 03:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear @lesUCF There’s a tiny window.  Just go to the courthouse

1310305313124478976 2020-09-28 03:48:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly!!! Particularly your sister
1310305079518523392 2020-09-28 03:47:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 When it gets loud and fans jump, our stadium actually bounces.  Lol.   That’s why they have to have major camera stabilizers for TV
1310304841630089227 2020-09-28 03:46:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all know if UCF and UF meet at any size stadium in the state of Fl, it will sell out and be litty.   UCF has already proved we are a traveling fan base.  @RonDeSantisFL needs to make that happen more than FSU/UF which will be boring af and we all know it
1310303267172356098 2020-09-28 03:40:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It will be interesting
1310303206061363200 2020-09-28 03:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Probably
1310303168287432710 2020-09-28 03:39:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 My booty is always warm after driving.  First thing I turn on in the car
1310302996564189192 2020-09-28 03:39:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @JordyOnTheRadio Because they want the Swamp.  It’s disrespecting our Stadium.
1310301862013423625 2020-09-28 03:34:42 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/LO9OnIq5QG
1310299804849901568 2020-09-28 03:26:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton Ok but FSU is zero competition for them right now.  We are actually closer to UF than FSU and can offer an actual competitive game
1310298629815533571 2020-09-28 03:21:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We win bowl games and that still won’t shut them up
1310298158631714816 2020-09-28 03:19:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you
1310297826694492166 2020-09-28 03:18:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Would the Gators play in Gainesville outside the swamp? We don’t play at Camping World anymore.  We have the Bounce House.  Just like the Swamp is sacred to UF fans, UCF fans love the Bounce House on our campus.
1310296795558359040 2020-09-28 03:14:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Since I graduated in 1997
1310295954881490945 2020-09-28 03:11:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I live in Florida and use my booty warmer every day.  It’s like a constant heating pad
1310292603447971840 2020-09-28 02:57:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @6vaughts Im just saying
1310292455355449353 2020-09-28 02:57:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Absolutely.  There is no comparison.  I bought a 2 year old Mercedes SUV 2 years ago and I haven’t regretted one minute
1310291653899546630 2020-09-28 02:54:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t care about purses but I will say, after owning a luxury car, that matters to me and I’ll pay more
1310288855107502081 2020-09-28 02:43:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Truth.  Also being raised around alligators privilege
1310288529289809921 2020-09-28 02:41:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU There is nothing better!
1310288452831805441 2020-09-28 02:41:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, cry that THREE Florida teams are in the top 15.  We know the real football state is in the deep Deep South
1310288118969442304 2020-09-28 02:40:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Now y’all go cry about UCF being 11 and “they never play anyone” and “they need to join a conference”.  Go cry it out.  The tears sustain us while we always win.
1310277674296803329 2020-09-28 01:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Until we get some more Twitter couple drama, Tik Tok is my fix
1310277320536715265 2020-09-28 01:57:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @thejuliedaniel It’s the freaking best
1310277228119429121 2020-09-28 01:56:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 People are going to learn
1310276551125143552 2020-09-28 01:54:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 It really is
1310275147174117379 2020-09-28 01:48:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Moral of the story: don’t tell tales in the lady’s bathroom yall.
1310275032485109760 2020-09-28 01:48:06 +0800 <just_mindy> So now the sister knows her fiancé/baby daddy is SLEEPING WITH HER SISTER BECAUSE HER SISTER RAN HER MOUTH IN A BAR AND 2 QUEENS DECIDED TO PROTECT HER &amp; TELL HER.
1310274564350410757 2020-09-28 01:46:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all Tik Tok is so messy.  These 2 girls were in a bar last night in Bend, Oregon and they overheard these other 2 girls talking in the bathroom.  One said she was sleeping with her sister’s fiancé. So the other 2 girls made a Tik Tok to find the sister and THEY FOUND HER
1310274083226103808 2020-09-28 01:44:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno I prefer that too but they won’t
1310274016821817344 2020-09-28 01:44:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge Exactly and until week 40

1310270280477089793 2020-09-28 01:29:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno I can’t stand her
1310269531907125250 2020-09-28 01:26:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @tolin43959 We really dodged a bullet
1310269355091988482 2020-09-28 01:25:32 +0800 <just_mindy> And that 60% number includes people who think it should only be legal in case of rape, health of mother and incest
1310269121146351618 2020-09-28 01:24:36 +0800 <just_mindy> They’re being intentionally misleading.  Polls tell us only about 16% of people support abortion up until birth as Democrats demand

1310234530196983811 2020-09-27 23:07:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 And they’re dumb.  I mean, this is a capitalist country.  His job is to protect businesses.  That’s their main complaint?
1310234330715783171 2020-09-27 23:06:22 +0800 <just_mindy> This Supreme Court Battle will do wonders for Lindsay.  He won hearts and minds during Kav.  He’ll protect ACB the same way.  This is great timing for him.
1310232259396501510 2020-09-27 22:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s so damn depressing to me that you still can’t come up with a compelling counter argument to Trump than Xenophobia, capitalism and white supremacy.   It’s boring at this point.

1310071747803312128 2020-09-27 12:20:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix They don’t see a problem with other races adopting white children because of “power structures”.  Other races don’t try to invoke superiority on children.  Only whites do this.
1310071228955348998 2020-09-27 12:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @J4LYN Exactly!!!!
1310070486139895814 2020-09-27 12:15:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @J4LYN This will be my son’s THIRD antibiotic and he is never sick
1310070366317039616 2020-09-27 12:14:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Ahhhhh.  You flatter me
1310070287787069441 2020-09-27 12:14:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Oh gosh!!  And I know the opportunity to see your brother is precious and you have to take it when you get it.  This is one of those times you have to put bro first!
1310069924241575936 2020-09-27 12:13:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 @Micky_Finn Me too!  I’m so sad to have upset him
1310066762738790411 2020-09-27 12:00:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 @Micky_Finn Winnie is just very offended by me
1310065491822731266 2020-09-27 11:55:27 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m a Russian hacker apparently.  That sounds way more exciting than my real life.  Can I be Pussy Galore?
1310065085172404224 2020-09-27 11:53:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Micky_Finn Yes.  I’m really dumb.  I have a hard time formulating ideas.  I am also blonde and a conservative so it’s stunning I can even read.  Paw let me go to high school and even let me get one of them there graduate degrees.
1310063411791892480 2020-09-27 11:47:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick I’m going to check it out! My son would definitely love it!
1310063256464175104 2020-09-27 11:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Micky_Finn You’re certainly entitled to your opinion
1310062600022089729 2020-09-27 11:43:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Me either!
1310062474167750656 2020-09-27 11:43:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick I didn’t see that but def see the analogy.  Yes, it’s her responsibility to keep her husband from this
1310062302557863938 2020-09-27 11:42:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick Yes.  He should be allowed to enjoy his family at this stage in life
1310062175550156802 2020-09-27 11:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Yep. I have no qualms voting for him this year
1310061246306291716 2020-09-27 11:38:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria I voted Johnson.  I would never vote Hilary
1310061145001259010 2020-09-27 11:38:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick A bevy of medical issues.  For my dad, it was cancer of his blood making him weak and lowering oxygen levels.  It made it hard for him to concentrate and he started doing that
1310060433034940417 2020-09-27 11:35:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RantyAmyCurtis You would.  Me too when that person comes along. It makes me so giddy you’ve found yours. 😍
1310059740135858176 2020-09-27 11:32:36 +0800 <just_mindy> 🥰🥰😘😘😘😘
1310057399299047424 2020-09-27 11:23:18 +0800 <just_mindy> This is correct.  Biden also claimed the truck driver may have been drunk.  He was not.  This ruined that man’s life.  His daughter fought to clear his name.     https://t.co/1EuTZz0LDn
1310055996530798593 2020-09-27 11:17:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @BoyensJC @BiasedGirl Me too!! Never more happy to be wrong
1310055920819490816 2020-09-27 11:17:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 This result, particularly made him worth it
1310055769883189251 2020-09-27 11:16:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @J4LYN I have to believe this has something to do with my son being so sick lately
1310055631559241728 2020-09-27 11:16:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy A heavy right bench ostensibly will stand up for liberty.  They won’t allow encroachment into religious beliefs, won’t compel taxes, won’t force businesses to do things against the owners belief systems.  Basically they don’t see the Constitution as “living and breathing”
1310054950194606080 2020-09-27 11:13:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 Yep
1310054922080133120 2020-09-27 11:13:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @jules_delgato @BiasedGirl I’m willing to admit I was wrong
1310054858268061696 2020-09-27 11:13:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @robboney @ChrisDJackson That’s kind of you
1310051776809390082 2020-09-27 11:00:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Can you imagine if Hilary would have chosen these 3 SC spots?  The court would be used by progressives to jolt us far left.  What a nightmare
1310051068202627074 2020-09-27 10:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I was a NT in 2016 who never thought Trump would keep his word on SC picks.  He has and he deserves credit for that and all of us who said he wouldn’t, should say our mea culpas. This is mine.  3 SC spots opening make me so thankful others had more foresight than me.
1310048409928294400 2020-09-27 10:47:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 @lyndseyfifield Yep!

1310047290426613760 2020-09-27 10:43:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Wow! I didn’t realize that.
1310047093118173189 2020-09-27 10:42:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Nor do we want ACB to be RBG. If DJT had nominated someone like RBG instead of ACB, someone with the beliefs of AOC for example, the GOP would have been MAD
1310046364454322177 2020-09-27 10:39:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I’ll listen to some Boozie Badass for penance

1310046194975023104 2020-09-27 10:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist He did the thing today
1310046072132296706 2020-09-27 10:38:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield Exactly what I was going to say.  I intentionally watched all video and looked at all pics to see if I could find an unguarded moment.  There isn’t.  That’s their natural demeanor
1310045505012084736 2020-09-27 10:36:02 +0800 <just_mindy> LSU lost? Wow.
1310045060319326208 2020-09-27 10:34:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve spent the last 23 years teaching teens and ACB’s older kids look very happy and self assured.  That’s rare.  I think they are just fine.

1310001801597538304 2020-09-27 07:42:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Yes!!!!!  🥰🥰🥰🥰
1310001533673709570 2020-09-27 07:41:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I mean it!! When Mr. B is well and strong, come!!
1310001144966656006 2020-09-27 07:39:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl It was!! And the sun and marg was a highlight!! Come visit and we’ll hang on the lake and go to Food and Wine at Epcot.
1310000896017825792 2020-09-27 07:38:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Absolutely do!! Life has taught me that lately
1310000772902522883 2020-09-27 07:38:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron “She died cute”. Put it on my headstone
1310000548704333824 2020-09-27 07:37:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Pleassssseeeeee!!!!
1310000475559858176 2020-09-27 07:37:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I live in Fl, B.  I’ve laid out with Crisco &amp; Baby oil since I was like 12.  That ship has sailed
1310000250027999233 2020-09-27 07:36:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @ImmersiveeKevin But he believes in the religion of abortion so he’s fine
1309999786158944257 2020-09-27 07:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> My Knights won.  My Gators won.  ACB was nominated.  I laid in the sun and had a marg &amp; now I’m watching the instate rivalry between FSU vs UM. This day could be perfect if Missouri wins.  Make it so, Lord. 🙏🏼
1309998289840939009 2020-09-27 07:28:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @DaGhostOfRichie and because her Dad was a man and men don’t face the same questions in that regard
1309997814961909760 2020-09-27 07:26:32 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the deleted tweet  https://t.co/5mPLEYc21h
1309996668029464576 2020-09-27 07:21:58 +0800 <just_mindy> There you go
1309971178325520387 2020-09-27 05:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m vital to my kids.  Even when I wasn’t a single parent, they would tell you I was more involved in their lives than their friends with SAHM often.  Working doesn’t mean you don’t rear your kids.  Also, my kids never spent a minute in day care.  We got creative
1309970391486660609 2020-09-27 05:37:34 +0800 <just_mindy> They are teaching it.  School districts are paying this man a lot of money to do Zoom meetings with their teachers to teach them this stuff
1309969530572206081 2020-09-27 05:34:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @mskevinjennings Exactly
1309966358931804160 2020-09-27 05:21:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba She is
1309963757569937408 2020-09-27 05:11:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 It’s always someone else’s fault
1309963666960330753 2020-09-27 05:10:50 +0800 <just_mindy> The best rapper alive today is Saweetie anyway.
1309961868094644224 2020-09-27 05:03:41 +0800 <just_mindy> You should cry more about a funny tweet
1309961684166103040 2020-09-27 05:02:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @trumwill  https://t.co/lfSCFw3BKk
1309961526263123970 2020-09-27 05:02:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig 🤣🤣
1309961498702360578 2020-09-27 05:02:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is the tweet she deleted.  Remember when people told me last night and this morning this line of attack wouldn’t be thing. 😂😂  https://t.co/CioXFkabDc
1309960571404660736 2020-09-27 04:58:32 +0800 <just_mindy> No, the point you were attempting to make show our degraded discourse
1309960027403423750 2020-09-27 04:56:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig His spirit might live on in me
1309959929109807105 2020-09-27 04:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno Fitting 🤣🤣🤣
1309959856661696513 2020-09-27 04:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie Oh yes!! Of course, they do
1309959793084301312 2020-09-27 04:55:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara He’s alive and hiding with JFK jr prob
1309959628554371074 2020-09-27 04:54:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig My mom’s name is Priscilla and I was born on the day he died, so I have no comment
1309959335439675392 2020-09-27 04:53:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I mean, unless Kamala knows something we don’t!
1309958884489146371 2020-09-27 04:51:50 +0800 <just_mindy> He is not, however, alive
1309954008572932097 2020-09-27 04:32:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @fi_virginia Right?  Be a man, bro!
1309943730418470913 2020-09-27 03:51:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @SouthernKeeks @LegallyAutumn @MollyRatty It can’t be Kamala because she has no kids. This isn’t Klobuchar’s lane, so it has to be Hirono
1309943092477386752 2020-09-27 03:49:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  And that’s why any time any of these people start the adoption attack, or the mothering attack, or the religious attack, their mentions need to be swarmed with ppl telling them it’s not ok.  There needs to be zero tolerance for that nonsense.
1309942653971300355 2020-09-27 03:47:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thanks!!! It’s beautiful today
1309942607200636928 2020-09-27 03:47:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba To torture us
1309941072055894018 2020-09-27 03:41:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Such haters!!! lol My Florida games are basically over until tonight so I’m going to go lay out and get Orange
1309940755897765890 2020-09-27 03:39:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I never mind liberal tears
1309940098558046209 2020-09-27 03:37:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Stop it!! I love Trevor Lawrence and his cute little fiancé. They are so precious
1309939219536650240 2020-09-27 03:33:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v Fair point
1309939165874786304 2020-09-27 03:33:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 As if RBG owned that seat.  They’re so silly
1309939028964372483 2020-09-27 03:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes it will be interesting to see if they can challenge Clemson with Lawrence still there.  I will watch because having football right now is so glorious but I will still hate them
1309937017959088128 2020-09-27 03:24:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists @thefactualprep If you also believe in abortion
1309936587430600704 2020-09-27 03:23:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Ha!!  I’m sure Bama will be good as usual.  They are just insufferable.  Lol
1309936026962587648 2020-09-27 03:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy And they don’t even recognize it
1309935958297653251 2020-09-27 03:20:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark #MeToo
1309935905348694019 2020-09-27 03:20:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 I can imagine!!! I told you Florida is nice
1309935773588893696 2020-09-27 03:20:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists @thefactualprep Also huge hypocrites
1309935161757315085 2020-09-27 03:17:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ @conservmillen It is
1309935056413241344 2020-09-27 03:17:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 They wasted their money on that guy
1309934892747288578 2020-09-27 03:16:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 The FSU UM game will just be fun because of in state rivalry.  My ex was a Bama fan. It’s too much Bama
1309933473805860867 2020-09-27 03:10:52 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying last night. This person was just paid 20k by the Fairfax school system to educate teachers for 1 hour on Zoom.
1309932940827201536 2020-09-27 03:08:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 You’re a Bama fan too?  Dear God.
1309932868307542017 2020-09-27 03:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes!!! Good day for both of my teams!
1309932751789928454 2020-09-27 03:08:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @KSLawWolf @FletchMatlock 😂😂😂
1309932624039866368 2020-09-27 03:07:29 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/5Oa3gfEna9
1309930463390302211 2020-09-27 02:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Oh my word.  The first part made me so mad I didn’t even comprehend the second.  Holy yikes
1309930259987550208 2020-09-27 02:58:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x You know that’s right!!! They’d be celebrating how she can balance it all!
1309930014889177109 2020-09-27 02:57:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you for your honesty.
1309929499757359104 2020-09-27 02:55:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 HER CHILDCARE, D?!
1309929349639004160 2020-09-27 02:54:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Yes.  They truly believe she needs to explain her child care arrangements before the Senate.  I don’t even know what to say
1309928758841880578 2020-09-27 02:52:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Clearly they believe women can’t have children and careers
1309928524485201921 2020-09-27 02:51:12 +0800 <just_mindy> As you have displayed today
1309928370080296962 2020-09-27 02:50:35 +0800 <just_mindy> And your book must be about you because you are the problem with everything
1309928204388491266 2020-09-27 02:49:55 +0800 <just_mindy> This whole exchange is disgusting and you should both be ashamed
1309927228801777665 2020-09-27 02:46:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Very true
1309927119175245824 2020-09-27 02:45:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark That would be glorious
1309923352501538821 2020-09-27 02:30:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Ha!
1309923302849351680 2020-09-27 02:30:27 +0800 <just_mindy> My Knights finally got it together
1309923011450081280 2020-09-27 02:29:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig Yes!! I have one who is a Bernie fan but she is coming around.  The rest are conservative or libertarian.
1309922848912404481 2020-09-27 02:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @6vaughts I think many people are having bigger families these days.  I love it
1309922684546019332 2020-09-27 02:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Calcrash Exactly right
1309922645257977864 2020-09-27 02:27:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Me too.  I wasn’t a fan of being an only child
1309922564488212480 2020-09-27 02:27:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Yep.  It’s going to be a long road
1309922473727668224 2020-09-27 02:27:09 +0800 <just_mindy> So attacking her ability to parent didn’t work so now we’ll attack her looks.  Now, y’all see why Dolly Parton said don’t call her a feminist.  Feminists are the worst.
1309922019161636864 2020-09-27 02:25:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig I totally get that!!!
1309921913700048898 2020-09-27 02:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark I mean, seems sexist
1309921725166088194 2020-09-27 02:24:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig And you manage to love them?! How do you do that?! 😂
1309921613266198531 2020-09-27 02:23:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Antonin Scalia had 5 children.  Did you have concerns about his ability to do his job or do you just have a “number of kids” test for women?
1309920942794121222 2020-09-27 02:21:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig On my Mom’s side of the family, me having four was slacking.  My cousins all have between 7-9 kids
1309920687662956545 2020-09-27 02:20:03 +0800 <just_mindy> For the record I reared 4 children while working &amp; getting certification and degrees, and it was hard, but my children were loved and well attended
1309920131108175872 2020-09-27 02:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> If this was a man with 7 kids, these types of tweets would not happen.  Notice that.   Her husband cares for the kids.  Feminists celebrated this, I thought? Guess not so much when it is a successful conservative woman.
1309919011547811840 2020-09-27 02:13:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @LisaTurnage12 They can’t manage saying anything about her without snark
1309917508435144704 2020-09-27 02:07:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep  https://t.co/vrBHM74weT
1309917302868111360 2020-09-27 02:06:36 +0800 <just_mindy> “Large family”? Why can’t it just be a family?
1309916593019908097 2020-09-27 02:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Stone! Go Kyle!
1309915709389053952 2020-09-27 02:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheKimboBryce You can’t play teams that won’t schedule you
1309914665825206272 2020-09-27 01:56:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Do the Eagles always win too?

1309910119828926465 2020-09-27 01:38:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Oh I hate that!!!  Thankfully people are generally helpful and I make my son help always!

1309905190817013760 2020-09-27 01:18:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Gata!
1309903997516623872 2020-09-27 01:13:44 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said last night
1309902878123929601 2020-09-27 01:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 Yes! Should be way more of a focus!

1309878774654283776 2020-09-26 23:33:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @xavierdreyman When Mac gets to Fl, I guess he’s taking the TV out
1309878420663304192 2020-09-26 23:32:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman I have one but we have people coming over
1309877971184947200 2020-09-26 23:30:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I need to get out of my bed for our noon football watching but my bed is so dang luxurious.  As is my heating pad.
1309877708579631106 2020-09-26 23:29:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow That’s the truth
1309875051043397632 2020-09-26 23:18:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @ScarilyCheerful @PeculiarBaptist Yes! Me too!!
1309874858273234945 2020-09-26 23:17:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 Of course
1309874356542205952 2020-09-26 23:15:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 Right!
1309874263709671424 2020-09-26 23:15:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @ScarilyCheerful @Flipper628 @IncHeathen @PeculiarBaptist Yes
1309859795348992000 2020-09-26 22:18:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @RWNutjob1 This is so stressful!!!
1309859393719197696 2020-09-26 22:16:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear His Dad is my friend since we were 14! His dad played at UCF and then a little pro ball.  And yes, he’s a giant!
1309859194057654273 2020-09-26 22:15:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 They just have him Clindamycin for 2 weeks.  His poor tummy
1309859053800226816 2020-09-26 22:15:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @RWNutjob1 My mind cannot do this!!
1309857630609911808 2020-09-26 22:09:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait? UCF &amp; UF are both at noon? What the heck is that?
1309856811638575110 2020-09-26 22:06:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Right?!
1309856657518755840 2020-09-26 22:05:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Let’s go Stone!!
1309856180173443072 2020-09-26 22:03:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @RantyAmyCurtis @DRussell76 Oh yes
1309855905857626113 2020-09-26 22:02:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Yep.  It’s all awful
1309855832918589441 2020-09-26 22:02:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g He has a N-95 because he’s a firefighter but I’m not sure cleaning protocol.  I will have to ask
1309855635241082880 2020-09-26 22:01:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno It makes me so sad
1309855510355734528 2020-09-26 22:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx Yes.  I am feeling all those terrible feelings I felt a year ago when my friend went through it just finding my old screenshots this morning.  I can’t imagine how you feel
1309855207468290048 2020-09-26 21:59:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @ATLSAHM Bingo
1309855149897273345 2020-09-26 21:59:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx @heartsabustin Exactly.  I’ve had the privilege of watching Liam grow and thrive in a family through you.
1309849639860961280 2020-09-26 21:37:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I mentioned last night these groups had gone after Thomas Rhett (country singer) and his wife. Here was the start of that  https://t.co/b22iO2eAle
1309849298365018112 2020-09-26 21:36:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five She is
1309849261094383617 2020-09-26 21:36:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Oh yes and they will do anything to destroy ACB so it will seep other places
1309846495936557056 2020-09-26 21:25:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I don’t blame her.  I really don’t.  Praying for y’all, seriously
1309846301593526273 2020-09-26 21:24:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Yes she is thankfully.  It took a really great counselor
1309846048404312065 2020-09-26 21:23:28 +0800 <just_mindy> And a couple more  https://t.co/ArUA8rckPX
1309842201841733632 2020-09-26 21:08:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is another  https://t.co/6Evl3DAIm2
1309842089186820097 2020-09-26 21:07:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Oh I was real sheltered until these people literally drove my friend to a nervous breakdown
1309841400826077185 2020-09-26 21:05:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcACaputo That account? Oh no. It’s an IG account with 3/4 million followers that has been around for a while.  She does IG lives etc
1309841121200287745 2020-09-26 21:03:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yes.
1309841074911928327 2020-09-26 21:03:42 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend had about 15k followers on her account about fostering &amp; adopting (trying to get people to be foster parents if they felt that call) and she had to lock down for months.  The harassment was that bad.
1309840664138481666 2020-09-26 21:02:04 +0800 <just_mindy> I learned this had become a thing on the left a year ago when my friend who adopted a foster child she had since his Birth, was attacked by one of these accounts.  My coping mechanism is always to learn and that is when I discovered this backlash against transracial adoptions
1309839902167764992 2020-09-26 20:59:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the general gist  https://t.co/QvuwC9D1VV
1309839695480786944 2020-09-26 20:58:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom I totally see how it can happen!!!
1309838205135605760 2020-09-26 20:52:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom It just seems too coincidental
1309837583883685890 2020-09-26 20:49:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Very very very.
1309835204467580928 2020-09-26 20:40:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin I really think this might be it.  I couldn’t figure out why he staying sick and this makes so much sense!!
1309835040059203584 2020-09-26 20:39:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 I have my Master’s Degree in Reading Ed and it wasn’t until I got to the graduate level that I learned about really teaching phonics and graphemes and phonemes.  Thankfully, as a child, my Granny taught me with ABeka, so I already understood a lot because of my childhood
1309834140607549448 2020-09-26 20:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 For some reason, teaching phonics, the thing we know works, has fallen out of fashion. English is a weird language, obviously and kids have to have Phonics. We know this, but we don’t even teach teachers how to teach phonics correctly anymore
1309833479660732418 2020-09-26 20:33:31 +0800 <just_mindy> After reading that thread on COVID &amp; thinking about how sick my son has been twice in the last 6 weeks when he generally is extremely healthy, I’m wondering if the mask wearing he’s required to do at work 24 HOURS A DAY isn’t contributing to this strep/ear infection/tonsil issue.
1309828566167810049 2020-09-26 20:14:00 +0800 <just_mindy> I plan to listen to this as well, but please please read these tweets.  Please.  Also so proud @RonDeSantisFL is my Governor &amp; so glad to see so many in the comments beginning to recognize how right he was about all of this because he read, studied, &amp; sought experts.
1309749111965483008 2020-09-26 14:58:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @yeahrightgirlhg  https://t.co/6bwpveqOUq
1309710947532107777 2020-09-26 12:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I know y’all are great parents.  That’s why she is so happy
1309710469230465024 2020-09-26 12:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep! That’s why we need to get on with it
1309710305010868225 2020-09-26 12:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregWilson28 @noahsmom7 They could all leave as far as I’m concerned
1309710113821818881 2020-09-26 12:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Or that she won’t know about her heritage.
1309709971404328960 2020-09-26 12:22:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I love her.  She is everything!
1309709859609346048 2020-09-26 12:22:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 There is no other explanation
1309709791384788992 2020-09-26 12:22:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno Probably!!
1309708484833873922 2020-09-26 12:16:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Democrats have no scruples.  Fin. It’s why Trump won.  People were sick of it and elected someone capable of slinging mud with them because he knows them.  They were his former friends.
1309707669645778944 2020-09-26 12:13:36 +0800 <just_mindy> One justice can’t impose anything
1309707518155857920 2020-09-26 12:13:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Told ya!
1309706550538391552 2020-09-26 12:09:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Good!!!!  I hope this keeps everyone from thinking that’s an acceptable road to go down
1309703588520828928 2020-09-26 11:57:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 @SaintRPh That’s how I feel
1309703495059230725 2020-09-26 11:57:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jadkins151 @SaintRPh I’m all for it
1309703432987648006 2020-09-26 11:56:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdB_Ohio @SaintRPh French hopefully will advocate for leaving the kids alone.
1309698700617359366 2020-09-26 11:37:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Quick quick
1309698638663372800 2020-09-26 11:37:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 We will see.  I hope there is enough humanity left to leave children alone
1309698497831211010 2020-09-26 11:37:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen Of course they won’t.  They always think the solution is to be more disgusting harder
1309698361327583237 2020-09-26 11:36:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Me either
1309698284873809923 2020-09-26 11:36:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I know it’s coming.  I’ve seen friends who’ve adopted children of other races have to lock their accounts on IG. One friend had a pic of her son in some wildflower fields and overalls (totally normal) &amp; they said she was trying to make him look like he was a cotton picker. No lie
1309697812628635648 2020-09-26 11:34:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 He can’t.  Look at how much he had to allow with Kav
1309697563726163970 2020-09-26 11:33:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen For the kid’s sake, I hope they leave them alone.  I just do not have any faith in that side of the aisle any longer
1309696810852798465 2020-09-26 11:30:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl It is. Rhett’s wife handles it well.  I don’t know how she does it
1309696665679474689 2020-09-26 11:29:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 Oh, I’m confident it is.  I just know how they’ll try to manipulate family members who are desperately impoverished
1309696465074356225 2020-09-26 11:29:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 At least we have each other
1309696361110147072 2020-09-26 11:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh yes.  They are disgusting
1309696285411287040 2020-09-26 11:28:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd Exactly. He has no idea how her family operates
1309696165097676801 2020-09-26 11:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @KPBeachGirl Exactly
1309696120499691520 2020-09-26 11:27:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love It made me laugh
1309696074521751553 2020-09-26 11:27:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Weird, right?
1309695983832436736 2020-09-26 11:27:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom He makes me ill
1309695927263920128 2020-09-26 11:26:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 One would think but abortion has become its own cult and religion and it’s gross
1309695753573601282 2020-09-26 11:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 It’s about me!
1309695665170264070 2020-09-26 11:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> There’s whole organizations now that do this and harass celebrities with Black children on IG.  Thomas Rhett’s wife gets it a lot.  It’s sickening but I’ve seen the play book.
1309695276383383553 2020-09-26 11:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Mark my words
1309692485199949825 2020-09-26 11:13:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Which should apply to any child after week 20
1309691665033105408 2020-09-26 11:10:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaryFernandez This idea that the right should just shut up and the left should get basically infanticide astounds me
1309691439367024640 2020-09-26 11:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly and in cases of rape, women are offered Plan B if they report, &amp; if they choose not to, it’s easily available at all drugstores. A woman who is raped is terrified of pregnancy.  They aren’t waiting until they’re 20 weeks pregnant to check on it
1309690507229048832 2020-09-26 11:05:24 +0800 <just_mindy> LITRALLY me irl
1309689973839454209 2020-09-26 11:03:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes and it’s ok to hire specialists or provide vouchers for families to hire specialists like me to fix the issue
1309689785397673984 2020-09-26 11:02:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ Very true
1309689728325779456 2020-09-26 11:02:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Knowing what we know, I believe the SC has an obligation to ban abortion past viability.  That’s a human rights issue imo.  So 20 weeks should not even be a discussion anymore.  I really believe through week 12 is a huge compromise for the right.
1309688452116623368 2020-09-26 10:57:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ I wouldn’t be shocked if they tried it in these debates because gaslighting
1309688162931834880 2020-09-26 10:56:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge Exactly.  If we slowly change the mindset and culture around abortion, and science continues to change hearts and minds, we will get where we need to be
1309687821494636547 2020-09-26 10:54:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ That’s ridiculous.  There isn’t enough support for Plan B to be overturned
1309687655916097537 2020-09-26 10:54:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Right?
1309687596600176640 2020-09-26 10:53:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t want any abortion, but I am a pragmatist and would fight for a ban after 12 weeks.  The left won’t agree to any restrictions.  That is unconscionable.
1309686093126815744 2020-09-26 10:47:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Plan B is available at any pharmacy for oops encounters or if a woman doesn’t want to report a rape. We need to stop allowing the left to gaslight us on this topic.
1309685811647053825 2020-09-26 10:46:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Most European nations don’t allow abortion after 12-14 weeks.  Only North Korea &amp; China (noted human rights abusers) disrespect the unborn to the level the US allows.  We are in horrible company.
1309685298541072386 2020-09-26 10:44:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Understand that current abortion laws are only supported by 16% of the population.  Talk about minority rule!  We are being railroaded by fringe activists on this topic.  At minimum, our laws should line up with those of other industrialized nations.
1309684782876504064 2020-09-26 10:42:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What they don’t say, in those same polls, 61% of Americans either want it limited to rape or health of mother or only within the 1st trimester.  Only 16% of Americans believe abortion through the 3rd trimester should be legal.
1309683436739866625 2020-09-26 10:37:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, Iowans are huge religious bigots who love abortion
1309682677910573056 2020-09-26 10:34:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe They still need to do the bulletin boards
1309682576630730752 2020-09-26 10:33:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Also that.  And if they can’t read on grade level, hiring people like me who can fix it when they’re little, rather than in the 11th and 12th grade when I now get them.
1309680705266421761 2020-09-26 10:26:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @Spotify Very well could have something to do with it.  It def isn’t about him presenting out there ideas.  Spotify is full of those kinds of podcasts.
1309680407722549249 2020-09-26 10:25:16 +0800 <just_mindy> There is zero zero zero possibility they can legally censor him and let some other podcasts stay.  There are podcasts from the fringe left &amp; right on there and they should all be allowed to stay.  I want to hear what the other side thinks and so should you.
1309679864782479360 2020-09-26 10:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Re: @Spotify staff censoring Rogan: I’m a podcast junkie while riding the boring recumbent bike. There are tons of “problematic” opinions &amp; conspiracies &amp; way out there beliefs on that platform. They’ve picked Rogan because of audience size &amp; his lack of support for Biden.
1309674536003088384 2020-09-26 10:01:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 I think so!

1309668081002831872 2020-09-26 09:36:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all.  My bestie is getting married next month &amp; she is probably sick of my cynical take on love so she sent me this.  This is so precious.  Even my black heart melted. 😭😭  https://t.co/OWTeiq4e9Q
1309667440423567360 2020-09-26 09:33:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 @jones4440 Now I loved that
1309667362560446465 2020-09-26 09:33:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Thank you 😍😍😍
1309667309880070144 2020-09-26 09:33:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 @realchrishynes She does
1309667247691124736 2020-09-26 09:32:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 That’s why I like the women on here.  It’s less that way
1309658408828755979 2020-09-26 08:57:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Right!!  By insulting other women
1309658311931891712 2020-09-26 08:57:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump is literally non stop.  This doesn’t make sense
1309657943416229888 2020-09-26 08:56:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 I wouldn’t blame him
1309657483791790080 2020-09-26 08:54:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 @jones4440 That’s really interesting
1309657434462588928 2020-09-26 08:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember when feminism was about women being individuals and making their own choices and other women cheering them on?  And not all men are bad, and we must have unfettered rights to abortion until up until the minute of delivery.  Good times.
1309656855199834112 2020-09-26 08:51:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @jones4440 Oh really?
1309655720078569472 2020-09-26 08:47:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Don’t think you’ve ever looked more beautiful And you’ve never been more gone    https://t.co/ToyXApG78a

1309645614548951042 2020-09-26 08:07:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 He is more a progressive than a priest

1309645274818711553 2020-09-26 08:05:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Yes.  Basically
1309641792854405120 2020-09-26 07:51:50 +0800 <just_mindy> He knows the answer to this which is why he won’t let anyone reply
1309641428298072066 2020-09-26 07:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It makes me happy you see it.  That’s nice to hear. ❤️
1309640639605288960 2020-09-26 07:47:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 @JesseKellyDC They aren’t smart

1309639726794788864 2020-09-26 07:43:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmikenemesi Oh it’s definitely flattering!
1309638406515941381 2020-09-26 07:38:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmikenemesi That’s what I was afraid of
1309638106044395521 2020-09-26 07:37:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Swojoho That makes me feel good!
1309636977751449601 2020-09-26 07:32:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmikenemesi lol!  I probably don’t want to know lol
1309636871677505537 2020-09-26 07:32:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer Exactly.  All talk
1309633764486713344 2020-09-26 07:19:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @ben_woods15 Too
1309633744098164737 2020-09-26 07:19:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @ben_woods15 Me yoo
1309633682186084353 2020-09-26 07:19:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Not going to lie, my son’s 20 year old friends telling my ragged 45 year old self “You look good” and “where are you heading” is an ego boost. God bless those little liars.
1309631631754432512 2020-09-26 07:11:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle He’s really showing his behind on this topic
1309630365590487040 2020-09-26 07:06:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Trump owed the pro-life wing
1309628702641336323 2020-09-26 06:59:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @rustyscott I mean, that just seems fair
1309626929885126656 2020-09-26 06:52:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five It sure is

1309626675290832896 2020-09-26 06:51:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @ben_woods15 It’s definitely religion.
1309625393478012928 2020-09-26 06:46:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Oh and his bigotry
1309625269729333248 2020-09-26 06:46:10 +0800 <just_mindy> But enough about that “no religious test” thing
1309625056713113600 2020-09-26 06:45:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 @ben_woods15 I think it’s an exposure thing.  Like he doesn’t know about it so he finds it weird
1309624903403003905 2020-09-26 06:44:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 @JoeFL65 He has some weird ideas about religion
1309623881871884288 2020-09-26 06:40:39 +0800 <just_mindy> But continue down this path and offend a whole bunch of Christians.  Whatev
1309623582797029378 2020-09-26 06:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Everyone around me spoke in tongues.  My Dad was a Fortune 500 exec, my Uncle the President of a national grocery chain, one of the men who designs jets for the military &amp; is extremely renowned was a member of our church.  This is dumb.

1309569081968857088 2020-09-26 03:02:54 +0800 <just_mindy> I really do not see Florida being swingy this year.  Too many in Miami Dade and Broward want to keep school choice &amp; the Dems have lost them
1309552457907924992 2020-09-26 01:56:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Can we make a distinction please between “strong women” &amp; “opinionated women”?  The first means a woman has gone through some stuff &amp; thrived.  The second is a woman who talks a lot of what might be nonsense &amp; sorry, no I don’t have to respect that.  Looking at you, Meg Markle.

1309467752848076800 2020-09-25 20:20:15 +0800 <just_mindy> This is what I don’t get.  Why has this been allowed even once? Protestors have no right to deprive taxpayers of use of roads we provide and pay for.  Sorry.

1309422860054794240 2020-09-25 17:21:52 +0800 <just_mindy> There will never ever be Shaq slander on this TL.  I grew up in the tiny town Shaq built his mansion when he made it big with the Magic &amp; he’s literally the kindest celebrity ever. We would see him in the store &amp; he was always friendly and good to people.  Just a PSA.
1309421753060544513 2020-09-25 17:17:28 +0800 <just_mindy> He could have stopped after “among Dems” and this would have been an accurate quote.

1309175460438446081 2020-09-25 00:58:47 +0800 <just_mindy> It does exist.  It’s @LidBiden
1309169485052510212 2020-09-25 00:35:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Thank you so much.   We are hopeful it was caught early
1309167083352207363 2020-09-25 00:25:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ My dad is majorly opposed so I’m not going to upset him during chemo
1309166178452025346 2020-09-25 00:21:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @LidBiden Yes!!!
1309166139575070721 2020-09-25 00:21:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ A tiny hoop
1309166085757861889 2020-09-25 00:21:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @JwLove2befree No prolife person has ever proposed punishing the woman. The physician would be charged
1309165916731641858 2020-09-25 00:20:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy I want to do something with my kid’s initials and also a scripture
1309165761441792001 2020-09-25 00:20:15 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend posted this.  I removed her name for her privacy.  She is obviously in Fl.  She can’t see her Dad but people can shout in the face of old people having Dinner in St. Pete and that’s fine.  @RonDeSantisFL @marcorubio  https://t.co/rnPqCdpCnF
1309161833161515008 2020-09-25 00:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @notjustahooker Yes!

1309159979346268164 2020-09-24 23:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> That part.  https://t.co/eNPvGKxlAN
1309159659736047621 2020-09-24 23:56:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Tattoo?
1309159601879777285 2020-09-24 23:55:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy I’m really wanting one!!
1309158288651677698 2020-09-24 23:50:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Is this what I need to do to stop this string of bad luck? I’ll get my nose pierced after all.  https://t.co/mhwRBU6QOh
1309156385440124928 2020-09-24 23:42:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick Always
1309155687033982980 2020-09-24 23:40:13 +0800 <just_mindy> At 45, there is no way I could keep his schedule.
1309155399032070146 2020-09-24 23:39:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Your side &amp; particularly your wing of the party is leading this rioting, instability and violence. You have a lot of nerve.
1309155125437648901 2020-09-24 23:37:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Even Twitter knew it was a dumb tweet
1309154697136177152 2020-09-24 23:36:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 @pegobry It was indeed
1309154228674400259 2020-09-24 23:34:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Mary Trump is the family kook. It is becoming abundantly clear.
1309153727031500803 2020-09-24 23:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s possible to walk and chew gum.  We can address legality &amp; also provide an atmosphere of love for adoption &amp;/or parenting.  We wouldn’t stop arresting domestic abusers and only address why the abuse happens.  Both pieces are essential.

1309151469833269250 2020-09-24 23:23:27 +0800 <just_mindy> This!! For me, it was buying new slippers yesterday.  https://t.co/PyVi5a1cpy
1309144114605293570 2020-09-24 22:54:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes!! Hopeful for his recovery
1309143988205760520 2020-09-24 22:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @bfwebster We get them on our property occasionally.  I hate an ant bite!  And wow, that would freak me out
1309143618280730625 2020-09-24 22:52:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Until all the elderly people who are Democrats see this
1309143205821243393 2020-09-24 22:50:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Rush1776Rush @RonDeSantisFL Very good
1309139835114975232 2020-09-24 22:37:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Damn.  I was hoping to swim with them.
1309139540934881284 2020-09-24 22:36:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He has B cell Lymphoma.  He had his second round of chemo yesterday so he has 6 more.  I am an only child and he and my mom live behind me so I do all I can to help them.  We are hoping these 8 treatments do the trick!
1309139045293981697 2020-09-24 22:34:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I’ll take you up on that!  ❤️❤️
1309138917892009985 2020-09-24 22:33:35 +0800 <just_mindy> If you think you can do better than this...   https://t.co/cYTdqLOYco
1309137667137904641 2020-09-24 22:28:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 To be fair, my life right now has been messy.  My Dad’s cancer, my son being sick, my divorce, my daughter dealing with the divorce, blah blah blah.  Not everyone is built to deal with that. I get it.  He walked in on a bad chapter for me. I know better seasons are coming
1309134884552744961 2020-09-24 22:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank you.  I really do appreciate it.  It will fade.  I needed to hear some good stuff about me today!
1309134653010386944 2020-09-24 22:16:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I totally agree.  I think once the newness wears off, and you have to deal with the person and their intricacies and their problems, many people find it no longer worth it
1309134335833001995 2020-09-24 22:15:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @asheborn57 I mean, it’s needed
1309134257856696330 2020-09-24 22:15:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Means no more activity for the day.  That’s 9 days this month
1309134164466307072 2020-09-24 22:14:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy I just don’t see it these days.  Friends, yes.  But my intimate partner needs to share basic ideals with me
1309124414521442304 2020-09-24 21:35:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Is there a “Has Biden called a Lid before noon” account on Twitter yet?
1309123312912564224 2020-09-24 21:31:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok y’all. Is anyone at all going to admit this is nuts?!
1309123148076417028 2020-09-24 21:30:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda @JesseKellyDC I’m impressed with anyone who can actually say something “to Jesse’s face” and not need a step stool tbh
1309122347383902210 2020-09-24 21:27:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Love this  ❤️❤️❤️❤️  https://t.co/3UfD6REn4d
1309122138625003521 2020-09-24 21:26:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh yes.  Wish I would have found out months ago, but certainly glad it was all laid out now before thing went any further
1309121958802587657 2020-09-24 21:26:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!! That is what it is all about.  Some people grow complacent with that though.  It isn’t exciting enough
1309104290670227460 2020-09-24 20:15:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 And how bad they can make you feel when you realize you weren’t important at all
1309104145866031108 2020-09-24 20:15:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 One would think so but I’ve learned contentment is a character trait some people have &amp; others never develop
1309103839774150662 2020-09-24 20:14:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Very true
1309087193118519306 2020-09-24 19:08:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @mrbigdubya Exactly
1309087109643415558 2020-09-24 19:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Tons of fulfillment can be found in a long term comfortable relationship. Not taking the other person for granted is the crucial part
1309086689072164867 2020-09-24 19:06:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Very recent.  I’m too much of a believer in love to write relationships off.  I just have to hope to find someone with similar intentions
1309082736028798977 2020-09-24 18:50:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Dead cops is the world they wish to see
1309082442872033285 2020-09-24 18:49:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Just really smart people like you, apparently
1309080051158319110 2020-09-24 18:39:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  A huge waste of 6 months that could have been avoided
1309079863630888960 2020-09-24 18:38:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 They always fear they are missing out on something when reality is there is tons of fulfillment being with one person
1309076678296186889 2020-09-24 18:26:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  Hard to accept sometimes but absolutely true.  https://t.co/IXe3Ulg6Xi
1309076491569856512 2020-09-24 18:25:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I think most southern women are still pretty faithful to their man and good men still are faithful.  There are just too many who aren’t
1309076232659783680 2020-09-24 18:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh that’s so good.  I hadn’t thought about that story in years.  Perfect analogy
1309070739065237505 2020-09-24 18:02:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Katie prefers her Dom activities be between boss/employee and not husband and wife.
1309001422336393217 2020-09-24 13:27:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh, I love that!!!  And it’s so true!! ❤️❤️

1308963043322277889 2020-09-24 10:54:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow
1308962216817971201 2020-09-24 10:51:26 +0800 <just_mindy> And another one.  This time in DC

1308957648650371072 2020-09-24 10:33:17 +0800 <just_mindy> More mostly peaceful protests @RonDeSantisFL
1308956257475276803 2020-09-24 10:27:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, read Mollie’s book if you need a refresher.  And look at my banner pic
1308955991388622849 2020-09-24 10:26:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Oh yes.  They’re snowbirds in St Pete!! Def Dems down from up North
1308955806314958850 2020-09-24 10:25:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Probably both
1308955467373326336 2020-09-24 10:24:37 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s going to lose his job
1308955288482045953 2020-09-24 10:23:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas Good!!!  They need to be safe!
1308955167488978945 2020-09-24 10:23:25 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re more ignorant than your husband
1308954538901155841 2020-09-24 10:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, wouldn’t you love that.  No way.
1308954479161733120 2020-09-24 10:20:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Not in Florida
1308954316401713152 2020-09-24 10:20:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, my parents are sending it to all their elderly Dem friends right now.  All live in Fl. Asking them if they’re ok with this.  I appreciate the mess out of this video
1308953896770056192 2020-09-24 10:18:22 +0800 <just_mindy> And most of the old folks in this county are Dem transplants from up north.  You just made new Trump voters
1308951696949809152 2020-09-24 10:09:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u Yep.  The issue is St. Pete this time of year is mostly older folks
1308951520000593921 2020-09-24 10:08:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Girl!! I’m glad my son is FF in Polk so Grady and team protect him and I’m glad my Chief of Police was the bald man standing right behind Grady at that press conference
1308951164399112193 2020-09-24 10:07:31 +0800 <just_mindy> National Divorce
1308950982580146176 2020-09-24 10:06:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I don’t understand basic law in Fl? Pretty sure I do.  He said “I’m going to knock your old ass boyfriend out”.  That’s “imminent threat of danger” and meets Stand Your Ground”
1308950696763576322 2020-09-24 10:05:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I don’t get it
1308950597970821122 2020-09-24 10:05:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 @MaxNordau Same.  At least that’s useful
1308950228893085698 2020-09-24 10:03:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Certainly qualifies for Stand Your Ground
1308950017110159362 2020-09-24 10:02:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok pal  https://t.co/umTHDo4KOV
1308949842287382530 2020-09-24 10:02:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  I texted this to 4 older Dem relatives tonight and told them to consider that couple before they voted Biden. They were shocked that was happening in Florida.
1308948896593391618 2020-09-24 09:58:30 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, yes.  Our Stand Your Ground law is “did you feel in imminent threat of harm”.  Could anyone argue that couple didn’t meet that standard?
1308948502253367296 2020-09-24 09:56:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaxNordau Every day
1308948240197451777 2020-09-24 09:55:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe But we know that now.  He took that up back in June
1308948112644472833 2020-09-24 09:55:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 @chrislhayes I know it.  How sad
1308948064187617281 2020-09-24 09:55:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @grumpypachyderm @Neoavatara Oh yes
1308948002330095616 2020-09-24 09:54:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I have no idea other than he was believing initial reported facts
1308947230968119296 2020-09-24 09:51:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton @eriContrarian Right.  As @JustEric it was a dumb question by dumb people
1308947097631313921 2020-09-24 09:51:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, they would have caught these hands had that been my parents.  Also, Florida is a stand your ground state and I would have no problem convincing a jury I felt threatened when I pulled out my pistol.  And my dad pulled out his.
1308946679777853442 2020-09-24 09:49:42 +0800 <just_mindy> And when we say rarely, we mean never.  Right @chrislhayes You were calling out groups earlier
1308946133948026880 2020-09-24 09:47:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 With this kind of nonsense, yep
1308946072736280576 2020-09-24 09:47:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @LuluVol Yes.  You were.

1308945893387907072 2020-09-24 09:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear See? I’m easy to please.  Just one nice one.
1308945749753958404 2020-09-24 09:46:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This isn’t far from where @PolkCoSheriff Grady Judd is in charge.  He needs to take a drive over &amp; show St. Pete how to get this under control.
1308945392692867072 2020-09-24 09:44:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @chrislhayes this is what is inspiring militias.  Not Trump.  This.

1308943644527931399 2020-09-24 09:37:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I mean why harass those old people
1308943038643871745 2020-09-24 09:35:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Yes.  He’s really bad at this
1308942950278352896 2020-09-24 09:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Dinner reservations!!
1308942896343678977 2020-09-24 09:34:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Dinner reservations being the first of course.
1308942070489518080 2020-09-24 09:31:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @eriContrarian Yep
1308941616300916739 2020-09-24 09:29:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Exactly
1308941576874450949 2020-09-24 09:29:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @oja_andrea @realDonaldTrump I know.  When he is ever going to measure up
1308941447505358855 2020-09-24 09:28:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 😂😂
1308941389577752581 2020-09-24 09:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> These folks are my parent’s age and this makes me so ragey.  Enough.
1308940628781395969 2020-09-24 09:25:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Thanks for helping turn Florida red.  Also @RonDeSantisFL check this out
1308940101909647360 2020-09-24 09:23:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Pray also for their wives, husbands, children and parents.  This night will be awful for them too.
1308939637348536320 2020-09-24 09:21:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric @LibertyJen And I wish he would have said what you just said instead  https://t.co/LH2A0FXnrz
1308939340442210305 2020-09-24 09:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, Trump is a very bad dictator fascist because he has started zero wars and is trying to bring our military home while brokering peace in the ME &amp; respecting Israel.  He really sucks at being an authoritarian.
1308938847951171584 2020-09-24 09:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump should tweet a clarification so the Media has it in writing and can move on
1308938588340588549 2020-09-24 09:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is why Trump being a goof ball is being made the big news of the day by Media.  So, everyone can ignore that the other candidate is barely functioning
1308938109212667904 2020-09-24 09:15:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Obama said he had a pen and a phone intimating he could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.  Spare me.
1308937145659338753 2020-09-24 09:11:49 +0800 <just_mindy> And finally, the only people who haven’t accepted election results as of late have been @TheDemocrats such as Hilary, Stacy Abrams, Gillum.  Abrams still hasn’t conceded for cripes sake.  The press should be asking Kamala and her VP candidate if they will accept the results.
1308936413224800257 2020-09-24 09:08:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, a reminder Trump let cities burn while people were suggesting he take a firmer stance.  His base was begging for it.  He didn’t do it.  The dude isn’t trying to sit in jail.
1308935885354827776 2020-09-24 09:06:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @LuluVol @Neoavatara Yes and he’s always trying to think of a sick burn so he says dumb stuff
1308935752986890250 2020-09-24 09:06:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany @Neoavatara Right.  He’s not going to utter those words ever in his life
1308935662276669442 2020-09-24 09:05:55 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, instead of the American media asking “why is Joe Biden basically a no show for this campaign”, now they get to go pretend our military are all going to back the President against the will of citizens and the FBI &amp; CIA are suddenly Trump allies.  https://t.co/3B3jOlbbPT
1308934792390508545 2020-09-24 09:02:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara But he won’t because he loves the song and dance with them as much as they crave it.  Like I said, he needs to stop the tango but they feed off each other
1308934288151281666 2020-09-24 09:00:27 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s also the press trying to make Trump look like some crazy dictator commie boogie man so the public will insist he not make this SC pick.  Let’s all take a breath.
1308933874026717185 2020-09-24 08:58:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all know good and well Trump will leave the WH if he loses.  Stop being silly.  This is nothing but the press trying to distract the public from the fact Biden isn’t even campaigning. Trump allows the press to goad him &amp; he shouldn’t, but this argument is dumb.
1308923564981202946 2020-09-24 08:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy She was great

1308869315555479552 2020-09-24 04:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Of course
1308863325695025152 2020-09-24 04:18:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Thread
1308859748624855043 2020-09-24 04:04:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yes.  He’s also absolutely an enabler. No doubt
1308859603258662916 2020-09-24 04:03:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 @ChickfilA Yes!!  Try it!!!
1308859533624848385 2020-09-24 04:03:24 +0800 <just_mindy> As much as children, even adult ones, like to romanticize their addict parents, it’s mostly a living hell.  Hunter might be sober now (who knows), but it is clear he lived off the connections his father provided.  He also needs to be a father to his new kid.
1308859126580211712 2020-09-24 04:01:47 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughters can now see this because they went through al-anon and other codependency counseling.  Loving an addict is always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Always.  Which is why Hunter has illegitimate children and crazy romantic entanglements.
1308858577315155969 2020-09-24 03:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m going to comment on this because Naomi could be my daughters talking about their Father.  He’s a musician &amp; has many great qualities and we have some good memories.  But my ex husband like Hunter, is an addict and that means they also have another awful side.
1308855904050216964 2020-09-24 03:48:59 +0800 <just_mindy> False, but also, what are you and what have you done?  You’re literally a troll on Twitter stirring up divisiveness and trampling the reputations of people who have actual accomplishments.  Those who can, do.  Those who can’t, apparently work for Vox.
1308845358940913669 2020-09-24 03:07:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I did the new @ChickfilA mocha Cream and it was delish.  https://t.co/e0OfJ0LW0I
1308843647295725570 2020-09-24 03:00:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomFLDude Oh yes
1308842879444570115 2020-09-24 02:57:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @blackngoldproud In addition, he got a woman pregnant while with his dead brother’s widow, so she she left him, he still does acknowledge that child even after a paternity test.  He’s slime
1308839573729030147 2020-09-24 02:44:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 I think that is possible, but I really think they want 2020 too.  Biden would after a year and then Harris would take over
1308836853609631749 2020-09-24 02:33:17 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s right
1308836306726813696 2020-09-24 02:31:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Right??

1308749875857821698 2020-09-23 20:47:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The best descriptor of my current season in life.  https://t.co/5AE2rjip8X
1308745684590436363 2020-09-23 20:31:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Indeed
1308741658188673046 2020-09-23 20:15:01 +0800 <just_mindy> And apparently he likes to collude with Russians.
1308714666596724737 2020-09-23 18:27:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Praying with you.
1308629228225732608 2020-09-23 12:48:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!   Saw this meme today and it’s so true  https://t.co/FOYIkfa1q0
1308620981469093888 2020-09-23 12:15:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeBHousson LITRALLY
1308620917749284864 2020-09-23 12:15:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 Oh yes!!
1308620827261362180 2020-09-23 12:14:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @monkeyboy100001 He is a mess!!  Cracks me up
1308620704988958726 2020-09-23 12:14:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Definitely no time to savor anything there
1308620566635610112 2020-09-23 12:13:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 They feel they are superior
1308620434687037440 2020-09-23 12:13:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I know Matt Gaetz is calling for an investigation

1308575592778997760 2020-09-23 09:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @ejm1963 Wow is one word
1308575518095179776 2020-09-23 09:14:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Tuesday81865744 Wouldn’t it be bad to be that guy
1308574694136832005 2020-09-23 09:11:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut Exactly

1308574524103954432 2020-09-23 09:10:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 🤣🤣
1308574466994249732 2020-09-23 09:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Yes
1308574438963769344 2020-09-23 09:10:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear No it was the ultimate quickie
1308574315944841217 2020-09-23 09:10:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @bbanck @justanurse25 Very little napping occurred
1308574251033690113 2020-09-23 09:09:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut 1 pump
1308574206561583104 2020-09-23 09:09:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron No judgment zone B
1308574122579054594 2020-09-23 09:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @justanurse25 Very true
1308571950038614017 2020-09-23 09:00:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Oh yes
1308571008975200257 2020-09-23 08:56:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Except he has huge crowds
1308570421558743043 2020-09-23 08:54:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes 8/22 days in September
1308570276830081024 2020-09-23 08:54:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Most people can infer it means Biden isn’t campaigning because they don’t see him
1308570066129170432 2020-09-23 08:53:10 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m not bored by it at all.  I want to know why someone allegedly able to run the country isn’t working 36% of the month so far.
1308569763472384000 2020-09-23 08:51:58 +0800 <just_mindy> The real question is why reporters aren’t asking why he isn’t working over 1/3 a month this close to the election
1308569086364971008 2020-09-23 08:49:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Probably
1308564980304875523 2020-09-23 08:32:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I still don’t get how @TwitterSafety allows this but suspends other people for saying a bad word
1308564540062396416 2020-09-23 08:31:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Also that
1308564140584206336 2020-09-23 08:29:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Awesome
1308563482930032640 2020-09-23 08:27:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Has anyone told Chris that Biden is going to get COVID by this weekend?
1308563228155416576 2020-09-23 08:26:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!
1308563180323590144 2020-09-23 08:25:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jerrymusings Totally!!
1308559669242322944 2020-09-23 08:11:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @MonsieurUgarte Exactly
1308559620038942722 2020-09-23 08:11:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear A very bad person
1308559527973851136 2020-09-23 08:11:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Yes!!! Way more fun
1308551867488759809 2020-09-23 07:40:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax A candapult!!!  Yessss
1308551710361694215 2020-09-23 07:40:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy I know.  That’s why we keep liking them sometimes
1308551601104261120 2020-09-23 07:39:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 I know they have to but something has to give
1308548934151929857 2020-09-23 07:29:12 +0800 <just_mindy> This guy made a candy chute so they can trick or treat and send candy to the kids. How cute!!  https://t.co/uUo4sjcjXj

1308546304608538625 2020-09-23 07:18:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno Irredeemable
1308546247251374083 2020-09-23 07:18:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Probably
1308542423161810944 2020-09-23 07:03:19 +0800 <just_mindy> There would be harsh words
1308541540441165825 2020-09-23 06:59:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @BeltoWNC Oh for sure!!

1308540785797758976 2020-09-23 06:56:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 I’m the worst
1308540668944449540 2020-09-23 06:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 Exactly
1308540592335523846 2020-09-23 06:56:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 😂😂
1308540524765360130 2020-09-23 06:55:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @varadmehta They’ll support whatever the DNC tells them to
1308540354241720321 2020-09-23 06:55:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is literally the dumbest argument and anyone who makes it insults first responders.   DYING FROM A GUNSHOT TO THE HEAD is not equal to dying from a pandemic, jerk off.
1308539715122089995 2020-09-23 06:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, totally.  Joe Biden who has to go to bed every day at 9 am will save us all
1308538490787958784 2020-09-23 06:47:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Blue_MD Lebron has been paying them in Fl.  Fine with me.  Victims get their money
1308537952260194305 2020-09-23 06:45:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally me  https://t.co/BXhkHUJ8yU
1308537608298004480 2020-09-23 06:44:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So @realDonaldTrump needs to tweet tonight his belief this will happen.  That is the only way it might not happen
1308525689847656448 2020-09-23 05:56:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @kimmrz60 Ha!!!  Come shop with me!
1308524635307364353 2020-09-23 05:52:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmrz60 The clogging is annoying but the whipping around you really bugs me
1308524487525179404 2020-09-23 05:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @PublixHelps Thank you!!
1308524428813381634 2020-09-23 05:51:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 That’s a fact
1308524364900564999 2020-09-23 05:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 It will be interesting to see
1308519278166118401 2020-09-23 05:31:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @PublixHelps Clermont, FL Citrus Tower ❤️
1308512995589402625 2020-09-23 05:06:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Girl.  I almost got heated today.  And it’s always men.  Like back tf off of me
1308512822415032321 2020-09-23 05:05:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy They’re the people you pay to shop for you
1308511247047036935 2020-09-23 04:59:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Are the Instacart shoppers at your grocery stores unnecessarily aggressive? Like fast walking and whipping around you in the store.  It’s starting to get super annoying. Like make your money but chill.
1308489611635720195 2020-09-23 03:33:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo We’ll see
1308487039713767430 2020-09-23 03:23:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo I don’t think it will happen
1308486727229677571 2020-09-23 03:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine This is a great song.  The lyrics really move me
1308483888780652544 2020-09-23 03:10:44 +0800 <just_mindy> A friend just shared this on FB:  https://t.co/DVCvCPIJ1F
1308482640262168576 2020-09-23 03:05:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo Yes.  Sept 29
1308482249357168641 2020-09-23 03:04:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo I wonder when the announcement will come
1308482051176366082 2020-09-23 03:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That’s true
1308482012030918660 2020-09-23 03:03:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine I prefer a nooner personally
1308481851896586241 2020-09-23 03:02:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins @politicsofamy They will definitely try their best
1308481742232223751 2020-09-23 03:02:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy No. He’d look foolish
1308481390611181569 2020-09-23 03:00:48 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/vy9KP3EEYq
1308479913519976450 2020-09-23 02:54:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That would be insane though.  People don’t like Clinton
1308479799724257283 2020-09-23 02:54:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy I don’t see any way he could
1308478242748346380 2020-09-23 02:48:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @SaintRPh He probably does and not the girl kind
1308478138935119875 2020-09-23 02:47:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I think they know too much of their base would hate that
1308477303014535170 2020-09-23 02:44:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @politicsofamy Too late
1308477067927924741 2020-09-23 02:43:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Yep.  Back him into a corner
1308476469484630016 2020-09-23 02:41:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Exactly!!!!
1308473448713379840 2020-09-23 02:29:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden is absolutely going to get COVID or be around a COVID positive person and need to quarantine for 14 days. This will mean he cancels debate
1308473036597792768 2020-09-23 02:27:36 +0800 <just_mindy> 36% of the time Biden calls a lid before noon
1308455168879595522 2020-09-23 01:16:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 @WaltzingMtilda Exactly
1308455112130662407 2020-09-23 01:16:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa @WaltzingMtilda I’ve read some information I did not before over the last couple of days so I think so too
1308454919352004609 2020-09-23 01:15:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy 😍😍😍that was so kind!
1308453985377026048 2020-09-23 01:11:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda Is the announcement about charges against the officers? I assume that is what it is.
1308453576512069634 2020-09-23 01:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Indeed!
1308453543637118976 2020-09-23 01:10:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow You’re probably not too far off
1308447418845990922 2020-09-23 00:45:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, Christian has moved on from anonymously harassing women on Twitter, I see
1308445904744189953 2020-09-23 00:39:48 +0800 <just_mindy> The whole campaign is silent.  They are banking on the media doing their job.
1308445680801910787 2020-09-23 00:38:54 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s stunning.  Trump is running the country plus jetting off to two or 3 states a day and making speeches.  No matter your politics, it’s clear Trump has way more vigor.
1308444642573254657 2020-09-23 00:34:47 +0800 <just_mindy> What candidate in recent history has spent days and days before the debate “preparing”
1308442797456928769 2020-09-23 00:27:27 +0800 <just_mindy> They seem to think the military and police will be on their side which seems like a huge assumption
1308441841570897920 2020-09-23 00:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Hook me up Yasso! 🥰🥰🥰
1308441666513235970 2020-09-23 00:22:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer @melifix @NiedsG Oh I haven’t tried those!!
1308441566193881090 2020-09-23 00:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @yassofroyo @melifix @NiedsG I totally am but they are on clearance at my Target so now I’m scared they are going away!!  I bought 4 boxes!
1308435499275739136 2020-09-22 23:58:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmrz60 Exactly.  You can’t plan things like that
1308429148281544704 2020-09-22 23:33:13 +0800 <just_mindy> The only reason it hasn’t is the restraint of conservatives
1308428942341267456 2020-09-22 23:32:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Dude, no one is scared of you
1308428787567263745 2020-09-22 23:31:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy @hale_razor And it’s every time.  How about one time and then let me opt out
1308428142047105025 2020-09-22 23:29:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Ew
1308427905341501441 2020-09-22 23:28:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m going to cash in my dying wish early and ask for Trump to fill RBG’s seat
1308427499471351808 2020-09-22 23:26:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe it’ll be a boy?
1308426417940705281 2020-09-22 23:22:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 There is too much Biden in our Trumpy area too
1308424905336258562 2020-09-22 23:16:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @hale_razor Exactly!!
1308424842992115714 2020-09-22 23:16:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 I am finally starting to see a good amount
1308424737178218499 2020-09-22 23:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobsFunGirl Right?
1308423549288407047 2020-09-22 23:10:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Ha!!  We have two yard signs
1308423472142585857 2020-09-22 23:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 Drives me nuts
1308421732936675335 2020-09-22 23:03:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Yes. It’s utterly ridiculous
1308421415176200196 2020-09-22 23:02:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman I’m hoping he isn’t playing word games
1308420501153427456 2020-09-22 22:58:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 She is wearing a very breathable cloth mask that passes their test but probably doesn’t actually do much
1308420349575475201 2020-09-22 22:58:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Yes they have no choice
1308420298908356608 2020-09-22 22:58:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I knew a good Mormon couldn’t back away from protecting life and as much as he infuriates me, I give him credit for this.
1308419524211945473 2020-09-22 22:54:58 +0800 <just_mindy> My kid is on week 5 of face to face school in Florida. 2 cases in a school of 2000.  Now just hoping they can stop wearing masks all day soon.  She doesn’t even complain about the mask anymore because she is just so glad to be back with other kids.
1308357105657810944 2020-09-22 18:46:56 +0800 <just_mindy> And Dems should def keep trying to defend this because it was super popular with the American people
1308356899893633024 2020-09-22 18:46:07 +0800 <just_mindy> He was accused of gang rape &amp; drug cartels when he was 16 &amp; 17 yet somehow he was magically reformed and never harassed a woman in his whole professional career other than the girls on his kid’s basketball team he coached or something.  Sounds fair.
1308252855787302912 2020-09-22 11:52:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda @noahsmom7 It’s been so odd! I can’t shake it.  Sending you love and hugs too, Amy! ❤️
1308252557274484737 2020-09-22 11:51:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelBruner @Gator_Country @MollyRatty Yes!! I think many coaches could relate to that fear of being falsely accused
1308250261220139009 2020-09-22 11:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Ha!!!!
1308250173198524417 2020-09-22 11:42:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @raymond04489465 Yes!
1308250062418587648 2020-09-22 11:41:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gator_Country @MollyRatty Oh yes!!! Forgot that!!

1308248372495683584 2020-09-22 11:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 I’m sad tonight too.  Sending you love and light and hugs and good vibes from Florida. ❤️
1308247698479480833 2020-09-22 11:32:12 +0800 <just_mindy> He should withhold federal funding as he threatened, then.
1308247433546268673 2020-09-22 11:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 @MollyRatty They will go with the “cult” angle with her.  At the minimum
1308247215329153024 2020-09-22 11:30:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty @Gurgun1989 Bingo
1308246060947603461 2020-09-22 11:25:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I needed that 2 cents tonight.  Thank you! ❤️
1308245924054007808 2020-09-22 11:25:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 @MollyRatty If the other side is honorable and also makes concessions, I agree.  The Dems never ever concede one inch. At some point, you have to take your wins when you can knowing full well they will do the same
1308244244159762432 2020-09-22 11:18:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jstan_7561 She’s a nut
1308244066673590274 2020-09-22 11:17:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty And running a narcotics ring
1308243782941450241 2020-09-22 11:16:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @jstan_7561 That’s an interesting choice she made!
1308243711940268033 2020-09-22 11:16:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank you for saying that.  Just wish it was as easy to lose weight now as then lol
1308243511448399874 2020-09-22 11:15:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy She’s getting ready for the second Trump term
1308243358889005056 2020-09-22 11:14:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @N5Tiny @ChickfilA Awesome!!  Kind of excited to try it now!
1308243275044847618 2020-09-22 11:14:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @EEElverhoy 🤣🤣🤣
1308243224511885312 2020-09-22 11:14:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mimizhusband Very true
1308240902742310912 2020-09-22 11:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 The good old days when I was still in my 20’s and fine lol
1308240682612666374 2020-09-22 11:04:19 +0800 <just_mindy> What’s hiding under her dress?
1308240409919991811 2020-09-22 11:03:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @paulsyy01 I mean at some point, he needs to answer a question
1308240165027164161 2020-09-22 11:02:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 I sure hope so!!
1308240098891313152 2020-09-22 11:02:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno It was!
1308240038979919878 2020-09-22 11:01:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I was 27 and he was like 45 so there were always Monica comparisons, yes
1308239855609098240 2020-09-22 11:01:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas True! You’re probably going to have to to get it really under control
1308239704761004033 2020-09-22 11:00:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love @ChickfilA Ahhh!!! Good to know!!! I’m going to try it tomorrow
1308239599114878977 2020-09-22 11:00:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @JTHVerhovek @WBAY He should just ride around in a glass chariot waving at all the citizens as he rides around the country and never utter an opinion or a policy stance so the focus won’t change.  He also shouldn’t debate.  Just stand there &amp; blow kisses to the crowd.
1308239125171130370 2020-09-22 10:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> He should hole up in his basement and not say anything and then he can’t make any errors!!  What could go wrong?
1308238586215530496 2020-09-22 10:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Isn’t that sort of the point of vetting a candidate?
1308238193276354561 2020-09-22 10:54:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Do
1308238175760941056 2020-09-22 10:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas But so y’all have mosquitoes?!
1308238083763113984 2020-09-22 10:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Because everyone knows it’s between one of two women who went through the process for lower court noms not that long ago.
1308237758520078337 2020-09-22 10:52:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Girl, we live in Florida.  They eat mosquitoes
1308237500939415552 2020-09-22 10:51:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @owen_smommy Yes!!!  It brought back such awful memories
1308237403291881473 2020-09-22 10:51:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Ha!!!  This ex was something.  He was Literally a Bill Clinton impersonator for a living when we dated.  It was an interesting relationship to say the least
1308236542108938241 2020-09-22 10:47:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Everyone should watch this again.  I forgot the pain.  We all need the reminder of what the left is capable of.
1308235314402676739 2020-09-22 10:42:59 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s so good
1308232436489256960 2020-09-22 10:31:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @_SolidOrange @ChickfilA It looks really chocolatey but I’m going to try it

1308222019822125058 2020-09-22 09:50:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Music is my thing and I have like out of body moments and memories. One of the best is when I was like 12 or 13 and hearing Lenny Kravitz sing “It ain’t over til it’s over” on some late night TV show live.  It was so pure and good.  I’ve adored him since.
1308221453473546241 2020-09-22 09:47:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @magicalmomU7 I know it!!! He is so odd!

1308220583667290115 2020-09-22 09:44:27 +0800 <just_mindy> If you watch this with sound off, it looks like she bakes children in pies so.....

1308219810191466496 2020-09-22 09:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Oh, that won’t go away that easy
1308219716608110592 2020-09-22 09:41:00 +0800 <just_mindy> If they redo the Cosby’s, can I be grown up Lisa Bonet just for her wardrobe and the chance to make out with Lenny Kravitz in my private life?

1308156572477120514 2020-09-22 05:30:05 +0800 <just_mindy> My Dad: Mindy, did you hear Hilary Clinton called Trump &amp; asked if she could replace RBG?  Me: what did Trump say?  My Dad: Trump said it was fine with him but he would have to check with the funeral director.   🥺😩🙄 clearly chemo sick has worn off for now.

We are headed to Doc soon obvs, but I would love some prayers. Thank you!!

1307843321356849158 2020-09-21 08:45:21 +0800 <just_mindy> And if the making out is real good,  mouths are all up in each other’s inner sanctums so mask touching is the least of the ways it could be spread.  High risk = high reward ❤️❤️

1307755930902241281 2020-09-21 02:58:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Florida is because I have a good friend whose son is starting OL but UCF is my team and alma mater

1307712445071396866 2020-09-21 00:05:17 +0800 <just_mindy> A Christian who knows we have the opportunity to finally protect the unborn but his feelings are more important than stopping infanticide
1307712163465834496 2020-09-21 00:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Because they know he is unfit and Kamala will be the actual President

1307679646247419905 2020-09-20 21:54:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 That’s really awesome.  And I’m hoping for DIL who loves me like your mom loved hers.  My mom was that way to her MIL too.
1307679124803194880 2020-09-20 21:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Another reason to vote Trump.  This kind of mess.  It never ends. Why would anyone want these people in charge?
1307678884842876928 2020-09-20 21:51:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Ain’t that the truth.
1307678792433926151 2020-09-20 21:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @thekimcam Exactly.  My mom and her friend were chatting on the sidewalk outside the post office the other day.  My mom had her mask in her hand because outside and this guy started yelling at her to put it on.  She was outside and her friend was standing 6 ft away.  Ppl are ridiculous
1307678173442846721 2020-09-20 21:49:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick @montaga I hope!
1307678097286852608 2020-09-20 21:48:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 My cousins def helped me.  It’s hitting me more now that my Dad is ill.
1307677551981142019 2020-09-20 21:46:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1307677240050831361 2020-09-20 21:45:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, if you can’t vote Trump, at least vote Republican down the rest of the ballot so there are checks and balances on the agenda Harris plans to usher in. Your local races, too.  That will matter when they start flipping tables in your town like this.
1307676366201122816 2020-09-20 21:41:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @thekimcam I also don’t understand the mask police.  If you have on a mask, and they work, go away from people who don’t have them on.  I don’t agree with yelling at women of any age by a man, but she engaged.  Those people were eating dinner and minding their own.
1307675794383286273 2020-09-20 21:39:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What I don’t understand is the “burn it all down” because Republicans are led by Trump. He’s got 4 more years tops. If you give people like Kamala Harris &amp; AOC power for 4 years, there is no telling where we’ll be and once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to put it back
1307675159642492928 2020-09-20 21:37:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Wouldn’t you be thrilled to have a gentleman like Pence leading our country? A man of his word, conscience, and faith.  Y’all swoon over Mitt.  Pence is Mitt on steroids.  Won’t even meet with women alone! So pull the lever for him then!
1307674641071304705 2020-09-20 21:35:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And if your answer to that is, “Trump can’t hold a glass, and he looks feeble”, ok, let’s go with that. That means Pence would be President and hallelujah to that.  No more worries about mean words &amp; he’s a completely faithful spouse.  Isn’t that what you were looking for?
1307674183330037761 2020-09-20 21:33:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally, it’s clear we can look at Biden and know Harris will be the actual President.  She is rated the 2nd most liberal Senator ABOVE BERNIE, so you know where that is heading. A right leaning or centrist is voting for that because bad orange man?
1307673328426143745 2020-09-20 21:29:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That should be the net effect and let’s hope it is.
1307673210419376128 2020-09-20 21:29:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ByronHoffman6 Right? Yes.  I wish Trump would shut TF up sometimes.  I wouldn’t want to be his wife or even his friend.  But he’s been a decent President up against this social justice brigade who haven’t given him a moment’s peace since inauguration.
1307672735028568064 2020-09-20 21:27:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump hasn’t burned down your town.  Trump isn’t trying to teach kids they are inherently evil &amp; America is bad. Trump isn’t trying to get you fired fr your job if you don’t BLM hard enough.  Trump isn’t taking over sports.  Why would you punish yourself because Trump is mean?
1307671976404832257 2020-09-20 21:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 She’s quite the hottie
1307671469997121536 2020-09-20 21:22:28 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why I’m so confused.  May I share? I understand people’s reluctance to vote Trump. He’s abrasive.  But, a  party who supports this is the alternative.  And I assure you, this is way more abrasive. Trump hasn’t ever shouted in your face while you enjoyed a meal.
1307670686148833281 2020-09-20 21:19:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all must not remember how mad Graham got that day.  I remember his righteous anger. That is when Lindsay Graham was red pilled imo

1307526979252637696 2020-09-20 11:48:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Yep.  Experiencing that with my Dad now.  The kids and I aren’t doing even church as not to bring things home.  I’m spending a lot of time piddling in the yard because I know it’s good for my mental health to be outside
1307526299045462020 2020-09-20 11:45:37 +0800 <just_mindy> This looks like bad Mary Poppins

1307524771396059136 2020-09-20 11:39:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 @KatMcKinley Yes!

1307524548347265024 2020-09-20 11:38:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer Yes! I’m glad to have them all.  Particularly since I’m older raising my 14 year old alone.  My older kids are good to help with her
1307523878743420928 2020-09-20 11:35:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 Ha!  I always tell my girls the only one who will look after me is my son
1307523432226095104 2020-09-20 11:34:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 Yes.  I’m sure there are seasons of life
1307523356116254722 2020-09-20 11:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja Obviously I have no spouse now but my adult kids help when they can
1307523224377405447 2020-09-20 11:33:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas One positive is y’all will be so close!! My parents have a house right behind me and are my best friends.  It also made them able to give my 4 kids lots of attention.  My dad never misses a ball game or a track meet.
1307522734260400128 2020-09-20 11:31:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 Right!
1307522642740641792 2020-09-20 11:31:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer I would love a sibling to share life with.  I’m lucky to have cousins I’m close to but they have their own parents to care for

1307522292071763968 2020-09-20 11:29:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 They already are saying she is part of a cult
1307522176912887808 2020-09-20 11:29:14 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m an only child who ached for siblings.  Now that my folks are aging, everything falls to me.  My 4 children will tell you they are so thankful to have each other and are glad they have several siblings. They are also all well loved even though I often did it alone.
1307521632781688832 2020-09-20 11:27:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @UserName14948 @SeanBannion She is lovely

1307521154182254598 2020-09-20 11:25:10 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s a terrible experience for you, but many women have large families and are affectionate and loving.  Some women have 1 child and can’t handle it. Your experience doesn’t mean that is true of all large families
1307516780408168451 2020-09-20 11:07:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @raymond04489465 Love it!

1307507697802194945 2020-09-20 10:31:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @JenVitry @LisaTurnage12 Since he wasn’t a rapist, I have no issue defending him.   I’m sure you defend Biden who has worse allegations and the LT Gov of Virginia who has multiple contemporary allegations.

1307397861936685058 2020-09-20 03:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> We don’t negotiate with terrorists
1307397403092357121 2020-09-20 03:13:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Now is a great time to pray and fast for the President, our Senate, and the candidate and their family.  They need divine protection and fighters in the spiritual realm.    Ephesians 6:12
1307396500322832384 2020-09-20 03:09:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Mitch killed her.  She couldn’t retire during the Obama years, apparently.

1307394055828054020 2020-09-20 03:00:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Looking at that picture this morning has me emotional
1307393787195523092 2020-09-20 02:59:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 @KamalaHarris Yes.  As a mother of a son, I look at his mom and know she collapsed on the floor of her bedroom that night.  It took her entire will to sit there and not scream in rage.

1307391578642812937 2020-09-20 02:50:17 +0800 <just_mindy> All those Republicans should want a conservative court way more
1307389928922329088 2020-09-20 02:43:43 +0800 <just_mindy> A brain, genetics &amp; a man who loves me
1307389433445068800 2020-09-20 02:41:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Actually making this pic my banner pic.  So I’ll be reminded everyday about what Democrats will do to good people and why they can’t be given any quarter.
1307388510131884033 2020-09-20 02:38:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously expand the picture. Make it bigger.  Look at the faces of those 3 women.  Look at the pain.  @KamalaHarris was behind that.  No concessions.
1307388103557079049 2020-09-20 02:36:28 +0800 <just_mindy> They ran his reputation through the mud in front of his mother, a noted jurist herself.  Look at her face.  No concessions.  #War.
1307387637393698818 2020-09-20 02:34:37 +0800 <just_mindy> If you’re a Republican losing your will to stand up against Democrats, don’t forget what they did to Kav and what the women who love him had to bear.  https://t.co/fTXltYCXhQ
1307386453509496838 2020-09-20 02:29:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Rubio and Scott will both support Trump.  Florida is Trumpy and it’s political suicide to not support him.
1307386102324637698 2020-09-20 02:28:31 +0800 <just_mindy> They’ve already threatened that.  That’s why we need Trump to win again &amp; hold the Senate
1307385457106391040 2020-09-20 02:25:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all showed your ass with Kav.  Now we are about to show our much more attractive asses.

1307363243573284865 2020-09-20 00:57:41 +0800 <just_mindy> If it’s Barrett, they are already calling her a cultist
1307360443669909517 2020-09-20 00:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s literally untrue but go off
1307360273670590467 2020-09-20 00:45:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Next she will tell me about how school choice is segregationist policy
1307359741748883456 2020-09-20 00:43:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine She apparently thinks I’m unable to read and that’s literally what I do for a living so....
1307357175967289344 2020-09-20 00:33:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, if you’re an “expert”, you know good and well Biden isn’t up to this job, will be replaced with Kamala and the hard left wing will dominate.  So yeah, you’re exactly like AOC and apparently, as dumb.
1307356767018463233 2020-09-20 00:31:57 +0800 <just_mindy> You’re trying to vote out all conservatives and replace them with leftists.  You’ve been on the side of AOC.

1307317224655458304 2020-09-19 21:54:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Either Biden camp has terrible internals and they know this is a lost cause, or fantastic internals &amp; they think they don’t have to work for it, or he is literally so feeble he needs days off to rest.

1307138121641979908 2020-09-19 10:03:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @TweekKC I didn’t but it’s clear he isn’t up to this job
1307137943295987712 2020-09-19 10:02:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Point of clarity:  Jesus did not see women as second class citizens, and in fact some of his closest friends and confidants were women.  He exhorted men to love women perfectly as Christ loves the church so a “Jesus Freak” would never subjugate women.
1307137057307983872 2020-09-19 09:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 Yes!! Y’all too!
1307135956508708865 2020-09-19 09:54:32 +0800 <just_mindy> We’re different in Fl. We live with mosquitoes, alligators, snakes and flying cockroaches on the surface of the sun in a swamp.  We are not the same.  ❤️
1307135129224130561 2020-09-19 09:51:14 +0800 <just_mindy> We did.  Trump and the current Senate.

1307129819629580290 2020-09-19 09:30:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Evidently Trump has had a Xanax
1307129678600306696 2020-09-19 09:29:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I need a Xanax
1307129115447889927 2020-09-19 09:27:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler Amen
1307129024100159490 2020-09-19 09:26:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  Now go speak to your handlers and don’t say anything else
1307128116511469569 2020-09-19 09:23:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @JHarper28317302 Ha! Very true!

1307127140937355266 2020-09-19 09:19:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Me too!! Defended the guy.  He is a total rino
1307126827106873344 2020-09-19 09:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Well, that’s balanced and sane
1307126652389003265 2020-09-19 09:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay When you’re a Mormon, I expect you to defend the unborn.  Why is this hard?
1307125475639201792 2020-09-19 09:12:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @UriBlago Fair point

1307124598081835009 2020-09-19 09:09:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I kind of feel like this is an “interrupt the President” kind of moment
1307124333672837120 2020-09-19 09:08:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @JDandTurkelton I thinks it’s Barrett for sure
1307124244657119233 2020-09-19 09:07:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I hope so
1307123582301077505 2020-09-19 09:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also not convinced but think Mitch will do his darndest
1307123342739148802 2020-09-19 09:04:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist Exactly
1307123279904362496 2020-09-19 09:04:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I agree.  But it won’t be for lack of trying
1307123115487621129 2020-09-19 09:03:30 +0800 <just_mindy> The Right to Life and stopping violence to the pre-born in the womb is too important.  This is a moment we cannot let pass.
1307122522358456325 2020-09-19 09:01:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy If the Senate and the President were held by different parties
1307122370575036417 2020-09-19 09:00:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist It’s like the poem on the Statue of Liberty and stuff
1307121162930057219 2020-09-19 08:55:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Anyone who thought Mitch would change is mind, hasn’t spent much time around a Kentucky man.  I was raised by one, and trust me, they don’t budge.  A Florida man has nothing on a Kentucky man with his mind made up and score to settle
1307120085987921920 2020-09-19 08:51:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 @BenSisko197 At least
1307120068241887234 2020-09-19 08:51:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 @BenSisko197 Oh there’s enough time.  Trump has until January
1307119545493184512 2020-09-19 08:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield Absolutely.  Period.
1307117915288854528 2020-09-19 08:42:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenSisko197 Not sure about him or Jones.   He knows he’s going to lose in Alabama so he probably won’t cave
1307117748154228736 2020-09-19 08:42:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @e2pilot Collins and Murk have already said tonight they won’t confirm
1307117573461471238 2020-09-19 08:41:29 +0800 <just_mindy> 100% yes
1307117479014133760 2020-09-19 08:41:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenSisko197 Very likely
1307117419199115265 2020-09-19 08:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna Every time
1307117093461078017 2020-09-19 08:39:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Yep!
1307117022153773056 2020-09-19 08:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Exactly!
1307116867023233030 2020-09-19 08:38:40 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying
1307116365568933888 2020-09-19 08:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoePCunningham Me too
1307116200330231809 2020-09-19 08:36:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Does Trump know yet

1307113189952417792 2020-09-19 08:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> This is a very important point I hadn’t thought of

1307111639460777985 2020-09-19 08:17:54 +0800 <just_mindy> 70% of this country is not for unfettered, up to the time of delivery abortion/infanticide so stop.

1307098053468401664 2020-09-19 07:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Closing the Border, stopping evictions, manufacturing PPD &amp; ventilators, shutting down our economy, sending stimulus checks, ramping up testing within weeks, sending military hospital ships.  Yep, nothing at all.  🤡
1307097403162492929 2020-09-19 07:21:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @LynnWilson111 @bigmike5143 @SwattyKay @Lsubet @CalebJHull And your side called him a Xenophobe and a racist.  The only travelers he allowed were American Ex pats and they had to quarantine
1307096585562660869 2020-09-19 07:18:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @jcharping71 That is annoying. I totally get it

1307059303120097282 2020-09-19 04:49:56 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to launch one for the CVS employee berated by that awful woman.
1307053830308270086 2020-09-19 04:28:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Really shocked his attorneys hasn’t been able to get a judge to issue a gag order

1307040448062599170 2020-09-19 03:35:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Wilson RT’ing Act Blue for donations to turn Georgia Blue is just Lol to me. I swear he better not ever work in conservative politics again.
1307040143266770945 2020-09-19 03:33:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria She wasn’t but she certainly isn’t an extreme conservative imo
1307039266267160585 2020-09-19 03:30:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler Exactly!!  She called him a fantastic retail politician but EXTREME
1307038577440808961 2020-09-19 03:27:35 +0800 <just_mindy> She loathes Trump, won’t vote for him but even that is “too extreme” for these people.  They’re insane.
1307038241615417345 2020-09-19 03:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. This is why I don’t begrudge failed marriage . People say “you would have had kids with other people too.  You didn’t have to walk through that hurt”.  True, but it wouldn’t be these kids, my 2 kids are perfect for me and they needed their Dad’s DNA too.
1307036909496082437 2020-09-19 03:20:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @MeghanMcCain You look great!!  My face was a puffy mess at this point!!

1306717844521054208 2020-09-18 06:13:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Generally, I’ve found the best policy to end infanticide is to stop murdering babies.

1306700498263736322 2020-09-18 05:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> The 1619 project is riddled with historical inaccuracies as any noted historian will attest.  This has been opined on at length.
1306697822935363584 2020-09-18 04:53:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @MomTo6Lambs Me too

1306695936505253890 2020-09-18 04:46:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden has no higher gear.  He’s an elderly man who should be enjoying his twilight years with his family.

1306386734092034050 2020-09-17 08:17:23 +0800 <just_mindy> There were three cars and the second one didn’t have any signs?
1306385410835263489 2020-09-17 08:12:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Word
1306382995960586240 2020-09-17 08:02:32 +0800 <just_mindy> So, like your “investigative reporting” on the 2 BLM lawyer arsonists wasn’t at all agenda driven or told from a sympathetic viewpoint, right?
1306382350713073664 2020-09-17 07:59:58 +0800 <just_mindy> When they take over police precincts and city hall, what else would one call if?
1306380401804541952 2020-09-17 07:52:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @RosieGray @rubycramer @AlbertSamaha This part was particularly deep divey.  They were trying to hand out Molotov cocktails to others and had a car full of supplies to make more.  https://t.co/HOpHpReESt

1306324927243575297 2020-09-17 04:11:47 +0800 <just_mindy> 😂😂🤣
1306324155994910720 2020-09-17 04:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep and mostly #1
1306319429547032576 2020-09-17 03:49:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 No she thinks because one of them went to the same school as her and likely runs in similar circles, they aren’t baddies
1306315496741101568 2020-09-17 03:34:19 +0800 <just_mindy> This tweet is getting ratio’d into oblivion and it deserves it.
1306314470180958222 2020-09-17 03:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba @Twitter @TwitterSupport @TheDemocrats Yep!  She’s a Ed.D and should specify
1306313575980560386 2020-09-17 03:26:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 It’s true
1306310842615566337 2020-09-17 03:15:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Because we beat you and are now more powerful than you and your prince couldn’t find one English woman to marry but snatched up a B-list actress simply because even mediocre Americans are better than superior Brits.
1306309426442366977 2020-09-17 03:10:11 +0800 <just_mindy> I have never felt so seen.     https://t.co/TgQ5E9o9aW

1306308321935327233 2020-09-17 03:05:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Yep
1306306095216902144 2020-09-17 02:56:57 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying  https://t.co/rMBeFw5MYK
1306303496728260609 2020-09-17 02:46:38 +0800 <just_mindy> One last note: this couple had additional supplies in their car to make additional explosives.  They just got caught before they had the chance.  They had a can of gas, bro.  This wasn’t a spur of the moment, let’s just burn this one cop car, deal.
1306302489269018626 2020-09-17 02:42:38 +0800 <just_mindy> One thing objectively wrong w/ this article is public schools have NOT been underfunded in the US.  The funding has increased exponentially.  Also, both ppl in this article thrived because of acceptance into schools of choice. They got out of bad government schools.
1306299086296018950 2020-09-17 02:29:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @KayFellowz You’re welcome!! 😍😍
1306298985724940288 2020-09-17 02:28:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @hyundai_geoff @jjmiphoto @rubycramer @AlbertSamaha As attorneys, I feel they were aware of the time they could serve and they made a decision
1306298714307399680 2020-09-17 02:27:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  They aren’t 16 year olds
1306298296332320772 2020-09-17 02:25:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Lots and lots and lots of people in prison have terribly sad back stories and families that adore them, but justice is to be blind to all of that.
1306297870597984256 2020-09-17 02:24:16 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s nice. Being children of immigrants somehow makes you immune to consequences? If you have lots of friends, you can torch government property? If you hate the country that provided you an elite education, you get to act with impunity?  This is nonsense.
1306297248909852672 2020-09-17 02:21:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Is Hunter Biden phone banking?
1306296136043581441 2020-09-17 02:17:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow I don’t think he knows he’s in it
1306294875474874368 2020-09-17 02:12:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Clearly
1306294455193006080 2020-09-17 02:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> If Twitter knows this is false, then they should tell the rest of us how it got started. Otherwise, how is it fair to suspend her for positing on origin?

1306293752760336388 2020-09-17 02:07:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously @Twitter @TwitterSupport should label this.  She is clearly making a false statement and then the @TheDemocrats are calling her Dr. Jill Biden in order to lend credence.  She isn’t a medical doctor and it should be noted
1306292970782588928 2020-09-17 02:04:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Right?!
1306292926289530882 2020-09-17 02:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Exactly
1306292632449150978 2020-09-17 02:03:27 +0800 <just_mindy> When she is dispensing something that sounds like medical advice, she shouldn’t be labeled “Dr.” or it should be noted she is an Ed.d
1306290456083468289 2020-09-17 01:54:49 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s not a spokesperson for CNN but commented only on Trump &amp; Fox &amp; not the Cuomo Bro Variety Show or Tapper? Strange, that.

1306287448994058240 2020-09-17 01:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> And another beautiful family
1306287409433382914 2020-09-17 01:42:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Beautiful family
1306287087898038272 2020-09-17 01:41:26 +0800 <just_mindy> As was your Mom
1306286740416671754 2020-09-17 01:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> In response, you and your friends should have no kids.  It will even out.

1306240689617997824 2020-09-16 22:37:03 +0800 <just_mindy> One thing Trump learned is the Media is never going to be fair, so you have to troll better than them.  For better or for worse, that’s where we are.

1305966212782923776 2020-09-16 04:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AtteesDad You should send Trump a thank you letter for protecting your country allowing y’all the luxury of having a silly PM no one cares about
1305949035321327622 2020-09-16 03:18:08 +0800 <just_mindy> The Canadians are opining about American politics again.  I wish they cared this much about PM Blackface.

1305730310433378304 2020-09-15 12:48:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax I’m glad she hears that from you all the time!! Girls need to hear about their exceptional qualities from their Dad, as you know.  As a grown woman, my most vivid memories are my Dad pointing out those things to me.
1305729849986871297 2020-09-15 12:47:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @TCC_Grouchy Be safe!!!
1305729220094689280 2020-09-15 12:44:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax That’s awesome!!!
1305727664364433409 2020-09-15 12:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, apparently if you believe parents should be able to choose the best educational setting for their child and tax dollars should follow the student, you want segregated schools.  Riddle me that one.
1305726282831925248 2020-09-15 12:32:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 That’s awesome and such a blast!!!
1305724413854314496 2020-09-15 12:25:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Yes!!!!
1305723690915704835 2020-09-15 12:22:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 It’s so good to find like minded people lol
1305722937354391554 2020-09-15 12:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> So the technical next line is “why do you roll smoke”, but if you’re country country, you know you scream, “to get drunk” first.  Saw someone having this debate on Tik Tok and had to settle it here.
1305722471337857024 2020-09-15 12:17:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Well yes
1305722385916727297 2020-09-15 12:17:30 +0800 <just_mindy> There we go!  Yes, the next line is “why do you roll smoke” BUT before that, you always insert “to get drunk”
1305722125966336000 2020-09-15 12:16:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins Yes. That is one of 2 correct responses
1305721569419952128 2020-09-15 12:14:15 +0800 <just_mindy> If I say “Hank, why do you drink”, what do you say next?
1305667630947282944 2020-09-15 08:39:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @OSUCRs Yes definitely
1305665719753936896 2020-09-15 08:32:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Ha!
1305665230060564487 2020-09-15 08:30:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @DarthMother64 @shnikies78 That was a good one!
1305665161144020993 2020-09-15 08:30:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @KarstenKinstler So many Ross Perot!
1305665064805031936 2020-09-15 08:29:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @shnikies78 That was my first election I was hype to vote in.  Even had my “Divas for Dubya” shirt on!
1305664872940797957 2020-09-15 08:28:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod My parents made me vote.  Dole still lost
1305664768280334338 2020-09-15 08:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 We cancelled each other out

1305643745023610881 2020-09-15 07:05:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Very true
1305633439815798784 2020-09-15 06:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @MyBamaBelle528 Exactly
1305632340329332737 2020-09-15 06:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Flaaaaalala @MushKat Yes.  He thinks it is a dark humor.  He’s wrong
1305632261233152001 2020-09-15 06:19:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 Very gross
1305632203548831745 2020-09-15 06:19:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan Oh I didn’t!!! Going to now!!
1305631593936105480 2020-09-15 06:16:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Flaaaaalala Dude is sick
1305630751891881990 2020-09-15 06:13:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray Yes
1305630617003008000 2020-09-15 06:12:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Nope. It’s an actual thing he finds funny
1305628976115855360 2020-09-15 06:06:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Child rape is so funny you guys
1305628526155096064 2020-09-15 06:04:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jose_Galvan This is crazy!!!
1305619014526341121 2020-09-15 05:26:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobBobs35636345 @TarheelKrystle Personal choices end when it effects the life or death of another person
1305610904596287488 2020-09-15 04:54:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m I mean, have we seen him lately?!
1305606890236317699 2020-09-15 04:38:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh for sure!!  It’s gotten progressively worse
1305605985025822720 2020-09-15 04:34:58 +0800 <just_mindy> We love a firefighter!!!
1305603721632649216 2020-09-15 04:25:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump has been President for 4 years and literally Gina’s life isn’t different but he’s definitely going to be a dictator this next 4 years
1305602939701075970 2020-09-15 04:22:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Of course it doesn’t.  I’m sure she expected a level of fidelity
1305602598754488320 2020-09-15 04:21:31 +0800 <just_mindy> The Democrats couldn’t accept this win and they have been divisive from LITRALLY the minute he was inaugurated.  Starting with the Women’s March and never stopped
1305602084155330562 2020-09-15 04:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Then Biden should be happy to agree to this debate
1305601848041234433 2020-09-15 04:18:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah Trump really fears a camera and unfettered time to talk 😩
1305601637134872581 2020-09-15 04:17:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I also want this
1305600344332873735 2020-09-15 04:12:33 +0800 <just_mindy> This thread
1305599159756632064 2020-09-15 04:07:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gator_Country @TheAmishDude Oh it is. Apparently he’s going to try and challenge Rubio for Senate
1305595546414059526 2020-09-15 03:53:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Right.  It’s fine that they agreed on a certain kind of marriage.  I’m sure she didn’t agree to having it exposed after a meth addled night with a prostitute
1305592442813665280 2020-09-15 03:41:09 +0800 <just_mindy> I can’t stand Andrew Gillum and his divisive politics but this is really awful for his wife

1305538433474015235 2020-09-15 00:06:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlaMarco20 @HotepDadMax I also have this concern as my son is a firefighter and I fear sometimes a woman might not be able to save him if something went wrong.  There is a woman at his station that he knows could do it.  So, like you said, case by case.
1305537652041691141 2020-09-15 00:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax @UncleHotep There is no doubt a woman who is a Mother will fight like hell to see her child again
1305534289006800897 2020-09-14 23:50:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @GovRonDeSantis @Randy_Shannon Thank you Governor DeSantis!!

1305334995582701569 2020-09-14 10:38:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Either way, we shouldn’t comply

1305309884079104002 2020-09-14 08:58:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I never block, just mute, but I made an exception. Go be dumb elsewhere.
1305309672245780480 2020-09-14 08:57:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Like I don’t care if people don’t see the resemblance.  That’s fine.  That’s an opinion.  I get some people really like her and might find my opinions strident so they don’t want her compared to me.  Also fine, but why get your panties in such a wad?
1305309297023356928 2020-09-14 08:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Last night someone commented I looked like Candace Cameron Bure &amp; I said “so funny because my boyfriend thinks so too and now I feel the need to defend her”.

1305299099856637955 2020-09-14 08:15:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy There is no common ground left imo
1305298981052993536 2020-09-14 08:15:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @Randy_Shannon The one lady who tried to creep forward yesterday had her tires slashed.  The only option is go quick
1305297934599303169 2020-09-14 08:10:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Anyone else ready for that national divorce?

1305281350933581824 2020-09-14 07:04:59 +0800 <just_mindy> We have 2 friends who are LEO (one still working and one Ret). One encouraged his son to be a firefighter and the other to go into business world.  Said no way they’d want their sons being officers now.

1305253995045359617 2020-09-14 05:16:17 +0800 <just_mindy> All these NFL players staying in locker rooms look real ugly &amp; petty with 2 officers fighting for their lives in LA rn btw
1305253290045779968 2020-09-14 05:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Probably so but I don’t disrespect my country

1305239582389174274 2020-09-14 04:19:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear I definitely understand the cynical angle.  I have to fight it because I know that’s not reality.
1305238487906607112 2020-09-14 04:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear For women who have their own money, we aren’t looking for what a man can do to enrich us.  We are looking for a companion.  Someone to connect with emotionally, spiritually and that enjoys our company.  It’s a different dynamic.
1305236103998443520 2020-09-14 04:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 It’s true.  I’m not even trying to front

1305232386268033026 2020-09-14 03:50:25 +0800 <just_mindy> This should be good
1305200140559486977 2020-09-14 01:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @shnikies78 @MiamiDolphins Stayed in the locker room for the anthem.  The pats came out and no one kneeled
1305199618511253504 2020-09-14 01:40:13 +0800 <just_mindy> When they find the perpetrator, Kamala will go meet with his family and say how incredible they are.

1305176400605917184 2020-09-14 00:07:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I honestly cannot imagine any First Responder or anyone who loves one, voting for Biden at this point. Biden/Harris are totally committed to propping up organizations that seek to make their work more dangerous.  Period. #BackTheBlue #BackTheRed

1305174406600196098 2020-09-14 00:00:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @clairmarie @JCinQC Oh yes
1305172813951782912 2020-09-13 23:53:42 +0800 <just_mindy> A gentle reminder, public schools have been bad for 68 years and throwing more money at them hasn’t fixed anything.  Also a reminder, parents know what is best fit &amp; placement for their child. Trust parents.
1305170260635660292 2020-09-13 23:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @OneFineJay Lumberjack son would approve
1305167034318229505 2020-09-13 23:30:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Particularly if you live in Florida
1305166311702646787 2020-09-13 23:27:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Oh yes
1305166255133949958 2020-09-13 23:27:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Does Lincoln Project have an ad out yet praising the protestors calling cops “pigs” and screaming for their death?
1305165955539120129 2020-09-13 23:26:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala, however, will be meeting with the perpetrator’s family as soon as we know who he is, for a special screening of Cuties.
1305165172688982017 2020-09-13 23:23:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk He wants to prove how bad he hates Trump
1305165043529584642 2020-09-13 23:22:49 +0800 <just_mindy> There have been a total of 771 ppl killed by police this year.  164 of them were Black.  607 of them were white or Hispanic or Pacific Islander.  But go off.
1305163820801945600 2020-09-13 23:17:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @nukechaser @KatMcKinley Very true!!
1305162542134722561 2020-09-13 23:12:53 +0800 <just_mindy> I love when these guys come out all guns blazing “you didn’t get the art, man”, like that somehow makes an 11 year old dry humping the ground ok.

1305159443752136704 2020-09-13 23:00:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta @AnthonyAbides Exactly.
1305159334326931458 2020-09-13 23:00:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Ha!! Yes!
1305121645959557121 2020-09-13 20:30:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Listen to this priest discuss the behavior of protestors last night
1305121202961354752 2020-09-13 20:28:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig @tbrusletten Perfect
1305121126289477633 2020-09-13 20:28:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @tbrusletten @RandomWhig Exactly!
1305120633865539585 2020-09-13 20:26:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig @tbrusletten Exactly.  Certainly don’t want to be in the other camp
1305119979084406784 2020-09-13 20:23:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @kc2fargo @smittie61984 As they already are
1305119911388340225 2020-09-13 20:23:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @tbrusletten @RandomWhig It’s crazy how fast 💨 one becomes a Q.
1305117716462829570 2020-09-13 20:14:46 +0800 <just_mindy> apparently protecting children from sexual abuse is only a Qanon position now so I guess I’m Qanon.  Who knew?
1305115927856459777 2020-09-13 20:07:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @America71005572 Nope.  He’s a man.  He works full time, saves people’s lives and property, and if he was exposed to COVID somewhere and had to quarantine, I would expect someone to provide him food.  That’s sort of a basic human need
1305115289378586624 2020-09-13 20:05:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @America71005572 I don’t know how he got it which is why I said “if accurate”. Where I live in Fl, we teach ppl to read.  My son did go to school to be an EMT &amp; he went to Fire Academy. That kid is paying hefty tuition to that Uni. They have a responsibility to students they force to quarantine
1305113918990438400 2020-09-13 19:59:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @RoodGridance @smitty_one_each 😊
1305111982094405632 2020-09-13 19:51:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaKruta Yep, exactly
1305111723817537537 2020-09-13 19:50:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @America71005572 You have no idea how he got it, where his Mom is, or anything else abt him.  If they were sent straight to quarantine &amp; they aren’t allowed to leave, the Uni has responsibility to students. My son is 20 and already a full time FF/EMT &amp; has been since age 19 so I raise men. Thx!
1305110833232519168 2020-09-13 19:47:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy That’s awesome!!
1305109516246298624 2020-09-13 19:42:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta @AnthonyAbides The area around the “bubble hotels” is Lake Buena Vista and it is open to the public.  That’s where Disney Springs is located and where people can go shop and eat at Rainforest Cafe and such.  No ticket needed in those areas.  They blocked one of the roads there.
1305107654747058180 2020-09-13 19:34:47 +0800 <just_mindy> If Donald Trump tweeted this morning “Cuties is a masterpiece in modern cinema..a must watch”, Netflix would remove it by noon today.

1304632027245948934 2020-09-12 12:04:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Felonies aren’t unpaid parking tickets.  These were felons.  They often have restitution to pay to victims.

1304628399747543040 2020-09-12 11:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe It’s so annoying.  The time in jail isn’t “fulfilling the sentence”.
1304627467290841089 2020-09-12 11:46:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @FilthyFireman I’m so glad you’re day was so good too!!
1304627327100477441 2020-09-12 11:46:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Once again, many of these “fines” are restitution to victims or payments into the violent crimes victim fund.  This was part of the sentence from the beginning.  Victims deserve to be made somewhat whole.  Incarceration isn’t the totality of a sentence.  Stop lying.
1304626785515175938 2020-09-12 11:43:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @FilthyFireman My son had one last week.  He said they all cheered when they got her back. ❤️

1304502515824812034 2020-09-12 03:30:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @eddgimenez They voted felons can vote when complete with sentence.  Restitution is part of the sentence as well as fines
1304501484869038081 2020-09-12 03:26:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve commented on this before but once again, some of these fines are owed as victim restitution and no, your sentence isn’t complete until you provide said restitution.  That’s part of the sentence.  A sentence isn’t just incarceration.

1304449112792850440 2020-09-11 23:57:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Vice President Pence is a very decent and good man and why when I sometimes struggle with Trump, I can overlook it because he’s next in line.

1304437599461875714 2020-09-11 23:12:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 It’s ridiculous
1304437164797763585 2020-09-11 23:10:30 +0800 <just_mindy> A police Officer and former Marine was shot in the face and killed last night in the line of duty.  His name was Ryan Hendrix and he was the father of a 6 and 9 year old.  Just awful.
1304434942689120256 2020-09-11 23:01:40 +0800 <just_mindy> And neither of those things have anything to do with Donald Trump.  All of those people have been killed in cities and states run by Democrats.  You’re mad at the wrong political party.  Also, you teach Math.  Do that.
1304434675725803522 2020-09-11 23:00:36 +0800 <just_mindy> You have made it political by indicating Trump is somehow responsible for either of those things

1304432794265948160 2020-09-11 22:53:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @DenverLarry7 Right?
1304432042965381123 2020-09-11 22:50:08 +0800 <just_mindy> So why are you discussing your political opinions at all?

1304423829532532743 2020-09-11 22:17:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Then guy should support Trump because he’s trying to stop the wars
1304423689744797697 2020-09-11 22:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Done nothing? Schools were out for 8 months, business closed and many failed, people stayed in their homes for months, people didn’t have weddings, funerals, surgical procedures for months.  GTFOH
1304423175640547328 2020-09-11 22:14:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Don’t try to act like your side supports cops or Fire Rescue today.  Spare me.
1304422819401523205 2020-09-11 22:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Like is this really the day for this? Really? George has 364 other days of the year to be a grifting scum ball riding his wife’s success.  The devil works hard, but damn if George Conway doesn’t work harder.

The left are very sane &amp; not disconnected fr reality.

1303400040061427713 2020-09-09 02:29:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I was only called annoyingly ignorant. Yours is way more impressive
1303399676532711424 2020-09-09 02:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> The majority of corporate tax scholarships are used by minority students and many of them are in Miami Dade &amp; Broward.  Those parents aren’t going to give up the schools their child loves.  Period.
1303398769732575234 2020-09-09 02:24:17 +0800 <just_mindy> SCHOOL CHOICE, SCHOOL CHOICE, Mindy sang at the top of her lungs.  Dems will never win Fl again until they agree to give space for School Choice.  But I’m a Republican, so carry on wayward Dems.

1303371615800045568 2020-09-09 00:36:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @stevetallent @MrMokelly Nah.  We don’t believe women making claims against Democrats.  Don’t be silly
1303371501396258817 2020-09-09 00:35:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrMokelly You didn’t support the “politicization”.  Lol. I don’t support the politicization of this case and cancelling his victim because Democrats want to turn him and his anti-Semitic father into heroes
1303369845585719296 2020-09-09 00:29:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrMokelly Ok #BelieveWomen lol

1303365611771383809 2020-09-09 00:12:31 +0800 <just_mindy> But #BelieveWomen or something.
1303365391167688711 2020-09-09 00:11:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @lexangeldad @megynkelly I hope he never regains mobility since rapists tend to reoffend
1303365269549711364 2020-09-09 00:11:10 +0800 <just_mindy> We can investigate police brutality while simultaneously acknowledging the victim.  Remember #BelieveWomen

1303335901901271041 2020-09-08 22:14:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @cardi_mark Yep!

1303334794814779392 2020-09-08 22:10:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @WolfOnEdge @Publix I’ll be eating a Pub Sub when the meteor hits

1303198388750618624 2020-09-08 13:08:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @HotepDadMax I was about to say.  With parents who named their kids Hennessey &amp; Bacardi, I don’t know that they grew up in a pew.
1303197938324246529 2020-09-08 13:06:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh oop!
1303197845059702784 2020-09-08 13:05:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Fair point
1303197778252791808 2020-09-08 13:05:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @SpartanLineage Good idea!
1303197684677959682 2020-09-08 13:05:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Girl. Clearly this was not a BBQ down south if that was a BBQ!
1303196651675422720 2020-09-08 13:01:08 +0800 <just_mindy> This isn’t praising Trump. This is called “praying over” Trump.  Any one who believes the presence of God brings wisdom, peace &amp; favor, should pray over their leaders any time they can.  This has nothing to do with the character of the leader but rather with the greatness of God
1303195125636640768 2020-09-08 12:55:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin Oh my goodness!!!  How terrifying!! So glad y’all are safe.

1303193899872260101 2020-09-08 12:50:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @debitking Right! You’re in a garden!
1303192855784157185 2020-09-08 12:46:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Also the irony that Kamala put low level drug offenders and the parents of kids who skipped school in jail, yet calls this family “incredible” is not lost on me.
1303192394725294081 2020-09-08 12:44:13 +0800 <just_mindy> He sitting in an overgrown dying yard with chairs meant for in the house and everyone looks stiff as boards.  There’s a random table no one could possibly reach.  How bizarre
1303192029711814657 2020-09-08 12:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Who is handling this campaign? Biden very well might win but the optics on this are horrific

1303089123494952961 2020-09-08 05:53:51 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean, when you overlook the anti-Semitism of the Dad, and the proclivity of the son to rape, they’re practically the Cleavers.

1302996688504840192 2020-09-07 23:46:33 +0800 <just_mindy> It is.  Same guy who also has to exhibit feats of strength like push ups and as @ProjectLincoln likes to remind us....riding his bicycle
1302996171384852481 2020-09-07 23:44:30 +0800 <just_mindy> It was at this moment, I realized Selena Gomez was my twin soul.

1302957741250674688 2020-09-07 21:11:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Just like to remind the hysterical left who besmirched Kavanaugh at every juncture, he wrote opinion on this case and forcefully and vociferously called out what he believes is racism.  Yep, Kav is just a pawn a terrible guy. 🙄
1302929219618566145 2020-09-07 19:18:27 +0800 <just_mindy> This is outrageous.
1302928882530684941 2020-09-07 19:17:07 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why people love Grady Judd.  He defends our rights to protect our homes,  but he has zero problems calling balls and strikes when he feels a suspect used unnecessary force and killed someone.  He doesn’t care about race &amp; he will give residents all the facts. The best.

1302770561744089088 2020-09-07 08:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Like if you don’t know how to cover your bra up, I can’t learn from you
1302769413679190016 2020-09-07 08:43:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 So often it’s my daughter and I out alone and I want something for then
1302769244669648896 2020-09-07 08:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 That’s awesome!!!   We were in one in July and we will do another in October
1302769031892606976 2020-09-07 08:41:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Even though you test my soul, and make yourself so hard to hold I'm going to make you understand i'm strong enough to be your man  My favorite Travis Tritt song    https://t.co/gyaVwbIYTy
1302766686127484929 2020-09-07 08:32:36 +0800 <just_mindy> More #TravisTritt    https://t.co/qrAs5eIONI
1302766411744522241 2020-09-07 08:31:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 My pants are usually tight or leggings.  That’s why that type worries me
1302765575660331009 2020-09-07 08:28:12 +0800 <just_mindy> In honor of @Travistritt trending (say that 3 times fast)let’s play some of my favs!   https://t.co/oeZQkpU3u5
1302764760493101061 2020-09-07 08:24:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes Travis Tritt is very scared of this man who never leaves his keyboard
1302763941618212864 2020-09-07 08:21:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaryFernandez @NiedsG I hate the bra one so this looked better
1302763851964977152 2020-09-07 08:21:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Yes!!! Like an ocean!
1302763760201981953 2020-09-07 08:20:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG I have to finish my CC but then I’ll look for one in earnest.  My dad finished his but he is retired military so he has fewer steps
1302763547143921664 2020-09-07 08:20:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy Yes, me too
1302763501736296448 2020-09-07 08:19:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @MoronPundit @NiedsG Absolutely!
1302763459222872064 2020-09-07 08:19:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Yes!! It looked really narrow!! That makes sense
1302763370643435523 2020-09-07 08:19:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It looks really nice.  I don’t like a bra holster. I’ve tried that
1302763236408922114 2020-09-07 08:18:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ @melifix Yep.  If the student wants to make a deal out of it and risk the aggravation
1302761826816491528 2020-09-07 08:13:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Dear Lord I didn’t know I could love @Travistritt more but I do today.  Also this is a pic with me and his very hot and sweet wife at a concert. It was outside and Florida so we were “sparkling” but she still looked amazing.  I looked like a troll but I still love this pic. ❤️  https://t.co/pLdGkE92JF
1302760606081134592 2020-09-07 08:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG I totally want!!
1302760565983662081 2020-09-07 08:08:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Yep!!!!  Huge difference!!
1302760503710810112 2020-09-07 08:08:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @LuluVol That is sweet sweet!
1302760448949972995 2020-09-07 08:07:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @bradcundiff @KatMcKinley @genethelawyer Yes!! Wouldn’t that be a great thing for them to research?  Instead of like 4th hand info word of mouth from former WH employees
1302759181150285830 2020-09-07 08:02:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait til the end. I want.  https://t.co/QfJpb7RxWt
1302758978892566528 2020-09-07 08:01:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Right?!
1302758869639323649 2020-09-07 08:01:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @bradcundiff @KatMcKinley @genethelawyer Seems coincidental
1302754185713254407 2020-09-07 07:42:56 +0800 <just_mindy> After seeing this video, I can see why boats sank at this parade.  That’s an incredible amount of boats in a small area and I’m sure the wake was massive.  Look at that line of boats.  https://t.co/7jJID6VDD7
1302753015330463744 2020-09-07 07:38:17 +0800 <just_mindy> One man’s “question of freedom” is another man’s infanticide.  Tomato tomahto I suppose 🙄 Sit down, Chad
1302751285691719680 2020-09-07 07:31:25 +0800 <just_mindy> This is true
1302751218364813312 2020-09-07 07:31:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix @Flaaaaalala Yes.  The ability to hear the other side is very one sided
1302750390266540033 2020-09-07 07:27:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Absolutely
1302750318145474567 2020-09-07 07:27:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @MJNDesigner @melifix Me too

1302749451971375105 2020-09-07 07:24:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @KPBeachGirl Yes!! I wouldn’t know otherwise
1302748527509020673 2020-09-07 07:20:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Flaaaaalala @melifix Yep.  It’s just gotten worse
1302748078114590723 2020-09-07 07:18:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 Yeah I don’t require tattoos lol
1302747615864532993 2020-09-07 07:16:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark It’s possible lol
1302747569135792128 2020-09-07 07:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix Yep!!! They don’t even try to hide it now
1302746813317951491 2020-09-07 07:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That’s how it should be.   As an Educator, I know for sure my students don’t have any idea what my politics are.  Other teachers don’t practice that kind of discretion which is why many of them don’t like having cameras in their classrooms now
1302746474464374784 2020-09-07 07:12:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Oh for sure!!  Like Trump is the new punk lol
1302744532778442754 2020-09-07 07:04:35 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughter and her friends can’t say what they believe politically in class.  They know they’ll be ridiculed &amp; it would be poorly received from their Instructors.  One side demands strict loyalty but it ain’t Trump’s side.
1302743376027160583 2020-09-07 06:59:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @notjustahooker He’s a fav

1302742080293396481 2020-09-07 06:54:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley @genethelawyer Tons of recovered missing kids recovered since Ghislane Maxwell was arrested.

1302737475539001346 2020-09-07 06:36:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer It is definitely an interesting angle
1302737393624154112 2020-09-07 06:36:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Willfully ignoring it
1302737334547419140 2020-09-07 06:35:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Right!
1302730489950855170 2020-09-07 06:08:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Amen
1302730430303678464 2020-09-07 06:08:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @BJLoVerde It makes me nuts
1302729298470678529 2020-09-07 06:04:02 +0800 <just_mindy> A lot of missing children being rescued lately
1302729032950255616 2020-09-07 06:02:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty This is such a thing I would do!! Lol
1302728453901475840 2020-09-07 06:00:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty They’re done lol
1302728279091224576 2020-09-07 05:59:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets This whole thing is absurd

1302726294636036096 2020-09-07 05:52:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh I thought a rapist said something
1302726025814646786 2020-09-07 05:51:02 +0800 <just_mindy> He’ll be traveling with the White Fragility lady any day now
1302725861993582592 2020-09-07 05:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @JesseKellyDC Thank you
1302725248748580866 2020-09-07 05:47:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I know some of y’all think it’s crass to describe his crimes, but to me, it’s necessary so this guy doesn’t become a sympathetic figure
1302724989414711298 2020-09-07 05:46:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Does this mean he is going to stop breaking into homes and putting his fingers in the vaginas of women whilst their children sleep next to them?  That would be an awesome change!
1302710671327539200 2020-09-07 04:50:01 +0800 <just_mindy> ❤️❤️❤️   https://t.co/nQQjFHsvqr
1302709868881735686 2020-09-07 04:46:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @WriteGrlProbs I was reminded of that after this song today!

1302640405138288642 2020-09-07 00:10:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Y’all, it’s a thing
1302640170634825740 2020-09-07 00:09:53 +0800 <just_mindy> See?
1302639680001843202 2020-09-07 00:07:56 +0800 <just_mindy> See!?  I told y’all Twitter is a dating app for wonks and smart people!
1302637644770410499 2020-09-06 23:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Reporters have a huge confirmation bias that skews one direction and they need to acknowledge it.
1302632440448638978 2020-09-06 23:39:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It’s reprehensible
1302632263381901312 2020-09-06 23:38:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Now it’s “women sit down and be quiet”
1302632097270595585 2020-09-06 23:37:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 Makes me furious
1302628100241600512 2020-09-06 23:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 And every media personality who continues to give him a platform is as well.  Investigate his shooting, absolutely.  We can hold police accountable.  But stop showing this man’s face and saying his name
1302627819311312898 2020-09-06 23:20:48 +0800 <just_mindy> and every time a man in Media tweets approvingly of this man, he is telling women like me, and Blake’s victims, our abuse doesn’t matter.  I’m sick to death of it.
1302627460182409218 2020-09-06 23:19:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, I don’t take advice on how to conduct myself from rapists or domestic abusers. Y’all can continue to elevate this man to deity,  but count me out.
1302584594097725441 2020-09-06 20:29:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Josh puts “dog dad” in his bio.  He lost all self respect years ago, apparently
1302583311986982913 2020-09-06 20:23:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod True.  I should probably clarify “some” Local media
1302579956338262016 2020-09-06 20:10:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Fascinating thread and once again, a reminder of why local media is so important and doing yeoman’s work, and shouldn’t be lumped in with national media.
1302446150478426114 2020-09-06 11:18:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Yes.  He got his first really good experience several weeks ago.  He did CPR on a woman for 20 minutes and got her back.  He said they all started cheering
1302444394474340352 2020-09-06 11:11:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF The last part is my son’s life lol

1302436547262918659 2020-09-06 10:40:45 +0800 <just_mindy> The other lesson here is not everyone is going to take the actions of these protestors without striking back

1302432590763261953 2020-09-06 10:25:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis Oh, girl.  I noticed
1302432529438461953 2020-09-06 10:24:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Did Next Generation have a permit to protest like the Trump rally?
1302432338866065408 2020-09-06 10:24:02 +0800 <just_mindy> He pulls his weapon only after like 5 BLM people jump the security guard and he does it to protect that man
1302432060062265349 2020-09-06 10:22:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Dominique came over to a permitted rally to start nonsense.  Period.
1302431831829217280 2020-09-06 10:22:01 +0800 <just_mindy> The video says differently.  Don’t start none, won’t be none
1302431250569932800 2020-09-06 10:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> The larger man tried to tell the smaller one to go on.  Little man was writing checks with his big mouth that his tiny behind couldn’t cash
1302429575784402950 2020-09-06 10:13:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle 🤣🤣
1302429461141434371 2020-09-06 10:12:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh yes!! He loves the Daytona meet every year.  He works 24 hours on and 48 off and it worked out perfectly for this weekend.  He was happy
1302428173527851009 2020-09-06 10:07:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest They are so silly

1302426050761236481 2020-09-06 09:59:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans are the ones who pay taxes that funds those rescue boats
1302424486092865536 2020-09-06 09:52:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron Yes.  School choice is a huge huge deal here and Dems refuse to support it
1302424364391051265 2020-09-06 09:52:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I get carded all the time at Publix but it’s because they have to. My son is a big guy (6’2” 250 lb) so people often think I’m his girlfriend and that makes him want to die
1302423915453710336 2020-09-06 09:50:33 +0800 <just_mindy> That’s a wakeboat and should never have swamped.  There is some operator error there.
1302422395261800449 2020-09-06 09:44:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcACaputo @GriffNicholas Awesome!!  My Dad has to start immunotherapy treatments for Non Hodgkins and I need lots of books to keep him busy while he takes the treatment.  He’ll love this!!
1302421051184500737 2020-09-06 09:39:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron Yep! I was shocked by that
1302420303558172673 2020-09-06 09:36:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron Yes sir.  That’s how we like it!
1302419699150577666 2020-09-06 09:33:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @CfMatzke @flinnie Yes!!! Lol
1302419649246699528 2020-09-06 09:33:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dondrew8 Actually Joe Biden being in charge scares me.
1302419456317165569 2020-09-06 09:32:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dondrew8 Why would I do that, Don?
1302419354236133376 2020-09-06 09:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dondrew8 If you’re an American citizen, he’s your President, too.

1302415494230798337 2020-09-06 09:17:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes it is.  My youngest is 14 so all mine are growing up.  My son has been the easiest to raise.  My girls 1 &amp; 4 are drama.  Girl 2 was pretty easy.
1302415095956484097 2020-09-06 09:15:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I don’t really watch TV unless it’s something on the DVR so not really
1302413606118723584 2020-09-06 09:09:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Ha!! I have 3 girls and my son.  He’s my bestie and will tell you he’s a Mama’s boy.  Lol

1302408744073129984 2020-09-06 08:50:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem Right.  Just a little nudge
1302406095118512133 2020-09-06 08:39:45 +0800 <just_mindy> He made sure to get a sliver of the new girl in the pic to make the old girl jealous when he posted.  Very subtle.  He learned from the best.

1302288331913474048 2020-09-06 00:51:48 +0800 <just_mindy> That looks like a peaceful protest to me
1302283626986561542 2020-09-06 00:33:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Try being a teacher and ever picking a name that wasn’t an awful student
1302221165264621569 2020-09-05 20:24:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock It’s enough
1302216605661908992 2020-09-05 20:06:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 Yessssss!
1302216490641436678 2020-09-05 20:06:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @BButch55 @NoahCRothman Yep!!! I was so so so in the reform camp and now I’m just “get this under control stat”
1302215221646438401 2020-09-05 20:01:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BoreGuru She’s so weird
1302214747920699392 2020-09-05 19:59:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanLtcR Any color works!
1302214189033889792 2020-09-05 19:57:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @BoreGuru Yes. Why my son has to shave before every shift!
1302213899962519552 2020-09-05 19:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> How is an alleged fashion icon always so gauche?
1302209660074762241 2020-09-05 19:39:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1302207437206937601 2020-09-05 19:30:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh she sounds perfect for NY and our friend Andy Cuo!
1302105511605739522 2020-09-05 12:45:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Yes
1302104911237316608 2020-09-05 12:42:57 +0800 <just_mindy> When my ex husband attempted suicide, the police saved his life &amp; had the authority to compel him to treatment he desperately needed.  So, no thank you on defunding police.
1302104199619108864 2020-09-05 12:40:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @fbeckwith @JerryDunleavy It was 😝
1302103250531909634 2020-09-05 12:36:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Bernie is an actual communist.  He should admire this in Trump
1302099714469486592 2020-09-05 12:22:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @fbeckwith @JerryDunleavy Oh damn
1302097159203033088 2020-09-05 12:12:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Exactly!!! That is a great point!
1302094355126247425 2020-09-05 12:01:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Yes. Children need to read and there will always be children who struggle to read so I have job security lol
1302094174368522240 2020-09-05 12:00:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy It’s so silly how people judge women based on decisions they make for seasons of their life
1302094040414982144 2020-09-05 11:59:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa I always through I would get my Doctorate but I just can’t get motivated now

1302093617390129152 2020-09-05 11:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude I just have zero propensity for Math.  I can teach a kid to read or diagnose a reading disorder but toast 7th grade math, I’m out
1302092775463292929 2020-09-05 11:54:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL I know.  I got mine in Ed so almost as bad lol
1302092613986770944 2020-09-05 11:54:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy I’m like, settle down.  I also have degrees, sweetie.  Lol
1302092467869802496 2020-09-05 11:53:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Ok but for real, that is impressive.   Mine is in Reading Disorders and I have mad respect for you
1302092288781365249 2020-09-05 11:52:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 They even took me to a hospital to give birth
1302091802225397760 2020-09-05 11:50:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I literally want to put “I have a M.Ed from the second largest Uni in the US so find a new insult”
1302091366768480256 2020-09-05 11:49:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @VadersDeLorean @psujenlynne Yes.  I just hate she didn’t get a chance to defeat the patriarchy tonight
1302091237596581888 2020-09-05 11:48:37 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s always hilarious to me when leftist women think they were the only ones who went to college and earned advanced degrees.  Yes, I churned butter and spun wool my whole life. Pappy said girls don’t need no learnin past grade 3. 😩😳🥺
1302090598854414337 2020-09-05 11:46:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @VadersDeLorean @psujenlynne @BKudron And is hysterical about Trump for no reason

And all these men you’re attempting to disparage. They’d all have my back 1000 times.  You have no idea what you saying. ✌🏼
1302089624328851456 2020-09-05 11:42:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @psujenlynne @BKudron @VadersDeLorean I’m a girl &amp; I also have lots of degrees, so I’ll say it for my boys.  You’re dumb. Trump isn’t a kleptocrat &amp; you’re not scared of him or you wouldn’t write stuff on the internet for fear his secret police would drag you out of your home. As a conservative, I hv way more to fear
1302089072836579330 2020-09-05 11:40:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @psujenlynne @VadersDeLorean I would have went with “oh, wow”
1302088351865024512 2020-09-05 11:37:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 They’re are a lot of people who still keep quiet but they tell people like me, political wonks, in the private messages
1302088047354413056 2020-09-05 11:35:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @itssteveyall Yes
1302088010687799296 2020-09-05 11:35:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Yes.  Totally agree
1302085581950853121 2020-09-05 11:26:08 +0800 <just_mindy> And yes most of my mom friends are normie Christians and it’s crazy seeing them wake up lol
1302085399087644673 2020-09-05 11:25:25 +0800 <just_mindy> There is a lot of truth to this.  All my essential oil Mom friends have been red pilled. We share memes on FB messenger. 🤪🤪🤪
1302083151829839872 2020-09-05 11:16:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m @Flaaaaalala It’s my brand now

1302079410389090305 2020-09-05 11:01:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Right there with you.  Trump could disavow SEC Football and Chick Fil A right now and who cares? I don’t want these people in charge.  No thank you!!
1302068161110511616 2020-09-05 10:16:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @kmwsoon @JDandTurkelton 😂😂😂
1302068122397167617 2020-09-05 10:16:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow Right?
1302064496853291009 2020-09-05 10:02:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @EIowaGuy True that
1302061563722051584 2020-09-05 09:50:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Sad, but what kids have to do to make it in academia rn  https://t.co/ijDCstMBte
1302060763906007040 2020-09-05 09:47:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @JDandTurkelton Mine was: might be mashed potatoes, butter or corn
1302060353010966530 2020-09-05 09:45:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently only single Moms who own hair salons in San Fran
1302060235054632964 2020-09-05 09:45:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Like how Pelosi is treating the single mom in Cali who has no money or resources to protect herself?
1302059904010784768 2020-09-05 09:44:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is also Southern Granny Tupperware
1302058967103930371 2020-09-05 09:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley It gets better
1302058019350556679 2020-09-05 09:36:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix @MollyRatty Yep.  Discussed w/ bf tonight.  I can totally see Trump saying he didn’t get why ppl serve.  He’s an ROI guy.  He saw the salary and probably was shocked how little they make.
1302054967130419200 2020-09-05 09:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @sleepdoctorjoe Awesome!!!!
1302050462057848832 2020-09-05 09:06:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe What’s a breast cupping among friends?
1302050205479641088 2020-09-05 09:05:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe He’s Jilly’s husband
1302049875513794562 2020-09-05 09:04:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe That paternity test should be a glaring reminder
1302049696375091201 2020-09-05 09:03:33 +0800 <just_mindy> You should probably delete this
1302049462437720067 2020-09-05 09:02:37 +0800 <just_mindy> And I know I’m a broken record but Biden literally ruined a man’s life claiming he killed Biden’s wife and child when the accident wasn’t his fault and he wasn’t drunk so yes, to all of this...also Biden doesn’t acknowledge his baby grandchild which is bizarre behavior
1302036428797423616 2020-09-05 08:10:49 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is at Daytona Truck Meet this weekend so y’all pray for the safety of all the kids there trying to salvage some fun out of 2020  https://t.co/GNXnJjrIpt
1302032411610488833 2020-09-05 07:54:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Like I don’t care but people aren’t social distancing and also many not wearing masks.  If this was a Fl beach, the noise on this bus would be astronomical
1302031359263858688 2020-09-05 07:50:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Irrelevant people don’t have that power Mikey.
1302027070923517952 2020-09-05 07:33:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you
1302026614402879494 2020-09-05 07:31:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 🙂😉😂
1302026186038669318 2020-09-05 07:30:07 +0800 <just_mindy> It wasn’t his uncle’s vehicle. The police later admitted gun residue from the back of a police vehicle could have accounted for it.  Witnesses recanted &amp; the gun was found in a gutter near the home of who they now believe the suspect really is.
1302025547703255046 2020-09-05 07:27:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @K54408422 Thank you!!!
1302024567624544256 2020-09-05 07:23:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley 😂😂
1302024267207512071 2020-09-05 07:22:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This is not even close to the truth.  There is little to no evidence
1302024038039064578 2020-09-05 07:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> In this case, it did
1302023502237700097 2020-09-05 07:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> It was one Prosecutor and I agree
1302023311669579784 2020-09-05 07:18:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!!!!! I’m so sad his Mom isn’t alive for this day. I’m convinced she orchestrated it all from Heaven!
1302022814304800768 2020-09-05 07:16:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy I like it
1302022442328743936 2020-09-05 07:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth It’s easy to be morally superior when you don’t have to get in the mud and defend North America
1302020735603531776 2020-09-05 07:08:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion That’s true.  They depend on us.  We don’t depend on them
1302020606666461184 2020-09-05 07:07:57 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my favorites of this Navy hero!  https://t.co/ZlsU2sze1L
1302020124740923394 2020-09-05 07:06:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Exactly
1302019744393039884 2020-09-05 07:04:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth They are way too opinionated about US politics
1302019472245567488 2020-09-05 07:03:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @it_is_me_GH True, but Canada is very close and we could decide we want to own it tomorrow
1302019344189272065 2020-09-05 07:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @JackO87790530 We love the rest tho!
1302019083114868736 2020-09-05 07:01:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @BECrusader86 Exactly!
1302018871742918661 2020-09-05 07:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Canadians are very mouthy for a country we allow to exist
1302018704700575750 2020-09-05 07:00:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like Canada
1302018384213749761 2020-09-05 06:59:07 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s right
1302018101903593474 2020-09-05 06:58:00 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/I9eM02W0lD
1302017227198267392 2020-09-05 06:54:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @FergusFSU Exactly right.
1302017136190201857 2020-09-05 06:54:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Yes!
1302015967212572677 2020-09-05 06:49:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Imagine how much differently that could be if he didn’t have records
1302015709464141827 2020-09-05 06:48:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Police are trying not to arrest people and it’s emboldening bad behavior which leads to escalation which leads to cops having to make lethal force decisions.   Shut it down early and right away.
1302015352612716546 2020-09-05 06:47:04 +0800 <just_mindy> As soon as these people get in officers faces and point their fingers and post up, they should go in handcuffs and in paddy wagons.  Shut this nonsense down.
1302013376030179328 2020-09-05 06:39:13 +0800 <just_mindy> This is kind of lengthy but really important.   If you have teens share it with them too.  It’s indicative of how media can shape a narrative.  Grab a drink and read it.  Good stuff I’ll use in my Author’s Bias lessons.

1301978449440112641 2020-09-05 04:20:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 That one cracked me up
1301978359061254146 2020-09-05 04:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I will say since a good portion of Democrats say soldiers are trained mercenaries &amp; child killers and colonizers &amp; should be tried for war crimes, this newfound concern they have for honoring the reputations of service members is slightly jolting tbh

1301940833764155394 2020-09-05 01:50:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I feel bad for him.  Not his handlers though
1301939544422481923 2020-09-05 01:45:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  People with eyeballs know Biden isn’t capable of kicking anyone’s ass physically or cognitively.  Can we just stop?
1301939273294282752 2020-09-05 01:44:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Biden is going to get COVID and not be able to debate
1301937894073012229 2020-09-05 01:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Watch this with the sound off and just watch Biden.  This is not a well man.

1301921249711529984 2020-09-05 00:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @magicalmomU7 Yes.  The highest of standards
1301916909043167234 2020-09-05 00:15:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally how my man starts his talks with God every night
1301916613457973251 2020-09-05 00:14:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It needed new guts!!
1301916443513102344 2020-09-05 00:14:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t have to pretend who I am on the internet because when you google my name, I have actual credentials.  Also, your neck gaiter while effectively hiding your double chin, does  nothing to combat COVID.
1301915843060813825 2020-09-05 00:11:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The Project Lincoln stans are in my menchies and now it smells like desperation and old IRS debt.
1301915602588663813 2020-09-05 00:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 🤣🤣
1301915487081816064 2020-09-05 00:10:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m assuming the point of releasing these bombastic claims is to change the minds of voters. So, put your money where your mouth is and go on record so the person you’re accusing can defend themselves
1301914957680910336 2020-09-05 00:08:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, like the way the salon owner in San Fran has been slandered by Pelosi? That’s the risk you take to be a brave American exposing corruption.  These big brave men afraid to go on record should get a lesson in courage from that single mom.
1301914472915836930 2020-09-05 00:06:13 +0800 <just_mindy> So now everyone are liars except the people who refuse to attach their names to their accusations.  Seems legit.
1301913771309441024 2020-09-05 00:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Throw up your degrees, my friend! Let’s see them! Show my how highly educated you are supporting a candidate with clear neurological concerns.
1301912704492412930 2020-09-04 23:59:11 +0800 <just_mindy> This is always a favorite retort when I know I’m more “educated” than the person lobbing the insult.
1301912152375267330 2020-09-04 23:57:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michael90921535 @johnnydestefano @dougstafford That’s precious. I don’t need to “look it up” because I heard their excuse about fear of “mean tweets” earlier. I suggest they should be as brave as the average American business owner who was willing to risk “hate” to expose a corrupt government official.  Why so cowardly?
1301909933441667074 2020-09-04 23:48:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michael90921535 @johnnydestefano @dougstafford If it’s true, why don’t the sources go on the record? They should be brave patriots like the salon owner who exposed Pelosi to the American ppl.  What do they have to fear?

1301901889710231552 2020-09-04 23:16:13 +0800 <just_mindy> If you think my timeline is sick, imagine being the man who loves me so much he can’t leave, so he’s forced to listen to me talk about Silento &amp; his butt all day long.  Imagine being that guy.  He’s still lucky af don’t get me wrong.
1301901295259877377 2020-09-04 23:13:51 +0800 <just_mindy> OnlyFans but it’s just me making Silento butthole jokes because I’m obsessed and can’t stop.
1301900709672222720 2020-09-04 23:11:31 +0800 <just_mindy> I don’t understand Silento being so upset about one woman because I’ve seen his booty hole, and he had a plan B.  Don’t let anybody get you upset enough to chase them with an ax when you have options, friend.

1301688178521313288 2020-09-04 09:07:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Yes he did.   Why did he bother tho? Doesn’t look like Portland cares
1301687400528314369 2020-09-04 09:03:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax That’s some bullshit
1301687238405873664 2020-09-04 09:03:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Not every business is a chain store. Some stores are family owned business supporting a whole lot of families and yeah, people will protect that
1301686897073414144 2020-09-04 09:01:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Why hasn’t this guy been arrested?

1301672504394764288 2020-09-04 08:04:43 +0800 <just_mindy> At this point, it doesn’t matter. I’m voting Repub straight ticket because they are least hostile to my religion (abortion, parochial school choice, &amp; gathering to worship) &amp; my lifestyle (2A, taxes, school choice). The characters don’t matter anymore.

1301664233072070656 2020-09-04 07:31:51 +0800 <just_mindy> They’ll win.  The state is wasting tax payer money trying to defend this case.  It’s been litigated all over the country already
1301661427300790279 2020-09-04 07:20:42 +0800 <just_mindy> One of the followers of that middle age guy who was making fun of women over 40 called me a “knock off Chrissy Tiegen” &amp; then another said I was “Wal-mart Chrissy Tiegen” and how did they know this is literally the worst insult to me. Because it is.

1301648720744906754 2020-09-04 06:30:13 +0800 <just_mindy> At this point, Jilly should run for President instead of him tbh
1301648328325820417 2020-09-04 06:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> He’s resilient alright.  Kept defying that domestic violence injunction.

1301621405281390592 2020-09-04 04:41:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @VictoriaCutfor1 Yes!!! It needs to be!
1301621165602017281 2020-09-04 04:40:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Silento is the “whip nae nae” song guy.  He was arrested today for stalking his gf.  But also today, a picture dropped of his massive booty hole (don’t look.  I did. I’m sick). So that’s why he is trending. I’m here to keep conservative twitter in the loop.
1301616324762890240 2020-09-04 04:21:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @VictoriaCutfor1 Yes.  One reason I couldn’t do it.  I am certified to do respite and do occasionally but I couldn’t long term
1301614141564686338 2020-09-04 04:12:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @VictoriaCutfor1 There seems there was this violent pendulum swing toward reunification in the last few years but it has way way over corrected.  There has to be a better way
1301612546747703300 2020-09-04 04:06:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @VictoriaCutfor1 She is my friend and has 2 sisters and yes, you are so right.  Her girls were reunified for about 6 weeks with bio dad before being brought back to her.  They were an absolute mess from those 6 weeks.
1301610467820023809 2020-09-04 03:58:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @muffnbear Wow!  Even that is too long!! You’re right!

1301606296886665216 2020-09-04 03:41:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Yes and unfortunately these babies are invisible to most people.

1301605415445241858 2020-09-04 03:38:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Yes!!!  I’m desperate for legislators to do something and it needs to be nationwide. Too many children falling through the cracks

1301604825948454913 2020-09-04 03:35:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Yes it absolutely is and I can see that for year 1 or maybe 2.  After 4 years and many many missed visits, the goal should def shift
1301603982368964608 2020-09-04 03:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes!!! For these babies to be in this turmoil, going to weekly visits with bios, then bios don’t show for months, and then they start to show up again.  It’s outrageous

1301603488795971587 2020-09-04 03:30:29 +0800 <just_mindy> If I ever win the lottery, the first thing I will do is give her money to hire a team of lawyers to sue the state of Cali on behalf of her girls.

1301602706025574401 2020-09-04 03:27:22 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend in California has been fostering two sisters since they were 11 months and 2. They are now 5 &amp; 6 and there still is no permanency plan &amp; reunification is still the goal. This is a literal human right’s violation against children and it makes me rage.

1301565884683759616 2020-09-04 01:01:03 +0800 <just_mindy> There are a few people on here I would split acreage with.  It would be nice to be surrounded by some of y’all.  😘
1301565116995887105 2020-09-04 00:58:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna Girl.  I get it. I was just complaining about this same thing 2 weeks ago
1301563001615667200 2020-09-04 00:49:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna Yes.  It’s awful and I just need to get motivated and fix it

1301560405056196614 2020-09-04 00:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot I had my last at 30 and it is def differently
1301560299598864397 2020-09-04 00:38:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna I still have them regularly and awful. I need to get a hysterectomy. I definitely get feeling sad about that phase of life.  But I’m hoping for grandkids one day! Lol

1301558028513218560 2020-09-04 00:29:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrBadExample90 Proud granddaughter of a poor hillbilly Granny who was widowed at age 49 and decided to start a day care center that grew to a chain of them and paid for my college so I would “never have to depend on a man”
1301557685696036864 2020-09-04 00:28:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Yep! I was 29 and my ex husband was 49.  I’m mature so it wasn’t as bad but the age difference started becoming more of an issue when I was 45 and he was 65.  Different places in life
1301556638965534720 2020-09-04 00:24:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC I would sing about him, I’m so happy
1301556512016531458 2020-09-04 00:23:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m all for any group of families buying land together who share similarities and lifestyles.  Good for them!!
1301556173842403328 2020-09-04 00:22:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC The plumber saved the day

1301517785223307266 2020-09-03 21:49:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Smart guys on Twitter.  My kids bathroom toilet is making this super loud noise constantly and keeps flushing.  What is happening?  https://t.co/b89xVZd5vY
1301514536508428291 2020-09-03 21:37:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Also true
1301514462944538625 2020-09-03 21:36:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Exactly
1301512748195610626 2020-09-03 21:29:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally a scientific study concluded conservative women are more attractive than leftist women.  So, Fox anchors will trend more attractive. Also, conservatives are self-sufficient.  We can go to Sally’s and mix up some root touch up, Joe.
1301512276109864964 2020-09-03 21:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 Yes. They are all obsessed with the looks of the Fox anchors
1301511714324787200 2020-09-03 21:25:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Yep. Just making the hole deeper

1301510173459197955 2020-09-03 21:19:40 +0800 <just_mindy> It’s not illegal to have security cameras in a business and maybe Pelosi shouldn’t break the law  https://t.co/cY7vbPXwwX

1301509585690390528 2020-09-03 21:17:20 +0800 <just_mindy> I promise you your stylist likely has security cameras in the salon.  That’s not secretly filming.
1301509340541734913 2020-09-03 21:16:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Vindicated how? She broke the law and it matters not who the salon owner is.  She also didn’t wear a mask as she insist others do.

1301346869113769984 2020-09-03 10:30:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbieHitsBack Yes! He feels confident in them.  He’s lost about 40 pounds in 3 months so I’m concerned it has spread. We will know soon.  Praying for all of us. ❣️

1301345455687823360 2020-09-03 10:25:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Oh she definitely thinks that
1301345384112033793 2020-09-03 10:24:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer That power stance is less Wonder Woman and more Bratz doll

1301344919882215424 2020-09-03 10:23:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Why is AOC standing like a toddler when they’re tantruming tho?

1301343292441980934 2020-09-03 10:16:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWizardTower I’m the dumb dumb who tries to be nice.  You’d think I would learn
1301343094969896964 2020-09-03 10:15:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbieHitsBack I’m so glad you did.  I’ve decided you don’t get to get everything in life. I had the perfect childhood, great kids and a great job.  I didn’t get the good man card though.
1301342793701494790 2020-09-03 10:14:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell Yes.  I’m actually really good friends with his 3rd ex wife now.  She’s a great person.  His loss

1301342594971185152 2020-09-03 10:13:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 So annoying and then I get pissed at myself for trying to be human to him. I thought I would let him know my Dad’s diagnosis so he could emotionally support our son, but how silly of me
1301341665442041856 2020-09-03 10:10:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion And I’m sorry you have to deal with that
1301341537125761026 2020-09-03 10:09:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Well we’ve had our once per year nasty text tonight so at least I don’t have to hear from him again for a year
1301341115916980224 2020-09-03 10:07:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 Like just be nice bro.  We have a kid who’s 20!  Let’s move on
1301340745811591169 2020-09-03 10:06:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @dresman92 He never quit dating while we were married so I’m not sure he’s capable of those kinds of attachments

1301340358127898626 2020-09-03 10:04:53 +0800 <just_mindy> We have been divorced for 18 years, he’s had 3 additional wives, yet my ex husband cannot manage a text message with me that’s civil.  I will never understand.

1301292575366750208 2020-09-03 06:55:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Pelosi is third in line to be President of the most powerful nation in the world but can be “set” up by a hair stylist.   I bet Russia could eff her up.

No victim is saying it shouldn’t be investigated.  But raising inordinate amount of money &amp; signal boosting his name is beyond the pale.
1300750610518740998 2020-09-01 19:01:26 +0800 <just_mindy> After this thread last night, I got so many messages fr women telling me their stories.  Women who suffered far &amp; away more than I did. They’re livid. The @nfl &amp; @drewbrees have no idea what kind of whirlwind they are about to reap for elevating an abuser to celebrity status.
1300748656715411456 2020-09-01 18:53:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I chuckled
1300748612620648448 2020-09-01 18:53:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin @Neoavatara Exactly!!!
1300748078895566848 2020-09-01 18:51:23 +0800 <just_mindy> I do feel sorry for any pets or children in the building.
1300747829023997954 2020-09-01 18:50:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Good.  He hasn’t cared about citizens being terrorized.  Maybe he will start to care.
1300745485293170693 2020-09-01 18:41:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladoodles @jhaskinscabrera @NahasNewman @GovRonDeSantis @SWAtlasHoover Totally agree!!  It was brilliant and informative!
1300745204610334720 2020-09-01 18:39:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Nothing but respect for my Governor.  #neveragain
1300675094604283904 2020-09-01 14:01:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD She’s a hack
1300675016967757825 2020-09-01 14:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL Too many
1300674957916147718 2020-09-01 14:00:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m Yes!! His great grandma did too.  Which is why I am anxious to have him seen
1300674804278845440 2020-09-01 14:00:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Pomme143 Thank you!! Hoping it’s a nothing burger
1300674651190894592 2020-09-01 13:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @newspaperless @MaxNordau @Yamiche He was running away and they chased him.  How is that not retreating
1300674409506668544 2020-09-01 13:58:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Where’s the lie?
1300674219475439616 2020-09-01 13:57:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs Indeed!!
1300674018551398402 2020-09-01 13:57:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m Thank you.  95% of the time they are benign so we are hopeful
1300673897612877827 2020-09-01 13:56:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs Thank you.  We are hopeful it is nothing.
1300673140754874370 2020-09-01 13:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL Yep!!!  He never ever changes!!
1300673032818700292 2020-09-01 13:53:11 +0800 <just_mindy> My son has a nodule that is vascular on his thyroid found during his annual FF exam last week. There are zero endocrinologist in our area seeing patients in office to check my son. I’m taking him to our regular doc tomorrow hoping he can get the hospital to see him.
1300672129512419329 2020-09-01 13:49:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Our county schools in Florida has been open for a week already.  No turning back please
1300671853070036992 2020-09-01 13:48:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @JohnEkdahl How many people are killed by large pick up trucks though
1300671469530353667 2020-09-01 13:46:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL Yeah she’s probably over him by now
1300671395119214592 2020-09-01 13:46:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa @SusanCGivens1 His third wife and I are besties now!
1300669988060180481 2020-09-01 13:41:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa @SusanCGivens1 He is still living although on wife number 4 so he is her problem.  lol
1300669851367862272 2020-09-01 13:40:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichelleInCAL He’s on wife 4 now so thankfully someone else’s problem. But you’re the best!!
1300667586393276416 2020-09-01 13:31:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @TexBourbon Thank you.  God is good to me

1300667399126081536 2020-09-01 13:30:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Yep which is why my sympathy meter isn’t registering for this dude
1300667266460254208 2020-09-01 13:30:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 Totally agree
1300664380695212038 2020-09-01 13:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @reenie0999 That’s so very kind.  God is gracious
1300664137320718343 2020-09-01 13:17:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love Love you, girl!!
1300657637445468162 2020-09-01 12:52:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love Yes.  I’m glad we are thriving today
1300634017889497088 2020-09-01 11:18:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle @BygonesbeBygon7 That’s awesome
1300633958972035072 2020-09-01 11:17:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle @SusanCGivens1 Yes!!  You have to learn that it wasn’t your fault
1300633660232732674 2020-09-01 11:16:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @TexitDarling Thank you!!!
1300633550161612800 2020-09-01 11:16:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle @BygonesbeBygon7 I love hearing this!!!!!
1300631720853635072 2020-09-01 11:09:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas Yes and this story elevating this abuser to some kind of deity is making me nuts
1300631512711299072 2020-09-01 11:08:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @_wintergirl93 @jannyfayray @NFL @drewbrees @Vikings Exactly.  I’ll stick with college and hope they don’t go crazy
1300631324181639168 2020-09-01 11:07:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy I’m thankful for my peace now.  Also, thankful that 8 month old baby is now 20, 6’3 260 pound firefighter with an arsenal guns who lives in a house right behind me.  I feel very protected.
1300630734726717445 2020-09-01 11:05:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @_wintergirl93 @jannyfayray @NFL @drewbrees Yes!! He has way over corrected!!!
1300630415980597248 2020-09-01 11:03:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarkF50607392 @Godisgood1836 Thank you.  I’m thankful for a peaceful life now
1300630246820114433 2020-09-01 11:03:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @_wintergirl93 @NFL @drewbrees Yes.  He is trying to stay politically correct and making really bad decisions
1300628105279811586 2020-09-01 10:54:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @_wintergirl93 @jannyfayray @NFL Yes!! I’m so angry with particularly @drewbrees
1300627961331286023 2020-09-01 10:54:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Horrific.  This is what women endure
1300627662793322498 2020-09-01 10:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @GetOuttaHeah @TheH2 Absolutely
1300627590445707264 2020-09-01 10:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @gubmintworker @NFL I sure hope she does!
1300627488545148936 2020-09-01 10:52:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @_wintergirl93 @NFL Thank you Janice.  It makes my blood boil.
1300625048470990855 2020-09-01 10:42:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @princessmcleia @Neoavatara Thank you for sharing and I’m so sorry you know this pain.  So so very sorry
1300616751579881473 2020-09-01 10:09:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Pristinesara 💕💕💕
1300616623766863872 2020-09-01 10:09:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 Love you!
1300616357541601280 2020-09-01 10:07:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen @drewbrees &amp; @NFL
1300613129492201473 2020-09-01 09:55:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG @dbm_freedom I also have guns.  The stun gun is on my table and the real gun in my drawer
1300607574035890179 2020-09-01 09:33:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle @czechmate88 @RantyAmyCurtis Absolutely.  Knowing your child is there makes it so much more terrifying
1300607453852250112 2020-09-01 09:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberL_Evans @RantyAmyCurtis Praying for wisdom for both of y’all!!
1300607315725385728 2020-09-01 09:32:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @JHarper28317302 @RantyAmyCurtis Thank you
1300607233424752642 2020-09-01 09:31:43 +0800 <just_mindy> The @nfl @drewbrees are laughing in the face of domestic violence victims
1300606746449391617 2020-09-01 09:29:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Great news!
1300606261004820485 2020-09-01 09:27:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberL_Evans @RantyAmyCurtis Thank you for helping her and making her feel safe.
1300605404913774594 2020-09-01 09:24:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Don’t ever ever tell me the @TheDemocrats are the party of women. All the conservative men I know support women saying Jacob Blake deserves no praise for being a rapist.
1300604864083394560 2020-09-01 09:22:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG 💕❤️
1300604482775126017 2020-09-01 09:20:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Par for the course for the @nfl to elevate domestic abusers
1300604339237646338 2020-09-01 09:20:13 +0800 <just_mindy> And his wife should be ashamed
1300603941869301760 2020-09-01 09:18:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Every time
1300603906456682496 2020-09-01 09:18:30 +0800 <just_mindy> So many women with these stories.  The @NFL spits in all our faces
1300601653205307393 2020-09-01 09:09:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Me too, now plus a stun gun by my bed
1300599625569665025 2020-09-01 09:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @MadridFederer Thank you.  Lots of Granny’s prayers
1300599546205089792 2020-09-01 09:01:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 It’s outrageous.  If he was selling drugs or counterfeiting money, that’s one thing.  HE WAS RAPING A WOMAN
1300599160610205700 2020-09-01 08:59:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  No one is listening but I’m going to keep telling the gruesome details of Blake’s crime because I’m so tired of women being victimized
1300598897438527488 2020-09-01 08:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Alcohol and a bad temper don’t mix
1300598812839469057 2020-09-01 08:58:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @acena124 Yes, thankfully he was in his crib and not in the bed with me like this case
1300598695264571392 2020-09-01 08:57:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 It was almost 20 years ago now but man this has me riled
1300598565954293760 2020-09-01 08:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I’m so angry right now.  PUT HER NAME ON A JERSEY @NFL! Put some respect on her name.  I celebrate that Blake lives so maybe she gets justice.  All this hashtagging his name is more violence against her.
1300598009110179840 2020-09-01 08:55:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I got a restraining order the next day and he did abide by it.  Thank God.  But I know how Blake’s Ex felt laying in that bed with a child next to her helpless while he penetrated her.  If you aren’t a woman, you don’t get how demeaning that shit it. The @nfl hates women.
1300597572432691204 2020-09-01 08:53:19 +0800 <just_mindy> When I was 25 years old with an 8 month old baby, my estranged husband kicked in my front door, dragged me out of my bed by my hair, kicked my TV and our child’s playhouse to pieces, spit in my face, took his golf clubs and left me with a door off the frame. So I know that terror
1300597038959284224 2020-09-01 08:51:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @deerskin1789 This Blake thing has me fired up
1300596133689950209 2020-09-01 08:47:36 +0800 <just_mindy> She’s not crazy.  She’s complicit.  She’s no different than those women on North Korean state news who spin events to favor her political party.  She’s out to convince you your lying eyes are wrong.  It’s sick behavior.
1300592393117405186 2020-09-01 08:32:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @KyR1775 @fancythis Only without beans!!!
1300584591414235138 2020-09-01 08:01:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I’ve got the morning sun, And I’ve got the evening breeze. I’ve got the man that I love, lying close to me... I’ve got a few good friends and my bills are paid.. I live in Florida with this sunset, and I got it made.  🎶 🎵  https://t.co/FvOu11PQ5h
