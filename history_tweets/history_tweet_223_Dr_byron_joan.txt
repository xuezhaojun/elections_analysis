1342113374440742914 2020-12-24 22:22:18 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> All I want for Christmas is for people to be nice to me and to enjoy their celebrations. But all they want for Christmas is me to enjoy my presents and not have an opinion. How am I supposed to have any fun when all I'm thinking is that I wish I could what I wish they would...
1339283038535118856 2020-12-17 02:55:33 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> i call myself doctor so i guess you can call me that. i have been told to get a life, but this is the only thing I can think about all day.🤓😁
1339281903921356807 2020-12-17 02:51:03 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Using this insight, we might be able to go on to demonstrate that ‘relevant uncertainty’ could be used to explain the accuracy of fMRI-based brain activity measurements of ‘frontal regions’ among controls and over-responsive autistic people.
1339281516086636545 2020-12-17 02:49:30 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> For example, the human visual system exhibits continuous properties (exponential speed and binomial probability distribution of the signal's changes), whereas the attentional blink hypothesis proposes a more discrete model.
1339281462277844998 2020-12-17 02:49:17 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Love it. Measuring how fast the signal is changing under these conditions can therefore reveal the transition model. According to the continuous-model hypothesis, a true neural system is one in which signals constantly change over time and in the same direction.
1336744969026080769 2020-12-10 02:50:10 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> I want to thank every person who follows me on twitter for helping me to learn and improve my writing skills and also helping me to learn about the brain. I also want to thank all my students who have been so great to me during the whole year of learning and improving  :)

1336317106023968768 2020-12-08 22:30:00 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> We did not want to accept this in philosophy, and we did not want to accept it in psychology, so the field demanded its own data generation mechanism, the “paper” method. One must take a report of what people do and record it in the literature.
1336316854139142145 2020-12-08 22:29:00 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> What happened to #social #psychology is the same thing that happened to #philosophy: The shift from ideas to data generation led us to the absurd conclusion that everything exists only in a particular theoretical framework.

1335259675470737409 2020-12-06 00:28:09 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @psychreg why not. i don't feel as motivated as i used to... perhaps i should plan  more interesting articles in advance and then just sit down at my computer and type out one of them. 🤓
1334919338218950659 2020-12-05 01:55:46 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> When we are not present in the moment, we can feel restless and disconnected and be easily distracted. Without the heart and brain talking to one another, we are unable to reach the true, authentic self and take advantage of the opportunities presented to us.
1334919292660273152 2020-12-05 01:55:35 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> The two layers of communication are not interchangeable, and the interplay between these two layers of our mind is crucial for our self-awareness and emotional well-being.
1334114250273460226 2020-12-02 20:36:38 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @JylkkaJussi For example, that the non-human mind shows the ability to feel emotions–or more accurately that emotions appear to be a necessary part of what defines the human mind. The capacity for feeling emotional states seems a reflection of the interaction of various brain regions.
1333996313474703360 2020-12-02 12:48:00 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Bridging the gap between psychology &amp; philosophy of mind are quite promising: the heritage of using neuroscience to probe what can be known in the non-human mind–of enquiry &amp; exploration that is relevant to all forms of cognitive science–remains is highly relevant to philosophy.
1333492398299750407 2020-12-01 03:25:37 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @DrAmyMarschall Or should you just treat it like any other follower number, albeit a high one?
1333491497556185094 2020-12-01 03:22:02 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> I recently discovered that the #female fronted power trios are starting to make a come back after being quite extinct for quite some time and I don’t know what to make of it. What does that mean for the future?
1333491438189948929 2020-12-01 03:21:48 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> I grew up listening to #Portishead. I think they are quite possibly the best band out there. I think they are one of my top 5 favorite bands of all time and always have been, they may always be.
1333036887095848960 2020-11-29 21:15:35 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Well, mirror neurons did not disappear, but instead morphed in unusual ways in the extended brain. Many scientists have a version of the mirror neuron story in common. Their version is often identical, but they may disagree about how mirror neurons came to be in the brain.
1333022133216272384 2020-11-29 20:16:57 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> I'm a bit worried about how little I've done this year. And if that wasn't why I was concerned, I might worry about something else instead.  #sunday #thoughts #wineoclock
1332708743281250308 2020-11-28 23:31:39 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> I have been somewhat depressed that there are no great computer modeling results on which to base my ideas, because I fear they will be far too complex, so I have decided to begin with simple models with relatively few parameters - such as object recognition.🤓
1332704677545332738 2020-11-28 23:15:30 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @mjdramstead Love it! I plan to make progress in solving this problem by making use of the foundational work on scale-free scale-free networks and combining the pre-existing graphsand to make the most efficient use of computation. I will focus more heavily on neural network models.
1332701150546702336 2020-11-28 23:01:29 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @BernardJBaars @heather_berlin You would say that most of us are unsure about the nature of consciousness and therefore need to actively look for it, because only when we know what we are looking for, do we succeed.
1332701014164697090 2020-11-28 23:00:56 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> What would it mean to be a truly conscious self-aware being that still does not understand itself? Does consciousness not reveal itself to us? Where is consciousness? Does it exist in the other than us? Are you even real?  If something is really real, how do I even know it is?
1332318456763576325 2020-11-27 21:40:48 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @GlobalResearchN I'm working on a way to automate high speed trajectories of sound propagation using surface acoustic wave.

I do this research in three different areas: molecular biology, genomics, and computational psychiatry, and I am very interested in how to link computational algorithms to biological problems.
1332317747066396672 2020-11-27 21:37:58 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> #consciousness is that there is a child inside of me that won't grow up.
1332023930241028097 2020-11-27 02:10:27 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Intuition is the unseen guidance equivalent to higher states of consciousness. At these higher levels, you are also at your highest vibrational frequency. The choice to live in love will manifest an inner light of passion in your being. 10/n
1332023476664885250 2020-11-27 02:08:39 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Don’t get too caught up in what you planned to do next. Instead, give yourself permission to ditch whatever failed you, without guilt. 9/n

1332022615888842754 2020-11-27 02:05:14 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> One of the most powerful tools that will help you maximize the effort you put into your next step is a schedule. Now you don’t need to be Scrooge and insist on only one minute a day in order to see results. We’re not talking about the Martha Stewart-level schedule. 7/n

1332022197305696256 2020-11-27 02:03:34 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> So give up the back-patting &amp; go find some people to pay it forward. Tell someone about your discoveries. Most of us have only our own experience to draw upon. When you let others in on your work, you help expand your circle of knowledge &amp; wisdom &amp; build a supportive network. 5/n
1332021849862131712 2020-11-27 02:02:11 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Now, we all know that we can do the right thing every day, but seeing it done and consistently can inspire us to do the right thing. Just as feeling sad makes us want to do things to make ourselves feel better, feeling proud makes us want to do things to feel more worthy. 4 / n

1332021222272544768 2020-11-27 01:59:41 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> The problem is, that it’s still hard to figure out how to use  psychological tools to create lasting change in our lives and communities. Let me explain why - a thread ...1/n

1331643102885519364 2020-11-26 00:57:11 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> To me, the entire social media world is a person-to-person conversation.
1331643075710611458 2020-11-26 00:57:04 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> Although I’m not a social media coach, have no background in marketing or advertising, or any sort of fancy IT degree to speak of, I am very qualified to do a job that I love and am paid well to do. Why? Because I have already done the hard work.

In contrast, even if what the layer “sees” is completely different from what they “feel.” In essence, the neural network is essentially training itself to generate the output that best represents what the layer “sees.”
1330992277464944643 2020-11-24 05:51:02 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> @manos_tsakiris @RaffaeleTuccia @NezaVehar @OSFramework Thanks! The idea behind GANs is that the output from one layer of a neural network depends on the input layer of the network. This is the same as how humans draw drawings based on what we see 1/2

1321034588530135041 2020-10-27 18:22:44 +0800 <Dr_byron_joan> 'Fake' brain science is a genre of pseudo-scientific literature that seeks to replicate the form of a human brain. It involves recreating a wiring diagram of a simulated brain onto a piece of paper, (as well as making other outlandish claims) with little to no physical evidence.
