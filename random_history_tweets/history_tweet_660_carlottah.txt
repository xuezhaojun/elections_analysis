1330617340363476993 2020-11-23 05:01:10 +0800 <carlottah> Never Ends for Black Folks. Kill us, try to disenfranchise our votes, suppress our vote. Black Folks bend but will not brake.
1330259568102924292 2020-11-22 05:19:30 +0800 <carlottah> @MikeKellyPA should not take the oath of office because voter fraud. He most invalidate his win
1329644876808544256 2020-11-20 12:36:56 +0800 <carlottah> @LeeChatfield. Trying to disenfranchise Black Folks voice in Detroit will not happen.
1329644299055751171 2020-11-20 12:34:39 +0800 <carlottah> @SenMikeShirkey our vote matter in Detroit. Trump wants to disenfranchise our votes in Detroit it won't happen. Black Folks will not stand for this .
1329634489232994305 2020-11-20 11:55:40 +0800 <carlottah> What is so frightening about Covid and Trump is that people are willing to let people die and over through Black votes and the election. People in power not willing to stand up to Trump. My soul hurts from all the suffering.
1329170484030820353 2020-11-19 05:11:52 +0800 <carlottah> But they question Warnock's Faith.

1329129396196741126 2020-11-19 02:28:36 +0800 <carlottah> Why are Black Folks votes deemed fraudulent?
1329121963328081921 2020-11-19 01:59:04 +0800 <carlottah> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor  Do not let any unwholesome talk come out your mouth, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs.
1329121960677302272 2020-11-19 01:59:03 +0800 <carlottah> @marcorubio. Do not offer the parts the part of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourself to God. The fruit of the Spirit is Love, joy, peace, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control.

1324054716129693696 2020-11-05 02:23:38 +0800 <carlottah> I live in Detroit my husband never received his ballot. He voted. He has liver disease and over 70 he went to clerk office Monday to vote with Covid increasing in MI. Black Folks will risk everything to vote Trump out.

1312764522332069890 2020-10-04 22:40:26 +0800 <carlottah> Black folks always get the short end of the stick. Trump gets free healthcare and most expensive therapies. 200k dead because the mismanagement of Covid -19. Just a bad healthcare system.

1312134469503967232 2020-10-03 04:56:50 +0800 <carlottah> Republicans trying to take healthcare away.

1312130626628198400 2020-10-03 04:41:34 +0800 <carlottah> @jelani9 We need to wish Trump's family well also all the families fighting covid now. No one should suffer. No one. We need a national tragedy for covid. America is suffering the pain is real.
1312024059467780098 2020-10-02 21:38:06 +0800 <carlottah> What the H***
1312001497161441281 2020-10-02 20:08:27 +0800 <carlottah> @tribelaw No ones gloating wishing first family well and all other family suffering from covid well. The 200k families that have lost loved ones we send our love. The thousands who lost jobs aren't gloating. America is suffering not gloating.
1311729307673395205 2020-10-02 02:06:52 +0800 <carlottah> Looks awful

1311368502545088514 2020-10-01 02:13:09 +0800 <carlottah> True story. My husband and I got lost going to visit in Pittsburg. It was late at night and I saw so many American flags I got so scared I am black I started crying thinking we can't stop and ask anyone because we might get killed. Living black in America.
1311364421021728770 2020-10-01 01:56:56 +0800 <carlottah> Ya see what you doing right. Give the Brother a break. We all understand what he needs to do. If he goes against masta there will be consequences. He knows Trumps a racist. Let us not do what ( they ) want us to do beat up on each other. Together we stand.
1311359443657986048 2020-10-01 01:37:09 +0800 <carlottah> That mean nothing. Black folks be careful. President has rallied his white supremacist supporters.
1311358620718764034 2020-10-01 01:33:53 +0800 <carlottah> He already knew what Trump was.  Why put his life and family life at risk for some bullshit. Black folks know the game you have to play in America. You can't speak against masta because there will be consequences. This is America
1311354969182830592 2020-10-01 01:19:23 +0800 <carlottah> Existing in America as a black person has become dangerous. President of the United States has put a target on our backs while White America muse about denouncing white supremacist. Wow just wow.
1311107307191894016 2020-09-30 08:55:15 +0800 <carlottah> Trump doesn't want his base to see him get smashed.

1310620899742306305 2020-09-29 00:42:27 +0800 <carlottah> Grew up with that saying.
1310430268646461440 2020-09-28 12:04:57 +0800 <carlottah> Trump and GOP are criminals. Stealing Americans tax dollars while killing us with Covid.
1310426909856149504 2020-09-28 11:51:36 +0800 <carlottah> You got that right

1310401407502233600 2020-09-28 10:10:16 +0800 <carlottah> We are praying for him also Stress can be very harmful.
1310370110264291328 2020-09-28 08:05:54 +0800 <carlottah> I know right.
1310369473254363136 2020-09-28 08:03:22 +0800 <carlottah> The hoax played on the American people. Thinking Trump could manage a crisis and he couldn't manage his own business. No wonder covid is a disaster No national tragedy. He doesn't have a plan and doesn't know how to make one. Americans suffer.
1310338182723121157 2020-09-28 05:59:02 +0800 <carlottah> Why do middle class people pay so much in taxes? This is not fair. Trump is cheating us and killing us

1310279310771658753 2020-09-28 02:05:06 +0800 <carlottah> Reporting on what the President is saying even if it's bat shit crazy.  This not helping the American people struggling. We are lost.lost. America is disappearing.
1310279308003467264 2020-09-28 02:05:05 +0800 <carlottah> People aren't interested unless he has a tragedy for Covid.  America battles racial injustices, covid, unemployed and struggling to teach their children in covid. Trump not on their minds only the media. Media giving less than a damn about people lives in covid.

1309649530867134464 2020-09-26 08:22:34 +0800 <carlottah> They are all scared the Trump administration. The criminal activity that's been going on for 4 years. What Biden administration will uncover will send a lot of the administration to jail. Some Senators too. The attorney general also. .

1309626089753505792 2020-09-26 06:49:26 +0800 <carlottah> Trumps fight to keep Americans from voting will bite him in the a$$.
1309616739358068742 2020-09-26 06:12:16 +0800 <carlottah> Trump's base are now scared of mail in voting and may not show up to poll because it's rigged. Good job Trump.
1309615697211908098 2020-09-26 06:08:08 +0800 <carlottah> So disrespectful to RBG seat. What a way to energize women across America.
1309614501440950276 2020-09-26 06:03:23 +0800 <carlottah> Not true racism keeps lots of Black American out of jobs , homes and schools. You know it.  We know you know Trump is a racist. You sold your soul don't try to bullsh$$ us. Remember blacks folks can read you. Skinin and grinin

1309579797690028032 2020-09-26 03:45:29 +0800 <carlottah> Season on our life. Just kill us just for the hell of it no one faces any cost. White supremacist being celebrated. Rich getting richer. Poor getting  left behind. Black folks know this presidential race is life or death for us.
1309579796008046592 2020-09-26 03:45:28 +0800 <carlottah> Our struggles are. People will vote Trump out. Black and brown will turn out to express how they feel about Trump at the voting booth. Trauma older blacks feel as they see America policy going backwards. Black seeing it's open
1309579794070351876 2020-09-26 03:45:28 +0800 <carlottah> Level of suffering that people can't understand. Americans are suffering. The stress Trump has put on brown and black people. Young people , old people and babies among 205k dead of covid. Sh$$ ain't sweet in America. This is the People America no matter what
1309579791268487168 2020-09-26 03:45:27 +0800 <carlottah> If going to work on the frontline will kill them or bring covid home or   maybe they become  hospitalized  who will take care of their children how will they pay for hospital bill because they don't have healthcare. Watching TV would be a luxury. There is a
1309579787476905985 2020-09-26 03:45:26 +0800 <carlottah> Covid has more families doing school by zoom .People are shopping ,cooking dinner ,homework and checking in with loved one by zoom.

We as American must Vote Trump out so he can seek help and heal and his supporters can heal and move on. We must seek the best for each other. Vote so we can heal.
1307519026541867015 2020-09-20 11:16:43 +0800 <carlottah> Trump is on another level of crazy and feeding his supporters a deadly dose of his craziness and that even crazier and scary.
