1338263551643951105 2020-12-14 07:24:29 +0800 <KymBrown3> @robert_crosby20 @NickCarpentry I am confused because the Georgia Constitution states that only voters that voted in the general election are eligible to vote in a run off. Yet she says she has requests from people that are NEW voters.
1334653322150686722 2020-12-04 08:18:43 +0800 <KymBrown3> @elenaparent @GaSecofState @FultonInfo I listened to every word spoken today. It's disgusting that you see citizens of our state part of a conspiracy theory. You are pathetic. And you ask stupid questions.

For a post that had been on my page for 30 days before the ban. And also ask him why I can't send ANY political link in Messenger. I thought they didn't monitor that.
