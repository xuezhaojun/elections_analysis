Which make us wonder if they have agendas to sweep hate crimes under the rugs. I think they are bias toward Asian community.

1340562992929206273 2020-12-20 15:41:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> This dude here still believe his Boise still has some kind of mysterious invincibility and shouldn’t be beat by SJSU. LOL. Totally out of touch with reality!

1340362843334402048 2020-12-20 02:26:19 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ProFootballTalk There’s nothing like catching a 5 yd pass and cutting thru the entire defense for 80 yard TD. Jerry is the GOAT.
1340362322817081344 2020-12-20 02:24:15 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Drex2184 @ProFootballTalk LOL. Did u see moss at age 33? He was turning into a 200 yd per year receiver. No one will roster a 200 yd/year WR for 8 more years. U are a freaking joke.
1340361256830607361 2020-12-20 02:20:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Bcrad82 @Tyler_Dempss @ProFootballTalk If today’s kids play in flag football rules, sit down u 🤡
1340360821348581377 2020-12-20 02:18:17 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Tyler_Dempss @ProFootballTalk Rice can produce 1000+ yds at age 40. That’s the same damn era when moss was lighting up the league with way weaker hand check rules.  But because, today’s kids just like to talk about stats... well, rice blow out moss in every category. So sit down, 🤡

1340357545253171201 2020-12-20 02:05:16 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ProFootballTalk @Michael_Fabiano Freaking no comparison. Rice is the Goat.

1340204774013030400 2020-12-19 15:58:12 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RaydiantMedia @FFToday Cross my fingers on Tim Patrick
1340199211866832897 2020-12-19 15:36:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jldii2 @jcanas00 @heykayadams How u get cmc and Saquan? Is this a 3 team league?
1340191416035635200 2020-12-19 15:05:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @dustinjudas @MatthewBerryTMR U can only play Logan Thomas with Alex smith.
1340190999801315330 2020-12-19 15:03:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MooseRunsLoose @DanRather I remember him 😂
1340188814547976194 2020-12-19 14:54:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MooseRunsLoose @RaymondStone @DanRather No show at Super Bowl. Yawner... 🤫
1340188047111942144 2020-12-19 14:51:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MooseRunsLoose @DanRather If I will pick one WR that can quit on me at anytime, it’s moss.
1340185483867897858 2020-12-19 14:41:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @billsbroUK Pittman
1340184061994659840 2020-12-19 14:35:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @spruoko @ProFootballTalk Yawn. U just talking non sense. Grow up, kid.
1340182857776386048 2020-12-19 14:31:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @spruoko @ProFootballTalk Nope. Moss got Brady and couldn’t beat the giants in the super bowl. What did rice do when the game is at the brightest? Rice won super bowl MVP. There’s no legendary plays from moss in any of his super bowl. Hell, even the 40 year old rice put up great numbers with the raiders.
1340172882509398016 2020-12-19 13:51:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @brgridiron @getchapopcast Funny. Moss is like the 4th best WR who put on 49ers uniform. Rice, TO, issac Bruce, and then moss.
1340169319280304129 2020-12-19 13:37:19 +0800 <sugarknight33> @XTBoxscore Not really. Gruden wanted to change QB and Mariota fits in more
1340168934310363139 2020-12-19 13:35:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @knbrmurph Jerry was way more dominant than moss or TO. His consistency is bar none!
1340168316359385088 2020-12-19 13:33:20 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF So irv jr over kmet?

1340166583495245824 2020-12-19 13:26:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Ihartitz rae carruth got released from prison, time to give him a shot.
1340117305590566917 2020-12-19 10:10:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MiKeMeUpP If I need a WR to make a play, I am taken Jerry rice over any WRs any day. Super Bowl MVP! Jerry was clutch! Moss? Never won the big one.
1340105532825161728 2020-12-19 09:23:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NFL @Michael_Fabiano @49ers @dallascowboys @nflthrowback we are getting 2 crappy teams to play this sunday.

1339825494187933696 2020-12-18 14:51:05 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ColinCowherd Fritzmagic should be #1
1339825168735080448 2020-12-18 14:49:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Seriously, players need to take their own accountability because they have the final sign off. They own their lineup.
1339797960872247296 2020-12-18 13:01:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jmthrivept Chargers doctor was the real MVP! Franchise changer move!

1338868664305532928 2020-12-15 23:28:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF What’s hurting Herbert is OC isn’t aggressive at looking downfield bombs play or using that 6’9 Partham TE enough. Hope that changes on this Thursday
1338865927031418889 2020-12-15 23:18:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF Is Allen playing this short week? Is ekeler playing?
1338865282303979525 2020-12-15 23:15:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Nick_BDGE Good morning peon.

1338865041550921728 2020-12-15 23:14:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamKoffler If hunt goes to Jax, u will see at least 50/50 split
1338730548512976897 2020-12-15 14:20:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Jordanhchilds @jmthrivept sucks to be the other team who loss with a 144.
1338729733907861504 2020-12-15 14:16:55 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DynastyBeard riding him to the finish!
1338729604010295296 2020-12-15 14:16:24 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse returning is one thing... but is he useful in fantasy?
1338729419968430080 2020-12-15 14:15:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @andy_buckler i like Njoku. for whatever reason, Browns don't feature him. wasted in Cleveland. he should go to Texans and replace that useless TD-allergic Akins.
1338716155108704258 2020-12-15 13:22:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ He is a playmaker. Not a QB

1338588354191925249 2020-12-15 04:55:08 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MWCFootballTalk hope they know it's just a game. here in  Silicon Valley, we have the NHL, MLB, NFL, NBA.  Boise? only that awful blue turf.
1338587542682173441 2020-12-15 04:51:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MWCFootballTalk whos the gutless Boise fan?

1338549334845976576 2020-12-15 02:20:05 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Brown1arthur yup. TO is a HOFer. AJ Brown is no where near that statue yet.
1338548827045818368 2020-12-15 02:18:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SportsCenter well deserved cut.

1338536437583507456 2020-12-15 01:28:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyProsNFL @Beerad30 good for Chad Hansen, next Man up for Watson!
1338536267823206400 2020-12-15 01:28:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @liveocgirl so done with Devante Parker. freaking trash. last week, he got kick out of the ball-game. this week, he just flat out stinks with 0.  Rolling with Chad Hansen at WR3!
1338532095359008769 2020-12-15 01:11:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse Ekeler is the perfect complimentary to my Henry. One catches so much, the other one runs so much. Perfect balance for my RB dual.
1338520400720842752 2020-12-15 00:25:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @_NateWaterstram @MikeClayNFL Stop blaming ponder and bridge water.
1338520094700314624 2020-12-15 00:23:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AnthonyQuinton0 @MikeClayNFL Adam is a hometown hero. Played HS, college locally. Super underdog to make it to NFL, I drafted. Signed with his childhood team. worked his way from special team. I can see why fans like him more than diggs. But diggs saved that GM’s face from keep drafting nothing but WR busts.
1338518918986526725 2020-12-15 00:19:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @alexjaques5 @Clvpback And his Dumbo HC
1338379468327383045 2020-12-14 15:05:05 +0800 <sugarknight33> @danielrpopper that Anthony Lynn has to go.

1338378552790581248 2020-12-14 15:01:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SanJoseStateFB He should thank @SjsuTuite for believing this coach when not many fans had.
1338378025193201664 2020-12-14 14:59:21 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Tailoredfitatl @GoSeaRich @SharpFootball and the media should be blaming Lynn. he dumb to keep rolling with crappy OC. Lynn also need to be blamed for bad clock management.

1338343591811272704 2020-12-14 12:42:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MrJerryOC @Michael_Fabiano Fantasy apps should delete u! Garbage manager!
1338340856047124480 2020-12-14 12:31:39 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Yup. Tired of Matt Ryan , cut him for KickerHopkins this morning and never looking back.
1338339294285422594 2020-12-14 12:25:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DotsNCuts @jake20063 @HerbertToAllen Lynn has to be one of the worst HC ever. His team is always behind, bad clock management, and finds a way to lose. Right up there with Adam genius gase.

1338337461747867648 2020-12-14 12:18:10 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MikeClayNFL And that’s the end of McKinnon era in SF

1338256611245060098 2020-12-14 06:56:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF Anthony Lynn should be fired

1337477252611633157 2020-12-12 03:20:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF What a relief
1337370863868411905 2020-12-11 20:17:15 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ScottSBucs That’s because Evans is eating a humble pie saying that Keenan Allen is not as good as him. Allen killed Evans this year.
1337244624704847872 2020-12-11 11:55:37 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse Done?

1337196524992794631 2020-12-11 08:44:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Totally. Balt uses 3-4 RBs , plus Lamar . It’s always Lamar gets his numbers first before his RBs get the TDs.

1336863908561256448 2020-12-10 10:42:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter How dare u flex out 49ers vs boys over some scrub franchises like the browns?
1336863662577840129 2020-12-10 10:41:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse Jonnu smith. Since I just picked him up
1336856030630690816 2020-12-10 10:11:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ScottSBucs still need him to produce like a WR1, not a TE1.
1336855431973457920 2020-12-10 10:09:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @andy_buckler that's not what the Ravens are doing. everyone is touching the ball.

1336728938979049473 2020-12-10 01:46:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BenchMachine101 Everyone needs help on TE if u don’t have kelce or Waller

1336574041595867136 2020-12-09 15:30:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BrendanStats that's everyone!

1336573337560993792 2020-12-09 15:28:10 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BenchMachine101 maybe as long as Akins don't play the colts?

1336561658571837440 2020-12-09 14:41:46 +0800 <sugarknight33> @GridironGreek This will be a better browns team. I like Chubb and hunt on this one.

1336530840491212800 2020-12-09 12:39:18 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter Smart thinking. No wonder Dallas didn’t want to tackle tonight.
1336530688930009088 2020-12-09 12:38:42 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse Probably all!

1336372478046695424 2020-12-09 02:10:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan Alex smith could be the goat too, if u take his career game and then times by 16. Stop skewing the numbers and predict non sense.

1336222238937210882 2020-12-08 16:13:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DeyonteDte that's Lamar Jackson! MVP of the league last year.

1336067602536427525 2020-12-08 05:58:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @geoffschwartz Madden needs to honor that.
1336067382536675329 2020-12-08 05:57:41 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TheJetPress truly a selfless Jets hero. 12/06/2020 will always be Gregg Williams Regional Holiday for the Jets and their fans.
1336067317596180481 2020-12-08 05:57:26 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AmyTrask @Raiders @nyjets Jets fans around the country said the same too. truly a selfless Jets hero. 12/06/2020 will always be Gregg Williams Regional Holiday for the Jets and their fans. That was a clutch clutch call to secure Lawrence !
1336066637988995073 2020-12-08 05:54:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @CSimmsQB truly a selfless Jets hero. 12/06/2020 will always be Gregg Williams Regional Holiday for the Jets and their fans.

1336063905559285760 2020-12-08 05:43:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MaydayMallon @richeisen can't out-duel Mr. Genius Gase! Gase refuses to lose Lawrence from the Jags.
1336063488662204417 2020-12-08 05:42:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @richeisen Gregg Williams is a Jets Hero. Truly Selfless and that move alone set Jets future up for the next decade.

1336045685594939397 2020-12-08 04:31:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF I am down at least 100 pts to those TEs with my boy Akins
1335996104299536392 2020-12-08 01:14:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @rotoworld that was an unanimous play call by the whole coaching staff. GM send the play to Gregg Williams, Gregg relayed to Adam Gase, Gase approved. Pop the champagne!  Lawrence will be a Jets. No doubt!
1335994765754519554 2020-12-08 01:09:08 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JayGlazer it's very shocking. Gregg Williams got the job done. he made sure Jets will be a dominant force in the next decade with that championship play call. When Lawrence wears his first Gang Green Jersey, we all will remembered his legendary play call.  sent this play to Canton!
1335987396312088583 2020-12-08 00:39:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TyrannSZN @RapSheet @TomPelissero Safeties also blitzed. Job executed at perfection. We all will remembered this legendary play when Lawrence wears his first jets jersey. Put Greg Williams to Jets ring of honor! Gase to HOF!

1335966948975202305 2020-12-07 23:18:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF Consider that Jefferson wasn’t even being game plan in the first few weeks, that is elite to have this run.
1335846272368926721 2020-12-07 15:19:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @WRsavant @DynastyBeard But his top TE is sad
1335846134909038592 2020-12-07 15:18:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DynastyBeard Because Jordan Akins lay an egg again with Watson being QB. He suck

1335690281228718081 2020-12-07 04:59:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter Still trust jello?
1335690118015807489 2020-12-07 04:58:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DrJesseMorse Thanks doc. I was wondering where Parker went. Glad u ain’t reporting an injury on Parker. ;-)
1335686993922064384 2020-12-07 04:46:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @allinkid But tua only knows 1 way
1335683427564077056 2020-12-07 04:31:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter And still Watson can’t find Akins
1335680496445968384 2020-12-07 04:20:20 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AaronWilson_NFL Watson is garbage
1335679768528752640 2020-12-07 04:17:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @allinkid At least Tua tried.
1335678233354752002 2020-12-07 04:11:21 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MikeClayNFL I need an upgrade on TE. Clearly hooper and Akins are garbage

1335669571538194432 2020-12-07 03:36:56 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet That’s a great trade off.
1335668015308795905 2020-12-07 03:30:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JamesDKoh I picked up mims just for that moment. Ready to bench Parker again
1335667755840729088 2020-12-07 03:29:43 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JamesDKoh We need to this bengals spanking on the Dolphins so we won’t ever see tua again of ROS

1335626993048547328 2020-12-07 00:47:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Fantasy_Mansion I have no other options, wish me luck today with 3 catches for 25 yds.
1335626612360896515 2020-12-07 00:46:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Macdaddy35Mac @PodcastVince @RapSheet Tua ceiling is quite low this year. And in fantasy we only care about this year.
1335626044347273221 2020-12-07 00:43:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @rose_kade @RapSheet I think full practices actually hurt fritzmagic. He needs to come off the bench every week. Don’t think too much, just sling it. Keep the magic alive.
1335625481945710595 2020-12-07 00:41:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet Got my kicker sanders ready!

1335613744315961351 2020-12-06 23:55:05 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator @Andrewcombs09 Now that dumbo is no longer head coach, bevell won’t have to commit to younger players. Next 5 games , he need to show that he can coach. Will u go with AP more or fumble Johnson more?

1335276348995035137 2020-12-06 01:34:24 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JakeAsman How do u keep the jets fans engaged and excited with showing glimpses of hope while executing the full tank job to get Lawrence in NY? Gase is doing an excellent job of balancing both. Get him an extension. He is a genius.

1335111523484618754 2020-12-05 14:39:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF Personally, I like Gabe Davis. His QB is a stud. Too bad he can’t get a good game out of him during my bye weeks. I just have no luck with Davis.
1335110978636169216 2020-12-05 14:37:17 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamKoffler For this week, I totally will start booker over Taylor and  monty

1335101304826253312 2020-12-05 13:58:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TheRealAdam_H 2 different styles. Gruden actually will run the ball. Unlike that garbage OC in Atlanta. Lousy in committing on anything.

1334528012318982146 2020-12-04 00:00:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator @RyanMc23 Same boat as u. After a trade to get Herbert on his bye week, and then started him over Ryan right away, it’s been heaven.
1334525455865585666 2020-12-03 23:50:37 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyPros 8-4 with post season locked. Kick back this week

1334389962280603648 2020-12-03 14:52:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @riversmccown yeah yeah yeah. but i saw Fells and the other TE more in the huddle than that Akins boy.  is he really a big-time weapon?
1334389339988480000 2020-12-03 14:49:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @hjchami beast!  i won with his 0.4 points too. Akins SZN starts tomorrow!
1334388098931642368 2020-12-03 14:44:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FfStalder Trace looks better than rg3 and Lamar Jackson on throwing the football.

1334387040264196096 2020-12-03 14:40:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Officialj0nn @BleacherReport they are all young bucks. they can easily land on a championship team once they go to ring-chasing mode. so never says never. 3 balls certainly increase the odds of the ping-pong balls.

1334265600130965504 2020-12-03 06:38:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TorreySmithWR U did a amazing job of fooling the 49ers to sign u to that big contract! Worst WR ever!
1334236854749544448 2020-12-03 04:43:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TheCustodianFF Nice. That’s the same schedule as red zone Evans!

1334156990868647938 2020-12-02 23:26:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet Chargers will commit to taylor as backup for next few years , thereby extending his career. Pretty sweet under the table deal.

1334025463505686528 2020-12-02 14:43:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LordReebs Can’t believe I dropped Robert tonyan. I can’t even find a replacement that produces over 5.5 pts.
1334019903905415169 2020-12-02 14:21:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DZangaroNBCS That should be a fox game
1334002355277238273 2020-12-02 13:12:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF I thought u are talking about fantasy value, because no game managers will help ur fantasy team win.

1333993404003323904 2020-12-02 12:36:26 +0800 <sugarknight33> @HereForFFB @Ihartitz I would be extremely pissed to trade Henry away for a walking time bomb in fuller
1333992530300465153 2020-12-02 12:32:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ThirdDownHack @Ihartitz @dynasty_goat AJ green? Freaking highway robbery! I thought I saw AJ brown was at least be included in the trade.
1333991923183304704 2020-12-02 12:30:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFTroglodyte @Dundalk_Deb Ravens didn’t care. That RB ain’t throwing to them anyways.
1333990831208816640 2020-12-02 12:26:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JimmyKempski Felt like running 5.9 to me.
1333987016426414080 2020-12-02 12:11:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Evans and Godwin deserves better.
1333986649710108672 2020-12-02 12:09:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Bucs should consider cutting Brady and bring back jameis next year. 49ers offense will be perfect fit for Brady. Deebo and kittles love short passes and get those YACs. They also have tons of no name receivers (richie James, Kendrick Bourne)who don’t mind getting 2 passes a game
1333983386025615362 2020-12-02 11:56:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF Great trade for both side. Wilson was worth that much.

1333981827501985792 2020-12-02 11:50:26 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ Mike Evans got turn into a Red zone TE.

1333918401509527554 2020-12-02 07:38:24 +0800 <sugarknight33> @YourFFCoach I take the other way 10 out of 10 times.

1333896925465116673 2020-12-02 06:13:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DanielDopp @MatthewBerryTMR @ESPNFantasy so you can have 2 or more Hopkins in your lineup?

1333794034750373891 2020-12-01 23:24:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @stephenjcam @TheFFBallers That’s too many dead weights on ur bench. I got lucky on my injury, ekeler was the only one I had to held onto. I dropped gaskin, Zach moss, Cohen, Preston Williams, dobbins, David Johnson as soon as they are injure. Maybe I will regret dropping gaskin. What a weird season.
1333756240946610176 2020-12-01 20:54:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @stephenjcam @TheFFBallers Shouldn’t be starting a backup RB to begin with.
1333755430632263680 2020-12-01 20:50:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FfStalder Give him credit, he held this powerful Seattle team to 23 pts only.

1333622045981036545 2020-12-01 12:00:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @GetUpESPN @danorlovsky7 if BA wants big risky plays, might as well re-sign Jameis. he is exactly what BA wanted as a QB. daring, unfazed, big strong arm, and can take an extra second or hit in order for his WRs to get open.

1333582133386833921 2020-12-01 09:22:12 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FF_Terminator because NFL thinks Saints/Broncos game will have higher ratings with a PS WR being the QB.

1333555787680006145 2020-12-01 07:37:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF Finally , Jordan Akins time!
1333541598538285058 2020-12-01 06:41:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @espn @AdamSchefter Broncos and 49ers can play with all PS players. why can't the Ravens?
1333540044536115200 2020-12-01 06:34:57 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter kinda BS to force Broncos to play without a QB, gave Saints a freebie, or forced 49ers to play with all Practice squad players and gave Green Bay a freebie, but then bent over for the Ravens. why?
1333536613658284033 2020-12-01 06:21:19 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF but keeping 2 spots for defense, that means i had to dump one of the struggling TE. i dropped Tonyan and kept Austin Hooper... =(     #YouWonSomeYouLoseSome
1333525760477327363 2020-12-01 05:38:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JeffSchwarze @MikeClayNFL With covid , I think it will be wise to get 2 QB
1333520607149887488 2020-12-01 05:17:43 +0800 <sugarknight33> @harrisokaygo @TaylorRooks still will drop TD passes. Julio is hopeless.
1333520421363146753 2020-12-01 05:16:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TaylorRooks freaking Parker will be owning the NFL if he has Mahomes.
1333519385185513475 2020-12-01 05:12:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFTroglodyte one of the worst coach i ever seen. Chargers have no place for this dumbo.

1333492434953650177 2020-12-01 03:25:46 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JamesDKoh Why do we need to predict? This isn’t science. It’s football!

1333466445015965698 2020-12-01 01:42:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MiKeMeUpP But it’s also the 2 worst games that Herbert played.
1333461978543656960 2020-12-01 01:24:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JL001977 @JoeyB8301 @HipsterPunchy @OriginalRNU @19problemz Yup, heard his name finally, what an impact player Ramsey is
1333461778374660097 2020-12-01 01:23:57 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JoeyB8301 @HipsterPunchy @OriginalRNU @19problemz Kupp and woods combine didn’t even have the production that deebo had. Rams def suck! If 49ers have the full squad back, it will be 40 - 9 spanking of those lowly fraudy lambs.
1333460691689213953 2020-12-01 01:19:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JoeyB8301 @OriginalRNU @19problemz Like Goff and rams are any good! Child pls!

1333460342597304320 2020-12-01 01:18:14 +0800 <sugarknight33> @19problemz That’s right! Deebo ain’t scare of anybody! Rams are frauds! Go 49ers!
1333458988675940354 2020-12-01 01:12:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @YahooFantasy @daltondeldon It’s because of playing against headless horses that made kamara , cook, and MT useless. They didn’t need to do a thing and game is over.

1333251869133574145 2020-11-30 11:29:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF BA should be more patience with jameis. He is a way better fit than Brady in this big play offense.
1333244772153135106 2020-11-30 11:01:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano I knew the legendary drew Bennett will be here

1332558309543481345 2020-11-28 13:33:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ At least 4 TDs for mahomes!
1332557836904058880 2020-11-28 13:32:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @texansmanny @TeamJGRfan @danorlovsky7 @HoustonTexans @deshaunwatson The fact that Texans paid Watson big money already is a red flag. U will not be able to resign fuller and cook this off-season. Snuck with David Johnson. Probably will lose fells as well. Good luck with rebuilding next year.
1332556821182050305 2020-11-28 13:27:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @texansmanny @TeamJGRfan @danorlovsky7 @HoustonTexans @deshaunwatson I will take chargers any day over Texans job. Offense has all the right pieces with Herbert, star RB in ekeler, stud WR and TE in Allen, Henry. Defense is much better than Texans. Talent is there, just totally mismanage
1332526041122840580 2020-11-28 11:25:39 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ @RotoStreetWolf i like Eric Bieniemy going back to Chargers instead. way better fit.

1332355759116410882 2020-11-28 00:09:01 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DFS_Almanac Exactly
1332355363501338625 2020-11-28 00:07:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TexansSavant Stop. Should never listen to ur bs biased projection numbers that make Akins look good. He was a dud on a team that scored 41 pts. Akins got 0.4 points.
1332354471939096576 2020-11-28 00:03:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DoughertyDrew Yes there is. The limits is zero

1332107465559658497 2020-11-27 07:42:23 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AustinEkeler Let’s kick some asses!

1331992754440663040 2020-11-27 00:06:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BleacherReport Giants somehow won 3 World Series in 5 years. What a run!

1331834781915508736 2020-11-26 13:38:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @riversmccown But most of the time, Watson don’t look at his way. So go figure

1331816659884023808 2020-11-26 12:26:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ElvinRyan_FF Maybe u like to cheat to win. He ain’t a TE and isn’t lineup to be a TE, so why he gets TE slot? U just a bozo who needs to cheat in order to win. U should quit because u suck
1331671055396597760 2020-11-26 02:48:15 +0800 <sugarknight33> @sportsandsmack @PFF_Fantasy Ekeler should steal catches away from Keenan. Share the wealth!
1331661598423879681 2020-11-26 02:10:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Ebron85 @NFL ain't that bad. CBS can easily replace you guys with Charle Browns' Thanksgiving special.
1331661041915236352 2020-11-26 02:08:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano yeah, we know Jackson is a RB.
1331660370281340928 2020-11-26 02:05:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TeamJuJu that means you get to enjoy Thanksgiving with your family. isn't that better?
1331660168178720768 2020-11-26 02:04:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter does that means Dobbin can play now?

1331440470346530816 2020-11-25 11:31:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @hxhmarz @Chargers you can't compare WR Allen to a TE Evans. they played different roles.
1331439922486468608 2020-11-25 11:29:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Chargers definitely better than Godwin and Evans!
1331439536765771776 2020-11-25 11:28:17 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Ihartitz Duke Johnson - 88% snapcounts , 5pts.

1331438419998740480 2020-11-25 11:23:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @beerswater I haven’t see him all year.
1331437926371057665 2020-11-25 11:21:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF Pretty awful on how Brady distribute his targets I would say.

1331301691640012802 2020-11-25 02:20:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MrJerryOC ESPN should do a massive boot and send hill to the bench
1331274927517757440 2020-11-25 00:34:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @rotoworld @kyletweetshere @RamsNFL @Buccaneers there's nothing to break down. Brady needs to throw more to Mike Evans. he is the true stud in that offense and he is being wasted.

1330376168176979968 2020-11-22 13:02:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @PFF_Fantasy @FAmmiranteTFJ But is tanner hill ice cold then?
1330375158025117697 2020-11-22 12:58:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DudesFootball Let’s hope so
1330358620282732544 2020-11-22 11:53:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyProsNFL @Beerad30 Here comes the 3 headed TEBC nightmare
1330357138967863302 2020-11-22 11:47:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jmthrivept Glad I play against Melvin Gordon last week
1330356694329688064 2020-11-22 11:45:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TomPelissero @RapSheet The real one is even worst. Unplayable
1330356027074748416 2020-11-22 11:42:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ The way they treat AJ green last season was beyond crazy
1330352326599716867 2020-11-22 11:28:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DaltonGuruFF I think that manager quit already
1330339897509437440 2020-11-22 10:38:42 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FfStalder Well, since that no show for that championship last season vs cupcake miami def, I will never pick mixon on my team ever again. Cost me my ship.
1330331291351478273 2020-11-22 10:04:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DaltonGuruFF Keeping starting hollywood and u won't make it to playoff
1330331005962526720 2020-11-22 10:03:22 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DaltonGuruFF Willie snead!
1330330613556056067 2020-11-22 10:01:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamKoffler That's the same dumb question. Both are RB1s and should be starting!
1330330111586013189 2020-11-22 09:59:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano Best FA pickup ever! Congrats!
1330329689831849984 2020-11-22 09:58:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @wojespn Finally figure that trey young can't play defense and can't win with him
1330236466484682755 2020-11-22 03:47:42 +0800 <sugarknight33> @damienwoody Proof that u don’t need to be a woody or Kobe to make money
1330236076041113606 2020-11-22 03:46:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FredVanVleet Where u going?
1330180812134895620 2020-11-22 00:06:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @iKORRY06 @SportsCenter @wojespn This was the draft and okc missed out
1330179703592931330 2020-11-22 00:02:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BleacherReport Ball plays no defense
1330024212812034048 2020-11-21 13:44:17 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TripPlayFantasy They all got to go. None of them won a Super Bowl. @JerryRice is the goat!
1329997307664683014 2020-11-21 11:57:22 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SportsCenter @wojespn Nets don't have a salary cap?
1329993966108991489 2020-11-21 11:44:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ give me some Willie Snead Sunday!
1329992397057519616 2020-11-21 11:37:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFToday Parker in the fifth.
1329899213459648512 2020-11-21 05:27:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Rotoworld_FB @rotoworld @HaydenWinks willie time!
1329898285293731842 2020-11-21 05:23:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Fantasy_Mansion @FFTroglodyte eric decker was actually pretty decent too. 1-3 catches and TD.
1329897551164633089 2020-11-21 05:20:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NFLInsightsTeam @NFLFantasy who's the QB for panthers this week?
1329897420075929600 2020-11-21 05:20:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FullSendFF @FFTroglodyte makes no sense. bengals owners are known to be cheapasses.
1329896971029553152 2020-11-21 05:18:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TommyTranTV they need to reschedule!
1329896096689135617 2020-11-21 05:15:12 +0800 <sugarknight33> @donemessedup12 who the heck would trade you mahomes for peanuts?
1329895915054796800 2020-11-21 05:14:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyProsNFL @toomuchtuma you do know that someone already dropped winston
1329835110183493633 2020-11-21 01:12:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MattHarmon_BYB I will always thank yahoo for allowing colston on his rookie year to be TE eligible. League winner!
1329826068841185282 2020-11-21 00:36:56 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF @FieldYates @ESPNFantasy someone is getting lit up this sunday.
1329671647754739712 2020-11-20 14:23:19 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SBNation It’s the goats plan all along. MJ put a whooping on both balls 1-1. And then trade his son to China.
1329669652255891457 2020-11-20 14:15:23 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BleacherReport @jj_redick Can’t wait to see pat beverly on melo!
1329659803744997376 2020-11-20 13:36:15 +0800 <sugarknight33> @overtime @MELOD1P MJ 🔥 this 3rd pick because he wants to play lavar 1-1. There’s no hiding now. Lavar is about to get that chance to play against the goat. It’s personal.
1329659215544139776 2020-11-20 13:33:55 +0800 <sugarknight33> @alibifirer @barstoolsports It’s personal.
1329658830964150274 2020-11-20 13:32:23 +0800 <sugarknight33> @HamAnalysis Kirk should have had 1 deep shot chance at the end instead of Andy Isabella and Larry fritz. Those were terrible plays.
1329650775232942083 2020-11-20 13:00:23 +0800 <sugarknight33> @HamAnalysis Matched Hopkins tonight. Good job Kirk!
1329649933448736769 2020-11-20 12:57:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano Seattle def is getting better and better
1329647456506712064 2020-11-20 12:47:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet Seattle def is waking up!
1329631526187720704 2020-11-20 11:43:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SanJoseStateFB @CoachBrennan So Fresno basically wusses out

1329595039400357888 2020-11-20 09:18:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF @YahooFantasy Because he got cut
1329556683949965313 2020-11-20 06:46:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @QCook323 sorry for your loss, quinn.
1329556384250163200 2020-11-20 06:45:18 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jmthrivept i don't think he wants to play this year. he is given half-ass efforts to suit up.
1329554160644104194 2020-11-20 06:36:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LawtonIndy @gordonhayward yeah, he will be a big star in indy
1329503780786737152 2020-11-20 03:16:16 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyMikeBBF @ballblastFB i am in trouble, Parker is sinking, let's hope woods and Kirk can rebound.

1329500975011225602 2020-11-20 03:05:08 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyMikeBBF He is stealing all the looks from Kupp and woods
1329499881484947456 2020-11-20 03:00:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @warriors @niccolomannion home sweet home!

1329494648432119808 2020-11-20 02:39:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BleacherReport @wojespn so sad. Klay was heading to HOF too.
1329459587066470400 2020-11-20 00:20:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Lavarbigballer @MELOD1P @bigballerbrand @ZO2_ @LiAngeloBall MJ really want to 1-1 match, lavar
1329459085331165184 2020-11-20 00:18:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DevyEusuf Or pickup the starters for Miami
1329458553891930112 2020-11-20 00:16:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ArrieDavis @MELOD1P It’s personal! After MJ destroy Lavar, he will trade little ball back to China.
1329458368075898881 2020-11-20 00:15:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MELOD1P @Lavarbigballer More like Goat’s plan. It’s personal! Lavar vs MJ is happening!

1329277972461752325 2020-11-19 12:19:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ComplexSports @wojespn Wiseman took Wiggins' jersey already?
1329277365923418113 2020-11-19 12:16:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ComplexSports @wojespn makes so much sense!    Simmons will be gone for Austin Rivers.
1329273510800224259 2020-11-19 12:01:16 +0800 <sugarknight33> @joegagnonnews @wojespn Because wiseman is a franchise center

1328458401920163840 2020-11-17 06:02:19 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LateRoundQB Why did rams pay woods then?

1328416303778971649 2020-11-17 03:15:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NoisyHuevos When u need just one yard, there’s no better back than Howard.
1328359870051938304 2020-11-16 23:30:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @bendackiw @AdamBMore QB. Put lamar in RB where he belongs.

1328074792117829632 2020-11-16 04:37:59 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF i should have benched Duke Johnson for Evans.
1328062576576458752 2020-11-16 03:49:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan Alex smith still know how to cast black magic on his WRs. 🤔
1328062244358299649 2020-11-16 03:48:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LateRoundQB It’s Washington!

1328053356577767425 2020-11-16 03:12:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFTroglodyte Is he a nfl player? Can’t find him on the field

1328017172476510208 2020-11-16 00:49:01 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RotoPat Mike Evans is playing like a TE

1327999905156120576 2020-11-15 23:40:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @CornerSportsFS Duke szn baby!
1327996371220107264 2020-11-15 23:26:22 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Jurgen_Meyer @jmthrivept Same situation as u. I have ekeler. Luckily I picked up duke Johnson and pope before Jackson and David Johnson went to IR. Playing dukie today and we’ll see who emerge in that chargers backfield.
1327995581864714240 2020-11-15 23:23:14 +0800 <sugarknight33> @KellzNCaLi @jmthrivept It could easily be the other way. Pope is little RB, build like a sprole
1327995223167754242 2020-11-15 23:21:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LegendsRforever @jmthrivept I would drop Hollywood riggins
1327994755469381633 2020-11-15 23:19:57 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan Hope u are right
1327994647008796677 2020-11-15 23:19:31 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan I also have witnessed 10 plus years of Alex smith as a 49ers and a chief. The only WR who had 1 good year was maclin. That was it.
1327993393922723841 2020-11-15 23:14:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @liveocgirl Chase baby chase!
1327993229673779200 2020-11-15 23:13:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan That’s what u think
1327992723710754817 2020-11-15 23:11:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyMikeBBF Yup, I already got rid of my houston K
1327991876574535682 2020-11-15 23:08:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @CornerSportsFS How about pope?
1327843554115297281 2020-11-15 13:19:08 +0800 <sugarknight33> @unlvfootball Great warm up game vs rebels
1327839296254930949 2020-11-15 13:02:12 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFTroglodyte Don’t matter, Russell Wilson hardly use TEs
1327839065572401152 2020-11-15 13:01:17 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SanJoseStateFB Can’t believe Spartans are kicking butts this year
1327827950343913472 2020-11-15 12:17:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFWuTang4evah I wouldn’t say mixon will be a smash. He had a cupcake match with Miami at week 16 last year and he sux
1327827119339053057 2020-11-15 12:13:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SotaLew @ESPNNFL Then u won’t see any big plays moving forward. Everyone will start pulling Hopkins pants down and avoid giving up 50 yd bombs.
1327825950373920768 2020-11-15 12:09:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FFBaldMan Expect downward spiral in the 2nd half. Alex smith can make WRs disappear , just like how Lamar is doing to woody brown
1327821675874852864 2020-11-15 11:52:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano Cleveland seriously need to invest an indoor stadium
1327816481296445440 2020-11-15 11:31:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Ihartitz As long as chargers phase out kelley, both are playable

1327705003406999552 2020-11-15 04:08:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DaltonGuruFF He is better than mike Evans, that’s for sure
1327701718142910466 2020-11-15 03:55:31 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FallasFantasy That’s great news! I got duke Johnson for 3 weeks

1327624739129413634 2020-11-14 22:49:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @dfsCrunch Duke should have gotten more opportunities in Cleveland. It was insane that they trust Crowell and Hyde more than duke. Just wasted in browns.
1327536463299317760 2020-11-14 16:58:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @YourFFCoach At least be as good as t-rich!
1327532182491914242 2020-11-14 16:41:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TheFantasyZohan Or at least pick one and stick with it

1327514035810488320 2020-11-14 15:29:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF Back to force feeding Parker. So yeah! Rolling with Parker! Devonte is back!

1327414831666790400 2020-11-14 08:55:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AwesemoDFS For 14 team league, David is a everyday starter. No fading
1327414498756419584 2020-11-14 08:54:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF I can’t start Evans over woods, Parker, and red hot Kirk. Until Brady won’t treat Evans as a TE usage, he is pretty high risk.
1327360693784305664 2020-11-14 05:20:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @liveocgirl I like duke Johnson’s revenge more than Brady
1327360224424955904 2020-11-14 05:18:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TKingMode At least he was consistent all night
1327360115545018368 2020-11-14 05:18:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF That was expected as Jackson won’t play. Chargers should just phase out Kelley completely.
1327358728975237120 2020-11-14 05:12:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BleacherReport @TheSteinLine Perfect fit. He just want his stats back!

1327334774789206016 2020-11-14 03:37:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @YardsPerGretch Stop telling us how great JT can be. Stop selling this bs stats to us. JT won’t be on my roster as he ain’t even worthy to start as a flex.
1327333892295061504 2020-11-14 03:33:55 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyProsNFL @AdamKoffler Ballage revenge time!

1327291824344420352 2020-11-14 00:46:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @KyleBrandt Ole Miss should have put them two on defense and start tackling Alabama.

Greg Roman is a great OC, turning you into an offensive weapon.  he could of easily turn you into Alex Smith and run the damn ball with that stud backfield.
1327204593822953473 2020-11-13 19:00:08 +0800 <sugarknight33> @donemessedup12 Wake up and pick up nyheim , drop that bust

1326897804145422336 2020-11-12 22:41:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SWallace_FF I can’t remember when was the last time u can rely on that many rookie WRs to start. Even the AJ green and Julio rookie year, only those 2 were star table.
1326897081005473792 2020-11-12 22:38:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyPros I would definitely drop a bench player to keep koo. Everyone else are droppable.

When caveman touch fire, he knows the next time he doesn’t touch it. It’s called nature progression. Stop selling ur bs reform. Its pure regression
1325939628172455937 2020-11-10 07:13:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SteveNFL_ Stop telling people messing up is ok. It’s not ok. Go back to practice and play better! Earn ur trust back , especially if u are a rookie. That’s all I am saying.
1325937703980998656 2020-11-10 07:05:58 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SteveNFL_ Give the next guy a shot! Wilkins is good.

Sad world we live in that we raise kids to take 0 responsibility for their own actions. So talented players get free passes if they mess up? Is that the stupid message u want to send? Child pls

1324229934177345536 2020-11-05 13:59:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @angelavred @JustineBateman Time to find another way. Prop 15 ain’t passing  (thank god). Tax the principals and board, tax each parent more for putting their kids to public school. Tax the robbers, looters, thieves. Make them pay for their fair shares

1324225801387044864 2020-11-05 13:43:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @angelavred @JustineBateman Think big picture. U are too focus on taxing property owners heavily and getting money the easy way. But u will kill more small businesses than u realized. When they can’t afford the rents, they will be gone. When owners can’t rent out, they will sell. More jobs loss.Empty street
1324216495375740928 2020-11-05 13:06:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JustineBateman It’s hard enough to stay in business with current situation, no one is paying $30 lunches or $12 durrito bag or $8 soda if the rent goes way up. Businesses will have to leave, owners will sell off their commercials. Ur downtown will be empty streets in no time.

1324211612090208256 2020-11-05 12:47:05 +0800 <sugarknight33> @madiison_taylor Totally agreed
1324209948482367489 2020-11-05 12:40:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SLAMRewind @NBAHistory It’s possible. I don’t like melo. Dude is a ball hog. He is the one u hate the most during pickup games.
1324209262189453312 2020-11-05 12:37:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @cutter_dog @Roto_Wizard @Michael_Fabiano 49ers only threw the ball 8 times in the nfc championship game last year. It’s over 90% chance of running the ball. Green Bay knew what was coming and still got ran over.
1324207751434661888 2020-11-05 12:31:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @mainwaring79 @Michael_Fabiano At the end of the day, the only number that matters is the win column.

1324186325231177730 2020-11-05 11:06:36 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RosaParksProd @Michael_Fabiano We ran over them with morstert. 200 yds and 4 TDs. McKinnon and hasty both going over 100 yds and TDs.

1324183745448964096 2020-11-05 10:56:21 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano Still got enough RBs to run over GB again

Breida got beat out by Gaskin (who avg sub 4.0 ypc) . he isn't a goal-line back either. hard to trust Breida with Tua at QB.  hope Tua can be better next game.

Jerry Rice's nickname was "The Flash". unless you were watching Rice in his 40s , playing with the Seahawks.  see how many guys can catch him and race him to goal-lines. they won't catch him.

1321952380368285697 2020-10-30 07:09:42 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JamesDKoh how did you get fired by Y!?
1321952247220117504 2020-10-30 07:09:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyProsNFL @mikeMaher Ito Smith is trash.
1321951646352470021 2020-10-30 07:06:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NoisyHuevos well, that is not good news. i have E. Sanders on my team. i want Saints to can MT.
1321951449161498624 2020-10-30 07:06:00 +0800 <sugarknight33> @shaqsfoot1 @espn damn right. LOL!  melo is no legend.

1321939069752889344 2020-10-30 06:16:49 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ At least to the 8th, for sure. Not this 75 pitch count bs, hahaha
1321913601880326147 2020-10-30 04:35:37 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ LaRussa was pretty robotic. every pitcher has a role. 2 setup guys (lefty and a righty) in the 8th inning. a dominant closer for 9th. 2 long relievers. and 1 lefty specialist just to get that 1 out.  on offense, he waits for that big homer from his juicers.
1321911268509282304 2020-10-30 04:26:20 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RexChapman @Michael_Fabiano she is adorable!
1321909748233498624 2020-10-30 04:20:18 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ @FantasyReserve I remember he had 1 good year with Winslow and they were both frauds after that. Kept fooling me for 2 more years. Dark days of fantasy
1321909114620895232 2020-10-30 04:17:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF @FantasyPros I buy that!

1321884116787159041 2020-10-30 02:38:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Necromancian @espn Amare was da man in NY. his talent just disappear once Melo came on-board. totally wasted Amare's talent. Melo was a bad fit in NY.  he ain't no HOFer in my mind.
1321877521156075521 2020-10-30 02:12:14 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SteveNFL_ LOL.
1321877250157936641 2020-10-30 02:11:10 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SportsCenter Never under-estimate the offensive mind of Adam Gase. if there's 1 guy who can make the Jets to score -3 points, it's him.
1321876716134936576 2020-10-30 02:09:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @espn Knicks should have fired Melo a long time ago. Melo was garbage. if bernard king is not a HOFer, neither is Melo.
1321860137368252424 2020-10-30 01:03:10 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FieldYates @AdamSchefter Is he going to Tampa too?
1321851945930248192 2020-10-30 00:30:37 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyMikeBBF personally, i like Jalen Guyton because i have Herbert. but i dropped Guyton for E. Sanders hoping that MT won't be effective even if he returns. he may pissed off many teammates.
1321849729634824192 2020-10-30 00:21:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @rotoworld that's hard to believe. pretty sure minshew will yell "ouch" each time he throws. but jags ignored his pain thru out all these time. its just an excuse to bench his poor performance.
1321849233654259712 2020-10-30 00:19:50 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TheeRobWait @SWallace_FF LOL. maybe going back to mitch will be the answer?

1321692133435166720 2020-10-29 13:55:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter Just IR Chris Godwin! Start throwing to Evans more
1321691882276102145 2020-10-29 13:54:35 +0800 <sugarknight33> @LegionHoops That’s the end of Ben Simmons In philly. He can play center but he can’t shoot 3s. To morey, that’s a no no.
1321676084136407040 2020-10-29 12:51:48 +0800 <sugarknight33> @DetroitBeastie @SWallace_FF Targets don't matter if Mooney doesn't expand his catch radius; he needs longer arms or spider-webs.

1321673087549497345 2020-10-29 12:39:54 +0800 <sugarknight33> @brycingthepuck @FantasyPros as long as you dropped Brady for another stud QB, like a herbert, that will be fine. that will be a great combo : herbert+allen.
1321672742853251072 2020-10-29 12:38:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NoisyHuevos wine, marriage, and butter?
1321672484245049345 2020-10-29 12:37:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @kalebivy_FF had defense actually been keying/doubling on Mike Evans instead of Godwin thru out the first 7 games? that's really hard to believe.
1321671979124944902 2020-10-29 12:35:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator congrats!

1321616971490754560 2020-10-29 08:56:55 +0800 <sugarknight33> @TripleDFFP maybe better than higgins, but definitely NOT better than jefferson. Your HC is still Gase.

1321612373963071489 2020-10-29 08:38:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @PTI @SportsCenter @RealMikeWilbon go hire a robot as a manager, it's cheaper to replace Kevin Cash if he can't make decisions without numbers.
1321611534896803840 2020-10-29 08:35:18 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator they are in AFC. so nope. they won't get passed chiefs.

I get all that. Running QBs will break down in a few years because they took many hits or many foot/ankle injury. can LJ throw to 2nd reads once he slows down.

1321147772154769408 2020-10-28 01:52:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AllMurphedUp @AlexF0721 @CoachJHerbert @BigTruzzJack @DezBryant it's pretty hard to live up to that career year.  and we are seeing how he regress this year.  i am not saying he is a bad player by any means. LJ is better than RG3, VY, those type of QBs where they just takes off if the 1st option isn't open.  hope LJ will get better next year
1321146194869956608 2020-10-28 01:46:13 +0800 <sugarknight33> @fmillerusa @BigTruzzJack @DezBryant Raiders still have a bigger fan base and better tradition than those dirty crows.

1321140210231459842 2020-10-28 01:22:26 +0800 <sugarknight33> @CoachJHerbert @BigTruzzJack @DezBryant you are just on denial. u can be smarter than a coconut if you stop smoking weeds. watch this year. has he improved as a QB? can he make throws to WRs consistently? teams will expose him in the playoff again this year. take away his TEs and he is doomed.

1319848553519329281 2020-10-24 11:49:51 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Michael_Fabiano Evans should request a trade!
1319844957146943488 2020-10-24 11:35:33 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MikeClayNFL Wish jameis is still the QB, he knows how to use Evans
1319844668104790016 2020-10-24 11:34:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy No, u are wrong, and here’s why. Evans is a deep threat, boom or bust anyways. He won’t get impacted as much as Godwin. AB will catch the short and medium passes. He gets open much quicker than Godwin. Godwin will suffer, watch!
1319843146721755136 2020-10-24 11:28:22 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jessejordan03 @BufordPusser5 @FantasyPros I think Godwin might be the odd man out. He would be a great trade chip.
1319842479215046658 2020-10-24 11:25:43 +0800 <sugarknight33> @nick_crockett @Delyet_Sium @FantasyPros U do know AB is a complete WR, right? He can easily operate the middle as well as going deep. He will affect Godwin.
1319840931957239809 2020-10-24 11:19:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Atroubledmind @FantasyPros That’s what u think. It won’t affect Evans as he is boom or bust anyways. Brown operates more in the middle, that will take away Godwin’s looks.
1319821127657484289 2020-10-24 10:00:52 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MrStark84 @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy Have defense really been doubling Evans?
1319820790863261698 2020-10-24 09:59:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @mason_routhier8 @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy I bet Evans missed frizmagic and his boy jameis
1319820538341068802 2020-10-24 09:58:32 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Sjoberg99 @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy Oh yeah, AB is suspended for 8 games. So he will have time to learn.
1319805752110764032 2020-10-24 08:59:46 +0800 <sugarknight33> @baselmarcus @FantasyPros I doubt it. Arians like big slots
1319792056491859968 2020-10-24 08:05:21 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Sjoberg99 @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy Took 5 days to get AB going last time
1319776549520900098 2020-10-24 07:03:44 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ @gregcosell Aaron Jones is just questionable. so good chance he will play this sunday.

1319775879644418048 2020-10-24 07:01:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Q25Cheke @NoisyHuevos flip him in a hurry, before he found out AB isn't goinh to seattle.
1319775736949927937 2020-10-24 07:00:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NoisyHuevos @MrShaneBradley will Scotty M. be affected?
1319775547572928512 2020-10-24 06:59:45 +0800 <sugarknight33> @rjmacts @NoisyHuevos @josiahsp AB is more for the middle. so Evans might be the one with the real role (just deep threat).  Godwin will suffer.
1319773369537974272 2020-10-24 06:51:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet The real winner here is @Keenan13Allen . he is way better than that overrated, big for nothing @MikeEvans13_ .  look at how many catches and yards Keenan is getting over grandpa Evans?
1319770518967312384 2020-10-24 06:39:46 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ndsports3 @FAmmiranteTFJ i missed Jameis....

1319769441614245888 2020-10-24 06:35:29 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ndsports3 @FAmmiranteTFJ has Godwin been a stud this year? 4 for 7 for 57 yds. i don't think Godwin has been killing it either.
1319768825395462144 2020-10-24 06:33:02 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ @gregcosell dont' they have Williams as the next man up? Dillion is just going to hop over him?
1319768361971011585 2020-10-24 06:31:12 +0800 <sugarknight33> @ndsports3 @FAmmiranteTFJ i don't think it will help Godwin. AB will eat all the middle passes.  Evans will get the deep shots. real loser here are Godwin and scotty.
1319767926111563776 2020-10-24 06:29:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ there goes my Evans....

1319767322710609921 2020-10-24 06:27:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @NoisyHuevos there goes Scotty miller's job.
1319766787601223680 2020-10-24 06:24:56 +0800 <sugarknight33> @RapSheet come on man, why TB? we got scotty miller already!

Wentz played his heart out every game! but if record continue to slide, they are going to look at Hurts. and you can see Dougie is starting to yank Wentz out in red zone for Hurts here and there.
1319684455955456001 2020-10-24 00:57:47 +0800 <sugarknight33> @chesaboudin Worst DA ever. sides with Criminals and thugs over common residents!  won't protect public safety. let stores got robbed until they force to shut the door down for good. AWFUL AWFUL DA. u suck Chesa! U suck!

I don't know what you said to the victims or push victims to select restorative justice, but crimes spike during your ERA as DA. you need to take ownership and back the victims back and also make criminals pay for their actions.
1319387177650843648 2020-10-23 05:16:30 +0800 <sugarknight33> @chesaboudin @elpais_america is there a way to vote you out of the office?
1319387086219165696 2020-10-23 05:16:09 +0800 <sugarknight33> @chesaboudin you allow robbery to happen and now you help victims. Child Pls!  U should be fired. U no help to victims!
1319386741791309824 2020-10-23 05:14:46 +0800 <sugarknight33> @chesaboudin You are a fraud of a DA. 0 justice for victims. You are terrible!

1319383693954142209 2020-10-23 05:02:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JPFinlayNBCS are you kidding? look at the Jets! i rather have Darnold or former elite Flacco than Haskins.  who can he beat out ?  AFC South ... Minshew? Nope.  Rivers? Nope   AFC West ... none.  AFC East? darnold? Nope   AFC North? baker? Nope   NFC West/South? Hell NO!  NFC North/ East? No.

1319362667480379392 2020-10-23 03:39:07 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FAmmiranteTFJ guess you have no faith in Jones to get some TDs.

1319361494769750018 2020-10-23 03:34:27 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyPros @davidgiardino Analytics are all based on history. it has no weights on the future.U should still trust your guts and go with your decisions. don't follow trends or else you will always be reactive and end up chasing points.

1319285021354545155 2020-10-22 22:30:34 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator @FantasyPros Personally, either are fine options, can’t go wrong now that Matt has Julio back. I just like a mobile QB that can do everything.
1319283961164558340 2020-10-22 22:26:22 +0800 <sugarknight33> @mattgr8house @FantasyPros Not sure what’s going on with lions. They turn into a running team.
1319283535002284034 2020-10-22 22:24:40 +0800 <sugarknight33> @mattgr8house @FantasyPros Ur WRs are set. Ur true 1 is fuller . And then cooper. Very close between woods and Golladay for ur wr3 spot. Are u in ppr? Robby Anderson will be wr3 if it’s ppr. Woods for standard. Woods is like a td machine this year.

1319158703442948096 2020-10-22 14:08:38 +0800 <sugarknight33> @JamelLajuan that's a shame.  now i know T-Rich will never be as great as Michael Bush.

1319137582991568896 2020-10-22 12:44:42 +0800 <sugarknight33> @FantasyPros Bell or shenault?
1319136663688208384 2020-10-22 12:41:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SportsCenter @AdamSchefter Let’s hope he can finally go back to the raiders
1319135669705297920 2020-10-22 12:37:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @brainsnorts @Cianaf Mobile? He ran almost 100 yds last game
1319133350674583552 2020-10-22 12:27:53 +0800 <sugarknight33> @jetsxfactor Trade him in the offseason, u don’t want that team to be suddenly good because of Sam.
1319116310345773057 2020-10-22 11:20:11 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy i am banking that CEH + Bell will easily score over 25 pts vs the broncos.
1319115776373133312 2020-10-22 11:18:03 +0800 <sugarknight33> @EditsLCzin @TBBuccaneersBR @Buccaneers @BucsnewsBR @bucsbroficial @portalbucsbr @TampaBucs_BR Last year's bucs team seems more fun to watch. Jameis is a better gun-slinger than Brady. Brady plays too safe.
1319113021524901888 2020-10-22 11:07:06 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SeahawksVOL @MatthewBerryTMR no way Miami wants Dalton. You better include couple of 3rd rounds.

1319068556311449600 2020-10-22 08:10:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @SportsCenter @SECNetwork T-Rich can read holes? i thought he just like to run over his own O-Line like he did with the Raiders and Colts.
1319067299169538049 2020-10-22 08:05:25 +0800 <sugarknight33> @AdamSchefter Don’t they have my boy josh Gordon?

1318718810665349120 2020-10-21 09:00:39 +0800 <sugarknight33> @MichaelFFlorio @NFLFantasy You should be fired as a fantasy analyst. No one recommends Chris Herndon. No one.

1317352959114539010 2020-10-17 14:33:15 +0800 <sugarknight33> @BDFinRF149 It’s great that we finally let him go.
1317351755655491585 2020-10-17 14:28:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @currythecreator @FantasyPros Let’s hope firing the head coach will start something beautiful in Atlanta
1317333032362156033 2020-10-17 13:14:04 +0800 <sugarknight33> @Hoosier_Boy @YoKweav if you watch the game, Trey Burton is the starter. Coach was the one who kept Cox as a blocker. you blame the coach, not Rivers on that one.
1317331371321221120 2020-10-17 13:07:28 +0800 <sugarknight33> @WEEI Cam is cheaper. Patriots ain't overpaying that statue QB.
