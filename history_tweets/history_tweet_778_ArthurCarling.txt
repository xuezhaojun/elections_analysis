For example Chesterfield got disciplined for racist abuse of opposition keeper even tho there was no racist abuse, just the usual verbal that all keepers get. Football in the U.K. does not have a racism issue

1323549072087830530 2020-11-03 16:54:23 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @TerryWelbanks @RealJamesWoods Many are voting Trump coz he‚Äôs not entered into foreign wars killing millions of people. Unlike the previous president that dropped a bomb every 8 minutes

1323531485106810882 2020-11-03 15:44:30 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @taranoodle Women not vote?? That‚Äôs a crazy question. Of course they should vote! I think Britain envy Trumps patriotic stance, putting America and its people first.

1323384279590719491 2020-11-03 05:59:34 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @Tattooed_Mummy @taranoodle Fair enough üëç

1323379929208279047 2020-11-03 05:42:16 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @samanthamarika1 @Amanda64white Coz they can
1323378524313571333 2020-11-03 05:36:42 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @taranoodle Why Biden?
1323378025828929538 2020-11-03 05:34:43 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @mistydog @ExBROUGH @tartansinatra @JeremyVineOn5 Yeah of course. But on a discussion show like Jeremy vine it‚Äôs unlikely there‚Äôll be a topic that is simply black or white, that‚Äôs the whole point of it being a debate, each topic is their to be discussed and every guest and caller will have different opinions.

1323035436663660548 2020-11-02 06:53:23 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @oosterom_m @JoeBiden Agreed. I take everything with a pinch of salt, mainstream media or social media.. believe nothing trust no one.
1323035187182186519 2020-11-02 06:52:24 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @oosterom_m @JoeBiden I agree with everything you say.. Trumps attack on the media and big tech is justified.. You have to wonder why they are so anti trump....
1323034771371532289 2020-11-02 06:50:44 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @mrdrowzy @richard_brown20 @LBC So it‚Äôs not an anti black policy, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying. It‚Äôs an anti criminal, anti knife crime policy that is all. If you want to see less black young people getting stabbed you‚Äôd support it
1323034302452518922 2020-11-02 06:48:53 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @oosterom_m @JoeBiden At least you‚Äôve took the time to look into the possibility, which is more than most. If then you don‚Äôt buy into that‚Äôs fair enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è

1323033616843198470 2020-11-02 06:46:09 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @oosterom_m @JoeBiden I see Trump doing amazing things prior to Covid, blazing economy, no wars, opportunity zones, jobs, and not being bought out by the globalists.. I think the virus was sent to trip him up and it‚Äôs worked to a degree. What‚Äôs your opinion on the vid?
1323029462024441857 2020-11-02 06:29:39 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @Pen_Duick @christopherhope Not true, they come from various background and politic beliefs

1321399731692670977 2020-10-28 18:33:41 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @Camz_Rozay @LBC I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs a sad fact, the hot spot areas of London Knife crime are mostly black communities. So when patrolling these areas you are naturally stopping more black people. But the reason isn‚Äôt coz they‚Äôre black, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a hot spot area

I listen to sensible conservative voices in US and they don‚Äôt seem like religious nuts

You can be conservative without being religious you know. You seem quite happy to generalise whole groups of people. All conservatives are religious, all conservatives are bad. My advice is open your mind more and enter into more dialogue

1316079830404870146 2020-10-14 02:14:17 +0800 <ArthurCarling> @ThomasVerstynen I‚Äôm not bothered about right or left but it‚Äôs suspiciously frustrating that the MSM don‚Äôt give this poor little fella any air time. You have to admit if a young black boy was executed by a white man it would be all over the news for months. You can‚Äôt deny this wd b the case
