1342174471239700480 2020-12-25 02:25:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> absolutely shocked that trump did not in fact manage to outflank everyone from the left and that his announcement was not made out of the goodness of his heart
1341952169348624385 2020-12-24 11:41:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CamusKatamari @Pangaea__ Yeah I mean there‚Äôs certainly a legit debate to be had about competency for these types of positions, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gotta get reduced down to ‚Äúzomg libs just hate workers‚Äù‚Äîor ‚Äúlol lefties just want to hire randos to run everything,‚Äù for that matter.

1341680806713028609 2020-12-23 17:43:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SocialistBoomer there‚Äôs reason to critique trump‚Äôs actions (like the fact that he‚Äôs only speaking up to demand more *now* when benefits are so close to running out w/o a new stimulus) but at this point the ball is strictly in McConnell‚Äôs court so rejecting it outright as she did makes no sense.
1341645648853159937 2020-12-23 15:23:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @memeguider how do you get to that level with no following back random accounts smh

1341599553443799040 2020-12-23 12:20:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @soylent_slut bold of you to ever expect socialistMMA to have a good take
1341599016400904193 2020-12-23 12:18:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @soylent_slut I was heavily into it during the summer and there are a lot of great 1.12 modpacks out there, no idea about the newer stuff
1341598403898314763 2020-12-23 12:15:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RiceRecession the democrats passed $2000 checks through the house back in may so they‚Äôd be utterly foolish to let this chance slip through their fingers
1341594542265516033 2020-12-23 12:00:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @boredlacanian @LittleKeegs0 @The_Ohioan_ @soylent_slut well Minecraft is a sandbox game so that kinda comes with the territory, but there are several modpacks like Regrowth which include narrative and questing elements. I personally view the vanilla game as just one part of what Minecraft is overall.
1341593926906593280 2020-12-23 11:58:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @boredlacanian @LittleKeegs0 @soylent_slut the default textures have improved in recent updates, and there are a ton of different texture packs like Sphax and John Smith with completely different aesthetics.

1341542658095919105 2020-12-23 08:34:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> hmm maybe we should actually work *with* the fascists to destroy the establishment, I foresee no negative consequences from this strategy whatsoever
1341541729779003392 2020-12-23 08:30:47 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @VitalistInt for the far-right, creating a ‚Äúbetter life‚Äù means cleansing the country of nonwhites and other groups they consider degenerate.

Just because they value it doesn‚Äôt make it a dealbreaker.

1340485945523617792 2020-12-20 10:35:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> in short, this whole thing is what happens when you think being mad online is a form of praxis.
1340485555801513985 2020-12-20 10:33:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> personally I think it‚Äôs a sign of the times when the best people can do when other people have disagreements is act like they‚Äôre being personally attacked or it‚Äôs some kind of betrayal. it‚Äôs incredibly obnoxious and making that kind of response is likely to cause real alienation.
1340485061305577475 2020-12-20 10:31:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> also, the people who have spent the past year treating all these leftist media figures like they‚Äôre their parents or best friends or whatever clearly need a reality check if this is the first time they‚Äôve seen any drama unfold. *none* of them are infallible arbiters of politics.

And I‚Äôll even wager that plenty of the bills that have passed the house would never have gone through if both chambers and the presidency were dem-controlled.

It‚Äôs just another version of the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt defend Biden against all criticism you‚Äôre a republican!!‚Äù schtick.

I never mentioned ‚Äúgetting along with her,‚Äù that‚Äôs got nothing to do with the indisputable fact that right now, progressives do *not* have the numbers in the house to successfully pull this off. It accomplishes nothing.
1339969532581048321 2020-12-19 00:23:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GraeMatterz @goodyweaver @Nitzky89 Nope, because those co-sponsors don‚Äôt even hold a majority in Congress. And even if it does pass, it will matter very little once McConnell does the same thing he‚Äôs been doing for the past two years and stonewalls the whole thing.

For that same reason, the current cosponsors can vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù regardless of whether they actually support it or not because they know it will never actually matter.

Most people in the U.S. are completely disengaged from all of this stuff so it really only affects the minority on Twitter.

1339842089060880384 2020-12-18 15:57:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SocialistBoomer exactly, it was illustrative of how far those pundits were willing to tweak the narrative to downplay sanders' success, but it also had a pretty big grain of truth that ended up sinking his campaign.
1339840351683682304 2020-12-18 15:50:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RandProgressive @SocialistBoomer sure but at a certain point you have to look at the way things are and figure out a way to navigate the political landscape to score victories in the future, and to me it seems like some people would rather use that as an excuse to wallow in rage and deflect reasonable criticism.
1339839498595807232 2020-12-18 15:46:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NotGyro @SocialistBoomer yeah i totally agree with that, there's a definite danger of his loss being represented as proof that progressivism has no traction among dem voters. it seems to me that the real issue is getting that support to translate to votes and not messing up with key demographics.
1339838387365228549 2020-12-18 15:42:19 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SocialistBoomer people were annoyed that the moderate candidates consolidated their voteshare around biden, which sucks, but it's hardly evidence of "rigging" like they seem to think it was. sometimes you just don't have the support ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1339808534066831361 2020-12-18 13:43:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis oh, so now giving people healthcare *isn't* a real progressive goal? wow, i'll have to tell literally everyone on here that their entire argument is completely wrong because one random account invalidated their political strategy.
1339808122853060609 2020-12-18 13:42:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis how the fuck is that any different than the same old right-wing shit mainstream republicans have been pushing for decades? you really must've internalized the "republicans used to be polite in the good ol' days" myth huh.
1339807794766213120 2020-12-18 13:40:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis does obamacare still exist? it's a perfectly simple question that you've repeatedly refused to address.
1339807671181078529 2020-12-18 13:40:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @badvibesnochill there are plenty of studies that have shown that outcomes are objectively, measurably better when more of the people in charge of an institution are women, but sure it's *totally* just idpol nonsense!

1339806062493507586 2020-12-18 13:33:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Princez2593 seems like "it was rigged!!!" has been the answer to a whole lot of progressive failures this past year. at a certain point you have to stop wallowing in rage and actually think about how to succeed next time.
1339805691364724736 2020-12-18 13:32:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @BenBurgis you're the one who started making personal attacks first, so save me the performative outrage.  https://t.co/mVCz37wg6j
1339805360207622146 2020-12-18 13:31:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis the problem with your argument is that you keep changing what the end goal is. you said "pushing votes works, there is no downside" using them as an example, but then you just shifted to "gaining influence" regardless of the downsides i mentioned.
1339804780445769729 2020-12-18 13:28:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis saying "well the tea partiers held a bunch of performative votes on obamacare and gained influence!!" as a reason why progressives should do the same thing with m4a ignores that the tea partiers *never actually got that done* besides failing votes. pick a more successful example.
1339804327557427201 2020-12-18 13:26:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @BenBurgis do you even know what a "strawman" is? this reply makes no sense.
1339791386204368898 2020-12-18 12:35:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @sparrowos32 @BenBurgis the only way you could say that is if you have no idea how *any* of this stuff works.
1339791173846745088 2020-12-18 12:34:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @BenBurgis acting condescending to people who aren't immediately cowed by your *stunning* conversational skills isn't gonna convince anyone. if progressives only care about power but not accomplishing their stated goals...isn't that exactly what dore and others have been criticizing?

1339741340003934209 2020-12-18 09:16:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jdouglaslittle @SocialistBoomer I think that‚Äôs similar, but typically it‚Äôs done for fantasy settings rather than history.

1339740087899316224 2020-12-18 09:11:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @sparrowos32 @Czernobog @BenBurgis I mean ‚Äúviable‚Äù as in able to get passed. The GOP‚Äôs ploy to abolish the ACA could‚Äôve worked (even though it obviously would‚Äôve screwed over thousands of people), but they lost when they failed to marshal legislative support.
1339739725121400835 2020-12-18 09:10:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @BenBurgis But they never actually accomplished their stated centerpiece goals like abolishing the ACA (and are currently in the process of devolving into QAnon madness), and I‚Äôd like to think progressives are interested in actually, y‚Äôknow, making progress.
1339715380072361990 2020-12-18 07:33:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jdouglaslittle @SocialistBoomer in online discourse, people generally use it as a pejorative term for someone pretending to be something they're not.
1339714924860370945 2020-12-18 07:31:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jdouglaslittle @SocialistBoomer it's short for live-action roleplaying, and its original meaning is a type of game where a group of people wear costumes and act like characters they create to participate in an agreed-upon fantasy world with props, costumes, and things like that.
1339714042462650370 2020-12-18 07:28:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Czernobog @BenBurgis and where is obamacare now? oh right, it still exists, because for all the far-right's hysterical rhetoric and political theater, they were too stupid to actually come up with a viable alternative. but sure, let's emulate their example, right?
1339713716049371136 2020-12-18 07:26:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Comrade_Puppy @BenBurgis "instead of listening to other people's arguments and explanations when they already agree with me on the same societal principles, i'm going to accuse them of being fake leftists and neoliberal shills"
1339709127535292420 2020-12-18 07:08:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jdouglaslittle @SocialistBoomer the problem is that those people aren't real revolutionaries either, otherwise they simply wouldn't care about electoral politics at all and focus on mutual aid and preparing for insurrection. they're just LARPing to disguise their lack of pragmatism.

1338290387027451906 2020-12-14 09:11:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 16. @RX_Unavailable recommended this one to me awhile ago and it's outside my usual genre but i love it both from both a musical and political standpoint  https://t.co/qRCz5gADrA
1338289829751218176 2020-12-14 09:08:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 15. this is a fun one, i really like the singer's voice and the beat and honestly it's just a solid song overall  https://t.co/l6EbdgCfNc

1338254743114829826 2020-12-14 06:49:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 14. i have literally listened to this over and over just to hear the moment at 4:11 happen, it's such a perfect climax for a song  https://t.co/yDekKkHwyG

1338253314245480448 2020-12-14 06:43:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 13. i really get "revenge training montage" from this and it's very energetic all the way through  https://t.co/0z4ZUR6uZH

1338252867602411522 2020-12-14 06:42:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 12. it has a very peaceful vibe, like you can just sit and breathe with it and you won't fall asleep but it's very calming  https://t.co/qX3XfvQOMV

1338252156856635393 2020-12-14 06:39:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 10. i guess this also counts as a showtune? i really see it as its own standalone thing since it's a vibe on its own merits  https://t.co/ka973yl2Ug
1338251941680439300 2020-12-14 06:38:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 9. totally different from the other ones since it's so quiet and low-key but it hits different when you're in the hardee's drivethrough at 11 pm feeling the ennui of seasonal depression, and covid depression, and regular depression, etc  https://t.co/v0KPHlS323
1338251588473905152 2020-12-14 06:36:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 8. ok yes this is a showtune and it really is a nostalgia thing for me but the singer is also objectively amazing  https://t.co/4WTT3yZXtq
1338251376665751555 2020-12-14 06:36:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 7. it's kind of frantic but also really fast and tight in a way which helps me focus really well  https://t.co/s88XNb93eE
1338251113028612096 2020-12-14 06:35:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 6. this one deserves to be on the list just for the feels but it's also genuinely a good song, kinda reminds me of ghosts  https://t.co/5f7vW7vGHy
1338250876515921920 2020-12-14 06:34:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 5. i feel like this goes without saying but the guitar part towards the end is ‚àû/10  https://t.co/V5yAJN30DW
1338250598748139525 2020-12-14 06:33:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 4. everything by @FuryWeekend is good and this is no exception, i really like how the vocals and instrumentals mesh and progress off of each other  https://t.co/4W8VCR8tCO
1338250273333129218 2020-12-14 06:31:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 3. genuinely evokes physical images of mind control and going feral, idk how to explain it any better but it‚Äôs a total trip  https://t.co/z63i0842FL
1338250130294771716 2020-12-14 06:31:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 2. I‚Äôve liked @siamesmusicsince I found ‚Äúthe wolf‚Äù awhile ago and this one is kind of growly but also clear-sounding, it‚Äôs just really interesting  https://t.co/Uj9K88zLfA
1338250004775964674 2020-12-14 06:30:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 1. pure 100 proof vibes, also makes me want to do the Michael Jackson moonwalk thing for some reason  https://t.co/8yFilHFeLB
1338248207864881162 2020-12-14 06:23:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I realized after like song number five that it‚Äôd be better if I included explanations of why I like these songs so here‚Äôs that I guess

1338226841199501315 2020-12-14 04:58:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @_jack_fox_ @Charlie_Deuter the ‚Äúpopulist left‚Äù has a theory of change which relies on the self-evident righteousness of their cause being sufficient proof that it already has vast popular support, so any evidence that shows they‚Äôre not as influential as they think has to be dismissed or discredited.

1338209179589349381 2020-12-14 03:48:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @the_binp @nataliereed84 yeah, it‚Äôs off-putting to consider that cyberpunk will at some point join the ranks of 50s futurism and the works of Jules Verne but it actually seems kinda fitting.

1338206201394458625 2020-12-14 03:36:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nataliereed84 my handle belies my interest in solarpunk as the ‚Äúhip new alternative‚Äù since it‚Äôs more optimistic and focused on solving modern issues like climate collapse and inequality, but it‚Äôs not really a 1:1 comparison tbh. like it‚Äôd make no sense to just change the palette and add solar
1338205639756091397 2020-12-14 03:34:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nataliereed84 it seems like there‚Äôs been a flattening of cyberpunk from the get-go‚Äîbut especially in recent years‚Äîinto an aesthetic of neon kanji signs, hologram ads, rainy cityscapes, etc. kinda weird to think of how a ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù genre could become dated but I guess it‚Äôs kinda true now.

1338202604690681866 2020-12-14 03:22:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @charlietwerk69 personally I feel like my political perspective has gradually become less ‚Äúradical for the sake of being radical‚Äù even though I still believe in the same ideological principles, kind of like it was when I got into atheism vs where I am now with it (still agreeing with it but not

1337894480750501888 2020-12-13 06:57:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BlDEN2020 the problem is that people who believe this stuff have internalized the idea that voting is the most important expression of their moral compass and providing support to anything less than their exact agenda is an affront to their personal character.

1337581115448627203 2020-12-12 10:12:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @beckness honestly this is true, as much as i find the idea of "building a brand" on here interesting it's never been the reason i'm on twitter; that's just to have fun w/folks and relax. plus i feel like if i actually posted as frequently as some people on here do my brain would explode

1336493925620719618 2020-12-09 10:12:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the new hot take sparking discourse of the online left seems to be that common political labels "progressive," "leftist," "antifascist" etc are inherently suspicious somehow, and i'd just like to say that if your bio has any self-descriptive words in it i don't trust you a bit üò§

1336452264207257605 2020-12-09 07:27:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @evancholerton @not_devy to me it seems targeted at the people who smugly say "both parties are the same" and insist that their microlabeled hyper-niche ideology is the only political division that matters. for most people, political discourse is much less skewed by internet jargon.
1336450522799349760 2020-12-09 07:20:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @evancholerton @not_devy the tweet doesn't say "voting is all there is to politics," it says there are two major political parties, which is correct.

1335736344765755394 2020-12-07 08:02:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BingusSuicide i sure hope the bit about illiteracy is hyperbolic. historically, leftist movements supported education expansion for a reason. being unable to read is more of a prison than a classroom ever could be.

1335429672952328192 2020-12-06 11:43:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RosaTheCommie @Th0risy literally when did I mention any of them turning ‚Äúbarbaric?‚Äù it‚Äôs just pretty obvious when they fail to achieve the stated aims of their ideology.  same point applies, those situations occurred in peripheral areas, not a highly economically developed area of the imperial core.
1335429251072450560 2020-12-06 11:41:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LVKVD making blanket assertions with no evidence sure isn‚Äôt useful
1335429068368572417 2020-12-06 11:41:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this is the Rick and Morty ‚Äúhigh IQ‚Äù copypasta of Twitter leftism
1335428240895315968 2020-12-06 11:37:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LVKVD @Th0risy @Adamrothod saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs never worked‚Äù is different from just saying there‚Äôs no evidence for it working. and at this point in time, anyone who thinks revolution is possible in the US right now is even more delusional.
1335427909545291777 2020-12-06 11:36:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RosaTheCommie @Th0risy there is never going to be a glorious military struggle against the forces of capitalism or whatever blood-drenched fantasy some of the weirdos on here keep pushing. the only successful leftist revolutions occurred in peripheral rural societies and quickly became bureaucratic.

1333892707320737803 2020-12-02 05:56:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I‚Äôm down for all the NYC bashing going on rn but we are *not* gonna use this as an opportunity to rehabilitate the disfigured casserole abomination that is ‚Äúdeep-dish pizza‚Äù

1333880228905701378 2020-12-02 05:06:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ExistentialEnso it‚Äôs purely based on Twitter drama, there‚Äôs no actual policy analysis whatsoever lol

1333878291204366338 2020-12-02 04:59:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MenAtWork_MC @lilykraxberger what does this even mean lol, what point are you trying to make here
1333877398664777728 2020-12-02 04:55:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> using an abacus to calculate the best ratio of lesbians and transmascs for society to function
1333874306783305728 2020-12-02 04:43:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CateSJewels she and sirota love qt‚Äôing small accounts that argue with them for some reason, and it‚Äôs like, don‚Äôt you have anything better to do? they‚Äôre supposed to uphold a certain image for their political cadre and right now it‚Äôs not going too well.
1333874008320774146 2020-12-02 04:42:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garethdmm I mean sure but between this and the ‚Äúit‚Äôd be fine if he tried a coup as long as he gave us all checks beforehand‚Äù thing it‚Äôs becoming a very annoying pattern that‚Äôs bad-faith at best.
1333867616658747393 2020-12-02 04:16:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MichiganSock isn‚Äôt this the ‚Äúwomen think me having 4K Twitter followers makes me hot‚Äù guy
1333861213512601602 2020-12-02 03:51:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ScubaForDogs like if we were analyzing Trump and Biden as individuals I see what you‚Äôre saying but in terms of actual outcomes in political battles I don‚Äôt see it.
1333861035929899008 2020-12-02 03:50:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ScubaForDogs not really though because I can‚Äôt recall one case of trump not going along with the far-right people in his admin and congress who are much more ideologically committed to their goals. *maybe* the thing with Iran counts but that‚Äôs a stretch imo.
1333858026286166016 2020-12-02 03:38:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ScubaForDogs trump was *personally* indifferent to it but he was happy to listen to Paul Ryan who‚Äôd be absolutely thrilled to gut it because of his whole ayn rand fanboy thing. All these ‚Äúthe right isn‚Äôt really our enemy, libs are‚Äù claims just remind me of Greenwald and his grift.
1333855943231156225 2020-12-02 03:30:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garethdmm see I agree with the first part of that point but the second one just tars the whole thing with nonsense. anyone saying ‚Äúwe should work together with the right to destroy liberals‚Äù just seems sus to me tbh
1333854879916417025 2020-12-02 03:25:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ScubaForDogs he isn‚Äôt personally committed to any ideological position but it should be pretty clear at this point that he‚Äôs not gonna change tack and start offering concessions to the left, nor was it ever a salient observation that he technically *could*.
1333854434875633672 2020-12-02 03:24:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garethdmm after all the shit that‚Äôs gone down with far-right attacks on protesters I can‚Äôt fathom making any ‚Äúwell you gotta hand it to him‚Äù style posts but maybe that‚Äôs just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1333854078217097218 2020-12-02 03:22:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garethdmm that‚Äôs just, like, not even slightly true lol
1333854019475935233 2020-12-02 03:22:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @beckness honestly this kind of whiny rhetoric reminds me more of Glenn Greenwald than anything else. I‚Äôd get it if this was a one-time ‚Äúthought exercise‚Äù but she‚Äôs said stuff like this before and it‚Äôs sort of becoming a pattern.
1333853018836660226 2020-12-02 03:18:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @logrif23 @MichiganSock she‚Äôs not nearly as far along in the greenwaldification process
1333852636991385604 2020-12-02 03:17:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BDU_Rodrigues @MichiganSock @TransformedMe ‚Äúno you guys don‚Äôt get it this is SATIRE!!1!‚Äù *furious jacking off motions*
1333852306958405639 2020-12-02 03:15:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I get being bitter about how Biden‚Äôs campaign has done things and appealed more to moderates than progressives, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to make stupid claims like this and in doing so make the rest of us look stupid too.
1333852007774482442 2020-12-02 03:14:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> my favorite part of ‚Äútrump reaching out to the left‚Äù was when he told the proud boys to ‚Äústand by‚Äù to stop antifa from taking over the country, as all good leftists agree that is a realistic problem to fearmonger about
1333851652818956297 2020-12-02 03:13:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> how are we still doing the ‚ÄúTrump is secretly left-wing‚Äù schtick in December of 2020 lmfao

1333580448191164417 2020-12-01 09:15:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @paddingtonposts - groupthink is just as annoying when it comes from leftists on here as when it comes from the liberal contingent - men are hot - the new star wars sequels aren't *amazing* but they're not nearly as bad as people say they are

1333164622061445121 2020-11-30 05:43:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AnarchoPill what‚Äôs especially funny about it is that science is explicitly NOT ‚Äúimmortal.‚Äù if a theory fails to hold up in the face of new observations, it has to be either modified or discarded altogether. clinging to a discredited ideology out of spite is the furthest thing from science.

1332780459986661377 2020-11-29 04:16:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> like obviously it‚Äôs good to have a coherent idea of what these terms refer to in a general sense, but they should be applied descriptively rather than prescriptively and acknowledge the current conditions in the real world rather than ignoring them.
1332779831830962181 2020-11-29 04:14:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> imo, gatekeeping broad labels like ‚Äúleftist‚Äù is a complete waste of time when anyone who actually talks about political theory to people they know irl can assure you that the vast majority of people in the rest of society don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt care.
1332779026839171072 2020-11-29 04:10:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AnarchoPill saw a post about how we should draw and quarter Jeff Bezos next to one urging that we extend the olive branch to active white supremacists lol

1332507655278047232 2020-11-28 10:12:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> white people cannot celebrate columbus day, it is a closed practice of italianx culture which y'all need to stop appropriating

1332502750479986688 2020-11-28 09:53:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Cirred11 @HueofJoe these people constantly rake "liberals" over the coals for treating politics like a team sport rather than something that actually affects people's lives but then get up to the same exact shit using different buzzwords to justify it

1332088141696684039 2020-11-27 06:25:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> hey folks we should probably be referring to the harvest feast family celebration day as ‚Äúthxnksgxvxng‚Äù to support gender equality jsyk!!
1332083336001490945 2020-11-27 06:06:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AntifaSarkeesi3 @ExistentialEnso yeah I‚Äôd probably get a very different impression of it now, I was really closer to a (right-wing) libertarian at the time than anything so it was a wake up call that ‚Äúhey, regulating businesses is good actually‚Äù
1332081549660073987 2020-11-27 05:59:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mostlyadam @ExistentialEnso As we all know, the right has never used leftist uprisings (or even the imagined threat of them) as an excuse to crack down on their political opponents and society in general!
1332081110306664448 2020-11-27 05:57:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AntifaSarkeesi3 @ExistentialEnso since reading ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù was a big part of what made me start to reconsider my own political beliefs, this cuts deep
1332079611132469250 2020-11-27 05:51:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NewSovietPoster the solution is more ironic bigotry against actual identities, like brits and Italians

1331343968848711681 2020-11-25 05:08:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GoldnerPDX i mean i'd respect this whole r/iamverybadass anti-authority schtick if they actually committed to it, but they were pretty eager to say "bend the knee" not so long ago so it's kinda funny to see this reaction now
1331342066677411841 2020-11-25 05:00:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Dystopian_Rob political parties will always exist regardless of the specific system they operate in, so really it's more important to address how the current voting system incentivizes the growth of two polarized parties that don't effectively govern.
1331341738422771712 2020-11-25 04:59:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @The_Ohioan_ like obviously there are many ways in which capitalism has harmed lgbt people but it's ridiculous to claim that switching to socialism would inherently fix all issues we face. that's a dangerously naive mindset.
1331341467357491202 2020-11-25 04:58:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @The_Ohioan_ tying liberation of oppressed groups like lgbt people to economic systems just doesn't make sense when we've been treated more or less equally poorly by both sides of that dispute. might as well just become openly class reductionist and be done with it at that point lol

1330926740957515780 2020-11-24 01:30:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> some Guatemalans on Tumblr were saying this was staged to crack down on peaceful protesters, because the cops stood by and let them do this and there were drums of gasoline left lying around, and no matter what the truth actually is that‚Äôs pretty hilarious

1330654212288638979 2020-11-23 07:27:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype some people have brought up "replace the police" as a slogan idea which is pretty interesting since it conveys major institutional upheaval while also seeming (to me) less militant and more result-oriented.
1330653721315979265 2020-11-23 07:25:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EmperorBlargus yeah, there are certainly interesting arguments for both sides of that debate but a lot of these differences people make such a big deal out of seem like they're more of a result of dogmatic use of labels (like what a "state" is) than major policy/strategy differences.
1330652974075535365 2020-11-23 07:22:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EmperorBlargus oh, i've heard a bit about the current situation in the uk but i don't know much about it. is that a brexit-related issue?
1330652662723973122 2020-11-23 07:21:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EmperorBlargus that makes sense. i was thinking more of narrow leftist tendencies like different strains of anarchism and specific labels like "market socialist" and "social democrat" but institutional dysfunction is also an important thing to address.
1330652201841201152 2020-11-23 07:19:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EmperorBlargus do you mean food rationing or is this more of an economic concern (e.g. with tariffs)?
1330651459470372865 2020-11-23 07:16:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EmperorBlargus interesting, could you elaborate on some examples of that?
1330650785722621952 2020-11-23 07:14:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> i respect people who go through the process of defining their specific ideological preferences, but personally i don‚Äôt believe that any one political group has all of the right answers, and all too often it descends into bizarre cult mentality which discourages critical thinking.

1330386226684235778 2020-11-22 13:42:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle actually, i dismissed it because half of it is just talking about his opposition to israel's actions. the fact that these other things don't stack up either is just icing on the cake of how dishonest it is.
1330385745685712896 2020-11-22 13:40:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle how can any of us know that for sure? he could have a wehrmacht shrine in his attic, he could be secretly anti-palestine, etc, but all of that's just speculation against his actual publicly known position. this is just a copout from providing real evidence.
1330384495430799362 2020-11-22 13:35:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> i wonder how many of the "who wants to leave society and live with me in a commune" posts have resulted in whirlwind romances between ex-posters who now live on idyllic homesteads and kiss while sitting atop a pile of beets.

1330335646460809217 2020-11-22 10:21:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MeowScarface @carolinecstark I mean that one I kinda get because he was talking about how he used to feel when he was younger which I think is relatable for a lot of LGBT people, like I never had that exact thought per se but stuff like that certainly crossed my mind early on

1330071264615075843 2020-11-21 16:51:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jacob_posts sorry, it‚Äôs hard not to relapse at this time of year
1330070835760132098 2020-11-21 16:49:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I really feel like we just let nightcore music slip into online culture with no analysis of its repercussions
1330070165392936963 2020-11-21 16:46:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle I haven‚Äôt read Hobson but my understanding is that a lot of people like his analysis on imperialism and other topics, so it‚Äôs hard to claim Corbyn said he liked that book because of how much he wanted to ‚Äústick it to the Jews‚Äù or whatever.
1330069584146264066 2020-11-21 16:44:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle Weren‚Äôt Marx‚Äôs parents Lutheran though? And either way this seems like more of an intracommunity dispute than anything.

1330064239952867330 2020-11-21 16:23:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle It bears repeating that for all the complaints that it‚Äôs anti-Semitic to bring Zionism into these discussions, the thread you‚Äôve been referencing is full of examples of the dishonest claim that conflates criticism of Israel with hatred of Jewish people.
1330063339813277697 2020-11-21 16:19:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle Isn‚Äôt he literally Jewish himself? No idea what I‚Äôm supposed to do with this.
1330063202214928384 2020-11-21 16:19:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle He‚Äôs specifically called out ‚ÄúRothschild‚Äù conspiracy theories as being anti-Semitic tropes. As I said, that thread lumps in Israel-related foreign policy issues with claims about Corbyn as a person, which makes the whole thing weaker as a legit argument.
1330060985261051904 2020-11-21 16:10:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @OneWhoGlows @OkButStill @w33nix it‚Äôs the stimming I‚Äôm telling ya

1330059275910131712 2020-11-21 16:03:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts So you‚Äôre more upset with Israel for cooperating with the United States than the way they‚Äôve historically treated Palestinians under their rule? Or is that also a negative factor in your view?
1330058783859552257 2020-11-21 16:01:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle As I said before, let me know when you see any legitimate criticism. This cynical lib-fueled bullshit with Corbyn certainly doesn‚Äôt apply. They literally kicked him out of his own party to start a power struggle ffs
1330057309796659202 2020-11-21 15:55:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @thucydiplease @dobsonbugnutt @ACorollaries @halaljew maybe it was because of the way it was worded and his refusal to provide evidence, which doesn‚Äôt invalidate the claim per se but it certainly makes that arguments *look* way less honest to many people
1330055209129816066 2020-11-21 15:47:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @paddingtonposts that‚Äôs an obvious one, idk why people cant see the erotic element in her relationship with gruncle stan

1330053872879013888 2020-11-21 15:42:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts Serious question: what are the differences between ‚ÄúJewish autonomism‚Äù and Zionism from an ideological perspective?
1330053269893341184 2020-11-21 15:39:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle You can condescendingly claim that the left needs to ‚Äúself-crit‚Äù but you‚Äôve shown no desire to reckon with the fact that you‚Äôve promoted blatant smears which have wrought havoc within the left. How is that any different from just wrecking shit?
1330052943308083204 2020-11-21 15:38:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle ‚ÄúMight?‚Äù How exactly are multiple articles in mainstream outlets claiming Bernie Sanders is an anti-semite not evidence enough that the people claiming leftist politicians are anti-Semitic are doing so in the most dishonest way possible? What do you get out of ignoring that?
1330052132393938944 2020-11-21 15:35:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts sure, two things can be bad at the same time. but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with criticizing US foreign policy in the Middle East and how it‚Äôs inflamed latent conflicts due to evangelicals‚Äô obsession with Israel as a fulfillment of apocalyptic prophecies.
1330051679115472897 2020-11-21 15:33:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle who said anything about ‚Äúsaving face?‚Äù this is about recognizing a pattern of media abuse from the center and the right that has been used to discredit popular leftist politicians and blunt the left‚Äôs movement in general. your interpretation of what I said is ridiculous.
1330043432530833411 2020-11-21 15:00:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @scramboring ugh my first thought is that awful Netflix one called ‚Äúhoops‚Äù

1330038520031940610 2020-11-21 14:41:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts likewise, when bad-faith actors conflate opposing israel with antisemitism, it's understandable that people on the left who have been subject to those claims would be skeptical, which makes it stupid to claim that somebody bringing up zionism in a conversation is somehow a gotcha
1330038051343622146 2020-11-21 14:39:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts neoliberals and conservatives have had such a good time with the "leftists are antisemitic" claims that they even attempted to wield them against bernie sanders, an actual jew, so it's hard to see how any of this discourse is productive
1330037643053248513 2020-11-21 14:37:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle @inthesedeserts wow how crude smh

1330034137923727362 2020-11-21 14:23:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Ka1serTheProle and he apologized for it after finding out about the tropes involved. half the shit in that thread is just complaining about his opinions on israel which doesn't exactly help its credibility either

1329962342109630465 2020-11-21 09:38:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> hmm, should I become a replyguy to the political discourse bot or banish it from my timeline entirely
1329960820818767875 2020-11-21 09:32:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @gregoryconan very flattered that you asked, personally I think ‚Äúdefund‚Äù and ‚Äúabolish‚Äù do a good job conveying militancy for better or worse, but ‚Äúreplace the police‚Äù makes people ask the question ‚Äúwell, replace them with what?‚Äù which seems clever since it leads into the conversation itself.

1329928757071720455 2020-11-21 07:24:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Halalcoholism the concept of ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù has literally never had any standalone value and it never will lol   https://t.co/9tR8mULbJH
1329928462635855872 2020-11-21 07:23:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> y‚Äôall will say stuff like this but then refuse to address the capitalistic appropriation of Italian culture by Anglo-run corporations like Papa John‚Äôs and Domino‚Äôs üò§üò§

1329899191515148288 2020-11-21 05:27:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> well that wasn‚Äôt hard to find lmao  https://t.co/2zO17MGhmx
1329898571471187969 2020-11-21 05:25:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> my fault for offering mild pushback on their overly hostile take I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è oh well
1329898265756758017 2020-11-21 05:23:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> just had a mutual block me because I retweeted someone who they responded to critically and then got a snarky response back from, which is pretty weird but also kinda funny tbh
1329897360051351554 2020-11-21 05:20:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MatthewDownhour this critique has *nothing* to do with liberalism as an ideology, people just love using it as a smear word for strawman.
1329896809179844616 2020-11-21 05:18:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MatthewDownhour the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a republic not a democracy‚Äù like always gets me because the two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive and refer to different concepts (not having a monarchy and having the people make decisions for the state). they mean ‚Äúrepresentative democracy‚Äù but not even that supports the EC.

1329858695925280769 2020-11-21 02:46:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy @badvibesnochill That‚Äôs a good point (although I have seen plenty of people who seem to think that way), but in what ways was trump not fully supported by republicans? I never really got a different impression.
1329857571226783748 2020-11-21 02:42:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheRustlerr @MichaelTanuvasa the Green Party didn‚Äôt even get 1% this election. if they or any other third party is going to be heard, we need to change the voting system so they‚Äôre actually a viable choice.
1329856690481750016 2020-11-21 02:38:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MichaelTanuvasa not at all, his choices so far have vindicated the argument that having Dems get back into power and not do enough to solve the country‚Äôs problems will convince more people that they need to become more radical. And the cope by right-wingers has been delightful.
1329855391593881600 2020-11-21 02:33:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Schmarmbly1 @Molluskman @MichaelTanuvasa why do so many people think Tom cotton is on some kind of meteoric rise to power? did somebody just draw his name out of a hat and announce it to Twitter?

1329311239974088705 2020-11-19 14:31:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> no haha this has nothing to do with recent discourse why would you ever say that lol üòÇ
1329310611084341249 2020-11-19 14:28:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> and at that point I was a minuscule account with no clout whatsoever so I can‚Äôt even imagine how terrible it would‚Äôve gotten if I‚Äôd become some kind of politics poster, like that‚Äôs just beyond the pale mental health wise for a lot of fully grown people so uh. yeah.
1329310250550366216 2020-11-19 14:27:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I got on this site at 17 if I remember correctly and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs fucked with my head in a subtle yet major way so I legit think there‚Äôs no reason to be on here if you are not an adult
1329310019406491653 2020-11-19 14:26:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if I was a minor on Twitter I simply would not
1329308897157533701 2020-11-19 14:21:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CheyenneRandell thank god I got kinda worried we were actually gonna get it together and have to do something meaningful for a sec there

1329299590328225792 2020-11-19 13:44:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @appledoglives we need to address the Hibernian Conspiracy with all deliberate speed
1329296786637385728 2020-11-19 13:33:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cathetercutie there is a big problem with fat-shaming on the left
1329292978041577474 2020-11-19 13:18:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> just saw someone censor ‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù and honestly? that slaps
1329292812274323456 2020-11-19 13:17:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> yeah I was in NHS in high school‚Äîthe Nasty Hoe Squad!! üòé
1329291881369440256 2020-11-19 13:14:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> like seriously if I was the person running that account and i found out about the arguments that have gone down without me being there to MOOO at everyone I‚Äôd feel like a failure in life
1329291637567205383 2020-11-19 13:13:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> it‚Äôs a real tragedy that in the left‚Äôs moment of need, when we must conclude the discourse of whether it‚Äôs antisemitic once and for all, the antisemitism cow has deserted us
1329291202764697601 2020-11-19 13:11:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @roun_sa_ville did you find the antisemitism yet
1329289764441370632 2020-11-19 13:05:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @WhackNicholson I admire your optimism but everything I‚Äôve seen so far has led me to the opposite conclusion unfortunately
1329283598269231105 2020-11-19 12:41:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @gregoryconan indeed, it was more a rhetorical question, for the bit if you will (but that being said I have no idea how this discourse really got started AGAIN)
1329281394246356995 2020-11-19 12:32:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> why is leftist Twitter now drawing lines in the sand based on a split in the ‚ÄúGarfield pfp account‚Äù community and whether Corbyn getting reinstated was good or not, and how in the name of all that is holy have these two things been intertwined by the Discourse Gods?
1329277953033768961 2020-11-19 12:18:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BonaFried to me it seems like a cycle of: - bad-faith claims that opposing Israel is anti-Semitic - leftists defensively responding that anti-Zionism isn‚Äôt anti-Semitic - others saying it‚Äôs anti-Semitic for leftists to respond to claims of leftist anti-Semitism with criticism of Israel
1329274192961933314 2020-11-19 12:03:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy And that‚Äôs my problem with arguments like the one this person is making, because they seem to have no issue with alienating everyone who isn‚Äôt already a hardcore leftist just to prove a point about how much the current state of affairs sucks. It‚Äôs just pointless doomer BS.
1329273731542364162 2020-11-19 12:02:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy And as for exhortations to actual revolution, I guess my perspective is the ‚Äúhealthcare pls‚Äù meme but for social issues in general. We‚Äôre not going to have a leftist uprising today or tomorrow or in a month, and with the way things are going, I‚Äôd rather focus on the here and now.
1329273353455226886 2020-11-19 12:00:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy Well that sucks to hear, because my goal isn‚Äôt to shore up the Dems more than necessary, but honestly I see more of a future with them than going full ‚Äúelectoralist revolutionary‚Äù and jumping at every quixotic third-party bid under the sun. They‚Äôre even more locked out of power.

It‚Äôs so easy to get cred if you rail against the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù regardless of whether your critique is legit.

If that comes across as ‚Äúdesperately trying to justify everything liberals do,‚Äù it‚Äôs not intentional, but I‚Äôm sick of how credulous everyone is.

1329204639191928835 2020-11-19 07:27:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @anarcho_numeral @zilchzip the FBI (a federal-level agency) investigates hate crimes, and it‚Äôs a distinct entity from local police departments

1329199042820182017 2020-11-19 07:05:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @redwoodnest I can believe that but I still find it weird that anyone would be stupid enough to do something this fruitlessly antagonistic

1329195415846199297 2020-11-19 06:50:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> like "oh umm that sounds kinda suspicious but maybe they're just from the lincoln project, it's probably normal"
1329195226565578756 2020-11-19 06:50:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture it's interesting because this would mean that superman is just a tabula rasa for humans to mold into what we think a god should be like, and the outcome is a guy who pretends to be a reporter half the time and spends the rest of his life in primary-color spandex
1329194758519066627 2020-11-19 06:48:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the funniest possible outcome would be if the anonymous "operative" was a republican plant but the democrats had no clue because their messaging has been so disjointed

1329190152149880848 2020-11-19 06:30:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture yeah and then you end up with the apparent issue of "why is such a supposedly non-remarkable planet the target of so many extraterrestrial attacks?" to which my best theory so far is that it's the celestial equivalent of a tourist trap

1329187921677660174 2020-11-19 06:21:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @proustmalone my understanding is that local poverty in her district is more of a city issue than anything, but even IF her entire constituency lived in an earthly paradise i just can't relate to the idea of keeping someone in office that long with zero turnover for *decades*.
1329186718998736896 2020-11-19 06:16:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture he doesn't really seem sinister or even particularly self-centered but it's pretty logical to conclude that he just doesn't really *get* ordinary human struggles aside from sympathizing with them. really it's a wonder probability-wise that he didn't go all Brightburn on everyone

1329184342262820864 2020-11-19 06:06:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture i guess there could be a message somewhere in there about the inherent hubris in singlehandedly remaking the world in your image but there's still some pretty weird aspects to that yeah
1329184043913588745 2020-11-19 06:05:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> not people on here trying to have Serious Takes on obama reading theory to be a simp in college lmao, y'all are too much

1329183258173648900 2020-11-19 06:02:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture there's a great deal of storytelling potential as well as political themes to be explored but it tends to require you to accept that initial premise, which certainly isn't impossible and can even be fun at times but doesn't make for a coherent analysis for the real world.
1329182972134748160 2020-11-19 06:01:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @neuralculture my thing with the superhero genre is that it almost always implies that the only way to solve societal ills like crime is to have vigilantes running around knocking heads together (or shooting lasers out of their eyes, or creating light constructs of machine guns, or whatever).
1329182381991923712 2020-11-19 05:59:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead i'm sick of logging on and seeing all these hot takes from big accounts that assert claims with complete confidence but then turn out to be way less accurate, if not outright incorrect. if people avoided hyperbolic language and making unfounded accusations we'd be better off.
1329181961395560451 2020-11-19 05:57:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead bureaucracy but w/0 specific evidence it's dumb to act like this is an ironclad argument, especially considering a lot of this comes from tulsi who is actively ruining leftism imo. like either way it doesn't let kamala totally off the hook but that's a huge jump to "war criminal"
1329181419785117697 2020-11-19 05:55:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead my entire problem with this type of argument is that it's based on expecting the reader to assume stuff that there's no basis for. like, maybe she was personally involved with every lawyer's argument process, maybe she had other shit to manage, idk. either way it's a failure of
1329178729717886978 2020-11-19 05:44:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead i literally never said "you can't have a problem with it," my entire issue with this person's argument is their bizarre desire to twist themself into a pretzel calling literally everything a *war crime* when there's no good reason to. it only serves to weaken actual critiques.
1329178259637100544 2020-11-19 05:42:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead oh my god. read your own article. it says literally nothing about "war crimes" whatsoever. if you were saying it's a *human rights violation* your argument would be pretty good but as it is your dedication to "war crimes" makes it incredibly weak.
1329177855696179202 2020-11-19 05:41:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead maybe i was unclear, there's no big moral/ethical distinction between war crimes and "normal" crimes, it's just different from a definitional perspective. and i have no idea what you're referring to with "torture" since you've been vague for this entire convo.
1329177300194234378 2020-11-19 05:38:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy @sadmememr2e4 @Radicaldoomer @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead if you think the only way to criticize bad prison conditions is to call them "war crimes" then i don't see a point in having the term exist at all. it's not just a synonym for "bad things" jfc
1329176874866651148 2020-11-19 05:37:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead i don't think it's justified but it doesn't count as a "war crime" and it's stupid to mix terms like that when there's actual war crimes probably going on as we speak.

1329108512853647360 2020-11-19 01:05:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead i wouldn't defend it by any means, because having a cultish attachment to anyone--especially politicians--is stupid, but it makes no sense to call any old atrocity a "war crime" when the term specifically exists to refer to, y'know, crimes committed in a WAR. this is basic stuff.

1329105978449666048 2020-11-19 00:55:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead like the other person said, it's supposedly the fault of lawyers from her office &amp; she wasn't aware of the argument. obviously that doesn't absolve her of what occurs under her tenure but it's not the same as claiming it was directly her doing it. i've seen no proof of the latter
1329104566265196545 2020-11-19 00:49:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @marcorubio wtf based???
1329104223166926853 2020-11-19 00:48:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead it's literally not a "war crime" by definition ffs. this is the whole reason nobody takes this shit seriously, because people just throw around the label because it sounds scary without doing any critical analysis whatsoever. it makes it harder to criticize actual war criminals.
1329103702385422337 2020-11-19 00:46:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead every credible source i've found agrees with what they're saying, so i'm more inclined to agree with them than the ramblings of some twitter account. btw the claims you're making were first pushed by tulsi gabbard, who isn't exactly a credible source for obvious reasons.
1329102656804163585 2020-11-19 00:42:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Radicaldoomer @sadmememr2e4 @LeafOnHead @shoe0nhead pretty sure you can't simultaneously appeal to "the rules" and claim they aren't relevant in the same argument. like youre just straight up ignoring the existence of places like gitmo just so you can make this asinine "omg this is literally worse than literal war crimes" argument

"well sure she didn't do war crimes but it's still bad so technically i'm right!" "well maybe she wasn't actually responsible but i still think it makes sense to claim it's all directly her fault!" it makes you look ill-informed.

1328169608080207883 2020-11-16 10:54:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca literally when did i "mythologize" anything? i never even said i liked the guy. you're putting words in my mouth because you see all these posts about liberals wanting the obamas to adopt them and assume that everyone who disagrees with you thinks like that.
1328169033510871040 2020-11-16 10:52:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca the difference is that your example is about an ideological label, his plan is a specific policy which is best explained by going to the source itself. and i in my infinite gullibility thought you'd actually take that for a useful answer rather than just shitting on me even more.

1328167804827299841 2020-11-16 10:47:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca nothing about this has ever been normal, i only care about making sure as many people survive as possible. as i see it, letting a pandemic rage on and letting a civil war (really more of a one-sided bloodbath a la argentina's "dirty war") are both terrible outcomes.
1328167387305287681 2020-11-16 10:45:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca are you fucking kidding me? you're so fucking obnoxious for this. i linked the plan. i told you what the plan includes. what's your fucking point with this, that anyone who disagrees with you is just an ignorant moron? is that your only argument here? jesus christ.
1328167069087633408 2020-11-16 10:44:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @green917 @AvantGiallo @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca pretty sure he's got an economic recovery plan, but regardless, my immediate concern is not catching covid and dying, so frankly i'm gonna focus on the problems facing society right now rather than getting even more burned out.
1328166711258980352 2020-11-16 10:43:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca the context is saying that he actually wants to tax the rich more, which is a good thing by literally any definition. and the vast majority of people repeating that quote do so with no knowledge of what it's actually about, which doesn't exactly make for a great look.
1328166208265465861 2020-11-16 10:41:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @green917 @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca hate to break it to you, but if shit popped off right now, today, the RIGHT would be the ones who would win. i don't want society to collapse tomorrow on the complete non-chance that we'll magically achieve a socialist society when there's a complete disparity of force against us

1328165288890814464 2020-11-16 10:37:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @DarthMeteos yeah i'm about ready to call it quits honestly, these people are so fucking obnoxious and delusional i feel like i'm losing braincells just talking to them

1328163557221994502 2020-11-16 10:30:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @green917 @AvantGiallo @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca if you're still harping on about the "nothing will fundamentally change" quote, i already told you that it's debunked, but don't let that get in the way of your nihilistic narrative.

1328153209278517249 2020-11-16 09:49:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GaLeftist which successful examples are being referenced here?
1328152902377017351 2020-11-16 09:48:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype @happyroadkill no prob, it‚Äôs not super active but you can usually see some interesting stuff on there üòÅ
1328152442849153025 2020-11-16 09:46:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @daveewave I think the opposite, they‚Äôd have doubled down on the narrative that his candidacy was a failure because of insufficient support from moderate voters and maybe be even harsher in their rejection of the left wing of their party.
1328151698527948800 2020-11-16 09:43:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype @happyroadkill well there‚Äôs this neologism of ‚Äúfugratia‚Äù someone created using the opposite etymological roots, although it‚Äôs defined as being happy the past is over and implies what you‚Äôre describing.   https://t.co/Qre2g51FDn
1328148430536007683 2020-11-16 09:30:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca you literally asked ‚Äúwhat is Biden‚Äôs plan?‚Äù how else was I supposed to respond to that? I‚Äôm not ignoring his problematic aspects but it makes people sound stupid when they act like he‚Äôs no improvement over trump whatsoever, especially with stuff like this.

1328108210000191489 2020-11-16 06:50:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing it actually does and i don't feel the slightest bit bad about it, so this doesn't feel like an attack so much as your admission that you can't convince me to adopt your worldview. go lecture someone who actually cares about your guilt-tripping.
1328107764716085248 2020-11-16 06:49:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvantGiallo @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca doesn't change that biden has an actual plan for dealing with covid and trump's is just to pretend it doesn't matter if not outright denying it exists.
1328093886020014080 2020-11-16 05:53:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EwatomiAbara it's the SMART board
1328093767774199809 2020-11-16 05:53:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @juchedroid @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene that's right
1328093312285335552 2020-11-16 05:51:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GRIFTSH0P for all his references to wendy's he'd be a fool not to work in some kind of sponsorship with them
1328093088003321858 2020-11-16 05:50:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @green917 @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca if he fixes the current shitshow with the pandemic response (or lack thereof), that's more than enough justification for supporting him in my view.
1328092761208344578 2020-11-16 05:49:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene obviously there have been variants like nazism, but historically speaking, there's a clear line of evolution that can be traced back to fascist theorists like evola which has been replicated in subsequent fascist movements. i haven't seen any info about the types you've described
1328091901426356225 2020-11-16 05:45:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene so much for "trump the dove" then. as far as i can tell, there's literally no advantage to portraying his foreign policy in a positive light.
1328091554016342016 2020-11-16 05:44:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos i'm not convinced that it's never going to happen, but even in the worst-case scenario, his policies are still better than what trump's got going on, and it's disadvantageous for the left when people can't even acknowledge a basic reality like that and use it to reach more people
1328091163711184897 2020-11-16 05:43:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @DarthMeteos @rdsathene @green917 @TheMarieFonseca it's just a cope because their sacred cows are destined for failure, and they know it. the green party is never going to dethrone the democrats--they couldn't even hit the target of 5% that everyone was talking about. it's just shame-fueled political performativity at this point.
1328087273938804737 2020-11-16 05:27:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene they serve different functions because they're different ideologies to begin with. fascism is just fascism.
1328086933680033793 2020-11-16 05:26:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene except for syria, trump has expanded u.s. involvement basically everywhere. and yes, that includes drone strikes.
1328086699327500288 2020-11-16 05:25:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @helen how does it feel to stay winning 24/7
1328085879823474692 2020-11-16 05:22:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene yeah, and believe it or not, ideology is more complex than just slapping prefixes on "fascism" for everything and calling it a day.
1328085083782336513 2020-11-16 05:18:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene are you kidding? trump's let the military-industrial complex go to town during his tenure, he's even ended regulations about reporting drone strikes since the yemeni conflict started. he is NOT anti-war by any stretch of the imagination.
1328084361305059333 2020-11-16 05:16:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos biden's admin absolutely needs to face maximum pushback from the left when it caves to conservatives, but claiming that he's somehow more fascist than trump, as some people have here, is completely ridiculous and makes the entire movement look like a joke.
1328084043397738496 2020-11-16 05:14:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene when have fascists *ever* taken a non-interventionist foreign policy position? the mid-20th century was literally just them invading neighboring countries ffs.

1328082967357501447 2020-11-16 05:10:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype i love the idea of using the @ symbol as a combo letter, it's like an expansion of the alphabet
1328081987807158272 2020-11-16 05:06:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos yeah that sucks, trump is still worse though. remember when he had an iranian general assassinated at the start of this year and almost started a war with them? fun times, right?
1328081638648147974 2020-11-16 05:05:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype it's literally as irrelevant of a term as "y'xll" and "folx" and yet some people think it's a massive improvement for society somehow

1328079948016476162 2020-11-16 04:58:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca meteos specifically brought up the covid response as a reason biden is better than trump and your only rebuttal was "hope he sees this bro"
1328079707783491584 2020-11-16 04:57:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos i really don't give a single shit about what biden did when he was in college, at least use a policy-based argument lol
1328079333676736513 2020-11-16 04:56:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> remember that random tweet that claimed cnn had announced dick cheney was going to be biden's natsec advisor and then literally one second of googling showed there wasn't anything remotely saying that on cnn after all? didn't stop it from getting thousands of likes ofc
1328078777835020290 2020-11-16 04:53:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy currently trying to figure out what's the precisely correct amount of complaining about biden on twitter that will get this person to see me as a human being
1328078582816657411 2020-11-16 04:53:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca it's a direct response to the other person's tweet which you apparently either didn't read or don't care about
1328078462511411200 2020-11-16 04:52:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos at least use an original comeback bobby, this is just sad
1328078252943040519 2020-11-16 04:51:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AAzenith @rdsathene yeah the candidate that wants to protect and expand lgbt rights is definitely worse than the one who's actively tearing them down
1328078084172615680 2020-11-16 04:51:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @timmyj213 @kfgibson @rdsathene confirmation bias is real. tons of people just share shit with no proof whatsoever.
1328077947547365385 2020-11-16 04:50:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> there ARE no cabinet picks yet lmao

1328077539194130436 2020-11-16 04:48:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @DGchu @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene yeah because trump's lifetime judicial appointments totally aren't "long-term damage" or anything
1328077345329197056 2020-11-16 04:48:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @devoter_ @DarthMeteos @green917 @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene "national fascism" as opposed to literally what other kind of fascism
1328077204916477954 2020-11-16 04:47:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @juchedroid @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene they're literally called different things for a reason lmfao
1328077111211462664 2020-11-16 04:47:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @rdsathene @DarthMeteos @TheMarieFonseca then you might as well make an equally ridiculous argument like "capitalism is just socialism in slow motion" because it allegedly progresses to a socialist system according to marx. ideological labels exist for a reason, and you waste them with reductive arguments like this.
1328076819514404865 2020-11-16 04:46:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheMarieFonseca @rdsathene more authoritarian by literally what metric lol
1328076706419257344 2020-11-16 04:45:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheMarieFonseca @DarthMeteos @rdsathene &gt; when you definitely understand what "fascism" means
1328075853067120640 2020-11-16 04:42:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing viewing the world in such black-and-white simplistic terms may be a source of comfort for you, but to me it seems very unrealistic and impractical. i don't see voting for an irrelevant option like the green party as doing anything to make the world better according to my morals.
1328074719451557890 2020-11-16 04:37:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy "everyone who voted for biden is literally not human to me" is a very normal take

1327893355901177856 2020-11-15 16:37:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz and i didn't ask to see your shit takes on my timeline but here we fucking are
1327893050278948867 2020-11-15 16:35:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz if you feel called out by something i post that's really none of my business. i said what i said, the words are there for everyone to read. my intent wasn't to call anyone a terf but i can't exactly control how you feel about it lol
1327892822004011012 2020-11-15 16:34:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz and i'm gay so good luck getting me in a relationship with someone who isn't another guy lol
1327892589387911169 2020-11-15 16:33:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz show me the tweet where i called literally anyone a terf?? i specifically said there's a distinction of spreading their rhetoric *without intending to*.
1327892385087545344 2020-11-15 16:33:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz edgy white kids when they call someone a cracker be like
1327892125107826688 2020-11-15 16:32:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz people disagreeing with you online isn't gaslighting lmfao, that's specifically used to refer to actual familial/romantic relationships and it's kinda gross that you feel entitled to use the language of abuse victims to complain about how people argue with you on twitter
1327891726174998529 2020-11-15 16:30:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz i feel kinda invested because i think people spreading terf talking points unknowingly is actually cringe as fuck

1327891456586080256 2020-11-15 16:29:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz what do you even think gaslighting means lmao
1327891370841870336 2020-11-15 16:29:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz if they're saying they're "speaking from experience" then they should actually provide info of what happened, because i haven't seen a single person actually say that happened to them, just vague allegations with no substance.
1327890975264530433 2020-11-15 16:27:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz where was the lie though
1327890940682522627 2020-11-15 16:27:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz do you have literally *any* proof for that claim? like just a single shred of proof? if this is just another tiktok thing istfg
1327890742551994371 2020-11-15 16:26:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz i haven't seen any actual evidence for that besides a couple of tiktok posts that went viral. maybe you should consider the ways the things you say hurt more people than they ever help.
1327890435826659330 2020-11-15 16:25:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz "the only way something can be related to terf rhetoric is if it's literally saying trans women are bad" is the same line of reasoning as the right-wingers who think there's no way someone can be racist if they aren't walking around in a kkk outfit calling people the n-word.
1327890149234126849 2020-11-15 16:24:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz they just said he "doesn't abuse it as a tool to prey on women," implying that most other men who do *are* doing it for that reason (as many other posts have claimed). why do you feel like attacking feminine cis men is somehow cool and woke now, rather than just hateful?
1327889694475120647 2020-11-15 16:22:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz i'm not talking about trans women, i'm saying that there are clear parallels between cis men wearing skirts getting called predators with no evidence and the way terfs attack trans women for "invading women's spaces" with just as little evidence.
1327889336717750272 2020-11-15 16:21:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz i never said cis men are the ones who bear the brunt of terf beliefs, i'm saying that claiming cis men who wear skirts and do stuff like that are just trying to prey on women is an outgrowth of their ideology whether the people saying it realize that or not.
1327888956642516993 2020-11-15 16:19:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz that's how terfs view them, which is why it's problematic to echo their talking points about how cis men who wear dresses are exploiting others or secretly trying to abuse people or whatever.
1327888359776280576 2020-11-15 16:17:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz what are you talking about?
1327888021996400641 2020-11-15 16:15:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz nope, the idea that all men are out to get them is a core part of their hate- and fear-based belief system. i suggest doing more research on this before dismissing it out of hand.
1327886758684585985 2020-11-15 16:10:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ahhhron @jojochalamet @cyberslutzz terfs often use the argument that "men are inherently evil" as a justification for their beliefs, especially since it plays into their claim that amab people with feminine gender expression are secretly all predators.
1327886070768349190 2020-11-15 16:08:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @kimpossiblefact just imagining the obama household with all these people they adopted off twitter and having it be like that one movie where they turned an abandoned building into a dog hotel
1327884643639697409 2020-11-15 16:02:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BelarusMoD same, and that's saying a lot considering the shit that goes down here on a daily basis
1327884554888228864 2020-11-15 16:02:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @naebumaye yeah i can't believe he singlehandedly controlled the entire political system of the united states to force this outcome, kind of a dick move tbh

1327882364706492423 2020-11-15 15:53:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @scramboring just people circlejerking about how ideologically pure they are, as basically any social group purely focused on politics inevitably does

1327878097803354112 2020-11-15 15:36:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing i do acknowledge that i'm "voting for evil" as you put it, i just don't think that doing so is some kind of great moral sin as you seem to think it is. voting is a strategic act, not a demonstration of your personal morals. save that for the protests to push democrats left.

1327818447569514497 2020-11-15 11:39:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> brazil is colonizing the amazon rainforest as we speak and displacing indigenous nations while doing irreversible ecological damage so i don't see how the "gotcha" with fracking is comparable tbh

It would be ridiculous to expect you not to have your own views on all this, but I was responding to the person saying there‚Äôs no partisan framing to this question, which is easily disproven.
1327681701032714241 2020-11-15 02:35:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing I‚Äôm not missing the point, I just think it‚Äôs a wrong one to begin with. Politics has always been about figuring out compromises that are acceptable to your group and other groups with different goals. Acting like you‚Äôre in a holy war only works if you‚Äôre actually in one.

1327574341391970304 2020-11-14 19:29:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidSentryModern @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @LeftwardSwing yep, and even if everyone agreed on a single concrete definition, it's always been a spectrum of beliefs. political philosophy is always messier in real life than in theory tracts.

1327573628179845121 2020-11-14 19:26:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing point being, there's nothing approaching a coherent left-wing movement in the united states, and the left in general is hopelessly fractured because nobody can accept the idea that other people may not want to pursue the exact same strategy as them.
1327573331663605760 2020-11-14 19:25:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing there's actual socialists (of which there are a thousand different feuding varieties), and then there's the people who *think* wanting healthcare makes them socialists, and there's people who agree with socialist ideas but don't know about it, etc, with infinite combinations.

1327571238345187328 2020-11-14 19:17:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing you're the one claiming there's no possible way anyone could ever like joe biden for any reason. haven't you seen any of the saccharine "uncle joe" memes? it's definitely a thing.
1327570810358390784 2020-11-14 19:15:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing i mean that a ton of leftists act like the actions of such a small political minority are crucial to the outcome of elections, whether it's to shame other leftists for not supporting the mainstream candidate or to make wild claims of a spontaneous third party victory.
1327570371525160961 2020-11-14 19:13:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing it's a joint ticket, pretty sure you have to like both of them for it to garner any support.

1327569269614399488 2020-11-14 19:09:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing saying no biden supporters actually like him is an extraordinary claim which requires evidence to back up. personally it seems obvious to me that there are people enthused about him and kamala, as weird as that is, just from looking at the #bidenharris2020 campaign hashtag.
1327568268849278976 2020-11-14 19:05:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @missysuxrivas @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing pretty disingenuous to claim it's not an argument when op is unabashedly taking sides in the replies  https://t.co/iMX1npoGu9
1327567658276024321 2020-11-14 19:02:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CommieBreath @IAmKingDrone @MidSentryModern @LeftwardSwing are you talking about the left here, or people in general? because i'm not a biden fan by any means but it's ridiculous to claim *nobody* likes him. the left's influence in politics is vastly overstated on twitter.

1327096864936693760 2020-11-13 11:52:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AnarchoPill the people who insisted they could do no wrong and elevated them to prophetic status within the online community are very off-putting, and so are the ones who spew bile at anyone who refers to them in even a vaguely positive context. (lots of tulcels in the latter group too.)

1327070888278315009 2020-11-13 10:08:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garfgf @incoglefty @Wissa_YT @simim23 @ThoughtSlime ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù is not a synonym for ‚Äúautistic.‚Äù nobody gets diagnosed as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù not the best comparison if you‚Äôre trying to link the two.

1327069671019917313 2020-11-13 10:03:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garfgf @incoglefty @Wissa_YT @simim23 @ThoughtSlime you‚Äôre the only one claiming it‚Äôs ‚Äústigmatizing‚Äù anything, this isn‚Äôt like a math problem where you use the right steps and find the solution. social norms are hardly so cut-and-dry as you‚Äôre making them out to be.
1327069422528458752 2020-11-13 10:03:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @incoglefty @Wissa_YT @garfgf @simim23 @ThoughtSlime claiming just based on personal beliefs that words like this are ‚Äúableist‚Äù is a major stretch, especially when multiple other people who are supposedly affected by these words have explicitly said they don‚Äôt believe that. it‚Äôs dishonest to claim any of this is universally true.
1327068864543412225 2020-11-13 10:00:47 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @VictoriaLBruce yeah idk why so many people are adverse to it. there‚Äôs really no risks aside from those inherent in other forms of power generation when done properly, and new technologies have made it even safer and less wasteful.
1327068551556067331 2020-11-13 09:59:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CGoustin @VictoriaLBruce all nuclear plants are at risk of that exact scenario happening, this is true /s
1327067653375217664 2020-11-13 09:55:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @why_bernie @seltbram @VictoriaLBruce countries like France have used nuclear energy on a mass scale for years with no issues like the ones you‚Äôre referencing. maybe, and this is just me spitballing here, the oil and gas industries have a vested interest in making viable alternatives look bad?
1327067194933587970 2020-11-13 09:54:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> what does ‚Äúidpol‚Äù even mean at this point? nobody seems to be able to articulate a clear definition, it‚Äôs just used as a bludgeon or shield in arguments as a stand-in for ‚Äúthing other people do that I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù this whole discourse is ripe for subjective misinterpretation.
1327066476847783936 2020-11-13 09:51:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @incoglefty @Wissa_YT @garfgf @simim23 @ThoughtSlime the boundary of not having other people deny them their experiences and expect them to change their language use despite already explaining why it‚Äôs not an issue?

1325887409456881676 2020-11-10 03:46:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @goodyweaver @daviddoel Yeah, I agree there are legitimate reasons to worry that some people will stop caring about activism when trump gets out of office, but in my opinion, tying an issue like that to an aesthetic thing like ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù minimizes the actual weight of the criticism.
1325886769406103557 2020-11-10 03:43:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Guy42Mao yeah it‚Äôs pretty bizarre   https://t.co/xRz1l1a6HQ
1325885729830998016 2020-11-10 03:39:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @goodyweaver @daviddoel I think the backlash against ‚Äúliberals going back to brunch‚Äù represents a much bigger phenomenon than ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù itself. The idea that your political beliefs are defined by what you consume is a pretty liberal claim, ironically.
1325884982380941312 2020-11-10 03:36:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Guy42Mao my favorite one to dunk on is the cake libertarian one in the balkans that some Czech guy tried to start

1325877337393606656 2020-11-10 03:06:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @goodyweaver @daviddoel that seriously sucks and I‚Äôm sorry that happened, but the idea that ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù somehow represents the neoliberal status quo is a pretty big stretch.

1325717128901664768 2020-11-09 16:29:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> propaganda doesn't have to be created with dishonest intentions for it to be propaganda; in fact, some of the most effective propaganda in history has been aided by the fact that the people promoting it fully believed it was true.
1325715633519161344 2020-11-09 16:23:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if anyone else is familiar with the internal family system, i am currently having a fun experience with the firefighter always in control of my decision-making process 100% of the time, and it's had no negative consequences whatsoever! very fun and cool of me to do that imo

1325599355739443203 2020-11-09 08:41:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> on an unrelated note there's a disproportionately large number of people in the replies talking about how microdosing on acid is the best way forward to improve one's mental health in these times, and honestly that's the only part of the whole thread with any value.
1325598738283433984 2020-11-09 08:39:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> like sure, it's strange to post how you *didn't* do something that you thought about doing, but it really makes the people mad at her for this look like they don't actually care about this specific thing and are just trying to find an excuse to be mad.
1325597990254473216 2020-11-09 08:36:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Marqy_Marqs yeah i agree, this kind of ties into one of my other responses  https://t.co/lSoosMtKWP
1325597661114851328 2020-11-09 08:34:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> and it's honestly fucking annoying that even after she says that she did, in fact, donate despite these sentiments, there's still people insisting she only did it because she's a sociopath looking for public validation. you literally got what you wanted!  https://t.co/nEoqyhkUtK
1325597084679073792 2020-11-09 08:32:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @the_binp it's not like plenty of people haven't already voiced feelings of schadenfreude at trump supporters getting covid and dying, or just being left out in the cold at his rallies, so perhaps it's a question of whether refusing to donate makes you more responsible for their hardship.
1325596288713420803 2020-11-09 08:29:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @the_binp well yeah i guess the core conflict she's expressing is whether it'd be better to help these people in immediate need even though they express reactionary views, or to instead use that money (zero-sum perspective btw) to perhaps do more good by helping more people politically?
1325595570313043968 2020-11-09 08:26:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Marqy_Marqs it just seems like a knee-jerk reaction by those who are hostile to posts like this. "you didn't want your money to help trump supporters so clearly you hate the poor!" "you want us to be nice to RWers to deradicalize them so clearly you don't care about the people they've hurt!"
1325594941830139906 2020-11-09 08:23:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Marqy_Marqs yeah i honestly have no idea what the actual ratio of trump supporters in the region is since her observation was purely anecdotal, and it sounds like she eventually decided to put her emotions aside and donate to the heating fund anyway. so that's a positive outcome at least.
1325592817192857601 2020-11-09 08:15:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Marqy_Marqs yeah really i just think it's funny how some people seem vehemently opposed to the idea of trying to be nice to trump supporters in any way after the harm they've approved of, but simultaneously think it's bad to not want to materially support them as an individual actor.
1325591943720693761 2020-11-09 08:12:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @chrysopoetics @ExistentialEnso that seems like a major issue endemic to online communities. "a bunch of people from X group dogpiled one of my posts so clearly i agree with Y group which is locked in eternal conflict with X" is an oversimplification, but depressingly close to reality in many cases.
1325590900836339721 2020-11-09 08:07:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @chrysopoetics yeah i was gonna say, that almost seemed too on-the-nose considering what people post on here on a daily basis lol
1325590726613340161 2020-11-09 08:07:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> seriously, you're making the dishonest criticisms of how "working-class" is shorthand for poor white people sound like they're accurate, and it's hard to overstate how much that thought annoys me.
1325590313759633408 2020-11-09 08:05:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @YWLLLVCHTHR if i had a problem with aoc's rhetoric and i was a moderate member of the democratic party, i would simply wait until a more opportune time to make those criticisms, like literally even more than a week after winning the election lmao
1325590062952833034 2020-11-09 08:04:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @scramboring yeah same tbh, it's not surprising given how big a factor trump was in politics at the same time the u.s. left expanded so much, so people are gonna have to reconceptualize some stuff.
1325589369567256576 2020-11-09 08:01:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this *is* a weird thing to post, but why are the same people complaining about this for being "anti-poor" suddenly pro-conciliation with open trump supporters when previously such a thought was anathema? you've seriously gotta pick one.
1325588780418560001 2020-11-09 07:59:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @scramboring @LeftHandClutch me 24/7 just sitting normally because i have large forehead veins  https://t.co/KyRlBeuS0i

1325587430884433920 2020-11-09 07:54:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> regardless of whether you side with AOC or the moderates or even just think they're both being dumb rn, you've gotta admit it's pretty embarrassing to have a public intra-party dispute like this in what should be a moment of victory.

1325556169608470533 2020-11-09 05:49:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ExistentialEnso got some interesting responses to this, and it seems like leftism's explicitly anti-capitalist bent leads many to assume that self-IDed "liberals" are similarly pro-capitalist when that may not necessarily apply so strongly.  https://t.co/O96l8z11jw

1325549906212347904 2020-11-09 05:24:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ExistentialEnso it sucks that she has to deal with so much negativity directed at her on a daily basis since she‚Äôs effectively become an effigy of the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù for many people (and has worked that image to her benefit in some cases). that being said, it‚Äôs hardly unique in politics.

1325541888930279424 2020-11-09 04:53:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ExistentialEnso tbf there are many, many reasons to harbor negative views of the us government and its actions in the past, but that shouldn‚Äôt preclude people from recognizing the value of using patriotic rhetoric in certain situations, out of self-interest if nothing else.

1325540387138711552 2020-11-09 04:47:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @atreyupilled their problem in trying to appeal to hardcore conservatives is that the Republican candidate can just out-conservative them by virtue of seeming to hold the positions more genuinely if nothing else.
1325538355677982722 2020-11-09 04:39:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> right-wingers have a similar ‚Äúgood vs evil‚Äù mindset but it‚Äôs at least slightly coherent since they occupy one end of the spectrum, whereas this group views their struggle against the right as all-encompassing &amp; sees any dissent from the left-wing they usually ignore as betrayal.
1325536791911395330 2020-11-09 04:32:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> these people are political Manichaeans utterly incapable of recognizing that anyone could be to their left and disapprove of their ideology. it‚Äôs a completely binary system to them.
1325535839280132096 2020-11-09 04:29:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @bplace01 @Nekkowe @reallyhotpants @GirlFuturist @therecount because they‚Äôre trying to dictate how democrats run their own party? it‚Äôs not an attack, it‚Äôs a response to their public displays of political entitlement. their party lost and we owe them nothing.
1325534237232164864 2020-11-09 04:22:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Jscott1145 it‚Äôs easy to blame outside forces as the sole reason for your repeated losses, but if you outright refuse to do any introspective analysis of how to improve, you deserve the failure that will inevitably result.

1325533339219005441 2020-11-09 04:19:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @dc_us @brown60076 @Jscott1145 is this a critique of representative democracy or just a complaint about how the current parties are structured?
1325532553583976449 2020-11-09 04:16:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GoodAppleClub @Jscott1145 pretty big stretch to assume that every nonvoter in the US holds the same political stance and would be comfortable voting for the Green Party or a similarly left-wing option tbh.
1325531791323762688 2020-11-09 04:13:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Jscott1145 plenty of people are blaming the voting system and media bias, both of which harm the Green Party, but even if neither existed they‚Äôd still be disorganized and rife with every variety of politically homeless cranks under the sun. Assadists, antivaxxers, you name it.

1325526902950518784 2020-11-09 03:53:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @not_shillary @thisAeon @votebleach2020 @ScottGWrites @BethLynch2020 they got the campaign to support a $15 minimum wage and a lot of other stuff in that vein which I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head. obviously it‚Äôs a disadvantageous situation but it‚Äôs wrong to say the left got no concessions whatsoever.

1325342415516020736 2020-11-08 15:40:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @juegosnomas so would it be correct to say then that liberals are like ‚Äúgosh I wish we had nice things‚Äù and leftists tend to be more ‚Äúthis is why we can‚Äôt have nice things‚Äù and thus define themselves more oppositionally to the current political system?

1325337883440459776 2020-11-08 15:22:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> got a question for y‚Äôall: what makes someone a liberal as opposed to a leftist, or vice versa? what are the defining differences?

1325334367812595712 2020-11-08 15:08:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> redditors handle memes with the na√Øvet√© and simplicitude of children; to take those memes from their grasping hands is not only a service to the overall public, but a benevolent act which allows them to continue in their blissful ignorance.
1325331688478695424 2020-11-08 14:57:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cheyne_belinsky @IPM_HQ also (and I don‚Äôt mean to seem like I‚Äôm trying to defend this person; idk who she is) I‚Äôve heard plenty of people talking about how nonwhite and LGBT people need to stay safe after the election because of threats of right-wing violence, so I don‚Äôt see how this tweet is connected.
1325330597770878978 2020-11-08 14:53:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cheyne_belinsky @IPM_HQ if you‚Äôre talking about this tweet and the ones following it, I think she‚Äôs right to clarify that trump only got support from members of the *white* working class, but I don‚Äôt think it constitutes evidence that Bernie is secretly ok with racism or whatever
1325329041696583680 2020-11-08 14:47:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> pretty sure this places them above the threshold for needing a recount (unless I‚Äôm thinking of something else here)

1325222984018223104 2020-11-08 07:45:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> well, either a joke or a lie due to the lack of evidence of cnn actually saying this, but hey it's a post-truth world babey!!

1324060213859782656 2020-11-05 02:45:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> honestly i thought y'all would have saved the good posts for election day but so far i'm not impressed, it's just more of the same. sad!
1324059705614962688 2020-11-05 02:43:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @arias002 @bethanyshondark what "conservative policies" do you think are so good

1324058256583569408 2020-11-05 02:37:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Solidarity_Star starting to think the whole "the left has a problem with anti-semitism" discourse may have been poisoned by bad actors from the start tbh
1324057976051814401 2020-11-05 02:36:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ev__tm @Solidarity_Star @RashidaTlaib if you care more about "rhetoric" than facts you can just say you don't give a shit about improving the material reality of anyone and are more concerned with optics and looking pretty. go bother someone else with this shallow aesthetic bullshit.

1324056831933751298 2020-11-05 02:32:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @arias002 @bethanyshondark can you maybe be a little more specific

1324054641617887237 2020-11-05 02:23:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AntifaSarkeesi3 i thought the election actually happening after months of anticipation pickling our brains would make people shut up for once but it seems like it pushed them into overdrive instead
1324037153974898689 2020-11-05 01:13:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Tony_simp_rano is this a specific subtweet or just a general truth because I agree with both

1323995746195132417 2020-11-04 22:29:19 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @loosebricks @JordanUhl the gop‚Äôs bigotry offers them an easy scapegoat to blame for all their problems, which works better in the short-term than democrats‚Äô habit of pretending their problems just don‚Äôt exist.
1323994294458396682 2020-11-04 22:23:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @umamesoul @Lordstanley2016 @ryangrim @JoshuaHol Where does it say amendments have to be restricted for individual rights only? Show me the specific clause that says that. (Hint: there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt one.) Over the years, they‚Äôve changed everything from the way Vice Presidents and senators are elected to the ways budgets can be made.
1323828105874755589 2020-11-04 11:23:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @umamesoul @Lordstanley2016 @ryangrim @JoshuaHol yes, and the federal government does the same thing with state funding. again, this is a subjective argument. and the founding fathers explicitly created a process to amend the constitution because they knew it would need to be adapted as the country grew and changed.
1323824488635617281 2020-11-04 11:08:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @anarchotokonoko especially considering the current legal action with USPS to get them to locate all the ballots in their facilities
1323821725117829122 2020-11-04 10:57:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @evrypaneofglass libertarian voters are mostly conservatives who‚Äôd support trump over Biden so this argument doesn‚Äôt apply in this instance

1323820528189231105 2020-11-04 10:53:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @umamesoul @textualdeviance @FurnitureBruise @ryangrim why shouldn‚Äôt he? the president leads the country he lives in, right?
1323820423625297921 2020-11-04 10:52:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @umamesoul @FurnitureBruise @ryangrim of course it makes sense, your evidence disproves your own point lol
1323820125687087104 2020-11-04 10:51:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @joessbob @FurnitureBruise @ryangrim the way the head of state is elected has nothing to do with federalism. if things were more centralized they‚Äôd just appoint governments from Washington, which is obviously not happening.
1323819824506687490 2020-11-04 10:50:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @flyastroapple @FurnitureBruise @ryangrim as opposed to now, when the vast majority of rural states are dismissed as solid red states, and the rural voters in solid blue states are equally dismissed as unimportant?

1323760364815896576 2020-11-04 06:53:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the verb ‚Äúpoggers‚Äù was coined to describe people who participated in the Victorian-era social activity of ‚Äúpogging,‚Äù which involved blindfolds, croquet mallets, and copious amounts of absinthe. it was outlawed in 1895 after a particularly brutal pogging meetup led to nine deaths.

1323745186632110082 2020-11-04 05:53:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Dystopian_Rob this is true but imo it didn‚Äôt have to be a deliberate effort since Bernie‚Äôs 2016 base was largely an anti-Hillary coalition which splintered into ideological blocs since the 2020 primary was way more wide-open at first.

Without significant economic reforms, it just causes the wealth gap to grow even more fractured. The US needs to take accountability for its role in destabilizing other countries and making emigration from them so high.

1323488535542988801 2020-11-03 12:53:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CheyenneRandell exactly, which is why it makes no sense to make the left‚Äôs reaction to the whole corbyn situation into evidence of anti-semitism when it‚Äôs public knowledge that it was faked

1323105699501613057 2020-11-02 11:32:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @NyaVixa it's so sad how terfs try to cope with how much everyone else hates them by claiming it's all because of sexism, when in reality it has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with how pathetic and insufferable they are :)
1323099414580350976 2020-11-02 11:07:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NyaVixa so fucking corny omg
1323097178089398272 2020-11-02 10:58:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NyaVixa they'd probably agree with it too tbh. there's a high level of overlap between terfs and the alt-right.
1323096985029791746 2020-11-02 10:57:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @NyaVixa @GangstaSpngbob getting upset about children's cartoons, like a normal well-adjusted person
1323096757669109765 2020-11-02 10:57:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NyaVixa terf ideology has done more to promote abuse than the "trans agenda" they blame for everything
1323096259633291265 2020-11-02 10:55:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NyaVixa yeahhh this person seems like they've got their own deep-seated psychological issues to work through and attacking other people with this false projection of confidence is their coping mechanism.
1323095823463436289 2020-11-02 10:53:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @NyaVixa "i went through a bad experience so other people should just suck it up and deal with it" OR, hear me out here, you could choose to be a decent fucking person instead of a bitter pathetic excuse of a living organism lol
1323095359707615233 2020-11-02 10:51:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @comedicarsonist @NyaVixa @TrumpHatesVets @stene1978 women are much more likely to engage in psychological abuse tactics than men, so by your logic there's no reason to spend any time around women either
1323095045222838272 2020-11-02 10:50:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @NyaVixa @TrumpHatesVets @stene1978 that's because "rape" is defined specifically to only include penetration, which means that overall statistics for sexual assault are much more balanced. it's always funny when terfs lie about statistics to make themselves seem like perfect angels because it's so easy to debunk!
1323094741903413259 2020-11-02 10:49:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HReed_ @NyaVixa @TrumpHatesVets @stene1978 as everyone knows, there's a magic barrier that prevents "female spaces" from being entered by men, unless they identify as trans women first! really top-tier arguments here lmao

1322651539895390208 2020-11-01 05:27:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> also aside from the right-wing rhetoric greenwald is indulging in here (the fucking "Deep State?" really?), his voice is also incredibly annoying to listen to. just incredibly nasal and querulous
1322651099891961856 2020-11-01 05:26:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> love to be a "truth-telling independent journalist" and claim the Radical Left‚Ñ¢ is conspiring with its longtime allies, neocons and the CIA, to overthrow trump. very normal stuff seriously though this is just budget qanon with the serial numbers filed off  https://t.co/AOW8xSQ4SO

1321481065022824449 2020-10-28 23:56:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> sorry I didn‚Äôt respond to any of my emails, I was too busy listening to ‚Äúapex predator‚Äù from the mean girls musical on repeat

1321284816675942401 2020-10-28 10:57:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype yeah, if there was an actual chance of the American left sweeping away the institutions of capitalism via revolution in the short or even medium-term I‚Äôd be thrilled, but that requires a ton of preconditions that simply don‚Äôt exist right now.

1321279800493879298 2020-10-28 10:37:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> it‚Äôs not that I think electoralism is the ideal method, it‚Äôs that in the current political climate in the U.S. any attempt at revolution, whether by a vanguard or an anarchist autonomous zone or whatever, would fail completely
1321279094659653639 2020-10-28 10:34:19 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the funny part here is actually that I managed to get more Marxist-Leninist support than any form of anarchism
1321278887935004674 2020-10-28 10:33:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this seems like a disconnect between ‚Äúwhat is the ideal solution‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat is practical in the immediate future‚Äù tbh

1321228770653708288 2020-10-28 07:14:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LeafOnHead he uses the word "Woke" in every tweet (capitalized!) without ever defining what he's actually referring to. absolutely nonsensical
1321228061820489731 2020-10-28 07:11:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @schmeltRskeltR exactly, revolution--or any other strategy--is only worthwhile if you can actually win. otherwise talking about it is just self-congratulatory posturing.

1321221668489043968 2020-10-28 06:46:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SalamandersuitE has she made a sincere apology and tried to improve, or is she only now trying to address and downplay it by complaining that people are judging her by her past? like it's great if she's changed since then and realized how shitty she was but if it's just a grift then why bother?

1320806939895435266 2020-10-27 03:18:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @libraryluna kinda trying not to hate myself at this point for not getting it done sooner when I could‚Äôve but my mental health has been weird lately where I get some days where I just can‚Äôt find motivation to do anything, so I guess at this point it‚Äôs better to just move forward? idk
1320806450453749762 2020-10-27 03:16:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> one has to go  https://t.co/8y6azylUeR
1320805417061146626 2020-10-27 03:12:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @v10lets I have no doubt that every account unironically posting stuff like this is doing it because they actually care and not just to get cheap engagement
1320804991368630272 2020-10-27 03:10:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> was the American revolution a color revolution? discuss  (Disclaimer: I do not know what this means)

1320804554846457857 2020-10-27 03:08:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Powerful_Mousse I think she knows something we don‚Äôt

1320803607063728128 2020-10-27 03:04:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @libraryluna I had a shitty week last week where I did nothing and now I basically just need to pick up the pieces and get all the shit i missed done, which sucks for entirely different reasons
1320801552442007552 2020-10-27 02:56:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now don‚Äôt you know I still believe (still believe) that you will be here and give me a sign HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME  https://t.co/HhZvUk1Xnc

1320779287138607105 2020-10-27 01:28:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny considering the number of women who have gotten away with sexual assault because they were able to manipulate others into viewing them as the victim, it‚Äôs a perfectly legit concern. and I can‚Äôt believe this needs to be said, but legality =/= morality.
1320777778334224385 2020-10-27 01:22:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny what advantage are you looking to gain from this semantic argument? are you seriously trying to claim one type of sexual assault is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the other? that‚Äôs absolutely vile.
1320771895818625026 2020-10-27 00:58:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lukecmahler you‚Äôll always be my president queen üëë

1320765360325492744 2020-10-27 00:32:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny so does it apply to you or not? and if not, do you agree with it?
1320764415499816963 2020-10-27 00:29:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny so are you saying you‚Äôre an exception to the rest of your terf friends?
1320763841144365058 2020-10-27 00:26:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garfpoop simply embrace the Situation instead
1320763710617563137 2020-10-27 00:26:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> going through my bookmarks and I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why I saved some of the stuff there
1320763349509033984 2020-10-27 00:24:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny when did I say you specifically brought it up? this seems like yet another case of your ego acting up unfortunately
1320762698678808577 2020-10-27 00:22:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny yes, that‚Äôs my tweet, I wrote it after all
1320762329634623489 2020-10-27 00:20:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra oh we‚Äôre still doing this huh  https://t.co/5iEZ3saUXH

1320762037090344961 2020-10-27 00:19:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse I understand it must be tough to interact with people who refuse to entertain your shitty arguments, feel free to do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel comfy again üòÅ
1320761243192463363 2020-10-27 00:16:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra bold of you to assume I have any interest in trying to convince you of anything when it‚Äôs just as fun to mock your lack of intelligence
1320761094047227904 2020-10-27 00:15:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny do you understand what ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù means? I know you people are afraid of pronouns but if you actually don‚Äôt know what a second-person PLURAL is it‚Äôs a wonder you‚Äôre able to communicate in the English language
1320760870855729152 2020-10-27 00:15:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra what is this, 2014? slow your roll Ben Shapiro
1320760744196087810 2020-10-27 00:14:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse you‚Äôre kidding right? over and over, as you learn more about a subject it‚Äôs explained that the simplifications used to teach the basics are actually wrong and there *are* ways to get around them. it‚Äôs like using long division instead of remainders. that‚Äôs just called growing up!
1320759852227067905 2020-10-27 00:11:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra which videos have I even recommended? right now it sounds like you just think anything that disagrees with you is propaganda, which isn‚Äôt surprising considering how indoctrinated you are
1320759647662411777 2020-10-27 00:10:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny figure out why y‚Äôall are so obsessed with pads and go from there instead of bothering me about it lol
1320759529139851264 2020-10-27 00:09:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra and there are plenty of articles at the top that also agree with us but you‚Äôre refusing to read them for some strange reason ü§î
1320758344286691331 2020-10-27 00:05:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse if your understanding of biology is still at a third grade level that sounds like a you problem tbh
1320758207246204934 2020-10-27 00:04:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra you‚Äôve repeatedly trumpeted your lack of cultural context as if it makes you smarter instead of just an uninformed dumbass
1320758035812405250 2020-10-27 00:03:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny ew definitely not, if I wanted you to explain terf sexual fetishes I‚Äôd ask you to do so
1320757875950628865 2020-10-27 00:03:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra imagine getting a newspaper subscription and only reading the headlines on the front page before throwing the rest of the paper away
1320757724360179713 2020-10-27 00:02:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra this u?  https://t.co/MT6C8uVwlx
1320757242552066049 2020-10-27 00:00:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse nah you‚Äôre just larping as an intellectual when all your arguments could be debunked by a third-grader
1320756789344874496 2020-10-26 23:58:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra imagine saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what that is‚Äù and expecting a pat on the back instead of getting mocked for your ignorance
1320756632574459904 2020-10-26 23:58:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny ask the weirdo who posted it in the first place, or pay me if you expect me to do all your research for you
1320756104561889281 2020-10-26 23:56:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra google isn‚Äôt on anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúside‚Äù when you can use it to look up a shitton of people-trans arguments you choose to ignore lol
1320755726697046016 2020-10-26 23:54:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra at it again I see  https://t.co/6TmW3BCNI1

1320754242408382465 2020-10-26 23:48:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra says the person who sounds like they‚Äôre reading off the script of a prageru video üòÇ

1320753814849421314 2020-10-26 23:47:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra clearly not if you‚Äôre so incapable of learning what other people are talking about üòè
1320753426381316096 2020-10-26 23:45:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra the ‚Äúproof‚Äù consists of you posting screenshots from google and crying whenever you get the slightest bit of pushback on your claims so calling this a debate is frankly giving your infantile arguments too much credit.
1320752829699641345 2020-10-26 23:43:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse sure you aren‚Äôt lmao  https://t.co/ALbOPzQrrd

1320752476476350465 2020-10-26 23:41:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra feel free to read my original response again at your leisure üòâ

1320751746063437824 2020-10-26 23:38:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny nice try but I‚Äôm not going to touch terf fetishes with a ten foot pole üòñ

1320751093257744384 2020-10-26 23:36:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra so you admit you‚Äôre wrong and the only reason you‚Äôre doing this is to soothe your ego? wow that was easy
1320750534266114048 2020-10-26 23:34:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse it‚Äôs such an easy way to make insecure assholes like you incomprehensibly mad so it‚Äôs clearly working well
1320750327491166209 2020-10-26 23:33:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TransGirlTerra @StariUniverse @fedpill @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny lmao that didn‚Äôt take long  https://t.co/CbUCv837VG

1320749686932852736 2020-10-26 23:30:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra I just did, it says you‚Äôre wrong
1320749615965179904 2020-10-26 23:30:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra I call it like I see it, and when I see terfs complaining about other people being ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù it‚Äôs obvious how you‚Äôre just coping for your own incomprehension of reality
1320749105853964290 2020-10-26 23:28:19 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @fedpill @tramisogyny @Woke_Misogyny if you don‚Äôt want people to be misogynists then y‚Äôall could start by not telling people they secretly want to eat your bloody pads or whatever fucking delusions you believe in
1320748765691731968 2020-10-26 23:26:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra I bet your search history is just ‚Äúadult human female‚Äù over and over lmao

1320747669627805699 2020-10-26 23:22:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra if you actually think you‚Äôve managed to threaten anyone with your dusty right-wing fallacies your delusion must run deeper than I thought!
1320747386050908161 2020-10-26 23:21:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra that‚Äôs a lot of words when you could‚Äôve just said you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about lmao

1320746660222390272 2020-10-26 23:18:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra some sources use different definitions? wow, I literally never knew that until now, that‚Äôs crazy. almost like just saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs the objective definition lol‚Äù isn‚Äôt an actual argument...
1320746144297852929 2020-10-26 23:16:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @fedpill if you cared about ‚Äúfemale boundaries‚Äù you‚Äôd enforce sharia law for female protection but believe it or not we live in a western society which doesn‚Äôt segregate every activity on the basis of gender
1320745945689165824 2020-10-26 23:15:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra @fedpill case in point lmaooo
1320745808371830789 2020-10-26 23:15:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra exactly, and it‚Äôs still just as wrong as before
1320745750901510144 2020-10-26 23:14:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra I‚Äôd tell you to see a psychologist to take care of the deep-seated mental instability that makes you act like this but it‚Äôs pretty obvious that you‚Äôre beyond help
1320745471762178049 2020-10-26 23:13:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @feminazi333 @TransGirlTerra there are few things that bring me more delight than making it blatantly obvious that terfs are illogical morons :)
1320745236499435524 2020-10-26 23:12:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TransGirlTerra @fedpill @StariUniverse ‚Äúnoooo that‚Äôs one of the wrong objective definitions, unlike my objective definitions which are all correct and accurate!!!‚Äù

1320744880604389379 2020-10-26 23:11:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra there‚Äôs this magic thing called google that helps you look up things you don‚Äôt know about. though tbh if terfs cared about learning about things they‚Äôre ignorant of they probably wouldn‚Äôt be terfs in the first place ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1320744450063245313 2020-10-26 23:09:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra terfs are incredibly triggered whenever anyone describes them as ‚Äúcis‚Äù so it‚Äôs not exactly out of the blue unlike literally everything you‚Äôve said

1320744052556484609 2020-10-26 23:08:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra you‚Äôre the one who assumed the only reason I‚Äôd think your arguments suck is because I‚Äôm trans. most cis people don‚Äôt agree with your radical agenda because it‚Äôs obvious to everyone else that you‚Äôre just projecting your own insecurities into everyone else
1320743823954366465 2020-10-26 23:07:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra if I wanted to enable delusions I‚Äôd get in the terf echo chamber and start grifting random people like graham linehan or something
1320743642961764354 2020-10-26 23:06:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra y‚Äôall freak out whenever anyone says the word ‚Äúcisgender‚Äù so I can‚Äôt say I take your claims of hurt feelings from words all that seriously lol
1320742864658288640 2020-10-26 23:03:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra I don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúattack your femininity‚Äù when it‚Äôs already so damaged that you‚Äôre lashing out like this. go do something healthy instead of indulging in this weird right-wing debatebro fantasy that makes you look like an idiot.
1320741932289740801 2020-10-26 22:59:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @feminazi333 @TransGirlTerra imagine thinking I care about your feelings on Twitter dot com  https://t.co/JRx7iHyGis

1320741676470702080 2020-10-26 22:58:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra maybe I just need to stew my brain in prageru videos until I lose all capacity for coherent thought, then I‚Äôll undo the ‚ÄúTRA brainwashing‚Äù or whatever lmao
1320741441736482816 2020-10-26 22:57:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @feminazi333 @TransGirlTerra the only thing funnier than my original tweet is that you‚Äôre actually taking it seriously lmao
1320741218704334849 2020-10-26 22:56:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra you‚Äôre the one who tried to present trans people and race fakers as being equivalent issues despite them being completely different for multiple core reasons. just admit you have no argument lol

1320740527164239875 2020-10-26 22:54:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra I said ‚Äútransblack‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist, which you still haven‚Äôt proven because literally nobody has used that word to describe dolezal or any other race fakers. stay mad lol
1320740169926979585 2020-10-26 22:52:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra oh yeah it‚Äôs totally the 5g or the chemicals in the water or whatever, you‚Äôre not just delusional i promise  https://t.co/iO3xqz7iYM
1320739860395732994 2020-10-26 22:51:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra because the only part of your body that isn‚Äôt affected by your disgusting toxicity is the part that physically doesn‚Äôt exist?
1320739346639736834 2020-10-26 22:49:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @feminazi333 @TransGirlTerra this tweet turned me into a misogynist

1320735929905127425 2020-10-26 22:35:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StariUniverse @TransGirlTerra how is she ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù when you‚Äôre the ones screaming about dictionaries and genitals in her replies like a couple of really Normal, Well-Adjusted people
1320735692759175171 2020-10-26 22:35:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra does yelling at random people do anything for you sexually? or is being an asshole just habit for you at this point?

1320735375049052161 2020-10-26 22:33:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fedpill @TransGirlTerra if your ability to recognize nuance is so stunted that you can only learn from dictionary definitions, that seems like a you problem tbh
1320735067812073472 2020-10-26 22:32:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> is it vain to listen to listen to the songs from the ‚Äúhair‚Äù musical while brushing my actual hair every morning
1320734378935410688 2020-10-26 22:29:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @pidrosoft @jdvogt that‚Äôs an unfair comparison, Mondrian‚Äôs paintings actually took effort and creativity to produce
1320656341241892864 2020-10-26 17:19:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> now before you say anything, YES this could‚Äôve been avoided if I‚Äôd utilized better time management skills, but it‚Äôs not like that makes any difference now does it
1320653254032789504 2020-10-26 17:07:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if I get screwed over by turning in the assignments a day late then I guess that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna have to happen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1320651101138493440 2020-10-26 16:58:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @buster_nutlas uhhhhhhhh an entire chapter of statistics work I haven‚Äôt touched until now and a writeup about Marxism and the cold war‚Äôs effects on Latin America
1320650337120825345 2020-10-26 16:55:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @garfpope that‚Äôs a very good question

1320573764711710720 2020-10-26 11:51:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HueyLongReturns @JustDevBK @posadist_trapgd @4aPeoplesParty the republicans had a clear position as the north-centric "free soil"/anti-slavery party which could absorb the remnants of the whigs as the political landscape realigned in a north vs. south divide. the situation back then was very different to what it's like now.
1320572690143563777 2020-10-26 11:47:19 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @drawmeclocksjoe @posadist_trapgd yeah that's a good point, i guess the question is really just whether they're able to make the most of the resources they get and what ends up happening with that
1320571894031093761 2020-10-26 11:44:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @reallyhotpants finally someone is saying it

1320539042761613314 2020-10-26 09:33:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @shafieikeyvan true, but the implication here is that voting green actively challenges the democratic establishment which is just patently false
1320532918989688833 2020-10-26 09:09:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EwatomiAbara i'm curious to hear your opinion

1320517764931555331 2020-10-26 08:09:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @originalnameM after some days of thought and mediation i've found the incredibly powerful light and truth of scientology. L Ron Hubbard was a more influential leftist theorist than marx and his work has formed the basis of many others, posadas and stirner being the most prominent examples.
1320513875402493952 2020-10-26 07:53:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Bel_Biv_Devos well APPARENTLY there was a video on pornhub of a trans girl fucking a pumpkin, or so i've heard

1320505234817458177 2020-10-26 07:19:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> These men didn‚Äôt play video games. These men didn‚Äôt post selfies on social media.

1320503222453346304 2020-10-26 07:11:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FullCommie @Yahweh47613078 @CommunistsEgirl it's not something that can be easily defined per se, but it seems like the essay essentializes "liberalism" without considering specific historic circumstances. the essay condemns it in a way that seems likely to encourage individualized performances of radicalism.
1320499913168474115 2020-10-26 06:58:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FullCommie @Yahweh47613078 @CommunistsEgirl i can see how these viewpoints originate but its definition of "liberalism" is different from its use in both academic and common cultural contexts. it'd make more sense to use a term like "vulgar individualism." it seems like a conflation of morality and organizational strength.
1320496979168972802 2020-10-26 06:46:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @vit_sem_c @uwunibomber you're right, everywhere in the world is exactly the same and we don't need to tailor our strategy to specific societal conditions at all

1320495963115499520 2020-10-26 06:42:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @originalnameM why are people still making tweets like these, the genre is completely stale
1320495832781783042 2020-10-26 06:41:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FullCommie @Yahweh47613078 @CommunistsEgirl regardless of whether it's good to follow people you don't 100% agree with or not, how does "liberalism" have anything to do with that?
1320460356028944386 2020-10-26 04:20:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @atreyupilled they really gave her that dumptruck tho

1320456437311721483 2020-10-26 04:05:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @kementari @Boringstein @kittynouveau you‚Äôre taking your hostility out on the wrong people then. If it‚Äôs easier for you to criticize responsible travelers than the thousands of people who still don‚Äôt bother wearing masks or avoiding crowded spaces, then maybe that‚Äôs something that needs to be addressed on your end?
1320453767544905730 2020-10-26 03:54:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @kementari @Boringstein @kittynouveau I think if you‚Äôre resorting to this level of hostility to someone pointing out reasonable ways to make the best of this situation then you‚Äôve clearly got your own shit going on
1320453442578558976 2020-10-26 03:53:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MipsselledName @Boringstein @kittynouveau you‚Äôre missing the point; the reason for this is, as you said, we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt handle not traveling yet‚Äù so if it‚Äôs too difficult to force people to stop doing that we should at least try to make them more responsible about it.
1320453026201612295 2020-10-26 03:51:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @kementari @Boringstein @kittynouveau so basically the same thing as people who‚Äôve sequestered themselves away as much as possible taking out their frustration on those who have traveled a bit more while still being safe?

1319764257756598272 2020-10-24 06:14:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LeftistPolls prisons are used to hide people who are afflicted by social problems rather than addressing the conditions which cause them in the first place. if you put more cops in a community, of course you're going to find more crime. it's just a question of which groups get targeted.
1319763670260473857 2020-10-24 06:12:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LeftistPolls having prisoners be used for cheap labor is fundamentally problematic and ensures the ruling class has a vested interest in incarcerating more people and maintaining a police state in marginalized communities. this is true regardless of whether the prison system is privatized.
1319763257603796996 2020-10-24 06:10:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LeftistPolls policing and prisons as they currently stand are absolutely irredeemable. felons are denied the economic and political rights they need to be part of society, and this only makes recidivism more likely since crime is the main avenue for them to survive. and that is intentional.
1319734395478118415 2020-10-24 04:16:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades he looks like he's seen some shit  https://t.co/L58i2QMncP
1319733616717516800 2020-10-24 04:13:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @celine_dionysus that's right
1319733400945762307 2020-10-24 04:12:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TrevTell somewhat but for some reason i've also found myself altering my memories so that i'm masked in them which is trippy
1319732640094818305 2020-10-24 04:09:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> ok i just found this poem called "stop all the clocks" by this guy named wystan hugh auden and it's super gay and it goes HARD like holy shit  https://t.co/ES679zPvO9
1319731561059811328 2020-10-24 04:04:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lukecmahler if nothing else they've probably gotten a ton of free publicity from all this

1319730946871070732 2020-10-24 04:02:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FinalOverdrive yeah either way it's just weird word choice all around
1319730587087810561 2020-10-24 04:01:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Tony_simp_rano in retrospect they probably shouldn't've made it look so similar to a political compass since that's the only way people on this hellsite know how to parse political views
1319730091627368454 2020-10-24 03:59:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if somebody unironically says something makes them feel "icky" i automatically personify them as being two years old

1319727316256292865 2020-10-24 03:48:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @object_reality @VisceraEater @theserfstv @shoe0nhead as a former right-libertarian, let me just plant some seeds of my own: the "free market" is a ruse. capitalism always tends towards inefficient monopolies and gross exploitation of workers. there's no time in history where society has prospered without the state reining it in.

Also, the topography there has faster-running rivers which made early mills easier to power since they used water wheels. Indoor labor was difficult in the southern heat before A/C.

1319170595335143424 2020-10-22 14:55:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mettahapa @poopycarrot @amara_ouimet he conceded because the rest of the party coalesced behind Biden as a last resort and his support wasn‚Äôt enough to overcome that. it‚Äôs *possible* threats were involved but I haven‚Äôt seen any particularly credible evidence.

1318989687755837441 2020-10-22 02:57:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> hearing liberals complain about "trump bad" is exhausting, but the leftists who act all smug about it whenever anyone says anything that sounds remotely like acknowledging trump sucks need to shut up forever too lol
1318989228706091011 2020-10-22 02:55:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @saladgrl i'm confused why you keep framing this argument as if the entire argument is being targeted at one singular voter. if the claim was "if you are the *only* person voting then it's super important for you to do so" then that'd be one thing, but to me this just seems like a nitpick.
1318943100732116993 2020-10-21 23:51:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EngagedRidley @ContraPoints I totally agree and it‚Äôs also important long-term to consider why there‚Äôs such an undercurrent of reactionary thought in this country, which would still manifest as conservative parties even in a multiparty system.
1318942696464056320 2020-10-21 23:50:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @saladgrl @ContraPoints Well personally I‚Äôm mostly motivated by how much it‚Äôll piss off conservatives to defeat trump, but it seems like your objection is more based on whether individuals‚Äô actions matter when they act as part of a collective?
1318942070602686464 2020-10-21 23:47:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EngagedRidley @ContraPoints I understand this concern but frankly I‚Äôll take something with the potential to be better rather than accepting this current shitshow out of some desire to avert hypothetical fears.
1318941293213585408 2020-10-21 23:44:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @saladgrl @ContraPoints messages aren‚Äôt targeted at any one individual specifically, that‚Äôs the nature of social media. I understand what you‚Äôre saying but if the person sending this message has a big platform I don‚Äôt see how your objection that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just one vote‚Äù is relevant.
1318940787909025792 2020-10-21 23:42:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GishKnight @ContraPoints Occupy died because there was no clear strategic direction for the protests. That‚Äôs an issue for any nascent movement regardless of the specific politics involved.
1318937648493416448 2020-10-21 23:30:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mithaldu yeah regardless of what sincere beliefs she holds it‚Äôs pretty clear that she‚Äôs got no interest in any good-faith discussion of anything she says.
1318937460466946048 2020-10-21 23:29:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mithaldu and it‚Äôs definitely important to note that right-wing extremists see people teaching kids it‚Äôs ok to be LGBT as pedophiles in disguise while ignoring the actual pedos in their midst
1318936946866032648 2020-10-21 23:27:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mithaldu she‚Äôs already platformed and legitimized white supremacists in the past so it‚Äôs no surprise she‚Äôd echo their hypocritical rhetoric with this yet again

1318752368004075521 2020-10-21 11:14:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NotAScaly @THESLUDGEBOSS @worstcaseeng @PhilUprising @ContraPoints there's not enough support for revolutionary leftism, and having trump in office doesn't help. if the only reason libs are fighting him is because he's uncivil or whatever, they were never going to help the left in the first place, but others can be convinced over time.
1318750096637513728 2020-10-21 11:04:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NotAScaly @THESLUDGEBOSS @worstcaseeng @PhilUprising @ContraPoints you need to meet people where they're at. the number of americans supportive of revolution is tiny. my parents used to be conservatives but they've become more liberal in recent years and i've talked them around to some socialist ideas. it's a process bigger than one election.
1318743199402364928 2020-10-21 10:37:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NotAScaly @THESLUDGEBOSS @worstcaseeng @PhilUprising @ContraPoints if the only way to gain the support of the liberal working class is to have trump in office, the left needs better tactics.

1318731126161219585 2020-10-21 09:49:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AmbJohnBoIton wtf am i looking at here

1318729102732546053 2020-10-21 09:41:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @NotAScaly @THESLUDGEBOSS @worstcaseeng @PhilUprising @ContraPoints he's less right-wing than trump on a number of issues, and if you choose to ignore that it's on you. they both suck but it's blatantly obvious which one is the better option by comparison.

1318662323830198272 2020-10-21 05:16:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SimonSimplicio @KyleKulinski if you actually think the reason we didn't invade iran is because trump and his administration are less hawkish than them, you're absolutely delusional.

1318430853467426821 2020-10-20 13:56:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @VaushV @merrickdeville @kilyourlandlord i agree, which is why i tweeted it üòâ
1318430705458794496 2020-10-20 13:55:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @merrickdeville @VaushV @kilyourlandlord um, do you not understand what "comparison" is? like, how you can evaluate two things and consider one to be better than the other without being "good" on a separate scale?
1318430388805685249 2020-10-20 13:54:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @merrickdeville @VaushV @kilyourlandlord i've asked you multiple times to elaborate on your argument and you've never done anything beyond respond with a quote-tweet of what i already said.
1318430181619544065 2020-10-20 13:53:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MrMapleBeanz no, that's exactly what i'm NOT saying. other people on the left are aware of that and yet still disagree with your take on this issue; it doesn't inherently mean they know less than you about u.s. colonialism.
1318429534035845122 2020-10-20 13:51:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MrMapleBeanz @StrangeAlienSky acting like the only reason people could disagree with you is because they're ignorant isn't a great way to convince them of your position.
1318429167139065861 2020-10-20 13:49:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @DaddyFrankD @StrangeAlienSky @JackElgin7 @YeezyCumYeezyGo that's not even a real word, just a couple of bad-sounding things smushed together. can you provide a concrete definition for what you're describing?
1318428710723309569 2020-10-20 13:47:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @merrickdeville @VaushV @kilyourlandlord my favorite part of that tweet is the part where i say it's okay, because it literally does not exist

1318427365924573184 2020-10-20 13:42:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @patheticyourmom @hotchipliar look up "trypophobia" but be prepared to feel very uncomfortable if you don't like how this looks
1318426625881624576 2020-10-20 13:39:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @merrickdeville @VaushV @kilyourlandlord nobody said it's "okay" but if you're gonna attack him it looks pretty stupid to be pointing at him when the other guy immediately starts yelling "oy vey" and being a nazi POS in general. like people are definitely gonna gravitate towards the nazi as being the worse option lol
1318425779613696000 2020-10-20 13:36:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @merrickdeville @VaushV @kilyourlandlord yes i can read what i wrote, now explain how your response is actually relevant. i never made any comparison between racism and anti-semitism lmao

1318423653533601792 2020-10-20 13:27:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CobbBenefield @VaushV @merrickdeville @kilyourlandlord yes that's exactly what i said, good job

1318423329645219841 2020-10-20 13:26:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @bountay_ biden sucks but if you actually think he's equivalent to trump's fascist politicking you're delusional lmao
1318422852706705408 2020-10-20 13:24:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @princeianggh @E5ten @Nadagast @bountay_ @itzpamk he's definitely pretty right-leaning compared to a good chunk of his party but he's not a fascist by any reasonable definition.
1318421535150006272 2020-10-20 13:19:23 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @merrickdeville @CobbBenefield @VaushV @kilyourlandlord yeah like i'm not gonna defend what he did but when the other guy in the clip gleefully launches into weird anti-semitic dogwhistles it makes him look *pretty* good by comparison!
1318420043521269760 2020-10-20 13:13:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Emberflux @Doyouwantapizz1 @BreadPill_ wow congrats you figured it out

1318417889771347968 2020-10-20 13:04:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @hotchipliar @Tony_simp_rano if i recall correctly somebody's tweet about balkanizing the united states got big the other day so it could be in reference to that?

1317589393272688648 2020-10-18 06:12:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> these are the weirdos who want to abolish the fda and the cdc and you people are apparently so obsessed with your third-party fantasy that you think their positions matter less than the fact that they don't have mainstream support. you should be GLAD they're fringe FFS.
1317588940937957379 2020-10-18 06:10:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MarxismTonight ok slow your roll there paula deen
1317588805130518528 2020-10-18 06:10:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StephenHasALife @enbycircle @Karen_Kong_ @ShingoYoungstar @INTPlefty no, because getting 5% is no guarantee of further support. first-past-the-post voting makes it irrelevant since it's only really mathematically viable to have two big-tent parties.
1317588341555167234 2020-10-18 06:08:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> so many people in the replies jacking it to "breaking up the duopoly" ... like, you realize the libertarians are even more economically right-wing than republicans, right?
1317587896979890184 2020-10-18 06:06:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @matglitchrix @INTPlefty it's called "getting a shit-ton of money from billionaires."  https://t.co/vTTrW0CRgi
1317587590992855046 2020-10-18 06:05:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FeralMinette @INTPlefty how is the radical pro-capitalist party getting even more votes a good thing lol
1317587408771317761 2020-10-18 06:04:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MamaEarthAngry @INTPlefty libertarians would just gut welfare and social programs, making life worse for working-class people while allowing the wave of privatization to make the rich even richer. that's not "overthrowing the oligarchy," it's entrenching capitalism even further.
1317587085222645765 2020-10-18 06:03:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ModusFuzzySmock @MisterCash420 @MamaEarthAngry @INTPlefty the ones who lead and fund the party are.
1317586527996829696 2020-10-18 06:01:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @StephenHasALife @enbycircle @Karen_Kong_ @ShingoYoungstar @INTPlefty regardless of the efficacy of voting itself, the electoral system just isn't designed for third parties to succeed. you'd need to change that before just trying to break in with no other strategy.

1317537521627242496 2020-10-18 02:46:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fireandrinstone while there are some who engage in similar conspiratorial thinking, I think it‚Äôs a serious stretch to put them on the same level. in some leftists‚Äô haste to push back on that, they end up dismissing the idea that it happened at all.
1317402952735313920 2020-10-17 17:51:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BrakishDjordje take the "centricide" focus

1317401500285624320 2020-10-17 17:46:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @realjustinzero @delmoi @ryangrim this just isn't how social media works. if you want a platform to succeed, you need more than just "hey we're twitter without the censorship" or you'll just attract chuds like gab did. as things stand now, it's very difficult for new platforms to gain widespread adoption.
1317399688841134080 2020-10-17 17:38:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @roun_sa_ville oh yeah that's where the hobbits are
1317399387262341120 2020-10-17 17:37:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> believe me, i got just as sick as you of the mueller cult and all the other bizarre pageantry enabled by the media, but the difference between you and me is i didn't turn into a baby-brained contrarian and prioritized feelings over facts like y'all apparently have.
1317399034043260929 2020-10-17 17:36:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> as fun as it is to dunk on libs i've gotta admit that the leftists who suddenly turn into trump supporters whenever """russiagate""" is brought up are fucking annoying. just because it was overblown and used as an excuse for dems' failures doesn't mean it didn't happen at all.
1317398441903984642 2020-10-17 17:33:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> it just clicked for me that when some people say "x was the worst president" they mean he was bad at the job, but for other people "worst president" means the guy who did the most tangible harm regardless of how competent his admin was at "holding the country together" &amp; so forth
1317397742369595392 2020-10-17 17:31:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @egoposting i will make it into that but only for me specifically

1317239481959960581 2020-10-17 07:02:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @moonchick67 @lvhothead2483 @Acyn or he could've just actually gotten it and spread it around for real? it's in line with his behavior and fits with occam's razor since it's much simpler than claiming he faked all of it.
1317239260005732352 2020-10-17 07:01:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lvhothead2483 @Acyn what benefit to faking covid could he possibly achieve? i get the impulse to question the narrative that gets spread around but him actually getting it is just a simpler explanation.

1317229820904935426 2020-10-17 06:23:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Vicky_ACAB trying to understand this perspective but idk if I get what the fundamental issues at play are yet. is there a way to have something like an art museum that lets us appreciate creative works in a similar context without the baggage of stigmatizing stuff that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal art?‚Äù
1317221711109103619 2020-10-17 05:51:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy I just don‚Äôt understand how anyone could look at the current crop of weirdos and go ‚Äúyeah those are the people I want in charge of the government‚Äù lmao
1317221476110651394 2020-10-17 05:50:47 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @wertoxy ok but what‚Äôs really funny in the infographics for a hypothetical multiparty system is how the fascists are always called stuff like ‚ÄúPatriotic Biblical Family Party‚Äù and that kind of reactionary shit.

1317193560249274368 2020-10-17 03:59:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Mattathias17 @NSOOD6 @WorldBankSAsia yes, but they do it under the guise of benevolent philanthropy, as with the original tweet here, when in reality their impositions don't improve life for the people living in those nations and only serve to entrap them in a mode of production that's harmful to local economies.
1317179705930489856 2020-10-17 03:04:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Mattathias17 @NSOOD6 @WorldBankSAsia saying "oh well technically the terms and conditions don't SAY the loans are exploitative even though the overall system of giving them is" is just pedantry. disobeying the economic demands of the organizations that operate this system is not without consequences, obviously.
1317177871325106177 2020-10-17 02:57:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Mattathias17 @NSOOD6 @WorldBankSAsia the economic pressure these organizations bring to bear behind these loans still exists even if the loans themselves are not specifically predatory. the states being loaned to are effectively forced to follow the diktats of the world bank and IMF in order to avoid defaulting.

1317174491362054147 2020-10-17 02:44:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AvatarAnansi the issue is that focusing on 1 thing so heavily leads to a loss of sight of our bigger goal. although it can rein in some of the most egregious reactionary politicians, voting alone isn't going to fix the systemic inequities created by capitalism, regardless of the # of parties.
1317172862336335873 2020-10-17 02:37:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Mattathias17 @NSOOD6 @WorldBankSAsia just because they're not chained to the global system of peripheral countries being exploited for the economic benefit of the imperial core doesn't mean they're suffering, mattathias.

1317170449625894917 2020-10-17 02:28:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> some people on here who call themselves leftists have yet to realize that the main problem with our political system in the u.s. is that it‚Äôs fundamentally capitalist and not just that it‚Äôs controlled by two major parties.

1317048007112708098 2020-10-16 18:21:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RedCharlotte_ @Zarryv2 @SocDoneLeft there's no empirical way to measure "hope" as anything more than a subjective emotion, let alone making blanket statements like what you're trying to claim. this is just you masking your personal opinion as fact because you're unable to accept other people's observations.

1317004015087935491 2020-10-16 15:26:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BlackRadAnarcho Also, the left in the United States will need to reckon with a post-Trump world sooner or later anyway, so I don't see the merit in expecting our successes to hinge on one man being in power.
1317003710669770753 2020-10-16 15:25:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BlackRadAnarcho I can see how that view would be appealing, but the collapse of U.S. hegemony is a fantasy at this point, and if the government did collapse somehow in the near future, the alternative would unquestionably be far worse.
1317002790045188096 2020-10-16 15:21:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BlackRadAnarcho @dlmeech92 IMO there will be people who try to replicate trump's success regardless of who wins this election. More importantly, the QAnon movement is poised to go beyond his brand of bombastic reactionary corruption into full-blown Christofascism, so I don't think it's possible to predict.

1316469346634530816 2020-10-15 04:02:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ryangrim assuming the story is false, this is still a bad idea because it creates the streisand effect of people who previously had no idea it existed seeking it out.
1316431658564890624 2020-10-15 01:32:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore i agreed with the initial anti-pelosi take on this issue...before *i* did my research and realized it had no real analytical basis. others on the left have come to the same conclusion.
1316431398857834496 2020-10-15 01:31:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore they've already tried to get a relief bill passed through the senate multiple times and it's consistently been rejected. it's already well-proven that mcconnell has no interest in a deal. anyone who's been following this knows that this is the case and has been for some time.

1316417550276853761 2020-10-15 00:36:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias And you‚Äôre rejecting that by making a competing claim that the left has different specific beliefs and responses here. If you want to convince me you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôll have to at least provide some evidence instead of just dismissing what I‚Äôve seen and experienced.

1316416595967782912 2020-10-15 00:32:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias You haven‚Äôt produced any specific examples either, so I don‚Äôt see how this criticism is relevant here. Fact is, we‚Äôre both operating off our subjective perspectives.
1316415673233440768 2020-10-15 00:28:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias I literally never said I think she‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing her best,‚Äù that‚Äôs a weird assumption. I just think it‚Äôs stupid when the left‚Äôs bubble is full of these contrarian takes and everyone is expected to discard actual analysis of specific circumstances in favor of blanket denunciations.

I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the effort. This sounds argumentative but I don‚Äôt intend to sound dismissive; it‚Äôs seriously just how I feel.

So this is more of a focused discussion than just ‚Äúnobody in the left is smart or pragmatic lol‚Äù
1316408985671606272 2020-10-15 00:02:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias I haven‚Äôt got any idea what the specific political calculus is in this case, but i saw people complain that they‚Äôre ‚Äúplaying politics‚Äù to get Biden elected and it‚Äôs like...good? Isn‚Äôt that what you were saying they weren‚Äôt doing *enough* of?
1316408641751310336 2020-10-15 00:00:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias The hypocrisy in this case is that people were heavily critical of Pelosi accepting all the corporate bullshit in the first stimulus bill but now they‚Äôre suddenly pro-giving companies whatever the hell they want as long as they get *something* passed.
1316407431480705026 2020-10-14 23:56:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias I‚Äôm not giving her the benefit of the doubt here, I think her response in the interview was ridiculous. But it‚Äôs annoying when so many people on the left discard all analysis just so they can be contrarians and rag on their least favorite politicians even when it‚Äôs incoherent.
1316406262586802178 2020-10-14 23:51:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias Lives have already been sacrificed because the republicans are unwilling to negotiate, as they have been for months. The $1.8 trillion is already slashed from what was originally asked for. Obviously Dems aren‚Äôt innocent but it‚Äôs pretty obvious which group is most instrangient.
1316405714898821120 2020-10-14 23:49:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias I don‚Äôt have faith in pelosi; as I said, it‚Äôs probably got something to do with the closeness to the election. But it‚Äôs ridiculously binary thinking to paint her as a villain who‚Äôs intentionally trying to screw people out of aid as some on here apparently think.
1316405366092189699 2020-10-14 23:47:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Powerful_Mousse we need a 28th amendment
1316404779690717185 2020-10-14 23:45:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias Then that‚Äôs a break with their anti-compromise position, and I can understand why they think that but it‚Äôs really a question of what‚Äôs more harmful in the long run. The republicans aren‚Äôt negotiating in good faith so it‚Äôs hardly a given they‚Äôd actually let this pass anyway.
1316403967518224385 2020-10-14 23:42:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias Also the bill in question includes a provision that corporations get to take no responsibility for safety during the pandemic which is just not good no matter how you slice it.
1316403640438083585 2020-10-14 23:41:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MidwestDeplore @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias It‚Äôs just weird that people on the left have complained for so long that the Dems aren‚Äôt really trying but now they‚Äôre mad that they actually are for once. Also some people have said that it‚Äôs better for it to be a strong win so trump can‚Äôt try to contest the results.
1316400383783297024 2020-10-14 23:28:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CarlBeijer @mattyglesias the political circumstances in this case include whether passing a stimulus bill now or not would help biden win, which is dumb but ultimately good if it shows they're finally trying to improve his chances for once? idk

1316399392274952192 2020-10-14 23:24:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @WhackNicholson she could've just said "negotiations are ongoing" and politely and firmly ended the interview in a strong position, but instead she had to go on that fucking ego trip of a rant because even the *implication* of criticism from the left pisses her off.
1316398733853155331 2020-10-14 23:21:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Cjdeck1 @WhackNicholson the house has already done this though, multiple times. they just don't give a shit.

1316391025896820737 2020-10-14 22:50:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy specifically in this case, pelosi‚Äôs motivations are probably related to getting Biden elected, as some people have pointed out as a criticism‚Äîbut haven‚Äôt they also complained that the Dems are losers who aren‚Äôt doing enough to get joe to win?
1316390584488165377 2020-10-14 22:49:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy Definitely not. At the risk of sounding like a big-brained bothsideser, I think the pro- and anti-pelosi hardliners have a problem of treating politicians like cartoon characters or villains rather than actual people just because they‚Äôre in power. it doesn‚Äôt have to be so binary.
1316388759630491648 2020-10-14 22:41:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @TheKidWithPalsy I had the same initial reaction and I think it comes down to two things: a general hatred/distrust of pelosi on left Twitter, and seeing her awful interview response. but the way it‚Äôs suddenly got some people complaining she‚Äôs NOT compromising enough is hilarious.

Mcconnell regularly refuses to properly answer questions and makes himself look like a ghoul in the process but still gets what he wants, so pelosi is a MEGA CHAD for talking over wolf blitzer and making him indignantly huff about partisanship
1316242816482320384 2020-10-14 13:01:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> also, pretty sure the whole thing where republicans want corporations to be legally absolved of responsibility for their workers‚Äô safety during the pandemic is fucking awful and needs to be stopped, so it‚Äôs a surprise the Dems are actually refusing to concede on this lmao
1316242241925591041 2020-10-14 12:59:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> honestly what‚Äôs most irritating about this is that when pelosi does something politically intelligent for once she manages to screw up the messaging and make wolf blitzer look compassionate and coherent

1316189090254069772 2020-10-14 09:28:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @hammeredsicko yes, she's coming at it from an electoral context, but i still don't see it as blaming people who can't vote. and choosing not to vote because you don't approve of any of the options still requires you to be politically aware, which is different from ignoring it outright.
1316186479081795584 2020-10-14 09:18:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @hammeredsicko she never mentions voting or voter disenfranchisement at all, which combined with the tone leads me to believe she's referring to people who just choose to ignore politics altogether because they're comfortable, not people who are unable to participate due to structural barriers.
1316173419071918080 2020-10-14 08:26:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jacob_posts they‚Äôll never come back from this

1315740802098831364 2020-10-13 03:47:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata i agree with that, but i don't think the way to go about that is to celebrate when democratic rights are taken away and mock the people who do care about that.
1315740299277336576 2020-10-13 03:45:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata cool. not sure why you think dismissing active efforts by one party to stop people from voting at all is somehow the strategy to go with for what otherwise seems like a sound course of action.
1315739228060430336 2020-10-13 03:40:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata i don't mean to be argumentative here, but what exactly do you hope to achieve by bothsidesing this issue? the primaries were dumb but this is what's happening *now*, and trying to paint it as just "dems being hysterical losers" when there's concrete evidence is just stupid.
1315738825562492929 2020-10-13 03:39:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata which argument, the argument that trump and the GOP are interfering in the polls? again, it's not like the dems don't have their own shit going on, but that doesn't change the fact that republicans are heavily invested in voter suppression as a central part of their strategy.
1315737226270179329 2020-10-13 03:32:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata and meanwhile *his* party is doing stuff like this. so yeah i'd say it's definitely something to be aware of.  https://t.co/Z8zS8MV7Bc
1315736929841885184 2020-10-13 03:31:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Malangst1 @ass_dentata oh, the dems are definitely idiots, but trump has also repeatedly refused to say whether he'd accept the results of the election if he loses, told supporters to "go into the polls and watch very carefully," complained about mail-in voting being corrupt with no evidence, etc.
1315733366113796097 2020-10-13 03:17:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ass_dentata i mean he's definitely said some pretty blatant shit in the past so i don't think it's an unwarranted criticism

1315723057965793282 2020-10-13 02:36:36 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if you're gonna make anti-harm reduction arguments maybe don't use analogies that trivialize actual people's medical conditions (and as a result don't even make sense, because who in their right mind wouldn't want those extra three years?)

1314998885316808705 2020-10-11 02:39:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @theskyvvitch like there‚Äôs a very real connection between the idea that ‚Äúwomen are harmless little angels and all males are the devil‚Äù and the way terfs radicalize people with the whole ‚Äúmen in skirts are trying to rape us in public restrooms‚Äù thing

1314995914944249858 2020-10-11 02:27:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LVKVD the problem here is that by making such a big deal about this so-called distinction between ‚Äúlabor‚Äù and ‚Äúwork‚Äù and insisting it invalidates OP‚Äôs take, you guys aren‚Äôt actually accomplishing anything by demanding everyone cater to one small subgroup‚Äôs linguistic quirks.
1314995406909079552 2020-10-11 02:25:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LVKVD The reason most people don‚Äôt start conversations by defining all their vocabulary is because of this cool shared thing called ‚Äúlanguage.‚Äù Your internal perceptions are never gonna 100% line up with others but using the same terms helps to vastly reduce misconceptions over ideas.
1314994766191505408 2020-10-11 02:22:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HeavyMining @LttlMissRuby @BrianDeCesare @merrickdeville nah, you‚Äôre being a linguistic prescriptivist. use terms that are widely used and understood to communicate your ideas, and you can focus on explaining them rather than getting bound up in miscommunications.
1314993924893822977 2020-10-11 02:19:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LVKVD @heqetian if they‚Äôre ‚Äútwo completely separate things‚Äù then why do most people view them as synonyms? it‚Äôs just objectively inefficient to spend so much time trying to prescriptively change how the vast majority of people use language than to simply describe things first and go from there.

Just because it isn't as socially acceptable to have gays now &amp; there are new markets for rainbow merch doesn't mean they actually care about us.

Since abortion is healthcare, why doesn't that apply here?
1314805972905402368 2020-10-10 13:52:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RogerAramayo2 @GreenNewDealer @insidioussamg @edoswald Uh, except the federally guaranteed right to marriage? And it's not like they'd stop there either, Poland's been having a fun time making "LGBT-free zones" and targeting activists. Hell, 1920s Berlin was one of the most sexually progressive places in the world before, y'know.

These two statements aren't contradictory.

1314505343498620928 2020-10-09 17:57:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RogerAramayo2 @GreenNewDealer my point is that their "program" is a failure and any effort on my part to aid it would be wasted. i'd at least respect them if they were a pipeline to further radicalization but if anything they seem to be the reverse: a sinkhole for leftists that attracts no additional support.

1314494682135756800 2020-10-09 17:15:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RogerAramayo2 @GreenNewDealer i'd say "wanting a party that can actually win" is a pretty good value too.

1314306456536129540 2020-10-09 04:47:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades just a reskinned thought current of the whole "women are pure, men are trash" subculture that effectively just reinforces right-wing essentialist framing while being aesthetically opposed to it

1314301672907255810 2020-10-09 04:28:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lukebermuda @NoTyAnWi the point is to build bridges with their rank-and-file supporters so that principled criticism of their leaders‚Äô actions has actual credibility to them instead of appearing as the deranged ramblings of embittered losers with no political influence.
1314300965974138880 2020-10-09 04:25:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lukebermuda @NoTyAnWi she‚Äôs more of one than most of her party, and as far as the current political situation goes, she‚Äôs in the strongest position to actually enact those reforms, limited though they may be.
1314300652529557529 2020-10-09 04:24:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @culturecnstruct @TinoBell @deadstuy @NoTyAnWi the rank and file of their reformist wing can and should be included in a popular front and radicalized further rather than being alienated by bitter ultra-leftists.
1314300392499486720 2020-10-09 04:23:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @deadstuy @NoTyAnWi portraying them in a positive light is a step up from the demonization they‚Äôve received in US propaganda until now. People will connect the dots on their own once they see the default narrative is bullshit.
1314299971299094528 2020-10-09 04:21:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lukebermuda @NoTyAnWi failing to build a pipeline to revolutionary groups by alienating reformists isn‚Äôt exactly the pinnacle of success either, sectarian.

1314299182304370689 2020-10-09 04:18:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @lo_lifer @edillades @NoTyAnWi most people still think the BPP was a bunch of crazy terrorists because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been indoctrinated to believe. I‚Äôd rather have an incomplete yet positive portrayal of them than a totally negative one which treats all mention of them as insanity.

1314296072265699330 2020-10-09 04:06:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MarxismTonight They think that anything short of screaming how revolutionary the black panthers were over the rooftops is ‚Äúlying‚Äù and an unacceptable way to radicalize people. Not that they offered a solution of their own, of course.
1314293527547912192 2020-10-09 03:56:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> It‚Äôs cliche to complain about how ‚Äúthis is why the left won‚Äôt win‚Äù but these idiots are just pissed that reformists are getting more clout than them while they bicker in their splintered little cadres about the best way to terrorize DSA meetings.

1314286574654361602 2020-10-09 03:28:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist personally i don't see any value in this dogmatic, sectarian approach, but you do you.
1314286283603300353 2020-10-09 03:27:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist @ComradesAll @nicopildora the power of the revolutionary left is at an absolute nadir in this country. right now, the most credible threat to the establishment is mounted by reformists, who can form part of the pipeline to revolutionary groups if we remain clear about our politics while not attacking them
1314140653341880320 2020-10-08 17:48:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> was looking at this to get background context for this article about problems faced in leftist parties and orgs, which is a bit of a dense read but worth checking out imo:  https://t.co/m20Wwf4Ggq

1314121124331094017 2020-10-08 16:31:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist are you at least willing to acknowledge that some of what you call "lies" are more or less egregious/blatant than others, or is this a purely binary interpretation?
1314118762417840129 2020-10-08 16:21:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Mausergirl1910 @Solidarity_Star sucks, do you have a swing shift or something?
1314118256324751364 2020-10-08 16:19:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @marieposting why is it that the right-wing extremists most vocally opposed to "degeneracy" are always freaks of the vilest order behind closed doors
1314117419292676096 2020-10-08 16:16:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist this seems like less of a point of contention related to ideology and more one related to discourse and epistemology in general.
1314117116711366656 2020-10-08 16:15:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist really? so you don't think there's any continuum between levels like, say, "this is completely and intentionally made up," and "this doesn't include the full context but isn't totally false?"
1314115991564095490 2020-10-08 16:10:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist @Alanhahnsolo yeah, but there's no way to find out if you don't try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1314107611038572544 2020-10-08 15:37:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist @Alanhahnsolo so maybe try to convince individuals with those beliefs to move further left instead of just writing them off as the eternal enemy with no chance of salvation?

1314106284828958721 2020-10-08 15:32:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist I had plenty of other shit to say about your argument, but please, feel free to pretend my only criticism was of your weird graphic design if it makes you feel better.
1314106070323941376 2020-10-08 15:31:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist when I say that, I‚Äôm referring to people like this to whom the idea that you have to actually win people over with your ideas is somehow anathema. whether you want to acknowledge it or not, it‚Äôs an actual problem that‚Äôs making the left shoot itself in the foot.  https://t.co/r1GZrGX1C7
1314105259250286592 2020-10-08 15:28:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist Actually yes, that‚Äôs exactly right. Everyone has to start somewhere. If you just dump it on people all at once you‚Äôre not gonna get too far outside of the mega-skeptics. Expose the most blatant lies and they‚Äôll become hooked and keep going from there.
1314104725772685313 2020-10-08 15:25:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist Also she never actively said ‚Äúthe black panthers weren‚Äôt a revolutionary organization,‚Äù so I think it‚Äôs a stretch to even call this an actual lie.
1314104399749361664 2020-10-08 15:24:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist sure, but that‚Äôs just not gonna accomplish much outside of your echo chamber of people who already agree, or are at least aware of the u.s. gov‚Äôt‚Äôs attacks on the BPP. you can complain about ‚Äúlies‚Äù all you want but if it gets more people on the right path then I‚Äôm all for it.
1314100802705915904 2020-10-08 15:10:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @astarkpatronus @LisaForMaine that‚Äôs not how ranked-choice voting works.
1314089869786963968 2020-10-08 14:26:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist no, i don't think she's unaware of their ideology, i just don't believe her decision to withhold that here is a bad thing. if it shows people that groups they've been taught to think of as bogeymen actually did good things, it'll help increase skepticism in the default narrative.
1314087989648265216 2020-10-08 14:19:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist @Alanhahnsolo i understand that you feel upset about a mainstream u.s. politician talking about a group with such high importance in the struggle against racism and capitalism, but i don't think that it's destructive to mention them in a positive light even though it's light on the details.
1314086440884752389 2020-10-08 14:13:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist omitting that info isn't the same thing as actively claiming they *weren't* revolutionaries. and the fact remains that shit like that turns most people off because of how effective anti-communist propaganda has been.
1314085687625428992 2020-10-08 14:10:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist except the narrative surrounding the black panthers has *already* been manipulated to make them out to be a bunch of lunatics who didn't help their local communities because they weren't perfectly docile in their activism. portraying them in any positive light is a step forward.
1314085033192423424 2020-10-08 14:07:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist just because she called it "mutual aid" instead of a "survival program" (semantics) and didn't mention their revolutionary tendencies doesn't mean she's actively trying to lie about what they were like. as i said, their ideology isn't immediately palatable to a lot of people.
1314081786712989696 2020-10-08 13:54:47 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Alanhahnsolo @yungblackmaoist what about this is "opportunistic," and how is it being co-opted when all she's doing is name-dropping it?
1314081545167294465 2020-10-08 13:53:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nogoodchuck @err0rist2 i never claimed she was a true socialist, but you said she's an "opportunist," which i don't think is reflected by the work she's done.
1314067353362141185 2020-10-08 12:57:25 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nogoodchuck @err0rist2 she's organized with mutual aid groups in her district and built coalitions, but apparently since she's not up in everyone's face with the hammer and sickle none of that matters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1314066651768381440 2020-10-08 12:54:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yungblackmaoist most people are just not ready to be told the entire narrative is a lie all at once. if you gradually chip away at ideas like "the black panthers were a bunch of crazy terrorists" and show how that's not the case, then the cracks in u.s. propaganda become more and more apparent.

1314041898118643713 2020-10-08 11:16:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @beepb00ptran and yeah I had the same thought with the whole co-opting/radicalization issue.

1313702265174228993 2020-10-07 12:46:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> "oh i see they actually kept the old anarchism sub, that's nice--wait"  https://t.co/C7iEZJ3o7B
1313701826043219978 2020-10-07 12:44:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> i knew there were a lot of big-brained admins with delusions of grandeur from r/communism back then but apparently they just decided to fully lean into the aesthetic sometime after i got tired of being there  https://t.co/qti4H9YajB
1313701335632674816 2020-10-07 12:43:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> so i felt like checking back on this old reddit knockoff for leftists called "lemmy" i'd used for a minute back in 2019, just out of curiosity, and i get to the front page and see this:  https://t.co/TVvW0rKaiz
1313699300917088256 2020-10-07 12:34:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LicensedT0Ill lemme suck your blunt while you roll us a dick

1313649761384386561 2020-10-07 09:18:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @dontclareenough your original tweet was good but this is just dumb sorry
1313647741512364033 2020-10-07 09:10:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> and not in the "oh well she's still propping up the u.s. government" sense but the "omg what a sellout lib freak" sense
1313647550877126660 2020-10-07 09:09:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the venn diagram between electoral leftists who trash aoc and tulsi stans is a circle
1313647283318255621 2020-10-07 09:08:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @iwishiwasurgurl @AOC @TulsiGabbard &gt; implying tulsi deserves protection when she's a right-winger herself
1313647163180822531 2020-10-07 09:07:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cameron8digi @IlhanMN @AOC @TulsiGabbard why are you people the way that you are
1313646838818451457 2020-10-07 09:06:27 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MopeyGay the inherent homoeroticism of shaping the smooth, soft clay within your fingers
1313646221114912769 2020-10-07 09:04:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Progressive_RN @Adapa69 @scaryfoxx him telling trump to shut up honestly earned him points in my eyes lol
1313645646323363840 2020-10-07 09:01:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @LackingSaint "tik tok" made me the homosexual i am today
1313645520049639424 2020-10-07 09:01:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this is not only hornyposting but also blatant plagiarism
1313645406165893122 2020-10-07 09:00:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> juggling balls in my mouth, call that a deepthroat circus
1313645073167515650 2020-10-07 08:59:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> it's truly disheartening to see my comrades on the left divided in bitter squabbling between the anarcho-bidenists and the bloombergian maoists
1313643946975911937 2020-10-07 08:54:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Powerful_Mousse i'm sorry but she looks like the kind of person who'd accost you in the parking lot of dollar tree asking for cigarette money  https://t.co/jr3OuIqjhj
1313643325266759680 2020-10-07 08:52:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ewatomiabara just dm'ed you
1313643168160780288 2020-10-07 08:51:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> aaron burr was killed by the cia for oil
1313642792690880513 2020-10-07 08:50:22 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Powerful_Mousse that implies that people (me) would be afraid instead of overjoyed
1313642607059361792 2020-10-07 08:49:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @USSRTakes ok but how is this a "bad ussr take" though
1313642081085280261 2020-10-07 08:47:33 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Powerful_Mousse neither do most anarchists so you're basically one already
1313640704783069184 2020-10-07 08:42:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @AmbJohnBoIton why is the kid on his left wearing a giant condom on his head
1313640164644851716 2020-10-07 08:39:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @iti_pounamu @gobloid3 "do you think we should redistribute wealth under socialism?"

1313618593175789569 2020-10-07 07:14:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @JLangWood @MollyJongFast nah they really are just that stupid lol
1313617843842318336 2020-10-07 07:11:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HoratioSkald @staticbluebat the only acceptable use case for reddit is the niche communities and even then you have to deal with all the obnoxious memes and in-jokes constantly
1313616834734759936 2020-10-07 07:07:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BernerSanders @DavidWarschauer @jessxjessNW that implies they're actually using "logic" to arrive at their beliefs in the first place. call me a cynic, but i don't think that's the case at all. it's the same reason many "pro-lifers" don't support policies that would help babies live better lives once they're actually born.
1313614812312727554 2020-10-07 06:59:11 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @GravelInstitute don't delete

1313614030565761026 2020-10-07 06:56:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @kimpossiblefact little-known fact: you can actually get a break from twitter for as long as you want, simply by doing something called "logging off"
1313613564763148295 2020-10-07 06:54:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> that's so weird, i can't imagine why that would be
1313613388447207435 2020-10-07 06:53:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Sticky_Llama really normal people on here
1313613127758606337 2020-10-07 06:52:30 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BernerSanders @DavidWarschauer @jessxjessNW that's what the original tweet was about so that's what i was addressing. if convincing conservatives is important, i don't think it'll help to validate their "all lives matter" schtick any more than it already has been. it's contextually limited to police reform, unfortunately.
1313612525460762625 2020-10-07 06:50:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @FMDKM_Kid2020 @RealKaylaJames people conflate anti-establishment rhetoric with a genuine commitment to leftism all too often, unfortunately.
1313611852866297857 2020-10-07 06:47:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BernerSanders @DavidWarschauer @jessxjessNW saying single-payer healthcare is good because "everyone's life has value" and stuff like that is a good rhetorical framing, but you can't just "reclaim" all lives matter when it's being used by right-wingers and has that association much more strongly than what you're doing.
1313611405132791808 2020-10-07 06:45:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nataliereed84 pretty sure it's just the owner of 8chan so it's definitely for the grift
1313611253399670784 2020-10-07 06:45:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @BernerSanders @DavidWarschauer @jessxjessNW the values of people who popularized the phrase "all lives matter" aren't actually consistent with what they're saying; it's just a dishonest framing of BLM so they have an excuse to dismiss their concerns.
1313599524808658944 2020-10-07 05:58:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Decay1312 ok i was just wondering cause somebody retweeted something from her account and a lot of people were replying and addressing her as aimee for no clear reason lmao
1313598827811741697 2020-10-07 05:55:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> is @/shoe_sticky aimee terese's alt or something, i'm so confused lol

1313557068448751616 2020-10-07 03:09:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EllieJellie__ @KASSIE0PEIA same reason the op thinks these criticisms are dumb  https://t.co/LOFuFtWiFO

1313555484675375105 2020-10-07 03:03:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @loserdish @KASSIE0PEIA they're worried about the wrong kind of guts getting rearranged
1313555224561360897 2020-10-07 03:02:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @EllieJellie__ @KASSIE0PEIA so just watch a different movie?

1313551877678796807 2020-10-07 02:49:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> trump has done more to damage the power of the u.s. military than all the twitter tankies calling working-class former soldiers "imperialist mass-murderers" combined
1313551281714270213 2020-10-07 02:46:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MarxismTonight they're so stupid lmao
1313550945431834627 2020-10-07 02:45:24 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CancelXero @axelsolis_ @GoodhauerU obviously change is needed, but i just don't see how y'all can suddenly achieve what your party has spent decades impotently aspiring to without even attempting to challenge the underlying systems which keep the hated duopoly in place. fiery rhetoric doesn't fix that.
1313549273611501569 2020-10-07 02:38:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CancelXero @axelsolis_ @GoodhauerU yes, and that's what we need more of right now in order for left-wing alternatives to the current parties to succeed. the framework in place in the vast majority of the united states is extremely unfavorable to third parties' success (to say nothing of presidential elections).
1313548313229221888 2020-10-07 02:34:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> can't believe people are getting in fights over whether the original egyptians were arab or black; the answer is obvious--they were irish
1313547041134571521 2020-10-07 02:29:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CancelXero @axelsolis_ @GoodhauerU if the greens and other 3rd parties like the libertarians worked together as a coalition to reform u.s. state voting systems so that more than 2 parties can play significant roles, that'd be much more effective than just bashing their heads against the wall of FPTP repeatedly.

1313515342807826432 2020-10-07 00:23:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nataliereed84 yeah like there's gotta be a name for when you hear more about something from other people complaining about how much it's talked about than actually hearing firsthand discussion of it lol
1313514013721088001 2020-10-07 00:18:39 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @nataliereed84 i have heard literally no one talk about infinite jest in any context outside of twitter

1313409453010702338 2020-10-06 17:23:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> if trump actually does the not-alive from this I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs ready for what twitter will be like. I‚Äôm picturing something like the garden of eden but with lots more cocaine involved

1313334887835987968 2020-10-06 12:26:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @protoneutype yeah the way this stuff is presented (by young teens new to the queer community with no real-life understanding of how the community has approached these issues in the past) have seriously undermined it.
1313333615279865856 2020-10-06 12:21:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @CancelXero @axelsolis_ @GoodhauerU if the success of the green party lies in convincing the vast bloc of nonvoters in the u.s., then maybe your time would be better spent trying to convert them into supporters than arguing with random people on twitter who are already politically active?
1313332863039868928 2020-10-06 12:18:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @mikevictor2020 @jross252 @GoodhauerU there were big political realignments in play that allowed a vacuum for the gop's rise to power, though. namely, the collapse of the old east coast-frontier divide in favor of north-south regionalism based on slavery. the whigs didn't just collapse because they felt like it.

1313331305535418369 2020-10-06 12:12:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> honestly just reading through regular interactions on here has made it obvious that a shit-ton of people just live in an alternate reality dictated by their own confirmation biases and refuse to allow people with other perspectives to change their minds in the slightest.

1313329112992358400 2020-10-06 12:03:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> i simply cannot conceptualize the sort of person who would actually dedicate this level of thought towards a topic which is completely irrelevant to actual people's lives outside of internet discourse

1311864769167659009 2020-10-02 11:05:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Are you really gonna keep going with this bullshit? Do you actually believe the moronic crap they spew out on a daily basis? Because if so that‚Äôs pretty fucking hilarious. Call me an ant-fucker or whatever, but if you‚Äôre afraid to state your actual beliefs that ain‚Äôt on me!
1311864112985575425 2020-10-02 11:02:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Who mentioned the proud boys? Sure wasn‚Äôt me. What‚Äôs their relevance to the argument?
1311863991342333953 2020-10-02 11:02:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol And as the old adage goes, I can ‚Äúwalk and chew gum at the same time,‚Äù so knowing the dishonest rhetoric of mainstream media and calling out the blatant conspiratorial lies of project veritas aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive as you seem to think they are!
1311863275391516673 2020-10-02 10:59:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol The reason I‚Äôm focused on discussing the proud boys is because you‚Äôre being so slippery in giving your actual opinion of them. If you gave me a straight answer it really would‚Äôve been much simpler. But here we are, talking in circles around each other.
1311862975238737920 2020-10-02 10:58:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre more significant than a ‚Äúminnow‚Äù when right-wingers constantly spread their propaganda, which has inspired terrorist attacks against planned parenthood clinics and now is attempting to legitimize voter suppression. And regardless, tulsi has amplified their reach.

1311861545140457473 2020-10-02 10:52:20 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol When did I say they were ‚Äúmore evil and capable than Hitler?‚Äù And for that matter, just because they‚Äôre far-right doesn‚Äôt mean their rhetoric isn‚Äôt par for the course for right-wingers, so I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù either. They‚Äôre just fucking liars. Why defend them?

1311858755844349952 2020-10-02 10:41:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Do you support them and their actions or don‚Äôt you? I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre trying to weasel your way out of giving a straight answer. These are the same clowns who tried to claim planned parenthood was killing babies and harvesting their organs, so idk what the appeal is.
1311858444283138048 2020-10-02 10:40:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Ok, Biden sucks too, not arguing that one. But I‚Äôve gotta ask, and this is getting pretty long-winded, but what‚Äôs your stance on project veritas? Do you consider them honest or what?   https://t.co/trWvP0sNwn
1311857940173856770 2020-10-02 10:38:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol So are you just using this argument as a way to dismiss project veritas‚Äô blatant disinformation as unimportant to your assessment of tulsi‚Äôs political aims, or do you actually think they‚Äôre a credible organization?
1311857456578990080 2020-10-02 10:36:05 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Then what was the point in posting that article? Any comment at all on project veritas and why you‚Äôre of the belief that her praise of them isn‚Äôt harmful?    https://t.co/trWvP0sNwn
1311856810547085312 2020-10-02 10:33:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Like, what benefit do you see in tulsi working with a disinformation outfit like this? if anything, bringing them into it hurts her credibility.   https://t.co/trWvP0sNwn
1311855949217439745 2020-10-02 10:30:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Pelosi sucks but it‚Äôs disingenuous as fuck to pretend that‚Äôs the same kind of threat project veritas‚Äô propaganda represents. Are you a fan of them too or what exactly is your point here?
1311855686016552965 2020-10-02 10:29:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol Sure, so clearly there was no need to actively promote project veritas as a legitimate organization if she was already working on something? If she‚Äôs really this political mastermind I find it hard to believe she‚Äôs not doing so consciously.
1311855463483486214 2020-10-02 10:28:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol oh, is there some hidden code she‚Äôs been transmitting that negates how she literally did exactly that?
1311855104736321537 2020-10-02 10:26:44 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol feel free to point me in the direction of her cooperation with far-right organizations and legitimization of their rhetoric ü•±
1311854718365380609 2020-10-02 10:25:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol if I wanted to be seen as a legitimate progressive politician, I would simply not work with far-right propaganda organizations like PragerU and project veritas. seems pretty easy but who knows the Byzantine calculations of her mind at this point lmao
1311854067409453056 2020-10-02 10:22:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol so in other words, she ‚Äúplays a progressive for the cameras but has no guiding moral light other than her own ambitions.‚Äù totally tracks!
1311851617319292930 2020-10-02 10:12:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RMpodol this makes no sense whatsoever outside of the alternate reality bubble that is Twitter
1311851420325478400 2020-10-02 10:12:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @leucinedreams @RMpodol bruh you literally still support tulsi and you‚Äôre out here saying this? glass freaking houses lol
1311850786897514496 2020-10-02 10:09:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MopeyGay If I had to guess it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs been hypnotized by the illuminati. Idk though

1311804239669325824 2020-10-02 07:04:37 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @diannaeanderson never heard that particular prayer before but ok
1311803596414029826 2020-10-02 07:02:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @wertoxy Yup, my parents are both from communities like that, and it‚Äôs been happening for years now. The younger generations are leaving and the economies have already atrophied massively compared to their heyday decades ago. Would‚Äôve loved to have seen those places in their prime.
1311802373405396994 2020-10-02 06:57:12 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @jakebrodes @len0killer also the whole thing about wanting to ‚Äúnormalize men showing their emotions‚Äù is based on the assumption that if someone isn‚Äôt batting their eyelashes and weeping glistening tears, they must be Repressed and just need to Open Up, which is just weird tbh.
1311798863628468224 2020-10-02 06:43:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> Cultural identity has become a cheap, commodified sideshow and a means to pit the 99% against itself along racial lines, rather than a field of community-building and organization.
1311798086012895232 2020-10-02 06:40:10 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> When examining ‚Äúidentity politics,‚Äù remember that despite the appearance of patriotism and ‚Äúdiversity day,‚Äù the interests of capital and the state benefit from people having no more identity than that of a loyal, productive subject. If it doesn‚Äôt fit that mold, it‚Äôs destroyed.
1311795275942580224 2020-10-02 06:29:00 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> This was, of course, quite convenient for the WASP engineers of racial eugenics. No longer did they have to enforce the status quo upon nonwhite people by themselves; now they could rely on the de-cultured non-Anglo ‚Äúwhite‚Äù immigrants who saw themselves as being on the same side.
1311793701522485255 2020-10-02 06:22:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> By the end of the war, ‚ÄúAmericanization‚Äù policies had run their course and successfully erased entire generations‚Äô identities, all because their community‚Äôs existence posed a threat to the state‚Äôs geopolitical interests. They instead became loyal members of the social hierarchy.
1311792132714377217 2020-10-02 06:16:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> During WWI, German immigrants in particular were viewed with paranoid hostility‚Äîtheir communities policed, their fathers and sons pressed into military service, their language suppressed, even their names considered a hallmark of the ‚Äúhun.‚Äù Wilson would‚Äôve loved the Patriot Act.
1311790822774517762 2020-10-02 06:11:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> There‚Äôs a long &amp; storied tradition of immigrant communities organizing mutual aid societies to help newcomers get on their feet and not just thrown into an unfamiliar system which sees them as expendable. These groups had to fight to be seen as anything more than foreign agents.
1311788495401295872 2020-10-02 06:02:03 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> Neither of which, obviously, has anything to do with their actual ancestral heritage in almost all cases; it‚Äôs just another chimera to give them a sense of strength through their identity. But identity isn‚Äôt really about projecting brute strength, it‚Äôs about having a community.
1311787929237417985 2020-10-02 05:59:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> The white nationalists, in typically hamfisted fashion, have responded to this by either a) glorifying this artificial culture even further (eg. ‚Äúreturn to tradition‚Äù and parts of the ‚Äútradwife‚Äù subculture) or b) adopting a thin veneer of aesthetics from Nordic &amp; Roman societies.
1311785925500960769 2020-10-02 05:51:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> The phrase ‚Äúa nation of immigrants‚Äù should thus evoke criticism rather than praise, not because people shouldn‚Äôt be free to go where they please, but because these immigrants are incentivized to obliterate their own heritage and assimilate into Anglo-dominated society.
1311785218454495234 2020-10-02 05:49:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> If you are denied any form of identity beyond class status and socially constructed race, the barriers for cooperation of members of the upper classes to repress laborers and distract them with racial tensions as a cheap substitute for actually understanding what‚Äôs wrong.
1311784417145376771 2020-10-02 05:45:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> And the issue is compounded when you consider how this treatment was stricter for Irish, Germans, Italians, Slavs, and other groups which were considered inferior by ‚ÄúAnglo-Saxon‚Äù society. It‚Äôs obviously not comparable to actual racism but it‚Äôs definitely been a serious issue.
1311783735315107844 2020-10-02 05:43:08 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> Maybe this is just me projecting my own feelings and experiences onto society as a whole, but there‚Äôs something insidious about a nation which encourages you to abandon your family‚Äôs cultural ties and heritage to become another settler in the capitalist ‚Äúmelting pot.‚Äù
1311783273354461185 2020-10-02 05:41:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this may seem like apologia for white supremacists if not outright ‚Äúblood and soil‚Äù rhetoric,  ...but it‚Äôs kinda fucked up how ‚Äúwhite‚Äù people in America have basically given up actual culture from our European ancestors in favor of meaningless consumerism steeped in 50s suburbia.

1311777213788938245 2020-10-02 05:17:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MorganMMcIntyre @BenAybar and even then the similarity mostly just boils down to discontent with the current system, which isn‚Äôt exactly an uncommon view.

1308195201467461632 2020-09-22 08:03:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades It was based off a short story called ‚ÄúWang‚Äôs Carpets‚Äù so you could try to find that and see if the concepts it includes are interesting to you before going for the whole thing.
1308194978129215488 2020-09-22 08:02:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades And as far as Diaspora goes, as I mentioned a lot of the hard science and math went over my head, but it was interesting how it showed how a posthuman society would be organized, how people would interact, what goes they would pursue, stuff like that.
1308192876187222016 2020-09-22 07:54:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades Yeah I‚Äôd say that was the case for me too since I first read it as a high schooler as well (though I did it on my own and not as required reading, which may have helped). I think there was a lot of monotony at first but it got spicier later with all the political and union stuff.
1308189185581481985 2020-09-22 07:39:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @cat_upgrades lol on a more serious note I think the jungle was good for helping me to examine present conditions more deeply while diaspora was a source of ideas for the far future which I hadn‚Äôt previously thought much about

1308073748688506886 2020-09-22 00:00:59 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> regardless of whether you think Bernie endorsing Biden is good or not, it‚Äôs so stupid to pretend this was some kind of sudden decision and it‚Äôs not completely in line with his political strategy. there‚Äôs no point in misdirecting your rage at something you should‚Äôve already known.

1307186377273085952 2020-09-19 13:14:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the united states has openly restricted democratic control for much of its history by limiting which groups could vote, and even outside of the legal aspect of suffrage, it's been interfered with thanks to voter suppression and misinfo campaigns, which are murkier to discern.

1307184964534968321 2020-09-19 13:09:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the "we're a republic and not a democracy because we elect representatives and don't have direct voting for everything" argument isn't accurate, that's just a difference in types of democracy. you can also have democratic monarchies, typically of the constitutional variety.

1305287379175997441 2020-09-14 07:28:56 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> how is this guy still tweeting lmao

1305285079091077120 2020-09-14 07:19:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 8. At one point when I was little, my parents renovated the basement of our house, and I decided I wanted to be an electrician because I really liked looking at the wiring diagrams. Got a Snap Circuits toy set and everything  https://t.co/fqa3pP07Cm
1305275774379982849 2020-09-14 06:42:50 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @_____tabitha coming from a Warren supporter this means...very little lmao
1305273183776509952 2020-09-14 06:32:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @filmcoeur @shafieikeyvan yeah, I can see why you wouldn‚Äôt want to date people who are on average more mature than you
1305271567178498050 2020-09-14 06:26:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 7. Toss-up between Elektra from ‚ÄúPose‚Äù and Myrtle Snow from AHS. What can I say, I have a special place in my heart for women with strong, mysterious personalities and novel fashion sense (and who could read me to complete and utter filth if they so desired).
1305261797277159432 2020-09-14 05:47:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 6. I‚Äôve never really fantasized about what my ‚Äúperfect career‚Äù would look like (aside from the obvious factors like a good salary &amp; no overbearing boss). I‚Äôm happy enough with my current life track, but I‚Äôm not focused on being the ‚Äúbest programmer‚Äù or becoming a CEO or anything.
1305259673235357701 2020-09-14 05:38:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 5. This was a tough one! I always try to find ways in which to be the best version of myself and improve as a person over time, whether that‚Äôs social competence, physical wellness, etc. Introspection and (usually) healthy self-evaluation is an important part of maintaining that.
1305258039453384705 2020-09-14 05:32:21 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 4. At this point I‚Äôm pretty much hoping for a relationship since I haven‚Äôt really had opportunities to do so up until the past couple years of actually being out to most people. I‚Äôm not interested in rushing it, so finding the right guy for a longterm relationship is the dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1305256216688459776 2020-09-14 05:25:07 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 3. Absolutely, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one of my biggest hurdles in social interactions. I was pretty shy and socially stunted in my early teens, and even though I got out of my shell and learned to be much more gregarious, there‚Äôs still an undercurrent of worrying what others think.
1305255174278086657 2020-09-14 05:20:58 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 2. Definitely my dad. He‚Äôs really passionate about what he does, both in his career and in raising me and my sibs (he took off several years as a stay-at-home dad so he could take us on trips to museums and nat‚Äôl parks). And even now he‚Äôs taking college classes and learning more.
1305253638860935181 2020-09-14 05:14:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> 1. I wanted a cool ancient-sounding name and decided on ‚ÄúLeonidas,‚Äù but the @ wasn‚Äôt available so I combined it with ‚Äúsolarpunk,‚Äù which is a genre similar to steampunk but with renewable energy and a more egalitarian decentralized society.

1304693098648408070 2020-09-12 16:07:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @yes_malarkey damn. i mean it was a religious school but i never got that kind of rhetoric shoved in my face to that degree :/

1304692159690485760 2020-09-12 16:03:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ACorollaries the whole moral panic surrounding it has risen to such a fever pitch that there's gotta be a qanon connection somewhere
1304691789320851456 2020-09-12 16:02:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RationalDis what an interesting development in his character arc
1304665616968802306 2020-09-12 14:18:17 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @chippledipple did he see this happen
1304662436113518592 2020-09-12 14:05:38 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> y'see, the word "terrorism" is supposed to be associated with feelings like "we are under attack and need to defend our way of life [from those scary brown people]," not shame for the many times when people who could've been your next-door neighbors killed minorities for fun.
1304661811065741312 2020-09-12 14:03:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> there are countless examples of terrorism and mass murder throughout US history, but nobody talks about them because they don't exactly make you feel like a proud american patriot, ready to enlist and kick ass in the service of empire.   https://t.co/4h6YgsdPeO
1304660642884968448 2020-09-12 13:58:31 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> interesting how the united states has a national day of mourning which makes us out to be heroic victims standing alone against the world, and nothing for the times americans committed atrocities against people in their own country. where's the "never forget rosewood" pageantry?
1304658518532927488 2020-09-12 13:50:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> case in point  https://t.co/GETU5JwlVL
1304658169759760391 2020-09-12 13:48:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the way people performatively memorialize 9/11 is pretty disturbing. there's no lesson, no uplifting message to take away from the presentation of it, just morbid fascination with brutality and death. and it's all been captured on live tv for your viewing pleasure!
1304657636353343490 2020-09-12 13:46:34 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @daveewave my headcanon is that the original plan was to only do one but then this other random guy saw it and it triggered his ocd tendencies to only have one be on fire
1304655806579838976 2020-09-12 13:39:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @boshyboo this was like years later and she was just showing us a recording, i wasn't even a year old when it actually happened
1304654874081198081 2020-09-12 13:35:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @MrTooDamnChris the what now
1304653080961716225 2020-09-12 13:28:28 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> interacting with historical records to gain greater understanding of tragic events is one thing, but it really says something about u.s. culture that so many people feel the need to inflict pain and trauma onto others to make sure they show the appropriate amount of public grief
1304652498850975744 2020-09-12 13:26:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> so are we gonna talk about how fucked up it was that my 4th grade teacher wheeled the tv cart in so she could show us footage of 9/11--including some very tasteful zoom-ins on the jumpers, because obviously every kid needs to see that
1304651277679366144 2020-09-12 13:21:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @drmistercody can he even say this??
1304649802806853632 2020-09-12 13:15:26 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SocDemNow true but that's pretty much a given at this point lol
1304649001690685441 2020-09-12 13:12:15 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @SocDemNow of all the mainstream politicians to embrace qanon she seems the most likely imo

1304645843715264532 2020-09-12 12:59:42 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @reallyhotpants first replies and already we know it's gonna be extra spicy down there  https://t.co/I8w3piHTFx
1304642912752472064 2020-09-12 12:48:04 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RidleyDM @Zemrag7 @SammyBytes @MichaelMcBrear5 @cloudymyb i wasn't criticizing you or anyone else in particular, just pointing out that people often claim the end goal of decolonization is to "deport all the white people and create an ethnostate" as a kind of both-sides maneuver to make them sound equivalent to white nationalists.
1304642092690550785 2020-09-12 12:44:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @aestheticstatue exactly, and reducing the nazis' geopolitical aspirations to simple "imperialism" to make them sound comparable to other states' goals is strikingly close to outright apologia IMO
1304641649428045824 2020-09-12 12:43:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RidleyDM @Zemrag7 @SammyBytes @MichaelMcBrear5 @cloudymyb anyone telling you that you have to leave your country of birth to be morally pure is delusional. there's a LOT of work that needs doing to bring justice to the indigenous peoples of the u.s., but creating a brown ethnostate isn't on the list. that's a right-wing strawman claim.
1304640892393992192 2020-09-12 12:40:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> there comes a point where bothsidesing stops being nuanced and starts being cringe, and this is definitely past that point
1304640109510365184 2020-09-12 12:36:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ustprinzip @SamtheObserver i think it goes beyond just being sheltered since the climate of islamophobia in the u.s. is so blatant that you'd pretty much have to actively ignore it to think it doesn't exist

1304558365989900290 2020-09-12 07:12:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @JarJarFan69 my question is why are her parents putting her in a full face of makeup for all of her videos, really not a creepy thing to do whatsoever
1304553626552143877 2020-09-12 06:53:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @aniceburrito never forget!!
1304552674944221184 2020-09-12 06:49:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @JustSayXtian not to mention that there's plenty of younger people like me who just don't remember it happening, so it's impossible to "never forget" when there's nothing TO forget, except as an abstract justification for the war on terror--which i *do* very much remember.
1304551269739237376 2020-09-12 06:43:54 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @brandon_seekins i agree, i was mostly talking about the people who decide to vote green just because they're aware of its existence as a further-left option to the dems, so it's kind of a default protest vote option without the party actually doing outreach to reach a broader base of people.
1304532173718986752 2020-09-12 05:28:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @brandon_seekins And when their strategy is basically to siphon off the dregs of the Dems‚Äô radical wing for presidential votes every 4 year‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not surprising they don‚Äôt have the local party apparatus needed to actually contest things like that.
1304531295322673159 2020-09-12 05:24:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @brandon_seekins this oversimplified explanation doesn‚Äôt take actual organization into account *at all* and implies that getting bureaucratic recognition is all that‚Äôs needed to springboard them into relevancy. Makes sense when they‚Äôre trying to appeal to people who think voting is activism

1304528541124628481 2020-09-12 05:13:35 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RiverTSM exactly, I don‚Äôt see the value in making impossible promises to people since it‚Äôll just lead to them getting frustrated and leaving you with even less support than before

1304515475787976706 2020-09-12 04:21:40 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @Marqy_Marqs yeah, that's why stuff like this is frustrating to me. in an ideal world, i'd love to see them succeed, but i keep seeing stuff like this and it's hard not to be even more pessimistic about the direction they're going.
1304514559508709379 2020-09-12 04:18:02 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ChompskyGoat they're just straight up calling it magic--no window-dressing of "strategic voting" or anything, just "if you do this we'll magically win elections and implement socialism in four years"

1303082300717047809 2020-09-08 05:26:45 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> so far 2020 has been: - the massive pandemic and geopolitical instability of 1918 - the economic crash and working-class impoverishment of 1930 - the violent social and political upheaval of 1968 so who knows what shit we're gonna see next!

1303076038780628992 2020-09-08 05:01:52 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @fan_broz @softcurrent1 @oatmilkfoam then the op should've clarified that instead of posting such a vague take
1303075119317823496 2020-09-08 04:58:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ACorollaries @og_hapsburg not to mention blaming negative responses on "white communist twitter," a very genuine and relevant criticism
1303074012185141255 2020-09-08 04:53:49 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @HoosierTweety as others have pointed out, the original statement is so broad that it can include anyone from "watched SJW debate videos in high school" to "atomwaffen member until a week ago" and other people are just superimposing their own frameworks onto it.
1303073080135299072 2020-09-08 04:50:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> this is EXACTLY how cults operate. if you're in deep enough, they keep you inside by convincing you that there's NO possibility you can ever leave and be accepted by broader society since your former enemies will still hate your guts forever. and these idiots are validating that!
1303072683219988481 2020-09-08 04:48:32 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @ACorollaries like "uhhhh leftists like fascists more than warren democrats" where the fuck did you come up with that bizarre conflation bub??

1303072285998358530 2020-09-08 04:46:57 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> the left will never win as long as its social circles are dominated by hugboxing morons who'd rather have a pure little club of performative wholesomeness than a mass movement with strategic aims and revolutionary potential. this ideology does not exist for your moral circlejerk.
1303071759151828992 2020-09-08 04:44:51 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> no one on the right ever attempts this essentializing clique bullshit, they're HAPPY to take advantage of "ex-leftists" and put them on the fucking front lines to show how much more Rational and Welcoming their ideology is. you people are so goddamn stupid holy shit

1303012850164789249 2020-09-08 00:50:46 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> and that‚Äôs not even getting into World Systems Theory, which is funny considering how much its categories (core &amp; periphery) are used by leftists! absolutely insane shit, I must analyze the analysis itself

1302869159051698177 2020-09-07 15:19:48 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> why does it seem like leftists are more vicious in our disagreements with each other on specific strategies than in fighting right-wingers?

1302708676684283904 2020-09-07 04:42:06 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @RedWorld1917 well yeah but my point is that military prowess doesn't make an ideology more or less inherently valid

1302677484136169473 2020-09-07 02:38:09 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @KULTovMONITOR yeah i was thinking that. if a non-racist character can become a symbol of racists (and it's arguably become less so due to being mainstream for years now), can't the reverse also happen?

1302661646108766214 2020-09-07 01:35:13 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> personally I think it‚Äôs a bit dramatic to act like you‚Äôre being betrayed when someone doesn‚Äôt say neoliberalism and fascism are literal carbon copies of each other but hey that‚Äôs just me

1302660805918326784 2020-09-07 01:31:53 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> people are responding to this with such hostility but what exactly is the problem with acknowledging different degrees of bad exist?

1302644400024162304 2020-09-07 00:26:41 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> @IDontEvenNooh42 I think it depends on the specific circumstance of the person/group being talked about. If their public relations depend on looking wholesome and  impartial, exposing them constantly can be helpful, but some entities thrive on notoriety and there‚Äôs only so much you can do then.

1302432155029704708 2020-09-06 10:23:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I‚Äôm not trying to act like a Rational Enlightened Contrarian or anything but personally I don‚Äôt think we need to have a single party line which applies to every single soldier, and moreover condemning individuals shouldn‚Äôt be the focus of our analysis to begin with.
1302431391037231104 2020-09-06 10:20:16 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> Half the time it seems like the debate on the left of whether soldiers should be shamed as facilitators of genocide or sympathized with as innocent members of the working class who were duped into enlisting is done with the purpose of passing moral judgement on specific people.
1302430880347160576 2020-09-06 10:18:14 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I think all the discourse about whether it‚Äôs morally good/bad to be in the military (eg. we shouldn‚Äôt like John McCain because he went to Vietnam) is kind of missing the point of the overall trends of interventionism and imperialism which can‚Äôt be reduced to individuals‚Äô choices.

1301576422767702017 2020-09-04 01:42:55 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> like, obviously those aren‚Äôt bad things to do, but it‚Äôs kinda missing the point of why ‚Äúantifa‚Äù exists as a term in the first place. there are plenty of other labels which are more specifically geared towards your beliefs, but can we have a broad antifascist coalition or not?
1301575810411884544 2020-09-04 01:40:29 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> helping educate people who don‚Äôt have a well-developed understanding of how fascism is intertwined with capitalism is one thing, but people who say ‚Äúbeing antifa requires violence against capital‚Äù or ‚Äúyou have to be on the streets to be antifa‚Äù are just being counterproductive.
1301575260190511104 2020-09-04 01:38:18 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> why are people so desperate to gatekeep antifascism now? saying it requires you to hold you an additional political stance is literally contradictory to what everyone‚Äôs been saying about antifa to convince people that it just means you oppose fascism. what a waste of messaging.

1301336362034106368 2020-09-03 09:49:01 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> I can understand being annoyed at these people for not fully examining the system, but personally when I see shit like the Kenosha shooting it sure looks like we‚Äôre gonna need all the help we can get. them being willing to call themselves ‚Äúantifa‚Äù is a step in the right direction
1301335783639523331 2020-09-03 09:46:43 +0800 <LeonSolarpunk> liberals may have some shitty ideas and a naive conception of the far right, but I see no downside in normalizing actively and publicly positioning oneself in opposition to fascism. look around at the political landscape‚Äîa LOT of people aren‚Äôt leftists.
