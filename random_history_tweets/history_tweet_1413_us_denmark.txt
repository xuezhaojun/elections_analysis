That's why in Portland or Seattle federal troops were sent to protect fed property, not overrun the city.   That's why sanctuary cities still exist: Governors can tell the Pres. to eat it.
1343536638031491073 2020-12-28 20:37:50 +0800 <us_denmark> @NightMaga I know.  I listen to @Iromg on @talkRADIO to stay in tune with the UK, and I've heard a few guests suggest lockdown tiers might be correlated with hospital incapacity more than actual disease.  Socialized medicine is ill equipped. Boris is just a guy taking orders (like Trump?).

If you can just tell me the crime, I'll go over to Schiff's office and help him impeach Trump again, win or lose.  He never had one last time. It was sad. Let's help him together!

Republicans believe you should have to right to pursue your own version of utopia by promoting freedom.  Nobodys perfect. Only conservatives accept that.

Chuck Todd? Adam Schiff? Funny you don't see much of him lately.  Trump is the most investigated president and you're left with nothing but name calling.

It's because it's impossible to provide free and equal healthcare to everyone, the only way to disperse any limited resource is through price or rationing.

1314204678918270977 2020-10-08 22:03:06 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 Anyone who disagreess with them. Like Obamacare. Like frackers per AOC. Like religious people who have pastry shops.   What don't you get? YOU are the totalitarian thugs you fear.
1314204544323088387 2020-10-08 22:02:34 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 I like the best tweets. Tweets which include dopey liberals.
1314196395411283968 2020-10-08 21:30:11 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 That's part of progressivism. If I correctly labeled you an atheist, or at least someone who denounces religion, that's fine and well.   That's diversity. You're allowed to hate your parents and their religion.  The problem is when you try to push that onto other people by law.
1314191589707743238 2020-10-08 21:11:06 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 We don't need any more laws to protect them, then, right?  Or wait... we might need a few more...  That's the beauty of progressivism. More and more laws taking more and more freedom away from the people.
1314191109573275649 2020-10-08 21:09:11 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 You use it to mean whatever you want, don't you?  That's the beauty of it for you and for totalitarians alike!  That's why Hillary glommed onto it, and why simple folks like you (let me guess, atheist?) see it as a bridge out of a constitutional system.  You KNOW what's right!
1314187938402533376 2020-10-08 20:56:35 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 Because it destroys the rights of the minority.  Consent of the governed, which comes from the declaration of independence, if you're familiar:  https://t.co/oKTQsqK7qs
1314185999044542468 2020-10-08 20:48:53 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 Because, like AOC, progressives want to declare what is right and what is wrong.   That's not how it works.   Remember the quote I shared from Herbert Croly? Read it again.   https://t.co/ehfpVjLmmF
1314185332347281408 2020-10-08 20:46:14 +0800 <us_denmark> @OriginalSMM They could have bought a cake off the shelf but the couple didn't want to do that.  They wanted the baker, and artist, to create something.  See the difference?
1314184603456933890 2020-10-08 20:43:20 +0800 <us_denmark> @jude_three The difference is that making a cake requires art.   They could have bought a cake off the shelf.  Your alcohol analogy fails because nobody in your analogy is having to create gay alcohol.

1314183365810151425 2020-10-08 20:38:25 +0800 <us_denmark> @PaulVCooper1 Why don't you want to talk about Obamacare? That's progressivism 101, the state taking over for the free market.  You can't just wish something into existence and demand the people/party out of power give up their rights.  Where does it end? Does it end with #MasterpieceCakeshop?

1313861028875325445 2020-10-07 23:17:34 +0800 <us_denmark> @MitchellWiggs @atoms4peace @AP Well we learned recently that his taxes are under audit, and we learned that he had nothing to do with Russia, but if he doesn't want to release them anyway (whether or not this is possible while under audit) why should he?  Isn't it weird there isn't a law mandating it?

How do we adhere to principles, namely those laid out by our founding documents? It's hard work, but maybe it shouldn't be.  Purple hair and tattoos are an expression of freedom, aren't they?

I suppose we start adhering to some principles at a young age. MAYBE we're told its improper to hit our brother or sister. Hopefully we're told to not poop in public. Probably we're told not to steal.

If we take the "qualified" phrase of your question out, because that's your word and doesn't appear in the statute, we're left with a subjective test.

I think that's the kind of thing you want to be true so you say it and you try to be mean about it, but deep down you don't really feel it.  It's a peer pressure thing. You don't want to be seen as going easy, so you reach for weak arguments.
