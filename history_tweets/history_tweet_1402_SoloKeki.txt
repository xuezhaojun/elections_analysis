1318557684409503747 2020-10-20 22:20:24 +0800 <SoloKeki> Canadians have obeyed strange edicts while prov. gov. blame them for a virus Fed. gov. allowed to enter &amp; spread.  Fortunately, it is not as dangerous as once feared yet politicians continue to arbitrarily choke the life out of Canadian's lives. Apparently, this angers Canadians.
