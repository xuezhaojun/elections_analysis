1343245864924553221 2020-12-28 01:22:25 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @J_Imagineering In this case though, it doesn't really add anything to characterize an entirely materialistic and worldly ideology as  religious.  Unless one is a Reddit style atheist, who considers religion to be an all-purpose slur.
1343242009738436609 2020-12-28 01:07:06 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @J_Imagineering All I did was characterize progressivism as 'secular Calvinism'. Seems a pretty basic concept, but apparently attracted some push back.  Personally, I can't stand semantic arguments. When a premise hinges on a novel definition of a concept, it should inspire reevaluation.

Contemporary progressives have simply added a veneer of morality to these assumptions and goals, and an idolatrous moralism at that.

There's a variant of Christian Nationalism, based on Thomistic natural law theory, which holds that polities that respect natural rights (especially free association) will inevitably prosper.  And polities that reject the right to free association will naturally degrade

Like I said earlier if we don't stand up to this now we'll find ourselves in a situation where several counties in a few swing states exercise a de facto veto in national elections.

1336797442302414848 2020-12-10 06:18:41 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> This is a despicably dishonest of the argument TX AG makes. The real argument is that Article II authority rests with state legislators, and state SoS or state judges can't supplant it.  Otherwise we'll end up with 10 swing state counties selecting our presidents in perpetuity.

1336745593377525762 2020-12-10 02:52:39 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @ConstitutionEsq Cool, so your concerns are strictly partisan - you oppose Trump and approve of the process that delivered your desired result.  Disagree, but you're perfectly entitled to that opinion. Better to just state that up front, instead of hiding behind process-related sports metaphors.  https://t.co/VCtSArWE5S
1336743149893464066 2020-12-10 02:42:57 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> And as far as the Likelihood Argument, that cuts both ways: If specific swing state counties see that they can sway presidential elections through corrupt and unlawful means, then the likelihood is great that they will do it again in the future.  Very weak stuff.  https://t.co/0ujx31c87Q
1336742341621768195 2020-12-10 02:39:44 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @ConstitutionEsq So, just to be clear, you believe we should let an election result that was:  1) Arrived at via an unlawful process and   2) Fraudulent in its result   Stand because of some fatuous sports metaphor?  That's your premise?  https://t.co/S3lDExNUxh
1336739814004170752 2020-12-10 02:29:41 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @based_crab Agree. The issue of fraud can be raised tangentially, to demonstrate that the unconstitutional changes led to tangible harm, but the case itself doesn't depend on proving that fraud occurred to an extent that it swayed the election result.  https://t.co/502FpRTxtp
1336738432853430277 2020-12-10 02:24:12 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> On the other hand, Texas AG case isn't dependent on 'proving fraud'. It challenges the core constitutional validity of the changes made re: mail-in ballots, which is a much simpler argument to make and will automatically deal with all states in question.  https://t.co/uQo6ICpRf7  https://t.co/KlqwjcotSd
1336737529513578499 2020-12-10 02:20:37 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> I've noticed a trend of people black-pilling on the Texas AG case because its logic somehow let's people 'get away with fraud'.  This is misguided because SCOTUS has already indicated that they're extremely hesitant to get into the details of individual county's vote counts. 1/2

1334218144798416896 2020-12-03 03:29:28 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Maybe Kristi Noem is a sane and rational person who recognizes that a 98 year old is already decades past the average age of death and that it would be deeply illogical and unfair to make public health policy based on the needs of people well past the age of mortality.  https://t.co/jNEoi9u27h
1334216282053488640 2020-12-03 03:22:04 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> The fact that so many young women get so agitated over the ability to kill their own children under the color of the law is a shameful thing.  Poland is right to resist this sort of depravity. It's deeply corrosive to a civic culture.
1334210099884281863 2020-12-03 02:57:30 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> The thing is reading isn't just 'a personal relationship with stories'.

If he means stuff like Melville or Fitzgerald, sorry, but that's still very useful for building vocabulary and overall literacy.

Allowing kids to guide their own learning only works if they get motivation from home environment.

1333537221358596097 2020-12-01 06:23:44 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Of course Trump denies defeat, he genuinely believes there was widespread election fraud.  A belief he shares with nearly half of all voters, I might add.  https://t.co/2FCjHC5fYF  https://t.co/KoPbWmSPFk

Now the party is shot through with McCain family cronies who have zero appeal to the RW base (who, to be honest, John McCain always hated, slurring them as nutcases and bigots).

1333477499309858817 2020-12-01 02:26:25 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> This sort of Scamdemic shaming is despicable.

Instead Hispanics responded to Trump's anti-Green populism; working in the building trades, they are the ones likely to be pauperized by the Green New Deal.

If corporate media was right it should have led to a complete collapse in Trump's support, but he actually grew stronger, beacause in a large part because he was seen as opposing the technocrats anti-COVID hysteria.
1326644744680828928 2020-11-12 05:55:29 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Wait, Trump got more votes in 2020 than 2016 despite a Deep State leaking campaign, a fake impeachment, and four years of a constant drumbeat of 'Orange Man Bad' stories from the corporate media?

1325230127882637313 2020-11-08 08:14:18 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> I've always thought the presumption that COVID hysteria was purely aimed at the US presidential election and would subside after a Trump defeat was overly optimistic.  As Europe shows, there's a broader and more sinister agenda at play. Biden may be forced to shut us down again.

1320843995032027136 2020-10-27 05:45:23 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> I'm convinced that pro-energy, anti-Green populism is the way forward for the right globally, and the post-Trump American right in particular.  The left have embraced a pauperizing ideology to mollify some neurotic Millenials, but it's not something that has broad appeal.

That said, why are you trolling a mutual over such a basic tier observation? Just let it go if you don't agree.  Very poor form.
1320786098600202242 2020-10-27 01:55:19 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @cherryboyron I thought you were disparaging the post, I just didn't think such a vanilla take was worth getting busy over.  Of course there's more than just knowledge at work since the elderly get forgetful, plus prone to anxiety issues, which make them susceptible to such scams.  Oh well.

At any rate, sucks to lose a seat but it will be nice to see the last of her drama.

1320423931757604865 2020-10-26 01:56:12 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> If that's the case, then Collins can kiss her seat goodbye. Turning on GOP will depress her base and the Dems will never forgive her for her vote on Kavanaugh anyway.  Stupid move.

1320143281490186241 2020-10-25 07:21:00 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> This makes no sense, Biden holds himself up as a champion of the technocratic class.  His internal polls must be HORRIBLE if he's suddenly veering off into populism.

Everything he says has to be interpreted in light of some other sentence fragment, digression, or suggestion.  He's a verbal trainwreck.

1319464125882376192 2020-10-23 10:22:16 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden getting very short-tempered. He's probably going to need another week off.
1319463389727477763 2020-10-23 10:19:21 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden is noticeably slowing down.
1319462889711935488 2020-10-23 10:17:21 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker wheeling out the 'White Nationalist' card. I'll bet she was creaming in anticipation.
1319462519237378050 2020-10-23 10:15:53 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden wants us to make him an exemplar of our nation's character?

1319460540691943425 2020-10-23 10:08:01 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden stupid for trashing Trump's requirement for applying for asylum in foreign country. People approve of that overwhelmingly.
1319459873046802433 2020-10-23 10:05:22 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker refuses to acknowledge the Obama kept kids in cages.
1319459679739744259 2020-10-23 10:04:36 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden plays the 'Who we are' and 'Ripped from their arms' cards. Pathetic.

1319455879775711232 2020-10-23 09:49:30 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Trump smart pointing out how Biden will eliminate private health plans.
1319455072900812800 2020-10-23 09:46:18 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden goes Full Poe. How pathetic.
1319454789969825792 2020-10-23 09:45:10 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden's answer to everything is "I'll make it clear"  Pure pablum.
1319454267145670659 2020-10-23 09:43:06 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Again with Scranton and the fucking dinner table.
1319453962685304832 2020-10-23 09:41:53 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker is not willing to let Trump speak on Biden's corruption. Also not stopping Biden's interruptions.
1319453561273655299 2020-10-23 09:40:17 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden presenting himself as a born-again China hawk is laughable.
1319453073622880257 2020-10-23 09:38:21 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker is palpably unwilling to follow up with Joe on Hunter's corruption.

1319451843475443713 2020-10-23 09:33:28 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker immediately interrupts Trump when he points out the millions he's paid in taxes.
1319451461336637440 2020-10-23 09:31:57 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Now Biden is telling lies about Trump's taxes based on stolen returns.
1319451101155020800 2020-10-23 09:30:31 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @Abnormocracy It's pathetic. Every follow up to Trump has been a fact-check, but nothing to Biden.

1319448913515024385 2020-10-23 09:21:49 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Again Biden recommending things that we're already doing.
1319448566310621184 2020-10-23 09:20:27 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker vomiting out the fear-porn again.
1319448303839383552 2020-10-23 09:19:24 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden's answers on the outbreak make no sense. He's only recommending the things that are already happening.
1319447426994941952 2020-10-23 09:15:55 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker answering for Biden and contradicting Trump. Such bias.
1319447024727658497 2020-10-23 09:14:19 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Biden lying shamelessly about the early events of the outbreak.
1319446433053933569 2020-10-23 09:11:58 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Welker already teeing up Biden's responses. Pure bias.

Tube magazine shotguns are niche weapons for self-defense. They require a lot of practice, and it's hard to find places where you can properly practice self defense shotgunning.

Go with handgun first (I recommend 9mm Glock) because in most places there are more opportunities to shoot them. Bowling Pin matches are especially good practice.

Their biased coverage has entered the realm of being an in-kind campaign contribution to Biden 2020, a violation of campaign financing laws.  https://t.co/AZbkvFgSPl

1314610577537486850 2020-10-10 00:56:00 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @JergensenKrag Sov Cits come off as 'right wing' because they're into guns and anti-government, but that's all superficial.  Historically speaking, their ideology most closely resembles the Jacobins of the French Revolution. They're definitely fellow-travelers to Antifa.  https://t.co/19zcUkxF1b

1310642630800400385 2020-09-29 02:08:48 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @TrevorSutcliffe @CityBureaucrat Oh look! Snide last-wording over a difference in opinion over Milton Friedman's role in modern economic theory!  2009 called, they want their neoliberal-apologist talking points back.  https://t.co/aOhVwLlCbT
1310641977906651137 2020-09-29 02:06:12 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @TrevorSutcliffe @CityBureaucrat And I would counter that, absent the hyper fanboy fawning, my analysis of Friedman is far more practical and cogent than yours.  That said, I think I'll bow out here - I hate getting into these sorts of vitriolic exchanges with Mutuals. It's always poor form.
1310640289858682882 2020-09-29 01:59:30 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @TrevorSutcliffe @CityBureaucrat I will offer one last reply (which I already know you'll reject).  IMO, your distinction between 'technocratically managed' and 'algorithmically driven' has no practical difference; in fact, the idea of a detached, objectively derived algorithm is part and parcel with technocracy  https://t.co/2oEJNELTkJ

Along with most traditional Christians, traditional Jews, traditional Muslims, and even most Buddhists and Confucianists reject LGBT marriage.  https://t.co/HorBvYY4sR
1310636082359398400 2020-09-29 01:42:47 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @TrevorSutcliffe @CityBureaucrat Of course, as intelligent of a person as Friedman was, he should have recognized the reality of human nature and seen the impossibility of his preferred solution. In that sense, MF was similar to Marx.  Not looking to gin up a polemic here, just offering the courtesy of a reply.  https://t.co/hGuUGCqtv6
1310626722954588161 2020-09-29 01:05:35 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> You mean ACB didn't simply renounce her religious beliefs based on a judicial directive by GloboHomo? How dare she!

'Rule of law' ideology is an Anglo-Protestant scam, meant to justify the severing of social networks formed by family bonds and voluntary association (IOW, Mediterranean/Catholic systems based on reciprocity) with a class based system justified through legalism.  https://t.co/zdFmGzdiO1

They'll pauperize the individual with income tax, property tax, etc, but taxing foreign manufacturers is beyond the pale.  https://t.co/z1iXdR1UIo

1304213257771724803 2020-09-11 08:20:46 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @night_warrior46 That has nothing to do with my point; foreign demand for US exports is a separate issue from us imposing tariffs on imports.  In the early days of US history the Federal government raised nearly all its revenue via tariffs, and the Federal government was fairly limited.
1304211794408419329 2020-09-11 08:14:57 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Disingenuous. Given the fact that for the first century of our history the majority of Federal taxes came from tariffs (while income and capital gains taxes were zero) I'd argue that tariffs are actually consistent with small government.  Pakman just loves high income taxes.  https://t.co/pal7gVvsjP

1304037514383101958 2020-09-10 20:42:25 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Trump didn't lie. He was quite open that putting out an optimistic spin because he didn't want to incite a destructive panic (a perfectly valid concern at the time).  And time has proved him correct. COVID is almost exclusively a threat to people who are already terminally ill.

Historically, they've harbored some pretty serious anti-Catholic prejudices (conflicts with the Irish were a big part of the process that drove them into the American West).  And they can be relentlessly self-dealing in business.

1301485738400329736 2020-09-03 19:42:35 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> "Daniel Prude's brother, Joe Prude said he initially called police for help because Daniel was having a mental health incident."  We need to declare a complete moratorium on 13/52 mental health issues until we can figure out what the hell is going on!  https://t.co/xFxFdYB7sq
1301485486947610624 2020-09-03 19:41:35 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Same day, same story: "Daniel Prude's brother, Joe Prude said he initially called police for help because Daniel was having a mental health incident."  Many such cases!  https://t.co/MMTIfQfn7e
1301463689204301824 2020-09-03 18:14:58 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Proof that this 'press conference' was a fraud, with ringers planted to lob softball questions.
1301345192654635010 2020-09-03 10:24:06 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> CNN is an enemy of our lawful republic.

1300938948114632704 2020-09-02 07:29:50 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @_MrMaxwellHouse Sad day. Always sad to hear of a pet passing.
1300908250360090625 2020-09-02 05:27:51 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> This is how the debates will be moderated (if there are any): Biden will say whatever he's been instructed to by his handlers, and the moderators will accept his assertions at face value while hectoring any attempts Trump makes to push back.  It will backfire on them though.
1300883219378831366 2020-09-02 03:48:23 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @DwarfToday Agree, a car antenna is a much better choice in such circumstances.   https://t.co/EZOmyuL7ay

1300829708024774658 2020-09-02 00:15:45 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Trump at 1:45: Press doesn't care if Trump supporters are executed in the street, shameful media are fueling the violence in America's cities.   https://t.co/ztk1z52pgX
1300828302999982082 2020-09-02 00:10:10 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> Referring to the Chamber of Commerce as 'right-leaning' is misleading. The CoC is neoliberal through and through so endorsing Democrats - the party of Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook, and Goldman Sachs, and NAFTA, and PMFN to China - is just a natural next step.
1300816076712939520 2020-09-01 23:21:35 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> "This POTUS, Donald John Trump, has instigated a race war in America."  Vote Trump 2020!  https://t.co/AfkYOAKRyg
1300767876924624897 2020-09-01 20:10:03 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @s_decatur Maybe the LOLbert/progressive talking point re: 'mass incarceration' is false.  Because it looks to me like the real problem in USA is that we're not putting enough criminals behind bars.  https://t.co/0fDiaoKcMu
1300752714381565952 2020-09-01 19:09:48 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> The evidence is multiple videos of the Antifas assaulting him.  Defund NPR.  https://t.co/O04HgUSntW

1300737340428750849 2020-09-01 18:08:43 +0800 <FrantizekPaul> @s_decatur Reyes was just attempting to conduct his own commemoration on the anniversary of Emmett Till's death.   https://t.co/ZhKSPnBVOM
