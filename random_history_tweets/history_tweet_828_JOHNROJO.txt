1341979561525792768 2020-12-24 13:30:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I feel like America is at a crossroads.  We will either have justice... or... we will slip to a group totalitarianism that presents itself as "we the people".  In the name of Covid... our liberties are slipping.  In the name of "hate Trump" we ignore the law.  Rough seas ahead.

It‚Äôs about Trump blowing up status quo and getting too close to messing with a VERY good thing for those at the public trough.  If ANYONE had tried what Trump has tried they too would be politically assassinated.  Happened to Lincoln and JFK for real.

1327377715079442433 2020-11-14 06:28:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This fellow has it exactly backward...   Trump has exposed the "Orwellianism" we have seen developing for decades.  We are on the cusp of a big leap into the full impact of the administrative (sometimes called "deep") state.
1327377250522525696 2020-11-14 06:26:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Listen and watch as the left burns the Bible (figuratively now, but actually on its way), demonizes and isolates anyone that disagrees with them...   a very dangerous path we are on.
1327376287887892482 2020-11-14 06:22:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> What is chilling?...  is that so many don't see the Nazi tactics of the left as they find things to cancel and call Hitlerish...   This is classic Alinsky...  it's called demonize and isolate.  We're on to you....

1327099527447252992 2020-11-13 12:02:38 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RogerMecklenbu1 I'm serious with this question.  Don't you believe we should have a way to make sure that every vote is legal?
1327098833503830016 2020-11-13 11:59:52 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I think this happened/is happening.  Now what do you suggest?
1327098532902305792 2020-11-13 11:58:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RogerMecklenbu1 If we can manage financial transactions with mega encryption, why can't we also do the same with the voting process?  Do you think that is a good idea?  Why?
1327097574122164224 2020-11-13 11:54:52 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RogerMecklenbu1 Sort of depends upon what type of cookie you lay out, no?  However, I love the idea... except that the exit poll would be terribly skewed if you had plates of oatmeal raisin cookies and I was in the voting booth that day...

1327052577360338944 2020-11-13 08:56:04 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Interesting that politicians feel like they must "DO" something.   I'm all for getting the hell out of my business... provide for the common defense and leave us alone!  LOVE gridlock!  #lovegridlock

It's only been about 55 years or so...  You've still got another 135 to consider what he said and what Joe Biden has helped deliver during his 47 years at the trough.
1326057814368813056 2020-11-10 15:03:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JRubinBlogger If you are real and if anyone associated with you helps you with your lists, I pray forgiveness for you all, after you reject such evil thinking.  This is some of the scariest thinking I've seen in my lifetime.  God help you.
1325505610721325056 2020-11-09 02:28:58 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JUConnor25 @JohnJamesMI VS breaking stuff, looting, burning businesses and beating people up.  Good point.
1323991996231348227 2020-11-04 22:14:25 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Went to bed "early" last night, thinking we wouldn't know who won the election until mid-December...   Here's why.  I don't trust the folks out mining ballots now... particularly in PA.  It is criminal to do this!  https://t.co/q67vvTYqoR

1323874649608921088 2020-11-04 14:28:07 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden Because we are doing everything we can to steal it if we can't outright win it.   We really feel good...
1323874410512613378 2020-11-04 14:27:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem Be not dismayed...  bigger picture matters most.
1323874021302173696 2020-11-04 14:25:37 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem Tough night...
1323873906592083969 2020-11-04 14:25:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem You will wake up and find that Trump is waiting on PA to find more votes for Biden.  This is a lawyer's dream...
1323684482361118720 2020-11-04 01:52:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> How it ended.  https://t.co/dCUKjN3APX
1323583541985247232 2020-11-03 19:11:22 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Agree!
1323440699186974720 2020-11-03 09:43:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RoseWinkler Not a good idea @RoseWinkler  When popular sentiment turns, you may find yourself wanting protection from the concentrated majorities.  Great minds have thought through this very carefully.
1323439300717916160 2020-11-03 09:38:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RoseWinkler My understanding is COVID virus size ranges .06 - .14 microns. The N-95 mask screens down to .3 micrometers. So that‚Äôs a problem.  However...  the virus must attach to respiratory droplets that are HUGE.  So the masks ARE effective for airborne transmission.
1323436753198354434 2020-11-03 09:28:04 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RoseWinkler @ThursdayGem Hadn‚Äôt considered that.  I think there are local ordinances against driving while chowdering  in New England.  It‚Äôs a regional thing.
1323435661194481667 2020-11-03 09:23:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @itsjenwbitches Hmmm.  Not an accident then.  Wonder if we will ever know?  Could be a WW III thing.  Not good.
1323433022192930816 2020-11-03 09:13:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @itsjenwbitches I have thought the same!  My cynical nature went to intentional Chinese release.

1323417032017108992 2020-11-03 08:09:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Joe Biden can't complete a sentence without stumbling.  Seriously...   he has a problem.  And... he's been part of the systemic smothering of black Americans for DECADES...  TRUMP for four years.   Don't let him anywhere near the presidency!  PLEASE!  https://t.co/8mik6O8Nrz
1323413450198978560 2020-11-03 07:55:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> It's explained by great healthcare heroes.  And... it's a bit scary for them.  We have an associate, MD, who died after being infected in NY.  This is REAL and it is deadly to people already compromised by underlying medical issues.
1323412491037102080 2020-11-03 07:51:40 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I will fight for your helzurphtketp.  I promise you more erzoutkpops per captitas...    Under the Harris administration....  https://t.co/l8x8XR6hJ5

1323408647448227840 2020-11-03 07:36:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Silent truths from a healthcare worker/hero.  Two months ago the mortality rate for COVID was 2X's what it is now.  How is this explained?  Better treatments?  More testing?  Fewer deaths?
1323390746456567808 2020-11-03 06:25:16 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @thewillwitt @JoeBiden Don‚Äôt go gettin‚Äô all precise on me now!

1323111277405769730 2020-11-02 11:54:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @nzingaschild @WuritiUbafu Gotta love football players that start throwing punches into a face covered by a helmet designed to take cracks that would explode a rock.  Studs for sure, but not very smart, apparently.
1323109196645109760 2020-11-02 11:46:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is the same old shite, but from a brotha who bought the plantation....  and wants to KEEP it.  It's HIS and don't nobody gonna f with it!  Kinda like "You can't do this on your own...  You need me".  https://t.co/mQ0Wx8UUhc

1322958038781681665 2020-11-02 01:45:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> A guy by the name of Isaiah says leaders must have integrity and a sense of justice.  They will protect us and give us safe cover.  They will refresh others like cool shade in a desert.  Their eyes/ears are open to our needs.... empathetic.

1322928720278032385 2020-11-01 23:49:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @proxcee @Usatorz1 According to CDC through Oct. 24, only 6% of deaths attributed to COVID were from COVID ONLY.  For the rest there were 2.6 comorbidities involved.  So...  You are probably correct.  Also, the death rate is half what it was in July...  Why?  https://t.co/28R7abfxjm
1322927417799790592 2020-11-01 23:44:09 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman So sad...  I am sorry for this.  Your experience, unfortunately, is multiplied all over the US.  To Big medicine you are a point of revenue...  get you through... bill your insurance...  repeat.  You ARE the $$ sign.
1322926170376081409 2020-11-01 23:39:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Anyone noticing that the mortality rate is about half what it was back in July/August? (+/-5.0%) Why?  Did we have bad data then?  or now?  or...   Are things getting better because of theraputics?  or...     What??  We are now at 2.5%  https://t.co/erJ7RgEFLL

Do you see a problem??! Only 6% of deaths are attributed to COVID-19 only.    The Stanford U. "study" appears to be a hit piece...  https://t.co/XzVdxzimjN

1320929869077704704 2020-10-27 11:26:37 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CharriseLane Patience, kindness, goodness and self control...  NOT.
1320929607197966342 2020-10-27 11:25:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is a thing perfected by James Carville and Bill Clinton back in the day...   made the Pant Suit famous eventually.
1320928791078686720 2020-10-27 11:22:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This woman (KH) is not real.  Is she??
1320927083044818946 2020-10-27 11:15:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @jenniferkwd1 @greenhousenyt You forgot to add "and often" to the vote early thing.  About the moral compass...  what's a moral??
1320925372028841984 2020-10-27 11:08:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This has got to hurt @HillaryClinton   Maybe not...

1320885954865811457 2020-10-27 08:32:07 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Elections have consequences.  Boy HOWDY!
1320883622279180289 2020-10-27 08:22:51 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem First... make sure the taser is fully charged... just like having gas in your car.  Second... don't go to 7/11 at night (take a snack with you to work)...  If these don't work... Put into Drive and pedal to the metal...
1320881990661337088 2020-10-27 08:16:22 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @BunnysDaughter @realDonaldTrump Chuck...  you have "fought" for no one but yourself for many years now.  You have contributed nothing except to the status quo, which has been very good to you.  Good for you.  Keep up the good fight I suppose.  Laughable though.
1320880193754443776 2020-10-27 08:09:13 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Which cackle is the most annoying to you?  Pant Suit lady or Kamala?  For me it is Pant Suit.

1320567140290719745 2020-10-26 11:25:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman @gasmantx isn't well studied on supply/demand economics.  Demand = Wages    Supply = Workforce     As Supply increases...  Demand (Wages) drops.  Do you see the problem??  https://t.co/hco0mZRCkc
1320565471003906048 2020-10-26 11:18:37 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman Anyone that advocates for the status quo is a dummy...  change is in the air and the change master in chief is busy messing up the SQ...   He's taking heat...  He's not one of them...   @therealtywilson
1320564543840346112 2020-10-26 11:14:56 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @jonnyboyca Agree with the depressing election thing...  That's the problem with change...   status quo is so much more comfortable.
1320563976653008902 2020-10-26 11:12:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman Rational people voting for Democrats are stupid...
1320537212274888705 2020-10-26 09:26:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman You know...  2016 Black Americans 12% for Trump...   2020, I predict 18% Black Americans vote for Trump.  Besides an emotional tantrum.... do you have a prediction??

1320523346023387137 2020-10-26 08:31:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Pennsylvania, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma...  better know what you are voting for....
1320523094688067585 2020-10-26 08:30:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @jonnyboyca As opposed to having the gubment on their butts?
1320522833546498049 2020-10-26 08:29:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem Same...   The bias stream you choose gives you the information you want.  The other stream contradicts.  I think it's going to be close, but the Black vote will make the difference.  I predict an 18% black vote for Trump vs. 12% in 2016.  You?
1320423048558702592 2020-10-26 01:52:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> She is imperfect as are we all.  Also, not what our country wants or needs.  Pass on her and joe.

1319485203715293184 2020-10-23 11:46:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Mr_Yancy LBJ is the guy who INTENDED to put black Americans into the debt of the welfare state!  That dude really did a number on black America...    He was no hero for America...   He made sure black America was forever beholden to the hand outs of the political elites.
1319484254980509696 2020-10-23 11:42:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem Coffee ice-cream please.  Pay you back....   after the election...   I promise.
1319467034204270592 2020-10-23 10:33:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Since 2016, black Americans have started swinging toward a conservative political view...   why?  https://t.co/PAp2XUKaCL

1317877954391703552 2020-10-19 01:19:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> No question...  this election is about Trump.  Funny thing... it was about the Pant Suit lady @HillaryClinton in 2016.

1317808796895412224 2020-10-18 20:44:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Maybe because you speak truth to status quo and a group of thugs want to make it an event, hurt you and the blame you for it.  Similar to a rape victim who is blamed for the violence.

After 47 years Status Quo Joe and MANY senators (x-presidents too) along with him will retire as millionaires.  How does that happen?  (Think Ukraine, China... maybe Iran and $1,700,000,000 in cash)  The thing...
1317534569780940801 2020-10-18 02:34:54 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem My thought is that if you are ALWAYS 30 minutes late, you can also be 30 minutes EARLY.  It's intention.  And, honestly, I think it is rude to those who invited you or are expecting you.  The other side of this is... if you suddenly change... friends will ask what's wrong.

1316756170653290498 2020-10-15 23:01:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Standard lawyer response to information:  1.  If you don't have the law on your side, attack the facts.  2.  If you don't have the facts on your side, attack the source of the facts.  3.  If you don't like the source of the facts, create your own.    I see much of this all over.  https://t.co/78Y6ZpTegs
1316732108065341440 2020-10-15 21:26:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I watch both streams of media... Fox and CNN, just see the contrast.  It couldn't be more obvious.  E-mails suggest connection between Hunter, Burisma and Joe.  Fox:  Clear connection to Oligarks in Ukrain   CNN: Tabloidish and weak.  It's all how you see corruption.  No?

1316723928086335488 2020-10-15 20:53:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @meenaharris There are those who will suck the joy and levity out any situation to reinforce their self loathing.  And there are many who will agree with them while self flagellating.  Take a PILL...  a red one.  Not that this color or shape in any way diminishes any other.

1314019866127597570 2020-10-08 09:48:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Kamala and Joe BOTH said they would ban fracking.  Would cost 10‚Äôs of THOUSANDS of jobs in the heartland.  Now she denies it.  How do you know an attorney is lying?   She smiles a lot with a left eyebrow raised just ever so delicately.
1314018832252624896 2020-10-08 09:44:37 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Kamala believes in science from the scientists on the payroll of gubment that craves man made climate ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.

1313658421183500288 2020-10-07 09:52:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden Bet they used an Amazon purchased variable speed fan to make that flag flow in the studio...
1313657601910075392 2020-10-07 09:49:13 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realBenjiirby You crazy...    (like a fox)
1313655209541935104 2020-10-07 09:39:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Such a sweet October surprise...  What song is he singing her??
1313654895606722560 2020-10-07 09:38:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> HillARious...   believable...  NOT.
1313654327404265474 2020-10-07 09:36:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @SpeakerPelosi It's always been about the children, right Nancy?  How do you sleep at night?  Propofol?  You are accusing the President of doing what you and Chuck have been doing for weeks now... on OUR backs.  You are a sad, little person.  You work for US... not yourself.
1313652879899590656 2020-10-07 09:30:27 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoshuaPotash @sayitaintteej 'Tswat Nancy and Chuck were doing, but were much more "sophisticated"...  We are being used....
1313596559288946691 2020-10-07 05:46:39 +0800 <JOHNROJO> VERY good ad.  Best I‚Äôve seen yet.  Why I resist the status quo.

1313585371733807107 2020-10-07 05:02:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JBariatrics @realDonaldTrump Looks to me , in classic Trump style, like HE is putting direct light on Nancy and Chuck‚Äôs negotiating position by using the same tactic, only owning it.  They want people hurting and are using US in their deceitful and despicable game. Fire them!

1313312495403257857 2020-10-06 10:57:53 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @TeaBoots @7r0uble I love it when people go up against status quo...  buck the norm...  challenge group think...  call out a lie...  or just, disrupt a staged event.  This is classic Alinsky.
1313311922083844098 2020-10-06 10:55:37 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @shellsncheezzz Andrea Mitchell has plenty of words...  sort of along the line of a Dan Rather...  much more "sophisticated", nuanced BS though...
1313311383505825797 2020-10-06 10:53:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden Be a good citizen and wear the damn mask.  Else I'll lock your ass up....

1313301442610954241 2020-10-06 10:13:58 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia I think you have this right.  The one who SELLS it vs. the one who delivers it.  It's a balance between the ability to accurately measure what people think (want) and the ability to also influence what they think (want).  Ultimately... it's a sales job.  We are the sellers.

1312779596803330050 2020-10-04 23:40:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ThursdayGem Makes me sad too...  mostly because they have bought the BS that white conservatives are racists.  Truth is... some are... most aren't.  There are racists of all skin types...  The real racism is that we perpetuate the impact = concept of racism.  What we resist.... persists.
1312778201723273222 2020-10-04 23:34:48 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia AND... he looks good with an earring...  Kind of a pirate look...  https://t.co/rbGPRo3W7A

1312741151330504705 2020-10-04 21:07:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia It's an analogy... you know this.  Come on now...  Let's not get all personal about it...   Love your motivation and message, Coach.
1312740577256116224 2020-10-04 21:05:17 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @laurenboebert If your contract has been violated over the course of say, 250 years, would you still use the same contract?  Don't focus on the contractor so much as the base document.  Keep what's good.  Fix what isn't.  Status Quo Joe is just a symptom.
1312739335368826881 2020-10-04 21:00:21 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Mr_Yancy Focus on history and the generational, economic impact vs. one individual.  Trump is only one player in our history.  He seems to have disrupted to the point BOTH Dems. and Repubs. fear and dislike him.  What does that tell you about status quo?
1312738649914724353 2020-10-04 20:57:38 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @IAmMonique16 Everything OK?
1312738263807950848 2020-10-04 20:56:06 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia Love and truth are closely connected, my friend.  I think don't be the crab in the pot pulling one that got out back in...
1312737681139470339 2020-10-04 20:53:47 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoyVBehar As young people would say, "Why does your face need so many doctors?"  Makes me think they might be able to do something on your voice as well.  So harsh and raspy.  Good question though.
1312737195501985793 2020-10-04 20:51:51 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Who said this?  "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced".  JB had it right.  Applies to many things in life that need changing.
1312535798739214339 2020-10-04 07:31:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @mrknowbodypodc1 Seems like a great conversationalist to me...  ü§î

1312188679289409536 2020-10-03 08:32:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RealSteveCox has a problem... Thinking he is a sad, hurt person (hurt people, hurt people).  Must appeal to someone, who relates to him, sadly.  Thank you @TPJhawk for putting this out.
1312187234578120705 2020-10-03 08:26:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @FavGhostwriter @Mr_Yancy I honestly believe that right now is the time to get folks to vote.  D. Trump is a goof, but he intends well for black Americans... at least he's DONE more than any other Pres. in 130 years.  This Platinum Plan is a great start.  Economic power = political power = change.  Vote.
1312183538142253058 2020-10-03 08:11:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Sorry, but what possible signal could this be?  And... why do they call themselves the "Lincoln Project"?  Like the John Wilkes Boothe Lincoln Project?  or... 1860 Presidential election Lincoln Project (Lincoln won)??   Seriously...  these people have no scruples me thinks...  https://t.co/x3gJxU3rnw
1312109614712807424 2020-10-03 03:18:04 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Ugliness happening in comments about people who could die from this virus.   Ugly is as ugly does.  https://t.co/LiZEFxP1N1

1312031856632750083 2020-10-02 22:09:05 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @DineshDSouza Might Mr. Durham be part of the same institutions D. Trump was elected to disrupt?  If so... then, you have your answer...
1312029355279777794 2020-10-02 21:59:09 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @EddyGriffin14 Because the term conflates ideas of a skin color that is  "superior" to all others vs. a group of skinheads in Idaho vs. a system of repression vs. the actual experience of many black Americans and condemns an entire group of people because of their skin color (white).
1312025975077699584 2020-10-02 21:45:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HotepJesus Great take on this twitter-sphere!  Thanks for the reminder!  No argument here...  https://t.co/6rMlbXABeg
1312024728811589633 2020-10-02 21:40:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Deep upset in the deep state.  Status quo deeply unsettled...  Keep up the good work.  We are deeply thankful...  Deep stuff, huh?
1312022404504449024 2020-10-02 21:31:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @AllEyezOn_Meech @WuritiUbafu Because they are both part of a system...  I understand completely.  Except...   Trump was not/is not one of them.  That is why BOTH Repubs. and Dems. hate/fear him.  He wasn't groomed to assume the reigns of the system so well maintained for so many decades...
1312021274982481922 2020-10-02 21:27:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden Why am I not just a little skeptical about these well wishes?  https://t.co/PA1EpZMv6t
1311875816645632001 2020-10-02 11:49:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JackeeHarry I don't know what adjectives to use here...  I just know that a large group of Americans, were SEVERELY disadvantaged and have suffered SIGNIFICANT generational economic impact because of the color of their skin.  Grace, mercy and... fix it.
1311854910862917633 2020-10-02 10:25:58 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Run_TMC_10 I've never heard this perspective before...  Thank you for sharing it... truly.  In terms of the GENERATIONAL economic impacts of law, regulation, policy, administration etc. on black America, the impact has been tremendous.  Time for the nation to recon and atone, no?
1311731381228253188 2020-10-02 02:15:06 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Thinking the CA thing is for show only.  CA only?  ‚ÄúPay‚Äù reparations?  What is ‚ÄúPay‚Äù?  What is ‚ÄúReparations ‚Äú?  We have a start to a national conversation.  Metrics matter.
1311728762392895496 2020-10-02 02:04:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @kiaradwatts @Black_Action Great point.   ADOS only I believe.
1311727959707967490 2020-10-02 02:01:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Sounds good, BUT doesn‚Äôt it always come down to enforcement and administration?  I mean, we also have laws against using our FBI/CIA/NSC/DOJ from spying on US citizens, no?
1311713046302281730 2020-10-02 01:02:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I have never tweeted anything from Trump's camp, but this is a powerful reminder of what the democrat (Biden) legacy is and has been.  I find Trump's narcissistic style hard to hear, but he gets the idea of economic and judicial freedom and liberty for black America.
1311705225699504128 2020-10-02 00:31:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I can't help but share this.  The truth is... Status Quo Joe (who IS the Democrat Party as he put it) is the same now as then...  just not all there and more dangerous for black America and for our country in general...
1311704485228687365 2020-10-02 00:28:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Honestly @Ultranoetic neither you nor I, nor anyone living now,ü§î is personally responsible for the horrors and outright economic rip off of black America.  After about three years of study on this topic, I learned I DID benefit.  We can be responsible without being at fault.  üòÆ
1311701646917992448 2020-10-02 00:16:57 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Bev... if you are out there...   I'm not a bot.

1311483246207741955 2020-10-01 09:49:06 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden CNN captured this aura last week.  Status Quo Joe v Saint Donald...   Such entertainment!  https://t.co/1KIKAV2viw
1311481788695490562 2020-10-01 09:43:19 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Why would someone call you a bot?  A nice lady, name Beverly, blocked me after claiming I am a bot...   Honestly hurt my feelings a bit.  This Twitter thing is surprising at times.

Trump:  Why did Hunter get $3million from Russian Oligark?      Joe:  You suck.      Trump:  What about the coup?   Joe:  smirk...      Joe:  Just go out and vote.    Trump: Fraud...

1310968661642010625 2020-09-29 23:44:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> NYC Board of Elections Exec. Dir. suffers from ED.  Blames the third party he selected.  THIS is how bureaucracy works... find a way to dodge responsibility.  How is the even POSSIBLE?  ED = Electoral Dysfunction...  Is there an App. for ED??  https://t.co/ufyzOS5REs
1310725566736330754 2020-09-29 07:38:21 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia I think Felicia has this right.  Repression from right and left. (Dems and Repubs.).  Status quo has got to go.
1310724405945925632 2020-09-29 07:33:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JosephNSanberg @Aspiration Suggestion...  manage the trees we have vs. leave them to burn in earth scorching infernos?  USFS and BLM have become fire fighting bureaucracies vs land management bureaucracies.  Is this another Savior requires Victim thing?? ( Think welfare, NAACP, Section 8, SNAP etc...).
1310679629104062467 2020-09-29 04:35:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> If this were Portland, Minneapolis or any other Dem. run city and 11 pm - 3 am this kid would have been attacked by a bunch of Nazis.
1310678056177152005 2020-09-29 04:29:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Good one... üòÇü§£
1310676491215294469 2020-09-29 04:23:21 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Too true to be good...
1310651592413245443 2020-09-29 02:44:25 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @BandyXLee1 This includes ‚Äúleadership‚Äù of Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff et als I presume.  So, choose your path carefully.  Who crazy do you want to be??
1310349097652686848 2020-09-28 06:42:24 +0800 <JOHNROJO> In other words... "WE" the people...  This must happen... for the sake of our country...
1310347613770842112 2020-09-28 06:36:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Education is IMPORTANT, but not the holy grail.  Fast track economic favor, including home/real estate wealth and education has got to be a part of the formula of reparations.   Go back over our history... If the 40 acres and a mule thing had worked... Different story today..
1310346658551664642 2020-09-28 06:32:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> All true about the institutional aspect... but... don't make this a race vs. race thing...  It hasn't/won't play.  This is a knowledge/education thing that I believe people will understand eventually and hopefully now rather than later...  Grace, Mercy... fix it.
1310343277909082113 2020-09-28 06:19:17 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Do you see yet??  Bigger forces moving here than a 2020 election.  How could this guy get nominated over so MANY others who have brains and can put a sentence together? Why I call him Status Quo Joe...  https://t.co/Lv7Ch3akjJ
1310333777361674240 2020-09-28 05:41:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia Excellent!  This was a time, under the direction of Abraham Lincoln, that, if it had continued, would have given newly freed slaves' families, GENERATIONS LATER (now), wealth and economic clout and freedom.  Do something around the GI Bill too!  Grace, mercy and fix it.

1309959528839028737 2020-09-27 04:54:24 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia When you do the work of learning how our government (started regional/local to deconstruct reconstruction) ripped off newly freed slaves, and black Americans after, of what they were promised, you understand the wealth gap. The trillion $$ question is what are ‚Äúreparations‚Äù?
1309950632246345728 2020-09-27 04:19:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a fringe...  no base there.
1309940005855547395 2020-09-27 03:36:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> What's happening is Status Quo Joe doesn't generate interest.  If people are honest, they know...  He's not all there.

1309896018666958849 2020-09-27 00:42:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Reparations began immediately after the Civil War ended...  40 Acres and a Mule...  Lincoln was assassinated and replaced with Andrew Johnson, a very Democrat leaning guy who was very sympathetic to the South...  The 40 acres and the mule died quickly...

Don't underestimate the support for black America from the MAGA bunch.  Don't lump them all into the neat little tent you've been 'splained to by the progressives/liberal/Democrat gang.

1309590451658391552 2020-09-26 04:27:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Found this cartoon that helps me laugh as I'm reminded of the thing @SonnieJohnson speaks of...  "Why does black America continue to vote for Democrats?"  This is not a dumb question...  It's always good to laugh a little....  https://t.co/akJ3oV6hAU
1309570463987834880 2020-09-26 03:08:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @7r0uble @rondeaulivia It's not JUST liberals...   MANY have done the status quo thing over the decades.  MANY have benefited from having a large percentage of black folk beholding to them through welfare, subsidized housing, free medical, AFDC etc.  instead of access to business, education, freedom!
1309567742111092738 2020-09-26 02:57:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RubinReport @T_McKnight_21 When was this quote made?  Likely when RBG was experiencing age and failing health during President Obama's last 4 years.  I imagine she assumed the Pant Suit Lady would win...  Just a scientific Wild Ass Guess....

1309267883717877760 2020-09-25 07:06:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is true for many things... even talk of reparations.  Ask Status Quo Joe.

1309261302662131720 2020-09-25 06:39:54 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realDonaldTrump And... what about those who lose insurance if the ACA goes away?!  Why haven‚Äôt you proposed a solution?   More votes on this than the 9 discarded military votes found....
1309260438031544321 2020-09-25 06:36:27 +0800 <JOHNROJO> THIS is the conversation we should be having and @tifftwin has it right.  What solution do you bring?

1308969936396709889 2020-09-24 11:22:06 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @awheal1 @Beverly79943415 @MephsM I don't understand "Not following".  Explain?
1308953112074305536 2020-09-24 10:15:15 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 I find you interesting and honest.  I find you angry and hurt.  I'm just a guy who has studied the condition of black America IN DETAIL and am still learning.  What I've learned is beyond disturbing.  I advocate for reparations.  The devil is in the details.
1308952506131595265 2020-09-24 10:12:51 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Time for a new/old catastrophe focus, shall we?  Based on the science below, what can we expect soon (geologic time)?  Hint... we do NOT want an ice age...  https://t.co/DXCCMjYKtI
1308951446369443840 2020-09-24 10:08:38 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Wait...  I only got one word!

1308926437718622208 2020-09-24 08:29:16 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I heard a story about crabs in a pot...  Tim Scott is being drug down into the nasty soup...  racism knows no party.  https://t.co/5shxf4vFqH
1308924036974604289 2020-09-24 08:19:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @USATRUMPMAN1 @BunnysDaughter It was Hamas calling to say they wanted in the peace deal with Israel...  pretty sure.
1308923422953615360 2020-09-24 08:17:17 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This happened.  It was not the only atrocity against black Americans.  When will we, as a nation, get real about it and deal with it?  We don't have to forget the many good things we've done as a nation, but we ought to remember and atone for the bad stuff as well.  No?
1308920041036021761 2020-09-24 08:03:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> OH!  That hurt!!  üôÄüôÄ
1308919385843695625 2020-09-24 08:01:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WSJ Maybe because the truth is so shocking?  Just observing from a 3rd party view...
1308918623604531203 2020-09-24 07:58:13 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Lenny2you @rondeaulivia @benshapiro Touched a nerve here...
1308918438845386752 2020-09-24 07:57:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Lenny2you @rondeaulivia @benshapiro Watched and listened carefully the AG's report.  It was an announced entry and there was an independent, citizen witness to the request to enter.  After no response, the police chose to forcefully enter.  Upon entry, a guy, shot one of the officers in the leg. They returned fire.
1308899411267907589 2020-09-24 06:41:52 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Lenny2you @rondeaulivia @benshapiro Umm...  The AG from KY explained, in detail, the findings of the Grand Jury.  The "No Knock" thing is not correct.  Why would you continue this false narrative?  And, what does the 2nd ammendment have to with it?  Are you some white punk looking for a reason to wave his AK??
1308897278917316610 2020-09-24 06:33:24 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Mr_Yancy Moves me...  thank you.
1308896736027475974 2020-09-24 06:31:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Request for help...  My wife has suffered with this horrible rash on her hands... the palm sides.  Her skin peels off, exposing the lower/inner layers of skin.  VERY painful.  Itchy to start.  She has been prescribed Prednisone.  That works for about 10 days.  Any suggestions??
1308895175498964992 2020-09-24 06:25:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Just for fun...  How can you be married to your X??  Confused...  https://t.co/Nu4S8K8rpB

1308807765192654850 2020-09-24 00:37:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @BarryVictor5 About half the country says Trump is the result of Obama.   Any president is a reflection of the collective "you". Trump may very well be a reflection of a collective rejection of pant suit lady.  Either way, it really is YOUR (our) fault.  Be the fault...

1308805948660617216 2020-09-24 00:30:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Mr_Yancy @NyeusiHotep Well said.  History speaks in terms of the whole.  Current reality is absolutely affected and the result of history.  Current reality becomes the individual experience.  The individual experience shapes action.  Action creates current reality.  Current reality shapes history...
1308805195023790080 2020-09-24 00:27:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @tabian_matthew @HouseofPain1776 @Mr_Yancy I mostly agree with you.  We talk about our politicians as "leadership", but they are actually "followership"...  They read the tea leaves, do the polling, test the waters, run up the trial balloon and THEN decide what path to take.  Any independent politicians who lead?
1308803676199243778 2020-09-24 00:21:27 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I want to understand, because I don't...   What does "HOTEP" mean to you?  How do you relate to this concept?  Does this article come close to reality??  https://t.co/HHcmaqnSk1
1308803258031329280 2020-09-24 00:19:47 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Mr_Yancy @NyeusiHotep If you can make huge generalizations and just look at history of law, regulation, administration of each and even our own Constitution, you are justified in coming to this conclusion!  Don't forget that individuals are separate from this.  Each can hate, love or be indifferent.
1308795382999072769 2020-09-23 23:48:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Wait...  is this the same Ukraine Burisma associated with Status Quo Joe??  Shocking...  how do you spell hypocrite?  https://t.co/vltgebpubt
1308613246278987776 2020-09-23 11:44:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @T_McKnight_21 I thought the pant suit lady was pretty soft...  tired too.  Thinking of her black accent moment back in 2016 when was a shoe in. ‚ÄúI am in no ways ty-urd.  Very convincing.
1308589185461182467 2020-09-23 10:09:08 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Me NEITHER @Black_Action !  Hypocrisy is an overused word, but not for this guy...  wow...  And his room... er uh...  I mean running mate, Kamala, acted on this bunch of crap from Status Quo Joe...  locked up thousands of black men in CA.  Time for something real...
1308587618569867265 2020-09-23 10:02:55 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @doritegrocery @Black_Action Really does communicate what Dems. think of black culture.  This is really awful.  Remember back in 2016 when Status Quo Joe said "They gon' put ya'll back in chains"...   Another glimpse of what he thinks and what his party thinks of black America.  This must stop. How 'bout now
1308586417564475392 2020-09-23 09:58:08 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Queenfreemarket Amen Sista!  Our schools have become mostly VERY expensive baby sitting.  Why should you pay taxes for nothing?

1308582873276903426 2020-09-23 09:44:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 I don‚Äôt think so, but don‚Äôt put it past some of the states run by Democrats.  They tend to stretch the rules sometimes.  And the USPS union just announced support for Status Quo Joe.  Who picks up and delivers (or not) the mail in ballots?
1308576358558175232 2020-09-23 09:18:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Much truth to that.   Mostly seems to be I before My except after Me.  Still, MANY really good people out there.
1308572575274954752 2020-09-23 09:03:08 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 I think it's just getting revd. up.  Won't be over until about January 15, when the ballot harvesting ends...
1308572241290960896 2020-09-23 09:01:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 When more people see we have been duped into fighting over policies and false ideas that keep us at each others' throats so as to keep us from joining ranks to kick their butts out of the cozy jobs they have.
1308571567660527617 2020-09-23 08:59:08 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman It's only money.  Keeps us and our children and grandchildren in line for YEARS....
1308570779211034624 2020-09-23 08:56:00 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I've always appreciated @larryelder for his ability to bring in facts, supported by data, to make a logical argument.  Listen to the last half of this piece...  He lays it out well....

1308557964089810944 2020-09-23 08:05:05 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is just one very small example of how the gubment takes our money, through taxation, and "shares" it around to increase their voter base.  15 Community Relations Specialists?!  Honolulu?  Why not Portland?  NY City?  Minneapolis?  Seattle?  In the name of COVID... Nice...  https://t.co/h8qNB1Y1gD

1308425242834923520 2020-09-22 23:17:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @theblaze Sayin' Alive by the Bee Gees

1308407060959297537 2020-09-22 22:05:27 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @frfrankpavone @raganbeth Good call.
1308406592107417600 2020-09-22 22:03:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> NO NO NO NO NO.  OH...
1308404291493941256 2020-09-22 21:54:26 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia Check out the 40 acres and a mule rip off from 1865 -1875.
1308402430963527685 2020-09-22 21:47:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia This is good, Felecia...  Great perspective.
1308402104982151169 2020-09-22 21:45:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> BRING it Kim!
1308401804904935424 2020-09-22 21:44:33 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @BarackObama Good reminder.  Elections have consequences.  200 judicial appointments and counting...
1308400138847543296 2020-09-22 21:37:56 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Jillie_Alexis As a Democrat I can tell you it's best to mail them in all at once, but from different towns/cities.  Works every time.
1308399135180038145 2020-09-22 21:33:57 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Stockholm syndrome on a regional/national scale!
1308398289323094016 2020-09-22 21:30:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CoachFelecia Many would do well to read that primary document called The Constitution...   a good read.
1308397924833918977 2020-09-22 21:29:08 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @it_distraction @realBenjiirby With mail in ballots, voting early and in person is Clinton code for voting early and often.
1308396961075060737 2020-09-22 21:25:19 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Pissed because he didn't do it first....  Hypocrisy abounds at these levels.  Have you ever heard CS make a statement he isn't reading?
1308395960683249664 2020-09-22 21:21:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @FURiousDEFENDER Do you realize your hatred for this man is really a hatred for more than half the country?  You drank the kool aid and can't see reality anymore.  Sad...
1308393568919146496 2020-09-22 21:11:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Why?  No ID required?  New person they don't know yet??
1308264124665618433 2020-09-22 12:37:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @BunnysDaughter Good advice.  Thank You.
1308263902015225858 2020-09-22 12:36:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @AlexBerenson @BunnysDaughter Jaw dropper!
1308261098986954754 2020-09-22 12:25:26 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LibertyLockPod Truly don‚Äôt have the words to express my gratitude for your service and sacrifices for our country.
1308256432253366272 2020-09-22 12:06:54 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @lmrupert I am so sorry to hear of this.  Thank you for sharing your pain and the warning.
1308256009744338945 2020-09-22 12:05:13 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Jazmin4201 Me: "Look" (From every politician as they start to make a point)
1308254642673840128 2020-09-22 11:59:47 +0800 <JOHNROJO> You know what is fun?  Watching the faces of the people around Status Quo Joe as he bumbles his way along.  You can see them willing him to keep it together.  Look at the woman lower right like, "OMG".  And the woman on the left...  raising her eyes to heaven like, "Please God!"
1308251685987385346 2020-09-22 11:48:02 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Beverly!  I'm surprised at you.  The Russian thing was created by the DNC and funded by the Clinton campaign.  Even the guy, Christopher Steele, who ran the story, admitted the story was not real or true.  His sub-source told him it was junk.  Let's stay honest.
1308250076712632320 2020-09-22 11:41:39 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Wonder if she ever heard about the Salem Witch Trials?  Sort of sounds the same...  scary person who might have a child some day!  Was that part of history canceled??
1308247507793637377 2020-09-22 11:31:26 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @kylegriffin1 And why the postal workers' union supports Biden...  Keep the money coming... keep it coming.  Do NOT run USPS like a business at all costs!  Literally...
1308246719642001409 2020-09-22 11:28:18 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @P8R1OT @BunnysDaughter And he gives his pay to others....  That impresses me.
1308244498497986561 2020-09-22 11:19:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Kamala...  do you support Speaker Pelosi's push for the 28th Amendment?  the "Dying Wish Amendment"...  ü§°üò≤
1308242811842490370 2020-09-22 11:12:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Survival of the USPS?  Now THIS is the epitome of public service (at the public trough).  Help yourselves!
1308237567460962304 2020-09-22 10:51:56 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @NewKangaroo @rodin42089142 @CharriseLane @221Bliss That's correct...  devastating, intentional and sustained by many vested interests... INCLUDING folks that "exist" for the good of black Americans.  Check out the organizations and people who have existed since 1964.  What impact?  Why?  Feeding at the trough??  Good gig...
1308236046883155969 2020-09-22 10:45:54 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Nothing to see here...  Move along.  Per AOC, people just need food...     Bill De Blah Blah has things under control.  https://t.co/taKnWrjtWo
1308192937038102528 2020-09-22 07:54:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HKrassenstein @rodin42089142 I think because Latino citizens appreciate being here legally and understand hard work and opportunity.  We don‚Äôt want others cutting into our wages.
1308184870439366656 2020-09-22 07:22:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @TheRealHoarse @rodin42089142 Realistic though.
1308142941781647361 2020-09-22 04:35:56 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CharriseLane @221Bliss What you describe is more about the human condition... not just black.  Black families were pretty cohesive going into the 60's.  Then came the "War on poverty".  This was intended to separate families.  It did this in a big way.  Devastated the black community.
1308126979271454720 2020-09-22 03:32:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Seriously...  something ain‚Äôt right....
1308125305802878977 2020-09-22 03:25:51 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Part of the problem is unhinged people doing/saying stupid things...  this woman listens to her bubble.  It‚Äôs called confirmation bias.  Don‚Äôt let this happen to you.
1308084796367630347 2020-09-22 00:44:53 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Tyspeakstruth @MBMasc Let me translate:  If you favor life I reject you and hate you.  I am crying mad and wish I was dead.  It‚Äôs your fault.  You are stupid.
1308078708272427010 2020-09-22 00:20:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realBenjiirby The slavery of the past DID happen.  So did the Civil War to free them.  So did the "40 acres and a mule" (taken back).  So did Jim Crowe and unmentionable atrocities.  So did Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.  So has generational wealth/economic gap.  Time to fix it!
1308054025737175040 2020-09-21 22:42:36 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @T_McKnight_21 I've seen this in my own family.  She became successful and then, went back to the destructive behaviors.  This happened several times.
1308050352231522304 2020-09-21 22:28:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @T_McKnight_21 There really is a thing about "fear of success".  People who arrive often want to go back.  Weird...
1308049720686731265 2020-09-21 22:25:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Do you have a solution for breathing while I'm in this sand??
1308049468609032193 2020-09-21 22:24:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Why are so many people refusing to see truth vs. rhetoric?
1308048217297174528 2020-09-21 22:19:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Jmood17 Wish you the best.  Have a servant's heart and become someone your employer can't do without.  You will kill it!
1308047326448033794 2020-09-21 22:15:59 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @it_distraction @jaketapper Nancy Pelosi has just announced the 28th amendment   push...   It's called the "Dying wish Amendment"üôÄ
1307897281140514819 2020-09-21 12:19:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Run, Kim, RUN!  Baltimore needs you.  Congress needs you.  We need you...
1307895501564465153 2020-09-21 12:12:41 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @sirhottest Pass the bar, THEN become lowkey elite...   Otherwise all you have is an expensive degree.
1307895014899347457 2020-09-21 12:10:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @SassyGirlBoss Now now...   no sense in disparaging so many guys and gettin' all sexist on us!  Come ON, man!  Sheesh... so much for inclusion....
1307894274676015104 2020-09-21 12:07:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Robert__Witt @BunnysDaughter Don't give up.   Better yet.... vote by mail...   If you don't get a ballot, just go to an apartment complex and "borrow" a few from the mailboxes in the lobby.  Vote early.... and often.
1307893410355847169 2020-09-21 12:04:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RetiredMaybe Looks like a Toyota?
1307891990156029953 2020-09-21 11:58:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Is that even POSSIBLE?  I mean...  the pant suit person??! Benghazi, Bleach Bit Betty?!   Michael Moore might be on to something....  https://t.co/e1JlhlukOK
1307868256582004739 2020-09-21 10:24:26 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 You strike me as someone with great intelligence...  certainly NOT ignorant.  Still, sometimes it feels better to put the head in the sand for sure...
1307867388491132930 2020-09-21 10:20:59 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Lots of stuff happening then, no?  What has changed since then in your view?
1307862980650885121 2020-09-21 10:03:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman No safety, no peace... get a piece.  Logical my dear Watson.
1307862480891162624 2020-09-21 10:01:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman posts some really good stuff.  You should check her out.  Might not fit your predetermined opinions and will certainly push you close to a paradigm shift...   üò≤    Or... just remain asleep...  Might be better for all.
1307861591711346688 2020-09-21 09:57:57 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @txchristabelle Huh?  My horses ate oat hay, but as a kid I think I called it otay.  But, I digress...  Trump does wear some nice suits.  So, I think we agree.
1307861026273030144 2020-09-21 09:55:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @chipfranklin   Have you noticed the mostly white, privileged vitriol coming from the masses that follow you?  Why is that?  (why all whiteness I mean)  Do you and your followers have a part in maintaining the status quo?  Are you part of the problem?  Unwittingly, yes.
1307859621046923266 2020-09-21 09:50:07 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Wouldn't want to disturb your deep slumber and shade from what the political elite class has done to keep black Americans under their Democrat thumbs (think Lyndon B. Johnson) as a sick way of creating the victim class they so desperately need so to remain at the public trough.
1307858109625376771 2020-09-21 09:44:06 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CheyenneDancer @chipfranklin This sounds like the thug political elite class who have had their boots on the necks of black Americans for decades.  Maybe it's time to clean things out and vote out people who have created the victim class they need...  This is Status Quo Joe's  record...  https://t.co/TNS6mxVwqw
1307854357346484226 2020-09-21 09:29:12 +0800 <JOHNROJO> #AntonScalia and #RuthBaderGinsburg had much in common.  Both great minds.  Both fought for principles and ethics and the law.  Both had great day jobs...  How about you?
1307853396796268544 2020-09-21 09:25:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @larryelder Step in line, Larry!  Do NOT wander off the Democrat political elite class plantation too far.  They have created their victim class over the years and have convinced many of their relevance as saviors.  #BeKindToTrolls
1307848818033999872 2020-09-21 09:07:11 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Caleb_TheAriFan @fernfieldflower Remember...   they like status quo also.  No waves.  Leave it alone!  'Tsall good....  Sort of like the current and historic political elite class running us as they have for many decades...  Time for someone to clean things out.... like politicians with 10+ years at the trough?
1307847734792056837 2020-09-21 09:02:53 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Shocking!  Imagine Gavin Newsom referring to a Status Quo Joe Biden presidency in terms of "earthquake"... "drop, cover and hold on"...  "tremors"    Should we be concerned?  https://t.co/8XZzzAi9oj
1307825324952965122 2020-09-21 07:33:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @brad_polumbo @rondeaulivia Weird what people choose to worship!
1307686002408828929 2020-09-20 22:20:13 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @T_McKnight_21 @ThomasSowell This sounds much like the Democrat party.  Did you quote their platform?
1307413407193157632 2020-09-20 04:17:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Hang on, Bradley!  Don‚Äôt do it!
1307413081740378112 2020-09-20 04:15:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> A NEW LOOK at an old problem.   This is good.
1307292294945452032 2020-09-19 20:15:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Oh yes we do!  Not me, just others.  Check the data!
1307292000018866177 2020-09-19 20:14:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Do we do this in OUR country?  https://t.co/fuj6GRuuZP

1307257999547707392 2020-09-19 17:59:29 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realBenjiirby A private moment...   Off her meds.?   On her meds.?   Needs meds.??  Agree with @realBenjiirby  that the cats need to steer clear...  IF she made it home...
1307184590566510592 2020-09-19 13:07:47 +0800 <JOHNROJO> The screech of @JoyBehar on @TheView is SO hard to hear!  And... why does she wear those shaded glasses?  Is it to hide to Samsonites under her eyes? Really can't stand people like this...  Her audience?  Not sure about them...  Run, Kim, Run!  @kimKBaltimore
1307160603497127937 2020-09-19 11:32:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Julius_Kim For the better?

1307158815649886208 2020-09-19 11:25:22 +0800 <JOHNROJO> First, yes, be clear...  it would do you good.  Second, what twenty something gives you these lines??  Third, didn't take you long to begin capitalizing on China....  strike that, meant RBG's death...  You sad individual...

1307142242398646273 2020-09-19 10:19:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is the first post I've seen about George Soros...  I think this guy (Soros) is someone who wants to see the United States fail.  He is not your friend...  Listen to this.  Watch the smug look on what's her face's face... says it all...
1307140073092243457 2020-09-19 10:10:53 +0800 <JOHNROJO> It will be difficult to make rape accusations stick to her...  Save THIS tweet...  üòÅ

1307104093220020225 2020-09-19 07:47:55 +0800 <JOHNROJO> RBG just passed. A legend for sure.   Watch the political elites use her death shamelessly.
1307048847848374272 2020-09-19 04:08:23 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Suzanne91749258   You came to the USA from Britain.  Why?  We were created by very brave men who put their  lives on the line to get away from British monarchs... privileged elites such as we see in both Repubs. and Dems. parties.  Trump was hired to blow this up.  It's working.
1307013073664798720 2020-09-19 01:46:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I've noticed that people who stretch the truth or outright lie a lot, blink much as they speak.  What do you notice in this video of Nancy Pelosi?   https://t.co/pqwFFztz7g

1306801477592125440 2020-09-18 11:45:26 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ChaneysPunkRock You sound and appear to be a young, somewhat wealthy, privileged punk who is absorbing someone else's struggle to make your own life seem worthwhile.  Sad really...
1306800799570251781 2020-09-18 11:42:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Redistrict Or... methamphetamine?  Just a joke now...  don't get all offended.

1306798858857398275 2020-09-18 11:35:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @PrisonPlanet She exudes the things we have come to REALLY despise about the monied, privileged elite political class.  They use whatever wind blows along, to fill their sails toward their penchant for ego filling and personal gain.  When I hear of the 40+ year "public servant"... puking now.
1306797009655848960 2020-09-18 11:27:40 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Swanson4Liberty @ZubyMusic Sort of comes down to love, no?

1306782671813644288 2020-09-18 10:30:42 +0800 <JOHNROJO> It's not a thing the does not beat people up, kill people and does not break things, does not start fires, does not yell bad things in people's faces and simply does not exist.  Like, that sort of "not a thing"?  This fellow, Ian, is on to something maybe...
1306779552333664257 2020-09-18 10:18:18 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LisaRacer2 Think about this... for real...  the hitler youth movement is happening in our schools.  Der staat uberall.   So, no....  this is just a reaction to decades of propaganda you have been fed.  Listen to Latino voters who want to RUN from the Harris Biden Bernie AOC platform!
1306777223710625798 2020-09-18 10:09:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @JoeBiden "All Americans" is defined as "those I like and agree with me... otherwise you are on your own."  Status Quo Joe...  nope.
1306776703419654144 2020-09-18 10:06:59 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @marygeorgant @ChristopherJM Sort of a "You all ain't from around here, are ya?" moment...

1306769636663336960 2020-09-18 09:38:54 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is how BADLY the elite political class in the democrat party want to keep their savior status...  they need victims and when you say "No MORE!" they react badly...

That would be the Democrat/KKK South.

Instead you want a creepy, hair sniffing, neck nuzzling, stammering old guy that can't remember his wife's name.  I see...   The daily reminder is good for you.  Sort of like...  "My arm is NOT broken.  My arm is NOT broken...."

1305974295944810496 2020-09-16 04:58:30 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @MsAvaArmstrong If we benefit from the results of slavery, we are also responsible for the effects of slavery.   The generational economic/financial effects remain.  Grace, mercy yes.  Also we do what is right.  Let the conversation begin.

The election of Abraham Lincoln was caused by a split between the Northern Democrats and the Southern Democrats, Both groups of whom strongly supported slavery.  North didn‚Äôt want to succeed.  South did.  Republicans strongly resisted slavery.

1305908632387596288 2020-09-16 00:37:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is like so many drug issues.  Criminalization only drives up prices... brings in the bad people (criminals) and puts people in jail for victimless things.  Make it legal.  Allow controls.  Allow banking (it's now all cash business) and take the criminals out of the game!
1305907815454707712 2020-09-16 00:34:20 +0800 <JOHNROJO> About that science....  We are in one of the coolest periods of earth's history!

1305904408245329921 2020-09-16 00:20:48 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Should we allow status-quo to remove Trump or allow the narcissistic fellow to continue busting up the political elite's (you and I are NOT one of them) party for awhile?  I'd like to see him continue messing up their nest...

1305903067598958592 2020-09-16 00:15:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 No.  Staying objective, he was spied on BEFORE he was elected, AFTER he was elected and is likely now.  His narcissism, displayed openly against common convention (i.e. all public elite are more "nuanced" about it) is not a reason to allow the deep state creeps to go after him.

1305176575868989442 2020-09-14 00:08:39 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Add this to the fact we are in one of earth's coldest periods in the last 250 million years.  Global warming?  We don't know warm...   Do you know what to believe?
1304810946783662082 2020-09-12 23:55:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is better a representation of the system (primarily Democrats per history) "leading" so many to their demise and still strutting around as the "savior" and "protector".  Part 2 confirms the story.  "Follow me!" they say.  "Oh!  You fell?  Let me help you!" Repeat...

1304647487144079360 2020-09-12 13:06:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WuritiUbafu The Democrat party was born pre-Civil War...  They were mostly Southerners and pro-slavery.  The Democrat party split during the 1860 election giving Abraham Lincoln, an anti-slavery guy, the election.  His move to abolish slavery got him killed.

1304594315763527682 2020-09-12 09:34:57 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realCoreyLord @Suzanne91749258 @Beverly79943415 The piece that sees clearly after much study, public speaking and now sees that people are fooled legitimately and are fooled by choice much of the time.
1304259164982644738 2020-09-11 11:23:11 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @realCoreyLord @Suzanne91749258 @Beverly79943415 And... at least??

1304233168975740928 2020-09-11 09:39:53 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Suzanne91749258 @realCoreyLord @Beverly79943415 No class system in GB?  That is certainly my impression.   In the USA it‚Äôs more about wealth and position that divides.

1304075095351021572 2020-09-10 23:11:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Just a thought...  I get triggered (sigh) when I hear someone say "We all have something to say", knowing they are also not saying "as long as you agree with me".   Bugs me hugely...

1303735584297373698 2020-09-10 00:42:40 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @HarrietMTubman We now anticipate the USPS will need another $10.6 bil. in funding to INVEST in our pensions, pay, OT and under priced product and to address congressional concerns (what concerns?!).  I ask:  "Why not let the market decide if it survives?

1303707051751686148 2020-09-09 22:49:17 +0800 <JOHNROJO> The elite political class is bragging about, get this, losing 500,000 jobs from 2008 - 2016 and gaining 500,000 jobs 2016 to present.  Sounds like a wash to me...  You?
1303580668526383104 2020-09-09 14:27:05 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @kingron_b speaks truth and power #novictims   LOVE this tweet.

The reconstruction period started out just fine...  "40 acres and a mule" and within 11 years was stomped dead... along with many newly freed slaves.  Then came WWI and WWII... no GI Bill for most black GI's..

His core beliefs are intended to keep people in their places so he can enjoy his.  No!  Huh Uh!  No more status quo.  It's killing us and the fight is ON to keep it in place.  No Mo Joe...

I love that he is busting the status quo.  Mr. Biden is, how do you say, feckless?  A wimp that acts tough... puts mouth over foot and wants status quo.  Enough...
1303510829912875010 2020-09-09 09:49:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I am one of those people who walked away from the lie... Many Dems and Repubs, alike have made sure to keep a victim class VICTIMS!

1303509560963915776 2020-09-09 09:44:32 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I'm relatively new to this Twitter thing and was just blocked by @Lori_IslandGirl for an unknown reason.  Might be because I speak informed truth?  Not sure.  I have not blocked her because I might learn something... unless her tweets become obviously racist or plain thoughtless.

1303434438626414597 2020-09-09 04:46:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Saahearn @fernfieldflower It will get TONS of coverage with no help.  First of its kind that I know of.

I spent three years studying this, starting with me challenging the idea of white privilege.  How can I better plug in to this conversation?

1303180499465072640 2020-09-08 11:56:57 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LibertyLockPod Key word "nearly".  How many are we getting out of now?  Like your sentiment though.

1302813812530098176 2020-09-07 11:39:52 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @First_a_dad Let us know how she is doing?  How are you doing?

1302639587785764865 2020-09-07 00:07:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 To love.  To show grace. To forgive. To do what is right.
1302631723495161857 2020-09-06 23:36:19 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Since BEFORE Lincoln was president.  Many good men and women put their lives on the line and died to stop slavery.  My ancestors were among those.  Lincoln was elected because of a split in the Democrat party, giving him the win.  Powerful people didn't like this... still don't.
1302628898425860097 2020-09-06 23:25:05 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Good call @raganbeth
1302626759611834371 2020-09-06 23:16:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Grace.  Forgiveness.  Atonement.  We fix it.

1302625031839596544 2020-09-06 23:09:43 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @Beverly79943415 Please don't let the lies of the last 47+ years keep you voting for the same results.  You still have much to lose by keeping the same, tired people in place who keep you under the thumb, which makes THEM relevant and your savior.  Keep in mind... they need a victim...
1302624247500566529 2020-09-06 23:06:36 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WuritiUbafu Dig a little deeper.  Goodness is to evil as hot is to cold.  Coldness is the absence of heat.  Evil is the absence of good.  Curse is the absence of blessing.  Evil is not a thing of its own... rather it is the absence of what God has created and...  it is good.
1302620324677074947 2020-09-06 22:51:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> It's really hard to prove something that didn't happen... you know what I mean?
1302619177866338305 2020-09-06 22:46:28 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @RBReich The facts don't support your narrative.  This looks like another "Russia, Russia, Russia" claim.  Let's spend another 3 years and $30,000,000 trying to find the crime... shall we?
1302618158348472320 2020-09-06 22:42:25 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Much of what I'm seeing looks like the reaction of a woman whose mate beats her and she sympathises with him.  A Stockholm syndrome thing.  As BLM/Antifa merge... people begin to embody their anger/behavior.  The beatings will continue until morale improves!
1302615243495862273 2020-09-06 22:30:50 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @michaelboykin1 You know...  sort of the same thing that is happening in Portland, NY City, Minneapolis, Kenosha... other cities, except the other way around.  Different victims and fewer deaths, but the same evil.
1302614300683501569 2020-09-06 22:27:05 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @jsolomonReports Probably because her twangy, nasal screeching caused a hostile workplace for the USPS workers??  It's an OSHA thing...

1302609938728906752 2020-09-06 22:09:45 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @raganbeth To see the other 98% of the country that isn't burning it's businesses?  Sounds....     so normal....
1302609186895704064 2020-09-06 22:06:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Father an adolescent psychologist... teaches at Columbia... Do you really need to ask what's wrong??
1302486727592783872 2020-09-06 14:00:09 +0800 <JOHNROJO> And vote often...   DNC guidelines...

1302483241853624320 2020-09-06 13:46:18 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ConceptualJames @BunnysDaughter Huh?  It's also much easier to blame farmers when your mouth is full...  real easy.
1302480903646580737 2020-09-06 13:37:01 +0800 <JOHNROJO> This is just so obvious until you swallow the kool aid...  I just don't see Jimmy Carter and Jim Baker liking kool aid...
1302478081194516480 2020-09-06 13:25:48 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Poor Bill...   Hillary was scorned by the voters in 2016 and she won't let it go...   Poor Bill...

1302457446166798336 2020-09-06 12:03:48 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WuritiUbafu The Bible does NOT say God created evil.  He might allow evil, but doesn't create it.  Evil, and all forms it takes, is a rejection of God.  Can God reject Himself?  No...

1302078452196020225 2020-09-05 10:57:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @ghunterit It is not wasted!  Just vote a couple more times...  This is the DNC recommendation.

1301907555610886144 2020-09-04 23:38:44 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Such is the state of affairs (not the Bill Clinton kind)...  Can‚Äôt ask for happy people?  Wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt unhappy people would we?  Why not?  They are already unhappy!  https://t.co/3rCls7G2PS

1301673226771152896 2020-09-04 08:07:35 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @CasarezKk It's just you.  Do you find yourself filled with anger?  Anger kills one's soul.  Maybe a counselor?
1301672718132150272 2020-09-04 08:05:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @AggieTheBarkeep Now THAT'S what I call a TWEET!   Thank You!  Love this...

1301671763416240128 2020-09-04 08:01:46 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LeonaLioness6 You appear to be very angry.  Would you like to see a counselor?  Anger is the cause of many medial issues.  I offer this only because I care.
1301670201574875136 2020-09-04 07:55:34 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @raganbeth These are actually really good questions, you cynical person you.   This is similar to seeing so many positive covid tests because you go out and look for them.
1301669790700855296 2020-09-04 07:53:56 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LeonaLioness6 Yah, but have you seen Trump's hair?!  She really NEEDED the cut and blow out...   Come on, man!  Have a heart!
1301669344590536705 2020-09-04 07:52:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> I see Joe Biden is headed to Kenosha, follwing D. Trump's visit.  Then, after D. Trump leaves PA, Mr. Biden will go there.  Notice who is leading here??
1301602406656958464 2020-09-04 03:26:11 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @sdr_medco Really sorry to hear of this.  My daughter's close friend lost her husband to the virus...  Brings it close to home.  So sorry to hear of your friend's loss.
1301601902832967681 2020-09-04 03:24:10 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LaurieRosenbau3 Might be just you...   Hate is so strong and has no end, to the point it will kill you spiritually, emotionally and physically.  How are you feeling?
1301601163188477952 2020-09-04 03:21:14 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @LeonaLioness6 No. You got it wrong.  He said something like, "Vote early and often."   Or, was that the DNC?  Not really sure...

1301600255754944512 2020-09-04 03:17:38 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WuritiUbafu Such a funny expression, no?  I mean... picture literally pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.  Would be like pushing yourself down by your hat.

1301277171982372864 2020-09-03 05:53:49 +0800 <JOHNROJO> Did you hear Joe Biden just say the fellow who was shot by some low life in Portland incited his own murder?  This classic blaming the victim.  Another gaffe, Joe?

Right now, the government has BM and BW by the necks...   Can't afford to get a job...  LBJ and the congress at the time, made sure of this.

They have hijacked many "movements" and are the new face of fascism in the name of anti-fascism.  Now sending followers around the country doing the same.  Funded by???

I've done the work of learning this.  It's time for serious conversation about what our government has done to leave black people behind.  Grace.  Mercy.  Fix it.

My experience might have been similar.  I recall not thinking "they" were different.  I didn't learn about racism until I experienced it in college.  THEN I learned about "them".

Do the study.  Murdered... caged... beaten...  Why are they still a viable group and prosperous?  Why is the outcome different in the black USA community?

1300968449158467584 2020-09-02 09:27:03 +0800 <JOHNROJO> @WuritiUbafu I would love to speak about this issue as a white man.  You would be shocked to hear I agree with reparations of some form.  The devil is in the details.  I have some stories.
