1301625421600038917 2020-09-04 04:57:38 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 Protesters and antifa are different, One are protesting in something they believe in, while antifa silences anybody who disagrees with them, They have attacked multiple people on multiple occasions and are attacking citys like Minneapolis and Portland

1301623545202708484 2020-09-04 04:50:10 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 Once again back to the point he was defending his city from antifa thugs, and people were running after Rittenhouse before he defended him self.
1301622084825681920 2020-09-04 04:44:22 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @MattRagusa4 @dealinjur2 @moxie_mo24 Why did you bring race in to this, this has nothing to do with race?
1301621922325827587 2020-09-04 04:43:43 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 He had the gun to defend him self from the very people who were running after him with a gun
1301621743300284416 2020-09-04 04:43:01 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 This goes back to the argument that he was defending a place that he regularly visits, because he didint want to see his city destroyed by antifa
1301620951625478149 2020-09-04 04:39:52 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 Are you denying that he heard a loud ass gunshot?
1301620877788934146 2020-09-04 04:39:34 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 Imagine for a second your Rittenhouse, If someone is running after you, and you hear a gun shot, you turn around and Rosenbaum is running after you, what are you supposed to do?
1301620438070693896 2020-09-04 04:37:50 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 Rosenbaum was chasing Rittenhouse, he was not just a lone bystander, I never said Rittenhouse was a hero, Im explaining why he shot Rosenbaum.
1301619098162475009 2020-09-04 04:32:30 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @MattRagusa4 @dealinjur2 @moxie_mo24 By the way, the reason Kyle was shot is because Rosenbaum heard a gun shot fired from behind him and assumed it was Rosenbaum.  https://t.co/czh9XD9z9M
1301616793568587779 2020-09-04 04:23:21 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @MattRagusa4 @dealinjur2 @moxie_mo24 self defense is different :/
1301616589809364993 2020-09-04 04:22:32 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 The reason why he had a gun is because other people had guns to, one of the guys he shot was pictured with a gun in his hand. He was defending the city because he didint want to see his city destroyed by terrorists like antifa.  https://t.co/YQb3INCi0r
1301616003126906882 2020-09-04 04:20:12 +0800 <The_GhostGunner> @dealinjur2 @MattRagusa4 @moxie_mo24 drove a hour away. Acorrding to Arizona DOC, Joseph Rosenbaum had 2 counts of sexual conduct with a minor one being 2 years old and the other being 10.  https://t.co/bOK3unwEcu

He was not "looking to shoot someone" he was 20 minutes away, He was there to defend from the antifa rioters from burning the city to the ground, From what i have gathered he had a job there, to say he was crossing state lines is to correct, but it makes it sound like he
