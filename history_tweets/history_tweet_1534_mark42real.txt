1308757939461685248 2020-09-23 21:19:42 +0800 <mark42real> @Not_listening66 @Fairy_Woodland Unfortunately these lefties  get themselves into positions of  power were they can spoil it for everyone else they then move on leaving the good folk with a mess. Hence no more NT.
1308682876725100544 2020-09-23 16:21:26 +0800 <mark42real> @Fairy_Woodland A deluded few will try to appease this blm shit but the NT is a great organisation and membership is worth while. They`ve preserved a lot of green Britain from greedy developers. Don't cancel.

You can do a lot of damage in four years.  We need to get a different breed of politician altogether. As  Farage said "they`ve never had a proper  job"

1306605672289763328 2020-09-17 22:47:22 +0800 <mark42real> @Carti_Mandua @pritipatel you think it`s normal then? Could we have your view on why the French escort them into British waters and the British coastguard pick them up and a hotel is waiting to accommodate them.
1306502724427698177 2020-09-17 15:58:17 +0800 <mark42real> @Carti_Mandua @pritipatel I`ll say it again it`s part of a secret Anglo French agreement.

1306500528004894722 2020-09-17 15:49:34 +0800 <mark42real> I`d like to get up one morning and not turn the tele on to see overplayed diversity. I saw a bed ad with two lesbians one black one white. They seem to head hunt every gender, race, fat, tall, short you name it they`ll find it for the sake of diversity.

1302956334275584001 2020-09-07 21:06:12 +0800 <mark42real> @Lava_Louisa All people welcoming them in should be tried for being an accessory to murder.

No said the woman. so he rows further round the coast and asks a bloke have your women been raped or have you been stabbed. No said the bloke. I wonder where the lads are said the migrant.
