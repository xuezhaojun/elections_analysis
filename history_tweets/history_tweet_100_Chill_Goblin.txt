And also another way I could shield my face from the sun would be to always wear Mexican sugar skull makeup

1343764102984949766 2020-12-29 11:41:42 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Schools should accommodate all types of learners. Some people learn by working with their hands. Some people are visual learners. Some people take in information best when it's delivered to them by their own brain as an earth-shaking epiphany while peaking on magic mushrooms.

1337116481381937153 2020-12-11 03:26:26 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @Johntheduncan Great job, you motivated and productive piss boy!
1337104360656998402 2020-12-11 02:38:16 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Caffeine pills are great because if I wake up but am still too tired to get out of bed I just take a caffeine pill and bam! Now I also have a headache
1337096262559162368 2020-12-11 02:06:05 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "Omg we got the results back and this current fetus has a lil pussy! That means we have to decorate their nursery in pink, with unicorns wearing makeup and pretty princesses who love shopping and cute fairies who will talk shit about you behind your back"
1337096261854523394 2020-12-11 02:06:05 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> It's like palm reading but with infant dicks &amp; pussies
1337096259476271104 2020-12-11 02:06:04 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> The concept of gender being tied to sex has everybody like "according to your new baby's genitals, when they grow up they're going to drink beer, watch sports, and be very bad at discussing emotions"
1337089807789518851 2020-12-11 01:40:26 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @EmericanJohnson "My world has always been on fire, remember the Smash Mouth song?"
1336917104088453121 2020-12-10 14:14:10 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Jeff Bezos donated HOW MUCH of his wealth to charity?! Wild because I actually donate the EXACT SAME PROPORTION of my total amount of fucks to give to people defending billionaires on the internet

1336720623247224833 2020-12-10 01:13:26 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @Carlito13887738 Honestly I kinda get it. The masks kinda suck, staying inside SUCKS, and it is hard to trust the government. There will have to be a way to address people in this category when the vaccine rolls out.

1335879820161454081 2020-12-07 17:32:23 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Why do the high school students and the high school teachers and the parents in Queen's Gambit all look like they're 25
1335844957433815040 2020-12-07 15:13:51 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @JaacTree You're right! We must stop this democratically elected authoritarian from holding more democratic authoritarian elections #StopTheCount

1335714092762460163 2020-12-07 06:33:50 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @CamazotzA Oh this was on the floor? Let me dust it off on someone‚Äôs ass real quick
1335712758868881409 2020-12-07 06:28:32 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> On my way to become a gamer! Watching all the Joker movies to prepare
1335687381333258245 2020-12-07 04:47:42 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I think ‚Äúpunching down‚Äù is actually okay to do in comedy, but the threshold for joke quality is much higher.  This bit isn‚Äôt nearly funny enough to justify a rich ‚Äúhumorist‚Äùpunching down at service workers.
1335684857796628481 2020-12-07 04:37:40 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I feel like there‚Äôs an assumption that once the vaccine rolls out this will all be over with, but I have a feeling there are more people out there than we‚Äôd expect who aren‚Äôt going to get it. I dunno what the solution here is but I want to have that conversation
1335684856047669249 2020-12-07 04:37:40 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> ...along with people who can‚Äôt get vaccinated for health reasons, who rely on everyone else being vaccinated for the herd immunity.
1335684853417828352 2020-12-07 04:37:39 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> But not every workplace has the same restrictions, that‚Äôs why some people are able to get face tattoos without ruining their life. There are going to be a lot of people who refuse to get vaccinated, refuse to get their kids vaccinated...
1335684851400314880 2020-12-07 04:37:39 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I can anticipate film sets in a post vaccine world mandating that you have a vaccine in order to work, and I‚Äôm skeptical that these guys would turn down work because they don‚Äôt believe in the COVID vaccine.
1335684849559101440 2020-12-07 04:37:38 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> We were all working on a movie set, and we‚Äôd all had to take two COVID tests leading up to the shoot and an additional one on the day of the shoot. These guys had done those three tests no problem because it was necessary for their income
1335684846073630722 2020-12-07 04:37:37 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> ...that made sense at all. I had a pretty respectful conversation with them, acknowledged where I agreed (government is bad) and where I disagreed (COVID vaccine will morph us into robots). Eventually pivoted to talking about Jeffrey Epstein and we were mostly on the same page
1335684844240719875 2020-12-07 04:37:37 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> One guy said ‚ÄúYou know what COVID-19 stands for right? Certificate Of Visual IDentification - and 19 stands for A.I.: artificial intelligence. When they give you the vaccine, it will actually change your DNA so you‚Äôre no longer human.‚Äù Other guy just nodded in agreement as if...
1335684841883439104 2020-12-07 04:37:36 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Talked to a couple people recently about the COVID vaccine and both of them said they wouldn‚Äôt take it when it comes out. I feel like we‚Äôre not talking about this as much as we should be. They were worried the vaccine would include a microchip, or be otherwise harmful
1335345203201400833 2020-12-06 06:08:00 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @marysuewriter I think I‚Äôve been there, there‚Äôs also a bunch of animatronic captain Jack Sparrows right?
1335344788053352453 2020-12-06 06:06:21 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> ‚ÄúI want humans to start a colony along the equator of Mars.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh yeah? Well I want humans to start a colony midway between the equator and the pole of Mars!‚Äù  ‚ÄúUgh you‚Äôre so ignorant! Obviously we can‚Äôt work together on developing Earth-Mars travel‚Äù  -how leftist infighting be
1335324403878531072 2020-12-06 04:45:21 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @RealTimBlack Wait, that didn't even make sense in context. If he and Barack had a disagreement he would develop some disease and have to resign...? Why would that be part of that sentence? Is Biden's brain just melting again?
1335271270120873984 2020-12-06 01:14:13 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Yeah, I'm an in-cel... INcredibly CELebratory!!! Today I'm celebrating another year of being an angry virgin
1335158492202749953 2020-12-05 17:46:05 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> If you don't get into specifics at all I agree with many of Trump's broad points:  -Obama bad -CNN sux -America not currently great -ew, NAFTA -Big trucks are fun -Sad!

1334572519119052801 2020-12-04 02:57:38 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Spotify pinpointed the exact time of year I was dumped &amp; in my feelings and made a fun little video about it  If you listen to Rezcoast Grizz that many times in a row they should send someone to check on you  https://t.co/tNLH0DlNQi

As a stand up comedian I‚Äôve never had an audience in the palm of my hand like this, and this is on FOX NEWS!   https://t.co/X32Afdfqf9
1324766833120022528 2020-11-07 01:33:20 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Why was Biden more electable? Because he could appeal to republicans who didn‚Äôt like Trump. Throughout his campaign, he distanced himself from progressive ideas, punched left, invited actual republicans to the DNC, and talked about having a cabinet with republicans in it.
1324766830154702849 2020-11-07 01:33:19 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> And while Medicare for All was the most popular policy choice, beating Donald Trump was more important to democrats and independents. So the message from the MSM, that Biden was more ‚Äúelectable,‚Äù ended up beating Bernie Sanders even though more people wanted Bernie‚Äôs policies  https://t.co/DycmSI1m3s
1324766813482307585 2020-11-07 01:33:15 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Mainstream media like CNN, MSNBC, NYT and Washington Post absolutely hated Bernie and did the best they could to portray him as ‚Äúradical‚Äù while making sure people understood that Biden was by far the most ‚Äúelectable‚Äù candidate. Voters seemed to believe this.
1324766810558894080 2020-11-07 01:33:15 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> In order to make up for Bernie‚Äôs incredibly successful grassroots funding, other candidates had to accept large $ donations from billionaires and PACs and lobbying groups. Here‚Äôs a list from Forbes of how many billionaire funders the remaining candidates in January 2020 each had:  https://t.co/O7S0Ep7KKR
1324766793009909762 2020-11-07 01:33:11 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Here‚Äôs a map of individual campaign donations during the democratic primary. Bernie raised by far the most of any candidate from small dollar donations, averaging around $20 each (mostly from Amazon workers, Walmart employees, and teachers). Check out Biden‚Äôs support in yellow:  https://t.co/cp8C4mlYKp
1324766785762152448 2020-11-07 01:33:09 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I think there‚Äôs a very good case to be made for Bernie winning, and even winning more than Biden. Biden‚Äôs victory probably wasn‚Äôt a result of his policies (which he barely pushed) but as a way to ‚Äúget Trump out.‚Äù Thing is, a Bernie vote would have also have that effect.
1324766782507360259 2020-11-07 01:33:08 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Are you annoyed by all the people posting ‚ÄúBernie would have won‚Äù or ‚ÄúBernie would have gotten more electoral votes‚Äù opinions online right now? I get that. There‚Äôs no way to know for sure which way things would have gone in another universe. But to speculate a bit...

1320147179923755008 2020-10-25 07:36:29 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> From "Who Is America" the interview with Bernie Sanders stands out too. Bernie didn't agree with the horrible things SBC said, but he didn't get frustrated and argue with him either. Not as funny as the clips of people destroying their credibility/career but still interesting
1320147178363518978 2020-10-25 07:36:29 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Even the right wing qanon boogaloo guys he stays with, despite having some horrifying beliefs (wishing they could shoot democrats lol) come off as fundamentally human in their willingness to help a stranger in need during a pandemic.

1319462802583654400 2020-10-23 10:17:01 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Biden's like "nobody should go to jail for a drug problem, they should go to rehab and be treated compassionately" but the moderator cut him off before he could finish "if he's my son tho, obviously if he's not my son he should go to jail forever" #PresidentialDebate2020
1319461835930767360 2020-10-23 10:13:10 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @JoeBiden BOOOOOO
1319460746925846529 2020-10-23 10:08:51 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> WOW did you see Trump almost say a racial slur and pivot at the last minute to "people with a low IQ" #PresidentialDebate2020
1319459680205312002 2020-10-23 10:04:36 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Trump WISHES he could take full credit for the racist concentration camps but he gives credit to Obama. Very big of him #PresidentialDebate2020
1319459461380046854 2020-10-23 10:03:44 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Biden: Anything below $15 minimum wage puts you below the poverty level [also a good deal above $15 puts you there too] #PresidentialDebate2020
1319458807718858755 2020-10-23 10:01:08 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> @JoeBiden STOP TWEETING, CONCENTRATE ON THE DEBATE!!!!!
1319458377882361858 2020-10-23 09:59:26 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "He's not even from Scranton, he lived there for a very short time, he doesn't even watch The Office, this guy. What's your favourite season, Joe? He probably likes the ones after Michael left, isn't that right? Andy was his favourite boss. Terrible." - Donald Trump

1319457011067719681 2020-10-23 09:54:00 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Trump is right, Kamala IS more liberal than Bernie Sanders #PresidentialDebate2020
1319456650747613185 2020-10-23 09:52:34 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Good question!
1319456102598254592 2020-10-23 09:50:23 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "People out there love their healthcare! If you tried to give them that same exact health care for free, they'd hate that!" #PresidentialDebate2020
1319455174000283648 2020-10-23 09:46:42 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> This is actually a good debate though. They should all be like this - no audience, muting mics. Make em boring so only the nerds watch #Debates2020
1319454486591660032 2020-10-23 09:43:58 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Please don't talk about Trump's friendly relationship with north Korea like it's a bad thing #PresidentialDebate2020
1319454242923565057 2020-10-23 09:43:00 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Joe Biden said "Malarky"!!! Lot of people just won their presidential debate bingo game #Debates2020
1319453647323959296 2020-10-23 09:40:38 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Trump talking about Biden's family profiting off his political position. At least it's covid safe to have Trump debating from inside a glass house #PresidentialDebate2020
1319453097979236357 2020-10-23 09:38:27 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Oh God I would love this
1319452391503237121 2020-10-23 09:35:39 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Why tf would Biden say something as absolute as "I have never taken money from a foreign country"?!?! May as well say "Never once has a child of mine fallen asleep with a meth pipe in his mouth"  #Debates2020
1319451196780908547 2020-10-23 09:30:54 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> LOL they're literally arguing over who is the better global terrorist right now I can't #Debates2020
1319450889300660225 2020-10-23 09:29:40 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Glad Biden promised to be more hawkish and militaristic to Russia, Iran and China than Trump has been, was worried we might go the other direction #Debates2020
1319450077635710977 2020-10-23 09:26:27 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> You're really dumb huh?
1319449916981260289 2020-10-23 09:25:49 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I'm just assuming Trump is talking 100% of the time the camera isn't on him #PresidentialDebate2020
1319449275189919745 2020-10-23 09:23:16 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Trump: *says something crazy* Biden: This guy wants to *repeats crazy thing*... Come on!  #Debates2020
1319448555938062338 2020-10-23 09:20:24 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "Democrats, democrats all!"  Trump talks about democrats like they're witches or something  #PresidentialDebate2020
1319448390334353412 2020-10-23 09:19:45 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Biden promising to "shut down the virus, not the country"...  "As president I will pass an executive order that if you are a virus???? You go straight to jail, Jack!"  #PresidentialDebate2020
1319447882135719937 2020-10-23 09:17:43 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "We're learning to live with it"  "No... We're learning to die with it!"  BIDEN with the heckler response! He kind of rambled into nothing after that but I liked the moment, Kudos to Biden/the staffer in his ear  #Debates2020
1319446941999181824 2020-10-23 09:13:59 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> "As soon as I heard about covid I sprung into action by using it to justify racist policies!" #Debates2020
1319446463173230592 2020-10-23 09:12:05 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> If this were an episode of game of thrones it would be "Battle of the Drugged-Up Old Rapists" #Debates2020

1318638117230940161 2020-10-21 03:40:00 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Donald Trump didn't kill 200 000 people, Covid did.  Death toll WOULD be lower if:  1) Trump didn't downplay the virus/ discourage masks 2) Your country had free health care (Hillary/Biden are STILL AGAINST THIS) 3) Monthly stimulus checks so people aren't forced to go to work

1318057184127799296 2020-10-19 13:11:35 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> God A√±ez and her crew suck so hard at pulling off a coup. You're not supposed to just let the people vote you out of power! Look at how the US republicans do it! Absolute idiots. #BoliviaRecuperaSuDemocracia

1313592161032642564 2020-10-07 05:29:11 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> This is a bad way to play monopoly and a worse way to have a society! Let's clear the board already
1313591852545830914 2020-10-07 05:27:57 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> And the banker is definitely taking bills from the reserve when nobody's looking (this part is pretty much the same as regukar monopoly)
1313591498244489221 2020-10-07 05:26:33 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> And when you die your kid continues the game with your little metal shoe or whatever. And if you're black there are more "go to jail" chance cards.
1313590795866382337 2020-10-07 05:23:45 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> Capitalism is like if every time you played monopoly you set up the board the way the game finished last time and everyone kept saying "we all have an equal chance here!"
1313311706676973569 2020-10-06 10:54:45 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> The good news is that Trump's poll numbers are WAY UP with sweaty guys who cover up their zombie bites and tell the rest of the group they're "fine"
1313214985175289859 2020-10-06 04:30:25 +0800 <Chill_Goblin> I hope all you libs who wished him a speedy recovery from the virus feel like real dipshits right now
