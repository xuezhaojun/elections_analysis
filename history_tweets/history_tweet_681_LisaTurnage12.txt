1344003926765539329 2020-12-30 03:34:41 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @JesseKellyDC Mitch seems to be putting up resistance when it comes to us getting relief. Almost done with the GOP. 🙄
1344000713999994886 2020-12-30 03:21:55 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @PincheMeelo @realDonaldTrump I know some people don't need stimulus, but a lot of us DO...because of the Gov't. Mitch doing this isnt gonna go over well. He better rethink.
1343999186279297032 2020-12-30 03:15:50 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @realDonaldTrump Mitch has fcked up! He will lose the senate.

1343984277265010689 2020-12-30 02:16:36 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @stclairashley Mitch is fking up his chances of keeping the senate.
1343983792135016449 2020-12-30 02:14:40 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @KLoeffler Honestly...if he does this..he deserves to lose the senate.
1343983294908690435 2020-12-30 02:12:42 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @KLoeffler MITCH is gonna mess you up, @KLoeffler. You better get in his ear, people are pissed. Why is he knocking down $2,000?
1343982801692065794 2020-12-30 02:10:44 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @JackPosobiec MITCH just might lose GA. He better stop messing around with us.

1302615070208331776 2020-09-06 22:30:08 +0800 <LisaTurnage12> @JoeBiden No thanks, Joe. Not interested in a nationwide mask mandate while your voters are out every night protesting by the thousands, rioting, and burning down cities. I'm most certainly tired of the double standard when my family just wants to work and go to church.
