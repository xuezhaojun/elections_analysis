1318356612306915330 2020-10-20 09:01:24 +0800 <julianna4307> @beforetheylost That's mold. You technically can scrape it off &amp; spray the powder with alcohol, it'll kill anything left on it. There's tutorials on how to sanitize makeup.  However... I wouldn't recommend it.

Cutting them off &amp; switch schools, bringing them home only works if you pay very close attention &amp; do it the SECOND they start w/ propaganda.

We don't hide, assuming otherwise when we've both been clear is pretty on par for you; following logical steps to a factual conclusion apparently isn't your strong suit.

1309296112868691968 2020-09-25 08:58:13 +0800 <julianna4307> @Jewey0000 Bc their thug behavior is excused &amp; coddled, bc the left has convinced them they're victims, &amp; most are too lazy to do anything about it? The only reason you could argue needing more support, is race realism re: IQ

You don't like it, don't break laws, its that simple.   Also, wouldn't be the first time a law forgot something &amp; was amended.

Kinda has everything to do with the punishment, hence that's why they're called "restitution". They should be done with their jail sentence, yes? Fines are part of the sentence, too, &amp; should also be complete.
1309116144717115393 2020-09-24 21:03:05 +0800 <julianna4307> @HarryLaneGroup @Pentagear @NBCNews And I'm pretty sure that even tho my opinions are based in reality/numbers/video/gov stats/etc, I'm just wrong bc its the corporate way to think so, &amp; even tho the groups burning everything down have no actual proven points, he agrees w/ them bc that's what commercials &amp; AOC say.
1309115253419057152 2020-09-24 20:59:33 +0800 <julianna4307> @HarryLaneGroup @Pentagear @NBCNews Its funny, bc u KNOW this dude would have no problem agreeing with points of BLM rioters &amp; MAP netflix watchers. Despite 90+% of interracial crime being black on white, he doesn't label that. That interracial rape is 99% black on white, he doesn't label that.
1309114012186095620 2020-09-24 20:54:37 +0800 <julianna4307> @Pentagear You're either not smart enough nor tough enough to face those hard truths, &amp; instead hate me. That's fine, truly. Foolish &amp; childish, but fine.   I just refuse to live in a degenerate society where free speech is violence, but crime &amp; killing babies is OK. That makes me bad?
1309112995956523011 2020-09-24 20:50:35 +0800 <julianna4307> @Pentagear Literally nothing?  I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain things, when you can't even accept crime statistics &amp; the lack of racist cops. Getting you to understand the shilling of the media/Hollywood, &amp; all the ills of society being easily traced back to certain folks..

They didn't "tack them on", they were already there; they just said they need to be paid first since, as we've established, its part of your restitution.

1308176647833747456 2020-09-22 06:49:52 +0800 <julianna4307> @Harley__88 What a homey song, if that makes sense lol. This is my back patio song. Her voice is so clear &amp; sweet  https://t.co/RK6sfIq5Fp i hope you like it, too
1308173455330873344 2020-09-22 06:37:11 +0800 <julianna4307> @anglodiaspora @xuriousmusic I love the whole vaporwave/80s dystopian edm movement! As a child from the 80s, its comforting and new all at once.
1308173079881936903 2020-09-22 06:35:41 +0800 <julianna4307> @mojogringo I've never heard of him, thanks for the referral, fren!!
1308172724360052742 2020-09-22 06:34:16 +0800 <julianna4307> @mhdksafa Esp when I see it said that white genocide is a hysterical lie... &amp; the same media/person then say its a good thing &amp; we deserve it.  We've done more for western civ/the world than any other race, even as its minority.  https://t.co/5J5qMZXiR2 u need us, we don't need you.
1308172212818653184 2020-09-22 06:32:14 +0800 <julianna4307> @mhdksafa Isn't- isn't that the whole narrative of the left? Reminds me of a tweet I saw; guy is English, pro-open borders. He's asked if for Israel, too. He says "no, that would erase the Jewish population". Bruh. Every race has the right to defend itself from extinction.
1308171481520762880 2020-09-22 06:29:20 +0800 <julianna4307> @A_Dixie_Girl Seems I'm the only one, after skimming the replies üò¢

1308170558689902594 2020-09-22 06:25:40 +0800 <julianna4307> I'm curious, what do my frens listen to? What kind of music, which bands? Personally, I like everything from pantera to m83 to lana del rey. Its hard when some artists leftist out, but I separate the person from the art, &amp; just illegally download it lol.
1308170023781969921 2020-09-22 06:23:32 +0800 <julianna4307> @LadyIld Media people too. Usually, they're both lol. Traitors are a close second.

1308168761388789760 2020-09-22 06:18:31 +0800 <julianna4307> @HarmlessYardDog I always thought the "whites can't cook" trope so bizarre. French, Italian, Mediterranean, German, dutch, etc food? Some of those are considered the world's finest cuisines!! Adding Adobo to everything doesn't make it good lol.
1308167996926496768 2020-09-22 06:15:29 +0800 <julianna4307> @apostolaich Ah. My mom was, too, Irish catholic. She became dutch Christian reformed (Protestant) to marry my father. That's really all I know.
1308167705959247874 2020-09-22 06:14:20 +0800 <julianna4307> @0_Lumiere_0 Yes lol! I'm half Dutch, &amp; they're the tallest people in the world!

1308166978230775808 2020-09-22 06:11:26 +0800 <julianna4307> @petitwindchime @imnotatroll13 @hotchipliar "They don't know how". Really? Insinuating their so fucking stupid &amp; unaware that they don't know about tipping is just as, if not more so, insulting as telling the truth: they're cheap asf.

Sometimes I wondered at the veracity of their "well geez don't spend that whole quarter in one place" attitude lol. Or, single old people that drink one coffee &amp; sit I'm prime table space for HOURS.
1308165824088338433 2020-09-22 06:06:51 +0800 <julianna4307> @petitwindchime @hotchipliar What I've seen, in my own years, was servers getting frustrated/irritated at the attitudes they would, for the vast majority, receive from black tables. No server is just rude, we're well aware being kind &amp; attentive gets tips.
1308165036091809793 2020-09-22 06:03:43 +0800 <julianna4307> @petitwindchime @Ostara_88 @hotchipliar Trying to understand you using excuses of shit that never happened to you? So, bc you could legally beat your wife at one point, I can now be rude, selfish, &amp; refuse polite social norms? How long are you all going to keep beating these dead horses lmfao??
1308164230554816515 2020-09-22 06:00:31 +0800 <julianna4307> @stealingjobs @wptawp How is she wrong? What grammatical or spelling mistake did she make?
1308163914287460352 2020-09-22 05:59:16 +0800 <julianna4307> @hotchipliar Also, I had maybe 4 eat-and-runs, &amp; they were all young black people. Often, they complain to try &amp; lower the bill... After eating most/all of their plate.
1308163613119721478 2020-09-22 05:58:04 +0800 <julianna4307> @HungJohnson888 @hotchipliar Its well known in the industry. The few dine-and-dashers i had were black, too.
1308163331212148744 2020-09-22 05:56:57 +0800 <julianna4307> @hotchipliar Funny, I bartended &amp; waitressed all thru college, &amp; white families tip wonderfully. Certain foreigners pretend to not know about tipping &amp; won't, &amp; black people tip low (if at all), &amp; Hispanics tip either really high or low, no in between, &amp; Asians tip exactly 15% - to the penny.
1308161967845265415 2020-09-22 05:51:32 +0800 <julianna4307> @GHOST_LETTERS The fat, bald guy??

1308160630487240706 2020-09-22 05:46:13 +0800 <julianna4307> @apostolaich I'm not sure which prophet &amp; patriarchs you mean...
1308160544877273090 2020-09-22 05:45:53 +0800 <julianna4307> @apostolaich Yes, very simplified. But he did dismantle the old testament in many ways, &amp; impressed upon them that heaven isn't reached by works, that loving thine brother is most important, etc.
1308160004202131456 2020-09-22 05:43:44 +0800 <julianna4307> @DeprivedGamer Lmao Ooooooh "racist"! You got me!!  https://t.co/7p4kHKgsCk
1308159691487412228 2020-09-22 05:42:29 +0800 <julianna4307> @apostolaich Also, this:  https://t.co/yMEI6b9VZO notice the guy who blames all white women for mudshark actions. Kinda like what feminists do to men, what BLM does for whites, what (((they))) do with everyone. I'm blocked now üòÇ
1308158830329696256 2020-09-22 05:39:04 +0800 <julianna4307> @apostolaich I've been told that Christians worship and are slaves to Jews bc Christ was born a jew. Even tho his entire being was to, you know, end the bs that is judiasm, that didn't matter.
1308157491788775425 2020-09-22 05:33:45 +0800 <julianna4307> @TimKennedyMMA @BAWood9 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden I'm interested in what both have to say, but trusting Biden to not get the ?s ahead &amp; getting a competent AND unbiased moderator is nigh impossible. I'm just as interested in seeing Biden last for longer than 20 min, too; it needs to be at least 2 hours long.
1308157063613353984 2020-09-22 05:32:03 +0800 <julianna4307> @VoteAndy @TimKennedyMMA @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Plus, he's sold out, big time. Albeit for 100mil, which 99% of the population would as well, but in doing so he's lost the little non-bias trustworthiness he had.   It would be very difficult to find anyone that's both competent AND unbiased.
1308156336182571009 2020-09-22 05:29:09 +0800 <julianna4307> @vk_cindy @DrShayPhD Right?? Its not just booze (altho there's pleeenty of that, too), there's something that's both rotting &amp; preserving that zombie. Those blank outs, weird stutters &amp; bizarre lip/jaw movements are clearly some type of impairment lol.
1308149153843810305 2020-09-22 05:00:37 +0800 <julianna4307> @BigLugBun The boomer's parents, most of them anyway, started that shit. Of course, wages started outpacing cost of living in the late 70s, &amp; when my parents were 25 in the late 80s, they had a house in a pricey neighborhood, 3 cars, a motorcycle, rv &amp; ski cabin, pool, etc on his pay alone
1308148549545340930 2020-09-22 04:58:13 +0800 <julianna4307> @BrittanyVenti I- I thought everyone was against that shit?? Like, violently so. I've seen a ton of vids/posts on the YouTubes, bitchute, telegram, etc... Where has anyone NOT been speaking out against it?!?
1308147960954400776 2020-09-22 04:55:52 +0800 <julianna4307> @vk_cindy @DrShayPhD I had the same thought. However, that acid, or whatever nastiness, that's she's full of seems to be like an embalming fluid that's keeping her alive.  https://t.co/Jl8OZLrpeb

1302054373992919042 2020-09-05 09:22:08 +0800 <julianna4307> This skinny, tryhard, blue checked clown actually thought this was a moment. He actually thinks he's hard, thinks he's aCcEpTeD by dindus.   Let me tell you I choked on my drink, laughing my ass off... #MuchLameWow

All three of the shooting victims were convicted criminals with crimes ranging from sexual conduct with a minor to felony strangulation, court documents show.  https://t.co/CTHKGrHLmm  You literally can't get any lower. Please, for your own pride, stop.
1301983655812894721 2020-09-05 04:41:07 +0800 <julianna4307> @doron_tauber it won't let me further comment on that thread, so I'll put it here: Also its wildly disingenuous to pretend Europeans weren't also slaves. ~2mil were, to the Barbary Pirates &amp; Moors. They were forced to live literal nightmares as galley &amp; sex slaves.
1301982782009282560 2020-09-05 04:37:39 +0800 <julianna4307> @_AntisemiticJew @Aarick20 EXACTLY. My dad lost out on 2 positions before, they were filled by diversity hires. My father was the more qualified man, but we all know, that's not important!! Anyways, both men hired instead ended up fucking things up badly; one guy cost the company millions.

1301975138016137218 2020-09-05 04:07:17 +0800 <julianna4307> That you've become laughably biased, &amp; no matter how many debunkings, how many positive actions &amp; disproven negativities, you don't care. Tara Reade, violent riots dems won't fix, Kamala's hypocrisy.. None of that matters. Only #OrangeManBad amirite? #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
1301975137063972866 2020-09-05 04:07:16 +0800 <julianna4307> #TrumpHatesVeterans if anyone actually believes such a bullshitty, unproven, "its true cuz I said so" 'jOuRnALiStic StOrY', just admit you believe anything negative about him, regardless of the veracity. That you support any twisted, falsified, purposely misinterpreted bullshit.

1301716374180573184 2020-09-04 10:59:02 +0800 <julianna4307> @_AntisemiticJew @Aarick20 Lol it quietly changed the numbers on its website on the 29th. Only 6% of the deaths reported were from covid, &amp; 99% of them were elderly. The other 94% had MORE THAN ONE other major health issue... Or, you know, car accident. We knew they were disingenuous numbers, but goddamn.
