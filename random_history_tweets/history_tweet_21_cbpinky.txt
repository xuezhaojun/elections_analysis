1343981206732480514 2020-12-30 02:04:24 +0800 <cbpinky> No surprise here! He doesn't care about Americans. He's got his pockets full from who knows how many lobbyist.

1343919767317581826 2020-12-29 22:00:16 +0800 <cbpinky> @realDonaldTrump You mean the Democratic hoax that was only 15 cases &amp; disappearing? I call it the #TrumpVirus since we now have over 330,000 dead Americans. #TrumpVirus on your watch!

1343916079047995393 2020-12-29 21:45:36 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Hugs to you, missus, &amp; our cute little Luce this morning. Hope you all have a truly amazing day with all good stuff. #StrongerTogether 🇺🇸

1343772780156825600 2020-12-29 12:16:11 +0800 <cbpinky> I so agree with this statement.  He needs to go.
1343772373166780416 2020-12-29 12:14:34 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar That happens sometimes when they get all happy &amp; excited.
1343771879694348290 2020-12-29 12:12:36 +0800 <cbpinky> Then how did trump even get in the doors of the WH? 🤦🏼‍♀️
1343771290000379905 2020-12-29 12:10:16 +0800 <cbpinky> @ejeancarroll @Politidope @I3aI3aYka @DCJohnNorton @parlertakes Stay strong EJC. I and many others are standing with you. We believe in you.
1343770447280799747 2020-12-29 12:06:55 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Goodnight. Rest well tonight. 💕
1343711005306740738 2020-12-29 08:10:43 +0800 <cbpinky> The media need to stop covering him. Of course trump loves the attention. He lives for it. When he's finally out of office, maybe the media won't cover him anymore. They are only fueling his crazy need for everything to revolve around him!
1343708777934106624 2020-12-29 08:01:52 +0800 <cbpinky> That is called sedition. Prison time for Gohmert for this act!
1343708365361438724 2020-12-29 08:00:13 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes. He's definitely an idiot.🤦🏼‍♀️ And evil.
1343707605890457604 2020-12-29 07:57:12 +0800 <cbpinky> Right. Absolute sedition! 😡
1343707387279134721 2020-12-29 07:56:20 +0800 <cbpinky> Shameful. Embarrassing. Wrong.

1343645108495921152 2020-12-29 03:48:52 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet Awesome HB! Good job!
1343644967709921282 2020-12-29 03:48:18 +0800 <cbpinky> Have they never been told that you can't overturn an election just because you don't like the results? God knows I would have in 2016 if possible. I still say Hillary won because trump was helped by the Russians.
1343644081763864580 2020-12-29 03:44:47 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Yes. When Maddie was as a puppy, it frightened her. She's used to it now, but she still doesn't like it.
1343642917114667011 2020-12-29 03:40:09 +0800 <cbpinky> It should be investigated. It's unbelievable that he supposedly won by as much as he did. He &amp; McGrath were virtually neck &amp; neck before the election. I've never understood why people from KY would continue to vote for McConnell when the state is so low in everything.
1343571236375457794 2020-12-28 22:55:19 +0800 <cbpinky> Amen to that!

1343570037110665221 2020-12-28 22:50:33 +0800 <cbpinky> Absolutely not. Republicans would have impeached a Democrat in nothing flat. Clinton was impeached for telling 1 lie. 1 lie. Who can even count how many times trump lied?
1343529624719007744 2020-12-28 20:09:58 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Wishing your family a safe &amp; peaceful day. Stay safe. #StrongerTogether
1343529036266541056 2020-12-28 20:07:38 +0800 <cbpinky> @marcorubio You are such an idiot! You need to go back to your bible quoting. It's obvious that you aren't reading them yourself. Take some time &amp; really read them. It might help you with speaking the truth.

1343288178640375814 2020-12-28 04:10:33 +0800 <cbpinky> Such a looser! Why do his constituents continue to vote for this asshat? He does nothing for anyone but the rich because they donate to his campaign! Come on people, open your eyes!
1343286070499299332 2020-12-28 04:02:10 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet Never even heard of it. Thanks for the heads up HB!👍🏻

1343241330517020672 2020-12-28 01:04:24 +0800 <cbpinky> While Americans loose unemployment benefits &amp; people are hungry &amp; being evicted, Cruz can always be counted on to take the low road. Why do his constituents continue voting for this looser?
1343217325256953858 2020-12-27 23:29:00 +0800 <cbpinky> What could she say that would be of any importance to us? Flotus doesn't care about us anymore than the rest of the trump family does. Melanie said it herself. "I really don't care, do you?" She also said "who cares about f*cling Christmas" to her friend. Her "be best"/Oh Please!
1343214549319753731 2020-12-27 23:17:58 +0800 <cbpinky> Asshat!
1343205283250790400 2020-12-27 22:41:09 +0800 <cbpinky> I will never understand why people vote for hacks like Tuberville. Why in God's name don't they vote for their own best interests is beyond me! Are people genuinely so stupid that they really don't care?!😡Just to get a Republican. Doug Jones is a good man.

1343189082311176193 2020-12-27 21:36:47 +0800 <cbpinky> It's just like the way he treated the Obama presidency. McConnell  remarked that he would see to it that Obama would only be a 1 term president. He wasn't able to do that, but he made it impossible to pass any bills!
1343185067275931648 2020-12-27 21:20:49 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Hope you &amp; the missus have a great Sunday. Yes, Sunday.😉 Hugs for our little Luce too. BTW, he's already growing so fast. ❤

1343054759142547456 2020-12-27 12:43:01 +0800 <cbpinky> Just put on the mask you inconsiderate asshole. Why can't you follow the posted signs?! Even if you aren't sick, you can still be a carrier. What part of that can you not understand? Are you that stupid?! 😡😡

You have been destructive to America in every way possible.   You promised to drain the swamp, but you only made it worse! Thank God I didn't vote for you in 2016 or 2020.

1342615890341359619 2020-12-26 07:39:07 +0800 <cbpinky> Right. Trump is only wanting to cause chaos. That's it. Democrats always wanted $2000. Republicans refused.

1342293714518073353 2020-12-25 10:18:54 +0800 <cbpinky> No. They still don't care. They like the fact that he's a racist. That he's evil &amp; cruel. They're just as bad as trump or they wouldn't support everything he says &amp; does!

1342165309395005441 2020-12-25 01:48:40 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar No one important.
1342165093069545479 2020-12-25 01:47:49 +0800 <cbpinky> @atensnut Don't count on it! The majority are thrilled to be getting rid of Trump. It will take the Biden/Harris administration a long time to undo the damage caused by the asshat trump!
1342163901899796482 2020-12-25 01:43:05 +0800 <cbpinky> Shame on Republicans. Americans are hungry. Loosing their homes. Yet these congressional Republicans will be spending Christmas with plenty to eat, gifts, and a roof over their own and their families heads. Shows just how much Republicans care about American families.😪😪or not.

1342120573770596353 2020-12-24 22:50:54 +0800 <cbpinky> Every last one of them knew what trump was, yet let him stay in as potus. And they continue to let him reek havoc until his last day in office! They have no shame. They call themselves Republicans, but that party is done!

1341948879793754112 2020-12-24 11:28:39 +0800 <cbpinky> Typical.
1341948156918063105 2020-12-24 11:25:47 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Goodnight Ron, missus, &amp; sweet little Luce. Pleasant dreams. 💜
1341947635020791813 2020-12-24 11:23:43 +0800 <cbpinky> It sure is. But Sasse is one of the many Republican senators to blame for every bit of illegal crap that Trump has committed. They could have put an end to every bit of it. This is all on them!

1341883596005634051 2020-12-24 07:09:14 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @rogertansey Not by me voting for him! I've always thought he was jerky asshat.😡 I hope people from other countries realize not all Americans are racist &amp; homophobic. Or nuts!
1341863953329217538 2020-12-24 05:51:11 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @rogertansey It's truly sad. People standing in line to get food. Unemployment ending very soon for many. I never thought I'd see the USA in this situation. Under trumps leadership, he's brought this country to its knees. People  are hurting. Trump &amp; Republicans don't seem to care at all.
1341862179113459720 2020-12-24 05:44:08 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam 😂😂😂 That's what we say about Maddie too. She is the boss of us!😉
1341861513116717056 2020-12-24 05:41:29 +0800 <cbpinky> Complicit.
1341861109100376065 2020-12-24 05:39:53 +0800 <cbpinky> 😪So sad. All this under trumps leadership. (Or lack of)
1341859892928405504 2020-12-24 05:35:03 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam She's so cute!
1341859149123084289 2020-12-24 05:32:06 +0800 <cbpinky> Yet again, at this point, are any of us really surprised?!🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
1341858730615386112 2020-12-24 05:30:26 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @rogertansey The only thing done for Americans was the one time $1200 relief check, &amp; not everyone got that stimulus money! People are so behind on rent or at this point, been evicted! Since the great depression, America hasn't had this many hungry people! Pitiful, shameful, &amp; embarrassing.
1341856463728369664 2020-12-24 05:21:26 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Maddie's in! #DoggiesAgainstTrump  https://t.co/k8RNy2waeY
1341854079564308482 2020-12-24 05:11:57 +0800 <cbpinky> Indeed he is! Lindsey Graham has been a complete suck up to trump, &amp; has completely put the screws to the American people! 😡
1341822079335849985 2020-12-24 03:04:48 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @AlexandraHemmin @staab_rita We Americans are wondering that too!
1341821400785498114 2020-12-24 03:02:06 +0800 <cbpinky> They aren't. Democrats get the economy moving. Republicans use their tax breaks to benefit the rich. They get richer, the rest of us have to suffer.
1341819969055711234 2020-12-24 02:56:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Typical GOP.
1341819379730792449 2020-12-24 02:54:04 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar He looks so sweet &amp; innocent.

1341721289359323136 2020-12-23 20:24:18 +0800 <cbpinky> $600 isn't enough. Trump won't do anything. If he gave a crap, he would have been involved &amp; told the GOP to give more relief before this point. He just wants to create more chaos. That's what trump is all about! Trump doesn't care about working Americans that are struggling.
1341719716503711744 2020-12-23 20:18:03 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Luce! You are absolutely the most handsome young pup on Twitter. Have a fun &amp; fantastic day. 💙
1341568493666361345 2020-12-23 10:17:08 +0800 <cbpinky> No. They don't matter to them.
1341568297976942594 2020-12-23 10:16:22 +0800 <cbpinky> Because everything has to be about him. Always has, always will be.
1341567916274270208 2020-12-23 10:14:51 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good night Ron. Hope you get a full nights sleep and rest. Luce will eventually sleep through the night. He's still a baby &amp; has a small bladder &amp; he might need a little snack. Hugs for all. You, misses, &amp; little Luce.

1341535849494827009 2020-12-23 08:07:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Many Americans have been saying the same thing! Especially those of us that have been wearing masks &amp; distancing from loved ones!
1341530535726895104 2020-12-23 07:46:18 +0800 <cbpinky> OMG! They really are nuts!
1341530396115218432 2020-12-23 07:45:45 +0800 <cbpinky> I doubt trumps aides are that intelligent!
1341530149502763008 2020-12-23 07:44:46 +0800 <cbpinky> Nothing surprising about these 6 asshats not wanting to help the American people.

1341479101333463046 2020-12-23 04:21:55 +0800 <cbpinky> Because he doesn't care about it. Trump gave up on the dead &amp; covid a long time ago! He never cared about people dying in the first place! Remember, it was a Democrat hoax!

Lucifer is your favorite TV show. (I love it too) You owe no one any explanations. Lucifer will be a very sweet &amp; loving boy because you're raising him to be.💙

1340687884081393671 2020-12-20 23:57:54 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂
1340687155606269952 2020-12-20 23:55:01 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam I can see it plain as can be. The scripture quoting hypocrite.

1340673583186665478 2020-12-20 23:01:05 +0800 <cbpinky> Well...he &amp; his cronies sure tried everything illegal to win! But we didn't let that stop us from voting in the many millions. That's why we get Joe Biden for POTUS!
1340666171440443394 2020-12-20 22:31:38 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar I'm running late this morning, but a late good morning to you &amp; the family also. Have a fun, safe, &amp; healthy Sunday. Huggies to our little Luce.

1340483177824063490 2020-12-20 10:24:29 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar I couldn't do it either Ron. Don't feel bad.
1340479363733729280 2020-12-20 10:09:19 +0800 <cbpinky> @AlexandraHemmin You know it! I feel for Joe Biden. He's going to have his hands full just trying to undo all the damage that evil idiot has done the last 4 years.
1340436762951335942 2020-12-20 07:20:03 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump &amp; associates are willing to do anything to keep him in the WH! AMERICANS**PAY ATTENTION

1340430651145793536 2020-12-20 06:55:45 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar How cute he is up front shopping! Pretty soon he'll have his own credit card.
1340390027017240577 2020-12-20 04:14:20 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Perfect. I love it. Big difference, Don &amp; Melanie are nowhere close to Boris &amp; Natasha's intelligence level.

1340386587063046148 2020-12-20 04:00:40 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam You bet she is. She's just as guilty as trump. For one, they're both guilty of accusing former President Obama of being from Kenya.
1340330299734056960 2020-12-20 00:17:00 +0800 <cbpinky> @Politidope I have 2.  It's a Wonderful Life A Christmas Story

1340301268082954240 2020-12-19 22:21:38 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂😂
1340300773998145537 2020-12-19 22:19:40 +0800 <cbpinky> Of course he does. Most likely, he's complicit in the whole thing with his bff Putin.
1340299828778180609 2020-12-19 22:15:55 +0800 <cbpinky> This needs to be eradicated immediately. No excuse for this!

1340105094910631938 2020-12-19 09:22:07 +0800 <cbpinky> @Politidope None of the above Matt. The answer is trump himself. No one likes him!
1340104643645476871 2020-12-19 09:20:19 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar No. Don't want our precious puppy catching anything from him! Grrrr.
1340104087564644359 2020-12-19 09:18:07 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar His Aunty Carolyn says yes, all he wants to.

1339948126342434828 2020-12-18 22:58:23 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar I know it. Same here. Hopefully soon, maybe we can all socialize again. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Until then 😷😷.
1339947410915782657 2020-12-18 22:55:32 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @mog7546 Peoples stupidity &amp; disregard for their safety,let alone their fellow human beings never cease to amaze me. 😷😷😷😷

1339885089073885185 2020-12-18 18:47:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @ProjectLincoln @MarkoSilberhand Happy Anniversary &amp; thank you for fighting for America! 🇺🇸🇺🇸

1339883615002513409 2020-12-18 18:42:02 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes. Got it right. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1339883192963248129 2020-12-18 18:40:21 +0800 <cbpinky> Only when he's sent to federal prison!
1339879372602433538 2020-12-18 18:25:10 +0800 <cbpinky> OMG! This is the USA. What is wrong with these idiot people?
1339878154391969793 2020-12-18 18:20:20 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Hoping you have a fantastic &amp; safe day. Hugs for little Luce. You &amp; missus too. #StrongerTogether
1339877051944341505 2020-12-18 18:15:57 +0800 <cbpinky> @realDonaldTrump Nope. Our great country is completely disappointed in the worse POTUS this country has ever had!
1339850162429194242 2020-12-18 16:29:06 +0800 <cbpinky> @TankSchottle Thank you for your sweet words Tank &amp; for being a good friend.  I hope you stay safe &amp; have a Merry Christmas this year. Love you to Tank! 🎄🎄

1339787162779324416 2020-12-18 12:18:46 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Goodnight my friend. Sleep well. Luv to you, the missus, &amp; the cute little furry one. The one &amp; only Luce.💕
1339755291399888896 2020-12-18 10:12:07 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Little man, you're just to precious. 💕
1339753825243193346 2020-12-18 10:06:18 +0800 <cbpinky> Republicans weren't played by trump! They knew exactly what he was when he was elected. They either participated with him or were willing to cover for him. Either way, they are complicit in his illegal behavior &amp; should be held accountable.
1339751612387102721 2020-12-18 09:57:30 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam I hope so. God knows the Republicans wouldn't hold him responsible for anything. He would have been impeached if not for them. That just gave him free rein to do worse! He's nothing but a traitor!
1339745061567946752 2020-12-18 09:31:28 +0800 <cbpinky> Could be. Possibly the reason he hasn't made any comments about it or say anything to Putin!
1339744203073609729 2020-12-18 09:28:03 +0800 <cbpinky> @AreMond2 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼good one!
1339741942138155008 2020-12-18 09:19:04 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Sure he does. Trump has not made 1 effort to stand up to Putin! I wonder what exactly Putin has on him, or if it's all tied to money lending? I hope all this gets researched when he's out of the WH.
1339739717340966912 2020-12-18 09:10:14 +0800 <cbpinky> Me too! 🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️
1339734232743239684 2020-12-18 08:48:26 +0800 <cbpinky> You got it!
1339731793843523587 2020-12-18 08:38:45 +0800 <cbpinky> If you can't tell by his eyes, the slurred speech is a dead give away. He's definitely high!
1339730208925114368 2020-12-18 08:32:27 +0800 <cbpinky> Hmm. Ya think?

1339594637711867908 2020-12-17 23:33:44 +0800 <cbpinky> @erb_kay @RonSarkar @JazCleveland923 That's true. Scotties are bigger &amp; tougher in their own minds than in body stature. That's why they call them the die hard!😂😂 She's a little shrimp in comparison to a lab for sure. Sorry about  your friend loosing her bed spot.😉😉 what we won't do for our fur babies. 💕
1339592458133327873 2020-12-17 23:25:05 +0800 <cbpinky> There are NO election irregularities you idiots! That has been proven over &amp; over again. Just because you don't like the result doesn't mean it's illegal. Dems didn't like the result in 2016, but like adults do, we didn't whine about it even though Russia aided Trump!
1339589829378539521 2020-12-17 23:14:38 +0800 <cbpinky> @rogertansey @pamfromkam Sure. Especially if he'll be in it!😉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😉
1339549697351032833 2020-12-17 20:35:10 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Thank you for the good wishes. Hoping you also have a great &amp; safe day. 💕 #StrongerTogether
1339548626561998848 2020-12-17 20:30:54 +0800 <cbpinky> How about crappy?
1339544158965526531 2020-12-17 20:13:09 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Such a pretty view. Love to see it. Thanks for posting.
1339389394931888128 2020-12-17 09:58:11 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar No worries. I'm legit. Promise.
1339386467232215040 2020-12-17 09:46:33 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar The last part is fine, &amp; permitted. Hiding from said puppy is a no-no.(unless you're playing hide &amp; go seek with puppy.)
1339385693936730113 2020-12-17 09:43:28 +0800 <cbpinky> I don't really see that he has a choice. Yet another attempt for this idiot to over ride our democracy!
1339383493944610816 2020-12-17 09:34:44 +0800 <cbpinky> I never tipped my landlord when I used to rent. Where did that stupid idea come from? You're giving them a huge chunk of your money for a place to live. I think that's plenty.
1339382803922903042 2020-12-17 09:31:59 +0800 <cbpinky> Then it's way past time for a change. Don't you agree?👍🏻
1339353244859052034 2020-12-17 07:34:32 +0800 <cbpinky> @AZGOP More Republican propaganda! This isn't what you said in 2016! So hypocritical.
1339347971629076480 2020-12-17 07:13:34 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Nepal maybe?
1339346579644436481 2020-12-17 07:08:03 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar How happy he is to see Mommy! And Mommy is happy to see her baby Luce. Ah, puppy love.
1339333171733819393 2020-12-17 06:14:46 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Home for me is East Tennessee. Not far from the Great Smoky Mountains.

1338989716297949187 2020-12-16 07:30:00 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Someone told me that &amp; it works with my Maddie. But they are like us, all different.
1338989175157256192 2020-12-16 07:27:51 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar He should be on a schedule for his meals. Then after he eats &amp; drinks, take him out. I've always left a tiny bit of kibble in my dogs dish so she can get a bite occasionally. And water always available. Also when you take him outside &amp; he pees, tell him good peepee or poopie.
1338984858811588608 2020-12-16 07:10:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @jarm_lu @myname85508373 @BuckyBones1 @RicardoRGPhoto @JakeSherman @kyledcheney @senatemajldr @RoyBlunt @SenJohnThune Are you not going to enlighten us on how we're all so very wrong, or do you just like calling people names? Just asking.  My question to you though is how can you support Trump &amp; while he ignores the Constitution?

1338881628538605569 2020-12-16 00:20:30 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Don't think about it. It only brings you down. (Except Biden news)  Just enjoy your little Luce. That keeps you content.

I left the door open to Maddie's with her blanket inside &amp; she started going in on her own to nap. It's hard when they cry, but it is best, especially when you're away till they get out of the puppy stage.

1338351459667210240 2020-12-14 13:13:48 +0800 <cbpinky> Crenshaw should resign for this. Why would he go out of his way to cause harm to a fellow vet? To trash her reputation. IMO, He shows no loyalty to a veteran. Because she's a woman perhaps?

When I first brought my puppy home, I wrapped up an old time alarm clock in a towel &amp; put it in bed with her. The tic toc sound seemed to relax her &amp; help her sleep.

But I have never completely loathed &amp; been disgusted by a Potus in my life until now. I've always respected the office, he deserves none. Trump is so much worse than I even anticipated.

1337482039138938880 2020-12-12 03:39:02 +0800 <cbpinky> Traitors! They know this election was all legal and above board. They are doing this to stay in trumps good graces as well as his maga/kkk followers!
1337426253159292928 2020-12-11 23:57:21 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @RonSarkar Me too. I love them. Nothing more precious than a puppy!💙

1337425210023305222 2020-12-11 23:53:12 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar @SureReality I forgot. Food/water bowls, collar &amp; leash. Doggie bed too if he doesn't sleep with you &amp; the misses. Maybe pee pads to work on potty training. He's going to be large, so remember, if you let him sleep with you now, it will be hard to get him back to his own bed.
1337423861651017734 2020-12-11 23:47:51 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar OMG! He's gorgeous! Blanket, toys, good food, lots of love! He looks like a Winston to me. Or Win or Winnie for short.
1337423151089782785 2020-12-11 23:45:01 +0800 <cbpinky> Huh! Typical response from her.

1337389249063251974 2020-12-11 21:30:19 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes it should! Republican State AG's determined the election results are fine. No illegal voting, no fake signatures. Trump is pushing his illegal votes  to stir the maga/kkk followers. Senators are afraid of him. Stand up! It's going to result in violence or death eventually.
1337379916644556801 2020-12-11 20:53:14 +0800 <cbpinky> For telling the truth! He was fired!😡

1337247887550509058 2020-12-11 12:08:35 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @RonSarkar Sadly, I was wrong about Americans rejecting Trump for the racist, evil, &amp; cruel asshat that he is. I assumed they would see through him. Unfortunately, they are in agreement with him or they are so stupid that they couldn't. Unbelievable isn't it?
1337245794504757251 2020-12-11 12:00:16 +0800 <cbpinky> 👌🏼Perfect!
1337244417279848453 2020-12-11 11:54:48 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @RonSarkar It's truly sad to think that some Americans have allowed trump to do the despicable things he's done to our fellow human beings. They truly believe he's protecting the USA. This country has always welcomed people that want a better life. None of us would be here if it hadn't! 🇺🇸
1337241818925330432 2020-12-11 11:44:29 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @RonSarkar And remember, some of those children were only babies. They won't even remember who their real parents are. This is wrong on so many levels. How can anyone support something like this? I guess if you're completely heartless.
1337240729219964935 2020-12-11 11:40:09 +0800 <cbpinky> So I'm assuming they have abandoned democracy. We've always abided by election results. They don't like the American peoples vote, so they'll go to court to change it!
1337239766883045378 2020-12-11 11:36:19 +0800 <cbpinky> @Realhum66478991 I'm sorry for your loss. I didn't see your original tweet. Apologies for not seeing it sooner. I send you wishes for a healing heart &amp; hugs for comfort. So sad for the loss of your sister.

If Ossoff &amp; Warnock aren't elected there, this country is still going to be stuck with McConnell as majority leader and Biden will have no chance of getting anything accomplished.🇺🇸

1336402580822515713 2020-12-09 04:09:39 +0800 <cbpinky> @BrianKempGA Thank you Gov. Kemp for refusing to allow Donald Trump into bullying you. This is beyond political party. He wants to commit illegal acts in order to stay in office. Thank you for doing what is right. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Country over party!

Maybe God answered prayers from the rest of us by making sure Biden was elected. It is possible that Democrats are also Christian.  Why do Republicans think only they have a direct line to God?

1334469391233249280 2020-12-03 20:07:50 +0800 <cbpinky> And trump says Dems are crooked. But it's always the Republicans we see getting caught.

1333991140333379584 2020-12-02 12:27:26 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Wish I could help, but I'm sitting in my chair eating some white chocolate chip cookies. At 11:30 at night.
1333989586247278592 2020-12-02 12:21:16 +0800 <cbpinky> He certainly is. They approved everything he did. Not really surprising except maybe Alexander. Can't believe he blew his whole legacy for a crooked doofus like trump!
1333988271693721602 2020-12-02 12:16:02 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂 He's demented!
1333977413177528320 2020-12-02 11:32:54 +0800 <cbpinky> Why would you pardon someone who supposedly has done nothing wrong? That's always been trumps M.O.!

1333785543939739650 2020-12-01 22:50:28 +0800 <cbpinky> He should loose his law license at the very least. He appears before the court &amp; can't provide any evidence of any voting irregularities. But he gets on TV &amp; says something completely different &amp; spews out this kind of BS inciting violence from the trump idiots!
1333784645280927744 2020-12-01 22:46:54 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Good morning Ron. Hope you are feeling better today. #StrongerTogether

1333539973635731459 2020-12-01 06:34:40 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar I'm sorry Ron. Hoping you're feeling better soon.
1333539557560774663 2020-12-01 06:33:01 +0800 <cbpinky> He's a coward. McConnell is terrified of Trumps maga followers! As are the majority of Republicans! 😡

1332468880611094529 2020-11-28 07:38:31 +0800 <cbpinky> No excuse for this as he was only following Trumps lead. Republican Governors wanted to stay in his good graces because of fallout from Trump himself or his idiot followers.

How he had bankrupted companies that had done work for him, &amp; how he had filed for it 6 times himself. I knew he would be bad for this country! He was so much worse than I even thought possible.

Now we're having a terrible time. We have over 250,000 dead Americans now. So many infected with it. Please wear a mask &amp; don't get in large crowds. Stay safe.
1330523732763435013 2020-11-22 22:49:12 +0800 <cbpinky> So sad that this is what the Republican party has become. Even though I've never voted Republican, I always thought they were loyal to America. Sadly, I've realized that's not true. They are loyal to Trump!

1330507323467567104 2020-11-22 21:44:00 +0800 <cbpinky> But not at all surprising. Everyone knew the kind of man Trump was before he was elected. He turned out even worse. I hope everyone that voted for him finally see that he doesn't care about America!  Only for himself. It's obvious the way he's behaving w/Biden during transition.

I think that's much more appropriate. He deserves the credit for the virus much more than for the vaccine!
1330142562536083458 2020-11-21 21:34:34 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar @aquarianscorpio Ron, there's doggie tushie wipes at the pet stores that you wipe them with. Very reasonably priced too. I have a black Scottish terrier &amp; I adore her. But the fur is high maintenance. Trimming, that kind of stuff. Cocker spaniels, small beagles are cute. All types of small pups.

1328702789674016771 2020-11-17 22:13:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Gov. Whitmer is a heroine in this war on covid19. She has done her best to contain it while dealing with magats storming the Capital, Trump calling them out to reject her, &amp; his followers planning to abduct, put her on trial, &amp; put her to death! Trump owns this BS. He's a menace!

1327716118472118272 2020-11-15 04:52:45 +0800 <cbpinky> Idiot! Maybe that's what we should have done in 2016 when we got stuck with trump!

I don't know what has happened in this country.  After Obama was elected, people absolutely went crazy! The color of his skin is the only reason! SO SAD😪
1327645430029701120 2020-11-15 00:11:51 +0800 <cbpinky> Thank you again for speaking out for our country sir. You are a true patriot and I admire your courage and commitment to America.

1327030585450242048 2020-11-13 07:28:41 +0800 <cbpinky> Not true. They know exactly what he's capable of. Republicans are terrified that he will turn their followers against them! That's the simplest way to put it. They're all traitors imo, they know everything he did &amp; went along or participated in it! They're just as bad as he is!

1326827346435977217 2020-11-12 18:01:05 +0800 <cbpinky> But it's only a Democrat hoax! 15 cases &amp; it's gone. We're rounding the curve. Trump might as well have taken out a gun &amp; just shot 240,000 people. These dead. The Dads, Moms, Grandparents, &amp; children are on him. How many were needlessly lost because of him?!! #TrumpVirus
1326824692402057216 2020-11-12 17:50:32 +0800 <cbpinky> @SenRonJohnson Get real Senator. We all know that there's very little fraud, if any, that's taken place in this election. Shame on you and fellow Republicans for being traitors to democracy.

1326370094985994241 2020-11-11 11:44:08 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump is doing his best to bring this country to its end. He's got till Jan 20th to do it! That shows just how much he "loves" America. HE DOESN'T! He's willing to destroy America &amp; its citizens cause he has a butthurt from loosing the election. Trump "loves" only himself!

1326298767075782656 2020-11-11 07:00:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @rabrowne75 This is an attempted coup! Why are Republicans doing nothing about this? Someone needs to stand up to Trump &amp; Barr now to stop this. They need to stand up for this country. Not for Trump!If not, in the not to distant future, we are on the road to AUTOCRACY! 🇺🇸

Civilians that work in the Pentagon that are loyal to him are replacing them! Sounds as if you are a trump supporter. You might want to look up the insurrection act. He has no plans to concede or leave the WH!

1326274671134838786 2020-11-11 05:24:57 +0800 <cbpinky> @SenAlexander TN people say stand up for democracy Senator. Don't sell your soul for Trump. He's not worth it. You know these votes are legitimate. Please don't end your career being supportive of Trump &amp; his sycophants who will always take the low road. You know that Biden is a good man.🇺🇸

1326181452371910656 2020-11-10 23:14:32 +0800 <cbpinky> Republicans need to remember what the party was before trump &amp; family became part of it. Perhaps make some real strides to separate itself from them before it permanently becomes the trump party! My Dad was a lifelong Republican, but he wouldn't be involved with it nowadays. 🇺🇸

1325898836158652420 2020-11-10 04:31:31 +0800 <cbpinky> Why does everyone act so surprised about trump not conceding? Or the GOP Senate? The way they behaved for the last 4 years, did you really expect anything different? I didn't. They have cheated &amp; lied about everything possible! Trump is the one to have Russian help! Not Biden!

Concede and be a decent human being. You may actually enjoy the way it makes you feel. Doubtful since you have no morals. But give a try.

1325075946941149184 2020-11-07 22:01:39 +0800 <cbpinky> @jesse_nicoletta @MSNBC Such bullshit. Like she has time to concern herself finding the "deplorables" that voted for trump. Much more important things to deal with than that right now. 1st &amp; most urgent, covid19. 2nd, getting some financial aid to the people who are desperate for help!

There is no evidence anywhere that has shown any fraudulent actions. No further voting needs to be done. Trump will assuredly be the same exiting the WH as he's been during his tenure!🇺🇸

1322973642142162945 2020-11-02 02:47:50 +0800 <cbpinky> @TheReelRandom Hello there! I'm a new follower. Like what you have to say! #VoteBidenHarris2020
1322972843995443200 2020-11-02 02:44:40 +0800 <cbpinky> It's true. Have no doubt about it!
1322972382760456197 2020-11-02 02:42:50 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @rogertansey It's been terrible the whole time he's been in office! There hasn't been 1 single day that lies haven't just rolled off his tongue.  That's what I hate about him most, besides his ability to sway so many idiots to believe him! I can't think of 1 positive thing he's done for USA!

1322938626406338566 2020-11-02 00:28:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @rogertansey Me too, Pam. I just don't know how I can tolerate another 4 years of this screaming, lying, Putin want-to-be dictator! I fear the USA will no longer be a democracy if he is re-elected! Trump has chipped away at it since  his election. The thought of that is absolutely terrifying.
1322933719313862656 2020-11-02 00:09:12 +0800 <cbpinky> What if we have our own ideas &amp; traditions that we want to follow? I'm #VotingBiden!🇺🇸

1322902917914021889 2020-11-01 22:06:48 +0800 <cbpinky> Is anything surprising anymore?  This is absolutely the most corrupt potus &amp; administration in my lifetime. Why are people still supporting him? Can they not see his distruction of our country, are they ok with white supremacy, or Russian influence? 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ I don't get it!
1322897471136272385 2020-11-01 21:45:10 +0800 <cbpinky> GOOD! The people that participated in that dangerous childish act should be charged with endangerment &amp; have their licenses suspended!

1321580121950748672 2020-10-29 06:30:29 +0800 <cbpinky> Definitely does not apply to Donald Trump. His motto is LIE WHENEVER POSSIBLE, LIE WHEN THE TRUTH IS BETTER!
1321579480314482688 2020-10-29 06:27:56 +0800 <cbpinky> He already has. He's been on CNN for months talking about what a disaster trump has been as president.
1321521130688172043 2020-10-29 02:36:04 +0800 <cbpinky> Why are police officers letting this happen in any neighborhood? This is voter intimidation! Shouldn't be happening in the USA.

1321453851162091521 2020-10-28 22:08:44 +0800 <cbpinky> I can't stand him! He doesn't even shut his mouth long enough for anyone to get in a question.

1321199842782306305 2020-10-28 05:19:23 +0800 <cbpinky> Something Donald Trump couldn't or wouldn't understand since he's had bone spurs. At least 5 times!
1321199205201907712 2020-10-28 05:16:51 +0800 <cbpinky> Does this not prove just how dangerous Donald Trump is to the USA? He encourages this!

You would do well to remember the old saying, what goes around comes around. Some day, you will be in the minority &amp; pay backs can really be a bitch! The USA deserves better than you immature assholes!

All trump had to do was to get this country prepared &amp; keep us safe. But he has ignored all precautions &amp; advice from medical professionals. #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
1320433920496848897 2020-10-26 02:35:53 +0800 <cbpinky> Shameful. Now we have over 225,000 dead Americans from this virus. This is completely on Trump &amp; his administration. If only they would have shut down the country long enough. Now Americans will have this virus killing us for another 2 years. #TrumpVirus2020

1319652459846029318 2020-10-23 22:50:39 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam I don't either. At his age, he'd probably be in the hospital if it was covid19. And on oxygen. I'm thinking heart related.
1319651596452745216 2020-10-23 22:47:13 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Blue spots on his hands &amp; blue tint around his mouth. Circulation, heart disease, oxygen levels? 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️

1319419253657927683 2020-10-23 07:23:58 +0800 <cbpinky> @Yamiche @pamfromkam Just like all the women he brought out in his debate with HRC to sit in the front row to disarm her! Didn't work. Joe Biden should have brought just some of the women who have accused trump of sexual assault. Or the business people he's bankrupted! Joe's to classy. Not trump!
1319415489001627648 2020-10-23 07:09:00 +0800 <cbpinky> Always the Republican. That's why they are so concerned we Democrats will do it! They're pushing that theory cause they know we're coming out in huge numbers to #VoteBidenHarris2020!
1319408613815889920 2020-10-23 06:41:41 +0800 <cbpinky> @BeeBee5977 @InspiringU2 Heartbreaking.  So very sorry for your loss. Wishing you peace &amp; hopes for a healing heart.

1319405052017184768 2020-10-23 06:27:32 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam You're right Pam. I'm concerned that these stupid militias will try to start another civil war when trump is defeated (&amp; he must be, or this will be the end of democracy here in America.) Everywhere you turn, you see bumper stickers, flags in the yard, or their redneck tshirts!
1319397471995502592 2020-10-23 05:57:25 +0800 <cbpinky> This is on Trump. He's inciting nutjobs &amp; his militia followers on a daily basis. He will promote fake election results &amp; will encourage his supporters to commit violence if he looses. Trump is truly evil. He doesn't care about any American lives.
1319394317111382016 2020-10-23 05:44:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @AndySzilagyi Such a whiny baby man!

1319373059330105346 2020-10-23 04:20:24 +0800 <cbpinky> What a whiny little pussy trump is! He can't answer a single question without complaining!
1319371153367044098 2020-10-23 04:12:50 +0800 <cbpinky> What the hell?!! Trump is a crackhead. How whiny!

1319005993922121729 2020-10-22 04:01:49 +0800 <cbpinky> This is absolutely heartbreaking. How do they plan to reunite these children with the parents that were deported when they don't even know where they are? This is just one more of the stupid ideas &amp; laws our pretend evangelical potus came up with!

1318902517602856960 2020-10-21 21:10:38 +0800 <cbpinky> 👌👌👌I think you definitely have that right!
1318842400224182272 2020-10-21 17:11:45 +0800 <cbpinky> But according to trump, we are turning the curve. It's going away!
1318760778615431169 2020-10-21 11:47:25 +0800 <cbpinky> What an asshole!
1318749415272796160 2020-10-21 11:02:16 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump's been in office for 4 years. He's not done a damn thing for the middle class and the poor. Only tax breaks for the rich. Screw the rest of us!  America deserves better! 🇺🇸
1318747457849856000 2020-10-21 10:54:29 +0800 <cbpinky> Republicans will never admit it. It would mean that they've supported a true dumbass that wasn't even intelligent enough to fake being a president when he originally had knowledgeable people around &amp; covering for him. Trump truly is a Russian asset!
1318746130851778562 2020-10-21 10:49:13 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar Goodnight Ron. 💖😴😴
1318735087249313792 2020-10-21 10:05:20 +0800 <cbpinky> Ooh, burn.🔥
1318732434050080768 2020-10-21 09:54:47 +0800 <cbpinky> Good to hear, but he should be fired IMO. Not just disciplined. Things are way to shakey between the public &amp; police right now as it is! No need for this kind of bs! He knew what he was doing.
1318731575245328385 2020-10-21 09:51:23 +0800 <cbpinky> After reading what he said about getting the story out even if it's not true to the NYT because they wouldn't spend much time researching before publishing it proves that he's even a bigger ass than I ever thought he was!
1318685881050562568 2020-10-21 06:49:48 +0800 <cbpinky> Good point!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
1318684954633568257 2020-10-21 06:46:07 +0800 <cbpinky> Do it! Nothing that the idiot traitor could do or say would surprise me at this point. He's let 220,000+ Americans die from his virus without blinking an eye! What's he going to do, just shoot the rest of us? Oh, I forgot he's already said he could do that &amp; no one would care.
1318683630777081856 2020-10-21 06:40:52 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump is a treasonous potus!

1318631688998735879 2020-10-21 03:14:28 +0800 <cbpinky> @rogertansey @pamfromkam Dead heat? Just shows how stupid some human beings can be. Who can still be voting for trump with America burning?

1316945267900452865 2020-10-16 11:33:14 +0800 <cbpinky> @PaulSecore @JoshuaTBerglan @Acosta I know enough about Qanon that I think you're all a bunch of crackpot nuts! Conspiracy theories abound!

1316909215827546117 2020-10-16 09:09:58 +0800 <cbpinky> @JoshuaTBerglan @Acosta Not true. Qanon itself may not be violent, but they encourage it in others!
1316908589714448384 2020-10-16 09:07:29 +0800 <cbpinky> @6percentReally @Acosta FBI has stated that antifa is nothing. No comparison to the white supremacists groups &amp; Qanon.
1316907429205020673 2020-10-16 09:02:52 +0800 <cbpinky> @kitabear @Acosta Oh please. Everyone knows what BS this is. Remember the pizza joint that some guy showed up at with guns because it was reported that HRC was running a pedophile trafficking ring out of it? It ended up being Qanon BS. The guy, mental help &amp; prison if I remember correctly.
1316906387650347008 2020-10-16 08:58:44 +0800 <cbpinky> That's just typical for him. Who's surprised by anything this nutjob says anymore!
1316905150766829568 2020-10-16 08:53:49 +0800 <cbpinky> Great question. The short answer is they're Republicans. They aren't as good &amp; devout as the profess.
1316903388488081409 2020-10-16 08:46:49 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂 I won't be watching. I'm watching Joe Biden!

1316748344128090114 2020-10-15 22:30:43 +0800 <cbpinky> @SenAlexander I would like to ask you not to support ACBs nomination to be added to the SC at this time. As McConnell, Graham &amp; all Republicans stated in 2016, when Obama put forth Garland for SC, this nominee should be postponed for the next president to choose.
1316745682267537410 2020-10-15 22:20:09 +0800 <cbpinky> Read this thread. Carl Bernstein makes perfect sense. I thought the very same thing, but he put it so much more eloquently. I'll be tuning in to #JOEBIDEN2020 on ABC. #NBCEnablesTrump

1316687687022252032 2020-10-15 18:29:42 +0800 <cbpinky> I don't understand why trump has such a hard on for Obama. Is it because Obama is much more intelligent? Got more accomplished? More loved &amp; admired? I'm tired of listening to this ass. Everytime he opens his mouth, he proves what an idiot he truly is!
1316685644580687872 2020-10-15 18:21:35 +0800 <cbpinky> I wish I could laugh at this. But sadly, it's far to honest. 😪
1316622777055612928 2020-10-15 14:11:46 +0800 <cbpinky> They all should sue him. Of course, he would tie it up the courts for years!

1315839067469352960 2020-10-13 10:17:35 +0800 <cbpinky> That's why he wants this rushed along. Just in case he looses. He'll have an ace in the hole.🤬

Jaime Harrison is a good man &amp; the one to replace Graham. He will represent all people from South Carolina &amp; our country. 🇺🇸
1315305583449440256 2020-10-11 22:57:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @shawbear76 Because I want him defeated by Jaime Harrison. Lindsey Graham is one of many of Trumps cronies. I also want McConnell to be defeated by Amy McGrath in KY. Why don't you? We need to replace those Republicans that supported trump &amp; not this country. 🇺🇸
1315301260384505856 2020-10-11 22:40:32 +0800 <cbpinky> That's BS! There have been people that have had this virus 2 times. So far, there is no immunity to this virus!

1314986707603927042 2020-10-11 01:50:37 +0800 <cbpinky> You bet they will. Trumpers think it's a Democratic hoax. Trump tells them it's all ok. He feels better than he has in 20 years!
1314986005066285056 2020-10-11 01:47:49 +0800 <cbpinky> Idiots! If they get the virus, it's no less than what they deserve! I feel sorry for the people they carry it to though. 🤬

1314702240909795328 2020-10-10 07:00:14 +0800 <cbpinky> Lindsey Graham, I believe you are the individual that is putting yourself above others. Jaime Harrison is the man that I'm supporting. He supports his people &amp; state. You support a traitorous potus that doesn't support the American people or our country!  Only himself! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1314680841591828483 2020-10-10 05:35:12 +0800 <cbpinky> He did indeed! Don't try to pretend he didn't agitate it!
1314680626755391488 2020-10-10 05:34:21 +0800 <cbpinky> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump He encouraged it. Remember, take back your state! How about  stand back, stand by. Oh yes, he is most definitely guilty of complicity! Don't pretend you're not aware of it. You do yourself a disservice pretending to be stupid.
1314679561678970880 2020-10-10 05:30:07 +0800 <cbpinky> Hillary Clinton isn't running for anything? She's been cleared. Can they not realize all the BS they are starting? Doesn't anyone care about what just happened to the Michigan Gov? Can a Republican not win an election without trashing &amp; lying about their opponent?

1314416432554348544 2020-10-09 12:04:32 +0800 <cbpinky> Good move!
1314334728309403655 2020-10-09 06:39:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @mymia59 @kyledcheney Don't be. I've never been as proud to be a Democrat as I have been since that idiot trump was elected!
1314307751229652992 2020-10-09 04:52:41 +0800 <cbpinky> Trumps always mentally unwell!
1314306142626099205 2020-10-09 04:46:17 +0800 <cbpinky> @mcbradoc @jilevin You're absolutely right. Trump has emboldened them with his bs rhetoric. He's stoked &amp; encouraged them.
1314301778746376193 2020-10-09 04:28:57 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂
1314301538169479174 2020-10-09 04:27:59 +0800 <cbpinky> @mcbradoc @jilevin From the info I heard on the news, they were hoping this would start a civil war. This is unbelievable.
1314256710157164546 2020-10-09 01:29:52 +0800 <cbpinky> You're right. Trump has encouraged this kind of crap. He has also emboldened his followers to do this. Militias, proud bois, kkk, boogaloo boys, they all back trump!
1314255128820682752 2020-10-09 01:23:35 +0800 <cbpinky> @fomobeast @MonicaLewinsky Obviously.
1314254948520153088 2020-10-09 01:22:52 +0800 <cbpinky> @Retirednurse5 With Rand Paul, he was probably serious. Nothing he says or does is shocking at this point!

1314253829639208960 2020-10-09 01:18:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Idiot!
1314253500927401984 2020-10-09 01:17:06 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet I kinda feel all those same ways HB. I'm thinking it's caused by the world we live in since trump became president! 🤬
1314198060667269120 2020-10-08 21:36:48 +0800 <cbpinky> @fomobeast @MonicaLewinsky Uh....whut? Were we watching the same debate dude?
1314197188289855492 2020-10-08 21:33:20 +0800 <cbpinky> 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1314196595789844480 2020-10-08 21:30:59 +0800 <cbpinky> They have no plan. All they are interested in is getting rid of Obama's ACA. Trump hates Obama so much that he wants to do away with any &amp; everything that's associated with Obama! That's all this is about.
1314195655359787008 2020-10-08 21:27:15 +0800 <cbpinky> @ArianaDMichaels Don't worry about typos. No one except the grammar police really waste time thinking about it. I always think they just have too much time on their hands. It happens to all of us at some point. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1314194229091086336 2020-10-08 21:21:35 +0800 <cbpinky> Wonder what medical info he doesn't want the American people to know? A president's health is important &amp; the American people should be alarmed that trump doesn't want us to know about his.

1314181712574853122 2020-10-08 20:31:51 +0800 <cbpinky> @TimOBrien So true Tim. Pence was so very rude with his interruptions to Harris, and his complete disregard to the moderator to stop talking. He consistently went well over his time constraints. It was so very irritating!

1314030720256536578 2020-10-08 10:31:51 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Absolutely!
1314030357881085952 2020-10-08 10:30:25 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Yes he does look like he does. He's being very rude too.
1314029506500452354 2020-10-08 10:27:02 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam She is letting Pence go way over on his time! Everytime!

1314028839958450182 2020-10-08 10:24:23 +0800 <cbpinky> Pence has a fly on his head right now.😂😂😂😂

It's a disgrace what this GOP Senate has let him do to America. They may pay the price for it in the election. I sure hope so!🇺🇸🤞🏻🙏
1313991290296692737 2020-10-08 07:55:11 +0800 <cbpinky> @LeeTielens @DC_Diva @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Trump came into a good situation. Economy doing well, insurance for pre-existing conditions, people had jobs. The country wasn't in shambles. Obama took care of Ebola without killing more than 200,000 Americans. Oh the good old days! I miss them &amp; Obama. Biden will fix it.

He's encouraged his idiot proud bois &amp; his maga/kkk followers to stand back, stand by! What the hell do you think that means! Are you truly that dumb?
1313981307576348673 2020-10-08 07:15:30 +0800 <cbpinky> @LeeTielens @bally_linde @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Some people are just to stupid to see what's in front of them.  It's funny how all this violence is on Obama/Biden, but this wasn't happening on their 8 yrs in office. I knew when trump was elected he would burn this country to the ground. And he's the one that's encouraging it!
1313913925507977221 2020-10-08 02:47:45 +0800 <cbpinky> @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn Marsha Blackburn? Are you kidding me? She's no winner here. She is your own personal brown nose sycophant!
1313912891515564033 2020-10-08 02:43:39 +0800 <cbpinky> I definitely agree. Why be in the orbit of someone who knowingly has covid19 &amp; certainly has no qualms about spreading it around to others?! 🤒😷

1313644205059825665 2020-10-07 08:55:59 +0800 <cbpinky> Melanie is no better than Stormy Daniels. She has pics posing in the nude. She hung with Epstein. We have no idea what she has done.  At least Stormy has been honest.

1313535256943906817 2020-10-07 01:43:04 +0800 <cbpinky> @MaxNordau As a matter of fact, I have received many DM's &amp; requests. Not that it's any of your business. By the way, do you just attack anyone that disagrees with you? Probably keeps you pretty busy I would imagine.
1313534325367988228 2020-10-07 01:39:22 +0800 <cbpinky> @musicandwhiskey @MaxNordau Don't worry. My scottie is as much a liberal as I am!

1312902426194833414 2020-10-05 07:48:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Biden should start running those ads again. Trump won't stop any of his!

1312581580792135680 2020-10-04 10:33:30 +0800 <cbpinky> You sold your soul for Trump Lindsey. In doing so, you sold out the USA! It may be time to pay that price.

1312577228128096257 2020-10-04 10:16:12 +0800 <cbpinky> Typical Republican bs!
1312534079762382848 2020-10-04 07:24:44 +0800 <cbpinky> Shows how much he really cares about anyone else's health. No big surprise to me! Trump is a truly selfish sob! America deserves better than this pos.

If she wasn't, she wouldn't have been supporting him. Or with him to begin with! She's not a nice person &amp; certainly not a classy first lady, as I've read from others!

1311660612213108739 2020-10-01 21:33:54 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @GrannyLaurel Me either. After trump insulted his "unattractive wife," Cruz has absolutely brown nosed his way into trump's good graces. What an idiot!

I missed that press conference today. I'm not falling for it. In his way, he's telling them to create civil unrest in the streets if he looses. He's terrified of it because he's facing some prison time when all is said &amp; done!

Biden did say those terrible things but he has also apologized for them. Many of those things were said many years ago when things were very different times here in the US. Doesn't make it right, but he has apologized. 🇺🇸
1311395518959030276 2020-10-01 04:00:30 +0800 <cbpinky> Nope!

1311152415782076416 2020-09-30 11:54:30 +0800 <cbpinky> Disgusting!
1311151726314115072 2020-09-30 11:51:46 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump would not condemn white supremacists. He said he would, but all he said was for them to stand back &amp; stand by. He is encouraging them to civil war. When he looses the election, he has given his supporters the go ahead to start it!🤬
1311148618829754368 2020-09-30 11:39:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Yeah, don't we know it! That sorry SOB just told his white supremacists base to stand by. He would not condemn them!🤬

1311117315682037760 2020-09-30 09:35:02 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump has no intention of debating. He just wants to interrupt &amp; scream to deflect from his bullshit! He has no plans to even let Biden finish anything he wants to say.
1311114551237193728 2020-09-30 09:24:03 +0800 <cbpinky> That's all he's got. Temper tantrums &amp; yelling. Interrupting &amp; lying.

1310738524077989890 2020-09-29 08:29:51 +0800 <cbpinky> They just keep telling more ridiculous &amp; made up stories trying to stoke the maga/kkk crowd!
1310709168383328258 2020-09-29 06:33:12 +0800 <cbpinky> Oh, big surprise here!
1310708565238263815 2020-09-29 06:30:48 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump is the one needing the drug test. He's the one that is mostly incoherent, blurry eyed, &amp; makes no sense most of the time! Biden takes his time to think what he has to say &amp; doesn't just ramble &amp; bullshit his way through. IMO, I think it is related to his childhood stutter.
1310697585448030213 2020-09-29 05:47:10 +0800 <cbpinky> @e_whittler I'm so sorry Donald. Sorry you had to grow up feeling that fear.

1309874266968600576 2020-09-26 23:15:36 +0800 <cbpinky> @ellenskinner @RonSarkar I'm going to. I'm going to imagine all my Twitter buds there with me. Having my back &amp; making snarky remarks right back at 'em! 😘🇺🇸

1309846238561525762 2020-09-26 21:24:13 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar I've decided that I'm masking up, keeping my distance, &amp; going as soon as early voting starts in my state.

1309684473693376512 2020-09-26 10:41:25 +0800 <cbpinky> It's not just you Grandma. She has been completely useless. When I hear Republicans talk about her being the classiest 1st lady ever, it just makes me burst out laughing when I see nude pictures of her prior to all her plastic surgery. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1309662707713536004 2020-09-26 09:14:56 +0800 <cbpinky> @davidmweissman @guitarderwood Sorry you had to learn this hard lesson after he became potus. Now you know. You can now do your part to undo &amp; fix your previous vote. Please help bring back our beloved nation. #VoteBidenHarris2020
1309661199039168513 2020-09-26 09:08:56 +0800 <cbpinky> That's why we must vote in massive numbers. Then he can't deny he was defeated! Trump is sowing the seeds of doubt right now. As per his usual, it's lies. Of course, his magas will believe him. #VoteHimOut2020

1309654346171322368 2020-09-26 08:41:42 +0800 <cbpinky> Perhaps he should have really thought through being trumps lapdog. Not a good look for him. His best friend, John McCain was completely trashed by trump. That certainly doesn't speak well of his loyalty. He sold out McCain, then the USA to suck up to trump!#VoteJaimeHarrisonSC
1309651138841632776 2020-09-26 08:28:58 +0800 <cbpinky> Nope. Not me.
1309650177989447681 2020-09-26 08:25:09 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes, it's awful he has to deliver pizza to survive. Unfortunately, if Trump, McConnell &amp; the rest of the GOP aren't defeated in the election, it's going to get even worse for many more seniors as they are planning  cuts to Social Security &amp; Medicare both. #VoteBidenHarris
1309647857004220416 2020-09-26 08:15:55 +0800 <cbpinky> NO!

1308923554155687936 2020-09-24 08:17:48 +0800 <cbpinky> Is this what's also ahead for the USA if Trump &amp; Republicans are re-elected? Seems like they've already started in some places!
1308922067958607873 2020-09-24 08:11:54 +0800 <cbpinky> @RVHoyos @VoteGloriaJ Got my vote!

1308831124945342464 2020-09-24 02:10:31 +0800 <cbpinky> Thank you Dr. Fauci for putting that wise-ass in his place! I understand why his neighbor kicked his ass!

1308721448165535750 2020-09-23 18:54:42 +0800 <cbpinky> No surprise here. Trump will forever be involved with Russia &amp; Putin. He admires Putin &amp; would or will treat Americans the same way as Putin treats Russian citizens if he's re-elected &amp; allowed to. Trump has nothing to lose if he gets another term!

1308580366089965568 2020-09-23 09:34:06 +0800 <cbpinky> I signed Jon Stewart's petition to help veterans suffering from exposure to burn pit toxins. Please sign it, too.  https://t.co/rCXhLArBi3

1308578373761982464 2020-09-23 09:26:11 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet You're right Hb. I'm not giving up without doing my best to vote out that dipshit, trump! Keep preaching it! Sometimes I need a kick in the butt too, &amp; I can always count on one from you! 🇺🇸 thanks my friend 👍

1308519484861435904 2020-09-23 05:32:10 +0800 <cbpinky> Or it could be that trump voters are just really stupid &amp; possibly didn't maintain the boats!
1308518663566303233 2020-09-23 05:28:55 +0800 <cbpinky> But, is he saying he won't support a vote, or not? I bet he will. He's loyal to trump &amp; his GOP!
1308518217338564610 2020-09-23 05:27:08 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam It's bad enough here with all the maga/kkk, white nationalists &amp; their racist bullshit. Trump is one of them. He encourages the racism &amp; the violence.   Don't let them invade your country too. Those of us who disagree with them are working hard to get our country back!
1308516675457896448 2020-09-23 05:21:01 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @chipfranklin Nailed it!
1308516462831849475 2020-09-23 05:20:10 +0800 <cbpinky> @ehananoki @pamfromkam Yep, Republicans would always prefer keeping the baby. Then give it no medical care or decent food to eat. Keep them in poverty &amp; never attempt to give them a better life!
1308514900512313345 2020-09-23 05:13:57 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet True HB! We can't t be so negative. We must stay vigilant. This is our country too! I understand getting down &amp; frustrated, but I will never stop fighting for my country! America deserves better than what trump &amp; his Republican party is doing to her!🇺🇸🇺🇸🗽
1308510852392329216 2020-09-23 04:57:52 +0800 <cbpinky> I thought we were supposed to separate church &amp; state. Is she able to do that?

1308201273242591238 2020-09-22 08:27:43 +0800 <cbpinky> It only applies to when they are talking about Democrats though. Never to Republicans. They seem to be immune to anything even remotely honest touching them!
1308175567112503296 2020-09-22 06:45:34 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet Why is it we let 1 negative comment upset us when the rest are positive? I thought it was just me! 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️

I too have lost friends because of my beliefs. I'm not interested in being a trump &amp; his kind of Christian supporter! To bad they only care about an unborn child. Once born, they don't.

Truly a sad situation when the potus not only encourages violence, but actually enjoys it. This is just not acceptable in USA.
1307644103899983878 2020-09-20 19:33:43 +0800 <cbpinky> It won't make any difference! Trust me. It won't. We're talking about Lindsey Graham.

1307372867995283459 2020-09-20 01:35:56 +0800 <cbpinky> @SwampWi68671152 It would depend on what her record of voting would be. However, I don't think that will happen. I'm afraid it will be a very conservative male.

1307167251725004800 2020-09-19 11:58:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @MichaelCoudrey @SenSchumer McConnell has already stated the Senate was prepared to vote if trump selected a nominee. It's not just Schumer.
1307166924225359872 2020-09-19 11:57:35 +0800 <cbpinky> @ElizabethKlave3 @SenSchumer This may be to soon in our opinions, but Mitch McConnell already stated that the Senate would vote on trumps nominee. RBG dictated her wishes to her granddaughter stating she would like the decision to be made by the president after the election. Seems cold, but it's politics.
1307036778470289409 2020-09-19 03:20:26 +0800 <cbpinky> @TankSchottle Great message Tank! Keep doing what you do. We love you!💖

1307034210931273732 2020-09-19 03:10:14 +0800 <cbpinky> I don't understand why he keeps getting re-elected! McConnell hasn't done anything for his own state. All he has done is succeed at filling his very own deep pockets!

1306948512685469698 2020-09-18 21:29:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Evidently pretty stupid. Or just selfish &amp; didn't care!

1306684579982512128 2020-09-18 04:00:55 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @grandmagrit @chipfranklin Yes probably around then or by the end of the year. Even if it was finished by the end of this year, it would still need time for testing. Does he really think were so stupid that we'd just start lining up to take it? Never mind, yes he's that stupid.😉 Wish I was kidding.
1306683017054781441 2020-09-18 03:54:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @FernandoMcDuff @chipfranklin 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1306682314995519489 2020-09-18 03:51:55 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @grandmagrit @chipfranklin That's true. Vaccines usually take years to develop but trump thinks it will be ready before the election. I want to see him &amp; his family take it first. I'll just keep wearing my mask for now.
1306671654496600064 2020-09-18 03:09:33 +0800 <cbpinky> Absolutely!
1306670021641461763 2020-09-18 03:03:04 +0800 <cbpinky> Hmm. Imagine that. Don't you wonder why?
1306669841772929025 2020-09-18 03:02:21 +0800 <cbpinky> @grandmagrit @chipfranklin I'm not taking it. It's been rushed along so trump can use it as an election bump &amp; I don't think it's been tested thoroughly. Therefore, it's not safe!
1306668023609204740 2020-09-18 02:55:08 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet Sorry HB. Yes, that stuff is icky!  https://t.co/F09P9LD9zc

1306303619961155594 2020-09-17 02:47:07 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam We didn't stay shut down long enough in the beginning. If business would have stayed closed &amp; people stayed home, it wouldn't have gotten so bad. Plus our potus lied from the beginning &amp; withheld vital information. He knew this virus was coming months in advance &amp; did nothing!
1306302773294751745 2020-09-17 02:43:45 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam You are right again my friend.
1306275879274901506 2020-09-17 00:56:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam Yes. I've got lots of them in my area too. Way to many. Like a mask is going to harm someone! If they won't accept it by now, they aren't going to ever get it!

1306271176587653120 2020-09-17 00:38:12 +0800 <cbpinky> Unbelievable! Doesn't anyone read a book anymore? Or at least watch a documentary?
1306047830465875969 2020-09-16 09:50:42 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam You are so right. I honestly don't see how anyone could vote for him with the sad state this country is in right now.
1306039260991172608 2020-09-16 09:16:39 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam I wish I could answer that. I don't know how anyone could think he's even a decent man let alone, president of US. This country hasn't been this divided in my lifetime. He encourages it &amp; he wants violence. I fear he will declare martial law &amp; cancel the election. Terrifying. 🤬

They want to keep so much BS going that we just don't pay attention so they can continue with all of the illegal &amp; treasonous crimes that they are complicit in. We must continue to call it out &amp; speak out about it.  And #VoteForBiden
1305989312769654785 2020-09-16 05:58:10 +0800 <cbpinky> But not surprised. FB has let all kinds of lies &amp; deceit be posted &amp; done nothing. I don't even look at it anymore.  Haven't in a few years &amp; it has gotten even worse. Unfortunately, many people believe any &amp; everything  they read on there. Big Mistake!

1305889971400773632 2020-09-15 23:23:26 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump is inciting his followers to violence with these kind of tweets. That's what he wants! Then he can declare martial law. Don't fall for it!
1305858531489447936 2020-09-15 21:18:30 +0800 <cbpinky> @SwampWi68671152 I'm right there with you. I'm scared to death of what will happen to this country if he's re-elected. USA will never recover if he is! I've never agreed with Republicans, but I have never been terrified for our country like I am now. Trump is dangerous &amp; tied to Russia.

1304970109090508801 2020-09-13 10:28:13 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump seems stoned out of his head, &amp; doesn't appear to even  know the words, while the bought &amp; paid for wife doesn't even open her mouth &amp; doesn't want to be there! How disrespectful.

1304841424278609921 2020-09-13 01:56:52 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @yokoboji @rohaniroop Dogs are special. Love them.
1304840476244283395 2020-09-13 01:53:06 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @yokoboji @rohaniroop It sure doesn't! I can't tell you how many times my cats got me when I was a little girl. I wanted to carry them &amp; love on them all the time. When they had enough,  they put me on notice very quickly. 😜😂😂😂 Now I'm a dog lover!👌😂
1304839261468975106 2020-09-13 01:48:17 +0800 <cbpinky> Good question. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1304838838758584325 2020-09-13 01:46:36 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @yokoboji @rohaniroop MEOW!! I don't like being on camera! You know that!🐱🐈
1304837944793010176 2020-09-13 01:43:03 +0800 <cbpinky> That's putting it nicely. I'm just going to say she's a true dumbass trump following racist!
1304837265055768577 2020-09-13 01:40:21 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump &amp; all Republicans that excused his treasonous acts &amp; let him off the hook should all be out on their asses at the earliest time. IMO, they are all traitors to our country &amp; its citizens! They have let 200,000 people die. We should have been told the truth in the beginning.
1304794616210821126 2020-09-12 22:50:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @TomthunkitsMind @guitarderwood Good for you Tom. I'm with you. I lost my friend of 40 years for the same thing. I don't care what party you are in, country over party any &amp; every time! I'm a new follower btw. #RidenWithBidenHarris2o20

1304789893042917384 2020-09-12 22:32:06 +0800 <cbpinky> Great for Canada! They have an intelligent leader that cares for the Canadian people. The US. Not at all. Our president doesn't care if we all die!
1304782943643197440 2020-09-12 22:04:30 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump should have just simply told the American people the truth. That's it. That's all.
1304782199321964552 2020-09-12 22:01:32 +0800 <cbpinky> @JuliansRum @morningmika Oh bullshit.

That is absolutely awesome &amp; I'm so happy &amp; proud for you.Thank you for keeping us posted on how you're doing. I've followed your progress &amp; I'm rooting for you everyday. Keep up the good work my friend. Sending love &amp; strength.
1304771143417634819 2020-09-12 21:17:36 +0800 <cbpinky> @psrmiami @RonSarkar Because you can't live on unemployment alone. It's only meant to be a temporary aid until you can find work. And what if there is no work?
1304770570941345793 2020-09-12 21:15:20 +0800 <cbpinky> @pergolaman @RonSarkar @lehimesa Yes, they need help &amp; food. No bullying. So sad.
1304599383825154049 2020-09-12 09:55:06 +0800 <cbpinky> Great!

1304591266899021824 2020-09-12 09:22:50 +0800 <cbpinky> @FakeNewsHuntres @NumbersMuncher Don't forget. Hillary Clinton always lead in the polls too. As crooked as trump is, you know he will be doing all kinds of illegal things &amp; encouraging Russian interference! We can't get complacent. #VoteBidenHarris2020

He projects every criminal act he does onto anyone that opposes him. I honestly have no doubts that trump is a full blown addict. He sweats like crazy all the time. Check his eyes. He's literally had white powder under his nose.
1304511294054293504 2020-09-12 04:05:03 +0800 <cbpinky> 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼I hope &amp; pray it continues &amp; more people will have enough of trump. I'm hoping people will see that Biden is indeed a good man. No not perfect, but he truly cares about this country &amp; its people. If Trump is re-elected, Putin will be outright running this country.
1304478892762320899 2020-09-12 01:56:18 +0800 <cbpinky> What an ass!
1304477435187138560 2020-09-12 01:50:31 +0800 <cbpinky> What a total dumbass!
1304476478936150016 2020-09-12 01:46:43 +0800 <cbpinky> @jerilynn_johns @bryanbehar Unbelievable isn't it? I don't understand why anyone would even want him in office at this point. Sadly, I continue to SMH in amazement.

1304467553876664323 2020-09-12 01:11:15 +0800 <cbpinky> A man with class &amp; compassion.
1304467107590090754 2020-09-12 01:09:28 +0800 <cbpinky> Biden has class &amp; compassion for his fellow man.
1304466486162059264 2020-09-12 01:07:00 +0800 <cbpinky> @SpiroAgnewGhost @pamfromkam Absolutely. He can't even refrain from being a low class buffoon even on this day of remembrance.

1304187372230377477 2020-09-11 06:37:54 +0800 <cbpinky> @realDonaldTrump And why should we Americans care what happens to this brutal dictator that has murdered so many of his own people? Oh, I forgot. That's how you want to be too.🖕🖕🖕
1304185655275204608 2020-09-11 06:31:05 +0800 <cbpinky> Correct!👍👍👍

1304184100937400327 2020-09-11 06:24:54 +0800 <cbpinky> He could care less how many Americans die on his watch. Trump's the cause of the majority of the deaths!
1304183043280822272 2020-09-11 06:20:42 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes. But no answer. Then more lies to continue covering his own ass!
1304181549739520005 2020-09-11 06:14:46 +0800 <cbpinky> He's lying.

1304162847094640640 2020-09-11 05:00:27 +0800 <cbpinky> Indeed they did!
1304162151414804481 2020-09-11 04:57:41 +0800 <cbpinky> Just shows how stupid &amp; childish his behavior truly is!
1304161516921532419 2020-09-11 04:55:10 +0800 <cbpinky> Oh come on! Woodward would make a huge improvement as president. He couldn't do as badly as trump if he tried!
1304150061035782145 2020-09-11 04:09:39 +0800 <cbpinky> Not nearly soon enough!
1304149744462319620 2020-09-11 04:08:23 +0800 <cbpinky> @Acyn A terrible question? I think it's awesome! Trump still couldn't answer honestly? I'm so sick of all his BS. I hate just hearing his voice.
1304148176337801216 2020-09-11 04:02:09 +0800 <cbpinky> That's exactly what he is saying!
1304147753677791232 2020-09-11 04:00:29 +0800 <cbpinky> All his usual lies! Who didn't see this coming today? Get him off the TV! Cut him off now!
1304147124909637632 2020-09-11 03:57:59 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @realDonaldTrump He's still lying. He can't open his mouth without lies just rolling off his tongue! Trump is pathetic! He's getting worse everyday!
1304146581353095173 2020-09-11 03:55:49 +0800 <cbpinky> Don't worry Mr. President. I'm not giving you any credit! You deserve none. You have let almost 200,000 die. You're a flat out liar! Those dead are on you. You are derelict in taking care of your country &amp; it's citizens. Bob Woodward isn't the president. You are.
1304144770021941251 2020-09-11 03:48:37 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @realDonaldTrump I loathe him. He's the dictator wannabe! Not Biden. Trump &amp; his maga followers want the rest of us to shut up &amp; say nothing. We aren't good Americans. We're supposedly the socialist they keep talking about trying to scare everyone. Trump has sold this country out many times over!
1304143403735822338 2020-09-11 03:43:11 +0800 <cbpinky> @HellBentVet I'm sorry HB. My thoughts are with you &amp; all affected. 😢💖

1304141669605007360 2020-09-11 03:36:18 +0800 <cbpinky> And why would he save his ass after he killed an American citizen?!! Just asking!
1304141284815364098 2020-09-11 03:34:46 +0800 <cbpinky> @MarshaBlackburn You're disgusting. You represent my state. You should be concerned about this country! You shouldn't be worried about protecting a traitor to the US. Hope you go down with trump when he finally has to answer for his treasonous acts!

Just keep your head buried in the sand. You will see what a treasonous, unscrupulous, evil man he is at sometime. Hope it won't be to late for this country! Bye!

1303804496489984000 2020-09-10 05:16:30 +0800 <cbpinky> Yes, definitely.
1303804205241696256 2020-09-10 05:15:20 +0800 <cbpinky> Remember, Republican Senator Kennedy is one of trump's GOP sycophants. Who's going to believe anything he says anyway?
1303803275381223425 2020-09-10 05:11:39 +0800 <cbpinky> @FordJohnathan5 @HerbArndt @CNN Yes, except Nixon didn't kill  200,000 Americans.

The American taxpayers should not have to foot this bill! Especially since I believe everything that  E. Jean Carroll says trump did to her.🤬
1303760259354374146 2020-09-10 02:20:43 +0800 <cbpinky> @amandacarpenter @pamfromkam But yet, Cruz &amp; Rubio, plus the rest of the GOP continue to fear him &amp; suck up to him!
1303758952602177536 2020-09-10 02:15:31 +0800 <cbpinky> Absolutely. And the GOP won't do anything to stop him!

1303371622515179520 2020-09-09 00:36:24 +0800 <cbpinky> That's one of our own crooked politicians from Tennessee.  Trumpy keeps trying to pin crooked on Democrats, but Blackburn is one of his biggest supporters &amp; she's as bad as trump.

1302396326769033218 2020-09-06 08:00:56 +0800 <cbpinky> I believe her. We've seen how he treated LC Alexander Vindman for being honest &amp; doing his job!

1302385726433243136 2020-09-06 07:18:48 +0800 <cbpinky> @NewJeffCT I would too if he had said it recently. However, it's years old &amp; he's had a change of heart. Lindsey still is sucking up to trump. Trump doesn't care for the military. He's not done anything that he professes he has for them! As with everything else, he lied.
1302384046698385408 2020-09-06 07:12:08 +0800 <cbpinky> This certainly speaks for her character. She has to see just how important this election truly is. She's an amazing American that cares about her country.

Every Republican in Senate &amp; Congress covered for &amp; stuck up for trump (save Romney) &amp; I will be happy if each &amp; every one of them are eventually voted out &amp; replaced with (preferably) Democrats or a Republican that is honest &amp; decent!

1302291418241732608 2020-09-06 01:04:04 +0800 <cbpinky> Yeh, we already know he's an asshole. Trump's always been an asshole. If that's how he refers to our POWs, MIAs, &amp; deceased soldiers, he has no business being President! Disrespecting &amp; dishonoring our soldiers goes way beyond just being an asshole.  #TrumpHatesOurVeterans

1302287419623051264 2020-09-06 00:48:10 +0800 <cbpinky> He doesn't care! Not one little bit. Trump hasn't given one thought to the people that are sick or dead.
1302285188542664706 2020-09-06 00:39:18 +0800 <cbpinky> @pamfromkam @realDonaldTrump Exactly Pam. My personal style is to want his ass kicked to the curb &amp; into prison where he &amp; his family all belong! Along with his cronies in the GOP. Whether or not he's on camera, it's disrespectful to all military personnel the way he speaks &amp; behaves. He only dishonors them.

1302236762601857024 2020-09-05 21:26:53 +0800 <cbpinky> @PaMars21 @MeghanMcCain Not all anonymous. You're having to work hard to try to disprove what trump says even though we've so often heard him speak such disparagingly words about so many people. Why would I doubt it now?

1302043189885493248 2020-09-05 08:37:41 +0800 <cbpinky> @PaMars21 @MeghanMcCain More than 1 witness says he did. I'm more than willing to believe them given his firing of LC Vindman &amp; how his treatment to anyone who disagrees with him.
1301992987866562565 2020-09-05 05:18:12 +0800 <cbpinky> @PaMars21 @MeghanMcCain You are out of your mind! This isn't just about John McCain, although Trump has been terribly insulting to &amp; about him. This is about all the other POWs &amp; brave soldiers who lost their lives while sacrificing for the USA &amp; Trump insulting them &amp; having such low regard for them!
1301948538474180608 2020-09-05 02:21:35 +0800 <cbpinky> He sold his soul to Donald Trump!
1301948039075160064 2020-09-05 02:19:36 +0800 <cbpinky> I remember this only to well.
1301856091173777409 2020-09-04 20:14:14 +0800 <cbpinky> Trump is scrambling trying to deny disparaging remarks about our military. Saying he'll swear on whatever or whoever (it's a bible) that he didn't say it. We heard what he said about John McCain. Know how LC Vindman was treated. Putin's bounties on our soldiers. Lies. He said it.
1301851624059604992 2020-09-04 19:56:29 +0800 <cbpinky> @RonSarkar A new day for success. Very happy &amp; proud of you. I know it's not always easy, but you're doing it. 🙏👍💕

1301625915768799233 2020-09-04 04:59:36 +0800 <cbpinky> But remember Scoot, trumpy said that the shooter was being attacked. I didn't see any of that. That kid went across state lines with gun..and he did it to commit murder! This was a premeditated act. He should be charged as an adult. His parents should face charges too.
1301623856596168715 2020-09-04 04:51:25 +0800 <cbpinky> Yuck. I'll pass.
1301622123178401792 2020-09-04 04:44:31 +0800 <cbpinky> Is this for real? If so, it answers a lot of questions for me.🤔🤔
1301620212391911425 2020-09-04 04:36:56 +0800 <cbpinky> She's good. We need reporters who will hold trumps feet to the fire &amp; not let up like she did. Of course, he just stomps off when they try.
1301590241967472640 2020-09-04 02:37:50 +0800 <cbpinky> He's probably stoned.
1301588910099836936 2020-09-04 02:32:33 +0800 <cbpinky> @CourtrightLynda I bet you're right. Wish he would let it all out for all of us to see it for ourselves.

1300784381938798593 2020-09-01 21:15:38 +0800 <cbpinky> Absolutely not. Everything is only going to get worse with trump. Everything. He's stoking the fires &amp; encouraging his magats to violence against peaceful protesters. While telling us how bad things are going to be if Biden is elected. This is all on trumps watch. NOT Bidens.
