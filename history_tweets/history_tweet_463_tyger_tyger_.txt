1329713069765910531 2020-11-20 17:07:55 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @NeeJean719 @SummrWrites We have to take back the definitions and ignore the destructive cultural ones. And always remember that biblical justice emphasizes mercy, humility, and faithfulness in God, something "woke justice" does not.
1329695903922446336 2020-11-20 15:59:42 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @tarphius Valentine's Day to November 20. Just saying.
1329693557091950594 2020-11-20 15:50:23 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @melanemoia Matt Walsh on Halloween  https://t.co/CV9hCO9SNm

1329670696981684225 2020-11-20 14:19:32 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> I should start blaming my major personal failures on misogyny. I guess I never thought to do that before because I'm not a feminist.
1329668716041297920 2020-11-20 14:11:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @kamranpasha @katheroony @NatureComms But that would require some actual work and thoughtfulness, not just a buzzword-laden whiny tweet.
1329667787879542785 2020-11-20 14:07:59 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit Yep. Celebrities are just messed up, e.g. here's Sarah Paulson with her "lover," not her mother (32 years between them):  https://t.co/NdKobcG3ta
1329665792619782146 2020-11-20 14:00:03 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @therealmissjo This is absolutely vile. Parents of trans preschoolers have Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
1329664079452102656 2020-11-20 13:53:15 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit Her partner is 62 years old and obese. I can't stomach Maddow for long enough to watch this entire video, but I doubt she mentioned that important info.
1329658641050443783 2020-11-20 13:31:38 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @crewlguy @EntrepreneurVyl Didn't *two* of his accusers mysteriously die?
1329657963146076160 2020-11-20 13:28:56 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BraveTheWorld Lol, yes.   Also, whenever I look at equivalent, near-identical men's and women's toiletry products on Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they either cost the same or the *men's* products cost more. The "pink tax" is just more unsubstantiated whining to make lazy feminism seem relevant.  https://t.co/sC5Wfwsm6A

1329633332636897283 2020-11-20 11:51:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @GayHateAlliance Probably some Ellis Island switcheroo.
1329631689396674562 2020-11-20 11:44:32 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @GayHateAlliance Just "arbitrarily" add some negative adjectives and everyone will believe your BS.

1329516655932805122 2020-11-20 04:07:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @GayHateAlliance Postsecondary education is absolutely not a human right.

1329509894265991169 2020-11-20 03:40:34 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> The state thinks it owns your kids and that autonomous, mindful parenting is "authoritarian." Mind you, these are the same lunatics who wring their hands over Handmaid's Tale and salivate over abortion.
1329505862084423681 2020-11-20 03:24:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Luzgar27775917 I don't need scientific studies to understand that a counterfeit, self-indulgent life is not fulfilling or enriching.  Hormones affect mood to an extent, that's obvious. But women are sad and bitter for many reasons beyond physiology. Bad ideology (feminism) leads to bad results.

1329504105782521858 2020-11-20 03:17:34 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Lots of white Americans believe we deserve the fate of the Boers, if not worse.
1329503644757135361 2020-11-20 03:15:44 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN The fact that these insane reactions were triggered by valid criticism of a veritable spinster trying to brainwash young women into believing pizza, wine, and purse dogs are as meaningful as marriage/children says it ALL. They're desperately unhappy but too immature to change.
1329497368270606339 2020-11-20 02:50:48 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @simongwynn @ggreenwald What "wild untruths," lol? Kids in cages, drone strikes, endless wars, entrenched corporatism, censorship? (&lt;-Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama and now Biden.)
1329489741851611145 2020-11-20 02:20:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @PetiteNicoco And remember, women have always been the primary victims of war. 🤡

1329478222594125828 2020-11-20 01:34:43 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SpiritedSparr0w Math is subjective.  Objectivity is biased.

1329468286065586177 2020-11-20 00:55:14 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @antihero_kate Oh, and I also voted for Obama twice like a chump.   And gee, I wonder why people are passionate about 2A after reading slop like "you need to be put in a reeducation camp if you dare disagree with me." Delusional.
1329467915259826178 2020-11-20 00:53:45 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @antihero_kate "Deprogram" what? I voted Trump in 2016 without watching a second of Fox News, without having a Facebook account. I can cogently explain why. These smug leftist journos really think we're all halfwitted mouth-breathers while they're latter-day delicate geniuses. Eff off, David.

Before the Great Trans Subversion that's physically and psychologically damaging thousands of young people, pronouns were obvious based on someone's name and picture. Stop being disingenuous, you old soul.

"Equity" at work. It's cruel and abusive.

Many are doing similar. Some go above and beyond, but certainly nowhere close to all.

1329192879575752706 2020-11-19 06:40:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MarinaMedvin Parents should form local "banned books" reading clubs for themselves and their kids. Then again, many parents in LA probably support this garbage censorship.
1329192480957456385 2020-11-19 06:39:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @PatriarchPrimus They deny what abortion is, even if you show them. They also deny that abortionists perform third-trimester abortions for healthy mothers with healthy babies, even as abortionists like Warren Hern tell them that is the case. It's raw insanity.
1329191528191946758 2020-11-19 06:35:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @conservmillen Imagine the uproar on Twitter if the article was The Last Children of Autism.
1329190872223780873 2020-11-19 06:32:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @PetiteNicoco It's impossible to socialize with people wearing masks who are standing six+ feet away. I attended a party where a woman did that and it was awkward and pointless; I couldn't talk to her or read her expression. People this paranoid just need to stay home and skip the holidays.
1329189897152946180 2020-11-19 06:29:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaganeMeow Canceling college debt will not significantly redistribute money, lol. And most people whining about it will continue to rent overpriced apartments in overrated urban centers, maybe shift to Uber Eats deliveries over ramen. They aren't going to buy houses or become productive.
1329189100927246341 2020-11-19 06:25:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @GayHateAlliance Brb, gotta vote against TLOUII.
1329187860465987594 2020-11-19 06:20:55 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaganeMeow As if communism-lite that's currently being pushed on us isn't exploitive and destructive. Yes, end the wars; stop immigration. We still need people to do hard labor and menial work.  The people whining about student debt are not the exploited ones. They are lazy and indulgent.
1329186949970735109 2020-11-19 06:17:18 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @emswingo Yeah, I experienced a huge shift in my thinking and am now pro-life. I used to be ignorant/apathetic about abortion and didn't consider how absolutely evil and ghoulish it is due to its normalization in our society. The propaganda works on naive, undiscerning young women. 😔
1329186204793909249 2020-11-19 06:14:20 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN (((Actually autistic and pro-vaccine))), lmao. The jokes just write themselves on twitter dot com.
1329183700999921664 2020-11-19 06:04:24 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @emswingo I did have to walk away from a friend who called my husband a child murderer and neocon(?) for being pro-2A. Of course this same person is vehemently pro-abortion.
1329183091613716491 2020-11-19 06:01:58 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @EntrepreneurVyl They want everyone to be some bland, indeterminate shade of light brown with slightly curly hair. However, there will still be "racism," stereotyping, and hierarchies even if that happens.
1329182602889228293 2020-11-19 06:00:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaganeMeow Eh, capitalism is only "extremely exploitive" in the US for people who think they're too good to work and who have a crippling lack of maturity/no sense of responsibility. Many should work modest jobs and live in the Midwest, not earn useless degrees and move to $$$ major cities.
1329180347599384578 2020-11-19 05:51:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KenudaTwitch You draw and/or enjoy detailed, fetishistic pictures of anthropomorphized animals' genitalia. No one cares what you think about *anything.*
1329028200408772610 2020-11-18 19:46:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Lol, one time a kid threw up all over the annual standardized test booklet and scantron, and he didn't have to take it bc each student could only be issued one.
1329025407350431745 2020-11-18 19:35:23 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Lets_DiscussYT @RealCandaceO Lmao, I guess you've missed the last five years of insane, destructive gender ideology that's ended up with literal children on body- and mind-ruining puberty blockers and hormones and performing in drag for perverted adults.   "It's just a dude in a dress. No agenda here!" 🙄
1329023954615480320 2020-11-18 19:29:37 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AJA_Cortes What should a woman ideally eat before and after working out?

1329021908042608642 2020-11-18 19:21:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @lisaneef1 @hehatestoseeit If your son doesn't speak those languages/isn't going to learn them conversationally, I fail to see how "everyone speaks a different language at home" is inherently valuable or helps him connect, lol. It sounds like you put diversity on a pedestal for no real reason. Mindless.
1329017568930246659 2020-11-18 19:04:15 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @GayHateAlliance I would have so many dislikes from "the trans community." 🥰
1329016293434023936 2020-11-18 18:59:10 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CarlWorsham And why did Obama buy a house on Martha's Vineyard?

You know what's *really* fashy? Hardcore, unyielding, unscientific gender ideology that tramples women's rights and privacy as well as established biological principles and common sense for the sake of a few invasive weirdos. Gross.
1329010750665469952 2020-11-18 18:37:09 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @laura_29lo @Philosophi_Cat Good to know. 4000€ a year is certainly not "free." You can attend certain public state schools in the US for that amount or close to it.

And why do sex and gender match within nearly 100% of people? And why should society, science, and identity be redefined based on extreme outliers who are mentally "distressed" and "incongruent" per the DSM?  CiTaTiOn NeEdEd

That sex chromosomes, the SRY gene, primary/secondary sex characteristics, hormones, brain differences exist? That real dysphoria is exceedingly rare? Uh, OK.  Also, if TAs value biology and medicine so much, why is "truscum" an idea/slur? 🤔  So disingenuous!

1328996108635344896 2020-11-18 17:38:58 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> Lmao, and despite my name/pic, I am NOT a furry. 🤮
1328995831282872323 2020-11-18 17:37:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> Imagine being a furry and thinking you're the moral authority or arbiter of truth on literally anything.

1328991211273777152 2020-11-18 17:19:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts I was blocked?? I guess I WIN.

You actually believe that, lmao! Read Gregory Smithers' scholarship and get some clarity. You're embarrassing yourself.
1328988761485680641 2020-11-18 17:09:46 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @LynxSwedish @bronzeswords1 @forevershallon @CritFacts @smamflinders @Emma_A_Webb Gee, I don't know. Probably all of human history until the last five years wherein science became wholly usurped by bizarre, harmful, irrational woke ideology.
1328988316260323329 2020-11-18 17:08:00 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts @andrew_bogg Oh, I understand, lol. I simply don't agree and don't condone, as is my right (for now, at least). That's what you don't seem to understand.
1328987877716463618 2020-11-18 17:06:16 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts But fetishizing animals and rendering sexual, pornographic images of animal likenesses should be thought crimes, just like bigotry. Unpopular thoughts are bad and deserve punishment. Gotta play by your own rules to be consistent, you know?
1328987103489830918 2020-11-18 17:03:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts @andrew_bogg "Karma" I "deserve"? Why do you wish harm on me? Is this a threat?
1328986898577186816 2020-11-18 17:02:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts @andrew_bogg What a cute idea. Maybe one day "scientists" can eradicate the Y chromosome and the SRY gene altogether! 🤡
1328985791176040449 2020-11-18 16:57:58 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts @andrew_bogg That's nice. I hope you find an abusive bigot and force that person to "make amends"--or else. 🥰
1328984996485410816 2020-11-18 16:54:49 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts @andrew_bogg I don't hate anyone. Do you?
1328984628066213888 2020-11-18 16:53:21 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @andrew_bogg @CritFacts Sorry you hate real women so much. I don't talk to misogynists, so good day.
1328984374910574593 2020-11-18 16:52:20 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts "The furry fandom actually ejects pedophiles."  As if zoophiles have standards. 🤮
1328983785996775424 2020-11-18 16:50:00 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @andrew_bogg @CritFacts Same vibe, utter nonsense:  https://t.co/OBy6TXucUA
1328983459902185472 2020-11-18 16:48:42 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts The entertainment industry full of perverts and pedos? I'm shocked!
1328983114174128128 2020-11-18 16:47:20 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @andrew_bogg @CritFacts Try reading the passage. It's completely apt for disgusting, subversive predators.
1328982276420603904 2020-11-18 16:44:00 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts Also, literally no one cares what furries think, lmaoooo. Thinking anyone does is like saying the crazy guy eating garbage and screaming obscenities at the sky has a valid opinion. 🤣
1328981662244483072 2020-11-18 16:41:34 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CritFacts I'm so honored to be recognized for believing that (actual) women deserve to be safe. I used "comfort" on purpose as I know the idea is so tRiGgErInG to intrusive, violent, perverted TAs.  Feminism doesn't exist to prop up delusional men in drag. Women's spaces are not for men.
1328979878218240002 2020-11-18 16:34:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @bronzeswords1 @forevershallon @CritFacts @smamflinders @Emma_A_Webb And your opinion is worthless as well as ludicrous, lmao. My safety and comfort supersede that of entitled, disordered, intrusive, science-denying freaks. Not sorry, never will be!

1328831420706459650 2020-11-18 06:44:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TweetWivMe @TheIllegit A medical degree is barely worth that much debt depending on the specialty and considering lost earning potential for a decade while studying/training. 😑 You can get a worthwhile undergrad STEM degree for &lt;$60K (e.g. community college, then in-state public school), though.
1328812535693369346 2020-11-18 05:29:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AJA_Cortes I'm no longer atheist but have always noticed that homeschooling is typically smeared as something that only crazy paranoid fundies choose to do. Many liberal parents claim they can't teach their own kids, not even the little kids, as if ABCs/123s are hard. Utterly disempowering.
1328804273099042818 2020-11-18 04:56:41 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @hyperboriankiwi What sort of aesthetic does Leifer at Jewish Currents have? The Woody Allen neurotic pedo blazer and corduroy special?

1328801796417052672 2020-11-18 04:46:50 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @EntrepreneurVyl Really pathetic. These remakes just make women seem like pale imitations of men as well as wannabes who don't have a genuine wheelhouse. Not sure why feminists can't see that.

1328518235508142082 2020-11-17 10:00:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @LizWFab @Eauxwen_Outback If you didn't receive funding for your PhD, your PhD was ill-advised and self-indulgent (media, so yes).   For undergrad, you attended an affordable state school that offers aid options (grants, scholarships). Your current debt from postgrad degrees was completely your choice!

This irritating, insistent push for intersectionality and racially coded belief systems has bitten them in the butt many times in regard to Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam.
1328496199486369792 2020-11-17 08:32:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BecomingAdamCom @DavidElliottSr @hehatestoseeit "He/him" presupposes that we should be concerned with acknowledging more than the gender binary as there's no need for pronoun "clarity" when men are clearly men and women are clearly women. Gender identity politics and the confusion/disorder wrought by them are anti-Christian.

1327873086813843461 2020-11-15 15:16:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> I found this supplement and want to try it out for late fall/winter. I don't know if it will help at all, but I figure it can't hurt. Monolaurin is supposed to be great for immunity.  https://t.co/bBI4lCbzCW

It's an antidote to the lies of "equity" and wokeness as well.  https://t.co/UtQCAiORr6

1327410026198265856 2020-11-14 08:36:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SchalkDormehl It's obvious that many people confuse and conflate peaceful/positive/gentle parenting and permissive parenting. Permissive parenting is bad and lazy parenting. Not that hard to understand.

1327072051560124416 2020-11-13 10:13:27 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @fiercelyfeminin Yes, and keep doing it even though we all fail at times. Just keep doing it. It's a daily--hourly--practice.

They're definitely not mutually exclusive. I think one lends itself to the other.
1326331125741051904 2020-11-11 09:09:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ayfkmlmao Yes.  1,139,725 people in my state also voted against requiring citizenship to vote, lmao.

Someone much smarter than both you and I once said, "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men." Avoiding public school indoctrination from the start is easier than fighting it.

1326299895771357185 2020-11-11 07:05:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @bobbyp68 @conservmillen OK then. At the very least, people need to know what their kids are being taught, contradict it or contest it if needed, and instill valuable lessons at home at every opportunity. I'm more than a bit tired of parents who blindly trust the schools.

1326297410105188353 2020-11-11 06:55:18 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @F1v3am @conservmillen @NickSzabo4 There are viable education options other than pricey private schools in many places. If someone doesn't have any other option, fair, but then they need to do a lot of work at home to combat what's being taught. Many parents don't even look at what their kids are being assigned.
1326296421402873858 2020-11-11 06:51:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @tired_fighting @conservmillen What kind of nonsense rhetorical tactic is this--did you learn it in a public indoctrination camp, lol?   I'm muting you for being pointless and absurd.

Also, many people work out for like 30 to 45 minutes a few times a week before going to a sedentary office job. That's hardly a bad thing or "waste of energy." It's just practical.

1325974140248084481 2020-11-10 09:30:45 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Simpinem Can't wait for the nation to un-heal very soon. 🙃
1325973850077732864 2020-11-10 09:29:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Simpinem Or, imagine calling yourself Catholic and being a pro-abortion war-monger who's been denied communion.
1325967156094398467 2020-11-10 09:02:59 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Stopnconsider @SummrWrites I'm sure it's more "rules for thee, but not for me" rhetoric. He's too important and special and actually contributes to the world unlike most of us peasants! 🙄
1325964754293301248 2020-11-10 08:53:27 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @luinalaska My question is, do people just follow others without even glancing at a few of their tweets? Your epic pinned rant alone shows that you're not a welfare-loving leftie, lol.
1325961862354243586 2020-11-10 08:41:57 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN It's been so cool watching you find the right path for yourself and your family. Orthodoxy seems really beautiful and soul-enriching. 😊
1325703015089778688 2020-11-09 15:33:23 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ayeletw Lmao, you're a hideous, petty person, and I doubt you've ever helped your community in any real way. This story reeks concocted, self-serving BS.   But imagine thinking it's virtuous to donate to *Senate campaigns.* 😆

1325608227250327553 2020-11-09 09:16:44 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @blauer_geist Sounds like a very John Hughes experience.

1325604988748435456 2020-11-09 09:03:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @verretor Bravetheworld has a YT video all about her experiences with Canadian healthcare and what Canadians get for its cost.

1325565850800287745 2020-11-09 06:28:21 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @fiercelyfeminin "Truth without love is brutality, and love without truth is hypocrisy." -Warren Wiersbe  Wise man.
1325565504690532352 2020-11-09 06:26:58 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster Ah, OK. Try the ice cream kind sometime, vanilla or green tea in particular. 😋
1325565323983130625 2020-11-09 06:26:15 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KyriosityTweets @BonifaceOption Yes. It's particularly funny to me how the concepts of "sin" and "sinner" are so offensive to so many people now. They speak to me so clearly, and it's freeing to acknowledge that I am imperfect as a part of this sick, fallen world.
1325561365042487303 2020-11-09 06:10:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @LaroSos1 @wownotever @Power32646003 @a_centrism @fbflyer But we haven't clinched the Senate yet....

1325559610837708800 2020-11-09 06:03:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster Yes, the ice cream is good, but the outside texture is really weird at first.
1325305551190970371 2020-11-08 13:14:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Simpinem Wtf, didn't you predict this an hour ago?
1325305342239121408 2020-11-08 13:13:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @mtracey @LukeDu16 I assume Massholes have steadily been moving to NH since 2016.
1325304637784797187 2020-11-08 13:10:23 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ajdhenry Except we all know Covid ain't actually deadly outside of nursing homes and favelas and so do they. 😑  I hate this.
1325297510248833027 2020-11-08 12:42:03 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @quaght @sarahwoodwriter "Defund the police until I need to report someone for exercising his constitutional rights." Wtf am I even reading  Also, the police are not neurotic liberal white women's personal bodyguards.
1325290344309731329 2020-11-08 12:13:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @tedlieu @POTUS @JoeBiden Catholics are not pro-abortion.
1325288843529117698 2020-11-08 12:07:37 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @jeremykauffman @Lukewearechange Yeah, except I don't care about Trump per se. I do care about "equity" laws, compelled speech, threats to 2A, censorship, and ever-increasing taxation.
1325288102299103235 2020-11-08 12:04:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @hyperboriankiwi No one in my tl is calling for unity, lol. Eff these people.
1325287600316411904 2020-11-08 12:02:41 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @wownotever @Power32646003 @a_centrism @fbflyer Sadly, I'm talking about many educated, six-figure professional liberals I actually know who *do* want to pay more taxes. White guilt, "privilege is bad" types. It's shocking to me.
1325287183977213952 2020-11-08 12:01:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AlJenko98 @PetiteNicoco Yes, precisely. Ironically, I know that pushback and fighting the system have worked in the UK for the Muslim parents against hyper-progressive sex ed and LGBT curricula in places like Birmingham.
1325286040702246919 2020-11-08 11:56:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AlJenko98 @PetiteNicoco Parents need to step up and fight indoctrination. They need to read what their kids are being assigned. 70 million people still voted for Trump even if Trump has lost; we don't have to become a Marxist hellhole unless we give up entirely.
1325285741757407232 2020-11-08 11:55:18 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @PetiteNicoco What's the over/under on Dems trying to ban homeschooling?
1325284666832809986 2020-11-08 11:51:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @FredTJoseph Why do you assume that smart parents will let their kids get anywhere near your vile ideology?
1325284157711380480 2020-11-08 11:49:00 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @eziomorte I think we're all aware of that and are afraid of both. Kamala will be pres within two years, guaranteed.

1325275461874823171 2020-11-08 11:14:27 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @whitepilledking Of course. All Dems are.

1325273810245988352 2020-11-08 11:07:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Simpinem To a malignant narcissist, the end always justify the means.
1325265055320055810 2020-11-08 10:33:06 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Also, if EC is abolished, it doesn't matter at all.
1325264949007052800 2020-11-08 10:32:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt I'm guessing it will be a Cruz/Haley ticket unless some interesting outsider appears again.
1325245568604639232 2020-11-08 09:15:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ajdhenry Kamala literally looks nothing like dark-brown, low-caste Mindy Kaling.

1325218119888072707 2020-11-08 07:26:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @mister_dude2020 If you're deficient in something, yes. If you're not, they can still give a bit of an energy boost, but you mostly pee them out, lol. I like Vitamin Code, but there are lots of decent ones. A Centrum multi is probably OK and cheaper.  For vitamin D, you want an oil-based capsule.
1325217053033320448 2020-11-08 07:22:21 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit You know, all they really do at their core is attack and twist the concept of legality. The Denver Post once used the phrase "undocumented citizen" a few years ago before they retracted it.
1325019033649950721 2020-11-07 18:15:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SlimPat3 @RealWriteWinger I'm sorry about that. Even where I live, I still have to censor myself often to avoid stepping on some people's toes, and my husband--in a relatively conservative job--has to be careful, too.

Many chronically sick people hide themselves away or treat themselves like pariahs. Many healthy people ignore sick people instead of including them. The cult of health is obviously a real thing.

Biden is bad, but Kamala is worse.

Think about how they've forced self-checkout on us the last 10 years. That's to save money/cut staff.

1324102335082188806 2020-11-05 05:32:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @whitepilledking And NV is shocked that the country wants their results. 🤨

1324080496620568578 2020-11-05 04:06:05 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @jrcrum @CA4equalrights We already knew they were in LA and the Bay Area, lol.
1324063457738657793 2020-11-05 02:58:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @DavidFirman11 @redsteeze He's not a socialist. He just wants to push government-run programs, hike up taxes, kill small businesses, destroy the suburbs, impede school choice, compel/censor speech, force identity-based hiring on companies, and ban guns while giving immigrants preferential treatment. 😬
1324061073264312320 2020-11-05 02:48:54 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @johnnyfriegas @redsteeze They're all dreamers and future doctors and saints until they think for themselves and vote the "wrong" way.
1324060053746425857 2020-11-05 02:44:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @oompa4sc @MarinaMedvin I disagree. Kamala is a real threat.  But I'm not leaving. That's just dumb.
1324054366073094146 2020-11-05 02:22:15 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Ribsy61 @chilljat @DavidOAtkins SOGI laws and the inflation of trans rights are already superseding women's rights and protections. I'm sure replying to you is a waste of time as you likely pretend this isn't the case, though it's obvious. To leftists, mentally ill men are more valuable than biological women.😶
1324052465738764289 2020-11-05 02:14:42 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @jaydragon @PetiteNicoco They confuse anxiety with productivity and purpose.
1324051160135802881 2020-11-05 02:09:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @funkyh33 @conservmillen Makes me sad, too. And even though it didn't pass, I'm happy that ~1.2 million Coloradans did vote for the ban. That is significant.
1324048982503497729 2020-11-05 02:00:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Yep, Kamala is the real problem here.
1324038242291896322 2020-11-05 01:18:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania The path to God is narrow and difficult. The way of sin is easy and selfish.
1324037919846313985 2020-11-05 01:16:54 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN My worst fears came true: flagrant fraud. If Biden gets in, I can't wait for the impending war-mongering as well as the death knell to thousands of businesses across the US through increased taxes and Covid craziness. 😑
1323914077018738688 2020-11-04 17:04:47 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt 😆
1323911620037349376 2020-11-04 16:55:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit Hanging chads, 2020 version. What a useless year full of ancient proto-Boomer narcissists trying to grab a bit of power before they're completely irrelevant.
1323907343134896129 2020-11-04 16:38:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN You made this weird night a lot more enjoyable and energetic! ❤️

1323882565783195653 2020-11-04 14:59:34 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaxBlumenthal @whitepilledking @jack Brian Williams, notorious liar and disgraced former anchor, lol?
1323874938986614785 2020-11-04 14:29:16 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @melanemoia I'm often a naive optimist. It's the worst.
1323874497284497408 2020-11-04 14:27:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @melanemoia I really thought Minnesota would do the same thing. So disappointing.
1323874375825821696 2020-11-04 14:27:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @blauer_geist Or that there was an election at all, lol.
1323868854758629376 2020-11-04 14:05:05 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MartianOvrlord @lporiginalg Because Canada has incredibly strict immigration requirements, especially for whites, lol.
1323866015269330944 2020-11-04 13:53:48 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @jimni27 It's funny how enraged liberals get over Fox when Fox has plenty of people on that network who are RINOs, never-Trumpers, or just regular Dems (Chris Wallace, Martha MacCallum, Juan Williams, etc.)--people who have shown disdain and resentment for DJT from day one.
1323865514448474114 2020-11-04 13:51:49 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CarlWorsham It seems like many people automatically lose 10+ IQ points when they move to CA. Lots of vapid, superficial people who often don't even know basic facts from grade school.
1323864961429495808 2020-11-04 13:49:37 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ajdhenry Trust me, I think it's more than odd.
1323858130170793985 2020-11-04 13:22:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SpiritedSparr0w Sam Harris is overrated.
1323813790710988801 2020-11-04 10:26:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @elgringoloco54 @MarinaMedvin Yeah, I thought OH was a sure thing tbh.
1323812024804147200 2020-11-04 10:19:16 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @elgringoloco54 @MarinaMedvin Oh, thank you. I hope to God he takes it.
1323811473999732736 2020-11-04 10:17:05 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @blauer_geist I would be OK to switching to six-year terms. This is too often and too draining.
1323811119480393730 2020-11-04 10:15:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MarinaMedvin That would be amazing if he got VA. Too bad I'm now extremely worried about NC, OH, and TX. Wtf.
1323810132577472512 2020-11-04 10:11:45 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @HCTIWS_14 @MarinaMedvin Because the motherlode of votes rests in northern VA...but I'm still optimistic.
1323808230963879944 2020-11-04 10:04:12 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ayfkmlmao Jorgensen for sure.
1323799668359389184 2020-11-04 09:30:10 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AutistLvsMatter What's up with OH now, though?
1323793928362098688 2020-11-04 09:07:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania I've considered moving there, but my husband is not really on board. 😢
1323788459765600258 2020-11-04 08:45:38 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xKitty_Hawkx @Balding14yo @lporiginalg Yeah, lmao.  https://t.co/ULWl8XGpDY
1323786335539417088 2020-11-04 08:37:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Balding14yo @lporiginalg What's that thing on the left? I know the thing on the right is his girlfriend.
1323785718620184578 2020-11-04 08:34:44 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @OrwellNGoode "I need benzos to function like a somewhat normal person." Weird flex but OK.
1323778697351122946 2020-11-04 08:06:50 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Funny you should say this because I often tell people that I "don't watch TV," but I'm Twitter and Youtube for hours most days. 🙃
1323755003320958977 2020-11-04 06:32:41 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster You have a shot if he loses.
1323754443213590529 2020-11-04 06:30:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster I love her.
1323753969722789889 2020-11-04 06:28:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @jimni27 Fox has gotta be "balanced." 🙄
1323753717305409536 2020-11-04 06:27:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TPersevering Please move here. We need good people.
1323752911621545985 2020-11-04 06:24:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN IG warned me that this is photoshopped, lmao.
1323752672227479553 2020-11-04 06:23:25 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @mister_dude2020 Some people just want any scrap of power they can get, plus the illusion of respect.
1323745384024387587 2020-11-04 05:54:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @pnjaban You aren't getting any sleep for a long time unless you can fit in a power nap!
1323744483926806542 2020-11-04 05:50:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AutistLvsMatter Yeah, older-than-a-Boomer Biden hasn't energized or captivated young people, no surprise. Plus, all the Covid hysteria among liberal college kids on campuses doesn't really lend itself to in-person voting.
1323743979846991872 2020-11-04 05:48:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Melania is a vision going down that escalator. 😍
1323738390517501953 2020-11-04 05:26:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Philosophi_Cat The Young Turks 🤣
1323700689349074944 2020-11-04 02:56:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Sad thing is, the people voting for them know that and don't care.
1323687017377574912 2020-11-04 02:02:32 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SpiritedSparr0w "Radicalized." 🙄 Apparently, it's un-radical to poison kids with blockers and hormones, burn down cities, abort babies, destroy the concept of "family" in favor of abject government dependency, and promote communism.
1323541551742701568 2020-11-03 16:24:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @twittbitch4 🤍

1323517294354587650 2020-11-03 14:48:07 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @akmcclen Baptist or nondenominational Protestant (they're in the same general grouping of buildings)
1323514686609018882 2020-11-03 14:37:45 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit That movie fascinated and terrified me as a kid. I was such a wimp.
1323513174960820226 2020-11-03 14:31:45 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ChicknLittle_ Fair enough. I personally will NEVER vote for a pro-abortion candidate nor can some lukewarm pastor convince me to do so.
1323489929645752320 2020-11-03 12:59:23 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TAAmberg @pnjaban I often pray for my enemies.
1323489073294725125 2020-11-03 12:55:58 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MyDYourM1 @joe82926051 @michaeljknowles Lindy West, the cowish blonde, did get pregnant once--after having 100% unprotected sex with her boyfriend several times a week for months and relying on emergency contraception that failed due to her obesity. She still blames "the patriarchy" for her abject irresponsibility. 🙄
1323487927683481601 2020-11-03 12:51:25 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @perk @SpiritedSparr0w Worse, she's 41 and received her master's back in 2004, lmao. Serious chip on shoulder/riding identity politics hard vibes from this lady. She's most likely a complete fraud.
1323482476958928897 2020-11-03 12:29:46 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Hondo320F16 @tessbigfoot23 @ConceptualJames You can easily get a bachelor's degree without ever taking calculus or physics, lmao.
1323478536854884353 2020-11-03 12:14:06 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CulturalDissid1 @SamyD12 There's no stopping this; the Pandora's box has been opened.   Also, Rebecca Zissou works for a major publisher (Scholastic) and edits schoolbooks for kids. People like her dictate what kids read and learn.
1323477719762538497 2020-11-03 12:10:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @PunsUnfunny @SamyD12 Yep. The curriculum is formed and poisoned by these insidious ideas. It's the culture of the school. There's no escaping it or changing it.
1323477046375403520 2020-11-03 12:08:11 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SamyD12 Nothing will happen. Teachers' unions openly support this slop among other highly controversial issues. Your only recourse is a charter school, private school, or homeschooling.  https://t.co/CcHo88Z8Io
1323475540255363075 2020-11-03 12:02:12 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @redmaggiej The disturbing implication of the hyperbolic response to ACB is that these women believe that their daughters may want to have abortions in the future. What a grim worldview.
1323462510184378369 2020-11-03 11:10:25 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @McSickOfThis @NateSilver538 I so wish that would happen. Highly unlikely, but stranger things have happened....
1323453733754294274 2020-11-03 10:35:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MeaganSnow @conservmillen And what does *Trump* have to do with war, lmao?
1323450114036371456 2020-11-03 10:21:10 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @whitepilledking Punditry is a joke.   Also, the US is just a lost cause if all of the Great Lakes states go blue after months of Democratic Covid insanity and leftist rioting hell.
1323392595440160768 2020-11-03 06:32:36 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Dannyswirsky @SummrWrites Yeah, this is almost certainly for primary voting purposes, not uncommon at all. I'm not into witch hunts about alleged political affiliation.
1323388990515458049 2020-11-03 06:18:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MattWalshBlog @ExiledWaffleMan Kamala will just take over within a few months/a year...which is actually worse.
1323387161509507073 2020-11-03 06:11:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @joe82926051 @michaeljknowles Not really, though. I ❤️ Abortion dresses, photoshoots to "glamorize" abortion, a bint who attempted to kill her viable 24-week-old fetus with a coat hanger instead of driving to an abortion clinic 45 minutes away  https://t.co/7rsdYvQVup
1323381549501472769 2020-11-03 05:48:43 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> Obama was right.
1323380841641369607 2020-11-03 05:45:54 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TomPiroli "Made an oops." She's talking about an actual human being there.
1323371156532043776 2020-11-03 05:07:25 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @P8R1OT @DrainOurSwamp CO, already voted!

1323362273612730370 2020-11-03 04:32:07 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @futureusrefugee Your credit should go up pretty quickly, like in a month or two.
1323362115336523778 2020-11-03 04:31:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaxeySuzanne @LisaBritton I feel so sorry for the girls in your troop, though I assume most of their mothers/guardians hold similarly ridiculous beliefs.

1323000569926209536 2020-11-02 04:34:50 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @melanemoia Because making fun of rural, small-town, and "flyover" conservatives worked so well in 2016!
1323000164173389833 2020-11-02 04:33:13 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CountSophia @luinalaska Oh, I'm a silent Republican, walked away during the 2016 election. I can't be honest where I live irl due to leftist/commie nonsense. One of my old "friends" even thinks it's disturbingly jingoistic to display our (blue) state flag. 🙄

1322995703254339588 2020-11-02 04:15:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @tgrif74 @luinalaska Hahaha, touché.
1322995209022701568 2020-11-02 04:13:32 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @luinalaska I told people I wasn't voting for Biden. They assumed that meant I wasn't voting at all and got testy. "Voting is important!" clearly just means "vote for the candidates/issues I like" for most people; if they knew my stance on most things, they'd probably tell me NOT to vote. 🙃

1322591725290999810 2020-11-01 01:30:14 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @oye_clark @luinalaska Oh yeah, she definitely wouldn't have gotten my vote, either. I don't agree with 95% of her platform.
1322451911942000641 2020-10-31 16:14:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit Is the right *finally* picking up on Alinsky tactics?
1322442689846087680 2020-10-31 15:38:01 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN I'm genuinely worried about voter fraud. Not sure if that's dumb or not, and it's not like I can do anything about it, but I am worried.
1322442305593290752 2020-10-31 15:36:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @oye_clark @luinalaska Seriously, Tulsi was the way: an attractive, anti-hawk, young minority woman with a soothing voice and great composure, i.e. the anti-Hillary.
1322409686105292800 2020-10-31 13:26:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @fish10186 @MarinaMedvin High taxes, equivalent copays to the US for Rx drugs and specialist visits, long wait times due to no scheduled appointments, no choice in which specialist your primary care doc refers you to. Liberals/leftists spread many myths about "socialized" healthcare; it's truly bizarre.
1322408065195532288 2020-10-31 13:20:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @whitepilledking Utterly pathetic.

1322406362542968833 2020-10-31 13:13:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @futureusrefugee @whitepilledking Lmao, I once had a few rabid fems on Reddit tell me that *burqas* are beautiful and empowering, even after I posted an article about women who were getting injured or killed in accidents bc they couldn't properly ride their bikes while wearing them.
1322348239631360000 2020-10-31 09:22:43 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt So, so tired of young women in drag queen makeup. But it seems easier for them to be hollow and amoral when they walk around the world looking like demented clowns instead of genuine humans.

1322245607885541376 2020-10-31 02:34:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MrDanielBuck "Try this: think critically about something you know nothing about."  This is one of my biggest sources of confusion re: "unschooling" and child-led learning, the latter of which I had to implement in a classroom. How can kids intuitively know what they want/need to learn?
1322075510969683968 2020-10-30 15:18:59 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Lmao, that guy's thread on a non-topic is so long. tl,dr, dude.

Quran 9:29  Quran 5:51, Quran 2:65-66, Quran 9:30, Hadith 5389, etc., etc., etc.

That's a lot of people, and it's not unbelievable considering Sharia law, Wahhabism, ISIS, etc.  Also, "Isaacson"? Why are you defending Islam at all? 🤨

1321923440618676224 2020-10-30 05:14:43 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN Sounds right to me. Creation itself is good and holy.

If you support BLM and Antifa, the decimation of small businesses and entrepreneurship through insane taxation and regulations, the destruction of suburbia, and casual and unfounded use of terms like "white supremacy," you hate this country.

1321175135802527745 2020-10-28 03:41:13 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @whitepilledking I like it, but I might flip MI and GA.

1321160967309434882 2020-10-28 02:44:55 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Curiousferret1 Nope, they just live simply and frugally, and they don't buy any extra useless crap for their kids.  And you're suggesting that both parents should work, meaning that neither the father nor the mother is there while kids are raised by strangers. There's no appeal to that at all.
1321154797341450240 2020-10-28 02:20:24 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Curiousferret1 Lots of families are successful one-income households. I follow a woman named Darci Isabella on Youtube who has 10 kids, and her family flourished in northern IL for 20 years on just her husband's income; he delivered for Fedex. 🤷‍♀️

1321136882248540163 2020-10-28 01:09:12 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Curiousferret1 That makes very little sense to me. $50K is completely viable in WI. You can literally get a perfectly decent house in Green Bay, Milwaukee, or even Madison (yuck) for ~$150K.
1321003330328498176 2020-10-27 16:18:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @DrOakley1689 Plus it's just super-creepy.
1321001445320237056 2020-10-27 16:11:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt I don't agree with most of Tulsi's platform, but she does not make me cringe, seems level-headed, is very composed, and is beautiful and strong. I think her career is done, though, bc she went after Kamala and then the psycho Dems smeared her as a Russian asset. 😑
1320998928632975360 2020-10-27 16:01:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Yeah, my only solace is that 95% of the signs and flags I've seen locally have been for Trump. It seems like people don't really feel genuinely excited about Biden but of course they "have" to vote for him anyway.
1320998282789879808 2020-10-27 15:58:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @kkatielam Weird of you to plan to have an abortion someday. Is this some sort of satanic bucket list?
1320996033292308480 2020-10-27 15:49:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Worse, I can't believe people who are proudly voting for him.

1320989245906014208 2020-10-27 15:22:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @VividMiddle @rezaaslan Yes, agreed. Iran's calling you home, Reza.
1320986000018051073 2020-10-27 15:09:39 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Curiousferret1 Paying for childcare is an enormous expense (financially as well as personally).  Also, when Americans get out of a handful of expensive cities, large swaths of the US (Midwest, South, Southwest) are affordable or workable. Buy a house for &lt;$200K. Budget and save. Worth it.
1320983654840078337 2020-10-27 15:00:20 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Convenient way to mischaracterize anyone who's been banned from Youtube. Gab, Parler are treated the same way for those banned from Twitter. Idiots believe it, though.
1320980370758766593 2020-10-27 14:47:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CherryP91885339 ^Oh, by the way, do you see yourself in these comments? Cut too close to the bone? Hmm.
1320980169423769604 2020-10-27 14:46:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @CherryP91885339 @RRR0BYN I'm a married woman, but nice try, lmao. And apparently nothing fails thots like all forms of birth control, ever. Of course most of these losers get knocked up bc they can't even handle the responsibility of taking a pill at the same time every day. 🙄 Sad, pathetic creatures.

1320974477434458114 2020-10-27 14:23:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN So even with the Pill, IUDs, implants, patches, rings, injections, diaphragms, condoms, spermicide, emergency contraception, etc. (and abstinence that they pretend isn't even an option), they need access to abortion or they will be forced to exist in a dystopian hellscape. 🙄
1320919617683017730 2020-10-27 10:45:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheIllegit They'd probably be back to pushing the Green New Deal and all of its attendant nonsense, especially considering that Biden has touched on a lot of it (fracking, minimum wage).
1320909293831528448 2020-10-27 10:04:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @thebeatabsurd @EntrepreneurVyl It doesn't matter if someone truly believes in it if doctors, therapists, teachers, and other professionals feel they have to play along with false biology, neopronouns, blockers, hormones, and surgeries or else. The results are real and extremely damaging, if not life-ruining.
1320907961066262529 2020-10-27 09:59:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SpiritedSparr0w I'm a silent voter. Most people I know are vocal and nastily aggressive Dems and leftists.

1320101179460812800 2020-10-25 04:33:42 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @coreyfontan @SlowToWrite I don't agree whatsoever with Jo "BLM" Jorgensen, either, and know of no other remotely viable third-party candidates. What a waste of time to admonish those of us who don't want Biden to win for relevant reasons.

1319900211829932033 2020-10-24 15:15:07 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Honestly, yes, since we've been Zionists for 75 years already, lol.
1319899116198047744 2020-10-24 15:10:46 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @coreyfontan @SlowToWrite So many others should be willing to say vote for a pro-abortion, likely hawkish pseudo-Catholic who wants to decimate small businesses, rush to end critical industries, and destroy suburbia? Not to mention the hideous endorsement of the evil, life-ruining "trans kids" fad.
1319830532432199681 2020-10-24 10:38:14 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @0x49fa98 I felt the same in 2016: "Wow, I'm...voting Republican. Feels weird, man. Feels dirty." I've gotten more red-pilled and more conservative with each passing day.

They also lecture others on guns, abortion, religion, "climate change," foreign policy, race relations, socialism/communism, and numerous other topics where they have only the most superficial understanding or veritably no understanding at all, lol.

It would be funny except it's infiltrating the church as well.
1319059574738006024 2020-10-22 07:34:44 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster And how do they explain Jesus's clear definition of marriage? Was that also a "mistranslation"? Not to mention repeated condemnations of overarching "sexual immorality" throughout the Bible.  These people just cannot accept that Christianity has rules, lol. It's wild.

Plus, the worst of it by far was back in the spring when the pandemic was burgeoning and then after the June riots, not during this current '20/'21 school year.

1317913708509671424 2020-10-19 03:41:28 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AdamSchiavone @daveJay @JesseKellyDC @SeanPenaEsq @NullAzor06 I think she'll be entitled, hyperbolic, and overly emotional while freaking out and blaming others if she doesn't get her way. Also, she will have a poor understanding of complex issues but pretend to be an expert. That's what happens when children are told they know everything.
1317746107917733888 2020-10-18 16:35:29 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania You can opine on whatever you want! If I lived elsewhere, I'd still have strong opinions about US politics; if I were more knowledgeable, I'm sure I'd have more opinions about world politics.
1317684749209657350 2020-10-18 12:31:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @DustinTL @EntrepreneurVyl I know the area of NJ where he grew up and went to school in the '70s. I'm gonna say he was severely bullied at the very least.
1317683798126055424 2020-10-18 12:27:53 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KarinLitzcke If you say silly things that research debunks and if you treat parenting like it's optional instead of mandatory, someone might call you out. I'm sure you're not used to any disagreement, though. People like you tend to prefer echo chambers.
1317670071649656832 2020-10-18 11:33:20 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KarinLitzcke Also, should math, science, history, citizenship be saved for the classroom as well? It would be ridiculous and would not serve anyone to avoid numbers and basic arithmetic at home solely because it may not be identical to/perfectly aligned school w/ instruction. Come on now.
1317668235383345154 2020-10-18 11:26:03 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KarinLitzcke Reading to/with kids from infancy is an effective method of establishing print and phonological awareness. There doesn't need to be formality to foster a home literacy environment. To say that parents don't need to do ANYTHING as long as there are capable teachers is utter tripe.
1317661328455192579 2020-10-18 10:58:36 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @daveJay @JesseKellyDC Think of the narcissism and insufferable attitude created and instilled by constantly being told you're smarter, better, and "more qualified" than experienced, educated adults from the time you're a toddler. This little girl is probably the next AOC.

1317657556144238594 2020-10-18 10:43:36 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TomPiroli By doing that, you will become braver in the process.
1317655374720282624 2020-10-18 10:34:56 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SaraJPeden @ayfkmlmao @KarinLitzcke @VesiaHawkins So you believe that propagating the alleged "achievement gap" is OK, preferable even, though we know that parental engagement and as little as 15 minutes a day of home reading can effect progress and boost confidence, as long as some kids have middling results in the end...?
1317654704189485056 2020-10-18 10:32:16 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ayfkmlmao @KarinLitzcke @VesiaHawkins Why read to your kids when you can be at the mercy of the state and the broken public education system? Why engage with your kids at all when a random overworked teacher can do it?
1317654277360439296 2020-10-18 10:30:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> This Karin claims you don't need to read to/with your kids; you need to rely on teachers w/ classrooms of 25, 30+ students to do it for you (or perhaps wait for special programs to be implemented that serve as proxy parents by giving kids individual attention), lol. We're doomed.
1317643332961656832 2020-10-18 09:47:05 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @AnechoicMedia_ The UCs are phasing out the SAT as an admission requirement. That coupled with worthless grades will only harm Asian and white students and weaken STEM programs. The worst part is that everyone knows this is flagrantly racist and anti-meritocratic, but few people seem to care.
1317640676822208512 2020-10-18 09:36:32 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @luinalaska On the ballot in my state, there is a vote to lower the state sales tax as well as property taxes. Given the recent influx of leftist weirdos who seem to think taxation is the answer to everything, I'm really wondering what's going to happen. What an absurd time.
1317639015835881473 2020-10-18 09:29:56 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @luinalaska Yes, feel free to donate to the Treasury on your own and leave me out of this weird government grift.

Rural VA is just not heavily populated; Fairfax, Arlington, Loudoun (plus Richmond and surrounding counties to the south) are.

1317237707274391552 2020-10-17 06:55:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN It's shocking that so many can look at BLM/Antifa-ravaged urban centers, C-section rates (in the US anyway), and hideously underperforming and dangerous public schools and think "this is fine; this is normal."
1317236055360327680 2020-10-17 06:48:43 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KabIntMed @MrPerfectish @conservmillen And if you actually are a physician with kids supporting these dangerous unknowns, *you* are part of the problem and should be deeply ashamed. Physicians in the past also lobotomized trusting/non-consenting patients. Following trends and social pressure isn't good medicine ffs.
1317235000065011715 2020-10-17 06:44:31 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KabIntMed @MrPerfectish @conservmillen "Expert" ignorance around this *nascent* issue is frightening. Look at the sky-high % of kids who outgrow alleged dysphoria. Look at desistance rates. Look at suicide attempt and depression rates in those who *do* transition. Look at Jazz Jennings, whose body has been destroyed!
1317207396142452739 2020-10-17 04:54:50 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaridithForIowa @RealSaavedra Why do you believe that these blockers are wholly benign? They're clearly not. You're supporting child abuse, manipulation, and damaging intervention to fit in and feel progressive. It's insane.   https://t.co/5bNBoh3TkV    https://t.co/aW9uwyTita
1317204999315873799 2020-10-17 04:45:18 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @KabIntMed @MrPerfectish @conservmillen Yes, and? Jazz Jennings was put on them at age 11 with disastrous results (malformed and nonfunctioning genitalia, no sex drive/arousal, tuberous breasts). They are not safe or benign. It's highly disturbing how people are pushing these drugs on kids out of nowhere.
1317012756395163648 2020-10-16 16:01:24 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster Put hot people in commercials instead of miserable ginger hags if you want people to listen to you. This is repulsive.
1317004908877537281 2020-10-16 15:30:13 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MaridithForIowa @RealSaavedra What does "express the gender they feel" even mean? Kids' preferences and interests are very different from taking them to gender clinics and choosing the fast track to blockers and hormones. Further,  up to 95% of "dysphoric" kids outgrow it without intervention!  https://t.co/XN7dl6CXEr
1316997664538546176 2020-10-16 15:01:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @cma_wolfpack @luinalaska Great/disturbing book. I also highly suggest _When Harry Became Sally_ and _The End of Gender_. This is a real and growing problem that seemed like a fringe issue just a few years ago.
1316967747755139073 2020-10-16 13:02:33 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @cheri311 I mean, it's only "old-fashioned" in the sense that it's biblical. (Albeit there are some terrible apostates and false teachers who are men as well--and sometimes they're sneakier due to their perceived authority.)

1316931975245123585 2020-10-16 10:40:24 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @xxyydtt Only 25 to 30g of fiber is recommended per day. That's like on avocado, an apple or side salad, and a cup of berries. I don't understand why everyone thinks they need loads of extra fiber.
1316930264216555521 2020-10-16 10:33:37 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @MrPerfectish @conservmillen NOPE. Puberty blockers are dangerous: they affect bone turnover; they cause the underdevelopment of genitalia (e.g. the case of Jazz Jennings); they lower IQ.   https://t.co/ILbLZIyuNE   https://t.co/3auWYx0MlG
1316827006911295495 2020-10-16 03:43:18 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> No response. I wonder why.  https://t.co/xzbATRdNB9
1316643503791902720 2020-10-15 15:34:08 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @blauer_geist I noticed some people saying "harvest" instead of "hunt" or "kill" on a wilderness survival show as well and thought it was weird.
1316636962455945216 2020-10-15 15:08:08 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @nerdyhubb222 @sugarfreecat1 @CatholicAwesome But birth control can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg (i.e. causing a disruption of the natural process *after* conception), so your point is moot anyhow. It seems like you don't entirely understand what BC may thwart, probably because pro-BC propaganda is real.

1316576001644781570 2020-10-15 11:05:54 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Lexy_Sauve Lots of fear-mongering about red meat and heart disease/cancer, plus lots of specious propaganda for vegetarian and vegan diets

1316513221340098560 2020-10-15 06:56:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @JasonVermilyea @SeanDuffyWI Disagree. In-state tuition at Madison is affordable as far as college goes and a good way to learn all about leftist insanity in order to fight it going forward. Jack is a smart, ambitious kid with a supportive family. He won't be brainwashed.

And with increasingly insane and confusing gender-bending and neopronoun nonsense, everything turns into a *preference* per leftist standards. Lesbians are now TERFs/bigots for *preferring* real women.

It's irritating and ridiculous that the "social media converted you" people minimize or ignore the catechumen experience. No one can accidentally or casually become Orthodox, lol.

It is so glaringly obvious that to deny it is just a specious feminist tactic--always the victim, huh--so good day.

Kids need structure, need to learn how to be respectful and how to earn respect, and yes, how to be obedient. Permissive parenting is the bane of Western culture, and it is confusing and cruel.

It's absurd to believe that marital disagreement, bickering, and the chaos of forced "equality" are healthy or productive; just look at divorce rates!

They need to instruct other men on how to lead a household.   As for women, it makes sense for other women to guide us in serenity, obedience, and patience, which is why I find so much value in Elisabeth Elliot's and Nancy Wilson's work.
1314365378005532673 2020-10-09 08:41:40 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @StefMLozinski Guttmacher also conceded this (quoted in a WaPo opinion piece no less), which is apparently so shocking to the pro-abortion crowd that they consistently call it a lie:  https://t.co/0CUEa9Rar2

In my state, Dr. Warren Hern will perform abortions at any point during pregnancy for any reason. He has that "right" per Doe v. Bolton.

I've worked in several doctors' offices and know how patients act, albeit there is a lot of entitlement among Medicaid patients as well.

The only way significantly more ppl die is if Dems force more Covid-positive ppl into nursing homes or something similar; we know w/ certainty the young and healthy aren't dying.

1314067302959243264 2020-10-08 12:57:13 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Philleepe @BraveTheWorld Make sense.

1313679660685852675 2020-10-07 11:16:52 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @luinalaska Super-disappointing take as Dreher just wrote a book on the dangers of totalitarianism and the need for Christian truth that looks interesting and highly germane. Shaming his mom due to his own Covid paranoia and fear of death is basically the opposite of that.

There's a guy in the town I used to live in named Dr. Warren Hern who performs third-trimester abortions for any reason. Also, a former abortionist, Dr. Levatino, tours around the country dispelling myths about late-term abortion.

Also, there's been incredibly poor distinction in recording those who died *with* Covid v. those who died *from* Covid (per the CDC itself!). And what are the death rates for flu v. Covid in the under 65 population?
1313608598002561027 2020-10-07 06:34:30 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @quackocracy Most likely, especially as DLR was also their primary lyricist and has always been a big personality hustler. But that isn't a smear against EVH's talent; it was just the nature of top 40 radio, arena rock, and the early MTV era.

1312859806391242754 2020-10-05 04:59:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster Oh yeah, I got you. I'm just saying once you look into it and realize how many stores there are and where many are located (sometimes two or three on the same block in Manhattan), it's obviously suspect.
1312859182517940225 2020-10-05 04:56:35 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SandwichPoster I can easily believe Mattress Firm as a laundering scheme or mob-related or perhaps some sort of tax shelter. Not remotely "illogical." There are dozens upon dozens of these stores with the simplest inventory to manage taking up prime real estate in places like NYC, lol.

Epstein and the defense of Netflix Cuties alone corroborate an organized effort by elites to protect and support pedos. Soros is often in the news for funding PACs/campaigns.

I consider false transsexualism/AGP to be fully entrenched in the current "trans movement." All trans people are acting out in some way and even those who claim to have gender dysphoria have serious mental problems. I can't support any of it.
1312565967449460736 2020-10-04 09:31:27 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN The entire trans movement is mental illness and perversion. And I remember trying to give the benefit of the doubt five or so years ago, ugh.

1312548145935646720 2020-10-04 08:20:38 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TanRebekah @conservmillen True. I see so many men worried about women's "right" to baby murder. But of course, abortion benefits men in a shallow, morally bankrupt, anti-family hookup culture, so...

1311923578946936832 2020-10-02 14:58:50 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SavagePunch @futureusrefugee I only directly know one person irl (along with her immediate family) who had it, and the symptoms were so mild that they thought they just had a cold. They quickly made a full recovery. I never try to get sick; this is no different: I practice good hygiene and hope for the best.
1311916339997614080 2020-10-02 14:30:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @SavagePunch @futureusrefugee How do you know so many people, particularly young people, who've had it and died? In my entire state, ~35 people under 40 have allegedly died of it. One of the only mainstream reports was of a wheelchair-bound teenage girl with multiple comorbidities, far from healthy or normal.
1311907370856001538 2020-10-02 13:54:25 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @ExiledWaffleMan Did we really expect anything else, though? These people also celebrated when Johnson was in ICU for Covid.

1311899226901827584 2020-10-02 13:22:04 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Ed_Realist @mtracey Oh, Trump's obese (not morbidly, but obese nonetheless), but he has the best care possible available to him. He seems very hale and hearty for his age and demanding lifestyle. Who knows.
1311893747802742784 2020-10-02 13:00:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BaneDoomer1356 Yeah, and then when I ask people, "Which Trump *policies* are you afraid of? What rights has he taken away?" they bring up Obama's cages or some transtrender nonsense that should've never been part of government medical care anyway.
1311893369531105280 2020-10-02 12:58:47 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @WilliamBrooks8 @SydneyLWatson Yep, and it seems it would've already happened by now considering his first term is almost over! How weird to live in a constantly paranoid, panicked state over absolutely nothing.
1311891982457999362 2020-10-02 12:53:17 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BaneDoomer1356 Trump has done nothing to hurt or hinder gay people in any capacity; I think what really pisses them off is his overall apathy toward them! Also amazing that these same people almost certainly view BLM/Antifa as "peaceful allies."
1311889000647581696 2020-10-02 12:41:26 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BaneDoomer1356 I guess lately I just take the perspective that we live in a fallen (or, from a non-religious perspective, flawed/unfair) world and we can't keep searching for utopia without severe disappointment. But I definitely hear what you're saying. I try to be grateful in/for my own life.
1311886948781428736 2020-10-02 12:33:16 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BaneDoomer1356 I've been a bona fide doomer since the beginning of June, lol. Everything is so obviously terrible on purpose.

And the new paradigm is that women should never feel shame/regret for anything they do and that abortion is normal and good.

1311860367593811969 2020-10-02 10:47:39 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Lew2Nai1 The KKK is something like 5,000 members but was brought up relentlessly in 2016/2017; not even two dozen people showed up for Unite the Right 2. Of course since such a group is utterly insignificant, the new narrative is that we're *all* white supremacists from birth. 🙄

At least Trump is not a politician who promotes *raising* taxes. I'm not going to continue a back and forth about this, but I'm not shocked or appalled by rich people who know how to game the system.

And I don't view any world leader or multimillionaire as "one of us"; that's patently absurd.
1310380141575655424 2020-09-28 08:45:46 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RachelBock9 Yeah, I think it's funny that Dems/libs/lefties think we're supposed to be outraged about people not paying more taxes. I don't believe in high taxation and think people who do believe in it should donate their own money directly to the Treasury or to charities.

Women who are personally responsible don't accidentally get pregnant when there are dozens of birth control options available to them along with charting apps and good old abstinence.

I'm sure the answer is a highly capable nanny or three (though it could be the kids' grandparents for all I know), just like everyone else in that cohort.
1309984877119406081 2020-09-27 06:35:07 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @Philosophi_Cat I recommend that person stay home as much as possible, work online, shop online, get sunshine in their own backyard. That's what they told everyone else to do for the majority of this year.

The abortion industry is sick and perpetuates itself through lies and omissions; the ppl who support abortion are anti-science and anti-human and will say anything to shirk responsibility and avoid shame.

1309217044865396738 2020-09-25 03:44:02 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RachelBock9 Reproductive "freedom" is being used up and thrown away while living like a slave to hormonal birth control, hormonal emergency contraception, and hormone-blocking abortion methods. Even without the moral part of this equation, such "freedom" is hell on a woman's body and mind.

1308928657440743424 2020-09-24 08:38:05 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TomPiroli The most widely spread BLM narratives (Brown, Floyd, Taylor, Blake) cast people who are criminals and/or complicit as completely innocent victims. Hmm.

If a woman doesn't believe that men in drag should be able to compete with (and steal scholarships from and injure) girls and women, you're called a bigoted TERF!
1308222932750143488 2020-09-22 09:53:47 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @nintendlo That's impossible because there is no other point to current Western feminism. What rights and protections do we as women not have, lol? Feminism has to make up problems that don't even exist to stay relevant, e.g. the wage gap and the pink tax.

Veganism is death; everyone gives up on it once essential stores in their livers are inevitably depleted (or they keep up the charade by sneaking eggs, milk, or fish). So many vibrant young ppl are being guilted and destroyed by vegan propaganda.

1307922606880890880 2020-09-21 14:00:24 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> Why are so many women over 30 who have IUDs and who only have sex with guys who wear condoms and who can get Plan B at any nearby store still so obsessively worried about access to abortion? Something doesn't add up.

Imo, it's cruel and unusual to put kids in the 50th percentile in high-level programs w/ kids in the 90th+ percentiles and expect good and even outcomes.
1307800918914748416 2020-09-21 05:56:51 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @EntrepreneurVyl If we truly live in a patriarchal rape culture hellscape run by murderous cops and a maniacal fascist, shouldn't *all* ppl, particularly women, own guns? I can't say I understand anti-gun "logic" in any context, esp. not by these people's own ideas and fabrications about society.
1307798925596909568 2020-09-21 05:48:56 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @TheEpicDept These are the same people who really believe "one death is too many" from any sort of disease (i.e. Covid) or violence (i.e. gun). Absurd childlike thinking, a fantastical view of mortality to ward off the reality of life and death.
1307788061800099844 2020-09-21 05:05:46 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @BasedMelania Harris will take over within a matter of weeks if Biden wins. Guaranteed. And we also deserve our decline for allowing that to happen.

1306396026455154689 2020-09-17 08:54:19 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> "Empathy" somehow means significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers for these kids, too, along with obliterating any sense of normalcy.

And to say that normal people can't teach their own kids, at least in K-8 material, is also a hideously sad testament to our current culture or another insulting low-expectation trap.

1304143447725617153 2020-09-11 03:43:22 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @tweetGEEKED I wouldn't say homeschooling is expensive in terms of time per se. I think most kids, without all the rigamarole of the school schedule and managing 30 other kids in a classroom, only need two to three hours a day of dedicated "academic" work. Child supervision is the real issue.

But the weird kids who are creepy or off-putting or booger-eaters are the ones I personally wouldn't choose to be around for hours and hours a week like 13 years of school forced me to be.
1304140388899475456 2020-09-11 03:31:13 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @RRR0BYN Yep. Drag kids, trans kids, and "queer kids" are all part of this subversion, as is all of the inescapable branding and PR for Planned Parenthood, a place where minors have access to birth control and abortion without parental knowledge or permission.

Some very much are like prison, and looking back, teachers were often total assholes for no good reason. Some teachers were great, though. It's almost like people have different experiences and that public schools are institutional settings, lol.

1300633457958301697 2020-09-01 11:15:55 +0800 <tyger_tyger_> @asachetofmyrrh I actually find comfort in Calvin's direct writings (not necessarily the modern interpretations of them), which I know is a bit weird to a lot of people, lol. But Orthodoxy is intriguing. Tradition, culture, and reverence matter.

How did you decide to explore and then convert to Orthodoxy given your family and friend situation? (I'm loving all the Orthodox enthusiasm here on Twitter btw. It's definitely piqued my curiosity.)
