1344068554027638784 2020-12-30 07:51:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DrDenaGrayson Let me guess what will happen in the “richest nation in the world” (America). Millions of #COVIDIOTS will spread it like wildfire while 99% of us have not been vaccinated. GOP won’t care bc they’re all vaccinated &amp; think they’re immune. We’ll be forced to work w/new virus too.
1344063601234096141 2020-12-30 07:31:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Cowboyzion01 @mhdksafa Amen!!!
1344063481377665031 2020-12-30 07:31:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mhdksafa You should be proud of how much you have achieved! At least you didn’t blow through daddy’s millions, cheat workers out of pay, bankrupt small businesses, rip ppl off w/fake university, pay for porn stars w/campaign funds &amp; sexually assault over 20 women including raping a child.
1344062675647606784 2020-12-30 07:28:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TG22110 Isn’t it Tuesday?!

1344055412589555714 2020-12-30 06:59:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JamesLindholm1 No. Many asthmatics in my family &amp; they wear masks. If they get #COVID19 &amp; it affects their lungs, it will be a whole lot worse than any asthma attack.
1344055053192220676 2020-12-30 06:57:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ASlavitt And now it will spread like wildfire because we have too many #COVIDIOTS in America. Smfh
1344054688044511237 2020-12-30 06:56:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @istg_imfunny @gbothrey1 @Skaramousche @Mister_Canada_ Exactly. It’s widespread in public now. I’m a New Yorker. I was here on 9/11. I saw hate personally. But in NY we fought hard to NOT go against Muslims; it took time but we did it. I protested Trump’s Muslim ban; we stepped aside &amp; protected Muslims who had to pray during protest

They used racial slurs in a phone convo they had. But it was all kept hush hush &amp; we were not powerful enough to do something about it then. Look at how Gov George Wallace was talking out loud shamelessly; he ran for POTUS 4 times &amp; it was ok.
1344048570203299841 2020-12-30 06:32:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @istg_imfunny @gbothrey1 @Skaramousche @Mister_Canada_ I agree.

That was NOT the case during Reagan era. We’ve advanced a lot more now.
1344041473101213697 2020-12-30 06:03:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NikeNoir @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That’s happening right now. As long as they can keep the poor working for low wages so the rich can get richer, that’s exactly the scenario 1% wants. We need to elect everyday ppl to congress &amp; we need to ram democratic agenda &amp; laws down GOP throats when we take senate ASAP!

That family should be arrested for ENDANGERING LIVES of others! They are KNOWINGLY spreading deadly #COVID19 It should be a crime to do this!! Please #WearAMask to protect yourselves!!!
1344028847407325184 2020-12-30 05:13:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump “Richest nation in the world” loves to judge/criticize poorer nations yet screwing up vaccine production &amp; DISTRIBUTION to Americans!! This country is ONLY for the rich. The rest of us are going to go broke &amp;/or die! Maybe GOP thinks it’s the best way to make America white?
1344021912016584704 2020-12-30 04:46:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @girlsreallyrule @CNN Wonder how many abortions he paid for?

Hopefully people will realize nothing good for the people will ever get done in Biden administration if GOP keeps the Senate.

Giving PPP to corporations &amp; your GOP cronies who own businesses right? Giving billions to dumb Space Force &amp; racist wall right? Now all of a sudden, you care about national debt!!

GOP did this behind closed doors but now it’s a badge of honor &amp; NOT career-ending to show your true ugly colors in public. MoC, radio/tv personalities, performers, MAGAts all spew hate &amp; we’re numb to it.

1343603416795381761 2020-12-29 01:03:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is one of the reasons why trump pardoned Stone. He will continue to be part of #TrumpsDomesticTerroristKlan &amp; continue trump’s irrational rhetoric after he’s out of office. These ppl are as dangerous as trump.
1343602706657767427 2020-12-29 01:00:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GeraldDMV And then there are GOP racists who when they see unarmed #BlackLivesMatter protests call us terrorists, rioters &amp; looters. Got it.

I’ve had at least 25-30 family members &amp; 25-30 coworkers get it. 3 coworkers died; BIL in ICU since 11/4 unresponsive-woke up 12/21-long road to recovery. 12/15-12/21 3 more in family got it; 1 is 1 yr old baby.

1343564352398495744 2020-12-28 22:27:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Skaramousche @Mister_Canada_ I agree. We just didn’t realize it. GOP has been in total control for 10 years. Even when they weren’t the majority, they were getting their agenda thru because Democrats don’t know how to say no to them. We need democrats who fight against &amp; stand up to GOP.
1343562197826478083 2020-12-28 22:19:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KathleenKatfox Not me.

1343559947943104513 2020-12-28 22:10:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @david_hemond Sounds exactly like a GOP bill. And then no one can sue employers/businesses when they get infected due to their negligence &amp; irresponsibility &amp; greed.
1343559169467686913 2020-12-28 22:07:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ResisterSis20 Exactly!!!
1343558160758538251 2020-12-28 22:03:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RBReich People have lost 1 week of unemployment which hurts them even more economically but rich people just don’t get what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck &amp; then live on unemployment which is much less than their paychecks. Politicians are out of touch &amp; don’t care.
1343557414050803714 2020-12-28 22:00:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Mister_Canada_ Not under the rule of trump &amp; GOP it is not! We’ve been suckered into believing it was great while they tax us into poverty; pay extremely low wages; burden our kids w/high interest student loans so many don’t get advanced degrees; &amp; illegally enrich themselves by insider trading
1343556036217745409 2020-12-28 21:54:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DrPhillipsMD You should never regret speaking truth. You’re an honorable man. Many doors will open for you.

If we’d locked down for 3-4 months back in April, we would be much better off today. It’s shameless the way America claims to be the “richest nation in the world” but when we needed help, it failed us!
1343425181709201409 2020-12-28 13:14:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @3obergs I’ve noticed the bitchy women get better results too. They get everything they want whether or not they’re good back to the men. When women are too nice, some take advantage.

1343386509899165703 2020-12-28 10:41:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jeffpeguescbs @CBSNews This is the ONLY info we will get! Garner was accused of selling “loosies”, Floyd of passing fake $20, Breonna of accepting drug packages to justify their murders by racist cops. Different laws for different folks. They won’t want to make Warner look like a domestic terrorist.🤬

1343349962038456320 2020-12-28 08:16:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!! This is the chart they use to excuse heinous/terrorist crimes in America. Remember how they tried to trash Floyd’s, Garner’s &amp; Breonna Taylor’s reputations to justify/excuse their murders by racist cops? It will go away to protect his legacy. #DomesticTerrorist
1343348766682869760 2020-12-28 08:11:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ShimonPro They’ll sweep truth under the rug to protect 1 of their own. They’ll later claim it was to prevent public anger but that’s a lie! Remember when they tried to destroy George Floyd &amp; Eric Garner’s reputations to excuse/justify their murders by racist cops? What’s Warner’s story?!?!
1343346155732787200 2020-12-28 08:00:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @oregonvirginia It’s not a suicide. It’s a domestic terrorist attack. If it had been a POC, they’d be arresting POC who’ve protested w/BLM etc all over the place. We’d be getting attacked by MAGAts, GOP MoC, trump etc. They’ll justify coverup by saying they didn’t want to incite violence. BS!

It’s a real picture &amp; represents many #MAGAts who are poor &amp; want to blame immigrants for it. Part of their fascination w/trump is they thought they’d end up living in luxury during his presidency.

Guaranteed it’s 1 of Trump’s crazed/twisted domestic terrorists who did this to Dem city w/Dem mayor. They won’t attack McConnell’s state. Regardless, police are paid to protect so they had to do their job. #MAGAts kill cops. Don’t waste time w/JS!

1342942662328987648 2020-12-27 05:17:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @InTheNoosphere @peace1 Somehow their economy will survive. But in USA, the “richest nation in the world” (what a freaking joke), if we had shut down EARLY for 3-4 months, GOP claims our economy would collapse. They’re just worried about stock market which is NOT the economy; it’s how they get rich. 🤬

Trump has inspired domestic terrorism &amp; they will be going out to many scenes like this. Trump puts their lives in danger. Were civilians supposed to go out instead? Don’t think so.
1342862893679783936 2020-12-27 00:00:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Trump defunded the police in my city. No more overtime or training for new cops; no more raises for or hiring at ALL Cory agencies. We are broke because Trump/GOP won’t give us some of OUR federal money to reimburse us for #TrumpVirus expenses. #TrumpDefundsPolice

You LOST LEGITIMATELY by over 7 million more votes!! 2/3 of your votes are rigged. 2/3 of your followers are Russian bots. You’re a threat to democracy &amp; our lives. #TrumpVirus

1342546698103631872 2020-12-26 03:04:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is bad. Trump’s domestic terrorists will continue the domestic terrorism in America.
1342546175174578181 2020-12-26 03:02:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Merry “fucking” Christmas #TrumpCrimeFamily You have destroyed the soul of America!!! #TraitorTrump needs to be held accountable for #CrimesAgainstHumanity MS13 &amp; Isis are not a threat to America; Trump’s “fine people” are domestic terrorists.
1342544941596209153 2020-12-26 02:57:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KFILE I’m so very very sorry for the loss of your beloved baby girl. 😢😭💔🙏🏽 God be with you all.

1342543480250392577 2020-12-26 02:51:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #TrumpsDomesticTerrorists will do this regularly now; just warming up. Trump should be arrested for spreading racism/hate, inciting violence &amp; causing death!! His #MAGAts did this in Christmas, remember that! Forget Isis, the true terrorists in America are Trump’s “fine people”!
1342542536481660930 2020-12-26 02:47:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @snakefoodfarmer How adorable and unique! Beautiful baby boy!!

1342537409523830785 2020-12-26 02:27:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FLOTUS What about the 337,612 your husband killed?! If they each have at least 10 people who loved them, that’s OVER 3.3 MILLION people who did NOT have a merry Christmas bc they lost a grandparent, parent, son, daughter, brother, sister, aunt or uncle! Some lost more than 1! Monsters!

1342405093744914433 2020-12-25 17:41:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump Don’t think the family &amp; friends, who number at least 3.44 MILLION, of the ppl your father killed #TrumpVirusDeathToll344K had a “Merry” Christmas with an empty chair at the dinner table! This is NOT your holiday anyway! It’s the night Baby Jesus was born &amp; he was given refuge!!

1342168114247700483 2020-12-25 01:59:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @snarkgrapefruit Wow!!!! That is a Christmas gift. Addiction hurts the addict &amp; their families too. What a blessing. I pray he stays sober.

1342148864829222917 2020-12-25 00:43:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realHeatherD @ReverendWarnock You are so right.
1342148740635910144 2020-12-25 00:42:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realHeatherD @penner1129 @ReverendWarnock Biden can do new Executive Orders to change things.
1342002003644469248 2020-12-24 14:59:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris They too should know we will be watching to make sure they make things better QUICKLY! No negotiating w/GOP. Use Executive Orders to get things done/undone IMMEDIATELY! Pols always promise &amp; take years to comply. WE CANNOT WAIT! Trump did many bad things w/the stroke of his pen.
1342001063025643520 2020-12-24 14:56:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @shalee1964 @mikefly562 @davenewworld_2 Sad. Terrible.
1342000670480740353 2020-12-24 14:54:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KeithGrant09 @mmpadellan Right!!!
1342000488489902080 2020-12-24 14:53:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I meant he had better not forget his campaign promises to help the people.
1341987473237413889 2020-12-24 14:02:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris He better not &amp; if Harris does not convince him to do it, she will lose young ppl when she runs. They already did not like that she was a prosecutor (I love her &amp; Biden) &amp; they will regret their votes. We will all be closely watching our great new leaders; don’t disappoint us.
1341985921298812928 2020-12-24 13:55:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @willsmithfocus @KeithGrant09 @mmpadellan Yes. We are peasants to the GOP.

1341984765407322112 2020-12-24 13:51:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SV_108 @funder It’s completely unlikely. I will NEVER vote for ANY rich white GOP ever!!! Ever! I won’t soon forget how they almost DESTROYED our democracy &amp; how much DEATH they brought us via COVID &amp; mass shootings in schools &amp; ICE/CBP at the border. GOP are TRAITORS!!
1341983400052326401 2020-12-24 13:45:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Starmother3 @funder Ditto!!!
1341983303319101447 2020-12-24 13:45:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @workin_person @funder Think it’s a great idea. Want to do the same! #NoMillionairesInCongress They’re not working for the measly salary for the people; they have their own agenda part of which is to get inside info to make more money &amp; enact laws to benefit the rich. No one gets rich off $174K salary!
1341982097976807424 2020-12-24 13:40:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @funder I know hundreds of ppl who never will. And the millions of relatives of the 334,000 dead from #TrumpVirus won’t be voting GOP either. If each had just 10 ppl who loved them, that’s 3,340,000 relatives-OVER 3.3 MILLION VOTERS who despise trump &amp; GOP (minus a few thousand MAGAts).
1341980745036951554 2020-12-24 13:35:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MaidoftheBrins @davenewworld_2 Cops were chicken shit scared when they asked him to step out of his car &amp; saw how big &amp; strong he was; then the dad was ANOTHER big guy so they pooped their pants. Feared for their lives just bc guys were big!!! The criminals are the #ThugsInBlue #ReformThePolice 🤬🤬
1341979650420060160 2020-12-24 13:30:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RupertVillanue2 @papasmurf910 @davenewworld_2 Cops were scared of the size of both guys. Cops were pissing in their pants. So the cops escalated things enough to put him in handcuffs so they could feel tougher &amp; safe. BUT THE BIG GUYS ARE DECENT CITIZENS WHO WERE NOT GOING TO ATTACK THE COPS! They need to sue! They WILL win!
1341976540838506497 2020-12-24 13:18:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Pikazopr @davenewworld_2 Most likely.

1341976125728284674 2020-12-24 13:16:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Juris_Sequoia @davenewworld_2 Cops should be fired if police departments get sued &amp; the plaintiffs win a settlement!!! It should be in their contracts. If the cities have to pay for cops’ brutality or abuse, they are guilty of it &amp; should be FIRED!!
1341975479146983426 2020-12-24 13:14:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davenewworld_2 #TrumpDefundedPolice in ALL 50 states!!! Good!!! This will give us a great opportunity to #ReformThePolice
1341975104478191617 2020-12-24 13:12:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> These are NOT cops!!! They are #ThugsInBlue Why do they have to treat the citizens who pay their salaries like criminals?! They aggravate the situations. They’re scared cause the guys are big. That does not make them criminals!! #ReformThePolice Glad that #TrumpDefundedPolice !!
1341973745632739329 2020-12-24 13:07:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow Regardless, the #GOPIsDead The great diverse youth of America who are victims of racism, homophobia &amp; sexism are coming for all the GOP!! They are WOKE. They will no longer be complacent. I hear their roar.
1341972912467832832 2020-12-24 13:04:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @atensnut 81 million of us LEGALLY voted for #PresidentBiden &amp; #VicePresidentHarris Your dear leader is pardoning Russian assets &amp; murderers &amp; corrupt thieves &amp; traitors in the GOP.

1341971408046465024 2020-12-24 12:58:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PreetBharara Trump is a murderer who pardons murderers of brown children.

It really should be ILLEGAL to work in any government agency (federal, state, city) or run fir ANY government office!!! We can’t have criminals in those jobs! Do we want criminal doctors, cops, firefighters, bankers etc?!

We need TOUGH DEMOCRATS who are keeping pace w/real problems &amp; can find solutions to really represent us.

American justice system is a failure &amp; Constitution is weak. Trump is letting out the swamp from jails!! There will be more criminal GOP running around free than MS13! They’re the real threats to us.
1341908321410949120 2020-12-24 08:47:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kaitlancollins Unbelievable how much power a corrupt president is allowed! Norms, traditions, protocols, rules, regulations &amp; laws can all be broken by a POTUS bC he can’t be prosecuted while he’s committing crimes in office!!

I read a lot my entire life &amp; learned a lit through high school. No college degree but am a whole lot smarter than many who do have one. What I don’t know about, I teach myself about.

1341895964232212482 2020-12-24 07:58:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @shakuntalasmith @SpeakerPelosi Because America/GOP only cares about money &amp; its 1%.

Many are very competent &amp; dedicated, but their time is limited to handle all their cases properly. A POC would be awaiting trial in jail too. Not all have equal rights. 🤬

1341887931125006336 2020-12-24 07:26:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @glennkirschner2 And 5)No pardons for “future” crimes for which someone has not even been charged &amp; indicted!! Bad enough there are statutes of limitation but thank God Trump can’t pardon for state crimes. Governors can though &amp; he’s setting a horrendous precedent!

Corruption rampant!!

However, when you’re a leader/owner of a “church” like Olsteen etc, you do not pay taxes on any “church” property, “church” purchases or utilities, or income which these “leaders” use to live off of. I used to process tax exempt certs.

Today, my bro in law of 42 years, who got #COVID19 &amp; had been unresponsive in ICU for 48 days, finally became alert &amp; spoke! Hundreds of us were blessed. Christmas miracle.🙏🏽
1341620246130651137 2020-12-23 13:42:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mattgaetz Do u know antibodies are not forever? Do u know u CAN get #COVID19 MORE than 1 time? Do u know it can trigger serious health problems months later? Do u know it can leave permanent damage? Do u know u can die suddenly even after u no longer have it? I know ppl in all of the above

Doesn’t it make people wonder how they become millionaires? I know lots of ppl who earn that &amp; NEVER get rich.

We need to get rid of the rich traitors. They have now mass murdered Americans bc of their greed &amp; corruption, never mind wrecking economy!!

Instead of staying to block trump, he’s leaving to save himself &amp; leaving the door WIDE OPEN to allow Trump to install a puppet who WILL do whatever trump wants! Barr knows that will happen. He just didn’t want to be the one doing it.
1341081732263661570 2020-12-22 02:02:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Exactly!!! Barr knows Trump will install someone who will do his bidding!!! Barr should have stayed to block him. Instead he’s saving himself &amp; leaving the door to DOJ wide open!!!
1341073159844474883 2020-12-22 01:28:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BrighidsForge @DrEricDing It’s already here. Trump &amp; GOP knew early too about #newcoronavirusstrain like with #COVID19 The #Fuckers just care about money; tourism &amp; saving airlines.
1341072291199922176 2020-12-22 01:25:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ababrown5 @DrEricDing Which is why I love him.
1341072194777083904 2020-12-22 01:25:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ababrown5 @DrEricDing Newsome will be doing same. Cuomo cannot control airport but he does control land that it’s on. He must use ALL his power to prevent them from setting foot on our streets. Hope he does it!! Why are we NOT closing ALL our borders to a #newcovidstrain like 120 OTHER nations? MONEY!
1341070939782586371 2020-12-22 01:20:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo Do what is legally in your power to prevent international travelers from entering NY thru JFK!! You know trump regime will NOT stop overseas planes from landing on our shores w/NEW #COVID19 strain. Do not let them out of the airport. We’ve suffered enough.🙏🏽 God bless
1341069246466551808 2020-12-22 01:13:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jon_moulin @FemiOlawole The ones to blame for the state we are all in are ONLY Trump &amp; GOP; unfortunately ppl like McConnell keep getting elected. Elections have consequences. If we don’t get the Senate, it’s all downhill from here!!
1341065928814039041 2020-12-22 01:00:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOP are a disgusting breed full of adulterers, wife-beaters, crooks, traitors, murderers &amp; PEDOPHILES!!!

1341063717702742022 2020-12-22 00:51:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo asked several airlines to require testing BEFORE bringing ppl to NY’s JFK. @British_Airways is only 1 which has agreed to do it. @Delta better do same!! 120 nations have banned travel to/from UK &amp; Cuomo asked that NY be added; told we’re not a country! #ShutDownJFKNow

1341059492658749443 2020-12-22 00:34:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @UrbanExtant Exactly!! No matter what, we should all pay a fair share of taxes. We should also have our fair share of deductions for property taxes, child care etc. We are supporting the entire government. The rich MUST pay taxes &amp; should not deduct 3-martini lunches.

Well, let’s see what happens in the next few weeks with this NEW #COVID19 strain. At least other countries are saving their ppl. Not America though. We are screwed!

1340888251377344513 2020-12-21 13:14:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Smilan317 Should have been $1,200 per month for every adult who earns under $150,000 for at least 6 months (April-Sept) to stay home!

Working/middle class w/no kids are paying most of the taxes so they’re being destroyed. Ones w/kids need deductions but they also need to earn more to pay for all expenses. Then there’s student loan debt.

1340829696171323397 2020-12-21 09:21:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @washingtonpost We are back to the rich getting even more perks!!! We pay for those caviar &amp; champagne meals but federal minimum wage is $7.25 in America. 🤬🤬
1340829042111619074 2020-12-21 09:18:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ChrisMurphyCT But they get to write off expensive meals at Trump venues which means we pay for those meals. Also, did they get corporate liability waiver so they can continue to kill people with #Covid_19 ?
1340828176013029376 2020-12-21 09:15:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tfmartintf @KlotzBets @IThinkImLost2 Thank you. 🙏🏽❤️
1340826907659612160 2020-12-21 09:10:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump You have helped to kill over 320,000 Americans but we paid for your vaccine. Shameless! Now you will continue hurting &amp; killing people any way you can.
1340825993813045250 2020-12-21 09:06:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So the rich got more tax breaks. GOP supporters can now eat at Trump venues for extravagant prices &amp; we pay for those meals. How nice!!!

1340824995178668032 2020-12-21 09:02:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> It’s a slap in the face from the “richest” nation in the world. It’s embarrassing &amp; humiliating.

1340818555026239488 2020-12-21 08:37:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Nothing would’ve been better so that GOP got nothing too! Honestly people, how far will $600 go when people have been struggling for 9 months. The $1,200 averaged out to $133.00 per month. We got more crumbs again while GOP gets caviar.
1340815328859877377 2020-12-21 08:24:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @senatemajldr A whole $600 for some!!! GEE WIZ!!! You are so very generous with OUR money!!!

Stay home &amp; protect yourself because our government is ungrateful &amp; selfish.

1340766899181907968 2020-12-21 05:11:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @myaiswhoiam @Goss30Goss So GOP do not bring it to a vote because majority leader says no? Why can’t a democrat senator bring a bill to the floor for a vote? Back to square 1; Moscow Mitch will decline to put any bill up for a vote. That’s ludicrous. It should be a law that ALL bills MUST be voted on.

God knows how many more tens of thousands of our ballots were never delivered &amp; counted! Most probably for Biden! In this day &amp; age, in “richest” country in the world, we should be able to confirm our votes!!
1340754762556424200 2020-12-21 04:23:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KaivanShroff Those privileged who’ve been vaccinated should go do the work of those who are not yet vaccinated. Instead, they will now feel more powerful &amp; invincible &amp; FORCE people to go to work in hazardous conditions so their rich donors make more money!!
1340753682409938944 2020-12-21 04:19:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Now that u got vaccine, u want others who have not been vaccinated to risk their lives so they can keep making money for ur rich supporters! It’s all abt power &amp; money for GOP NOT lives!! Ppl should’ve gotten $1,500 monthly for 6 months(April-Sept); would not be where we are!🤬

1340749963333165062 2020-12-21 04:04:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is how way too many cops talk behind our backs. There should be a requirement to report any abusive talk/behavior (doctors must report abuse) &amp; guarantee there will be no retaliation. Good cops should be proud to help weed out the bad guys who make them look bad. Investigate

Just give it to the rest of us. I’m telling it like it is!!  The GOP do not deserve the vaccine BEFORE ALL our first responders &amp; vulnerable.

Hizo pacto con el diablo a pesar de que trump ha cometido crimines inhumanos contra ustedes en vez de enfrentarlo. Ahora, los americanos los odian a ustedes!

Our best bet is to vaccinate as many as the rest of us as quickly as possible so we can be protected. Some science-denying mask-less GOP filth like Rubio take it bc they’re afraid to die.
1340474039735889921 2020-12-20 09:48:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PeterPanagioto3 @ossoff Exactly!!! It’s a joke that we claim to be the “richest” nation in the world. We can’t take care of our citizens with our own money. It’s not charity we’re asking for. GOP relies on the good rich democrats to donate &amp; the rest of us who donate too.

1340469322595098625 2020-12-20 09:29:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @odessaphi52 @neal_katyal @ps9714 We can’t force anti-vaxxers to take it. We can require proof of vaccine at schools/jobs etc. Hopefully vaccine protects us; better than nothing. I do feel for the few who want it but may not be able to take it. I think ultimately they plan to give it to everyone who wants it.
1340468210118893568 2020-12-20 09:25:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @vanderwel_nancy Our American 1% oligarchs will suck us dry &amp; then move to 1 of the islands they’ve purchased to live in luxury till they die. They don’t love America. They don’t care if they leave &amp; never return. It’s not their homeland as it is ours; it’s their cash cow. We are being exploited!

1339776923061407744 2020-12-18 11:38:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MollieKatzen @SerenaShimAward That’s exactly what he’s doing. So if they don’t get 2nd dose, it means trump wasted billions more on the 1st dose &amp; people won’t get total vaccination. He definitely does not want to send it to blue states.
1339776331798749185 2020-12-18 11:35:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @nixw20 No. What’s wrong?

1339763835360718848 2020-12-18 10:46:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 85 MILLION paid out in Chicago for lawsuits against the police!!! They’re paid to break the laws &amp; taxpayers are paying for the lawsuits too. Smfh #ReformThePolice

1339761435015061505 2020-12-18 10:36:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @rayleengale Trump is waiting to see which GOP governors, mayors, senators etc pay him the most money AND he’s definitely not sending complete vaccine doses to BLUE STATES! We are pendejos if we think trump would not sabotage vaccine distribution. Trump wants his cut!

1339750557196664833 2020-12-18 09:53:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Trump was just going to tease us. Did you all really think he wanted the rest if us ti get it? If people who already got the vaccine don’t get the second dose in 21-28 days, it’s most likely money down the drain. That’s how Trump runs his businesses.

1339620418966204418 2020-12-18 01:16:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricKleefeld This is what happens when we DEMOCRATS get the GOP used to us NOT voting!!! Our voices matter!!! They better get used to this!

1339420523147747330 2020-12-17 12:01:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AZGOP Why was Trump president-elect 1 day after Election Day 2016? They were invited into WH days later. Putin sabotaged our votes then. This time we voted in numbers too large to sabotage. Biden won by 306 to 232 EC &amp; 7 million votes more! CONGRESS WILL CERTIFY! #PresidentBiden Tough!

For those who are months behind in rent or who rely on unemployment (some states can extend it), $1,200 ONCE will NOT help at all. What about food, utilities, warm clothing etc?! States/cities are broke. GOP wants to indemnify corps!

When you say you have evidence, where is it?! Courts rely on documented proof not the mere words of looney lawyers like Giuliani.

1339261416063242258 2020-12-17 01:29:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @washingtonpost NOPE!!! With or without trump, there would’ve been a vaccine. Why?! Because they were already ahead w/virus research like SARS &amp; COVID is related to it. In this pandemic, scientists had to speed up creating a vaccine as there was no time to waste. Trump had NOTHING to do with it.
1339260713177591811 2020-12-17 01:26:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kaitlancollins Aww. He should’ve gone. It’s just a hoax. That’s really BS tho. He’s probably angry about last night’s #FailedPompeoHolidayParty He has realized that #MAGAts support trump NOT him &amp; that a run for president in 2024 is NOT within reach for him even tho he did Trump’s dirty work.😂
1339256763753914374 2020-12-17 01:11:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PamKeithFL Or allowing the rest of us to own guns for protection as easily as they get theirs. I’d rather strict gun laws for ALL. Psychos should not be allowed to buy arsenals.
1339256053633052675 2020-12-17 01:08:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @heatherscope Good. They need to stand their ground for MONTHLY stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits &amp; no waivers of liability to corporations for getting us sick with COVID.
1339255664405848065 2020-12-17 01:06:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Definitely. We should not be living paycheck to paycheck &amp; the rich getting richer on OUR sweat.

This is the work of the GOP-to oppress all except the 1%.

1339022113773064193 2020-12-16 09:38:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @princessamiira No.
1339021687057215488 2020-12-16 09:37:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We have to really stay on top of ALL our elections from now on. He’s right. We must strip power from GOP &amp; abolish them.
1339021359238811654 2020-12-16 09:35:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DanCrenshawTX It was a hoax!!!
1339021119005863936 2020-12-16 09:34:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @semperdiced Beg to differ. He’s NOT gay. He’s one of those pedophile perverts who lure kids with candy &amp; then pray with them saying it’s the will of God. I would not leave a child alone with him.

1339019156633563137 2020-12-16 09:26:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DanaCudmore @NextResort @kylegriffin1 Yes. They deserve it.

I know my family &amp; I will never ever visit there again &amp; we have family &amp; friends there. #DeathSantis is not only killing people there, he’s killing its economy. There are many more like me.
1339018241792991233 2020-12-16 09:23:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ordinary1World We have to take the Senate now. How could any intelligent person blame bad economy &amp; trillions in debt which Trump is leaving us on new administration? Millions are unemployed. Democrat president comes in yet again to save our economy. This time is worse than last GOP regime
1339017487455752192 2020-12-16 09:20:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @nycke1975 @JstnGreen1 I don’t feel bad for liars who support a man who has destroyed our economy, almost destroyed our democracy, has sexually assaulted so many women &amp; possibly raped a 13 yr old child &amp; committed #CrimesAgainstHumanity I hope she never gets a good steady job! She sold her soul!

1339007803042766850 2020-12-16 08:41:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I’ve had a lot of respect for @SteveSchmidtSES for a while now. He stood against trump &amp; never once wavered. He saw trump &amp; current GOP for the corrupt racists that they are. He’s not like them. I hope @AOC meets up with him. They can learn a lot from each other. Ppl w/integrity.
1339005378114318337 2020-12-16 08:32:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @atdavidhoffman Really?!?! I’ve liked him from day 1!
1339004663572672513 2020-12-16 08:29:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ordinary1World Acknowledging Biden won?! #MoscowMitch will NOT work with Biden. Anyone who thinks so is foolish. But you’re right, Mitch doing the right thing will never happen again. 😂

1338980362823864322 2020-12-16 06:52:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FBSaunders @GovRonDeSantis @JoeBiden Good ole #DeathSantis He’s sad that the criminal who encouraged &amp; enabled him to kill his constituents will no longer be around to support him. GOP is nuts if they think trump’s going to go around campaigning for them for FREE. They’ll have to PAY him extravagantly &amp; ppl are WOKE
1338951768705789953 2020-12-16 04:59:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kvghopper @kjw2001 @MichaelJElston There is very little tourism. Most of us/world are not traveling especially to FL which is infested w/COVID thanks to #DeathSantis It’s all the Floridians who are out &amp; about. FL has to pay for high costs of administering vaccine(2 doses) &amp; COVID hospitalizations. It’s sad.
1338933632610816000 2020-12-16 03:47:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheRickyDavila This is NOT a press conference. This is #TrumpPropagandaPresser She comes out to read her script full of lies to please dear leader &amp; then runs out.
1338933064915935234 2020-12-16 03:44:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @leeson_erica @AnthonySabatini The problem is they’ve forgotten about their ancestors in essence denying their heritage.

1338932231524544514 2020-12-16 03:41:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @arundeepyeg @Joyce_Karam We know what the future holds if we don’t take the Senate. Obstruction on all levels beginning with confirmations for the next 4 years; while they continue gerrymandering &amp; perfecting their voter suppression.
1338931764757209089 2020-12-16 03:39:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @arundeepyeg @Joyce_Karam Then they’re correct in saying “if” &amp; we KNOW they will NOT be confirmed.
1338931043760566272 2020-12-16 03:36:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @arundeepyeg @Joyce_Karam I know but they say it too often. They should just state the name of Biden’s nominees/appointments &amp; position &amp; leave out the part “if confirmed by the Senate”. No need to say it at all. That doesn’t break any decorum. We all know no one will be confirmed; Biden needs a Plan B.
1338929962540277761 2020-12-16 03:32:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acosta @PressSec “Continuation of power”?! This is why people do not respect you.

Be prepared.
1338618817870766080 2020-12-15 06:56:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Barr kissed trump’s ass on his way out!!! 😂😂 Must want a pardon. Prosecute him for his crimes after 1/20/21 when trump is out!! #DisbarBarr

He started insisting on playing his guitar/singing to me; very uncomfortable. I could see him sweating (pervert). Then he tried to kiss me as he gave me my paycheck; slapped him. Needed job but never went back!

He removed me as that man’s secy, gave me promotion to accounting dept &amp; went into pervert’s office to chew him out/threaten him. That higher up is 85 now &amp; still my friend. He also protected me from 1 other pervert.

I was just a little secretary who could just type &amp; take shorthand. I was harassed many times (tried to kiss, hug, touch); propositioned (pay my apt, bills); I was ogled constantly. When that happened, I went to a job agency to go on interviews. Then quit w/a smile.

1337816466842931204 2020-12-13 01:47:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why I don’t go to Catholic Church.

1337600132230025216 2020-12-12 11:28:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 2/2 gesture. What a great example to his sons! Man is a brown immigrant (Indian) who purchased a home in the nabe. Another immigrant who makes America great &amp; will raise kind &amp; caring children. Another great NYC neighbor. He knocked on a few doors tonight. How do we reciprocate?
1337600130548023297 2020-12-12 11:28:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 1/2 I LOVE my diverse NYC! Today my son’s doorbell rang. It was the new neighbor w/his 2 little boys. He said he was checking on his neighbors to see how they’re doing-brought a care package w/fresh vegetables&amp;fruits; my son is not needy but this was such a kind &amp; generous ...

GOP has been slowly demolishing the middle class. We tell our kids to get degrees for better jobs/futures &amp; they STILL can’t earn enough postgrad to live on!!

1337452137463296004 2020-12-12 01:40:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @leahvallee Yes. So do my kids.
1337452082027253760 2020-12-12 01:39:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Another typical @GOP!! They’re either corrupt, crazy, wife beaters, adulterers, sexual assaulters, racists, closet gays, religious fanatics or pedophiles. Take your pick!! This one is a pedophile.

1337451035753930752 2020-12-12 01:35:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo We need to get back from the federal government every last dime our great blue state had to spend on #Covid19 due to Trump’s negligence. New Yorkers pay BILLIONS in fed taxes &amp; we must be reimbursed. It is OUR money not charity! @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Reimburse blue states 1st!!
1337450192308760579 2020-12-12 01:32:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @4a_of Made me dislike religious fanatics even more than I did. They continue to prove me right about how hypocritical, perverse &amp; greedy they are. Don’t feel bad anymore about not going to church regularly; I don’t want to be around “fake” Christians. 🤢🤮 I pray to God daily.

1337425505889497089 2020-12-11 23:54:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Trump’s lawsuits are frivolous. All attorneys/AGs/politicians who signed on to this garbage should be charged w/sedition!! You all think trump has SCOTUS in his pocket. You shall see justice prevail. What you ppl are doing is trying to erase votes of millions! Trump LOST! Filth!!

We need to acknowledge what GOP has been doing for decades &amp; stand up to them now. We can’t keep taking crumbs. White America is scared shitless of being a minority soon. Why?!
1337257572794064896 2020-12-11 12:47:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @accidntlmystic @chiproytx We should NEVER be shamed for insulting any GOP including trump!! They deserve every insult we can hurl at them!!! You’re a racist POS SOB MOFO Chippy!!!

He said “kiss my ass”! You all really must have a solid PLAN B! GOP IS NEW KKK &amp; not ashamed to show it. He’s 1 of 106. @SpeakerPelosi Get rid of them!

1337249142666649602 2020-12-11 12:13:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PreetBharara We should NOT forget 106 House GOP.

Cops get paid unlimited time when out sick; if they don’t recuperate fully, they file for 3/4 disability pay for life. Then they make extra money on the side. That’s the reason they don’t wear masks.

They care ONLY about themselves, CEOs/corporations getting richer! They’re killing us physically &amp; financially. Many will NEVER recover economically. WE WANT OUR FEDERAL MONEY! It’s NOT charity!!

1337066007219855369 2020-12-11 00:05:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He’s right. The GOP has been slowly killing the middle class. My immigrants parents did better than we are &amp; our kids are not doing as well because they’re burdened by massive student debts for 10 years or more after they graduate.

Get him to speak up &amp; shut whole GOP scam down. @MichelleObama Don’t speak to him again if he does not speak up now. It’s almost too late! He’s only LIVING GOP former President!
1336920131495227402 2020-12-10 14:26:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @lotusgdess @Defeat_Trump2 People need to get a better education, better skills for better paying jobs &amp; to travel out of their bubbles to interact with others who are different. Maybe they’d then learn to respect others &amp; stop being ignorant racists. They know nothing about the world.

1336918970063065088 2020-12-10 14:21:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @hushnowlilbaby @EricKleefeld Sadly, red states rely on blue state taxes. As an example, they pay 1 billion in taxes but need 40 billion to survive. The reason why they’re poor (it’s a fact) is because they have GOP leaders. NY pays 90 billion &amp; gets back only 30 billion. The rest goes to govt &amp; red states.
1336918104971108354 2020-12-10 14:18:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @hushnowlilbaby @EricKleefeld Then pp like you should get others to vote blue to get your state on a better path. Never said you are not Americans. There are many like you but NOT enough of you. That’s not my fault. Blame McConnell &amp; GOP! They love to keep ppl poor &amp; uneducated. KY is poor &amp; #45 in education
1336917141312794625 2020-12-10 14:14:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jonathanjewel @EricKleefeld That’s what it’s becoming. GOP are spreading poverty in all states by over-taxing middle class, under-paying working ppl &amp; burdening young ppl w/massive student loan debt bc they want us to stay uneducated esp. POC in blue states. My dtr refuses to get post grad degree-too much $

1336914393964179457 2020-12-10 14:03:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @vicky_dollysmom You are correct. You have a right to protect yourself!! They should be arrested for putting people’s lives in danger. They’re touching their faces, spewing droplets &amp; leaving the virus everywhere they go if they’re infected. They’re a threat to society. Glad I live in NYC.

1336900097414672384 2020-12-10 13:06:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ASlavitt America has no conscience especially under Trump. Many Americans &amp; immigrants esp. undocumented who work long hours for low wages don’t have access to healthcare. There is a lot lacking in America because the rich ppl have it all, mostly at our expense; we make them rich.

1336814342201864198 2020-12-10 07:25:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> They should definitely NOT have a monopoly!!! They can’t even properly handle 1 social media site!
1336813784451649539 2020-12-10 07:23:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Judge needs to be REMOVED FROM THE BENCH. It can &amp; has been done. Judges are NOT above the law-can be punished for abusing their power! Administrative judge in that county should’ve been the one handling such a politically sensitive case!! That would NOT happen in a BLUE STATE!!!
1336806305277894656 2020-12-10 06:53:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Let’s speed this up to 2033!!! Let’s have lots of Brown/Black/Asian babies!!!! Meanwhile, the current diverse young people are sick of the oppression &amp; racism, so they’ll be voting out GOP along w/the rest of us!!!

1336799985053159426 2020-12-10 06:28:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Difference is clear.
1336799333577060354 2020-12-10 06:26:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @hubbubb20 @Scaramucci Exactly.
1336799185522274316 2020-12-10 06:25:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Steve__Atlas @GrassrootsSpeak We have no idea how they’ve been cheating. They have many options. Polls are not an exact science. Trump cheated in 2016. Tried again in 2020 but Dems OVERWHELMED this election by voting by millions more than ever with millions in paper ballots.
1336797693113413632 2020-12-10 06:19:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SafetyPinDaily One of those countries is America.
1336797465253711872 2020-12-10 06:18:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Why aren’t ALL our friends &amp; family, especially first responders, NIT getting Trump’s special #MonoclonalAntibodyTreatment?! I demand to know NOW! @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi This is getting scandalous now! We have loved ones dying DAILY by the thousands!
1336796185240199168 2020-12-10 06:13:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ShimonPro They even brag about their SPECIAL trump #COVID19 treatment which the rest of us don’t get. If we Americans think we would all get vaccines if Trump had won, you’re dead wrong.
1336795661086445568 2020-12-10 06:11:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @FireFoxxxy That will never happen. We need to win the Senate.
1336795279559979010 2020-12-10 06:10:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1336795099305488385 2020-12-10 06:09:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump You lost by over 7 million votes!!! God only knows how many of your millions of votes were flipped from Biden to Trump &amp; how many MAGAts voted illegally more than once!!! You STILL could not cheat like in 2016 because we came out to vote by the millions. #PresidentBiden coming!!!
1336794298994601984 2020-12-10 06:06:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump Listening to your ignorant right wing nut job base again?! Do the freaking math on electoral college. You were an illegitimate president &amp; now you’re an outgoing 1-term impeached forever man ... YOU LOST BIGLY. Pack your bags.
1336793798056308736 2020-12-10 06:04:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump NOPE!!!! PACK YOUR BAGS!!!!
1336787409489588227 2020-12-10 05:38:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenKamalaHarris With all due respect Madam Vice President, EVERYONE who committed crimes during trumps regime must be prosecuted to make an example out of them. We cannot just move forward. Otherwise they will feel empowered to continue with their insanity &amp; corruption.
1336786784232071168 2020-12-10 05:36:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JYSexton You’re right.
1336786458045198336 2020-12-10 05:35:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GrassrootsSpeak Mitch &amp; Lindsey definitely cheated. We were too focused on presidential election.
1336783562763366404 2020-12-10 05:23:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I hope he can get the SPECIAL #COVID19 treatment which rich white GOP like trump, Christie, Carson &amp; Giuliani have gotten. Smfh

1336737083168350209 2020-12-10 02:18:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Exactly what I’ve been saying. Other countries are literally supporting their average citizens so they can stay home during the pandemic. Many countries have flattened the curve. Some have had no cases. All bc the ppl were helped during this pandemic. In USA, only rich are helped

1336733330608369668 2020-12-10 02:03:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jugbo Yes. And that God loves us ALL just as we are. And that God does not want to see us killing each other in the name of 1 religion/1 God or because we are not all the same race/gender. That God is watching us to see if we are good human beings. That God is NOT happy w/most of us.

This “richest nation in the world” should’ve been giving ALL families monthly checks of AT LEAST $1,200 per month. It would save them &amp; the economy! Shame on the American govt when other nations are doing it! We’re not asking for CHARITY, it’s OUR fed taxes!

1336661618395066368 2020-12-09 21:18:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Agree 1,000%!!! Trump cannot get away with his crimes. We cannot let him go around tormenting &amp; terrorizing ppl &amp; spreading racism, chaos &amp; death! Trump has committed many crimes especially #CrimesAgainstHumanity Trump (&amp; many GOP) must pay!

Otherwise, they will be reckless in order to save money &amp; force ppl to come to work in unsafe conditions. Protecting them from liability will put all our lives at risk.

1336557471050035201 2020-12-09 14:25:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DrEricDing GOP gets happy when Brown/Black people die. Trump has some secret concoction he’s giving to ppl like Christie &amp; Giuliani. He even permitted Carson (his token Black) to get the treatment that his privileged GOP rich White people get.
1336556759079596033 2020-12-09 14:22:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 @ireallydocare2 Of course they had Mexicans working. They can be exploited for a few dollars a day (like they do to the ones who live here) &amp; the contractors pocket the remaining tens of thousands if not millions, depending on whether they’ve been doing it for 4 years.

1336521847437996032 2020-12-09 12:03:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DrKarb @dkcu_f I wish they could be denied treatment-they’re putting your lives at risk. It’s criminal.

1336475798849597440 2020-12-09 09:00:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin I truly hope trump is prosecuted. He has committed many crimes; financial, sexual &amp; accessory to murder of 100’s of 1,000’s in USA &amp; abroad. USA should not be afraid or ashamed to prosecute a former president. Trump should be used as an example of what a POTUS can NEVER do again!

1336155274231558147 2020-12-08 11:46:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Too bad Trump didn’t come to his rescue with the “special” #COVID19 treatment only these people are getting.
1336154866759118848 2020-12-08 11:45:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LauraRuggiero9 @chrislhayes @maddow @Lawrence Thank you. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
1336154370233217024 2020-12-08 11:43:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jdwickie @NancySinatra @LindseyGrahamSC 😂😂😂
1336153734980755457 2020-12-08 11:40:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jenasummerlin Right!!!
1336153376988536833 2020-12-08 11:39:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dshe51arerDiana I’m ok with that.
1336152945830793216 2020-12-08 11:37:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump Looks like pictures from a horror movie.
1336152852486565892 2020-12-08 11:37:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump You are not staying there nor EVER coming back into our White House. Consider this your goodbye tour! Don’t go back to NYC either! You are pariahs!!! You are as evil as your father. I feel sorry for your brood. Pack your bags!! Get out!! #TrumpCrimeFamily
1336151126622744577 2020-12-08 11:30:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We cannot abandon Rebekah &amp; we cannot let DeSantis get away with these gestapo tactics!!!
1336150631921410049 2020-12-08 11:28:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @xxdr_zombiexx @Jonbassett6 But GOP senate is saying they will not confirm Biden’s AG unless he/she promises not to prosecute trump. Biden better find a way around that FAST! Gloves must come off!!
1336129453169192961 2020-12-08 10:04:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mccaffreyr3 Yeah but the racists in GOP Senate will not confirm simply because he’s Black. @JoeBiden &amp; Democrats @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi need to take the gloves off!!!
1336129052013367297 2020-12-08 10:02:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Thuringwethill @jaketapper So are you saying Biden should be appointing all white male GOPs to his cabinet &amp; other positions? Obama placated then &amp; look where we are! Why did we vote for him then? Biden needs to use ALL his presidential powers to ensure everyone he nominates is in, period.
1336127566449696768 2020-12-08 09:56:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tedcruz You’re an idiot. Not going up for oral argument.

1336124846300930055 2020-12-08 09:46:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PattyArquette @LindseyGrahamSC His election &amp; McConnell’s need to be audited. Democrats did not cheat otherwise they would’ve lost. We were too focused on electing Biden &amp; these 2 cheated whiled we weren’t looking.
1336124029607022593 2020-12-08 09:42:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindseyGrahamSC They would be co-conspirators not friends. A handful still have integrity. Are you going to get dirt on them to blackmail them? Is this a threat?
1336123771703488513 2020-12-08 09:41:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindseyGrahamSC NOT HAPPENING YOU CRIMINAL!!! We will find out what Trump has on you bc my mama always told me that “Papa Dios” is watching &amp; the truth will ALWAYS come out!! You are despicable!! You’re not immortal. Thank God you won’t leave any of your own kids behind to replace you.
1336123069899927552 2020-12-08 09:38:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindseyGrahamSC You’re out of your corrupt mind!!! Trump LOST!!! You rigged YOUR election! We should investigate! Why it it so hard for you creeps to believe that millions of us organized/registered/voted to get rid of criminal traitor trump?! WE ARE THE MAJORITY! We took OUR America back! #FDT
1336122175250722817 2020-12-08 09:35:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AdamParkhomenko We need to take revenge. We need to investigate &amp; prosecute many for all their crimes.

1336120826479964161 2020-12-08 09:30:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Astartiel @CBSNews There is NO “if”. Trump did this to him.
1336120675757666304 2020-12-08 09:29:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Of course. Trump is on a revenge tour. @JoeBiden will see he gets his job back. He should just relax for the next few weeks. He needs the rest.

We will also rise up against the GOP!! Tell your colleagues we have had enough!!
1336118140535779328 2020-12-08 09:19:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheEliasRework @kirkacevedo Only the rich white ppl have privileges. We can’t even get some of OUR money back in our own pockets during this pandemic. It’s not freaking charity we’re asking for!! This freaking country could have afforded to do what other countries have done; give us MONTHLY checks!
1336117154094194688 2020-12-08 09:15:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Lock up DeSantis! He does not have the right to silence anyone w/ #desantisgestapo tactics! We are NOT in Russia! We cannot allow this to happen anywhere in America!!! Take this seriously America. As soon as Trump is gone, his #CorruptGOP will be the ones violating our rights!!!!
1336115057541963783 2020-12-08 09:07:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 Probably because @pfizer CEO refused to pay trump under the table. Trump decided not to do business with them. But we are the ones who are screwed. Exactly how trump ran his “businesses”!
1336113960848924675 2020-12-08 09:02:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @glennkirschner2 @YouTube GOP Senate will find any excuse to NOT confirm most of Biden’s nominees to any position. I worry about how he can get around that. If we take the Senate, we must ram Dem agenda thru ruthlessly, mercilessly &amp; unapologetically non-stop!! We cannot forget how GOP have treated us!😡
1336112219881402373 2020-12-08 08:55:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DWUhlfelderLaw @GeoRebekah Even though she’s a strong lady, she &amp; her family are in danger. DeSantis’ gestapo tactics should not go unpunished. He must be stopped.

1336008907626598414 2020-12-08 02:05:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Chezstacey @memmy1516 Thanks for the info. My son &amp; daughter just took rapid tests which came back negative. So are you saying they then test them samples again &amp; they can come back with different results?
1336008338245554177 2020-12-08 02:03:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Rhinocerization @JoeBiden @CatherineRicha6 And because he’s white. They won’t treat him as bad as President Obama. Still, they will hate Biden for having a WOC as VP &amp; for the diverse cabinet he’s appointing. They won’t confirm most. You’ll see. Then what?
1336007541977997315 2020-12-08 01:59:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FreckledGirl6 It’s because of Barr. He’s protecting them all.

Who’s going to prosecute Biden for using his presidential powers? You can’t indict sitting presidents. GOP are relying on democrats being meek, weak &amp; subservient. That has to stop. They need to fear us &amp; to see WE THE PEOPLE will have Biden’s back.
1336006245048872961 2020-12-08 01:54:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Rhinocerization @JoeBiden @CatherineRicha6 There are too few non-corrupt non-trumpers GOP in congress. We cannot rely on them. If Moscow Mitch stays in, NOTHING will get done for another 4 years.
1336005850561998848 2020-12-08 01:53:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Todd_Michael_ @EagleGuardian2 @JoeBiden @CatherineRicha6 He should fire him anyway. This is how we have to play. If there is no LAW which prevents President Biden from firing DeJoy, he should do it. To hell with traditions, protocols, memos or rules. We will never get anywhere if he doesn’t use ALL his presidential powers. EO’s too.

1335995691370500108 2020-12-08 01:12:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why they are reckless &amp; don’t care if they get it &amp; spread it. They know we the people will pay for the BEST treatment for them exclusively.
1335965497175715841 2020-12-07 23:12:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> It better not be aired on tv @CNN @MSNBC
1335964456145334273 2020-12-07 23:08:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mhdksafa Exactly. We support the entire government but they don’t call that socialism. Socialism is when we the people ask for some of OUR money back to help us.

1335958342225850368 2020-12-07 22:44:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LawyerJudkins He won’t. He’s getting every treatment available which the rest of us do NOT get. If Americans think GOP/trump are not getting special treatment, you don’t know this government &amp; how it kills ppl because we do not matter. The irony is WE PAY for all their treatments!
1335957804952248321 2020-12-07 22:42:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> These ppl should NOT get hospital beds nor #COVID19 treatment. They think God will save them, so they should stay home &amp; pray when they get the virus. These are selfish, irresponsible ppl who are putting OUR lives at risk. We have a right to protect ourselves &amp; our families.
1335953409577455620 2020-12-07 22:24:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @dukewindsor388 My brother in law is NOT getting the same #COVID19 treatment that Giuliani, trump, Carson, Christie got. He’s been in ICU for 33 days &amp; STILL has COVID. Not much info on what treatment he’s getting; he’s only 56 years old.
1335952525535666178 2020-12-07 22:21:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RudyGiuliani Yes. I’m sure you’re getting the great care that the rest of us do NOT get &amp; on our dime most likely.

Thx to Trump’s failure to warn us &amp; lead nation, he stole it from us! We are a large tight-knit family. Trump ruined Mothers&amp;FathersDay/July 4th/Memorial &amp; Labor Days/milestone birthdays/Halloween/VACAS!
1335726759443095555 2020-12-07 07:24:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @funder @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Yes!!! #TrumpVirus because you are all #TrumpVirusSuperSpreaders #RacistInChief I wonder how many Chinese ppl voted for you?
1335726318328156160 2020-12-07 07:22:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Giuliani has exposed 100’s of your #MAGAts to #TrumpVirus bc he’s a #TrumpVirusSuperSpreader They will get it/some will die bc you won’t give them “special” #COVID19 treatment. You are guilty of #CrimesAgainstHumanity &amp; you will pay a price. God is watching you. #RacistInChief

1335723329429368834 2020-12-07 07:10:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This could’ve been us in America TODAY!!! Instead we got #TrumpVirusSuperSpreaders &amp; his personal lawyer is in the hospital w/ #COVID19 &amp; who knows how many he infected. But all is well in America bc rich white ppl/politicians can get great treatment on OUR dime; only we die!!

1335718704928186372 2020-12-07 06:52:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BonzillaG @EricG1247 My kids are mad bc I told them their college degrees would get them better-paying job than mine (no college). Not so. They have high interest 10-year student loans which are paid $300-$400/month. I still help them w/whatever I can which means they’ll have to pay for my funeral.😡
1335717449375813634 2020-12-07 06:47:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BluelaFan @EricG1247 My husband was blue color &amp; I work a govt job. Both pay well. Enough to own a home/raise 2 kids&amp;1 dog/own a decent, not new, car &amp; travel a little. My kids had everything I never had; they’re hardworking responsible adults but I could not pay for their college educations up front
1335716345690853376 2020-12-07 06:42:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @cjpoboy @KidsAreGreat1 @EricG1247 I’ve worked 45 years straight. I am entitled to have all the necessities &amp; whatever luxuries I can afford. Much of technology is no longer a luxury such as internet/cell phones/laptops. We use them for work &amp; school. I’ve always driven a used car BUT have a right to buy a new one
1335712350666715141 2020-12-07 06:26:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @VGanMisanthrope @davidmweissman Ugh!!!! No!!! That means we cannot use public bathrooms.
1335712049490485248 2020-12-07 06:25:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Areli_RLE Exactly.
1335711514951606273 2020-12-07 06:23:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PamKeithFL Neither do I care.
1335711302904328201 2020-12-07 06:22:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I think trump did not have #COVID19 It was a scam!!!
1335711071919890432 2020-12-07 06:21:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 53 people who work in &amp; around the White House &amp; Trump have tested positive for #COVID19 It’s a Petri dish!!! Needs to be disinfected &amp; sterilized along with being exorcised of all the demons who defiled it!!! These are some arrogant MOFOS!!!
1335710490652237824 2020-12-07 06:19:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MavrocksGirl Sending you lots of prayers.
1335709482622586881 2020-12-07 06:15:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @4a_of Damn right. #IReallyDontCareDoYou #ItIsWhatItIs These MOFOS think they’re invincible because they’re white. But when they get #COVID19 they also know they will get the BEST treatment which WE THE PEOPLE will NEVER get!!
1335708916248940544 2020-12-07 06:13:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ScottyResister Followed. Happens too me ALL the time due to my ratio that I follow back almost all my new followers after I vet them.
1335708534802178048 2020-12-07 06:11:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @memmy1516 So you took a second test or the first test came back negative then positive?

1335706331194535937 2020-12-07 06:03:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> She may have saved her own life. She won’t get the same aggressive #COVID19 treatment which Rudy will now get!!!!
1335705882852798464 2020-12-07 06:01:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 3/3 same #COVID19 SPECIAL treatment as rich/connected white ppl? Will my BIL who is ONLY 56 survive? Can’t get straight answers as to his Covid treatment/has ventilator &amp; feeding tube! Can’t understand why he still tests positive! Don’t think he’s getting trump’s treatment! WHY?!
1335705879744802816 2020-12-07 06:01:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 2/3 Christie(58)/Giuliani(76!)/Tillis(60)/Gohmert(67)/Rick Scott(68)/Ron Johnson(65)/Bill Cassidy(63)/Grassley(87!)/Carson(69) are ALL old &amp;/or overweight. Trump allowed Carson to get treatment but Herman Cain(75) may not have gotten the same &amp; DIED! Are Brown/Black ppl getting
1335705877077250050 2020-12-07 06:01:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 1/3 So #RudyGiuliani has #COVID19 If he survives it, that means these rich white people are getting SPECIAL COVID treatment which is NOT available to the rest of us!!! Why has my 56 yr old BIL been in ICU w/COVID for 33 DAYS &amp; they have STILL not cured him?! Trump(age 74!) ...

1335682179171577859 2020-12-07 04:27:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MomRobe You should not have to treat MAGAts. I know your hearts &amp; ethics won’t allow you to refuse to treat them, but those people should be put in the back of the line.
1335681507306975232 2020-12-07 04:24:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @joyce_oler @lindyli Healthcare workers should not have to treat people who are irresponsible &amp; negligent SPECIFICALLY those who refuse to wear masks &amp; social distance.
1335680920561528833 2020-12-07 04:22:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @UniquelyDee10 @EricG1247 We need to elect more people like us. We should NOT have millionaires in Congress.
1335680726394691585 2020-12-07 04:21:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BonzillaG @EricG1247 This should not be our current scenario. Our parents (mine were immigrants) worked hard to give us a good life &amp; leave us something to move us up &amp; we have worked hard to give our now adult kids an even better life. This is not happening. Trump finished destroying me.
1335680050574876674 2020-12-07 04:18:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @melvan1104 @EricG1247 Doesn’t that confirm that the middle class are being destroyed by this government SPECIFICALLY by the GOP? Thought it was temporary struggling but this is a permanent path that we are on.
1335679547178700808 2020-12-07 04:16:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JZlotnick @PamKeithFL That was terrible how they treated that desperate girl who had no self-esteem.

My immigrant mother achieved American Dream &amp; owned 4 homes for decades. I used to own modest vacation home until I became single parent. My college-educated kids cannot buy homes until student loans are paid off!!
1335678089465106434 2020-12-07 04:10:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Tanyamilne7 @heretobeattrump @EricG1247 We need to stop this. We need to show our countries that the middle class/working class ARE the economy. We do the work which makes the rich richer; we pay massive taxes which pay for our govt agencies/politicians. We need to bring our countries to their knees w/nationwide strike

1335621133299802112 2020-12-07 00:24:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes he should. His worst crime is #CrimesAgainstHumanity due to his policies at border; his encouragement of open racism resulting in killing of POC by his MAGA cops &amp; killing of school kids/Jews/Blacks by his domestic terrorist shooters; his refusal to protect us from #COVID19!!
1335619215009701889 2020-12-07 00:16:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BreVes58 I’m so very very sorry for the loss of your precious son. No words can take away your pain but know that I can feel your pain. You are not alone. May your son Rest In Peace &amp; may you find peace &amp; strength. 🙏🏽💔😢

1335466502716334080 2020-12-06 14:10:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This could’ve been AMERICA - the supposed “richest country in the world” could’ve afforded to support its PEOPLE (with our own tax dollars) for 6 months to stop the spread. We should stop saying we are the richest bc we are not. We only support the rich 1%!! It’s shameful!

1335457620736565248 2020-12-06 13:34:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Exactly!!!! All bills passed by the House MUST be voted on in the Senate whether they pass it or not!!! If not, @SpeakerPelosi the House must CLOSE all the purse strings &amp; shut it ALL down!!!

1335338799501545477 2020-12-06 05:42:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @steffiehome @AOC So you’re saying if u earn $20,000 while working part time to pay for college &amp; your 1-year tuition is $8,000 (which u would’ve paid in taxes), then u get to use that to pay for college? That still means taxpayers will pay for tuition. Decades ago, city/state college was free.

Meanwhile, GOP will have gotten what they want - millions for corporations/CEOs again &amp; workers/customers will NOT be able to sue employers/businesses which expose them to COVID due to their negligence.

They should sign waivers!

With that income, we could’ve locked down for 6 months thru September &amp; America would’ve curved #COVID19 spread significantly &amp; we could’ve reopened rationally in October. Instead, 1,000 ppl PER DAY are dying!! America is #1 in cases/deaths!
1335046761631584256 2020-12-05 10:22:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mattgaetz You should be arrested for interfering w/ #COVID19 policies/mandates of @PhilMurphyNJ Spreading virus on purpose should be deemed a criminal act!!

If GOP thinks Trump will be stumping for them for re-elections when he’s out If office, he won’t do it for free &amp; they’ll be mini-Trump racist rallies.

1333571579947737088 2020-12-01 08:40:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Sarah_Yael_Gold We have many people in our family who grew up celebrating both. With decorations, customs, food. The kids all grew up fine whether Jewish or Christian. They still practice their Jewish faith. I think it’s nice to do that. It teaches kids that we are all human beings.

Pay attention #MAGA #MAGAts it’s people of color/immigrants/other religions who will be saving your lives when you get #COVID19 Meanwhile you’re jeopardizing them &amp; the rest of us by not wearing masks. Many of you WILL pay a price for your ignorance &amp; racism.
1333520946255302656 2020-12-01 05:19:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tnicholsmd This sounds about right. DIVERSE medical teams which include IMMIGRANTS is treating these #MAGANazis to save their lives!! If they survive, they will continue to be racists/terrorists &amp; believe they’re now invincible bc they think they are forever immune. YOU CAN GET IT AGAIN!!!

1333223421245788160 2020-11-30 09:36:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes PACK YOUR BAGS!!! YOU CAN’T SUE TO STAY IN OUR WHITE HOUSE. YOU’RE A LOSER &amp; TRAITOR &amp; A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY.
1333222861411069959 2020-11-30 09:34:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes YOU LOST FAIR &amp; SQUARE!!! You are the most UN-AMERICAN man on earth. You have disparaged everything sacred in America.
1333221996394655744 2020-11-30 09:31:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He’s right!!! Vote @ossoff @ReverendWarnock #Georgia
1333219927206064128 2020-11-30 09:22:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JimTaggartBFC @Davidlaz If they’re so religious, having that strong faith they claim to have should help them fight all temptations.
1333219612176117760 2020-11-30 09:21:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindaLala94 I will say it over &amp; over &amp; over again!!! I’m on a mission to make sure they remember why we elected them &amp; what it us we demand. They work for us, not fir them GOP. We need intelligent &amp; honest Dems but they MUST be TOUGH! I like @JohnFetterman We need more like him &amp; @AOC
1333218619849846784 2020-11-30 09:17:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @josephttavano Love this!!

1333214895010181120 2020-11-30 09:02:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JimTaggartBFC @Davidlaz I wonder if they’re hiding their fancy cars? I met young priest who became part of our family for a couple of years when my mom in law died in 2001. He eventually said he liked nice cars &amp; wished he could get one. Don’t think he liked vows of poverty much. I was surprised.
1333206792243908609 2020-11-30 08:30:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Davidlaz Religious fanatics are freaks. The rest of us who are just believers of God don’t worship human beings or religious leaders.
1333205194595856388 2020-11-30 08:24:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TiffanyNoth Couple of new back-up thermoses, 2 carafes &amp; my large coffee pot which I use when we have parties. 😂😂
1333204640419229697 2020-11-30 08:22:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JennaEllisEsq So do I, especially because my ancestors were here FIRST thousands of years ago before our land was stolen. Ask anyone in LAS AMERICAS about the history. I also love Central AMERICA &amp; South AMERICA.
1333203006247084034 2020-11-30 08:15:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeBiden NOT ONE SINGLE REPUBLICAN IN YOUR NEW ADMINISTRATION SIR. NOT ONE. Remember that WE THE PEOPLE worked hard &amp; risked our lives to elect you. Trump did NOT hire one single democrat in his admin. Do not cater to or bow down to GOP. They have LITERALLY killed/abused us in many ways.
1333201548067926018 2020-11-30 08:09:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @craving_filled Are you crazy?!?!
1333201496217882631 2020-11-30 08:09:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @nixw20 No. The ones in my family are horrified &amp; work out from what they see &amp; they despise Trump. He has NOT made their lives any better.
1333181213335580672 2020-11-30 06:49:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenatorLoeffler OMG!!!! You’re all such religious hypocrites!!!! Rubio already preaches on Twitter. Do something original. #SeparationOfChurchAndState is a must!!! Don’t shove your religious beliefs down our throats!!! Not everyone is a Christian in America!!

1333179769911988225 2020-11-30 06:43:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KellyO I will never ever understand why anyone voted for the #FascistInChief #RacistInChief Trump has attacked doctors/nurses saying they get more $ for reporting #COVID19, Intel agencies like FBI saying they’re corrupt, now @USPS union workers who work hard to get us our mail?! WTF
1333175842344722440 2020-11-30 06:27:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jakejsullivan @ananavarro Ironic that Cuban-Americans worship trump who has his brown shirts shoot pellets at/tear gas peaceful protestors at WH which WE THE PEOPLE own; encourages GOP to suppress our POC votes by any means including using our USPS. Cuban regime is same as trump regime-corrupt &amp; fascist!!
1333174075942985733 2020-11-30 06:20:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!!!!
1333173988005130243 2020-11-30 06:20:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Goss30Goss @nixw20 They’re afraid they won’t get online contributions so they need to pass the collection plates in person.
1333151778997760000 2020-11-30 04:52:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> WHY ARE THESE INCOMPETENT CORRUPT PEOPLE STILL TRAVELING INTERNATIONALLY ON OUR DIME?!?! What illicit deals are they making?!?!
1333151390777155587 2020-11-30 04:50:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Don’t forget genocide by #COVID19 is ok too.
1333151228705042432 2020-11-30 04:49:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AdrianaCohen16 @realDonaldTrump 3/4 are Russian BOTS who could not vote no matter how much trump cheated.
1333150958155653124 2020-11-30 04:48:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RepJayapal @SonyaSamuels Especially in AMERICA!
1333107905441255426 2020-11-30 01:57:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ShawnInArizona Trump cheated in 2016 with Putin’s help. We were blindsided.
1333107708233457671 2020-11-30 01:57:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Smilan317 😂😂😂😂

1333106044646662150 2020-11-30 01:50:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> WHERE IS THE PROOF?!?!
1333086462540189698 2020-11-30 00:32:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ColorMeRetired @d1Vinman @Just_ReneaR I accumulated my followers over the past 4 years. I started with under 50 followers because I hardly used twitter &amp; it was just my family following me. The young ppl in my family used it to vent about non-political things. Then it got political here. 😃
1333085694047236103 2020-11-30 00:29:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheWriteJennyG Yes.
1333084766518861825 2020-11-30 00:25:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> The FBI does not investigate based on their “views”!
1333083564016021505 2020-11-30 00:21:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So Trump thinks Black people voted more for him?! 😂😂😂😂 Nope!!
1333082714703015941 2020-11-30 00:17:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @toddstarnes Obama did not run for president so we POC gave our votes to the next best person who is @JoeBiden who served as his Vice President. He also chose a WOMAN OF COLOR as VP! She matters! Do you really believe most of us would vote for #RacistInChief? Only our sellouts voted for trump
1333081758397587464 2020-11-30 00:13:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dragonfy03 @mdnij34 Ted Cruz was born in Canada. He’s a naturalized citizen. I thought you had to be born in America to run for president but he ran in 2016.
1333077354990735362 2020-11-29 23:56:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @sirbeercan1 I will NOT be going back to Florida.
1333076804630962177 2020-11-29 23:54:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SunniRoe And all that humidity! Ugh.
1333076696669564930 2020-11-29 23:53:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @gabriauron I feel bad for you. One of my very best friends had to move there after she &amp; hubby retired because he insisted on it. They are lifelong New Yorkers. She’s miserable down there. She’s a beautiful &amp; tough Latina&amp; she has experienced racism from the Latinos there.

1333071456318742530 2020-11-29 23:32:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @sageu13 @PAPG1968 Then don’t vote for republicans. They are white supremacists.
1333071024150163457 2020-11-29 23:31:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Official_tylerg @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Wow!!! You’re an excellent artist. I hope you have a great future ahead. Don’t ever let anyone silence you. Your voice matters even if you stutter. You can work on that!! I followed you! God bless you.
1333069872503418885 2020-11-29 23:26:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LisaRacer2 @hs_professor Done.
1333067828572925960 2020-11-29 23:18:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @VickyisGrateful SUPPOSEDLY there are campaign funds laws which strictly enforce how you use those funds but you know, trump breaks laws &amp; doesn’t pay the consequences. Pence used his senate campaign funds to pay his mortgage which is a crime. Nothing happened. Different laws for different folks.
1333066147223248898 2020-11-29 23:11:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AmyAThatcher Doesn’t change a thing. You’re a human being. 😍
1333060800794275843 2020-11-29 22:50:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricTrump Is this as good as Trump University?
1333060631713427457 2020-11-29 22:49:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @prayerfeathers @EricTrump In order to be successful at selling things like wine, someone in the family should be a wine connoisseur. It must taste as bad as Ivanka’s clothing line looks because she’s no “designer”!
1333059384268697609 2020-11-29 22:44:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricTrump Begging for money?!?! My entire massive family has bought thousands of different brands of wine for the past 50 years but NEVER Trump champagne!! Have never seen it in stores; liquor stores or wineries. Must be watered down crap.
1332931504041816064 2020-11-29 14:16:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> FDT, GOP &amp; all his MAGAts!
1332930905334280192 2020-11-29 14:14:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WSJ Big deal!!! How many billions did Amazon CEO Bezos make off of their sweat which he paid no taxes on?!?! WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ECONOMY!! America’s minimum wage nationwide should be $20 per hour!!! Enough of this 1% capitalism, killing the middle class &amp; creating endless poverty!!
1332928284066279425 2020-11-29 14:04:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #LGBTQ LOVE IS LOVE!
1332920588214489090 2020-11-29 13:33:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Trump can’t answer 1 single question on the citizenship test which millions of immigrants have to pass.
1332919956615393282 2020-11-29 13:30:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Amen!!!!
1332918158005514240 2020-11-29 13:23:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DWUhlfelderLaw So I can’t take my HARD EARNED/DESERVED annual vacations out of this country after working 45 YEARS non-stop &amp; raising 2 kids bc thanks to trump we are banned from the rest of the world/walled in, but Floridians can keep celebrating mask less to kill us while we’re hostage here?!
1332912253553799173 2020-11-29 13:00:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why I will NEVER visit Florida again even after all this is over!!! Way too many idiots live/move down there.
1332907366598258689 2020-11-29 12:40:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Lot of science deniers out there taking unnecessary risks with their own lives. I wonder if we have a tally of how many of the 272,254 dead people were science-denying #MAGAts ?! Would any of these fools at this celebration tell us if they/their families got it &amp; died?
1332906223239360514 2020-11-29 12:36:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @glennkirschner2 So happy for you. Great show. 👏🏼

Democrats voted by the millions so it didn’t matter how much gerrymandering,voter suppression, purging of voters &amp; DeJoy not delivering 300,000 mostly Democrat votes. GOD WAS ON OUR SIDE bc good always beats evil!! Jail for u.

1332832074601009158 2020-11-29 07:41:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @oregoncoastgal It’s all over. They used to hide it well. Trump made it perfectly fine to spew racist rhetoric. They seem so proud of themselves/try to out-do each other. GOP tweet that Abrams registered 850,000 Dems/POC! How dare a Black woman register POC to vote!! Their outrage is real! 🤬

1332830177076916224 2020-11-29 07:34:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ChatNoirSalem @KimSwink @toddstarnes So you’re saying they each ILLEGALLY filled out all 3? Are they republicans? Not one democrat I know got more than one. We also know it’s ILLEGAL to vote 3 times so no way would Dems risk having their votes invalidated.
1332829324303601665 2020-11-29 07:30:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Left_in_Limbo @dukewindsor388 He WILL care about it after he’s out of office bc then they will be worth something to him. He can earn a good income from giving away our national secrets. New AG should strip trump of security clearance. Let trump sue &amp; drag it out in the courts; Dems need to ignore subpoenas!
1332827376376541184 2020-11-29 07:23:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow Who is going to allow him to use a venue for free?! Trump’s “events” after 1/20/21 should be labeled “super spreader events” &amp; “terrorist events”. ALL should be fined/events shut down!! Cities/states should not allow trump to break laws/mandates when he’s no longer POTUS!

If anyone complains enough about a judge being biased, they are censured &amp; sometimes removed. They are supposed to interpret, reassert &amp; follow the LAW &amp; decide accordingly, not decide with what’s in their hearts &amp; minds/their beliefs.

1332722760766861314 2020-11-29 00:27:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @toddstarnes GOP cheated but were overwhelmed by millions of mail in ballots they could not sabotage. DeJoy did manage to NOT DELIVER 300,000 ballots. Where are they? Bet they’re 90% for Biden. He STILL won popular vote by 6 MILLION! 😂 306 to 232 EC!!

1332462014569062400 2020-11-28 07:11:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ossoff It’s bc govt is run by GOP! They could’ve provided 6 months of monthly cash to all families to stay home for 6 months from March-August w/conditions to follow precautions. We would’ve been in a better place financially &amp; infection-wise by now. WE ARE THE ECONOMY not stock market!

Many ppl experience incontinence issues related to real medical/mental problems or age which they cannot control. Trump brought this on himself so I don’t care if he’s made fun of. He made fun of disabled reporter. Fxck him.

1332057093977886723 2020-11-27 04:22:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Same here. Thank you all!!!
1332040691619409920 2020-11-27 03:17:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor FINE ALL RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS BREAKING YOUR MANDATES! They have NO right to spread #COVID19 to the rest of us. God is everywhere; we don’t need to congregate in mere buildings. All about $. We have the right to get hospital beds/treatment ahead of them.
1332039848883073024 2020-11-27 03:13:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Scotus Those ppl should not have the right to take anyone else’s place in a hospital/ICU bed who is doing the right thing to protect family, friends by wearing masks/social distancing. Alcoholics are not given liver transplants; ppl who spread #COVID19 should not be given hospital beds.
1332038601639682051 2020-11-27 03:08:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Scotus So #SCOTUS will kill us? Time to #Add4SCOTUS
1332038319421657091 2020-11-27 03:07:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BradMossEsq Sounds selfish. I don’t think God wants us killing each other. God is everywhere-don’t need to congregate in a building to believe in/pray to God. Sign waivers so u won’t take someone else’s place in ICU. Alcoholics can’t get liver transplants so u shouldn’t get treatment in ICU.

1331820217194979329 2020-11-26 12:40:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Of course we won’t. Only #PresidentBiden will see to it we all get treated equally.
1331819830362648578 2020-11-26 12:39:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> No one should be allowed to break our NYC #COVID19 mandates. You’d think religious people would care about protecting the lives of their neighbors. This is shameful. We have all sacrificed a lot. No one is special.

They did not expect that &amp; were not prepared. No way trump legitimately had 8 million more votes after so much chaos &amp; death! He rigged it but he STILL lost.

Our election was tampered with-they were just overwhelmed by the millions more Dems who came out to vote for Biden &amp; they could not keep up w/sabotaging all our votes esp. mail-ins. How could trump get 8 million more votes after what he’s done/not done? Weird!
1331630380571615232 2020-11-26 00:06:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ChrisCuomo @TinaMarie_80s ALL OR NOTHING. No more crumbs &amp; huge concessions to GOP like waiving your right to sue employers or businesses if we get #COVID19 due to their negligence &amp; refusal to follow guidelines; or giving millions to corporations!

GOP Senate will not work w/Biden no matter how much everyone thinks they will. We need @ossoff @ReverendWarnock to win in GA.

My kids fit &amp; they embrace both of their heritages/cultures. Many racists don’t like us, but we really don’t care.

As a Mexican-American, doesn’t it bother you Trump said you’re all criminals? Doesn’t it bother you to see brown babies kidnapped from their parents &amp; thrown in cages? It hurts me!

However, he’ll pay his kids exorbitant “campaign consultation” fees &amp; they’ll give him kickbacks. Pence used his campaign funds to pay his mortgage but nothing happened. #WhitePrivilege

When you live among racists who are members of KKK &amp; the like, racism is part of their culture &amp; ingrained in hearts &amp; it’s taught to the kids. Racism is taught. Some break away. Some embrace that culture.

1331306322890010626 2020-11-25 02:38:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Kossilar @TalbertSwan I stand corrected. It’s in their culture. White privilege means thinking they are not only superior in every way, that they can enslave, harm &amp; kill people of color to do the hard work they won’t do, to keep us down or to eliminate us.

1331290289147932674 2020-11-25 01:35:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Trump is doing a 1-minute presser  right now BRAGGING about stock market passing 30,000!!Meanwhile thousands of Americans are dying daily. It was a hit &amp; run. No questions taken. He thinks he’ll win if the stock market is up. WE ARE THE ECONOMY not the stock market. What a POS!!

Even if Trump is ordered to pay her attorney’s fees, he won’t pay &amp; they know it. She’s not getting anything of whatever he has left.

Trump will fight her for years in court to make sure she doesn’t get 1 penny of whatever is left. If she files for divorce, it won’t be bc she thinks he’s a bad man, it will be bc she doesn’t want him grabbing her by the pxssy anymore. She’s bad!
1331285324639690753 2020-11-25 01:15:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TalbertSwan Yes. Agree. Even if they won’t admit it. At the very least, they’re in a frenzy because white Americans won’t be the majority soon. Are they afraid we will do to them what they’ve done to us? We don’t have that cruelty in our DNA.

1331074068372709377 2020-11-24 11:16:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> My message to ALL current @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Looks like the silent ones have been crawling out of the woodwork saying it’s time to move on. Our mission is NOT complete. You will ALL be voted out as fast as we can including those who were silent. Message from #RBG  https://t.co/9OOdLXplbP
1331073024439803904 2020-11-24 11:11:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Irene_X_Adler @RepPaulMitchell Exactly. I’m going to steal this &amp; retweet.
1331072845443686400 2020-11-24 11:11:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Smilan317 We had them all over NYC. We have less now. What I miss is the @JackBox we had in NYC! It’s been gone since the late 80’s. So I stuff my face with their tacos when we go to Vegas. 😂
1331071967181594625 2020-11-24 11:07:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JillAddington6 @SquirrelWOWW @YourDadLikedIt The people I know retested 3 to 5 weeks later &amp; came back negative. The entire nation should’ve locked down for 3 to 4 months &amp; we’d be much better off now.
1331070939069558784 2020-11-24 11:03:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Kokomothegreat Omg!!!!

Let him have his own separate chapter in the history books documenting the harm this authoritarian monster did to our democracy &amp; listing names of all Americans dead from #COVID19 &amp; POC killed by MAGA cops, mass shooters, ICE/CBP/DHS!

You want to enrich yourself like your colleagues. YOUR SILENCE MADE YOU COMPLICIT with the trump regime. #Louisiana needs to vote you OUT!

You’re trying to school intelligent people while you stand there lying &amp; asserting that trump won?! Do you think lay people don’t know the answer?! Maybe we should ask real lawyers like @glennkirschner2 @tribelaw @SallyQYates ?!
1331059820309385225 2020-11-24 10:19:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LeslieGoreJr @blue_mitchell22 ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! Comey is USELESS!!!
1331059574984601600 2020-11-24 10:18:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RepPaulMitchell Here come GOP claiming they were loyal to America. Never heard ur name which means u were SILENT. Silence is being complicit. U are another rich white guy worth 37 MILLION DOLLARS! Was it inherited, earned or insider trading? We need WORKING ppl in CONGRESS who work for US!!
1331052777125122048 2020-11-24 09:51:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KatWebheart Whatever it is he intends to do will be fine with me because I know it will save us. I’m sure he will have a rational plan.

1331048821736890370 2020-11-24 09:35:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SquirrelWOWW @YourDadLikedIt The reason why she can’t test before then is, if she’s still positive, her quarantine starts all over again. We have strict contact tracing here. So she’s in quarantine &amp; will test again soon.
1331043147934261249 2020-11-24 09:13:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump PACK YOUR BAGS LOSER!!!! You will be held accountable for your #CrimesAgainstHumanity &amp; many other crimes you’ve committed.

1330963578967502855 2020-11-24 03:56:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @YourDadLikedIt Quarantine, monitor your oxygen &amp; temperature regularly, keep an eye on your symptoms (hope they’re mild), test in 14 days &amp; monitor your health after you’re negative. You can get it again, so continue testing yourself.

1330932717349974016 2020-11-24 01:54:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeBorelliNYC Yet you still have a 4% positivity rate in your RED boro!! You’ve brazenly tweeted that you’re having a big Thanksgiving dinner w/relatives from NJ which has 7.66% positivity rate. Your hospitals are full. Our @NYGovCuomo has to open an #EmergencyFieldHospital bc you deny science
1330931649148821505 2020-11-24 01:50:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeBorelliNYC Hey Joe, are u still prepping for ur big Thanksgiving gathering &amp; having ppl from NJ (7.6 positivity rate) over? Ur boro has almost 4.0% positivity rate. Have u told ur #statenisland constituents that @NYGovCuomo has to open an #EmergencyCOVIDHospital in ur RED GOP boro yet?

1330848656707170305 2020-11-23 20:20:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @murray_nyc @carlbernstein He has also interviewed w/Trump &amp; voted for Trump’s policies &amp; judges &amp; he voted to impeach trump only bc he knew they already had enough votes. He probably voted for Trump again in 2020 election. God forbid he should vote for an actually moral man who goes to church on Sundays.

1330375190698725376 2020-11-22 12:58:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thatalicewu Now I wish my family &amp; I were living in Taiwan. Must be nice to live freely without disease &amp; not have to worry about your family dying. #TrumpVirusDeathToll252K
1330373820407042050 2020-11-22 12:53:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thatalicewu I just want to know who pays for the quarantine, meals &amp; medical care if needed?
1330373654958518273 2020-11-22 12:52:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is amazing.
1330373318671732739 2020-11-22 12:51:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Wow!!!
1330373203869437953 2020-11-22 12:51:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thatalicewu This is also done in Grenada. If you’re a local you cannot go home if others live there, so you have to quarantine for 14 days at your own expense in designated hotels. They have very few cases &amp; people can live in peace on that beautiful island.
1330365097533976577 2020-11-22 12:18:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KwikWarren Wow. Weird story. Weird people out there.
1330364942638264321 2020-11-22 12:18:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ZackPohl She would NEVER do that.
1330364727390859265 2020-11-22 12:17:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MarilynAuriemma Please get well soon. 🙏🏽
1330361395850977281 2020-11-22 12:04:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NWPinPDX She will lie to keep campaigning. Setting up to say it was a false positive. Don’t put it past her. They don’t care if they get it &amp; spread it. She still gets her salary which we pay &amp; if she needs medical treatment, we will pay for that too. Talk about socialism for the wealthy.

1330357992282333185 2020-11-22 11:50:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KLoeffler @Mike_Pence @Perduesenate Heard you got the virus. Wonder if Pence will carry it back to White House? You can get it more than once you know. It doesn’t only kill Black &amp; Brown ppl. Also has long-term consequences. 1 family member was hospitalized last night w/abdominal infection. She had it in Sept. SMH
1330356901075415047 2020-11-22 11:46:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DrEricDing Of course they don’t listen to experts. They’re hoping it will spread to &amp; kill only POC.

He has an underlying condition so they were nit able to treat him for Covid right away. But he’s not eating so he has a feeding tube now. His 1/2 sister (we have a huge extended family) was hospitalized last night w/a stomach infection. She had COVID in September.

It’s not like he’s making corrupt deals to enrich himself or betray!!! We’re not going to tolerate media attacking @JoeBiden when they gave trump a million passes!! STOP IT!!

1330313056719675392 2020-11-22 08:52:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump It’s funny that as we check the replies on your recent tweets, there are no MAGAts nor Russian bots here defending &amp; worshipping you. Of course, we all know that about 2/3 of your followers are fake accounts/bots Putin set up for you. I think he threw in the towel, so should you!

There’s a huge movement to MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN but it NEVER was!!

1330280549534011397 2020-11-22 06:42:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We have not had a president for 4 years. Trump is a useless idiot, a traitor &amp; corrupt man. Bet he talks to Putin, Erdogan, MBS regularly &amp; writes love letters to KJU. Xi is too smart to talk to dumb trump. But Pompeo is traveling the world on our dime making promises to leaders.

1330199571088236546 2020-11-22 01:21:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> In “richest” nation, we not only support our govt w/our fed taxes, we make rich richer by working for low wages &amp; then we have to donate money to political campaigns &amp; to feed/clothe/shelter the poor while living paycheck to paycheck &amp; our kids burdened w/massive student loans!!!

Basically this racist is very very very angry that “un-patriotic” Black people actually voted - millions by paper ballots THEY could not sabotage/change although #DeJoy did a great job of not delivering 300,00 on time.

I’m not thanking any of them as they slowly creep out to say something now. They’re trying to save their seats but not for their paychecks which are petty cash to them.

Daddy can’t pardon state crimes. You’re NOT above the law. You’re all criminals &amp; murderers. Justice shall prevail. You shall see.

I felt this way👇🏼4 years ago too &amp; NOTHING #TraitorTrump has said or done has made me do a 180! So many of you (Graham, Rubio, Cruz) have done 180’s.

1329642951404818432 2020-11-20 12:29:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Good thread/rant. Sometimes I feel like that but other times I get scared because I’m not an expert in laws &amp; politics. I’ve learned a lot  but I now also know our laws are flawed/weak, judges can be biased, politicians can be bribed-blackmailed &amp; our govt is as corrupt as others

If they all come out tomorrow &amp; tell trump he lost &amp; stop him from committing more crimes, it still will not fix all the harm they’ve done nor erase their crimes. This is not a game show Mooch. GOP has screwed us! We will NEVER forget!!!

Trump &amp; his Klan have spread racism &amp; are literally killing us! Nothing that MOFO or his minions do is going to get them “wiped”! Stop w/the games please. Most of us are living in an emotional &amp; financial hell!!!

1329558462490140673 2020-11-20 06:53:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!!
1329558404159959047 2020-11-20 06:53:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @1Realnatalee @NYGovCuomo Trump is now trying to destroy us. Cuomo won’t play nice with him anymore &amp; I’m good with that.
1329558087112531970 2020-11-20 06:52:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AdamSerwer And God forbid that the votes of American POC should be counted!!!

1329555409401769984 2020-11-20 06:41:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @rimarthag @JeffreyGuterman @bponsot Means he did not shower after he dyed it, unless it’s a spray on. In that case, he should sue for a faulty product. Either way, he looks like he smells really bad.
1329554649121239043 2020-11-20 06:38:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @steph_zee @Scaramucci You are right. GOP have embraced their racism &amp; are thrilled to be able to show it without consequences. They don’t want to give up that feeling they get when they’re openly racist. It must be an incredible high for them. It’s like trying to take away raw red meat from a lion.

1329520530064633860 2020-11-20 04:22:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> More blatant corruption. Election interference by trump.
1329515480676257806 2020-11-20 04:02:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is NOT photoshopped!!! It’s on video!! It was live. This country is being run by corrupt GOP lunatics!!!!
1329514368237785090 2020-11-20 03:58:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Basically he said that the votes of democrats, especially people of color, should not be counted because he says so; that any city which is majority Democrat is corrupt for voting for Biden. He wants to invalidate legal votes just bc they were not for trump.
1329512475000270850 2020-11-20 03:50:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DineshDSouza @RudyGiuliani Giuliani look great with sweat &amp; hair dye dripping down his face. He’s not only mentally ill, he’s physically ill. Trump is down to the bottom of the barrel. No real attorney will continue with this farce. TRUMP LOST BY OVER 5 MILLION LEGITIMATE VOTES! Our votes count too!!
1329511910413373440 2020-11-20 03:48:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This disgusting man is not fit to practice law. You cannot go to court with unsubstantiated accusations &amp; conspiracy theories. He needs to have over 5 MILLION testify. He’s the one who’s telling #DumbDonald he can change the numbers by the millions to prove trump won!! #TrumpLost
1329511287357902848 2020-11-20 03:46:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @aravosis This is a great tweet.
1329510144691081217 2020-11-20 03:41:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Election fraud!!! He’s going to threaten, blackmail or bribe people. We need to watch this carefully.
1329509850632609797 2020-11-20 03:40:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Many will die.
1329509748643942404 2020-11-20 03:39:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> It’s not a stretch. ALL states are suffering bc RED states outnumber us &amp; those MAGAts are spreading the virus. I’ve heard of many ppl from GOP Governor states traveling to our BLUE states where we follow our great DEM governors’ mask mandates. Heard no one wears masks in KY. 🤬
1329508823414022148 2020-11-20 03:36:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Ugh!!! This insane &amp; incompetent fool is what Trump is down to handling his legal matter. 🤢🤮 He looks like he’s sick!!! Does he think we don’t notice the sweat &amp; hair dye dripping down?!?!
1329508360773832704 2020-11-20 03:34:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JRubinBlogger No. We need to get rid of those crooks.
1329499082998640640 2020-11-20 02:57:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @fatedfire @WileESongdog @IsaacDovere I owned land for 3 years before I built on it. I had a deed &amp; mortgage on it. It was mine &amp; no one could build on it. It was marked off. We also had a mailbox down the block with the rest of the houses on the block. Upon building, was asked if it would be a primary residence.
1329498280179462145 2020-11-20 02:54:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheTrueEnrique Strong possibility.

My brother in law is in ICU with COVID for 14 days now. They’re vague as to what treatment he’s receiving, if any. Doctors/nurses are overwhelmed due to irresponsible ppl.
1329487459416219649 2020-11-20 02:11:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @fatedfire @WileESongdog @IsaacDovere Ok. But he still owns the land which has an address. Also, where is he really living during construction?
1329484630299451398 2020-11-20 02:00:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mlm1051 Noticed that!!!! No one should travel with their spouses on “official business” on our dime. They should pay separate air fare &amp; hotel accommodations.
1329479471079055362 2020-11-20 01:39:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acyn Wow!!! Great legal scholar.
1329479268812853255 2020-11-20 01:38:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We can thank trump &amp; GOP for destroying Americans. Meanwhile, they &amp; 1% (includes many in Congress) are doing just fine!! #CapitalismKillsTheMiddleClass #CapitalismKillsThePoor WE ARE THE ECONOMY!!! This is now a banana republic.
1329478499833405441 2020-11-20 01:35:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes. It is absolutely disgusting that “richest nation in the world” cannot support it’s individual citizens thru this pandemic which trump made worse. GOP is great at bailing out 1% rich &amp; corporations but we all just have to go broke, get sick &amp; die! Other nations do it!! WTH!🤬
1329477701846052866 2020-11-20 01:32:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Why is Pompeo traveling all over the world on our dime?! There is absolutely nothing he should be doing!!!
1329459120043339780 2020-11-20 00:18:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DavidAlanMack @GottaSaveBucky Is it true Trump called them?
1329458858725609473 2020-11-20 00:17:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davidfrum @iambrig With no fake protocols, memos, rules, laws to tie their hands like in the Mueller investigation. It was an immense waste of taxpayer money.
1329457986021036033 2020-11-20 00:14:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Disgusting!!! 🤢🤮

1329454964687646721 2020-11-20 00:02:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Dumb questions:  Isn’t election tampering a crime?! Can Democrats do the same thing &amp; get away with this crime?!
1329454304294539264 2020-11-19 23:59:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Millions upon millions of Americans really don’t like Republicans. You will discover that at all the polls from now on. We’re coming for you. We will no longer allow GOP to suppress or sabotage our votes. We have mobilized &amp; organized.
1329452420792016898 2020-11-19 23:52:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So true!!! Your family member cannot get ANY visitors at all. They will be all alone like my brother in law who has been in ICU with #COVID19 for 14 days. They will die alone too.

1329323802929614848 2020-11-19 15:21:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He’s very busy tweeting &amp; destroying democracy &amp; killing Americans. He’s afraid to go to Florida because he thinks we’ll change the locks &amp; knows Florida is a Petri dish of #COVID19 Then again, so is the White House.

1329304735879475202 2020-11-19 14:05:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Carisma015 @ImJohnEli That’s why we are at 3%.

1329303665853812737 2020-11-19 14:01:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thebr0keb0i Neither will I.

1329302952029401089 2020-11-19 13:58:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @andyinTOONT That would be nice. Looks like he’ll stay in office forever. Republicans seem to think so at least.
1329302704116658177 2020-11-19 13:57:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @johnpavlovitz GOP think that trump will be very successful when he’s gone. That he will have a lot of influence on millions. That they have to continue to worship him so he can help them stay in office. They don’t know he’s the kiss of death.
1329302282396164097 2020-11-19 13:55:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> That’s right. #NoJusticeNoUnity
1329302074673270784 2020-11-19 13:54:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenateGOP So you’re going to let trump keep killing us? There are at least 10 relatives for each of 250,000 dead who loved them. That’s 2.5 MILLION ppl who will NEVER vote for GOP. There are millions more YOUNG ppl who will turn 18 &amp; NEVER vote GOP either. We will NEVER forget!!

1329300095448313858 2020-11-19 13:46:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Please read this thread. It is horrifying what Trump, Pence and ALL GOP have done to us. They are literally killing Americans by the hundreds of thousands. I want out of this craziness &amp; abuse!!!

1329217302089371654 2020-11-19 08:17:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @carriecordero Thank u for your honest “observations”. I have NO PITY for anyone who has not spoken out/left trump admin. If separation of families/caging babies/Trump’s mass shooters &amp; tiki-torch MAGAts murdering ppl/trump virus killing over 250,000 ppl didn’t affect them, they’re cowards.
1329213642827554818 2020-11-19 08:03:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @charliekirk11 Guess you all want to join the #TrumpVirusDeathToll252K
1329200245754966023 2020-11-19 07:10:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thebr0keb0i Not good friends.
1329200184522379264 2020-11-19 07:09:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tonyschwartz I agree w/you in all seriousness. I cannot believe that America is allowing trump to violate our Constitution, emotionally abuse &amp; literally KILL hundreds of thousands of human beings in America. Americans have been TRAPPED in an abusive relationship with POTUS for 4 LONG YEARS!!
1329199148642553858 2020-11-19 07:05:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ReverendWarnock Thank you reverend. It is a very difficult decision to make &amp; it’s something women live with the rest of their lives. So most do not make that choice without deep thought first.
1329164574411649024 2020-11-19 04:48:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenSchumer NOT 1 PENNY LESS THAN WHAT @SpeakerPelosi ASKED FOR!!! We will NOT take anymore CRUMBS from GOP!!!!
1329164297856028672 2020-11-19 04:47:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mdnij34 I would do that &amp; give up not seeing my kids (my 2 loves) for 6 months so that they won’t have to bury me or me bury them. Happy to give up 1 year to live another healthy, happy 20 more years. I would be nothing without my son &amp; daughter. I live for them &amp; to protect them.
1329159846378287105 2020-11-19 04:29:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mdnij34 Yes!!! Can I just have a bit of jelly though?

1329158595997552644 2020-11-19 04:24:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas To tweet you are part of #TheResistance That you are a brother/sister resister. That’s how I started on Twitter. The resistance is us. 😍

1329156457108004864 2020-11-19 04:16:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOP It’s ok to attack a Black man’s religion &amp; preaching I see. But when your GOP yell on stage, scream in tongues &amp; wave their hands &amp; roll their eyes like they are possessed, that’s religion right? Got it!!
1329155978940608520 2020-11-19 04:14:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MollyJongFast @brokenarrow828 Those science-denying fools should be thrown into a #COVID19 contaminated hospital room where someone just died &amp; locked in there fir a few days. Then send them home without testing them.

1329154941269766145 2020-11-19 04:10:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JamesLindholm1 No. The fight is just beginning. We have to win GA’s 2 Senate seats; fire GOP &amp; stay on top of our democrats &amp; Biden &amp; Harris to make sure they are doing what we  elected them to do. We busted our behinds off by donating time &amp; money &amp; risking our lives to vote. #VoteBlue always!

1329152875713482753 2020-11-19 04:01:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> For those of you who are mad @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi for not lowering their stimulus amount so @SenateGOP &amp; trump will give us something, please remebget if we don’t raye the Senate @JoeBiden will NOT be allowed to give us more! So it’s ALL or nothing NOW!   Win GA Senate!

Do you want to live w/your parents until then? I know ppl w/post grad degrees who don’t earn enough.

If he thinks God will save him or that he won’t die because only Black/Brown people die, let’s see what happens. If he survives, it will NOT change him in any way.
1329124595581005830 2020-11-19 02:09:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dknight10k He likes to waste OTHER people’s money.
1329124474881503232 2020-11-19 02:09:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ImJohnEli Yes, but if the workers don’t say anything, it’s likely it’s a MAGA store. Thank God masks are REQUIRED in all stores, restaurants etc in my blue city. You CANNOT remove your masks inside any businesses.
1329111140765413376 2020-11-19 01:16:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BlueResistExist If it’s approved by REAL scientists.
1329109200157478915 2020-11-19 01:08:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MonsterVetArt Yes. Quite a few. It’s a huge burden &amp; having a college degree no longer means getting high-paying jobs. Many blue collar UNION workers I know earn more.

My mom was a tough cookie &amp; made dad take it off bc she said she too worked &amp; paid bills &amp; she didn’t have 2 kids to deny them things. She grew up poor. He showed me bills; I was considerate.

1328536085685743616 2020-11-17 11:11:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I’ve been saying that for days!! The ONLY federal election fraud committed in the last couple of elections has been by @GOP because they are #CorruptGOP New AG will have a lot of ppl to investigate &amp; in prison along w/FBI &amp; state AGs.
1328534487555317762 2020-11-17 11:04:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ericsslater @LindseyGrahamSC Why is it white GOP men can commit all kinds of crimes &amp; not be charged?! Can someone please tell me? We had 1 female democrat who resigned in shame because she had a consensual threesome with adults!! That is not a crime!!!
1328533840957202433 2020-11-17 11:02:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ericsslater @LindseyGrahamSC But he won’t.
1328533661118062594 2020-11-17 11:01:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PreAnnoyed @hortkie So sorry. Sadly, this will happen many times now. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
1328533540011700225 2020-11-17 11:00:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DanielleAmes10 Happy birthday!!! NYC!!!
1328533410546130946 2020-11-17 11:00:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LisaHagan7 Election tampering!
1328530861571108869 2020-11-17 10:50:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> No doubt!!!
1328530302336167937 2020-11-17 10:48:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @libfemnerd I could only afford to buy 45’s but I finally bought Donna Summers’ first album.
1328529693885292545 2020-11-17 10:45:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kaitlancollins So trump is leaving LESS troops there which will leave them vulnerable &amp; weak!!! What is the freaking purpose of this?! What is the strategy?! So DOD without Esper is now doing trump’s bidding?! Guess there aren’t many patriots there to push back.
1328528827488874496 2020-11-17 10:42:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 💔💔💔💔
1328528774825172992 2020-11-17 10:41:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnnmarieMar @AllTransLivesM1 Yes!!!
1328528362353160192 2020-11-17 10:40:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AllTransLivesM1 You are right. Don’t fall for it.
1328528231646044161 2020-11-17 10:39:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ericswalwell Because she’s doing what Trump wants. That was the plan all along.
1328528017954574336 2020-11-17 10:38:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ananavarro Is Trump sending his domestic terrorists out every weekend, to our Democrat cities, to riot &amp; harm/kill us?
1328527643235508231 2020-11-17 10:37:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CHueyBurns It’s called GOP corruption business.
1328527478508417030 2020-11-17 10:36:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LisaHagan7 Yes. If this govt can bail out corporations &amp; farmers, they can help the rest of us get thru this pandemic. We are the economy. We pay the taxes (except rich ppl) which support this government. It’s our turn to get the aid we need right NOW! We are here bc #TrumpLiedPeopleDied
1328523822883106817 2020-11-17 10:22:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SheilaABaker @cryborg 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

1328522703121379329 2020-11-17 10:17:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Scaramucci @LindseyGrahamSC Stop being corrupt Mooch?! Never happen. He will do ANYTHING, legal or illegal, to save trump.
1328522510581821440 2020-11-17 10:17:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TimEdwardsZero4 Hell no!!! To hell with that tradition. It’s not a law!! We don’t have to abide by it!!!
1328522316775612417 2020-11-17 10:16:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PeggyTh55 Oh no. How do you think you got it? 🙏🏽🙏🏽
1328520439572860929 2020-11-17 10:08:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Zac_Petkanas Definitely in Kentucky &amp; his own state of South Carolina.
1328520247297662976 2020-11-17 10:08:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davidmweissman @tedcruz He’s one the the worst.
1328520066175012864 2020-11-17 10:07:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KatieHill4CA Many middle class live paycheck to paycheck. That’s what the last 30 years has done to us. We cannot afford to pay for our kids college, so they get loans which we help them pay back or they live w/us to pay it back. I had to help BOTH my kids. I’m a single mom working 44 years!!
1328519134355845121 2020-11-17 10:03:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeBiden Yes. And another way to help the middle class dig out of the ditch GOP &amp; Trump have put us in is to clear a path for a better future for our young people by #StudentLoanForgiveness We, nit the poor, live paycheck to paycheck. You know that. THIS IS WHY YOU GOT THE YOUNG VOTE. ❤️
1328518110949875713 2020-11-17 09:59:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jim_Jordan Not true. The 15 cases went to 5 and then 0. It’s been over since Easter. You can do all of that &amp; do not wear a mask Gym. You have the #WhitePrivilege to do anything you want. Enjoy!!!
1328517693184552961 2020-11-17 09:57:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jim_Jordan Remember when you got off on watching wrestlers being molested?
1328517428616327170 2020-11-17 09:56:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @maddow

1328516458389843971 2020-11-17 09:53:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes.
1328516418137108486 2020-11-17 09:52:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tracilaw @LindseyGrahamSC And Kentucky too.
1328516283562926080 2020-11-17 09:52:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin He needs to resign. He is corrupt &amp; we know it.
1328515852816297984 2020-11-17 09:50:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin Yes!!!! It will help the middle class especially young people 22-32 years old. They are burdened by these massive loans &amp; jobs don’t pay enough in America &amp; they have to live with or rely on their parents.
1328514738523951106 2020-11-17 09:46:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump No. No. No. This is a lie and your daddy ruined our economy &amp; has added TRILLIONS in national debt!!! #TrumpVirusDeathToll250K Shut up!!! PACK YOUR BAGS!!!  #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpLost
1328513800149094402 2020-11-17 09:42:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin Barr &amp; Pompeo too!!
1328513534255386630 2020-11-17 09:41:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> If this was a Democrat, he’d resign right now. This is pure corruption but Trump has made us numb to this!!! #LindseyGrahamMustResign
1328472443187572737 2020-11-17 06:58:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #GeorgiaMakeUsProud
1328468755840724992 2020-11-17 06:43:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why #SouthCarolina &amp; #Kentucky Elections need to be investigated. If Graham &amp; McConnell had allies in their states, you can bet those 2 elections were rigged.
1328468336703893508 2020-11-17 06:41:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnthonyJSisk 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1328468060798398467 2020-11-17 06:40:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> If trump does NOT pay up front, don’t do it #Wisconsin !!!

1328467365936422912 2020-11-17 06:37:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Not surprised.
1328467075724173315 2020-11-17 06:36:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TraceyC20373474 No!!! 😂😂

1328452483371442177 2020-11-17 05:38:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DeanBrowningPA You mean the tax breaks for the rich &amp; a few feet of racist wall he put up? OMG!! Biden will reunite kids in cages, perfect healthcare, relieve students of massive student, save environment, fix broken economy &amp; save millions from dying from #Covid19!! How dare he!! 😂 #ShutUpMan
1328450980749455363 2020-11-17 05:32:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @essenviews At least 1/3.
1328450925111996418 2020-11-17 05:32:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jeverage713 Oh my!! Yes!!! What triggered it? If she has twitter, ask her to check  out @davidmweissman twitter feed for helpful insight. She’s not alone. What changed her mind?
1328450445564645381 2020-11-17 05:30:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NlessBrainStorm @SenWarren If Warren is on top of this, she will know that the loan forgiveness CANNOT be a bad mark on anyone’s credit. We need to keep reminding them all not to do it half-assed though.
1328449812480602112 2020-11-17 05:28:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MarnaDua4 @RoArquette So I’ve been told. #FauxFoxNews had put a banner on their screen a few days ago.

1328449196383473664 2020-11-17 05:25:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @4_the_babies @RoArquette So it was #FauxFoxNews of course. 😂
1328449015776735233 2020-11-17 05:25:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Rigel9000 @Birkeyinchitown @mdnij34 Right.
1328443551085195264 2020-11-17 05:03:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!! #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #TrumpVirusDeathToll250K
1328443048200704007 2020-11-17 05:01:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mdnij34 Yes for a while until the numbers are down.
1328442963505057793 2020-11-17 05:00:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @liberalgoddess Yes. My skin crawled. These are religious fanatics who let their own children die ...
1328442722743627778 2020-11-17 05:00:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RoArquette Heard Soros now owns a majority stake. Keeping an eye on the traitors until Biden forms Crimes Commission?! 😂
1328442434813112326 2020-11-17 04:58:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!!
1328432826014965761 2020-11-17 04:20:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AUkeibro @DeterminedVoice @AOC Yes!
1328432586985713666 2020-11-17 04:19:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DebbiePetaccio I think we can do both as long as the rich start paying taxes. Most of the food being given to the hungry comes from donations by regular people like us, not the government. If the rich pay taxes, government will have more to help ppl get back on their feet.

1328430942780858369 2020-11-17 04:13:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DeterminedVoice @AUkeibro @AOC My culinary grad nephew co-owns a restaurant but it took 10 years to get there. Several technical school grads in my family are earning high salaries now but it took a couple of years &amp; they are STILL paying off $30,000-60,000 in loans which quadruple (or more) in 10 years.
1328430101151817728 2020-11-17 04:09:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DeterminedVoice @AOC Some ppl had no choice but to get student loans for college education. Not everyone gets scholarships, some parents can’t afford to pay exorbitant prices cash &amp; even if students work, part time jobs do not pay enough to pay for college. Middle class &amp; their kids have been screwed
1328429380880789509 2020-11-17 04:07:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SharisseC I salute you for your service Sharisse!! ❤️
1328429210017402882 2020-11-17 04:06:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DeterminedVoice @AUkeibro @AOC Right.
1328429144263290882 2020-11-17 04:06:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DebbiePetaccio We can multi task. I’m sure they will deal with Covid &amp; related problems first.
1328428567559086083 2020-11-17 04:03:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Const_Overhaul Not surprised. Pedophiles love to work with children.

1328422282029633538 2020-11-17 03:38:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davenewworld_2 Great idea!!! BUT then Biden needs to FIRE them from his cabinet within 90 days &amp; put in a democrat. I do NOT want ANY GOP in Trump’s cabinet, White House staff or federal agencies running anything! Trump did not appoint any Dems or POC except GOP Carson/sellouts.
1328421165036089346 2020-11-17 03:34:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Connie_Pisces11 NEVER!!!! Sometimes ppl cheat without actually having sex w/someone; emotional cheating (flirting, texting, emailing, exchanging pictures/videos, phone calls etc) are just as bad. If you love someone &amp; there are issues, you should discuss them to try to resolve them b4 you cheat.

1328372462460014593 2020-11-17 00:20:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @domacoblue @Scaramucci Exactly!!! They may still save themselves if they let us proceed with prosecuting all the Trumps &amp; traitors IF they look the other way. Are they not interested in having only the “best people” in their party? Looks more like they will embrace QAnon though Mooch!
1328371211932487685 2020-11-17 00:15:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Scaramucci And we will then stamp out your @GOP!! Wanna know why? Because we will never forget their greed &amp; racism which kills the middle class &amp; has killed PEOPLE!! Not to mention their love of Putin. Young people are mobilized &amp; huge political changes for the better are coming. Finally!!
1328368872290996226 2020-11-17 00:06:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bridgetsimonds0 It was rigged.

1328367904346300417 2020-11-17 00:02:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ReallyAmerican1 DONATED what I could just now. I know every little bit helps! Thanks for all you do.
1328367090932338689 2020-11-16 23:59:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ReallyAmerican1 Question: Will you also be able to provide free rides for those who want to drop off their ballots in person at legitimate boxes from 12/14 to 1/5/21 assuming ballots can be dropped off early? I WILL DONATE ANYWAY but please reply. Resisters, please donate if you can. ❤️
1328366250704121857 2020-11-16 23:56:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #GeorgiaMakeUsProud There is no excuse not to vote. Early voting starting 12/14 &amp; free rides! Please request absentee ballots now &amp; do NOT mail them in. Drop your ballistic off at a legitimate place. Check your board of elections for all info. @ReverendWarnock @ossoff must win!

1328363805156511744 2020-11-16 23:46:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @aravosis That’s how you defend yourself against MAGAts!!!
1328363489086332928 2020-11-16 23:45:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @aravosis What do you expect? They also defended #KyleRittenhouseIsATerrorist !
1328362262768316417 2020-11-16 23:40:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mtgreenee Will you actually do any work or will you be tweeting your entire term?
1328362070174261249 2020-11-16 23:39:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mtgreenee Yeah. We Democrats would like to be able to freely arm ourselves in all 50 states to protect ourselves. Or will it apply only to Republicans?
1328360950181863425 2020-11-16 23:35:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @good_stirring @OleVetUSAF It’s terrifying.
1328360448727650312 2020-11-16 23:33:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @leftcoastbabe @TimTebow @JoeBiden Biden has true faith. It’s what makes him a compassionate &amp; kind human being. Tebow is not a true Christian. He sees what zealots are doing &amp; thinks that’s the way God wants it. I can’t believe our God wants us to commit genocide &amp; to murder each other. Are mass shooters saints?
1328359498294173704 2020-11-16 23:29:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TimTebow So it’s ok to commit genocide? Why are we born in the first place then? What makes you think Christian beliefs are the only way for us to live? You know, this world does not have ONLY Christians. You people do not respect the beliefs of others.
1328356321633198085 2020-11-16 23:16:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Did you know that our children pay for our sins?
1328356180050243585 2020-11-16 23:16:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump You just confirmed that Daddy knew about #COVID19 in January &amp; did NOTHING to prevent 250,000 deaths of Americans. Also, this clarifies that @pfizer did not partner w/daddy &amp; that you all must have Moderna stocks. Daddy LOST!! PACK YOUR BAGS! @JoeBiden will fix this mess!!
1328353871161421826 2020-11-16 23:06:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FinchelsteinF @washingtonpost This is why I cannot understand why Latinos in America do not see how dangerous Trump’s behavior &amp; policies are.
1328353549080727554 2020-11-16 23:05:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We need to keep an eye on them, the Kochs &amp; the Federalist Society.

1328349005231906816 2020-11-16 22:47:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Yeah religious white women love pxssy grabbers, adulterers &amp; sexual assaulters. They also love racists who kill brown babies &amp; unarmed Black people. They want to make America white again but it never was.

They &amp; their parents will be thrilled. Why didn’t millions get angry when the 1% got a tax break &amp; paid no taxes. You have to start somewhere to save the middle class.
1328342595190317056 2020-11-16 22:22:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Trump_Detester You should boycott us OR come visit just SOLID BLUE STATES like NY, CA, WA, OR, etc. Do NOT visit Florida. It is one of the worst states. Most southern states too.
1328340970874826756 2020-11-16 22:15:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Goal__Diggah Low. Maybe you can find a studio for that price but not an updated one.

1328227166350401542 2020-11-16 14:43:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Healthcare workers need to go on a mass strike. Many are negligently infecting people. We’re all going to get it because of them. Let the trump administration figure out how to staff hospitals. Maybe Ben Carson or Atlas or Birx can go take care of some #COVID19patients.

You worship the devil so going into church means nothing. God knows what we all have inside our hearts whether we go to church or not.
1328165844422156289 2020-11-16 10:39:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> OMG! Keep voting in lunatics like these &amp; they will be tweeting propaganda &amp; BS instead of working for the ppl!! None of the DEMS need to go to church every Sunday for me to know they have good beliefs. This is anti-Semitic bc Jews worship on Saturdays. We are NOT all Christians!

Guess what, my niece appreciates sacrifices of her immigrant grandparents &amp; parents &amp; is proud of her heritage!

When I was there for Women’s March in January 2017, that entire street was wall to wall protestors. No vehicles could drive down the streets all over that area. 😂

1327676695508381696 2020-11-15 02:16:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Buckadero @RZwigard @SteveOnSpeed We are a state with an international airport in NYC &amp; a domestic airport a few miles from JFK. Hundreds of thousands of ppl travel thru NYC. Trump administration knew in January &amp; didn’t tell us for 2 months. Trump killed everyone. It’s ALL on him.

A real patriotic intelligent American president would’ve taken charge back in January when he knew &amp; we’d have saved most of those lives &amp; not had 10 million cases. We have 4% of world’s pop. yet we have 5 times cases &amp; deaths. It’s incomprehensible &amp; Trump is a criminal!!

1327471240957865985 2020-11-14 12:39:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas It is because democrats have shame &amp; can quickly admit to making mistakes &amp; correct them. But I bet GOP had a mask less dinner packed in like sardines celebrating new QAnon &amp; racist members.

1327362899371814915 2020-11-14 05:29:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Donald Trump had nothing to do with the Pfizer vaccine. Pass it on.

I’m sure GOP will CRAM together without masks &amp; w/some already w/COVID to spread the virus. The sad thing is that we had to cancel our huge annual Thanksgiving gatherings.

1326994889008181252 2020-11-13 05:06:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @stevenmazie They can all gather by the thousands if they want just keep them inside churches or their homes all the time!!! The rest of us have a RIGHT TO LIVE &amp; PROTECT OUR LIVES &amp; LIVES OF THOSE AROUND US! Diocese should PAY for medical treatment if they end up in hospital w/ #COVID19
1326993984858824709 2020-11-13 05:03:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BobC7000 @johnpavlovitz Yes!!!
1326993917217296389 2020-11-13 05:02:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @johnpavlovitz @cryborg Because GOP love their domestic terrorists more than democracy.

1326993143900889093 2020-11-13 04:59:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BlueVotr They do not take precautions. You are putting YOUR family in jeopardy. We had 148,000 nationwide cases in 1 day. My large family/extended family who are VERY cautious have now been infected (3 of them). It’s only getting worse.
1326992595491434496 2020-11-13 04:57:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BlueVotr 3 of 6 members of my family who live in same household have tested POSITIVE for #Covid19 in last 48 hours. 1 is in ICU!! They follow all precautions but live in a MAGAt-filled town in NY where MAGAts refuse to wear masks at supermarkets, stores, schools (picking up kids) etc!🤬

1326972277393657863 2020-11-13 03:36:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Just found out 1 more member of the family tested positive. They all take precautions, most work from home &amp; they all test regularly. Smfh

Es un pendejo.

There is no 1 “American culture” here.

They ended up getting angry &amp; stopped talking to me bc they could not change me.

I feel bad for the ones who choose to remain in the closet for the wrong reason because they don’t know what it’s like to live normal, full, happy, open lives full of love.

A father w/morals would never like this tweet. Then again, he SAID he would date Ivanka if she wasn’t his daughter &amp; they had “sex” in common. Filthy!
1326725958733340675 2020-11-12 11:18:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mattgaetz Is she applying for a job in the “2nd trump administration”?! 😂 Trump won’t let her marry you, you’re too poor. Better learn to grift more.

1326719748944617472 2020-11-12 10:53:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GrassrootsSpeak There is a huge scandal behind the vote counts in Kentucky &amp; South Carolina. I feel it in my bones.
1326719321394061318 2020-11-12 10:51:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @palatofino @shaneharris This is what I just tweeted. 😃
1326718984289460225 2020-11-12 10:50:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @shaneharris Since T is entitled to SS for rest of his miserable life paid by us, we should be entitled to tapping all his phones, surveilling all his communications, keeping tabs on his whereabouts. He should be spied on until he’s caught. #TrumpIsNationalSecurityThreat He will sell secrets.

1326715748190986240 2020-11-12 10:37:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yes!!! We took back our YMCA, we took back our anthem, we took back our flag &amp; we took back OUR America!!! #BidenHarris2020
1326714255287181312 2020-11-12 10:31:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #InvestigateKentucky #InvestigateSouthCarolina Is there any way to arrange for all voters of both parties to be asked to submit their names &amp; confirm who they voted for so it can be checked against the votes tallied? Most would like to know their votes were counted properly.
1326712996786212865 2020-11-12 10:26:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheRickyDavila So do I. Florida has rigged its elections for at least a decade. The others have been gerrymandering, purging voters reducing voting places thereby suppressing voters especially in POC areas.
1326711661814816769 2020-11-12 10:21:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jennycohn1 @jmreycroft @gvelez17 Florida has been rigging ALL of your elections for at least 10 years. Good luck.

1326560723854614531 2020-11-12 00:21:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Rintl @Jillbiden46 You were getting a refund? Many of us didn’t get state tax refunds after #TrumpsTaxBreakForTheRich not to mention not federal tax refunds at all.
1326541079726882825 2020-11-11 23:03:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Americans need to realize @GOP doesn’t do a damn thing for WE THE PEOPLE. They just give tax breaks to rich &amp; appoint judges. Obama could not do much bc #MoscowMitch blocked him for 6 years!! Where is your healthcare? Tax break? $15 per hour? Affordable childcare? Free college?
1326434149473918976 2020-11-11 15:58:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @fake_biden Sorry to hear that. Life does go on after divorce.

1326428615177867266 2020-11-11 15:36:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CBSEveningNews But NY!! We were at 1% since June. Spiked to 3% in November because we too have MAGAts &amp; red state visitors.
1326427757841178625 2020-11-11 15:33:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mtgreenee No. We Dems finally realized we need to vote! We united. We organized. We voted. By the millions!! All LEGAL! We saw our democracy was in jeopardy. Get used to the numbers bc we are taking the 2 Georgia senate seats. Working, donating &amp; voting. That’s what we will continue to do!

People are saying he’ll form some kind of media group for his #MAGAts to follow him. He won’t. He’s just ripping them off now to take the money &amp; run!

We had gotten 1 Dem Rep in BUT he just lost to a GOP. They love trump. LOTS of ignorant racist MAGAts there. All of Staten Island should be quarantined &amp; locked down. I haven’t been there in 20 years. Just drive thru it to get to Jersey.
1326420080134135810 2020-11-11 15:02:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KristiNoem must be very proud of being Trump sycophant. Feel bad for 31% who voted for Biden. The rest got just what was coming! Made fun of NY! We’re at only 3.09% recently but had maintained 1% June to Oct! Downhill from here Gov Noem! Keep killing constituents. #PaperBallots

It will spread like wildfire. At least blue states have mask mandates &amp; sanitizing &amp; provide testing &amp; tracing.

1326412701304836103 2020-11-11 14:33:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnikoTHomas Altho we had abt 50 family, friends &amp; coworkers (4 died) get it March to August, Cuomo’s mask mandate has DEFINITELY helped. We ALL wear masks&amp;sanitize. We avoid large gatherings &amp; test regularly if we’ve been exposed. We’re not doing too bad considering we were epicenter.

As soon as he realized trump did not warn us early &amp; would not aid us, he followed science to stop the spread &amp; did what he had to do/saved thousands.

They love trump more than their family, even their children &amp; parents. Trump has not only torn brown families apart at border, he’s done it to Americans, me included. MAGAts cut us off.

Claims he’s not running for re-election nor for governor. We flipped PA &amp; it’s going to stay blue. Toomey will NEVER be elected as governor of PA. Don’t even think about it!!!

People who were working there &amp; smart enough to document crimes &amp; keep hard proof, need to speak out as of 1/21/21 &amp; bring receipts so we can prosecute.

NY, CA &amp; other blue states are tired of supporting these welfare states w/our federal tax dollars. Send us hardworking immigrants. We could do so much w/extra $ to make our states even better. Good riddance! KY too!

Trump is too much of a punk to do it himself directly, but he knows he has his domestic terrorists all around us waiting to do his bidding. We need to be alert. Thanks for your service Eric! ❤️

This is why we need new younger Dems in office who know how to fight &amp; not to trust ANY GOP ever.

Maybe ppl don’t care about brown kids being abused/raped/killed &amp; Black ppl being murdered by cops, but do they care even just a bit about 240,00 Americans DEAD?!

I remember thinking how can adults be so crazy as to kill their own children for a “leader”!!! I wasn’t even a mother when it happened. I knew then cults were dangerous &amp; full of lunatics brainwashed by psychopaths.

At our regular gatherings of 30 or so (before covid), the 2-3 trumpers would not dare say anything about trump around the rest of us. They know they are outnumbered; that we are right; that we have NO RESPECT whatsoever for MAGAts. Outcasts.

1325995530808397825 2020-11-10 10:55:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RandPaul Only the GOP families of DEAD GOP cashed those checks. Democrats mailed them back bc we are not crooks like you. Someone should investigate how many GOP cashed those checks. They’re as crooked as GOP guy who tried to vote for his dead mother. Opening can of worms w/this tweet.

1325991924071796738 2020-11-10 10:41:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I’ve been doing the same. #Georgians are being given plenty of time to get it together &amp; vote!!! Please vote @ossoff @ReverendWarnock PLEASE!!!!
1325991297983909888 2020-11-10 10:38:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @VoteMarsha Healing has NOTHING to do with you. It’s the good people who need to heal &amp; hold all you people accountable one way or another. Go away you despicable person. Coming for you in 2024. We will be experts at removing GOP from congress by then!! We will get more &amp; more powerful.

1325988988843339776 2020-11-10 10:29:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JYSexton And Graham acknowledged today that it is a “movement” (just didn’t admit it’s a fascist movement) &amp; that trump should run again in 2024. Can’t wait for these dinosaurs to start dropping like flies. They think they’re immortal.

1325978073083355136 2020-11-10 09:46:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Puprluvr @BrentTerhune It was the dinner of 1976. My summer job. Had to travel almost 2 hours going &amp; 2 hours coming by subway. Worked from 7 am to 4 pm. Thought I’d earn more money than babysitting or cleaning houses. I was so wrong. Of course that taught me to get better skills &amp; stay in school!

1325852518384082944 2020-11-10 01:27:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Twitter This is false information. @pfizer was not part of the trump’s warp speed. They are working on it on their own. They were given a less than 2 billion dollar contract to insure they can put it on the market. 👇🏼
1325851973183303683 2020-11-10 01:25:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @peterdaou Not good. Putin may have tried to rig it in trump’s favor but paper mail-in ballots were mailed in overwhelming numbers by Democrats &amp; Putin couldn’t sabotage those votes.
1325851134335004674 2020-11-10 01:21:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SteveSchmidtSES Without secret service protection. Let his militia protect him.
1325850825986600961 2020-11-10 01:20:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin Hope it’s true. Hope they thoroughly test it. They were NOT part of trump’s WARP SPEED so hopefully that means they were not under any pressure to work on vaccine &amp; that it was done under their own timeline with a medical not political agenda. Biden will make sure we ALL get it.
1325843573884022786 2020-11-10 00:51:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> No surprise. We are paying for his treatment so he won’t have a 1 million dollar debt nor lose his house. How nice.
1325842306302435334 2020-11-10 00:46:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> And the GOP/Russian vote tampering begins. Trump is distracting us while they do what they can to try to rig the election by changing votes. There is no way trump got 70 million votes. Who’s watching this?

Researching to try to make s vaccine. Trump lost the election!! Thank goodness or else he would just allow the vaccine to be given only to republicans.

1325699470823198725 2020-11-09 15:19:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SteveSchmidtSES Just read your thread!!! It is terrifying. I am scared. You always speak so knowingly &amp; honestly. When Biden is President he will have to do unprecedented things to save us &amp; all elected Dems, cabinet &amp; we the people must stand by him. 4 more SCOTUS added &amp; new laws is a must.

1325542014809673728 2020-11-09 04:53:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #Georgia #GeorgiaSenateRaces THERE IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO COME OUT TO VOTE BY THE MILLIONS!!! You have more than enough time to do it including EARLY voting starting 12/14!!! Please!! #LETSGETTOWORK
1325539511011598336 2020-11-09 04:43:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kriskay1111 I agree. However I feel the ones I know are just plain DUMB &amp; greedy. They thought trump would make them rich. They didn’t care they had to sell their morals &amp; be sellouts to their race. They didn’t care how many died from #COVID19 or racism.
1325538874781814790 2020-11-09 04:41:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We cannot let that happen again!!! She is right!!! She knows what she’s taking about!!!
1325538348161753091 2020-11-09 04:39:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Of course. It’s the usual #TrumpPropaganda &amp; 70 million people believe this!!!
1325538093613510657 2020-11-09 04:38:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> These people are insane!!! This is not Christianity. This is a wicked cult. If I gathered to pray &amp; my preacher laughed so maniacally, I’d run out as fast as I can. God does not teach this. #TaxReligiousOrganizations NOW!! They won’t laugh all the way to the bank then!!

1325537060892123140 2020-11-09 04:33:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FLOTUS The American people deserve a legitimate president not Putin’s puppet trump elected by rigged election. We also deserve a 1st Lady who didn’t get an illegal visa thru fraud &amp; has no brains whatsoever. Pack your bags. Don’t bother to decorate for “fucking” Christmas either! OUT!!!

1325525180198891520 2020-11-09 03:46:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @FLOTUS There are few illegal votes in USA! Millions of us voted him out! Are you mad bc Putin wasn’t able to hack millions of paper ballots? You are not a queen. Only illegal thing is your visa &amp; hence chain migrant parents. Pack your bags. Don’t even bother to decorate for Christmas!
1325524055139749888 2020-11-09 03:42:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Yeah. Enough of this nonsense!!! She’s a professional intelligent woman not a useless dummy like Melania!!!
1325514442235326466 2020-11-09 03:04:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> That’s exactly what we expect him to do!!!
1325514218716663810 2020-11-09 03:03:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SummerJ_Resists @johnpavlovitz Not if he can keep getting their money. But there will be no more racist rallies to feed them red meat. He won’t pay for them. Trump will just pocket the money. 😂😂
1325513619346501632 2020-11-09 03:00:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @govkristinoem needs to be on the list of next to go.

1325512325789601797 2020-11-09 02:55:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @megynkelly @GOP &amp; Trump’s MAGAts attacked us. We fought back &amp; will continue to rise up!!!
1325512032666476544 2020-11-09 02:54:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why we cannot embrace the @GOP They will stab us in the back any time we let our guard down
1325511378287943680 2020-11-09 02:51:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @florian_krammer @morgfair Sadly trump is still in charge.
1325511037148409862 2020-11-09 02:50:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> That will be symbolic.
1325510689570566146 2020-11-09 02:49:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @megynkelly You lost along with trump.
1325510601729249280 2020-11-09 02:48:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @megynkelly Written like a woman who thinks it’s ok to grab women by the pxssy!! You are irrelevant. Putin won’t be able to help your next GOP presidential candidate because karma got him!!

The reason why u will face many challenges specifically economic &amp; health-related is due to Trump’s massive corruption &amp; greed &amp; total incompetence &amp; failure to lead. But I know this admin  will be much better than Bush admin which ruined the economy.
1325507210047348736 2020-11-09 02:35:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tedcruz You are next on the list. Don’t get too cocky!! We will get you out!!!
1325507052869873664 2020-11-09 02:34:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> We cannot drop the ball ever again. We must get all of the current GOP out eventually.

1325505300980527104 2020-11-09 02:27:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why trump got so many votes. 👇🏼 Dumb people are easily brainwashed. We need better education in America. We are way behind many other countries academically. Many people are bilingual all over the world.

1325281830048845826 2020-11-08 11:39:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @_Jshaw4 @CharlieBarkin6 @EPhi120244 @Jim_Jordan So we are all criminals? Racists are very ignorant ppl who never leave their bubbles. Why are magats saying they’re moving to Mexico if they’re criminals. Don’t try making Mexico white. It belongs to Brown ppl &amp; so did more than 1/3 of USA. White ppl are serial rapists/murderers.
1325280682424283137 2020-11-08 11:35:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @_Jshaw4 @CharlieBarkin6 @EPhi120244 @Jim_Jordan Poor humble hard working ppl don’t always have an easy path to entry. That’s why they take extreme chances &amp; ask for asylum. Not all who come “illegally” are criminals. Ignorant ppl have chosen to believe a very ignorant/racist man! When u seek asylum they still check background.

1325068412897402881 2020-11-07 21:31:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Biden did NOT fill up rooms w/couple of thousand ppl like your daddy bc of #COVID19  We DEMS don’t need to cram our mask less selves like sardines to hear our candidate. We’ve worked hard to GET OUT THE VOTE! This is the result! We voted EARLY by mail &amp; in person to #FireTrump 😂
1325066594247188480 2020-11-07 21:24:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RealJamesWoods Democrats have never taken away your 2nd amendment. This is propaganda. This is also a threatening tweet.

What world have you been living in?! He kills Black ppl. He’s a racist. Used you for election. Hopefully none of your fans fell for it. We worked hard to VOTE HIS ASS OUT! 🤬🤬
1324958854153703424 2020-11-07 14:16:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @icecube Yeah. He was really going to do that. He played u. It was a scam right b4 Election Day to try to get Black votes. If u had really been paying attention, u’d have seen he doesn’t GAF about Blacks. #GeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter Never did he say it! We were going to VOTE HIM OUT!

I won’t have to pay more federal taxes to suooort the rich either.

We knew we had to get our votes in any way we could. Some voted early in person &amp; some voted by mail &amp; some went on Election Day. We could not take a chance that our votes would not be counted!!!
1324758655015751682 2020-11-07 01:00:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DoctorHenryCT I agree. The GOP will have to bow down to DEMS!!!

1324594335871094784 2020-11-06 14:07:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jonfavs @designmom @tedcruz Of course they’ve had poll watchers from both parties there. Most polls have them. Trump &amp; klan never mention that to MAGAts. If they were smart, they’d know this. Trump just wanted to send in corrupt high-profile poll watchers like Bondi.

1324588728535392256 2020-11-06 13:45:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @juliecmoroney Sorry you went through that. Serious question: were any votes discarded bc they were “sticky” or challenged by intimidating people or not a vote for trump?! Are poll workers SCARED into not counting votes properly? If so, this cannot be ignored or overlooked.
1324586966902542337 2020-11-06 13:38:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jim_Jordan Why is it election fraud case discovered was a GOP trying to vote for his dead mother? THERE IS NO ONE MORE CORRUPT THAN TRUMP, ALL GOP &amp; YOU!! We have not forgotten about Putin’s interference in our elections either!! I hope you get what’s coming to you.

1324584483962716162 2020-11-06 13:28:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GregAbbott_TX Was your state allowed to count millions of unexpected mail in ballots BEFORE Election Day? Are you saying people who count ballots must be supervised because they’re as corrupt as trump/GOP? Some states have live streaming where we can ALL see the count.
1324583543444484096 2020-11-06 13:25:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Finally huh? 😂😂😂😂 Let’s not forget QAnon nut lady.

1324583038873968642 2020-11-06 13:23:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Bethiebaby72 It really was a beautiful video. My favorite is John Lewis.
1324582558093422594 2020-11-06 13:21:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @eleanor_rigby49 It choked me up too.

1324581682800971776 2020-11-06 13:17:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Bethiebaby72 Yes!!
1324581109624168453 2020-11-06 13:15:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I will NOT leave. There is a lot more work to do. #TheResistance still has the GOP to resist. Also, we must make sure our democrats do what we demand.
1324580336844656640 2020-11-06 13:12:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IowaGOPer I don’t see a problem insulting those 68 million. Neither do the other 72 million who voted for Biden with me. Voting for an adulterer, rapist, racist, Putin-loving traitor because you like your 401Ks going up is no reason to brag. Democrat presidents always improve the economy.
1324579328231952386 2020-11-06 13:08:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DevinCow He’s been licking his lips a lot. Coke heads do that.

1324572339049291777 2020-11-06 12:40:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @nixw20 I know a handful. Don’t interact much anymore w/them. But they’re all acting as if trump losing is no big deal. After bragging for years about how great their 401ks were doing, they act as if them supporting trump was also no big deal!! Trump is a monster who kills people/kids!!

1324566091205615616 2020-11-06 12:15:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Just heard #SteveBannon has been permanently suspended from twitter because of his statement about pUtting Fauci &amp; FBI Wray’s heads on pikes!!
1324561818438742016 2020-11-06 11:58:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @emed8 @DonaldJTrumpJr I understood Junior to say it will be easier for him in a primary for president in 2024.

1324556822238404610 2020-11-06 11:38:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RockyMountViews We will continue to resist the GOP. Remember we don’t have the senate YET! We will have to work on those 2 run-offs in Georgia in January from now until then. If we get those 2, we are set!! Lots of VOTER SUPPRESSION in Georgia!
1324554506248609793 2020-11-06 11:29:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Aisha71129615 @MadamZolar You are right Aisha.
1324554123463827456 2020-11-06 11:28:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @crosado1968 @liberalgoddess Yes. Discrete, responsible &amp; most likely better shooters. I have many friends who carry discreetly. There will be a rude awakening for the magats.
1324551823701741568 2020-11-06 11:18:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Frank66Stanton @liberalgoddess @expobear1 That is surely needed in America. And strict gun control is a must too.
1324551626808565760 2020-11-06 11:18:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @crosado1968 @liberalgoddess And I bet those who carry in Texas are many democrats. I have friends there who carry &amp; they are NOT MAGAts.

1324544819251892224 2020-11-06 10:51:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #AbolishTheElectoralCollege It is long past time!!! EC is just another way to SUPPRESS the people’s votes &amp; we have been way too complacent!! We must do something about this way before the next election!!! Presidents should win by popular vote!! That is the voice of the people!!
1324543312410353664 2020-11-06 10:45:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JohnFeal1 CONGRATULATIONS!!! I love Spike Lee!!! All his projects are a success!!!
1324542942648958976 2020-11-06 10:43:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @VeronicaF198 No. We will continue to be #TheResistance against the GOP. We will have a lot more work to do. Have to get rid of more GOP. Have to make sure our elected Democrats are doing what WE THE PEOPLE will demand. No more weak &amp; meek democrats or we will replace them.
1324540868209086469 2020-11-06 10:35:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Politics_PR He’s down to having young pimple-faced interns standing behind him. What happened to his generals &amp; cabinet members?

1324534383785746433 2020-11-06 10:09:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @peterbakernyt The only thing trump likes &amp; accepts is everything &amp; anyone which favors him!!!

1324533075011883008 2020-11-06 10:04:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This guy is instigating violence. Threatened to start shooting. The FBI should knock on his door. I see Junior there doing the coke head lip movements. Next mass shooting in 3, 2, 1 ...
1324531168927227905 2020-11-06 09:56:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He surely did!!! Trump is not only a liar, he’s a sore loser.

1324516766194814979 2020-11-06 08:59:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TalbertSwan It’s also legal!!! Trump &amp; GOP are angry that they could not suppress ALL Black votes!!!
1324516117071757318 2020-11-06 08:57:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Trump helped us #DefundNYPD because their budget will have to be cut due to #COVID19 expenses which trump won’t reimburse us for!!!

1324514484065546241 2020-11-06 08:50:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @morningmika I too thank @MSNBC for not airing Trump’s crazed propaganda &amp; conspiracy-filled press conference. They have to let the lunatic out once in a while to spew trash to massage his ego!!!
1324513883411959811 2020-11-06 08:48:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump Yes. The truth will prevail &amp; all our LEGAL votes WILL be counted!!! Biden will win!!! Stop your BS!!!
1324513642486878215 2020-11-06 08:47:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Shut up man!!! Your president encouraged his #MAGAts to vote in person but Dems did NOT fall fall for that so we did MASSIVE early voting &amp; MASSIVE mail-in ballots to make sure we got our LEGAL votes IN!! He will lose because we the people have spoken LEGALLY! Pack your bags! 🇺🇸
1324494320783818753 2020-11-06 07:30:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acosta God is on OUR side. Trump is one of the worst human beings in earth. I hope we learned a HUGE lesson about racism &amp; greed. If we don’t have great orders, there will be chaos, death until the earth is destroyed by climate change.
1324487657594998786 2020-11-06 07:04:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 😂😂😂 They’re going off the deep end!!!
1324487452753645570 2020-11-06 07:03:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @charliekirk11 EVERY VOTE MUST BE COUNTED. Or we too can call Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania &amp; Georgia for #PresidentBiden How about that?
1324486993691234305 2020-11-06 07:01:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mmpadellan Enjoying envisioning that too. 😂😂😂

1324480808321720324 2020-11-06 06:36:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dknight10k Those are the GOP religious women who are submissive to the husbands. They’re used to the type of sexually, emotionally &amp; verbally abusive man that Trump is.

1324456019058167814 2020-11-06 04:58:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AndrewYang @MinnesotaMaryS If you’re talking about the ppl who voted for Trump again, they need to be made aware that racism will not be tolerated &amp; that all domestic terrorists will be severely punished. They need to get used to the idea that America is not white &amp; will NEVER be. We can’t give them power.
1324454787287556097 2020-11-06 04:53:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AndrewYang @MinnesotaMaryS They’re freaked out POC/women are taking over. Afraid of being minority (maybe they think we will do to them what they’ve done to minorities for 100’s of years). They are mostly ppl who want to make America white. Domestic terrorists must be severely punished to set an example!!
1324453472817827841 2020-11-06 04:48:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JuliBunting @Mes23161 Definitely Kentucky and Georgia machines cannot be trusted.

1324451927887912960 2020-11-06 04:42:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DoctorHenryCT @Smilan317 That is exactly what McConnell will do!!! Will block Biden on EVERYTHING he can. Dems must figure out a way around it. Also, Biden will have to govern by Executive Orders &amp; no one better criticize him! Dems must not negotiate w/GOP. @SpeakerPelosi CLOSE PURSE! GOP will obstruct!!

1324439318115614726 2020-11-06 03:51:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Anyone know how people who mailed in their ballots check to see if their vote was counted in Suffolk County (Long Island) New York? Please send me the link. Thanks!!!

1324438210173390848 2020-11-06 03:47:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> The United States had 103,087 NEW #COVID19 cases in 1 day on November 4th!!!
1324436398863208450 2020-11-06 03:40:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> She was flagged by twitter for fraudulent election statement!! 👇🏼😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1324436040527077376 2020-11-06 03:38:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> But if Trump was winning by a landslide, she would not call it election fraud!! Why is it so hard for #MAGA dummies to believe that we DEMOCRATS would actually plan to vote!! WE VOTED LEGALLY IN MASSIVE NUMBERS TO BEAT TRUMP!
1324434272124653569 2020-11-06 03:31:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acosta Signing vengeful &amp; evil executive orders?
1324434146354204673 2020-11-06 03:31:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> She should be mass reported to twitter for sending out trump propaganda regarding our election.
1324433493351374849 2020-11-06 03:28:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Twitter trump is using his White House account &amp; press secretary account to send out typed messages which would otherwise be flagged by you for election misinformation.

Of course, all states are broke now due to #COVID19 expenses which Trump has not reimbursed them for. We need to take our federal funds back!
1324429774941491204 2020-11-06 03:13:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MacFarlaneNews @RebeccaMcNutt2 If courts don’t hurry &amp; send unbiased officials to supervise sweeps, those ballots being held hostage will be destroyed, burned or not stamped. DeJoy is holding 100’s of 1,000’s ballots &amp; trying to figure out how to invalidate them. Voters need to verify their votes were counted.

1324426042266800135 2020-11-06 02:59:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ValuesCommon @PattyArquette Exactly!!! DeJoy defied a federal judge’s order to get those 300,000 ballots to where they belong. He probably has not date stamped them, could be opening &amp; destroying many &amp; the judge still has not held him in contempt. Barr has DeJoy’s back too. Smh
1324425369244585987 2020-11-06 02:56:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Caffeinefreak @ValuesCommon @PattyArquette They claimed all of a sudden that trump got 200,000 votes for him from mostly Cuban Americans &amp; some Puerto Ricans. Biden was ahead early on.

Racists want to live in a brown country where they don’t speak the language &amp; are too stupid to EVER learn Spanish. Also, do they know they will need to be documented?!
1324419181740249088 2020-11-06 02:31:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MSignorile Then we will run President Obama against him who would beat him by a landslide. He’d be much younger than trump. Might all be moot because trump can’t run from a jail cell!!! 😂😂

1324396399635632129 2020-11-06 01:01:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PattyArquette If there is any way Trump can sabotage, he will. I hope democrats have all their eyes wide open. Trump is mad that paper ballots cannot be manipulated. All eyes should be on ballot counters. Also, where are the 300,000 ballots #DeJoy is holding?! Military ballots must be counted.
1324369944260214784 2020-11-05 23:16:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Liz_Wheeler Just because trump cheats at everything doesn’t mean regular people doing their jobs will cheat. Trump is used to suing people to get his way or get away with bad things he’s done. That will not work for ballot counting. ALL BALLOTS WILL BE COUNTED.

1324077759476518912 2020-11-05 03:55:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @santosmurillo6 @JeffreyRitchey She won’t. But first of all, cases are started &amp; appealed in lower courts &amp; then you see if SCOTUS chooses to hear it. He can’t take it straight to SCOTUS. He really is ignorant &amp; thinks he makes all the laws &amp; dictates what SCOTUS should hear.
1324013473253203969 2020-11-04 23:39:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Thank you @GovernorTomWolf for your statement just now on MSNBC.
1324013112773779457 2020-11-04 23:38:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Justher40212159 @Lorence_Hyler This sums it up. Thank you. And some of those savages are ppl like #KyleRittenhouse who kill &amp; maim innocent ppl as if we are animals to be hunted or run over peaceful protestors like #HeatherHeyer who was recklessly murdered.
1324002867582279685 2020-11-04 22:57:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Rachelgamache1 @Philos_Sofia I will not heal BUT I will try to help my 2 adult kids heal because they’re more American &amp; patriotic than trump &amp; his klan &amp; the Putin-loving GOP &amp; MAGAts are. But they will NOT forget what trump put them, their diverse friends &amp; family through. They will NEVER vote GOP!
1324001964456333316 2020-11-04 22:54:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Justher40212159 I carry shame for some Latinos too.
1323988538577309697 2020-11-04 22:00:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davidmweissman Racism &amp; ignorance in Kentucky &amp; rigging by Putin &amp; GOP voter suppression in South Carolina.
1323984359616090118 2020-11-04 21:44:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Lee_in_Iowa @tonyschwartz Yes but trump installed a puppet at USPS &amp; many ballots have surely gone “missing”. We will never know how many &amp; no one will be punished.
1323983921554415616 2020-11-04 21:42:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tonyschwartz It’s a total waste of time.
1323983560622092291 2020-11-04 21:40:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Verbalfury You’re disgusting!!!
1323982945447718912 2020-11-04 21:38:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Paul_Bradley425 @shakeycrackers Your sincere words are truly appreciated. The Irish did not have it easy here either (well aware of history) &amp; had to fight to survive too. But we all feel it was better here no matter the hurdles. Now I wonder.

1323981684648284160 2020-11-04 21:33:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @admmaskvenzr Yes. They forget that there but for the grace of God it could have been them. We can never stop caring about injustices done to others. I came here legally &amp; am a citizen, but that doesn’t mean I cannot feel the struggles &amp; sacrifices of others. My immigrant mother sacrificed.
1323979873631805441 2020-11-04 21:26:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @listenup473 @JoQuinnbtchycat @chrislhayes Are you surprised.
1323979664533213185 2020-11-04 21:25:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @summeruk1708 Much needed. ❤️
1323979465949696001 2020-11-04 21:24:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @vanderwel_nancy Neither do I!!!
1323976897584353283 2020-11-04 21:14:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DinaChavez10 I heard white suburban women did vote for trump.
1323976747294011395 2020-11-04 21:13:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @strother_e Yes. But I feel betrayed by my own. Many are racists &amp; pious religious zealots hiding their filthy sins behind their Bibles.
1323976262189228034 2020-11-04 21:11:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @puhpuhpuhpow @JoQuinnbtchycat No doubt about that whatsoever but no one will ever be held accountable for sabotaging our election.
1323975926019928064 2020-11-04 21:10:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @HearMeTalkNow @nixw20 Neither does my homeland nor the Caribbean. I live in the city so we do not get much snow. Besides, I LOVE snow as much as I love tropical water. 😃 Not spending my money in a red state where my own people support a racist traitor bc they deny their heritage.

Look how long it’s taken Blacks to fight for justice but they’re still being murdered by racist cops encouraged &amp; condoned by trump/GOP #BlackLivesMatter #FamiliesBelongTogether
1323971238134452224 2020-11-04 20:51:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MBershod It was there all along. The hate/racism.

1323969855561879552 2020-11-04 20:46:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @isitreallysin @KellyLMcKevitt Exactly how me &amp; most of our American adult children feel. They don’t want their children to suffer here.
1323969584592990214 2020-11-04 20:45:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @modine35 Exactly.
1323969501575217153 2020-11-04 20:45:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Paul_Bradley425 @shakeycrackers Staying here is like staying in an abusive relationship which just gets worse &amp; worse. Many good people are literally being killed here because of the color of their skin/ethnicity. It’s atrocious. Immigrants make America great. This is an ungrateful nation who has betrayed many.
1323967841570299905 2020-11-04 20:38:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @morningmika @JoeNBC I love @MichaelSteele &amp; he just made some good points about why/how trump reeled in suburban white women &amp; Latinos. However, you need to bring on a Latino/a to explain to you exactly why Cubans/Venezuelans voted for Trump. It’s the same reasons GOP loves him.
1323965218968555522 2020-11-04 20:28:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @isitreallysin No matter who wins, 🇺🇸 has shown it’s true colors to those whose ancestors were unwillingly brought here in chains to be enslaved &amp; others like me whose land was stolen (my ancestors were here first) &amp; Native Americans who were forcefully crammed into reservations. Racism kills.
1323963721132158978 2020-11-04 20:22:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Paul_Bradley425 @shakeycrackers Not my immigrant/1st generation family &amp; neither will my adult kids &amp; all my many beloved Brown &amp; Black &amp; biracial nieces &amp; nephews under 40 years old. They will either leave America to move back to their parents’ homelands or never vote GOP again!!!
1323962734279610368 2020-11-04 20:18:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @isitreallysin @KellyLMcKevitt Truly devastating. I thought this election would show me that Trump’s Amerikkka is not OUR America. I. WAS. DEAD. WRONG!!!
1323957263036518400 2020-11-04 19:56:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KellyLMcKevitt Our votes were sabotaged by foreign power (Putin) for sure. Why do we have almost same number of voters in 2020 as in 2016? We flipped many seats in 2018 easily. What happened to all NEWLY-registered voters/young ppl/suburban&amp;Black women/Brown citizens/LGBTQ/Bernie supporters?!!
1323948833194299392 2020-11-04 19:22:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @shakeycrackers We are heartbroken. We will NEVER heal. There is no hope for us in America as brown immigrants, documented or not. Don’t know how Black Americans &amp; Native Americans have tolerated so much death &amp; abuse in America.
1323948214916124672 2020-11-04 19:20:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @terror_studies @9ontheturn If Americans do not care that Black people are killed by racist cops &amp; brown babies are caged/killed/separated from their parents forever, you would think they at least care that trump has killed 230,000 AMERICANS! They’re not undocumented immigrants.
1323947330207420417 2020-11-04 19:16:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jhd4141 I thought there were more ppl like you in our America. Apparently not.💔As an immigrant here for 54 of my 61 years who is proud of my heritage but also a patriotic American, this has destroyed me &amp; our 2nd &amp; 3rd generations. I too thought I’d outlive racism/misogyny/homophobia.
1323946048767877122 2020-11-04 19:11:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AnnetteResists @2005HockeyDad Yes.
1323945985421332480 2020-11-04 19:11:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @terror_studies @9ontheturn Also physical interference in our election by Putin. Not into conspiracy theories &amp; our own Intel confirmed Russian interference in 2016 &amp; 2020 has been sabotaged because we have no defense against Putin.
1323945398667542531 2020-11-04 19:09:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @9ontheturn @terror_studies Yes. Racism.

1323941975620571136 2020-11-04 18:55:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @HollyWoodDrago2 I feel the same EXCEPT that Trump has done irreparable harm to my adult AMERICAN kids &amp; MOST of my family &amp; friends. We really thought America was better than this. It clearly is not &amp; we are not wanted here. POC’s lives will continue to be endangered in America.
1323941088286171137 2020-11-04 18:52:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jentinohio93 @cydelarge PUTIN!!!
1323940643601895425 2020-11-04 18:50:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> No matter end result, this is one of the most devastating &amp; traumatizing days of my entire life. I feel like a part of me died when I saw my adult AMERICAN kids holding back tears &amp; looks of sheer terror on their faces. We will never be the same bc racism is blatant in America.
1323938380615503872 2020-11-04 18:41:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MPFIED @BagdMilkSoWhat Either Putin screwed us over or this is who we are - a racist nation which supports traitors/rapists/adulterers/pedophiles/brown-baby cagers&amp;killers/domestic terrorists who mass shoot school kids, Jews &amp; Blacks/science-deniers who are killing us &amp; destroying our earth.
1323936696879239169 2020-11-04 18:34:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @navmanster You are probably right. 💔 Definitely had Election interference by Putin AGAIN. We should’ve had MILLIONS more NEW voters. Total is almost the same as 2016. What happened to all new votes from young ppl, suburban &amp; Black women, GOP w/a conscience &amp; ppl who rarely/never vote?
1323935168969822209 2020-11-04 18:28:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MJWebb3 @TheLyonsDen We the people no longer matter. 💔

1323933907033722880 2020-11-04 18:23:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ariesgirl401 @WajahatAli GM. Needless to say I’ve been awake for 21 hours straight &amp; I had to bear the pain of seeing my adult children swallow tears back &amp; have a look of terror in their eyes. I will never forget the pain this regime has caused my children. No matter the result, they are damaged. 💔😢
1323932416394878978 2020-11-04 18:17:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @lisaannsharp @WajahatAli Not me. Wide awake for 21 hours straight &amp; counting.
1323932030699245568 2020-11-04 18:16:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheLyonsDen No one. America is hated thanks to trump. We are not America first, we are America alone. Look around. We are literally  trapped on our shores bc we have the most #COVID19 so we are banned from most if the world. How ironic.
1323931366514434051 2020-11-04 18:13:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoyceWhiteVance @Lee_in_Iowa But he did.

Too bad there aren’t more Americans like you. Sad day tonight no matter how the election goes. Good luck dealing with your corrupt GOP.

1323927171212206081 2020-11-04 17:56:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RubyTuesday1211 @mmpadellan Notice trump never said anything bad about Putin &amp; Putin has been very quiet for over 6 months. I’m not into conspiracy theories but our own Intel has confirmed Russia interfered in 2016 &amp; would be doing it now too.
1323926342526738434 2020-11-04 17:53:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Bethiebaby72 @USPS You’re up too? I have not slept since 8 am yesterday (Tuesday) morning.
1323926123802173441 2020-11-04 17:52:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Texan_21C @AriMelber He really can do whatever he wants. He will get his way one way or another, legally or illegally. Also, we had election interference. We should’ve had at least 5-10 million more NEW voters (young ppl/suburban women/GOP w/a conscience/black females/LGBTQ). 100 million early votes.
1323924762800934915 2020-11-04 17:47:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @dontmesswithc @USPS I see you’re not getting any sleep my friend.

1323923879925063680 2020-11-04 17:43:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Heaven knows how many DEMOCRAT mail-in ballots were “lost” (destroyed) by #DeJoy &amp; his @USPS.
1323922750440919041 2020-11-04 17:39:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JonahBlank If there was a God, a science-denying, brown baby &amp; Black American killing, rapist, adulterer, genocidal, fake-Christian man would not be president! Trump will destroy the earth &amp; continue killing his own ppl while his GOP enablers continue to get illegally rich. I’m done!!!
1323921278730932225 2020-11-04 17:33:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mickey_dempsey @TerryTerse That base includes ALL the GOP members of Congress.

1323919553013960705 2020-11-04 17:26:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AmandiOnAir Me.
1323916897323229185 2020-11-04 17:16:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> As a Latina, I’m ashamed to say that Latino sellouts are the most to blame for democrats not gaining more congressional seats. Many identify as white. They vote with white people bc they deny their heritage &amp; many are racists. But what happened to the votes of women of ALL races?
1323915763112173568 2020-11-04 17:11:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @puhpuhpuhpow It’s rigged.
1323915653800173573 2020-11-04 17:11:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheSpringChickn Election interference encouraged by trump &amp; corrupt GOP.
1323914402823852032 2020-11-04 17:06:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AriMelber But he will control it illegally. Barr, GOP, courts &amp; SCOTUS will condone &amp; allow it. What do Americans not see?!
1323913390683729922 2020-11-04 17:02:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JazzaleaMia @mmpadellan Because they hate brown people too.
1323913252775120897 2020-11-04 17:01:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RBReich Hold on for what?
1323912486693838854 2020-11-04 16:58:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @johncam @mmpadellan Exactly!!! So where are 25 MILLION more votes? I expected at least 5 million additional votes especially from young ppl &amp; ppl who never voted &amp; ppl who realized that the trump regime is corrupt &amp; cruel causing so much death &amp; poverty in America. Something is not right.
1323911243686621184 2020-11-04 16:53:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jokictripdoub @JasonOverstreet Not weird. It’s part of voter suppression in other states, especially the red ones.

1323910696493568006 2020-11-04 16:51:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 This is part of Trump’s cheating &amp; GOP will continue to look the other way. The American people should file a class action lawsuit (suppression of votes, violation of right to vote?) against Trump &amp; entire govt. Are we not allowed to sue as much as Trump does?
1323909721657610240 2020-11-04 16:47:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @StevenBeschloss @Fuerza_Mundial They like that.

1323907968866373633 2020-11-04 16:40:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @lynnv378 Agree.
1323907889334013953 2020-11-04 16:40:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RBReich @RRalstonAgile Lost faith in our democracy.
1323907710652420097 2020-11-04 16:39:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Weinsteinlaw That’s because this is no longer America.
1323907589852323841 2020-11-04 16:39:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JasonOverstreet @faewings Trump, GOP &amp; Putin are working in making sure Biden does not win. We had almost the same amount of votes counted as in 2016. You mean to tell me we were not able to scrounge up at least 5 million more voters? After all the outrage so many people have shown? Something is wrong.
1323906973352529920 2020-11-04 16:36:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ericgarland @RRalstonAgile Trump owns the federal courts &amp; SCOTUS.
1323906866066448384 2020-11-04 16:36:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WalshFreedom @MinnesotaMaryS They won’t. This is exactly what they wanted.
1323906527607115776 2020-11-04 16:34:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @nytdavidbrooks And not a damn thing we can do about it because the GOP have had Trump’s back all along.
1323906348711632896 2020-11-04 16:34:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @shepaintsOKblue None. Barr will stop investigations in their tracks. We are fucked.
1323906125457199106 2020-11-04 16:33:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EdanClay I agree.
1323905217088397314 2020-11-04 16:29:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tribelaw Doubt it sir. Trump cheated. Trump will shut down the counting. Almost same anoint of votes were counted as in 2016. How is it there were not at least 5 million more new voters registered who voted? Makes no sense.
1323904585946333184 2020-11-04 16:27:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mmpadellan So far, about 125 Million votes have been counted for both Biden &amp; trump. Biden has popular vote. Do you mean to tell me that after all the work Democrats have done in registering more people to vote, we didn’t scrounge up at least 5 million more voters? Number is same as 2016.
1323901856318443527 2020-11-04 16:16:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MSS_Writing You were right.
1323901657030287360 2020-11-04 16:15:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Texan_21C @destructoamf @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump The GOP, Barr &amp; SCOTUS will give trump the power. Every time trump says it does something illegal or heinous, everyone says he can’t do it/get away with it. But he does do it &amp; gets away with it. This is no longer a democracy. What doesn’t anyone get?
1323897545664462848 2020-11-04 15:59:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @anarchess I meant “But it is”.

1323891692806807552 2020-11-04 15:35:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MeidasTouch Who will stop him?! America. Congratulations. You now have Dictator Trump NOT a president. Democracy died tonight bc corrupt GOP &amp; entire Fed govt is in bed w/trump &amp; Putin. Trump’s SCOTUS will stop ballot counting tomorrow w/sycophant Barrett joining majority. Bye America!
1323889846407090176 2020-11-04 15:28:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @anarchess Not it is. What does that tell you about America. Either 70% of Americans are racist terrorists or Putin sabotaged/changed our votes. EC suppresses the popular vote. DeJoy defies a judge’s orders &amp; Barr protects him. Democracy is dead sir.
1323887015939739652 2020-11-04 15:17:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mmpadellan That’s what he will do. He’s giving Putin time to finish changing/sabotaging our votes.
1323886805461196801 2020-11-04 15:16:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Smilan317 If Trump wins, the electoral college will remain. Remember, it is there just to suppress our popular votes.

1323879410370490368 2020-11-04 14:47:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @trom771 @viphires Americans are naive (or PENDEJOS as we say in Spanish) because we think our election has not been tampered with by Putin. It has.

He came up w/business ideas, ppl &amp; banks funded him, then he had no real plan bc he has no real brains, so he just took the money &amp; filed for bankruptcy. He is NOT a Mike Bloomberg, Steyer, Gates etc.

I raised my kids the same. The only people we do not interact with are RACISTS. If someone says something bad about any race or religion, we do not befriend them. Racism kills.

Not all judges will do the right thing nor admit their bias especially if they’re GOP. No judge I know would’ve said they were “not happy with that finding”! Dems need to pack courts!

Also, if he wins EC with 50 MILLION more votes for Biden, democracy is dead. #AbolishTheElectoralCollege It should be #3 on the list with #Add4SCOTUS as #2 &amp; #ControlCovid as #1

1323306514984161282 2020-11-03 00:50:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DogginTrump That is NOT speaking Spanish. That is sounding out words to play to Cubans &amp; Venezuelans in Florida. The rest of us won’t fall for it. There ARE many though who realize Trump is acting like Castro &amp; other dictators. Most are not fooled either.

1323105886156541954 2020-11-02 11:33:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GeoffRBennett No President should ever be allowed to take over property which belongs to the people. We are paying for this shit while there are hungry &amp; homeless AMERICANS everywhere!!!

1323091669282152448 2020-11-02 10:36:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SuzeQKnits Maybe those are the few who own stocks  &amp; are making huge profits in the stock market. Also, all kinds of people are racists &amp; that’s a MAGAt’s number one issue.
1323091182860279808 2020-11-02 10:34:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RoArquette Agree. But trump thinks he owns everything in America &amp; can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants, to whomever he wants. He’s a full blown dictator &amp; anyone who doesn’t see that by now is foolish.  Just a few threads are holding our democracy together.

1323061770727182336 2020-11-02 08:38:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BLazara @JoshuaPotash That’s part of defunding. Replace them with others who have the skills to handle certain crises.
1323061506007846913 2020-11-02 08:36:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KatSladen @acnewsitics We need to send a message that they need to be careful or we will defend ourselves or throw their domestic terrorist asses in jail!! We cannot be meek.
1323061056034332673 2020-11-02 08:35:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ddale8 He really does think his word is LAW &amp; that he can also break all laws! Feels powerful w/ #Barr @GOP #SCOTUS behind him doing his bidding. WE THE PEOPLE will teach them ALL a lesson! Biden AG will prosecute all traitors/criminals, we will #VoteOutCorruptGOP &amp; we WILL #Add4SCOTUS!
1323058982248947713 2020-11-02 08:26:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bamableu We are NOT the ones who want or will start any violence!!! But the freaking MAGAts need to know we will NOT be easy targets &amp; that we are perfectly capable of defending ourselves &amp; we WILL defend ourselves. We need to send out that message! No one will touch my family!!!
1323057293253070848 2020-11-02 08:20:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RoArquette Since when does Barr have authority to tell police depts paid by city taxpayers how to treat their citizens? Did he go around promising them immunity if they harm/kill Dems?! No AG should ever have this authority-need to sit in DC at their desk. @SpeakerPelosi CUT AG/DOJ BUDGET!
1323055539316731905 2020-11-02 08:13:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @McFaul To remind us to #DefundThePolice then kick out all the racists #reformthepolice
1323055163804950529 2020-11-02 08:11:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Sal_Guerra30 Nope. Not one. And Democrats should never ever forget this it forgive them. We need to stomp on them like doormats when we take it all back.

1322963046868934657 2020-11-02 02:05:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ariesgirl401 @BCOOL333 Understood.

1322962612120899586 2020-11-02 02:04:00 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ariesgirl401 @BCOOL333 Thank you. It was easy. The young people could not wait to #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare so they were up bright &amp; early on the 1st day of early voting. Just started that in NYC in 2018.
1322961834857635844 2020-11-02 02:00:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @H_MitchellPhoto @DonaldJTrumpJr Me!!! He will NEVER feel that love.
1322961385987428356 2020-11-02 01:59:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JohnCornyn At least it’s not FOREIGN finura/dark money/PACS!!! Hope you lose you racist nasty man.
1322961052443791360 2020-11-02 01:57:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Love this!!!!! Resister family, please retweet this #BidenAd Make it go viral. Tweet by one of my favorite resisters who’s been silently watching us while he resists. My son. The young will be the change we need. 👇🏼❤️
1322960172260741121 2020-11-02 01:54:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PattyArquette Because many are not productive members of society &amp; dumb.

1322959763924226050 2020-11-02 01:52:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BCOOL333 Last Saturday 10/24 in NYC early voting with SOME of my family. They’ve all been voting early! #LatinosConBiden #LatinosForBidenHarris #FamiliesForBiden #FamiliesBelongTogether #nycvotes Waited 3 hours to cast our votes.  https://t.co/lJPUNyxXQZ

1322956513498062848 2020-11-02 01:39:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @michaelschweitz I will warn you. It hurts like hell after you have any kind of knee surgery. I have a high tolerance for pain but I would’ve rather had a 3rd c-section than my knee surgery in 2000. 🙏🏽🙏🏽

1322952297157189638 2020-11-02 01:23:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Agree.
1322952056139882497 2020-11-02 01:22:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davidhogg111 So very proudof you &amp; the many young people in my family. They’re voting blue for YOU, babies in cages, #GeorgeFloyd #BreonnaTaylor #DACA #VotingRights #GayRights #WomensRights Many of you will soon run the country! Stay safe!! God bless!!
1322950082346520577 2020-11-02 01:14:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> 3 more days. Today is the last day for #earlyvotingnyc #NYC please go out to vote at your nearest early voting place today. Most open until 4 pm &amp; some even open as late as 9 pm. Otherwise, #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare on 11/3!!
1322949241493487621 2020-11-02 01:10:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JenniferJJacobs Fauci does NOT work for trump &amp; he’s a professional who is free to tell the people the facts/truth. That is NOT political. #FactsMatter
1322948275624955905 2020-11-02 01:07:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BedfordOak @mrderrick_ @Sd26Slush @isabellabc @OneGirlsRant @davenewworld_2 I could not believe that my little cousin could talk like that having grown up around me. He raised 2 very angry &amp; confused kids. Their sweet Greek-American mom who was NOT like him died suddenly at age 42 in 2016 right after he retired at age 45. He never moved up in rank. Dummy
1322945344649519125 2020-11-02 00:55:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> These #ThugsInBlue need to be charged with police brutality. These people were not doing anything which warranted the use of tear gas. #DefundThePolice #reformthepolice

1322943661299163141 2020-11-02 00:48:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TimNoEgo In order to avoid migraines, I need a daily dose of coffee, regular dose of chocolates &amp; at least 5 hours sleep per night. Stress gives me migraines so I try not to stress the little things &amp; be grateful for the good things in my life. Had them since I was 14. Tylenol works 4 me.
1322873540195082247 2020-11-01 20:10:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I think I like this!!! 👇🏼 Workrd over 40 years!!! I would like some kind of reward for that. Maybe pay less taxes? Get free healthcare? Free college for our kids so we don’t have to help them pay it back/loan forgiveness? Think I’ve paid enough taxes for my 2 kids to get perks.
1322778895544950785 2020-11-01 13:53:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump Texas despises you.
1322778788875350016 2020-11-01 13:53:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Exactly what it is &amp; trump loves it!!! He tweeted that!!!
1322777825137594368 2020-11-01 13:49:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump How nice. Too bad your #CorruptAndComplicitGOP is dead. Hope you wake up soon. America should move forward not backward. Brown babies should not be ripped from parents’ arms &amp; Black ppl should not be killed by racist cop’s knees or shot in their own homes.
1322776817317650433 2020-11-01 13:45:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @StevijoPayne Great advice. Will spend quality time with my adult kids. They need comfort, assurance &amp; strength. Keep the faith!!

1322774001924657153 2020-11-01 13:34:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kc_lighten Heard FBI is investigating. Let’s see if Barr blocks FBI to protect them the way he wants to protect #DomesticTerrorist #KyleRittenhouse

1322772196239040515 2020-11-01 13:27:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @barrieblonde We teach our kids &amp; their kids that America belongs to us all. Racism is NOT an option. These kids will NOT be voting GOP anytime soon. They’ve seen trump &amp; his regime in action &amp; know racism kills. #GeorgeFloyd video disturbed them very much just like kids in cages. 💔
1322770944100847616 2020-11-01 13:22:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> THIS. SHIT. HAS. TO. STOP. COPS SHOULD NOT BE ATTACKING CITIZENS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES &amp; NOT COMMITTING CRIMES!! We will demand that some kind of commission on police reform nationwide be formed to investigate all cops &amp; fire them for abuse! Buffalo PD pushed old man remember?

Went to children’s protest in June w/nieces &amp; nephews &amp; their kids. 1 of my grandnephews begged me to speak. #BlackLivesMatter #GeorgeFloyd He’s standing right next to me.

White racist cops hate their own white ppl when they side w/POC more than they hate us. Just like in good ole days. #ThugsInBlue If I was a cop, no way would I treat any everyday citizen like this.

He could never pass for white. His gun brought out macho man in him. He verbally abused his kids all their lives. They never went to college. Grew up dysfunctional. His colleague brought out racism.
1322761919682564099 2020-11-01 12:46:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @rms0866_reed @washdcbhl Yeah.

1322758354746273793 2020-11-01 12:32:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ordinary1World 😂😂 I love candy. I hope I can stretch it out for a few weeks but don’t trust myself. Eating a few now. Chocolates are my weakness!!! I’ll let you know when I eat them all. 😂😂

He was a dummy &amp; coward whose sisters had to protect him from bullies. Within 6 months of being cop, he became a racist. Said to me “Gotta patrol animals in the zoo” &amp; moved out of NYC to suburbs.

1322707652506472450 2020-11-01 09:10:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mjs_DC I think @TheDemocrats @DNC should start fooling the same lawsuits in republican areas. Many of their votes can also be invalidated for justifiable reasons.
1322707202084405248 2020-11-01 09:09:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mjs_DC They didn’t “draw” him. The fix is in. Worked in the legal field over 40 years. People with influence can easily “draw” a favorable biased judge.

They are living it up!!! Very happy together.
1322429208933576705 2020-10-31 14:44:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow @genevieve_777 And we are paying for them.
1322429052871938048 2020-10-31 14:43:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @gabriel_zucman @alimor999 The trump tax scam break helped enormously!! I’m sure I paid more taxes than any of those billionaires. They should be the ones paying federal taxes. We should only pay state &amp; local taxes to support our states. I’d gladly give my state what I pay in federal taxes.
1322428006762221568 2020-10-31 14:39:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JimTaggartBFC You’re right. If my significant other died, God forbid, his 3 year old &amp; 1 year old grandkids would grow up without their grandfather. My daughter is a newlywed, so I’d like to live to see grandkids.

Trump is a Nazi. Trump is a communist. Trump is a racist. Trump aligns himself w/Putin, KJU &amp; MBS!!! They kill their opponents &amp; citizens.

Ppl like her are not allowed in or able to easily apply for green cards or citizenship under a trump administration. I’d be disappointed in her if she likes trump &amp; his horrendous immigration policies esp. the stealing, caging &amp; killing of brown babies!

1321893813712048130 2020-10-30 03:16:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Thank God for these Cuban Americans who know their families would NEVER get asylum w/someone like Trump as President. Our great government (socialist) programs are what helped many settle here. Those are our federal taxes helping those who need it. Immigrants pay it back!

Under trump, they would not have gotten asylum.

Kavanaugh has NO judicial temperament &amp; Barrett is a religious fanatic. Not good candidates. They have to interpret the law &amp; not let their personal beliefs taint their decisions. They have agendas. Horrifying.

We have racists in every color. Plus, many are staunch Catholics who are pro-life. Of course, adultery is fine with the men.

Some justifiably afraid of communism but many more others are sellouts who want to forget where they came from &amp; are too selfish to care about plight of other Latinos seeking asylum.

1321674487742500864 2020-10-29 12:45:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @faewings They’re never respectful. They’re pushy, angry &amp; verbally abusive. Had to get rid of a few in my family. They’re also the stupidest in the family &amp; have many skeletons in their closets. Pious, judgmental fools.
1321673894051385344 2020-10-29 12:43:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MysterySolvent Yes!!!!

1321673174149435394 2020-10-29 12:40:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @StaceyWeikel @Dknight10k It’s a learning process. It begins w/us knowing we are not racist in any way. Many people, of all colors, are racist &amp; it never goes away. I was not raised to be racist, I love learning about &amp; interacting w/all cultures. I despise racism (homophobes &amp; sexists). We are all equal.
1321670603296878593 2020-10-29 12:30:01 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ProjectLincoln @indiana_rachel Somebody better find their parents &amp; many better be held accountable &amp; pay a high price.

I know of, &amp; personally know, lots of brilliant Black/Brown women. Justice Sotomayor is brilliant! She &amp; AOC are perfect role models to our little girls/young women. Proud to know real women.

I’ve worked in legal field for 40 yrs-have always had great respect for judges &amp; our laws. Probably because I live in a blue state where the bench is mostly Democrat judges who have integrity &amp; diverse ethical prosecutors &amp; defense attorneys.

1321629743234584577 2020-10-29 09:47:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> But Governor #DeathSantis is ok with that because they’re all criminals.

When trump loses on 11/3, what will his trips be labeled? Official White House events?! What will he talk about when it’s all over?

1321516346115579905 2020-10-29 02:17:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mhdksafa Hell yeah!!! We voted on Saturday!! #FamiliesForBiden #FamiliesBelongTogether Most of the rest of my family &amp; friends (100’s) are early voting.  https://t.co/09jJyzPHX2
1321513318708895744 2020-10-29 02:05:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EliStokols So Trump just started what looked like an official WH event (presidential seal at podium) in #LasVegas at HIS hotel &amp; parades out a bunch of #TrumpSycophants to kiss his axx. Not even @FoxNews is airing it!!! He wants FREE Trump campaign tv time. Even #FakeFoxNews cut away. 😂😂

1321509556057497601 2020-10-29 01:50:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @oneofthegothams His campaign put outstatement full of lies claiming they provided tents, heaters, hot cocoa etc. #TrumpPropaganda No proof. Why didn’t we see it in the videos &amp; pictures posted last night? No way they thought ahead enough to set up tents. No money. We protestors pay our own way!!
1321508363201642498 2020-10-29 01:45:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LadyNana_J @Jeff_Paul Exactly.
1321507883335471105 2020-10-29 01:43:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MSNBC I didn’t see tents, heaters, hand warmers etc or see them happily  drinking hot cocoa in any of the videos &amp; pictures. Post them!!Why did some end up in the hospital? MSNBC stop spreading #TrumpPropaganda - statements without proof. This is enough to make #MAGAts say it is true!!
1321506845958328320 2020-10-29 01:39:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @gtconway3d Think you all are just playing games with us. Doesn’t matter to you all if trump wins or loses. You have nothing to lose.

Also learned he was the 16th president, that he issued emancipation proclamation, that he was poor, a lawyer &amp; assassinated in a theater!! NEVER FORGOT IT! I was a new immigrant back then!!! JFC!!! He didn’t know it; knows his idiots didn’t either.

I really don’t care, do u? It is what it is!! Too bad they’re too dumb to see trump doesn’t GAF &amp; dumped them for a warm cozy ride home. They should wait 10 hrs like voters!

All of the innocent ppl you listed cannot avoid eventually coming into contact w/MAGAts but if they know they’re magats, these ppl should wear masks, wash their hands &amp; social distance if possible. We have about 6 in my family of 100’s, so we avoid them.

1321191419026022401 2020-10-28 04:45:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He should not use the word “shot” in any form. His crazed domestic terrorists will interpret it any way they want.
1321187471707824131 2020-10-28 04:30:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KimKardashian All while your husband tries to steal votes from Biden. Smfh Glad you’re all doing well financially. Hope you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes which could help more than just 1 person. Did you vote? (You lost a fan for giving trump credibility.)

Trump either NEVER had it OR reacted well to plasma OR is pumped up on drugs till he crashes. Also, psychopaths can go on &amp; on &amp; on ...
1320854711189278721 2020-10-27 06:27:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @djrothkopf So now we have to punish trump, his family, his cronies &amp; complicit GOP, as many as we can, so it will never ever happen again! @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats WE DEMAND IT!!! When we win it all back, you have a lot of work to do along with NEW AG!!! Will replace you if you don’t.

1320825178050486272 2020-10-27 04:30:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So this is why we’re not getting all the proper guidance. NO POTUS should be able to have this control over ANY of our federal agencies which are paid by us to work for the people. Also should not be allowed to fire civil servants ever.

1320805220864217088 2020-10-27 03:11:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Bethiebaby72 Exactly! Trump &amp; his administration claim Trump has “done more for the Black community than anyone else in history” so we are all now very successful. Also, in these 4 years, all his #MAGAts have great jobs bc he deported all brown ppl who were taking their jobs. Lots of winning!

Good riddance!!

1320518954553692161 2020-10-26 08:13:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @60Minutes Pence’s middle name is “The President”! I’ve never witnessed such quick transformation of a man who once looked/sounded dignified &amp; honest enough to maybe be POTUS turn into such a lying, weak brown-noser. Pence’s hypocrisy makes me puke! No man should ever worship a mere man. 🤮

1320401203554062337 2020-10-26 00:25:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> When our supposed“richest &amp; most powerful nation in the world” cannot afford to financially support its people, who ARE the economy, we have lost the right to label ourselves this way. They only worry about the 1%. It’s a joke the way trump admin has handled #COVID19
1320400531031019520 2020-10-26 00:23:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Why we do NOT trust NYPD to protect the citizens of our mostly blue state. They worship trump &amp; hate the citizens who pay them!!!
1320400308888096769 2020-10-26 00:22:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor It is unacceptable @NYPDShea that officers in uniform/on duty while WE pay them are standing on a corner blasting out “Trump 2020” like they work for trump!! They are not even DeBlasio’s constituents bc they live outside NYC! NYPD needs total reform!
1320399196218920960 2020-10-26 00:17:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So basically @MarkMeadows admitted how incompetent trump &amp; his administration are. RE #COVID19 the supposed “richest &amp; most powerful nation” should be ashamed that we are NUMBER 1 in the ENTIRE WORLD in cases &amp; deaths! This is in not what we want to #BeBest at! SHAMEFUL/CRIMINAL!

They knew all the New Yorkers voting for #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 weren’t going to put up with them not wearing masks around us. They just want an excuse to go out on unlimited paid leave if they get it which is why they don’t wear masks.

1319292336371691521 2020-10-22 22:59:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenWarren Which is why we want you ALL to remember that when WE THE PEOPLE get back Senate &amp; WH!! You must all do whatever you have to do to expeditiously &amp; ruthlessly ram our Dem agenda thru ASAP! No negotiating w/GOP. Give NOTHING to GOP. Lots of work to do &amp; GOP must be sidelined.

1319272741644582918 2020-10-22 21:41:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MyFateMyDestiny They just want a ruling 1% (mostly white) in America. Our 20-40 year old kids are no where near where my immigrant parents nor I were in the 60’s to 90’s even w/college degrees! Many are living w/their parents or need their help bc they’re drowning in student loan debt w/low pay.

Let them spend their budget to build mobile hospitals like many of us in blue states had to do. Let them go broke taking care of their COVID patients.
1319269212901183488 2020-10-22 21:27:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @davidmweissman They want to brainwash our kids about white supremacy &amp; its “culture”. There is NO 1 culture in America. Also, they won’t teach them the REAL history of slavery, interment camps etc. They want to go back 200 years.

That’s how my FIL/BILs hold their sons too. That’s how many REAL men I know show their sons that they love them, esp. when they know the loss of a child! Too bad no trump man had a dad like that

1319068488183500801 2020-10-22 08:10:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DavidCornDC Ratcliffe is a trump propagandist.
1319068116517867520 2020-10-22 08:08:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @HuffPost @SadieMaeTN Yeah. Ratcliffe said it was to hurt trump. He is setting it up for trump to claim the election was rigged against him when he loses. I see right through that.
1319067765739868162 2020-10-22 08:07:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @battletested5 He didn’t recant. He pushed the conspiracy theory that there was interference to hurt trump.

1319061723563917312 2020-10-22 07:43:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kaitlancollins Trump has asked DNI Radcliffe to pull this stunt.

Red states are spreading virus to blue states who have worked so hard &amp; sacrificed so much to stop the spread. Trump won’t reimburse us for #COVID19 expenses &amp; if our economies are destroyed, red states suffer too.
1318993337232379912 2020-10-22 03:11:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @In2TheSunshine2 There is even more that we do not know about. America is guilty of #CrimesAgainstHumanity #Genocide

1318955141815566336 2020-10-22 00:39:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DWUhlfelderLaw He’s already hiding the real statistics. Florida should get NO FUNDS for #COVID19 @SpeakerPelosi Any state which has not instituted proper protocol to stop the spread should not get help. Funds will not be used properly.
1318954535184977922 2020-10-22 00:37:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WithForethought Congrats!!!

We cannot erase what racist trump &amp; his brown shirts have done &amp; we may never fix that, but we need to prosecute many for #CrimesAgainstChildren &amp; STOP CRUEL policies! Vote this motherfucker out!!
1318953429088260096 2020-10-22 00:32:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jennycohn1 Heard twitter is doing that with some tweets, mostly if they’re political.

1318938336573198336 2020-10-21 23:32:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JonCampbellGAN It makes sense. Many in NJ, CT &amp; PA work in NY &amp; vice-versa. But people from all 4 states should respect #COVID19 protocol. #WearAMask #Sanitize #SocialDistance #TestAndTrace #Quarantine #NewYorkTough
1318937234440097796 2020-10-21 23:28:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ashe2189 Followed. I think we all need to build up our accounts. There’s a long road of work still ahead of us after we take back the Senate &amp; White House.
1318936905833238531 2020-10-21 23:27:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Shut up man. #FakeChristian #SeparationOfChurchAndState is a must. Become a preacher if you want to preach. Maybe you can get as rich as Olsteen while not paying taxes. We’re getting rid of corrupt GOP! #EnoughIsEnough
1318935228686139392 2020-10-21 23:20:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JohnCornyn A GOP billionaire about to infuse trump campaign with a double digit million dollar contribution! Why can Democrats not do the same?! You are NOT the only party. At least Dems are not accepting corporate pac monies; most have grassroots campaign donations from WE THE PEOPLE!

1318912592304345088 2020-10-21 21:50:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MichaelArt123 More like national pandemic response. We’re no longer a global leader. We’re a laughing stock thanks to trump. Biden will have to win back global respect.
1318911865192407040 2020-10-21 21:47:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo All involved should pay huge price for these #CrimesAgainstChildren This is horrendous. As an immigrant, I know what it’s like to be separated from my mother for 10 months when I was 6. She came to USA first to get her green card. It’s been 55 years &amp; still remember the pain.

My 83 year old dad &amp; my mom (died in 2008💔) taught both sister &amp; I that we could do anything no matter our gender. Both parents cooked, cleaned, painted, sewed, worked &amp; did home renovations. The roles were interchangeable. Made us independent women.

Sometimes we want to be asked “Honey, what’s wrong?” But sometimes you guys are afraid to hear the answer bc we may be pissed at you. Don’t be afraid. Ask. Listen. Sympathize.

You’re smart enough to know Trumps will use your name/face for their propaganda!! Meanwhile you lost a loyal fan who believes in #BlackLivesMatter bc #GeorgeFloyd #BreonnaTaylor are my kids too!!! FU!

Instead, those of us still working are supporting the entire fascist regime &amp; corporations &amp; red GOP-run states.

He couldn’t slip $100 seeing as he only goes to church twice a year? He’ll put this down as a $100,000 charitable deduction on  his tax returns. 😂😂

And yes, early voters can file emergency petitions to the assigned election judge (usually in your county’s Supreme or District Court) ti resolve your issues.

Check with your local Board of Elections to see where you can find a judge if you need one.

1317142179509395456 2020-10-17 00:35:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AlxThomp Exactly!!! Drain the swamp for real!!! At least most of our Dem candidates did not take corporate donations this election. They don’t owe any favors to the rich. Grass roots is what funded @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris &amp; others!! They work for THE PEOPLE!!!

No excuses or negotiating w/GOP or we will replace you! Blue states/immigrants/workers like CA &amp; NY are THE ECONOMY!!! Tired of this racist trump regime!!

Meanwhile my kids continue to make sure they don’t get infected at work to protect ME from dying &amp; I’m in decent shape but still over 60! Do some good!
1317130055378755585 2020-10-16 23:47:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @gregolear @patrick_darleen Exactly. If I got #COVID19 I would NOT get life-saving treatment bc it’s only for rich white connected people. #WhitePrivilege That’s one of the many things wrong with America.

1316944379009957889 2020-10-16 11:29:42 +0800 <nanelvisfan> You’d think by now geniuses at WH would’ve briefed stable genius as to who Boogaloo Boys/Proud Boys/QAnon are &amp; that THERE IS NO ANTIFA!! Anyone who grew up in 70’s also knows who David Duke is! He’s either lying or a dummy! He knew nothing about QAnon except anti-pedophiles! 😂

We will be watching our Dems carefully from now on &amp; we will replace them if they don’t do the job WE elected them to do. That’s how we got AOC; got rid of a Dem who’d done nothing. Young people are researching &amp; determined to change political scenario.

Makes me jealous but much respect. My mom always said music keeps you young (her fave was 50 Cent) &amp; I love all kinds of music; it speaks to me. ❤️
1316498108663107586 2020-10-15 05:56:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @iambrig @icecube U really think republicans will put up 500 Billion of OUR tax dollars for ANY Black causes?! 1st of all, it’s Speaker Pelosi who has the purse &amp; 2nd of all, Trump/GOP have put us TRILLIONS in debt!! A Dem President will have to save our wrecked economy AGAIN along w/saving lives!
1316497176902725632 2020-10-15 05:52:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @icecube Shut up man!!!!! Do you really think trump gives a fxck about Black ppl or your damn plan?!?! If so, you’re a foolish idiot. Go hang with @kanyewest #DonKing @HerschelWalker &amp; all those fools who think trump loves you guys!! You’re ALL “sons of bitches” to quote #RacistInChief

1316494647947153410 2020-10-15 05:42:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ky_Gill28 @MReele NBC News &amp; CNBC are separate channels. I know they’re related &amp; I won’t watch trump &amp; I won’t watch NBC or NBC News, but I can’t give up my favorite ladies &amp; 1 guy on MSNBC.
1316493573609717760 2020-10-15 05:38:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JimTaggartBFC @KamalaHarris I know. She had to contain herself. But our revenge is that Harris WILL be our NEXT Vice President!!!

1316482769095192581 2020-10-15 04:55:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Why is #Barrett looking @KamalaHarris OUR NEXT VP as if she has NO IDEA about the history of what America did to Black Americans when they were finally granted the right to vote (albeit 1 vote was only 3/5 of 1 human vote)?! She smiled 1st &amp; now frowns! #TruthHurts #Originalist

1316474907702767616 2020-10-15 04:24:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @icecube Funny because it’s people like trump &amp; GOP who always leave America broke!! Democrats have to ALWAYS come in to rescue the bad economy left by GOP! Trump made it worse than any other. Guess you don’t care abt racists killing Black ppl &amp; caging my brown babies. #IceCubeLostAFan
1316473939405811712 2020-10-15 04:20:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @icecube loved trump’s tax break. All about the money. Damn shame!!!

1316470158496538624 2020-10-15 04:05:19 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NBCPolitics Bad move!!!
1316469545557729280 2020-10-15 04:02:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JenniferJJacobs Not surprised. That’s why we haven’t seen Melania. She must be pissed. But she will continue her evil ways.
1316466007532339201 2020-10-15 03:48:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Guess what @NBCNews MILLIONS of us will #BoycottNBCNews #TrumpPropagandaTV “town hall” &amp; most likely further programming. Bad move to reward criminal Trump with FREE TV CAMPAIGN TIME after he chickened out of a REAL presidential debate!!
1316460739276812289 2020-10-15 03:27:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mmpadellan She did say she had a glass of wine last night (could’ve been more). Most moms with 1 kid at home, much less 7 kids, don’t have that luxury. She must have a great nanny.
1316460167911936000 2020-10-15 03:25:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mdnij34 Yes.

1316457253231357952 2020-10-15 03:14:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> They can’t fix the sound for the #ShamSCOTUSHearing to continue. Another ominous sign like the flies on trump, pence &amp; Barrett.
1316456479873028096 2020-10-15 03:10:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @amyklobuchar You are right!!!

1316454857461706753 2020-10-15 03:04:31 +0800 <nanelvisfan> If we go into a depression it’s bc trump &amp; @GOP ruined our economy starting w/#TaxBreakForTheRich, wall/DHS/ICE/CBP funding for racist agenda &amp; mishandling/misspending on #COVID19 He added trillions in debt unnecessarily &amp; now ppl are broke due to lack of national plan.
1316453493356535809 2020-10-15 02:59:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Relapse?! He’s hoarse &amp; swallowed his own phlegm.

1316431495863717889 2020-10-15 01:31:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYGovCuomo What will you do about this?! You expect NYC to #WearAMask but Long Islanders can do what they want to continue the spread?! This is one of the many reasons why NY #COVID19 cases are going up.
1316430248267874310 2020-10-15 01:26:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Bob_Ortega @NGallonCNN There must be more.

1316428487910199302 2020-10-15 01:19:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> GOP partying, joking, laughing w/Barrett &amp; talking abt sports while 216,000 Americans have died &amp; thousands more have died DURING this #ShamSCOTUSHearing is horrifying. They are giddy w/ power! Will they dance soon? @SenateDems VOTE NO @SpeakerPelosi STAND YOUR GROUND RE STIMULUS
1316426735508914188 2020-10-15 01:12:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @arappeport Does he really think Biden will ask him to stay?!?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1316414754559275008 2020-10-15 00:25:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AttorneyCrump @AZsunshine_mama Black man would’ve been dead. So racist cops kill POC &amp; Black cops are afraid to hurt White guys. Subconsciously taught to bow down to them. Got it.
1316413863198425090 2020-10-15 00:21:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AttorneyCrump @AZsunshine_mama He ran away from them (which would’ve gotten a black man shot in the back) &amp; cops don’t ask him to put his HANDS UP even while he’s hiding 1 hand behind his back. Questioning him so sweetly. Smfh
1316413392958230535 2020-10-15 00:19:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AttorneyCrump @AZsunshine_mama Different laws &amp; police tactics for different folks sir.

People in red states should definitely vote bc their votes are needed but they assume since it’s a red state, their votes won’t matter. EVERY VOTE MATTERS!!!!!

1314324766703202305 2020-10-09 06:00:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acosta I will say it again, MY PEOPLE are NOT “killers, murderers &amp; rapists”! America is full of millions of these - they’re the White supremacists/militias/mass shooters &amp; most serial killers &amp; rapists are white. We come here to work hard &amp; make others rich on our sweat!
1314323833990635520 2020-10-09 05:56:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @clairecmc He was coughing out his lungs on tv a couple of days ago. What about Barr &amp; Christie? Pence didn’t look so hot either.
1314323621997932544 2020-10-09 05:55:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jonathanvswan We know what we want &amp; it is no ones business.

1314308364185280528 2020-10-09 04:55:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @brianschatz Exactly! Americans never hesitate to call a group of POC/Muslims TERRORISTS but if they’re white, make all kinds of excuses! There is NO ANTIFA!! #BlackLivesMatter are NOT terrorists-ordinary ppl like ME who are asking for justice/equality! #KyleRittenhouseIsATerrorist #FDT

1314290462019194883 2020-10-09 03:43:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LeonaLioness6 Feeling the same.
1314290329366003714 2020-10-09 03:43:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @rmayemsinger Nope. My mind has been made up since 2016!!! No October surprise will change my mind either!!!
1314288252854116355 2020-10-09 03:35:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AOC @Lawrence They are DEFINITELY domestic terrorists but you know ... they’re white. #KyleRittenhouse is a domestic terrorist too.
1314287966785867778 2020-10-09 03:34:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @carolealana @GeorgeTakei It’s blurred, no outside noise like birds chirping. He’s superimposed on that image. Dictators do this.
1314287759159373826 2020-10-09 03:33:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GeorgeTakei No doubt!
1314287617882689544 2020-10-09 03:32:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricTrump Pence had pink eye &amp; a fly in his hair for 2 minutes. Ominous sign!! What do flies gravitate towards? 😂😂😂😂
1314287246036566018 2020-10-09 03:31:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @fromMA @G8trz4ever Or Black Lives Matter members like ME?!
1314287123168743424 2020-10-09 03:30:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SusanPage @debates You let Pence get away with a lot. I do understand that many are conditioned to defer to White men. We need to fix this!
1314286839604408321 2020-10-09 03:29:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Tom_Winter Can you tell me how many belonged to our radical left wing members of Antifa (doesn’t exist) or @Blklivesmatter (I’m one of millions)? Asking for a friend! The greatest threat to our lives besides trump are radical right wing organized militias &amp; hate groups! The FBI agrees!
1314285429676478465 2020-10-09 03:23:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @stayceespeaks @johnchalloran I will pray for your mom and you. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

1314246619563520000 2020-10-09 00:49:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bblock29 They are. They are #TrumpsArmedMilitia !!! They don’t consider him the “government”, they consider trump as their “leader”! They want him in office forever bc they want to make America white. Glad they caught those sons of bitches! @GovWhitmer PLEASE GET PROTECTION!! Stay safe!!
1314245965549887488 2020-10-09 00:47:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dknight10k No. GOP is dead!!!
1314245717620396032 2020-10-09 00:46:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> These are trump’s supporters. They want him to stay in office forever bc they do not consider trump’s regime “government” &amp; they know he will let them get away w/killing those who do not support trump. See #KyleRittenhouse &amp; how government is protecting that racist who killed!!!
1314244847214231556 2020-10-09 00:42:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @juliesauls901 We should try to investigate them all. Judges CAN be removed.
1314243917613858816 2020-10-09 00:39:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Lisa43Sanders They will cover up!!!! NO DOUBT!!!
1314243344554393603 2020-10-09 00:36:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Ramarion85 That’s what it was supposed to do. The RICH paid NOTHING so we had to pay MORE! Trump removed many of our deductions. We need to VOTE OUT ALL GOP &amp; vote in working class Democrats! Warren is rich now (she EARNED it) but has NOT forgotten what it was like to struggle financially.
1314242435200016384 2020-10-09 00:33:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ozzy0201 She’s 30 now. My kids are very well politically informed &amp; they are researching all candidates. This is the generation which will vote out GOP &amp; run for office. My son is seriously considering running.

The few which own stocks have seen them go up &amp; down. Capitalism won’t let market crash bc it’s run by the rich. The few w/ 401Ks see them go down more than up. GOP has killed the middle class!!
1314240733247832066 2020-10-09 00:26:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Braydennturner @nytimes @jayoung1892 Yes it would. It can be changed &amp; it WILL be.

1314239840167305216 2020-10-09 00:22:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @dontmesswithc Yes. He was interviewed by phone.
1314239327686230016 2020-10-09 00:20:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeNBC He is disgustingly shameless. He’s worse than trump because he should know better because he’s smarter. There’s nothing “Christian” about him!!!

1314236714618171393 2020-10-09 00:10:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GeoffRBennett @carolelee @ckubeNBC It should be illegal for ANY public official whom we elect &amp; pay to have anyone sign NDAs!!!! Make it a law!!! They are not private citizens!! NDAs force ppl to keep secrets to cover up! Trump lives by NDAs &amp; lawsuits to cover up crimes/illegal activities!! FIRE THE DOCTORS!!
1314235450509471744 2020-10-09 00:05:23 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He’s insane &amp; fake Fox News won’t accept it.

1314234735892353026 2020-10-09 00:02:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> People who have something to hide &amp; who do illegal, dirty things are the ones who make people sign NDAs!!!
1314233967630053383 2020-10-08 23:59:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> NO POTUS or ANY elected official should ever be allowed to have ppl sign NDAs! America is NOT a private business &amp; they are public officials whom we ELECT &amp; PAY!! We have a right to know EVERYTHING abt them bc we need to know if they can do their jobs! MAKE IT ILLEGAL!! @JoeBiden
1314231944574574599 2020-10-08 23:51:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is trump gibberish!!!
1314231442298286080 2020-10-08 23:49:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Hello resisters!!! One of my good friend resisters is in twitter jail!!! She said “white trash” &amp; she’s white!!! 😂 Guess they don’t like that. Please give her some follows &amp; send her some love &amp; support. @trishmc1958 She is one of our great warriors!!!
1314211899060359169 2020-10-08 22:31:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio Your dear leader is an incompetent lying corrupt fool!!! He is NOT immune. Someone should tell him that he CAN get it again &amp; that he may have permanent damage to his organs.

1314211052846891008 2020-10-08 22:28:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tribelaw It must be virtual because trump DOES want to infect Biden!!!
1314210924186591234 2020-10-08 22:27:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Acosta If there were any crimes committed by Hillary, his dirty AG would already have made up false  charges &amp; indicted her. He can’t even do that because she committed NO CRIMES!!!
1314210383607947266 2020-10-08 22:25:46 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @essenviews I agree 100%. When you have to live paycheck to paycheck &amp; can’t save money even if you earn a lot more than minimum wage, you’re no longer middle class. When your adult kids w/college degrees &amp; good jobs have to live w/their parents due to college debt, you’re not middle class!!
1314209777874956288 2020-10-08 22:23:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DearAuntCrabby The #CovidIdiotInChief thinks he’s immune!!!! 😂😂 3 people I know got it TWICE in 4 months and 2 have permanent organ damage; heart &amp; kidneys. Both formerly healthy!! Chris Cuomo has lasting side effects!!!
1314208926703865859 2020-10-08 22:19:59 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RepsForBiden Yes he wants to infect Biden.
1314207283627257856 2020-10-08 22:13:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @williamlegate Look in his pockets. So he’ll do a rally which WE will pay for. He does not pay the venues or cities for the rental &amp; police expenses. He flies free. Don’t think his campaign has been paying for any rallies.
1314206825604997128 2020-10-08 22:11:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @travisakers He’s a POS!
1314206558142697472 2020-10-08 22:10:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @funder He’s got bone spurs.
1314206449640198145 2020-10-08 22:10:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Because he’s a coward bone spur man.
1314206365372432387 2020-10-08 22:09:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mdnij34 Because he cannot control the debate.

1314073558092599298 2020-10-08 13:22:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenMikeLee Pence has covid/trump virus. No doubt about it.

He was so disgusting that a FLY sat on his head for minutes ... it was an ominous sign to me ... we know where flies land. He did not look well. Hard to talk honest policy w/dummies &amp; liars!! #penceflyhead #pencepinkeye

1314037873361006593 2020-10-08 11:00:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Of course, as all Karens do, Pence’s “mother” was NOT wearing a mask!!!
1314031906258915328 2020-10-08 10:36:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence had a fly on his head for a long while because he’s a POS! The sign of the devil too!!!
1314024069684228098 2020-10-08 10:05:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SusanPage He said that he needs more than 15 seconds &amp; starts talking &amp; talking! What a piece of shit. Thank God @KamalaHarris has a lot more brains &amp; PATIENCE than I do!!!This MOFO PENCE has a 1 track mind. Again, running in with speech of lies!! You’re going to let him go on?!
1314022727976710144 2020-10-08 10:00:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence does NOT respect women!!! He is so much like Trump now they are almost 1 and the same. #shutupman
1314018163617599488 2020-10-08 09:41:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence went over by 16 seconds.
1314017397167337474 2020-10-08 09:38:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mmpadellan And I’ve paid well over $8,000 ADDITIONAL taxes for 2018-2019 since #TrumpsTaxBreakForRich

In July we’d be hopping!! It disappeared miraculously. Trump got it &amp; he’s cured! LIE! Guess what, Trump is a spreader &amp; he can get it AGAIN!! He is NOT immune!!

1314013152938520576 2020-10-08 09:22:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence is trying to say democrats want to kill Americans. 😂😂😂😂 Now he went back to a question &amp; has not answered the one posed! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1314012826411978752 2020-10-08 09:20:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence is Putin’s puppet too &amp; trump’s lap dog!!! He’s so disgusting!!!
1314012031067054081 2020-10-08 09:17:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence repeating himself. How much the people have sacrificed. It’s not because they gave us information or guidance. He trusts us to make choices!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1314011615768051713 2020-10-08 09:15:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Go @KamalaHarris !!!!
1314011279821017088 2020-10-08 09:14:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence repeating same propaganda about how “President Trump” saved hundreds of thousands of lives &amp; how they developed lots of things early &amp; more lies!!! These puppets are preprogrammed to spew the same lies over &amp; over!! His voice is shaky!!

1313993900617543680 2020-10-08 08:05:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AlxThomp Think he said he voted for Jorgensen.
1313993729712283649 2020-10-08 08:04:52 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ozzy0201 No big deal. Just lead the people to the machines but do make sure they know what they’re doing. My daughter did it at age 18 &amp; a couple of other times.
1313993447783755776 2020-10-08 08:03:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @lobo1056 I too would love to connect with as many as I can because twitter keeps limiting my follow backs due to my ratio. After vetting, I follow almost ALL my followers back &amp; I’m not following too many big accounts who will never follow me.
1313992944182013952 2020-10-08 08:01:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ClimateHuman Always YES!!!

1313963617801429002 2020-10-08 06:05:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump The people who filmed this had to have head to toe PPE! Did they?
1313962917520441344 2020-10-08 06:02:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @dgordon52 So blatant.
1313962822829776896 2020-10-08 06:02:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thedailybeast @NorthBelle4 His background should be THOROUGHLY investigated. He was either incompetent or racist.

1313940740117012482 2020-10-08 04:34:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GSierraZorita @TheRickyDavila Rosselló was a FAKE DEM &amp; never fought w/trump to get aid for Puerto Rico. This is why the people protested him &amp; forced him to resign. She replaced him-was not elected.
1313937886916554752 2020-10-08 04:22:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bluepatchouli87 @MeidasTouch Yes it did. Thank you. Hugs right back! ❤️

1313933317587296257 2020-10-08 04:04:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 Because it was probably days before the first presidential debate that he was last tested &amp; he was most likely already infected &amp; spreading it that day!!

1313917238735495170 2020-10-08 03:00:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jacobsoboroff @P4HR It does not surprise me at all! Amerikkka can’t obliterate Black Americans so they went on to the next best thing! America is a racist nation &amp; trump brought it all out to the forefront. We ALL need to unite if we want to save the SOUL of America. America was NEVER all white!!!

1313871941099556864 2020-10-08 00:00:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @eliehonig I thought we were entitled to 3 appeals only with the 3rd one not definitively heard by SCOTUS?!! Are there different laws for different folks?
1313870604924325888 2020-10-07 23:55:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @UncleOdit Racism too.
1313870499181744129 2020-10-07 23:55:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BernieSanders We, the working/middle class pay for it with our massive taxes. We should all have the same healthcare. But American GOP is intent in keeping us down any way they can!! It’s been like that for decades.
1313870101305753606 2020-10-07 23:53:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @effiedog Tainted, corrupt, owned by trump SCOTUS will not allow it.

1313475806069510144 2020-10-06 21:46:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeBiden RUN THE ADS PLEASE!!!! You must fight back hard!!!
1313475481799450627 2020-10-06 21:45:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ddale8 I knew trump would be brazen if he thinks he beat it. Not a word to the MILLIONS of family &amp; friends who lost friends &amp; family. I’m one of them. 215,096 DEAD from #COVID19 Assume each of them had 10 ppl who loved them; that’s 2,150,096 ppl who can #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VoteHimOut

1313473450175074305 2020-10-06 21:37:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AllTransLivesM1 Chris Cuomo said he has brain fog at times and that he gets depressed; that he’s not himself. I hope you get better.
1313321494127181824 2020-10-06 11:33:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mattgaetz And you will NEVER be president!!! Trump is despised by most of the world!!!

1313308130755969031 2020-10-06 10:40:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @mschlapp He got it because he does not wear a mask. Masks work but you don’t need to get into an airtight vehicle with a Covid shedder/spreader!!! @WRBethesda should be sued by those who get it from trump. He STILL has #COVID19. #TrumpIsACovidSpreader

1312925139307311104 2020-10-05 09:18:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Melania has the nerve to call @StormyDaniels a “porn hooker” when she too was a porn hooker?!?! 😂😂😂 At least Stormy earned enough to support her family on her own without having to sleep with the orange pig for free!!! Plus Stormy is naturally prettier!!

1312808433612214279 2020-10-05 01:34:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @atrupar It’s a very weird clip.
1312808043118288898 2020-10-05 01:33:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SenatorCollins Gee. Maybe they should wear masks &amp; then you wouldn’t need to be “concerned” about yourself. You’re spared so we can watch you lose your seat.
1312797398540922880 2020-10-05 00:51:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @garci32 Not me.
1312797266525270017 2020-10-05 00:50:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Yeah but he caught it &amp; so did many other of his most supportive GOP because they are science-denying #COVIDIDIOTS
1312796787917418497 2020-10-05 00:48:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SCGOP @LindseyGrahamSC So? Trump is a BROKE “Hollywood elite”. Hollywood elites have as much heart &amp; brains as WE THE PEOPLE.  We’re also how the MAJORITY thinks &amp; feels. Too bad.
1312726965376421889 2020-10-04 20:11:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IvankaTrump What work??!? He didn’t work before, why now?! Is he writing the new GOP healthcare plan? New DACA to allow them to stay? New stimulus bill?! Anti-domestic terrorism laws?! Work?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 He’s writing love letters to Putin &amp; KJU!!!
1312565173283155968 2020-10-04 09:28:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @rhowardbrowne @realDonaldTrump THEY DENY SCIENCE &amp; DO NOT WEAR MASKS!!! That’s why Trump &amp; his klan are getting #COVID19 God gave us brains so some of us could become scientists. God helps those who help themselves.
1312564556468826114 2020-10-04 09:25:51 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GovChristie That’s what happens to #COVIDIOTS

1312190240711352322 2020-10-03 08:38:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JudiciaryDems you need to make sure infected GOP do NOT come back for 14 days NOT 10 days!! Then infected need to test NEGATIVE for 3 straight days for a total of 17 days!! Do NOT bow down. This is the time to block SCOTUS confirmation hearing until after election!! DO IT!!

1312184567462150145 2020-10-03 08:15:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @politvidchannel He’ll come right back out to spew more hatred &amp; strip us of HC, SS &amp; our 1A rights. Even if he reunited all Brown babies w/their parents &amp; gave 11 million undoc green cards &amp; tore down the wall, he still killed over 200,000 &amp; his domestic terrorists killed 1,000’s more.

1312162635870158848 2020-10-03 06:48:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @OK_Dumbass @chrislhayes Tell that to their bosses. They work for all kinds of media. They too need their paychecks.
1312162459352920064 2020-10-03 06:48:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chrislhayes That’s where they got it. They should sue!!!
1312162261469806594 2020-10-03 06:47:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @chipfranklin No.
1312162205354258432 2020-10-03 06:47:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bamableu #ItIsWhatItIs Remember that Trump is willing to sacrifice our children, the elderly &amp; POC to save the stock market &amp; keep enriching himself. #IReallyDontCareDoU This will NOT humble him!!!
1312161545867071489 2020-10-03 06:44:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Redistrict Al the ads are negative because they tell/show the facts about trump. But Democrats are so kind, especially Joe who has such a loving heart, that he HAS pulled his ads. Trump won’t pull his ads though.
1312161140357517312 2020-10-03 06:42:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BogusLobster No. Trump would not do the same. Keep campaigning so that later people don’t accuse him of not reaching out to them Biden can soothe people during this crisis. TRUMP/GOP would never stop campaigning.
1312160720239300608 2020-10-03 06:41:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @jameshohmann No they won’t.
1312160675066646528 2020-10-03 06:40:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LuLuRoche @JJResists I feel same. He made us like this. He has killed over 200,000 ppl &amp; not just from Covid. If Biden was sick he would not pull his ads like Biden has-trump &amp; GOP would be praying for Biden to die. Just remember that if you feel bad. Melania thinks brown kids prefer beds to parents.
1312157281459425280 2020-10-03 06:27:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @StephenGlahn No he does not. Meanwhile @JoeBiden is taking down all the ads which show the kind of monster trump is. If the shoe was on the other foot, he &amp; GOP would be celebrating &amp; trashing Biden &amp; saying he’s too sick to be our president. They’d be praying for his death.

We can’t see our elderly parents, children &amp; grandchildren. He stole a lot of precious memories &amp; killed 207,000 ppl. No sympathy from me.

1312138797438529536 2020-10-03 05:14:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @continetti Most of us voters will DEMAND they pack the courts &amp; increase SCOTUS by 4 &amp; make many other changes &amp; laws. We will never let our guard down now. Any Dems who do not meet our demands in order to placate GOP will be replaced ASAP! Talk to young people who are already saying that.

That’s how he ran his businesses into the ground; making people do everything/anything, legal or not, rational or not, possible or not to make him look good.

We don’t know enough of how/when it spreads. No one will ever make me take my mask off!

1312086435529461767 2020-10-03 01:45:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @KayleighLies And she had no mask on. Why a new mother would put her baby at risk for Trump is why she does not care about the murders of brown babies, #BreonnaTaylor &amp; #GeorgeFloyd who had mothers who loved them. Cults only live their leader.
1312085270523711499 2020-10-03 01:41:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @marcorubio U are in NO position to threaten ANY adversary. U allowed trump to weaken America. We are laughingstock &amp; destroying ourselves. America is capable of taking care of itself without your fuhrer. It’s not like that coward would ever take up arms to defend America! #5DefermentTrump
1312084210786725889 2020-10-03 01:37:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MeleaY I’m not praying for them. I’d be a hypocrite if I did. They kidnapped/caged brown babies &amp; separated them PERMANENTLY from their mothers/fathers. Not to mention all other heinous crimes they’ve committed in America. McEnany is on FOX without a mask &amp; won’t discuss timeline.

1312054041988468738 2020-10-02 23:37:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 @ProgBeliever @MSNBC For those thinking this will make trump/Melania better ppl or humble them, do NOT hold ur breath! This will make them feel invincible. BUT u CAN get it MORE than 1 time &amp; DOES leave permanent long-term damage!! Testing does NOT prevent virus! Trump is NOT God. God is in control!!

1312048984983298048 2020-10-02 23:17:09 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @IngrahamAngle Ask them to include the 209,000 DEAD &amp; their MILLIONS of relatives &amp; friends who are heartbroken without them. God helps those who help themselves. God gave scientists BRAINS. Denying science is denying God! Did you pray for POC dying from it?!
1312048250866872321 2020-10-02 23:14:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kirkacevedo @viphires I’m with you!! And remember what she HERSELF said on those tapes about caged/separated children. She’s so materialistic she thinks they’re happier with beds &amp; drawers than their parents!! It’s not always about the MONEY!! Love matters. Families matter. #Blacklivesmatter too!!

1312046758923567112 2020-10-02 23:08:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @sharkyrae Since trump decided the military &amp; law enforcement were to blame for spreading #COVID19 Plus those women like to be groped by MAGAts. Anything for trump.

1312044734253338629 2020-10-02 23:00:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheDailyEdge Of course more are positive! NO MASKS or sanitizing is used at White House. They think testing prevents the virus. They also think most white people don’t get it &amp; die. 2 of 3 people I knew PERSONALLY who died of #COVID19 were white!! 30 in my Brown family got it; all survived!🙏🏽
1312043954997792769 2020-10-02 22:57:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TheDailyEdge Food ti the base!! I don’t see any masked leaders getting it. Trump is in the same league as Bolsonaro &amp; Boris. Putin is NOT stupid. He protects himself.

They’re stupid &amp; just accept the lies of the day. @MarkMeadows is mask less giving press conferences now bc he thinks if you test NEGATIVE, you don’t have it!!! He’s doing this for the base.
1312041552005541888 2020-10-02 22:47:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MarkMeadows comes out #Maskless to say economy is doing great! #CorruptGOP what a bunch of #COVID19 fools! Denying science is like denying GOD!! God made scientists to help us! Now they’ll try to buy us w/stimulus checks!! If I got 1 million dollars, I’d still #VoteBidenHarris

1312034586034085892 2020-10-02 22:19:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tonyposnanski To show them he’s SUPERIOR when he “survives” the virus. Then they’ll think they’re superior too. You can’t fix stupid Tony. They’ll also say a Democrat gave it to him!!!
1312034240188633088 2020-10-02 22:18:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @johnpavlovitz It’s a believable plot.
1312034121342951424 2020-10-02 22:18:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Pence should “stand back &amp; stand by”. He can pardon trump for federal crimes but not STATE crimes!! We are #NYTough &amp; coming for trump! What did trump &amp; @GOP say about Democrat-run states?😂 Thank God for @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor who followed the SCIENCE! #EnforceMaskMandateNOW 😷

You CAN get it MORE THAN ONCE!! 2 of my family did! 1 other had SEVERE kidney failure 4 months after he had it. Ppl have permanent damage/shortens lives!!!
1312026416540774401 2020-10-02 21:47:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Trump should never have been allowed to break mask mandate rules anywhere he went!!!

This is what happens when u have a corrupt, science-denying President &amp; GOP. God gave us brains to be scientists to save lives/help ourselves. I won’t believe ANYTHING coming out of WH! What will they lie &amp; falsely brag abt now?!
1312000541250248704 2020-10-02 20:04:39 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JoeNBC Yes now you want people to feel bad for trump? Pity votes? I won’t change my vote. I’m angrier at Trump now bc he got COVID for being a science-denier &amp; caring abt stock market more than our lives. He has endangered many lives! #WhiteHouseCovidPetriDish THEY WILL LIE!!!
1311938011291095040 2020-10-02 15:56:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @benshapiro If it was the other way around, you’d be jumping for joy like with #RuthBaderGinsburg &amp; #JohnLewis You know it!!!

1311827343485403136 2020-10-02 08:36:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So fake FLOTUS says “fuck” &amp; “bullshit” on tape. So much class. She learned it from trump. Those words she says clearly.

It breaks my heart when I hear it. I know what it’s supposed to signify. I know many patriots have fought in honor of our flag/anthem/country. We must make it mean something again
1311510131423748097 2020-10-01 11:35:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> People will stop kneeling during the anthem when racist cops take their killer knees off Black/Brown people. #GeorgeFloyd NBA/owners would be NOTHING without BLACK players!!! They make them rich. They should earn millions too &amp; they have a right to kneel.
1311509010995130368 2020-10-01 11:31:29 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TJLakers01 @NBA They kneel DURING bc what trump &amp; racists have done to anthem is made it seem hypocritical/meaningless. Those words are hard to hear when they are opposite of what is happening now in USA. So many are dead/suffering. Breaks MY heart but we have to make it mean something again. 🙏🏽

1311357592673845250 2020-10-01 01:29:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @realDonaldTrump #denouncewhitesupremacy Proud Boys are domestic terrorists. Democrats/Liberals/Left are also legally armed &amp; we will protect yourselves. Don’t think your thugs are tougher than the rest of us.
1311352426893643778 2020-10-01 01:09:16 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EsoOrc @JohnFeal1 @realDonaldTrump I know many democrats like you. I am not anti-guns just anti-assault weapons in the hands of civilians, good or bad ones. #BradParscale should never own another weapon. He’s a wife beater.
1311352057329311749 2020-10-01 01:07:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JohnFeal1 Yeah. Trump’s Proud Boys &amp; ALL his domestic terrorists need to know we too are legally armed, well-trained in use of arms and ready to protect our lives &amp; our democracy &amp; our country. We too have military &amp; law enforcement on our side.

1310824046192451585 2020-09-29 14:09:41 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @scfm69 Definitely they are on the ropes &amp; we need to remind them EVERY SINGLE DAY once Joe Biden is sworn in!! My adult kids are already making lists of which Dems they want to replace bc they’re too damn “nice, polite, diplomatic”. They’re sick of it. My son wants to run for office.
1310823319067918336 2020-09-29 14:06:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly Such a nice mix. My friend embraces both. She is Jewish when it suits her &amp; Puerto Rican when it suits her too. Hysterical. The way her dad joked around w/us esp as adults was hysterical. The Jewish dad died but her PR mom is still alive &amp; 80. We took her to a club at age 75.
1310822513484668928 2020-09-29 14:03:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly I know Russians love him.
1310820405972733952 2020-09-29 13:55:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly By the way, I love that mix. One of my childhood best friend’s parents had your mix in reverse (mother PR &amp; dad Jewish). They were both hilarious together w/their ethnic expressions &amp; cussing they both did. Used to love to watch them interact. Such a loving old couple.
1310819514297315329 2020-09-29 13:51:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly They love trump? Did not know that! I though it was a religious thing like how evangelicals think God will make them immune. My Jewish friends are not religious like that &amp; they despise trump.
1310818827190644736 2020-09-29 13:48:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly I think they are disrespecting the rest of us. We all live together. I worry bc when I have to return to work, I have to interact w/many of them &amp; I don’t want to be around ANYONE who does not wear masks. It’s just not right to not care about others. They should be fined.
1310818159734263808 2020-09-29 13:46:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @angie_keathly Unfortunately, in today’s environment, certain ppl need to be treated w/kid gloves. However I do know that if it were other ppl doing this, like in The Heights, no one would hesitate to intervene. As diverse as we are, POC always get treated worse than others. Not right.

Back in June I was driving thru that area. Thousands walking around without wearing any masks. Everyone else everywhere is wearing masks. I think we ALL need to have a good talk.

1310704324515901440 2020-09-29 06:13:57 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Goss30Goss He’s the perfect example of most of today’s GOP. They’re either mentally, emotionally or physically abusive. Trump is too chicken to HIT anyone.

Lasted less than 1 year &amp; if he’d not left, one of us would’ve died because I’m a fighter &amp; not afraid of ANY man!!! He legally had a gun &amp; knew I could use it. Learned my lesson!!! They NEVER change!!

1310685997982724096 2020-09-29 05:01:07 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOPLeader You really think normal people who are not #MAGAts will believe you? You’ve had 4 years, 2 of which YOU were in the majority in BOTH houses to do all that!!! Instead, you were robbing the people blind!! What a joke. You won’t get not 1 new vote!! We will #VoteOutCorruptGOP 😂😂😂
1310683728549642252 2020-09-29 04:52:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @charliekirk11 He’s NEVER been a billionaire!!! Bloomberg could bail out Trump’s debt with his petty cash. But he won’t, Thank God. Putin will take care of that debt.
1310675787125854209 2020-09-29 04:20:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @TobyBerry6325 Exactly.
1310675592254287873 2020-09-29 04:19:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @EricTrump He used it to actually PAY his bills &amp; donated 1 million to charity instead of stealing from a children’s cancer charity. Biden can shoot someone on 5th Avenue &amp; he will STILL get my vote bc I’m pro-guns (not assault weapons).
1310675029173186561 2020-09-29 04:17:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @PamKeithFL Way too many in ALL categories. If SCOTUS covers up for him, that institution is trash too.

He will create #TrumpFakeStatements We want to see #TrumpTaxReturns which he ACTUALLY filed with #IRS Melania co-signed so she’s a complicit criminal too or she will claim stupidity as her defense. 😂😂😂😂
1310644996756963330 2020-09-29 02:18:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DaxGigandet Not good. Lost favorite aunt to Trump. She’s family matriarch in that she &amp; my dad are the few left alive from their generation. My 83 yr old immigrant dad (yes he’s a freaking citizen) DESPISES trump! He got #COVID19 in April. Survived using our old homeland remedies!

1310605363478233089 2020-09-28 23:40:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @amyklobuchar We pay MORE than we should which is why $20 per hour should be the minimum wage nationwide. Even that’s not enough to support a family but it’s a start.

Won’t last long? Why? Bc u own SCOTUS? Democrats will enact so many laws for our agenda you’ll have to fight us in court for decades! We will OWN Congress &amp; WH SOON!!!!
1310010296266903552 2020-09-27 08:16:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Mocraig13 Barr had someone do it. He’s dirty. He plays Trump like a fiddle so get can continue with his evil agenda. He knew trump would blab it out!!! It’s a BS story. We will never hear another word about it.

I’m in your old Queens neighborhood David (lifelong resident) so I can’t meet up with you. Stay safe in Florida you both. My family there is following NY guidelines.
1310008536416616453 2020-09-27 08:09:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Boatoptional2 @Smilan317 I will do it. But I’m going to drag my adult kids with me to do it too. 😂

Men don’t realize women have a VERY healthy sex drive sometimes MORE than men at ANY age. It’s about being w/someone who supports us. If young women can’t get birth control, the men should wear condoms EVERY TIME to bear the burden.
1310004035395751936 2020-09-27 07:51:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Boatoptional2 @Smilan317 Ouch!!!

We SEE you @NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDShea We know you’re angry &amp; want to retaliate. Trump’s lack of aid to NYC will result in #DefundNYPD #DefundThePolice 1 bad apple too much!

However I will tell u that economy is so bad for us all &amp; middle class is so burdened w/debts (college) that MOST cannot afford to have 1 child much less 7! Starting w/medical costs &amp; not to mention CHILDCARE costs! Grandmas are working!!

We are NOT! #DefundALLPolice

They are CERTAIN that Trump will win with Putin’s help like in 2016. We must go out by the millions to hopefully override sabotaging of our votes! #BidenHarris2020

1309558302884401153 2020-09-26 02:20:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RabbiJill @RhondaJonesLevy We need to learn about &amp; respect each other’s religions when we are all in 1 place. Again, that’s just how we end our prayers.
1309557603098386435 2020-09-26 02:17:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Carmen50 @blackmangopit @sahilkapur @JstJayne @RoKhanna You need maturity &amp; education &amp; experience to be a president. You need to work your way up the political ladder.
1309557146183495684 2020-09-26 02:15:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Carmen50 @TheDickBuick @sahilkapur @JstJayne @RoKhanna Yes. The power of grift not because they want to “serve” the people. No one is THAT noble.
1309556882009403393 2020-09-26 02:14:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Carmen50 @Seasherm @sahilkapur @JstJayne @RoKhanna Exactly!! Also we have to go back to making city residency a requirement for police. Many jobs require residency in the city/town where you work including for judges. Cops move out &amp; act like city ppl they work for are all animals &amp; criminals. I’ve heard those opinions from cops.
1309556243065909249 2020-09-26 02:11:53 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @blackmangopit @Carmen50 @sahilkapur @JstJayne @RoKhanna I just say they need to keep up with the times bc if they serve for 40 years, their voters change.

Then we vote them out. They need to know we will be watching. Sadly, there’s a lot of corruption in politics. My adult kids RESEARCH now.

He was at the wedding on 8/4/20. He was married before for 1 year only in 2016-2017 to someone named Elizabeth. No reason for the divorce. New wife named Makenze Evans.

1309543816572145664 2020-09-26 01:22:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @blackmangopit @Carmen50 @sahilkapur @JstJayne @RoKhanna Right. It’s more about TERM LIMITS no matter the age. But the older politicians do need to keep up with the changing times &amp; the needs &amp; demands of their constituents.

1309522424958943233 2020-09-25 23:57:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RabbiJill @RhondaJonesLevy It’s more visceral to me to see a monster like trump show up to be near the coffin of a great woman. I respect her no matter her faith. We need to unite. My elementary school best friend went w/me to church &amp; I went to synagogue regularly. We listened respectfully &amp; said Amen.
1309521442430693377 2020-09-25 23:53:36 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RabbiJill @friendlyWendyB Hope you do understand it’s the only way we are taught how to say/end prayers &amp; show respect &amp; say good bye to our dearly departed. I was not offended, but just want you to understand it comes from our hearts.
1309520221766651908 2020-09-25 23:48:45 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @artISbreathing @geriwins @RabbiJill I respect everyone’s religion if they practice it sincerely. Fact is Christians believe in Jesus and Jews do not. No offense is meant. God loves us all &amp; we need to unite.
1309519686128865281 2020-09-25 23:46:37 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RabbiJill @geriwins It’s how we end our prayers for those alive and deceased.

1309518942914871297 2020-09-25 23:43:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RabbiJill Yes, it’s something we do at the end of a prayer. It’s how we express that we are praying for her with our own beliefs. It’s not meant as disrespect.

With all due respect, we cannot have dinosaurs serving in SCOTUS because many are set in their ways &amp; behind the times w/few exceptions like RBG &amp; Sotomayor, who are way ahead of their time. The country changes w/the times, so should SCOTUS! #RBG was 1 of a kind!

1308972951283412994 2020-09-24 11:34:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 ALL because he knows he has the Gang Of Punks (GOP) behind him &amp; every federal agency head &amp; SCOTUS. It’s a coup. Nothing we can do.
1308972470498660353 2020-09-24 11:32:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @donwinslow Do you think 100 million of us will vote blue &amp; that trump lost at least 10 million voters? 2016 election was really rigged so I don’t believe the numbers. 2020 election is definitely rigged in favor of trump too. I think we’ve been had.
1308932108174450688 2020-09-24 08:51:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jackasaurus3 I dare ANYONE to touch the genitals of any girl in my family UNDER 18!!!! For any reason!!! #GOPPerverts
1308915984774975489 2020-09-24 07:47:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CalHN @chrislhayes So ALL our mail-in ballots will disappear/be invalidated for ANY reason/not be counted/physically destroyed. This is what trump is saying! He’s very confident of a “continuation” bc he knows he, Putin &amp; GOP are rigging the election. Can’t even trust voting machines. It’s over.

1308913179695738881 2020-09-24 07:36:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Jillbiden46 If a president can question the tallying of votes &amp; ballots &amp; sue, why did @HillaryClinton not contest the 2016 race &amp; sue to see if there was any foul play?! This is a man who sues for everything to make ppl waste time &amp; money! What are the rules if he does this? @SenSchumer

We must DEMAND that govs &amp; mayors keep their racist #ThugsInBlue &amp; #TrumpsMilitiaDomesticTerrorists in check &amp; prevent them from maiming &amp; killing citizens of ALL colors who are protesting!! Should we arm ourselves too? @AndyBeshearKY You want that?!

That money will not bring back #BreonnaTaylor who should be alive today &amp; it will NOT take away the forever grief of her family, but it surely will be put to good use by the family! #FTP

The money won’t bring #BreonnaTaylorWasMurdered back to life. #Kentucky needs to #FireDanielCameron or Black people in Kentucky will continue to be murdered by racist cops. Sellouts are dangerous.

Obama should’ve done EVERYTHING by executive order. Bot no, they have to be proper &amp; diplomatic! @SpeakerPelosi TIE UP PURSE STRINGS NOW!!!
1308198098871758850 2020-09-22 08:15:06 +0800 <nanelvisfan> Next time there’s a pro-trump rally in Florida, we can now run them over w/our cars without any liability, says #DeathDeSantis new law!! Gov. Cuomo should sign law that we can do same in NYC when Boogaloo Boys, Proud Boys &amp; KKK come into our city. Works both ways.
1308183336289001472 2020-09-22 07:16:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @ScottHech @NYCMayor You need to keep NYPD in check or the people will really revolt!!! We have a right to protest wherever &amp; whenever we want. This is our city built w/our tax dollars!! We pay ALL your salaries! You work for us!! Cops are supposed to protect PERIOD!

I’ve always been an independent woman &amp; feminist. So was my beloved immigrant mother. She taught me how to fight back &amp; survive. She was a phenomenal woman. My dad also taught me to fight for my rights.

We were terrified &amp; sad but they were so supportive @PPFA They counseled on birth control. It’s something we will never forget. It was a very hard decision but it had to be that way.

1307013350904098818 2020-09-19 01:47:20 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @SOCALRE4U I’m afraid to take it. Never have because I never get the flu. But I may do it this year due to ongoing #COVID__19 Feel better.

1307001925863235584 2020-09-19 01:01:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RossBarkan @KindAndUnblind If trump would reimburse NYS from OUR massive federal taxes we pay, we’d be out of the red. If there are any cuts/layoffs in NY, it’s ALL on trump! We had plenty of money before #COVID19 GIVE US BACK AT LEAST 30 BILLION OF THE 90 BILLION we pay to support poor GOP-run RED STATES!
1307000849206403072 2020-09-19 00:57:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @johnlundin Only because he thinks he can buy votes. It’s OUR money not his!!! Give it to us!!! Still won’t vote for Trump!!!

So now we have to share. But our children need to know the history, good or bad. Slavery is 1 of the original sins of America.

1306635111044018176 2020-09-18 00:44:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @akikigate At least through end of 2021 when we can get a decent vaccine.

1306484367594643456 2020-09-17 14:45:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CricketGirlMN @AmerIndependent Me too.
1306483334298574849 2020-09-17 14:41:14 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @CricketGirlMN @AmerIndependent We should honestly think about seceding. We pay the most in federal taxes to support the entire government &amp; all the red states.
1306482859931086850 2020-09-17 14:39:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Left_in_Limbo Yes. I know 2 people who got it twice in 4 months in between testing negative, taking as many precautions as possible. One now has a “weakened heart” but was previously healthy.
1306482280790073345 2020-09-17 14:37:03 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Left_in_Limbo Exactly.
1306454439209742337 2020-09-17 12:46:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JRubinBlogger Trump needs to be PROSECUTED!!! He has committed GENOCIDE!!! At this point, I don’t care about any of his other crimes.

1306452155683893248 2020-09-17 12:37:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @neeratanden Except that Putin is not religious. He’s interested in a dictatorship not a theocracy.
1306451962490097664 2020-09-17 12:36:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Chica_LeoLatina I do too. I can’t even hear the anthem anymore. It’s all such a lie!!!
1306451710848557057 2020-09-17 12:35:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> So trump really wants herd immunity. In this the supposed richest most advanced nation in the world, the president of the United States is committing genocide &amp; no nation/United Nations, no one stands up to trump regime. It’s like when kids turn their backs on elderly parents!!!!
1306450180657430528 2020-09-17 12:29:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #TrumpWantsToInfectUS Actually he IS infecting is!!! Meantime the WH is a Petri dish.

1306446301421137920 2020-09-17 12:14:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @essenviews That’s why I will NEVER go to a Catholic Church for the rest of my Catholic life!!! They are honoring a man who defends a rapist &amp; adulterer!!! It’s proven trump is an adulterer.
1306445724654002176 2020-09-17 12:11:48 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He DID resist!!! He grabbed the cop!!! Black man would’ve been blown away for attacking a police officer!!! Disgusting!!!
1306445374538674176 2020-09-17 12:10:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> If a Black man said “you’re gonna have to drag me out”, they’d have immediately said he was resisting arrest-dragged him out. Don’t anyone tell me otherwise. They’re always afraid white ppl are important &amp; Black ppl are criminals. #DefundThePolice They don’t work for us all!
1306444258153381889 2020-09-17 12:05:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> In less than 10 seconds, he’d have been viciously thrown on the floor, tased, punches &amp; even out in a chokehold if he was a Black/Brown man!!! No doubt about it!! Here is your #WhitePrivilege on full display. He’s clearly violating mask mandate!!!
1306432073431830528 2020-09-17 11:17:33 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump The republicans ALWAYS destroy our economy, then democrat presidents have to come in to clean up the mess!! Then republicans inherit a great economy &amp; destroy it again. Meanwhile middle class take the brunt!! It’s a vicious cycle. Trump has done more damage than any other POTUS!!

1306366730202001408 2020-09-17 06:57:54 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @AmerIndependent Definitely sure that several red states have surpassed NY in cases &amp; deaths but they’re not reporting it. NYC was hit hard because, like LA, we are a main international travel hub. Thank God Our @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor followed the science once they realized Trump would NOT help!
1306363839571656704 2020-09-17 06:46:25 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kaitlancollins But he’ll figure out a way to get his cut! The new owner will kick back millions to trump’s campaign which he will then pocket.

However, having an accent does not excuse  not speaking the language well if you’ve been speaking that language daily for over 20 years. If u have money &amp; time, like Melania, u can also afford tutors to perfect how u speak it even if you have an accent.

Racists bombing a Black church killing 4 little girls; cops beating on 80 year olds protesting for voting rights. Trump is the new Wallace. He has thrown Brown ppl into the mix. TIME TO UNITE!!

Yet many of their cheating husbands pay for mistresses’ abortions or have kids w/them which wives won’t acknowledge. Their kids have abortions too bc they’re not taught to use birth control.

Of course, if the shooter is Black, he won’t be treated like #kylerittenhouseisamurderer Praying they will heal.

1305252484387082240 2020-09-14 05:10:17 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Roseymelhill @EspeOppenheimer Most likely, trump is too stupid to know that. He thinks he can charm people. 😂😂😂😂
1305252273837297665 2020-09-14 05:09:27 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BrianM13912759 @seanhannity How he can say this with a straight face is incredible!!! His father’s racist rallies are NOT for young ears with the shit which comes out of trump’s mouth.
1305251540505178113 2020-09-14 05:06:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @msanonymousme You got a follow just for this tweet.

1305251416685137921 2020-09-14 05:06:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @JohnCornyn That’s because Republicans are spreading the virus. Won’t open my door to a GOP. As for our Democrats, I get many many calls &amp; daily text messages from them, in the comfort of my home. Spoke to a democrat volunteer TODAY. We know where #BidenHarris are all the time &amp; we donate!!!
1305250672267399169 2020-09-14 05:03:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Stop_Trump20 I will be praying for your daughter &amp; for the rest of the family. Hang in there! God bless you all!!! ❤️

1305217456043175937 2020-09-14 02:51:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> #AmericaWakeUp Arresting reporters is not a good thing!! @JoyAnnReid @maddow @Lawrence @andersoncooper @donlemon @ChrisCuomo
1305216379029721091 2020-09-14 02:46:49 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MarcusNannini Is this why he’s bringing back our troops?
1305195304464068609 2020-09-14 01:23:04 +0800 <nanelvisfan> The guy in the green shirt &amp; the guy in the red shirt were ASSAULTING students!!! If those were my kids, I’d have them arrested. Campus cops did a good job by not attacking the students.
1305177269858598914 2020-09-14 00:11:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kingsrush @achapsss Me too!!! Nothing worse than denying your heritage. Glad my adult kids embrace their 2 true heritages. They are still patriotic Americans too.

1305175441339285504 2020-09-14 00:04:08 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MeidasTouch We are outraged.
1305175299018182656 2020-09-14 00:03:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @thebr0keb0i I think he enjoyed services of young women connected to Epstein. Strange how he committed “suicide” soon after Barr’s visit to jail. Anyone know what happened to 2 jail guards? Bills paid?#EpsteinDidNotKillHimself Hope #GhislaineMaxwell has 24/7 security which can’t be bought!
1305173939749085184 2020-09-13 23:58:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Dknight10k We might be tied.
1305173880139657222 2020-09-13 23:57:56 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @kylegriffin1 To make sure stock market did not crash.
1305173777601490945 2020-09-13 23:57:32 +0800 <nanelvisfan> I do not see any Black or Brown faces. Wonder if there are any Asian, gay, Jewish, Muslim, atheists people in that crowd?
1305172781999497217 2020-09-13 23:53:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BCOOL333 I despise him without a doubt.

1305153817386811398 2020-09-13 22:38:13 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Out5p0ken @MikeBloomberg Been telling everyone he’s working quietly behind the scenes for Biden &amp; other Democrats. He’s a good man &amp; REAL billionaire. God bless Bloomberg.
1305153053402820609 2020-09-13 22:35:11 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @RKJ65 Nope.
1305152859063955456 2020-09-13 22:34:24 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @GeorgeTakei I despise people who hide behind religion &amp; judge people. God made us all just the way we are &amp; loves us all.
1305151961734545410 2020-09-13 22:30:50 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WFCChurch Religious people need to stop judging. Only God can judge us.
1305151488394752000 2020-09-13 22:28:58 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @robertjdenault Which is why #DeathSantis won!!
1305150261753716744 2020-09-13 22:24:05 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is the tweet @WeVillagePeople sent out in February  https://t.co/vMqENyO62t
1305150108280016896 2020-09-13 22:23:28 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WeVillagePeople Trump uses your song all the time. Maybe it’s time to #TakeAKnee or you will lose your Democrat fans. You can’t play both sides in this chaos! All trump brings is death &amp; does NOT protect the rights of #LGBTQIA He hates you as much as he hates POC/Brown immigrants.
1304995094051905536 2020-09-13 12:07:30 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime He’s under audit. When his audits are finished in about 10 years, he’ll release them.
1304987731135803393 2020-09-13 11:38:15 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DUNROVIN15 @gobidad11 And genocide.

1304986463273181184 2020-09-13 11:33:12 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @joelockhart Nope. Can’t blame them. Mexico is still letting us in because their president is a trump sycophant &amp; he too does not care about his citizens getting #Covid19
1304985515360477187 2020-09-13 11:29:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @BazintheCity She’ll wait to write a book to make money; when it’s too late though.
1304981018978537472 2020-09-13 11:11:34 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @NYCMayor We city taxpayers who pay NYPD are sick of police brutality. Hope trump does not reimburse you for #COVID19 expense so you can start to #DefundNYPD We don’t need anymore abusive/racist cops. This will cost us a cool $100,000 in a lawsuit. Broke his arm. @AttorneyCrump

1304978953141182465 2020-09-13 11:03:22 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @MysterySolvent He no longer salutes. He thinks they’re his servants.
1304978527419330561 2020-09-13 11:01:40 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @DWUhlfelderLaw They look like a bunch of lunatics. It really is a cult when you’re running to get in to see a politician.
1304976241720688640 2020-09-13 10:52:35 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @fake_biden @NekulturnyTrump Good. This should be called a gang attack.

1304969590322139138 2020-09-13 10:26:10 +0800 <nanelvisfan> She contaminated the counter. These people don’t get paid enough to put up with these #COVIDIDIOTS She should be arrested! Where are cops when hardworking citizens who pay them are harassed? At a local KKK meeting?!
1304968802522869760 2020-09-13 10:23:02 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime When is trump releasing his?

1304964494347636737 2020-09-13 10:05:55 +0800 <nanelvisfan> This is why our children hate the police. They terrorize &amp; attack. This is why we have to have “the talk”!!! I want to know what he did!! I saw the chokehold!! Then they’ll go out on disability because they bruised THEMSELVES with those kidney punches.

1304959824455753728 2020-09-13 09:47:21 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @educated_educ8r Of course!!!!
1304900672878411778 2020-09-13 05:52:18 +0800 <nanelvisfan> He should be charged with reckless endangerment. We need more legally armed POC militia. He’d pee in his pants if one was aimed at him.

1304831572533800962 2020-09-13 01:17:44 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Emolclause “Make America Great Again” was a way of saying “Make America WHITE Again”!! Problem is, it was never ALL white &amp; good thing is it will NEVER be ALL White!! White ppl came here to pillage/rape/kill/destroy culture/oppress &amp; brought Black slaves to do work they were too lazy to do.

1303759004074741761 2020-09-10 02:15:43 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @tedcruz I think you should also learn to read.

We’re NOT asking for charity. It is OUR money NOT yours! ALL OR NOTHING! @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer STAND YOUR GROUND!!
1303704913281798144 2020-09-09 22:40:47 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @bamableu Because Barr said so &amp; GOP Congress is complicit.

I’ve had many close calls. Don’t know what the solution is

Many benefitted from America’s socialism but they’ve forgotten that. They’re also ashamed of their heritage. Also, Latinos CAN be racists too. Met many like that.

They were not that busy. 2 precincts not far away. Is this payback for #DefundNYPD? Blame trump when we can’t hire new cops or pay OT. Meanwhile tons getting tickets!

Meanwhile he’ll be spending the weekend denying he said what he SAID about the military &amp; golfing. The GOP created a monster &amp; now they cannot control him. He can break any laws &amp; DOJ-Barr will protect him.

You know, Putin kept traveling all over the place (Trump legitimized him) meeting w/leaders as if he’s a REAL president (he’s a dictator) &amp; 1 of his last trips was to China.

1301958065655250945 2020-09-05 02:59:26 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @WalshFreedom Most who speak truth abt trump are cowards. They want to be anonymous. He’s on video offending McCain &amp; Gold Star Family. He also got 5 deferments. He also told Jr. not to join military &amp; had child support clause for Tiffany that payments would stop. NO TRUMP HAS EVER SERVED!!!

1301920616317153281 2020-09-05 00:30:38 +0800 <nanelvisfan> @Smilan317 Trump thinks our military does not keep in touch DAILY w/their family/friends. He thinks by gutting Stars &amp; Stripes he’s cutting them off from knowing what’s really going on. Typical dictator move. Now is the time where our military has to be kept informed of current events!!

We have not dealt w/political corruption esp. within GOP. Money/power is all they want. This is why we are here with trump. We also need to deal w/poverty (low wages), racism (esp in LE), healthcare &amp; taxing the rich.
