1341359103268986883 2020-12-22 20:25:06 +0800 <sojoman4> @megtirrell When California resists the Federal government by filing lawsuit after lawsuit in support of illegals, media doesn't complain. Why can California do what it wants, but not Texas? Am I missing something here?
1341358678587273219 2020-12-22 20:23:24 +0800 <sojoman4> @morvobo @cathrillseekers @megtirrell Exactly, Liberal media is distorting message, since it supports the narrative that illegal aliens (aka Essential workers) are most vulnerable, compared to elderly US citizens.
1341358293139111937 2020-12-22 20:21:52 +0800 <sojoman4> @megtirrell Liberal media supports Fed Government only when it supports their agenda; eg - That "essential workers" aka illegal aliens receive COVID vaccine before elderly citizens. Thumbs up Texas.

1335334832633626624 2020-12-06 05:26:48 +0800 <sojoman4> @MarshaBlackburn When the Mayor of San Jose and Police Chief finally complain, and stand up to the county, you know it is REALLY bad. Probably people are leaving in droves, and they are losing their tax base, including many corporations.

1335333668512993283 2020-12-06 05:22:10 +0800 <sojoman4> @Samhain1966 @MarshaBlackburn So your thought is that we should allow more in? Mexico is one of the the most violent countries in the world. As you point out, we already have enough to deal with, without the additional violence from the illegals.
1335333192417431552 2020-12-06 05:20:17 +0800 <sojoman4> @MarshaBlackburn Democrats treat illegals like animals; they assume that it is natural for illegal aliens to commit these crimes and that they can be swept under the rug.
1335332935902195714 2020-12-06 05:19:15 +0800 <sojoman4> @MarshaBlackburn Democrats love to control US citizens and take away rights, such as Freedom of Speech, and the 2nd amendment. However, when illegals commit violent crimes, they are afforded the best lawyers and protections that citizens cannot even buy.

1332919651148304386 2020-11-29 13:29:43 +0800 <sojoman4> @shannonrwatts Keegan is an "Irish" name, as is the Police Chief's. Back in the day, the Irish faced much racism and fought against it. However now it is different, and the Police Chief is downplaying it in hopes that Ashland won't turn into Minneapolis.
1332484129527480321 2020-11-28 08:39:07 +0800 <sojoman4> @sliccardo Meanwhile Newsom let prisoners across the state cash in on hundreds of millions of dollars of PUA/unemployment because criminals have more rights than citizens. Jerry Brown the clown started this mess and Newsom is keeping it up.

1322825936341905411 2020-11-01 17:00:54 +0800 <sojoman4> @voxdotcom Problem is more people, especially youths will get addicted and stay addicted since a small amount is considered "legal". Cocaine and heroin are not MJ. They can cause their users to become violent and cause severe health issues. Oregon is NOT Europe.

1316543078082113536 2020-10-15 08:55:04 +0800 <sojoman4> @FAIRImmigration @ABC7Chicago I feel sorry for the citizens that are still left in Illinois that have to fight with illegals for limited Medical resources. Imagine a kidney going to an illegal, instead of a citizen.

1316541177168977920 2020-10-15 08:47:31 +0800 <sojoman4> @FAIRImmigration @ABC7Chicago They steal SSNs to use for tax withholding and pay only sales tax. Rewarding ID theft with this racket will make the price of healthcare in Illinois and other Democrat controlled states like California go bankrupt. They always low ball the numbers.

1315868601224585223 2020-10-13 12:14:56 +0800 <sojoman4> @AGBecerra But it pays big bucks for illegal aliens to enter this country by circumventing Federal immigration law. How quaint.

1310963214939688960 2020-09-29 23:22:41 +0800 <sojoman4> @RepJudyChu Many illegal aliens pay "taxes" using fake/stolen SSNs. We have to pay for their healthcare, schooling, housing, food stamps, among other things. If we don't, it would be considered discriminatory.
