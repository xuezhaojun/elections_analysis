1340444774063628292 2020-12-20 07:51:53 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 I read more contagious, not more deadly. Britain's medical research is sophisticated. Global travel will bring the new strain here in weeks, for sure.
1340443951795482625 2020-12-20 07:48:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @markh1797 That 70% more contagious is from Oxford in Britain, the CDC is defunct and useless - see how well they have managed their primary function this year? Discover and contain emerging diseases and epidemics?
1340442911264092160 2020-12-20 07:44:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @realLesHoy Are you saying the MSM is hyping the covid fears? ü§£ü§£
1340438711763431424 2020-12-20 07:27:47 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @realLesHoy Only people who have had a bad case or are personally acquainted with someone who has had a bad case, or front line workers who see the worst cases, believe the Covid virus is bad.

Also, COVID, if there is a positive test, moves the DRG. It gives all diagnoses more weight for enhanced reimbursement. Some stats are coming from the insurance companies.

1340396159551070208 2020-12-20 04:38:42 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @cymoo1 The stats for flu get no press. I know a person who had both A&amp;B and Covid at the same time but only the Covid was published in the stats. Like many Corona and flu strains, there is mutation - usually less virulent.

1332412998074425345 2020-11-28 03:56:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Being alone does not mean lonely...it is putting yourself first for a while. It is reducing conflict and emotional drain to a minimum. Bliss for some.
1332411460954304512 2020-11-28 03:50:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Now or never. Without major changes, there will be no honest elections.
1332409726882222081 2020-11-28 03:43:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Hand-outs and government gimme charity is random and pot luck. A job where you work every day is sure. The turtle wins the race, not the hare.
1332408198268121090 2020-11-28 03:37:24 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We better go to strictly authorized absentee ballots and in-person paper ballots -no machines- to ensure election integrity - or we will always be a banana republic going forward.

1331708425890385923 2020-11-26 05:16:45 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> My great hero General Flynn is finally free! Pardoned by my hero President Donald Trump! Happy Thanksgiving @GenFlynn !!! Thank you @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/rckLrDB4Bx

1331701510552555526 2020-11-26 04:49:16 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Because BO is back for his third term! Albatros that he is. .. Obama lives almost next door to the WH &amp; he will be at "work" every day. God help us if we can't turn the election around!
1331698547419471874 2020-11-26 04:37:30 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Yes, I had grief over the election, shock, and disbelief that it was not an indisputable, overwhelming landslide for Trump - that massive cheating nationwide happened with impunity. It has taken me 3 weeks to get past that.
1331695805082767373 2020-11-26 04:26:36 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @EngOnDemand It is as spoken. Next fight Georgia Senate race &amp; opposition to every word of every policy the liberals want to shove down my throat. I will NOT stop fighting for my country!
1331693784132939777 2020-11-26 04:18:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am back. I worked through my grief. It was aggravated burglary, grand larceny. Should I be miserable that my prize possession was stolen or can I be OK and move on? #NextFightPlease

1330943591246663684 2020-11-24 02:37:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> If you missed Levin last night, watch now, the whole show. Be prepared to feel at a gut level...this is the bottom line.  https://t.co/vGNHlTNbaJ
1330939677600321537 2020-11-24 02:22:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> So Biden announces gun confiscation today and $200 fines, taxes on gun owners, for your first SCOTUS fight, and he says it will be by executive order. Donate and/or vote for Perdue &amp; Loeffler!

1328176172434382848 2020-11-16 11:20:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Yeah, and I remember all the things Stealth Sessions was doing when he was not doing a damn thing! I am not setting my heart on rumors &amp; innuendos. Cuffs, overturned ballot counts, Biden concedes...seeing is believing.
1328169965791416320 2020-11-16 10:56:10 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I will never accept Biden as POTUS - it is a never-event, an utter impossibility.

America is being irreparably screwed - no good can come from liberal rule. Having gained in the house and keeping the senate &amp; SCOTUS is the only redeeming value.
1324834910478213123 2020-11-07 06:03:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Our nation is bitterly divided and has been true for far longer than the Trump presidency. That will NOT change with this election. I will never unify with Biden.

1324821666309001220 2020-11-07 05:11:13 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @quantum7ock2 @FuctupMike Trump is facing far more than any one of his supporters. Give him a break.
1324818722662567940 2020-11-07 04:59:32 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am losing followers for some of the same reasons. No one loves Trump more than I do or has put in more campaign time on Twitter for him. I am, however, a realist that is strong enough to face the raw truth when it comes time IF it comes to that. Georgia is red.
1324804852623515648 2020-11-07 04:04:25 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In my opinion, more than any segment of our population, military absentee ballots should be counted FIRST, in every state. RED FRIDAY!  https://t.co/33oWRxDvDN
1324802346090700800 2020-11-07 03:54:27 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In-person votes, early or on election day and requested absentee ballots arriving on or before the election, are legal ballots. The poop piles start getting high with so-called ‚Äùmail-in‚Äù ballots; this is where a large, evil swamp creature lives.

1324488305333948417 2020-11-06 07:06:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Real journalists, objective truth-tellers. If Trump has learned anything, he knows the news today is FAKE. There is a market for trusted news.

1324460981754482689 2020-11-06 05:18:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @ThomasPfeifer20 A tiny number of liberal cities, densely populated, are in control of a state that is predominately red. PA is a perfect example: 61 red counties with only 6 liberal blue counties.

1324448490399895553 2020-11-06 04:28:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> The electoral college was established to prevent a few states from determining the future of the country.

1324433319715622914 2020-11-06 03:28:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Can we at least defeat Piglosi as a speaker? Damn, I am tired of that loony hag?
1324419367614976005 2020-11-06 02:32:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Tom72415976 Mind reading. Looking at a ballot that is not certain and determining what the voter intended with the vote. Uncertain votes should not be counted. Florida in 2000 coined that concept.
1324414390825832452 2020-11-06 02:12:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Trump is a fighter that hates to lose &amp; we love him for that! Don‚Äôt be surprised if, win or lose, he will be swinging to the death - to the last drop of blood, to the last bullet...

1316774359785263107 2020-10-16 00:14:06 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> It is beyond comprehension how a woman can speak so casually about the murder of a baby. SMH

1316768428556984320 2020-10-15 23:50:32 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Some trends are an insult to one‚Äôs intelligence.
1316767893279977472 2020-10-15 23:48:24 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> It is a four-day political campaign endeavor...

1316765577805955073 2020-10-15 23:39:12 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @garyrowland1955 Yeah. I am voting Oct 21 in early voting to let the lines decrease and to get two other tasks done scheduled that day. When I go to town for anything, I make it count.
1316760260040953859 2020-10-15 23:18:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are being infringed by SM to influence the election in favor of Biden. This close to the election, should someone not file an emergency injunction?
1316755500294459402 2020-10-15 22:59:10 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> He cannot draw a crowd and thus seldom announces more than a city without a specific location other than to his staff and a few press staff.
1316753658437079040 2020-10-15 22:51:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Nancy, there are dead-ends in Biden‚Äôs neurocircuitry and one dead-end is the word ‚ÄùSenator,‚Äù stuck at one major intersection &amp; cannot move forward to POTUS.
1316745859745353729 2020-10-15 22:20:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I have no clue about pipes used for anything. I thought good pipes were related to vocal cords.
1316744936679788546 2020-10-15 22:17:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Socialist- democrats  already said they would vote no before ACB was named and no to everyone on the list Trump submitted to the American people.

1316738740379844619 2020-10-15 21:52:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> The reckoning today - Will the fireworks will be lit? This is witness day in the ACB hearing - if it gets contentious or dirty, it will be today.

1301297513312419840 2020-09-03 07:14:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> So Trump goes to Kenosha to see the damage and hear the LEO‚Äôs and businesses views on what happened, the strategies used, and to let them know he will help them. Then Biden gets a novel idea to go to Kenosha...copy cat with no ideas of his own &amp; no ability to do anything to help.

1300963936314023936 2020-09-02 09:09:07 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MtMama1776 You could be partly right depending on where the aneurysms were located. The frontal lobe would explain a few things.

1300961435175063554 2020-09-02 08:59:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @ThreatMoral @RebelSister81 I am not sure about that. A history of brain Aneurysms usually is a contraindication for using anti-coagulants... Maybe if they can say with certainty he will never have another?
