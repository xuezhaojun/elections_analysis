I call this nothing more then a power grab. It also tells me she has no morals or intergity. So she should not be confirmed.

1300712564503056384 2020-09-01 16:30:16 +0800 <cookgirl63> I have always believed Trump is a Russian agent. And nobody can tell me he is not. Look at his action since 2016 asking for help. Meeting in private with no-one else there. He sold out our Country for himself.
