1342667919331880962 2020-12-26 11:05:52 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @nosqttrsinthewh Yes. I think focus is the key word. I have no control over what I think, what I feel or what I believe. I can control them no more than I can control the leaves that fall from a tree. I can only control what I choose to keep. And this choice affects everything else.  https://t.co/E2tL9ZCJh4

1342539529723514881 2020-12-26 02:35:41 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @emcee51 I heard someone asked how they survived. They said, “ I don’t know. I didn’t mean to. I was just putting one foot in front of the other.” “ I was just doing what had to be done.” “And one day I laughed over something stupid. I was surprised to find I was still alive and back.”

1341960631696687104 2020-12-24 12:15:21 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @assiduousrabbit That’s alright somehow. God bless the people who go all out with decorations. I was one and love them. But this year it’s ok somehow to just listen to the music and regain our strength.  https://t.co/iZNn9Adbrf

1341924495859310592 2020-12-24 09:51:46 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LisaIndianagirl Same. Without laugher I would die. I remember an entertainer once say he fought no battles and never did anything truly worth while in his life. I said his laugh was what kept some us alive.

1341919514456432640 2020-12-24 09:31:58 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @traciloopalata I’ve seen some of it as I drive by.  Mixed feelings. I understand. And yet...
1341919216614699008 2020-12-24 09:30:47 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @MCEA1969 @littlepagelc Maybe that’s it. I stripped all down to what is the most important to me.
1341918824308887553 2020-12-24 09:29:14 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LeeAnnaCornwal1 I remember when my daughter and son were so proud of their  Halloween decorations some staid up until the day before Christmas. And I said that’s enough. Santa and witch might be a little hard to digest if Christmas Eve. 😂 I might have been wrong on this one. It was funny.

1341917759534456832 2020-12-24 09:25:00 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @traciloopalata Yet. Somehow I am seeing the beauty of Christmas.
1341917524103987200 2020-12-24 09:24:04 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @traciloopalata I’m curious what it was like. I spent very little time in any store.
1341916930605776896 2020-12-24 09:21:42 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LisaIndianagirl I think I can understand a little. I can put on a happy face and be genuine about it.  But not for long periods of time.  After too long it starts to hurt in a way I can’t explain. Less is more.
1341916329419403266 2020-12-24 09:19:19 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @rusty_katt Usually Christmas is a heck time if not stop gatherings and food everywhere. It’s fun but exhausting.   This year it was quite. And I was just watching the Bethlehem star. I was thinking about what was happening in space. And somehow I felt ok.  https://t.co/nDB1yy8N1E
1341915460468617217 2020-12-24 09:15:52 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @littlepagelc Yes. The past present and future are feel mixed in a quiet acceptance. But it’s ok.  And if we can keep that crazy orangutan from running things better days are ahead.
1341913955757924353 2020-12-24 09:09:53 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Usually my house has lights too to bottom.  It took me about two hours to do Christmas this year gifts and all. No decorations and gift cards.  But it’s ok. Somehow I feel the spirit. It’s ... just different this year. ( And I’m lazy. 🤫)

I lost my dreams in 2020. I lost hope.  Without overstatement I lost far more than if I would have lost a right arm.  Part of me died in 2020.  ...Recovering.  https://t.co/egiKG7YEcZ

1335086143877115906 2020-12-05 12:58:36 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @realDonaldTrump Trump was one of the few Republicans who lost the election. And he lost by a landslide of 8 million votes. So why does the GOP fall for the con they can not live with this crazy man?  https://t.co/1Cxejhbn6U

1334915483955499015 2020-12-05 01:40:27 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @sawashington Yes. They were educated and aware of the virus. They were careless just one time. In a  small gathering where everyone was usually careful. So they thought they were safe. Once was all it took. How insane is this? Just once and virus was there and waiting for a chance to spread.
1334914315179192324 2020-12-05 01:35:48 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Wear a mask.  Be careful. Being careful 99% of the time is not enough. My cousin and his wife were only careless once. Just once in a small gathering. If everyone did not drop their guard just once and everyone wore masks he would be alive today.  https://t.co/sOfcOUACkB
1334912733599444995 2020-12-05 01:29:31 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @michb578 I’m sorry you understand. Yes. Cousins are special. We grew up together. From stupid things like childhood pissing contests to tragedies he was always there even when miles separated us. From as far back as I can remember he was always there. And it felt as if he always would be.
1334911277437751297 2020-12-05 01:23:44 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @bireeves95 I had to laugh a little at this.  All I could get out of my mouth at first were cuss words.

1334908058900844544 2020-12-05 01:10:57 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @cndchicksrock Yes. This is another aspect of covid. People are delaying yearly physicals and going to the Doctor. People are losing jobs and health care. Add all of this on the death toll and Covid is killing more than the numbers suggest.
1334906231539064832 2020-12-05 01:03:41 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @SMSass0 What I did not understand before is how quickly this can happen. Other family members and friends have come down with Covid. They were either only sick for a few days or slowly recovered after the hospital.  This was so sudden. We didn’t understand how fast this can be.

1334891959241089026 2020-12-05 00:06:58 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> The staggering thing about death is that it is so final. With life there  is always something to say. There is always something one can do. With death all of this is gone forever. You can’t even call just to say hi. That is what hurts.  It just feels so empty.  https://t.co/2T9J1lb24J

1332383307972161536 2020-11-28 01:58:29 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LogicSnse @realDonaldTrump Ok fine. I can live with this. But Trump’s tweet says more than not conceding an election. Trump flat out said  he intends stop an elected President from entering the White House. He is clearly saying he will or is committing  open treason  to to stop an elected President.  https://t.co/94ICBsHM0e
1332382011911237632 2020-11-28 01:53:20 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LogicSnse @realDonaldTrump The GOP must clarify Trump’s position on this tweet. Is Trump saying he intends to prevent a lawfully elected President from entering the White House?  If so, how does Trump intent to do this?  Violence? Create a reason or excuse for Marshall law? Treason? Clarify.  https://t.co/yfi1sv7YhM

1332375532130983936 2020-11-28 01:27:35 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @realDonaldTrump This tweet demands a clarification. There is nothing in the Constitution saying a President has to like or concede an election.  Is he saying he will not honor an election and try to take over the government by force or other methods?

He fell in love with her many times. “But we did have an affair. People didn’t do things like this then.” Obviously he was wrong about this. But it shows his character.

1330019711921348614 2020-11-21 13:26:24 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @oldsoulostrich @MiaDM18 My understanding is 10 or 40 mg of melatonin will not work any better than 0.3 or 1.0 mg. What more will do overwhelm the brains understanding of what is happening and create strange dreams or a sluggish feeling the next day.  https://t.co/AExB19Gzsr

There are absolutely zero, none, not a single circumstance I would ever allow a 15 year old unaccompanied in my home without her parents fully aware of it.
1320159828740886534 2020-10-25 08:26:45 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @MHornsby16 The important take away is how easily Republicans can be flattered and manipulated.  I’m 63 and in ok shape.

It’s part of my roll and part of the fun.  I was absolutely stunned by the stupidity of Ruddy Giuliani. It was funny and well done. 🤫 Keep my secret. 😉

1316939862012997633 2020-10-16 11:11:45 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @lwgowin A young lady was living a life worse than death. She was broken.

And somehow, regained her innocence stolen.  https://t.co/2pCfXDGHXY

I had to get completely out of myself to the point I didn’t exist in a way to feel happy.  It was all about seeing the miracle in this young ladies eyes.  https://t.co/ji4DpASwS0

Voting for freedom for everyone is a vote for my best interest. Who the hell wants to live in a country like this? I would not last long. I love freedom for everyone too much

But after this administration attacked the FBI, our justice system, manipulated our police and killed so many how would I feel if Barr died a long painful death from Covid 19?  Justice served.
1314791694920019968 2020-10-10 12:55:42 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @PKIsaac1 @Julius_Kim I think I despise Barr more than Trump, Pence and all of the Post GOP together.  Trump and Pence admitted, even boasted they were desperate con men. Barr was an office of the court who took an oath. Out of all he deserves prison and hell the most. He need to be tried for treason.  https://t.co/N9niP594vI

1314061352026152960 2020-10-08 12:33:35 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Jeanne_Mann @LindseyGrahamSC Absolutely agree. Democrats will reduce abortion, Republicans increase it. They know. They don’t care about abortion. They will increase abortion ten fold while saying they are against it. For politics.  https://t.co/y5Uad32ne2

Abstinence is the fastest way to get pregnant. Birth control  or abortion. Don’t you dare tell me you want to end abortion when you say you want to take away birth control.  https://t.co/uP8iZsa8OD

1314038056475820032 2020-10-08 11:01:00 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> I confess. I would have gone straight for the jugular and not let up until he learned a powerful lesson. Democrats are right.

1314032250028261377 2020-10-08 10:37:56 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Pence would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power.  This was the most important thing discussed
1314031402434940934 2020-10-08 10:34:34 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Barbara97311284 @green_cissy Yes .  And when he was getting run out of town he was suddenly saved.  Praise Jesus.🙄
1314030218152235010 2020-10-08 10:29:52 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> One thing is for sure. Pence has given up plausible deniability.   He may regret this.
1314029877255983108 2020-10-08 10:28:30 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Oh fuck. Is he kidding?
1314027875134320641 2020-10-08 10:20:33 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> I listen to the right radio. I know exactly what Pence is doing.  He is going for sound the sound bites they will play tomorrow.  Zero interest in the truth.
1314025244638806016 2020-10-08 10:10:06 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> WTF?
1314024701010771968 2020-10-08 10:07:56 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> They don’t care about abortion. They never did. If they really wanted to reduce abortion they would fund Planned Parenthood and promote birth control.
1314023535879368704 2020-10-08 10:03:18 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Sad America people do not want better. But this apparently is what many want.

1314022480533753856 2020-10-08 09:59:07 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Pence is playing to the ignorant and his base that he can get away lying. He knows his audience.  https://t.co/YJi6YiOfxE
1314021540464386049 2020-10-08 09:55:23 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> With his base, lies is what they want. And it’s what they get.
1314021393433067520 2020-10-08 09:54:48 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Just like Trump he is playing to his base that would support him if he shot their grandmother on Main Street
1314021328169693184 2020-10-08 09:54:32 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> He is not even trying to have a serious debate. Just like Trump he is playing to his base that would support him if he shot their grandmother on Main Street
1314020756427345926 2020-10-08 09:52:16 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> He could win the best lair contest on a western cattle drive.
1314019433871015936 2020-10-08 09:47:00 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> He is great at canned speeches. But not at discussions.
1314018816976879619 2020-10-08 09:44:33 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @27Cowboys27 He is a one trick phony pony. But he is good at his one trick.
1314017853830574080 2020-10-08 09:40:44 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Pence was holding his own. But now he is into just outright doublespeak  lying and outer space.  This is his power, and his weakness.

1314016410637684742 2020-10-08 09:35:00 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> They are both holding on in their own way. But Pence is just giving speeches.
1314016053878558720 2020-10-08 09:33:35 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Now pence is outright lying.  He is playing to his base.
1314015003184443393 2020-10-08 09:29:24 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Fuck. Pence getting away with giving speech’s, not answering anything
1314014495682031616 2020-10-08 09:27:23 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @mauvesdeep I think Trump makes up on the fly. Pence could not have a genuine spontaneous moment if his life depends on it.

1314012765124780034 2020-10-08 09:20:31 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @ScottSanbeg Harris is answering. Pence is doing the old politician , “Ignore  the question and give a speech.”

1313720656303927297 2020-10-07 13:59:46 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LinkedHD With all the medical care Donny had I was a little surprised it hit him as hard as it did.  And Donny knew how to breath naturally before the virus hit him. Barr does not.
1313718623928713216 2020-10-07 13:51:42 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LinkedHD I guess I am basing this on Barr does not know how to breathe already.  His breaths are shallow and tense. A virus attacking his lungs would put him on almost constant oxygen to survive.
1313717763270205440 2020-10-07 13:48:17 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @LinkedHD I’m just guessing. A gut feeling. Even with the best medical care if this thing hits Barr hard it may not kill him, but he will never be the same. He will be out of the game for a while.

1312068126587138050 2020-10-03 00:33:13 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @VoLinxx Yes.  All with the last two months.
1312067259226116096 2020-10-03 00:29:46 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @BoomerHarz @AmbassadorRice I thought so also. I was seeing some parody clips that were so similar I starred to wonder.
1312066805402406919 2020-10-03 00:27:58 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> I can’t pretend a feeling of wishing Trump well that I do not feel. I hope he gets sick as a dog and then makes a full recovery. I think this scenario will safe thousands of lives.

It would be good if he became sick enough that he can not laugh this off anymore. This would save perhaps a hundred thousand lives or more. But I don’t want him to die.

Tolstoy wrote of a soldier who drown him self to gain a nod of approval from Napoleon. The man needed to feel important. Napoleon looked from a safe distance and thought the man was a fool.  https://t.co/qMYpQbZQln

I am just trying to look all the possibilities and consequences.  I know from experience a man who thinks he has nothing to lose is the most unpredictable and dangerous animal on the planet.

In poker, life and even prison control one learns to never take the last thing a person has. Even if they are the most terrible person who ever existed.

Biden has never once said he supports the idea of defunding the Police. I support our Police, truth and justice and Joe Biden.  https://t.co/gdTEt9ykDf

This is for the false claim he will not be the first President to refuse to accept the results of an election.  He is obviously going to try for this.  https://t.co/C0YoKGq2yx

It may be taking care of an abandoned dog, saying a kind word to someone, taking out the neighbor’s trash. The one thing that if we don’t do it, will be left undone. It wasn’t the job, it wasn’t the big things This is  the meaning I found.

I guess my life has always been rather structured. Reading is my play time of free wheeling and relaxing. I just read what fits my mood in the moment.  But book clubs are very good.

Little details like who does he own money to and how much? How did Trump expect to pay off his huge debts since he can’t seem to turn a profit and declares bankruptcy often? What proof did he use or fake?

In my view what happens after dusk destroyed all the good that happened before dusk.  All the good will and support gained during the day was removed by what happens after. The GOP loves it, thrives on it and needs it to survive and win this election.

But it’s not that far off.  I was just laughing about if I had a book shelf. A few I would guess. There is not a single room without books including the garages.

Arrest, trial, sentencing, a chance for appeal and then the sentence carried out in a lawful fashion. I am not sure our Founding Father’s were wrong. An honest enemy deserves respect.

1308961905902575616 2020-09-24 10:50:12 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @HugoVachon007 One thing I love is finding small accounts that are pure gold. Some of them are far better than huge accounts.

Everyone should be set up  with Twitter by phone number, e mail and two step  verification. It can take months to recover an account with out this. Only minutes with it.

1308873213892530180 2020-09-24 04:57:46 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @PegLulu2 Who knows? The sales lady may have a mean streak or have issues. Or maybe wanted the outfit for her self? Who knows? What ever it was, she was wrong. Do your own thing. I guarantee men like myself will be looking and smiling.  Who cares what she thinks?  https://t.co/YW0SlTQpWT
1308870387309174784 2020-09-24 04:46:32 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Steve__Atlas @STabbytosavit That is the way I see it with my experience and education. Twitter is what you make it. Face book is dancing with the devil and not expecting to be bitten.
1308868557917356039 2020-09-24 04:39:16 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Steve__Atlas @STabbytosavit There is room for improvement. But Twitter is actually getting far better when others are getting worse.  To me Facebook and Q are like connecting everything on your phone to a cb radio. Or telling the town gossip to keep something herself.  https://t.co/dnCEkdKfbL
1308864071924580355 2020-09-24 04:21:26 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @STabbytosavit Twitter security is now the best of any popular social platform.  Just make 100% sure you are dealing with only with Twitter and not an imitation.  https://t.co/vR0zIecmO2

1308862319284367361 2020-09-24 04:14:29 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @STabbytosavit It’s a good thing. Just a word of caution. Make 100 % sure the message comes directly from Twitter.  If the message comes a pop up, e mail or phone it probably be a scam.  https://t.co/y3JOXZ2Csd

1308855163403284481 2020-09-24 03:46:02 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AirIteig @RepsForBiden So do I. Speaking as an America I am as completely baffled by this mass hysteria and total insanity as the rest of the world is.
1308854747974295557 2020-09-24 03:44:23 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AirIteig @RepsForBiden You made the point very well. And I am very glad that you did. What you said needs to be said loud. Not everyone is willing to just hand the planet over to the Russians.
1308850618656862211 2020-09-24 03:27:59 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @realDonaldTrump Year 1976.  The Bi Centennial celebration.   Ignoring the science the GOP rushed a vaccine so it would be out before the November election.  The vaccine had to be immediately recalled after people came down with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a previously rare neurological disorder.  https://t.co/SjLKzLCWGm

1308842904916553728 2020-09-24 02:57:20 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AirIteig @RepsForBiden One thing I am reasonably sure of. Canada may or may not fall to Russia after the US does. But they will never be stupid or cowards. They will never just hand over the keys to Russia as the post GOP has.  https://t.co/BYpNQcDKLc
1308840443145314310 2020-09-24 02:47:33 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AirIteig @RepsForBiden Absolutely. The American educational system catastrophically failed the USA. I do not see Canada as ever being so pathetic they would elect a Donald Trump. But after Putin controls America his economic and militarily power will be so great he will just take what he wants.  https://t.co/JyTJ7uwIPn
1308834580330352642 2020-09-24 02:24:15 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AirIteig @RepsForBiden I love Canada and it’s people.  But the reality is if Putin gains control of America will be drunk on power. He will not hesitate to be the Genghis Khan of the modern world.  Boarders will mean nothing to him.  https://t.co/AroJvRWwQJ

1308810031660490752 2020-09-24 00:46:42 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @BDatso It feels like we were partners fighting side by side in a way.  This is not an overstatement.

I am only asking because I have friends and family who have fought addiction and alcoholism. The only ones who seem to make it are those who see addiction as a spiritual issue.

Some times it was just because I needed the quiet break from everything for my sanity.  To let my soul catch up. I left when people came in to pray. No prayers are ever more sincere than some made in hospitals.
1307859499945013248 2020-09-21 09:49:38 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @JNBPaProf Thank you. I was over confident before. It was far harder than I thought it would be. But I think we are coming out on the other side.  https://t.co/AQGX37AcYx

1307509292744966144 2020-09-20 10:38:02 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> To everyone thank you. I started smoking again after decades when my soul mate  died.

1305298127822389248 2020-09-14 08:11:39 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @TheBonziBomber Understand. Anyone who does not count their dog as one of the very top blessings in their life, should not have one.  https://t.co/jh3RiTlAOp

1305296540202872839 2020-09-14 08:05:21 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @rockn_the The most tragic part of someone who always lies is they think all others do all the time.  And because of this they can not see reality. They miss 99% of what makes life worthwhile. Like when some one says they love you, and they actually mean it.
1305295934407012352 2020-09-14 08:02:56 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @rockn_the Yes. It is a necessary survival skill. Hunting and not being hunted is all about lying.  But like all survival skills, one must be taught how to use it wisely. Too many misuse it  and have it destroy their lives of others. No one did this better than our Professor.

1305293756787290112 2020-09-14 07:54:17 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Kittymoonlights Possibly. I found this wisdom in “War and Peace.”  * If you ever read “War and Peace skip the entire first half.  And is you ever see any move of War and Peace let it be this one. All, every single other movie of War and Peace is garbage. 🤫

1305287997802323968 2020-09-14 07:31:24 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Kittymoonlights One book I gained a great deal from was “The power of now.”  It’s message is that for 99.9 % of our lives the moment we are in is usually ok. If we can just focus on the now instead of the past or future. Dogs teach us how to do this.  https://t.co/lgtDgrLeTG

The last person you think will man up often does. The one with physical strength is exposed as a moral coward. It’s only in the battle when the chips are down you find out.

He took it on the chin like a man.  I do not think it is realistic to expect many to find this level of courage and integrity.

In my own words, not Cohen’s words Trump appears to young soldiers, but not old ones. Not soldiers who have at one time been intoxicated with power, and have to live the rest of their lives with the actions during this time.
1303389685809545217 2020-09-09 01:48:11 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @alisajoy331 I am sorry. This is not my intent. Maybe if we understand Trump, we can stop him. Cohen may be handing us the tools to do just this. I will know more as I read the book when I can.

Or look when the GOP prematurely rolled out a vaccine in the 1980s. It had to be immediately recalled by the same GOP that pushed it though. It’s called science.

1302618540348968960 2020-09-06 22:43:56 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @realDonaldTrump When Don Jr. was asked how his father could be so cruel, Don Jr. replied, “It’s was just business.”
1302617117062295554 2020-09-06 22:38:16 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @realDonaldTrump What is fake?  Trump called his own brother, Fred Jr. , the only Trump to serve a fool and loser for doing so.

1302437825183461376 2020-09-06 10:45:50 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @Eloriel @GFano2 She was everything I was not. Kind, wise, she understood people. Without her to guide me I have to be more like she is to feel close to her. It’s like life pulled some joke on me.
1302436880932204544 2020-09-06 10:42:05 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @RiseUpLove3 @GFano2 I can understand this.

1302427599659032576 2020-09-06 10:05:12 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AlsterLinda @GFano2 I feel exposed, embarrassed , scared and refreshed at the same time.
1302427269361737729 2020-09-06 10:03:53 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @AlsterLinda @GFano2 🙏 That one ... got too close. It had to step back a little. Seeing my deepest thoughts, feelings  I might not share with closest friends on Twitter ... is both beautiful and deeply terrifying.
1302425960105598982 2020-09-06 09:58:41 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @RiseUpLove3 @fromknoxville Based on my experience Apple is still superior  because of its security platform, interconnections and help. But I understand your point.
1302425283824320512 2020-09-06 09:56:00 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @RiseUpLove3 Apple stocks are high. But at one time so was HP PDAs, Blackberry and other giants. It will cost them eventually
1302424793518608384 2020-09-06 09:54:03 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @RiseUpLove3 The problem is there no other good option. Thanks to Steve Jobs Apple still has the best foundation. Android is not an option. But the current CEO is  killing Apple with poor quality and outdated software.

1302421171900755968 2020-09-06 09:39:39 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @RiseUpLove3 @GFano2 I’m sorry. Every once in a while some how,  sometimes, something twitter touches. I never know when it is going to happen. It just flows.

1302416597324312577 2020-09-06 09:21:29 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @EndOtheTimez @GFano2 Actually I have a lot. I have family, friends, home and more.  But when I was thinking of what mattered it was not places I’ve traveled, or what I owned. It was all the things Trump will never have or under stand. The things he thinks are for losers. Interesting thread. Thank you
1302414123783860225 2020-09-06 09:11:39 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @EndOtheTimez @GFano2 You know. Reading all these tweets I started to feel the same. Trump with all his wealth and world travels missed it all. He missed the most important things in life. All I have now are memories.

I do because something in their argument is valid &amp; I want to hear it. We all need to support each other. But I want all views.  This 5,000 has put me in a delemia.

To her supporting a racist who is against abortion is a lesser evil than a good man who is pro choice. Again I am not agreeing. I think it’s a nuts. I am just saying it’s not always about race.

Putin’s KGB is waging a modern war using modern weapons of war. He is using blackmail and votes.  https://t.co/hG8BgvUu8F

They win by turning us into the phonies they are. Your intentions may be fight fire with fire. But we are better than this. Pull this post.  https://t.co/xaKsNJUbvH

1300629085362610176 2020-09-01 10:58:33 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> @lizstl13 Yes. Yet think about it.  In the 1960’s Hoover, our own FBI recorded conversations of innocence private citizens to blackmail them. With cell phones the KGB can invade the most private moments of all of our lives. If we vote Putin in, we give permission for blackmailing us all.  https://t.co/yln6UPsPvx

1300620626684641280 2020-09-01 10:24:56 +0800 <EveryoneLies17> Sobering conversation. Fact. 1.) Putin KGB tactics include videotaping bed rooms and blackmailing people.  2.)
