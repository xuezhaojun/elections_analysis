1343749025300803584 2020-12-29 10:41:47 +0800 <KosChertified> What does ko$her certification have in common with the attack on our #Navy ship #USSLiberty?   A: Obscurity; hidden from public knowledge; shrouded secrets; uncooperative dead ends; government disinterest; bad faith.  @USSLibertyVets might agree!  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot 🐗 #Vets  https://t.co/fqvRxaebaQ

1343652347587661826 2020-12-29 04:17:38 +0800 <KosChertified> We’d like to thank @JamesEdwardsTPC for referring us to yet one more inedible facet of ko$her certification, appliances.  We feel your frustration, and will continue to fight for consumers like you that demand transparency and #ReligiousFreedom in your secular “free market” life!
1343608887656660992 2020-12-29 01:24:56 +0800 <KosChertified> This pricey oven lists under “Key Features” of its Product Overview that it is  • Star-K Certified (Sabbath Mode)   For those of you who don’t know what that means, it is ko$her certified.  But how much is Star-K getting in fees for this? We need to know! https://t.co/fcQ35rR5z8
1343595210840834054 2020-12-29 00:30:35 +0800 <KosChertified> @usslibertyvets Can’t help but notice the “crossing the line” ceremony at the beginning of this movie.

1343372704385126400 2020-12-28 09:46:26 +0800 <KosChertified> The FIRST large scale food production bringing in kosher-certification was in 1923 with OU (Orthodox Union) and Heinz Vegetarian Beans.  Would this subject matter have made yet one more article in 1923 if Ford continued his critical investigations, or would he just append LXV? 🐗  https://t.co/4Fro3Jd55y
1343370944350277632 2020-12-28 09:39:26 +0800 <KosChertified> The Russian Collusion charges (2016-‘20) and Henry Ford’s articles in The Dearborn Independent (1920-‘22) BOTH represent deep investigations by powerful people. Only one had any meat, and it was kosher!  Immediately following Ford’s probing,  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot was born(1923)

1343244224876093442 2020-12-28 01:15:54 +0800 <KosChertified> Our research strongly suggests a Deceptive Trade Practice that keeps ko$her certification obscure from shoppers outside kosher aisles.

1336779987672649729 2020-12-10 05:09:19 +0800 <KosChertified> After the fiery 1954 speech against “clandestine” ko$her labels, DAR member Marian Strack was reprimanded:  “Incalculable harm to the best interest of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to the American society as a whole has resulted.”  This ended further ko$her inquiry

1335264746052833280 2020-12-06 00:48:18 +0800 <KosChertified> As the community that supports the Museum of Tolerance also follows Tikkun Olam (repairing the world), we sincerely suggest to begin with Self Reflection.

1335256875902795779 2020-12-06 00:17:01 +0800 <KosChertified> The Jewish community has a Museum of Tolerance, “dedicated to challenging visitors  to...confront all forms of prejudice and discrimination in our world today.”  Do they truly think all people want or need ko$her certified food &amp; inedible products?  @KosChertified is confronting!  https://t.co/IyIAFhVhcX

1334987378486755328 2020-12-05 06:26:08 +0800 <KosChertified> The stores heavily promote vodka as we approach the #Christmas holiday, and many are ko$her certified. The trademarked KSA symbol, although not as common as the circled “U” of OU Kosher, at least displays “KOSHER” under its seal on the back label (if you ever looked there)! 🐗  https://t.co/NaT64YR2P5
1334901879059271685 2020-12-05 00:46:23 +0800 <KosChertified> More clarification for the “kosher” claim is explained by the Nara rat bait company:  “That´s right, it is non-toxic. The detection monitor was specially developed for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.”
1334890520905011201 2020-12-05 00:01:15 +0800 <KosChertified> @Celtic_Films Funny twist on that: there are numerous small companies we have politely contacted inquiring if they ko$her certify their products, and often we get the silence/ignore treatment after multiple attempts.  We believe this to be a small biz strategy learned from others.
1334889320600141824 2020-12-04 23:56:29 +0800 <KosChertified> @Celtic_Films This was not an American product, and it was NOT certified. So maybe it really was used for marketing purposes (read the details on the specifications sheet; it’s also 100% allergen-free, in compliance with AIB and IFs, etc)?
1334887576998580225 2020-12-04 23:49:34 +0800 <KosChertified> One of our followers discovered “Kosher/Halal” printed on the specifications sheet for a 🇩🇪 company’s non-toxic rat bait.

We are using the alternative spelling with the “$” instead of an “s” because the costs incurred in this enterprise are completely secretive and tax-exempt

1329139563059507200 2020-11-19 03:09:00 +0800 <KosChertified> There are lots of ko$her apps listed on the @Apple App Store, and @KosChertified was once there too!

1328480379800436736 2020-11-17 07:29:39 +0800 <KosChertified> Father Coughlin created the National Union for Social Justice in 1934.  Take a look at its preamble, and compare this labor-friendly, anti-commie, anti-war platform with the social justice we hear about today.

1327661891036934144 2020-11-15 01:17:16 +0800 <KosChertified> @Jmanos195Manos A million dollars could fund an extra 400-500 Birthright Israel trips annually (in coach class + frequent flyer miles), or maybe provide for more political lobby power to raise even more security money from our real tax payers!   It’s all about compounding interest(s). Right?☀️
1327649592989532166 2020-11-15 00:28:24 +0800 <KosChertified> We perused the 2018 IRS Form 990 for Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, and found that they spent a little over $1 Million for the certification services associated w/the “CERTIFIED GLUTEN FREE” seal.

1327480105828904961 2020-11-14 13:14:55 +0800 <KosChertified> @NYesway @cursedsalad The quote is from Wikipedia Early Life on Karl Marx.
1327476205193293826 2020-11-14 12:59:25 +0800 <KosChertified> @cursedsalad “Marx was ethnically but not religiously Jewish.” - intriguing, especially comparing to rest of humanity and religions!  Are you just ethnically Catholic or actually religious in your Catholicism?  Are you ethnically Hindu but religiously Buddhist?  So did Marx keep kosher? 🐗
1327357676142030850 2020-11-14 05:08:25 +0800 <KosChertified> Often you will find the OU Ko$her seal as small as the trademark symbol (circled “R”) like the one seen here on the CERTIFIED GLUTEN FREE seal.  Small size is not an issue for the GF seal. We have documented that in our previous research.  https://t.co/vDfHKAMRVD
1327352659326554112 2020-11-14 04:48:29 +0800 <KosChertified> And so our inquiring mind immediately wonders “Why can they print Gluten Free Certified seals with textual, legible clarity on packaging but not do the same for the kosher seals, considering this is performed under the same OU umbrella group?  https://t.co/pDXsw3Q8N6
1327337888808275968 2020-11-14 03:49:48 +0800 <KosChertified> “The OU’s nearly 500 field representatives, proficient in modern food production techniques and chemical and biological processes, will conduct plant inspections and product reviews for the GFCO.”  And so there is a money flow from GF to Orthodox Union!🐗   https://t.co/H1vx8Vbewi

1322922164345995264 2020-11-01 23:23:17 +0800 <KosChertified> Will this week’s election make a difference in our present course?  A: Only if it causes you to build community with those sharing similar interests.  The Kosher Question is one that populists should get behind.

It’s another thing to justify &amp; market kosher certified products to non-Jewish vegetarians when there is a tie of support to shechita.  This is just:

1319793679108689921 2020-10-24 08:11:48 +0800 <KosChertified> For all the hype the kosher agencies promote about non-Jewish vegetarians and vegans seeking out kosher seals, it appears that 44% are completely unfamiliar with any and only 10% recognized OU Kosher as the most common and ubiquitous certification for Kashrus. Hmmm.🐗  https://t.co/vrvMtoFyjN
1319678284355964928 2020-10-24 00:33:16 +0800 <KosChertified> @therareability @ARIOSOPHY Most popular &amp; essential food is Kosher “Certified”, as well as a plethora of inedible kitchen/laundry products and even appliances...oh, and maybe other stuff like an In vitro fertilization center, toothpaste, deodorant and popular cold medicine.   https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot 🐗
1319665765222469632 2020-10-23 23:43:31 +0800 <KosChertified> And so we find, given an estimate that 4% of our population identifies as vegetarian or vegan:  0.12 - 0.16% of our entire 🇺🇸 population are vegetarians/vegans who seek out kosher certification DESPITE any ties of kosher agencies to kosher slaughter!  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot
1319663474478206976 2020-10-23 23:34:25 +0800 <KosChertified> The biggest marketing “sell” that kosher agencies employ towards attracting non-Jews to kosher certified products (and justifying this practice outside religious followers) is that their seals prove “practical” in discerning that no meat ingredients are included. We analyze 👇🏻👇🏻!
1319660678685155328 2020-10-23 23:23:18 +0800 <KosChertified> Now filtering out for those identifying as Christians, we find that 85% begin  objecting, having second thoughts on supporting kosher slaughter while seeking out kosher seals in support of their vegetarian or vegan diet. That leaves just 3%! Vegetarians: Got #CognitiveDissonance?
1319656798337462272 2020-10-23 23:07:53 +0800 <KosChertified> Of those non-Jews surveyed who seek out the ubiquitous kosher seal when shopping, 81% would/might reconsider buying kosher if they knew it was indirectly supporting ritual kosher slaughter of animals - shechita. That would leave 4% of this group if true &amp; if they were informed.  https://t.co/eSHxwGjZh4
1319654244518031361 2020-10-23 22:57:44 +0800 <KosChertified> As a service towards having a better understanding of our kosherized world, we surveyed about 450 vegetarians and vegans in 🇺🇸.

1319475225839321088 2020-10-23 11:06:23 +0800 <KosChertified> Maybe the cameraman from CBS also doubles as the label designer for breakfast cereal boxes, specializing in food certification.

1319453385557299200 2020-10-23 09:39:36 +0800 <KosChertified> The @KosChertified Team is good at noticing details like micro-sized kosher seals on dishwasher detergent labels.  But we have to inquire, is Biden’s head that much larger in reality or are the cameras set up to make him look larger? And if so, why?  https://t.co/85wLXO79SY
1319430889835687936 2020-10-23 08:10:12 +0800 <KosChertified> With over 400 respondents, even including 13% identifying as Jewish or Muslim, our survey discovered that 78% would reconsider buying “kosher” if they knew they were indirectly supporting shechita - kosher ritual slaughter.  We’re long overdue for honesty in kosher “marketing”!🐗  https://t.co/Hu21r78ZsI
1319359305427005440 2020-10-23 03:25:45 +0800 <KosChertified> Kosher agencies have told us that they “provide start to finish certification to Shechita, including plant design, humane handling compliance, shochtimand mashgichim recruitment, education and management.” In this case, 93% of this group would or might reconsider buying kosher.👇🏻
1319289180925538309 2020-10-22 22:47:06 +0800 <KosChertified> Kosher agencies have commoditized their religious dietary laws, marketing it outside Jewish congregations, but in particular to  vegetarians/vegans and Seventh-day Adventists (as the largest non-Jewish seekers of kosher seals). Six percent of our respondents happened to be both👇🏻  https://t.co/WPhqAyzKmI
1319056223363198978 2020-10-22 07:21:25 +0800 <KosChertified> You see, America has been kosherized.  Doesn’t this beg you to wonder what America could have been without this religious intervention?
1319008385413513216 2020-10-22 04:11:19 +0800 <KosChertified> “Similarly, when Nabisco sought kosher certification in the ’90s, formulas for some of its most popular products were changed in order to remove animal-derived ingredients that weren’t kosher.”  Will consumers ever be able to revisit the original recipes?  https://t.co/0nQbChLjMq

Can you find the kosher seal in the right photo? (Level: easy) 🐗  https://t.co/raGi6YZegJ
1318213339793608704 2020-10-19 23:32:06 +0800 <KosChertified> Quintessential Example: “The large food conglomerate hired the French master chef to spice up the offerings of their microwaveable dinners. But after having to replace countless ingredients &amp; supply sources that the chef preferred, his resignation letter cited The Kosher Factor!”
1318198208871374848 2020-10-19 22:31:58 +0800 <KosChertified> Example 2: “Ten-term congressman John joked with his intern over lunch. ‘Let me teach you, son, about how our government really operates. Now you thought the kosher factor only applied to food and supermarkets? Ha ha! Think again!’”
1318195295981768706 2020-10-19 22:20:24 +0800 <KosChertified> Example 1: “Sally searched up and down the entire breakfast aisle for anything without a kosher seal. Frustrated that Lucky Charms and Frosted Mini Wheats were not her favorites, she estimated the kosher factor at 110 after being forced into buying against her religious beliefs!”
1318189266334146560 2020-10-19 21:56:26 +0800 <KosChertified> What is “The Kosher Factor”?  It is the increased financial cost and anxiety burden to produce a kosher certified product, measured against a purely #NKC equivalent product free from any religious intervention, pilpul or casuistic hairsplitting.  #NKC = NOT Kosher Certified 🐗
1318031484767203329 2020-10-19 11:29:28 +0800 <KosChertified> When this nightmare is over, Americans won’t watch their brethren die in the service to their country, return from the Middle East, start up a veteran-owned small business to educate the uninformed &amp; duped citizenry, AND BE CENSORED for SPEAKING the TRUTH. 🇺🇸 #KosherPrivilege 🐗

1317854174013317120 2020-10-18 23:44:54 +0800 <KosChertified> @SamhainGhost @Sailor_Jerry69 Back in 2017 we contacted a New Zealand bottled water company asking if their product was kosher certified. Our interest in them was because their water was sold in Hawaii.  The Director &amp; CEO replied: “I'm Jewish. There's no way to certify natural water kosher, without cheating”
1317635347807760385 2020-10-18 09:15:22 +0800 <KosChertified> @Celtic_Films We would recommend #NKC Tillamook Ice Cream instead, as it is NOT Kosher Certified. We don’t believe kosher certification was prominent in the age of the Celts, and Haagen Dazs is KC.  Okay, maybe ice cream wasn’t either, but it’s time to draw a line.

1316560537799458817 2020-10-15 10:04:27 +0800 <KosChertified> Both products are certified kosher by the same agency.  One sells from a strictly kosher market.   The other sells mostly to Gentiles in supermarkets nationwide.  So why don’t we have an army of consumer advocates, and why have no consumer rights organizations helped our cause?🐷  https://t.co/zYjifSrgR9
1316554332037214209 2020-10-15 09:39:47 +0800 <KosChertified> Kosher keepers can go to strictly kosher food mart, and all the packaging includes large bold kosher seals with text, even though they know everything in there is kosher certified.  Consumers not keeping kosher are presented tiny kosher seals on most products they buy. Silly! 🐷
1316543859510321152 2020-10-15 08:58:10 +0800 <KosChertified> @RightWingRicky2 @Mastu_Denton Maybe. Just maybe.  But like every other problem we have, nobody is gonna fix it for you. We need the backing and help of hundreds or more consumer advocates.
1316516073747824640 2020-10-15 07:07:46 +0800 <KosChertified> Boy oh boy! Look what we found! Large legible hekhshers (kosher seals) with accompanying textual descriptors like “KOSHER”.

Can we kindly report that there is a religious monopoly of supervision over the dairy industry, or is this just Kosher Supremacy? 🐷
1312036846000500738 2020-10-02 22:28:55 +0800 <KosChertified> @monachina3 Yes, kosher certification is not so prevalent outside of U.S., Canada and 🇮🇱.

1312033499931570176 2020-10-02 22:15:37 +0800 <KosChertified> Unless your supermarket stocks local dairy brands in that glass bottle, you likely will not find creamers free from kosher certification.

1308493642114510852 2020-09-23 03:49:29 +0800 <KosChertified> No less than 16 ingredients to this product, and it’s kosher certified. That means that all those ingredients were from a “kosher” source!   Are you kosher aware yet? 🐷

1308267924927451136 2020-09-22 12:52:34 +0800 <KosChertified> Numerous Jewish organizations jointly filed lawsuits to stop a law banning religious animal slaughter without stunning first.

1308133038728065024 2020-09-22 03:56:35 +0800 <KosChertified> Occidental au Naturel   It’s an identity that Bavarians can certainly grasp.   It’s felt deep in the Oktoberfest culture even when the tents are closed, or on the mountain trails nearby.

1303056333776715776 2020-09-08 03:43:34 +0800 <KosChertified> This is a tax-free, financial disclosure-free Kingdom rife in cracks, beseeching consumers to open them up:  Deceptive Trade Practice  No #Tolerance for out-group #ReligiousFreedom  No forthrightness in consumer answers or cost   No #NKC Equity in production   Do you keep kosher?
1303052438123864064 2020-09-08 03:28:05 +0800 <KosChertified> Many may think “it’s too late in the game to worry about the ubiquitous kosher certification in my life, especially given all the chaos we’re currently saturated in.”  It certainly is surprising that, other than @KosChertified, there’s been no critique or push back for decades.🐷
1303000552914038784 2020-09-08 00:01:55 +0800 <KosChertified> @PaulmichaelODo1 @justave28366170 @irfarzan @cursedsalad There are many tentacles, for sure.
1302973688363405312 2020-09-07 22:15:10 +0800 <KosChertified> On this #LaborDay, we think back to decades ago when there was a political party that stood behind labor - and we all know who that was. But that was also a time when nobody spoke openly about The KQ.  Today we embrace “real” progress and #inclusion:  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot 🐷
1302795994812174337 2020-09-07 10:29:04 +0800 <KosChertified> Would the kosher certification industry exist if it wasn’t fueled by money coming in from outside the kosher community (Gentiles)?  Would Kashrus-serving rabbis, bodeks, mashgishim &amp; Jewish support staff work as vigorously in the kosher certification industry if it was voluntary?
1302615962970066944 2020-09-06 22:33:41 +0800 <KosChertified> “Every single couple, Jewish or Gentile, will have their babies under Star-K [kosher] supervision, whether they know it or not.” - Kosher Revolution, The Baltimore Sun, 10/12/1997 🐷
1302399992968220672 2020-09-06 08:15:30 +0800 <KosChertified> @cursedsalad Two major Jewish non-profits,  100% correlation to spying in America.  ADL ➡️ 1993 case in California  OU  ➡️ Jonathan Pollard Support   And both these organizations influence our culture, politics, and #freedoms. So does  https://t.co/RSyIIEp0wV 🐷  https://t.co/K6cDGaWw2r
1302291649821773825 2020-09-06 01:04:59 +0800 <KosChertified> @cursedsalad Looking at the alleged criminality of the ADL in 1993, it would seem that the fair minded and reasoning common man would believe our conclusions in   https://t.co/hFGaU4UMt7 over the ADL’s article “The Kosher Tax Hoax: Recipe for Hate”. Perhaps they specialize in deception! 🐷
1302022501350875136 2020-09-05 07:15:29 +0800 <KosChertified> Was this haircut in Charlottesville?🇺🇸

1301969447415095297 2020-09-05 03:44:40 +0800 <KosChertified> @SeventhGen, It’s been over one year since we inquired about the kosher certifying of your laundry detergents. Why do you advertise “USDA CERTIFIED BIOBASED PRODUCT 97%” but hesitate to promote “KOSHER CERTIFIED” on TV &amp; social media ads? 🐷  #Honest replies only.

1301965858500161541 2020-09-05 03:30:24 +0800 <KosChertified> Do rabbis oversee and control the ingredients in your laundry detergent? 🐷  https://t.co/t1SU6mrE95
1301709814452514817 2020-09-04 10:32:59 +0800 <KosChertified> @KerrygoldUSA and @KerrygoldIRL, Are you prepared to handle a tidal wave of new customers?  Our @KosChertified app followers will be sharing their passion for Kerrygold butter, spawning a movement to make YOUR butter the #1 brand in 🇺🇸! Let’s roll!  https://t.co/13lbJZxMdF
1301648526238052352 2020-09-04 06:29:26 +0800 <KosChertified> @Nature_and_Race Yes, but it was 12 miles plus 3,000 feet. The new knee works!  https://t.co/nwjbpRR4Fo
1301614937425375232 2020-09-04 04:15:58 +0800 <KosChertified> You know your history! Well done! The correct answer is All The Above.   https://t.co/ragajK92uN
1301594881282854912 2020-09-04 02:56:16 +0800 <KosChertified> @Abnormocracy We plan to have a special pork/bacon section to our app and website to make up for all the lard and by-products that have been removed by rabbis from the ingredients of the common foods we eat. 🐷
1301591787740389376 2020-09-04 02:43:59 +0800 <KosChertified> There’s no better time to start than NOW! And so begins the @KosChertified Awareness List.  As one of our loyal followers mentioned, you don’t want to deprive kosher keepers of their kosher certified goods when you don’t need it.  So Kerrygold butter is our first. Join in/share🍀
1301394133462908929 2020-09-03 13:38:34 +0800 <KosChertified> @westland_will There were 16 points to Father Coughlin’s preamble of his #Christian brand of Social Justice. Number 15 included: “I believe that, in the event of a war for the defense of our nation and its liberties, there shall be a conscription of wealth...”  https://t.co/CeuovXTHkL
1301386503499608064 2020-09-03 13:08:15 +0800 <KosChertified> @AshaLogos And the artificial meat will likely be kosher certified. Really! 🐷  https://t.co/JH4Xjmz9xY
1301332220565577728 2020-09-03 09:32:33 +0800 <KosChertified> Instead, you could patronize the @KosChertified app, the product of a 🇺🇸Certified VetsFirst business.  Because your clergy, your school and your grocer won’t fill you in on the details, we will.   We deliver Kosher Awareness to the masses.  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot🐷  https://t.co/CNN1eBRVAU
1301329390165348352 2020-09-03 09:21:18 +0800 <KosChertified> Listen up: Do you feel deceived and duped that for your entire lifetime you’ve unwittingly patronized a religious certification seal whose parent organization advocated on behalf of spy Jonathan Pollard (who undermined the security of your nation)?   The OU seal is ubiquitous. 🐷  https://t.co/TXiAptTSnU
1301326420015067136 2020-09-03 09:09:30 +0800 <KosChertified> Week after week the peaceful advocacy for #ReligiousFreedom in our sustenance would continue, picking a new category of products and favorable brand that is free from kosher certification.  It’s all about sharing, support, &amp; dedicated activism. Who amongst us has The Right Stuff?
1301323480365854720 2020-09-03 08:57:49 +0800 <KosChertified> And what then if the following week this same consumer activist group strictly purchased #NKC DejaBlue bottled water because they wanted to make a statement about EQUITY and #ReligiousFreedom in our secular marketplace!?!?!  Would  https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot  start trending? 🐷  https://t.co/2SFzHuTPFS
1301310760581124096 2020-09-03 08:07:17 +0800 <KosChertified> Can you just imagine the shakeup in the dairy biz if MOST American consumers began a strict policy of ONLY buying Kerrygold butter merely because it’s NOT Kosher Certified and tastes great!  Would other dairies then recognize #NKC Equity and produce butter w/o 🕎 intervention? 🐷  https://t.co/AH5zWssB5f

1301245553724940288 2020-09-03 03:48:10 +0800 <KosChertified> Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden and Jared Kushner of the USA are both historic negotiators of the Israeli-Palestinian/Arab “peace” negotiations.  One of these two is Jewish. The other...
1301238335734575104 2020-09-03 03:19:29 +0800 <KosChertified> NeoCons Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, and Douglas Feith are three policy makers, intel manipulators &amp; strategists who helped orchestrate our 🇺🇸actions in the Middle East. And since all are Jewish, let’s get kosher aware!  Can you recognize a kosher sandwich without its hekhsher?
1300970359592640513 2020-09-02 09:34:39 +0800 <KosChertified> The parent company behind ⁦@KosChertified⁩ does not care that it lacks the Twitter blue check mark, or that it is censored by @YouTube and ⁦@Apple⁩.   We are proud to display the following Vets First Certification, bc we continue to serve 🇺🇸!  https://t.co/ZfhNKt4fts
1300907988555710464 2020-09-02 05:26:48 +0800 <KosChertified> Are you familiar with religious missionaries ringing at your front door?  Kosher Certification is like this:  Your door, being unlocked, was opened. They come into your kitchen and inspect everything, stamping a tiny obscure seal on all they approve. But it was your back door!🐷  https://t.co/4x8rzMkwuz
1300881603925737474 2020-09-02 03:41:58 +0800 <KosChertified> It’s 1938, and ads like this for local kosher markets are commonplace in America. But this wasn’t good enough.  Today, your entire supermarket is the kosher market, and we’re not kidding. 🐷  https://t.co/xtpjwzREKb via @_newspapers
1300871977318580224 2020-09-02 03:03:43 +0800 <KosChertified> @DoingRight1 @ctp1708 Aren’t you missing the kosher seal on that bottle? Seriously!   https://t.co/RSyIIEGBot 🐷
