1341751244604510210 2020-12-23 22:23:19 +0800 <speakout_april> Trump discussed increasing relief pymnts MONTHS AGO but dropped it after R‚Äôs and aides advised against it.

I hope Joe Biden, his cabinet and advisers get it once he takes office if not sooner. IMO, I think Trump doesn‚Äôt want to take it.
1338295399401066497 2020-12-14 09:31:02 +0800 <speakout_april> Yes, yes, but President Elect Joe Biden won‚Äôt, because he‚Äôs decent like that. I don‚Äôt see the new administration taking measures which would look like they‚Äôre censoring media even if they‚Äôre a bunch of garbage outlets. I hope I‚Äôm wrong.

1338256180863496192 2020-12-14 06:55:11 +0800 <speakout_april> @realDonaldTrump There were no merits. Trump, his clown legal team, and Republicans provided no evidence to the courts of widespread voter fraud. Barr/DOJ, and Chris Krebs confirmed there was no fraud. Krebs‚Äôs has been I UNEQUIVOCAL, and says it was the MOST SECURE ELECTION IN HISTORY.

1337787706739396608 2020-12-12 23:53:38 +0800 <speakout_april> Trump is certifiable. Morally bankrupt, and emotionally depraved.

Pump up his ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù, but also sabotaging President Biden‚Äôs term. He‚Äôs making it much harder for foreign policy/security going forward.

1326709637538869249 2020-11-12 10:13:21 +0800 <speakout_april> @realDonaldTrump COVID19 is raging throughout the U.S at record levels since the pandemic began, and Trump‚Äôs obstructing the transition process to sabotage Biden‚Äôs ability to prepare to govern, and this Jack off is talking pre-election polling. He‚Äôs the lamest lame duck in history!

1326590684992770049 2020-11-12 02:20:40 +0800 <speakout_april> @BlueFairways7 I agree! I read a tweet how a women‚Äôs 12yo is losing his permanent teeth after having COVID/side effects. To think he‚Äôd put having pizza w/a friend over the safety of our kids is unfathomable. Sadly he‚Äôs a closet Trumper who thinks COVID‚Äôs overblown and masks don‚Äôt work. Horrible

1326586240762863616 2020-11-12 02:03:01 +0800 <speakout_april> @ViralDonutz At a restaurant. WTF? We haven‚Äôt been out to eat at a restaurant since March. I‚Äôm sure my girls would love to have a pizza date w/their friends but they‚Äôve had to make that sacrifice. It‚Äôs selfish.
1326584594041360385 2020-11-12 01:56:28 +0800 <speakout_april> @RJTheRealOne It‚Äôs pouring rain outside, it‚Äôs not a necessity like shopping for food, we‚Äôre both high risk, and me and my teenage daughters have literally done nothing outside the house. He‚Äôs being completely selfish, and inconsiderate.
1326582386511974402 2020-11-12 01:47:42 +0800 <speakout_april> @BOPBOP56 If he closes his eyes he loses balance. He was swaying the entire time. The guy has problems.
1326582010245226498 2020-11-12 01:46:12 +0800 <speakout_april> My husband has a pizza date w/his buddy. After expressing concerns abt taking unnecessary risks in an escalating pandemic, he called me ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù, and said it‚Äôs no different than grocery shopping. üò†Needless to say I‚Äôm PISSED. Everyone in this house are making sacrifices but him.
1326578203419418634 2020-11-12 01:31:04 +0800 <speakout_april> Easy.....Trump will no loner be able to profit off the presidency/tax payers, he‚Äôll no longer have the protection of the office shielding him from criminal indictments/prosecution, and he‚Äôll no longer have the attention/platform he craves.
1326576896063238144 2020-11-12 01:25:53 +0800 <speakout_april> This is full blown authoritarianism. President-Elect Joe Biden has won the presidential election and Trump attempting to subvert America‚Äôs democracy not only threatens our national security, it‚Äôs a behavior which would be condemned in a normal administration.

Trump won MI by a mere 10K votes, and a measly 77K votes combined in battle ground states. You‚Äôre disgusting. We‚Äôll see if the R Senate are going to be obstructionists, or get something done. 2022 will be watching.
1324013267270934528 2020-11-04 23:38:56 +0800 <speakout_april> @KatieHill4CA If Biden wins he should of course address COVID19, but his first big policy bill should be infrastructure. It‚Äôs a bi-partisan issue, and it will show if the GOP are serious abt getting something done, or obstructing Biden‚Äôs presidency. We‚Äôll have to wait and see.

1322730655558623233 2020-11-01 10:42:18 +0800 <speakout_april> Texas Trump supporters have lost their damn minds. Trump is endorsing these violent actions on Twitter and during his last rally speech in PA. VOTE HIM OUT!
1322729997317083136 2020-11-01 10:39:41 +0800 <speakout_april> A Biden campaign support vehicle was run into during the incident, and the Biden bus was forced to pull over, and required a police escort to its destination.

1322647770545741825 2020-11-01 05:12:56 +0800 <speakout_april> I‚Äôd like to remind Americans the GOP has fought tooth and nail to prevent states from having the ability to START MAIL IN BALLOTS COUNTING VOTES BEFORE ELECTION DAY. Not only are they challenging states from counting votes after, they‚Äôre making it impossible to get it done in 1dy

1322618324509990913 2020-11-01 03:15:56 +0800 <speakout_april> While other countries are taking steps to mitigate new outbreaks, Trump is lying about the COVID pandemic in the U.S and holding super spreader rallies which a Stanford study showed his rallies are the result of 30K infected and 700 killed by the virus.

1322294303897620480 2020-10-31 05:48:23 +0800 <speakout_april> Trump is once again disparaging and attacking front line workers for COVID19 disgustingly accusing them for deaths for profit. Unreal horribleness from this broken person.

1321156597289275395 2020-10-28 02:27:33 +0800 <speakout_april> @Atomik_ID One bogus payment Trump takes from campaign donations is 40K a month for office space in Trump Tower they haven‚Äôt used since 2016. Even in September when the campaign was begging for money, and going broke, that 40K rent got paid. He‚Äôs such a damn crook.

Trump will NEVER fire Bill Barr because he‚Äôll NEVER be able to find someone who is as corrupt, and dedicated to using the DOJ to protect/serve his political agenda. Barr IS TRUMP‚ÄôS ULTIMATE FIXER. No way Trump will give that up.
1318585754138836995 2020-10-21 00:11:56 +0800 <speakout_april> @kylegriffin1 Yet Biden‚Äôs margin in PA is shrinking. As we‚Äôve seen in the past with hopeful races like Stacy Abrams, and Beto, my biggest fear is Republicans are going to squeak by w/election wins. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic but the fact this election is as close is disturbing.
1318582775369314307 2020-10-21 00:00:06 +0800 <speakout_april> Yet the races have tightened. GOP party tribalism runs deep. Republicans have no standards. As long as a candidate has an R next to their name they will vote for them. This election is going to come down to the wire and my fear is R‚Äôs will squeak out wins again. #vote

It‚Äôs his ‚Äúwoe is me, your going to miss me when I‚Äôm gone‚Äù bullshit. It‚Äôs similar to his rally line/threats of not returning to the state if he loses. Trump‚Äôs attempting to guilt his supporters.

1312043503074017281 2020-10-02 22:55:22 +0800 <speakout_april> Per CDC guidelines if you‚Äôve come into close contact, and exposed to someone who has tested positive for #COVID19, irregardless of a test result you should self quarantine for 2weeks bc of the virus incubation period. Unreal they STILL refuse to act responsibly. #TrumpCovid
1312041929492881410 2020-10-02 22:49:07 +0800 <speakout_april> Mark Meadows who has had direct contact w/both Hope Hicks and Trump who have tested positive for #COVID19 is addressing the nation, and speaking to the WH press Corps WITHOUT A MASK.

1311909310054707201 2020-10-02 14:02:08 +0800 <speakout_april> I keep thinking abt all the times Trump mocked Joe Biden for wearing a mask, and ‚Äúthe circles‚Äù at his campaign events.

The selfishness of Trump bc COVID19 outbreaks aren‚Äôt a good look for him is despicable. Pelosi should be isolated. Pence was exposed to Trump in Oval 2days ago.
1311870872337231872 2020-10-02 11:29:24 +0800 <speakout_april> The incubation period for #COVID19 is TWO WEEKS. Sometimes it takes that long to exhibit symptoms or test positive. There no telling who in the White House could‚Äôve been exposed by coming in contact w/Hope Hicks. They ALL should be quarantining for 2wks despite test results!
1311867603753803777 2020-10-02 11:16:24 +0800 <speakout_april> With every staffer who has tested positive for #COVID19, the WH DID NOT INFORM THE PUBLIC it was reported through the media. Again, Kayleigh McEnany knew and said NOTHING at briefing. The lack of transparency ( not asking to release identities) put others at risk. Reckless!
1311864241532608517 2020-10-02 11:03:03 +0800 <speakout_april> Within the last 2days Trump and @VP Pence have potentially been exposed to Hope Hicks who has tested positive  for COVID19 ( exhibiting symptoms).

1311853700340686848 2020-10-02 10:21:09 +0800 <speakout_april> My God. Trump‚Äôs such a selfish, and irresponsible idiot. His recklessness is dangerous, and can get people killed.

1311851363014504448 2020-10-02 10:11:52 +0800 <speakout_april> Hope Hicks is a perfect example how testing alone DOES NOT prevent the spread of #COVID19. Safety measures like mask wearing, social distancing, and washing hands are ALL part of a COMBINED strategy to prevent the spread. Trump refuses to lead by example, and this is the result.

1309976199926554626 2020-09-27 06:00:38 +0800 <speakout_april> Trump said Barrett/SCOTUS will rule on ‚Äúour heritage‚Äù, and 2nd Amendment, but what he conveniently left out was 1WK AFTER THE ELECTION they will decide whether to strike down the ACA in it‚Äôs entirety. If Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed, ACA will be dead. MILLIONS w/o healthcare.

1309261564789301248 2020-09-25 06:40:56 +0800 <speakout_april> Trump is using tax payer money to buy votes. Will the Medicare ‚Äúgift cards‚Äù have Trump‚Äôs signature on them too?

1308926720393850880 2020-09-24 08:30:23 +0800 <speakout_april> @GenMhayden Why are ppl surprised? Trump has now been regularly publicizing his intention to contest mail in ballot counting. Trump confirmed his motivation for 9 SCOTUS judges bc they WILL ( he said will) get the ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äôs scam‚Äù ( ballots) case. Trump IS GOING TO CHALLENGE THE ELECTION.
1308924420438753280 2020-09-24 08:21:15 +0800 <speakout_april> BOTH Prince Harry, and "Meghan Markle" asked Americans to vote for Joe Biden but notice how Trump only singled out Meghan Markle? Why no, ‚Äúnot a fan of Harry‚Äù too? Yep. Trump. Is. A. Dick.

1304191838576955392 2020-09-11 06:55:39 +0800 <speakout_april> With Trump there WILL ALWAYS be an excuse, and someone else to blame. Today it was Bob Woodward, Biden, and China. No matter what Woodward did, or didn‚Äôt do, it would‚Äôve been the same old story. Bottom line, Trump‚Äôs the POTUS, he‚Äôs a selfish coward, and he failed to do his job.
