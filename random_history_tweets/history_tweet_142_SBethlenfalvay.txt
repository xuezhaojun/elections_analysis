Concealment of one's identity must require a great expenditure of negative energy. The result being hatred, paranoia, and self-loathing.

1332473553602576386 2020-11-28 07:57:05 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @sarahkendzior When I read the article, it was like a preview of coming attractions. When Trump sent a squadron of B-52s to the US Air force base in Qatar, was left with the ominous sense that some form of US military action was designed to occur before Trump vacates the Presidency.

This scenario is made dangerously plausible given Netanyahu's animosity towards Israel's defense and intelligence communities.

However, it borders on fantasy that Iran's other atomic scientists would be unable to weaponize fissionable material, thus maintaining Iran's military nuclear program, if any.

Only instead of preventing the exercise of the right to vote, the ballots casted are invalidated after the fact. It's arbitrary, capricious and blatantly racist by design. The GOP is guilty of en masse civil rights violations.

1320115779077951488 2020-10-25 05:31:42 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @glennkirschner2 If Trump attempts to pardon himself pre-emptively, or Pence pardons Trump, it will doubtlessly be challenged. Should it reach the Supreme Court, it's another reason to worry Barrett's presence.  But Trump cannot be pardoned for crimes violating the laws of an individual state.

They are in a position to know. There's a reason why economics is called the "dismal science."

1316076506993487872 2020-10-14 02:01:05 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @jbf1755 @neal_katyal The Constitution anticipates the inevitability of social evolution, and the necessity to adapt in response to the changing needs of society. And made it possible to allow for the amendment process. Barrett's "originalism" is inherently defective, keeping an 18th century society.

1316051816035962880 2020-10-14 00:22:58 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @JoyceWhiteVance @SenatorDurbin Barrett's subscription to "originalism" appears to be highly selective, and arbitrary. The distinction between voting as a "civic" or collective right, and owning a gun as an "individual" right, is a specious argument. The 2nd Amendment refers to the people's "collective" right.  https://t.co/mKf0VT5COc

1312128368674889728 2020-10-03 04:32:35 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @DovWaxman It remains difficult to isolate the fundamental basis for Anshel Pfeiffer's antipathy towards the American Jewish left. Trump's immigration policies i.e., establish that opposition to human rights violations must be unequivocal, and not limited to the fight against anti-semitism.
1312123359891648512 2020-10-03 04:12:41 +0800 <SBethlenfalvay> @blogdiva @sarahkendzior Indictment, prosecution and conviction for criminally negligent homicide, is the only unambiguous means to disabuse Trump, Barr, Kushner et al., of the delusion they enjoy some legally fictional, qualified immunity from strict criminal liability. They must be held accountable.

It mitigates contraction, and inhibits spreading virus. Yet Meadows doesn't wear a mask because he's "been tested." Hard to assign credibility to anything this Trump lackey has to say.
