It sucks when the party in power tries to disenfranchise millions of Voters doesn't it? Funny that that was a bullshit lawsuit that was laughed out of court.  This right here should have woken you up. It's sad that it didn't.

You also realize that our laws were changed in PA correct?  We literally went to the Supreme Court to allow ballots postmarked by the 3rd to be delivered until November 6th at 5pm.   🤣😂  https://t.co/0ZKp7bNGWm

The lawyers admitted that in several of the cases. That's why his lawyers are withdrawing left and right, it's embarrassing.

What about the mom and pop pharmacies that still exist I hope this doesn't put them out of business. Amazon is good for that.  Of course it's convenient but they've monopolized everything.

Their whole lives are online, replacing real human interaction with a computer.  Even for moderate users, social media has really done a number on real human relationships. It's only going to get worse.

Look at your quote tweets, "resisters" who can't admit that white supremacy is a problem w/ our cops.  Somehow the good cop bad cop narrative negates the fact that a lot of cops are are n a zi s.

1327924884094267392 2020-11-15 18:42:18 +0800 <corren_love> 🧵How police handled a DC stabbing... is yet another sign of how police favor the Proud Boys🧵  🔪2 of the N a z is, Bevelyn Beatty&amp; the "chairman" of the #ProudBoys said that they'd been stabbed by BLM activists  There was no proof..  Yet the police ran with the story #DemVoice1

We aren't going anywhere. Obviously there's a reason corporate Democrats are losing their seats.

1325965411678969856 2020-11-10 08:56:04 +0800 <corren_love> @iteachahs @msleen1970 The point is that the left is here to stay. I do not want infighting within our party. I want progress for all Americans. Americans overwhelmingly support Progressive policies. That's why we gained every seat we ran for. That's why moderates were voted out. Those are facts.

What she did with having him photographed could not have been easy..  It's insane that were still seeing photos like this after so much time has passed but it's not surprising.

If moderates win elections then why did so many of them lose?  The left is here to stay  Biden wouldn't have won w/out us.  The majority of America supports progressive policies

But our understanding of defunding is fundamentally different from what they think it is.  They believe it means doing away with the police altogether  They just fall for all the propaganda. Its sad

We need those things yes but we also need two-thirds of the states. So it's about changing Minds more then the Senate. So maybe if you were an actual resister you would know that and be fighting a lot harder.

But like I said he's done nothing for Kentucky yet keeps on holding on to that seat.  If you're from Kentucky then I'm sorry that you're stuck with him but not what I meant
1323839253160353794 2020-11-04 12:07:28 +0800 <corren_love> @TROLITICO @andykupf I'm not. I'm saying the majority of Kentucky voted for the Self proclaimed Grim Reaper. Obviously that's not every Kentucky resident maybe I should have worded it differently however Kentucky consistently votes against their own interests. I was just pointing out the obvious.

We are tolerant of those different than ourselves but being tolerant doesn't mean tolerating intolerance. That's the problem with so many liberals. If you see a N*zi you punch them.

Trump won the presidency off of hate. The only thing he knows how to do is capitalize on hate and incite violence. Every Trump supporter I know is a trump supporter because they're racist.

They didn't have a choice, it was federal agencies ripping their children from their arms.  Most of them for seeking asylum, for seeking a better life for those same babies.

In 2017 I would just look at him and try to put myself in those parents shoes and it was next to Impossible. He was a baby in 2017 just like the babies that were taken. And I would have died before I let somebody take him from me. It's indescribably terrible

What is surprising is the French government's islamophobic response. That is the problem, the blatant islamophobia coming out of France and the French government. And no hate speech is not acceptable anywhere

Nobody's excusing the violent action.  What's upsetting is the islamophobia in France. Nobody is going to excuse terrorism however cartoons like that have been seen in history. look at the Nazis.

1321911890054942721 2020-10-30 04:28:49 +0800 <corren_love> @fishyonekenobi @ButterflyLove_8 That same as lslamophobia that leads Americans to believe that Muslims are a bigger threat than right-wing terrorism in America. It's just not true yet people believe it.A lack of understanding breeds fear. The cartoon was a depiction of hate for Muslims, Macron should be ashamed

There was no politicization in most other developed nations. Pandemics aren't political. Only an authoritarian with a fragile ego would bungle something so badly to preserve his own self image.

1320908207611617281 2020-10-27 10:00:32 +0800 <corren_love> Strong man=Authoritarian.  What I mean is Trump leads an authoritarian government that is trying to do away with democracy  Trump does not represent the word strong in anyway.   He's got white male fragility covered to a T  He's an authoritarian who wants to upgrade to dictator

Being a strong man authoritarian doesn't make you courageous. He is a coward, he's illegitimate, and he's desperate to hang on to power. A desperate man is a dangerous man.  https://t.co/INYp2BgPWp

If the bar for winning a debate is having to be muted so that you don't throw an hour and a 1/2 long tantrum then sure. Trump lied on every question. Biden delivered truth to the people. We know nothing new about Trump's non-platform. Biden gave us policy. #BidenWon
1319685324939972609 2020-10-24 01:01:14 +0800 <corren_love> @TROLITICO His wasted opportunity will help us and I believe the dems will balance out the court. I truly believe it would have helped Trump a lot more to leave the seat empty. But strategy isn't his forte, Raw power is what they're after.
1319684995733245953 2020-10-24 00:59:56 +0800 <corren_love> @TROLITICO That was actually one of my first thoughts when he said he was going to fill the seat, What a stupid move! Now he can't point to that and say elect me &amp; Ill appoint another pro-life Justice  The empty spot in 16' was a huge part of his win, If he was smart he'd  leave it empty.

You're going down a really serious accusatory past and it's not cool. If you're going to post it like that then you need to post it with proof. Not just assumptions. I don't know who doctor Cole is. I think you've gone far enough.
1319124389527539712 2020-10-22 11:52:17 +0800 <corren_love> @SWrangles @Claire_MGWV That's a really serious accusation to make. Like wtf. Really?! Just stop. Maybe if you stop now you'll get on a list!

1319119339300278274 2020-10-22 11:32:13 +0800 <corren_love> @SWrangles @Ooter1 And I do understand what you're saying about that but it just looks like jealousy right now. These lists took me from 400 followers to 4500 in under 2 weeks. People with a small following do get the shout outs. Who
1319118703917760517 2020-10-22 11:29:41 +0800 <corren_love> @SWrangles @Claire_MGWV @classicalricky No apparently you don't know her. She didn't even know who you were Bro. Look at you throwing a hissy fit on Twitter over a list. It's pretty crazy.I know that Claire supports awesome resisters. Maybe you didn't make the cut?😂  You sound like a jerk. None of this was necessary.
1319115878630305793 2020-10-22 11:18:28 +0800 <corren_love> @Steve15454387 Yep he would've so why do 95% of you deny the southern strategy and why are you infiltrating Resister accounts?

It's absolutely ridiculous to attack one another because you don't like a list. We have Unity on our side please don't mess with that. Clare we love you.
1319110374881415168 2020-10-22 10:56:35 +0800 <corren_love> @Claire_MGWV @SWrangles Claire is wonderful and she didn't do a damn thing to you. She doesn't even need to make lists to boost other resisters but she does.  If she was only concerned about her own numbers than she wouldn't be boosting everybody else. @classicalricky didn't deserve that either. Wtf
1319109828325855234 2020-10-22 10:54:25 +0800 <corren_love> @Claire_MGWV @SWrangles Wow talk about negativity. Look I know we're all stressed with the election coming up, and going on right now, but it's not okay to lash out on each other because you don't like a list. Claire helps people out constantly. How on Earth is she using people for money?

The POTUS is not even really running against Biden, he seemingly running against the election.  Undermining our electoral system is the worst possible thing that he could do for democracy.  We'll continue to fight till every voters counted!

1318725567559106562 2020-10-21 09:27:30 +0800 <corren_love> @TheSizzleReport @JoshShapiroPA I agree. The Senate isn't going to expand the SCOTUS without Biden's approval. I think that too quell all of the questions around whether or not he will, he should just say it's not up to me. But I believe that a Biden Harris Administration will absolutely balance out the court!

1318668820274434048 2020-10-21 05:42:01 +0800 <corren_love> @CarmenSisRice @MichaelSteele We absolutely do! We can worry about our ideological differences after we save America. I'm so happy that there are still Republicans left that realize that! 💗💙💗💙  https://t.co/GRCpw3Kxeo
1318665917249839106 2020-10-21 05:30:28 +0800 <corren_love> @PissOffTrumpkin Poll watching the poll watchers. I just volunteered today to make damn sure that there is no harassment or abuse happening at the polls. It's disgusting that this is even necessary.

1318661258795769857 2020-10-21 05:11:58 +0800 <corren_love> @andykupf @NY_runaway Exactly! Well said Andy!!  https://t.co/xjylgZR26L
1318660786672308230 2020-10-21 05:10:05 +0800 <corren_love> @CarmenSisRice @Endgame2021 But you're absolutely right that adding more justices opens the floodgates for Republicans to screw us later. Its a tough situation but I think above all the Court needs balance ya know?

1318640521640902657 2020-10-21 03:49:34 +0800 <corren_love> @CarmenSisRice @Endgame2021 He loses the centrist Republicans that just can't stomach Trump  It's so contentious and I found your comment really interesting. What do you think he should do? I absolutely support adding a couple of justices, not to give the SCOTUS a leftist supermajority but to balance it.
1318640141511122947 2020-10-21 03:48:03 +0800 <corren_love> @CarmenSisRice @Endgame2021 We are already under minority rule. The vast majority of Americans do not agree with the Supreme Court as it is now. What would you like to buy into say? The question of court packing is a lose lose for him. If he says no he won't he loses some of the left if he says yes...
1318639740346900485 2020-10-21 03:46:27 +0800 <corren_love> @CarmenSisRice @Endgame2021 I don't disagree that it would have monumental consequences but what Mitch mcconnell has been doing to our courts has had monumental consequences. If we don't have balance in the courts, not just the SCOTUS either, the whole process is completely undermined &amp; Americans lose faith
1318633365105422345 2020-10-21 03:21:07 +0800 <corren_love> Trump's TERRIFIED of facing the people:  •On his #COVID19 failures   •His failures on RACE  •His TAXES  He's TERRIFIED of #JoeBiden  Trump's spent a lot of time insisting that Joe's scared to debate him  If so..

The fact that half of America embraces and excuses it is also indicative of a successful takeover and feels really familiar...
1317651336553467905 2020-10-18 10:18:54 +0800 <corren_love> @andykupf Right I knew then just how far he'd be willing to go to do away with democracy. He hates it. He wants to be able to just mow down any opponent. Its terrifying. He'd kill us if he could. I honestly believe that.

For the GOP true conservative values no longer exist. Now they embrace being the party of hate. The party against human rights.The anti democracy party of straight up fascism.

I understand that they have a more thurough knowledge of bones and muscles than a regular MD. However they compete for the same resident positions, etc.

1315067327721943041 2020-10-11 07:10:58 +0800 <corren_love> @andykupf @sladesr Exactly. This man wants to take health care away from 22 million Americans but you know again a couple justices to balance out the court and that's a step too far.  The court has to represent the people or it loses all credibility.  https://t.co/6VBTRECJ8o

It really needs to be some kind of an ethical violation to be sending anything like that in the mail when there this election is basically a mail in election.

He also didn't show any proof, it's just an anecdotal story from someone with a clear political agenda. Not that an isolated incident is proof of anything.  https://t.co/3HCW8m3hgT

1314649931693658113 2020-10-10 03:32:23 +0800 <corren_love> @dones65 @JasonMillerinDC But didn't trump tell us that Florida was the only place where mail in voting was really OK?  He wouldn't have lied to us right?  No never.  He would never ever only say that because hes registered there, right?

He mounted his #TrumpCoupPlot nearly a year ago, really 4 years ago if we think about it. He's known the whole time that he won't win.

He's suffered true loss &amp;grief. He's been through things Trump could never understand. He knows how badly Trump has let America down.  He won't add to the problems, he'll help solve them.

1312046196047962112 2020-10-02 23:06:04 +0800 <corren_love> I'm praying that Trump didn't infect our future president while simultaneously insulting him for wearing a mask. My thoughts and prayers are with the Biden family  with the hope that they continue to test negative. #Biden is a leader #Trump would never put his ego aside like this

1312044519165227008 2020-10-02 22:59:24 +0800 <corren_love> #ScottAtlas is not an expert and his voice is the one that now matters on the #COVID19 team.

It's because their white male fragility  can't handle anything perceived as a challenge or threat. They know that they can't compete in any sense so they just try to win with hate and fear.

He could've ignored the insult, instead he said how proud he is of Hunter. Being in recovery myself, that hit home more than anything.

1310749409622265861 2020-09-29 09:13:06 +0800 <corren_love> None of its a coincidence.
1310749291317780480 2020-09-29 09:12:38 +0800 <corren_love> Birds of a feather flock together. Remember when he told do Duterte how he loved the Duterte was killing addicts in the streets in the Phillipines&amp;he wished he could do the same here?  Or when he told Woodward how much he loved Erdogan&amp; hates our allies? Or his Putin love affair?

1310745476698976258 2020-09-29 08:57:28 +0800 <corren_love> #TrumpIsNotABillionaire &amp;he's been stealing from us far longer than 4 years. He thinks you're stupid, he thinks I'm stupid &amp;he's been laughing all the way to the bank. Let's make him PAY. Reminder: #JoeBiden paid $3.7 MILLION in taxes in 2017. #TaxFraudTrump paid $750 #DemVoice1
1310729566554673157 2020-09-29 07:54:15 +0800 <corren_love> Exactly. Hes nothing more than a grifter.. He never intended to be elected he just wanted the notoriety. That's why he couldn't care less about the American people. The only positive is that thanks to his gigantic grift every crime of his will come to light. #DonTheCon #DemVoice1

So I can only imagine how you and your family feel. The idea that your Uncle had to find the woman he very clearly loved so much in that way is horrible.. I am so sorry🙏
1310088127973859330 2020-09-27 13:25:24 +0800 <corren_love> @RayTurnAtl I really &amp; truly mean it. There's nothing normal about losing her to this virus. Her life did matter, and she definitely isn't just a faceless name on a list of victims. It wasn't her time to go and my heart really does break for you. This shit is so wrong and you're not alone.

1309726377382490113 2020-09-26 13:27:56 +0800 <corren_love> @Endgame2021 It certainly is. Trump is Anti democracy and anti America.  He and the GOP know that the higher the voter turnout they less chance they have of winning. Republicans have been saying that openly for years. Lowest turnout possible = Republican wins. they'll use any tool to suppress

Cops  Testimony is automatically considered factual when a black person being believed is a miracle#Amerikkka
1308914063037128713 2020-09-24 07:40:05 +0800 <corren_love> This collage is so fucking stark. It's horrifying and disgusting but absolutely factual. Why do white mass murderers get to live (some even get fuckin wendys) yet unarmed black people are shot down in their prime constantly? #TheirLivesMattered. #BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice
1308913132623065091 2020-09-24 07:36:23 +0800 <corren_love> @pi_mij @laceysculls Wtf do u mean?? Its straight up facts. Facts don't care about your white male fragility.

1308909692526227456 2020-09-24 07:22:43 +0800 <corren_love> Just a snippet of everything wrong with America.This is horrifying&amp; offensive and totally fucking expected. Why in America are cops word taken as fact? The facts are the facts #BreonnaTaylor was Fucking #Murdered in #Amerikkka by those sworn to #ProtectAndServe her. #SayHerName
1308908902457712646 2020-09-24 07:19:35 +0800 <corren_love> She's so fucking right. #Amerikkka
1308908662170226688 2020-09-24 07:18:38 +0800 <corren_love> #BreonnaTaylor was fucking murdered in her own bed. It wasnt a mistake and they didn't choke. It was a fraudulent investigation that resulted in a fucking MURDER. This lack of charges is reprehensible. #Amerikkka #BlackLivesMatter #SayHerName #TrumpsAmeriKKKa  #DefundThePolice

You're exactly right and this is exactly how fascists behave, These are fascist rallies, at then he just screams and yells, lies, spreads hate &amp; fear in unhinged rants.. His all encompassing narcissistic need for adoration is more important then American lives.

Then a check wouldn't be a status symbol it would just mean you're not a freaking bot. That's way too simple though Instead they punish people, especially the resistance. There should be a much better system in place.
1308757075963473925 2020-09-23 21:16:17 +0800 <corren_love> @Bluenomatterwh9 I couldn't agree more. #MAGAts don't believe what the asshole said in private on the #WoodwardTapes , they believe what he says on stage to his #deathcult. It just blows my fucking mind.  None of them care how many people they kill and he certainly doesn't care. He's killing us.
1308755593977425920 2020-09-23 21:10:23 +0800 <corren_love> @John83305472 Exactly.If they've linked 7 deaths &amp; over 170 cases to that 1 wedding in Maine It's hard to imagine what will come of a rally that looks like this. My family had the virus, I know how serious this shit is&amp;That was before they were admitting community spread. This is gonna be bad.

1308751792734457860 2020-09-23 20:55:17 +0800 <corren_love> @realDonaldTrump What the fuck is wrong with you? You came to my town during a pandemic and brang your #COVIDIOT #DeathCult while over 200,000 Americans are dead. How many do you think you will kill by having held this rally? You failed America and you should be in prison for homicide. #TrumpKnew  https://t.co/EaZVLkWG8L
1308747720505454598 2020-09-23 20:39:06 +0800 <corren_love> I hope he catches the virus that he spreads to so many millions of Americans. This was in my town, it should've never been allowed to happen, he doesn't have much support in #Pittsburgh so most of those people must've traveled in. Which makes it even worse #TrumpRallyPittsburgh
1308746735544492034 2020-09-23 20:35:11 +0800 <corren_love> These people mostly traveled here. Thousands of #COVIDIOTS packed into one place will result in death. We know that #TrumpLied200KAmericansdied so why is this being allowed to continue? It's not just #Trump being stupid or lying. He's knowingly killing us. #TrumpDeathCult

1308584981686554624 2020-09-23 09:52:26 +0800 <corren_love> WTF @Twitter?  Have seen so many tweets like this today what is with the attacks on the resistance? It's called #FBR for a reason. This is the most important election of our lifetime, You stifling our message w/ the restrictions is just not cool.
1308584318667821057 2020-09-23 09:49:48 +0800 <corren_love> Get ready #Toomey You're useless and #PA is going to force you into #retirement. Circumstances aren't different AT ALL. You're a spineless sycophant who does nothing for your state, a failure just like your #SupremeLeader #Trump. You'll regret this. #RBGRevolution #RBGsDyingWish
1308579897644900352 2020-09-23 09:32:14 +0800 <corren_love> This #GOPDeathCult member held a #SuperSpreaderEvent in my town in June.@PaZiccarelli If you don't care about your kids please care about ours.

1308577934890983424 2020-09-23 09:24:26 +0800 <corren_love> This is @PaZiccarelli approaching children with no mask on (during a pandemic) RIGHT by my house. I'm not only insulted by her visit to my neighborhood I'm also angered at her lack of respect for the people of plum, #WearAMask wtf. The #GOP DON'T CARE if we DIE, even our KIDS.
1308576341680418816 2020-09-23 09:18:06 +0800 <corren_love> @PaZiccarelli's a #GOPCoward trying to take the seat of @SenatorBrewster. She's a #TrumpCultist for the ages and  would only hurt the people of #PA (like me) by leading with hate and fear just like her supreme leader. You guys should let her know how wrong she is!#JimBrewster2020
1308574778249359360 2020-09-23 09:11:53 +0800 <corren_love> @PaZiccarelli I live in plum and I personally would prefer that you don't visit here, don't approach my kids. Promoting #Trumpism is promoting fascism. The only values you represent are hateful rhetoric &amp; fear mongering. You're adding to the problems not solving them. #JimBrewsterLandslide2020  https://t.co/wNf5kcn5p4

It definitely can be repetitive, but everybody else is just covering the now (for the most part) you know.

1307768051065069569 2020-09-21 03:46:15 +0800 <corren_love> I know that this is from May but it doesn't make a difference. The facts are still the facts. This govt. did not act. All minorities have been and are dying at rates much higher than white people.#COVID19 has highlighted so much of what's wrong with America. There's no excuse.
1307766973783257096 2020-09-21 03:41:58 +0800 <corren_love> 2/2That's exactly what this is.The utter lack of action from the fed govt is clearly killing indigenous people. Not only did our government steal their land &amp; children, murder, and rape them, now they're telling them to accept death rather than offering any help. It's disgusting.
1307766972571152385 2020-09-21 03:41:58 +0800 <corren_love> What the fuck.The #POTUS &amp; #GOPComplicitTraitors are killing the only indigenous people we have left. They'd rather let them die than actually do their job or admit wrong doing. I'm part Cherokee&amp;the continued genocide of indigenous people is so fucking criminal..
1307747989511864321 2020-09-21 02:26:32 +0800 <corren_love> Wow😊 Thank you so much for your kind words! You made my day💙  https://t.co/BpemGlnSsd

By voting for Biden I'm not betraying my morals/convictions. I'm being reasonable&amp;working with the hand that I'm dealt. Every leftist should do the same, there are more than ideological differences on the ballot

Unless that headway is closer and closer to a Civil War.  Protest votes will only take us closer to an irreparably divided nation.

I personally believe that right now our footing is far from secure. The only path to secure footing that I see as viable is to elect Biden. 4 more yrs of this will only take us further from the goals.

But I do think that if u are u should be ashamed because people are really dying from #COVID19 whether the person had diabetes, asthma, Even CANCER, It's still a covid death if that person would be alive today if not for the virus

You have to be kidding me. That was a practiced response if I ever saw one. Everything does is calculated. He knew how about it would look to all women if he stepped one toe outta line
1307537289011224576 2020-09-20 12:29:17 +0800 <corren_love> @AppStateJen @cspan He also was prepared, he knew this was coming. How else can you explain him releasing his list of prospective judges over a week ago? He was ready with an auto response.
1307536983909191685 2020-09-20 12:28:04 +0800 <corren_love> @AppStateJen @cspan Why? it was fake. He knew if he said anything other than something along those lines it would look fucking awful to women voters.  Don't worry behind that response there's a party happening in his little brain.

Bottom line is it's either him or trump sell all of these never by the never trumpers are saying fuck America

They know exactly what they're doing &amp; they know that it's the opposite of what Bernie wants us to do. I dont agree with Biden on most things but I support him because I know that hes a Patriot who cares about us all.

1307459135609491461 2020-09-20 07:18:44 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden I understand your position completely, it's the execution that I'm having trouble with.. With the system stacked against us I just don't understand how you're expecting to accomplish anything with Trump in office.
1307458575569215489 2020-09-20 07:16:30 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden I agree w/ Biden on almost nothing. I care about saving America. That's it. It's not just about the presidency either it's about the senate and every other facet of govt. That's why I'm going to school next year to get started in a Poli-sci program.  To make a fucking difference.
1307457437558026240 2020-09-20 07:11:59 +0800 <corren_love> This is why it's so easy to destroy America and under 4 years. The way our democracy is up does not work for every American.  Is it did a person like Mitch mcconnell wouldn't have anywhere close to the power that he has.
1307457067599499265 2020-09-20 07:10:30 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden You definitely don't have to be a smart ass. This it is way too serious, there's no point wasting time on people that are not going to put the future of America before ideology.
1307456798673207299 2020-09-20 07:09:26 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden I really don't get how protest votes or not voting at all will get us to where we need to be. There really might not be an America left if we don't get a democratic president &amp; senate. It's easier to fight from the inside with your foot in the door. We're clearly not gonna agree.
1307456325555806210 2020-09-20 07:07:34 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden Oh I just saw this 1. If that's your position explain it. How on Earth does giving trump votes a better way to get to the end goal? This is exactly what Bernie did not want, He made that super clear. But yep have a good day. I know what the dnc is  I know what we're up against.
1307455681482706947 2020-09-20 07:05:00 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden I do hope you reconsider but either way have a good day and please stay safe yourself.

I would do anything to have Bernie on the ticket and it's awful. I'd much rather be still be volunteering for Bernie but that's impossible rn so it is what it is I'm voting for Biden to save America.

I absolutely volunteer for the candidates that I support, I have enough love for Bernie to respect his wish &amp; get trump the fuck out. We need Bernie but that's not what we're gonna get this time.

America will not survive 4 more years of this period. Trump is a symptom of everything wrong with America not just Biden and Obama. To boil it down to that is ridiculous.

1307452629321216000 2020-09-20 06:52:52 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden How do you think that a vote for anybody else isn't about for trump? I'm honestly wondering. The 2 party system is broken beyond repair &amp; it needs to be totally overhauled but that can't change in under 50 days. We'll only get further away from our goals by electing trump.
1307452293722370048 2020-09-20 06:51:32 +0800 <corren_love> @PaulSorrentino3 @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden Really? I'd hoped you'd possibly reconsidered that position based on the urge to not complete this downward spiral into total fascism.  I'm putting my need 4 democratic socialist policies to the side to save America.We'll only get further from the finish line w/ 4 more for #Trump
1307451361576050689 2020-09-20 06:47:50 +0800 <corren_love> Call #MoscowMitchMcTreason He needs to recognize that if he has any hope of holding the senate he won't push this vote through.

Why do you think the medical system/industry is set up the way it is? Do you think it's so that we can afford care on our own? It's not.

We're good now, I just know how lucky we were. It could have easily went the other way. It's terrible knowing that our awful situation ended up being so much better than hundreds of thousands of others.   The only lingering symptom is anger. I'm fucking angry.

I hate this phone. My husband was the one who was extremely ill, he had fever dreams in our game Room for weeks&amp;thought that he was going to die alone in the hospital because his covid pneumonia symptoms got BAD. We were terrified.

I really do think that if you do your own research on all of the subjects we have discussed you will find that we have given you facts that are undeniable. Every vote counts I hope you change yours!

They're not radical policies and they work, That's just an undeniable fact.

There's very real and clear race issues in this country but there are also serious classism issues that a lot of people ignore. Funny thing is that most trump supporters are looked at as trash by the people that trump actually works for.

I would literally DIE before I allowed a my kids to be referred to as Trump Youth. In my mind Trump IS synonymous with Hitler as he has no greater goal than to have the same kind of legacy, even on our kids.

He's had 6 bankruptcies &amp;every retail product he has launched failed miserably. He's had 2 failed marriages &amp; a current wife who won't even hold his hand. It's a shame no one likes him.  #TrumpFailed

1306391093135712256 2020-09-17 08:34:42 +0800 <corren_love> @CDCDirector #RobertRedfield  Is finally speaking the truth after months of carrying water for Donald Trump. I guess better late than never.. Hopefully under #Biden we can start trusting the CDC again.
1306340658282717194 2020-09-17 05:14:18 +0800 <corren_love> Wow. Yep he'll be handing in a resignation letter by next week. It's super sad and disheartening that as soon as a government employee tells the truth we can basically expect them to be gone.  Not that it excuses most #Redfield's actions up until now.

1306334495805763586 2020-09-17 04:49:48 +0800 <corren_love> Look at that, a #COVID19 briefing that actually stays on subject and isn't just an insane 1 or 2 hour long rant.

1306279946889891840 2020-09-17 01:13:03 +0800 <corren_love> And I agree #Biden shouldn't have a pass. A clear &amp; concise plan's needed, the problems didn't start with #Trump.He has given racists&amp;racism validation, a place at the table. Systematic, economic, societal racism has existed as long as the USA has &amp;real change is the only answer.
1306277840153980929 2020-09-17 01:04:41 +0800 <corren_love> 3/3He does nothing but add to the problems&amp; has no solutions. He's NEVER offered black people an invitation to this "Great American Future". He encourages police brutality &amp;murder AND right wing violence &amp;extremism while demonizing #BLM. I believe hes trying to start a civil war.
1306277838912450561 2020-09-17 01:04:40 +0800 <corren_love> 2/3Trump had no answer because there's been no time in which there's been any greatness for black people in America. To #Trump #MAGA means make America white again, that's it. He's made that apparent w/his white is right talking points, His base, his overt hate.. #TrumpTownHall

I'm from PA as well and I basically got really used to the whole lock down routine (I'm mostly home with my kids typically anyway). Having to go back to doing everything in person kind of sucks. I didn't mind just chilling with my family one bit.

It goes much deeper than government sanctioned murder by the police, if you weren't in deep denial you would see the inequality in every facet of life.

He knowingly traded American lives to keep the stock market looking good so he could continue to pretend like the economy was in great shape. Do you own stock? Doubt it.
1305289935847657473 2020-09-14 07:39:06 +0800 <corren_love> @Lynn21769890 Better immigration policy or a  xenophobic asshole who wastes our money on a wall that won't keep anybody out.  Common sense tax policy or Tax cuts for billionaires.  Crucial climate policy or the continuation of Earth's destruction. A realist or a fear mongering narcissist.
1305289218151907328 2020-09-14 07:36:15 +0800 <corren_love> @Lynn21769890 This year on the ballot is truth or lies, love or hate, unity or division,  Working toward racial equality or a bitter b racist, A public servant or a failed business man who's also a criminal. A loving husband or a man who pays off porn stars with campaign funds
1305288629028368385 2020-09-14 07:33:54 +0800 <corren_love> @Lynn21769890 I'm really curious, you thought that this tweet was worthy of pinning?  Is this groundbreaking to you? What's on the ballot is the future of not just our democracy but democracy all over the world. Donald Trump has done away with any semblance of oversight or election security.

He makes christians look like they've lost all values, They just look hateful &amp; stupid for supporting a hateful stupid man. It's sad because it's obviously not what Christianity is supposed to stand for. It's a cult of personality now, at least evangelism definitely is.

There is no end to trump's depravity and the pathetic willingness to defend it coming from his cult. My mom who voted for him now says exactly what you just said every single day.

The fact that they revere a man who has only ever held a Bible for photo Ops is evidence of that. Not only is the Republican party gone, Christianity is totally wrecked.

That much is as clear as day just based on your tweets from the last couple of days and I don't just mean Israel.  Again WHY are you in THIS thread trying to grovel for followers?  Stop avoiding the question.
1305024319655948298 2020-09-13 14:03:38 +0800 <corren_love> @KernUnited @RepLeeZeldin @JessieJaneDuff A person's religion should have ZERO to do with how you speak of them. Having a political problem with Israel is one thing but if it walks like a Nazi, talks like a Nazi and tweets like a Nazi, it's a Fucking NAZI.  Like I said, you didn't answer the question.
1305001381116416003 2020-09-13 12:32:29 +0800 <corren_love> @KernUnited @RepLeeZeldin @JessieJaneDuff I'm not saying that we can never question Israel, I think that we absolutely can and should.. However to be so vehemently anti-Israel is pretty questionable and so is just calling Jewish Congressman Jews seemingly as a slur makes you sound like a nazi.
1305000738733600773 2020-09-13 12:29:56 +0800 <corren_love> @KernUnited @RepLeeZeldin @JessieJaneDuff I mean literally nearly every tweet that you put out into the universe is pretty openly anti-Semetic &amp; the other ones are just anti humanity. In fact just by virtue of being pro trump you are anti humanity in general. He's killing us.  You ignored the question, why are you here?

The economy can't flourish when there's a #pandemic going on that isn't even close to contained. So yes it's trump's fault just like basically everything else. Hes called the leader for a reason, He's accountable for everything that happens under him.

1304626937126621189 2020-09-12 11:44:35 +0800 <corren_love> @realDonaldTrump Who told you it was a good idea to go on a Twitter rant today? You're a dumpster fire personified. Its #911 you psychopath. Rather than pitting states against one another by political party maybe you should lead for once. Just a reminder, sadly you're the president of every state  https://t.co/ue97flS4Y7
1304626095329816582 2020-09-12 11:41:14 +0800 <corren_love> @realDonaldTrump Why is always red or blue States with you? We are the UNITED STATED OF AMERICA. But since you wanna talk about blue States please don't forget that it's blue States that put WAY more into the pot than ANY red state. If anyone's getting bailed out they live in a red state PERIOD.
1304624593911635974 2020-09-12 11:35:16 +0800 <corren_love> Here's what a real leader and Patriot does on a national day of mourning. A leader refuses politics on a day of remembrance, a day of terrible sadness. A leader eould never overtly politicize #911 Donald Trump is not a fucking leader.
1304621933988925441 2020-09-12 11:24:42 +0800 <corren_love> @realDonaldTrump God you're such a sociopathic narcissist. The fact that a #POTUS is fucking retweeting his own lies&amp;propaganda on the #911anniversary is one of the most abhorrent things I've ever seen. You're a piece of shit. You don't deserve to breathe the same air as our military. #TrumpKnew
1304619849612754944 2020-09-12 11:16:25 +0800 <corren_love> A man that doesn't even deserve to breathe the same air as our real patriots. #TrumpDoesntCare #TwinTowers #911Remembered

No one that's even in a small leadership position would ever refuse all accountability.  There is nothing that will wake these people up. They don't want a presidential leader, they want a cult leader.

1304270469487566850 2020-09-11 12:08:06 +0800 <corren_love> Says the wife of the man who once told #Strongman #RodrigoDuterte of the #Phillipines that he loved his policy of murdering Addicts &amp; Dealers, that #Duterte was doing a great job, and that he (#Trump) wished he could do the same here. Trump wants to kill addicts, not help them.

1304268138092072960 2020-09-11 11:58:50 +0800 <corren_love> @FLOTUS @ONDCP @WhiteHouse Remember when your husband told Duterte of the Philippines how much he loved his policy on addicts&amp; dealers? The one in which the police openly murder them? I remember. He told him he was doing a great job and he wished we could do that here. Your hubby wants to murder addicts.

I can't Imagine stanning an on the record a rapist, liar, racist (and as you mentioned draft dodging, cheating, Failed businessman), tax Evading, fear mongering, Russian puppet who hates our troops. The thought makes me physically ill.

My immediate family &amp; I all had the virus and I am so eternally grateful that my fiance and my babies (who were all really sick) made it &amp; didn't have to go into the hospital, but I've seen what even a mild case of it looks like. It's brutal.

There's no way to really understand the loss of multiple family members in rapid succession unless you've been through it. And it doesn't help I'm sure that their deaths were avoidable if we would have had leadership.

The man is on table admitting that he lied to the American people on purpose. There's no defense.

Mistakes were made by many but I believe that only trump&amp;his administration fucked up w/intent.

So all they can say is "Hey look over there". It's pathetic and it just goes to show that there is literally nothing he could do that would make his hardcore base say fuck this guy.
1303879328598556677 2020-09-10 10:13:51 +0800 <corren_love> @AshaRangappa_ @Oregon_Man_ Yeah the American experiment as failing. If the republicans won't stand up to trump in the face of abject murder then they cannot pretend to purport to the tenants of democracy.
1303878969146716161 2020-09-10 10:12:25 +0800 <corren_love> 😂😂😂  Poor little Donny.
1303878829757399040 2020-09-10 10:11:52 +0800 <corren_love> Hey look over there. Trump and all of his sycophants will pay. #Trump #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #TrumpGenocide #TrumpKnew #FuckTrump
1303878439817089024 2020-09-10 10:10:19 +0800 <corren_love> @Miriam2626 @MikeTheResister Hey look over there. That's their whole strategy, it's definitely not a winning one. Only people that really want to believe that shit will buy into it.  This is too big for them to cover up with their What-about-ism.
1303878020579692544 2020-09-10 10:08:39 +0800 <corren_love> @CNNPolitics Trump's a murderer plain and simple. Everything that he does is in the interests of money. Human life as inconsequential to him and it always has been. Obviously he's trying really hard to lose this election, and murdering the electorate is a great strategy.
1303877594123849729 2020-09-10 10:06:57 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @sweetshark @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden 🤣🤣🤣 K
1303877433033134081 2020-09-10 10:06:19 +0800 <corren_love> @AyoDaego @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden That's hilarious. Apparently you don't know what leadership is or what it looks like. If trump would of won out there and openly and honestly asked his supporters to wear a mask they would have worn them. That's all that there is to it. He lied people died.
1303877122235215872 2020-09-10 10:05:05 +0800 <corren_love> @sweetshark @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden Only one president admittedly lied to all of us in the interest of his own re-election, but wow aren't you good at strawman's!
1303876586647834625 2020-09-10 10:02:57 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden And if they did die I'm terribly sorry for your loss. I've seen this virus I know how horrible it is. And I blame trump.
1303876484877123585 2020-09-10 10:02:33 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden Idk that your grandparents have died but I'm not gonna say that they haven't, What I'm going to say is that leadership comes from the top. Trump lied people died. Cuomo doesn't even come into this equation. Trump openly lied calling it a hoax when he knew how serious it was.
1303874754609324033 2020-09-10 09:55:40 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden Oh stop troll. What-about-ism isn't going to work today.  Leadership starts at the top, the buck stops with him. He admitted on tape that he knew exactly what was going to happen and he knew exactly what it was while he admittedly lied to the American people.
1303874335187361792 2020-09-10 09:54:00 +0800 <corren_love> @kurisu7885 @BobQuarantine @JoeBiden Exactly hundreds of thousands of people from China still poured in, and anyway it was the European virus strain that killed so much of New York. He is a murderer plain and simple. All you hear him tout is that "travel ban" anyway as though it did any fucking thing.
1303873835213651973 2020-09-10 09:52:01 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden If he did such an amazing job how do you explain the level of death we've seen here compared with other countries? We have had the worst response in the whole fucking world. That's a fact. All the while he knew exactly what it was and what it would do.
1303873471223599105 2020-09-10 09:50:34 +0800 <corren_love> @Zamgage @moosearoundchi @JoeBiden O just stop. He lied to the American people in his own self interest. He is still killing us to this day.  His followers like you follow his words to the letter. If he would have been honest less people would have died. Less people would still be dying. He didn't do nearly enough
1303873041798234113 2020-09-10 09:48:52 +0800 <corren_love> @BobQuarantine @JoeBiden Also you know what is policy? Getting rid of pandemic offices, not following the pandemic play book given to you by an experienced administration. Not implementing anything other than I suppose it travel ban to stop the spread in time. You just sound ridiculous.
1303872775002693634 2020-09-10 09:47:49 +0800 <corren_love> @BobQuarantine @JoeBiden How can you defend murder? Spreading misinformation &amp; apathy to your cult is is good as giving them the virus yourself. Remember #COVID19 spreads asymptomatically. I know, I had it asymptomaticly. So he killed his own supporters and those unlucky enough to come in contact w/them.

There are many things to say about the evils of addiction &amp;beauty of recovery but I'll leave it here, I never knew that I could love life sober until I tried

How little control you have over the choices that you're forced to make, How the drug just won't let you care about yourself, how having a child isn't enough to keep you clean,that..
1303542545381818370 2020-09-09 11:55:36 +0800 <corren_love> 6/8 I'm grateful that I now know how beautiful life can be and that it's not just a series of insanity, let downs, and short stints in jail or rehab.  I look back now on this time as some of the hardest yet most rewarding days of my life.The fight never ends&amp;for those that have..
1303542544190627841 2020-09-09 11:55:35 +0800 <corren_love> 5/8 I'm grateful that my soulmate didn't leave me no matter how many reasons I gave him to do just that.  I'm grateful that his parents never wavered in their support of us. I'm grateful that my little boys have never had to look at me as anything other than their SuperMom,
1303542542890344448 2020-09-09 11:55:35 +0800 <corren_love> 4/8 and for every ounce of forgiveness I've received. I'm grateful for every day that I'm alive because it was not always a given that I would make it to 30. And I didn't always care if I did. I'm grateful that I am able to raise my kids and teach them to be good humans..
1303542541736906752 2020-09-09 11:55:35 +0800 <corren_love> 3/8 I haven't put a substance before my children. I haven't had to steal to make ends meet. I haven't been completely &amp; utterly controlled by something I had no control over. Most importantly, I haven't lost my gratitude. I'm grateful for every ounce of support I've been given..
1303542540537339905 2020-09-09 11:55:34 +0800 <corren_love> 2/8 I haven't had to lie to or let down my family (yet again) and I haven't broken their hearts in a long time. I haven't been so desperate that living life was inconsequential. I haven't had to come to terms with the things I had to do to stay well. I haven't avoided the mirror.
1303542539543289856 2020-09-09 11:55:34 +0800 <corren_love> 1/8 So I have 2 years clean today.. There are a lot of things that I haven't done in the last 2 YEARS. I haven't chased ANYTHING to numb myself. I haven't had a substance be the deciding factor on what my day would consist of. I haven't been arrested. I havent ignored reality..

I'd love to get involved and fully believe that its my responsibility to do what I can to stop the fascist takeover &amp; that means more than tweeting. I will definitely brainstorm and try to come up with something helpful as well..

1302739070918045697 2020-09-07 06:42:52 +0800 <corren_love> @RefuseFascism @therevcoms OK I didn't know have a phone yesterday. Mine broke and I was waiting for my replacement to come in the mail. I'm wondering is that the site that I should go through to just organize for another day or is there going to be another day of mass protests do you know?
1302117969695313921 2020-09-05 13:34:50 +0800 <corren_love> @LeeSpelledLi Bored protesters looking for something to protest. Hmmmm.  Yeah, we like human rights, we don't like those that support violations of those rights. Maybe you should learn a little history yourself, specifically the history of China and Hong-Kong and why Disney Should be ashamed.
1302116988492357632 2020-09-05 13:30:56 +0800 <corren_love> @LeeSpelledLi Yeah but she is being paid for that story. Do you have any idea what's happening in Hong-Kong? Do you have any clue what she's supporting? It's disgusting and she doesn't deserve a penny. Just think, the star of a movie about hardcore oppression supports hardcore oppression. Wow.

Maybe you should be fired for  Having literally no redeeming qualities, or maybe you should be fired for not even be getting to understand what being a Patriot really means.
1302107826588987397 2020-09-05 12:54:32 +0800 <corren_love> @mdnij34 Absolutely, hes also a narcissist, sociopath, misogynist, draft dodging little bitch,Nepotistic fool, Xenophobe, and a Conspiracy theorist, The list goes on and on. But yes he's the white supremacist in chief. He wouldn't know patriotism or Racial Justice even if it pissed on him

It's a sad time to be an American, If you care for your country your heart gets broken everyday again and again. But we'll build back better very soon(If there's not a Civil War 1st).

1302098016363597825 2020-09-05 12:15:33 +0800 <corren_love> Beyond that there are many more service members in my family, and in my husband's. I'm PISSED that the "Commander In Chief" treats Gold⭐families like trash, calls #POWs losers &amp; that #DraftDodgerDonny can't wrap his mind around #ServiceBeforeSelf #Sacrifice or even #Patriotism.

The whole fake news spiel is just designed to be an attack on freedom of the press. It's in the dictator playbook. When you make the public lose faith in the media, and they only look to you for truth, it's fascism.

Trump is #UnfitToBePresident for so many reasons, but sneering at our soldiers who've died tops the list. He doesn't deserve to be in the same room as our soldiers or in the presence of their gravestones, He certainly doesn't deserve his title.
1301914202085437441 2020-09-05 00:05:08 +0800 <corren_love> @realDonaldTrump will never understand sacrifice or service.

1301587118268055553 2020-09-04 02:25:25 +0800 <corren_love> You know what gives me hope? When @realDonaldTrump is coming to my state and the 15 year old McDonald's drive-through kid (who I adore) who serves my children's happy meals regularly tells me that he gets to go see the #POTUS to hopefully tell him he's ruining America today.

I was just thinking per capita it's even bigger but regardless it's the same thing, Same type of rise to power.

I'm not exaggerating.
