1340774075195650051 2020-12-21 05:40:24 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles Except for the fact that I’m stating every logic fallacy, as you break it, which is supplying the evidentiary information to prove you are a liar. Quit begging the question. You look so stupid creating the same logic fallacy over and over.   Does it hurt to be a ignorant as you?
1340773623565602822 2020-12-21 05:38:36 +0800 <carolinasassie> @gwmdelta2 @AldereteCharles The cognitive dissonance kicked in, because they cannot defend their point of view logically, in a fact driven manner, so they are busy rejecting the facts of the matter. EGO!! His subconscious is completely in control. That’s amoeba level thinking. He has an extremely low EQ.
1340773002816987140 2020-12-21 05:36:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @gwmdelta2 Projecting?   Awe, it must suck to be so stupid that you could never figure out how to control your brain. But do not assign behaviors to me based on your emotions. Those are your emotions, not mine. They are also your behaviors. Quit begging the question. It’s fallacious.
1340772502574915587 2020-12-21 05:34:09 +0800 <carolinasassie> @gwmdelta2 @AldereteCharles Now he is creating absolutes and calling them “facts.”   This dude is totally bonkers. Like, he is so stupid, he has absolutely no idea how stupid he is.

1340771566095912965 2020-12-21 05:30:26 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles It is all provable, whiny. You non sequitur attempt was amazingly illogical, although, I applaud your audacity to top it off with the false dichotomy. You are incapable of forming structured thoughts that hold veracity. Lmao.   Seriously, does it hurt to be as stupid as you?
1340770676655972354 2020-12-21 05:26:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @gwmdelta2 I’m breaking your logic. That isn’t called being judgmental. It’s called discernment. Evidently you’re determined to prove that you’re too stupid to understand that construct as well. Why do you continue whine about your emotions like a little kid?  It’s so reductive in nature.
1340769870733062146 2020-12-21 05:23:42 +0800 <carolinasassie> @gwmdelta2 @AldereteCharles @realDonaldTrump He does not know what a fact is and admitted as much. I think he received one of those “special” educations.
1340769684006858759 2020-12-21 05:22:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @realDonaldTrump I’m sorry that facts confuse you. Hunter was caught receiving a bribe from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, which I have stated before. But evidently you are slow to catch on. He literally took money from an agent of Putin. Plus all his Chinese porn videos made him easy to target.
1340768666795819008 2020-12-21 05:18:55 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles I can prove mine, unlike you, so mine has validity, unlike yours.
1340768469260902402 2020-12-21 05:18:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> @gwmdelta2 @AldereteCharles He has done nothing but whine about his sissy feelings. It’s so emasculating. He’s totally one of Plato’s bronze-souled people. He is not capable of anything but base thinking. When you think about that story, Plato wasn’t all wrong. The idiots are stupid. He had that part right.
1340767915772157956 2020-12-21 05:15:56 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @gwmdelta2 You are not qualified to judge others based on a metric of your belly feels. Quit trying to gaslight people to justify your juvenile whining. Grow up, because you think like a child. Does it hurt to be as ignorant as you?  You are completely incapable of forming logical thoughts.

1340766654536556546 2020-12-21 05:10:55 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @realDonaldTrump Except for the fact that you are speculating, (whining about emotions) &amp; I’m actually stating facts, you might be believable. But since you’re begging the question, I know that you’re creating fallacies. I feel sorry for you, bc you appear unable to structure thought for validity

1340721127094677504 2020-12-21 02:10:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles @realDonaldTrump Except for the fact Moscow’s mayor’s wife got caught giving Hunter a couple million bucks, you might have had a point.   Naw, not really, you never had a point. But Hunter did get money from one of Putin’s cronies and now you look even more stupid.
1340718347114205184 2020-12-21 01:58:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> @AldereteCharles I really don’t care about your over inflating feelings about yourself. I don’t think you are objective.

You don’t have the aptitude to apply theoretically behavioral methodologies. You cannot think logically. That is why you keep whining. You aren’t capable of logical discourse.

They are based on your feelings. You’ve even started tweets saying, “I feel” Bc you are so obsessed with emotional driven illogical thinking. You do not possess higher thinking skills.

Hunter’s political status is irrelevant. What is relevant, is his family status and the fact the Biden’s are tied to communist officials connected to Putin.  Biden is compromised.   Does it hurt to be as stupid as you are?

You are not “hurting anyone’s feelings,” that is where your logic broke and you began justifying YOUR WHINING. But no one cares about your whining. So quit whining.

Is that why you keep whining about your feelings?   I really don’t care about your feelings. Find a psychiatrist and pay them to fix your ignorance. I would not take you as a client. You are extremely immature.

Unfortunately, it’s stupid fiction meant to demean &amp; irrelevant. Kinda like you.  Darn those facts.

You look needy &amp; desperate for attention; like a child.

But since you have been so kind as to prove you do not, thank you.

Her lens is skewed, so she cannot see reality, because she is stunted in a delayed adolescent cognition level.

Someone indoctrinated her and told her she could “think,” but no one has told her the truth about what thinking is, evidently. It’s so strange to see someone whine, “I’m a scientist” &amp; believe it gives validation.

She whined about her feelings and said she read something. But unfortunately that fallacy proves she is prone to illogicality. So I’m not inclined to believe she comprehended what she read, or can for that matter.

It does prove that you are illogical enough to think suppositions about your feelings are a rebuttal.  But your feelings do not negate the facts of the matter. I’m sorry.

It is completely fallacious &amp; not ground in logic, though. Because the Elders “existed” then the proven FACTS regarding Marx must not be true, is bonkers thinking. He is whiny.
1339906332976136193 2020-12-18 20:12:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> @rlipstein No, because that was a conspiracy that was created by the Okrana.

When you created only two options based on your feeling for Trump’s behaviors, and projected them onto him. Therefore you created a false dichotomy, sweetie. Piss off, bot. You are not worth my time.

But man, you are ignorant if you cannot figure out conversational situational awareness. It must hurt to be so stupid that you can’t figure out if you are being spoken to, especially on Twatter, bless your heart. That’s sad.

His gaming strategy is to hawk and do a fan dance based on whining.   That is every child. There is not originality in the abhorrence. HE IS BORING and pathetically desperate.

He thinks like every other kid in the world. There is no reason to highlight him, because he is apathetically bland. FORGETTABLE!! They’d never remember him. He is boring.

But his narcissistic behavioral patterns are not even original. When I said that he was simple, it was because he does not even use advanced fallacies to express himself. His level of fallacious thought is literally indicative of 12-14. He’s boring.
1338602666058985472 2020-12-15 05:52:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> @HandsomeSean1 @BrianKMetzger Oh he has proven that premise in spades.
1338602307286671368 2020-12-15 05:50:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> @gwmdelta @BrianKMetzger He is wrapped in a perpetual cycle of conflict that is fueled by his feelings of inferiority. You really should feel sorry for him. Because honestly, look how hard he works to prove that he is pathetic. He cannot wield logic, so he keeps whining. That’s a reductive state.

1338600773702328320 2020-12-15 05:44:29 +0800 <carolinasassie> @BrianKMetzger Still sharing your emotions, but delusionally pretending that you are not literally writing them out for the entire world to see your whining?

I named them as you attempted to use them in order to gain control of the conversation through emotional manipulation, because you cannot form logical thoughts.

1338482097296711681 2020-12-14 21:52:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> @Daly81 @MatchGame67 Do you understand anything about thought? Or do you just assume that you know how to think?

It’s her job. So run along child and go find your elder. She cares about your whining. Or at least she is forced to deal with your crazy. I’m not. That’s your job. Piss off.
1337863048485277699 2020-12-13 04:53:01 +0800 <carolinasassie> @verum29 Your logic is way off and you are begging the question. Sitting back so that you do not create a prisoner’s dilemma to divide the country, does not stop the country from being divided. It allows it. You are encouraging passive acquiescence and that’s a ridiculous strategy.

He has gone way past normative status quo behavior &amp; into the land of perversion. He needs a mental health evaluation before he has access to children again. He is creepy.
1337100882685677568 2020-12-11 02:24:27 +0800 <carolinasassie> @maxalbanese Republicans can’t post Hunter’s actual porn videos. We get banned, since they include all his perversions. It appears to be a family thing for the Pervs. Weird that you think honorable work that Melania did as a model is bad, but the pedos are good.  Are you a pedo apologist?

It’s expansion system has always been organized out of Russia since the days of the Comintern. It’s odd, people thought communism quit being a threat.
1336598732939423745 2020-12-09 17:09:05 +0800 <carolinasassie> @DNI_Ratcliffe did an interview with @CBS_Herridge that everyone should see that explains how China is lobbying for laws that benefit China.

To put this in perspective: 40,000 men were killed in the Korean War; 300,000 Americans have died from Fentanyl laced opiates.

They bought Biden for easier access!  https://t.co/iZFYHHb7WC

Which by the way, I did prove in my 1st tweet. You project &amp; gaslight as a coping mechanism. It’s pathetic. Seek help for your pathological inferiority issues. It’s narcissism
1332718491749785601 2020-11-29 00:10:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> @wills_melton @rachtaylorr7 @TrailerTrsh @toddstarnes Quit the gaslighting. It does not work on trained minds. It just suggests that YOUR narcissistic behaviors are pathological. You are a bigot that is justifying your prejudices. It’s akin to evil and your defense is denial. That’s mental illness.

I stated the facts of the matter in response to your whining. And—I’m sorry that you are stuck in a cycle of conflict and projecting it defensively when confronted with reality. It’s your cognitive dissonance issue

That’s your problem. You failed yourself. God has nothing to do with that, nor do others. That’s on you. Solipsism is limiting you.

That’s not Christian, regardless of your feelings. It’s divisive and akin to evil. Check your cognitive dissonance issues, bc your hasty generalizations are a sign that you think irrationally.

1332372448323506178 2020-11-28 01:15:20 +0800 <carolinasassie> Steve Bannon has been discussing the rally on his show. He said there is one, tomorrow, in Georgia, because there is a sense of urgency AND on December 5. I am referencing the information that he spoke about moments ago.

1332365128323502080 2020-11-28 00:46:15 +0800 <carolinasassie> @FreedomWarro Steve Bannon said Georgia, tomorrow afternoon and the 5th. There is sense of urgency.

1328075679083192320 2020-11-16 04:41:31 +0800 <carolinasassie> 17/ The results actually suggested the researchers were ignorant or being deceptive: Seeing positive posts makes Facebook users more positive, not less. This story is proof that emotions can be &amp; they are being manipulated by big tech giants. Hold fast and let things play out.  https://t.co/9fc4m5FDL5
1328074893104197632 2020-11-16 04:38:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> 16/ The scientists pointed out that the motivation for the study was altruistic. 🙄 Many people are concerned that seeing lots of positive posts from friends might make other people feel left out and unhappy. Which is absurd, because happiness&amp; laughter are generally contagious.
1328074271223140352 2020-11-16 04:35:55 +0800 <carolinasassie> 15/ This study could therefore be seen as a standard algorithm test. The main difference is that this test was published in the scientific literature &amp; people read about it. Not all platforms are as forthcoming about how they omit Christians &amp; Conservatives from the conversation.
1328073183438770177 2020-11-16 04:31:35 +0800 <carolinasassie> 14/ Given that Facebook can’t feasibly include every post that friends make in a user’s News Feed, it uses an algorithm to determine which posts to include and which posts to omit.   And different versions of that algorithm are regularly tried in order to improve it.
1328072780659765248 2020-11-16 04:29:59 +0800 <carolinasassie> 13/ Or did they?  Before people can sign up for Facebook, they do have to agree to certain terms, including a data use policy. It turns out that Facebook manipulates News Feeds all the time and analyzes the results for internal purposes.
1328072290119147528 2020-11-16 04:28:03 +0800 <carolinasassie> 12/ Worse yet, the people in the experiment weren’t even aware that they were in an experiment. They were just browsing the Facebook site like they always do, checking their friends’ posts and updating their own status.   They never gave the scientists permission to analyze them.
1328072091128766476 2020-11-16 04:27:15 +0800 <carolinasassie> 11/One of the main concerns was that the researchers tried to manipulate the mood of nearly 700,000 people.  For 1/3 of those people THE GOAL WAS TO MAKE THEIR MOOD WORSE rather than better. People were concerned the study caused emotional harm to hundreds of thousands of people.
1328071442328662019 2020-11-16 04:24:40 +0800 <carolinasassie> 10/ The study had a major impact on the field—although it’s not the impact that the authors had hoped for. Almost immediately, a number of people slammed the study as being unethical. Critical articles appeared in academic journals as well as in popular news &amp; magazine outlets.
1328071068507058178 2020-11-16 04:23:11 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/ The scientists concluded that emotions expressed by Facebook friends can and do influence our own mood.   In other words, emotions that are expressed on social media can be contagious.   The study was published in the journal— Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
1328070468348366848 2020-11-16 04:20:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ The researchers found that when positive posts were deleted, the % of positive words in people’s status updates decreased, while the % of negative words increased. Conversely, when negative posts were deleted, fewer negative words &amp; more positive ones appeared in updates.
1328069389644673025 2020-11-16 04:16:31 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/ Still others had the same proportion of random posts deleted to serve as a control. Then, the scientists analyzed how deleting positive &amp; negative posts affected the status updates of the users. In other words, they treated people like their lab rats and experimented on them.
1328068754870317056 2020-11-16 04:14:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ To investigate this question, researchers made changes to the News Feeds of about 689,000 Facebook users. They randomly deleted 10% to 90% of posts that contained positive words from some users’ News Feeds; other users had 10% to 90% of posts containing negative words deleted.
1328068535134932994 2020-11-16 04:13:07 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ The scientists were interested in examining whether positive and negative emotions are contagious. And, specifically, whether Facebook users who see fewer emotionally positive posts in their News Feed produce fewer positive posts themselves.
1328067988961030149 2020-11-16 04:10:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ These are Communists style fear tactics.   They know they are effective at influencing people on social media because they having been practicing on us. Facebook’s emotional contagion experiment was conducted in January 2012 by researchers at Facebook and Cornell University.
1328067800439676929 2020-11-16 04:10:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ Do not listen to a press, who are content to hand a senile child sniffing Biden the American election.

1328066741667311618 2020-11-16 04:06:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ They tried to get us to believe Trump is compromised, incompetent, &amp; mentally unstable.   This is Communist style propaganda.

The numbers are inflated based upon the information that I use for reference from J Rummel at the University of Hawaii. But I’ll not argue that point. The Christians and Jews share a religious text that makes them a unique threat to Marxists. Marx was an atheist.

I am not going to argue statistical numbers with you as Wikipedia as a source. Marxism is the deadliest ideology known to man. Hitler’s ideas too were based upon it.

1327337528060506118 2020-11-14 03:48:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> 16/This is yet another reason @realDonaldTrump is the ultimate threat to the Globalists Establishment. He refuses to sacrifice America’s children. He stands up for the silent majority &amp; is beloved by the American people for it, &amp; hated by a system of evil that creates sycophants.  https://t.co/qguuB5jGeD
1327335721133363203 2020-11-14 03:41:11 +0800 <carolinasassie> 15/ And by 2036, only 20 years from now, it will be 10% conservative, 70% liberal, &amp; only 20% undecided. This is simply demographics, and there is no quick fix to change this 2020. Trump though was breaking their stranglehold on education and slowly unraveling their plans.  https://t.co/6jPT4GNLnG
1327335375409459209 2020-11-14 03:39:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 14/Numbers show that they’re capturing 85% of our young people each year through the educational system. This is how it played out in 2012, America was divided 30% conservative, &amp; 30% liberal, with 40% undecided; by 2028, it will be 20% conservative, 50% liberal, &amp; 30% undecided.
1327335373278638081 2020-11-14 03:39:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 14/ We wonder why it's hard to get a good candidate anymore for President of the United States. Well, Let me show you how education affects politics. In 1980, there were approximately 40% of Americans that were conservative; 10% liberal; &amp; 50% undecided.  https://t.co/LG8hnPKiGb
1327334761640161282 2020-11-14 03:37:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> 13/ Which interrupts the NWO’s plans to make our children in the image they desire. Because those educated under that system and it’s influence, well basically it makes them unfit to participate in America’s governance or American society.  https://t.co/7Zi508sw3f
1327334358349467648 2020-11-14 03:35:46 +0800 <carolinasassie> 12/ We have seen a decline now for 70 straight years without any interruption. As long as the government has a monopoly in education, we will keep getting what we have. Trump wants to stop that and restore choice back to America’s education system and give parents options.  https://t.co/pJhAPoGq1Q
1327333859243986945 2020-11-14 03:33:47 +0800 <carolinasassie> 11/ So to even talk about common core, debating its good points or bad points is playing into their plan of sidetracking, all of our energies and efforts on a debt in lieu, even without Common Core, the schools are completely bankrupt, and destroying America’s children.
1327333516099653633 2020-11-14 03:32:25 +0800 <carolinasassie> 10/ We legitimize them by acting like they just don't have a good idea, and we have a better ones. They know exactly what they're doing. They want to create a new world man and woman, that is dependent on government for his very existence.
1327333419743907840 2020-11-14 03:32:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/ That's the goal of the whole thing. So they will repackage, rename, rebrand, the same old thing over and over again. It is all intentionally going down hill and here is something we have to grasp, this is purposeful.
1327333274163798019 2020-11-14 03:31:27 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ So far there has been no fix. I know you don't want to hear that, because I don't want to hear that either. But it's true. They control the curriculum taught through the Teacher’s Unions. They want our kids to be useful idiots. They want them to be dependent on the state.
1327333133352570887 2020-11-14 03:30:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/Now, they are essentially creating Marx's vision, &amp; at the same time, making it virtually impossible for America’s ideals to thrive as well, because of the mind arson necessary for them to get an amenable voter. The bottom line is this—our enemies are in control of the schools.
1327332877189730304 2020-11-14 03:29:53 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ In any event, the global elites don’t want this, so unless education somehow benefits them, it needs to be re-imagined. Therefore, American Exceptionalism was a threat that had to be destroyed and the target was the nation’s children. Lenin, Stalin, Mao all understood this.
1327332319972237314 2020-11-14 03:27:40 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ We believe in using all the individual talents &amp; abilities that God had given to contribute to society. America supports people wanting to do 100 different things in their life. Historically, this freedom has allowed for world changing business innovations &amp; better lives.
1327331597964746752 2020-11-14 03:24:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/  Individuals created to be content to work 60 or 70 hours a week, in a dead end corporate job, that just pays enough to survive. Traditionally, Americans would have had no interest in that. We are a culture that believes in individualism.
1327331240777814024 2020-11-14 03:23:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ Simply because they're at the table. The Globalists. They're already political players &amp; they don't want to worry about competition. But not only does this eliminate competition, it allows them to create their future employees. People who they are epistemologically designing.
1327330700933083139 2020-11-14 03:21:14 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/The model they want to build will have our schools simply be a tax paid training ground for corporate 🇺🇸. Schools that teach what to think, not how to think. In the end, most of this tracks back to people who would benefit financially from a more government centric economy.  https://t.co/fzlAqC88JZ
1327330170261413893 2020-11-14 03:19:07 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/ The 10th plank of the Communist Manifesto states, that Communists should seek to provide a free education by the state for all children and to combine education with industrial production.

1327268033329582080 2020-11-13 23:12:13 +0800 <carolinasassie> The Lincoln Project stated that they were going to use mob pressure tactics against the firm’s clients to force the firm to abandon Trump’s litigation efforts. It looks like the Commies were successful in applying enough pressure to get them to abandon ship &amp; the American people.
1327264484461867010 2020-11-13 22:58:07 +0800 <carolinasassie> Out of curiosity, since we are playing war games and currently living under the duress of a mass illusion—did anyone know that the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Iraq that helped kicked off the Iraqi War was actually FAKED and orchestrated by a weaponized PR company?  https://t.co/aRxdIjf0Mj

I could not believe that Canadians would ever re-elect that clown. He is an embarrassment to Canada. The press in Canada though is all propaganda except for Ezra. Your country scares me a little, but the people are great.
1327243657603407872 2020-11-13 21:35:21 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/Trump wins this election in the end &amp; there’s no doubt in my mind. He has managed to expose one of the biggest scandals in America’s history—the lack of security &amp;  integrity surrounding America’s elections. #HoldtheLinePatriots, we’re watching history in the making, yet again.  https://t.co/jSIQJ1bwBd
1327242820642607104 2020-11-13 21:32:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ The Chairman of the FEC, Trey Trainor has announced that from his observations that from what he has seen occur in Pennsylvania and in other parts of the country, that this election is illegitimate.

1327241156216885248 2020-11-13 21:25:25 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ Here, the so-called “glitches” which are actually a program feature the switch votes from one candidate to the other.

1327240607354544128 2020-11-13 21:23:14 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ The SCYTL cloud servers then feed the data to Clarity Elections, which then feeds the Media Networks and the decision desks. So the tabulation software at SCYTL appears to be once of the places where the votes are being manipulated.
1327239775594668032 2020-11-13 21:19:56 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ Similarly to Dominion Voting Systems, SCYTL has a long history of election fraud in various nations, including injecting back doors into its election software. So all the votes end up being in the SCYTL cloud servers.  https://t.co/etL7RaZ97U
1327238938684239875 2020-11-13 21:16:36 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ One has to wonder why that company placed those computers in Germany as well. Did BND’s (the C-I-A of Germany) Special Services have a hand in this orchestrated coup d’état attempt? The US elections votes were counted by the bankrupted SCYTL in Spain and Germany.  https://t.co/3g3WDMWpxG
1327238613210435584 2020-11-13 21:15:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ Smartic is partly owned by George Soros. Clarity is owned by SCYTL who are based in Spain and Germany. If there was no electoral fraud why did the US Army confiscate the computers and servers from a company in Frankfurt, Germany that was counting SCTYL votes?  https://t.co/Dj1voH0u5K
1327238174247186434 2020-11-13 21:13:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/ Dominion voting machines allows administrators access in under 2 minutes, so anyone can program them to do whatever they want them do. They aren’t secure. Smartic or Clarity Analytics, are the 2 software systems used in various electronic electronic machines in each county.

1326973277705789440 2020-11-13 03:40:58 +0800 <carolinasassie> @SailFree Trump didn’t advertise the fact that he has been slowly buying gold. He hasn’t made it a public spectacle, but he did state it on July 3, 2019 when he said,” the campaign to reinstate the gold stand is getting louder.” His last 3 appointees to FED board also favor it as well.

1326959133845811201 2020-11-13 02:44:45 +0800 <carolinasassie> 10/ His desire to return to a gold-backed dollar threatens the FED’s power once again, because it returns the power to create money back to the U.S. Treasury Department where it belongs.   Would that be motivation enough for Biden to attempt steal an election from the 🇺🇸 people?  https://t.co/65hxMfkY44
1326957122093985794 2020-11-13 02:36:46 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/ Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, &amp; John Kennedy were murdered after taking action to have money issued by the US Treasury, not through centralized international private banks. That is an undeniable fact. Trump’s is also a threat to the banking cartels.  https://t.co/VqQkT43qsT
1326956059781685251 2020-11-13 02:32:32 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/History does have a way of repeating itself, and one thing U.S. history has definitively shown—the only 4 presidents who prevented the international banking cartels from having the sole power to issue &amp; control US currency, are the only 4 presidents who were ever assassinated.
1326955408091717632 2020-11-13 02:29:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/ Is it also just a coincidence that upon taking office, each and every Vice President who assumed the Commander-in-Chief post immediately repealed the new central banking order and re-instituted the money issuing powers to the banks?   I highly doubt it.  https://t.co/WLg5MsW2k1
1326953711005032450 2020-11-13 02:23:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ Is it just a coincidence that all four assassinated United States Presidents, Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy were also the ONLY four presidents who disallowed the central bank's monopoly powers?  https://t.co/Ow9GmBvgEi
1326953191431417861 2020-11-13 02:21:09 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/They accomplish this easily enough, through the interest they charge to the American taxpayers for issue us our own money. Yes, they charge us to control our money, but we can’t audit them to see what they print. Was this a good enough reason to launch a conspiracy to kill JFK?  https://t.co/lArny13CVp
1326951465261395969 2020-11-13 02:14:17 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ The Federal Reserve Banks immediately got what they desperately wanted after President Kennedy's assassination. They once again, unilaterally controlled the issuing of US currency. They once again, had a business that pays them literally over $500 billion annually.  https://t.co/ZrEk6CHyg9
1326951015313272834 2020-11-13 02:12:30 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ He tried to muscle out the Federal Reserve Banks. So unfortunately, there was quite a logical reason for his assassination. He took major money issuing power away from this banking cartel and gave it back to the people of the United States. Then he was killed.  https://t.co/Zw5BlbD99p
1326950570192678912 2020-11-13 02:10:44 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ 12 private credit monopolies were deceitfully and despoiling foisted upon this country by bankers who came here from Europe.

1326675210502885377 2020-11-12 07:56:33 +0800 <carolinasassie> 13/Although, we do know that ideas have consequences &amp; what you believe, affects what you will do. When you realize that Marxism is uniquely evil. The leaders, people like the rest of us, but they had exceptionally bad ideas, the same ones we are playing with today—Biden’s ideas.  https://t.co/ujZGhKsTEr
1326674042615705600 2020-11-12 07:51:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> 12/ But that is just not the truth. The simple truth is, most Marxists on the planet would have done the exact same things they did. Because they believe their philosophies &amp; that they aren’t accountable to a higher authority, &amp; w/o a higher authority, there are no consequences.
1326673160054468609 2020-11-12 07:48:24 +0800 <carolinasassie> 11/ The most cunning, ruthless, and well-connected rise to the top, which is why we have to give Biden some credit. But big government will never work, because no one is capable of being in charge. We like to think of Hitler and Stalin, as if they were uniquely evil people.
1326672297571311616 2020-11-12 07:44:58 +0800 <carolinasassie> 10/ Well, you know, who those people in the city hall actually are? They are a collective &amp; you can look to Portland to understand this point. Their collective is suppressing Americans &amp; every one of them, they're enjoying this power!! They've been drawn it their entire lives.
1326671498166362113 2020-11-12 07:41:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/ ...or if you go down to your local city hall on Thursday night, and take a look at who those people sitting up there in those big chairs, you know, while the little people come in and say, “Well, I'd like to complain about this mask mandate.” They said, “Your time is up.”
1326670910926032902 2020-11-12 07:39:28 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ No one ever intends on stepping down. They only transfer power. Obama, was going to transfer his to Hillary. They never thought, she would lose. Therefore, it’s the reason, no matter what Marxist government you go to, whether it's the national government in Washington DC...
1326669827352760321 2020-11-12 07:35:09 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/ Marxism takes from each according to his ability &amp; gives to each according to his need. That was the grand ideal, right? But the problem has always been, no one steps down. Once you have the power, no one steps down, &amp; the reality is that the beautiful picture is just fiction.
1326668829859176449 2020-11-12 07:31:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ Unfortunately, the end of all collectivist schemes is a government that takes care of its citizens from the cradle to the grave. That is Marxism. People who don't understand this naively believe you can have big government, w/o totalitarian methods, but history says different.  https://t.co/YsxtwEYeqT
1326667603377577986 2020-11-12 07:26:19 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ Those are all just different words that are used to describe the different &amp; many flavors of collectivism. Collectivism is the concept that the state is all important, &amp; that the individual must be &amp; will be sacrificed, if necessary for the greater good of the greater number.  https://t.co/KPHef76obs
1326666813745344513 2020-11-12 07:23:11 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ And since they are collectivists, they want to give the power to the government. But remember, not the American Government. A collectivist one, bc collectivism is a broad ideology that includes all of these things like Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Socialism,  and Liberalism!  https://t.co/hpWrLFXI7I
1326665805413683201 2020-11-12 07:19:10 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ They also want to destroy the church, and the American government or state. All 3 of God's institutions. So regardless of people’s “well intentions,” collectivists are enemies of 🇺🇸, as they’re all people in groups that seek to usurp the authority God gave the family &amp; church.
1326663852256268289 2020-11-12 07:11:25 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ All three were created by God, to protect each individual person from being abused. The collectivist attack against us today is aimed at destroying those distinctions. It's interesting to note the Communist Manifesto states, the communist’s main goal is to destroy the family.
1326663242442272769 2020-11-12 07:08:59 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/ God established three institutions, the family, the church, and the state. And He taught us exactly what their authority was to be and what was within their jurisdiction. America's greatness, was that we followed God's instruction about how those institutions should be run.  https://t.co/YDI79zwDU4

1326643705147760641 2020-11-12 05:51:21 +0800 <carolinasassie> I need to amend this tweet after more digging. Ruddy started giving the Clinton Foundation money in 2015 and the contract was for five years. Meaning, he was still paying the Clinton Foundation THIS YEAR. What is he paying to play with from 2015-2020? America?
1326642992971657222 2020-11-12 05:48:32 +0800 <carolinasassie> @HuberHammerQ_ They should answer why they were giving the Clintons money for the past five years. INCLUDING THIS YEAR. What are the paying to play with? America?

America does dispute the fact that a senile man that sniffs children could con anyone into legitimately voting for him, let alone get the most people in the nation’s history to vote for him. It’s absurd.

1326239169635553281 2020-11-11 03:03:53 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ We were told by our government leaders that inflation was the cost of capitalism in a world economy. So while we believed the lie that inflation was normal. It wasn’t normal for the first 100+ years of our history. It magically started in America in 1913 with the Fifth Plank.
1326238506126020613 2020-11-11 03:01:14 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/ 2000 years ago, &amp; an ounce of gold today will buy 300 loaves of bread. The prices of things rarely change. What did change was America’s system. What has happened is the Federal Reserve has been quietly stealing our wealth. Money hardworking Americans spend a lifetime earning.
1326237863944597505 2020-11-11 02:58:41 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ When people finally retire after a lifetime of saving, all the money they put aside does not buy anything, not anymore. Houses have not gotten more expensive though. The dollar has just lost its value over the last 100+ years. One ounce of gold would buy 300 loaves of bread...
1326237390864834560 2020-11-11 02:56:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/So if the current rates of inflation, stay as they are, my grandson’s house will cost him $4.5 million dollars and his grandson will need to come up with $45 million dollars. Inflation is a tax. A hidden tax that steals from Americans created by a centralized shadow government.
1326236825518821378 2020-11-11 02:54:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ ...every 50 years. I reiterate, prices in America now increase 10 times every 50 years. My grandparents could buy a nice house in 1915 for $3,316. My parents could buy a similar one in 1965 for $45,000. A house for me and mine today though would cost $450,000.
1326236095659569153 2020-11-11 02:51:40 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ They do not allow the country to audit them. Meaning, America does not get to see how much of our money they have printed. Even though with each bill they print, inflation soars. At the current rate of inflation, which many believe is modest,  things go up in price 10 times...
1326235602900180992 2020-11-11 02:49:42 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ Many people believe that The Federal Reserve is a part of the government, but it is not. It is a private bank. The FED is not a government institution. It is as Federal, as Federal Express. The individuals involved with the FED though have interesting arrangement with America.
1326230074258055168 2020-11-11 02:27:44 +0800 <carolinasassie> The America dollar today—it takes 98 of them to buy what 1 dollar did in 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was enacted into law. That is theft or otherwise known as inflation which is a legacy of the FED. It is also the Fifth Plank of the Communist Manifesto; the central bank.

1326215248270004224 2020-11-11 01:28:49 +0800 <carolinasassie> @JohnJHarwood One of these is not like the others One of these just doesn't belong Can you tell which one is not like the others By the time I finish my song? Did you guess which one was not like the others? Did you guess which one just doesn't belong? Did you guess which one has no schlonge?
1326209208468070405 2020-11-11 01:04:49 +0800 <carolinasassie> @Sweeps2032 Google is biased?
1326207918493085696 2020-11-11 00:59:42 +0800 <carolinasassie> Truth found in the courtroom does not undermine confidence since it requires disclosure, unless you are trying to hide something. What are democrats trying to hide?
1326206494971482114 2020-11-11 00:54:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> 10/Trump knows the enemy &amp; he knows America. Thus, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself &amp; if you know your enemy, victory will be gained. Communists are immoral. They cannot relate to moral Americans. They don’t understand; WE WILL #HoldTheLine!  https://t.co/y2oFg7DVBs
1326202424818888704 2020-11-11 00:37:52 +0800 <carolinasassie> 9/ They are undermining @realDonaldTrump and silencing the will of the American People by using the Cloward-Piven strategy(2 Communists Professors from Columbia) to torpedo the American Election System so that we do not trust the election results. I trust Trump. Not CommieJoe!  https://t.co/Gs0V1RUhcn
1326201025276022786 2020-11-11 00:32:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> 8/ Along the way they created an Army of Useful Idiots and installed them in key positions of authority. They never thought they’d lose the 2016 election, but when they did, they amped up the propaganda machine to full power. Now, they are creating world class political illusion.
1326200364958412801 2020-11-11 00:29:41 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/  Obama needed a partner in crime for his running mate, so along came Biden. He was someone that could be trusted to be the point man for the regime so they could manipulate, deceive, infiltrated, &amp; undermine America with no resistance whatsoever.
1326199711972331526 2020-11-11 00:27:05 +0800 <carolinasassie> 6/ Saul Alinsky, one of their most promising disciples preached “dropping in &amp; taking over.”  Interesting enough, he dedicated his first book, Rules for Radicals to Satan. He was a big influence on a gentleman by the name of Wade Rathke, who founded Acorn. Acorn brought us Obama.
1326198837023748096 2020-11-11 00:23:36 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ But in particular they focused on corrupted the youth of America through the universities. The public school system was subverted once they gained control of Teacher’s Unions, which allowed them to control the curriculum being taught in schools.
1326198344771891200 2020-11-11 00:21:39 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ Once the left began killing their offspring, (innocents), you’d think the ideology of Communism would eventually die out in America, but in fact the exact opposite has occurred. Cultural Marxism has allowed the saturation of the ideology into every aspect of American society.
1326196586238652416 2020-11-11 00:14:40 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/  So they did. Eugenics was introduced to the country by the left. After they convinced women it was their right to kill their children through the Feminist Movement. Whose leader by the way, Betty Friedan, was a Communist as well. But that fact was hidden until the 1990s.
1326193432587608065 2020-11-11 00:02:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ “The issue is always the revolution.”  Communists are masters of deceit that have used their propaganda machine so successfully, they actually accomplish the greatest feat in warfare. They have convinced us they no longer exist, which has given them carte blanche to subvert.
1326192863030501377 2020-11-10 23:59:52 +0800 <carolinasassie> #HoldTheLinePatriots #NotMyPedoPresident   1/ The most fundamental thing you have to know to ever win a battle of subversion, is your enemy. One of the radical Marxist leaders of the 1960s I think gave us the key to what we are facing today. He said, The issue is never the issue.  https://t.co/pp8iU5lVlA

1326182973696331776 2020-11-10 23:20:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> Imagine if you will, a land where Democrats are so delusional that they use a man who needs to be in a full-time healthcare facility, to explain their thoughts about healthcare to America.   Oh, wait!  You don’t have to imagine, Welcome to the Surreal World of American Politics.

1326168772974174208 2020-11-10 22:24:09 +0800 <carolinasassie> @MartinHayes6 I made a thread because there are numerous sources. The NY Times article is skewed left, but the fact remains they verified Arizona was too close to call. Look at the entire thread under the first tweet and judge for yourself. Have a great day.
1326165941877665793 2020-11-10 22:12:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> Thirty States have disenfranchised voters by using a corrupted software, meaning this case will be going to the Supreme Court. Thank you for the article @Kalozap.  https://t.co/OXnB8jzZqQ
1326161248933859328 2020-11-10 21:54:15 +0800 <carolinasassie> @tnacgal I added the links from where I got the information. Bondi removed her tweet because she said Pennsylvania reversed their call, but they had never made the call, so it was factually inaccurate. Real clear politics never called Pennsylvania for Biden. Just the rogue news networks.
1326160128865873921 2020-11-10 21:49:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> @SherrySandorKLY @teachertwit2 The articles supported my statement. I stand by it and I did not lie. Regardless of the whiny socialist that you are responding to and her unstable feelings.

That is my best guess. It is some weird illusion they are orchestrating. Why? That is a valid question we should all ask. Why can’t we trust the press in America?
1326150276483584003 2020-11-10 21:10:39 +0800 <carolinasassie> @106OL I showed proof of where I got the sources of information. Review them in the thread and determine for yourself. The times article is skewed left, but the important information is that Arizona is too close to call.
1326147739915345920 2020-11-10 21:00:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> @ck2202ck I’m just extremely sarcastic in nature. Sorry. I meant no I’ll will. It is good news. I added the links for the various sources to show everyone where I got the information. I’m sorry if I came across rude. I’m honestly just playful. Apologies if I offended you. Have a great day.
1326145845595680768 2020-11-10 20:53:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> @privateofficer @Marlene45MAGA I made a thread for y’all to show the various sources of information. But it took me a few minutes. Just review the links that I posted. The NY Times article is skewed left, but the fact that is important in it is that Arizona is not called.

Real clear politics never called it for Biden in Pennsylvania. Wisconsin flipped to Trump. Arizona, they took the call away bc Trump is now the projected winner. Georgia, glitches.
1326139249071181825 2020-11-10 20:26:50 +0800 <carolinasassie> Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have all been removed from Biden’s projected win column as of this morning. And if truth be know, if all 50 states were audited, I’m pretty sure Biden would have 0 electoral votes.

1326131515823190016 2020-11-10 19:56:06 +0800 <carolinasassie> Real clear politics never gave Pennsylvania to Biden. They are the clearinghouse that sends out the vote totals and supporting statistics for the television station to announce. But the television networks went rogue this election cycle and called it. Which was a huge deviation.
1326129922256105474 2020-11-10 19:49:46 +0800 <carolinasassie> @FeralFox3 @KeishaJake Real clear politics never gave Pennsylvania to Biden.

1325945821746122753 2020-11-10 07:38:13 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/  Including consequences from their own actions, and that is exactly what makes it dangerous. It makes it treacherous because it fosters the illusion that our actions do not have consequences, and when they do have consequences, it’s the fault of some “glitch” in the system.
1325944277088792577 2020-11-10 07:32:05 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ Democrats though keep elevating their expectations about existence to the therapeutic level, that is a level of feelings. They simply desire to be well fed and safe. But now they want to be happy, continually, while feeling no regret, or an sort of negative consequences.
1325943326462373889 2020-11-10 07:28:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/ The technological improvement of people's lives, is now at a level that would only have been imagined in fantasies for past generations. These improvements have helped to create the illusion for people that the normal vicissitudes of existence, just don't count for us anymore.

1325900795729108994 2020-11-10 04:39:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/ We are told that we live in a free world, while everything we do is controlled to some extent. For thousands of years this system has been built, slowly consuming our true nature. Many are happy in their state of delusion, but every now and then a rogue appears.
1325900509400756225 2020-11-10 04:38:10 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/  Often the metaphors are ignored or misunderstood. The truth is simple, Mankind has stepped out of a natural state of existence and walked blindfolded into a world of insanity. We are force-fed information, drugs, poisoned food, and told we should feel lucky.
1325900266986680320 2020-11-10 04:37:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ From religious leaders, to company executives, from politicians to secret military elites, everything we do say and even think is scrutinized. There have been many books and films that have attempted to reveal the stupidity of the so-called reality we have created.
1325899894054383619 2020-11-10 04:35:43 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/ Life is a lie. You are being manipulated from birth to death. Your life is...a false reality.

(Please disregard her presentation though. The manufacturer were supposed to package her so that she would have cum reclined.) 😁
1325657376666619905 2020-11-09 12:32:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> 7/Some are celebrating, the rest are watching the show.   The morale of this story is—You can't reason somebody out of something, they didn't reason their way into in the first place. You can only #HoldTheLine while people figure out what is going on right in front of their eyes.
1325655080050319360 2020-11-09 12:22:55 +0800 <carolinasassie> And so, seeing it turns out is not always accurate. You don't always see the world as it is. Right now, we see the world celebrating an imaginary Presidential victory, because they have to distract the world from their very real crime spree across America.   But, It didn’t work!
1325654057088929795 2020-11-09 12:18:51 +0800 <carolinasassie> 5/ Then, make them reappear out of thin air. But they are not really making this happen. Right? They're using our natural tendencies in terms of perception, like visual perception. In terms of paying attention to certain things &amp; ignoring others, and they're playing on those.
1325653459354447874 2020-11-09 12:16:28 +0800 <carolinasassie> 4/And so humans have tons &amp; tons of different cognitive problems in terms of memory &amp; perception, where we're very easily fooled. If you don't believe this, then you can go to a magician &amp; you can have them do some magic tricks for you. And they can make things disappear for you.

1325651846162227200 2020-11-09 12:10:04 +0800 <carolinasassie> 3/ It sure doesn't seem that way, you know, especially if I glance at the sun. It really does appear that the sun is moving throughout the sky and not me.   Sometimes things are just not what they seem and the press knows this, which is deceptive, but misleading the public pays.
1325650556740915201 2020-11-09 12:04:56 +0800 <carolinasassie> 2/ And so most of us just accept the things we see. But, perception is tricky. For example, it seems like the earth is still. If I'm sitting down in a chair, I'm not moving. But in reality, I'm hurdling on a giant rock through outer space, hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.
1325649501038796805 2020-11-09 12:00:45 +0800 <carolinasassie> 1/Watching the 🌎 celebrate an imaginary Presidential victory has made me think about one of the interesting things about people &amp; that is, we have what's called, naive realism. So in other words, when a person looks at the 🌎 they are naturally inclined to believe what they see.

1323332124859109386 2020-11-03 02:32:19 +0800 <carolinasassie> @carolyn_from @realDonaldTrump I stated a fact that Biden supports Marxists.

In the 2nd tweet, you created a supposition to demean. Suppositions are not logical. Nor is begging the question, which is the fallacy category that your supposition falls under.

They depend on oil, in order to stay lubricated so they can spin.  Then, the wind tower has to be replaced every 15-20 years.

1319600386953674753 2020-10-23 19:23:43 +0800 <carolinasassie> Kindness cannot be quarantined. Reach out and help others. If you have the power to make someone happy, do it. Be a vessel, so others see a change; be the difference, or be the inspiration. Shine your light as an example. The world needs more of that. Be kind, kindness matters.  https://t.co/VW5qSdmYI6

1319476394460577796 2020-10-23 11:11:01 +0800 <carolinasassie> @Millerita Biden stole that line from Obama circa 2008.
1319473379896971265 2020-10-23 10:59:03 +0800 <carolinasassie> @qtipz45 @HandsomeSean1 He advocated for a Nanny state all night.

1319468117886750734 2020-10-23 10:38:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden did not get anyone in America a chance, except Hunter, in 47 years of public services, but if you give him a do-over, he will get finally get you a chance.
1319467170397589505 2020-10-23 10:34:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden is going to destroy the oil industry, but improve the economy.
1319465760859750405 2020-10-23 10:28:46 +0800 <carolinasassie> Marxists groups endorsing Marxism really isn’t impressive, Joe.
1319465454276993029 2020-10-23 10:27:33 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden takes Wall Street money, so it’s really no surprise that Wall Street supports Joe’s plan. They want him in power, so they can make more money!
1319463263533498369 2020-10-23 10:18:51 +0800 <carolinasassie> Abraham Lincoln is a racist according to Biden!
1319462850272894976 2020-10-23 10:17:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> Lying Joe Biden wants you to believe he is honest.   That’s too much. Lmao.
1319462523238862848 2020-10-23 10:15:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> Kamala and Joe have been throwing people in jail for drugs since they’ve been in office, except for Hunter that is, but now he is going to help people suffering from addiction.
1319462216115113984 2020-10-23 10:14:41 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden doesn’t know what Trump said or when he said, but if you go to Biden’s website, it’s there somewhere, according to Biden.
1319460949246574593 2020-10-23 10:09:39 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden is race baiting now.
1319460289558044675 2020-10-23 10:07:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden just said he was President of the USA and not VP!
1319459681371377667 2020-10-23 10:04:37 +0800 <carolinasassie> Obama built the cages!
1319458900962312194 2020-10-23 10:01:31 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden doesn’t see Red states and Blue states (a line he stole from Obama circa 2008) because Democrats don’t want to take responsibility for the messes they are making in Democrat run states.
1319457712611250177 2020-10-23 09:56:47 +0800 <carolinasassie> There are no words to describe the overwhelming level of irony involved in Biden accusing Trump of being a confused guy.
1319456852124618753 2020-10-23 09:53:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> If you get sick and lose your home insurance, you’ll be in trouble, according to Biden.
1319456232688803840 2020-10-23 09:50:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> Bidencare sounds ominously like a new name for sniffing and groping children.
1319454933465387009 2020-10-23 09:45:45 +0800 <carolinasassie> If Biden wants to talk about thugs, we should talk about Hunter.
1319454368895275008 2020-10-23 09:43:30 +0800 <carolinasassie> This is a foreign policy debate, and Biden is shaming Trump for not taking about domestic policy. The man is nuts.
1319453964530831361 2020-10-23 09:41:54 +0800 <carolinasassie> Are we really expected to believe #ChinaJoeBiden is going to be hard on China?
1319453003938758656 2020-10-23 09:38:05 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden forgot to mention he is under investigation in the Ukraine.
1319451569423790080 2020-10-23 09:32:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden did not take a dime from another country, because Hunter did, and he took it from Hunter.
1319450985928982532 2020-10-23 09:30:03 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden doesn’t know who he is, let alone who Russia is, but he does know where the money comes from in Russia.
1319450563860434945 2020-10-23 09:28:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> Whoever interferes with American sovereignty and elections will pay a price according to Biden, but China has to pay their price directly to Hunter.
1319449219435057153 2020-10-23 09:23:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden just admitted that if you are a business owner, he is going to make your life harder and force more expenses on your business in the name of COVID.
1319448365940281344 2020-10-23 09:19:39 +0800 <carolinasassie> Bidens just admitted that he wants to control you and give your money away.
1319447843401310208 2020-10-23 09:17:34 +0800 <carolinasassie> Joe, you cannot see an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning, if it is already evening.
1319447516904083456 2020-10-23 09:16:16 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden is a Communist China Apologist.  He cannot be the President of America.
1319446535193624577 2020-10-23 09:12:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden is a tyrannically politicizing 😷 politician.

1319393462861680642 2020-10-23 05:41:29 +0800 <carolinasassie> @kmacbean123 I thought it had something to do with making new threads(breads) on the boards. If you let them go on too long they become unmanageable.  They're supposed to cut the threads at 7,(???). Something posts, then start a new one and archive the old one.

I mean, essentially, aren’t bots most effective if they actually have followers?   Is the programmer just really bad at programming?
1319383778175930374 2020-10-23 05:03:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> @ghostwolfman @monsieurmiyagi @iamthejulz @isaceb @seanmdav @FDRLST It’s the inferiority complex issues that compel the self-destructive behavior. It’s part of the imaginary audience fallacy that coincides with delayed adolescence. It’s sad if you think about it. The lack of ability to compose logical thought is a sure 🔥 strategy to end up lost.
1319381560227991558 2020-10-23 04:54:11 +0800 <carolinasassie> @ghostwolfman @monsieurmiyagi @iamthejulz @isaceb @seanmdav @FDRLST If he was the least bit interesting of a narcissistic personality, you know, I would have played with them more extensively. But they were so low energy they had nothing to offer me personally. I can get my 12 year old to act like a 12 year old. I don’t need to find someone else.
1319379282276323329 2020-10-23 04:45:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> @ghostwolfman @monsieurmiyagi @iamthejulz @isaceb @seanmdav @FDRLST Sadly, I don’t think he has the first clue that is the case. It so strange to talk with people that emote in order to communicate. It’s such a non-normative thought process, that I find those individuals exhausting to be around. The delayed adolescent state is so off putting.

You’re too ignorant to sell your act. I can see that you cannot compose a logical thought. All you have to do is converse with you. I’m sorry that you failed yourself. It must be horrible. I’ll pray for you. God bless.

You have nothing intelligent to offer a conversation with me. So please don’t be offended, but I find you boring and déclassé. So I am going to bid you adieu. Have a good day.

Do no one teach you that thinking doesn’t include your emotions?

But as people generally assign the meanings to them, they’d assign to themselves, we are learning all about your pretend virtuoso act.   Good try. But you are not very quick witted. It’s not hard to outthink you.

Are you that needy for a narcissistic vampiric fix?   I don’t care what you do in regards to your personal views on gender. I’m in charge of me, not you. You do you, I’ll do me.

A person that appears to align herself with the right and whom he is stereotyping. I understand colloquial southernisms. Thank you.

It’s the science of revolution, or as Marx thought the science of human societal evolution. Through each attempt to establish a Socialist, nazi, fascist, communist state, etc. the revolutionary theory evolved. That’s what the democrats use.

It’s because, Marx saw farmers as conservative sacks of potatoes, not a real class. Instead, they were sunk in rural idiocy, a fading class.

1314935434892521473 2020-10-10 22:26:52 +0800 <carolinasassie> @MaeWunder I found the link this morning. They were release last night, but it’s only a partial list of the emails on Weiner’s computer which contained over 675,000. There are more to release. Some of these are still redacted, too. Annoying. There are 35, 575 emails in all in this batch.
1314931090910478339 2020-10-10 22:09:36 +0800 <carolinasassie> @rangermonk1 The link is provide for validity in the second tweet.
1314930866993467393 2020-10-10 22:08:43 +0800 <carolinasassie> @jessix They shouldn’t hold the office of Sec. of State if they can’t meet the demands of the position. It’s really that simple. Breaking the law while holding the position they accepted isn’t something that I empathize with, as it’s corrupt. They could’ve resigned &amp; had lots of privacy.
1314928954403422212 2020-10-10 22:01:07 +0800 <carolinasassie> @13thethe @9MMsDancing Thank you! Exactly.

1314925603389411329 2020-10-10 21:47:48 +0800 <carolinasassie> @9MMsDancing @13thethe I challenge you to do your own work, as I already discovered a crime and put the information on twatter. You emoted. Those are two different approaches to thinking. Mine was logical. Yours, well, it was different from mine. So obviously, YOU need to learn, as I’m already engaged.
1314924763563937797 2020-10-10 21:44:28 +0800 <carolinasassie> @9MMsDancing @13thethe Felonious politicians conspiring to evade federal laws are a nothing burger to you, eh? To each his own.

1314917350018351104 2020-10-10 21:15:00 +0800 <carolinasassie> @KeepTheBannerGo @Jim_Jordan They are newly released. Sorry, I need to learn to communicate better. They are just not all of the emails. They were released last night. But someone didn’t listen &amp; some I want to read are redacted. But they are new emails that have not been seen by the public until last night.
1314916584855670785 2020-10-10 21:11:58 +0800 <carolinasassie> @Pethtelcc23 @SandraLindquis8 Thank you. I just got off a suspension for telling TOO much truth. I’m trying to be more Twatter friendly for the health and safety of my audience. Bc I have been deemed abusive to the general public, by the nazis trying to control the narrative, so they can shift it to the left.
1314915061727723520 2020-10-10 21:05:55 +0800 <carolinasassie> @janeengracer Part of the emails, and some are still redacted. I should have been more clear, but I’ll admit, I was half asleep when I wrote the tweet. Apologies.
1314914669228953600 2020-10-10 21:04:21 +0800 <carolinasassie> @Gingersnap_ The fake toppling of the Saddam Hussein statue that kicked off the Iraqis War, which he helped orchestrate, did it for me. The press was all over the toppling. They never mentioned the fact that it was proven to have been faked by a group from the USA that the cia flew to Iraq.
1314913770649661440 2020-10-10 21:00:47 +0800 <carolinasassie> @ReduxVernon @SteveScully It’s time for a right-wing version, or preferably a non-partisan organization with a mandate to inform bilaterally.

Everyone of those emails is public record, and they still won’t let us see them by Presidential order. Wtf?
1314900015547125760 2020-10-10 20:06:08 +0800 <carolinasassie> The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) 2nd moderator @SteveScully Twitter account was “hacked” yesterday. Then, yesterday evening, the 3rd debate moderator disabled her account when it was revealed she was an activist. America needs to have a conversation about CPD’s bias.  https://t.co/HzjSLkvtRs

1314891751816134658 2020-10-10 19:33:17 +0800 <carolinasassie> Colin Powell admittedly explained to Hillary in an email how to evade State Department security protocols that were established for a ‘freakin reason.

1314026475130159104 2020-10-08 10:14:59 +0800 <carolinasassie> Kamala is loathsomely repugnant.
1314024474229043201 2020-10-08 10:07:02 +0800 <carolinasassie> Kamala is repulsive.
1314023019518582787 2020-10-08 10:01:15 +0800 <carolinasassie> A bounty is what Iran and Russian had on American soldier’s head under Obama and Biden.   Kamala is liar!
1314022780506124293 2020-10-08 10:00:18 +0800 <carolinasassie> The smugness and pomposity of Kamala when she had the audacity to scream Russia, Russia, Russia after Hunter just walked off with $3.5 million from Moscow’s mayor’s wife, tells you everything that you need to know about the crazy bat.

1313892935352582146 2020-10-08 01:24:21 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden has an attention deficit disorder.   If people aren’t paying attention to him, his disorders emerge.

1313889483977363456 2020-10-08 01:10:38 +0800 <carolinasassie> @WhipLash347 It is a complete non sequitur. “Pure evil” kicked in someone’s Baader Meinhof Complex and now the words are triggering faulty associations. It’s where illogicality meets irrationality.

1313887601527578625 2020-10-08 01:03:09 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden just got Putin’s endorsement.  We now know, the Communists are heavily invested in Biden &amp; evidently want a return on their $3.5 million. Bc Putin is now praising the ‘ideological’ links between Democrats &amp; Soviet Communism. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin  https://t.co/8gWmVcHyDh

The warmonger’s warmongering fuels the revolution. Revolutions are messy things and they lead to suffering and death. But it’s all part of the plan.

He should tell her, not to be a hoe. Then, she won’t be identified as a hoe. Seems like that’s the Christian thing to do.   No?

She is not a model. Therefore, Harris doesn’t need to have her heels up and be nude. But she does it anyway for political favors. You, Virtue signaling trolls are so daft.

1313514785372286976 2020-10-07 00:21:43 +0800 <carolinasassie> @PhDtoDO It would make her a model, dummy. Not a hoe, like Harris who was trying to gain political favor. You bots are daft.

1313511927646228486 2020-10-07 00:10:22 +0800 <carolinasassie> @itsmelisalis You appear to be attempting to project your racism onto me. I’m sorry you are a racist. I’m not though. It must suck to be you. She is a hoe that threw her heels up, to obtain her political “positions.” So you might be obsessed with race, but don’t project your failures onto me.
1313510941917622274 2020-10-07 00:06:27 +0800 <carolinasassie> @TyroneMatthew3 She ain’t screwing herself into a political position. She is modeling. Those are two very different things. Modeling requires nudity, sometimes. Politics doesn’t. Therefore, Heels up Harris is the Hoe!   But good try, loser.

Marxism leads to socialism, which leads to communism. Then it is expressed in different ways geographically. ie Maoism, Stalinism, Fascism.

But Biden, he never gets called out by the media on his made up words, that literally don’t exist, because they have no meaning.

1312742755874017280 2020-10-04 21:13:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> Biden has been very busy producing memorable gaffes, so it seems like a good time to compile a thread of them from the campaign trail. I should note, however, that there are multiple examples of Biden not knowing which state he is in. So, to keep it short, I’ve only included 7.

1312482351566393344 2020-10-04 03:59:12 +0800 <carolinasassie> @sandy45_2020 That’s not Epstein and it’s Lake Como. Your entire premise is faulty.

I just found it last week when we were messing around. They have stats and everything. @joyinliberty, @HandsomeSean1 has reimagined this as Alaska’s version of Sumo Wrestlemania.
1312070673989341187 2020-10-03 00:43:20 +0800 <carolinasassie> @HandsomeSean1 @joyinliberty At the same time, the older bears lose their status. It’s an ecosystem that will equilibrate, so that it stays balanced. Older bears will lose dominance due to age. Meaning, they cannot defend their territory, get less food, with age. That makes them lose rank and weight.
1312069600096514048 2020-10-03 00:39:04 +0800 <carolinasassie> @HandsomeSean1 @joyinliberty They shift in weight &amp; dominance throughout the years. So theoretically, the weight is determined by the level of submission. Chunk is submissive to 4 bears, so theoretically lighter. But it’s gaming style, too. Each year he becomes more dominant. Thus weight rises or he’s meaner

Maybe you’d have gotten out of there if you’d learned 1 simple concept: logic doesn’t have feelings &amp; feelings do have logic. Try learning, Private. Then maybe, you’ll grow.
1312008261894393856 2020-10-02 20:35:20 +0800 <carolinasassie> @CaporalGroulx Your appeal to authority argument is illogical. Leadership is grounded in logic &amp; not emotions. Career privates stuck in the mess hall are not leaders and as you show no aptitude for logic, I’ll conclude, you are not a leader. You’re too emotional. Logic doesn’t include emotions.

Both balance emotionalism. Would you rather someone think about problem &amp; solve it? Or someone feel about a problem &amp; create no real solutions? 1 is leadership.

1312002396348919808 2020-10-02 20:12:01 +0800 <carolinasassie> @CaporalGroulx She isn’t bringing safety to anyone dressing up in a costume. She’s engendering feelings according to you, but that’s not her job. She’s not a psychologist. Her job is to address Chicago’s priorities, like the murder rate. Playing dress up isn’t how politicians achieve that goal.

Your suppositions are not facts. They are your feelings. Your third grade opinion of her first grade attempt has no validity. Logic doesn’t appear to be something that you grasp.

Quit making assumptions. I went to the actual sources for the information and did not rely on a bias source. But cute straw man attempt. Those are fallacious though.
1309552847835607041 2020-09-26 01:58:23 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @SethAbramson Name the charges. You’ve danced around the question enough. You should have been able to answer it by now.   But remember...you cannot prosecute him if he is legally registered, so your point is moot.
1309552405915357184 2020-09-26 01:56:38 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @ghostwolfman @SethAbramson That’s not ad hominem. It’s a fact. But cute false dichotomy fallacy, ATTEMPT.  Those are fallacious though.   Try again.
1309552188964900867 2020-09-26 01:55:46 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @SethAbramson The articles are biased and not factually accurate as they are hearsay. Go the FBI notes where they state the actual facts of the matter. I don’t care about your irrelevant red herring sources.   What state charges have you concocted to charge him with?
1309551675053613062 2020-09-26 01:53:44 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @ghostwolfman @SethAbramson You control twitter? Quit virtue signaling as you are no virtuoso. I don’t care who you were talking to. I was talking to you.  The FBI notes admitted differently, but then again you wouldn’t find the truth in your news sources. Read the notes. Think for yourself, if you can.
1309550910801149955 2020-09-26 01:50:42 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @SethAbramson So? You are ignorant. The FBI notes found him not guilty until Obama ordered him to keep it open. The FBI stated “He was legally registered.” That’s a fact. Red herrings aren’t going to prove your point, as it is asinine.   There are no state charges that are applicable. Focus.
1309549663167614981 2020-09-26 01:45:44 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @SethAbramson Don’t give me an article that I am not going to pay to read. It does not defend your position.  State your position and prove it. And quit virtue signaling for attention.
1309548960449785856 2020-09-26 01:42:57 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @ghostwolfman @SethAbramson I do not care who you are, because you aren’t the topic of conversation.   The state crimes against Flynn that you want to file, are.   That was the question that I asked. Stay on point.   What state crimes is he guilty of committing?
1309548032636133376 2020-09-26 01:39:15 +0800 <carolinasassie> @QuantumxParadox @SethAbramson When?   A foreign agent is someone that acts without registering as a FARA agent. He was duly registered. Therefore, he was not guilty, nor would he have pled to being a foreign agent. That’s a federal crime too. 🙄 So, what state crimes have you ‘thunk’ up to charge him with?

Although factually he has no record of committing treason. Therefore, do you have a specific crime that you can qualify before you go digging around looking for one to pin on him?
1309536009240088579 2020-09-26 00:51:29 +0800 <carolinasassie> @LightworkerCain He had me at, “Now.”   He could have literally said anything and I would have listened, just to hear him talk. He is right, though. But what a smooth talker and such a nice voice.

You are projecting your ignorance. It is obvious that you need to read the laws. She stated facts. You had no rebuttal but emoting. That is even you can even interpret the laws on your own. Have someone help!
