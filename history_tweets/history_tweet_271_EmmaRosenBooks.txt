1341482191281410053 2020-12-23 04:34:12 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Annoying that Ingram Spark aren't offering Saddle Stitch anymore - I prefer a picture book that opens flat :( #indieauthor
1341399957933338627 2020-12-22 23:07:26 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @snowwhitereader Ah you see it's the other way round for me.
1341342375210340353 2020-12-22 19:18:37 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I've just finished reading this. Sea Room was a gift from my brother and his wife - they buy me lots of books üòÅüìöüíï  It's a good book but quite dense and I found it a bit hard going. I'd recommend if you're interested in Scottish history or archaeology.  What are you reading?  https://t.co/C9CjljeHuk

All I've got so far is opening the door to let the old year out (and I'll be opening it WIDE and giving 2020 a kick to help it out) #christmasisnotcancelled #tier4

I would love to have that this year. We need it. But it makes a mockery of months of care if we all suddenly socialise, surely? #Christmas2020

1325119677824184320 2020-11-08 00:55:25 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Amazing weather for November! I let the kids have a go on the SUP with me and they loved it ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Then I went out alone and actually managed to stand up a bit üòÆüòò. I wish I'd brought my rugged camera with me because the views were sensational out on the board.  #suplife  https://t.co/rOYhZSAqP9
1324738445663735809 2020-11-06 23:40:32 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Passed module 2 of breastfeeding counsellor training! It's a lot to process but so interesting
1324652990775676932 2020-11-06 18:00:58 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> In case you fancied listening to a sample of the audio of Lily the Limpet Gets Lost - still waiting for it to hit audible :)  https://t.co/EFxdJynEVp
1324291622012596224 2020-11-05 18:05:01 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> It would be so lovely to have a proper sound studio so I don't have to stop when the neighbours mow or my husband works in the garden
1324019138092826625 2020-11-05 00:02:16 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Please put me in touch with UK-based freelance editors for a children's picture book about breastfeeding. Looking for quotes at this stage :) #editors #editing #amwriting
1323998067004231680 2020-11-04 22:38:32 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Just built a shop page with @Bookshop_Org Go check it out and support indie bookshops and an indie writer (me)!  https://t.co/ROJtXl4hWf
1323984391765413889 2020-11-04 21:44:12 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> My heart is breaking over this today. If anyone knows what can be done there are still a few birds alive. Sophie still hasn't had any confirmation of a positive test and has to sit by while her birds are culled. We buy our chickens at this farm.
1323688383466639364 2020-11-04 02:07:58 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Another of the books Laura found by the side of the road...  This book has beautiful characterisation and made me extremely hungry...  üòÅ. I enjoyed the writing  but felt there was no real resolution at the end. I also felt it lost the Indian influence to the story.  https://t.co/goJTAQ3CeX
1323589495468511237 2020-11-03 19:35:01 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Just booked some illustration :D
1323368767984930821 2020-11-03 04:57:55 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> So sad. This is where we buy our chickens from.
1323353485144924161 2020-11-03 03:57:12 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> We had a lovely da out in Canterbury last week, so I blogged a bit of it and shared a haul of the bits we bought :)  https://t.co/AcRhsmvZGK  #canterbury #vlog #haul
1322960832624500745 2020-11-02 01:56:56 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I hate gendered clothing like this! My son is sick of the lack of colour. My daughter wants more variety of messages on her clothes. My smallest girl wants anything blue
1322955332180758528 2020-11-02 01:35:05 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I'm just writing my newsletter, sign up on  https://t.co/8W7CxpP9il if you'd like monthly updates from me - it even gives you access to some free printables from Lily the Limpet
1322864915280003072 2020-11-01 19:35:48 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I'm taking part in this local creative Christmas Market.

1322551473813757953 2020-10-31 22:50:17 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> A great read for a rainy Halloween.   I enjoyed the themes of motherhood, birth and women in society. The characters in this book are based on real people, about whom little is known. It's witchy without being scary. Trigger warning for miscarriage and abuse.  #halloweenreading  https://t.co/HJQQ1kXmOa

1322162745320579073 2020-10-30 21:05:37 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> When a relative on Facebook has the complete opposite opinions to you and you'd normally delete them but you can't on account of the relatedness and you don't want to start an argument with them again because of the ol' family tree.  https://t.co/6NXBT87qLl
1322149653853413376 2020-10-30 20:13:36 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Oooo, my daughter was Mary....
1322126974777761792 2020-10-30 18:43:29 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> What are your go to rainy day activities for kids? My 3 year old loves crafting, especially painting. But oh the clear up üò≥.  7 year old loves imaginative play and dancing. The 10 year old has to be prised away from Minecraft.   #halfterm #caughtredhanded  #messyplay #rainydays  https://t.co/razXnDcIDy
1321854099256651778 2020-10-30 00:39:10 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Thank you Tim!! You can still change expanded distribution if publishing wide suits your project better :)
1321808231036047361 2020-10-29 21:36:54 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> So I've cleaned, mopped and painted the landing - I think that's enough procrastination?
1321753103083966465 2020-10-29 17:57:51 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @Prof_AmyBrown At 36, I've just started to realise how much my metabolism has changed in the last year or two, and I am not having it.
1321752878290214914 2020-10-29 17:56:57 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @WhtVictoriaRead That's amazing, such a complex pattern!
1321752663051161600 2020-10-29 17:56:06 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Going running this morning was a real strain. One of those 'drag myself out and whinge all the way round' situations
1321184332099235842 2020-10-28 04:17:45 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Laid a new bathroom floor today and my hands now hate me

1318639729458511872 2020-10-21 03:46:25 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I dreamed last night that I went to visit the queen. She had loads of 'worlds best grandma' tat around in the palace. We chatted about lead roofs. Good times.
1318634075289227264 2020-10-21 03:23:57 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @SarahLouCow thanks!
1318501410808410117 2020-10-20 18:36:47 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Just had a practice call for my breastfeeding counsellor training. Hope it gets more like 'considered support' than 'blethering' :P

1316657620254707712 2020-10-15 16:30:13 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> It's simply not good enough
1316447935320727555 2020-10-15 02:37:00 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Not only was it in poor taste, but also used a photo uncredited with the dancer's name (Desiree) or the photographer (Krys Alex). Way to support the arts.
1316375627126145028 2020-10-14 21:49:41 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> The Five tells the stories of the victims of Jack the Ripper. Women whom history had often dismissed as prostitutes.

1313799047271112705 2020-10-07 19:11:16 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I was just editing the sequel to Lily the Limpet and cut this verse, but I still quite like it as a standalone.

1309120038482345993 2020-09-24 21:18:34 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I'm looking to recruit beta readers to take a look and give me their honest opinions on my 25,000 word non-fiction book (still being a bit secretive üòÅ)  I'd love authors of range of genres from different territories and with varying publishing strategies.

1308862195778936833 2020-09-24 04:13:59 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I've just seen a preview for this and it's soooo good! Local parents (deal and surrounding) please sign up - I'm exhibiting!!
1308839169221890048 2020-09-24 02:42:29 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> What video do you fancy this week?
1308791065932107777 2020-09-23 23:31:20 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Breaking Dawn is great - the culmination of the twists and turns in Bella's love triangle and immortal future. It's beautifully silly (seriously, Renesmee?) And that's why I love it!   I wish there were more action rather than discussions. I'd have loved a massive rumble.  https://t.co/C2UKnXbqkT

1307770593220145160 2020-09-21 03:56:21 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Next weekend (25th-27th September) I will have a stall at the Hythe Late Summer Market - my first event in.... well.... I can't remember.   If you're in the area please pop by!   https://t.co/HKIAOmJ0gA
1307709691871539200 2020-09-20 23:54:21 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Today I have mostly been pottering. Very needed.
1307369187808022528 2020-09-20 01:21:18 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I'm not sure about how the Mac Feegles would feel about our fairy house. I suspect they might kick it down for being pretend and lacking any booze.  I thought I'd read the Wee Free Men, but it wasn't all that familiar. I enjoyed it - it had the charm of some of my fave Pratchetts  https://t.co/MEYXPbz9q4
1307298529543675905 2020-09-19 20:40:32 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Chatty update video this week  https://t.co/ErnCU1ysOM

1306565234912563200 2020-09-17 20:06:41 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> When you actually *want* to record seagull sounds and the little shitehawks are being obnoxiously quiet.
1306520096525910016 2020-09-17 17:07:19 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Have you seen Extinction yet? If not, give it a watch. It's so good. Heartbreaking and informative. I sincerely hope things change #Extinction  https://t.co/oL5ayPJGhy
1305872317789220871 2020-09-15 22:13:17 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> You know what's fun? A child with a chronic asthmatic cough in a Corona virus pandemic.
1305855352693547009 2020-09-15 21:05:52 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @C_Heathcote Rambo and Renee. They ultimately escaped and never came back as had always been their intent.

1304756659856855041 2020-09-12 20:20:03 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Happy first birthday Lily.  The paperback came out a year ago today.  Hardback due in 10 days üíï #lilythelimpetgetslost #bookbirthday #firstbirthday #bookanniversary #limpet #lily  https://t.co/OTgOyFkrZg
1304485030031392770 2020-09-12 02:20:41 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> I've made a tutorial on formatting a hardback cover for Ingram Spark - check it out if you'd find it useful  https://t.co/Cp9DXjuC50 #IngramSparkAuthor
1304441214918369280 2020-09-11 23:26:35 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> So much cool stuff has happened today. Feel like I'm starting to run again.
1304367827336519680 2020-09-11 18:34:58 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Today I'm editing with the support of the voice of Mariah  Carey  https://t.co/c7boAsxG6B

1304048563186532357 2020-09-10 21:26:20 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Just got my husband to take an author headshot (because the one I was using was a weird crop I did from a professional photo of me and my kids). I like it - what do you think?  #headshot #authorheadshot #authorsofinstagram #photography #profilepic  https://t.co/c36cmkmUE1

1303663686951804929 2020-09-09 19:56:58 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Some people pay for expensive recording studios.  Other people combine their sound technology and den building abilities.

1303654076492775424 2020-09-09 19:18:47 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Why does my stomach need to be super noisy when I'm trying to record stuff?
1303406039178645504 2020-09-09 02:53:10 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Me: Zoe, I love you Zoe: I love daddy  3 year olds are savage

1303366300685791232 2020-09-09 00:15:16 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> First complete edit done. It's good - a few more edits and it'll be amaze-balls. (That's going in the blurb - amaze-balls new book from Emma Rosen)
1303320082332954625 2020-09-08 21:11:36 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @Prof_AmyBrown I'll give that a go tomorrow üòÅ

1303289697284878336 2020-09-08 19:10:52 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> How have I not read this before?   To Kill a Mockingbird is told through the eyes of Scout when her father, Atticus is made to defend a black man accused of rape. It's a snapshot of 1930s America and a commentary on race and society.  Beautiful storytelling and characterisation.  https://t.co/RGh13a7odL
1303245820368691201 2020-09-08 16:16:31 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> @dotrythisschool @BorisJohnson Ooo, I'll have a look at that

1301542485416652801 2020-09-03 23:28:04 +0800 <EmmaRosenBooks> Just wanted to show some to my first-born book baby. Milk started my writing career and it's the tale of my children's early years interwoven with everything I learned about breastfeeding and parenthood. It's experience, support, information and love wrapped in a book cover.  https://t.co/PvdXPaHY9s
