1343963078942199808 2020-12-30 00:52:22 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatriotActive66 This is actually true, I studied this as a case study A-level human biology. The results were mostly down to marrying close family members, also puts them at high risk of blood disorders, renal failure and diabetes type 1

1343926321739681792 2020-12-29 22:26:18 +0800 <LittleDi70> @sel2702 Also once part of Tigray People's Liberation Front, a left wing party which believed in Marxism. When they gained power in 1991, they started taking lands and massacred those who opposed.  In 1990’s US (allegedly) once considered them as terrorists.
1343925236685824004 2020-12-29 22:22:00 +0800 <LittleDi70> @sel2702 @BBCHughPym I already did at the beginning of the year.  Tedros a career politician who has never practiced as a medical doctor, has links with communism and wanted to appoint dictator Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador.  UN CCP Corruption, Gates is the financial force behind The WHO etc..

1343856949515923456 2020-12-29 17:50:39 +0800 <LittleDi70> @BBCHughPym Data is fudged, experts are now trying to say that Covid has dramatically reduced flu infections or it has suddenly disappeared due to so many people having the flu vaccine.  https://t.co/M89uj450Jf What a load of rubbish!

1343633420241526784 2020-12-29 03:02:25 +0800 <LittleDi70> @LesterEDrake @wilspin @SkyNews An EHIC is not a replacement for travel insurance. If you have a health condition you need to take out extra. Each healthcare system is different, some European countries don’t accept EHIC and treatment isn’t free.

1343584955268476929 2020-12-28 23:49:50 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SkyNews Travel insurance should be a legal  requirement when coming to this country however many entering believe if to be a  pre-requisite along with our benefits system healthcare and social care.

1343560246183256065 2020-12-28 22:11:39 +0800 <LittleDi70> @LadBonnie He should never be knighted. His EU policies are prime reason for Britain’s current mess.  He fabricated a dossier of lies to justify an illegal war whilst lying to parliament and not forgetting his commitment to PPI which has crippled the public sector with unsustainable debts.
1343550780444438528 2020-12-28 21:34:02 +0800 <LittleDi70> @Femi_Sorry It was the Common Market back then not the EU as we now know it and the UK never voted to join they voted to remain after Heath took our country in illegally. Know your history! Dimmer than a 3 watt light bulb!

1343531718414893057 2020-12-28 20:18:17 +0800 <LittleDi70> @Andrew_Adonis How many times do we need to remind ‘Remainers’ that we are not leaving Europe we are geographically still in Europe, we are leaving an oppressive dictating entity named the European Union!
1343505747213242368 2020-12-28 18:35:05 +0800 <LittleDi70> @XexorWeglin IMO China facilitated the spread of the virus across the globe that caused a devastating affect to the economies across the world, is it any wonder China is the only country that has major economic growth this year. They should be made to compensate.
1343502856100450307 2020-12-28 18:23:36 +0800 <LittleDi70> @LadBonnie We’re hated plain and simple, from being labelled far right, Nazis and racists to being prejudiced by saying white racism is real.  Politicians and the MSM have indicated for decades ‘WE’ don’t matter and pander to mass immigration at the expense of white working class.

1341786874537512961 2020-12-24 00:44:54 +0800 <LittleDi70> @FortyVictoria @SkyNews @BorisJohnson I’m aware of the 80% majority which came mainly from labour held seats. However under the Dublin 3/EU rule the UK have to accept illegal migrants, this will cease to apply to the UK at the end of the Brexit transition period.
1341783165640331274 2020-12-24 00:30:10 +0800 <LittleDi70> @FortyVictoria @SkyNews Even when illegals are due to be deported HR lawyers along with the liberal left stop them.
1341779615606583297 2020-12-24 00:16:04 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SkyNews Macron proved he’s no friend to Britain after banning travel he’s now saying people are allowed in if they test negative, Macron should  apply the same rules with illegals coming here. The EU can stop planes ships and ferries but we can't even stop poxy dinghies from coming.

1341097552238817286 2020-12-22 03:05:47 +0800 <LittleDi70> @johnisitme The government allegedly  knew about it back in September. All of Europe closed off to the UK yet it started in Spain.  This has got the EU written all over it.

There are indigenous citizens waiting to be housed who ‘should’ take precedence over anyone entering this country illegal or not.

Did you notice any media outside the court today?The difference is these kind of rapes are covered up and if reported only find their way into a small column in the local newspaper!

Only offering the UK a miserly 18% of EU fishing quotas out of 60% previously lowered from 80%.  The EU serves only itself and its continental counterparts.

UK exported £164bn of goods to the EU27 and imported £259bn, giving a deficit of £95bn in goods. Work it out.

The UK can set its own trade treaties and exit the single market which costs businesses tens of £10’s billions a year, which have saddled us with a £89 billion annual trade deficit. Prosperous EU, a few member states disagree.
1338176511074054144 2020-12-14 01:38:37 +0800 <LittleDi70> @theviewfromher2 @BorisJohnson I meant not articulate as in anything you’ve said. Keep up

1338171518845587457 2020-12-14 01:18:46 +0800 <LittleDi70> @theviewfromher2 @BorisJohnson Oh dear it doesn’t cover long term medical problems either ... Most UK citizens do not rely purely on EHIC when travelling in and around Europe.  Only sensible people do not travel without travel insurance.
1338168945950470144 2020-12-14 01:08:33 +0800 <LittleDi70> @theviewfromher2 @BorisJohnson You have totally dismissed everything I have said.  The UK is a full member of Interpol and leaving the EU will not affect that, you’re thinking of Europol.  The EHIC card is not an alternative to travel insurance. It does not cover any private care or existing health problems.

We also pay a subsidy of £16 bn annually to EU27 producers because of the EU’s tariff and NTB You must know the EU SM on goods also raise prices inside the EU above world levels because they create NTBs against imports from outside the EU.

EU’s tariffs are terrible for the UK they protect continental producers interests.  Also the high food tariffs are very damaging to us as a net food importing nation. I won’t over exasperate on the laughing faces!  FBPE 🙄

1337430165597663232 2020-12-12 00:12:54 +0800 <LittleDi70> @GaryDav67 Apart from being racist against whites.

1337374640877031425 2020-12-11 20:32:16 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatriotActive66 Yet she’s not against rioting looting vandalism and anarchy. BLM movement is everything to do with racism against whites. It’s not a crime to be white, however if they had their way it soon will be.

The logic of Labour would rather stick up for extremists and condemn anyone who respects their country enough to highlight the wrongs and speak up.

You haven’t a clue of the long term implications on health. Vaccines take 10-15 years to trial and regulate. #BigPharma follow the money!

A child safeguarding referral wasn’t documented on her risk assessment even though she was a risk to children. Neither her consultant psychiatrist or nurse were made aware of this.  This incompetence cost Emily her life.

From the Home office to psychiatric Drs and the courts.  To think our taxes are keeping that barbaric feral animal.

Covid is being registered on death certificates as primary cause when it should be secondary to those who already had a major underlying illness.

Many deaths occur for a number of reasons, flu pneumonia cancer sepsis organ failure heart attack stroke etc ... however if you test positive for covid this goes on your death certificate/data. Like I said misleading.

1335903315213873152 2020-12-07 19:05:44 +0800 <LittleDi70> @piersmorgan What are the figures for flu 2020? Covid ‘related’ deaths UK whole of 2020 - 61.000 Flu ‘related’ deaths winter 2018 - 61.200 COVID figures are being falsely inflated. The reason is to justify the hysteria/lockdown, this is less about a virus and more about control over humanity.

1335715259009667073 2020-12-07 06:38:28 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SamuelJohnsnon @Chris_Leigh_UK @JMPSimor Factual!  Any constitutional change requires a general election or a referendum, the electorate was denied this right, therefore the signing of the accession treaty in ‘73 was illegal.
1335706717812830211 2020-12-07 06:04:32 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatrickLeeson4 @JMPSimor I’m well aware. CFP was supposed to protect fish stocks without killing fishing communities.  The EU takes 40% of its catch by weight from the destruction of the UK fishing fleet. Our waters should be managed on a more local level not by EU.
1335700573119787010 2020-12-07 05:40:07 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SkyNewsBreak BS  The two sides are ‘close’ to agreeing terms on the level of access for EU boats to seas within the UK's 200-mile exclusive economic zone - not conclusive  UK government source has said there has been "no breakthrough on fishing", adding "Nothing new has been achieved today."
1335695174920450048 2020-12-07 05:18:40 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SamuelJohnsnon @Chris_Leigh_UK @JMPSimor UK wasn’t asked, Heath's Government breached the constitutional convention and took us in illegally.
1335692137808146442 2020-12-07 05:06:36 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatrickLeeson4 @JMPSimor Did you have the same empathetic view when our own fishing communities were destroyed. When British trawlers ceased fishing and UK fishermen lost their livelihoods?
1335680923644391428 2020-12-07 04:22:02 +0800 <LittleDi70> @a01chtra Well aware the history of the slave trade. We still should not be made to apologise. Why don’t they vent their anger to where slavery is still very much part of today’s society. UK politics and MSM pander to ethnic minorities sometimes at the expense of white working class.
1335668216220225536 2020-12-07 03:31:32 +0800 <LittleDi70> @Ronnie62597744 Looks like a dalek
1335655936220946440 2020-12-07 02:42:45 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatriotActive66 Unlucky!  Hope she enjoys sleeping in a tent and peeing in a bucket.
1335610408779059201 2020-12-06 23:41:50 +0800 <LittleDi70> @hunterathelen1 @MULUC9 Remember her Name  💕Emily Jones 💕🙏🏻 #JusticeForEmilyJones
1335608669078233100 2020-12-06 23:34:55 +0800 <LittleDi70> @GothNemi @KeyserSosse @TofuToni Easily avoided if the Home Office deported her in the first place.  Every organisation involved in this twisted horrific web of failings and lies have blood on their hands.
1335600602877923329 2020-12-06 23:02:52 +0800 <LittleDi70> @KeyserSosse @PatriotActive66 The court knew she told a nurse it was premeditated, she waited in a park and picked out Emily all of which is evident. Manipulator Skana conveniently used her mental health as an excuse to get away with murder!  An excuse often used to widely.   #JusticeForEmilyJones
1335591919511015424 2020-12-06 22:28:22 +0800 <LittleDi70> @PatriotActive66 The audacity of this man to us preach about our so called white privilege!  https://t.co/1XfwUskcy2
1335376566096945152 2020-12-06 08:12:38 +0800 <LittleDi70> @QueenNatLouise So sorry Nat ❤️ sincere condolences 🙏🏻
1335366250306932741 2020-12-06 07:31:38 +0800 <LittleDi70> @a01chtra This isn’t the case though  is it.  ‘Bending a knee’ is a submissive position which surrenders to authority power and control yet we are the ones constantly being reminded what our ancestors did and expected to apologise for it.  Don’t you see the problem here?
1335360465954856964 2020-12-06 07:08:39 +0800 <LittleDi70> @a01chtra @SkySportsNews BLM have fuelled a race divide which has become abhorrent and the MSM and politicians have exacerbate it. Keep it out of sports!  The lack of equal representation and selected MSM coverage is causing the  divide to widen.

1335317790601916419 2020-12-06 04:19:04 +0800 <LittleDi70> @FortyVictoria @LadBonnie 🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s true 😂

1335312091411083267 2020-12-06 03:56:26 +0800 <LittleDi70> @FortyVictoria @LadBonnie Remember all too well the heatwave of 76, lasted for a few months, Utd losing the FA and the silver jubilee.
1335310569419759618 2020-12-06 03:50:23 +0800 <LittleDi70> @SkySportsNews Football have  ‘kick it out’ There really is no need for them to support any Marxist movement!
1335307479287275521 2020-12-06 03:38:06 +0800 <LittleDi70> @LadBonnie I have some old photos from  walking days to street party’s. The end of WWll Queens coronation and silver Jubilee. Such a proud nation, every window dressed with our nations flag.
1335303987990568962 2020-12-06 03:24:14 +0800 <LittleDi70> 3-1 nice 3 points. Played awful in the 1st half, turned it around in the 2nd.  Marcus Rachford Man of the Match 😴 #WHUMUN
1335302099228389377 2020-12-06 03:16:43 +0800 <LittleDi70> @bruins_bb Players*
1335301798614151169 2020-12-06 03:15:32 +0800 <LittleDi70> @bruins_bb Agreed, plus Utd played were awful.

1335296989295161349 2020-12-06 02:56:25 +0800 <LittleDi70> #WHUMUN 2 in 3 mins, United have turned this around!
1335279079415799808 2020-12-06 01:45:15 +0800 <LittleDi70> @debatenothate2 I was waiting for the same when Utd kicked off but they did voice over commentary 👎🏻

1335250683042418691 2020-12-05 23:52:25 +0800 <LittleDi70> Should always take preference.
