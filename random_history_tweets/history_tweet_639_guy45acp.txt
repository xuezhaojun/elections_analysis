It‚Äôs going to have to establish a record for safety &amp; efficacy before I‚Äôll consider it. My wife is a nurse. She‚Äôs not getting it anytime soon. These are new vaccines with no actual testing. I‚Äôll let others play lab rat.

However I understand that vaccines, like any other drug or procedure, has certain risks. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt support mandates especially given vaccine manufacturers enjoy liability protections.

Worst part was loss of taste &amp; smell. Did feel rough for a few days though. My sister-in-law just found out yesterday that she has it. How can you advocate gov forcing people to incur unwanted risk?

I naturally keep my distance from people. I like my space so don‚Äôt worry about me. I‚Äôm not gonna breathe on you. I do find it funny watching people with masks touching their face then touching products.

I don‚Äôt trust DC. They have a well established history of screwing over the peasants. Politicians suck. The unelected bureaucracy sucks even more. It is about control though.

In the few locations that I must cover my face I wear a neck gaiter. You can pull it over your eyes &amp; easily navigate which means it does absolutely nothing except appease the health Nazis.

I do not support tyranny by government edict. Let those that can earn a living earn it. These lockdowns are evil, sadistic &amp; hypocritical.

I would see this country reset to the framework &amp; intent it was founded on. Others want the Great Reset which is financial, societal &amp; global. I side with individual liberty not the collective BS.

However taking a stand for ones convictions matters above all else. It is the precursor to both victory &amp; defeat. Better to have loved &amp; lost than never to have loved at all.

Every time the HP defrosts you need aux heat. The colder the ambient, the less heat expelled into the home &amp; more defrost cycles.

Sure There are tricks to get them to operate better at cold temps like using low ambient fan controllers or inverter units with variable speed fan(s). You can only extract so much heat from cold ambient air.

My line manager put a lot of trust in me on that.
1323830807732064258 2020-11-04 11:33:54 +0800 <guy45acp> @rachellebutt11 @denver_mccomb @PalaceQuandary @Bane_Returns I agree. I worked on an assembly line once. I welded drain pans for large industrial/commercial water cooled AC units. An engineer thought my work station would be more efficient if configured a certain way. Might've looked good on paper but, sucked in application.

1321940226017841156 2020-10-30 06:21:25 +0800 <guy45acp> @AOC I've got a tip for you. Go back to serving watered down drinks at a failed restaurant/bar.

I think Roberts may be more inclined to decide accordingly. Otherwise the Chief Justice could wind up writing a lot of dissenting opinions which wouldn't look so hot.

With that said, the life growing in the womb is just that, another life. Abortions outside of rape, incest, health are for convenience &amp; to escape consequences of the lack of personal responsibility.
1321933988882206720 2020-10-30 05:56:37 +0800 <guy45acp> @PalaceQuandary If someone really has to go to a restaurant that's complying with such anti American BS, use one of those cheap Hunter Biden special phones from 7/11 or Walgreen's. Pay for it in cash with your face covered. I'm assuming Hunter had a reason for suggesting using such phones.

Fact is, if anyone is hiding their political leanings &amp; choices, it's anyone who stands to lose something by broadcasting they voted for Trump/GOP.

1321834736441020418 2020-10-29 23:22:14 +0800 <guy45acp> @HKrassenstein No thanks. Biden, Harris &amp; Democrats are squarely against individual rights &amp; freedom. If anyone wholeheartedly supports their rights, they can't vote Democrat. It would be voting against their own interests.

1320575979094482944 2020-10-26 12:00:23 +0800 <guy45acp> @Timcast For starters Joe wouldn't make it long. He'd get booted fairly quick. Biden is a paper candidate.

1319668588744232962 2020-10-23 23:54:44 +0800 <guy45acp> @AOC It's because you nuts are simply wrong. Don't kid yourselves. I mean you guys don't even know what coyotes are.

1319666817959415810 2020-10-23 23:47:42 +0800 <guy45acp> @chuckhersey @scrowder Hank Johnson reference. Sadly another village idiot representing GA citizens.
1319662004802564102 2020-10-23 23:28:34 +0800 <guy45acp> @MikeVtine @BernieSanders The individual has no choice. It's government health insurance only. Do doctors/practices have bargaining power in such a system. Medicare currently doesn't negotiate.
1319661542879776774 2020-10-23 23:26:44 +0800 <guy45acp> @MikeVtine @BernieSanders I'm sorry. I didn't even say anything about socialized medicine. I'm speaking specifically to your claim that a free market would exist. You're wrong. M4A would abolish private health insurance. Means government would monopolize the sector. No competition. No free market.
1319657790655397889 2020-10-23 23:11:50 +0800 <guy45acp> @SciCommic @RepAdamSchiff Just maintaining good hygiene practices and etiquette will suffice. No need for masks. Certainly don't vote Democrat. Funny thing. The folks always talking about virus infection &amp; death numbers tend to ignore the human toll from being locked down &amp; social distancing.
1319655731189194755 2020-10-23 23:03:38 +0800 <guy45acp> @MikeVtine @BernieSanders Free market? There would be no free market in healthcare. Government would have a monopoly.
1319654665961852928 2020-10-23 22:59:25 +0800 <guy45acp> @Aresthetics @chillywillers @BernieSanders Easy to fund government healthcare when you don't have to worry much about military spending. I wonder how our allies would do should the US simply worry more about defending itself &amp; not the entire free world.
1319653943891341312 2020-10-23 22:56:32 +0800 <guy45acp> @LangbeinLisa @BernieSanders I don't want or need Medicare for all. Stop trying to speak for "all Americans" because, you don't. Question. Medicare doesn't negotiate pricing with doctors/practices. When the government fully controls healthcare, what bargaining power will docs/practices have?

For example, I know if Dems were in control &amp; packed the Court, 2A would be in serious jeopardy. That should scare anyone who holds their rights dear. It's why I would NOT comply with ANY of Biden's gun control garbage should he win.

Because precedent would've been set, what's to stop Republicans from further packing the Court? Next thing you know we have 30 Justices. Go ahead &amp; axe the filibuster while you're at it. It'll never come back to bite Dems. See Reid.
1319277397871529988 2020-10-22 22:00:17 +0800 <guy45acp> @RepAdamSchiff Fine. Stay home. Don't need Dems to get it done anyway.

1316467997251375104 2020-10-15 03:56:43 +0800 <guy45acp> @Cointuckeywind1 My guess is that, if the cops ever have to take stock of your handgun for whatever reason, you'd better have the number of permits to cover in the books. I don't live there so I really haven't researched that. Everything I've said is just based off what I found in short order.
1316467107102707720 2020-10-15 03:53:11 +0800 <guy45acp> @Cointuckeywind1 It's a "backdoor" registry. There is no record pertaining to the actual firearm. My weapon permit is "backdoor" in the same way. GA has no registry but, they know who wants to carry. You can transfer provided the transferee has obtained a permit. $5 per permit + $3 processing.

Docs/practices have bargaining power as it relates to negotiating prices with insurance companies. When government is the only game in town, what happens to that bargaining power?

Funny you compare hypothetical numbers for M4A against the ironically named Affordable Care Act that Democrats unilaterally shoved down America's throat. Government has no authority to control healthcare. Period.

1316054473727451136 2020-10-14 00:33:32 +0800 <guy45acp> @Bookworm @iimdonee @JoeBiden Actually it is infringed. I can't buy certain firearms/attachments without registering &amp; paying a tax. I must pay the State 2 carry a firearm. Why is 2A treated like a "red  headed step child" among our rights? I bet folks would be screaming if citizens were charged a fee to vote
1316053496848879616 2020-10-14 00:29:39 +0800 <guy45acp> @Bookworm @iimdonee @JoeBiden If Democrats think I'm going to register my firearms or participate in a "buyback", they're sorely mistaken. Given the huge increase in firearm &amp; ammunition purchases due to COVID fears &amp; BLM/Antifa rioting as well as the coming Barrett confirmation, I think gun control is dead.

We're trying to do studies in real time that influence policy which is problematic in the least. Studies typically take time &amp; debate to pass the test. We're not seeing that here.
1313878900343296000 2020-10-08 00:28:35 +0800 <guy45acp> @sofka_juyne I mean that's great &amp; all but, sounds more like a distraction.

We're talking about a virus that the overwhelming majority of people recover from, if they even get sick at all. I worry more about the driver fooling with their phone or infotainment system.

Variables are important. Were these sick stylists shedding enough to even infect clients during their limited interactions? Exposure matters. You can visit a sick person with the flu &amp; not get sick.
1313848726067310593 2020-10-07 22:28:41 +0800 <guy45acp> @LilyLovelyLily1 @christianllamar @KamalaHarris Just with an obstruction like masks/face coverings, you create more pressure especially, if you're exerting yourself. Sure. The mask may catch a minute amount of contamination on the initial moment of exhale but, once pressure is made, any small particles get jettisoned out gaps.
1313847583757021185 2020-10-07 22:24:08 +0800 <guy45acp> @LilyLovelyLily1 @christianllamar @KamalaHarris As someone who understands airflow, the mask does very little regarding viruses especially, if they're aerosolized. Airflow in a pipe, for example, is greatest in the middle &amp; least at the structure. Air, like water, always takes the path of least resistance.

No. In fact, unless you're frequently changing masks/face coverings, you literally have a Petri dish on your face.

1311399415492509698 2020-10-01 04:15:59 +0800 <guy45acp> @riotshenanigans @thehill The "boyfriend loophole" is usually touted as the reason but, that's low hanging fruit &amp; negotiable at that. The "red flag" style gun confiscation with its denial of 2A rights, due process &amp; presumption of innocence is the big reason.

1311314145640353793 2020-09-30 22:37:10 +0800 <guy45acp> @BretBaier Trump did pretty good in the debate. He was against Wallace &amp; #SloppyJoe.

My individual rights are the number 1 priority in determining who gets my vote. Will a Biden administration further infringe on my 2A right through bans, mandatory "buybacks" (confiscation) among other things?

How many times does it take for you guys to get it? Trump passed justice reform, guaranteed fed funding for HBCUs &amp; proposed $500B to spur black business. Biden passed his '94 crime bill.

Trump called out the white racists right after Charlottesville, for example. Trump's record speaks for itself. Why didn't Obama guarantee funding for HBCUs? But Trump's racist. üòí

That segment attempted to lend credibility to the exhausting &amp; thoroughly debunked "very fine people" garbage. If Trump is a racist, he sucks at it.

You have no right to block traffic in most jurisdictions. That's why you can be arrested for it. It's not on me, as someone engaging in legal behavior, to bend to the will of others engaged in illegal activity.

1309502094366343168 2020-09-25 22:36:43 +0800 <guy45acp> @Thetruthaddict @JackPosobiec I suppose it comes down to how it's argued &amp; supporting laws/case law. It's still a misdemeanor charge so that's the least of his worries.
1309501644170813444 2020-09-25 22:34:55 +0800 <guy45acp> @Thetruthaddict @JackPosobiec Debatable maybe.

I believe, if a business doesn't want me to be armed in defense, they should provide personnel to provide defense.
1309187953772593155 2020-09-25 01:48:26 +0800 <guy45acp> @DSminf @FlaMagaman @PISDI94_96 @BodhiCrane It's not a crime here to enter an establishment that has that gun free zone sign on the door. The business can simply boot you out. If you refuse, then cops get involved &amp; it becomes trespassing.

I prefer concealed because, it allows me to enter establishments that frown upon carrying a firearm. You can't ask me to leave for carrying, if you don't know I am. üòâ

However if my open carrying hurts the feels of others, the problem is with them. I'm free to exercise my 2A right. Not my problem. I make sure to be especially well behaved when open carrying because I'm visually representing that right.

Pregnancy isn't the only thing to worry about. There are IUDs. Ultimately using a condom in conjunction with a spermicidal product brings the chances of pregnancy to an effectual zero.

I wrapped up when I was young &amp; active because, I didn't want to have kids at the time. Used spermicidal products just in case too. Again, it takes 2 but, only 1 to engage in self responsibility. You continue to make excuses.

Women should draft &amp; pass their own societal documents &amp; laws. Wait. Then you have to go down the intersectionality rabbit hole. White women do theirs. Wait. Only lesbians should craft such things for lesbians.

It existed well before that &amp; perpetrated by many races/ethnicities. It still exists today in the world. But, yes, white men righted a wrong. Did they not have the authority to because they were white?

Men can only have an opinion on abortion, if it supports their position. White men abolished slavery in this country. Should the 13th Amendment be null &amp; void because they weren't black?
1308747951859171329 2020-09-23 20:40:01 +0800 <guy45acp> @6abet_Sharaye6 @chrismullins191 @ResitsTrump @SenSanders R v. W was decided by 9 men. If men can't have an opinion on abortion because, they don't have a uterus &amp; ovaries, then their decision is negated. It's like saying women can't have an opinion/say about male pedophilia because they don't have a penis which is an absurd argument.

If you commit crimes, you absolutely deserve to have the police called on you, arrested, charged &amp; have your fate decided by a jury of your peers. These brainwashed Marxist apologists are insane. @PalaceQuandary @Bane_Returns

1306974770127405056 2020-09-18 23:14:02 +0800 <guy45acp> @Timcast Given the political climate of today, I don't think you can quantify Trump. Not to mention the spin from skewed anti Trump polls.

1306971313517613057 2020-09-18 23:00:18 +0800 <guy45acp> @tyler_casper Just curious. Didn't know if you were having issues with just one drain, a few or all. Some sewer connections have a check valve depending on codes. If it's just one or a few drains, I'd recommend a good muriatic acid drain cleaner if you're having no luck with snake.

Of course there are exceptions where I may do a temporary repair to get it by until the proper parts can be had. Generally though do it right the first time.

Although there are some things I think Apple does better, overall you can't beat Android. It feels like you don't own Apple. It's like you're borrowing the device from them.

My question was legit. You're arguing for more government empire over the individual. I'm asking uncomfortable questions regarding what you champion.

The Devil is always in the details. You're advocating for a system where no one is talking about the details. I'll stick with my private insurance. Thanks

The practice employs nurses, tech, administrative, etc. Compensation for work for the practice can mean the nurse doesn't get a bonus or pay raise or the tech or the person at the front desk.

Interesting. I think it has to do with challenging your position/dogma combined with ignorance regarding specifics of such a healthcare system.

Doctors have that ability now with the multiple different insurances. The government monopoly would kill any leverage they enjoy now.

He complied which is why his arrest, itself, went "without incident". Compliance usually leads to better outcomes. Floyd died from complications due to drug intoxication/overdose. Castile was, indeed, a blatantly bad shoot by a Hispanic officer.

1300845204040278016 2020-09-02 01:17:19 +0800 <guy45acp> @SnarkyMi @SenSanders I worked at a manufacturing plant once. Non union. It moved to my town fleeing unreasonable demands &amp; actions via a union. They flat out stated that they'd relocate my plant should anyone get the idea of organizing a union. I've never been in a union &amp; don't want to be.
1300844616720297987 2020-09-02 01:14:59 +0800 <guy45acp> @heatherju @BahezTony @SenSanders Because there are labor laws &amp; agencies charged with enforcing those laws. Times have changed. If you feel mistreated or hate your job, fix your situation. There are other jobs. Get an education. Learn a skill/trade. Start your own business. No one is stopping you but, you.
1300843058980847617 2020-09-02 01:08:48 +0800 <guy45acp> @zjmillimet @SenSanders Unions are garbage from my experience. Never worked at a union plant but, did scab once because, one of our union plants was on strike over nothing. If you don't like your job or feel mistreated, find something else or do something to increase your labor value.  https://t.co/GCdtBo2BFS
1300840974999064578 2020-09-02 01:00:31 +0800 <guy45acp> @seabrez54 @JoeNBC I'm confused. You're saying that it's Trump people rioting yet you have Hollywood &amp; Democrats, who can't stand Trump, giving support both by their words &amp; financially to bail out Trump's rioters? @PalaceQuandary @Bane_Rises
1300840160528039936 2020-09-02 00:57:17 +0800 <guy45acp> @judy_george @JoeNBC @GayEqualGlobal Easy, Marxist. Tell your fellow "useful idiots" to stop burning &amp; pillaging. Tell them to stop engaging in violence.
1300835532222738435 2020-09-02 00:38:53 +0800 <guy45acp> @tyler_casper But, if I told you, I would be admitting what may or may not have happened. üòÇ@PalaceQuandary @Bane_Rises  https://t.co/4pklcKWeK5

1300830476601618432 2020-09-02 00:18:48 +0800 <guy45acp> @JesseKellyDC Sad state of affairs when you can't hit a drive thru in the nude for some Taco Hell. Maybe it was Laundry Day.  https://t.co/oyRlQKzxll

1300797710572883968 2020-09-01 22:08:36 +0800 <guy45acp> @LEBassett You're full of üí©. About as simple &amp; straightforward as can be said. @PalaceQuandary @Bane_Rises  https://t.co/BqI9paflv4

1300774894054109187 2020-09-01 20:37:56 +0800 <guy45acp> @tpvenezula @headshot1984 @bryarcrose @scrowder They're throwing poo at the wall to see what sticks.

1300774121513549829 2020-09-01 20:34:52 +0800 <guy45acp> @tpvenezula @headshot1984 @bryarcrose @scrowder The firearm was loaned to him by a friend while in Kenosha according to the defense. All of his actions were in self defense according to everything I've seen. The morons ID'ed the kid from a confrontation earlier that night. They wanted to "put him in his place."
1300773304433811457 2020-09-01 20:31:37 +0800 <guy45acp> @tpvenezula @headshot1984 @bryarcrose @scrowder Kyle pulled lifeguard duty in Kenosha earlier in the day. Cleaned up graffiti after that. Then volunteered to help a business owner protect his property. He didn't illegally cross state lines with anything. It's not a crime for a minor to carry a weapon on private property.
1300770154142461953 2020-09-01 20:19:06 +0800 <guy45acp> @PISDI94_96 Exactly. üí©Birds come in all colors as well as good, honest, decent folks do.
1300629427169169414 2020-09-01 10:59:54 +0800 <guy45acp> @PISDI94_96 Rare. And bread to facilitate returning a sparkling clean plate.
