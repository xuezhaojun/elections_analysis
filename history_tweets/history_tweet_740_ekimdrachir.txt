1343687977172520960 2020-12-29 06:39:12 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @NathanMars7 I suggest $10 Hive and $100 HBD imo, if new Hive users want to be serious they should Power Up about 5000 HP which is only about $590 right now. There is a 'finite' amount of Hive to go around.

Xrp isn't really a coin its more of a currency remittance and settlement ledger. It defines itself as "a novel consensus algorithm".

1329667775615287301 2020-11-20 14:07:56 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @NathanMars7 I'd rather have Hive than any other crypto.

1329581222511616003 2020-11-20 08:24:00 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @elliss_seven Sometimes yes, usually no. It has the effect of reduced stress but the process is not that much fun.
1329526836817104898 2020-11-20 04:47:53 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @AdeTorrent I agree Hive is better. Due to the fact it was one of the first platforms that made it 'relatively' easy to create tokens, it had first mover advantage. As a result, everyone and their mother has launched an ERC-20 token. Therefore none are particularly interesting to me.
1329499597077573634 2020-11-20 02:59:39 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @iFireMonkey I tried to play the venom cup yesterday, had only a short 3 hour window to do so. None of the matches would start with anyone I tried to play with. Kind of disappointing.
1329497200188014596 2020-11-20 02:50:08 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @AdeTorrent I think Hive has more mass adoption appeal than ETH which seems to be primarily propped up with pyramid schemes using smart contracts these days. Everyone I hear bragging about Ethereum is doing this.
1329496712801443840 2020-11-20 02:48:11 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @hive_blockchain @AdeTorrent @UniswapProtocol I don't particularly trust ETH and no one makes a very good case for it considering its security flaws.
1329311628018401282 2020-11-19 14:32:44 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @AdeTorrent I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly makes ETH so good, when we have Hive and it is clearly better in many ways.

1329167108287074304 2020-11-19 04:58:28 +0800 <ekimdrachir> I find bad attitude a major turnoff from getting involved in their projects. If you are telling your userbase they are stupid or showing that you do not care about people, why would anyone ever trust you? Alienation is the definition.

1327716043855314944 2020-11-15 04:52:27 +0800 <ekimdrachir> ETC is the original Ethereum. There was some sort of issue so they forked it and created ETH. An accidental hard fork last week created 30 block sidechain, and now I am wondering if someone is going to fork ETH again before it switches to proof of stake. What is an ERC20 exactly?
1327609621142376448 2020-11-14 21:49:34 +0800 <ekimdrachir> @FinanceLeo I would say Hive is the better alternative for sure. Security risks make me stay far away from Ethereum. It makes me nervous to see so many with zero knowledge jumping in.
