1341373912899268608 2020-12-22 21:23:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta Sounds like its working already Anna!
1341372882904080384 2020-12-22 21:19:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @kit1049 You're right, the evidence base for sensory intervention/treatment is very mixed/limited, but there are small scale studies which show the benefits for lots of groups. As in most things, keep what works and lose the rest.
1341367377850740739 2020-12-22 20:57:58 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @dnwood @melacomfort really helpful to see a photo of it Denise! You have the 11kg, which is the maximum I think? Did you work your way up to that, or did you go straight to that?
1341021554554105857 2020-12-21 22:03:48 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> A really insightful thread on this complex issue, this has been a particularly difficult year for everyone, and carers are not appropriately supported in our antiquated system
1340443953729069056 2020-12-20 07:48:37 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert @AHPLeader @CK_ldn_nyc @NikoBrenner @JayHolder17 Will look forward to listening to this!
1340363799912734720 2020-12-20 02:30:07 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @anxious_doctor @ruthgibson35 I could have explained it better!
1340276618741374977 2020-12-19 20:43:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @anxious_doctor @ruthgibson35 Try a cold filled hot water bottle/rice in a plastic bag, in the meantime to see if it helps?
1340248026309398529 2020-12-19 18:50:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ruthgibson35 Great to hear the whole household on board Ruth 😅 yes I really like the idea that different people use it different ways, as it suits them. And looking at lap pad is great. Lots of people struggling with regulating during long zoom calls
1340056343709888516 2020-12-19 06:08:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @TVsCarlKinsella Yeh but on the plus side, despite 8-10% of the population being dyspraxic, no one has heard of it, so your secret is safe!  https://t.co/dNTKMiPktN
1340049407706865664 2020-12-19 05:40:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta Anna, I was just asking for advice, experience, recommendations on weighted blankets. Where did you get yours? And please do let us know how you get on with it?!   https://t.co/m1v3bESWfH
1340048152099995652 2020-12-19 05:35:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @sarahw12 Thanks for that Sarah, great to hear your personal experience
1339993328104988675 2020-12-19 01:57:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @MindMeMindYouIE @gravityblankets Those Gravity ones look brilliant Eithne @MindMeMindYouIE, look nice and well made, and very discrete too, if that's important to people! Our if the price range for the couple of people in looking at it with, but could be one to save up for. Do they get quite hot?
1339992357098418176 2020-12-19 01:54:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AGingerxyz Weighted blanket, swimming and heavy backpack are all great proprioceptive input!
1339991939769389067 2020-12-19 01:52:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AGingerxyz That's the idea, but not everyone listens to their CAMHS OT 😅 I always try to encourage people to spread it throughout day, rather than getting to overwhelm and then trying to retrospectively regulate, but I knew its easier said than done!
1339977498235420675 2020-12-19 00:55:05 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @jwiggi21 Good to know, especially with so many autistic people having joint issues! You're the second person to set you would have got a bigger one also, so that's really helpful :)
1339976911058038784 2020-12-19 00:52:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @TheRexSystem This is one of my favourite things about twitter! Thanks so much, I'll bookmark that now :)
1339968056718725123 2020-12-19 00:17:34 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AGingerxyz Thanks for your considered response @AGingerxyz, really helpful. That is really interesting that you feel it has helped reduce sensory overload overall. I wonder if others have the same experience.
1339967579826348033 2020-12-19 00:15:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @katiejred V interesting thanks Katie, very handy as a portable/lap weight
1339967308521988096 2020-12-19 00:14:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @TheRexSystem Great to hear the positive experiences! Could you let me know brand/make? Thanks!
1339967086978871296 2020-12-19 00:13:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @kegelsneezer @AskADHD This is a great help thanks, as I have heard people say they can be too warm.

1339834453800218624 2020-12-18 15:26:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ABCsofADHD @AskADHD @adhdireland Oh yes, thanks @ABCsofADHD, have heard good things, but over a year waiting list now

1339581152382705670 2020-12-17 22:40:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @darachos great list thanks Darach, and a couple of new ones to me. I know Dolly Parton's america was technically last year, but that's my recommendation, for ever!
1339526493110726659 2020-12-17 19:02:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> #askadhd @AskADHD @adhdireland I am trying to source a psychiatrist who specialises in ADHD in Ireland. I have several clients who's dr is retiring, and there is a waiting list of over a year,or longer,to see someone, even just for medication prescription/review. Can anyone help?
1339129368451354624 2020-12-16 16:44:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @GrumpyPug17 These clacky ones are great. Think it's good to have a mix of silent ones and clicky ones. Silent ones for for a zoom or in person meeting. Chewlery likewise  https://t.co/WlIsC0fpSm
1339117881418780673 2020-12-16 15:59:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Occ4LifeLtd #OTalk I often recommend colleagues read Dr Clare Taylors Casson lecture from 2007 about diversity in the profession. So really relevant today, and thought provoking, so could be good for a journal club, for starting the conversation  https://t.co/pY98zn41GT
1338966688520351745 2020-12-16 05:58:29 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AndrewBatesOT @Occ4LifeLtd Great suggestions. While some don't feel safe to be "out" at work, we can create a safe space for our colleagues and clients through the above
1338966065838223362 2020-12-16 05:56:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Occ4LifeLtd Since i only work with one other OT, I don't promote it so much in OT in my day to day life, but I work with other professionals, and its great to challenge assumptions around hidden disabilities, and the prevalence of disability, especially in the academic setting #OTalk
1338965891170635777 2020-12-16 05:55:19 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Occ4LifeLtd I start every presentation/workshop, regardless of topic and audience, by talking about diversity, including my own. Since I'm dyspraxic, it helps break the ice as i explain that; I find presenting difficult, i might speak too fast, or lose my words. #OTalk
1338957580547338243 2020-12-16 05:22:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill @themakearcade i must have one!
1338920268908126208 2020-12-16 02:54:02 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @lore33x @Beautidivergen2 i have a related problem in that when I think of or see something someone will like, I'll get it and give it to them but find it difficult to get presents otherwise - so often end up not giving presents on actual birthdays or christmas or panic buying something impersonal
1338764038529032193 2020-12-15 16:33:14 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta  https://t.co/wkMiqu0mIX

1338758679538044928 2020-12-15 16:11:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta Great idea @annagranta. I usually have a few nice candles spare, wrapped etc. If I forget someone, I can really panic!
1338611262889013248 2020-12-15 06:26:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mcmorrow_sharon Yes I hope to still offer it Sharon, no one can say it doesn't work now. As OTs we need to be flexible in meeting people where they're at
1338562229751439360 2020-12-15 03:11:19 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @WyrdWombman I struggled with learning ISL but I also really enjoyed it once I started to get the hang of it. I focused on trying to get the hand shapes right, rather than speed. I also practiced a lot! #signingwhiledyspraxic
1338471654440230912 2020-12-14 21:11:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname best of luck!

1337739037495472129 2020-12-12 20:40:15 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @lerdlebosh Also, I've seen really badly written ones, which are just aimed at making the child act "normal" which I don't agree with.
1337738877126258688 2020-12-12 20:39:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @lerdlebosh Where I saw them being most effective was preparing a kid for something unusual or new, such as visiting santa, dentist, even covid test. They can be effective for the right kids in the right situation, but are not a panacea.

1337020646832926721 2020-12-10 21:05:37 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> A concise overview of the   symphisiotomy history in Ireland. I stopped listening to newstalk when I heard George Hook absolutely ate Colm OGorman on this (5 years ago?) as GH claimed the Dr's didn't intend harm. But they knowingly used an outdated harmful practice for decades
1337011804627726336 2020-12-10 20:30:29 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ElaineMcgreevy Great share thanks Elaine. I've been talking about this more in training, good to have a visual to go with!

1336999476087681031 2020-12-10 19:41:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrClaireMurphy Haha yes Claire, was a safety thing fit uyd (far enough away from stove). But a few of our friends with kids have made enquiries! And we have cats now - although, in some ways, this is more tantalising to them than right way up!
1336993592271892482 2020-12-10 19:18:07 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Katie__Fay 😅 Its a lot of fun!

1336975661395750912 2020-12-10 18:06:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @GHollandPhoto It really is worth it. On a fine day in particular. Just a few minutes from Tallaght village, and you feel in a very remote place!

It can help you make sense of yourself, make sense of your past, and the present. You can also try medication. But you can also try relevant strategies now and see if they help you

1336789552673955840 2020-12-10 05:47:20 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @sharonlambert0 Well... it started as a fire safety measure, to be far enough away from the stove. And then, it just sort of worked :) also, the mechanics of it keep you busy of a lockdown! however, the cats are too interested 🐱
1336788944478941187 2020-12-10 05:44:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Denise1Rogers Thanks Denise! Kept us busy the last few days anyway :)

Many people get physically less hyper, but the symptoms remain. C. In school, lots of kids can cope because there's a lot of structure. As life gets more complex, demands increase, and many people start to struggle more. Please get help!

This moves more towards collaboration and understanding and modifying the environment to facilitate communication, rather than expecting our clients to fold into our system #otalk
1335233304111550464 2020-12-05 22:43:21 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Karla_Avi36 Not OT specific, but the @Autistica podcast  https://t.co/HuqHcBcDDD featuring lots of OTs is great for anyone interested in learning more about the autism community
1334540446153011208 2020-12-04 00:50:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @slidingndiving @GaRoDean I can highly recommend the investment!
1334538743131348992 2020-12-04 00:43:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @slidingndiving @GaRoDean My only handmade clothing!
1334537075161518080 2020-12-04 00:36:47 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Assoc_Anaes @AutisticDoctor Great to see the Association of Anaesthetists promoting neurodiversity in the profession
1334516725157666817 2020-12-03 23:15:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Study_ADHD @annagranta I find that some of the ND crew can struggle with meditation, but some people find that 5 deep breaths *between* activities/transitions can be a good way to reset, and prepare to change mode.
1334516423281029124 2020-12-03 23:14:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta @maybeADHdee I think catching or noticing the early warning signs is the best place to start improving/changing this! note them down for future reference, and also note down anything that helps - often sensory stuff
1334516059806773253 2020-12-03 23:13:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annagranta @Study_ADHD I would call that interoception, which is knowing what is happening inside our bodies. This page,though relating to children explains it very well.  https://t.co/E5ZNmzt5eV There are some therapies that can help, and using your body physically can help to improve the communication
1334492224311209985 2020-12-03 21:38:34 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Nateisthenerdy1 Fair play Nate, it is not easy! I never thought I would get used to it or grow to like it, as I was so anxious when learning, but actually enjoy driving now :) #drivingwhileneurodivergent
1334480821546323970 2020-12-03 20:53:15 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @GaRoDean I would say it's too nice to wear, but Christmas glamour cannot be sacrificed!

1334479302520410113 2020-12-03 20:47:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Run don't walk to order masks from @GaRoDean They are absolutely gorgeously made, such high quality, and very Christmassy!  https://t.co/B7ezpaQPjI
1334478819965726725 2020-12-03 20:45:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OTPodcastClub @OTAfterDark So sorry to have missed this again, but after four hours taking minutes @AOTInews I was useless! Really looking forward to attending after Christmas! Fantastic initiative!
1334463461863120897 2020-12-03 19:44:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert @supermummas yes elastic laces and velcro are your friend here
1334442508038905856 2020-12-03 18:21:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @supermummas @OT_Expert Depends on the child. If fine motor OK iPad might suit, but if fine motor a challenge touch screen can be frustrating, so maybe a laptop better.
1334441370111643648 2020-12-03 18:16:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @supermummas @OT_Expert I would recommend Grammarly,which can just run in the background, but can actually help kids to understand grammar, and improve their writing. Also I'd recommend  https://t.co/0Lcb9uMgWS which can supply e-books in audio, large print, different colours/contrast etc. Free in the UK
1334145723869360128 2020-12-02 22:41:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Consider joining AOTIs new Working Group on Systemic Racism
1334121537838977027 2020-12-02 21:05:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Great event on inclusive employment, coincididing with International Day of Persons with disabilities

1332956162778656769 2020-11-29 15:54:48 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert Thanks! Still working on getting scent right, but the process is a lot more straightforward and doable than I expected. Even for an old dyspraxic like me. I encourage anyone who's considered but thought it might be too messy or awkward to give it a go. If I can do it, anyone can
1332771688732385280 2020-11-29 03:41:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert I got in to knitting because i could be quite restless at night, and its the right amount of "engaged but relaxing" for me, quite contemplative. This lockdown, I've got into making candles, as smell has been a big regulator for me over the past few months. Still learning :)  https://t.co/F81KSWE1gC
1332614418828582912 2020-11-28 17:16:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mspinsly You aren't alone at all! Between 6-10% of everyone we know is dyspraxic! I love your description, of everything falling into place. It has enabled me to be more compassionate to myself and really helps me understand others too #neurodiversesquad @DYSPRAXIAFDTN @DyspraxicWomen
1332319738911973377 2020-11-27 21:45:53 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @shaunoboyle Thank you so much Shaun, I struggled with the Otter add on and gave up, I'll play with that this weekend!
1332061314718584835 2020-11-27 04:39:00 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AutisticDoctor You are so right!Think OT is a great fit for supporting the autistic community, but we need more evidence on the interventions that are helpful,and hear from autistic people who have used OT. And yes barriers to accessing an OT, and CPD needs in the the profession. So much to do!
1332060400486133762 2020-11-27 04:35:22 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @MindMeMindYouIE Thanks Eithne! I'm signed up, but actually not sure how much of the days I'll make, really looking forward to seeing @singer_judy and @NancyDoylePsych. Only one OT on the agenda, which I think is a shame, as OT has a lot to offer in this discussion, but @ClodaghNolan1 an expert!
1331850166941446145 2020-11-26 14:39:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AsIAmIreland @SuperValuIRL A much needed webinar! @AsIAmIreland have kept up the output and support all through covid,and this particular information is needed now more than ever unfortunately! Fantastic session
1331849471630733314 2020-11-26 14:37:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @KirraneNiall @tcd_ot @ClodaghNolan1 Vital. It is a cross practise area consideration. And no better man!
1331848590201925640 2020-11-26 14:33:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @sarahanndoran @IrwinGill There is a strange idea they must have a health background. HSE recently advertised for contact tracers,and it explicitly stated they were looking for medical background. a physio or OT has no more expertise in sticking a swab up someones nose or contact tracing than anyone else!
1331726391151374336 2020-11-26 06:28:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @DrAlanRobinson  https://t.co/Zw6HfLk6io
1331704395592036360 2020-11-26 05:00:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdamtheOT Love this one Adam! Setting a challenge is a great way to engage young people - and blow their minds! Great ideas for entertaining the kids and they can even teach it to someone else 😊 @dyspraxiaIRL @AsIAmIreland #finemotor
1331600344636399617 2020-11-25 22:07:16 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @AutisticDoctor Love this collaboration!!!
1331369050342035458 2020-11-25 06:48:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @QLMentoring @Denise1Rogers @Tchamp13 @ddfoc @mickmahon1 @TomWall73409057 @LynchySarah @JudithM58231392 Sensory escape hatches/rooms/routes/pods are essential resources in any public spaces,and for universal design.They're like ramps, they make the environment accessible for so many,and without them,many are unable to participate in the activities they want and need to do.
1331361817009016833 2020-11-25 06:19:27 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Denise1Rogers @Tchamp13 I've not seen them specifically in MH, but the need and demand is there, we're learning more about the sensory needs associated with mental health
1331361333493837824 2020-11-25 06:17:32 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Denise1Rogers @QLMentoring @Tchamp13 @ddfoc @mickmahon1 @TomWall73409057 @LynchySarah @JudithM58231392 When I showed one student our pods  https://t.co/5RiHQesSym she was tearful, saying she wouldn't need to spend time in the toilets everyday to get a sensory break. These can radically change the environment and enable participation!
1331361044380442628 2020-11-25 06:16:23 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Denise1Rogers @QLMentoring @Tchamp13 @ddfoc @mickmahon1 @TomWall73409057 @LynchySarah @JudithM58231392 Yes love these. We've been thinking of similar for our @DCUautism autism friendly campus guidelines, to expand our range of pods. Something like this can change a space completely, and make it accessible.
1331322067778670593 2020-11-25 03:41:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Hoggie1979 @phrenohead Thank you for reminding me of this, keep forgetting that it's been recommended!
1331320666155573248 2020-11-25 03:35:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead Yes, and she still has living family! And it's been disproved!
1331320502821019648 2020-11-25 03:35:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead So much! I accustomed got recommended the book on it on audible the other day. Let's just say the blurb was inaccurate!
1331313494260654084 2020-11-25 03:07:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead See also phinaes gage, and don't get me started on little Albert!
1331312548768063490 2020-11-25 03:03:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead Another thing I found ethically dubious, though not sure if others do,is some of the famous case studies, repeated and repeated, immortalising people e.g. Kitty Genovese, who I'm sure didn't want to be immortalised or used as the basis of a school of thought for her brutal murder
1331311787262828556 2020-11-25 03:00:39 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead Marshmallow test, very dubious. Also milgram. Also Stanford. I did occupational therapy, but we did an enormous amount of psychology, up to 12 hours a week at times, and I was baffled that while schools of thought were based on one never reproduced study.
1331311100479070209 2020-11-25 02:57:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @MOHOspark training 😍😍😍😍
1331309478822731785 2020-11-25 02:51:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @sighentist @PookyH Great one! A lot of people mentioning trees and smell, very sensory!
1331286882160873472 2020-11-25 01:21:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @sighentist @PookyH I put on perfume before my zoom meetings 😅
1331280858888671232 2020-11-25 00:57:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Claire_00_Bear Completely agree! When I worked in CAMHS the 2 year waiting list i inherited stressed me out so much, because there was so little we could do for families, and I felt that we were so ineffective. What do you do when families ring to ask when they'll be seen?
1331261790970404864 2020-11-24 23:41:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @PookyH Smell! I bought some posh shampoo, and it feels like an escape in the shower. A big one especially in the blurred working from home space - take 5 deep breaths between activities/zones/transitions. Really helps to re-set. just any sensory stuff in general:  https://t.co/ogX7iYU0ek
1331235944272437249 2020-11-24 21:59:16 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @KirraneNiall These are stunning. What a clever way to summarise the event!

1331193728812322816 2020-11-24 19:11:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @kriemhildsrache I needed to watch and re-watch videos on youtube on the most basic stitches. But now have them as second nature. Still have to watch videos on getting started with magic loop if i haven't done it for a while! Ravelry is essential for finding easy attractive patterns.
1331193430723207170 2020-11-24 19:10:20 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @kriemhildsrache Dyspraxic knitter here :) I would not recommend starting on socks! Whether you use magic loop or DPN (4-5 needles), its  one of the more difficult things to knit. Make it easy for yourself, and less likley to incite regret and negative self talk, and do a scarf!
1331188277328613378 2020-11-24 18:49:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @KirraneNiall I was really gutted to miss this event this morning :( Seems really well planned! maybe some videos will be available after? @MHReform

1326143720354443265 2020-11-10 20:44:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @MadiganEdward Hampers full of proper crisps are essential in this difficult time. Can confirm I have eaten the rest of the #chipsticks. Happy Birthday!
1326099413190795264 2020-11-10 17:48:32 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdhdConsistent1 @AsheRevenge @AdultingADHD Proprioception is essential for regulation, and as you say, some just get it through their mouth! Many ADHDers find heavy exercise is vital to their attention and well being 🏋️
1326098317168795649 2020-11-10 17:44:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mazza_bb @AsheRevenge @AdultingADHD Yes definitely!
1326091654374232065 2020-11-10 17:17:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdhdConsistent1 @AsheRevenge @AdultingADHD Meant to add a tweet to explain, for those it was new to!  https://t.co/LZ2G21F1Uv
1326078908496797696 2020-11-10 16:27:03 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Weathered_M @AdultingADHD Nuts, dried chickpeas, popcorn, trail mix.?
1326076608021737477 2020-11-10 16:17:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Weathered_M @AdultingADHD Texture of....?
1326076293750923264 2020-11-10 16:16:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bethicalj @AdultingADHD Yes you're right, the meals being hard too bit. Swap celery for popcorn :)
1326075929207123968 2020-11-10 16:15:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Lost_by_Resolve @AdultingADHD Yes, really good idea. I like those massive pumpkin seeds. You'd been chewing one all day!
1326075306525024256 2020-11-10 16:12:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdhdLondon @AdultingADHD I agree. Some ive worked with really struggled with appetite due to stimulants, so they had to graze through the day, rather than big meals. If it works, and it's reasonably healthy, nothing wrong with it
1326074777921089539 2020-11-10 16:10:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @PietroBenito @AdultingADHD I'm veggie, so I've never had jerky, but people seem to like it! Very easy to get too
1326071234086510592 2020-11-10 15:56:34 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @naomialgeo @Beanandgoose @LoughReeDistill @KennysBookshop  https://t.co/Xyn36Gzt1f are fanatic. Great range of Irish makers, toys, ceramics, candles, Christmas decorations etc. You can also create your own hamper, which they'll post now, Or second week of December! They've made it really easy. I've bought loads, really recommend!
1326070191936180226 2020-11-10 15:52:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AsheRevenge @AdultingADHD Gum and sugar free sweets could help tide you over while still giving some feedback, and helping regulate
1326070065482117120 2020-11-10 15:51:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AsheRevenge @AdultingADHD Not a heap 😅 some find frozen grapes good, as theres a lot of feedback, cherry tomatoes are good too as they taste sweet but are actually lower in sugar. Maybe trial dried pineapple, dried mango, those kinds of things as they provide a lot of chew which is great proprioception
1326066657735872514 2020-11-10 15:38:22 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdultingADHD Lots of ADHDers snack because they're seeking sensory stimulation, so try chopped celery or carrots which give a lot of feedback. Also, protein good for the dopaminegeric pathways, so if you can't eat nuts, go for seeds, high protein yogurt, even jerky, which gives a lot of chew!
1325199413229330433 2020-11-08 06:12:15 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Cat thank you for this thoughtful, clear reflection on how OT helped you! It's been amazing hearing from people who value OT this #OTWeek2020 #OTweek

But they would not be core concepts in OT. May be used as part of a frame of reference or cognitive approach.
1324686401175171079 2020-11-06 20:13:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AGingerxyz @ADHDelaide well this is it, another "executive dysfunction tax"! I keep buying masks, and they keep disappearing. I will check out those ones in Dunnes!

Before i started my OT training, I shadowed a few OTs in different settings, and met a wonderful OT doing hand therapy, and while it wasn't for me, it seems one of the most holistic and practical streams of OT. #OTweek2020
1324301422037475330 2020-11-05 18:43:58 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Thank you @Autistica for highlighting your collaborations with Occupational therapists this year #OTweek #OTWeek2020. And I can say you're lovely to work with 😊

I spoke to top management at a large company recently, ~5,000 employees, and I asked were they aware of colleagues who are autistic? They said they have one. 1. Uno! This was obviously the only person who had specifically disclosed, but then I hit them with the stats!

1321771218593320960 2020-10-29 19:09:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mcmorrow_sharon a worthy badge in this instance!
1321754499711721472 2020-10-29 18:03:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @emmafrawley raised the idea of inspiring OTs during #OTweek, and its been so busy I haven't had a chance to do it! I will start with @emmafrawley who I so admire for being brave enough to ditch clinical work and go do a PhD, her research is much needed -  https://t.co/06DVj9MhsA
1321578579038261249 2020-10-29 06:24:21 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Nateisthenerdy1 Everyone's a winner!

1321514138024239107 2020-10-29 02:08:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AOTInews @EDinthehome I think the OT in emergency depts or @EDinthehome approach shows clearly the benefit of OT. We analyse activities that need to be done,we assess the environment for safety and usability,and we're practical problem solvers, keeping the clients at home,where they want to be #OTweek
1321396746174582785 2020-10-28 18:21:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname Nothing to crow about imo. The Trinity one is that you get a masters title, having not completed a masters. I think the others are the same? But as you say, a way to identify each other maybe?
1321387305362477059 2020-10-28 17:44:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname best of luck!

Good place to start.  https://t.co/GhlUz7I8F8  https://t.co/7l26FNjgb8 I can personally recommend  https://t.co/Xyn36Gzt1f which is a conglomerate of Irish crafts folks, which has some Christmassy things, like handmade stockings.
1321360598047875072 2020-10-28 15:58:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @CDETBChiefPsych @PsychSocIreland @AOTInews Yes we'd love that Caroline! The therapy in schools pilot project (OT and SLT) has been successful, but needs to be expanded. OT and SLT just as important in this area
1321357419268706304 2020-10-28 15:45:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> That's great to hear @IrwinGill #OTweek

1320625008956350465 2020-10-26 15:15:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Rubberbandits Less testing in this case probably means the vaccines will be less effective, unlikely to be harmful. but later vaccines, which will  benefit from learnings from earlier ones will be more effective.
1320624057851781125 2020-10-26 15:11:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Rubberbandits As most have said it will more than likely be health staff first and elderly, allowing us to relax things a bit.But, the problem is they when you need to produce millions and billions of doses,there isn't time to do full testing.This is worth a listen  https://t.co/qJA4dmlOZz
1320256380201324544 2020-10-25 14:50:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HollytheOT Same. We can do this in a week, right? #OTweek #OTweek2020

1319717739984977923 2020-10-24 03:10:03 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @naomialgeo Why on earth are clinical skills needed?! This makes no sense. Also, what if hundreds of clinicians were to apply, and leave gaps across the HSE??

1319624222361194498 2020-10-23 20:58:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mollyemakeup Im dyspraxic, so when i watch videos, I can't reproduce what people do in them, and practise improves that, but every time i try it, its more tragic looking, so I don't want to do it again. Every 2 months, forever.
1319593016793964550 2020-10-23 18:54:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @katiejred I think for everyone's health and safety we need to minimise in person,where we can,but i agree,it means we need to be more creative in how we engage with students, how we scaffold, and role model online engagement.We've had some fun with online icebreakers, which is v effective!

1319542115941163010 2020-10-23 15:32:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> It's been a rough few days for most of us, but I can really recommend the podcast hug from @Rubberbandits It's a lovely interview with Graham Norton, there's a lot about identity and knowing yourself. It's authentic and warm, and fascinating as always.   https://t.co/7uwlbyUvoc
1319540096941641728 2020-10-23 15:24:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @katiejred Yes Katie, you're so right! We are seeing first years really struggling already. Don't forget, they are still teenagers, and need support and reassurance!
1319361899075670018 2020-10-23 03:36:03 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen @PadraigMacL I'm so frustrated to hear this. Of all the sh1tty things FFG have inflicted on the most vulnerable people, the people they have let down time and time again, this seems to be the most venal, the most designed to cover their own backs. And the Greens rowing in with them again
1319341411272216576 2020-10-23 02:14:39 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdamtheOT @OT_Expert Adam this is such a good example of core OT skills - creativity, client centredness and fit, and a neat solution for teletherapy. And just in time for #OTweek I'm sure there's a lot of therapists that word love to hear more of your smart adaptations for teletherapy!
1319316548704665608 2020-10-23 00:35:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdamtheOT @OT_Expert We need more details!
1319316304529162241 2020-10-23 00:34:53 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdamtheOT @OT_Expert Looks fantastic Adam! Is it for close up on your hands? I really want a document camera, to show clients drawings or wee graphs
1319216786848493568 2020-10-22 17:59:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @GeorgiaVineOT Unacceptable for an educator, especially an AHP, to insist that people verbally contribute. You can equally contribute through chat, and if they are expecting people to speak, and it is marked participation, then that should be explicit, and appropriate accommodations made
1319186958917242880 2020-10-22 16:00:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @GeorgiaVineOT On An OT course?!?! Those lecturers would want to check themselves and remember #clinicianshaveconditions

1318806282216898560 2020-10-21 14:48:14 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @theRCOT Your recent newsletter had a focus on neurodiversity, so this is quite disappointing for your neurodiverse therapists, and our neurodiverse client group
1318805980642222081 2020-10-21 14:47:02 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @theRCOT Hi @theRCOT I'm a dyspraxic OT,I dont suffer from dyspraxia,and I certainly would never say this about a client. I'm a mental health OT but am not qualified to know when someone's dopamine levels have increased.I think this could have been phrased in a more occupation focused way
1318634589519286273 2020-10-21 03:25:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @24shaz It is perfection!

1318630568200994819 2020-10-21 03:10:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead Did I say great question by the way?!

There have been gorgeous pieces of work showcased in the past, highlighting the creativity and warmth of the profession in Ireland. Get those applications in! #OTalk
1318502884074491905 2020-10-20 18:42:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @zoblerone I'm still seeing annually at least 10 women who have been through CAMHS/AMHS, got diagnoses of depression/ anxiety, who are clearly autistic, but the services haven't picked it up? Many of them have autistic brothers, which should be picked up in a basic history. Grinds my gears!
1318483802126168064 2020-10-20 17:26:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @MingaMadl @laxkra Yes, it can really give someone a boost, and let them know you're thinking of them :)
1318445429382664192 2020-10-20 14:54:20 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @laxkra Didn't see Green Dot mentioned, its a hub for lots of Irish designers, most based in Clonakilty. They've prints, cards, kiddie stuff, homewards. And they've care packages - I've bought a few recently!  https://t.co/ejnjlvNAPW
1318322578067435520 2020-10-20 06:46:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Rickard_Scott @DrEilidh @DrAmyPearson @JackPHowes @journalautism Of course,I work with this group  everyday! I just wondered about the correlation of dropping out/ prediagnosis. It's just touched on briefly in the paper, and I would like to hear more detail on this, for example was it their struggle with uni that prompted them to get assessed?
1318227912533987333 2020-10-20 00:30:00 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HelenORahilly More please!  https://t.co/1bQ4hAZdc0

1318222569779191811 2020-10-20 00:08:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen Please help if you can
1318220010360360961 2020-10-19 23:58:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Nateisthenerdy1 I needed that reminder today - thanks!
1318160924361003008 2020-10-19 20:03:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrEilidh @DrAmyPearson @JackPHowes @journalautism This paper is well worth a read, with an autistic and non autistic author collaborating. One of the most interesting sections for me, was that the 10 out of 14 participants were diagnosed after college, meaning they navigated college without much support.
1317948710287007744 2020-10-19 06:00:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Magnus919 Obviously Dr Nancy and Judy keeping the side up, but really disappointing to hear not only that for so many people neurodiversity = autism, but also not enough on other strands of folks. Funny old business! Thanks for the reportage @Magnus919
1317946522986827778 2020-10-19 05:51:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Magnus919 OK, so apart from the grammatical errors, they are pushing person first, which generally is not the preferred term in the community. Hmm. And is this neurodiversity summit completely about autism, or do the rest of us get a look in?
1317945602773233664 2020-10-19 05:48:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Magnus919 Neurodiverse as a synonym for autistic is preferred??? That's a new one on me!
1317945343019974656 2020-10-19 05:47:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FionaKenny1 Thanks for raising this Fiona. The responses! They don't realise they are reinforcing your point 😬
1317943669455015946 2020-10-19 05:40:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Magnus919 V interesting magnus! I've heard this from e.g. employers who would be just learning the term neurodiversity, but from professionals in the field, at the Neurodiversity Summit? I am quite surprised!
1317407213309317120 2020-10-17 18:08:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ I've heard of multi-tasking, but.....!

1317181481463197696 2020-10-17 03:11:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ClareOC_ Oh it's brilliant! Perfect non covid interesting but upbeat!

1316677734643400704 2020-10-15 17:50:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell Brilliant resource thanks Laura! I find a lot of people are coming back to me looking for resources for working with adults too, as you say where it is not formally identified.

1316436208436891649 2020-10-15 01:50:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ I'd recommend this episode of "Seriously" to anyone who has an interest in this area. Its a great overview, and presented by helen keen who is autistic  https://t.co/lQFRe6wXvD
1316435830345523200 2020-10-15 01:48:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ The @AskingAutistics @ is great for asking anything, and lots of helpful stuff from @SNeurotypicals Also check out @Aoife_Dooley her art is wonderful. @HappeLab stuff is great too
1316434263219277825 2020-10-15 01:42:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ Read stuff written and researched by autistic women and/or NB peeps,or in collaboration with autistic women. These folks know their stuff @Stigmaphrenia_1 @Sarahmarieob @naturetable @Sarah_NottsUni @QueerlyAutistic @AnnMemmott @RebeccaTwinley @Letterstomyname @Finnattentive
1316427133787475971 2020-10-15 01:14:21 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 Will this it, I've no problem with subjectivity, it's natural in any human interaction, and so to claim they are more objective (presumably than us woolly HSCPs), betrays their opinion of themselves and the rest of us
1316423073416065026 2020-10-15 00:58:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 I've seen a new psychiatrist come in and reassess everyone, and change all their meds. Why would this happen if the assessment is objective? Every psychiatrist would agree on all assessments if it was that objective. Spectacular "lack of insight" o/e
1316298250396348416 2020-10-14 16:42:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Foley62 @ronportnoir @annmcnam @Punsetcetera I believe Ron was noting the discrepancy between perceived "difficult/different" neurodiverse folks, and people who are "difficult" for other reasons - bad bosses etc, and i was agreeing that the second are difficult for all of us
1316284884902699009 2020-10-14 15:49:06 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ronportnoir @Foley62 @annmcnam @Punsetcetera Yes, difficult for the rest of us!
1316274669230661634 2020-10-14 15:08:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annmcnam @Punsetcetera This is how I always think of it Ann, might be my economics background! The cumulative misery of so many people not meeting their potential takes an individual and communal toll. And many of those folks will subsequently end up in MH services in any case, due to continuing strain
1316272323075473408 2020-10-14 14:59:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @wernerspenguin Unfortunately, I'm only able to like abs retweet this once!
1316270948576833536 2020-10-14 14:53:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @TayvaCase Thank you Tayva! I see undiagnosed neurodiverse folks everyday struggling for meaning, and to understand themselves. Of course the irony is that if you're undiagnosed, the struggle to continue to pursue the diagnosis is overwhelming! #neurodiversesquad
1316269816139968512 2020-10-14 14:49:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @wendylyon I'm not sure I'll ever understand why some health professionals choose this one condition,from hundreds in the DSM to just, not "believe" in. Folks with undiagnosed ADHD have been showing up in addiction and MH services for decades, and many MH staff are virtually unaware of it
1315909938686943232 2020-10-13 14:59:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ ❤️❤️ What do you feel they bring to the team Colette?
1315741294203985922 2020-10-13 03:49:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 Please do Nyla. Your experience and perspective is so important. Highlights how debilitating undiagnosed or poorly controlled ADHD can be, with depression an obvious consequence. This is why all levels of mental health professionals (and GPs!)need proper training in ND conditions
1315715245369962496 2020-10-13 02:05:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @nu_rave_is @mwjsimpson Yes, we havent even scraped the iceberg of the ladies yet, unfortunately. The women I meet are more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety, depression and even autism, before having their much needed diagnosis of ADD/ADHD
1315649198000418816 2020-10-12 21:43:07 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @beccalamjig sounds brilliant Becca!! Would love to read :)
1315647837976305665 2020-10-12 21:37:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @beccalamjig Oh Kristeva ❤️
1315560064024014848 2020-10-12 15:48:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AGingerxyz @n_moran1 Ugh. You deserve to be respected and collaborated with. You're the one impacted
1315554384768569344 2020-10-12 15:26:21 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ruthgibson35 @Finnattentive You're really raising awareness Ruth! And it brings such weight being a GP!
1315552438816997376 2020-10-12 15:18:37 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annmcnam @Finnattentive Exactly. But I guess, since it's a bias, they are unaware? Very difficult to reverse!
1315551267805163521 2020-10-12 15:13:58 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annmcnam @Finnattentive Why do so many medical "professionals" reject ADHD? It's almost victorian in its moral judgement. Not only will they not refer you (their job) but they tell you you're wrong, it's only in boys, "well everyone in America has it, so they would've got you". It's negligence!
1315550569029922818 2020-10-12 15:11:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ewanffc16 Thanks Ewan!
1315546389192101888 2020-10-12 14:54:35 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Finnattentive Yes thats what bothered me @Finnattentive. There is a perception of there that "everyone is getting diagnised with ADHD, and ritalin is being given out like smarties". If anything, ADHD is still under recognised and under diagnosed, as we see from this GP who is the gatekeeper!
1315543076513943552 2020-10-12 14:41:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 @mwjsimpson 100%
1315542444042268672 2020-10-12 14:38:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ruthgibson35 @mwjsimpson Yes, this letter stinks. You're not accepting the referral, fine. But to humiliate someone they haven't actually met? To put their name to such a scathing response to presumably a fairly standard referral? Medical Council!
1315536081882734593 2020-10-12 14:13:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson A diagnosis can change everything for the #neurodiversesquad  https://t.co/lxAMoX9xYz
1315535403223601153 2020-10-12 14:10:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson But the response to the referral. I am so sorry that in what was such a stressful time for you, you had to see that letter which would tend to reinforce your own worst thoughts, and the prevailing biased narrative that people don't have ADHD, "you just need to work harder"
1315533870566080512 2020-10-12 14:04:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson For the GPs who are aware of hyperactive ADHD boys (the most basic level of ADHD knowledge) WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY GO? This GP has merely displayed their own bias and ignorance of a condition that affects mimimum 2% of the population may be as much as 6%.
1315532496168255488 2020-10-12 13:59:23 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson It's the optimist in me that continues to be surprised that in 2020, not 1970, we are getting GPs opinions on college courses, and "snowflakeism" rather than compassion for what was obviously a very heartfelt plea for help.
1315531452042358784 2020-10-12 13:55:14 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson I am so sorry. This is unfortunately common. If you arrived in with reported symptoms of a heart problem or literally any other condition you should (!?) be sent for referral without judgement. We also know you're not exaggerating your GPs reaction due to the prejudiced response.
1315528854786781184 2020-10-12 13:44:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mwjsimpson @ruthgibson35 see Matthews interaction with his GP and the rejected referral!

1315015419267362823 2020-10-11 03:44:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RebeccaTwinley @DianaSheridan11 Totally understand!
1315005970985218048 2020-10-11 03:07:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RebeccaTwinley I was really inspired by you all Rebecca and particularly @DianaSheridan11. Just explaining a bit of my own story, what do you think of #clinicianswithconditions #?  https://t.co/SYvS2vBmnr

1314975348589813760 2020-10-11 01:05:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @meganjrenee You absolutely raise the quality of the interactions on here and add so much positivity and warmth. You're a treasure!

1314863159577063424 2020-10-10 17:39:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @kalessandram @DyspraxicWomen @DyspraxicCircle @dyspraxiaIRL @DYSPRAXIAFDTN Yes exactly. I've spent a lifetime coming up with solutions to everyday problems, really helps my OT practise 😁
1314861358081507329 2020-10-10 17:32:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @annmcnam Oh I'm glad that point came across, I'm often inarticulate too! Thanks a million @annmcnam
1314856676328189952 2020-10-10 17:13:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @PKpaulking Oh thank you Paul! Just trying to raise some awareness about the experiences of #neurodiversesquad Mimimum 20% of the population, may be as much as 30%, and yet few are aware of dyspraxia
1314834920192331776 2020-10-10 15:47:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Katie__Fay @DCU Ah Katie that is so kind! Sometimes we need to just put things out there!
1314829976001228800 2020-10-10 15:27:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen Agreed
1314687000293892097 2020-10-10 05:59:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrClaraOByrne @SenKidsIreland Thanks a million Clara, quite nervous posting it! Feel it's important for clinicians to open up, if they can. Dyspraxia and associated difficulties still poorly recognised, and we need more awareness :)
1314686151366762499 2020-10-10 05:56:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 Oh thanks Nyla, really appreciate that. just a snapshot in to my life. I feel dyspraxia is still poorly recognised and understood, and as you say the overall knock on effects of neurodiversity.
1314598222812323840 2020-10-10 00:06:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> And I think about the kids that I have met, that have much more significant needs than I did, who need help now, who need support now, and yes need a label now, so that they are supported, and don't still, at age 40, tell themselves they are stupid and clumsy.
1314598221335977984 2020-10-10 00:06:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> A label makes things make sense, that never made sense before, when all you felt was “wrong”. And when I see Disability Services backed up, AON delayed by years, CAMHS underfunded, SNAs cut, I think about every kid out there like me, who was awkward and didn’t quite fit in.
1314598219779899392 2020-10-10 00:06:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> The realisation that I have dyspraxia has been such a relief. It has helped me accept myself, and erode some of those negative thoughts about myself. Many people dislike labels, but that one word can help a person make sense of their entire existence. #neurodiversesquad
1314598218337071105 2020-10-10 00:06:53 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Low self esteem, anxiety and depression are common. So not only are there difficulties just doing things, you feel bad about not being able to do things the same as everyone else.
1314598216919384069 2020-10-10 00:06:53 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> As I’m writing this, it feels quite exposing. Particularly my regular embarrassment around others. And that leads to one of the other common issues for neurodiverse people. Mental health issues arising out of these everyday challenges.
1314598215380021249 2020-10-10 00:06:53 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> It happens that often, that I should act automatically. Pick up the glass, get a towel. Two simple steps. But in the moment, I flounder, and often need help to solve this. This is particularly embarrassing around people I don’t know, e.g. in restaurants.
1314598213677199360 2020-10-10 00:06:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> The worst is when I spill a drink/jug, which I do at least weekly, I panic. All at once, every accident I’ve ever had is brought to the surface, and I am paralysed. “you’re stupid and clumsy Susan” is what I think every single time.
1314598211663933446 2020-10-10 00:06:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I can speak too quickly if panicked. My short term memory can be poor. I’m sometimes slow to follow conversation. I’m messy, and I struggle to keep order, or try to make a plan of where to begin to get things under control. All of the above are exacerbated the more tired I am.
1314598210137141249 2020-10-10 00:06:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I can struggle with fine and gross motor coordination, and this can be embarrassing around new people.  But I’ve always felt that the cognitive aspect has affected me just as much if not more than the physical. I often speak too loudly, which I find hugely embarrassing.
1314598208518205441 2020-10-10 00:06:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> As an occupational therapist, I assessed young people for dyspraxia. I had to show them something,they had to repeat it,and I had to throw a ball for them to catch. I struggled significantly in administering the assessment,although, that usually led to a good laugh with the kids
1314598206920065024 2020-10-10 00:06:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> In saying that,I was average at sports,good at some,but I have always been prone to falling and bumping into things. I broke a lot of dishes growing up because I would squeeze glasses too tight when I was drying them,or let them slip out of my hand. A problem that continues today
1314598205443764225 2020-10-10 00:06:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Thought: stick out your arm and catch that ball.  Result: arm doesn’t move quickly enough,or it moves to the wrong place, or my fingers don’t close properly,letting it slip through. oh and maybe I also fall over trying to complete this simple task.
1314598203937914880 2020-10-10 00:06:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I'm dyspraxic. I have dyspraxia. What is it? A disorganisation of information from your body to your brain, and back again. @DyspraxicWomen @DyspraxicCircle @dyspraxiaIRL @DYSPRAXIAFDTN @OT_Expert #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020 1/?

1314513820157710339 2020-10-09 18:31:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @KirraneNiall @lee_o_nee @AOTInews Missed it as there are so many good sessions on at the same time! But will definitely be watching the video when available #aoti2020
1314512344525963264 2020-10-09 18:25:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HannahC95215681 I may not make it Hannah, due to competing high quality sessions, but will definitely be watching the video when available. Best of luck! #aoti2020
1314510826397667334 2020-10-09 18:19:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AineEODea @PaulineBolandOT @naomialgeo @DrLynnOToole @BillWongOT @CIGleesonOT @deirdretcd @ClodaghNolan1 Yes, there's definitely several i need to watch again, and some i'll miss due to conflicts! Will be looking forward to the  videos!
1314510532842606593 2020-10-09 18:18:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Brilliant presentation by @DrLynnOToole on her  Occupational Therapy OPTIMAL programme. A 6 week self management programme with a self efficacy approach for those in community with multiple conditions. Statistically significant improvement in occupational performance. #aoti2020
1314481385122541568 2020-10-09 16:22:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Fascinating opening address from our AOTI chairperson Mary McGrath for our first virtual @AOTInews conference. No one beats OTs for innovation  #aoti2020
1314480596731736064 2020-10-09 16:19:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @mcmorrow_sharon @naomialgeo @DrLynnOToole @BillWongOT @CIGleesonOT @deirdretcd @ClodaghNolan1 @PaulineBolandOT You're as good! Hopefully some will find it helpful!
1314297805171838979 2020-10-09 04:13:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen Yes, you're dead right, on all counts
1314296793367220225 2020-10-09 04:09:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen Plusly, apprenticeships are hard work, with many going on to start own businesses, involving multiple complex tasks, as well as their vocation. So college isn't for everyone, and apprenticeships are for some, but not for everyone either!
1314295666974302218 2020-10-09 04:04:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen I work with college students from every background, everyday, who are on the wrong course/not ready for college/should be doing an apprenticeship. The emphasis for everyone should be on what would be good for you /want do you want to do, rather than Uni for everyone.
1314291927983034374 2020-10-09 03:49:48 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrTinaMcGrath @ddockeryOT Yes agreed! Really good range of topics. Best of luck to you too ☺️
1314285079762554884 2020-10-09 03:22:35 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @PaulineBolandOT @naomialgeo @DrLynnOToole @BillWongOT @CIGleesonOT @deirdretcd @ClodaghNolan1 @AineEODea Oh yes, v interested in she DCD updates
1314270768449163264 2020-10-09 02:25:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ADDamexists I notice that "Incidence and severity of unexpected adverse events related to the study product" (how damaging the treatment is) is one of the outcome measures. Classy.
1314241840724561923 2020-10-09 00:30:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrTinaMcGrath  and @ddockeryOT I'll have to wait for the videos for yours, as we're all on at the same time 😭
1314241838702825473 2020-10-09 00:30:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Can't wait to see all the brilliant presentations tomorrow. Getting very nervous of course for my own! Looking forward to seeing @naomialgeo @DrLynnOToole @BillWongOT @CIGleesonOT @deirdretcd @ClodaghNolan1 @PaulineBolandOT
1314156271143211008 2020-10-08 18:50:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FayeEmily1976 @TfL This is really brilliant! A really good summary of the ways dyspraxia can affect different people. Well done @TfL #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020
1314130598710128641 2020-10-08 17:08:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ADDamexists I would LOVE to see the participant information leaflet. Will this cure autism? No, but it could permanently damage your child!
1314130182450622469 2020-10-08 17:07:05 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ADDamexists I am aware of some of it, but it should be consigned to history. Why would you force a dangerous unnecessary stem cell transplant on someone who isn't unwell? On kids as young as 2?
1314101369465384960 2020-10-08 15:12:35 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ADDamexists How did this get ethical approval???
1313860537608998912 2020-10-07 23:15:37 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @PeterMcGuireIE Many clients have told me they feel "more absent minded" than normal, a shorter attention span, leading to poor recall. Partly caused by the ongoing uncertainty. You think of something to do, and then realised, oh no, I can't do that, and people find their attention darting
1313449464829546497 2020-10-06 20:02:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BillWongOT Yes, and for countries where there isn't a large Ted scene, and for those us who have offered our services and been rebuffed, what do you recommend?
1313437883253096448 2020-10-06 19:16:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BillWongOT I'd steer clear of the Trump comparisons at AOTI!
1313430473058783233 2020-10-06 18:46:41 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BillWongOT Its a huge demand, in addition to family/personal life, and if you are already involved with your own associations volunteering
1313392166098665472 2020-10-06 16:14:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BillWongOT What role do you see for OTs in Ted? As presenters? If so, what kind of topics?
1313241843962916865 2020-10-06 06:17:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @psychpolis Yes I know not all clients are tech savvy but many are. And maybe facilitating them to use tech, where possible,could help support their mental health,and small numbers can still be in person This virus has completely changed our world,we need to change too,and be smart about it.
1313241647031951360 2020-10-06 06:16:22 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @psychpolis This can be done safely through hybrid, remote and in person, obviously with safety in mind. Remember, private therapists, of all stripes, are continuing to provide services as they are essential workers. The HSE has had over 6 months to figure this out. It can be done.
1313241542128263169 2020-10-06 06:15:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @psychpolis Has to be commitment to opening services in a meaningful way - facilitating "access anywhere" or zoom for mental health professionals, and not deploying them to covid testing, when over 70,000 signed up for Irelands call. We need smarter use of resources, as well as cash.
1313078510400004096 2020-10-05 19:28:07 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Aoifegq oh great thanks @Aoifegq I knew there was one somewhere!
1313073478053101569 2020-10-05 19:08:07 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LucyThePoet I would sign you a video, but you know I'd mess it up 😅
1313073287803662336 2020-10-05 19:07:22 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @beatingblog Excellent point, well made. Can i put in a punt for bathtub booze and microwaved nachos?🧐
1313072589628231691 2020-10-05 19:04:35 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LucyThePoet You'll be brilliant - you're so inclusive and warm! Go n-eiri leat!
1313062608501698563 2020-10-05 18:24:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Also, is there a list of more gifty things? Grma, thanking you!
1313062370764353536 2020-10-05 18:23:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> #irishtwitter hive mind, I know there's a list with all local shops that are doing delivery or take out, restaurants, fruit n veg shops, all that stuff. Can someone link me to it? Keep losing it :) I really need to be on this for whatevers coming!
1313059571892654080 2020-10-05 18:12:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @ciarakellydoc @AislinnOT As OTs we know that any one of us can become sick or chronically ill anytime, shifting a person into the "other" category. I think the "Us and them" brigade would feel differently then, if they were in the "at risk" category. Compassion, please, from the broadcaster of the year?
1313058361471127553 2020-10-05 18:08:03 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @ciarakellydoc @AislinnOT Brid, wishing you a full recovery! I can't believe how divisive this pundit (former GP!!!!) is being. Let's come up with good solutions for everyone. "Us and them" is absolutely the wrong attitude, and won't solve anything but only creates more division and unrest
1313033387213574145 2020-10-05 16:28:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RathVivian @mshevlin23 @SchoolofEdTCD @aheadireland @mccartpm @TCDdeanresearch @nevillecox16 @TCDAbility @tcddublin @IDTCD @emmaefarrell @paddy_wall @_IHREC @HEAaccess @pjprendergast @msmaryquirke Great Vivian, hope it will help us guide services! Best of luck with Viva :)

1312766026019463168 2020-10-04 22:46:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @steveohrourke You're more magnanimous than I would be!
1312726003001761794 2020-10-04 20:07:23 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @holly_ilex Yes. Same.
1312725771539165185 2020-10-04 20:06:27 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @steveohrourke I'm so sorry! I didn't know you were in that unfortunate group - of getting unsolicited "medical" advice. People need to mind their business. You've enough to be getting on with without that. It's a privilege to us if you share your experience. Honestly they need to jog on.
1312723695283171330 2020-10-04 19:58:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @davida_hartman @AdamPHarris @Fi_ferris @AsIAmIreland @adult_autism Ooh sounds exciting!
1312697664799203330 2020-10-04 18:14:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Lotty_ONeill These are fantastic Charlotte, thank you! I will stick them on the office wall, if I ever return to my office! Really captures the variability in dyspraxia, which is what keeps it underrecognised!
1312518085597777920 2020-10-04 06:21:11 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ClareTaylorBU Oh you're very on the ball! I must try and get ours done before Halloween!
1312387643108470785 2020-10-03 21:42:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @lgalbraithedge @ClareTaylorBU I do movement breaks, no matter the audience, at least one poll if not more, ask for "answers in the chat box", annotate feature in zoom can be a lot of fun, breakout rooms with guided structure, can do feedback through a spokesperson or through padlet. I can email some stuff...?
1312376228624596992 2020-10-03 20:57:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen @pacwomanpod @sorobotic @LindyMean @Trickstersworld We all need to listen! We here in ireland know more than anyone that silence allows abuse to flourish. It takes huge strength and vulnerability to tell these stories, and the survivors deserve at the minimum our respect and attention.
1312374205309161472 2020-10-03 20:49:27 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill @TempleStreetHos This is all very exciting!
1312373730023297025 2020-10-03 20:47:34 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen @pacwomanpod @sorobotic @LindyMean @Trickstersworld Of the spectrum of abuse, from verbal harassment to rape, and the ways survivors sometimes minimise their experiences, just to be able to keep doing their job and living their life. A must listen. Sincere thank you ladies.
1312373021202669568 2020-10-03 20:44:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen @pacwomanpod @sorobotic @LindyMean @Trickstersworld Well I knew this would be tough,but it so worth listening to. Tremendous wisdom from @sorobotic @LindyMean @LindaOkaythen about their experiences in comedy. Their stories  provide powerful insight into women in male dominated professions such comedy, but also the wider context...
1312360330903814144 2020-10-03 19:54:20 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @eadaoin118 @expertcycles Yes do!

1311993749388615680 2020-10-02 19:37:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Just visited a gorgeous new food truck in #rathfarnhamvillage "The Window Box" beside @expertcycles smart selection of brekkie and lunch options, and definitely veggie friendly! When you've been working at home for 7 months, these places are a lifeline #shoplocal  https://t.co/HUIwk2je23
1311959125635600384 2020-10-02 17:20:05 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @libby_fincham Hi Libby, happy to chat - third level disability services if thats any help :)
1311932216587563008 2020-10-02 15:33:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Still relevant a month later @naomialgeo
1311932002116005888 2020-10-02 15:32:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic I think you've hit the nail on the head there! There is no HSCP "director" at table  https://t.co/OuS5nvdc4J HIQA thing is another example of same  https://t.co/QckIyM4vpG Once again Covid is throwing a light on serious deficiencies in our system, and patients bearing the brunt
1311929967010250753 2020-10-02 15:24:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LornaHFlanagan @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic God that's awful Lorna! So frustrating for you and your team.
1311928223861805056 2020-10-02 15:17:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic I also wonder if the top "leadership" know that the therapists and teams they are redeploying, are in a position to be and should be providing services. Can we provide 100% normal service, prob not, but with a sensible mix of remote and in person, we could get close
1311927537178685443 2020-10-02 15:14:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic This is it Brid. The same reason it's taken months for HSE staff to get set up with laptops, and zoom/access anywhere. They are not trusted to work from home under normal circumstances, and there's now been a scramble for 6 months to come up with solutions.
1311926918762115073 2020-10-02 15:12:06 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LornaHFlanagan @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic It's very strange! You're working, you want to support your clients, but some of the team redeployed. Specialist therapists redeployed to swabbing. No disrespect to the swabbers, but we've had 6 months to train others up, who maybe aren't needed for frontline health intervention
1311792085763346432 2020-10-02 06:16:19 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BridDunneOT @DrZeroCraic Yes exactly, and because "staff must be kept busy" they're redeployed, when there's each no reason community services can't be running. As has been said, private physiotherapists abs OTs are working.
1311791083433742336 2020-10-02 06:12:20 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @helenrottier What a fantastic introduction Helen 👏 Hello! #DisInHigherEd is new to me,I'll have to start using it!
1311748645860126722 2020-10-02 03:23:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @donalmulligan @K_M_Morrison 100%
1311737518908485633 2020-10-02 02:39:30 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @donalmulligan @K_M_Morrison That's really helpful @donalmulligan I will try that for my next workshop!
1311420741783519233 2020-10-01 05:40:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill @naomialgeo Yes,some not able to do actual job of providing therapies due to redeployment,and certainly beneath notice of high powered evidence based steering groups.Why bother training us at all?Does the HSE know that it's not just Dr's that use evidenced based treatment. Is the govt OK?
1311268840945471490 2020-09-30 19:37:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead So true, a very complex issue, but would be vastly helped by teachers having more mandatory special needs &amp; disability training
1311259475647627264 2020-09-30 18:59:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead I know i overuse the word "baffle" but so many things seem to baffle me.Majority of disabled kids are mainstreamed. And teachers are still discriminating against them and other staff, because they only had one module (or class!) on "SEN" which focused on dyslexia. We need better!
1311257839512551424 2020-09-30 18:53:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead Yes and its really worrying for an educator, where so many kids are mainstreamed - this exemplary teacher out here doing their best, being told to battle "it", will kids be told the same? Just battle hyperactivity, anxiety, epilepsy...!
1311203612874297344 2020-09-30 15:17:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert @cadbto @AOTInews @KirraneNiall @musedNeuroOT @radiographerben @RainbowNHSBadge Fantastic, thanks for sharing @OT_Expert, I will read when I have a chance #cpdfriday
1311197835543687170 2020-09-30 14:54:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HIQA You want a sustainable response but ignore mental healthAnd vital responses to long covid such as occupational therapy, speech therapy dieticts, social Work, physiotherapists and other professionals, who will actually be working from primary to tertiary to support recovery #HSCP
1311196084413313024 2020-09-30 14:48:02 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HIQA Since there are 2 scientists, a nurse, and 34 doctors, its technically multidisciplinary, but not any established meaning of that word. The Hse and govt continues to baffle me. They train at least 15 different vocations for free, and then completely ignore all of them, forever
1311049984570163203 2020-09-30 05:07:29 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DeirdreDevers @AOTInews Yes, several at the same time I want to go to. A really good programme for the day. Conference crew @AOTInews have played a blinder so far! Looking forward to next week!
1310558868506914818 2020-09-28 20:35:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @CalCommons It genuinely is so heart warming. Definitely counts as self care. Enjoy!
1310555574195683329 2020-09-28 20:22:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @CalCommons An antidote for these times!  https://t.co/Q8cF0vpREE

1310538143012130818 2020-09-28 19:13:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> September means we @dcu @DCUautism are back to doing our awareness sessions with staff on autism, #autismfriendlyuniversity, and supporting our autistic students.

Its almost like being on holiday, with a wee glimpse into 29 european countries. Its always great to hear from our international colleagues, and this year, obviously, some reflection on the impact of Covid, among other join concerns

1309782303309279232 2020-09-26 17:10:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> delighted to be representing @AOTInews and Irish OT at @COTECEurop ☺️ Virtually this year, but great to be connecting with the OT associations from 29 European Countries 🇮🇪🇪🇺
1309501309096284163 2020-09-25 22:33:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @_allisulli You're very welcome!
1309501237071622144 2020-09-25 22:33:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @_allisulli At AOTI, We thought this guide was very good: suitable for all therapists in mental health   https://t.co/xraDLfiPS8
1309500022388596737 2020-09-25 22:28:29 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @_allisulli See Muriel Cummins site, she provides tele health but also educates about it. She could do a class maybe?   https://t.co/GXzToqZTnI Also WFOT has some resources  https://t.co/G68VZbBq1s Also AOTA, although I think you need to be a member to access most  https://t.co/aO1JALOnca
1309496396853194752 2020-09-25 22:14:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen @pacwomanpod @sorobotic @LindyMean @Trickstersworld Looking forward to it, but I know it's going  to be a tough listen. Thanks to you and your guests
1309493982737637376 2020-09-25 22:04:29 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @_allisulli Do you mean a resource about tele health or a direct service?
1309400031338921985 2020-09-25 15:51:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RachelFederDU Plague '99, Z for Zachariah
1309105377175371776 2020-09-24 20:20:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AmeliaSansomeOT This is really common Amelia! Think about it in a graded way - can I do this some of the time, maybe in smaller class groups, or tutorials, or in breakout rooms to start with? Or for a few minutes in larger groups? If can't manage that, remember to use the chat box to join in!
1309104536351641601 2020-09-24 20:16:58 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson As I say, given the relatively small cohort, and the small window of time for which blockers are relevant, the low cost, and the difficulty actually getting this treatment, this is a low probability. Better worry about lack of timely treatment, than overprescription imo
1309091006210551808 2020-09-24 19:23:12 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson Thanks Russ. I'm just geniuinely confused. You support trans treatment, you accept there is no evidence of over prescription of blockers? Given the small window, and stretched services, this is in fact unlikely to become an issue, unless there was huge investments made in TG care
1309090494018977796 2020-09-24 19:21:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson Generally, where blockers are prescribed it is to give the young person the time and space to make an informed decision. It literally gives them time.
1309088261059620865 2020-09-24 19:12:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson However, if you’re concerned about pharma influence on hormone treatment, remember that HRT is routinely given out by GPs to middle aged men and women following one appointment
1309088203719270402 2020-09-24 19:12:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson western countries, as there is huge waiting lists for assessment and treatment in gender clinics, and conservative  guidelines and regimens. In Ireland for example, typical waiting time is 2- 4 years before initial  appointment.
1309088117408882690 2020-09-24 19:11:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @docrussjackson What are you getting at here Russ? You’ve linked an 8 year old article about cases relating to offences in the 90s, in the US, about anti depressants. You’re not comparing like with like. Influence by pharma companies on endocrinologists in gender clinics is irrelevant, in most
1309062955833733127 2020-09-24 17:31:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @blkgirllostkeys Spot on René 💯
1309032825967042560 2020-09-24 15:32:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @steveohrourke @Ciarabelles This needs some workshopping 🧐
1309032535771537408 2020-09-24 15:30:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @steveohrourke @Ciarabelles Well exactly! Think of the impact on Brexit - you're playing right into Jacob Reese Moogs  hoofs
1309030851049644032 2020-09-24 15:24:10 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @steveohrourke @Ciarabelles Not your most controversial take on this website, but perhaps the most insidious? Like "not having a side" this demands that we pervert the natural order and jump out of Big Moo's buttery buttery pocket. Very unpatriotic in these times.
1308846834572501008 2020-09-24 03:12:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BillWongOT @JasSaunders1 @asiam @dyspraxiaIRL You're so right Bill, really important at the moment. Would love to see your presentation!

1308366417952153600 2020-09-22 19:23:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @jsrafuse_art @BBCNews @TomCruise That has not been proven in any large scale research i'm aware of. in fact, for those with ADHD, medication is generally a protective factor, meaning, they are less likely to be in jail, less likely to have car accidents, and less likely to be experiencing substance use problems.
1308365254842363904 2020-09-22 19:19:19 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @BBCNews This course on learning to learn "essentials for the online learner" is free for anyone, and I highly recommend. Developed by @DCU who have 20 years experience of designing distance learning courses  https://t.co/MbO6H0fHE3
1308056098826485761 2020-09-21 22:50:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrMMcMahonEP Exactly
1308055236204953602 2020-09-21 22:47:25 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrMMcMahonEP Made my day Dr Michelle, thanks fir watching! I think people are still really struggling, maybe more now, then before, as this stretches on endlessly. And I love a good shoulder tense and release, can help reframe the whole day!
1308054630161690627 2020-09-21 22:45:00 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @HollytheOT @The_HCPC @theRCOT Not that I'm aware of, but I've definitely seen an ahp for dyspraxia in the NHS I think, although I can't find it now! I think it's a fantastic idea!
1308008223493021700 2020-09-21 19:40:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @SpecialistsIRE Looking forward to more insights in to your work with employers at our session on autism and employment tomorrow !
1307997731215020032 2020-09-21 18:58:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I'm re-tweeting this webinar I did with @asiam as several people have asked me about it, with Dublin being locked down again. With ongoing uncertainty, and disruption to routine, it may be of help to some. #neurodiversesquad #askadhd #actuallyautistic @dyspraxiaIRL
1307989810339086336 2020-09-21 18:27:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> #HSCPs Please have your say in this survey on the HSE panel system!
1307325668758294537 2020-09-19 22:28:23 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 @Autistica There has been a few I'm aware of in mental health advisor roles. It's especially relevant for the neurodiverse crew, for whom there is very little services/support available in the community, so our OT services pick up some of the slack
1307320802149367809 2020-09-19 22:09:02 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @naturetable You're so kind. It was my first ever interview for a podcast,and I was very nervous, but you made it easy. Such a pleasure to work with @naturetable @Autistica Can recommend!
1307320458518372352 2020-09-19 22:07:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 You're so kind!
1307299813881516034 2020-09-19 20:45:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @VillageCrescent @LindaOkaythen On the contrary, but it certainly isn't neutral. This kind of Jordan Peterson, Conservative dressed up as concerned "won't someone think of the children" rhetoric is divisive fear mongering. Of course extremism is wrong, but once again, Ciara's answeing a question no one asked
1307279003590561793 2020-09-19 19:22:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Oh and do listen to the other episodes, they are brilliant!
1307278804017176576 2020-09-19 19:22:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen Thanks for highlighting this all into one thread Linda, she's a conservative masquerading as a centrist. She is NOT a journalist, the only thing she's qualified in is medicine and even the medical segments are iffy.
1307277540529143808 2020-09-19 19:17:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I was beyond delighted to work with @Autistica for this episode in their series of podcasts. Think about your own sensory preferences, not just things you dislike, but also what can help you manage throughout the day #OTalk #sensory #OTinHE
1307001226031173634 2020-09-19 00:59:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Beanabag @DayvieO We'll go with you!
1306906908767420418 2020-09-18 18:44:22 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Ability_OT I have to say the employers really come with an open mind, and some of them really are doing great stuff already, and then the other employers hear that x or y company is making changes, so they may be influenced to make those changes too, to remain a competitive employer.
1306905701370023938 2020-09-18 18:39:34 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bobalind haha, processing delay by me! You're kind :) I am naive I think at times. I expect the best, and i try not to assume that people will be terrible and ableist,and I think that is a helpful approach,because I'm not judgemental I just tell them "I assume you're already doing this"😅
1306899617901088773 2020-09-18 18:15:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bobalind Oh yes I agree it's not a static thing, need to be  continually improving
1306899403857448960 2020-09-18 18:14:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bobalind I'm not sure if I understand you fully, but i am certainly accused of being too optimistic frequently, and i often think as i am ND myself, and work with so many neurodiverse folks, i always see the possibilities, and the creativity, and sort of forget that this is new to many.
1306897186446127110 2020-09-18 18:05:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bobalind My approach?
1306894496437800960 2020-09-18 17:55:03 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @bobalind Good question! well just that they were focused on acceptance, which was good, but that this group, that are generally quite good, hadn't considered, hadn't even thought of, that there is benefit in diversity. And if thats a "good" company, what are the others like?
1306885866695131137 2020-09-18 17:20:46 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> “We’ve been focusing on acceptance and understanding disability, recognising invisible disabilities– we haven’t been looking at the benefits of diversity,the added creativity and perspective, and how to optimise neurodiverse employees contribution. That really opened my eyes” 2/2
1306885865344585728 2020-09-18 17:20:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Doing workshops with employers on autism and employment, in collaboration with autistic students. Got some really interesting feedback from one attender, from a really good disability employer, which surprised me: 1/2 #highered #OTalk
1306614808217870336 2020-09-17 23:23:40 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @libby_fincham Oh very good, I thought you might be moving to a similar setting to mine :) sounds like you're really enjoying it!
1306613730856316928 2020-09-17 23:19:23 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @libby_fincham What is your next placement Libby?
1306613247097933827 2020-09-17 23:17:28 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname Completely understand and agree!
1306597995819855873 2020-09-17 22:16:52 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname If you don't get them, would you consider writing to the CEO of the company/college,and briefly explain that you requested accommodations as per XY legislation,they weren't provided,and you were discriminated against. Puts the wind up them, and can cause change (more work I know)
1306338648070205440 2020-09-17 05:06:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @E_Denysiuk @Niall_Turner @DrAnnMarieMorrs @Bethanhc Thats lovely @E_Denysiuk! Looking forward to seeing you (virtually) at the @COTECEurope meeting next week 😊
1306273250431959041 2020-09-17 00:46:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LindaOkaythen We need to now more than ever Linda! People stories need to be heard, but very few people do good interviews on this. Do not retraumatise survivors on your shite podcast, please
1306267029792608256 2020-09-17 00:21:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ 😅
1306265656107716610 2020-09-17 00:16:16 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ Yes completely agree, the panel in trying to be transparent, and objective, actually ends up with the opposite, as if you don't answer the questions in a very specific way, order, and wording, you're marked down, and this really works against neurodiversity
1306265248136146944 2020-09-17 00:14:39 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ You didn't quote the charming DSM? For shame!
1306260034230333444 2020-09-16 23:53:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @FleetwoodCraic_ I really struggled with this "buzzwords" thing,probably because I'm neurodiverse, and its illogical! Like,can i not just tell you about the work i did,without saying "collaborate, inititiate, spear head,and identify". I twigged it at the end of my first panel interview, too late!
1306194432526614528 2020-09-16 19:33:15 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Sorrelish Not easy, and like the motivation to be doing cover letters etc at the moment 😑
1306192961751875584 2020-09-16 19:27:24 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> I can really recommend this episode of Seriously presented by Helen Keen, which touches on later diagnosis, women and NB folks on the spectrum, and the benefits of finding your tribe #actuallyautistic  https://t.co/ojaN9yeFmA
1306190911584559104 2020-09-16 19:19:15 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Sorrelish 💯💯💯💯You are spot on!! I think thats so hard. Like its not like you can go, oh, I'll plan a trip to visit my friend in London, that'll really keep me going in this difficult time etc. Its the not knowing!
1306189489690288130 2020-09-16 19:13:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Sorrelish This is it. I think we can all struggle to do things we need to do, and even want to do, at the best of times. For many us, any kind of wobble throws us off, so with *pandemic* , there's no clear time to re-start, and we're still unable to do some of the things we want to
1306187202280460289 2020-09-16 19:04:31 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @katexoxo245 @tcddublin @tcd_ot Best of luck! Its a fantastic course in Trinity, with great staff. and of course the best career!
1306185849382543360 2020-09-16 18:59:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Sorrelish I feel I'm struggling way more the longer it goes on. Im a health professional,and I know all the right things to do, and i'm doing most of them,but the endless uncertainty,and worry about family, and being cooped up all day,and the disruption to meaningful activities is wearing
1306125649300664321 2020-09-16 14:59:56 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @NDPractitioner Around 30% of the people I work with use identity first (much less than on twitter!!!) I tend to mirror what the person uses, and in a group switch between the two, and explain why I use both terms. If an autistic person uses person first, what meaning do you attach to that?
1306122888769089536 2020-09-16 14:48:57 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Claire_the_OT @OTNUIGalway @SiobhanSmyth2 @NUIGalwayMed What an incredible 6 years! Huge comhghairdeas leat! Would love a peep at your work 😉
1305831908308381696 2020-09-15 19:32:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @_SimonLau @LauraFMcConnell @MxOolong @otter_ai Thanks for that correction @_SimonLau I have trialled it several times and it only records my side of the conversation, so that hasn't been my experience. Thanks all the same
1305631190993559552 2020-09-15 06:15:08 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @MxOolong Dead easy to use, but video quality not as good as zoom. But the captioning is pretty good, even with Irish accents!
1305630880690561026 2020-09-15 06:13:54 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @MxOolong I know! My organisation uses zoom. I was in same boat and basically haven't come up with any solution, other than captioning after the fact. And sign lang interpreter if needed.But so many people find captions helpful! Honestly disappointed that zoom hasn't got their act together
1305629862653239299 2020-09-15 06:09:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @MxOolong I am reasonably techy, but i failed ! Google hangouts has good simultaneous captioning, as does MS teams.
1305629546163646469 2020-09-15 06:08:35 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @LauraFMcConnell @MxOolong Not easily. You can link with otter app, and pretty good captions open in a new window, but as far as I could see, each participant needs to also record individually and then it's all added up at the end. Honestly after spending about 4 hours on it, I just gave up.
1305566486929571840 2020-09-15 01:58:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> We're 3 episodes in,but I am inspired too by the role @OTooleGary played"he was  gathering as he went,all support, an awful secret knotted up in you for years,so (gary's support)was the start of an unravelling,relief that something was going to happen. You did a great job"  (Ber)
1305566485448929285 2020-09-15 01:58:01 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Anything else they do is for someone else's benefit. Exposing their stories, their selves, is to prevent someone else getting abused the way they were. That is the most selfless thing I can think of. We must listen.
1305566483758690306 2020-09-15 01:58:00 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> This testimony really converges with many things the @kavsisters have told us. as @LindaOkaythen puts it: "victims and survivors only have one job, and that's to heal as best they can from the hurt and trauma that has been inflicted on them"  https://t.co/iHRCjCiZFQ
1305566482282283008 2020-09-15 01:58:00 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> "when i look back it I wonder how you can live, how you can go to school, and sit in school, how you can sit in your house, how you can go to bed at night, how you can talk to your family, having that just happened you" Tric kearney.
1305566480797511682 2020-09-15 01:57:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Ber and Trish reflect on the dichotomy of "going to school, and living, while the parallel of the horrible abuse is going on, and yet I'm getting up and I'm training, and going to school, and I'm doing homework" "and keeping all that in" (Ber)
1305566479245508608 2020-09-15 01:57:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> Bernadette Byrne (Ber Carley now) "I often wonder what I was going to be like? i'm like this up to age 9, and the day he touched me, did he squeeze and kill whatever i was going to be?" Ber and Tric and Chalkie are eloquent and graceful. Please listen to this.
1305566477072900098 2020-09-15 01:57:59 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> TW child sexual abuse. I can understand why this listen will be tough for many,BUT it is an important, really sensitively done podcast. We have a grotesque history of hiding abuse in this country. These fearless accounts must be heard  https://t.co/wOJPEwTQ9j @Younghorgan
1305557373185073152 2020-09-15 01:21:48 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead @RoseAnnieFlo @RoseAnnieFlo would be happy to help with more specific advice if you want to DM. A really, really tough time for older people, and for those who are #probablyautistic, can be so hard when familiar things or routines are becoming impossible. Great recommendations on this thread
1305556938248335361 2020-09-15 01:20:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead @RoseAnnieFlo changing tech, even the phone, can be a bit disastrous if the person cannot get used to it, so e.g.brighter or more clear numbers on the phone -sharpie or tippex. Turning the volume up to max for them. Large printed, laminated instructions, as reminders, that can be dotted around
1305556475306278913 2020-09-15 01:18:14 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @phrenohead @RoseAnnieFlo I think your sense of it is right Sinead, there may be already someone who is in a good position to give some support on this. I would need to know more to give the right advice I think, but there may be ways to improve their existing resources without changing them, e.g. 1/?
1305555177936650241 2020-09-15 01:13:05 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdhdAngsty I see dyspraxic folk like this too. Some have autistic traits, but some don't and have just developed this "masking" to prevent the negative feedback they have got throughout their life. They are hypervigilant, fastidious and never late! And i think it's really tough for them
1305554589362593793 2020-09-15 01:10:44 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AdhdAngsty I see this all the time with my ADHDers. Many are not like this BUT some come an hour early everytime, so as not too be late, some stick rigidly to their diaries, never miss a dealine or appointment, and can be very anxious (RSDish) if they do miss something.
1304533856884850690 2020-09-12 05:34:43 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AlexThomasOT Welcome to the ranks Alex, we're very pleased to have you! Do let us know if you need any help!
1304528301545922560 2020-09-12 05:12:38 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OCallaghanCian Thanks for raising this Cian. Not only are people's human rights being violated, but successive governments have endorsed it by funding this inhumane degrading "service" #EndDirectProvision
1304089891291181057 2020-09-11 00:10:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @josephamadigan @adhdireland @Education_Ire Glad to see this. All too often I see young adults at third level with ADHD or ADHD and autism who not only have not had accommodations put in place in school, but little empathy or support from school. Teacher training on disability needs to be better, attitudes need to change!
1304088068161441793 2020-09-11 00:03:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @NDPractitioner Passed on my fifth. Got lost on the way to the test centre on my 4th 😂 #drivingwhiledyspraxic
1304062612720807938 2020-09-10 22:22:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @ruthgibson35 I find this expected but frustrating. If we say that conservatively, 20% of the population has some ND condition, then GPs should be well versed in it. What bothers me is their reluctance to refer on to an expert, which they would do, if it was other conditions.
1304032178653757446 2020-09-10 20:21:13 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @AnneRabbitte Is it for AON or "ASD waiting lists"?
1304031834339241984 2020-09-10 20:19:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @Letterstomyname Fair play! I think a lot of us struggl to ask for those accommodations, because of the exact thing that happened to you. So glad they've changed their tune!
1304025095002873856 2020-09-10 19:53:04 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 Yes definitely, I'm glad to hear that! and we would be the rankest hypocrites if we didn't!
1304024845982851074 2020-09-10 19:52:05 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 If thats what they say to your face..... I'm really sorry to hear that. But I know you're out there killing it, so their loss!
1304016455625777152 2020-09-10 19:18:45 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 ooh it grinds my gears. And still not surprising, there appears to be greater bias towards mental health conditions in health professionals towards other health professionals with mental health conditions, a sense of its ok for the "patients" but not for the professionals!
1304013109913419778 2020-09-10 19:05:27 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DonnellyStephen @AnneRabbitte Time targets or some kind of accountability would be great, so that families can have some expectation of when their child will be seen, and/or can sue the government when that's not met.
1304012446718361602 2020-09-10 19:02:49 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @DrValerieMorris @DonnellyStephen @AnneRabbitte A lack of fully staffed MDTs in this case. Whole new teams will need to be added. That takes an inordinate amount of time especially with the abominable panel system

1303998074772127749 2020-09-10 18:05:42 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @hoeyannie completely agree. What is your view on other student professionals? dentists, physios, OTs, SLTs? They are equally working with sick and vulnerable people, and offering an amazing service?

1303956195707965440 2020-09-10 15:19:18 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 i know a specific case of a mature student with ADHD who was excelling in their course (i won't specify as small world in ireland), but due to asking for some minor accommodations, his condition became known, and he was continuously targeted after that, as not being "suitable".
1303955768648105984 2020-09-10 15:17:36 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 Some settings have been good and supportive, some supervisors start to take on a therapist role (instead of educator), and some try to get people kicked off their course, as someone who has "X condition" can't be a nurse/OT/physio/doctor/dentist.
1303955406616756226 2020-09-10 15:16:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @n_moran1 anecdotally from vocational students i've worked with, and my own research (on experiences of disabled students in professional courses), i would say its a VERY mixed bag.  https://t.co/RBnn9QG8fQ

1303440183447171077 2020-09-09 05:08:51 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @elizejackson @AIGANY Also what are they getting at? Like in what way is this random list of conditions helpful, insightful, or practical for design OR diversity purposes? It's just weird, lazy and screams we don't understand diversity 🤔
1303439378509967361 2020-09-09 05:05:39 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @elizejackson @AIGANY It's also strangely specific,while vague, like it gives ADHD,but not autism,AND learning disorder and cognitive learning disorder. Depression,anxiety or PTSD, that's your lot for mental health.And wheelchair bound. Yeeeeesh. Is this a list of 10 most common TV health stereotypes?
1303405221901733888 2020-09-09 02:49:55 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @SineadOCarroll Thanks for highlighting this Sinead. These shitehawks need to wise up. It's estimated that approx 40% of people have some kind of condition that qualifies as disability (WHO) Anyone can acquire a medical condition or disability at any time, and the longer you live the more likely
1303400922979217411 2020-09-09 02:32:50 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RebeccaTwinley @OT_Expert @AOTInews @KirraneNiall @musedNeuroOT @WeAHPs @radiographerben @OTAfterDark You're so right! Such a layered issue. I have disclosed at work that I am dyspraxic. In fact I tell everyone all the time 😅 so that others may feel safe to disclose or talk. But many people can't disclos their "identities" as its not safe, and others again don't have the choice
1303398861650755591 2020-09-09 02:24:39 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @OT_Expert @Ruth_Hawley @AOTInews @KirraneNiall @musedNeuroOT @WeAHPs @radiographerben @OTAfterDark @RebeccaTwinley I mean it is excellent to promote that Occupational Therapy has a vital role to play with peoples gender and sexuality , and that in Ireland a new group has formed to discuss this 😅
1303398144982605825 2020-09-09 02:21:48 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @RebeccaTwinley @OT_Expert @AOTInews @KirraneNiall @musedNeuroOT @WeAHPs @radiographerben @OTAfterDark I thought it was brilliant,seemed to be: trans folk talking about trans representation,for a trans and wider audience.While it obviously was about trans lives,it definitely delved into intersectionality,and I felt a lot resonated with disability experience also #Disclosure2020

1303354477001560064 2020-09-08 23:28:17 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @drliamhealy @irishexaminer You're dead right Dr Healy, and of course, it shouldn't be just OTs asking this question!
1303300438633086977 2020-09-08 19:53:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill Is it @triona_sweeney writing this excellent letter?! Tens of thousands volunteered for Irelands call. OTs, SLTs, and Physios should not be redeployed, in any number, to do this.
1303232894706515969 2020-09-08 15:25:09 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @naomialgeo I hope to get to your presentation Naomi!

1301054137552056320 2020-09-02 15:07:33 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill @IrishTimes It's clearly better for kids and families, who need support to flourish, and for the kids to get most out of life. Way better for clinicians who can make the most impact the earlier the intervention, and better for the govt, as that early intervention saves money.
1301053354672619520 2020-09-02 15:04:26 +0800 <SusanMadigan3> @IrwinGill @IrishTimes "While legislation provides a statutory framework for providing assessment,it does not include a right to timely intervention, and thus intervention has been deprioritised" spot on as always @IrwinGill &amp; colleagues.The reality is that early in intervention makes sense all around.
