1326706996876349442 2020-11-12 10:02:51 +0800 <NorseTom> @hiertebrand Nu kommer jag hem  Jag simmar hem igen
1326640753091686400 2020-11-12 05:39:37 +0800 <NorseTom> @JJ_557 Thank you! But then I still don't know enough to have an opinion
1326639198296829953 2020-11-12 05:33:27 +0800 <NorseTom> 64. Capitalism  People use the term to mean a lot of different things but my take:   free-market economy = not necessarily bad  neo-liberal economics coupled with globalisation = very bad  There are many ways to construct our future economical system but pure capitalism is not it
1326637716948340739 2020-11-12 05:27:34 +0800 <NorseTom> 63. 4Chan  I never used it that much but it seems like it had an important role to play at a very specific time. Fully anonymous message boards with no heavy moderation is great though, wish they were more popular for a wider audience.
1326637075786043397 2020-11-12 05:25:01 +0800 <NorseTom> 62. Communism  Different ways to interpret it but it's a flawed ideology that does the same as capitalism in reducing humans to merely economical production units.
1326635764030058506 2020-11-12 05:19:48 +0800 <NorseTom> 61. Aliens  Don't know if they exist, don't really care.
1326635581753974784 2020-11-12 05:19:05 +0800 <NorseTom> 60. Suicide  I understand why people do it. To those thinking about it however, I urge them to at least try all the options available for changing their situation (and there are many options outside of the mental health system).
1326635579908481026 2020-11-12 05:19:04 +0800 <NorseTom> 59. Democracy  The current implementation of it is unfavourable for the good of the people. Matters of governance should be decided by those qualified for it, this can be done in many ways and democracy as a concept could be one of those ways however it currently is not.
1326635578067202051 2020-11-12 05:19:04 +0800 <NorseTom> 58. Kaczynski  His writings had a very large impact on my worldview and his predictions, conclusions and general analysis is completely correct. Very intelligent but, of course, not infallible.
1326624252246831106 2020-11-12 04:34:03 +0800 <NorseTom> 57. Evola  Very interesting and inspiring man.
1326624250342625288 2020-11-12 04:34:03 +0800 <NorseTom> 56. Moldbug  Honestly haven't followed him too much but I like him, he's smart.
1326624248350248961 2020-11-12 04:34:02 +0800 <NorseTom> 55. Karl Marx  It's important to learn from men who have had such an impact on the world. I make no claim to know of his motivations and intentions.
1326603934182629377 2020-11-12 03:13:19 +0800 <NorseTom> 54. Israel  Their methods are disgraceful but effective.
1326603932605554694 2020-11-12 03:13:19 +0800 <NorseTom> 53. Gamergate  It actually opened my eyes to a lot of things.
1326600375219220480 2020-11-12 02:59:11 +0800 <NorseTom> @swamwave Gladly
1326599700947013634 2020-11-12 02:56:30 +0800 <NorseTom> 52. Siege  Same as Das Kapital really.
1326599699672018944 2020-11-12 02:56:30 +0800 <NorseTom> 51. Das Kapital  Worth a read if you want a broad view of the world. Reading a lot of literature is really only important for the few book-minded, it's not a requirement to be politically or philosophically involved.
1326598685787103238 2020-11-12 02:52:28 +0800 <NorseTom> 50. Harry Potter  They're alright childrens books that have way to big of a place in cultural (and political) discourse.
1326598684524605440 2020-11-12 02:52:28 +0800 <NorseTom> 49. Asexuality  I can believe a rare few people lack notable sexual drive, but most who call themselves the word probably do so due to identity issues.
1326591642422419462 2020-11-12 02:24:29 +0800 <NorseTom> 48. Universal healthcare  A state should care for its people.
1326591640979582977 2020-11-12 02:24:28 +0800 <NorseTom> 47. USS Liberty Incident  What is there to say, these people have done and covered up much.
1326568120765599749 2020-11-12 00:51:01 +0800 <NorseTom> @Son_ofAlbion @hiertebrand @ashenmorning @vanhandling @BasedBee @swordpilled @demelzv @asforme8 @ManFromTheWall @Brgants @Perriwinkle20 Honoured, king
1326567799960068096 2020-11-12 00:49:44 +0800 <NorseTom> 46. Pridnestrovie  I don't know what it is and I don't feel the need to know.
1326567798781452288 2020-11-12 00:49:44 +0800 <NorseTom> 45. Open plan offices  Offices in general are a very unnatural environment for people to work in, I'm sure open plan comes with pros and cons.
1326567215005650944 2020-11-12 00:47:25 +0800 <NorseTom> So going by likes, this is my opinion with the most public approval.
1326566182288302082 2020-11-12 00:43:18 +0800 <NorseTom> 44. Reddit  I have never used it, seems like a place that fosters its own cult-y communities of people addicted to attention and approval (much like other places on the internet).
1326566181118103552 2020-11-12 00:43:18 +0800 <NorseTom> 43. Long-distance relationships  I'm in a moderately long-distance one. It's not preferrable, but if you're meant for eachother it will work out.
1326565679710040065 2020-11-12 00:41:19 +0800 <NorseTom> 42. Nationalism  The term has been misused a lot. But a state caring for and promoting its own people over others is common sense to me, and a love for one's nation is too (which includes a healthy balance of romanticism and skepticism, wanting it to be the best it can be).
1326564931559419905 2020-11-12 00:38:20 +0800 <NorseTom> 41. Nick Land  A general rule for philosophers is that none of them are "right" but all of them say something useful. Take from accelerationism what you can and apply it, but don't treat it as a religion.
1326563770655707138 2020-11-12 00:33:43 +0800 <NorseTom> 40. Meninism  It was kind of funny at the time, I sure hope no one took it seriously.
1326563030625345536 2020-11-12 00:30:47 +0800 <NorseTom> 39. Feminism  The meaning of the term has been completely changed and fragmented, no one can definitively say what it means. My take on men and women in general:  We are different and should strive to work as complements, not competition.
1326562485730734086 2020-11-12 00:28:37 +0800 <NorseTom> 38. Dissolution of the Soviet Union  I don't really have an opinion on historical events like this. I can understand why it happened, I can analyze the consequences of it, not sure what else there is to be said.
1326562484480831490 2020-11-12 00:28:37 +0800 <NorseTom> 37. Free speech  Laws should be reasonable regarding things like threats and public defamation etc. but other than that you should be able to say whatever.
1326562483298054148 2020-11-12 00:28:37 +0800 <NorseTom> 36. Body positivity  I don't mind it as a concept, but it's being framed in entirely the wrong way. If you have an unhealthy body you shouldn't hate yourself for it, but you should strive to improve.
1326562482241081346 2020-11-12 00:28:36 +0800 <NorseTom> 35. John McAfee  A real character. We're living in times of tragedy, and people like him let us appreciate the comedy of it.
1326562481037336579 2020-11-12 00:28:36 +0800 <NorseTom> 34. Tattoos  If someone gets a stupid one they have to live with it,which is fine. A more or less tasteful or meaningful one, I don't mind on me/a partner/my future child/whoever.
1326562479913250822 2020-11-12 00:28:36 +0800 <NorseTom> 33. Han unification  I really don't know what this is.
1326562478822711296 2020-11-12 00:28:35 +0800 <NorseTom> 32. Neopronouns  I don't know what this is but see my answer to 3. I guess.
1326562477472092173 2020-11-12 00:28:35 +0800 <NorseTom> 31. Internet culture  It's full of subcultures but in general it's fascinating to study, though it has probably had a very negative effect on the minds of youths overall.
1326560219011440641 2020-11-12 00:19:37 +0800 <NorseTom> 30. He/him lesbians  I don't understand.
1326560217765720069 2020-11-12 00:19:36 +0800 <NorseTom> 29. Saying the n-word  For me you can say whatever you want, just don't be a sperg about it. The "debate" on free speech has been repeated so many times now, you don't need my opinion on it.
1326559422735405059 2020-11-12 00:16:27 +0800 <NorseTom> 28. Fascism  Most people have no idea what it actually is. The purely political ideology was a product of its time that we should learn from, the broader meta-physical meaning of the ideology is more interesting.
1326559421498060801 2020-11-12 00:16:27 +0800 <NorseTom> 27. Femboys  Men who give up on achieving masculinity are a sorry sight.
1326559420197769220 2020-11-12 00:16:26 +0800 <NorseTom> 26. Fake freckles  They look cute I guess? Kinda weird though, like a modern version of the fake moles.
1326558484171730946 2020-11-12 00:12:43 +0800 <NorseTom> @MikeOfHoc I agree with you and it does seem like America really sticks out in this regard.
1326558322301018120 2020-11-12 00:12:04 +0800 <NorseTom> 25. Cultural appropriation  Cultures change over time, sometimes due to influences and exchanges with other ones. Nothing inherently wrong with it, but in todays globally connected world it has become a real problem where everything is being mixed into a homogenous grey mass.
1326557718493212672 2020-11-12 00:09:40 +0800 <NorseTom> 24. Public breastfeeding  Baby's gotta eat, grow up strong. Don't be weird about it.
1326557717289459715 2020-11-12 00:09:40 +0800 <NorseTom> 23. Pansexuality  Anyone who has unconventional sexual urges, I encourage to go a full few weeks or even months without sexual stimuli or porn and see if these urges persist. And if they do, well, you don't have to act upon them.
1326557715968253954 2020-11-12 00:09:40 +0800 <NorseTom> 22. Hentai/porn  Don't. Truly one of the biggest problems among young men today.  https://t.co/IyUZV9hlT9
1326557713027969025 2020-11-12 00:09:39 +0800 <NorseTom> 21. Anime  I like some of it. Can't judge a whole art form or media because some of it is degenerate, since most media is going that way in today's world.
1326557711857840131 2020-11-12 00:09:39 +0800 <NorseTom> 20. Rape in marriage  It happens and it's deplorable.
1326556080277745664 2020-11-12 00:03:10 +0800 <NorseTom> 19. Barack Obama  Any opinion anyone has of him is entirely shaped by what media they got information of him through. Giving him the peace prize was a spit in the face of Alfred Nobel.
1326555517930627074 2020-11-12 00:00:56 +0800 <NorseTom> 18. Modern architecture  Not all bad but many architects are forgetting their purpose of making buildings people actually want to live in. Many problems stem from growth of cities being "artificial" in the sense that it's not humans desiring these projects, it's some city planner
1326555516399595520 2020-11-12 00:00:55 +0800 <NorseTom> 17. Donald Trump  We've had some good memes.
1326555514772205575 2020-11-12 00:00:55 +0800 <NorseTom> 16. Capital punishment  Yes.
1326555513568587777 2020-11-12 00:00:55 +0800 <NorseTom> 15. Drag queens  A sexual fetish, keep it to yourself.
1326554566305984512 2020-11-11 23:57:09 +0800 <NorseTom> 14. Pedophilia  Truly one of the worst, most evil acts imaginable.
1326554565135667205 2020-11-11 23:57:09 +0800 <NorseTom> 13. Rape  Abhorrent
1326554563772477444 2020-11-11 23:57:08 +0800 <NorseTom> 12. Adultery  A betrayal of trust, despicable.
1326554562224824320 2020-11-11 23:57:08 +0800 <NorseTom> 11. Joe Biden  Puppet
1326554560580612107 2020-11-11 23:57:08 +0800 <NorseTom> 10. Integralism  Faith and law should be in the hands of separate entities, but intertwined through culture and the broader goals of society.
1326554559209111552 2020-11-11 23:57:07 +0800 <NorseTom> 9. Gun laws  Depends on the state of society at large really. But as a general rule I think gun ownership should be legal but regulated.
1326552567795445762 2020-11-11 23:49:12 +0800 <NorseTom> @PipPlays Wrong use of words from my side! I do mean the more general term killing yes
1326552360282320901 2020-11-11 23:48:23 +0800 <NorseTom> 8. Furries  Many people become weird through overexposure to niche internet subcultures, porn addiction, and the seeking of approval within a community. In a healthy society they would simply not exist.
1326552358696882184 2020-11-11 23:48:23 +0800 <NorseTom> 7. K-pop  Seems like a very harmful and exploitative industry to both the performers and the fans.
1326552357199507457 2020-11-11 23:48:22 +0800 <NorseTom> 6. Twitter  An amazing resource for finding like-minded people and if you tailor your tl you can get something positive out of it. Just don't get addicted or care too much about fake dumb online stuff.
1326552355823706115 2020-11-11 23:48:22 +0800 <NorseTom> 5. Camgirls  The girls are being exploited by a harmful system, same as many of the guys watching.
1326552354313793536 2020-11-11 23:48:22 +0800 <NorseTom> 4. Polyamory  I personally feel it would devalue the relationship and any children born with parents in such a constellation would probably not benefit, but rather the opposite.
1326552352912891904 2020-11-11 23:48:21 +0800 <NorseTom> 3. Non-binary identity  Any notion of gender outside of biological is unnecessary
1326550778325028866 2020-11-11 23:42:06 +0800 <NorseTom> 2. LGBT community  I feel sorry for people who are unable to have a relationship that involves biological children. The "community" seems to have a mostly negative impact on society at large, wanting the norm to conform to fringe opinions.
1326550776924102662 2020-11-11 23:42:05 +0800 <NorseTom> 1. Abortion  Abortion is murder, and murder is justifiable in certain cases.
1326549817380622339 2020-11-11 23:38:17 +0800 <NorseTom> Since everyone else is doing it  https://t.co/kxb8ej07Ho

1325907835977408514 2020-11-10 05:07:16 +0800 <NorseTom> A man's life is short, why spend it in hardship?  "If the old gods are dead, the blood of men gives birth anew."  Bold claim, that birthing divinity falls upon you.  "I am but a pebble on the path towards the worshipped."
1325907834559664129 2020-11-10 05:07:16 +0800 <NorseTom> Why, little soldier, why do you fight?  "To safeguard my loved ones, to protect hearth and home."  To end up a statistic in some dusty old tome?  "A man, not a number, will earn his birthright."

1324842857216299008 2020-11-07 06:35:26 +0800 <NorseTom> @hiertebrand I don't watch a lot of movies and my taste is pretty simple. Drive, Blade runner, Stalker, Taxi driver etc  But one lesser known one that I really really like is called Inside Llewyn Davis! Gorgeously bleak movie of a folk musician who just has a really shitty life.

1324829586245459981 2020-11-07 05:42:42 +0800 <NorseTom> @Bardfash And it represents humanity and familiarity in a way! A small man-made source of light to combat the great darkness, even if just in a small area...
1324828524566482945 2020-11-07 05:38:29 +0800 <NorseTom> I'm not the biggest fan of democracy but sometimes the mob's opinion aligns with my own, the candles are a pretty clean look. Kino and lindy one might say, if one knew what those terms meant!

1324794531624210435 2020-11-07 03:23:24 +0800 <NorseTom> I thought of this while talking to the moon, who I have always felt a stronger devotion and familiarity to than the sun.
1324794032007110662 2020-11-07 03:21:25 +0800 <NorseTom> Gaze at the starry sky and it's not difficult to understand the infinitely more imaginative and magical view of the world our ancestors had before light pollution, constant stimulation and sterile modern science.  Can you achieve this magic today? I intend to do my best.
1324788919116980239 2020-11-07 03:01:06 +0800 <NorseTom> This is the most important poll I've seen in a long time

1320288569093742597 2020-10-25 16:58:19 +0800 <NorseTom> @econtributor My dreams usually occur in a sort of "dream version" of places I've spent a lot of time in. There is a whole town based on my home town, and one based on Stockholm, that I return to again and again. The different sections don't always connect logically but they're always the same

1317119603009593346 2020-10-16 23:05:58 +0800 <NorseTom> @ashenmorning @swamwave It really counts for a lot ❤️
1317119360599732229 2020-10-16 23:05:01 +0800 <NorseTom> Den tradition vi måste bära in i morgondagen består inte av dessa reliker från en svunnen tid, den består av visdomen. Visdomen från miljontals svenskar och allt de gjorde för att deras efterkommande skulle få det bättre, visdomen från de som gav svensken allt han nu förvanskat.
1317119359228280832 2020-10-16 23:05:00 +0800 <NorseTom> Detta är vad som sker med ett samhälle utan en grad av "traditionalism". Och med det ordet menar jag inte dans runt midsommarstång, folkmusik och Kalle Anka på julafton, dessa yttringar spelar ingen roll. Bullerby-Sverige är dött, dess ättlingar lät det självmant förfalla.
1317119357642747904 2020-10-16 23:05:00 +0800 <NorseTom> Tänk er en individ som går igenom tuffa perioder, bygger upp sig själv, överkommer svårigheter och lär sig läxor. Tänk sedan om denna individ efter några år helt villigt skulle glömma bort allt det de lärt sig och ge fingret åt den person de var förut.
1317119355856048130 2020-10-16 23:04:59 +0800 <NorseTom> Det är ingen slump att degenereringen av detta land har gått hand i hand med isoleringen från våra förfäder, när ett folk kapas från rötterna mister man inte bara sin identitet och kultur utan även all den visdom som otaliga människoliv har gått åt för att sammanställa.
1317119354480283649 2020-10-16 23:04:59 +0800 <NorseTom> En av de största tragedierna med dagens Sverige är den nonchalanta och respektlösa glömskan. Svensken har glömt. Han har glömt vad det innebär att vara svensk, och vad tidigare svenskar utstod för att ge honom allt han har.

1316713852676042753 2020-10-15 20:13:40 +0800 <NorseTom> @_Nils_Emil_ Det handlar mycket om att hitta ditt sätt att lära dig och ta in information. Lyssna, titta, läsa, göra, det finns många olika och alla kommer inte funka lika bra. Om du har lätt att spacea ut låter det som att du behöver något mer engagerande och hands-on

1314217554710163457 2020-10-08 22:54:16 +0800 <NorseTom> Ett välkommet avbrott bland fågelkvitter och vindens sus när jag sitter på "min" sida floden och tittar upp från mitt anteckningsblock för att se ännu en båt lägga till och lasta av eller på.
1314217551543508995 2020-10-08 22:54:15 +0800 <NorseTom> Det mullrar på andra sidan floden. Den för mig okända industrin, möjligtvis ett stenbrott, som försiggår där borta stack när jag först flyttade hit ut som ogräs i den annars rent idylliska naturen på andra sidan vattnet.  Trots detta har mullret nu blivit familjärt.
1314215390449344515 2020-10-08 22:45:40 +0800 <NorseTom> October.  Coffee, carrot cake, the colours of autumn, and you.  I can't help but scribble down a few words but, as the magpies take to the sky and an ant hurries across my arm towards that sweet treat upon the table, I find the scene quite indescribable.

Paintings of faces unfamiliar hang amidst torn and cracked wallpaper, staring into the shadows as if waiting for someone to come along and revitalize their sorry dwelling.  I don't imagine anyone will, now.

1309992283090169859 2020-09-27 07:04:33 +0800 <NorseTom> @Wkarlsson99 Så du har ingen kapacitet att analysera världen utanför lagbokens ramar och la upp ett tweet med ifrågasättbart budskap för att sedan ha icke-diskussioner med alla som säger emot och hålla en banalt onyanserad position av att "juridisk mening" är det enda som betyder något?

1308847577127956483 2020-09-24 03:15:54 +0800 <NorseTom> Perhaps now all I can ask for is that you remember me fondly, if at all.

1308777343771607040 2020-09-23 22:36:49 +0800 <NorseTom> @PrimateAcolyte My bookshelves are running out of space because of my bibliomania so this is the compromise

1308771181215051777 2020-09-23 22:12:20 +0800 <NorseTom> @sarisome__ Fascinating, in Swedish we just have the same latin-root term "biblioman" for that specific meaning. But we have a pretty little word for someone who reads alot, which is "bokslukare" and it translates to "book-devourer"!
1308770024514035712 2020-09-23 22:07:44 +0800 <NorseTom> @NotEvenRobert I never am my friend, not in these matters

Bursting it open first thing in the morning to greet the day with a cup of coffee in hand, greeting guests from up there when they knock on the door, using it as a landing spot for trained carrier pigeons...

I play it subtle and go along with it, but I also try to ask questions about how we met and who is coming to this wedding. I also look around at the house and animals to see any hints as to what is going on.

Min vän har hittat en ande, i burken av piller hon fick.  Klädd i vit rock sätter den känslorna stopp, den anden syns i hennes blick.

Även ditt ansikte går ibland att urskönja i molnens svepande former.  Men hur behagligt solnedgångens ljus än är om sommaren, fruktar jag att värmen av din famn gått evigt förlorad för mitt sinne.

1304821521068810241 2020-09-13 00:37:47 +0800 <NorseTom> Writing poetry is slightly different in English compared to Swedish, but I wouldn't say there's a difference in difficulty for me. Writing humorous prose however is much easier for me in Swedish, I don't know if it's from a difference in culture or lack of reading on my part.

1304724746215583744 2020-09-12 18:13:14 +0800 <NorseTom> His floral shirt blending in with the colourful garden, her straw hat letting the sun's glow form patterns on her smiling face, their hands locked and their laughter lively.
1304724744932122625 2020-09-12 18:13:14 +0800 <NorseTom> The botanical gardens were beautiful that early summer day as I sat on one of the benches with just my notebook and a pen. After a while of slightly uninspired writing, a young couple that looked like they were made for each other passed me and I was somewhat enchanted.

1304437744404496388 2020-09-11 23:12:48 +0800 <NorseTom> @omgheispro Exakt, jag tror studierna kommer vara värt det i alla fall. Som sagt är det som att man stänger av den delen som sitter och lider av galenskapen, för dess egen skull.
1304436462520279040 2020-09-11 23:07:42 +0800 <NorseTom> @FroegVol4 Am now thanks to you!
1304435748683292673 2020-09-11 23:04:52 +0800 <NorseTom> @FroegVol4 Banger
1304434190071496704 2020-09-11 22:58:40 +0800 <NorseTom> @omgheispro Sorgligt att säga men man anpassar sig för att vänja sig vid det. De åren jag har bott här i Stockholm är det som att en del av min själ fått försätta sig i koma för att klara av det, och jag vet ärligt talat inte om den kommer kunna komma tillbaka fullt sen
1304427331029815298 2020-09-11 22:31:25 +0800 <NorseTom> @omgheispro Starka känslor som hat kan ge bränsle till bra tagningar och fint skriveri, men det är viktigt att låta glädje och kärlek göra detsamma ;^)
1304410667705929728 2020-09-11 21:25:12 +0800 <NorseTom> @finmorkar Ooh doom hade nog funkat väldigt bra faktiskt, med ett gungande riff som driver på
1304408013198024704 2020-09-11 21:14:39 +0800 <NorseTom> @Talabot4 Very wise as always! I do want to share some literary beauty with my international friends every now and then though ;^)
1304405749167198209 2020-09-11 21:05:39 +0800 <NorseTom> @katpinetree @J_Ladarc Definitely would hang on my door :^)
1304403130533240833 2020-09-11 20:55:15 +0800 <NorseTom> @AustraliaFair_ Some texts get better treatment from the auto translate than others I've noticed ;^)
1304402733236203522 2020-09-11 20:53:40 +0800 <NorseTom> Bear with me, I will post more in english I just love my native tongue a lot
1304402122381950976 2020-09-11 20:51:15 +0800 <NorseTom> Allt för att hålla maskineriet igång. Tillväxt kräver arbetskraft kräver levnadsstandard kräver tillväxt, och så fortsätter det tills ängarna blomstrat för sista gången och grävs upp för att ersättas av oändliga asfaltsstäpper med digitalt skött timparkering.
1304402120985243653 2020-09-11 20:51:14 +0800 <NorseTom> Moder Sveas sargade djur och natur får utan pardon ge vika för den cancersvulst i betong som är storstaden, miljontals själar släcks för att ge plats åt köpcenter och deras konsumenter, kontor och deras drönare, bostadshyllor och deras insektssinnade invånare.
1304402119890481153 2020-09-11 20:51:14 +0800 <NorseTom> "Urbanisering"  Ett så sterilt och intetsägande ord för att beskriva ett högst dramatiskt och våldsamt fenomen.

1304361624254455808 2020-09-11 18:10:19 +0800 <NorseTom> Mormor förklarade då i den sedvanligt harmoniska och något cigarettröksslitna berättarrösten att vissa människor skulle bespruta sin trädgård och ta kål på lössen, men om man bara har tålamod så kommer snart nyckelpigorna och äter upp dem.
1304361622350241792 2020-09-11 18:10:19 +0800 <NorseTom> men visdomen och nyfikenheten för världen omkring oss stannade hos mig och finns kvar än idag. Ett för mig väldigt kärt minne är när vi två satt på huk intill en av hennes trädgårdsodlingar och inspekterade plantorna. En av dem, jag glömmer vilken, var helt täckt av bladlöss.
1304361620290834432 2020-09-11 18:10:18 +0800 <NorseTom> Min mormor var en sådan kvinna som njöt av att ta med mig och min syster ut i naturen och berätta om flora och fauna. Namnen hon gav var inte alltid de officiellt erkända och faktan pendlade mellan vetenskap och skrock,
1304359016185966592 2020-09-11 17:59:57 +0800 <NorseTom> @Son_ofAlbion It's that easy

1304037460364734468 2020-09-10 20:42:13 +0800 <NorseTom> The trees are discarding their colourful garbs in preparation of their winter slumber. Their gifts; both physical beauty for us to pick up and philosophical lessons of change for us to ponder. Very generous!  https://t.co/qrtCUXqqNp

1300738212336406528 2020-09-01 18:12:11 +0800 <NorseTom> @Deinellpilled @MonkeKio There is a difference between the "true definition" of a word and the commonly accepted understanding of a word for the purpose of trying to convey a thought in a tweet.
1300735567202865152 2020-09-01 18:01:40 +0800 <NorseTom> @Deinellpilled @MonkeKio You assume I haven't ;^)
1300730789882212352 2020-09-01 17:42:41 +0800 <NorseTom> @Deinellpilled @MonkeKio Slightly frustrating to be honest... I can't say much using the word X without defining what I mean by X, which repeats eternally.
1300728984242728961 2020-09-01 17:35:30 +0800 <NorseTom> @Deinellpilled @MonkeKio There's definitely a limitation in trying to put things concisely, and words never mean just the one thing! Entire books can be written about this I'm sure.
1300726798515404800 2020-09-01 17:26:49 +0800 <NorseTom> @ZeoppDieBoer fuckin ripped bro
1300723643534782464 2020-09-01 17:14:17 +0800 <NorseTom> The revolutionary tries to change the system. The philosopher deconstructs the system. The hermit or vagabond disconnects themselves from the system.  All three are necessary for change, all three can exist in you to some degree.
