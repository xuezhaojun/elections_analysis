1344060268968603651 2020-12-30 07:18:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You’re the failure. You should have had a National plan to get the vaccine to the citizens. You’re too busy golfing to care. Are you going to give it to the highest bidder for campaign money?  Wink wink.
1343764879098998785 2020-12-29 11:44:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset Aw so sweet. ❤️
1343722585297711104 2020-12-29 08:56:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GeorgePapa19 We all know what category you fit in and it’s not patriot.
1343714160593559552 2020-12-29 08:23:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @McJesse My daughter and SIL had been fostering two brothers aged 3 and 6 for 1 1/2 years and adopted them on National Adoption Day in November. I became a grandma for 10th time. Their other 3 kids are in college so they are starting over. So proud of them. ❤️
1343674004738088963 2020-12-29 05:43:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Oh STOP. You don’t have to be in church to worship. A building doesn’t make God love you more. It’s how you live your life.
1343646006068588545 2020-12-29 03:52:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NikkiHaley Bless your heart. 😂😂
1343642723572658177 2020-12-29 03:39:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kaitlancollins @petermorrisCNN Is this the meeting he was talking about?
1343299651756322816 2020-12-28 04:56:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @natsechobbyist Those golf course meetings must be very important. 😡
1343273980531253248 2020-12-28 03:14:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WahcaMia @marcorubio I suppose. Politics is all show biz now. Except there are real life consequences for their bad acting.
1343271377781063681 2020-12-28 03:03:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WahcaMia @marcorubio I think about his four children. He used to be someone they could be proud of. I wonder what they think now.
1343008167383474177 2020-12-27 09:37:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You what the best thing to do when someone has a temper tantrum and stomps their feet and their face is beet red and their veins are bulging?  . . .
1342833384003923969 2020-12-26 22:03:22 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol Please don’t complain about the Senate Republicans, Justice Department and Supreme Court. Oh and the Durham Report. That would be a bridge too far. 😂
1342617778013040641 2020-12-26 07:46:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @AblueUs Hey folks, here’s the deal. This tweet is a bunch of malarkey.
1342527136196927489 2020-12-26 01:46:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KFILE Sending prayers and hugs your way. So sorry. ❤️🙏
1342498144676933633 2020-12-25 23:51:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @sawsharee Merry Christmas Sawsharee. Hope you have a wonderful day.
1342474005723426821 2020-12-25 22:15:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ced003 @COmama74 ❤️
1342324319943348224 2020-12-25 12:20:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump His meetings consist of himself on Twitter, sulking and raging at imaginary foes. This sad pathetic man will spend the rest of his life alone with his phone because he can’t acknowledge that he lost.
1342311126000951298 2020-12-25 11:28:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mattklewis Eating Tide Pods will not help. The stain set in and won’t come out.
1342152412426096641 2020-12-25 00:57:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @renato_mariotti Exactly. If he was really concerned, he wouldn’t be golfing today. He wouldn’t have left Washington.
1342129963353468929 2020-12-24 23:28:13 +0800 <CherylHeide> @nedglover100 @LeadingNFL Mine too.
1342129491070636032 2020-12-24 23:26:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JohnJHarwood Beautiful Christmas pie. 🎄
1342097613034823683 2020-12-24 21:19:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @waltshaub Our Country suffered greatly because of the Donald Trump experiment. Never again.
1342078827581878272 2020-12-24 20:05:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @stephenfhayes Trump wants an airport named after him. I’m sure there’s a worthy swamp in Florida that would be more appropriate.
1341964992783003649 2020-12-24 12:32:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @frequentbuyer1 @NikkiHaley She’s probably hiding under a rock because there’s no defending this.
1341961899605450755 2020-12-24 12:20:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Bet you wanted a pardon too.
1341889055525638150 2020-12-24 07:30:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump The only fraud that has been found was committed by your supporters. Is that who you’re investigating?
1341888296524328960 2020-12-24 07:27:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maggieNYT Glad I no longer listen to conservative radio. Especially in Wisconsin. They’ve gone cuckoo for Trump.
1341860359301439494 2020-12-24 05:36:54 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Because Trump is soooo empathetic to others. 😂😂😂Treats people with respect and kindness. 😂😂😂 Would give you the shirt off his back. 😂😂😂😂 You’re delusional to think we don’t see the games you play. You use Trump like he uses you. A mutual user society.😡
1341844359868805121 2020-12-24 04:33:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol He wasn’t alarmed by the Mueller Report or sending the military against citizens during the protests, so is this a 5 alarm fire?
1341815922626088961 2020-12-24 02:40:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @clive22 😄❤️
1341800590511394817 2020-12-24 01:39:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset Hope you feel better soon Karen.
1341389386450153474 2020-12-22 22:25:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol Hypocrite
1341222448793083906 2020-12-22 11:22:05 +0800 <CherylHeide> @sarahchblum @kyledcheney @mkraju I was thinking the same thing. No one should be shooting a dog. 😡  https://t.co/tDiXIunfcQ
1341221343522516993 2020-12-22 11:17:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol @SykesCharlie Trump is Jabba the Hutt. Don’t know if he was in the cantina though. 😄
1341172476345266178 2020-12-22 08:03:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump There, there Donald. Why don’t you go to Mar-a-Lago and clear your mind. Relax. A mind is a terrible thing to lose. Think about it.
1341171072293613569 2020-12-22 07:57:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @michaelpfreeman Trump’s mad because Hagedorn sided with the Liberals in these crackpot cases Trump brought. The other three Conservatives sided with the crackpots.
1341128871366840320 2020-12-22 05:10:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @justinamash The same amount that would have been dedicated to a $1200 check?
1340870318559293445 2020-12-21 12:02:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jaketapper Eating alone and thinking about work sounds legit. You could have 6, 9 even 12 martinis. 🤷‍♀️
1340860918800986114 2020-12-21 11:25:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan We are free as of now. But Trump and the likes of you are trying to change it. Don’t try to change the subject from you. We see right through you.
1340858441850601474 2020-12-21 11:15:39 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KyleLovesYall Looks delicious. Yum.
1340788681418956800 2020-12-21 06:38:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump You all mocked the virus but first in line for vaccine. Not a good look. But then again, the GOP hasn’t looked good for 4 years.
1340696647333011457 2020-12-21 00:32:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ChrissieKeffler @clive22 My mom made them too. That’s why I make them now. ❤️
1340516105656422404 2020-12-20 12:35:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Thought this was going to be a blowout. Then came the 2nd half. Yikes!  😫
1340489834725593089 2020-12-20 10:50:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WiscoHeroics1 Pretty good. 😄🏈
1340486896074551296 2020-12-20 10:39:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KlotzBets No you’re not. You’re doing the right thing.
1340486004193550336 2020-12-20 10:35:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @clive22 I make the peanut butter ones. Never saw with chocolate cookie. Looks yummy.
1340455987086565376 2020-12-20 08:36:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyMcKew Oh well. It’s just Trump being Trump. That’s what the GOP thinks. We knew these last days would be bad. But this is out of control. Ued to think surely someone would come to our rescue. That time never came. I don’t think it will now either. The GOP is too afraid to save America
1340444971434950656 2020-12-20 07:52:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @iovine_carole Me too.
1340141711826235393 2020-12-19 11:47:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @waltshaub Many downplayed the virus or at least were silent about it. If only they’d taken it seriously we might not be in this situation. Why should we have suffer because of their ineptitude? Seems all that matters to them is giving their rich buddies tax breaks. Had enough of their BS!
1340132246091608065 2020-12-19 11:10:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @NicolleDWallace I didn’t see Nicolle but saw it on CNN earlier today. So awful. There are still some there who have Covid. Hopefully they will be ok. 🙏😢
1340085364480823296 2020-12-19 08:03:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln @marcorubio Sanctimonious Rubio and his Bible verses when he tries to be mini Trump is a lot worse than the F bomb.
1340069538080174081 2020-12-19 07:00:49 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NeuSummits @SykesCharlie I will.🙋‍♀️
1340061654843834369 2020-12-19 06:29:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @gtconway3d Yes weakness because he’d probably flinch and cry like a baby.
1339928924722237441 2020-12-18 21:42:04 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ThePlumLineGS Just a sad bitter man.  He will stay in his bunker the rest of his term and indulge in self pity. The rest of us be damned.
1339924336778461185 2020-12-18 21:23:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @clarissaward Thank you for your amazing reporting. We appreciate all you have done.
1339923852814671873 2020-12-18 21:21:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 He’s sulking. Feeling sorry for himself. Couldn’t care less about us.  He’s a loser who can’t face reality. It’s always been about him.
1339785390987874308 2020-12-18 12:11:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You just don’t like that they did the right thing. You only like people who lie and cheat for you. We are disappointed you haven’t stepped up and helped on the fight against Covid. And how about the cyber attack from your buddy Putin. What are you going to do about that?
1339782508515368963 2020-12-18 12:00:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @MysterySolvent Eggnog and spiced rum is my preference. 😄
1339781905127006209 2020-12-18 11:57:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KyleLovesYall And one has to wave in a dignified way.
1339781449155833861 2020-12-18 11:56:04 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom 🤦‍♀️
1339771019603681282 2020-12-18 11:14:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @HeathMayo Ted is too afraid to blame Trump. He might get a mean tweet. It would hurt his feelings. 😂
1339690782350073857 2020-12-18 05:55:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Timodc Trump abandoned America when we needed him most. He lost the election so he just gave up. He never really cared about us. It’s always about him. He deserves everything that is about to happen to him once he officially leaves office. Just remember he never cared.
1339426773898043392 2020-12-17 12:26:42 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln @marcorubio Little in mind, body and soul. One thing we can thank Trump for is exposing nincompoops like Little Marco.
1339414354949791744 2020-12-17 11:37:21 +0800 <CherylHeide> @donwinslow Now we know why he won’t go to Mar-a-Lago this Christmas. He thinks they’ll change the locks.
1339396019826651138 2020-12-17 10:24:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio Please!  What you and Trump have done to this Country is reprehensible and you’re worried about this?  Guess you like to be used by Trump. How does it feel to be thrown away?  In Trump’s party you wouldn’t qualify for 2nd banana.
1339375061040582656 2020-12-17 09:01:13 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @Greek_Deme @jreganwilliams @PamelaApostolo1 @cjensen_MT @nixw20 @JIMDesigns @bluewaverider46 @kelbelle10 @johnfeal2 @Eiggam5955 Thanks Tammy. Love you too. ❤️
1339357231557570565 2020-12-17 07:50:22 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ced003 @GOPAmericanMom Oh my gosh. Didn’t realize she’s been away so long. Hope all ok. 😞
1339300115324997633 2020-12-17 04:03:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KlasfeldReports The GOP has said this for years. Bus loads of people from other states, dead people and machines changing candidates. Nothing new, just amplified it this year.
1339297867710803972 2020-12-17 03:54:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JRubinBlogger @LianaRussell68 @SenRonJohnson It will be my pleasure to vote him out. What an embarrassment for my state.
1338694809666596870 2020-12-15 11:58:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @reginaldedward3 Lindsey tried to say it in a fancy way thinking no one would get it. 😂
1338687754792787969 2020-12-15 11:30:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @jessieopie Unfortunately that’s true. ☹️
1338687319113691137 2020-12-15 11:28:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @jessieopie What’s up with that?
1338628943067443200 2020-12-15 07:36:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maggieNYT We can read him like a book. He thinks the subject will be changed with Barr’s resignation. But actually a lot of us just ignore him because he just repeats the same thing over and over. He’s so boring. Just because he’s making a fool of himself doesn’t mean we have to play along
1338608583680925696 2020-12-15 06:15:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RepPaulMitchell Thank you. 🇺🇸

1338459105963495425 2020-12-14 20:21:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Melissa89431446 So awful. 😢
1338327393572950020 2020-12-14 11:38:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom He’s gotta keep those dollars coming to get himself out of debt. He’ll keep the gravy train going until January 20th and beyond.
1338325512222089218 2020-12-14 11:30:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump The only thing bad for our Country is you. You put yourself above all others. You lie to your supporters to make millions of dollars for yourself. I wish they knew how much you mock them. Shameful!
1338303156015558660 2020-12-14 10:01:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump The most fraud is coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington D.C. in the Oval Office and your residence in the White House. You are the fraud.
1338258860168056833 2020-12-14 07:05:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 So disgusting! To them the virus is a joke &amp; mocked those that took precautions to protect others. They had maskless Christmas parties while most of us don’t get to spend Christmas with our families. Yet they get rewarded. Think of all the healthcare workers who can’t get it now!
1338197324456189952 2020-12-14 03:01:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @newtgingrich Evidently you think only Republicans should vote. The GOP used to be more subtle in their voter suppression.
1337945115185311744 2020-12-13 10:19:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @atrupar It was hard to hit the like button. A little to close for comfort, if you know what I mean. 😁
1337940462137708546 2020-12-13 10:00:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Awesome. 😄🏈

1337822260682502146 2020-12-13 02:10:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 Awesome job. Cool remembrance of our 2020 Christmas.
1337796096412803073 2020-12-13 00:26:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @atrupar 🤦‍♀️
1337644302428729344 2020-12-12 14:23:48 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump They told the truth. You just don’t like people that tell the truth. You lie so much it’s hard for you tell fact from fiction. Your whole life has been a lie. We are so tired. Tired of all the lies and deceit. Just leave us alone now.
1337617714312081410 2020-12-12 12:38:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @meggyc50 @peabodypress Mine just stares at me til she gets her way.
1337617237344210949 2020-12-12 12:36:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SteveSchmidtSES Perfect. Hope you have something similar planned for Ron Johnson. He’s also up in 2022.
1337614118702907393 2020-12-12 12:23:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RepWesterman You owe my state, Wisconsin, &amp; it’s citizens an apology. There was nothing wrong with our electoral process. You said what we did was against the Constitution. It was the other way around. You fought the Rule of Law, but the law won. Now you try to say, never mind. Can’t forget.
1337253783848579073 2020-12-11 12:32:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom There’s more on next tweet.
1337250538975617025 2020-12-11 12:19:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom
1337250108967178240 2020-12-11 12:17:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Well maybe the thought about it. 🇺🇸
1337243270427140097 2020-12-11 11:50:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom He is Republican, Bryan Steil. But his name wasn’t one of the 106 that I saw. Unless something changed. I thought Tiffany was the only one from Wisconsin that signed.
1337240327883808772 2020-12-11 11:38:33 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Oh my. How awful. 😢
1337223482845827072 2020-12-11 10:31:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WalshFreedom Hannity couldn’t care less who won. He makes stuff up no matter who is in office. A hack’s gotta hack.
1337219126813745154 2020-12-11 10:14:18 +0800 <CherylHeide> @michaelpfreeman Not me.
1337165666433052672 2020-12-11 06:41:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyBeck So he wants to disenfranchise his fellow Wisconsinites all for a man who only cares about himself. Trump is making a ton of money by scamming his followers. Maybe Tiffany is getting a cut.
1336881907959803904 2020-12-10 11:54:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Lermont @BrianFrosh As a Wisconsinite it troubles me that you as an American want to take my vote away. Especially for some Trumped up charges with no bearing on the truth. How would you like it if it happened to you? Would you agree with it? You’re being lied to. Wake up.
1336873203956928516 2020-12-10 11:19:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WalshFreedom They only care about Trump now. They’ll try to go back to old ways, but I for one will never believe or trust them again. When their Country needed them they deserted us. They failed the test.
1336871403044429824 2020-12-10 11:12:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WahcaMia @EvanMcMullin Looks marvelous.
1336843931611521027 2020-12-10 09:23:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenatorLankford @realDonaldTrump You and the GOP have lost your ever-living minds. Guess this is who you were all along. Trump just made you say the quiet part out loud. I supported the GOP for many years. Guess you don’t want people like me anymore. Trump killed the party and there’s no turning back. Too late.
1336799119365595138 2020-12-10 06:25:21 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SykesCharlie Can we voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia sue Texas? Texas is actually trying to steal our votes. Very sad that 17 States joined in this ridiculous suit. I wonder how the states would react if it happened to them.
1336674970659942402 2020-12-09 22:12:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Our victory was when you lost.

1336520403091648513 2020-12-09 11:57:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @atrupar When Ted grows up, he wants to be just like Trump.

1335788376792977409 2020-12-07 11:29:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @shearm @SherylNYT Have they all lost their ever-loving minds?
1335781787310694400 2020-12-07 11:02:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol Trump thinks we are supposed to serve him. Unfortunately for us he is the worst possible president at this time of crisis. His answer is to ignore it like it doesn’t exist.
1335719614039388162 2020-12-07 06:55:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WahcaMia I’ll bet Trump demanded Rudy get the same special treatment he got. 😡
1335718066903199745 2020-12-07 06:49:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Enough states have certified and you have lost. The rest to certify are just icing on the cake. #ByeBye
1335696556637478926 2020-12-07 05:24:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TaraSetmayer Unlike the GOP House and Senate. Thanks 🇺🇸
1335610174208356352 2020-12-06 23:40:54 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 45 days until we are rid of 45. That short-timers chart is looking good. 😄
1335569149121196035 2020-12-06 20:57:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mikehahn_ Yes all those people are going to move the virus to their friends, family and probably themselves.
1335407810809573378 2020-12-06 10:16:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 The oath they took means nothing to them. They would rather wallow in self pity and self loathing than stand up for their country and it’s citizens. They can never be trusted again. That tail between their legs will become burdensome but it will be too late.
1335385605451247619 2020-12-06 08:48:33 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset Pretty. 😄
1335337602011058179 2020-12-06 05:37:48 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol I think you said it best. Subversion.
1335328908707835904 2020-12-06 05:03:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ced003 @RadioFreeTom Trump sure knows how to pick them. 🤦‍♀️
1335309004671754248 2020-12-06 03:44:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @CarolinaGirl585 @RadioFreeTom Oh brother. So sick of this BS.
1335308780226162697 2020-12-06 03:43:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RobertMaguire_ They’ll let him do whatever he wants. I gave up on them because the GOP gave up on America. What’s scary is all the down ballot races they won.
1335301419704987650 2020-12-06 03:14:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom What did she say now?  I’m blocked.
1335296126719815682 2020-12-06 02:52:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ForTheRuleOfLaw Guess they like keeping their supporters from the truth. Guess they are happy with the way the Trump is handling this. They’re probably asking “Why didn’t I think of that”. All these years it could have been a conspiracy here, a conspiracy there. Easy. No brains required.
1335282858626265096 2020-12-06 02:00:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SykesCharlie The more he loses, the more money he makes. He preys on his supporters and laughs and laughs.
1335079549730746368 2020-12-05 12:32:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan These remarks are basically telling your supporters to go have fun and come home and give the virus to innocents. Who cares if they get sick and even die. They had fun damn it. You are saying their lives mean nothing.
1335074261774503936 2020-12-05 12:11:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MickDAmario @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiulianli They used a special decoder pen ordered from Hugo Chavez’s website.
1335056256214642689 2020-12-05 10:59:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Hard to believe what’s going on here. How were these decisions not unanimous?  🤦‍♀️
1335045344577679360 2020-12-05 10:16:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Integrity is not believing Trump, GOP, QAnon, Giuliani or in all these stupid lawsuits. Trying to overturn the Rule of Law is not Ok.
1335022320906358785 2020-12-05 08:44:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @amandacarpenter I just don’t get it. The cult is real.
1335021123864588290 2020-12-05 08:40:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyBeck @patrickdmarley It should have been unanimous. Unbelievable.
1334934795734880262 2020-12-05 02:57:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Yes that’s what you are trying to do. It won’t work. Safest election on record. Your AG said no election fraud found.
1334857711297638400 2020-12-04 21:50:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Give it up Donald. The party is over. Time to call it a day.
1334552116506075136 2020-12-04 01:36:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @CapehartJ Congrats. 🎉🎈
1334347503945338880 2020-12-03 12:03:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Goss30Goss So sorry. 😢❤️
1334295867860332546 2020-12-03 08:38:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JonahDispatch @bbmbsit Yup. Trump killed the GOP and the so called GOP leaders put the nails in the coffin. They gambled and lost. They have no one to blame but themselves. What goes around, comes around.
1334249946153963521 2020-12-03 05:35:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @KyleLovesYall That’s awesome Kyle.
1334133193012879360 2020-12-02 21:51:54 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRickWilson @BulwarkOnline This is the now extinct Republican Party, irrational, irresponsible and devoid of character or free thought.
1333984709307756544 2020-12-02 12:01:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @davidmweissman @DemNevada @tedcruz He is so disgusting. He and Ron Johnson are trying to one up each other. They will both lose and it will be glorious.
1333982269019709449 2020-12-02 11:52:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump We’ve gotten so used to your lies that we just know the opposite of what you say is true. You’re in TROUBLE!!!!
1333959214759370752 2020-12-02 10:20:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NikkiHaley At least she didn’t work for Trump like you did.
1333945737508499459 2020-12-02 09:27:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JoyceWhiteVance Interesting. I thought they did nothing wrong. Why is a pardon needed?
1333913158495375364 2020-12-02 07:17:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @reedgalen @ProjectLincoln Yes please. This Wisconsinite has had enough.
1333774549742137346 2020-12-01 22:06:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Yes the USA won but you lost.
1333772951666241537 2020-12-01 22:00:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset No problems for me. Sorry it didn’t go well for you.

1333218855448096769 2020-11-30 09:18:39 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes I’ll listen to the expert. You fired him because he told the truth and that didn’t fit your narrative.
1333189900741570561 2020-11-30 07:23:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JennaEllisEsq No. Those that love America don’t lie to its citizens and try to profit off those lies.
1333075848493199363 2020-11-29 23:50:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 Could be more. Dane County reports numbers this morning.
1332886068400709632 2020-11-29 11:16:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JoshShapiroPA Trump thought “his” judges would roll over and play dead. Evidently no one ever told him no.
1332865331061264386 2020-11-29 09:53:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRickWilson He’s got Diamond and Silk on Newsmax shuffling papers showing supposed voter fraud. Maybe Trump’s judgement is a little off.  He thinks he’s a stable genius. 🤷‍♀️

1332838903150239745 2020-11-29 08:08:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @frequentbuyer1 We cannot trust them again. They will turn on a dime when the next Trump comes along.
1332792601708294145 2020-11-29 05:04:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump No you haven’t. Why aren’t you challenging early voting ballots in predominantly Republican counties?  They should be illegal too by your calculation.

1332683497161580546 2020-11-28 21:51:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @EricTrump I think we should investigate your dad’s votes. That’s what’s really suspicious. No way he got that many votes. Any fraud that was found was committed by Republicans.
1332512832890482692 2020-11-28 10:33:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @AdamParkhomenko Still waiting for Dane County. They should finish tomorrow. The recount was for Dane and Milwaukee County.

1330505758048444422 2020-11-22 21:37:46 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MattfromKC Aaron Rodgers. I’m a Packers fan so it’s fun for me.
1330349514272673794 2020-11-22 11:16:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JeffreyGuterman I’ll never forget those days in November 1963. I was a sophomore in high school. A sadness that stays with you forever. 😢

1330267383462850562 2020-11-22 05:50:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @nytimes This shouldn’t be hard. Duty to the Country, it’s Construction and it’s citizens is the only choice they should make.

1329278109326184449 2020-11-19 12:19:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NancyAFrench Interesting. A lot different than See Spot run, which was my first reading experience. 😃

1329202005370396672 2020-11-19 07:17:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @LindseyGrahamSC The only one who has failed miserably is you. I guess your John McCain days were just you pretending to be ethical.
1329194241466261507 2020-11-19 06:46:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRealHoarse I love the homemade sauce but the family likes the canned. Guess who never gets homemade sauce. ☹️
1329165280073945089 2020-11-19 04:51:12 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NikkiHaley @standamericanow Trump and the GOP have trampled on the Rule of Law. I’d say that is extremely radical.
1329157792423415817 2020-11-19 04:21:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @CapehartJ Happy Birthday to your mom. Hope she has a wonderful day. Beautiful pictures. 🎂🎈🎉
1329040189289885696 2020-11-18 20:34:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol Lindsey Graham is a chameleon. Wonder what color he’ll adopt now.
1328913709754949633 2020-11-18 12:11:33 +0800 <CherylHeide> @HeathMayo I’ll never understand how he beat out all those other candidates. Watching all the debates and Trump was still standing after every one. It was surreal.
1328910887550382083 2020-11-18 12:00:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @clive22 @Lcmwriter100 Awesome. Now breathe.

1328907731101757440 2020-11-18 11:47:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WalshFreedom And when a reporter asks a GOP member of Congress a question, they get all defensive like they are the ones being wronged.
1328905756800901121 2020-11-18 11:39:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @gtconway3d I wish the fleet would sail away.

1328894014473560065 2020-11-18 10:53:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NumbersMuncher For the first time in his life, Trump has been told NO and he can’t handle it.

1328890421897023492 2020-11-18 10:39:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> Dear @Twitter What is going to happen to the sports teams I follow that used to be displayed?  When games were on I could  access the tweets easily. I want it back. You can delete the junk on top of my Twitter feed now. Thanks.
1328854332784189440 2020-11-18 08:15:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Why don’t you just retire to Mar-a-Lago. We would all be better off.

1327100996582039552 2020-11-13 12:08:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TexHellCat Wisconsin is bad too. The GOP legislature stops everything the governor tries to do and Wisconsin Supreme Court aids them. It’s basically every man for himself.

1325578701732507653 2020-11-09 07:19:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @madrid_mike I thank you. You let us be a part of it. You made me laugh, made me cry and made me proud to be an American. 🇺🇸
1325518683813400578 2020-11-09 03:20:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump That’s how you were declared. Maybe we should take your presidency back.
1325496534553812997 2020-11-09 01:52:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Schneider_CM Sigh
1325492722225057794 2020-11-09 01:37:46 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 I know. I thought he was better.

1325284292839280640 2020-11-08 11:49:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Timodc To think he gave it all up for Trump. It boggles my mind.

1325161935118200833 2020-11-08 03:43:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @LibertyBritt Did this morning. 🇺🇸

1325120858126381057 2020-11-08 01:00:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jwgop So glad to hear from you. Thanks for your hard work. 🇺🇸
1325114509271379968 2020-11-08 00:34:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ddale8 Your job just got a lot easier.
1325112331026706432 2020-11-08 00:26:13 +0800 <CherylHeide> President-elect Joe Biden 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1325080697325965312 2020-11-07 22:20:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol I know in Wisconsin many voted for their Republican representatives but not Trump.
1324924134661517316 2020-11-07 11:58:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @AVindman They’re not as brave as you were.
1324923781798907905 2020-11-07 11:57:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RepJohnRose @TheJusticeDept Show us the fraud. Barr will make things up just like he did with the Mueller Report. Show the fraud in your election too. I bet you weren’t really elected. 🤷‍♀️
1324916760299114502 2020-11-07 11:29:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kohoutba @MagmaMauler @Lincoln_Party_ Oh no. We sure can’t let that happen.
1324913237297672193 2020-11-07 11:15:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MagmaMauler @Lincoln_Party_ Hopefully he doesn’t run.
1324910856984014849 2020-11-07 11:05:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit Because the GOP wouldn’t allow some states to count their mail in ballots early. So in some states you were ahead because of in-person voting. You didn’t want your supporters to vote by mail so those ballots are mainly Democratic. More Dems voted than R’s. Understand?
1324875082221707265 2020-11-07 08:43:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @CharlesBenson4 Elections have consequences.

1324768934818701313 2020-11-07 01:41:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump So now you want mail-in ballots counted?
1324766350871535617 2020-11-07 01:31:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DonaldJTrumpJr @MAGAWiscoMAMA Yes. That’s how much we wanted to get rid of you and your dad.
1324764631018180611 2020-11-07 01:24:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump We have counted and you’re losing. Do you know how foolish you look?  For once man up!
1324763957740085249 2020-11-07 01:21:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPLeader There is no battle. Quit trying to stir up your base. Leaders lead and tell the truth no matter how painful. If you want respect, that’s how you get it.

1324697140988444673 2020-11-06 20:56:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DonaldJTrumpJr Prove it. We want receipts.

1324548424285433857 2020-11-06 11:05:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump You are despicable.
1324547585487605766 2020-11-06 11:02:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @stuartpstevens Yup. That’s what hurts Stuart. I used to think they were the good guys. I feel saddened, but mostly betrayed.
1324526038794280960 2020-11-06 09:36:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom Yup. Aaron, Aaron and Davante. #GoPackGo
1324519766242004998 2020-11-06 09:11:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @gtconway3d That is what this is all about. Jail. He couldn’t care less about America, the presidency, his staff, his family but most of all his supporters. Once he leaves office, he’s toast. For America it can’t come soon enough.
1324506612405571584 2020-11-06 08:19:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @EvanMcMullin They should, but won’t.
1324506058669391877 2020-11-06 08:17:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maggieNYT Then those in Congress who refuse to stand up for America don’t deserve our sympathy, only scorn.

1324402476548825090 2020-11-06 01:25:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Because the GOP stopped states from counting ballots early. Just look at yourself in the mirror.
1324377781325697026 2020-11-05 23:47:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @germanrlopez @StephenGutowski Especially since a lot of people didn’t go to the polls. 🤷‍♀️
1324366008434524160 2020-11-05 23:00:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump No. Voting is an unalienable right. You cannot take it away from us. We will not let you stop us. You are not a king. This is the United States of America and here the voters have the final say, not you.

1324186740370886657 2020-11-05 11:08:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom You bet. Milwaukee and Dane County came in big time. Just have to be patient for the few states left to finish counting. Think we’ll be able to sleep well tonight. 😄

1323456163019739141 2020-11-03 10:45:12 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BulwarkOnline @ajcruz14th_aj It hurts when those we love and respected turned to Trump. We thought they had the same values and love of country as we did. That’s why our hearts are heavy. We can only hope they find their way back. 😢

1323445954750668801 2020-11-03 10:04:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @gtconway3d Goodbye 👋 May his name forever be stricken from our memory and his 1776 Commission.

1323262559554834434 2020-11-02 21:55:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio Stop you hypocrite. You could’ve been a contender but you’ve bent to the altar of Trump. Stop with the Bible verses. You don’t follow them.
1323260652782321664 2020-11-02 21:48:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @michaelpfreeman In the beginning of Trump’s presidency, I used to feel sorry for those in Congress trying to navigate under Trump. Now they are Trump. What a disgrace. 😡

By not coming forward in a situation like this, they are essentially giving their approval. I have given up waiting for someone to save us.
1323033114168512512 2020-11-02 06:44:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You’re the candidate of Putin, Erdogan, Xi, Salman, Un and every other thug you owe money to.
1323023153581465604 2020-11-02 06:04:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JasonMillerinDC Why does Trump lie every time he opens his mouth? Why does Trump incite violence? Why is Trump corrupt? Why does Trump downplay the virus and get people killed? Why does Trump have a bank account in China? Why does Trump cheat on his wives and pay porn stars to cover it up? WHY?

1322949589666848769 2020-11-02 01:12:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jaketapper It’s so infuriating. They managed to stop states from counting ballots before Election Day, then complain when all votes aren’t counted on Election Day. They will try every trick to win, but we will have the final say. It ain’t over til it’s over.

1321262807862706176 2020-10-28 09:29:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump You would. You don’t care either that people get sick. Some even die. Despicable.
1321246547217162241 2020-10-28 08:24:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Wisconsin will make sure you lose. We don’t like liars. Especially a whiny liar.
1321219304348618752 2020-10-28 06:36:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WISN12News Shhh!  Don’t let the US Supreme Court know.

1321173695092695041 2020-10-28 03:35:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @stuartpstevens Today Wisconsin has a record 5,200 cases and 64 deaths. Horrible numbers. So guess where Trump is coming today?  Cases have spiked after his rallies and he couldn’t care less. I’m livid. 😡
1321163155641348096 2020-10-28 02:53:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyBeck Oh my. 😢
1321137542759129092 2020-10-28 01:11:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @IvankaTrump You are so irresponsible. What in the heck is the matter with you?
1321128243630641152 2020-10-28 00:34:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Thanks for all your hard work.
1321120333706022913 2020-10-28 00:03:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump They don’t believe in giving Covid to their supporters like you do. Do you know after your rally in Mosinee Wisconsin cases in the county went up 67%? Also several people died. Does that make you proud?
1321065349941465088 2020-10-27 20:24:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JoyceWhiteVance I dropped mine off. Praying others will do the same.
1321056785646735362 2020-10-27 19:50:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump For a few days we will be talking about your historic loss but after that it will be COVID again because you failed us and people died.
1321054850319290368 2020-10-27 19:43:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You’re delusional. Ain’t going to happen.

1320914027242004480 2020-10-27 10:23:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MBGlenn I agree. I never thought I would say that either.

1320908458842087426 2020-10-27 10:01:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @amvetsupport I dropped mine off and it has been received. 🇺🇸
1320907408336736257 2020-10-27 09:57:22 +0800 <CherylHeide> @therecount Trump picked her to help decide any election discrepancies and she accepted. That’s all we have to know. Her only saving grace would be to recuse if any cases came before the SC.
1320835707221495809 2020-10-27 05:12:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @amandacarpenter 👍

1320818848107581442 2020-10-27 04:05:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JasonMillerinDC No one cares.

1320797221475016706 2020-10-27 02:39:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @madrid_mike Some one should tell Trump that he and his GOP enablers are the real RINOs.
1320784146806034433 2020-10-27 01:47:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @COConstitution1 Wow. Not fun. 😯
1320756368903733248 2020-10-26 23:57:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump A real president would care that our hospitals are over-flowing. We are breaking records every day because you surrendered to the pandemic. It’s no one’s fault but your own.
1320754556385529856 2020-10-26 23:49:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @PressSec @60Minutes @realDonaldTrump No sane person believes you.
1320724356490809344 2020-10-26 21:49:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol He could have been a hero, but once again he made a disastrous error in judgment.
1320711455755456512 2020-10-26 20:58:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You surrendered to the Pandemic. You left us to fend for ourselves with no guidance. You are not a leader. You quit when it got hard because you didn’t want to deal with it. Real presidents wouldn’t do that. Shameful.
1320562391025930240 2020-10-26 11:06:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Fahrenthold 🏳️ They surrendered.
1320561583920132099 2020-10-26 11:03:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @justinamash It’s going to take a long time for me to forgive the GOP and I’m old. We sent them to Washington to work for us. Instead they worked for Trump the man, not Trump the president. Guess I was naive. No more.
1320559526035230726 2020-10-26 10:55:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ScottWalker @KamalaHarris @BernieSanders Quit embarrassing yourself.
1320552462135234561 2020-10-26 10:26:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Atticus59914029 He showed what an awful person he was during debates in 2016. His rallies after he won nomination. The Russian rumors. Access Hollywood. Everything.
1320547931318063105 2020-10-26 10:08:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @vanitaguptaCR @smartdissent This person has no business being president. He doesn’t like being called out on his lies. He got away with it too long.
1320546607897714688 2020-10-26 10:03:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mindyfinn I’m so sorry. It’s so hard for everyone to be isolated from loved ones. Praying for you and your grandma.
1320498899895914498 2020-10-26 06:54:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump He also thinks he’s handsome, is 6’3” and weighs 239.
1320496731411435521 2020-10-26 06:45:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset How about the Covid policy that wasn’t? Trump surrendered. He quit.
1320495612383645698 2020-10-26 06:41:02 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump You set a terrible example. You should be quarantined. Guess that’s just for the little people who play by the rules. I pray for the people you will infect because they had no choice if they want to keep their jobs. Shame on you.
1320460557871439874 2020-10-26 04:21:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol Very powerful.

1320163573096718341 2020-10-25 08:41:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom They did it!

1320125911694442496 2020-10-25 06:11:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TammyHuskyMom @MollyMcKew Probably was. Everything is fake about that man. Including calling him a man.

1320101412630597638 2020-10-25 04:34:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump He doesn’t want to kill people with super-spreader rallies. He cares about us, unlike you who only cares about himself.

1319837830311518208 2020-10-24 11:07:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> Just saw a Biden ad during Badger game. Broke my heart. Wisconsin dairy farmer telling his story. Farm in family over 100 years. Wanted to pass it on to daughter but Trump’s policies forced him to give up the dairy business. Real people are hurting. Powerful ad in Wisconsin. 😢

1319828980447481859 2020-10-24 10:32:04 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln See that red blob that is Wisconsin?  Trump is coming here tomorrow and Tuesday. Why can’t his supporters see he doesn’t care about them?
1319816188403372033 2020-10-24 09:41:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JohnWDean He doesn’t want a plan because it would ruin his narrative. He can never admit he made a monumental mistake. He is a deserter and should be punished. He’s killing innocent by-standers that had nothing to do with his rallies.
1319796962753904640 2020-10-24 08:24:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @amandacarpenter He’s coming to Wisconsin tomorrow and Tuesday. We’ve had over 4,000 cases several times this week. Today 42 deaths. I’m furious. He doesn’t care.
1319781424673771521 2020-10-24 07:23:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRickWilson #ETTD including himself.

1319767360908201990 2020-10-24 06:27:13 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP He only fights for himself. It’s time you tell us the truth.
1319766778306793472 2020-10-24 06:24:54 +0800 <CherylHeide> I did. Now Trump is coming Tuesday to LaCrosse as well as Saturday to Waukesha. 😡
1319766299107561473 2020-10-24 06:23:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SpeakerVos @realDrBirx Now you say this? If you would have done this in the beginning you would have saved a lot of Wisconsinites. But you couldn’t think for yourself and followed Trump who couldn’t care less about us.  Now he’s coming again 2 times to spread some more. Tell him no to show you care.
1319763871142453249 2020-10-24 06:13:21 +0800 <CherylHeide> @eye2winner @JoeBiden Joe has empathy. He cares about us all not just supporters. He doesn’t lie every time he talks. He will lead a sane response to the COVID crisis. That is most important right now. Joe is who America needs and deserves. 🇺🇸

1319109672964657152 2020-10-22 10:53:48 +0800 <CherylHeide> @seanspicer Trump does super-spreader rallies. He’s trying to kill people and it doesn’t bother him a bit. Guess it doesn’t bother you either.
1319100704372436992 2020-10-22 10:18:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You deny the existence of the pandemic and won’t lift a finger to help. People are dying. Many are still losing jobs every week. It’s not going away just because you want it to. You could have been a hero, but you chose to desert.
1319074298947080193 2020-10-22 08:33:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @scoutprime @folkbum I was listening to the Steve Scaffidi Show a couple of weeks ago. Guy from SE WI calls in &amp; said he went to Shawano over the weekend. Went to a restaurant. He was the only one wearing a mask. Guy comes up to him telling him to take it off b/c he was disrespecting our president.
1319048212775342080 2020-10-22 06:49:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @atrupar Happy Birthday. Enjoy the little one.
1319046933911097344 2020-10-22 06:44:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @WahcaMia He’s coming back to Wisconsin this weekend. We’ve had over 4,000 cases the last two days now and 48 deaths yesterday. He couldn’t care less who gets sick. He is a monster.
1319034254492377090 2020-10-22 05:54:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenRonJohnson @JoeBiden You are a scandal to the state of Wisconsin. You are a Trump clone.

1317148276542656515 2020-10-17 00:59:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 The GOP abandoned us when we needed them most. I think most of them feel this way but re-election was more important than our Country &amp; it’s citizens.That’s why many of us ex-GOP’s are now independents. It didn’t have to be this way. Sometimes it is too late to do the right thing
1316930158201372673 2020-10-16 10:33:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JonahDispatch Trump is Eddy Haskell. Joe is Wally Cleaver.

1315791395119079425 2020-10-13 07:08:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump He’s responsible and doesn’t want his supporters to get sick, unlike you who couldn’t care less about yours. You are openly mocking them. Disgusting.
1315789835567861761 2020-10-13 07:01:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @OANN @cspan @newsmax No thanks. I will be reading “Rage” tonight. That I will enjoy.
1315710769510731776 2020-10-13 01:47:46 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JohnJHarwood On Wisconsin! 😀
1315709097883455493 2020-10-13 01:41:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @carriecordero Excellent point!
1315684142407970816 2020-10-13 00:01:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You don’t have a plan. You are lying again. That’s one thing you’re good at, lying. You get an A+ for that.
1315680224881803264 2020-10-12 23:46:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You don’t deserve credit for anything. Everything you touched has eroded our country.
1315458812539699202 2020-10-12 09:06:35 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Going to get more people sick, but what do you care?
1315431351387070464 2020-10-12 07:17:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump LIAR!!!!
1315419817860530177 2020-10-12 06:31:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You are so awful.
1315365900695080963 2020-10-12 02:57:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You have to lie all the time because the truth is too damning for you. You are a fraud, liar and you don’t care about our citizens or country. You only care about yourself. The truth is setting is free from you.
1315284703268818944 2020-10-11 21:34:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jaketapper Trump is trying again to buy the election. He thinks we’re motivated by money like he is.
1315125925286219776 2020-10-11 11:03:49 +0800 <CherylHeide> @tedcruz When you were two Donald Trump was dodging the draft. Senator or draft dodger. Not a hard choice. Guess you prefer losers.
1314995018386505729 2020-10-11 02:23:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BarbMcQuade @GovWhitmer @detroitnews Wisconsin legislators are just as bad. They must take pointers from each other.
1314967172691750912 2020-10-11 00:32:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @sawsharee @DrDenaGrayson @ericgarland Trump has no regard for anyone other than himself.
1314752753105801216 2020-10-10 10:20:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DrDenaGrayson @ericgarland And then they’ll go home and infect family and friends and so on and so on.

A lot of us thought you would be one Senator we could count on to do the right thing. You are such a disappointment. Many have left the party b/c senators like you left us.
1314663415059709953 2020-10-10 04:25:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MikeOngstad We tried to warn them but I guess we weren’t the right kind of Republican for them.
1314662852523950081 2020-10-10 04:23:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DanRather Will Trump have the Folsom Prison Blues?
1314652379455909889 2020-10-10 03:42:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol So excited to hear about Chelsea’s wedding again.
1314597746251313157 2020-10-10 00:05:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mkraju The situation isn’t murky for We The People. Chaos in Washington is inexcusable in the middle of an exploding pandemic. They have let us down again when we need them the most. We won’t forget. Vote like your life depends on it, because it does.

1314315233708646400 2020-10-09 05:22:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MarilynCapps @journalsentinel It’s just been awful here. Now Pence is coming here for a rally on Monday. I’m grateful where I live is not as bad.

1314193463626338307 2020-10-08 21:18:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenMikeLee Thanks to my former party, the Republicans.
1314193172986294274 2020-10-08 21:17:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio It ain’t Pence. He loathes women. He’s still living in the dark ages.
1314190374684983299 2020-10-08 21:06:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @megynkelly But it’s ok if men do?
1314046881601908738 2020-10-08 11:36:05 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom It’s pretty hard to defend Trump’s failures on the fly.

1313677435402104833 2020-10-07 11:08:02 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRickWilson Maybe he added some MD 20/20 along with the roids.

1313673000089202690 2020-10-07 10:50:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol When you test, you find cases. Slow the testing down please.

1313647383478235139 2020-10-07 09:08:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyJongFast He hadn’t been testing, because when you test, you find more cases.
1313602646629126144 2020-10-07 06:10:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPLeader Trump called them off. You’re pathetic.

1313503162075156482 2020-10-06 23:35:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump We are not because of you.

1311650810984648706 2020-10-01 20:54:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump No. We need a new and improved president.
1311466203018387457 2020-10-01 08:41:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @yashar @jaygirl1980 He couldn’t care less about us Wisconsinites. As long as he is safe that’s all he cares about. But I’m sure his supporters will be there in droves with no masks. Then they’ll go home and spread it to innocent by-standers.
1311463404591349760 2020-10-01 08:30:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TheRickWilson He’ll want another shit show for the ratings.

1311138276707897351 2020-09-30 10:58:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MollyBeck @MarthaRaddatz And Trump wrestled with himself and lost.

1311133012529156096 2020-09-30 10:37:24 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BretBaier Trump lost bigly because he doesn’t know how to be a decent person.

1309465449789296641 2020-09-25 20:11:06 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPAmericanMom Remember when we thought that the Republican Congress would surely keep Trump in check?  Instead of protecting us, they protected Trump. Now they wonder why they can’t get re-elected. It boggles the mind.
1309464260146327552 2020-09-25 20:06:22 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillKristol It’s all hands on deck now. “A Republic. If you can keep it.” And keep it we shall.

1308959051766693888 2020-09-24 10:38:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Scaramucci I thought they did but I was duped. I will never be able to trust them again.
1308958326638735360 2020-09-24 10:35:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DonaldJTrumpJr At least he’s not killing people at rallies like your dad is.
1308944103443517441 2020-09-24 09:39:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio The man spreading all the disinformation is in the White House. Are they prepared for that? What do you have to say about his remarks today that he might not except the results of the election?
1308935650083774466 2020-09-24 09:05:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MittRomney Trump is the one that said it. Maybe you should talk to him.
1308889942102347776 2020-09-24 06:04:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DonaldJTrumpJr You just don’t like it when you get caught.
1308865808735576064 2020-09-24 04:28:21 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump That means Trump is a nobody too but he gets tested everyday and everyone around him too. As a nobody, I demand the same treatment as the president. He doesn’t care about any of the nobodies at his rallies. He just wants them to live long enough to vote for him.
1308843323357097997 2020-09-24 02:59:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP It was a dud just like #RussianRon
1308836148433870849 2020-09-24 02:30:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BradMossEsq He diverted the money to himself and has rallies and press conferences instead.
1308796877123575808 2020-09-23 23:54:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump The only one who is trying to rig the election is you, Donald J Trump.

1308581777695535104 2020-09-23 09:39:42 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump America lost when you became president. You lie about the virus and are hurting your supporters the most. How many will get sick from this rally?  It is the last thing you should be doing. But we know you only think of yourself.

1308539198836703237 2020-09-23 06:50:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP @GOPChairwoman I voted today for Joe Biden. 🇺🇸
1308536843424628736 2020-09-23 06:41:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump But he’ll go to his rally and downplay it again. It’s only old people. We are expendable. Guess he is too.
1308523346573885440 2020-09-23 05:47:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump We see how incompetent you are everyday.
1308522830653513729 2020-09-23 05:45:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MarshallCohen He got instructions from his buddy Putin.

1308502581224910852 2020-09-23 04:25:00 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio @sues711 But we can no longer trust you to tell us the truth. You let Trump control the narrative and we are left in the dark. Putin is his friend and has something on him. You don’t seem to mind.
1308472486892363777 2020-09-23 02:25:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @TexHellCat Maybe a vision but not an actual plan. He’ll just say everyone gets insurance.
1308460818829316100 2020-09-23 01:39:03 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mkraju Sure,  because it doesn’t look good for him politically. If he truly cared he wouldn’t hold rallies.

1307673107067482112 2020-09-20 21:28:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 I second that emotion.
1307666293508714496 2020-09-20 21:01:54 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump This shtick isn’t working anymore. Sad!
1307663341956091905 2020-09-20 20:50:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump No
1307494067463483393 2020-09-20 09:37:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JoeBiden 😂👍
1307488886994677760 2020-09-20 09:16:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 That would be the best thing that ever happened to us.
1307482437228859392 2020-09-20 08:51:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maxasteele @realDonaldTrump Those performance enhancing drugs must not be working for him. 🤷‍♀️
1307478160146075648 2020-09-20 08:34:19 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maxasteele I know it will never happen, but I have this fantasy of Trump getting booed off the stage at one of his rallies. 😊
1307474402129448960 2020-09-20 08:19:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @HeathMayo It’s all about the money. Nothing else.
1307473342115581952 2020-09-20 08:15:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln Well said. Thank you. #America 🇺🇸
1307426897039679488 2020-09-20 05:10:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPAmericanMom Got to love those guys. My husband used to always get me roses for Mother’s Day. After he had a stroke and could no longer walk or drive anymore, he would insist I buy them for myself. They’re the best. ❤️
1307423009330823168 2020-09-20 04:55:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOPAmericanMom That made me laugh. Thanks. ❤️
1307417348429799424 2020-09-20 04:32:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @joelockhart Trump taught them well.
1307413916767662081 2020-09-20 04:19:02 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Susan_Hennessey @pennyparker0523 The GOP will never do the right thing. Our health and psyche depend on remembering this. I found out the hard way. Time after time I thought surely certain members of Congress would come to our rescue. Only one did and he was ridiculed. The only remedy is voting them out.
1307388835488301058 2020-09-20 02:39:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SykesCharlie Thanks for taking one for the Gipper. 🇺🇸
1307151041981493249 2020-09-19 10:54:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jkbjournalist We’re mad as hell and we ain’t gonna take it anymore!!!
1307044137716383744 2020-09-19 03:49:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @journalsentinel Maybe that’s why we broke the one day total increase in cases again today. Seems like it doesn’t bother them if they infect others.
1307018767734648832 2020-09-19 02:08:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS You have already told us you don’t like troops that have been captured so it’s very hypocritical of you to send this tweet. You don’t believe a word of it.
1306773245522214912 2020-09-18 09:53:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @BillOReilly Your just used to Trump lying whenever he opens his mouth. It’s hard for you that Joe is smart enough to know the answers. Get used to it.
1306759780581638145 2020-09-18 08:59:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @maggieNYT I thought he was in Wisconsin tonight.
1306746459686088704 2020-09-18 08:06:48 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP @realDonaldTrump How does it help when all Trump does is lies?  He lied and people died.
1306741088779206656 2020-09-18 07:45:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln Yup. Just checked. My ballot is on the way.

1306642016143659008 2020-09-18 01:11:47 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln America 🇺🇸
1306571065649487872 2020-09-17 20:29:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump All you care about is red states. We are the United States of America and we will never let you divide us. You are un-American and don’t represent American values. You are the opposite.
1306337935063687173 2020-09-17 05:03:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump I’ll enjoy because I won’t be watching.
1306271312202039297 2020-09-17 00:38:44 +0800 <CherylHeide> @neeratanden I checked the Magic 8-Ball. It said YES.
1306241612377456641 2020-09-16 22:40:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump It’s the Republicans who don’t want to give stimulus checks to the people.

1305996220473712643 2020-09-16 06:25:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @journalsentinel Shhhh!  Don’t tell Trump.
1305872532302639104 2020-09-15 22:14:08 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ddale8 He probably just read the chapter titles.
1305704942552920069 2020-09-15 11:08:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 He made sure he was safe, but everyone else is on their own. To Trump it’s just the price of doing business.
1305696757930692608 2020-09-15 10:35:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump This is America. We can choose how to vote depending on the rules of our state. It’s none of your business.
1305695086802591745 2020-09-15 10:29:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You made sure you protected yourself. You couldn’t care less about your supporters. You lied to us and your supporters will pay the price. The rest of know not to believe you.
1305693575762632705 2020-09-15 10:23:01 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump Yup we can see right through him. It ain’t pretty.
1305692990388789250 2020-09-15 10:20:42 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenRonJohnson You aid the Russians. You you have little room to talk.
1305692340837928966 2020-09-15 10:18:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @PreetBharara 50 days to stop the scourge of Trumpism.

1305684684756652032 2020-09-15 09:47:41 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SykesCharlie I think the troops might notice. Another slur.
1305670550417801217 2020-09-15 08:51:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP @realDonaldTrump The Republicans have killed the American dream.
1305645047220711424 2020-09-15 07:10:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln @SenRonJohnson is making a fool of himself and the State of Wisconsin.
1305642904325627905 2020-09-15 07:01:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mkraju Hey @SenRubioPress. Why don’t you issue an interim report like AG Barr is doing with the Durham report?  What’s fair is fair.
1305634833553592322 2020-09-15 06:29:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @sbauerAP @ScottWalker Guess they don’t like it when someone does the right thing. 🤷‍♀️

1304981436919930880 2020-09-13 11:13:14 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln Trump is leading his lambs to slaughter and they happily oblige. He couldn’t care less what happens to them other than they live long enough to vote.
1304964695388979201 2020-09-13 10:06:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Yes it is despicable that you said it. You are un-American.
1304950226596364290 2020-09-13 09:09:13 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump I’m sure you’re so proud of spreading COVID-19 to all your followers. They must be thrilled.
1304946038558650368 2020-09-13 08:52:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump This was from 2016. He has all Biden signs now.
1304943991918661640 2020-09-13 08:44:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime What about your buddy the prez?  You don’t care about his taxes. You’re not very good at this Twitter thing.
1304938163987767296 2020-09-13 08:21:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @jdawsey1 Just keep spreading that COVID-19.

1304630181659906048 2020-09-12 11:57:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Weinsteinlaw And he did it all wearing a mask. 😷

1304608146216939520 2020-09-12 10:29:55 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump It’s your own words and it’s too late to take them back. How you deceived your fellow citizens is criminal.

1304167619570946048 2020-09-11 05:19:25 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 @TIME Should make Trump happy that he made the cover of Time.
1304142417512325122 2020-09-11 03:39:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @CharlesMBlow I really don’t care, do you? They will have to suffer the consequences of their actions. So may times many of us ex-Republicans thought this time they’ll come to our rescue. The time never came. Can’t trust them anymore.
1304136932918689792 2020-09-11 03:17:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SykesCharlie Oh great.
1304110567557394433 2020-09-11 01:32:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NikkiHaley We know. You’d rather people get sick to save the economy just like your buddy Trump. Who cares if people die right?
1304088113963302913 2020-09-11 00:03:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Mike_Pence You are head of the task force and you didn’t tell us the truth either.
1304053254024765442 2020-09-10 21:44:58 +0800 <CherylHeide> @marcorubio Evidently you too don’t care that 190,000 people died because Trump lied.
1304052383320768512 2020-09-10 21:41:30 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Jim_Jordan Yes he is fighting hard to kill us.
1304048115960479744 2020-09-10 21:24:33 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You did this to us. But it’s mostly old people and brown people so who cares?  Right? You just didn’t want to panic the stock market.
1303885363312820227 2020-09-10 10:37:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You lied, people died. The hoax was played on us by you.
1303833465914380290 2020-09-10 07:11:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump He never fought for us at all. He lied. People died. We’ve had enough.
1303819180714663939 2020-09-10 06:14:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @AshaRangappa_ @SenJohnKennedy Didn’t he go to Oxford? I’m beginning to think it was the Crackerjack version. Fake diploma.
1303772901481512967 2020-09-10 03:10:57 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JohnBrennan @JoChiaradia Yes he would. He’s having a news conference to announce future Supreme Court justices instead. 😡
1303769235999645696 2020-09-10 02:56:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln Trump played Russian Roulette with our lives. Almost 200,000 dead and some now have adverse effects they have to live with the rest of their lives.

1303731111605006338 2020-09-10 00:24:53 +0800 <CherylHeide> @mkraju @Susan_Hennessey We all knew this, but to hear it in his own words has me sick to my stomach. Lives and livelihoods lost because he wanted to be re-elected. This dereliction of duty in the highest degree.
1303729317634027520 2020-09-10 00:17:46 +0800 <CherylHeide> @rorycooper But there are tapes.
1303688003488034816 2020-09-09 21:33:36 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your Dad’s supporter killed two people.

1303508808266907652 2020-09-09 09:41:32 +0800 <CherylHeide> @senatemajldr As a former Republican, because of Trump and enablers like you, I don’t believe a word you say. You don’t care about America, only the money you can make.

1303157800646963201 2020-09-08 10:26:45 +0800 <CherylHeide> @tedcruz You have become even more disgusting than you used to be. Emulating your hero?
1303126728567595013 2020-09-08 08:23:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @CNN It’s not a news conference you’re having. It’s a campaign rally. Why should they cover it?
1303124830867329025 2020-09-08 08:15:45 +0800 <CherylHeide> @jkempcpa @njgypsyg I agree.
1303093054119739395 2020-09-08 06:09:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RVAT2020 I agree Becky. I thought most of the Republicans in Congress would have our backs. Those chose Trump instead. Now they all sound just like him. They forever tarnished the Republican Party. I’m voting for Biden too. #AmericaOrTrump
1303085339116961793 2020-09-08 05:38:49 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ShaneGoldmacher @maggieNYT So now he has a press conference everyday instead. It’s free. I’m sure a lot of the money went to himself.
1303067470475988992 2020-09-08 04:27:49 +0800 <CherylHeide> @callis_karen @wtsparrow2 @RadioFreeTom But Ron Johnson is a Wisconsin senator.  Unless Kander moves here.
1303048763443994624 2020-09-08 03:13:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SenDuckworth He’s never going to do it. Trump says the allegations against him aren’t true concerning what he said about the troops. But his non-action is all the proof we need. You are right. Trump loves Putin more than our troops. If he cared, he would have acted immediately.
1303045353663590400 2020-09-08 02:59:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom I truly thought my senator, Ron Johnson, would be one of those guardrails. I was terribly duped. Still 2 years before he’s up for re-election. 😞
1303008702618841088 2020-09-08 00:34:18 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump THESE ARE NOT NEW JOBS. PEOPLE WENT BACK TO THEIR OLD JOBS.
1302981815460823040 2020-09-07 22:47:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump @OANN OANN? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1302975073956044800 2020-09-07 22:20:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump The weak president is a so called Republican.
1302969080744378370 2020-09-07 21:56:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Another campaign rally of lies? No thanks.
1302964136305987585 2020-09-07 21:37:12 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Have you ever told the truth?
1302954917502619650 2020-09-07 21:00:34 +0800 <CherylHeide> @EdHull8 @MomWithAnS 🙏❤️
1302951115663736835 2020-09-07 20:45:28 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Then why aren’t you helping the situation instead of encouraging it?  I know. You want us divided. A real president would want us united.
1302795045397987328 2020-09-07 10:25:18 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump They’re disgusting because they’re true. He’s said similar things in public. You lied all the time too. You both cried wolf too many times. We’re on to you.
1302772180481175553 2020-09-07 08:54:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump You’re the one pushing false stories. You can’t open your mouth without lying.
1302726190856318984 2020-09-07 05:51:42 +0800 <CherylHeide> @UTSunriseSunset @bruce4nv So cute.
1302664265728430082 2020-09-07 01:45:37 +0800 <CherylHeide> @SteveSchmidtSES @ProjectLincoln It made me cry. 😢
1302610722753519617 2020-09-06 22:12:52 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump I will never forgive or forget that you called my husband, father, uncles, my 2X gr grandfather that was killed in the civil war fighting for our country, my Revolutionary War grandfathers suckers and losers. You are a disgrace to this great nation.

1302346721708646402 2020-09-06 04:43:49 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GOP Not new jobs. They were called back to old jobs. You can’t even tell the truth about that. Disgusting.
1302274249995046913 2020-09-05 23:55:50 +0800 <CherylHeide> @barbarastarrcnn Thank you Barbara. I appreciate your reporting on our military.
1302237082551832583 2020-09-05 21:28:09 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump All those things you just said you did are not true. You lie whenever you talk. Next thing you’ll say that you created heaven and earth.
1302077371315556352 2020-09-05 10:53:31 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ASlavitt How is it individualism when you spread the virus to others? 🤷‍♀️
1302076143772807174 2020-09-05 10:48:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NawNawStinger @FLOTUS @TheAtlantic They sure like digging themselves in holes.
1302074556514009088 2020-09-05 10:42:20 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump My Dad SSGT Warren Pohlman, Army Air Corp. He was a belly gunner in B-24. Never talked about it much. 2 brothers also served. #WeRespectOurVets  https://t.co/mKAO2GtQme
1302057962538762240 2020-09-05 09:36:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> He’d rather protect Putin than our troops.
1302057222067847168 2020-09-05 09:33:27 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DanScavino No one believes you either.
1302056168471355392 2020-09-05 09:29:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DaniellaCarlisi Yes.
1302055445922746368 2020-09-05 09:26:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @DevinNunes You’re a disgrace too. Just like your dear leader. You’re all alike.
1302053502970138626 2020-09-05 09:18:40 +0800 <CherylHeide> @MelissaAmour72 @GOP Exactly. They all deserve to lose.
1302052814806552577 2020-09-05 09:15:56 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln Trump can’t even go out in rain. His fake hair might go askew. 😂
1302038482571997184 2020-09-05 08:18:59 +0800 <CherylHeide> @kylegriffin1 His debt must be exceeding high and the interest is astronomical.
1302024859430641664 2020-09-05 07:24:51 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom @putinsclown Playing offense before he has to play defense.

1301729560577413121 2020-09-04 11:51:26 +0800 <CherylHeide> @reginaldedward3 It does hurt. It’s unforgivable. He has no business making decisions regarding our troops if this is how he feels.
1301724696925343744 2020-09-04 11:32:07 +0800 <CherylHeide> @atrupar @ifudontlike2bad There he goes again. Going to use the Bible as a prop.

1301700667158016001 2020-09-04 09:56:38 +0800 <CherylHeide> Posting picture of late husband on right and fellow crew chiefs. Smitty, sitting in middle, didn’t make it home. Such losers.  https://t.co/7ov6rkhwP4

1301683906173964290 2020-09-04 08:50:02 +0800 <CherylHeide> @generalkellogg You all lie so why should we believe you now?
1301677477190926337 2020-09-04 08:24:29 +0800 <CherylHeide> @ProjectLincoln He’s not a president just stand-in
1301665569058549763 2020-09-04 07:37:10 +0800 <CherylHeide> @Alyssafarah @realDonaldTrump Just stop. The only one he holds in high regard is himself. Do yourself a favor and resign or you’re toast too.
1301651983602978817 2020-09-04 06:43:11 +0800 <CherylHeide> @JuddPDeere45 No they’re not. He’s done it many times with his actions. Won’t condemn Russia for bounties on our soldiers. He doesn’t like soldiers who are captured. Abandoned the Kurds. Raided funds for Vets during campaign. Uses military only for props.

1301265453302546433 2020-09-03 05:07:15 +0800 <CherylHeide> @clive22 Still meat shortages too.
1301255994379468801 2020-09-03 04:29:39 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t mean a darn thing to most Americans. Still massive unemployment.
1301184679127797762 2020-09-02 23:46:17 +0800 <CherylHeide> @NancyHazen16 @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump I think he was drinking bleach long before the pandemic.
1301168933408571395 2020-09-02 22:43:42 +0800 <CherylHeide> @realDonaldTrump We have to fact-check you every hour. Your whole life is a lie.

1300968251250348034 2020-09-02 09:26:16 +0800 <CherylHeide> @RadioFreeTom “And that’s the way it is.”

1300773750372265985 2020-09-01 20:33:23 +0800 <CherylHeide> @reginaldedward3 😂 At least there won’t be any conspiracy theories.
1300756469437128704 2020-09-01 19:24:43 +0800 <CherylHeide> @GenMhayden He was very embarrassing.
1300624431744790530 2020-09-01 10:40:03 +0800 <CherylHeide> @svdate Between the press conference and this interview he must not have much of a foot left. Open mouth, insert foot, chomp.
