1340362159172308999 2020-12-20 02:23:36 +0800 <Francis50441920> In the election of '20,we're told close to 156M voted. Thus the percent of votes to estimated registered is, 156M/160M=98%. In '16, the total no. of votes was 127M. The disparity of close to 30M more votes appearing in '20, &amp; a 98% votes to registered voters,are anomalies. 4 of 4
1340359561711132673 2020-12-20 02:13:16 +0800 <Francis50441920> This link shows a 67% registration with respect to the total population,  https://t.co/0JjeZEKujY.  The total of 339M, only 239M were eligible to vote, either by reason of age, or immigration status. So in reality registered to vote are .67 x 239M =160M.  3 of 4
1340357719002329090 2020-12-20 02:05:57 +0800 <Francis50441920> We don't know how many millions of illegals,legal residents, were counted in the last 339M population estimate, but adding 26.3M(non-citizens) to 73.7M(children) =100M unable to vote, thus the 239M is the estimated no. of eligible '20 voters found in some articles. 2 of 4

1340340765818535938 2020-12-20 00:58:35 +0800 <Francis50441920> In the link below, a chart shows the ratio of registered voters to eligible voters in the US as being 67%., meaning that if you multiply .67 registered X 239M eligible=160M registered,&amp; 156M voted in '20. A 98% registered voter participation,a percent never seen in an US election

1340335448951013379 2020-12-20 00:37:27 +0800 <Francis50441920> "Given that around 239.2 million Americans were eligible to vote in 2020, the projected number of voters brings us to a 66.8% turnout rate." Here is a lie,pushed in this Google post.Eligible voters should shouldn't be compared to the 156M who voted,but to the number of registered
1340330340523630593 2020-12-20 00:17:09 +0800 <Francis50441920> If this last coup is triumphant,&amp; demented Joe is installed president, w/ our SCOTUS' imprimatur of approval,led by a seditious Chief Justice who became complicit w/ a plot which we've watched unfold before our own eyes, this Shiny City on the Hill won't shine for much longer.

Even if the constitution delegates the states legislatures the processes used in their local and national elections, a federal law requiring a national ID for federal elections does not seem like a violation of the constitution, but a way of preventing illegal votes.

1333797221649637377 2020-12-01 23:36:53 +0800 <Francis50441920> We assumed that the 100M citizens who didn't vote allowed the fraud committed by the old demented-pedopervert-plagiarist-liar-corrupt-traitor Joe Biden, in reality,the Dominion machines &amp; the mail-in-ballot perversion would have produced the same results.

1333489979641786374 2020-12-01 03:16:00 +0800 <Francis50441920> Yesterday,I read a report of an expert on statistics &amp; computers,who was approached by the FBI as to the evidence he has gathered as to signs of voter fraud in this election. In other words,w/ billions spent/yr on the DOJ &amp; FBI, they have no 'capacity' to conduct an investigation
1333441691680911363 2020-12-01 00:04:08 +0800 <Francis50441920> Demorats have declared war on the Republic, it might not be similar to when they opened fire on Ft. Sumter in 1861, but treason against the Republic via this electoral coup, is just as grave an act of war, as when the first cannonade landed on that island fort.
1333434862485835781 2020-11-30 23:36:59 +0800 <Francis50441920> If we reverse this electoral coup which DemoRats have committed,as if Republican had prepared it,launched it,&amp; have tried to illegally re-elect Trump,the insurrectional communist forces within our nation would have erupted by now,&amp; death &amp; destruction by now be reigning in the US
1333430996180545541 2020-11-30 23:21:38 +0800 <Francis50441920> With all the evidence available on this last electoral coup, in the olden days we would have looked towards our Justice Department to right the wrongs committed, and now, more than half of the population don't even have faith in that last chimera, called American Justice.
1333428811048873986 2020-11-30 23:12:57 +0800 <Francis50441920> If this criminal electoral coup is allowed to stand,for the sake of tranquility,we would never again be able to look at each other faces,&amp; tell one another, "We Live In A Democratic Republic".When that occurs, this Republic would have ended,as originally conceived by our Founders

1330888044040294400 2020-11-23 22:56:51 +0800 <Francis50441920> Is DA Durham, now ready to release his report on the indictees accused in the first treasonous coup against Trump, or do we have to wait until the legal and illegal votes are totally counted, but until traitor Biden is criminally coronated ??

The problem in the Mail-in-Ballot states is that the only way to vote,was to mail in your ballots,for precincts were closed.That's where most of the fraud occurred,&amp; the Dominion machines which changed in-person voting

If the fraud is overturned and Trump declared the winner, the last 8 months of riots, looting, arson, assaults and murders, would look like children playing touch football.  What we shall contemplate after the news breaks, would be 10 times worse. Be prepared.
1328790949598785538 2020-11-18 04:03:44 +0800 <Francis50441920> Now, the news is that the Dominion machines used were not bought from the manufacturers, but from outlets which sold them.Apparently the person who gave the report, the manufacturers were weary they would be used, discovered, and trace the voter fraud back to them. GA spent $100M
1328789468678156290 2020-11-18 03:57:51 +0800 <Francis50441920> We thought that the 110M Americans who did not vote, or weren't even registered to vote, might have made a difference in this election. But with the Dominion machines the DemoRats bought, which switched votes from Trump to Biden, in the end, we might have had the same results.

1328717447202017281 2020-11-17 23:11:40 +0800 <Francis50441920> @saminhim When the votes needed to overcome the Trump lead over demented Biden was so massive on 11/3, that is the reason that in some states,using Mail-in-Ballots,once the votes needed were found, the official numbers of registered voters were less, or close to 100%, of those who 'voted'.
1328710590467076100 2020-11-17 22:44:25 +0800 <Francis50441920> Why built voters signature verification machines, with dials to adjust the accuracy from 0% to 100%?

1328345853761884163 2020-11-16 22:35:05 +0800 <Francis50441920> @Melanie_elmacre And Twitter went to Congress to tell it that Twitter would be like a podium for free speech &amp; the exchange of rough &amp; tumble ideas, &amp; the publishing laws which rule the news media should be suspended for it, since Twitter won't act as a publisher. The Bird did the opposite
1328343688091668480 2020-11-16 22:26:29 +0800 <Francis50441920> Do you think DA Durham,who empaneled a Grand Jury in DC, a city in which 96% voted against Trump, would that GJ indict any of the criminals in the Russian Hoax First Coup?
1328336785227837440 2020-11-16 21:59:03 +0800 <Francis50441920> @1grandmamean Biden and Harris might be in prison once their involvement in this treasonous electoral coup is revealed. They'll be doing their taxes from Ft. Leavenworth, not looking at Trump's taxes.
1328332950388269057 2020-11-16 21:43:49 +0800 <Francis50441920> @TPInsidr This vast conspiracy to steal an election,must include a vast number of traitors who confabulated, planned &amp; launched this third coup against the president. In the first coup, not a single traitor has visited the interior of a jail cell,let's hope in this one,we don't wait 4 year
1328331576078438401 2020-11-16 21:38:21 +0800 <Francis50441920> @TPInsidr Last June, when Newsom issued his dictat that a mail-in-ballot election was to occurred in CA,that was the time for all judges immersed in the Constitution,to have annulled the order of the dictator as unconstitutional,not after the election took placed &amp; the crime occurred.
1328211463060791296 2020-11-16 13:41:04 +0800 <Francis50441920> @realDonaldTrump Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election.

1328098488173916161 2020-11-16 06:12:09 +0800 <Francis50441920> As the electoral theft is peeled off like a rotten onion, the demented President-elect is very quiet, and his hoe VP is as quiet.

1328093095213273088 2020-11-16 05:50:43 +0800 <Francis50441920> If it was not this critical, to have a maniac like Andrew Cuomo directing one of the biggest states in the union, his demented outburst would be comical, not tragical.
1328090343477272578 2020-11-16 05:39:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> In reality,when 110M didn't vote,Americans became involved in a 3rd coup plot to take DT out,vile forces known as the Deep State could have succeeded in this last coup,in conclusion,we really don't deserve Trump's personal sacrifice,nor what he did for the US in 3 yr. A tragedy!?

1328087423184723969 2020-11-16 05:28:11 +0800 <Francis50441920> While dealing w/a criminal organization known as the New DemoRat Party,Republicans are still giving the impression that they're dealing with an honest opponent whose differences ought to be resolved via our electoral processes ,when in fact,we're at war for the survival of the US
1328084799542734849 2020-11-16 05:17:45 +0800 <Francis50441920> Last time in CA, Trump lost to the Crook by 2 million votes, this time, by 5M to a demented-pedopervert-liar-corrupt-plagiaracist old fool. Only a state in which masochism is the new normative,would you believe the results of this corrupt sham, known as Mail-in-Ballot Election.
1328082698250940416 2020-11-16 05:09:24 +0800 <Francis50441920> If we look at citizens who've supported d last 3 coups against a duly elected president,based on d lie that he is a traitor,a nazi,a tyrant,we've to ask ourselves, "Where have we gone wrong in educating &amp; preparing our future leaders,who one day would take control of d Republic?"
1328080218175713281 2020-11-16 04:59:33 +0800 <Francis50441920> We're led to believe that Californians,under d boot of Gov.

Voting in CA, Biden 10.8M,Trump 5.8M.This is where Biden received his difference in d total national votes.Fraud For Impact

1328074698979233793 2020-11-16 04:37:37 +0800 <Francis50441920> @SirGoogooSir The ANC in South Africa Established Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commissions, &amp; more than 5,000 white farmers have been murdered by the communist-racist regime which rules that nation. Has the world condemned those murders, as it did when terrorist Mandela was imprisoned for terrorism?
1328069579109699584 2020-11-16 04:17:16 +0800 <Francis50441920> This electoral coup,as well as the previous two,were planned &amp; launched by d vast criminal machinery known as d DemoRat Party.The same criminal outfit which led to Civil War,Jim Crow Laws,KKK,Lynching of black citizen,&amp; we're told to look outwardly for d enemies of this republic
1328020275678629893 2020-11-16 01:01:21 +0800 <Francis50441920> DA Durham empaneled a Grand Jury on DC, a DemoRat stronghold, which voted 96% against Trump in 2020. We're expecting that such a grand jury would be interested in indicting, those who like themselves, hated Trump enough, to even launch a coup d'etat against a president.

1327724508489330689 2020-11-15 05:26:05 +0800 <Francis50441920> @LiliaDragonX That would be great news.However, when 3 coups already, &amp; w/the help of our intelligence agencies,&amp; the national security apparatus in place,I would rather believe that this third coup against DT was still launched by those agencies. Even Gen.Milley took his sword out to warn DT.
1327722897012568064 2020-11-15 05:19:41 +0800 <Francis50441920> Imagine a future America, w/ a DemoRat Party not disbanded &amp; still in place,preparing other coups, more electoral frauds w/better equipments, &amp; selling the country out for money. These US would become hell on earth, or another civil war might be in the future of our descendants

1327717889361801218 2020-11-15 04:59:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> @JackJolis After 4 yrs since the Obama-Biden regime launched the first coup,nobody is indicted or in jail, and we are now in the third coup, after the Ukrainian impeachment hoax-coup,&amp; there isn't even a hint that our DOJ has the goods on the traitors whom the people have already identified
1327715226314223618 2020-11-15 04:49:12 +0800 <Francis50441920> @JackJolis It is, and AG Barr even warned the Demorats that they were playing with fire, with their mail-in-ballot criminal scheme.

1327709832594546690 2020-11-15 04:27:46 +0800 <Francis50441920> As one of the biggest traitors in the nation, Sen.

1327620746412224513 2020-11-14 22:33:46 +0800 <Francis50441920> When mons. ago we heard Hillary &amp; other DemoRats tell us the Army would need to take DT out of the WH when he loses the election,it now makes sense.When Biden told us DemoRats, "..prepared the most extensive &amp; inclusive voter fraud system in US history",the rat knew our reaction.
1327619031843692548 2020-11-14 22:26:57 +0800 <Francis50441920> If this battle against an electoral robbery perpetrated against the people of the US is not won,this republic will crumbled like a house of cards.The battle to destroy the forces of evil trying to make us slaves would be arduous,full of sweat,&amp; even blood,but needs to be waged
1327614579178938370 2020-11-14 22:09:16 +0800 <Francis50441920> The first coup, was launched from within the vowels of our bureaucracy, and was well represented by criminal lawyers. In this one, it seems that the USPS bureaucracy was up to its necks in helping to illegally elect a demented-corrupt-pedopervert-plagliarist-lying-old geezer.
1327612498208583683 2020-11-14 22:01:00 +0800 <Francis50441920> Like a well trained group of applauding seals,this coup against the sovereignty of the American people,is being applauded by our US Press,MSM, and DemoRats.

1327428830038986753 2020-11-14 09:51:10 +0800 <Francis50441920> If you induct a Grand Jury in DC, where 96% of the population vote Demorat, what are the chances any DA has for that Grand Jury to indict 100% of the suspected Demorats criminals involved in the Trump coup attempt, which was planned and launched by their Demorat's Messiah, Obama?

Life has its ups and down and sometimes we need to extend our hand and like a miracle someone would appear to lift us up. It's innate in us humans of faith in God. You, as well as others should pray for her.

1326611984050216960 2020-11-12 03:45:18 +0800 <Francis50441920> @cruadin Knowing Trump, if Biden is found guilty of treason, he probably commutes the death by hanging sentence, to life in his basement.  Trump is a noble person, if he was the tyrant he is accused of being, dozens of traitors would have been pushing daisies by now.

1326570546058964992 2020-11-12 01:00:39 +0800 <Francis50441920> We're led to believe Biden received 74M votes, even if 10M votes were fraudulent, the sobering question which ought to scare the thinking citizens of this nation is, "Did 64M compatriots really thought that a corrupt-demented-pedopervert-liar like Biden should be president?"
1326568646630662145 2020-11-12 00:53:06 +0800 <Francis50441920> We watch the vote corruptela in 4 or 5 states,which were part of the 80M COVID Mail-in-Ballots,&amp; which led to this crisis.What are the reports from CA, OR &amp; WA, are they as dirty as the other 4 or 5 states.

1326530122560704517 2020-11-11 22:20:01 +0800 <Francis50441920> So Biden, who was in the initial coup attempt against president Trump, is now is asking for peace talks and fraternity? If by crook or hook Biden becomes president, let's hope that once the GOP gets control of the House and Senate, impeachment investigations begins on this crook.
1326528626431549443 2020-11-11 22:14:04 +0800 <Francis50441920> Hunter Biden was communicating with a Chinese spy, doing 'business' with him, did our intelligence agencies intercepted those communiques like it did with Gen.

1325245095436808198 2020-11-08 09:13:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> FBI Director Wray, a few weeks ago was asked about voter fraud, and he responded that it is not a danger to our democracy.
1325243455925313541 2020-11-08 09:07:16 +0800 <Francis50441920> @ctuton1 The CIA was supposed to lie, deceive and rob our enemies outside our borders, but now we found out that they were doing the same to us under Brennan, and thus became the enemies of our democracy.
1325242293822119937 2020-11-08 09:02:39 +0800 <Francis50441920> @ctuton1 But the illusion of our superior ethics over the Bananeros to our south ended, with our three attempts at illegally removing President Trump from office. We are in deeper crapolla than we think.
1325240341570736128 2020-11-08 08:54:53 +0800 <Francis50441920> Sending our FBI agents to guard the uncounted ballots, is similar to sending Colonel Sanders to guard your chicken coop against night robbers.
1325239168813985794 2020-11-08 08:50:14 +0800 <Francis50441920> I'm so old, that I still remember when our politicians used to mock the Bananas Republic south of the Rio Grande. I guess after these two coups attempts against our President, they are going to have to stick their tongues where the Sun don't shine.

1325194811700367361 2020-11-08 05:53:58 +0800 <Francis50441920> @washingtonpost I'm waiting to see the day when the leftist maniacs expropriate Amazon, WaPo, as well as Bezos' mansions, and give them to the unemployed and unwashed proletariat. I saw that movie, a long time ago, in what used to be called the Pearl of the Antilles.
1325192247047053312 2020-11-08 05:43:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> After the news networks declared Biden the winner, everything is quiet in this Red state.

1325161120592584708 2020-11-08 03:40:06 +0800 <Francis50441920> After Bin Laden was killed,2 day later Joe revealed that Seal Team 6 killed him. One seal called his mother to tell her d moron had put a target on their back, weeks later d team perished in an ambush which downed their helicopter.This is d same idiot who'd have our nuclear code
1325153799409815554 2020-11-08 03:11:00 +0800 <Francis50441920> Biden a good man?A pedopervert,plagiarizer,lied about his credentials,cheated w/ the wife of a friend who is now his wife,women accused him of sexual assault,corrupt to the core,who is compromised by China's largesse,a Catholic in favor of abortion.Are we talking about Joe Biden?
1325152481781796865 2020-11-08 03:05:46 +0800 <Francis50441920> People do have the government they deserve,especially when the greatest nation the world have ever seen,is in an existential crisis, when having to choose between the yoke of socialism, and the freedom granted by our constitution, and half of its electors stayed home on 11/3/2020
1325152011478818816 2020-11-08 03:03:54 +0800 <Francis50441920> After all votes needed by Biden to win are in,&amp; Joe is declared to be our new corrupt president,d US should also be declared the Biggest Banana Republic in the American Continent.I remember the era when we called republics to our south,Banana Republics,based on their coup d'etat
1325150577932767233 2020-11-08 02:58:12 +0800 <Francis50441920> Who in hell is going to identified illegal votes after criminals intermixed them with legal ones,&amp; now a judge in a post mortem stops further counting new votes? As AG Barr said, DemoRats are playing with fire,&amp; it might not be a simple fire,but a fire similar to Krakatoa, 1883
1325149633618669569 2020-11-08 02:54:27 +0800 <Francis50441920> We've heard the refrain that this is the most important election in our history,&amp; many believe it's,but in a nation of 280M citizens who're able to exercise the sacred right to vote,only 140M had done so.Were 140M absentee citizens unaware,or just didn't care d dangers US faces?
1325148705620684800 2020-11-08 02:50:46 +0800 <Francis50441920> It'll be an ignominious day for America,when a demented-pedopervert-liar-plagiarist &amp; corrupt politician,becomes president via a traitorous electoral process,produced not by a party,but by a criminal organization known as d Socialist Demorat Party of d US.We'll live to regret it
1325148284403343362 2020-11-08 02:49:05 +0800 <Francis50441920> Our only hope, and the hope of millions who love this great nation, is that when this last coup is revealed in its immense depravity, instead of a glorious victory, those who prepared and launched this fraudulent election would spent their last days in prison.

1325146344701505536 2020-11-08 02:41:23 +0800 <Francis50441920> As seditious &amp; malignant forces were inserted into the halls that maintained our culture &amp; ethos in our society, &amp; finally took over our Press,MSM,Academia,Politics,Education,Entertainment,&amp; Social Media, we now awoke to the disaster of what that sedition produced
1325145451876675584 2020-11-08 02:37:50 +0800 <Francis50441920> One thing Trump has shown the unbelievers among us, even if this coup succeeds,"The Deep State is real, the Swamp is deeper,larger &amp; more noxious than we thought,the federal bureaucracy is a cancer within our Republic, Demorats are criminals" We owe that to President Trump !
1325144597526278144 2020-11-08 02:34:26 +0800 <Francis50441920> Founders delegated local &amp; national elections to the states,&amp; they warned us that this republic would only last as long as its citizens were well educated, well informed,ethical &amp; moral individuals.They couldn't foresee that one day, states' traitors would fixed our elections
1325143715875344384 2020-11-08 02:30:56 +0800 <Francis50441920> World leaders,friends &amp; foes, laughed when a cognitive impaired Joe Biden became the nominee for president of the DemoRat Party. If he's sworn in, consternation would take over our friends &amp; allies,&amp; our enemies would be uncorking champagne bottles for a toast to our idiocy
1325143001304330240 2020-11-08 02:28:06 +0800 <Francis50441920> If we keep relying on programmable computers to count votes, our search for more rapid results, might also lead to more elections being stolen by corrupt programmers, as we are learning in this electoral fraud.

1325139384706985985 2020-11-08 02:13:43 +0800 <Francis50441920> Justice Alito's order to PA,is like calling to a bunch of donkeys,to come back to the barn after they escaped. That order should have been issued when DT appeal to the Supreme Court to issue such an order, before the election took place. This sh*t looks like a chinese fire drill
1325137913735122944 2020-11-08 02:07:53 +0800 <Francis50441920> The same software used in a Michigan county, which due to a 'glitch' changed 6,000 votes for Trump and gave them to Biden, have been used in 47 other MI counties, and suspected of having been used in 30 states. The last venomous arrow in Pelosi's quiver?!
1325136990325645312 2020-11-08 02:04:13 +0800 <Francis50441920> Sequestered ballots?What have criminals been doing in d last 4 day,if not sending ballots through d computer counters.Who in hell is going to identify ballots once they are taken out of their envelopes &amp; sent through d machines. How did DT went from +800K to -25K, in 3 day in PA?
1325135852826206208 2020-11-08 01:59:41 +0800 <Francis50441920> After the evidence of illegal ballots being counted, software 'glitches' changing votes, observers denied observing the counting of votes, our airhead &amp; babbling Speaker Pelosi, yesterday declared a demented-pedopervert-liar-plagiarist and corrupt politician, president elect.

1325135128746618880 2020-11-08 01:56:49 +0800 <Francis50441920> And we are led to believe that 73M voted for returning to the 8 years of misery the Obama-Biden regime gave us, with its high unemployment, poverty &amp; food stamps breaking all records, and a GDP average at 1.9/yr. The patients in the asylum must have taken over the facility.CRAZY
1325134579250864129 2020-11-08 01:54:38 +0800 <Francis50441920> The atmosphere of the 1860 election might have been similar to this one.The ancestor of today's Demorats didn't steal the election,it might have been harder to do than it's today,so they rebelled against the Union.This fraud might not lead to civil war,but DT's people are MAD
1325121142026244097 2020-11-08 01:01:14 +0800 <Francis50441920> Where is AG Barr? Are his minions in DOJ, implementing the order of Justice Alito, and demanding to know from the seditious poll workers, where are the ballots which were to be set aside, as ordered by Justice Alito?

The computer system and its software must be studied and disassembled, and bring a GOP's IP expert to do the audit, otherwise everything would be for naught
1325110438393241601 2020-11-08 00:18:42 +0800 <Francis50441920> I believe it was RNC Chairwoman McDaniel who described the 'glitch' found in a MI county computer,which moved 6K Trump's votes to Biden,&amp; in 47 MI counties,the same software was used,&amp; then added that 30 innocent states had used d same glitchy software.

1325073318840561664 2020-11-07 21:51:12 +0800 <Francis50441920> After the evidence of illegal ballots being counted, software 'glitches' changing votes, observers denied observing the counting of votes, our airhead and babbling Speaker Pelosi, yesterday declared a demented-pedopervert-liar-plagiarist and corrupt politician, president elect.

Who in hell is going to identify the ballots once they are taken out of their envelopes and sent through the machines. How did Trump went from +600K to -25K ?
1324908549881913345 2020-11-07 10:56:28 +0800 <Francis50441920> Just now, Hannity received a report from the RNC Chairwoman in Michigan, that the 'glitchy' computer software used in Michigan, were also used in 30 other states.

The search for more rapid results, might also lead to more elections being stolen by corrupt programmers.

That's a conundrum

How many of the 70M who voted for Biden, pondered this scenario?

1324537542511861761 2020-11-06 10:22:13 +0800 <Francis50441920> @ModerateMerican @JoeBiden Just another stupid gaffe from a guy who would hold the launch code for our nuclear missiles? Either way, this guy is dangerous.

1324532184930242562 2020-11-06 10:00:56 +0800 <Francis50441920> @JoeBiden With your declaration &amp; confession that your Democrat crime family has installed the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of America, the only thing you deserve to win is a cell at Ft. Leavenworth, for TREASON.
1324527608353226752 2020-11-06 09:42:45 +0800 <Francis50441920> We've heard the refrain that this is the most important election in our history,&amp; many believe it's,but in a nation of 280M citizens who are able to exercise the sacred right to vote,only 140M have done so.Are these absent citizens unaware,or just don't care about the US?

1324493406085750785 2020-11-06 07:26:50 +0800 <Francis50441920> This quick comparison,might gives us a measure of the decline in the calibre of our electors.But, for generations our citizens have been subtly taught a venom of anti-Americanism in our schools &amp; universities,&amp; now is done in the open.We aren't the same nation of 6 decades ago.

1324465992685264899 2020-11-06 05:37:54 +0800 <Francis50441920> Has AG Barr, seen this confession Joe Biden did, to a group of Demorat partisans? Is fraudulently manipulating an election, while running for president, a seditious and treasonous act to the republic, and the constitution foundation upon which our republic rests?

1324432445673013251 2020-11-06 03:24:36 +0800 <Francis50441920> @navyCA139 Some thought that describing the DemoRats as members of a crime family was an hyperbole, but even that description is not sufficient to describe a more dangerous institution, which in effect, has placed this nation on the verge of a fratricidal war.

1324426285171544067 2020-11-06 03:00:07 +0800 <Francis50441920> It again reminds us of Justice Roberts admonishment of President Trump, when he said, Judges are not Republicans or Democrats, they are salomonic in their judgement and only follow our sacred Constitution and our Laws.

1324423913607147521 2020-11-06 02:50:42 +0800 <Francis50441920> What do these corrupt cities' electoral officials do w/ the envelopes which are signed on their exterior by the registered voters, and used to verify the legality of their origins? If none are found in the premises,the entire personnel in the edifice should be placed under arrest
1324422319180304385 2020-11-06 02:44:22 +0800 <Francis50441920> Recounts,are similar to closing d door of a barn after d mules have escaped.Once corrupt ballots are intermingled with legal ones,there's no way to trace their origins.

1324420565470449664 2020-11-06 02:37:24 +0800 <Francis50441920> The Judge should've sent a court official to Philadelphia, in order to read his decision to allow inspectors in,&amp; the consequence the corrupt electoral officials would face if they don't accept the order.Lawyers for Trump,w/order in hand,d criminals would wipe their asses with it

1324350834101149696 2020-11-05 22:00:18 +0800 <Francis50441920> When Lincoln was elected,the ancestors of our present day seditious DemoRats tried to destroyed the union,&amp; led to a civil war once they opened fire on Ft.

But as Reagan warned us, democratic values are not passed on via our genetics, as we're now witnessing
1324143795366187009 2020-11-05 08:17:36 +0800 <Francis50441920> @JoeBiden You poor fool, you still believe you are in charge of your crime family. You'll be removed via the XXV Amendment before you finish your first year in office, and by the same puppeteers who made you president, via this criminal coup.
1324140476086276096 2020-11-05 08:04:25 +0800 <Francis50441920> @realDonaldTrump Mr President, let's hope that the envelopes w/ signatures &amp; names of voters of the Mail-in-Ballots, were saved and not thrown out. Reviewing paper ballots without names or signatures would say nothing as to the crime committed. Envelopes w/o signatures should be a sign of fraud
1324087257318465540 2020-11-05 04:32:57 +0800 <Francis50441920> Many foresaw d possibility of a demented-corrupt-pedopervert-liar like Biden, getting 70M votes,even if he lost d election. Now we find ourselves confronted with d reality of Joe getting 70M votes &amp; few steps away from d WH,&amp; we must worry about d mental sanity of those electors
1324083140026130433 2020-11-05 04:16:35 +0800 <Francis50441920> @LibertaEst @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @TrumpWarRoom Strange, the last bundle found in WI, had 120K + ballots for Biden, 0 for Trump.
1324082615083847687 2020-11-05 04:14:30 +0800 <Francis50441920> The genteel DOJ rule, to not indict criminal politicians too close to an election, could cause a criminal briber the likes of Joe Biden, to be elected president, by crook or by hook, and all the dirt would be swept under the DOJ dirty rug, as well under the rug of a corrupt House
1324078951313059843 2020-11-05 03:59:56 +0800 <Francis50441920> The disaster of this electoral fraud, augurs a future of corrupt elections, but if demented Biden becomes president on January, the security of this nation via a vis communist China, would be in peril. I wonder what is the opinion of those 4 star generals who supported Biden?
1324078662568783873 2020-11-05 03:58:48 +0800 <Francis50441920> @george_vrable I agree, 100% !!
1324077496296448002 2020-11-05 03:54:09 +0800 <Francis50441920> Fox has already given WI to Biden. Instead of stop giving worthless predictions &amp; wait for the legal challenges that are arising,&amp; the Secretary of States of all the states certifying the election in 2 or 3 weeks, Fox went on a limb, and if it breaks, it would destroy Fox
1324073640208568322 2020-11-05 03:38:50 +0800 <Francis50441920> We have a real mess in our hands. This is the type of corruptela, which could lead a proud nation like ours to a civil war. But DemoRats, don't understand the gravity of them trying to steal an election, in this divided nation
1324071883977953280 2020-11-05 03:31:51 +0800 <Francis50441920> While our FBI, CIA, NSA &amp; other intelligence agencies kept their guards up,against any Russian intrusion into our electoral system,d greatest danger to our Republic is now found within our borders,d Socialist DemoRat Party of d US. Who would dare to call it, a seditious party?
1324069131730243591 2020-11-05 03:20:55 +0800 <Francis50441920> We have the GOP Swampers, already criticizing Trump for accusing the Demorats last night of producing the second coup attempt against Trump, in just 4 years. Those are the type of RINOs we have within our party.
1324066565411774464 2020-11-05 03:10:43 +0800 <Francis50441920> The same fraudulent voting procedure which discombobulated the election last night, was used in CA in 2018, and caused the lost of 5 Republican Representatives in that states. Late ballots were found in 2018, which caused the same magical trick we witnessed last night.
1324065101184442371 2020-11-05 03:04:54 +0800 <Francis50441920> The 4:4 SCOTUS decision, which allowed states without a new law,to rewrite the voting procedures &amp; dates upon which votes had to be in to count,all on the basis of a COVID emergency,has ushered this constitutional crisis upon which this nation finds itself at this critical moment
1324062871236521988 2020-11-05 02:56:03 +0800 <Francis50441920> @george_vrable The disaster of this electoral fraud, augurs a future of corrupt elections, but if demented Biden becomes president on January, the security of this nation via a vis communist China, would be in peril.

1324048462250496008 2020-11-05 01:58:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> When asked a few months ago, about the dangers Mail-in-Ballots represented to our electoral system integrity, FBI Director Wray dismissed the idea. The main danger we would face by November 3rd, would be Russian intrusion into our election. And the guy keeps on trucking !

1324038000737689600 2020-11-05 01:17:13 +0800 <Francis50441920> This Florida example,reveals that the Mail-in-Ballots used by Blue states,&amp; which produced this crisis,was a well plan voter-fraud-scheme prepared by the Demorat crime family, in order to steal the election from DT. Other excuses the Demorats might give us,know that they're b**ng

1324027400196362242 2020-11-05 00:35:06 +0800 <Francis50441920> WHO? Those who know that our two tier Justice System, would do nothing to monitor them, imprisoned them when caught infraganti, or sent them to prison for 30 years of hard labor. So, they take their chances, in order to obtain total power.
1324024464108146695 2020-11-05 00:23:26 +0800 <Francis50441920> Who in their right mind, would, for the purpose of helping a demented-corrupt-pedopervert-racist-liar-plagiarist, expose themselves to being sent to prison by committing voter fraud, in order to elect that SOB to the presidency?
1324016730922995713 2020-11-04 23:52:42 +0800 <Francis50441920> What this second coup attempt might bring about, is to start a slow fire on a concoction pot, that in many cases lead to fratricidal wars, when one side breaks all the rules of the game &amp; then expect the other side of a fraternal contract, to remain quiet and composed.
1324010159094534149 2020-11-04 23:26:35 +0800 <Francis50441920> When the Founders delegated our semi-sovereign States the responsibility to conduct state &amp; national election,their vision must have been that our state leaders would always be people of great ethical &amp; moral standards. At this moment,our Founders must be turning in their graves
1324005194003369987 2020-11-04 23:06:51 +0800 <Francis50441920> @RedWingGrips Trump foresaw this non-rosy scenario, and many idiots laughed at his idiotic prediction. And here we are !!
1324002921386807301 2020-11-04 22:57:49 +0800 <Francis50441920> In 1860, Demorats lost d election,but today's machinery of voter fraud to which Biden alluded to, wasn't in place. By 1861 Demorats declared a kinetic war on d US fearing slavery would soon end. Today,d declaration of war by Demorats was done via a massive voter fraud machinery.
1323999722546335744 2020-11-04 22:45:07 +0800 <Francis50441920> As d FBI held its gaze towards Russia,assured Putin would steal d '20 election,as he did on '16,in d interim,d Socialist DemoRat Party of d US,AKA DemoRat Crime Family, prepared &amp; yesterday launched d greatest voter fraud attack on our Republic.And now we're in uncharted waters
1323992539419025409 2020-11-04 22:16:34 +0800 <Francis50441920> @3GoMigos Right now,demented-pervert &amp; corrupt political hack Joe Biden has almost 70M votes in his 'bag', &amp; the pundits tell us how well he has done vs.Trump. And half the nation is euphoric about the results, &amp; telling us there was not even smidgen of voter fraud,in their Pyrrhic victory
1323989238799618050 2020-11-04 22:03:27 +0800 <Francis50441920> The scale of the voter fraud which the nation is now witnessing,&amp; proudly announced by demented Joe Biden himself, might mean that the Demorat Crime Family,finally declared an all out war on the republic &amp; its constitution, &amp; this time the yoke of slavery won't be based on race
1323985411354578946 2020-11-04 21:48:15 +0800 <Francis50441920> Atlanta is still counting,Philadelphia,Pittsburgh,Detroit, Milwaukee,&amp; the late ballots are counted,or are being prepared so that Biden eventually wins the election,&amp; the Demorats' shock troops are ready to burn the place down if the fraud isn't accepted by the rest of the nation
1323982259402268672 2020-11-04 21:35:43 +0800 <Francis50441920> How a man, rapidly coasting towards dementia like Joe Biden, received closed to 70M votes, and 'leads' president Trump by 2M votes, might only confirms what Biden told us, "We have prepared the most inclusive voter fraud machinery mankind has ever seen",or words to that effect.

A Youtube video by 2 CA doctors was removed,because they attested to the pressure to which they were submitted in their hospital,to place non-COVID deaths,&amp; patients,under the COVID statistics,for no other reason than the hospital getting higher payments

1323727513684770824 2020-11-04 04:43:27 +0800 <Francis50441920> @USSANews Biden told us that he wants to bring honor and respect to the presidency.

1323723812152684548 2020-11-04 04:28:45 +0800 <Francis50441920> This was reported by OAN, none of the other MSM outlets has given any preponderance to this news from the CDC, thus showing, that besides being a Corona-type flu, as the low death count shows, COVID was, and is still being used as a political weapon against President Trump.
1323722259308097536 2020-11-04 04:22:34 +0800 <Francis50441920> CDC after months of reporting COVID deaths,rectified itself to tell us that of the 220K deaths being reported at this moment,only 6% were solely caused by COVID, or 14K. The fact that greater remuneration were given to treat COVID patients, CDC added,might have led to the errorüòé

1323662173688762377 2020-11-04 00:23:49 +0800 <Francis50441920> @Acosta If you had been a reporter in Castro's Cuba, and you had been as insolent and disrespectful to Castro as you have been to President Trump, your credentials would not have been suspended, you would have been sent to a cell in the Cuban gulag, or would have faced a firing squad.

1319717717549744132 2020-10-24 03:09:57 +0800 <Francis50441920> Biden tried to fix American foreign policy, to fit his avarice for money.Why would a sitting VP,chose an unknown Ukrainian prosecutor to be removed from office,when there are 198 countries in the world, and many are as corrupt, or more corrupt than Ukraine? Are we that stupid?
1319717172260855814 2020-10-24 03:07:47 +0800 <Francis50441920> Fox News keeps pushing the polls, and especially the one never-Trumper Chris Stirewalt prepares for the big bosses at Fox. All polls are showing the election is a little tighter, but that demented-corrupt-pedo-pervert VP Joe Biden, is still leading Trump by 9% +/-.

1317087562100559873 2020-10-16 20:58:39 +0800 <Francis50441920> When Hunter refers to femme Biden, 'as her salary', indirectly he is telling her that the millions he's receiving as bribery from Ukraine, China and Russia oligarchs, are salary payments for legal jobs he has rendered.

Lenin was a murderous thug, but at that time he witnessed how our own capitalists were trying to help his bloody revolution.
1309118738067853318 2020-09-24 21:13:24 +0800 <Francis50441920> As our factories were dismantled &amp; sent to China, by our traitorous capitalists, seeking greater profits, our workers saw their lives destroyed, but were told this is the way free markets worked. Clinton, Bush &amp; Obama didn't give a hoot,it took a billionaire businessman to care.

Once Trump wins, Chris Stirewalt would announce his polls were correct, but the electorate turned in favor of Trump, on November 1st.

Biden is saying the same thing
1305847130993688576 2020-09-15 20:33:12 +0800 <Francis50441920> When incompetent Kamala, referred to the upcoming "Harris administration", her Freudian slip reveals the fact that the crime family is already preparing the transition a few months after Biden becomes president.

That's a poorer country solution to Climate Change.

1304429894999388161 2020-09-11 22:41:36 +0800 <Francis50441920> @DonaldJTrumpJr Ducklo surname really fits this guy. If he had ducked any lower, only his voice would have been heard in that Baier interview.

Dr. Fauci recommended a 15 day lockdown, and he did it, came back and requested another month, Trump fell from his chair, stood up cleaned his tie,&amp; told Fauci, "Let it be written, let it be done'', but our Fake News SOBs tell us Trump downplayed the virus gravity

1304188309883760647 2020-09-11 06:41:38 +0800 <Francis50441920> And even if Joe loses in November, he probably would still receive the vote of confidence of 60M+ American electors.
1304187637964697601 2020-09-11 06:38:58 +0800 <Francis50441920> By 2016, with all the baggage Hillary was carrying, even before she became SOS, she should have lost by 20M votes. By 2016, she had Benghazi, the Server, Reset Button, Crimea Annexed, Ukraine invaded, the Libya disaster, Uranium 1 &amp; she still got 65M votes. We're in deep trouble

1304161372561960962 2020-09-11 04:54:36 +0800 <Francis50441920> @BobRmhenry1 Years ago, ISIS called upon its operatives moles in the west, to set fires on our forests, as part of a Jihad War by other means.

If an enemy had designed our school system, the People would have demanded that Congress declares war on the country which designed it. How did Crooked Hillary received 65M votes?

1304150307740549124 2020-09-11 04:10:37 +0800 <Francis50441920> DT administration announced last Friday that it was cracking down on ‚Äúcritical race theory,‚Äù a far-left anti-American ideology that promotes racial division,from being taught in federal agencies &amp; paid w/ federal money.

1304137134132146176 2020-09-11 03:18:17 +0800 <Francis50441920> A world where news travel at d speed of light,&amp; d entire world is aware that BLM calls d US irredeemably racist, 22M illegals live in d US, 1.1M legal immigrants enter every yr, tens of millions await their turn,a Wall is built to stop d avalanche,but 50% of us believe d BLM, BS?
1304133039258206208 2020-09-11 03:02:00 +0800 <Francis50441920> So w/all d manipulation of COVID infections &amp; death statistics,CDC declaring d common flu ended on 4/4, d USCVS telling doctors how to fill out Death Certificates, &amp; now telling us only 9K Americans died from COVID, but in 1 year the common flu killed 80K+, &amp; nobody panic.Why?

1304128272649850880 2020-09-11 02:43:04 +0800 <Francis50441920> By March's interview w/Woodward,DT had closed our borders to China&amp;Europe,ordered a quarantine as per d medical team's advice,had mobilized industry to produce PPE &amp; ventilators,ordered d quick production of a vaccine,&amp; due to his no panic advice,we didn't know it was a crisis?

1304124255832072196 2020-09-11 02:27:06 +0800 <Francis50441920> By that time a quarantine was issued,borders to China were closed because of the seriousness of the virus,&amp; people thought it caused diarrhea,because it was hard to find toilet paper in our grocery stores.

1304122698570895360 2020-09-11 02:20:55 +0800 <Francis50441920> Last night, on the Laura Ingraham Show, she showed a video of Trump, about the time of his March meetings with Woodward,telling the reporters that he didn't want to create a COVID panic among the American people, thus proving that what he told us was what he told W.
1304119732782739456 2020-09-11 02:09:08 +0800 <Francis50441920> While following all medical &amp; scientific advice, even closing the borders to China &amp; Europe against their advice, Trump by telling the American people,"The only thing to fear is fear itself", he's a traitor to the real traitors who launched a seditious coup against the president?

1304054863098269696 2020-09-10 21:51:22 +0800 <Francis50441920> Before November 3, eighty million unrequested ballots would be sent to registered electors,in states using Mail-in-Ballots for voting.With all d anecdotal evidence showing d corruption inherit in that system,we still go forward to elect a president,knowing possibility of fraud.
1304052645322252289 2020-09-10 21:42:33 +0800 <Francis50441920> To many Americans,not versed in Constitutional Law,it might sound logical that states are in charge of conducting state,county &amp; municipal elections,however corrupt the system they use.But why,presidential elections, have to be conducted under any of the states corrupt practices?
1304049123906260993 2020-09-10 21:28:33 +0800 <Francis50441920> @RealJamesWoods So Twitter, a so called American company, checked German Laws to ascertain if an American, e.g. James Wood, had broken any of those laws, in order to suspend Mr. Wood if he had? What about communist China's Laws?

One has to wonder if d weather angle,is used by El-Hussein to cover up this jihad. Hot weather doesn't cause fires. A Traitor who prepared &amp; launched a coup against DT,should be in prison
1303883030197665792 2020-09-10 10:28:34 +0800 <Francis50441920> @Bubblebathgirl When ISIS sent a comunique to its troops, to use forest fires as a Jihad weapon, which has already killed many Americans, one has to wonder if that is the angle El-Hussein wants to cover up.
