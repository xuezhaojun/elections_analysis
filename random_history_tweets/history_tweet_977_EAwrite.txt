Azar told Trump who chose to focus only on the “we’ve got this” NOT “maybe problem”. Woodward tapes show Trump KNEW how bad it was yet still lied.

1343684569128521728 2020-12-29 06:25:40 +0800 <EAwrite> 2/ Trump was always a science denier (climate etc). He cared about market, re-election and $. His appointees:   Azar had big pharma business background (tripled? Insulin prices back then).  Redfield (and similar Birx) had weird background (pushed for abstinence as HIV solution!)

Correct me but as Flynn plead guilty to Federal crime (lying to FBI), pardon is done and within executive power. His record, consequences of conviction remain. By wording, you mean if it’ll include anything related to T? I thought third party not allowed in pardon.
1331738904295141378 2020-11-26 07:17:51 +0800 <EAwrite> @topherendress I thought it best to move this out of someone else’s TL. Latino, Latina or Hispanic are the most used and truly only acceptable non political references.  The only time to use X is in political, progressive context. I could go further but I hope this helps.

Never used X. Neither do most. As pointed out, some (Mexican Hispanos) (younger?) use @.   There is a reason related to immigrants vs generations post immigration further removed.

1331723443121786880 2020-11-26 06:16:25 +0800 <EAwrite> @ChocVader @AdamSerwer Not exactly. The distinction is that while I concede that it is their reflection, it’s more sinister. It’s one thing to say racist in questioning his birth BS. It’s more insidious and ugly than that. It wasn’t that they saw themselves in TVirus. It’s worse.

America has SERIOUS problems that have been allowed to fester.   This happens historically. This did NOT happen overnight. Trump is not the root of America’s problems. He just weaponized it.

1323978269490753538 2020-11-04 21:19:52 +0800 <EAwrite> That is the question but it has been for some time.   Yes the hope for a landslide was there. That was the best case.
