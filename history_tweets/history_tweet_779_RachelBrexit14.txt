1344055656551227398 2020-12-30 07:00:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Just noticed, you say their own immune system attacks their organs, isn't this what happens with HIV/aids and I believe the vaccines contain HIV proteins??
1344055175405854721 2020-12-30 06:58:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Yes and when this happens to lots of people they will call it a new super strain and lock us all up again üò°üò°
1344054810832740353 2020-12-30 06:56:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Would love to know how many people went into hospital for all other non covid illnesses and due to a false positive test found themselves on a  so called covid ward where they caught flu on top of the illness they are being treated for????
1344054193032609792 2020-12-30 06:54:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @MrsSMHI Yes. I wonder how many people on 'covid wards' are actually just being treated for covid. Not many I expect.
1344052514078007297 2020-12-30 06:47:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Yes I have heard about this. Apparently this is why coronavirus vaccines never work, once the vaccinated cats got infected with coronavirus they would die of this condition. Immune response to flu is massive,  cannot be replicated in a vaccine,  the vaccine reduces it.

1344045653773725698 2020-12-30 06:20:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> When you are expected to lose your business,  your home , your cancer care and even your children's education for a virus that kills no more people than flu does, then you better ask questions when people tell you this suffering is your responsibility.

1344043417408516101 2020-12-30 06:11:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> How are they finding this? They tell us the only difference between old and new variant is 'possible ' transmission rate, so which test is showing this difference.  Not PCR, not lateral flow,  no difference in symptoms,  so how are they finding this from routine testing????

1340644465543950336 2020-12-20 21:05:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So does anyone know what the real purpose of  nightingale hospitals is?

1340064119198797826 2020-12-19 06:39:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So medical staff tested get positive result retested to eliminate false positives.

To think a cotton mask is going to stop a virus,  much more tiny than the mask fibres, is bonkers.  Also sucking in your own bacteria causes bacterial infection

1335864102233763840 2020-12-07 16:29:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon So you haven't had covid on last 6 months, hence the negative tests. So what does that prove about it being useful??
1335863889767133185 2020-12-07 16:29:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon It's perfectly true when your test is a piece of rubbish that doesn't differentiate between current and past infection!! Its laughable as a test, absolutely criminal.

1335862445420720129 2020-12-07 16:23:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Ant_Ware @alexlondon It is not an allergic reaction to have symptoms,  it is because you are not immune.  If you have no symptoms you are immune.  If you are immune you can't spread anything,  how else do you think vaccines work.
1335721409461547009 2020-12-07 07:02:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Not true. This is now a casedemic.  The PCR test used in this way is criminal and I for one look forward to the upcoming court cases.
1335720681313607683 2020-12-07 07:00:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Covid will never go away unless we stop using the totally rubbish PCR test and telling healthy people they are sick and people dying of cancer or strokes they are now covid deaths.
1335720301108269064 2020-12-07 06:58:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon My source is the WHO and many scientists I have listened to talking on the subject.  I put those opinions above Twitter people.
1335719676345724929 2020-12-07 06:56:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon New trials after concluding trials as set out are tweaks on the original phase aim. Oxford vaccine currently going through a new trial at phase 3 because they had to ask another question to get specific absent data
1335719143954292737 2020-12-07 06:53:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Absolutely rubbish!!!! Asymptomatic throughout is immune! Asymptomatic as a phase before developing symptoms is a tiny window of just hours.
1335718544865169408 2020-12-07 06:51:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Which Doctors is that then, thousands are saying we don't need a vaccine. Many scientists saying in these circumstances it's positively dangerous.  Can we at least agree that there is no exact science,  this vaccine is a grey area.
1335718121550778368 2020-12-07 06:49:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon That is absolutely untrue, some people only get sick for  day or two and then it's gone! Some people don't get sick atall as they are immune already.
1335717703500357635 2020-12-07 06:48:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon If they are going to develop symptoms,  the window between infection and symptomatic transmission is tiny. The way you are talking we should all be walking round in hazmat suits as a matter of normality.  Bonkers.
1335717098333630464 2020-12-07 06:45:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon You think that people with no symptoms atall are infecting people. That's bonkers. If the pathogens are met with immunity they cannot multiply and can't make someone ill and can't be spread.
1335716205232058370 2020-12-07 06:42:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Not true, it is impossible to be infectious when you are symptomless.  Many scientists saying this and even WHO.
1335715542712332292 2020-12-07 06:39:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Do you not realise that vaccines are normally trialled for 7-10 years...they normally get tweaked and retrialled as a matter of course.
1335715172829323269 2020-12-07 06:38:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon You can't have a virus present,  display no symptoms,  unless you are immune!!!
1335712672860528644 2020-12-07 06:28:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I have had every childhood vaccine offered and have no regrets about it, I am not anti vax, but I will not have this vaccine.
1335711988270379012 2020-12-07 06:25:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Something we can agree on, immune people,  commonly called asymptomatic,  don't spread.
1335711393866276872 2020-12-07 06:23:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon So on what grounds do you think fit and well people spread the virus, if as you rightly say, if immune system response is quick there are no pathogens  .
1335710911043162114 2020-12-07 06:21:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Pheizer can't say much about this vaccine as known fact as it hasn't been trialled long enough or diverse enough. I am happy to take properly trialled and tested vaccines,  over several years, for illnesses that could kill me. This covid vaccine doesn't qualify  in either.

Flu has existed forever.  Our bodies have inherited response, T Cell response and antibody response, within a healthy person all of that works better than a flu jab. NOT anti vax so don't go there.
1335709170729963521 2020-12-07 06:14:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon I am risking no ones life by being healthy,  healthy people don't make anyone sick. If I got sick I would stay at home. This vaccine right now does not stop transmission,  that is a fact much talked about on various radio channels I have listened to. Pheizer say it.
1335706186927190020 2020-12-07 06:02:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon I am sorry you struggle with your health, but your position is not made better by healthy people getting vaccines that lower what would have been their natural immune response while also not stopping transmission.
1335705796735340545 2020-12-07 06:00:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Sorry but you are sounding increasingly disturbed now. You actually think people with healthy immune systems should get vaccines that provide them with a less good immune response and doesn't even stop transmission??? And that makes for a safer environment???

Yes there are some tragic younger deaths but unfortunately you get that with flu. To blame people for causing these deaths is not fair, I never see anyone failing to follow guidance and many millions unemployed

1334563792747958273 2020-12-04 02:22:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I would say that means it does, as claimed to be a possibility by Yeadon.
1334563556445085696 2020-12-04 02:22:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CromwellStuff @MattHancock Probably because it risks miscarriage due to diminishing a chemical needed for placenta formation (Yeadon).
1334563071369629699 2020-12-04 02:20:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Could this all be deliberate,  a bit of UK verses EU as a sort of vaccine PR gambit for brexiteers???

1334557938271318016 2020-12-04 01:59:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It shouldn't be given to women of reproductive age then surely?? It's all to do with the  chemical needed to create a placenta in pregnancy.
1334557573505298432 2020-12-04 01:58:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @sar247365 @ChristianHay8 @jenninemorgan @RichieAllenShow Yes, he says previously in the development of coronavirus vaccines there was evidence that a chemical women need to form a placenta in pregnancy was diminished.
1334557206679859200 2020-12-04 01:56:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Yeadon states that previously coronavirus vaccines had a side effect of attacking the chemical in women needed to create a placenta in pregnancy.

That doesn't mean I should be forced to live in fear or alter my immune system with a genetic vaccine. When people get sick we care for them  best we can.  But all life leads to death.
1334554227503460355 2020-12-04 01:44:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG As you well know this vaccine is incredibly different to all other vaccines which were trialled over several years, some many more. Also coronavirus vaccines are particularly problematic due to the massive immune response which is necessary.  First ever vaccine with gene virus...

Positive cases like wise are highly suspect for that reason.
1334277536801546240 2020-12-03 07:25:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Fauci is a liar that is why he now promotes masks. You can find his study on Spanish flu on youtube. They were homemade masks, sound familiar .

It's really that simple. If I,unvaccinated,  transmit covid then people with a vaccine are protected from me. Only over 60s get flu jab, it works despite vast majority not

Always has always will. Flu has always had occasional life changing effects on some people's lives. Why aren't we accepting of that anymore?

Fauci did a study in 2016.

If I was a SAGE scientist and this ex colleague was saying what I knew to be very wrong I wouldn't hesitate to bring his theories down. Despite his challenges they never do.

You get secondary ripples in isolated regions but that's it. Vallance was taught that as are all scientists. As for criticising graphs, I haven't seen a single govnt scientist graph that came true.

Life is about balance of risk, if your risk is high you mitigate it, if it isn't you just get on with due caution. What's changed.
1334232630313840641 2020-12-03 04:27:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG I am sorry for what has happened to you personally,  flu is a terrible illness that can kill the very old and occasionally make previously fit and well very ill too. But that is a risk we have all taken all our lives, why are we not allowed to balance that risk anymore?

Oxford apparently saying they will quickly trial the new dosage on the 55s up and it shouldn't affect the drug being ready by April as they had said originally.

1328099677150081025 2020-11-16 06:16:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I want my freedom back, they are using a flu virus to lock us all up and dangle the key before us but always just out of reach.  This was all planned wasn't it.
1328097620028497920 2020-11-16 06:08:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I think a lot of Tory voters are feeling rightly annoyed that they voted Tory and got Caroline Lucas!

1328090207183384576 2020-11-16 05:39:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamessReality @JOHjohJOH12 Because they want to "prove" you can get it twice....which of course you can't when T Cells memory lasts decades. But no doubt he will become unwell to ramp up the fear and get people to take the vaccine that we don't need. Don't trust anything anymore.
1328089611906723840 2020-11-16 05:36:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @F_Fuxake @JOHjohJOH12 So sorry to hear this. My son is 16 and has started having really bad dreams where he is out of control,  he has never had these sorts of worries.  We are damaging our children needlessly.  So angry now.

1327915062439403520 2020-11-15 18:03:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Will you change your mind atall when , as in Denmark,  the vaccine that most people don't need becomes compulsory?
1327912064384372736 2020-11-15 17:51:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The fascists are calling anyone who doubts the safety of a rushed vaccine anti vaxers! They want to shut down these people's voices
1327906932288606208 2020-11-15 17:30:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Everywhere in media there is a push to dismiss those that don't want a rushed vaccine as anti vax nutters, and a need to purge their voice from all media,  isn't that called fascism!

1327249659962814466 2020-11-13 21:59:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 I agree.  There is no way this vaccine will improve people's health, with an already 99.6% survival rate. It may however have devastating and irreversible effects on immune response. I don't trust any of them , they are all proven liars.

As for  trials ,  just  couple of thousand people had it just a couple of months ago, how does that tell you ANYTHING about the long term effects and even the shorter term effects  This is why vaccines are tested over 7-10 yrs.
1326636519159963648 2020-11-12 05:22:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Frankly just a cursory look on the WEF website is enough to give a person chills, the correlation between their simulation video and current workd events is jaw dropping  . Was released 6 months BEFORE covid.

1326602323527954435 2020-11-12 03:06:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They want to monitor our adverse reactions to the vaccine in the interests of data, and need new software to cope with what they predict to be a huge amount of adverse vaccine reactions....

1325918351453982720 2020-11-10 05:49:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Already they are saying there is no evidence yet that the vaccine stops transmission.  Why take it then?
1325917953250963464 2020-11-10 05:47:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> A vaccine that we are told is amazing,  has a 90% chance of stopping a virus that you have 99.4% chance of surviving.  Still want to risk it?
1325917450941173760 2020-11-10 05:45:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Anyone know how this test works and its reliability,  we all know PCR is dodgy as hell .

Funny how Boris in his speech earlier stated a number for how many are receiving ventilation and then quickly corrected it to, in ventilator beds!!! Nurses are saying a lot of covid patients are on ventilator beds and not hooked up to ventilator!
1324370377989042176 2020-11-05 23:17:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ChristineEasda1 I wonder if Boris's near death experience was a warning shot that he is all too aware of? Is he following the 'plan' to save us all from covid20, far more deadly? So many questions...
1324369670959439880 2020-11-05 23:15:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If Trump is forced out by corrupt ballots, as it seems will be the case, we all better be worried.  The US is leader of the free world, if they fall in this manner, then all western democracy will follow.
1324368557271142402 2020-11-05 23:10:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Telegraph Sure, let's not stop more deaths say the government.

But I don't believe for a second that useless campaign got the highest turnout of votes ever recorded in swing states. Maybe the huge over reaction to covid,  record mail in votes(easily corruptible), was all about this moment.

1323759551401857024 2020-11-04 06:50:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey We are not experiencing many increased non covid deaths because hospitals are over run, most hospitals have been mostly empty most months since March. It is because covid policy has created covidNHS!! Apparently no other death matters to the NHS.

1323749910760558592 2020-11-04 06:12:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Most hospitals everywhere have killed people through not diagnosing,  not testing, cancelling operations. Preventable deaths from cancer, heart disease, strokes etc are right up and climbing. They will eventually far, far exceed covid deaths.

Firstly so how can there possibly be a pandemic . Secondly where are all the sick that SHOULD be in ICU, home deaths are up up!!

A virus is NEVER infectious when a person has zero symptoms and develops zero symptoms. If we shut down because some well people MAY become I'll then we will be destroyed.  Do you not care about the other 94% of deaths

1323701206779387906 2020-11-04 02:58:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey I don't have it wrong. It is almost impossible for a fit and well person to have enough viral load to infect anyone. I have listened to many scientists explain this and this also makes perfect logical sense.
1323693128419807232 2020-11-04 02:26:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey I disagree,  most scientists disagree but they are no platformerd by the media and government. If someone is positive asymptomatic,  they are immune and have no capacity to be infectious.  The PCR test picks up dead RNA and presents as positive.

1322657792663183369 2020-11-01 05:52:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It really is ironic isn't it....close the economy to protect the NHS....you know that same economy that pays for the NHS!!
1322654264561442824 2020-11-01 05:38:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Masks are bad for us in so many ways
1322653472844644357 2020-11-01 05:35:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PrimalPolitical @BW400CN Difference is we know,or rather oncologists know roughly how many people every year, doesn't vary much, get Cancer diagnosis.  From that we can compare and project reliably.
1322652891233091586 2020-11-01 05:33:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Is this going to be our way out of this nightmare,  a Chancellor that actually cares about the economy?
1322652133506908171 2020-11-01 05:30:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Because it isnt a vaccine,  it's something else, something that is incredibly important in order to control millions of people.
1322651071966253063 2020-11-01 05:26:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Gets forgotten,  particularly by journalists who get to ask questions....
1322648627450466304 2020-11-01 05:16:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @10DowningStreet questions, why do you calculate false positives by deducting them from those that test positive and not from total tested as you should? Why do you treat 'cases' as  sick people when 80% of those tested aren't sick or needing covid treatment? I look forward to the courts.
1322640941132533761 2020-11-01 04:45:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Billions of pounds spent on an institution that is supposed to protect us, now asks us to stay away as its nurses need tik tok time..

1322610592679645185 2020-11-01 02:45:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @EmilyThornberry What like Germany's track and trace!!! Laughable,  no track and trace works  anywhere...you are setting unachievable parameters....but if course you know that!
1322608768933367808 2020-11-01 02:37:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Basically it looks like another lockdown,  essentially we will be subject to the draconian life the Nazis failed to achieve in the 1940s, locked in our bubbles, policed by the Gestapo and castigated by our own youth! Then it was fear of death now it is fear of a virus. üò°üò°

1322589226639253504 2020-11-01 01:20:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I like that advice, live in your mind. I think I will try to do that more!!!
1322588872509956098 2020-11-01 01:18:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I wish the truth to come out,  I can't stand the lies and the fear being generated over numbers which are not even gathered by a reliable test. We are crushing a grape with a sledgehammer.
1322587459557957636 2020-11-01 01:13:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @berniespofforth @LarraineWright1 Yes that would be a bit extra in the pot for the beloved NHS, which incidentally doesn't protect our health anymore but rather we have to clap for it as the ruthless messiah it has become.
1322586656063574017 2020-11-01 01:10:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @markinneswilli @EssexPR Schools won't generate taxes to pay for the life you are used to. It's game over if we kick the economy again. As for the NHS its game over for that too, what are we going to use to pay for our health service.
1322585853521219584 2020-11-01 01:06:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I have social distanced through this entire scam, and masks when necessary.  People can do what they are asked to do and still be very angry. The test is rubbish, the lockdown is criminal and the control through fear is diabolical.
1322585052153368576 2020-11-01 01:03:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mikelovestweets That is a very callous response.  Many businesses will go under, people losing everything they have including their homes but hey successful business is successful business!
1322584334507888640 2020-11-01 01:00:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I can tell by your last words you really care. I just wish the many scientists who condemn this advice and dodgy testing were allowed a voice on the TV. I can't stand the no platforming that is going on.
1322583321206022146 2020-11-01 00:56:50 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gina2353 @HHepplewhite There are many reasons the government advisors and scientists would deceive us!!! So you actually believe the PCR is accurate and do called cases are sick people??? I am stunned. I loved Boris but unless he stops a national lockdown with these dodgy figures I am out
1322578676765069312 2020-11-01 00:38:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Reprobate24 I am yes. Starmer would have been even worse and even more draconian,  but still, what happened to the Tories?

1322514842796830725 2020-10-31 20:24:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 It is a dirty rag within 20 mins of putting on unless it is medical grade. It suppresses the immune system, it can even cause retro viruses,   viruses you had and conquered coming back to life. Don't believe me fine. But after listening to many scientists talk I want fresh air.

So why are you NOW happy to shut down the western world, end the NHS that saved your life (no money), just to be righteous?

The first makes little difference to numbers the second destroys 'case'numbers.

1322505057930272768 2020-10-31 19:45:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AeHcat It seems like they don't even care what people think and aren't even fighting to win like Trump is. I fear they have a plan to steal the election and bring down the free world, I know that sounds crazy but they seem convinced they will win despite the obvious lack of support üòï

1322457427229507584 2020-10-31 16:36:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> When he nearly died was that a warning shot that he must take our country down a planned route of destruction.  He certainly came out of hospital a completely different person .

Added to that bacteria very quickly collects in the moist warm mask, you are inhaling that bacteria   some people for hours. Eventually the immune system cannot cope and you get bacterial lung infections

1321509826057379841 2020-10-29 01:51:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> These scientists are looking like idiots now, but still they stick to the narrative
1321508159173890048 2020-10-29 01:44:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @oflynnsocial There is no evidence atall that these hospital case numbers are people who are even Ill or in hospital because of covid symptoms! Much evidence to suggest that most went in hospital with another illness and then got tested and BECAME a covid patient despite not being ill with it
1321507446121205764 2020-10-29 01:41:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Thousands of scientists from the best universities in the world are being ignored and Doctors are being effectively told to ignore everything they learned about viruses and how to best save lives...something is VERY BADLY WRONG!

If we did this the figures would fall through the floor.

1317899096439607296 2020-10-19 02:43:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries I suppose it would if you continue with the statedy of counting ALL DEATHS as covid deaths if had a +pcr test within 28 days of dying!!! It isn't difficult,  if a person dies of something other than symptomatic  covid then they are NOT a covid death. So simple yet NOT happening!

1317784709611606016 2020-10-18 19:08:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @KirstieMAllsopp And all because of a virus with the death rate of 0.05% (WHO FIGURE), that kills people on average aged 82.5yrs, older than average age of death.

1317035622742282241 2020-10-16 17:32:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> People stop telling me we need a lockdown because it saves lives!!! It also ends many other lives. It ends careers, companies,  investments,  jobs, marriages.  Even WHO now saying this cure is worse than the illness! This is insanity. Please people go on the ONS do your own study

1317022451591688192 2020-10-16 16:39:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PaulaBrexiteer On one hand it is bad because it is an effort, like Starmer in parliament,  to force a national lockdown.

They just tested positive but aren't ill with covid, most likely old RNA. People could test positive forever with PCR!

There could be many asymptomatic positives who are in hospital for other treatments/illnesses.

1315781389632122886 2020-10-13 06:28:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @6631andrew @ClarkeMicah YES!!! Easy to say you are at full capacity if you only 'allocate' 8 beds for covid19 patients!

1315780565841448961 2020-10-13 06:25:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So if you are in a 'ventilator bed' but  not on a ventilator you are counted as a ventilator patient!

1315778696926629891 2020-10-13 06:17:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @itvnews Are they the covid allocated beds, 8, or the other 670 beds left?
1315778379279462405 2020-10-13 06:16:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So how many other hospitals claiming ICU at full capacity or near to it, are merely referring to their allocated beds for covid19 being full??? What a scam...

Also CDC now admit masks promote sickness,  80% of current cases are people who regularly wear masks. Pcr test is a sham. Cases are not sick people.

We need to protect those that need/want protecting and get out there and live with this virus that has the same death rate now as flu!

Once patient tests positive,  whatever they are in hospital for, they become a covid patient statistic. It's absolutely criminal.

PHE just confirmed flu and covid figures are to be conflated. Hospital figures are massaged by testing for asymptomatic positives amongst people who are there for other medical reasons. We all know PCR provides lots of false positives.

1313964470297858049 2020-10-08 06:08:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So, who has,a life that matters to western governments? People over 80 with serious morbidity?  Or people dying of cancer, heart disease, stroke, basically all the major diseases that kill most of us before our time if not treated . Why do the majority no longer count?
1313961584180572160 2020-10-08 05:57:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DailyMailUK Why close down pubs and restaurants,  the highest rates of serious incidence are old people's homes and hospitals. Why not just tell the nation the truth, who and how this virus worse affects. This is insane.

1312510567433658368 2020-10-04 05:51:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean @NadineDorries Yes, I believe pleurisy is on the rise aswell.

1312165061071233025 2020-10-03 06:58:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why are we still allowing R rate to dictate covid19 policy? This made sense back in spring because the infection rate closely related to death rate. Now infection is 300% higher than death rate. If we just tested the sick, as before it would fall and match death rate.

1312003686332276736 2020-10-02 20:17:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DeanBaileynorth Barnier gave it to Boris,  probably deliberately.  As for trump the PCR can provide a positive to most people if it goes through enough revolutions.

If someone is terminal and dying as stated by 2 doctors and months of failed treatment and sad scans, and suffering terribly, and wishes for it to end peacefully,  that is not murder.
1311947161161142272 2020-10-02 16:32:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Rjn552 Yes and what are the chances of Trump, a 74 yr old, testing asymptomatic positive at this point in the debates scheduled?? As Kary Mullis,  inventor of PCR stated,  if you want a positive you can find it!!
1311946456044113920 2020-10-02 16:29:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MHKiwi @WestminsterWAG @POTUS @JoeBiden They were both tested prior to the debate as was everyone present. Trump said this during the debate when asked about masks, no one there denied that was true.

1311944384779255808 2020-10-02 16:21:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So what are the chances of Trump having received a positive covid19 test while having no symptoms atall, just at the time the Democrats are desperate to stop any future  live debates since Trump smashed Biden at the first one!!!????ü§î

My son's school and also my nephews school nearby have both been shut down due to a handful of asymptomatic false positives.  Now Hancock in talks in Liverpool to increase restrictions to merseyside due to school closures!!

They ridicule the use of PCR with an infectious virus .

The crux of the situation is hospital admissions and deaths from community not nursing homes. Nursing homes are a separate situation as they are separated from the community.

1309983118477099008 2020-09-27 06:28:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Or live virus,  that's the connection. Low transmission of live virus leads to low,junk viral DNA also

PCR magnifies everything, the higher the revolutions the more junk that gets taken as a positive .This isn't a discussion its fact, that is how PCR works and why  inventor K Mullis said it shouldn't be used to diagnose
1309765476000595975 2020-09-26 16:03:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan 1/There is only a partial gene sequence used to find covid19,  it has close relatives within the coronavirus family that form a match as per PCR testing.  Also as I say the test does not differentiate between dead and live virus,  hence the high false positives. More tests more +

1309758076380119040 2020-09-26 15:33:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Wrong. PCR tests pick up old dead inactive RNA aswell as live genetic material,  it can't differentiate between the dead and live virus.  This is why it says on the side of every PCR machine NOT TO BE USED FOR VIRAL DIAGNOSTICS,  as stated by its inventor.

1308778363432177666 2020-09-23 22:40:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Large surges yes. All covid NO!! Countless deaths have been caused by locking down and shutting NHS depts and cancer treatments etc. No doubt many of those deaths were attributed to covid via the dodgy test. It will all come out eventually.
1308777577230852096 2020-09-23 22:37:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop I call it a bad winter with a new flu virus on the block. We have had those  peaks before in previous winters in the 50s, 80s and 90s, we didn't destroy ourselves though. Many many thousands will have died not from covid but BECAUSE we have a covid NHS. The figures will come out
1308723672161693696 2020-09-23 19:03:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop What don't you understand.  The dodgy test gives the upsurge in positives, the dodgy death certification gives the corresponding surge in deaths.

1308677986007343104 2020-09-23 16:02:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Not made up but reliant on a dodgy test, often misdiagnosis of cause of death (with covid is not of covid, many of the old died of complicated serious health conditions). So yes,  what the WHO is producing as statistics is pretty laughable.
1308515847456124929 2020-09-23 05:17:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop No I don't accept it. It can't be proven on the back of a dodgy test and the dying with and of mess.
1308509057112846337 2020-09-23 04:50:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop There were more deaths last winter than the average,  but not more than previous winter peaks. As the deaths were both with and of covid19, we can't judge the connection to testing.   We need to separate the of covid19,  many with covid19 deaths would have happened via any virus
1308417798750834689 2020-09-22 22:48:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ajcdeane Is than any coronavirus or covid19,  that's the question?
1308416001005039617 2020-09-22 22:40:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop We have no idea what % of positive resulted in sick last winter as we didn't have the mass testing. So far estimates are that current rates of positive results could be up to 90% false positive! No that isn't made up , scientists have used ONS figures to calculate it
1308309539817693185 2020-09-22 15:37:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @rustyrockets You are obviously being deliberately patronising in a bid to seem relevant.  Like a child that can't get positive attention  you decide to get ANY attention!
1308308430415900672 2020-09-22 15:33:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If the vast majority of infections and serious illness/death are happening in nursing homes then why isn't the policy &amp; money pumped into stopping this issue? Could it possibly be that the vast majority of those dying in nursing homes were already so ill any virus would be deadly
1308305602414690306 2020-09-22 15:22:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop The problem is, the failures of this test are NOT taken into account or even talked about when infection rate and insuing policy is created.
1308305075232595970 2020-09-22 15:20:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Yes I accept that happened last winter. Now I accept there is a surge in infection rate apparent, due to massive testing.

1308103848767164416 2020-09-22 02:00:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Brushes1959 @AvonandsomerRob Depends how many revolutions the test goes through, there is no gold standard as it was never intended to be used for an infectious virus. Basically the more revolutions the more likely of a false positive,  picking up of dead RNA cells. Every country is doing it differently!
1308103055083286531 2020-09-22 01:57:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop It is useless for testing for any infectious virus.  It was not created to so so and its inventor, kary Mullis,  stated just that!!! It is inadequate for the reasons I stated.
1308070275284692992 2020-09-21 23:47:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop What more do you need to see how hopeless the PCR test is!?!
1308069549703561216 2020-09-21 23:44:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Asymptomatic positive is almost always an immune person with dead RNA. There is no bar on revolutions of test, the more there are the more asymptomatic positive. Let's stop testing asymptomatic and double test positives. Also 'cases' are not sick people, not even hospitalised.
1308066764241109001 2020-09-21 23:33:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why is it you are accused of being a lockdown moron if you have the intelligence to say the PCR test has too many false positives and can't define between dead and live RNA , these are indisputable facts. I distance, I wash my hands, mask when necessary. Not a moron. Are you?
