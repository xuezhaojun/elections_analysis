1343288343333920770 2020-12-28 04:11:12 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @CurlyandBelle @dawnhume13 To clarify, you can't get in trouble for buying bitcoin. But the exchange might get a lawsuit which can effect the prices and your ability to withdraw funds, for example. Often the exchanges are able to allow users to withdraw funds in most cases but its something to be aware of.
1343287365100593153 2020-12-28 04:07:19 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @CurlyandBelle @dawnhume13 First you should understand the basics. Main things to know are: 1. Prices fluctuate a lot. You can lose money so don't risk more than you can go without, and try not to make rash decisions. 2. Legally, crypto is iffy. These exchanges work within the law but that can change.

1343221164408254469 2020-12-27 23:44:16 +0800 <LucasCosolo> This ancient food stall in Pompeii is really cool, but I feel like people are giving far too much credit to Romans over it, like the concept was somehow ahead of its time. Meso-Americans did paintings on surfaces. Native Americans made food in pots.

1336925778831880192 2020-12-10 14:48:39 +0800 <LucasCosolo> I've always found it very hard to speak my mind, but holding your feelings in is actively harmful to your mental health. Sometimes you get hung up on the best "way" to say something. Just say it. The truth will set you free. You can learn to make it sound pretty later.
1336924631144525825 2020-12-10 14:44:05 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @SpecterQuilava @Lunaursaa It depends on the situation and the person, but I think the most widely applicable advice would just be honesty. You pick up on someone's hint that they want to go out some time. If you aren't a poet just say yes I really enjoy your company. It doesn't have to be complicated :)
1336923615363805185 2020-12-10 14:40:03 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @BigSisYu @Lunaursaa the sleep deprivation is something you can control. start with that. then, learn to love yourself. that's harder.
1336923074441191424 2020-12-10 14:37:54 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @SpecterQuilava @Lunaursaa don't obsess looking for hints and just talk to people you like, do the thing that feels risky but potentially rewarding, because you'll regret it later if you don't :)

1336914324326129665 2020-12-10 14:03:08 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @radtoria The Mentalist. I hadn't been a very huge fan of the cop shows, but I remembered watching a pretty good ep of it on tv once, so I found it online. Wow, what a great show! Simon Baker is a brilliant actor, and the higher level plot of the show is so captivating.

1323724611528384515 2020-11-04 04:31:55 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @GerardPinzone @neiltyson No, it would be ironic if someone who was hardcore pro mask and forced everyone at a party to wear a mask the whole time and follow all precautions and somehow still caught the virus. Because the point of the mask is to not transmit virus to others. Why can't you people get this?

1323720909383966722 2020-11-04 04:17:12 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @JonesGfashaw 8% of Americans who received stimulus, likely the more well-off ones, spent it on "leisure, vacation and hobbies". 40% spent it on debt repayment. You are way off base here.

1321840699059392514 2020-10-29 23:45:55 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @BlakeleyBartley @anthonyvclark20 Bernie has been playing the political game trying to make things better for decades. Sometimes, that has meant compromise, or getting along with people he probably didn't like. He threw punches when he thought it was most effective. He pulled millions of Americans to the left.
1321838609616588801 2020-10-29 23:37:37 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @anthonyvclark20 This is a pointless question to ask. No useful political action can be derived from assuming "the system" is broken and that any fixes must be framed either within or without it. Can voting for a candidate help create conditions where change is more likely? Yes.

1321560407866224640 2020-10-29 05:12:09 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @EclecticRadical @sjmmcd AOC and a few other representatives pushed back on that and are fighting for more progressive policies, and they are Democrats. I really think the path to legitimizing leftist politics is through the Democratic Party, at least right now, with the way U.S. elections work.

1321552792515993601 2020-10-29 04:41:53 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @EclecticRadical @sjmmcd The Dems have had some changes forced on them due to social pressure and voting these last few years. Republicans actively kill our own citizens, they want to spy on us, Mitch McConnell is a creepy decaying demon, please let's keep priorities straight :) just my thoughts

1319798704015085568 2020-10-24 08:31:46 +0800 <LucasCosolo> @fevilon I like rock, pop, some electronic music. Matchbox Twenty. Owl City. More recently I started frequently listening more to older bands like Pink Floyd. I've always liked the Beatles.

I'll show you ten bad policy issues Trump displays proudly on his campaign website. We can do other things besides vote. Trump violently suppresses protesters. 4 more years may see another justice dead. 7-2 conservative court BAD
1319024910069628929 2020-10-22 05:16:59 +0800 <LucasCosolo> When biden, already disappointing candidate, does bad things, we can use the disappointment to move some Democrats on those issues. 4 more years of trump will actively hurt our chances of radical change. Biden doing literally nothing for four years would be preferable.

Rich people are working together, even if they don’t like each other, they have similar political and economic objectives. We need to support each other systematically.
