I've evolved through ALL the genres with varying degrees of interest; for me, it's always been the music more than the lyrics. I never found much 'music' in rap, but the lyrics were/are clear.

We prayed, cried together, &amp; grieved, for Angus is a small fella as well as being epileptic. He's not an outdoor dog. The outlook was bleak.

1329907729809412096 2020-11-21 06:01:25 +0800 <LastNameFree> @BacdocKw @NCManoukian @realDonaldTrump @SecAzar @SeemaCMS Thanks!
1329890148562178049 2020-11-21 04:51:34 +0800 <LastNameFree> @ConservaPeach @LLinWood @BrianKempGA I'm posting it on FB so all my GA friends will see it.  A lot of them are in Trump groups on there, so they'll gladly spread the word. I've also signed.
1329885711475085312 2020-11-21 04:33:56 +0800 <LastNameFree> So - in a nutshell:  @realDonaldTrump is saving American senior citizens money, while the @TheDemocrats' policies will take those savings &amp; more to support illegal citizens from other countries.  WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE???  It's a fucking travesty, a horror story.
1329885709965160453 2020-11-21 04:33:55 +0800 <LastNameFree> 5) The coyotes and traffickers are publicly announcing #Biden's proposed lax border security &amp; are encouraging other nations' citizens to illegally enter the US because #Biden will give them citizenship.
1329885708430028800 2020-11-21 04:33:55 +0800 <LastNameFree> 4) About 10 minutes before these major announcements about saving $$ for Americans, I saw a report from the border patrol about the huge increases in illegal border crossings, how infants &amp; children are being ABANDONED by parents with only a phone number written on their skin.
1329885706802647041 2020-11-21 04:33:55 +0800 <LastNameFree> 3) He did this while being attacked, maligned, &amp; censored by "elites", media, social media &amp; Democrats, including a bogus impeachment, &amp; lackluster support from many in the @GOP.
1329885705414258690 2020-11-21 04:33:54 +0800 <LastNameFree> 2) Pres Trump fought tooth &amp; nail for these changes, taking on #BigPharma, greedy lobbyists &amp; politicians, &amp; he did it for us/US - little people, big country. No other president has or could have done this.
1329885703929556992 2020-11-21 04:33:54 +0800 <LastNameFree> 1) Through my tears, I just watched @realDonaldTrump tell all of #America what he &amp; his admin have done to reduce pharmacy costs for Senior citizens. He, @SecAzar &amp; @SeemaCMS gave $$ amounts his actions will save Medicare recipients &amp; the govt with these changes.

1329858132269539332 2020-11-21 02:44:20 +0800 <LastNameFree> @barbarasscott @LLinWood I was born &amp; raised in SW GA, where the votes are still as red as GA clay, so this is near &amp; dear to my heart.

1309530083833663489 2020-09-26 00:27:56 +0800 <LastNameFree> @DANNYCARLINO @SquishCentral @SenatorTimScott That's putting it mildly. After the past 4 years, I'm more of the view that 98% of mainstream media are 100% responsible for 99% of the mess we have now. I don't know how that'll work with Democrats being 100% responsible, but it's a %%, so it must be true. ü§™
1309525128091500547 2020-09-26 00:08:14 +0800 <LastNameFree> @SenatorTimScott I respect you so much, and your pain is clear.  You're right, justice doesn't equal revenge, and for police to have been charged with causing her death, it would have been for revenge.  I'm sorry that I can't support your view on this, but I do support you.

1309521881981235200 2020-09-25 23:55:21 +0800 <LastNameFree> @DANNYCARLINO @SquishCentral @SenatorTimScott And announced!  It's no wonder things are in such a mess when facts aren't taken into account.  Not blaming the commenter, the reporting on this has been abysmal and misleading on purpose.

1309521030067687426 2020-09-25 23:51:57 +0800 <LastNameFree> @Ron_Bolden_94 @SenatorTimScott I don't see a lack of compassion for the tragic loss of her life.  I see a very unfortunate set of events beginning with poor choices that led to the loss of a young woman's life.  I mourn her death, but I don't assess blame where it doesn't belong.
1309519835425124352 2020-09-25 23:47:13 +0800 <LastNameFree> @TLC63067 @SenatorTimScott And let's correct the narrative that it was a no-knock warrant:  it was a knock-and-announce warrant, as independent testimony proved.  The BF fired his weapon after the LEOs announced that they were police.  Her death was utterly, senselessly tragic, but not the fault of police.

I doubt that they've done the same sort of investigating into Antifa and BLM. Remember Ruby Ridge? Waco?  That's who the feds were interested in, not today's terrorists.

Isn't it unlikely that the stylist would refuse?  How hard would it have been to tell stylist they'd send a car or pay for an Uber for a house call?  Isn't that what #elites do anyway? #HairGate
1301908661325922305 2020-09-04 23:43:07 +0800 <LastNameFree> @Vectom2 I confess to not watching it.  I mean, I love him and all, but ya gotta admit he's a rambler.  I'm one, too, and grew up in the family of ramblers, so I recognize it.  It just doesn't work well in time slots.
1301890931466153984 2020-09-04 22:32:40 +0800 <LastNameFree> @jtothet As long as the #SEC doesn't openly revolt, I'll watch #UGA.
1301890506159534080 2020-09-04 22:30:59 +0800 <LastNameFree> @jtothet I only watched the Falcons. Since I moved to Colts/Bengals territory, I wasn't seeing them before all this Craperick began. Now, if they air, I'll watch, but it's bittersweet. It was a bond between Daddy &amp; me; I'm glad he's not alive to see this. I'm genuinely hurt by the loss.
1301887620788768768 2020-09-04 22:19:31 +0800 <LastNameFree> @Vectom2 You've noticed that, too, eh?
1301887171398381568 2020-09-04 22:17:44 +0800 <LastNameFree> @Vectom2 I concur.  I can't tolerate much of Hannity's one-man, every-2-4-6-years band, but Laura is intelligent and engaging.  Gutfeld is on fire right now, too, but his show doesn't do as well outside a studio.  I wish the 5 was better (ie no Juan).

I totally agree, though, that an edit function would be so helpful.  Even Facebook can do that without erasing the original content!

What I DO care about is those who can afford a lavish lifestyle post-govt life in direct contrast to pre-govt life, as evidenced by villas, vineyards, yachts, and other trappings of wealth.
