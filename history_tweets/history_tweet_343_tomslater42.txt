1343590289311756288 2020-12-29 00:11:02 +0800 <tomslater42> @hoolacambs and it is also important to imagine independence without the SNP.
1343588625527808001 2020-12-29 00:04:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @hoolacambs FFS.  I am pro Indy and pro EU.  But the widespread belief that the SNP is a social democratic party of progressives is damaging to Scotland in the long run.
1343494253553586178 2020-12-28 17:49:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @mostlybolshie No.  Numerous examples of this sort of thing among senior SNP politicians.
1343329630065983488 2020-12-28 06:55:16 +0800 <tomslater42> A few people have asked me recently why I have issues with Sturgeon’s SNP.  This is why.  An unbelievably idiotic and ignorant bunch of charlatans masquerading as progressives.  Comparing contemporary Scotland with apartheid South Africa is just breathtakingly stupid
1342854291204280320 2020-12-26 23:26:26 +0800 <tomslater42> Hi I’m a few “line managers”
1342765391270043649 2020-12-26 17:33:11 +0800 <tomslater42> Johnson should now apologise unreservedly for 1) belittling Chapman like this 2) lying.  I don’t suspect he will do either, because he is a thoroughly dangerous and nasty piece of work
1342164925913964544 2020-12-25 01:47:09 +0800 <tomslater42> Imagine giving a protofascist idiot masses of airtime for years and then he gets what he wants and is then given more of the same.  The BBC has a lot to answer for.
1342133627124129793 2020-12-24 23:42:47 +0800 <tomslater42> 350 million quid every week into the NHS now eh?  Lying arsehole.  Looking forward to rejoining the EU one day when your ruinous government and party are long gone, and looked back on with the contempt they deserve.
1342126276803493889 2020-12-24 23:13:34 +0800 <tomslater42> Totally agree, but not one led by the SNP.
1342061007259258881 2020-12-24 18:54:13 +0800 <tomslater42> Devastating for Scotland but then so is Brexit (which Scotland voted overwhelmingly against).
1341294295471583232 2020-12-22 16:07:34 +0800 <tomslater42> Lynner was my colleague in Edinburgh for a few years and we supervised some great students together.  Her command of her subject was awesome and she was a remarkable mentor to many, many people.  RIP.
1341051021728993280 2020-12-22 00:00:53 +0800 <tomslater42> Oh shit
1341050224509394946 2020-12-21 23:57:43 +0800 <tomslater42> Yes!  The problem with so many public health scholars who are always on TV is that they rarely, if ever, mention these social drivers. Easy option for mainstream TV producers.
1340990388044259329 2020-12-21 19:59:57 +0800 <tomslater42> Why is this idiot anywhere near public office? He has delivered absolutely nothing of substance in his political life other than utter mince.  "In the short term this won't have an impact."  It already is, you fountain of pish.
1340939931837997063 2020-12-21 16:39:27 +0800 <tomslater42> This thread is spot on about Sturgeon and the SNP.  Tired of seeing the fawning over her leadership by public health academics with very little grasp of political economy or even Scottish politics
1339883817142792192 2020-12-18 18:42:50 +0800 <tomslater42> @MrUlster Hello, I saw this photo you took here and would like to request your permission to use it in my forthcoming book.  Can you please follow me so we can DM?  Many thanks!   https://t.co/QomP85riwW
1339644316692656129 2020-12-18 02:51:09 +0800 <tomslater42> This speech by Liz Truss reads like a stream of youtube comments
1339641574045732873 2020-12-18 02:40:15 +0800 <tomslater42> @rodgers_scott Wow. Insane!!  She’s standing in front of a Centre for Policy Studies board. This pish has that think tank all over it (Truss probably didn’t even write most of it).
1339580565209550849 2020-12-17 22:37:49 +0800 <tomslater42> @Glass_PittUrban @R_RoseRedwood @DialoguesHG @CITYanalysis Cool. And peace 👍
1339577693797457921 2020-12-17 22:26:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @Glass_PittUrban @R_RoseRedwood @DialoguesHG @CITYanalysis Oh wow you actually searched through my old tweets? Wtf?! To answer your question, yes those also probably did come too soon, in retrospect.
1339571674006609920 2020-12-17 22:02:29 +0800 <tomslater42> @Glass_PittUrban @R_RoseRedwood @DialoguesHG as one of the 'professional moaners' you are referring to, that's a needless dig at many who were troubled (for many good reasons) by the early CFP.  It is a fine special issue, very well edited, but I still think it came too soon. Ok to say that, and not moaning either.
1339483019808223232 2020-12-17 16:10:12 +0800 <tomslater42> Every day I am fascinated by the room-reading of senior academics on here who are “thrilled”
1339314940050599937 2020-12-17 05:02:19 +0800 <tomslater42> @BecksHewer @claudiakincaid I’m trying to get my head around why he feels it is ok to publish this in 2020 without the least hint of squeamishness.  “Absurd” doesn’t even come close to how fucked up this is.
1339310513851936768 2020-12-17 04:44:44 +0800 <tomslater42> @claudiakincaid same.
1339307231217655812 2020-12-17 04:31:41 +0800 <tomslater42> Indeed.  I hope Derek Gregory’s next blog will reflect on the awfulness of being offered a job that he hadn’t even applied for over a glass of sherry from the HoD.  Sigh
1338884908706623489 2020-12-16 00:33:32 +0800 <tomslater42> @JulReid Hi Julian, did you take this photo?  If not, any idea who did?  I would like to use it in my forthcoming book and need to ask permission. Many thanks.
1338763802305847296 2020-12-15 16:32:18 +0800 <tomslater42> Congratulations to Todger on becoming a Member of your family 🤣
1338445933114175489 2020-12-14 19:29:12 +0800 <tomslater42> Paps of Jura from Bunnahabhain, Islay, April 2018  https://t.co/T8grO8DNCC

1337657682002632704 2020-12-12 15:16:58 +0800 <tomslater42> This pathological liar, aided by the pathetic, fawning, supine mainstream media (e.g.  Peston, Kuenssberg) never had any intention of getting a deal.
1337458467372756996 2020-12-12 02:05:22 +0800 <tomslater42> Just remembered this fine tweet from 2017.  Much of the UK media is absolutely complicit in this unfolding catastrophe.
1337338653043994626 2020-12-11 18:09:16 +0800 <tomslater42> @JK_Remnant There is (perhaps) comfort to be found in the fact that success rates hover around 10-15% for most funding schemes. Sigh
1337327055613124609 2020-12-11 17:23:11 +0800 <tomslater42> @JK_Remnant since 2013, but still, it's getting ridiculous now.
1337301975067742208 2020-12-11 15:43:31 +0800 <tomslater42> @ThomDavies @ProfKate99 @olimould yes, and more broadly it also speaks volumes about academics’ use of Twitter.
1337133169280233475 2020-12-11 04:32:44 +0800 <tomslater42> The NYT was on the case 18 months ago:   https://t.co/LupoDq7k6q
1337117202659635201 2020-12-11 03:29:18 +0800 <tomslater42> @olimould uncomfortable reading!  ‘Pedigree’ and all that. Yikes
1337073306072215552 2020-12-11 00:34:52 +0800 <tomslater42> @LorettaCLees yes
1337071847687512065 2020-12-11 00:29:04 +0800 <tomslater42> @amita_bhakta they must do, given the amount of thrilled announcements on here......
1337071671212171265 2020-12-11 00:28:22 +0800 <tomslater42> @tavmos sorry to hear that too :-(
1337071093706846208 2020-12-11 00:26:04 +0800 <tomslater42> @tavmos going back to 2013!
1337068769974292486 2020-12-11 00:16:50 +0800 <tomslater42> Delighted and thrilled to share the news that I have had 17 grant applications in a row rejected #bollocks #loveHE  https://t.co/iujPrrGfs0
1336983445063544832 2020-12-10 18:37:47 +0800 <tomslater42> 😂
1336769115114131456 2020-12-10 04:26:07 +0800 <tomslater42> Every time I check twitter I see academics tweeting “some personal news” to thousands of people they don’t know
1336017818006003715 2020-12-08 02:40:44 +0800 <tomslater42> I did read it and would like to comment that it’s absolute pish.

1334143882964185088 2020-12-02 22:34:23 +0800 <tomslater42> Another lie. @Twitter needs to add warnings to all of these Tory lies today
1334141733597229057 2020-12-02 22:25:51 +0800 <tomslater42> Surely Twitter should add a warning re: the massive lie in this tweet
1334056875558625282 2020-12-02 16:48:39 +0800 <tomslater42> A shame that geographers who write books about "new openings for the left" were not among them

1331651125985103878 2020-11-26 01:29:03 +0800 <tomslater42> I had a paper rejected by New Left Review as it was “too left wing”

1331336110392430593 2020-11-25 04:37:18 +0800 <tomslater42> Actually not sensible either
1331301346784456710 2020-11-25 02:19:10 +0800 <tomslater42> This is absolutely idiotic and dangerous. We should keep apart for now so when we gather again nobody is missing.
1331232031175565312 2020-11-24 21:43:43 +0800 <tomslater42> @DrCRMatthews nice but what if they are all spammy?!
1331176679943835648 2020-11-24 18:03:47 +0800 <tomslater42> @aidnography disagree, Teams (as well as being slow and clunky) just generates more unnecessary correspondence than reply-alls
1331171919362711554 2020-11-24 17:44:52 +0800 <tomslater42> @BioMickWatson @SobukweScozia excellent rant 👍
1331169658108567553 2020-11-24 17:35:53 +0800 <tomslater42> @SobukweScozia Word.  Email was bad enough but I reckon Teams has doubled the load
1331168323917258755 2020-11-24 17:30:34 +0800 <tomslater42> @SobukweScozia "You have been added to staff team in Microsoft Teams" and "X mentioned you on Teams" - it's a relentless cascade of pure shite
1331167791882391553 2020-11-24 17:28:28 +0800 <tomslater42> @ProfJSDavies it's absolutely insane - it also doubles the email volume as we get bombarded with pure shite like "X is trying to reach you on Teams".  Ugh, just send me an email then!!!
1331164182721519616 2020-11-24 17:14:07 +0800 <tomslater42> Microsoft Teams must die.  Wtf happened to the simple act of sending a simple email with an attachment.  Now I have to wait ages for clunky purple shite to open and then all I find are stupid chats, files that don't display well and just utter pish.

1313748789841350657 2020-10-07 15:51:34 +0800 <tomslater42> This NYT piece is one of the best yet on 10 years of Tory neglect and maltreatment of UK universities
1313463438069444611 2020-10-06 20:57:41 +0800 <tomslater42> Except that this was absolute shite and you just razzed everyone up by spreading pish when decisions on restrictions are not confirmed until tomorrow (and we all just heard it will not be another lockdown). A dangerous shitrag spreading pure mince yet again 😡💩

1311757528783618048 2020-10-02 03:59:00 +0800 <tomslater42> How about this evening’s sunset from the top of North Berwick Law👇  https://t.co/nGiy2QbeTe
1311379178747580416 2020-10-01 02:55:35 +0800 <tomslater42> Agree, brilliant work by @mara_ferreri
1311205127995482113 2020-09-30 15:23:58 +0800 <tomslater42> Been thinking that for decades tbh.  Also wtf England.
1310261076009852933 2020-09-28 00:52:38 +0800 <tomslater42> I see academics replying in anger to Andrew Adonis.  That completely ludicrous bellend blocked me years ago for asking him a genuine question about why he is obsessed with portraying academics as inveterate slackers, so I imagine he is saying more of the same? Ignore him.
1308845710209675264 2020-09-24 03:08:29 +0800 <tomslater42> @wjnicholls03 Roll over? Steam roller?
1308844353377497095 2020-09-24 03:03:05 +0800 <tomslater42> @ProfKate99 Adam thinks he can say and do what he likes. Adam must have Tory pals.
1308841900787535879 2020-09-24 02:53:20 +0800 <tomslater42> @DarjaReuschke Sadly not.  But hasn’t yet called us “essential workers” to justify it.
1308830321434034176 2020-09-24 02:07:20 +0800 <tomslater42> Just when you think Adam Tickell can’t get any more appalling, he’s putting the health and safety of his staff and students at risk when he has the option to move all teaching online.
1308715834467061761 2020-09-23 18:32:24 +0800 <tomslater42> Have been numb about this since I heard the news from his family on Monday. A great friend, comrade and geographer who I enjoyed meeting in Edinburgh for lunch (with Joe Doherty) on many occasions in the past few years. Will be sadly missed.
1308106024797310976 2020-09-22 02:09:14 +0800 <tomslater42> The UK Prime Minister is a truly appalling human.  Also isn’t it time to call him Johnson rather than Boris?
1307642539705593856 2020-09-20 19:27:30 +0800 <tomslater42> Let’s talk about Angela Davis and Antonio Gramsci and the mind-blowing stuff they wrote during their “lockdowns”.  Probably more relevant than Newton to understanding and fighting the absolute political shitshow we are all in right now.
1307631846088474624 2020-09-20 18:45:01 +0800 <tomslater42> @LizzieGadd Er...yes.  I meant the paper that reports on the collaborative development of a vaccine, by those who developed it.  If we get that far!
1307629615108759552 2020-09-20 18:36:09 +0800 <tomslater42> How about we give the only 4* rating to the paper that develops a vaccine (that would be truly ‘world leading’), distribute any and all future research funding equally across all unis, and be done with the whole REF charade.
1306985025800372224 2020-09-18 23:54:47 +0800 <tomslater42> Excellent Covid-Political guidance by my office door  https://t.co/wQcJZOp6w5
1306854127956365312 2020-09-18 15:14:38 +0800 <tomslater42> In case you were in any doubt about Trump's fascist and white supremacist credentials.
1306831231271735296 2020-09-18 13:43:39 +0800 <tomslater42> That he just quit and has encouraged all his colleagues to do the same.
1306831062211923968 2020-09-18 13:42:59 +0800 <tomslater42> Shut pubs early and send students home (online learning is fine for now).
1306552802215329795 2020-09-17 19:17:17 +0800 <tomslater42> I cannot understand how this appalling fool is anywhere near public office
1306292872245841920 2020-09-17 02:04:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @HAYLESBEN Fabulous news, congrats 👍
1306226109663543300 2020-09-16 21:39:07 +0800 <tomslater42> Also, worth noting that this guy is the one person in the world Adam Tickell admires the most, and together they are the architects of the raid on our pension scheme.
1306223269457154048 2020-09-16 21:27:50 +0800 <tomslater42> Everything that is wrong with UK university senior management in one video.  Excruciating and repugnant.
1305448939567579138 2020-09-14 18:10:55 +0800 <tomslater42> 😂😂 #facepalm  https://t.co/ElMpea7p0T
1305418553319981056 2020-09-14 16:10:11 +0800 <tomslater42> Many of us had ‘grave misgivings’ about David Cameron when he became PM in 2010, and to hear this arrogant abomination lamenting a catastrophe of his own making is frankly exhausting
1305091335985270785 2020-09-13 18:29:56 +0800 <tomslater42> A shameful disgrace of a politician
1304706135274991618 2020-09-12 16:59:17 +0800 <tomslater42> Sent this off in February.  Now approved and coming soon👇More details when a webpage for it is up and running  https://t.co/G8LduZTqil

1303782805156102147 2020-09-10 03:50:18 +0800 <tomslater42> @RFMacDonald I’m usually the same, grunting, but this interview was so excruciating I felt a response was necessary 👍
1303771321889959937 2020-09-10 03:04:40 +0800 <tomslater42> Rest in power.  A very great human.
1303720180070125568 2020-09-09 23:41:27 +0800 <tomslater42> @LorettaCLees belated congrats from me too, sorry I missed the tweet!
1303633560419610624 2020-09-09 17:57:15 +0800 <tomslater42> OMG.  The sickening smirk, the indifference, the arrogance, the consistently pathetic attempts to defend the indefensible. And this astonishing natural emetic of a politician is the health secretary during a devastating pandemic.
1303595655777091585 2020-09-09 15:26:38 +0800 <tomslater42> Summary in Spanish of a piece on the myths and realities of rent control that I wrote with @HamishKallin
1303243892322693126 2020-09-08 16:08:51 +0800 <tomslater42> The District Six Museum in Cape Town has set up a link for international donors:    https://t.co/jW4gr7A8hm  If you are able to, please donate to help save this incredibly important Museum of forced removals under apartheid. My blog below explains the history of District Six:
1302554002173964288 2020-09-06 18:27:29 +0800 <tomslater42> And now the District Six Museum is in serious trouble and needs to be saved.  My blog below explains the history, and this Museum simply cannot close.  Donations via this link:  https://t.co/28sqpPW0G9
1302492583629852672 2020-09-06 14:23:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @Jay_Pitter  https://t.co/5eqekn9fA4.  Great thread.  Always loved this piece too.
1302296519245168642 2020-09-06 01:24:20 +0800 <tomslater42> Having had its plans to nick our pensions derailed by theee rounds of industrial action, UUK’s new strategy is to kill us off early
1301828258112180224 2020-09-04 18:23:38 +0800 <tomslater42> 👇👏👏👏
1301801878272053248 2020-09-04 16:38:48 +0800 <tomslater42> Please consider donating something to keep this amazing, life-affirming place afloat. If you want to know more about District Six and why this Museum exists, you might read this:  https://t.co/qfFIt9RKIR  This is such an important and special institution that simply cannot close.
1301799446527848449 2020-09-04 16:29:08 +0800 <tomslater42> Further evidence that @NicolaSturgeon @JohnSwinney  and @scotgov are simply not prioritising the mental and physical health of young people. The closure of these centres would be a devastating loss.
1301589724201705473 2020-09-04 02:35:47 +0800 <tomslater42> England, 2020.
1301515362207436800 2020-09-03 21:40:17 +0800 <tomslater42> Horrific news.  A shattering blow.
1300767195149012993 2020-09-01 20:07:21 +0800 <tomslater42> @davidjmadden the more interesting question is that it takes a report by two BoE economists to get this picked up in the mainstream media, when every critical housing scholar has pointed this out in peer reviewed journals for at least 15 years.
1300752423687016451 2020-09-01 19:08:39 +0800 <tomslater42> @Arrianna_Planey that's exactly it.  People say it reduces email but it adds to it, as you get notifications that people are trying to reach you and then when you get there you can't find shit.  Infuriating
1300703542756478977 2020-09-01 15:54:25 +0800 <tomslater42> 'Microsoft Teams' is utter pish
