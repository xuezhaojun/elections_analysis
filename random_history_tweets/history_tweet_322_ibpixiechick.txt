1339724582320820226 2020-12-18 08:10:05 +0800 <ibpixiechick> How is it possible that we are powerless to stop what Trump is doing &amp; ignoring?

1336743899176595457 2020-12-10 02:45:55 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Wait, looking for my shocked face after the past 4 years. Gonna take a minute.
1336735383154003969 2020-12-10 02:12:05 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Please wear a mask.
1336734996502106118 2020-12-10 02:10:33 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Ya think?
1336733361839206400 2020-12-10 02:04:03 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Accountability here in Missouri? That's funny!!!
1336108808733679616 2020-12-08 08:42:18 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @DrEricDing @drfarmertx Reason for his toothless executive order. What a mess!
1336101831311810563 2020-12-08 08:14:34 +0800 <ibpixiechick> He also claims to be a "very stable genius".

1335372703478525952 2020-12-06 07:57:17 +0800 <ibpixiechick> A thread...a song to pass along.
1335372513774346241 2020-12-06 07:56:31 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @BillKitchen2 @zhaabowekwe @billmckibben @GiniwCollective @democracynow @Tamaraity @RAN @RedPowerMedia @MarkRuffalo @warrior__women @KanahusFreedom Awesome!! Thank You for sharing. We better learn soon. We are quickly approaching too late. Thank you for your song.
1335355135552344068 2020-12-06 06:47:28 +0800 <ibpixiechick> We need to look @ the ongoing support we give our government employees who no longer represent us. There needs to be more limits put in place. Most regular folks don't even get a pension anymore, but we continue to provide for ex gov. employees for life. That's not right.
1335351459379089414 2020-12-06 06:32:52 +0800 <ibpixiechick> When will these massive numbers register with people? Please Please Please wear a mask &amp; social distance whenever possible! Please! Your mask keeps others safe, not just you. Don't be selfish. You might be saving a life. Maybe even your own. It's just a mask.
1335340873203273728 2020-12-06 05:50:48 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @BillKitchen2 No. Was not able to access yours. Pete's is all over you tube. &amp; is awesome! If yours is similar, it is surely awesome too!!! I wasn't able to access.
1335339137424117762 2020-12-06 05:43:54 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @B52Malmet @joncoopertweets I would be thrilled for either Jaime or Stacey Abrams. Either one would be a major asset.
1335330280274616320 2020-12-06 05:08:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Get him!!!
1335330069884104704 2020-12-06 05:07:52 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Not sure what kind of shape we will be in by the end of these weeks, but, yes, counting all our Blessings cuz it could be worse. Whew, a lot worse if he had won. Makes me literally shudder!
1335322172366213120 2020-12-06 04:36:29 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Ohhh, this would be great!!!
1335321639450456067 2020-12-06 04:34:22 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Somehow, just don't see her ruling the block. She is, as always, confused. She has no future. Not even from her cell.
1335319697118597120 2020-12-06 04:26:39 +0800 <ibpixiechick> All media should be on this!
1335318499636498435 2020-12-06 04:21:53 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yet, no state charges?
1335313897583218694 2020-12-06 04:03:36 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @lunaphoenixAK @lonestarmoocher It must be. It's incredibly selfish!
1335313255196221441 2020-12-06 04:01:03 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Right? We would have been done with this long ago!
1335312002647007232 2020-12-06 03:56:04 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Now will they listen?
1335311247210926081 2020-12-06 03:53:04 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @BubbaLucia @lonestarmoocher I would not want to be the person @ the store enforcing masks. It's gotta be scary. But, it needs to be done. We will never get this under control without it. SHOUT OUT to those who are enforcing masks @ businesses! That's some serious kahoneys!!!
1335309149471727621 2020-12-06 03:44:44 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @BubbaLucia @lonestarmoocher We have been doing the same here, only one of us going out for necessities at a time so the other will be here to care for the other since hospitals are no longer an option. Mostly Instacart, Shipt, etc. I am the one who stays home, since March 14th.
1335300453513498624 2020-12-06 03:10:11 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @BubbaLucia @lonestarmoocher It's insanity!
1335297457023029248 2020-12-06 02:58:17 +0800 <ibpixiechick> &amp; Trump.
1335297313980489729 2020-12-06 02:57:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> THIS!
1335296575711686656 2020-12-06 02:54:46 +0800 <ibpixiechick> No future in prison.
1335295268388999168 2020-12-06 02:49:35 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I cannot imagine how it must feel after a 12hr shift, people dying all around, then walking outside seeing all these ppl without masks, gathering together, infecting one another like it doesn't matter. We don't have an endless number of healthcare providers.
1335288825426423809 2020-12-06 02:23:59 +0800 <ibpixiechick> My vision: Ivanka in an orange jumpsuit, a mere peasant as she calls us all.
1335287373991645186 2020-12-06 02:18:13 +0800 <ibpixiechick> They were already cowards. Trump just amplified their reality for them &amp; they willingly participated in their own un-cloaking.
1335284017135034368 2020-12-06 02:04:52 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yo @JoeBiden Please correct this atrocity!
1335282503150678018 2020-12-06 01:58:51 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Too late. Republicans already failed America. They have destroyed themselves as they tried to destroy us. They failed. It all backfired. They are now just the party of Trump. All minions, which is what they wanted us to be. KARMA COMPLETE!
1335281049832726529 2020-12-06 01:53:05 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @jghaynes @Al73912257 @atrupar It all says there are too many people incapable of thinking for themselves, insisting on following leaders over cliffs. Drives me insane! Wake up Sheeple!

1334188667271860231 2020-12-03 01:32:20 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I wonder if people are allowed to say hell no.
1334179327194370048 2020-12-03 00:55:14 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Brad thinks they should have faked a little empathy to win the election. All this irony is getting painful!

1331364374959812610 2020-11-25 06:29:37 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yes, $15 is too low. Even when it is approved, it is incremental, which is worthless. Nobody should have to wait for a living wage. It's time to do this!

1328884247646654467 2020-11-18 10:14:28 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yes This!!! Unity should not mean we allow treason by an entire party. Sooner or later, this is all going to catch up to us. They were nearly successful in destroying our Democracy. If we don't hold them accountable today, they will succeed tomorrow.

I am mortified for our health care workers who have to deal with this. It's infuriating. For every person being careful, there is another running around infecting others &amp; not giving a damn. I grieve for us all.
1328481000188416002 2020-11-17 07:32:07 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @SangreDulce1 She is also describing the level of denial that Trump has perpetuated so convincingly since day one.
1328478426597036033 2020-11-17 07:21:53 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Is there something in our water creating this level of ignorance?
1328476587625504775 2020-11-17 07:14:35 +0800 <ibpixiechick> So much gratitude for health care workers who continue to show up for us❣They put themselves in harms way to care for everyone, including those who refuse to take this virus seriously. Some have died trying. Please wear a mask, wash your hands &amp; stay home if u r able. PLEASE!

1328443903972872196 2020-11-17 05:04:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Why is an administrative clerk able to pull this crap? How is this much power resting in her hands? We did not elect her. She is there to do her damn job!!! She needs to do that or fire her ass!!! This is absolutely absurd!!!

1322676462869225472 2020-11-01 07:06:57 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I'm pretty sure most of us thought it already was a law, like so many similar instances, such as financial debt, rape charges, conflicts of interest etc. I was so unaware of how little is required to run 4 office. More is required for a minimum wage job than political office.
1322657781225295874 2020-11-01 05:52:43 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I would love to see Obama as Attorney General who gets to put away all these crooks, but I can't ask the Obama's to go through all that hate again. It's too much to ask.

1322392750180999168 2020-10-31 12:19:35 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Knowing that everything Trump says is some sort of projection, gotta wonder, is he being paid for every death?

1321960194247692288 2020-10-30 07:40:45 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yup, Q is just a projection machine created to keep the heat off the crooked Republicans.
1321951445210587137 2020-10-30 07:05:59 +0800 <ibpixiechick> While he denies you unemployment, PPE's, testing/tracing, etc., he holds &amp; spends your money. Let's change this!

Just the number of times my heart has skipped a beat or I catch myself holding my breath or screaming into my heart &amp; yes, head exploding, should have us all suing Trump for making us age 20 yrs in 4.

1320262440802766848 2020-10-25 15:14:29 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Pennsylvania, you know what to do!
1320254251625549824 2020-10-25 14:41:57 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Literally nothing can even come close to the level of corruption we have witnessed these past 4 years. Why would anybody believe a word they say? Not to mention, what could be worse then what they have done?
1320226110727217152 2020-10-25 12:50:08 +0800 <ibpixiechick> This just goes to show ya; it ain't about the number of times you fall...but all about how many times you get back up. Amazing!
1320225495036940290 2020-10-25 12:47:41 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @IwriteOK @hungrybowtie What about the soup? Trump says there's soup. Are they gonna ban the soup? ( yes, total sarcasm!)
1320223318742544384 2020-10-25 12:39:02 +0800 <ibpixiechick> All while the outfield messed up both the catch &amp; the throw. So much going on. Great game to watch!

1320199621533204481 2020-10-25 11:04:52 +0800 <ibpixiechick> This is all intentional.
1320151985665003520 2020-10-25 07:55:35 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Why does this guy still have a job &amp; why the hell is he not in jail for perjury at the very least? I expect to see every one of these crooked mofos hauled off in cuffs after we win this thing! I'll wait until T can't pardon. Then slam those doors! Their turn!
1320150111368957953 2020-10-25 07:48:08 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @jpanzer @Delavegalaw A press conference about vacuuming up murder hornets...soooo 2020.

1319376743669637122 2020-10-23 04:35:03 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny @Cleavon_MD True, virus is metaphorical, but I hope we never ever go back to normal. Our only hope is to go forward, beyond our normal that created the likes of Trump &amp; his cronies in our WH. I am aiming for a new world that truly works 4 everyone...beyond normal.

1319103995164622852 2020-10-22 10:31:14 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Maybe I just don't want to believe this. Maybe It's wrong. Either way, VOTE!

The next few months will be extreme I am sure, but we will get there. Love will prevail at last. Then, sweet, real sleep!
1319068130992336901 2020-10-22 08:08:44 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Nobody is talking about China or the missing kids right now are they? They know exactly what they are doing. It's all lies, distractions &amp; set-ups. Don't fall for any of it. VOTE! PLEASE!

1318759901871693830 2020-10-21 11:43:56 +0800 <ibpixiechick> The 545 number is just the number they have actual records for. Don't believe for a minute this is an accurate count.
1318753027256471554 2020-10-21 11:16:37 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I believe this.

1318726690126835715 2020-10-21 09:31:58 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Why is he not in jail &amp; at the very least, why does he still have a job?
1318698152564752385 2020-10-21 07:38:34 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yup, &amp; people will be there, ready to not only die for him, but infect their loved ones &amp; ours. I still can't wrap my brain around it.

1316959095530938374 2020-10-16 12:28:10 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Slipped? How about forced!
1316905764779364352 2020-10-16 08:56:15 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Probably
1316882039862329345 2020-10-16 07:21:59 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Last day to complete the census. Tomorrow is too late. This is how cities receive necessary funding. A proper count ensures proper funding. Please complete the census. Only a few hours left.
1316853781062184960 2020-10-16 05:29:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> They all made money as they watched us die. This, they call success. They pat one another on the back as they laugh @ our reality.
1316824974288654337 2020-10-16 03:35:13 +0800 <ibpixiechick> What brain?
1316821970022027267 2020-10-16 03:23:17 +0800 <ibpixiechick> She lies with the same straight in the eye, deadpan look as the rest of them. They all lie.
1314786379654664192 2020-10-10 12:34:35 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny @DrDenaGrayson I hope nobody shows up. Not one single person, not one staff to set-up. Nobody. Won't happen, but it needs to.
1314782074394619905 2020-10-10 12:17:28 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny @StevenBeschloss Yes, it is terrifying! Definitely something we need to look @ for future. It's like firing someone &amp; giving them free reign over your bank acct. for another month. Who does that? Why do We? Insanity!
1314749307527008259 2020-10-10 10:07:16 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Also, proof should b required.

1312966156614021120 2020-10-05 12:01:40 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny Yup, I'm counting on follow thru if he's a no show. I almost hope he decides to push it &amp; see. I would love to see him hauled off in cuffs! Sure would make my day!
1312963156122238976 2020-10-05 11:49:44 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny Think he'll show up?
1312958640815562753 2020-10-05 11:31:48 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Ohhh yaaaaa...almost forgot about this.
1312945895479160833 2020-10-05 10:41:09 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @CamiLee13 My grandpa always told me "if you can't listen, you must feel". He tried to warn me about consequences for my actions. I caught on late, but eventually, I understood. Unfortunately, he had long past. Still grateful 4 his gift!
1312929400342679552 2020-10-05 09:35:36 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I don't believe the Parsons any more than I believe Trump &amp; his cronies. They all lie &amp; they don't give a damn about anyone but themselves. They were going to throw a party till we raised hell. You trust them around you w/No mask? I Don't. RUN!
1312910551085965312 2020-10-05 08:20:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Sounds similar to Rudy's msg. Must be following the RNC talking points memo. Tell everyone he is in good spirits, cracking jokes. How many will parrot this?
1312869163891855362 2020-10-05 05:36:15 +0800 <ibpixiechick> WTF?
1312869052260507649 2020-10-05 05:35:48 +0800 <ibpixiechick> ?
1312842198111707136 2020-10-05 03:49:06 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Meanwhile, Biden camp, employees, immediate staff &amp; even big tivket donors have been notified by seeing it on twitter. Get real. There is no contact tracing. It's just pretend tracing.
1312841376778907650 2020-10-05 03:45:50 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Definitely a shitshow. Not stunned though. I would b stunned if they had stepped up &amp; told the truth. Now, that would have been stunning!
1312835813709959168 2020-10-05 03:23:43 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @OwczarekNizinny Honestly, I can't look @ it anymore, cuz it looks like he puked in his mouth &amp; he makes me feel like doing the same. It's just all a big, gross lie.
1312834391303954432 2020-10-05 03:18:04 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Whew. This is absolutely devastating.
1312833824863268866 2020-10-05 03:15:49 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I cannot tell. The fact that this is even needing discussion is what kicks my ass.
1312830479071088641 2020-10-05 03:02:32 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Cleared by whom? We're there 2 negative tests each? This from Mr no mask is necessary makes me concerned for all those around the Parsons. They were going to throw a party, remember. Trust nothing.
1312801544413368320 2020-10-05 01:07:33 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Gosh, I feel so much better now. NOT!!!

1312120843124707329 2020-10-03 04:02:41 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @SethAbramson Deemed safe for Trump. Not so much for anyone else. Trump knew it was too late to lessen his exposure, so it was "Seemed safe". Greedy, selfish, intentional.

1311835755434696704 2020-10-02 09:09:51 +0800 <ibpixiechick> &amp; there it will stay. Thanks anyway.
1311835350210416642 2020-10-02 09:08:14 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Does Trump care how many people he is possibly infecting? He stands there speaking out with no mask after Hicks testing positive.
1311832072881872902 2020-10-02 08:55:13 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Or is this Trump getting out of the next town hall style debate?
1311827368869351425 2020-10-02 08:36:31 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Wonder how this is going to work with Hope Hicks testing positive for COVID after travelling with Trump. Or is that how he gets out of showing up. Hmmm.

1311464284090699776 2020-10-01 08:33:45 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Truth is, everyone is addicted to something. Everyone.

1311148163236007938 2020-09-30 11:37:36 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I have to say, that was definitely a test to my years of sobriety.

1310708719597088768 2020-09-29 06:31:25 +0800 <ibpixiechick> @davenewworld_2 @3ChicsPolitico I am reminded that in a few days, they will release him, angrier than b4 &amp; out for vengeance. I hope his wife is gone. This is how the abuser operates. He will not take responsibility.  He will only attack his accuser. I pray they keep him locked up.
1310699799231033347 2020-09-29 05:55:58 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Zero trust that these tests even work. Remember Trump thinks no testing means no cases. It would b just like him to send out fake tests &amp; tout the fake results. Plus, no tracing for positive tests makes testing worthless @ this point.
1310685813198520321 2020-09-29 05:00:23 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Ppl seem to forget. We only need 1 rule: Do only to others as you would have done to you, or be ready cuz sooner or later whatever you have done to others WILL be done to you. Always! Sometimes it takes a moment. I'll wait.
1310683791460007942 2020-09-29 04:52:21 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yup
1310681998080512001 2020-09-29 04:45:14 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yes, the wording is intentionally misleading. Vote no on amendment 3 Missouri. Don't let them get away with undermining what we already voted for. Very dirty politics in this state. Very very dirty &amp; under- handed.
1310675055119134720 2020-09-29 04:17:38 +0800 <ibpixiechick> This is their just relax, we have it all under control announcement. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain they say.
1310665228506607619 2020-09-29 03:38:36 +0800 <ibpixiechick> I still have questions. Shouldn't we be looking @ how Trump can still run for Pres. knowing he is compromised? What is the vetting process that allows this? Who is responsible? Who is ignoring the facts? Why are we still here?
1310655581578055682 2020-09-29 03:00:16 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Please request a paper ballot.
1310655188622020608 2020-09-29 02:58:42 +0800 <ibpixiechick> He should never have been in the WH.
1310644149939507200 2020-09-29 02:14:50 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Decisions about how our money is spent are made by how loud Trump gets to a bunch of pussies. I am so sick of this shit!
1310643539118895104 2020-09-29 02:12:24 +0800 <ibpixiechick> In days long past, I have stood directly in front of my demanding, hateful ex &amp; told him to go fck himself, knowing  I would be knocked across the room for doing so. I am 5' 100lbs. I did it anyway! I said no! Have some damn balls!
1310482327420764160 2020-09-28 15:31:49 +0800 <ibpixiechick> So, exactly what qualifications need to be met to become President? Who is responsible for not properly vetting a candidate? Who ensures qualifications are met? What the hell kind of process put Trump in our house?
1310424494574637058 2020-09-28 11:42:00 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Great thread! Tons of info.
1310423861222158338 2020-09-28 11:39:29 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Ohhh yaaaaa...I almost forgot. Thank you for the reminder Amy.
1310398655631945728 2020-09-28 09:59:20 +0800 <ibpixiechick> Yes, &amp; that no person running for public office can be under investigation or audit.

1310358757151473664 2020-09-28 07:20:47 +0800 <ibpixiechick> You need to add that the Gov. &amp; his wife are having a COVID party next Saturday at the mansion.

1306318579751694340 2020-09-17 03:46:34 +0800 <ibpixiechick> The amount of money being spent in political elections is staggering. Imagine what that money could do. Housing, food, health care. Why do we need to spend our resources on politics? This all seems so backwards.
