You can do this with any species of animal, any breed of dog. You play this game with the concept “chair” or “song” or “money.”  If you want the methodology of the census, it’s entirely self-report.

Once you do, you figure out that it rests on ideas that are quite simple and also wrong, e.g. the idea that the incest taboo is responsible for everything bad in the world.

To *actuate* that requires technocracy, surveillance, suppression of dissidents.

The Platonist-cum-Christian conception of the soul usually holds souls as unique to the individual and equal in their divine origin and purpose.

These ppl aren’t prepared to sacrifice much for the causes they supposedly support. Their appearance of collectivism &amp; solidarity only issues from the rhetoric they spout as competitive status-seeking/virtue-signaling.

Your positive/negative-claim distinction doesn’t determine what can or should be proven. You just made up a rule and aren’t clever enough to imagine counter-examples that vitiate/complicate that rule.

Of course cleaning your own home isn’t oppressive. Friedan &amp; other feminists portrayed it as such.  Muting this remedial conversation.
1310071922332499969 2020-09-27 12:21:00 +0800 <R3SURR3CT10N1ST> @bayple_alex @RRR0BYN @westerninfidel Women’s labor force participation rate rose pretty gradually and steadily over the 20th C. There was no single decisive factor, eg war.  Women entering the workforce increased the labor supply, lowering wages. So yes, that made it harder to raise a family on one wage.
1310058437288624130 2020-09-27 11:27:25 +0800 <R3SURR3CT10N1ST> @bayple_alex @RRR0BYN @westerninfidel ~85% of residential cleaners are women. The empowered woman offloads her former responsibilities onto another, poorer woman... of course the cleaning lady can’t afford to hire a cleaning lady of her own. Same dynamic in childcare. Feminism is fundamentally upper/middle class.

Populism won and we didn’t get it. You can’t blame that on your little anti-idpol hobby horse.

Even "insane leftist" Jews whose revolutionary activity resulted in millions of deaths "brought forth more to help humanity" than Gentile dregs like me!

Americans kids are forced to read the atrocity porn of Elie "certain things are true though they didn’t happen" Wiesel before they can watch R-rated movies. (Real quote, btw.)

He enforced anti-antisemitism laws, and he also practiced conscription.  Who had the harder life? Trotsky's wealthy, illiterate farmer dad, or the Gentile peasants whose labor he exploited?

As for Trotsky's antisemitism, you don't get to dictate what the "bottom line" is. The bottom line

According to some historians, the khappers were usually Jews who took Jewish orphans/homeless kids to satisfy the quota of Jewish military service. (Jewish military service had always &amp; everywhere been very low as they preferred to buy their way out.)

In a case like that, it's understandable why the gov't might let it happen. Jewish conscription is another topic that doesn't ultimately make Jews look good.

Official support for pogroms is highly exaggerated, not supported by documentary evidence. Scope, severity, and causes of pogroms are exaggerated, distorted, and fabricated.
