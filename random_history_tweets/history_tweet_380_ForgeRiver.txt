1341074828615413764 2020-12-22 01:35:29 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Reminds me of the #fraud $LFIN, which Russell Indexes added by mistake (the miscalculated float, B shares), indexes were trying to buy shares &amp; stock shot up like a rocket to $74, before heading to $2. Same for $BLNK, just a matter of time. Indexes back the #fraud pumps blindly.
1341073148209483784 2020-12-22 01:28:49 +0800 <ForgeRiver> $JNHS has in its financial statements an “Investment in Blink Charging”.

1340805882741989378 2020-12-21 07:46:48 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @magicmiketrader Right, so you just want us to know you’ve done zero DD on $BLNK, we’re aware, that was our point - your just listing names in sectors like Enron, WorldCom, or worse, but the sector is hot.
1340804899924291586 2020-12-21 07:42:53 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @gatorwood There are a lot of morons chasing #EV stocks who couldn’t tell you their revenue, competitive position, or CEO name; eventually, &amp;BLNK will be a disaster as in the next year it’ll become clear that the last 12 yrs of failure were no mistake. $180M in losses, $40M+  in exec comp

1339262099621621761 2020-12-17 01:32:21 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Yup, will need continued public funding to build out the infrastructure ... $BLNK has worst biz model in the sector with $180M in retained losses, no teal IP or engineering competency (product making outsourced), just a shell.  $SBE better, cheaper.   https://t.co/IfmGEJAeHR

1339248698845515781 2020-12-17 00:39:06 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @ChicagoTraderrr Why would $TSLA buy $BLNK &amp; not best in class $SBE? BLNK’s products made by others, have few patents, no engineering knowledge, &amp; are run by a conman (right?) lining his pocket? Culturally, $SBE a better fit, over 40 patents, profitable, good products, lower valuation, accretive.

1328517894163017729 2020-11-17 09:58:43 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @jamesjwhelan @tazjam67 Amazing the bubble we are in that a proven 20 year money loser, with a single digit gross margin, growing cash burn, &amp; massive dilution overhang that is still in search of a business plan can capitalize with such demand as $PLUG.
1328516946829127681 2020-11-17 09:54:57 +0800 <ForgeRiver> $PLUG Announces Pricing of Upsized Public Offering of Common $845.5M, with a $126.8M green shoe.    Remarkable given massive &amp; questionably timed insider sales, 20 yrs of loses, 5% gross margins, &amp; growing cash burn.  Ugly #fraud continues biz model search  https://t.co/clpQRFQROv  https://t.co/ADwXCltnVy
1328509558403313664 2020-11-17 09:25:35 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @SenWarren, respectfully u r wrong. Many in college debt have car leases, iPhones, Netflix/XM/Cable/Hulu &amp; other subscriptions, eat out &amp; vacation often, &amp; party. What’s holding them &amp; #America back is a loss of savings &amp; sacrifice that execs w/ options who want to sell shit hate
1328507594282053639 2020-11-17 09:17:47 +0800 <ForgeRiver> That’s $PLUG management’s primary business model for the last twenty years- ride fads to self-enrichment (always first), then raise more cash; rinse &amp; repeat.
1328506960602402816 2020-11-17 09:15:16 +0800 <ForgeRiver> If scumbag management and directors could be used as clean fuel, $PLUG is holding all the cards in the #cleanenergy #FuelCells #EV space?
1328498852282953728 2020-11-17 08:43:03 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Well, at least with all of the potential dilution from this raise, the warrants, convertible debt, options, and ...  At least $PLUG’s book value is at a stout $1.25 pre- the raise.  Should support the stock as investors wake up to this 20 year money scorching 🥵#fraud?  https://t.co/1a4RVC3SWW
1328497573779353601 2020-11-17 08:37:58 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @jamesjwhelan @StockEmpress $PLUG The warrants are only 110.6 million shares in additional dilution, LOL!  About 185M+ in additional dilution, now a money raise.  Any wagers in a reverse stock split by end of 2022?  https://t.co/T3aBQ3DucP
1328496004954542088 2020-11-17 08:31:44 +0800 <ForgeRiver> How utterly ridiculous is $PLUG’s $750M equity raise? It’s 2.4x TTM Revenue &amp; 62.0 TTM Gross Profit. Using $AMZN, on a rev basis it’d be a $738B (with a B) raise &amp; a $5.1T (with a T) raise on a GP basis. Oh, you get the management team that has already burned $1.4B as a bonus.  https://t.co/A2tiINCSSX

1301136588647391232 2020-09-02 20:35:11 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Can anyone explain this to @BLOTUS @realDonaldTrump?  https://t.co/Rowlg4wfk1
1301135922780667904 2020-09-02 20:32:32 +0800 <ForgeRiver> A scumbag’s hate and blind faith allows for no pause to listen to understand or reflect ... a simple #deplorable knee-jerk is all it takes.   #MAGA?  https://t.co/W5B6uYKhpN
1301133255576563712 2020-09-02 20:21:56 +0800 <ForgeRiver> #MAGA #Christian ✝️ only view Christianity as a club they joined with benefits.  Like @realDonaldTrump, when you’re married and pussy grabbing porn stars, if you are their kind of Christian, they’ll forgive you because you hate #LGBTQ, Muslims, and minorities like they do.

1300874916846239751 2020-09-02 03:15:23 +0800 <ForgeRiver> #FactCheck = True #MAGA?  Christians ✝️ especially don’t give a shit as long as you give them conservative appointees &amp; judges that’ll defund planned parenthood, oppress &amp; punish #LGBTQ, and discriminate against other religions.
1300869983388471296 2020-09-02 02:55:47 +0800 <ForgeRiver> These videos are unfair to #America #police.

1300831794120527877 2020-09-02 00:24:02 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @RexChapman Fitting portrait of a dickhead.
1300826026583437314 2020-09-02 00:01:07 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Scottie is an ugly person who likes labels and framing issues ... he sides with the oppressors who are racist.
1300809584366452750 2020-09-01 22:55:47 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Bad call — maybe a racist white jury would overlook his being a minor &amp; crossing state lines armed to defend property that doesn’t belong to him if victims were black; but, he killed white folk!

1300772629238996994 2020-09-01 20:28:56 +0800 <ForgeRiver> What do those with favorable view see in a privileged NYC draft dodging college flunky fake tough guy pussy grabbing lying coward?  Is it his racism, embrace of worst in #America, his wanting to take #USA back to darker #MAGA times, his scapegoating &amp; taking no responsibility?

1300757156380246017 2020-09-01 19:27:27 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @ProjectLincoln Y’all should have include #coronavirus “it is what it is.”
1300748939222810624 2020-09-01 18:54:48 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Committing a double homicide after transporting an AR-15 across state lines now “AMAZING” in @realDonaldTrump’s #America? #MAGA?  Why is Kyle’s mother not facing felony charges?
1300637074085892097 2020-09-01 11:30:17 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Yup, the media pointing out @realDonaldTrump is a sociopath is always the problem ... the pussy grabbing, the lying, the draft dodging, the bullying, the name calling ... it’s not his fault; he’s a privileged scumbag.  #MAGA?  @GOP
1300633245525184512 2020-09-01 11:15:04 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @realDonaldTrumpsaying #America police choke ... killing black folk ... like missing a three foot putt.
1300602058186293251 2020-09-01 09:11:09 +0800 <ForgeRiver> Yes, but his supporters wouldn’t see that on FoxNews or OANN.

1300592914322599941 2020-09-01 08:34:49 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @realDonaldTrump is a draft dodging college flunky pussy grabbing liar.

1300589674935857153 2020-09-01 08:21:56 +0800 <ForgeRiver> @realDonaldTrump is unfit — his whole life as a scumbag has been your with him or you’re against him — he pulls you in with his handshake to see if you submit, take the loyalty pledge, then he uses you. #MAGA? A draft dodging, college flunky, pussy grabber. @GOP
