1336024068471058432 2020-12-08 03:05:34 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Don't really see how that's possible since the #Democrats now know they can take as long as they want and manufacture as many ballots as they need to "win".  No election can ever be viewed as legitimate again without major reforms.
1335989257199030274 2020-12-08 00:47:15 +0800 <RmcccClayton> At this point unless the Senate is going to man up and not accept the electors, we are going forward with this fraud.

1334900511829594118 2020-12-05 00:40:57 +0800 <RmcccClayton> One thing to bear in mind folks is that we don't have to get enough states flipped to win the EC.  If we can get enough in a position where their votes can't be considered so that no one has 270 it goes to the House and that would be a Trump win.
1334897396455706624 2020-12-05 00:28:35 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @gabrielfoley Right, and they should be in police custody being interrogated with the plan being for them to flip out on the person next in the chain.

1334497820120915971 2020-12-03 22:00:48 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @johncardillo OK, but if the GA GOP is willing to stand by twiddling their thumbs when they know the Presidential race was rife with fraud why should any GA GOP voters imagine they won't do it again on Jan 5?
1334495132272496640 2020-12-03 21:50:07 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And #JoeBiden wants to see it happen, that is his economic plan.
1334493480828203008 2020-12-03 21:43:34 +0800 <RmcccClayton> I get why losing the GA Senate seats is disastrous, but how do you expect to win when this time they'll just have Fulton County again cheat out the waazoo?  If the GA GOP won't act to insure this election isn't fraudulent then why are you entertaining hopes of winning those seats

He had to cancel the blocking order because the defendants named didn't have control of the voting machines.  He allowed Sidney Powell to update her filing to add the county officials that have charge of the machines, then blocked it.

1331959289678848005 2020-11-26 21:53:35 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Simple solution pull out 900000 mail in ballots at the rate they voted for the two candidates in PA.  So you'd have 899,900 votes removed from Biden and 100 from Trump, then you can certify and go forward PA.  #StopTheSteaI2020

1328722068758794241 2020-11-17 23:30:02 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Totally agree, but the #Democrats don't like having to compete in properly conducted elections.  They've never run a clean election so it just in their #RacistDNA.

A few that had a more severe case were out for 3-4 weeks and have said they were just starting to feel in shape about that long after coming back from it.  The rest sniffles.
1327335715772968962 2020-11-14 03:41:10 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Hey didn't @DanRather try to affect an election by running a fake story about G W Bush?  Yeah he did run a #FAKENEWS story before he got fired from CBS.  So yeah you're probably right Dan is just another #Democrat that doesn't mind if they always have to cheat to win.

1327243793888849920 2020-11-13 21:35:54 +0800 <RmcccClayton> It is, and unfortunately the #Democrats have worked hard to get their minions in this mode.  They disputed 2000 with no evidence just a hope they could void sufficient ballots cast for Bush to lose chads so they could steal a win, and have done the same thing in 2004 &amp; 2016.
1326954504336658441 2020-11-13 02:26:22 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Yep, that tends to happen when you come out on the most important day of the year and flip off your customers.  They'll go somewhere else.  They did it!!!!  Now they have to go bankrupt with it.
1326949676793335822 2020-11-13 02:07:11 +0800 <RmcccClayton> The Trump court filing in PA is Federal Court and it sidesteps the State entirely using the removal of the observers while votes are being counted, and the fact they acted against the SCOTUS order and did not segregate and protect the late ballots.    https://t.co/kjoAeI7zHE
1326923250618798086 2020-11-13 00:22:10 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Particularly when you assume it hasn't happened in previous elections.  Particularly 2012 &amp; 2016.
1326922895084449793 2020-11-13 00:20:45 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Don't wonder, he didn't.  Same thing while losing ground most places he had extremely high turnouts in Philly and a few other select cities to pad his vote total.
1326876886992084995 2020-11-12 21:17:56 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @no_silenced So sad that idiot libs won't stay in the crime ridden cities they created, and move out to great states like Virginia, and demand they be ruined too.
1326861972906840064 2020-11-12 20:18:40 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And they should all be thrown out.  Once a ballot leaves the chain of control or has been out of observation it should never be counted.
1326690721815031810 2020-11-12 08:58:11 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Well since he'll never get to be President they wanted to give him a consolation prize.  By February he'll be in the dementia ward somewhere telling everyone how he was President-elect right before he smells their hair.
1326666688209809409 2020-11-12 07:22:41 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Plans like these are going to make people very happy that Biden was only ever #FakePresidentElect.
1326664640294760448 2020-11-12 07:14:33 +0800 <RmcccClayton> I'm sure it will, but they chose to stick with the corrupt #Democrats so let them take the damage.  Maybe they'll think twice before helping spy on a candidate for President.
1326663463532457984 2020-11-12 07:09:52 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @BarstoolNewsN Voting without a photo ID requirement.
1326629686546472963 2020-11-12 04:55:39 +0800 <RmcccClayton> They're supposed to be.  But the #Democrats threw out the observers, and committed fraud behind closed doors.  So the only remedy is probably to not certify PA, MI, WI, and let the House of Reps decide.
1326620054692179970 2020-11-12 04:17:23 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Dick Morris breaks down the fraud and what the challenges are.   https://t.co/cP9wB6zOv2
1326597240358572033 2020-11-12 02:46:43 +0800 <RmcccClayton> You're right, but one thing they may have to do is if the Dems can force the legislatures in some of these states to certify even with evidence of fraud, All that kicking out the observers could be enough for them to override the certifications and send the election to Congress.
1326509810762870785 2020-11-11 20:59:18 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Particularly because the things we really need to destroy, and the things the #Democrats want to enshrine and continue are the systemic racism built into the system by Democrats since the New Deal.  90 years of racist state building and they won't let a bit of it be removed.
1326504426669027328 2020-11-11 20:37:55 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Because that is what the New Deal was really all about.  The #Democrats have spent the last 90 years building a government that only benefited them, not their constituents and not any other citizens of the US, just the corrupt elected Democrats and their Bureaucrat lackeys.
1326267440544817152 2020-11-11 04:56:13 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Think about it, he knows the fraud is so bad he couldn't hide it IF ANY investigation was made so he resigned rather than being the man that took out #FakeBiden

1325221356301119489 2020-11-08 07:39:27 +0800 <RmcccClayton> The more I think about all the down ballot wins the #Democrats didn't manipulate in their favor, the more I think they saw that as a bribe to those officials to not do the right thing.
1325219760368390144 2020-11-08 07:33:06 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @TheOSUSuperhero Hang in there.  Big difference between this week and last.  I can handle injury issues limiting you.  We've got it going now.

1325202748254531584 2020-11-08 06:25:30 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Come on PA State Legislature this is your game.
1325201643839762433 2020-11-08 06:21:07 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @oldguy_steve Nah its just about having power and making money off of their offices, the #Democrats don't give a rip about anyone but themselves.  They will dump on their voters as soon as its more profitable.
1325199644272439298 2020-11-08 06:13:10 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @DC_Draino Bless you sir!
1325199115572056064 2020-11-08 06:11:04 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @MikeKellyPA @realDonaldTrump Thank You Congressman.
1325198776668073985 2020-11-08 06:09:44 +0800 <RmcccClayton> So True!  But many of these mindless #MSM reporters won't care as long as they can drink on the company dime and pick up whatever they like.
1325198139070935041 2020-11-08 06:07:12 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @w_terrence Bless you young man!
1325195673780641793 2020-11-08 05:57:24 +0800 <RmcccClayton> The #Democrats partying that they can again begin to fully oppress minorities.
1325193200651235330 2020-11-08 05:47:34 +0800 <RmcccClayton> If this sorts out, and the GOP doesn't stand up and fight for Trump and for us.  Because, ultimately this isn't about Trump its about allowing the #Democrats to make our republic and its elections a joke.  I'll never vote GOP again because they're showing it doesn't matter.
1325189725272100870 2020-11-08 05:33:45 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @MajorityRules2 @C53758546Mandy David, I totally understand.  I'm sitting here in the same place with the Republican Party.  Hopefully Farage &amp; Trump will take up the challenge and we'll see a replacement party arise in both countries.
1325189314502909953 2020-11-08 05:32:08 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @McKaylaRoseJ Bless you young Lady.

1325070977613565953 2020-11-07 21:41:54 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And more importantly where those poor tired workers find a chance to just happen to be back at the building after they went home to rest their poor tired little fingers to do the counting?
1325069486207143936 2020-11-07 21:35:58 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Yes the GOP that doesn't stand with us now should be held accountable.
1325067108095586304 2020-11-07 21:26:31 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Well this is one person that has voted GOP in every election since 1984 that won't vote for any GOP again if they don't fight for this election.
1325066415695679490 2020-11-07 21:23:46 +0800 <RmcccClayton> He always has been.
1324822909668499457 2020-11-07 05:16:10 +0800 <RmcccClayton> We don't know if he actually lost his percentage of white male vote, because many Biden voters were White Males that were born before women or blacks could vote in PA, MI, WI, &amp; GA.
1324767832421400576 2020-11-07 01:37:18 +0800 <RmcccClayton> The GOP may tie the house of reps, but losing the Presidency?  Something just ain't right!
1324539723319250947 2020-11-06 10:30:53 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @aaronjcarpenter If the Fulton County officials had the observers leave and resumed counting which has been alleged then that is another serious case to invalidate those votes.  So that one also has a SCOTUS path.
1324460662563741697 2020-11-06 05:16:43 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Yes!  In 1876 there was so much fraud in the balloting for President between Tilden and Hayes that it had to go to Congress.
1324458111193829376 2020-11-06 05:06:35 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @atensnut Yes, They're doing the same things their #Democrat predecessors have always done in elections.  The party was founded to protect corrupt politicians and band together to gain power, oh and support slavery.  They haven't changed in 200 years.
1324445555276337152 2020-11-06 04:16:42 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And this is a firm basis to declare all of the votes counted in that matter void.  This is how the states law not being enforced will be used to overturn the fraud.
1324391967296507907 2020-11-06 00:43:45 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @Lee_DaVinci Because the #Democrats weren't in control in the elections where most of the Senate seats were decided.  And they're fraud votes were concentrated in large cities so the Senators in Georgia probably would have won in even greater margins if there had not been fraud.
1324367763050291200 2020-11-05 23:07:34 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This is why they went so crazy over ACB being appointed.
1324366481677819904 2020-11-05 23:02:29 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This may be the path he has to take.  Bring in the GOP electors for the disputed states so that the Electoral College can't work and force the election to congress where the GOP has the votes to elect DJT.
1324081075858083842 2020-11-05 04:08:23 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Ballot harvesting in action.
1324016817141129222 2020-11-04 23:53:02 +0800 <RmcccClayton> No, because its the same old song and dance.  #Democrats hold up the vote where they know they can create them to try to win.
1323815161736667139 2020-11-04 10:31:44 +0800 <RmcccClayton> FOX also called the House for the Dems with at least a 5 seat gain, yet the only possible flips so far are all to GOP.
1323814810576932864 2020-11-04 10:30:20 +0800 <RmcccClayton> That's because FOX is focusing all their coverage on why even though every trend in FLA is running positive for Trump and 92% has been counted they just can't call it.
1323793116621668352 2020-11-04 09:04:08 +0800 <RmcccClayton> FOX just reported Fulton Co GA, big Dem stronghold had only 15k votes when they were looking for 100k.
1323792922844737541 2020-11-04 09:03:22 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This is where Biden is down in Fla.
1323747162518413313 2020-11-04 06:01:32 +0800 <RmcccClayton> First the media doesn't have a role of declaring winners they simply report the results which sort of state who the winner is.  The TV people started making early calls, but still that's not official just the media being the media.  Watch the results make your own call.
1323745937362161665 2020-11-04 05:56:40 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @RodEccles Rod, I'd double check on that as there won't be any retirement of the existing digital network 5G is just a layover.
1323744812433113089 2020-11-04 05:52:11 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Not at all.  The PA #Democrats never have.  They rely on massive electoral fraud manufacturing votes in Philly.
1323623696041414657 2020-11-03 21:50:55 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @ATX_PATRIOT @no_silenced You win today!!!!!
1323421896193544192 2020-11-03 08:29:02 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And Bloomberg begins the prep work for tomorrows "unexpected" Trump landslide.
1323421619516280833 2020-11-03 08:27:56 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And remember these are balanced out against ridiculous polls that have Biden up by double digits.
1323417288192778242 2020-11-03 08:10:44 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Old Chiperoo really likes his #democrat voter fraud I guess.  I won't be voting for the guy that wants to rely on manufactured and bought votes to disenfranchise real voting citizens, but hey I guess that's why I ain't Chiperoo.
1323065329036234752 2020-11-02 08:52:10 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @Recook63Russell Not to mention the unemployment was much higher under Obama so much of that job creation was the very slow return of jobs lost under Obama.
1322985092747329537 2020-11-02 03:33:20 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @Therealrajeshp @Lrihendry Remember that the #Democrats were founded by Andrew Jackson as a protection racket for corrupt politicians like himself.    They don't care about policy, and never have, they just want to get voters to vote for them no matter how corrupt they are.
1322948121962418178 2020-11-02 01:06:26 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @MarshallLevy14 We're a pretty decent football team.  Great D, decent O, but we can't turn the ball over constantly, and have major breakdowns on special teams and hope to win.  Figure it out, win out, and beat ISU a 2nd time then see where the chips fall.
1322647112845271041 2020-11-01 05:10:19 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @hauts81 @JennaEllisEsq Not at all, as previously stated there is a big difference between the state executing a criminal that has committed murder, and someone killing a baby because it doesn't fit their plan.  In fact I would consider the person who did that a murder.
1322314847510581249 2020-10-31 07:10:01 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @JennaEllisEsq A great counter is to go OK, if we give up the death penalty you give up abortion.  They'll go nuts but they won't take the deal.
1322236252532412418 2020-10-31 01:57:43 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Just for perspective, the Biden bus came and went to Raleigh on Tuesday, and played to a tiny crowd of union members paid to get out of work and go to the rally, most from out of state.
1322160863445471232 2020-10-30 20:58:09 +0800 <RmcccClayton> What a dreamworld the folks at #FakeNews #MSNBC must live in.
1321552821104398336 2020-10-29 04:42:00 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This is huge as Philly is ground zero for #democrats voter fraud.  Send them to the NJ cities across from Philly as well.  Demo run busses of hired voters from polling station to polling station.
1321552006281072645 2020-10-29 04:38:46 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This is crucial as Philly is one of the main sources of voter fraud in the country.  If they send a few across into Trenton and Canden as well as Essex County.  Stop the vote for hire busses.  #DemocratsAreCorrupt

1320724752672182274 2020-10-26 21:51:33 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Of course it does because a 2nd term means #LockHerUP and we all know #Hillary doesn't want that.  She believes prisons are for her enemies not criminals like her.

1317546149709008898 2020-10-18 03:20:55 +0800 <RmcccClayton> It time to #DefundFBI.  We've now had multiple instances of them sitting on political corruption cases and one major case of them trying to create crimes against the state where none existed.  The FBI is corrupt and needs to taken out to the back 40 and burned like trash.
1317544616539885568 2020-10-18 03:14:50 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And for all you little #Antifa #BLM #Democrats If you get your wish of socialism, you will have less than you do today, but Big Joe Biden and family will still have all of this and more pouring in by the day.  That's the way Socialism really works.

1317263262292070400 2020-10-17 08:36:49 +0800 <RmcccClayton> It's time to fire the whole damn FBI and start over.  They now help criminals and try to manufacture charges against law abiding citizens.  #DefundFBI

1317262541601517574 2020-10-17 08:33:58 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @kimKBaltimore Enjoyed seeing your signs up in Columbia today!!!  Live in Edgewater now so I can't vote for you, but I'm pulling hard.  It's time that district got someone to represent them.

1316929805418401794 2020-10-16 10:31:47 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Good for him.
1316921468572307459 2020-10-16 09:58:39 +0800 <RmcccClayton> This is the most disgraceful act by a US public official at any level since the #democrats let their attack dogs loose on civil rights protestors.
1316499137270091777 2020-10-15 06:00:28 +0800 <RmcccClayton> #JOEMUSTDROPOUT  With the NY Post story Joe Biden only has one honorable option.  He must bow out of the race.  If #Democrats have any concern for the U.S.A. they will demand he resign the nomination.
1316497636048932864 2020-10-15 05:54:30 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Unfortunately probably not.  They're in so deep in their power play with the #democrats that all they'll see is they need to act more perversely to get the full control they so desire.  They need to be broken up via anti trust along with all the big tech firms.

That's where the #Democrats have perverted the judicial nominee process.
1315705948854456326 2020-10-13 01:28:37 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @WBKnoblock Yes you have to move from a no government to a minimal government position (Minarchist).  There's a small bit of government for national security, safety (law &amp; order), and monitoring of major corporations (don't need over regulation, but a structure to protect citizens)
1315492688737775616 2020-10-12 11:21:12 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @TDWiederhoeft Well that is a punishment, but I get it.
1315491881715929088 2020-10-12 11:17:59 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @Bmurphy47 @zlancaster91 They sure do.
1315491543374082048 2020-10-12 11:16:39 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @zlancaster91 What can you do?  Get the team ready to play Iowa State and be glad Spencer Sanders and everyone has time to heal.  Maybe we get to play Baylor maybe we don't.  All you can do is be ready and play the teams that can play.
1315303395511742465 2020-10-11 22:49:01 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Yep, SEC D's look much better when teams just run between the tackles than when they throw for the EZ every other play.
1315303129462853636 2020-10-11 22:47:57 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Well he was the most consistently productive QB of the three in the game today.
1315294317993504768 2020-10-11 22:12:57 +0800 <RmcccClayton> And if this latest Antifa gunman is working for NBC the lines really become blurred, or we can just admit they were never there.
1315291414146801664 2020-10-11 22:01:24 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Presidents usually get more votes than their approval rating.
1315287171104935938 2020-10-11 21:44:33 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Yes it does, and what bodes even better is the 56% polling of those that feel they are better off today than 4 years ago.  That poll is probably closest to what the real vote will be.
1315073694558031873 2020-10-11 07:36:16 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Not if you vote #Democrat.
1315070379791134726 2020-10-11 07:23:06 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Only Joe Biden would run an add against himself.

1315060106334216192 2020-10-11 06:42:16 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @ACTBrigitte Absolutely.  The only reason for the polls to be off as much as they are this year and have been for every election since 1980 is that the organization paying for the poll wants them pushing Dem victories.
1315050913812414467 2020-10-11 06:05:44 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @leecothran @MarshallLevy14 I know its maddening but probably because they have to work with the dirt burglar rooters and its just easier not to go public with your disdain.

1315049803018129408 2020-10-11 06:01:20 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @MarshallLevy14 Yeah bouncing back and forth between the ISUvsTT &amp; TCUvsKSU games and I don't see a team that OSU can't beat.  This team just has to take care of business.
1315020762965835777 2020-10-11 04:05:56 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @GSwaim Both staffs could be fired after this one and the fans would probably think that was too soft on them.
1315017604625387520 2020-10-11 03:53:23 +0800 <RmcccClayton> woopee more of this game between crap teams #OUvsTX
1315010558354231299 2020-10-11 03:25:23 +0800 <RmcccClayton> That about sums it up.
1315006746197479426 2020-10-11 03:10:14 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @GSwaim I'd say Tom's nightmare is coming through in front of his eyes.  No D outside of the gifts the zero's give them, and Ehlinger still looks as lost as he did his first game.  They can't run and they can't pass their offense has relied on zero penalties.
1315005632509087744 2020-10-11 03:05:49 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @OSUfreak82 Both teams have looked very unlikely to challenge for the title.
1314559406013636609 2020-10-09 21:32:40 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Well if the #Democrats and their allies at the debate commission want virtual debates then let each candidate hold a rally and they can debate from the respective stages.
1314558346482122755 2020-10-09 21:28:27 +0800 <RmcccClayton> The 44% that are supporting Joe Biden.
1314556690445074434 2020-10-09 21:21:52 +0800 <RmcccClayton> He is it's called the #DemocraticParty.  They've spent the last 90 years building systemic racism, and they use their KKK and Antifa thugs to enforce it.  They oppose any change to what FDR built, and will continue to do so.

1314541694797438976 2020-10-09 20:22:17 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @rhp997 No, they generally watch the list of offers, then give out the stars.  Reassigning them as the kids commit.  Someone commits to Alabama they gain a star or two, committ to Mississipi State lose a star or two.
1314361093033263104 2020-10-09 08:24:38 +0800 <RmcccClayton> So do ratings services base stars on the school or the player?  I think its probably on the school.
1314218034949746689 2020-10-08 22:56:11 +0800 <RmcccClayton> It's what happens when one party gets to rule for 50 years, and has full control of all institutions that don't have elected members.  The #Democrats have had control for 90 years now and it gets worse every day.  Time to get them out and keep them out.

1313905180153466881 2020-10-08 02:13:00 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Absolutely, if they can get rid of Trump then the #Democrats will go for total control.  It will let them implement the police state they desire.
1313824026666639360 2020-10-07 20:50:32 +0800 <RmcccClayton> Now @MomJar1 they did do something.  They fought hard to protect the racist policies and racist personnel in institutions that the #Democrat Party has spent 90 years putting in place and preserving.

They also get people all worked up over side issues like Breona Taylor instead of looking at things like how welfare creates government dependence.

I've got no interest in ESPN, don't have them and won't be watching them.  The Iowa State and Army feeds neither had any such messaging.  Just football.

1303735856302301203 2020-09-10 00:43:45 +0800 <RmcccClayton> @originalokie The Federal Govt does not set policing standards, higher, officers, or train them.  So to say the failures of city govts to not be abusive to their citizens is not the fault of Trump.  It's the fault of the city Mayor and council.  The worst places are under Democrat control.
