They are the angels. They do the difficult, backbreaking work of caring for our loved ones, with low pay and little glory.

1319063790617612288 2020-10-22 07:51:29 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @ScottBaio Actually, no. But what I do see is someone not seeing the reality of the damage his political candidate has done to his country. That is reality, an old TV show is a fond memory.

1312468527668887553 2020-10-04 03:04:16 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Oh Rona you are right. We wouldn't put anything past Trump and his Rogue's gallery of enablers. You included. And its not just the media...its the American people. Like me. A 57 year old grandmother from Florida. BIDEN 2020.
1312444414757728256 2020-10-04 01:28:27 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @realDonaldTrump So you are enjoying your taxpayer funded healthcare? Socialized medicine at its best. Still planning to kill the ACA and take our healthcare away?! Good return on your 750.00.

1312302251160014853 2020-10-03 16:03:32 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @realDonaldTrump I am thinking of the 200,000 dead from covid19. Will you still kill the ACA? You have received healthcare on the TAXPAYER'S dime!  More than $750.00 worth.  Or will you say "it is what it is"?
1312301142127378432 2020-10-03 15:59:08 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Speak for yourself. I am remembering Trump saying "it is what it is" when reminded of the hundreds of thousands that died from covid. Will he still kill the ACA after having received great healthcare on the taxpayers dime?

1311819294666260482 2020-10-02 08:04:26 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @SenBlumenthal @Rosie_wearamask She would gleefully celebrate a return to the back alley abortionist for women that have been feel unable to continue a pregnancy. And then again celebrate ripping away healthcare from millions as a political payback and a return favor to those that appointed her.

1310971849266941957 2020-09-29 23:57:00 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Don the Con advising on religion and morality? What a sad joke on the American people.
1310970022135762946 2020-09-29 23:49:44 +0800 <ToniMedvetz> @VoLinxx More honest than other Trumps tho.  She told us she could care less about America a long time ago.

This is an incredible conflict at best, security risk at worst. I am not ok with him not paying his fair share.

No violence in the street from Trump militia terrorists.  Innocent people being attacked while protesting peacefully.  Nope the good people will stay. You go.
