1343634857742708738 2020-12-29 03:08:08 +0800 <L48130> @soulshine41 Twin Pines.  Came twice a week. World's best peach ice cream - in August only.  My aunt's house had a milk shoot.  We had an aluminum milk box.
1343338346710511618 2020-12-28 07:29:54 +0800 <L48130> @RetroCrone Definitely feels real. I am almost 70. My husband is 74.  We stay home. Have only been to medical appts or grocery store since March. Mom, 91, is in a nursing home. First Covid outbreak killed 13 residents. Second outbreak just identified.  Cannot even visit her.

Christmas Eve from noon, Christmas Day, and 2d day of Christmas are legal holidays. My husband's family then leave the tree up until, Three King's Day, Jan 6.

1343050362085904384 2020-12-27 12:25:33 +0800 <L48130> @Mikel_Jollett When I was a kid, no matter how much water a scotch pine received, it dried out quickly.  My family always cut another few inches off the trunk, before putting it in the stand.  Usually the Sunday before Christmas.  Then, took it down the Sunday between Christmas and New Year.

1343040156941623298 2020-12-27 11:45:00 +0800 <L48130> @retiredknitwit I order online with Kroger. Once the time for pick-up is set, it cannot be changed. Some items, I label no substitutions, such as no sugar added applesauce. They pick&amp;pack the grocery list, run thru checkout, then load in my car trunk. Cash or credit card. Really like it.

I was the first person in my Dad's family to graduate from college.  And the first to graduate from high school.  UofM was worth every effort. Study hard and enjoy A2!
1341861054859624449 2020-12-24 05:39:40 +0800 <L48130> @yashar Yes.  I had one when living in Boston in the 70s.  Amazon carries several brands.  $50-$70 dollars.  Key is sturdy wheels.  If you do not want to use shopping bags, some models have canvas bags or liners.  I used search term:  shopping cart for groceries.
1341667380972433408 2020-12-23 16:50:05 +0800 <L48130> @bridget_joy_ I would expect requirements for vaccination to be a school attendance requirement for children.  For adults, part of some kind of work certification rqmt.

Michigan required a TB free certification, a Food Handler's Card, for employment in the industry in any capacity. This annual health check caught that my Dad had active TB.

One of the assessments was that she was unable to read social cues until she was in the center of a storm.  Then, everything explodes.  She does not process how she got there.  This was the 1990s.
1341660697978146820 2020-12-23 16:23:31 +0800 <L48130> @mdnij34 Worst year was step-daughter, 13, threatening to burn the house down on Christmas Eve.  With her father, brother and me in it. She was committed  by a court to therapeutic foster care. Ultimately, 9 months on the 3rd floor of a boarding school with intense psychological therapy.

The ACE inhibitor at night.  My BP is no longer low all day and high at night.  This caused fatigue and dizziness.

1333737456269742081 2020-12-01 19:39:23 +0800 <L48130> When does it end?  This rhetoric is so very dangerous.
1333728206315261952 2020-12-01 19:02:38 +0800 <L48130> @TheRealHoarse If you solve insomnia, please share!
1333637050902474755 2020-12-01 13:00:25 +0800 <L48130> @faridghalili @sharonw604 Yes.  No one will bring a case that is not well vetted.  It will be open and shut.  Or, there will be no case.
1333619387257991170 2020-12-01 11:50:14 +0800 <L48130> @sckarr1 @Rocketsinaus I wish I could feel something besides contempt.
1333558384981913600 2020-12-01 07:47:49 +0800 <L48130> @ScottDguy @mama_c2 Chemistry.  Surprisingly, I did use the Physics.  Never expected to do so.  But, justified an engineering inspection of a building where I worked. We evacuated the next day.  The building was unstable.
1333190212512518144 2020-11-30 07:24:50 +0800 <L48130> @BillTzamaras Enjoy life more!

1332710319173603328 2020-11-28 23:37:55 +0800 <L48130> @VotingBlueInTX @NatalieisBlue Did you try Peacock?  It is the new streaming service from NBC.  With how much MSNBC advertises Peacock, at least some MSNBC content must be on it.
1332538332157534208 2020-11-28 12:14:30 +0800 <L48130> @WonderfulWolf77 @PernicketyPanda @TrivWorks @Angry_Staffer Or, find new solutions and funding streams. Strategic planning is out of box thinking.  If established ideas are good enough, the issue does not need strategic thinking.
1332537531322273793 2020-11-28 12:11:19 +0800 <L48130> @WonderfulWolf77 @PernicketyPanda @TrivWorks @Angry_Staffer Yes. Strategic planning looks at today, visualizes what should be or will be, and lays out the plan to get there. So, as a population ages, zone for more one story homes, train more health workers, nurture public trans, repurpose schools to senior centers, etc.
1332519909713121281 2020-11-28 11:01:18 +0800 <L48130> @PernicketyPanda @TrivWorks @Angry_Staffer I see pink and white.  Worked for many years in strategic planning.  Tested right brained off the chart.  😂

1332206295156404225 2020-11-27 14:15:06 +0800 <L48130> @CallMeDavid2020 So sorry. We hear from my stepdaughter when she wants something, usually money.  But, we have also spent 5 years taking care of her children while she got her life together.  It hurts me.  But, it breaks my husband's heart.  We did not hear anything either.
1332195191042748420 2020-11-27 13:30:59 +0800 <L48130> @gymdogsorbust @notyour_uncle Absolutely!

Any mechanism used to sort populations and establish hierarchies.  Wealth can signify power.  But, not all wealthy people are powerful.  Elites establish the symbols of the hierarchy, the manners, and customs.
1331777437835948032 2020-11-26 09:50:59 +0800 <L48130> @notyour_uncle A warm hug coming your way!
1331777297951625220 2020-11-26 09:50:25 +0800 <L48130> @notyour_uncle Also, please do not feel shame if you need a food bank or unemployment insurance.  You paid taxes and donated food.  Maybe you volunteered at a soup kitchen.  Now you are the one in need. And others are helping you.
1331775759992680450 2020-11-26 09:44:19 +0800 <L48130> @notyour_uncle Please do not feel shame. Losing your job, reduced hours, are mostly beyond your control at this time. This is the year for something other than electronics and Legos. Walks in the park, baking Christmas cookies, your kid's making gifts from recycle or crayon candles &amp; ice cubes.
1331725739310411776 2020-11-26 06:25:33 +0800 <L48130> @JoyceWhiteVance Roast beef with vegetables.  Pumpkin pie.  Green jello (my Michigan is showing), fresh bread.  Just the two of us.  Should have several days leftovers.
1331670917815148549 2020-11-26 02:47:42 +0800 <L48130> @jc_qian Yes.  Either stop the virus or commerce will grind to a halt.  Also, the cost of long term medical care for those infected with the virus will be staggering. The more people infected, the higher the cost.
1331646079402713089 2020-11-26 01:09:00 +0800 <L48130> @clairecmc The key to celebrating holidays away from family is to do something different.  Maybe a different meat or side dishes.  Watching that longed for movie rather than the parades.  Little differences make distance easier.
1331640261777235968 2020-11-26 00:45:53 +0800 <L48130> @mle_goldman My mom is in a nursing home.  She is 91.  Every so often she asks about family members.  And grieves again.  She remembers the people, but forgets that they have passed.  She has trouble accepting that she is the last of her generation.
1331527598178963456 2020-11-25 17:18:12 +0800 <L48130> @mitrakalita How many soldiers/sailors/airmen are deployed away from home?  If the hardest thing someone is asked to do for their country is miss  one year's holiday meals, life is pretty good.
1331505598974873601 2020-11-25 15:50:47 +0800 <L48130> @MissMelissaST Covid safe.  Just hubbie and me.  Son is not coming home.  Sent him a gift certificate for a holiday feast in his apt.  My mom is in a nursing home.  Will call them...

1330373089918644226 2020-11-22 12:50:36 +0800 <L48130> @chrislhayes Set turkey in pan. Cover turkey skin with olive oil. Put seasonings on bird. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Bake usually about 20 minutes per pound of defrosted bird. Remove foil about 1 hr before done to brown. If you get in trouble on Thanksgiving, call @butterball.   2/

Stovetop stuffing(with a lot of liquid)+onions. Check for any remaining feathers--pull or burn off. Spoon dressing into turkey cavity.  Pour remaining dressing into pan.  1/

When kids grew up on a farm, maybe they met other people in church once a week, maybe not.  Being continuously with people your own age is a new thing.
1329986687687122944 2020-11-21 11:15:10 +0800 <L48130> @cebrazil We are just my husband and me.  Adult children are staying home.    Grandchildren are staying home. Cornish hens rather than turkey.  A roll of Canadian bacon in lieu of ham.  Pumpkin pie.  Peas.  Stuffing.  Watch the parades.

Do you want your son or a grandchild to live knowing they infected you with a virus that kills you or Jenny? You can host a Thanksgiving in July when everyone is vaccinated. In the meantime, Zoom your son and grandchildren.

If we are out of medical personnel, out of hospital beds, out of protective equipment, and out of mortuary space, what is left except a lock down? We are not out of food, fuel for electricity, etc. Who will use small business services if the price is losing a family member?

1325551734954012673 2020-11-09 05:32:15 +0800 <L48130> @CyrusMMcQueen The pace of change is staggering. Many are not coping well. It is not necessarily a money thing. It is more my college educated kid cannot find a good job. My grandkids are a plane ride away. My 8, 16, and 23 year old are all learning on-line while I try to telework.  Masks???

1309724683441508353 2020-09-26 13:21:12 +0800 <L48130> @RabbiJill @messy_chessy_ Perhaps a shovel of dirt is a custom in many faith traditions? At my aunt's Catholic mass and graveside service a few years ago, the priest invited the mourners to place a shovel of dirt on the casket after it was lowered.  I cannot recall the exact phrase, but "dust to dust".
1309625069568700417 2020-09-26 06:45:22 +0800 <L48130> @bubulaboo No.  It will end your marriage eventually.

1309552334230429704 2020-09-26 01:56:21 +0800 <L48130> @RabbiJill Most likely a Catholic is saying a prayer.  The Sign of the Cross begins and closes the prayer.  In thanks for what RBG did for us.  For the repose of RBG's soul, for consolation for her family and loved ones, perhaps for the country.

1309003031548133379 2020-09-24 13:33:37 +0800 <L48130> @JoyAnnReid There needs to be some kind of "truth" or fact finding commission.

Her mind is pretty good, but there were no family stories.  Her family were mostly living on farms.  Suspect that in many of the small towns (where most people lived), Spanish Flu was something in the papers.

1301946250900705280 2020-09-05 02:12:29 +0800 <L48130> @JoyceWhiteVance @JeffreyGoldberg Watching this thread. My husband is a retired Army warrant officer. Bronze star for service in the Gulf War. When the story broke last night, he sat here with his head in his hands. Could not sleep. The hurt and anger these cmts instilled in the military family is deep.

1300995499592486912 2020-09-02 11:14:33 +0800 <L48130> @chris_belcher Alert Fire Marshal or security guard that a student was smoking in class. Smoking any substance inside a building is most likely a fire and safety hazard as well as illegal. Failing to do anything is endangering the health of others. It will probably just take a hallway stroll.
