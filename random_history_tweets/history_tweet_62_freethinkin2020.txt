Why in the only five counties where Biden outperformed Hillary Did they all stop counting at the same exact time

Biden will not be President. The left wants him out to make room for Kamala. DS will allow the evidence out to take him down.

1337238346104496128 2020-12-11 11:30:41 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @DanKess This is the dumbest tweet. Ballotd that are cast illegally are illegal. People's race is not identified on a ballot. Unless you are being a racist that black people are so dumb that they can't fill out their ballot correctly?!

She lied
1337235390588215298 2020-12-11 11:18:56 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @gal_deplorable I want to debate her! How is billions in bribes by China and the powerful influence they have on Dems and Rhinos have to do with a digital movement for the truth.

When every issue he takes the opposite side even before facts come out such as beer gate or calls us bitter clinging to our guns and religion in an elitist pompous manner probably had something to do with it.

1337090894479187971 2020-12-11 01:44:45 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @journopixs @TheRickWilson Correction 30% of Dems feel there was fraud all of the Republicans feel like there is fraud that actually equals 90 million people. So 17 AGs plus 90 million people are fighting to save the Republic

Magically the margin needed appears for Biden.

Government was never meant to be cradle the grave. Help with major infrastructure and big issues then leave us alone

PS Joe Biden will never be president!

You guys are living in an alternate reality anyone who watched him speak at his 10 people rallies, two failed presidential elections, 47 yrs of doing nothing good &amp; China and Iran. We weren't scared of him. We're scared of the fraud. But it will be revealed.

1334703279402602496 2020-12-04 11:37:14 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Turk182_JCP This should have been everywhere before the election. Bidens are very sick people
1334702940767055873 2020-12-04 11:35:53 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Megsterama I agree with you but they're censoring content so why would you give them the benefit of the 230. I wish that they could just revoke their charter as a platform and label them publishers. Or add outrageous fines or penalties if they don't comply.
1334683101201637377 2020-12-04 10:17:03 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @BrandonStraka @CNN @MSNBC @PolitiFact @snopes I know I'm supposed to play the game but did anyone notice how pissed off people were that there was actually a camera in that room they wanted to know where it was from who put it in there why was it there.  They're so pissed off they got caught

1334641886502531072 2020-12-04 07:33:16 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @olscrachjohnson @realDonaldTrump Look what's going on now He did not lose his base at all. there's more of us than you think because the vote doesn't reflect it bc fraud and if they don't take us seriously I think you're going to see a huge problem in the streets and how many people actually support Trump
1334641318379876353 2020-12-04 07:31:01 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @darrylforbes_ @ZedockAllen @Demure_Blonde @LngNstrt @Cernovich I know you guys keep talking yourself into it Trump won There are more people who like Trump people switched parties because of them some of your leaders switch parties because of him.

1334498266101280768 2020-12-03 22:02:35 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @TrumpWarRoom @ChatChristi We don't care what people did in the past The Democratic party has changed so much So has the Republican party and most of us would leave that party if you gave us the Patriot party!!! I stand behind Trump and @LLinWood  He is fed up just like the rest of us.
1334496749130539008 2020-12-03 21:56:33 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @robbystarbuck @ChatChristi This man is a hero and he speaks with emotion and conveys exactly what all of us think
1334496127115276288 2020-12-03 21:54:05 +0800 <freethinkin2020> We will not except this election until this is done!

1334491150846144515 2020-12-03 21:34:18 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @NeilSullivan72 @RealMattCouch Why would you want Republicans to fall in line with the Dems What they're proposing doesn't actually solve the problem It just kicks back money to the states not the people
1334489595191373824 2020-12-03 21:28:07 +0800 <freethinkin2020> 3 month shut down?
1334477056395128838 2020-12-03 20:38:18 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @ocean_affair @tgatorguy I would say there's even more than 74 million cuz now some reasonable independence and some Democrats who are honest with themselves realize fraud really happened
1334466439382786052 2020-12-03 19:56:06 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @ScooterCasterNY @Bogan1Kevin Why did they put it up if no one can see it!
1334321898944147457 2020-12-03 10:21:45 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This whole thing is ridiculous
1334319026500227076 2020-12-03 10:10:21 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @americanmom6 What is she talking about most of those people that are up there have signed affidavits!
1334317657399693313 2020-12-03 10:04:54 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Witness annihilation! They don't respect freedom of speech and searching for truth and fairness
1334317255614738438 2020-12-03 10:03:18 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Wash64025297 @michaelbeatty3 I hope some amazing Patriot who has a job gives one to her!
1334316096971829249 2020-12-03 09:58:42 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @EWErickson I guess the question is what does it matter if he's a Democrat or Republican We're a party of Patriots. Republicans we have a huge tent and we invited tons of Dems in over the last 4 years and he's fighting harder than any one of the Rhinos!!!
1334241836999782401 2020-12-03 05:03:37 +0800 <freethinkin2020> I did not realize that there's two zones in Staten island and just a block and half away from this restaurant you can eat! And everyone moves freely going to a gym, shopping, restaurants. Where is the science that supports this?
1334212169337098241 2020-12-03 03:05:44 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Now Media do your job
1334210754665455617 2020-12-03 03:00:07 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Wake up people. Dem mayor NY21
1334210453019500547 2020-12-03 02:58:55 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @yojudenz Why do they need to be counted if they don't get a vote
1334209348843794434 2020-12-03 02:54:31 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @VPNightshade @JHTX77 hey Schumer did you allow Trump the same courtesy No you didn't in fact you guys block them and made this transition so hard.
1334208986980216840 2020-12-03 02:53:05 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MaddowBlog 1st he didn't say to shit him. Your a drama queen  violence did you say that to Antifa and BLM. Where were you when they threatened Republicans the night of the vote &amp; since then. What about and the left during the last four years holding Trump's head in hand dripping with blood!
1334203466252693507 2020-12-03 02:31:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Thank you! Two totally different companies

1334187390806716418 2020-12-03 01:27:16 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Now let's call all of them and make sure that they actually filtered out and sent it in
1334184180020879362 2020-12-03 01:14:31 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MaggieM46240943 So she's saying there's justification to shut down the First amendment! In America anyone can say anything they want people choose not to say certain things because of social etiquette but in reality you can say anything you want That's our constitution right

1334091634183712769 2020-12-02 19:06:46 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @TomBevanRCP I would contest that race and I would bring a lawsuit that's insane
1334091512217542659 2020-12-02 19:06:17 +0800 <freethinkin2020> BS!
1333979547239329792 2020-12-02 11:41:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> So Melania can press felony charges against CNN?
1333975730515042306 2020-12-02 11:26:12 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Yes!!!

1333936182951030785 2020-12-02 08:49:04 +0800 <freethinkin2020> How do people vote for these hypocrites?
1333934508140335106 2020-12-02 08:42:24 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Yup he brought out the race card!!! President Trump's policies which the GOP senate is on board with will positively impact the black community not what the Democrats are selling you.

1333779759004848133 2020-12-01 22:27:29 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @candymh46 @emmiegray Candy there's no fraud? The MIT and computer scientists &amp; the smartest man in the room that Sydney has on record proving there was fraud are wrong? What about first-hand experiences from pool watchers that were Dem &amp; Rep saying there was fraud? You know more than them?
1333776445781520386 2020-12-01 22:14:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Biden lied over and over about that claim.

1333771592833314819 2020-12-01 21:55:02 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This is ridiculous
1333770350446977024 2020-12-01 21:50:06 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Kidding me!
1333766112564154369 2020-12-01 21:33:16 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @PSwal807 @JodyBelcher7 It was already out there but no one cared to report it
1333765394444726272 2020-12-01 21:30:24 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Why did this change? It hasn't it is still true!
1333764090565709825 2020-12-01 21:25:13 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This just infuriates me bc again Trump was right. On Twitter people had pictures of this? People on the side of the road in China dead and no one would listen. China had lied to us about the virus &amp; MSM blamed Trump! Way to go CNN your reporting something We already knew!!!
1333754284274495488 2020-12-01 20:46:15 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @TheRightMelissa @totemranch613 People say get over it Trump didn't win Do they realize that they're talking to over 73 million people and 49% of the United States believe there was fraud. Americans will not accept the selection They will not accept Biden This is not going away.
1333750969339961344 2020-12-01 20:33:05 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @rhondacarlisle9 He will not either will the lawyers
1333750789114896384 2020-12-01 20:32:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Thanks we already knew that! Trump told us that they lied to us It's about time CNN brings out the real information to their viewers.
1333746352015237121 2020-12-01 20:14:44 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MarkDice @GirlontheIsland Have bars really been super spreaders?

1333601457942224902 2020-12-01 10:38:59 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @pgbridges @jenspen87 @MJM128 @brooklyn3r @Barnes_Law @dougducey @Garrett_Archer @SecretaryHobbs @GeneralBrnovich Great then let us see the analysis as to why those jumps or curves happen. Show us how they are normal and consistent with the numbers and historical data. Can you explain the anomolies because many experts have explained it by fraudulent behavior.
1333599927939829760 2020-12-01 10:32:54 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @karhifer @countrymusicATK @icowrich @imjdsharp @dougducey @SecretaryHobbs @GeneralBrnovich Whatever it was it had high level experts telling you how much fraud happened You probably should have listened to it as well as @dougducey
1333599476947308546 2020-12-01 10:31:07 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @dougducey @SecretaryHobbs @GeneralBrnovich How much did they pay you? What did they give you? I think you may be going to jail.
1333599016416841734 2020-12-01 10:29:17 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JodyBelcher7 @Repulican4U @realDonaldTrump We have to fight both paths and we have to fight for the GOP right now and the Senate. They are supporting Trump and trying to win the Senate.

1329247871988862976 2020-11-19 10:19:23 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Ay4nyc @AbrahamAiyash We agree people should not be disenfranchised and they could not come up with the right count or figure out what were legal votes and illegal votes That's why they wanted to not certify it and have it go to a different remedy. Abraham is the one who disenfranchised Trump voters
1329245893707567106 2020-11-19 10:11:31 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JPughMI Yes it's always the Trump supporters that are out burning looting beating stabbing and killing You're an idiot! I think people are just pissed off that we're finally standing up for ourselves &amp; fighting back the legal with lawyers and courts. We are done taking liberals BS
1329245208957972481 2020-11-19 10:08:48 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JPughMI @AbrahamAiyash here you guys go again trying to scare her by mentioning a pack that she's in which is not against the law and it's not even a pack So get your story straight. She is hired a lawyer and she's going to sue you

We call you a cheater for supporting this ridiculous voting and election fraud
1329244601958477825 2020-11-19 10:06:23 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MikeR_SH @AbrahamAiyash @GOP It was done right after another woman clearly said that they are all going after them to ruin their lives lose their jobs and he mentioned their children. Also accused them of being racist. It's bad all the way around and I can't believe you broke something and support of it
1329244054538903553 2020-11-19 10:04:13 +0800 <freethinkin2020> And we all saw it on video @AbrahamAiyash

1329210873584480257 2020-11-19 07:52:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @AllisonJoWinter @Wizard_Predicts Yes now all are legally responsible for fraud and once proven in court all four can face charges.

Decided to go to grad school that was my decision. I took on the debt &amp; I paid it back working two jobs sometimes when I first started out with my career. Many young people don't want to work job "below" them
1328906812989509635 2020-11-18 11:44:08 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MerrillLynched @realDonaldTrump Except we are seeing the fraud exposed everyday

1328698585509220355 2020-11-17 21:56:43 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @paxtonkempf @EricTrump Do you think it's okay for people just to massively send out paper ballots where my husband received three I received two and we ended up voting in person or to people's homes that no longer live there with incorrect voter lists? Take the blinder off.
1328698077679640576 2020-11-17 21:54:42 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @ByrdEileen @EricTrump Actually the death right right now is .65% less than one percent. Go to the CDC. Yes positives are increasing so is the sensitivity of the test that they're using but less people are dying
1328697816752021508 2020-11-17 21:53:40 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @GaryHudnall1 @EricTrump @Insertnameplea That's our system

1328697455110664197 2020-11-17 21:52:13 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @aliza_chaya @EricTrump That's why a voter ID in person when you vote is very important

1328670982060593152 2020-11-17 20:07:02 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @SyntaxWhiplash @FrankLuntz Why do recent college grads get it. What about my three kids that are in college now? Do they get it too? Where do you stop? When I got out of college There was no jobs It was 1992 It was a nightmare a bunch of kids with college educations and no job market. We survived

1328668036912517121 2020-11-17 19:55:20 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Featherskill @FrankLuntz Yes if I go on a spending spree or buy a car I can't afford or house I can't afford Can I just take 50 grand off?

Now I have three kids that we are paying for college right now and they will pay their loans off

1328659892727656448 2020-11-17 19:22:58 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @conservmillen Plumbers make way more than that especially where I live just to get them to show up it's 150 bucks. Then they get paid about $100 an hour per job and a lot of times in cash. Most plumbers in CT that I know have big beautiful houses drive really nice cars pools etc. All paid for!

1328131109889118209 2020-11-16 08:21:46 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @WalpurgaMueller @realDonaldTrump Biden exposed CIA agents and slipped up with classified info that got Navy Seal Team 6 slaughtered
1328130747610378247 2020-11-16 08:20:20 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @CBove1 @realDonaldTrump Bolton is and was a warmonger that has like Joe been wrong on every situation and public policy. Name one where either one got it right. Not 1. In both of their looooong careers. Pathetic
1328130121568575488 2020-11-16 08:17:51 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump This is the stupidest article I've ever heard Obama administration AKA Biden's caused this company to leave but Trump had just become President and He couldn't get a private company to come back immediately so they're voting for Biden. Who caused them to leave in the first place
1328129485292580868 2020-11-16 08:15:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Many Trump fans have Master's too. Since literacy rates in Dem run cities I'm going to guess that Trump fans are above them in education. Can have it both ways. Are you the party of the people or party of elites that knows what's best for everyone else
1328128735321710593 2020-11-16 08:12:20 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Therewasnofraud @DraftTulsi @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump He always said wear masks in public! You guys just didn't listen to him. You just listen to cut pieces of video that MSNBC and CNN fed to you he also said if you're out in the sun and outdoors you don't have to wear one.
1328127933165281282 2020-11-16 08:09:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Just wait Biden will do nothing different. What Trump did - moved heaven &amp; Earth in 6 months to get the medical advances, treatments, testing, &amp; vaccine is a miracle. It took 1 year to develop a detection test for AIDS and 1984-1997 to treatments that reduced death rates by 47%.

It was back in April and it was to help the homeless because they didn't have enough funds in New York City to do it themselves! Facts matter
1326951179960659968 2020-11-13 02:13:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @rcsutton @chrislhayes Willie cuz we're the most deaths have happened are in Democrat run states with governors that refused help from Trump's administration. They also put in policies of putting positive people into adult homes sick! They also adopted a policy in the hospitals to ventilate people.
1326950859679412224 2020-11-13 02:11:53 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @chrislhayes What? Chris I thought that Biden was going to part the seas and destroy the disease. Get everybody back to school and restaurants and their lives. It was going to depart from Trump's protocols and make everything better magically with his amazing plan!

1326565009783218177 2020-11-12 00:38:39 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Great example of the inclusive unified democratic party welcoming the right with open arms. What a vitas pieces of shit  https://t.co/KIS8rY8E7M
1326564265906548736 2020-11-12 00:35:42 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MGsquared @NBCNews Okay request one cuz we'd be happy to open up the books and let you go through every single vote. That's a difference in transparency of our parties We're confident that Trump won I don't know if you are confident that you are candidate won. Looks like we soon will find out
1326563958954790919 2020-11-12 00:34:28 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @NBCNews @HalseyXT Oh thank you NBC News We're telling us something we knew on election night!!!
1326563835118034944 2020-11-12 00:33:59 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @PinkNews @PinkNewsAction You may have gotten that wrong a little bit since Trump appointed the first openly gay cabinet member! @RichardGrenell

Just tell Americans the truth that the Democrats did that some purpose please and then it's related to software ownership by big Dem party connections

1326526032623624192 2020-11-11 22:03:46 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This needs to be looked into. Don't concede
1326522313802731520 2020-11-11 21:48:59 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Yes!!!
1326522058348630016 2020-11-11 21:47:58 +0800 <freethinkin2020> What does everyone think
1326516076272898050 2020-11-11 21:24:12 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Boom!
1326515761364557824 2020-11-11 21:22:57 +0800 <freethinkin2020> If they did that then they lied and have to be arrested for perjury because there is now tape and there's tape of them interrogating him This is getting ugly or FBI is now compromised
1326514173354921984 2020-11-11 21:16:39 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Fake news just keeps playing their part. They hide info from viewers

1326502689908383745 2020-11-11 20:31:01 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Orwellian like the Media announcing Bride won before he really did or while he sits at 259 electoral votes
1326502381153103873 2020-11-11 20:29:47 +0800 <freethinkin2020> I keep hearing It's like everyone wanted Republicans except for Trump so that's the reason down ballot one but not Trump. I find it funny Dems love polls the one poll that they're going to ignore is that among Republicans Trump had 95% support (Gallup) so how could this be true.
1326502135731777536 2020-11-11 20:28:49 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JamesDeauxIV @AdamInHTownTX @Acosta I find it funny Dems love polls the one poll that they're going to ignore is that among Republicans Trump had 95% support (Gallup) so how could this be true.
1326501656402472966 2020-11-11 20:26:54 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JamesDeauxIV @AdamInHTownTX @Acosta I think you should look up weighted races and actually as you got into more Republican areas Trump lost on the top ballot It just doesn't make sense. It's proven algebraically You should look it up Dr Shivs explains it very clearly with actual data. Learn
1326500262752759809 2020-11-11 20:21:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @dvillella @realDonaldTrump No we have accepted it. The statical anomalies exist and we need answers as to why.
1326499839220256770 2020-11-11 20:19:41 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @realDonaldTrump @luvsthesun22 Show people the proof show them how the software glitches switched votes you've got to bring that out into the open!
1326486608544206848 2020-11-11 19:27:07 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Dago70_2 @camayusa1 This isn't the type of algorithm that they used They used something called weighted races see  https://t.co/fKe3XBSySE
1326484429016096769 2020-11-11 19:18:27 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Why what they congratulate him?
1326483665883443200 2020-11-11 19:15:25 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @WayneDupreeShow Who cares what this guy says!!
1326483059810635776 2020-11-11 19:13:00 +0800 <freethinkin2020> They blatantly lied!!! Why?

As for the pandemic check CDC numbers media is inflating the numbers without context
1326477557433249797 2020-11-11 18:51:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Michael07396637 @GrahamAllen_1 @realDonaldTrump Let me guess your Bernie bro that switch to Trump. By the way Bernie agrees with nothing Biden wants to do
1326477241132441602 2020-11-11 18:49:53 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump What is great about reentering the NWO and giving all of our money to countries that don't contribute themselves? Paris accord where we pay a lot of money to do what Trump did which is climate change legislation We have the cleanest air and water right now than ever in US
1326476867898142720 2020-11-11 18:48:24 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump He did. Turn the channel and learn. economy was made strong enough that we haven't plummeted in the stock market which would be very bad for everyone He's also done a lot for the black community Do your own research and find out cuz media has been lying to you for 4 years.

Biden only has 216

1326148933983346688 2020-11-10 21:05:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Yamiche @donwinslow Yes that should prove that there is fraud at the level of presidential voting. Split voting doesn't happen on mass they are unique. Also people do not en masse just vote for the president. You are making your own case that there was fraud

1323411302480515073 2020-11-03 07:46:56 +0800 <freethinkin2020> If anyone is watching the rally live right now there's a guy to the right of Trump that is laughing so hard and looking like he's having the best time. That's what we're all going to feel tomorrow if we all go to the polls and boat.
1323410200179675136 2020-11-03 07:42:34 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Hahahaha

1323398239526232064 2020-11-03 06:55:02 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump In 47 years tell me what Biden has done for the Hispanic community. That's absolutely zero!!! I can tell you that Trump has gotten you the lowest unemployment ever in history and he's also raised your family's income by $2,000
1323391293897265153 2020-11-03 06:27:26 +0800 <freethinkin2020> CT just rollback closures. Governor Lamont is closing restaurants even though the positive has come from kids etc and death rate is very low. This power grab has to stop.

1323253609920929794 2020-11-02 21:20:20 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @JoeBiden here's the problem Joe You haven't on the last day before voting explain to anyone how you're going to shut down the virus other than continuing anything that Trump is already doing. The only addition would be to shut down our economy add mask mandate and lock us in our homes

1323243890342809600 2020-11-02 20:41:42 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Why would Jewish people vote for Biden?
1323242079611461632 2020-11-02 20:34:31 +0800 <freethinkin2020> I hope Trump is aware of this and has taken care of it since 2015.
1323239596579295233 2020-11-02 20:24:39 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Magnusson32 @CNN No it's not true The lead car for Biden that white van tried to run the Trump supporter off the road It's in tons of videos captured by people if you check on Twitter. The American people solve the crime in two seconds with their videos. I'm not sure why @CNN can't investigate.
1323239259399139328 2020-11-02 20:23:18 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @AvernHope @CNN Hope If you see the video which other people have posted obviously which the FBI can find in 2 minutes it's actually the lead car is aggressive and attacks the Trump supporter. Again liberals being aggressive and dangerous

1323016065673297920 2020-11-02 05:36:25 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @RedPillMaC WTF does that mean????

Biden family are scumbags
1322633771393388544 2020-11-01 04:17:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Don't let this happen to us. Vote with your head not your heart.

1322561711619145728 2020-10-31 23:30:58 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @RealJamesWoods  I wish at one of these rally's the crowd would sing when he comes on stage lean on me when you need a friend. Trump is doing a lot of heavy lifting for American people We have to let him know that we have his back! He can lean on us and that we're there for him!!
1322554425278406657 2020-10-31 23:02:01 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @jcoralpark We have to make this such a wave of people that they do not even have a shot to question it

1322542730023763968 2020-10-31 22:15:33 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Except this is a lie because if you repeal Trump's tax cuts everyone's taxes go up a lot

Joe is compromised!

Trump opened the network and guaranteed timing to see a doctor and specialists. Faster approvals.  All very important!!! Big difference

1322252292247138309 2020-10-31 03:01:27 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Thinking the same thing.
1322252175054131202 2020-10-31 03:00:59 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Biden will hold China accountable!!! He literally just said that. 😂😂😂 Before saying Trump hates the Military while shouting angrily. does he understand that other than liberals who are crazy people that are screaming cry snowflakes. He said more military will vote for him😂
1322249489508433920 2020-10-31 02:50:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Joe Biden is lying on stage in Iowa saying that Trump has waved the white flag to the virus. He said that they lost jobs bc of Trump. Lockdowns will kill our economy. We wear masks everywhere! Mask mandate just allows you $ for states in fines. Your plan is not different.
1322242413381984256 2020-10-31 02:22:12 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @bocomer1 @CNNTonight @cthagod Except for Biden lied He had a supermajority for the from 2009-2011 and could have done anything he wanted. Obama and Biden did NOTHING.
1322240484367048704 2020-10-31 02:14:32 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Texden1975 @greg_donath @CNNTonight @cthagod Trump is the only Pres that has not brought us to war in decades. He also implemented four programs in three and a half years with Platinum Plan to benefit the black community. He funded HBCUs so they didn't have to go back to beg the Dems year after year for money.
1322238471696715776 2020-10-31 02:06:32 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Samedra_writes @CNNTonight @cthagod I agree with you but minority communities have done much better over the last three plus years under Trump than ever before under Democrats leadership. Joe Nancy Schumer all of them have been there for over 5 decades and they have done nothing. I want all Americans lifted up
1322236747238035458 2020-10-31 01:59:41 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @NeonNettle Their faces tell it all.

Testing etc stays the same. So think bigger. How many deaths have been caused by these lockdowns?

Have friends in hospitals there that confirm that is the case BTW
1322224425740152832 2020-10-31 01:10:43 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This is fake news. So no one died of lung disease, cancer, strokes etc during this time frame. All Covid deaths. Doctors please come out and expose the real truth

1322222921973190661 2020-10-31 01:04:44 +0800 <freethinkin2020> The lie around the world that Covid is the number killer. The disinformation fear-mongering press needs to be held accountable!
1322222323525734400 2020-10-31 01:02:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MugShutter @StLuGal @Craig_A_Spencer Break it up by age. When you put a bunch of positives Covid patients in with a vulnerable population in 5 states it does skew the numbers alot. 84% of the deaths reported was a result of that happening.

1321234062959403008 2020-10-28 07:35:22 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Proximo56521217 @Hoosiers1986 @ohiogop But if you vote red and Trump wins then maybe they will feel empowered to start fighting back I think some are scared to fight back they don't know if the polls are true about Biden or how Americans feel. Trump needs the support to get things done!
1321232929356480516 2020-10-28 07:30:52 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @CottoGottfried @unseen1_unseen No he's not being honest he's trying to get you guys comfortable with Salome messages that she will be president. This is the case he should let the American people know before they go put the lever for "him"
1321231839860850691 2020-10-28 07:26:32 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @MajorPatriot Have you noticed that Clinton and Biden are all taking Trump's strength and trying to adopt them like fight sex trafficking. They are sick ppl. Trying to deflect their corruption and participation

Go educate yourself about what you candidate actually stands for search the internet and go to the third page of Google because big tech is buried it but you Biden is not a good person. Terrible policies that hurt many especially minorities. His H1N1 response.🙄

Giving it back to us and not the swamp. a cover of all of their miss doing they lie they cheat and they steal for one another and by the way it's our money they are stealing and our families and our communities they are destroying!
1321227294850035714 2020-10-28 07:08:28 +0800 <freethinkin2020> No don't trust the polls. People actually look up information now like in this article you lie three times. Example: Trump's statements in Charlottesville. People just Google it  pull up the video and watch for themselves that he didn't say anything racist  https://t.co/ryHhxnO6eW

1321055340100751360 2020-10-27 19:45:11 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @FaxProfessor @LouDobbs Agreed and Trump is doing that. But while he's doing that he is making us energy independent while we build up our green energy Obama and Biden sent all of the manufacturing for green to other countries That's the problem.
1321054959241175040 2020-10-27 19:43:40 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @beatraxa @LouDobbs Trump invests in solar and wind look it up He's just not cutting off the spicket of oil and implementing green technology without having income for the people who currently work in the industry
1321054822393696256 2020-10-27 19:43:08 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @beatraxa @LouDobbs You can do both at the same time and that's what Trump's talking about.
1321054661282009091 2020-10-27 19:42:29 +0800 <freethinkin2020> This is what the election comes down to and everyone needs to see this video! Couple this with high taxes it's a recipe for disaster for our economy. If you don't like Trump's attitude or as a person who cares you got to love your family and country more than you hate Trump.
1321052975989743617 2020-10-27 19:35:48 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @dangainor @georgiotesta Agree. You can't. That why people are leaving NYC too

1320892624744652801 2020-10-27 08:58:37 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @DodgersFanPG Boating is a working mans hobby. Tons of friends have boats &amp; they are not extremely rich people. If you live on a coastal town you have a boat &amp; you never buy a boat new unless you are Uber rich. Most buy used bc it loses half its value of the minute you put it on the water

No one talks about death rate doesn't matter if you get a cold or asymptomatic and have it. Death rates are the reason we shut down the US

I'll vote for Trump who helped  all Americans financially and wrote 3 peace treaties and helped the black community

But in good conscience I camp over somebody who watches his son destroy his granddaughter and knew that he sexually molested her and did nothing. I'm joking do that to his own family He has no problem doing worse to all of us.

He talked to the community and listened and acted. He knew where his polls have been. Biden never bothered. He assumed he had their support
1320516395143172102 2020-10-26 08:03:37 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Almijisti @Rasmussen_Poll @nmlinguaphile @POTUS Everyone has a phone these days and can look up truth They no longer are just tuning in to MSNBC and CNN for their fake news. They're searching  for themselves. Internet has videos of Biden &amp; Trump history.  When Van Jones is saying that Trump did very good anything is possible!
1320514768524972036 2020-10-26 07:57:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Rasmussen_Poll @POTUS I actually hope it's true because maybe we can all move forward togethe. Prosperity, peace, and equality for All Americans  This makes me so happy!!! I had Hope it would have happened under Obama but it didn't. Maybe with Trump we can.

1320511233427202049 2020-10-26 07:43:06 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @kingRio @AhmedBaba_ The other thing he did was he set his son up with foreign entities and would take a portion of the payment proven by Hunter Biden's partner that is in jail that gave $26, 000 emails and his other business partner that showed proof that Joe Biden was getting 10%
1320511043102265344 2020-10-26 07:42:21 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @kingRio @AhmedBaba_ Here's what Joe Biden did He got in text from his son about sexual abuse that he was doing to Joe Biden's granddaughter who was 14 years old and Bo Biden's daughter There are pictures of them laying together naked.

1319637336787980289 2020-10-23 21:50:33 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @republicatrisk @JoeBiden Middle class families in red states have actually expanded their median income for the year. not much of a zinger only for those in California and New York where people were already voting for Joe Biden.
1319637108118769664 2020-10-23 21:49:38 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @DdltDee @JoeBiden I bet your husband voted for Trump but just told you he did. So you wouldn't get mad at him. Someone has to save your family's financial picture.

Why would a sitting VP of the US get involved in a personnel issue in a foreign country of a state prosecutor at the tune of 1 Billion dollars?

He has properties all over the world and no a hotel is not something that would influence him to sell out the American people.

FBI covered up spying on Trump's campaign. They lie about his words denowning white supremacy, kkk, and David Duke.  Media lies to the American people blatantly about his policies. They protect Biden.

1314575938244534272 2020-10-09 22:38:21 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Democrats have jumped the shark! Pelosi holds press conference on bill that would allow Congress to oust Trump from office via 25th Amendment   https://t.co/ddCyhRUCrE

1314564375336845312 2020-10-09 21:52:25 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @kanyewest @ChatChristi How do they determine the order of the ballot. Should the current President or incumbent be on top?

Where are your articles and insightful hard-hitting journalism when it comes to Obama Biden and our intelligence on American citizens and election campaign and a president!!!
1314530079712706560 2020-10-09 19:36:08 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @BernieTatro @buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump They spied on him, private citizens, media, and election campaign.  Used our intelligence as a weapon this should scare and anger both sides of the aisle. Everyone should want justice. If roles were reverse people would be in jail. This is an America issue not 2 party issue

Republicans listened to their president that said wash hands, social distance, and wear face coverings when you go out until we know more. Also outside the virus dies quickly so go for walks etc.

Why would you invoke the 25th amendment if voting is 27 days away and you're so sure that you are ahead in the polls? Because...they are not.
1314304325582233610 2020-10-09 04:39:04 +0800 <freethinkin2020> How can they blame this militant group that felt like they could capture a governor take over territory set up courts on President Trump when the Dems allowed this to happen in Chaz. Lack of law and order by the Gov. Toward antifa creates a void and people will fill it
1314255807069007875 2020-10-09 01:26:16 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @paulegan4 They are an anti government group. More libertarian not right wing. Although they call it eig wing in the article. No group should attack anyone or any group that they don't agree with and violence is wrong!!
1314252237611372547 2020-10-09 01:12:05 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @jasondogwood Don't make assumptions. Bernie's boys and Antifa are not happy with her either.

1314190795856109569 2020-10-08 21:07:56 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @Rasmussen_Poll I said that too Trump never called him a name once and Biden called him many very bad names and was a angry old man acting like a jerk. But if media says the same thing over and over again it becomes new reality.
1314190445258379268 2020-10-08 21:06:33 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Then the VP debate was important and Kamala failed miserably
1314187412285911048 2020-10-08 20:54:30 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Breaking people's windows? How does that further their cause.

1314183200143441920 2020-10-08 20:37:45 +0800 <freethinkin2020> See the liberals are using their old playbook They are trying to create a story a narrative pulling on heartstrings The only problem with that is they do not live in fact not one thing she said last night was true. Not even Honest Abe comment!
1314182771796062210 2020-10-08 20:36:03 +0800 <freethinkin2020> Where are the fact checkers I'm not!!!! @MSNBC  @CNN

She did not tonight she acted like a teenager. Most women that are an executive positions like myself find the narrative about weak women and talking down to us is BS because we see ourselves as equals

1314158075964796929 2020-10-08 18:57:55 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @jmbenson1491 Even my children knew how the virus was transmitted and what to do in January because we actually listened to President Trump The other ones don't listen to him &amp; that's their fault They were too busy making fun of him and trying to impeach him to actually listen to his warnings
1314157694950019073 2020-10-08 18:56:25 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @WayneDupreeShow Actually an important question to ask because Harris would be at the helm and that should scare us all.
1314157346298494977 2020-10-08 18:55:01 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @GroveKilosdad73 All you have to do is look at Nancy Pelosi's bill and you can see exactly what their agenda will be. Raise taxes free healthcare for immigrants socialized medicine limit our rights under the second amendment make everything PC no more freedom of expression

Also if everyone was tested and we realized what all the positives are the fatality rate would be lower

It is now in America a lot of us have either already had it or will have it and currently right now even with questionable numbers there's a 3% death rate. That might even be lower if everyone was tested. New reality. Can't live in fear.

Why is a white supremacist who started Charlottesville supporting and endorsing Biden? Why is a black leader of proud boys supporting Donald Trump if it's supposedly a white supremacy group? Start questioning your leaders and asking real questions.

They're hoping that you are not smart enough to read the semantics or wordsmithing Trump paid $750 in federal income tax BUT The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150 million and paid $38 million in federal taxes.

Given Hunter past and lack of skill set it does past the smell test. Taking 3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow is breaking the law. Very different

They did it as fast as they could. The problem is the alternative is a person who did even worse (with that unit in place) with Ebola and swine flu response. Got lucky 60 mil people got swine in yr 1

How did the decision to send positive covid patients back to the nursing home get made. We knew at that point from the Italy experience data that it was affecting people 80 plus and diabetes why would they allow infected patients in the homes.

You being in pharma thinking about the coordination and logistics and timing it took to do everything that they did. I think impressive. Most drugs in trials for decades.

Less govt always better.

Kids do not die from this disease &amp; under 70 yrs of age survive. Actuary in healthcare that actually prices for very large carriers.

Putting a lid every other and some cases every morning for the last few weeks is not giving American people confidence he can do the job.

Another 16 during an election yr

So pick an accusation and let's discuss. Start with Charlottesville speech? Where everyone thinks he's a racist bc of it.

He was blocked from every coming again. Now I have seen a million pictures of top Dems with Epstein

That is no longer the American way of life. That is facist. So if over half the Americans or 53% have to fight to keep their liberty, freedom, &amp; protect their families. They will! Sad.

If you have a health condition then protect yourself and be really smart about it.  If you don't go about your life. Follow the science!!!

Can you see how that doesn't make sense? Millions of people living their lives and not dying.

Does your dad know that Biden also deferred many times for the same exact reason Trump did. You going to work him into a frenzy about that as well with lies that was confirmed by John Bolton that Trump didn't say it and he was with him the whole day.

1301136943607099394 2020-09-02 20:36:35 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @RichardKbach @BreitbartNews That statement isn't written quite right He wants to repeal the ACA but like Trump he believes in pre-existing conditions to stop twisting words

It's painfully obvious that the FBI lied and changed documents. One just pleaded guilty.

1301124073414590464 2020-09-02 19:45:27 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @jsoltan @marklevinshow Because they were threatening his son and remember he pleaded guilty to a crime that didn't happen and that has been proved didn't happen

1301114979391856640 2020-09-02 19:09:19 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @adair1946 @TeaPainUSA @MickDAmario Laurie as a speech therapist go back 10 years to Biden's speeches and please explain why He was able to compensate for more and be able to overcome challenges when he speaks and why he can't? Mental decline and you know that since your in the business.

1300832325345964037 2020-09-02 00:26:09 +0800 <freethinkin2020> @NBCNews So by this headline NBC are you saying because he was part of a pro Trump support group he deserved to die! Although he didn't provoke anyone, burn ,loot, or steal anything he is still at fault because of his beliefs and who he supports.
