Considering her and Joe‚Äôs campaign systematically cheated using central intelligence software and a voting algorithm. Hammer + Scorecard.

1325150286495805440 2020-11-08 02:57:03 +0800 <groypersmith69> @RealAPolitics This account truly has no idea what‚Äôs going on. This is obviously a college student tweeting. You realize that ruling was literally a reinforcement of the preexisting law right? I mean I‚Äôm a trump supporter but none of your tweets are based on facts.

1324852572428132359 2020-11-07 07:14:02 +0800 <groypersmith69> @prayingmedic since when have you been reliant on gov links for info to be legit?? You should return all of the money you have made off Q supporters. You are a liar and a shill.

1324827745499697158 2020-11-07 05:35:23 +0800 <groypersmith69> @NickJFuentes I totally agree. However, if we have any chance, the Trump campaign needs a smoking gun. None of these twitter anecdotes are powerful enough for court.
1324815481107337216 2020-11-07 04:46:39 +0800 <groypersmith69> @Boogie2988 Biden‚Äôs numbers are statistical impossibilities. It‚Äôs not deniable that the Dem‚Äôs cheated. Election results don‚Äôt matter....democracy does. If Biden wins democracy is over.

1311167226444222464 2020-09-30 12:53:21 +0800 <groypersmith69> @NMaterazzo I wish he was
1311149942128476160 2020-09-30 11:44:40 +0800 <groypersmith69> @ZoomerClips The fact that it‚Äôs contested means trump didn‚Äôt win....don‚Äôt you guys realize that. Trump was supposed to bury Biden.
1311149594764627969 2020-09-30 11:43:18 +0800 <groypersmith69> @CassandraRules Yes. The point of the debate wasn‚Äôt to get you amped, it was to amp up undecided voters! Trump galvanized the 43% of people that will vote for him!

1311148910652592128 2020-09-30 11:40:34 +0800 <groypersmith69> @RealCandaceO Which means trump lost
1311138576722165760 2020-09-30 10:59:31 +0800 <groypersmith69> @NMaterazzo The question will be do they value the strength of Trump or do they pity Biden.
