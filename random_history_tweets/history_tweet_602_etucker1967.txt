1333055786759516160 2020-11-29 22:30:41 +0800 <etucker1967> @Fight_Progress What you believe means little, compared to what is known to be true. Some people believe in Martians, doesn't mean that they exist.  Get over yourself, what you 'believe' does not dictate American values.
1332815549303119872 2020-11-29 06:36:04 +0800 <etucker1967> @Fight_Progress Mentally ill? If you believe being 'gay' is a mental illness, I suggest that you go back to school. Maybe once you've actually studied psychology, you'd learn that you display more mental illness, than someone who's only 'symptom' is being gay.
1332780183309348864 2020-11-29 04:15:32 +0800 <etucker1967> @Fight_Progress Wouldn't care. What does it matter? Exposing children to diversity allows them to grow into more accepting of others as adults. Something I think you lacked in your youth. Perhaps, it would have allowed you to see them as HUMAN beings, no different than yourself.

He's not young anymore, obviously, being as I am 53 y.o.  The thoughts of this are weighing on me today.

You had Jared send ventilators to Russia AFTER knowing of factual #RussianBounties. You will die in disgrace in a prison cell.

Because these RepubliCon's are anti-American, actually despise freedom, and fear they won't be able to use religions to maintain their political power.  https://t.co/IdjUMqgQtu
1327274248616902656 2020-11-13 23:36:55 +0800 <etucker1967> Remember when Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R) pushed for "No unfunded mandates?" I do.   It's time for "No mandates, no funding." It's NOT about "red" or "blue" states.  It's about HUMAN LIVES.  Red state governors reject Biden on mask orders  https://t.co/7GiCDAQxKx
1327262907650850818 2020-11-13 22:51:51 +0800 <etucker1967> I support a mask mandate, with ticketing and/or arrests for those refusing to comply.  If you have a condition that prohibits you from wearing a mask, then WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK are you doing out in public during a pandemic that causes the lungs to stop functioning properly?
1327261045556015107 2020-11-13 22:44:27 +0800 <etucker1967> Liar, liar, pants on fire.

1327216927907823616 2020-11-13 19:49:08 +0800 <etucker1967> Me. But, the üçäüçïüí© made covid a political issue and divided this country too much, for Americans to support the idea of coming together over ANY single cause.  I'm cynical, I know. It's been a long 4 years, with this last year feeling like 4 years, in and of itself.
1327215986391412736 2020-11-13 19:45:24 +0800 <etucker1967> @Kevswatching Yes. If Governors order a shutdown right now, for 2 weeks, with a mandatory mask mandate, we could have family gatherings on Thanksgiving, without putting everyone at risk.  But, the üçäüçïüí© has divided this nation too much, for Americans to come together in support of this.

You've totally discredited yourself with outright lies to pander to the #RepubliCon oligarch.  Go away. Your support of #TRE4ON (Jared sending ventilators to Russia during pandemic, AFTER Russian Bounties confirmed and made public) is sickening.

1321274783577731072 2020-10-28 10:17:11 +0800 <etucker1967> @GOP @realDonaldTrump The modern RepubliCon party is the antithesis of what Lincoln stood for. Comparing yourself to Lincoln, is assuming the ignorance of your supporters, that they have no understanding of history or how CONservatives left the Democratic party in the 1960s because of their racism.

And, the Secret Service's job is to protect the president from things you don't find funny? Damn. They really have expanded their law enforcement authority, since the üçäüçïüí© took office. ü§£ü§£ü§£
1304546347098411008 2020-09-12 06:24:21 +0800 <etucker1967> MAGAts are reporting my tweet to Secret Service and other law enforcement as "Stolen Valor" and a threat to the üçäüçïüí©. Seriously??   What in the actual fuck is wrong with these people? 'Cult' is such an understatement. I guess this is how the Benghazi investigations started?

1304542198361276416 2020-09-12 06:07:51 +0800 <etucker1967> @MollyJongFast Reading these things actually led me to feeling very sad. I began to tear up. Putin and his desire to destroy America by division and derision is really hurting otherwise caring, compassionate people.

MAGAts are reporting me for "Stolen Valor" because I have a picture of me in uniform during bootcamp on my profile and I clowned on Trump. Holy üí© these üçäüçïüí© supporters have become total snowflakes.   I served 2 enlistments one of which was during the Gulf War.

I served in the U.S. Navy for 2 enlistments, one of those aboard the U.S.S. Truxtun, CGN-35, in the Gulf War. Please, waste some taxpayer dollars asking that my claim be investigated.  We can call it TuckGhazi.ü§£ü§£

The way a question is phrased can provoke argument or connection:  Personally, I love Amy Winehouse's voice. One may disagree with my taste. But, cannot argue against my love of her voice.  But, if I write, "She has the best voice," I wonder how many will argue?
1302992565155766272 2020-09-07 23:30:10 +0800 <etucker1967> @Theresaroets911 Just sayin'. I love listening to Amy Winehouse. What I don't need is to debate whether she or Billy Holiday is the "greatest." Yes, seriously. Words make a difference. One connects, the other divides. Wouldn't your rather build connections?
1302991644459896833 2020-09-07 23:26:31 +0800 <etucker1967> @Theresaroets911 Question is subjective. To avoid "debate" and disagreement, would you be willing to phrase future tweets more along the line of "Who is your favorite singer of all time?" Then, I would be more than happy to share mine. No one can debate who MY favorite is. ;)

1301601906641362944 2020-09-04 03:24:11 +0800 <etucker1967> @UprightSiddy Yes. My happiness is not dependent on anything outside of my thoughts. Things outside of me can make life easier or more difficult to enjoy, but the happiness I have comes from appreciation, even if all I have is my last breath. I'll choose to appreciate it and die happy.üôÇ
1301601290321932293 2020-09-04 03:21:44 +0800 <etucker1967> @HelaoSouse Nope. No theaters, no dining out, no concerts, no sporting events, no large gatherings, no having a gaggle of friends over for a bbq. None of it, until the pandemic is actually over. Not worth endangering lives; mine, my loved ones, or even those who love üçäüçïüí©.
