1333852950276546568 2020-12-02 03:18:19 +0800 <LT_Misc> @OANN &lt;&lt; WHY do you post BOTH the words "LIVE" and "Happening NOW"?  The latter is not only redundant, but it hides the names of witnesses.
1333848077460004865 2020-12-02 02:58:58 +0800 <LT_Misc> @LadyPatriot777 @BadgerFan55124 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse @TheDemocrats @GOPChairwoman @GOP @DNC I am assuming that your Health, Bank, IRS, Amazon and similar online accounts have not been released to unauthorized persons.  The same process and security to authorized persons would exist when #EndingTheSecretBallot.  The debacle that we have in the 2020 election is abysmal.

1326750884160737285 2020-11-12 12:57:15 +0800 <LT_Misc> REJECT all records in which the birthdate is 1/1/1900 or 1/1/1901 because BOTH represent database values of ZERO as a date.  Additional ZERO dates are ones with 1553-01-01 or 01/01/1553.

1324050082455576576 2020-11-05 02:05:13 +0800 <LT_Misc> It proves that about 50% of Americans have no SENSE, or more plainly, are TOTALLY STUPID.
1324049367926538240 2020-11-05 02:02:23 +0800 <LT_Misc> @SackJD I am not so sure, Joe only praised Hunter ONCE that I can recall, Beau got praises at least once a month.

1323845765479964672 2020-11-04 12:33:21 +0800 <LT_Misc> @OANN  YOUR TV screen designers should LEARN something about better utilization of screen space when it shows only 2 pictures.  The numbers on the tabs should be MOVED into the open UNUSED space.

I agree that consumer staples should be OK (HD, LOWES, WMT, etc.)  I believe that commissions are high with commodities.  However, they are not in my 10 stock watch list, so I ignore them.
1301730558423203840 2020-09-04 11:55:24 +0800 <LT_Misc> @cnvcnx @joyinliberty I have heard of it, but it was so long ago that I would have to research it.  I believe (and do not know) that the commission costs are high.  NOTHING in investing is fool-proof.
1301729953357193222 2020-09-04 11:53:00 +0800 <LT_Misc> @cnvcnx @joyinliberty My differentiation is that I am willing to hold a losing stock trade until it comes back for a profit.
1301729720074149888 2020-09-04 11:52:04 +0800 <LT_Misc> @cnvcnx @joyinliberty Swing trading is SIMILAR to what I have been doing for about 5 years.  That is a new term for me, I have heard it called other names. For 2020, my profits are in a tie with the Dow. Usually, I beat the DOW, handily. I only trade 10 volatile stocks that I like and ignore others.

1301725796286038018 2020-09-04 11:36:29 +0800 <LT_Misc> @cnvcnx @joyinliberty Covered calls are good IF you are not an active trader.  IF the market tanks, one can close the position and open it again. One must keep in mind that commissions are higher than that of stocks.  I prefer straight stocks that I can buy or sell whenever I deem to be appropriate.

It does NOT work when she is in line to be USA President should, the POTUS and VP become incapacitated.  The last point would be useful for you.

When I started, the significance of EXPIRATION &amp; DEPRECIATING value were not fully explained to me,  At first, I "won" $5,000. Then, like an addicted gambler, I kept up my strategy until the money was ALL gone.   I do not use options any more.

I am doing in the process of doing this now. ===================================== Get into a 30%-50% cash position by taking profits.  If Hiden wins, do quick trades (buy the drop, sell when there is a slight profit.)
1301678128159481857 2020-09-04 08:27:04 +0800 <LT_Misc> SO WHAT?  She was shot by wild shots; the police were shooting at her boyfriend who thought that the police were thieves.
1301677029717430272 2020-09-04 08:22:42 +0800 <LT_Misc> @joyinliberty @cnvcnx My opinions ONLY.  When Trump wins, the stock market should go up within 1 - 3 days, if not on the 1st day.  If Hiden wins, LOOK out.   I would not buy until there are several big down days.
