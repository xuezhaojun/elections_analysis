1343192512765304837 2020-12-27 21:50:25 +0800 <lienomail> @swinton1943 Horizon is an EU wide programme, a rebranding of the previous framework schemes. As an associate member we will have a chunk to pay into the pot but no guarantee about how successful UK funding bids will be. That will be an EU decision, as will the particular areas of research
1343157935657070598 2020-12-27 19:33:01 +0800 <lienomail> @GeorginaMay2015 Read Clause 6  Page 1051 of the agreement published by the Government yesterday.
1343157255039049728 2020-12-27 19:30:18 +0800 <lienomail> @FreeGutenberg It's actually related to the Horizon scheme, a 70 billion Euro research and innovation programme that the UK will have to help fund.  And, according to Ben Habib, also includes EU Joint Defence planning and Military Integration.

1343140789178822656 2020-12-27 18:24:53 +0800 <lienomail> I'm hearing that Boris insisted on a specific clause be included in the agreement before he would sign off on it. Apparently it's now been hidden from view to avoid embarrassing the person involved. It was a demand that the EU instruct Guy Verhofstadt to STFU for ever #WheresGuy

1342652669115183104 2020-12-26 10:05:16 +0800 <lienomail> @jgoffshore @PlasFron James ! You are singing the same song that I’ve been singing for a while. We don’t have the capacity that we did have (5,500 boats less than the 70’s) but the agreement suggests we only take back control of some of our fishing over 5.5 years, and the EU continue with the rest
1342643020697579520 2020-12-26 09:26:55 +0800 <lienomail> @AnneSmi72007257 Indeed !  And thank you, with the same good wishes right back at ya!

1342635143585009665 2020-12-26 08:55:37 +0800 <lienomail> Thanks to @PlasFron. I’ve read this just once &amp; I’m almost tempted to say it’s WTO++++ But 2 things: Fisheries: I don’t think we get back full control. Union Programmes:  looks like we keep sending money for participation, but it doesn’t work the other way  https://t.co/GnaYhSa9qW

Out of the worlds top 50 Universities, 14 are in the US, 7 are in the UK, and none are in the EU. Time for UK students to broaden their outlook and enjoy the world.

I just heard that there has been significant changes to the 'species specific' aspect of the old CFP.

1342047426799161344 2020-12-24 18:00:15 +0800 <lienomail> Looks like the deal is now delayed due to a disagreement over some of the small print on fishing.

That we are 5,500 boats short of what we had in the 70's &amp; it will take 10 years &amp; a lot of Government support to get back to that position again. We currently don't have the capacity to fill our needs

Making preparations for something you might be forced to do if negotiations fail is not a breach under any law. Not even under the ECJ biased system.

Default on 31/12 means no WA and therefore no £39 billion.  https://t.co/cVQ6jn1Qiu

UK trade with EU is 8.2%

Further piece of education, Brexit is a two way street, so always look in both directions.  https://t.co/61AvwwmWnt  Enjoy your tea!  It goes well with remainer tears.

Every country in the world has a different metric for determining their numbers. My most reliable source is  https://t.co/0YXEl7yi5M which records the actual numbers declared by each country. So the number quoted is owned by Germany alone.

But the UK will become the EU’s biggest market in 2021 because we will sell direct to the US which reduces EU sales there by €374 billion

I thought your original tweet was telling me that Maoris were not indigenous to New Zealand because they originally came from Polynesia. My point was that the first settlers in any land are the indigenous people, and the Maoris were the first in NZ

Ignoring the fact that UK/Mex balance of trade favours Mex, the UK also invested £8 Biln into Mex businesses last year alone. That's a big deal for Mex to let go

For 4 years you've been saying that the UK will never get a deal with other countries as good as what we had through the EU. And yet we now have agreements in place, with further opportunities to improve them in the future. Remoaners are all in reverse
1338981403040641034 2020-12-16 06:56:58 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr @USAmbUK @trussliz @tradegovuk @tradegovukUSA Well they were still talking this afternoon so I guess we'll see how that goes over the next 5 weeks. But the UK is the USA's 5th largest export market at $70 billion so there's incentive enough to get a deal done.
1338978270222708737 2020-12-16 06:44:31 +0800 <lienomail> @thanksEU4_0 If you are refering to the thread where that tweet was posted, we were discussing the fact that Biden had been a politician for 47 years and yet had done very little of note, other than take his seat on the gravy train

How about all the countries in Africa or Middle East. You don't get to pick and choose the meaning of indigenous just to support your racist agenda. Envy is soooo ugly.

Now you’re suggesting we can improve on that next year. What made you change your mind?  Or are you losing it with WTO pending in two weeks?

Maybe a small win in court is all they need to trigger the National Emergency
1337899045952638976 2020-12-13 07:16:04 +0800 <lienomail> Right on the heels of Brexit, it’s possible we could see Texit. Huge enthusiasm for Texas to secede from the Union. And there could be more States following.  https://t.co/XqNMMCSWeU

1337398742954160128 2020-12-11 22:08:02 +0800 <lienomail> @matthewbrumby @2Purplestones I believe that means the EU will apply tariffs to U.K. beef and cheddar that is shipped to the EU which makes them uncompetitively priced, in order to protect their own cheese and beef producers.   Nobody puts tariffs on goods they are selling to another country.
1337343571490463747 2020-12-11 18:28:48 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl Neither the Vets rally nor the Brexit celebration event were provocative in any way, but the police reaction was. I was there Ian on both occasions and witnessed with my own eyes elderly and respectful men and women being violently manhandled by over officious coppers
1337331809303080961 2020-12-11 17:42:04 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl The police behaved appallingly on the veterans march and also at a London Brexit rally. Both long before Covid was ever dreamed of. They have since ramped up the aggression even higher against certain sectors. They come tooled up to some events, but wear dancing shoes for others
1337317919680831488 2020-12-11 16:46:52 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl I take your point Andy, but having twice been on the receiving end of over zealous policing, when compared to how they respond to other lawbreaking sections of our society, you will forgive me for not sharing your ‘even handed policing’ beliefs.
1337311489858957315 2020-12-11 16:21:19 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl Sorry!  That’s probably because there are too many to mention. But just to select one, purely because it happened under the same WM Police watch, how about the threatening of a mother and child with a machete? That’s the sort of stuff I’d like to see being policed vigorously.
1337305293869477888 2020-12-11 15:56:42 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl Because they continually and conspicuously ignore crimes where the people believe the law should be enforced. Two tier, virtue signalling policing has destroyed the respect they once enjoyed.

1336822254642970624 2020-12-10 07:57:17 +0800 <lienomail> Breaking news.   Arizona throws it's weight behind the Texas Law Suit. That's now a total of 16 States supporting this case.

1336734196568633344 2020-12-10 02:07:22 +0800 <lienomail> @ShaGGy_Uk Suspended also

I think the claim is that these states were in breach of the written Constitution by their localised changes to electoral process and as such were usurping the principles of the same free and fair election for all qualified US voters

As both Rigby and Burley have said many times, it's one rule for them, and a different rule for the rest of us
1336692545271820288 2020-12-09 23:21:51 +0800 <lienomail> @kerrydixon11111 The hard evidence is writ large in that those States acted in contravention of the US Constitution which is a breach of federal law. There is no denying that fact, but their defence is that they had to do that because of Covid. Many other States did not follow that path.

1336429067160199171 2020-12-09 05:54:53 +0800 <lienomail> @thanksEU4_0 Agreed Ken, the only problem we face is rebuilding the fleet back to capacity. It's hard to believe but we are more than 5,500 boats short of what we had before joining the CFP. It'll take a decade to get back to that without massive support from the government

But they'd need to have a full manifesto and be able to challenge for almost every seat in a GE, otherwise it's just a wasted vote, as well as a waste of time. Half measures don't work in politics, it has to be all in, or nothing.

1336368757573373957 2020-12-09 01:55:14 +0800 <lienomail> @Raj_5harma Me too, otherwise I’m gonna get a lot of negs on here 😂😂

1336364892140531714 2020-12-09 01:39:53 +0800 <lienomail> It looks pretty watertight no matter what the defence, so if all goes well it could al be over by Christmas with a re-run ordered at worst.

Genuine speech impediment is an affliction that I suffered as a kid due to the circumstances of my upbringing. Bumbling means confused or disorganised. A mistake ridden underachiever

1335390567669370885 2020-12-06 09:08:16 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean Export/Import is a two way flow, but with the imbalance of trade being in favour of the EU, there will be many more lorries stuck on the EU side of the Channel, which is motivation enough for the French authorities to sort it out very quickly, or face the anger of French truckers
1335389014912798724 2020-12-06 09:02:06 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean Hahaha!  Undercutting wages is not a winning option in any trade war.
1335388446966296581 2020-12-06 08:59:50 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean They can stamp their feet all they want after we've left, but it won't make any difference. We are out of their Ponzi Scheme and they have no control over what the UK decides to do in the future
1335353331049492480 2020-12-06 06:40:18 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean We clearly have a problem with you misunderstanding my replies. None of my Danish clients seem to experience that problem, so I'm guessing it's you
1335352306938884097 2020-12-06 06:36:14 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean Russia is not opting out, they are not members. But the EU would not dare  try the same tactic if ever there were trade  negotiations  between the two
1335351706134212613 2020-12-06 06:33:51 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa No doubt many of them are Ms B
1335351362327093249 2020-12-06 06:32:29 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean I tried my best to explain in Danish so that you wouldn't be confused. I know Russia ard not EU members.  My tweet suggested that if the EU and Russia were negotiating a Trade Agreement, the EU would not try to apply the same rules based on your theory of closeness.
1335350336131915783 2020-12-06 06:28:24 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean You are quoting the BBC Henrik. We in the UK know to ignore anything they say.  Any quota sharing was based on the allocations decided under the CFP, which is now nul and void since the UK is no longer a member. Fish in UK territorial waters, belong to the UK.
1335349026716332040 2020-12-06 06:23:12 +0800 <lienomail> @br_nning @Fabu_Bean Tror du, de ville prøve den samme taktik med Rusland, hvis de nogensinde prøver at forhandle en handelsaftale med dem. Det er bare den samme nærhed, men på den østlige grænse. det er afpresning, og du ved det

1335326939981230083 2020-12-06 04:55:26 +0800 <lienomail> Couldn't agree more Jackie, we have so much to offer the world once we are free from the yoke of EU bureaucracy
1335325348054110211 2020-12-06 04:49:06 +0800 <lienomail> Sky News, We know how you love to lean towards the EU in reporting these negotiations, but how about mentioning, just once that the three 'sticking points' are actually EU demands on the UK that they have never asked for in any other trade deal. EVER !    https://t.co/CEeIAduGEY
1335315846844059648 2020-12-06 04:11:21 +0800 <lienomail> @satex @Michael7215 Please explain what that has to do with the figures above ? In case you were unaware Germany is a member of the EU and the export totals shown for the EU include those of Germany, along with the other 27.
1335275417444474892 2020-12-06 01:30:42 +0800 <lienomail> Another valid point to add which is not included in the above figures is the value of British Tourists to the remaining 27 members of the EU. That amounted to Euro 38.7 billion in 2019.
1335271782761291777 2020-12-06 01:16:15 +0800 <lienomail> 2/2 The sources of the largest incoming 'investments' into the EU are: 1, Cayman Islands  83.9 2. Bermuda 76 3. Hong Kong  58.1 4. Barbados  47.7
1335271780798312450 2020-12-06 01:16:15 +0800 <lienomail> Another interesting EU fact The flow of EU overseas 'investment' shows (in Euro billions) 1  US  92.1 2. Bermuda 53.9 3. Barbados 39.4 Followed by, Isle of Man, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Iceland &amp; Mexico.  No wonder the accounts never get signed off. 1/2
1335264720832655367 2020-12-06 00:48:12 +0800 <lienomail> @bencorke Exactly ! As I said, a 90 billion Euro incentive for them to see sense and negotiate reasonably.
1335264145772601346 2020-12-06 00:45:55 +0800 <lienomail> Should have added that both China and the USA do not have Trade Agreements with the EU, they only trade with them under WTO Rules. If that is to be our future relationship with Brussels, so be it.
1335260973834366976 2020-12-06 00:33:18 +0800 <lienomail> Here's why the EU will eventually agree a genuine FTA with the UK  TOP 3 in Euro's EU Exports (Sales) 2019 1. UK -  426 billion 2.

Same story in every democracy in the world. Even those without democratic elections didn't mention it, with the possible exception of China who maybe had a tip off 😉
1335247416522661889 2020-12-05 23:39:26 +0800 <lienomail> @Ella32823623 @Tonysmi91701776 Yep I get what you are saying, but the vote was only predicated on EU membership, nothing at all to do with us being a European Country. If you don't like ECHR, I guess you don't like NATO or the UN, or even The Commonwealth and many other International bodies we are part of.
1335245999594463234 2020-12-05 23:33:48 +0800 <lienomail> There's something weird happening with Christian Churches all around the world that causes them to suddenly self ignite.  Another one of those great unsolved mysteries I guess

But first we need a very different style and philosophy to be in control of the Government. 2024 elections may see the first new shoots emerging.
1335237437447135232 2020-12-05 22:59:47 +0800 <lienomail> @Ella32823623 @Tonysmi91701776 Don't confuse ECHR with the EU's CFR.  The ECHR was originally drafted by Churchill, Mitterrand &amp; Adenauer along with other parties in 1948. It is a European Law, supported by all 47 members of the Council of Europe, and is a completely different legal system to that of the EU.

1334542548141006849 2020-12-04 00:58:32 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry I was discussing the same thing with someone on here a couple of weeks ago. I no longer see tweets from a lot of folk that I’ve enjoyed tweeting with in the past. I think Twatter are controlling who we each interact with. I only see some guys I follow when thyr RT’d in a thread.
1334530026646212610 2020-12-04 00:08:47 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry Hahaha !  I get you.  It would blow every other option out of the water.
1334525842488254467 2020-12-03 23:52:09 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry Further thought on this, the 2024 US and UK Elections would align perfectly in November '24. An opportunity that would not present itself again for decades.
1334524653419847683 2020-12-03 23:47:26 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry Very true!  Good shout 👍

In fact here in the US there's lots of talk that Trump may start up such a Party for the 2024 run. People are talking about 'America First Party' or 'MAGA Party' and I can see the groundswell of support for that already MGBGA Party anyone ?
1334522010957983748 2020-12-03 23:36:56 +0800 <lienomail> Media sycophancy is the main reason she avoids criticism. One day they'll grow tired and switch to supporting a different lefty lost cause.
1334521318281187328 2020-12-03 23:34:11 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry @linfoxlf @NKrankie Sure, I know that buddy. I was meaning Linda's settings.  Sorry, I should have made that clear.

I won't be throwing any more money away unless it's to a party with a full manifesto that I can get behind. But any serious grouping has got four more years to get their act together, so lets see how that plays out
1334519613724499969 2020-12-03 23:27:24 +0800 <lienomail> @art82071363 Thank you for your informed opinion, I have filed it under 'Anti Trumpers BS' By the way, it's grifter not drifter. I think that was more historically related to Ben E King
1334518615828291585 2020-12-03 23:23:26 +0800 <lienomail> @MarzipanRug Remarkable isn't it ! And yet if this were some floozy making allegations against Trump from 30 or 40 years ago it would be proclaimed, in banner headlines by the Media, as being testimony from the Virgin Mary herself.
1334517537506271235 2020-12-03 23:19:09 +0800 <lienomail> @realjohnhendry @UKLabour There will be some John that's for sure, but I think the vast majority of traditional Labour supporters are now more centrist in their views than the Marxist rabble in the Labour Party.  A new centre ground party would fill the void for both left and right disillusioned voters
1334515540589735944 2020-12-03 23:11:13 +0800 <lienomail> @linfoxlf @realjohnhendry @NKrankie I followed John again yesterday without a hitch.  Could it be that because your own account is locked you are getting this message ?

I can't decipher your opening line, it makes no sense to me. Other than that, in my opinion you do not appear to have any true Christian thoughts so I can only assume you are a hypocrite
1333891849011015684 2020-12-02 05:52:53 +0800 <lienomail> @stevegtweets Based on those figures there will be 30,000+ extra deaths this year

1333093362233204737 2020-11-30 00:59:59 +0800 <lienomail> @moonraker1000 @TraceyLockyer Yes! As with many research projects, out of adversity comes opportunity. Thalidomide failure was the result of a badly flawed trial protocol.

The only thing that is on the horizon to my certain knowledge is a microscopic nano-bot which (when developed) will , among many other options, seek out and destroy cancer cells in the blood stream, That will happen, but maybe not in my lifetime.

Some days it becomes quite tiresome and the misinterpretations do start to wind me up, but I’m always on board with your tweets, so I won’t be picking on you any time soon.  😊😊

This is a manipulation of the C19 Genome  to create DNA or RNA molecules that deliver ‘information’ to cells to produce antigens to stimulate the immune system. It’s 10 yr old tech but will be the 1st approval
1333074107705995268 2020-11-29 23:43:29 +0800 <lienomail> @RicsueadSmith Well Rick, many of us on here have been saying exactly that for the last four years. Walk away and they will come to the table
1333073126796746755 2020-11-29 23:39:35 +0800 <lienomail> @Evoqueist @sandieshoes @TraceyLockyer Trying to answer 2 tweets with 1 reply. I never said DNA. This is a Genetic Vax which uses mRNA to trick cells into acting ‘differently’. It is the future of vaccines but none have ever been approved. The original tweet was about the failure to adequately trial a new technology !
1333049677072232449 2020-11-29 22:06:24 +0800 <lienomail> @j2502ackie @TraceyLockyer Yep! Exactly what I said in my tweet 🙄. My point was about trial results and how they can be erroneous. And it’s not about data collection, sometimes the trial can be flawed from the very beginning. Thalidomide trialed for 5 yrs but not on pregnant women, the intended recipients
1333012841943740417 2020-11-29 19:40:02 +0800 <lienomail> @acts_17_11 @SteveMcGill52 Thanks 👍
1333010834491142147 2020-11-29 19:32:03 +0800 <lienomail> @Denise_Fleig @TraceyLockyer Just picking up on this again Denise, you are correct I don’t work in Pharma, but I do work in genetic and surgical related research. How many times have you seen trials being halted because something unexpected occurred, months or even years into the study. Just saying 😊
1333008681961656320 2020-11-29 19:23:30 +0800 <lienomail> @Denise_Fleig @Sprinter0712 @TraceyLockyer Sorry if you misinterpreted my intent, it was not to criticise you at all. I was merely pointing out what I believe is an indecent rush to validate these vaccines. My jaundiced eye tells me that the first to market will make a killing. Hopefully not literally.
1333007299661750273 2020-11-29 19:18:00 +0800 <lienomail> @RobertRees_ @PrincessofWails @TraceyLockyer That was not my point Rob. It was not appropriately tested at the time for it’s intended purpose, otherwise they would have realised after 9 months. The current vaccines as per Pfizer, have only been trialed for 60 days &amp; the AZ one only tested on under 55’s. That concerns me.
1333004416589369345 2020-11-29 19:06:33 +0800 <lienomail> @Cybeeria @sarahisitme It’s the @sarahisitme account that is locked, not mine. Frankly I don’t understand why those who lock their accounts ever join in debates on here, it makes no sense to me
1333003007672377344 2020-11-29 19:00:57 +0800 <lienomail> @Denise_Fleig @TraceyLockyer I know Denise, I work in biotech, which is why I am concerned about the unbelievably short timelines for the trials.
1332999295604301824 2020-11-29 18:46:12 +0800 <lienomail> @sarahisitme @Cybeeria Do you understand how RNA works?  It changes the cell process to influence protein production. Call it what you will, but it’s still genetic manipulation
1332996896449843200 2020-11-29 18:36:40 +0800 <lienomail> @mark1854now @tweetandshort @TraceyLockyer Exactly!  I would not put my signature to any trial that concluded after just two months.
1332996069828009984 2020-11-29 18:33:23 +0800 <lienomail> @sarahisitme @Cybeeria It’s late here &amp; I’m tired, so I’ve only scan read this, but I’m not sure what you mean by different. All the soon to appear vaccines are based on RNA gene manipulation, just like Thalidomide was. Yes dev has been going for 10+ years, but so far nothing has been approved for use.
1332992282514100232 2020-11-29 18:18:20 +0800 <lienomail> @Parkerbats Hahaha!  No, as a kid I was lucky to have any new clothes at all, let alone a Super Hero outfit.
1332991535739269120 2020-11-29 18:15:22 +0800 <lienomail> @Cybeeria Clearly not tested on the very patients it was intended to help, otherwise they would have realised it was a flawed drug after 9 months, let alone 5 years

1332987910967218176 2020-11-29 18:00:58 +0800 <lienomail> Rest in Peace Dave Prowse. 😞 I still remember first seeing you on TV when I was a little kid dressed as the Green Cross Code Man.  You were my first Super Hero. Stop, Look and Listen buddy, wherever you may be !
1332985547875360771 2020-11-29 17:51:34 +0800 <lienomail> @FredBasset9 @BernieVoice Yeah I realise that, but for every tweet related to Wuhan to disappear when there are hundreds covering other topics still remaining, is weird. Plus, old tweets were always available on the wayback machine, but sadly no more
1332984650780848130 2020-11-29 17:48:01 +0800 <lienomail> From now until the end of December, every time I see or hear folks telling me that 'Boris' is going to let us down, I'm going to think about yesterdays tweet from David Frost.  https://t.co/gsibAhoBBV
1332982679306985474 2020-11-29 17:40:11 +0800 <lienomail> @Georgiesaurus28 I don't think the wayback machine works for twitter any more. I've used Advanced Search using every metric I can think of, and also (foolishly🙄) scrolled back through my TL,  but there is nothing there
1332980358900568064 2020-11-29 17:30:57 +0800 <lienomail> @companyu @TraceyLockyer @PaulLeMay16 This is definitely not like your regular flu shot Malc. It is a huge leap forward in how vaccines have historically worked, by manipulating the genetic code. It is the future of vaccines but this will be the first approval, &amp; please note, the Pfizer trial only lasted two month.
1332976858107961344 2020-11-29 17:17:03 +0800 <lienomail> @TraceyLockyer Yep! Before my time but I have a friend who was born with severe deformities, which made me research it.
1332975827944869889 2020-11-29 17:12:57 +0800 <lienomail> @1ittlesanctuary Thanks for reminding me Helen. I knew I'd seen the question being posed, but I couldn't remember who it was.  I was bored tonight so I decided to check it out.
1332975175197974529 2020-11-29 17:10:21 +0800 <lienomail> @BernieVoice WOW!   Did you save them?  Mine were all attached to tweets which no longer exist in my account.

1332972996970078209 2020-11-29 17:01:42 +0800 <lienomail> @TraceyLockyer I am reminded of the drug Thalidomide which was insufficiently tested &amp; subsequently caused hugely devastating reactions in the 60's  That too worked on the principle of Gene manipulation, which resulted in a wide spectrum of birth defects.  Drug validations should not be rushed
1332963183171133440 2020-11-29 16:22:42 +0800 <lienomail> @Achinback1 Irrelevant!  Who has the right to enter your account and remove whatever they disagree with, no matter if it is true or not. That is only their opinion. Very few, if any of those videos were disputed at the time &amp; some were from work colleagues of mine in China who I do trust

1332960164723511296 2020-11-29 16:10:43 +0800 <lienomail> I've just spent a few hrs checking my old tweets after somebody asked where the videos from Wuhan had gone. I tweeted loads of them in Jan/Feb this year but now all those tweets have gone? I did find 2 but the vid links are dead 😡 Is this Twatter or the CCP doing the censoring?

1332467284170956802 2020-11-28 07:32:11 +0800 <lienomail> @Cheeseo76847269 I've thought the same for a while. There's probably less than 500 of the folks I follow that actually interact with each other, and I'm probably stretching it at that. Mighty weird
1332466359809282057 2020-11-28 07:28:30 +0800 <lienomail> This is Ontario Canada where the Barbecue Rebellion turned into a barbecue battle as supporters broke through the police lines so they could grab a BBQ brisket sandwich. Twenty three minutes of mayhem madness  https://t.co/jiNdx2Pqct

Here you go: Explain where's the common sense in 'we'll still continue to take your fish, but as a show of good faith well give you 15% to 18% back'  I'll wait !
1332433960471846916 2020-11-28 05:19:46 +0800 <lienomail> @woods1750 @christi73224817 You are ignoring the 'Common Customs Tariff' which all remoaners do. Goods imported by the UK from ROW were charged duty/tax rates set by the EU. The UK was then obliged to transfer up to 80% of that tax take to Brussels. Next year it would have been 90% as per the new EU budget
1332429965195939844 2020-11-28 05:03:53 +0800 <lienomail> @davesherwood87 @Chris_Rowe999 I'll try to explain in very simple terms. I asked a question of a tweeter in the main thread, the question is still there, unanswered, he replied to me via the OP, choosing not to reply directly to the question. I answered that tweet, and then you jumped in without knowing why.
1332428413370556429 2020-11-28 04:57:43 +0800 <lienomail> @Chris_Rowe999 @davesherwood87 Hahaha!  You can't even answer a question about your gender. Why do I waste my time with numpties on here.
1332428029910540290 2020-11-28 04:56:12 +0800 <lienomail> @davesherwood87 @Chris_Rowe999 Here's how it works David, the tweeter I responded to for some reason jumped out of the thread (Maybe to avoid the question) and instead replied to the OP. which is why you are only seeing two tweets. The question is there sure enough, in fact three times, but nobody has answered
1332426267598221312 2020-11-28 04:49:12 +0800 <lienomail> @Chris_Rowe999 @davesherwood87 Are you male or female Chris  If you are male then you fooled me, because you tweet like a big girls blouse

Jumping in without reading the entire thread, There is a question there that not one single smart arsed Europhile has answered, They only come back trying to deflect on to a different topic.

1332395048722423813 2020-11-28 02:45:08 +0800 <lienomail> @Chris_Rowe999 I'll ask you the same question that Ive asked other europhiles.  Explain the common sense in 'we'll still continue to take your fish, but as a show of good faith well give you 15% to 18% back'  I'll wait !

1332377824930508800 2020-11-28 01:36:42 +0800 <lienomail> @TheEnglishRebel Agreed, Italy.    The Italians pulling out would sink the EU. They are third largest contributor behind Germany &amp; France but in fact only half a billion behind France. It’s enough to tip the scales IMHO but France will not leave, nor will Poland who gain massively from EU grants
1332360830705393666 2020-11-28 00:29:10 +0800 <lienomail> NO ! Absolutely unacceptable. We've been charged £1 billion per month just for the privilege of trading with the EU,  which nobody else has ever had to do. Control of our seas is worth infinitely more than £140 million. We will decide the fees not the EU  https://t.co/nhrC3etuCj
1332359273788174340 2020-11-28 00:22:59 +0800 <lienomail> 2/2  We need to know exactly where the cancer is, &amp; we need a biopsy to determine the histology, before deciding on a treatment path. This diagnostic seeks out DNA fragments in the blood, but it does not help the Dr to find tumours, &amp; can cause great anxiety for unwary patients
1332359272257232898 2020-11-28 00:22:59 +0800 <lienomail> This is a very misleading article.. 20 years ago I was involved with a diagnostic blood test that recognised the presence of cancer as early as Stage 0 based on changes to blood proteins  In other words before any tumour could be seen. But doctors said, so what! 1/2 &gt;&gt;&gt;
1332350784751677444 2020-11-27 23:49:15 +0800 <lienomail> @sadcafe69 @Freeplanet7 You are talking about 'Facts' on twatter where no two people can discern fact from fiction. We only have opinions, and as I tried my best to explain to you, we all have different opinions and will twist them to prove our point.
1332346692583231488 2020-11-27 23:32:59 +0800 <lienomail> @confidencenac Nadia, I have long since given up on trying to make these haters see my point of view. I have come to the conclusion that they will still be offering the same tired old arguments twenty years from now. There are none so blind as those who will not see.

Yin and Yang as the Chinese say, one balances the other. All of us, based our perceived 'truths', quote another man's 'lies', but we will all stray from one side to the other in order to win an argument.

But ignoring your feeble attempt at an insult, I have two things to say: 1.  Hancock has been handed the impossible brief of trying to keep everyone happy whilst being guided by scientists &amp;  1/2 &gt;&gt;&gt;

Same in the UK, in the 2016 Ref. 48% of the population chose to go with the media narrative of EU good, UK bad. Unfortunately many still think that way

No matter if you love him or hate him, he has been handed the toughest Ministerial brief of any Politician in my lifetime. Nobody but nobody would want that gig, let alone make a success of it.

1331489222784667649 2020-11-25 14:45:43 +0800 <lienomail> @davemeehan1 Only just seen this Dave, I could have told you, it currently stands at  TA’s with 53 countries with another 26 due to be added in the next few days. Plus another 15 in advanced state of negotiation. We are doing pretty good compared with what all the europhiles predicted
1331486344611295234 2020-11-25 14:34:17 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass @Strath_FAI True! But the English haters keep voting for her.

It’s just the control freaks who run the protection racket don’t like to loose face.  Everybody knew there would be a deal at the very last second, but we played their game &amp; as a consequence have given too much away
1331346670207070208 2020-11-25 05:19:16 +0800 <lienomail> @Strath_FAI SNP accused of hoarding over £1 billion of funds sent to Scotland from Westminster. It’s been obvious to me for a long time that they are secretly building an Indy war chest instead of improving services. All to the detriment of the Scottish people
1331331569529851904 2020-11-25 04:19:15 +0800 <lienomail> @CanaryMarthaj @RESTRANDLTD The U.K. consumes around 8,400 tonnes of fish per annum. That equates to roughly 390 million meals. U.K. boats land about 400,000 tonnes from U.K. waters and 250.000 tonnes from wider afield. Currently the EU takes in excess of 700,000 tonnes from our waters. We can preserve some
1331310038254751747 2020-11-25 02:53:42 +0800 <lienomail> @MartinDaubney With you all the way on that one brother. It will be game on for a new centre right party to come into the mix at the next election. Lib/Lab/Con will be swept away.
1331309094687436807 2020-11-25 02:49:57 +0800 <lienomail> @RESTRANDLTD We will have to Steve. We don’t have the fleet capacity at this time. Incredible as it seems we are 5,500 vessels short compared with the number of boats we had before we signed up to the CFP. It’s a huge rebuild and will take many years
1331308054999158790 2020-11-25 02:45:49 +0800 <lienomail> @MartinDaubney At least we’ve now got U.K. Law behind the Licencing option.   I have no doubt we will be selling licences to EU fishermen for a good few years, until the U.K. fishing fleet is of sufficient size to handle the majority of the catch

1331285062520877056 2020-11-25 01:14:27 +0800 <lienomail> @sea_bouy @sarahisitme Because the CCP in conjunction with WHO and many MSM outlets no longer publicise it. I tweeted a video yesterday of 14,000 people quarantined in Pudong Airport, plus there are outbreaks in other cities  But talking to our China office this morning none of that is on the news

All he cares about is prolonging the lockdown for as long as possible in order to damage the Government even further. Labour have weaponised Covid from day one. Just like the Dems in the US
1331267667601338368 2020-11-25 00:05:20 +0800 <lienomail> @davemeehan1 Hahaha! But we’ve already signing up for the same deals, which all the nay sayers we’re telling us we wouldn’t get, and now you are saying we won’t get even better deals. Wait and see buddy, most free countries don’t really like dealing with protectionist regimes
1331235973557084161 2020-11-24 21:59:23 +0800 <lienomail> @davemeehan1 Not sure I understand your tweet Dave, but to refresh Remainer memories, the mantra at the time was, you’ll never get as good a deal as we have now, and any deal at all will take years to agree. So we’re signing up for the existing EU deals, and working to get even better deals

I think they only have to demonstrate reasonable doubt in front of the Supreme Court in order to gain ‘Civil Discovery’ and then it’s game on
1330481512765067266 2020-11-22 20:01:26 +0800 <lienomail> @Defencebrief @RobExRAF I think that was the plan with all the Trade Agreements we had as part of the EU, roll them over first and then negotiate for even better. It was the nay sayers, the MSM and the EU who said we’d not get as good a deal from anybody once we were out. Truss is destroying that theory

1327656114998157315 2020-11-15 00:54:19 +0800 <lienomail> @FarceSupreme Even stranger is that you checked Washington State instead of Washington DC, and then displayed your ignorance by tweeting it for all to see.
1327634684059275265 2020-11-14 23:29:09 +0800 <lienomail> @DebDeb2123 I have a great job thank you, in the beautiful State of Arizona. Everybody, and I mean everybody, I work with or socialise with say they voted Trump, and nobody can believe the count. That's a fact
1327629046658822145 2020-11-14 23:06:45 +0800 <lienomail> @GlynisPayne17 @EsqHumbug No problem Glynis, Enjoy the Tapas and wine, it sounds delicious.
1327624505750155266 2020-11-14 22:48:42 +0800 <lienomail> @kenneticenergy And yet the US are only joint twelfth highest in the list of deaths per million?
1327622747728601089 2020-11-14 22:41:43 +0800 <lienomail> @DebDeb2123 Hahaha!   Starting to panic Debs?
1327618433131929602 2020-11-14 22:24:35 +0800 <lienomail> @humourmeplz @Quinnwhite1234 Exactly! and this is not a main highway by any stretch.
1327617734633549838 2020-11-14 22:21:48 +0800 <lienomail> @GlynisPayne17 @EsqHumbug Pretty easy Glynis. On the tweet, click the dropdown arrow at the top right Choose 'Copy link to Tweet' Copy the URL of the tweet Go to facebook, open new post and paste the URL And send 👍
1327616717875507203 2020-11-14 22:17:46 +0800 <lienomail> @francismohr2 @stevegtweets I'm actually living and working in AZ dumbo. I've seen the fraud first hand, so I get it that you Dems are starting to panic, and throwing as much shade as you can. If Trump flips this election the lefty meltdown will be epic.
1327608996543361024 2020-11-14 21:47:05 +0800 <lienomail> All roads lead to Washington DC for the Million MAGA March this afternoon,14 Nov. This is just one of those roads at 6:30 this morning. Thousands and thousands of cars all heading to the biggest show of support ever seen for any other President past or present.  https://t.co/8qffqoSFS9

1327598357238476801 2020-11-14 21:04:48 +0800 <lienomail> Sometimes the numbers just dont add up, othertimes they are too good to be true.  Either way the only option is to start again, from the beginning  https://t.co/bAJ1OdpPK3

1327279346189545472 2020-11-13 23:57:10 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass Yep, I'm at 4300 blocks so far. Parler does not generate the same interaction we enjoy on twitter. It can be a very empty echo chamber. Even 'Celebs' get very little response to some of their posts, whereas on twitter they would be hitting 10,000's
1327273137403203584 2020-11-13 23:32:30 +0800 <lienomail> @seve99999 Gotcha!  Hope you are ok buddy 👍
1327185302423818240 2020-11-13 17:43:28 +0800 <lienomail> Last thought before bed. We all love Twitter but hate how the Twatter police control the narrative these days. The only effective way to return them to neutrality is to hit them where it hurts, in their profits. We should all block each and every advertiser appearing on our TL’s

1327180135561375744 2020-11-13 17:22:56 +0800 <lienomail> @Crazier No!   Never has for me.               The only real solution for me is Melatonin, if you can get your hands on it.   Sadly, that too is not always 100% effective. Probs due to too much time spent on internet and SM before bed. 🥺🥱🥱

1326775701899522048 2020-11-12 14:35:52 +0800 <lienomail> @Shannon89558046 There are new media channels launching in the next few months, promising to present the unvarnished news as it is, warts and all. If they don’t, they will soon be found out and fail. We are all awake to the manipulation now
1326770766747217920 2020-11-12 14:16:15 +0800 <lienomail> The way we consume news is about to change forever. Once the truth of this election surfaces media power will crumble to ash. No one will ever again believe anything the mainstream media reports. No one will ever again take any poll seriously. It's over !  https://t.co/qRsA2M6Ht2
1326768126164393985 2020-11-12 14:05:46 +0800 <lienomail> I've only just caught up with this thread from Claire Fox. Thank god we have her and Kate willing to speak the truth in the House of Horrors  Thread !
1326766266397433858 2020-11-12 13:58:22 +0800 <lienomail> More blatant twisting of the news by MSM. CBS used an image (1) cropped from a Trump rally (2) to claim that it showed huge Latino support for Biden. The actual Biden rally was in an empty hall (3). Nobody showed up. #FakeNews = #FakeResults  https://t.co/p9XFnLs62E

1326761595737956352 2020-11-12 13:39:49 +0800 <lienomail> @Marie62100602 Or more succinctly, I wonder if John Voight is truly proud that his daughter has become a privileged, virtue signalling, Marxist supporting, multi millionaire, who is totally divorced from the realities of life for most folk
1326759791411261443 2020-11-12 13:32:38 +0800 <lienomail> @Dave49Hammer Yes, Yes and No
1326757336992665602 2020-11-12 13:22:53 +0800 <lienomail> It takes a brave man and a true Patriot to speak out like this in the radical left cess pit that is California. John Voight is such a man.  Take a listen and let his words wash over you.  Love the guy.  https://t.co/1tr0HlE5xt

1326625213094776832 2020-11-12 04:37:52 +0800 <lienomail> Already the Republican Party has received 11,000 reports detailing incidents of electoral fraud                                    McEnany and RNC&amp;apos;s McDaniel reveal hundreds of sworn Affidavits alleging voter fraud.                                      https://t.co/eFyXwxzMnx

1326515856147419136 2020-11-11 21:23:20 +0800 <lienomail> @RobertRees_ @Stanley_Walker It was only a tweet Robert so somewhat limited, but I think the inference was that the rush to be woke and support BLM, without alienating license payers even further, was the reason the funds were allocated in this way. Same end result IMHO.

1326351324343111681 2020-11-11 10:29:32 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa The good news is Trump has definitely won NC even though media are not showing the gain for him
1326350443442806784 2020-11-11 10:26:02 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa I think that’s just a media site that had previously counted PA as a solid win for Biden even before the final result, as most MSM have done, but they’ve moved it back to an undeclared position, presumably because of the pending court actions
1326348906427523073 2020-11-11 10:19:56 +0800 <lienomail> @petalblossom1 Spain I believe

1326273669010743303 2020-11-11 05:20:58 +0800 <lienomail> Fact checkers are out in force tonight claiming that BBC did not promise to donate £10 million to BLM. Thats true if you take those words literally, and they knew it would anger a lot of donors, so this is how they got round it  https://t.co/OjJofTKXTp
1326271647310114824 2020-11-11 05:12:56 +0800 <lienomail> Forget Covid and masks and lockdowns, that will all pass eventually.

1326208984957792262 2020-11-11 01:03:56 +0800 <lienomail> @exinterplod And there's the rub. The only evidence will be anecdotal, whistle blowers, affidavits, video clips etc.   Of course, dodgy software would seal the deal, but I have a feeling that might be very difficult to prove

You do not know the truth or otherwise of this clip. All investigations start with an allegation, which should be fully interrogated with an open &amp; neutral mind
1326107786305040385 2020-11-10 18:21:48 +0800 <lienomail> Last one before bed.  Trump broke the system, the mold, the media and the pollsters. And if it all goes wrong this time, he'll be back stronger than ever for 2024   https://t.co/MMJjNYA1LQ
1326103262735556610 2020-11-10 18:03:50 +0800 <lienomail> No observers were denied access to the vote counting!  Yeah, right!  This clip says otherwise. And look at the official hiding his face. Why do that if you have nothing to hide?  https://t.co/vGons0IU6u
1326101784046276608 2020-11-10 17:57:57 +0800 <lienomail> This is going to catch a load of negs from the anti Trumpers, but it's another small piece in the mosaic of information that's building towards a reversal of everything illegal about the US election results.  https://t.co/Y56ON8OZ6L

1326045947944693760 2020-11-10 14:16:05 +0800 <lienomail> The Dems would rather let folks die than be given a chance with the new Pfizer vaccine, because they don’t want Trump to have any reflected credit from throwing funding support behind the R&amp;D

1326023094566342656 2020-11-10 12:45:16 +0800 <lienomail> This is not related to the Trump Team actions, the plaintiffs are private citizens who gathered the evidence and affidavits.  This will require more than a recount, it has to be a full audit now.

1325650757614448645 2020-11-09 12:05:44 +0800 <lienomail> @GerhardMack1 @NateWeymouth Trumps lawyers argued that observers were not allowed to oversee the voting as per legal statute, State countered by saying they were allowed in the room. Trumps team said they were not close enough to observe the ballots. The Judge asked were they in the room, yes or no. End of!

1325633016522297344 2020-11-09 10:55:14 +0800 <lienomail> To all my American friends. The Hill is nothing more than an ignorant, lying, liberal supporting rag. This was not a celebration in praise of Biden at all, it is to celebrate the 1605 defeat of a catholic plot to overthrow the Government. It's a 400 year old tradition.

1325358750593658882 2020-11-08 16:45:24 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 @Nigel_Farage Woah! How did we get there?   I merely pointed out that Bidens reply when asked for a comment by  BBC was 'I'm Irish'  My heritage is Irish too, so I can directly translate that as a 'No! - F off'
1325356482989350912 2020-11-08 16:36:24 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 @Nigel_Farage Hahaha!  That's a huge stretch to interpret it that way. Although I can interpret your 'you people' comment very clearly. Says a lot about you John.
1325355593452892161 2020-11-08 16:32:52 +0800 <lienomail> @whois_Josh Maybe because the Dems thought they had a walk over in 2016 and didn't need an insurance policy. I'm sure Hilary would have liked one with hindsight
1325353457507831809 2020-11-08 16:24:22 +0800 <lienomail> Autocretin strikes again. It should of course say:  Well said....
1325352969089544192 2020-11-08 16:22:26 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 @Nigel_Farage Alternative explanation for his reply ?????
1325352406176194560 2020-11-08 16:20:12 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 @Nigel_Farage He said 'I'm Irish' to reject a request to speak to the BBC.  I wouldn't speak to the BBC either, but don't pretend you didn't understand the implication of his reply.

1325343789335142403 2020-11-08 15:45:57 +0800 <lienomail> @Enlightened_Cap @LueStahm33 No, this election has not been confirmed at this stage. When all valid ballots have been tabulated then of course I accept the democratic will. What annoys me is all those who have denied democracy for others for 4 years are now claiming it for themselves
1325342148137463808 2020-11-08 15:39:26 +0800 <lienomail> @GerhardMack1 @NateWeymouth Edit!  Should have poll monitors...........

1325227607311396864 2020-11-08 08:04:17 +0800 <lienomail> @Enlightened_Cap @LueStahm33 But radical liberals never accept a legitimate vote. They’ve cried for 4 years over Trumps victory, and  for over 4 years because of Brexit, and they are still crying. You have no grounds to quote Democracy because it’s only a one way street for you people.

1324880183745277962 2020-11-07 09:03:45 +0800 <lienomail> @BiscAnenome In 2016 the number of voting age people who actually voted was 55.72%. Placing the US 30th out of the top 35 countries in the world. The percentage of Registered voters who voted was 86.8%
1324878095204179969 2020-11-07 08:55:27 +0800 <lienomail> @BiscAnenome To be eligible to vote you have to register first. If you are not registered you are ineligible.
1324876312675233794 2020-11-07 08:48:22 +0800 <lienomail> @BiscAnenome I used the actual figures for REGISTERED VOTERS, your calculation used the number of people of voting age. Only registered voters can turn out to vote and of those 90% did.
1324875006468366338 2020-11-07 08:43:11 +0800 <lienomail> The software used in machines that tabulate the votes in the US Election is based on Windows 7. A ten year old kid can hack into it without too much difficulty and redirect the count.  https://t.co/H4JUUuCyTX
1324869398952366083 2020-11-07 08:20:54 +0800 <lienomail> @BiscAnenome That’s a stupid calculation and gives an inaccurate figure. I actually went to the Wisconsin Electoral Commission for my figures. They show that on 1 Nov the number of Registered Voters (not simply those old enough to vote) was 3,684,786

1324777876646932482 2020-11-07 02:17:13 +0800 <lienomail> The average voter turnout in Wisconsin over the last 100 years is 67%. This year it is an unprecedented 90%, giving Biden the win by just 0.016%.  Who knew that their predictive algorithms for precisely how many ballots it would take to win  could be so accurate.
1324772427327483905 2020-11-07 01:55:34 +0800 <lienomail> @sqwawk Common sense would say not, but apparently certain folk are vehemently against anyone trying to check a few votes to confirm that they are indeed genuine and verifiable. What are they afraid of ?

But I hope you can agree with me that they should only be genuine and verified votes, and not any that are proved orherwise
1324665514262700032 2020-11-06 18:50:44 +0800 <lienomail> @sqwawk Jay is a known anti-Trumper, just like you Neil, so I'll take this with the same pinch of salt I'm taking from the media here in AZ. Nobody here in Arizona can believe the result, we only ever saw support for Trump before the vote count started coming in

1324191251672039424 2020-11-05 11:26:11 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass I know but it depends how deep Trump pockets are. He could tie them up for months lin legal challenges.

It’s almost as if they knew who the votes were for 🤔
1324187681115525121 2020-11-05 11:12:00 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass Yeah! Trump was up 13.7% in PA earlier today, now it’s down to 3%. They’ll keep counting until they’ve found enough votes to seal the deal for Sleepy Joe

1324177679176945664 2020-11-05 10:32:15 +0800 <lienomail> @LindaBa90151703 For 4 + years MSM  have taken every opportunity to dismiss, denigrate and deny anything that Trump ever said or did. Their ultimate objective was to brainwash enough weak minded people in the hope of preventing a second term. Today they succeeded &amp; are  now drunk on their success
1324136186747752449 2020-11-05 07:47:22 +0800 <lienomail> If you were wondering how fake votes can be introduced into the counting system, just check out this report to see how easy it is.
1324135360608243714 2020-11-05 07:44:05 +0800 <lienomail> @itsmeag52425650 Yes, that was earlier today, but Biden got a lot of votes later which switched it for him. He has been officially declared the winner in MI
1324132815710146560 2020-11-05 07:33:59 +0800 <lienomail> @how_rhodri That was 13 hrs ago Taffy, while you were busy chasing the sheep up and down the valleys with your trousers round your ankles  And certainly long before sacks full of 'misplaced' votes started turning up with Sleepy Joe's name on them.
1324125719413329922 2020-11-05 07:05:47 +0800 <lienomail> @IanMcna14344842 @Sozzinski I had to apologise to my twitter family Ian, I would never deliberately mislead any of those beautiful people.
1324124699392122882 2020-11-05 07:01:44 +0800 <lienomail> Interesting titbit I just found whilst fact checking.  Earlier we heard that 180,000+ votes had been found in Wisconsin. The voter turnout in WI was the highest ever, a full 5% more that the previous record set in '96. 5% of the registered electorate just happens to be 184,236
1324117633705398272 2020-11-05 06:33:39 +0800 <lienomail> I have to apologise for this tweet. This morning Trump was so far ahead in MI that I honestly didn’t believe he could be caught with so few votes remaining to be counted. I did not forseee almost every single one of those outstanding votes having Biden name on them
1324020041541705729 2020-11-05 00:05:51 +0800 <lienomail> @SimonIckeUK God I love keyboard warriors who are always so clever AFTER the event. It takes a special kind of delusion to think anybody cares what you have to say. Either say it before or bst at all.
1324016286020624384 2020-11-04 23:50:56 +0800 <lienomail> @SimonIckeUK Easy to say now but 6 hrs ago Michigan was Trumps with only 10% left to count. Who knew they'd keep finding shed loads of votes from the bottom of Bidens garden.
1323981842354184192 2020-11-04 21:34:04 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 MI is now 0.5% for Trump. A nail biter, but he's come back 0.2% in the last hour.
1323980740644773888 2020-11-04 21:29:41 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 MI is now the big doubt. The Dems can see it will give Biden the victory and they will keep finding votes until he does
1323980284866551814 2020-11-04 21:27:52 +0800 <lienomail> @brickypaul Very volatile at the moment. Changing all the time
1323979067616645120 2020-11-04 21:23:02 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 Biden needs MI, NV &amp; WI to give him 270 seats. WI is moving his way, NV too close to call, 0.6% to Biden. MI Trump leads by 0.3% up from 0.2% an hour ago. Too close for comfort.
1323964108744597504 2020-11-04 20:23:36 +0800 <lienomail> @brickypaul Is that a Paddy Power teaser ?   Oddschecker, which tabulates all major betting sites has Trump as the overwhelming favourite. Odds on at 8/15 with Biden now out at 13/5. Having said all this, Michigan has just closed the gap to only 0.2% lead for Trump. Game changer maybe?
1323960058187780096 2020-11-04 20:07:30 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 That's a 0.1% narrowing of the gap, There's still a 1.2% differential. 634k votes still to count, Trump would have to lose 571k of them to close that gap. I'm still confident.
1323958200635412480 2020-11-04 20:00:07 +0800 <lienomail> @Steve1973x Exactly, in fact it could be more than a 20 seat margin. But we can't second guess what might be found at the last minute. Right now though I'm pretty confident. The eyes of the world are on them.
1323957490355212288 2020-11-04 19:57:18 +0800 <lienomail> @rtsuppliesltd I've been watching all night and not seen that 100K increase, It's been close all the way through, Biden currently leads by 7k votes with 84,000 still to be counted. I already gave WI to Biden in my calculations, worth 10 seats.
1323955103519461377 2020-11-04 19:47:49 +0800 <lienomail> @Jamieburton13 WI has been neck and neck all evening ?   Biden currently leads by 0.3%
1323954475229466625 2020-11-04 19:45:19 +0800 <lienomail> @Steve1973x Google search 'Latest Electoral results from the USA'  Scroll down to '2020 US election results'  Click 'All States'
1323952493269835776 2020-11-04 19:37:26 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr We can't legislate for what might be 'found' but the straight maths of votes already counted show that DJT is on target for another 4 year term
1323951693797744640 2020-11-04 19:34:16 +0800 <lienomail> @kjlherbalife @aley_aa I've already counted that as a Biden win even though it's still close
1323951115726106624 2020-11-04 19:31:58 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 I've conceded WI &amp; NV to Biden although both are too close to call at +0.3% &amp; +0.6% respectively. PA is Trumps +12.6%, GA he's +2.2%, MI +1.4%, NC +1.4%,  That's all that remains.
1323949011481600005 2020-11-04 19:23:36 +0800 <lienomail> @Steve1973x Associated Press. They are not so biased in their reporting. Search '2020 US Election results' &amp; select 'All States' Scroll down for up to the minute data.
1323948225674530816 2020-11-04 19:20:29 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr Biden only leads in Nevada by 0.6% &amp; Wisconsin by 0.3%, Trump leads in all the remaining States. Pennsylvania is out of sight for Biden, Trump leads there by 12.6%. That's 20 seats. MI &amp; NC are the tightest where Trump has 1.4% lead in both. 31 seat at stake in these two
1323946212727361538 2020-11-04 19:12:29 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr It's currently 238/213 to Biden, still some big numbers to come in
1323945774124814340 2020-11-04 19:10:44 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa I already counted Nevada for Biden even though he only has a 0.6% lead. The only other State he has a clear lead is Wisconsin together worth 16 seat . Trump leads in all the others. Georgia, Michigan, N.Carolina, Pennsylvania, together worth 67 seats. Could even be 280/254

1323934708925956097 2020-11-04 18:26:46 +0800 <lienomail> I think we can call this now for Trump. Unless there's something really dramatic happens with 'surprise votes' Trump had been relected by at least a 275 to 264 margin.
1323926529982795777 2020-11-04 17:54:16 +0800 <lienomail> @sarahwollaston Is that the verdict of the people or the manipulation of the fraudsters that you want him to wait for Sarah.

That is what he is comparing the US turnout against. Nobody in their wildest dreams imagined he was suggesting US voters got to have a say in the Brexit vote. Well, except you that is
1323760857906663429 2020-11-04 06:55:57 +0800 <lienomail> @GetBritainOut I hope this is not true. According to the Sun the EU has agreed 'to allow' the UK to double it's catch.  From our own waters ??😡😡😡 Based on the highest estimate that would be 60% of total catch from all UK waters. But already France has 84% of all cod from the Eastern Channel

1323524904239726592 2020-11-03 15:18:21 +0800 <lienomail> @chadnoonan2 @realDonaldTrump I too watched it live and was shocked when the MSM cut the presentation from their reporting only minutes later. If you did not see that then you were not watching a live feed
1323395988879482880 2020-11-03 06:46:05 +0800 <lienomail> @HappyHarryMedia ‘We are underfunded’. So how much has this cost the NHS ?  Make no mistake this has not been organised, rehearsed &amp; filmed in their lunch break. Which by the way most of them are ‘too busy to have a break’. And what about the PPE shortages? No wonder with this disregard for it.
1323391144160579584 2020-11-03 06:26:50 +0800 <lienomail> @chadnoonan2 @realDonaldTrump Thats not the full context, it’s an edited version of the full story. The guy on Trump’s right had just done a presentation showing research they had performed using UV and disinfectant fluid, both of which killed the virus instantly. Trump was reflecting on that information.

1322810102412357632 2020-11-01 15:57:59 +0800 <lienomail> This is the fourth rally that The Trumpster did in Pennsylvania yesterday. This was in the heart of oil and gas country, which Biden has threatened to shut down. Sound up, you can hear the crowds on Trumps video's, unlike the Dems hoax rallies.  https://t.co/KZ0Nc8uLrh

1322672846875885568 2020-11-01 06:52:35 +0800 <lienomail> This is a typical Dems hoax campaign ‘rally’. They parade in front of the camera pretending that somebody has turned up to support them. In reality there is nobody there. Happens over and over and MSM are complicit in hiding the truth

So many folk in the US had got well paid jobs for the first time in decades and the spiral was only heading upwards. C19 was the silver bullet &amp; not just for Dems but China too

1322299523671199745 2020-10-31 06:09:08 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr It's like Obama last week, Filmed shouting through a megaphone in support of Biden, but then a camera from a different angle shows that he's shouting to just four reporters and three cameramen standing less than15 ft away from him. Dems campaigning is a hoax perpetrated by MSM
1322287457547755523 2020-10-31 05:21:11 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass More fool the American people if he does. But on the other hand, they've never had a GOP with hard socialist policies, so it might do them good in the long term to have four years of shock and awe. They'll never vote that way again that's for sure

1322245451320537089 2020-10-31 02:34:16 +0800 <lienomail> This is a very interesting read, particularly if you believe C19 is being weaponised for political purposes. Emmanuel Macron is selling out French sovereignty to the EU with a second total lockdown  https://t.co/rHy5R9O2Zl
1322231950388699140 2020-10-31 01:40:37 +0800 <lienomail> @ziggy6769 @TheSisterHavana Biden tried doing the big rallies but nobody showed up. C19 is a gift from heaven for his media team who had run out of excuses for denying his cognitive impairment. Plus he needed basement time for his daily Donepazil treatment to take effect.

1322121407246016513 2020-10-30 18:21:21 +0800 <lienomail> Donald Trump is the only politician in my life time to attract crowds like he does. Everywhere he goes the support shows up in huge numbers. If he doesn't win by a landslide next Tuesday it will be the biggest fix of all time. This is Tampa Florida earlier today.  https://t.co/YWPq1Ltbju

She genuinely cares about the ordinary hard working people around her. Not many MP's or Lords have ever shown the same sort of empathy with the common man.  https://t.co/Z4CJfBEGKu

It leads me to think you are a staunch advocate of no-platforming anyone with an opposing view to your own.  Understandable if you don't have any real argument, just lefty trope

It is unlike any other, in that residual traces are being found throughout the body during autopsy. They appear to be dormant for now, but...........?

1321599418282463233 2020-10-29 07:47:10 +0800 <lienomail> @MarkSPRayner I always take the global perspective rather than just my own back yard. The number of tests worldwide are certainly increasing, hence more positive results, but so too are the number of deaths rising, which indicates to me that a 2nd surge is underway

1321572777753792512 2020-10-29 06:01:18 +0800 <lienomail> @bobojones19 I don't think so. My company has a division in Wuhan and some staff never reappeared after lock down. Everybody's been working for months now &amp; there has been no second surge other than a couple of small outbreaks near the Russian border, but they were not affected the first time
1321571523489157122 2020-10-29 05:56:19 +0800 <lienomail> @JoshBryantMusic It's long been an accepted part of Japanese culture to wear a mask whenever in public during Flu or Cold seasons. It's universally accepted and is not railed against like it is in many western countries

1321512999925010437 2020-10-29 02:03:46 +0800 <lienomail> @Mr_Doovde Earlier this yr the Gov gave £20 p/wk to all families with school age kids to help with C19 disruption. That costs £9.5bill for a Yr. or £1045 p/yr p/family.  13 weeks school holidays; 1045/13 = 140 p/wk or £20 extra p/day for food. Or if we use a 5 day wk it's £28 p/day extra

I admit they are certain circumstances where abortion may be the better solution, but it should not be as you say, an acceptable method of both control. All lives are precious

Not adults.  Schools would be an ideal location. But parental education is the ultimate solution. Ask any teacher about kids arriving a school not having eaten at all.

There is no guarantee that it would provide even one more slice of bread on the table. And politicising it not any sort of solution, it requires a new way to address this malaise that is affecting how children are neglected

But this living in poverty label is just an excuse for parents who cannot put their kids first. Bad parenting should not be excused or defended.

1317163225209864197 2020-10-17 01:59:19 +0800 <lienomail> @eu_purgatory @bear44willis That would not feed the nation. Idealism does not put grub on the table. If we stop all fishing for ’several years’ there would be no fishing industry left to catch anything
1317159235814367233 2020-10-17 01:43:28 +0800 <lienomail> @EsqHumbug @RuleBrexitannia @HHepplewhite Excellent news!  That’s how you negotiate a deal, from a position of strength, not Teresa May’s grovelling weakness
1317156871036456960 2020-10-17 01:34:04 +0800 <lienomail> @bear44willis Building the fishing industry back to a sustainable level will take at least 5 years, in the meantime we still need fish on our dining tables. They have to come from somewhere so not fishing at all for three years is not a workable plan. We control the EU catch while we rebuild
1317127655259590657 2020-10-16 23:37:58 +0800 <lienomail> @bear44willis Where does the shortfall on landed fish come from in that ‘building up’ period? Buy them from the EU?  What do you think they will be charging us, unless an agreed price is part of their licence to fish our waters during a transition towards a full U.K. only fleet catch
1317120689036513282 2020-10-16 23:10:17 +0800 <lienomail> @stgeorgeiscross @gr16311827 No worries 😉. Been there, done that 😂😂👍
1317120417845415936 2020-10-16 23:09:13 +0800 <lienomail> @saxon_angelo I agree on the transition of fishing waters even though I got loads of abuse on here for saying it. We don’t have a big enough fleet to fish our own waters yet. We are 5,000+ boats short of what we had in the 80’s and that probably equates to 500,000 tonnes of fish. It takes time
1317118496606662657 2020-10-16 23:01:35 +0800 <lienomail> @stgeorgeiscross @gr16311827 ???   This original tweet was about the BBC licence fee. Is this reference to the UK in the wrong thread?
1317115348425035777 2020-10-16 22:49:04 +0800 <lienomail> @saxon_angelo I know that buddy!  In fact I qualified my enthusiasm in an earlier tweet by saying ‘we are not over the line yet’, but I’m very happy where we are at this point in the race
1317112906576744453 2020-10-16 22:39:22 +0800 <lienomail> @EsqHumbug @HHepplewhite @RuleBrexitannia Just watched it here. Great news to wake up to. Four+ years of battling the abuse from the remain crowd and MSM, but the Brexit family kept their nerve and their resolve to finally win through. Not over the line yet but so very close. Well done all.

1316780933769555970 2020-10-16 00:40:13 +0800 <lienomail> @TonyPeck46 I think we are talking illegal immigrants here Tony. They've already passed through at least one safe country where they could and should have sought asylum.
1316779594666643456 2020-10-16 00:34:54 +0800 <lienomail> @TonyPeck46 Yep! already replied to that earlier. DSS is still a colloquial terminology for that department. And DWP was simply not appropriate, because they don't work or contribute towards any benefits or pensions

Without question BBC News is the most watched International service in the world, but it's accessed for free via the web, completely subsidised by UK license payers. Guys in India or Africa are not suddenly going to start paying for it now
1316759082515271681 2020-10-15 23:13:24 +0800 <lienomail> The BBC will fight tooth and nail to avoid being forced into pay-per-view funding, because they know that hardly anyone would pay for their absolute rubbish.  https://t.co/uoAIuyrjUI

I'm so glad my post helped you figure out what day it is 😂😂  If it also helps, my life every day is the same as the day before. It's like revolving doors, nothing changes no matter what. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat, drink, banter on twitter, sleep and repeat

The IQ quote is childish, pussy grabbing was locker room banter, and who pays more tax than they legally have to ?
1316739754004750336 2020-10-15 21:56:35 +0800 <lienomail> @Luisa47132714 I recommend home schooling 😜😂😂😂
1316733576445136897 2020-10-15 21:32:03 +0800 <lienomail> @Watforddogs @or_dodo Trump has done more for black America than any President in the last 50 years. Only those brainwashed by left wing MSM will disagree with me. I’m working in the US and see and hear it every day.
1316731322124193792 2020-10-15 21:23:05 +0800 <lienomail> @ostentwhistle @BrexitDeal Yeah! But it’s stil a common colloquial term for it. I deliberately didn’t use DWP because none of them work or contribute towards state pension or benefits.

Anyone who forms a negative opinion about Trump because she saw a picture of him using two hands to drink a glass of water, just does not deserve engaging with. Over and out lady.

1313992813290323972 2020-10-08 08:01:14 +0800 <lienomail> Had to share this 😡😡😡
1313968585069527043 2020-10-08 06:24:57 +0800 <lienomail> @DannPotski @JeremyCordite Hahaha!  Typical, ignore everything else and pick up on a typo. If you'd bothered to read the stuff I sent you would know that the data is a forecast for systems coming on line in 2022. The source is the US Gov. Energy Information Administration.  https://t.co/1z7cm00P2q
1313954658948390912 2020-10-08 05:29:37 +0800 <lienomail> @DannPotski @JeremyCordite And this article addresses the environmental impact of decommissioned Turbines. Current solution seems to be landfill or burning them, which produces toxic fumes. There will be 720,000 tons of turbine blades to be disposed of over the next 20 years  https://t.co/nOcrnUWy1b
1313953431116288001 2020-10-08 05:24:44 +0800 <lienomail> @DannPotski @JeremyCordite This article covers 'efficiency of wind power'    https://t.co/TMOm9tmNFY
1313952999966945282 2020-10-08 05:23:01 +0800 <lienomail> @DannPotski @JeremyCordite I've been working so I've only just got around to answering this. It will be a thread of three tweets starting with a cost analysis of total lifetime costs divided by the amount of energy produced. That's the only way to assess real value for money. See below.  https://t.co/bT2kB24DoA
1313820198177329154 2020-10-07 20:35:19 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite No! I'm being deliberately factual. The total generating capacity from all renewables, including wind, is 25% of demand, Nuclear gives 19%, coal provides 9% but natural gas is the largest contributor of all at 43%. The remaining 4% is derived from other sources.
1313801463664123905 2020-10-07 19:20:52 +0800 <lienomail> @mitsyarty Yet another classic Jo. You never cease to amaze me.
1313792245901021185 2020-10-07 18:44:15 +0800 <lienomail> @Julianlzb87 @PrincessofWails @JeremyCordite The cost of electrolysis to produce hydrogen is not economically viable. The process only delivers energy levels at 80% of the total electricity energy used. Steam powered reformers are even worse at only 65% efficiency
1313790039495712769 2020-10-07 18:35:29 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite Not sure if you deleted your previous tweet, but your reply was a repeat of my tweet. As for 'potential energy' storage at night, presumably for hydro power reservoirs, what happens when the wind doesn't blow? And how many turbines are needed for one hydroelectric generator?
1313783101751992320 2020-10-07 18:07:55 +0800 <lienomail> @copyrightismine @Wetwinter1 And the point of the original tweet was about the lack of a white history month, your point was ????
1313781194652372992 2020-10-07 18:00:20 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite It is my understanding that Dinorwig is a Hydroelectricity generator. The storage you mentioned is water storage not electricity. The water in the reservoirs can be release in minutes to boost electricity generation.
1313779388434075649 2020-10-07 17:53:09 +0800 <lienomail> @twitone As with all self proclaimed 'liberal elite' you cannot hide your disdain for the working class, but in your rush to signal how woke and virtuous you are, you completely missed the point of the original tweet. This is happening now, not in some Dickensian past.
1313773847787732992 2020-10-07 17:31:08 +0800 <lienomail> @JeremyCordite 2/2  Wind Turbines are by definition unreliable. No wind, no power. They are also expensive to build, cannot be recycled and environmentally damaging. 100% wind power would always need 100% back up from fossil fuel or nuclear generators to avoid black outs.
1313772544437235712 2020-10-07 17:25:57 +0800 <lienomail> @JeremyCordite Electricity can be stored in batteries, but in terms of the capacity needed for the national Grid, that is an impossibility. It can be converted into Hydrogen but the cost implications mean it would only ever be viable for powering transport. 1/2

The CPC refs quoted for a suposed COVID-19 Patent do not tally. The first two are actually patents for facial recognition software, and I can’t find the third one anywhere in the list of granted patents. I think the doc is a fake.

1312469218139410432 2020-10-04 03:07:00 +0800 <lienomail> @chris_jay_1 @oscar_out It’s in the original tweet. Link to Sky News at the bottom of the tweet. Like most tweets that reference articles.
1312416615435300864 2020-10-03 23:37:59 +0800 <lienomail> @chris_jay_1 @oscar_out It’s actually from Sky News, easy to find with 10 seconds worth of effort. And as for the date, lefty zealots have no problem quoting stuff that happened decades ago if they think it will do damage to someone who’s politics they currently disagree with.

But hey! don’t let facts get in the way of your neo-liberal agenda

The Elective surgery ward is for those recovering from such procedures as hip and knee replacements or spinal surgery. Or do you think they should be ignored &amp; left to suffer

It was peaceful for 2hrs 45mins until suddenly hundreds of police arrived, some of them in riot gear and proceeded to steam through the crowd. No announcements, no requests, just force of numbers to intimidate those there
1310845848847253505 2020-09-29 15:36:19 +0800 <lienomail> @BarryHeeney @NigelKellow Barry, please don’t tweet in ignorance. This ward is for elective surgery patients post op. The hospital already has two wards on standby for Covid patients, plus a full ICU wing for severe cases. All empty save for two patients in the last 7 weeks, neither of them severe.
1310682160651796480 2020-09-29 04:45:53 +0800 <lienomail> @wrongthinkQC @JamesLadbroke They get swept up in the self righteous hysteria. It was a reporter who called it a walking stick, but it was actually a selfie stick, which can be confirmed in a number of clips. But hey ho ! Lets deny the evidence of our own eyes.

I know you'll stand up for the job, &amp; I don't blame you for that, but why the 2 tier policing

The cops were trying (and succeeded) in confiscating it, she was trying to get it back when she was struck. She was filming on the chair I would have thought an ex detective would have noticed that

CGI maybe but it was first published within minutes of it taking place, so no time for CGI. Simple explanation, the filming was stopped for a second of two. Other clips on here confirm the truth from a different angle

1306935675527331841 2020-09-18 20:38:41 +0800 <lienomail> @mattsslug @3rd_Doctor Still not convinced. I can see the trailer rise and fall more to the right side. There are skid marks on the other side, and the white car has 1 sec to react before the danger’s passed. You see folks every day that need 5 secs to react to anything. 1/2

1305392099173511168 2020-09-14 14:25:04 +0800 <lienomail> @astropete54 @joannenorwich @deportating_bad Tough question Jo, difficult to strike when you've never had a job. 😉
1305391635925266434 2020-09-14 14:23:13 +0800 <lienomail> @bvaarcher 👍👍 I got it.
1305391418953871361 2020-09-14 14:22:21 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnMcC35020422 Because they've now come to the conclusion that negitiating anything with the EU mafia is a complete waste of time, so we just have to get on with it ourselves.
1305390514930417665 2020-09-14 14:18:46 +0800 <lienomail> This is horrendous, a nightmare for all police patrol officers. Both cops suffered multiple gunshot wounds and are in critical condition. No named suspect yet, but to me this looks like a 12 or 13 year old carrying out the attack, not an adult. Could be gang initiation test?
1305379321066983425 2020-09-14 13:34:17 +0800 <lienomail> @deportating_bad Hahaha! I'm sure you do, but eventually you will grow up and hold a very different, more elequent, and well informed opinion.
1305375854030131200 2020-09-14 13:20:30 +0800 <lienomail> This is great news!  (If it's true) UK government plans to ammend EU Human Rights Convention to speed up failed asylum seeker deportations and to protect our troops from malicious prosecutions  https://t.co/WgKHr8Emcq
1305251667617738754 2020-09-14 05:07:02 +0800 <lienomail> @s0l0p0laris @QuestionofSport Each episode is watched by between 4 and 5 million viewers each week, which makes it one of the BBC’s most popular shows
1305249912779571201 2020-09-14 05:00:04 +0800 <lienomail> @barbara_jupp I’m sure you are correct Barbara, although it was the irony of the situation I was referring to, not the legality of mask wearing
1305106350695997442 2020-09-13 19:29:36 +0800 <lienomail> @DillonKevlar @Dolly_Darren @WinifredLovatt @QuestionofSport @BBC Hahaha!  Strange comment to make to someone who’s face is decidedly not white
1305105527505117184 2020-09-13 19:26:20 +0800 <lienomail> @CloserRou @GentlemanGeorge @aley_aa @acgrayling @PhilipHammondUK @OfficeGSBrown @campbellclaret You are incapable of debate, you’ve only got sound bites which have no relevance to the conversation. You may justify that I’m your own head but actual grown ups have no time for it. Now get your homework done, it’s school tomorrow
1305091020804284417 2020-09-13 18:28:41 +0800 <lienomail> @CameronChesters @winmor1 @Gdjg72 Hahaha! You are losing the plot. There is no mention of a changing audience I’m that article. Waste of time and space. Bye
1305090043275603969 2020-09-13 18:24:48 +0800 <lienomail> @winmor1 @CameronChesters @Gdjg72 You’re losing me there bro, I’m objecting to the fact that folks lose their jobs based not on performance but on a new woke agenda. That applies to everyone, no matter what job they are employed in. My company employ over 70% POC in hi-tech well paid jobs based on their abilities
1305087644477673472 2020-09-13 18:15:16 +0800 <lienomail> @Dolly_Darren @WinifredLovatt @QuestionofSport @BBC Let’s see the new line up Darren and then get back to me. Three very able entertainers should only be replaced by three entertainers who are even better if the change is to be justified on the grounds of improving the programme. If not, draw your own conclusions
1305086576498704384 2020-09-13 18:11:01 +0800 <lienomail> @JoeDabernig Sick of saying this Joe, it’s about folk losing their jobs because of age or skin tone when it should be about their job performance. I’d say the same for anyone being sacked unfairly. I have POC ancestry ffs
1305085621988397056 2020-09-13 18:07:14 +0800 <lienomail> @MaxFrances1 Irrelevant comment!  You must have lots of time on your hands to have bothered tweeting this.
1305084749438955521 2020-09-13 18:03:46 +0800 <lienomail> @CameronChesters @winmor1 @Gdjg72 Which audience demographic are you using for the basis of your question Cameron?
1305084141218783232 2020-09-13 18:01:21 +0800 <lienomail> @CameronChesters I’m not arguing that at all, but put yourself in their shoes and imagine tomorrow, despite you being great at your job, you’re boss tells you you’re sacked, for no other reason than age and skin tone. That’s the unfairness of it all, and yet lots of folk think it’s acceptable
1305083035071778816 2020-09-13 17:56:57 +0800 <lienomail> @winmor1 @Gdjg72 @CameronChesters I don’t need a bugging device to recognise that the people losing their jobs all have two things in common which do not correspond to the current woke demographic, their age and their skin tone. I don’t need a bugging device to see the racism involved in that decision.
1305081654571139072 2020-09-13 17:51:28 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa @CloserRou @acgrayling @PhilipHammondUK @OfficeGSBrown @campbellclaret Think I might have to too. 👍
1305080109842530304 2020-09-13 17:45:20 +0800 <lienomail> @Tim_Lill It’s not about change per se, it’s about the absolute unfairness of someone losing their job for no other reason than they do not fit the current woke demographic. I.e. Age and Skin tone. If you are ok with that then god help you.
1305079125246447616 2020-09-13 17:41:25 +0800 <lienomail> @ZManjra123 @horse45u Whenever and wherever there is a vacancy. It’s pretty demeaning if someone has to be fired in order for you to be given their job, it sort of indicates you were not good enough to win in the first place based, on your own merits and ability.
1305077427312496640 2020-09-13 17:34:40 +0800 <lienomail> @CloserRou @aley_aa @acgrayling @PhilipHammondUK @OfficeGSBrown @campbellclaret Please stop tweeting until you are capable of stringing a coherent sentence together. You are embarrassing yourself.
1305076980950405121 2020-09-13 17:32:54 +0800 <lienomail> @JoeDabernig I don’t, this is about right or wrong. If you think folks should lose their jobs because of the colour of their skin then you are the racist in this conversation.
1305075633207357442 2020-09-13 17:27:32 +0800 <lienomail> @CameronChesters Not at all, I’m triggered by the current woke practice of people using their jobs because of their skin colour. If you think that is acceptable then you my friend are a racist
1305040810967269377 2020-09-13 15:09:10 +0800 <lienomail> @BethRigby If ever there was an incentive to make you go full steam ahead it would be these two traitors telling you not to

1305038475796926465 2020-09-13 14:59:53 +0800 <lienomail> The BBC are still on a suicide mission as Question of Sport is destined to become Question of Skin Tone.  Contracts cancelled for Sue Barker, Matt Dawson #DefundTheBBC  https://t.co/pzohuhhuM7
1304944299025543168 2020-09-13 08:45:40 +0800 <lienomail> @Delveyboy @6potman Hahaha!  Geography question made him run away I guess. Probably because the answer was not available in the remoaners book of things to say to leavers.
1304901393950670852 2020-09-13 05:55:10 +0800 <lienomail> OMG!  I’ve saved this tweet so that I can use it whenever anyone tells me that Captain Forensic can lead the Labour Party back to glory. The only thing he will lead them to is total oblivion.
1304895051756171264 2020-09-13 05:29:58 +0800 <lienomail> @ClarkeStuart49 The Buy British statement was a direct response to the EU threatening to block food imports. It is our retaliation but obviously not to the exclusion of the rest of the world after we’ve defeated the EU
1304894091252191232 2020-09-13 05:26:09 +0800 <lienomail> @FDuchastel888 @FurkinElle I see you answer nicely swerves the fact that you didn’t know what a kipper is until you googled it. 😂😂😂. As for strömming and böckiling 😳. Er! No thanks. Been there, tried it, don’t like it.

1304867306217132039 2020-09-13 03:39:43 +0800 <lienomail> @Fwoggie The reason those percentages are so high is because we have been forced to buy from within the protected market of the EU Ponzi scheme. The EU are not in the top 10 producers of peppers and they are only No8 on the tomato growers list. We will have zero supply problems
1304847579184877568 2020-09-13 02:21:20 +0800 <lienomail> @StuartMortimer1 @dyslexicNews @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson Hahaha!  I’m thinking Khazistan would be an even better description.
1304846759915593728 2020-09-13 02:18:05 +0800 <lienomail> @Fwoggie @JasBratfud Old news regurgitated by someone who finds it necessary to try to impress folk by advertising he’s got 2 degrees. The scare mongering doesn’t work, we’ll be fine.

1304771683077754880 2020-09-12 21:19:45 +0800 <lienomail> @neal_preshner @Julesbcs I agree, but it will run infinitely better with a full service and a retune to get it up to maximum efficiency.
1304756178728165378 2020-09-12 20:18:08 +0800 <lienomail> @FDuchastel888 You are going to be so psychologically damaged when all your fantasising falls apart. Please keep me up to speed with your mental health problems.
1304753559825723392 2020-09-12 20:07:44 +0800 <lienomail> @FDuchastel888 You are confusing meltdown with actually standing up for your country and the independence that the electorate voted for. Sorry to burst your bubble, but we’ll be just fine without the EU Ponzi scheme thank you
1304750168001126401 2020-09-12 19:54:15 +0800 <lienomail> @JasBratfud Exactly Jas, but I’ve got remoaners telling me that we’ll all starve to death without the EU

1304743398826561541 2020-09-12 19:27:21 +0800 <lienomail> @hilarymwhite And the point of this tweet is  ????

1304734064197410821 2020-09-12 18:50:16 +0800 <lienomail> I missed this article a few days ago but it spells out perfectly what the Gov's position should be on Clause 38 of the WA. The only weak link is Boris could cave at the 11th hour, but he can indeed,legally rip up the WA &amp; the EU agreed to it  https://t.co/HbErow956C via @theconwom

In Lombardy, officially one in six of the population are immigrants, but there are also huge numbers of illegals, mostly Chinese, who are not recorded.
1304716497533706240 2020-09-12 17:40:28 +0800 <lienomail> @Yalini_Salvini @MrsSueEFeeney1 @MrCEssex1 I visited Tuscany last summer but the immigrant population was much higher than two years previously. Many from North Africa, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. The magical beauty of the area is sadly diminishing.
1304701819302694915 2020-09-12 16:42:08 +0800 <lienomail> @MrsSueEFeeney1 @MrCEssex1 I feel for you hon. Scotland is no longer the land that we all loved to visit. So much animosity towards the English now. It’s embarrassing
1304696883051458560 2020-09-12 16:22:31 +0800 <lienomail> @MrsSueEFeeney1 @MrCEssex1 Me too! In fact my youngest kids are destined to live in an Islamic Caliphate unless things change rapidly. I’m already looking at an escape route for all my family. I have to protect my lived ones.

1304481076300197888 2020-09-12 02:04:59 +0800 <lienomail> @starukkiwi Hahaha !  Says the New European, who clearly are expressing their completely unbiased views. NOT! So many of the leftwaffa are wetting their beds over this Japan deal that it's a total joy to behold.
1304479674240823297 2020-09-12 01:59:25 +0800 <lienomail> A very good twitter friend of mine has sent me this note. I'm sharing it because I think his words will resonate with all of you right thinking folks on here.  https://t.co/hMZFw5XAhd
1304478805218734080 2020-09-12 01:55:57 +0800 <lienomail> @mrdanwalker I'd be interested to know how many more 1000's of folk, who were equally outraged by the offensive performance, simply decided it was not worth complaining because Ofcom is a useless, lefty controlled quango who will do nothing about it anyway
1304449322919120896 2020-09-11 23:58:48 +0800 <lienomail> @DillonKevlar Well it's a tweet KEVIN, so there's hardly room for a dissertation. But if you seriously wanted to offer criticism, then you should read the detail of the agreement first before challenging the grown ups

1304405830436098049 2020-09-11 21:05:59 +0800 <lienomail> @DenneyDesign The EU do not have a TA with Japan, they have an EPA. U.K. have built on that with greater emphasis on standards &amp; and more liberalised import documentation. It is tailored towards the UK market and will have reduced tax &amp; duty compared to EU. Greater technological exchanges too

If that doesn’t happen, as seems very likely, then the WA becomes null and void on 31/12. There should be no legal repercussions at all. Gov are right to put alternative plans in place

1301213845986455552 2020-09-03 01:42:10 +0800 <lienomail> @jonw101961 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline If identity is required to access anything in your life right now, you will definitely produce it in one form or another. Financial services, healthcare, rentals (House or car), holidays, etc etc.  Everybody identifies themselves no matter how much they pretend they don't.
1301208973526347781 2020-09-03 01:22:49 +0800 <lienomail> @LordJustin12 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline ID cards cannot connect you to criminal or illegal activities unless you've already been convicted. Not sure what else you need to worry about because most things are public record any way.
1301202420094185474 2020-09-03 00:56:46 +0800 <lienomail> @janekin24 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline I get it, folks are concerned, because this promo is designed to look like official Government policy, which it isn't. It's actually an opportunistic business, Roqu Group, trying to convince everyone to use their service &amp; rack up big profits on the back of the virus scare.
1301198103505252352 2020-09-03 00:39:37 +0800 <lienomail> @jonw101961 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline The 'State' can already track you if they could be arsed to do so. Cell phone, texts, emails, C/Card, Store card, Bank acc, Voter register, Rent or rates payments, Tax record, Mortgage &amp; loans, passport, Flights &amp; hotel registrations, on &amp; on &amp; on...………. You get the drift.
1301195394345578497 2020-09-03 00:28:51 +0800 <lienomail> @janekin24 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline Don't believe everything you see on Fakebook or YouTube. There will never be a mandatary requirement to be vaccinated. It is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and will always be down to individual choice. If you think I'm wrong please show me the evidence.
1301193367796281344 2020-09-03 00:20:48 +0800 <lienomail> @jonw101961 @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline Of course, 99% of folk already do provide ID for a myriad of reasons in their daily lives. And that proof of identity can be any number or variety of documents, what better than one simple electronic record to confirm who you are. Please don't try telling me you don't have ID.
1301172189081862144 2020-09-02 22:56:39 +0800 <lienomail> What price Independance when the cashflow tap is turned off ?
1301170851572781056 2020-09-02 22:51:20 +0800 <lienomail> Please take a listen to Douglas Murray. You wont regret it.  (Unless you are a member of the leftwaffe).
1301104777883987968 2020-09-02 18:28:47 +0800 <lienomail> @Reprobate24 @GowTolson Very true Tom, they are all intellectual minnows. But then again, they only have a very shallow pool to fish from
1301103771062276097 2020-09-02 18:24:47 +0800 <lienomail> @patsy_murrell Good question!  I don't think it's anything to do with who you are, it's more to do with where you are and the culture that is dominant there. I worked in Zimbabwe for three months, and everybody saw my colour, same in Memphis TN if I wondered into the wrong part of town.
1301101539319316485 2020-09-02 18:15:54 +0800 <lienomail> @GowTolson Yes !   SNP are irrational in everything they do.
1301078673215426560 2020-09-02 16:45:03 +0800 <lienomail> If creepy Joe Biden wins in November...……………………………….. This is the leftwaffe world we can get ready for.  (Sound on)  https://t.co/EXGwM9GUtS
1301076933418119168 2020-09-02 16:38:08 +0800 <lienomail> @salaxxxxxxxx @MailOnline Good!  I'm all for that. If you have nothing to hide and are legally entitled to be here, then there is no rational reason to object. ID cards should be a prerequisite before casting a vote or for accessing any other state related privileges or benefits.
1301068776058900482 2020-09-02 16:05:43 +0800 <lienomail> @KrystynaWisson It never happened !  Fakebook hoax !  https://t.co/nap100f8C1 via @FullFact
1301063379151355904 2020-09-02 15:44:16 +0800 <lienomail> @RayTPringle1 😂😂😂 You were not alone Ray 👍
1301062877101674496 2020-09-02 15:42:17 +0800 <lienomail> @GrovePortland This Saturday 5th September, mass blockade by land and sea of Port of Dover to protest illegal immigration. Be there if you care.
1301058833666715648 2020-09-02 15:26:13 +0800 <lienomail> @KrystynaWisson It's a Polar Bear with a birth defect, but don't worry, it won't hurt you, it's 'armless'  😂😂😂
1301050466508382208 2020-09-02 14:52:58 +0800 <lienomail> @PDF53 I think somebody in France is making good money selling new boats and motors, and somebody in the UK is making even more money selling second hand, only used once, rubber boats and engines. No outlay, 100% profit.
1300856669048635394 2020-09-02 02:02:53 +0800 <lienomail> @PeterEJKeats Sharp comment !  😂😂
1300855600495067137 2020-09-02 01:58:38 +0800 <lienomail> @superal999 No! Scottsdale Arizona.  We all need Trump to win, if the Dems win the whole world will be in trouble.
1300746157472313344 2020-09-01 18:43:45 +0800 <lienomail> @superal999 By the way, the big event this Saturday will be the blockade of Dover Port as a protest against Border Force complicity in encouraging more and more illegal immigrants to cross the channel
1300744492237160449 2020-09-01 18:37:08 +0800 <lienomail> @superal999 Really busy with work now AK. I only have time to tweet during break and lunch times. I'll be off to the States soon so the 8hr time zone difference makes it even more difficult to keep up with tweets.
1300738312139927553 2020-09-01 18:12:34 +0800 <lienomail> I’ve no time for Ed Davey but I had to share this thread so you could enjoy the replies 😂😂😂😂. As ever the Lib Delusionals are the biggest joke in town
1300734412812943360 2020-09-01 17:57:05 +0800 <lienomail> I tweeted this earlier, but for the avoidance of doubt, when I asked what's the 'point' of this video, that was my feeble attempt at a joke. I'm sorry to those who took me seriously, but 'Point' is the clue word as anyone who watched the whole thing would clearly understand.  https://t.co/fgwtKgZaxY
1300731278225027072 2020-09-01 17:44:37 +0800 <lienomail> @eggie63 I know!!!  That’s why I mentioned ‘point’ in my obviously failed attempt at humour.
1300729963600064512 2020-09-01 17:39:24 +0800 <lienomail> @johntcovell What?  Sitting on a pointed stick? 😂😂😂
1300729756049174529 2020-09-01 17:38:34 +0800 <lienomail> @LindaL16 Lesson learned. Note to self, never attempt ironic humour on twitter.
1300729174009806850 2020-09-01 17:36:16 +0800 <lienomail> @RayTPringle1 😂😂😂.  That’s what I was attempting Ray with my reference to ‘point’ !!    It was a joke 🙄
1300685758689353733 2020-09-01 14:43:45 +0800 <lienomail> This is a good read. The UK sacrificed so much to free  Europe from fascism, but 80 years on, we face a new, must-win ‘Battle of Britain’ to restore our own  freedoms  https://t.co/a0zzuGfouL
1300671708412678144 2020-09-01 13:47:55 +0800 <lienomail> @LeaveHQ He has performed in an exemplary manner as the UK Lead Negotiator. There are red lines beyond which he cannot cross. The EU are intransigent with their demands for ECJ Governance, Level playing field and Continued access to UK fisheries. Real leavers did not vote for any of that
