1342178280137490434 2020-12-25 02:40:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> @McKaylaRoseJ @TheRightMelissa The deprogramming starts strong, but then tapers to a crawl, similar to the Obama economy.
1342166853393801216 2020-12-25 01:54:48 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jperky1956 Imagine a life of sitting around waiting for someone to play a round of golf so you could fake being offended for an opportunity to jerk off the previous establishment leaders. What a hero to incels everywhere.
1342166139724562433 2020-12-25 01:51:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BarrettMelva @realDonaldTrump That's a chan post and could have been written by anyone on Earth.
1342156253213110281 2020-12-25 01:12:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ttocs35 Sounded like a fat man slapping the water.
1342154275615633409 2020-12-25 01:04:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @WhiteHouse @SickoftheSwamp What a beautiful way to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Thank you so much for your tireless work for our country and our people. Your supporters love you and return the Christmas wishes to you and your family! God Bless.
1342153098417098752 2020-12-25 01:00:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Rowemanite @WhiteHouse OMG, fuck off you cynical prick.
1342150499097829379 2020-12-25 00:49:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me I never expect to be offended, so it's always a surprise when it happens and usually it's the government's fault.
1342149529873883138 2020-12-25 00:45:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me Well, okay, go for it.
1342124999616954370 2020-12-24 23:08:30 +0800 <swampdecrial> @mbdcares @RandPaul I bet you'd like to listen to Dr. Jill Biden talk about her expert analysis of wiping her husbands butt after his recent stroke.
1342120068407291904 2020-12-24 22:48:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> @NewRightNetwork @DailyMail And they are trying to take away power from the President, they are going to need a better bill with more support.
1342119613153370116 2020-12-24 22:47:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me @AkaMrJenkins Now I can't unsee it.
1341868190759084033 2020-12-24 06:08:02 +0800 <swampdecrial> For those that think countries don't respect us. Iran's squawking is the perfect example of what happens when they don't. Notice they were pretty quiet the last 4 years, but now that they think Biden will win, they start chatting. They aren't gonna like 4 more years of Trump!
1341867649475764224 2020-12-24 06:05:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoanneWT09 @realDonaldTrump We just got so many nice new boots, be a shame to lose them in Iran's ass.
1341867322273894410 2020-12-24 06:04:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> Where are those super hornets that they talked about earlier in the year? And have they ever been given a proper tour of DC?
1341866827627061248 2020-12-24 06:02:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RandPaul @J12Young There is a double standard. If us common folk violate the rules we can get fined, or even in some places go to jail. Public officials violate the rules and they can just say oopsie on TV and nothing happens. It's time for government to fear the people again.
1341865884676206594 2020-12-24 05:58:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ksorbs @worleyval7 Yes please
1341865669323796480 2020-12-24 05:58:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @randallretail @realDonaldTrump Those have clearly not been launched.
1341864659318661121 2020-12-24 05:54:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Perhaps they've been watching fake news and forgot who the President of this country was? Dear Iran, if you fuck around with us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.
1341784278091390977 2020-12-24 00:34:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ByronYork @HotlineJosh The only thing he's coming back to is sugar and high calorie foods.
1341783069120970753 2020-12-24 00:29:47 +0800 <swampdecrial> @LetItRain233 Yeah, they are always happy to spend more money on socialist programs. They'll also happily give us all more money as long as they get to keep all of their other bloated spending in the bill.
1341775499148865536 2020-12-23 23:59:42 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me Not to say it's not worth fighting for, but we're gonna need to tear down and rebuild. We're gonna have to take it back.
1341774932330594306 2020-12-23 23:57:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me I think it's mostly lost, currently we have only the illusion of liberty left.
1341763085359570945 2020-12-23 23:10:22 +0800 <swampdecrial> @vegasrenae I'm very much a Christian and I don't say it, thou shall not take the Lord's name in vain. Society uses it all the time, but that is no excuse, we are called to be more.
1341750063526268930 2020-12-23 22:18:38 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me We aren't getting it back at this point, save for a convention of the states.
1341747429922779136 2020-12-23 22:08:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @freedragonfly17 @ReneeCarrollAZ It's 1 trick pony. boomer. haha
1341746505619824642 2020-12-23 22:04:30 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me Perhaps, but at some point they are going to try and seize our guns with or without these machines.
1341744681013686273 2020-12-23 21:57:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> @HawleyMO Are you sure that reason isn't, "because it helps the people I owe favors to?" or "because my party says so"?
1341744192679268355 2020-12-23 21:55:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me True, although were the enemies of Hitler the enemies of the people as well? There was a time in our country where the people would do this themselves instead of hoping for their politicians to do the dirty work for them.
1341742880893923328 2020-12-23 21:50:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AceSix4 @NewRightNetwork @GOP lol. This was hidden for containing "sensitive content".  Twitter is so cucked.
1341595175437611014 2020-12-23 12:03:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JakeHighwell @realDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz Twitter won't let me retweet this...
1341542532820418562 2020-12-23 08:33:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RepArmstrongND @Racheka1 Easy, vote no.
1341445094738636807 2020-12-23 02:06:48 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JackPosobiec Because they are weak and small minded. Meanwhile the establishment goons made sure to get all of their wishes on it.
1341444719725981701 2020-12-23 02:05:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> It's also nice to see @RandPaul trending on the biased twatter feed. You know when sensible person is trending that the left is just having a pissing contest about something. Suck it haters.
1341417180156588042 2020-12-23 00:15:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Early morning, which is the same time that they take down statues of historical figures. They have to operate in the darkness, because they are evil people hell-bent on destroying our country and taking their sheeple along with them.
1341415902315749378 2020-12-23 00:10:48 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Anything to satisfy their Trump Derangement Syndrome. They'd risk jail for Beijing Biden?!
1341415743229992963 2020-12-23 00:10:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump They hate America.
1341415694320209921 2020-12-23 00:09:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Those bitches!

1341399128736227328 2020-12-22 23:04:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> @anthonycwalker @mattgaetz Yes, @RepMattGaetz why can't you just live a shit life with no fun or entertainment, because the Covidians say so?
1341397070507356165 2020-12-22 22:55:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SecAzar @WhiteHouse @NIHClinicalCntr @NIHDirector @NIAIDNews Are you an essential front line worker? Or is virtue signaling an essential service now?
1341396676146302978 2020-12-22 22:54:24 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Hoosiers1986 Oh yah. . It's like when your employer gives you a 10 cent raise. Gee thanks.
1341391261694124035 2020-12-22 22:32:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> I love seeing @mattgaetz trending. I know the only reason Twitter would allow it is to try and slander him, which means that whatever he said or did is triggering the shit out of the whiny bitches on the left. Love it. #StopTheSteaI
1341358191343521793 2020-12-22 20:21:28 +0800 <swampdecrial> @senatemajldr So COVID-19 was just an excuse for government to abuse us with unconstitutional mandates and shutdowns, then spend a shitload of money on garbage? You all have lost it.  How long until the primaries? Defend Trump cut spending or lose your jobs!
1341104622677725191 2020-12-22 03:33:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> @timkaine Everything happens at 4AM, statues removed, mystery vote arrivals. The dems work hard in the cover of darkness.
1341104503043534849 2020-12-22 03:33:24 +0800 <swampdecrial> @timkaine Thank goodness the people of color in your district don't have to worry about racism anymore thanks to this. Not only does it not do anything to help the situation, it also signals how cowardice it is to remove in the middle of the night.
1341103921520123905 2020-12-22 03:31:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @timkaine This is so much easier than actually doing anything to help with racial equality and justice. Just remove a statue so you can virtue signal to all of your sheeple.
1340757166014271491 2020-12-21 04:33:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> I know it seems like I don't understand...but really I just don't care.
1340750420667461633 2020-12-21 04:06:24 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JackPosobiec They should be worried, but Antifa will be the least of their problems.
1340750186134581248 2020-12-21 04:05:28 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden How can you be wrong about so many things in such a small sentence? Your lies, like your votes are artificially inflated.
1340731274974126081 2020-12-21 02:50:20 +0800 <swampdecrial> Wearing a mask pressures others into wearing one. Guess what happens when you have the bravery to take the mask off?
1340729945237106689 2020-12-21 02:45:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Empressmish13 Forgive me for thinking a man would be responsible for making such an idiot statement, I guess women can be dumb too.
1340729098868502530 2020-12-21 02:41:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> Some of you are quick to bash Catholics, but some of us get it, don't be so harsh.  https://t.co/ityQU27OTt
1340726992241635335 2020-12-21 02:33:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> @kimKBaltimore Freedom of speech and expression. Screw the tyrants that seek to control you or pressure you into some bullshit apology.
1340721719426899969 2020-12-21 02:12:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> What a shithead. He will not be forgotten.
1340721191993159681 2020-12-21 02:10:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JDugudichi Nope... it's called minding your own business.
1340713530358706176 2020-12-21 01:39:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Brissapritzel Welcome, we need more people that love this place!
1340713011976220674 2020-12-21 01:37:45 +0800 <swampdecrial> @marcorubio Tyrants man...they are pushing people..it's not gonna end well.
1340535614400294912 2020-12-20 13:52:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump It's kind of our fault for complying with illegal shutdowns. We should have never obeyed this nonsense. But yes, they used scare tactics to keep us in hiding, now it's time to pay up...and they should surrender their salary for the next 5 years.
1340533872644206596 2020-12-20 13:45:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @GDVegasK @realDonaldTrump They didn't save us in 1776 either.

1340388643584749570 2020-12-20 04:08:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ZeroWarningShot @GOP Yeah.. The campaigns are ruthless.
1340374628926164993 2020-12-20 03:13:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ZeroWarningShot @GOP It's essentially unlimited.
1340326014518517763 2020-12-19 23:59:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BeholdIsrael @reubing It seems like that's a risk they are willing to take in order to keep their corruption hidden. What should have been the end of the democrat party is quickly becoming the end of the Republican party as they seem unwilling to act to defend the truth and integrity of the republic.
1340325582538743808 2020-12-19 23:58:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> @yogagenie @DJNazSD Their are legit businesses like dance studios that are providing a community service, by providing children with a means to exercise and socialize outside of the house. These are all shutdown and being treated like gyms.
1340324567231967232 2020-12-19 23:54:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump Anyone that is hated by the press and the establishment is my guy 100%.
1340323973331038208 2020-12-19 23:51:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump It's not just weak Republicans, it's all weak politicians. Why aren't the democrats concerned with vote integrity? Both parties seem to be perfectly okay with Beijing Biden destroying our country as long as their corruption can remain hidden.
1340322984318427137 2020-12-19 23:47:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me will? They have.
1340172554242322432 2020-12-19 13:50:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me Wait until the headache is gone, BEFORE you lay down. You can sleep sitting up, but don't lay until the headache is gone. Also, don't lose your pants.
1340027342874357761 2020-12-19 04:13:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @senatemajldr Fight for Trump you coward!

1339998092490371076 2020-12-19 02:16:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @catchbluefish @ChuckCallesto @kevinr10219311 The only thing in the Constitution about this is the 12th Amendment. Everything else is tied up in and around 3 U.S. Code § 15 which has never been utilized or challenged in courts. Which is a nightmare to read and could be interpreted many ways.
1339990712964829187 2020-12-19 01:47:36 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ChuckCallesto @kevinr10219311 It's Amazing, when Gore filed his case in 2000 the Supreme court was happy to intervene, now here they just want to sit out.. They can keep sitting out when Pence rejects the democrat electors from the contested states.
1339990137707651079 2020-12-19 01:45:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AndrewYang I got 20k vaccines! Just ask dominion!
1339989958292090881 2020-12-19 01:44:36 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AndrewYang How do you know if a democrat has the vaccine? They'll tell you.
1339989870161383425 2020-12-19 01:44:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> @senatemajldr the end of the R party is near! If you turn your back on the President who got more votes than any Republican ever, your voters will turn their back on the entire party. What could have been the end of the D party is quickly turning into the end of Rs. Support Trump

1339773493899128835 2020-12-18 11:24:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @HUAC2_0 @freenaynow I demand higher quality propaganda.
1339770575603032066 2020-12-18 11:12:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tweettruth2me Especially when it protects only itself.
1339683685545762823 2020-12-18 05:27:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @thehill Says the same polls that had him up by 5 in Ohio? Or up by 3 in Florida? Or up by 3 in Iowa? Or up by 1 in Texas? Which lying garbage poll should we believe? The people are done listening to the propaganda media. Biden is a twat that hasn't done shit ever.
1339662669788434441 2020-12-18 04:04:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> @newtgingrich lol at Alexander. In before the delete.

1339596583009017859 2020-12-17 23:41:28 +0800 <swampdecrial> Georgia. . As a reminder. If you fail to elect a Republican Senate majority. Cocky Cuck Schumer will be the Senate Majority Leader which would only serve to turn the great state of GA into a lefty shithole.

1337079654839152643 2020-12-11 01:00:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @enthalpy32 Such a pillar of truth &amp; honestly you are. Advising people throw their votes away on invalid write-in candidates. If you actually cared, you'd suggest someone that was a valid write-in, but instead you wish to disenfranchise voters. Trump is and will remain your daddy.
1337075895266385932 2020-12-11 00:45:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @enthalpy32 Wrong. In GA you have to file an affidavit with the Secretary of State to be a legal write in candidate. If you aren't on the list of candidates, the vote will not count. You are trying to get people to throw away their vote to suppress the legal candidates. That's suppression.

Nothing trends on Twatter unless the left is pushing it, Twitter suppresses conservatives, so whenever you see anything trending including #civilwar , it's because the left is pushing it. The left is getting violent and out of control, because they are losing.
1337058617464385541 2020-12-10 23:36:30 +0800 <swampdecrial> @muravynik When I say "we", I wouldn't associate that with the degenerates at Charlottesville. I completely disavow neo-Nazis and white supremacists and all racists. However, those degenerates would be the left's problem not ours.
1337029063572119554 2020-12-10 21:39:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VicToensing @stacy_redvirgo There are lawyers that claim that the legislature surrendered the power by codifying it in law. Meanwhile @JennaEllisEsq has clearly stated that the Constitution gives them authority to reclaim that power at anytime.
1337028457285509120 2020-12-10 21:36:39 +0800 <swampdecrial> So the whole time the left was on their Trump-Russia collusion witchhunt they were all literally in bed with the CCP? What a bunch of assholes. It's one thing to sell out America, but now there are dozens of sexually frustrated Chinese people. We aren't sending out best folks.

1336051594878734336 2020-12-08 04:54:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> Ballots are the currency of elections. They should be tracked and accounted for. . But that didn't happen here, the leftists made it rain and the we people are just their sluts.
1336042048647028737 2020-12-08 04:17:01 +0800 <swampdecrial> I thought the left were "highly educated." Why can't they follow simple election rules to preserve election integrity? Why can't they count correctly? Why can't they verify signatures? Why can't they ever do the right thing? Why can't they keep their hands off kids?
1336028291367628802 2020-12-08 03:22:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DrEricDing Do we need masks forever? Are there risks with wearing a mask long term? Is mask wearing bad for your health? Why didn't we have people wear masks for bad flu seasons? Why do mask wearers still get sick?
1336024624031813634 2020-12-08 03:07:47 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SenSchumer @JamaalBowmanNY @MondaireJones @RitchieTorres Millions of people like me had to take private loans to get our education. My government loans were paid off long ago. I guaran-fucking-tee you that you will not help people with private loans, and instead tax me to pay for other's government loans. Stop lying.
1336024099450204163 2020-12-08 03:05:42 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Breaking911 You have to answer the specific questions or nobody is going to believe you. You can't just come out and say, "nothing to see here, this is hurting our feelings" and pretend like it's okay. Audit the fucking signatures, dickfuck.
1335945940323209218 2020-12-07 21:55:07 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realTylerZed They should have just come out and said they were committing voter/election fraud. Then everyone would have just ignored it.

1335939985317523456 2020-12-07 21:31:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> I'm convinced that people that regurgitate the popular vote numbers were never popular, care about too many irrelevant things, and are either single or in relationships where their spouse is cheating on them for a person that doesn't gobble dicks like a woodchipper.

1335919809498927108 2020-12-07 20:11:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @GabrielSterling Trump is the will of the voters. The legislature is the safeguard against those fraudulent fuckers that dare try and steal the election.

1335833230067560453 2020-12-07 14:27:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> The way to combat vote fraud is to negate the suspect votes...this teaches the would be scammers that if they want to votes to count, they better handle it correctly. Tossing the votes out is what punishes them for the misconduct.

They issue their corrections like the dems issue fake ballots. In the middle of the night when nobody is watching.

1334836743242215424 2020-12-04 20:27:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> They want us to believe these are a large batch of early votes that sat somewhere for 7 hours before showing up at 3AM by truck. By contrast Florida had to have a total count of early votes by Nov 3 so that there are no surprises. Those rules were ignored here.

The left's blind loyalty to the accord is just another example of their brainwashed sheep mentality.

1330620031575740420 2020-11-23 05:11:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> The problem with the media isn't the proof they claim to have or lack. It's the fact that they close their eyes when the proof doesn't match their agenda and circle jerk it endlessly when it does.
1330619535448268800 2020-11-23 05:09:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Cernovich I like how so many add the words "without evidence" when it's something you can personally see clear as day if you just opened your eyes.

They took their land and in many cases made their reservations slaves to government handouts. Many suffer from addiction and depression due to generations of government failing them.
1330585227358507011 2020-11-23 02:53:33 +0800 <swampdecrial> Congrats to the left. They have ruined everything. I ignore pretty much all media now, because it's all propaganda. They have ruined legit business, by tainting it all with their lies.

1329437928729276418 2020-11-19 22:54:36 +0800 <swampdecrial> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Amen! The races that show a narrow Biden lead are a complete farce. He's not narrowly ahead, he's not even narrowly behind. He's way behind. It was fraud that inched him ahead. Not legal votes.

1329435941556121612 2020-11-19 22:46:42 +0800 <swampdecrial> Biden not only lost Georgia, he didn't even get close. This is all nonsense. If they would follow even the 2018 rules and toss out ballots without signature match, Trump wins and it's not even close.
1329435443318939649 2020-11-19 22:44:44 +0800 <swampdecrial> Progressives vomit phrases like Republicans are in charge of Georgia as if we are too stupid to believe that some republicans are shithead never Trumpers that seem to hate our country enough to appoint a Biden puppet govt. over the will of the people. Trump won GA it's not close.

She continues to call him out on certain things (which is fair), but overall she has supported his policies. Many people are mad at Trump for his rhetoric. But his policies are seriously spot on for what the US needs right now.
1329424067577982979 2020-11-19 21:59:31 +0800 <swampdecrial> @WayneDupreeShow @BooyahBoyz I've been listening to her interviews lately and it turns out FWIW, she seems really level headed. We lambasted her for that debate performance, but she said later she was trying to give Trump a chance to clear the air, not throw him under the bus.
1329423222555750400 2020-11-19 21:56:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AndrewYang Or the government could just stay out of our lives, let us go to work, tax us less and let us pay for our own shit.

1329272143822065668 2020-11-19 11:55:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @pvtjokerus @RonCentrelloJr This is true. A friend of mine was escorting a VIP through there. Stopped for the night in a secluded area for some Zzs. Worst nightmares ever. At dawn realized it was a taliban grave site. Evil permeates the lands there.

It's an epic scandal &amp; in every case they chose to ignore the integrity laws it helped the demonrats. This is 3rd world voting integrity at this point, a total sham, political theatre.

1328827369432485888 2020-11-18 06:28:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> Biden was so lucky that some of these districts turned out in numbers that exceeded places like Australia that have mandatory voting. Nowhere else, but these certain districts he needed in these swing states. Weird and lucky, huh?
1328818021260005384 2020-11-18 05:51:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SenSanders Maybe if our K-12 wasn't so worthless we wouldn't have to worry about buying more school.

1328781465124040706 2020-11-18 03:26:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> So the progressives that claim my body my choice, and fight for medically assisted suicide think they can stand on their pile of dead bodies and tell the rest of us we can't choose our own risk of COVID exposure?
1328772654657101824 2020-11-18 02:51:02 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Rightwingmadman FEC deals with campaign finance and not with election integrity specifically. Not saying that makes him less credible, but making sure everyone knows the difference.
1328751674425569281 2020-11-18 01:27:40 +0800 <swampdecrial> Legislatures that are not standing against reports of fraud. They will be coming for your election next time. Your inaction today will hurt you later.

Idiots.
1328714487332020235 2020-11-17 22:59:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SenWarren Are you going to cancel the private loans I took out for education? No you aren't. You will cancel the govt. loans which are easy to pay back leaving people like me high &amp; dry. How about you cut my taxes and let me keep my money so I can pay off my shit instead of giving it away.

1328671928551432192 2020-11-17 20:10:47 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Cernovich There is always someone at the top and always someone at the bottom. Need is relative. You can't tax someone just for being rich, it's not a crime to have money or net worth.

1328533568096759810 2020-11-17 11:01:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AOC Actually it is, because government is to apply the law equally. You complain about the system disenfranchising groups of people, yet as long as it checks an agenda item of yours, screw everyone else? Really now?

Parts of the midwest have been seeing spikes and the hospitals are slowly filling up, so they need to slow it down if possible. She isn't a iron fisted governor like some.

1328523010647740417 2020-11-17 10:19:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden This statement means nothing. Even your tweets are making less and less sense.

1328422509117575168 2020-11-17 03:39:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DanRather He must not do anything until he's damn well done with his lawsuits and all sides of the argument have been heard. Stop trying to get in the way of our process.
1328422292037177344 2020-11-17 03:38:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SenWarren I have thousands of dollars in private student loan debt. None of these programs ever benefit people like me. They only serve to benefit those with government loans. So you'll increase my taxes while I pay loans, it's like a kick in the nuts rather than a helping hand. No thanks.
1328421810837270528 2020-11-17 03:36:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AOC No it isn't , because many of us had to take out private loans instead of government loans to be able to afford college and no government program in the last 10 years I've been paying has ever benefited a person like me with private student loans.
1328418059795783681 2020-11-17 03:22:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @conservmillen I think the answer is that we are racist, but that claim cannot be proven with any evidence.
1328417873774194690 2020-11-17 03:21:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @IlhanMN It's not. He has the legal right to challenge this and that's what he's doing. If the evidence is not there and the courts rule against it, it will be over, but until then, it's just sad that the left are categorically against letting all possible legally challenges be vetted.

1328330417259286530 2020-11-16 21:33:45 +0800 <swampdecrial> After the sham election the left was celebrating in the streets, COVID was of no concern. Now that Trump is fighting this in courts, it's back to COVID to try and make Trump look bad again. The left is just full of assholes.
1328330228570214403 2020-11-16 21:33:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BillOReilly @allie1dav It's like the media has a underwear drawer of Trump critics and everyday they just switch them out, because they got all shitty.
1328329410693492738 2020-11-16 21:29:45 +0800 <swampdecrial> All of these sad news organizations keep all of the Trump haters like Obama and Bolton on the shelf and rotate them out like a dirty pair of underwear.
1328329084141789185 2020-11-16 21:28:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @rickklein You know why John hasn't seen the evidence? Because he's a washed up old leaky (in more ways than one) hack that isn't privy to the evidence. The evidence is in court. John doesn't know shit, because he has proven himself to be untrustworthy. Just another Trump hater.
1328328652266893317 2020-11-16 21:26:44 +0800 <swampdecrial> @conservatyler The system shows that he did, but they weren't legal or necessarily even real votes.
1328328456724226055 2020-11-16 21:25:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> @GOP Joe can't come out of his basement. He was recently sent a new blankie that smells like children so that he'll stay down there and snuggle with it until it's all over.
1328328070504312832 2020-11-16 21:24:25 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AmbJohnBolton @ThisWeekABC I can't stand you, why would I watch your interview? The fact that you've been through so many transitions is evidence enough that your have spent way too much time in the ivory tower of government.

1328324675672416258 2020-11-16 21:10:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> There is an important thing that we need to remember through these crazy times. As we deal with potentially rigged elections and global pandemics, we should never forget that Bill Clinton is a rapist.

1328190967686557697 2020-11-16 12:19:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Please concede the election. I feel bad that the dems are using your hollowed out shell of a mind to cling onto power. They used you and conceding can be your last act of defiance against letting them take advantage of you.

This is outrageous that these people can continue to willfully violate the letter and spirit of court orders to observe counting.

I guess we can credit that to @realDonaldTrump however, it's important for everyone to know that "secure" doesn't mean legitimate, &amp; security doesn't mean integrity. Words matter, know what they mean, the media obviously doesn't.

Senile and not very smart make it very tough to form sentences. You remind me of someone that marries a old guy knowing he'll die soon and you get the inheritance. Very sad really.
1326879944924868608 2020-11-12 21:30:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KDKA Well, Biden hasn't legally won it. The media doesn't elect the President.

1326501622676131842 2020-11-11 20:26:46 +0800 <swampdecrial> @christianllamar That's why there are multiple lawsuits in each area. Recounting is the easiest to achieve, it slows things down a bit so we can look into all of the other claims. There are multiple vectors of fraud that may have been used all of them need examined.

Can we stop pretending that any leader could stop this, there are 195 countries and nobody stopped it. You think Biden is smarter than 195 world leaders? HA, naïve or just stupid?
1326161511136505856 2020-11-10 21:55:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @LizRNC That's interesting, but need more. "Thousands" is pretty vague. 2 thousand? 10 thousand? 100 thousand? Also, rental cars tend to have out of state plates. I'm not saying it's not true, I'm just saying it's easy to refute.

Trump received the highest percentage of the non-white vote of any Republican. The future of the Republican party is what the dems wrongly claim they have, which is love and diversity.

1326148296138756098 2020-11-10 21:02:47 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ChuckCallesto @RobinFredricks1 Cool, but this is illegal. We are allowed to travel in this country freely without being subjects to government restrictions.
1326147950465134593 2020-11-10 21:01:24 +0800 <swampdecrial> When it comes to government, it's always worse than the worst case scenario. If you think there is widespread fraud, it's probably worse than that.
1326146976522629122 2020-11-10 20:57:32 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jperky1956 That's usually how people talk to elderly people that are just mumbling on the other end.
1326146575828197376 2020-11-10 20:55:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> @washingtonpost They aren't refusing to concede. . They are making sure they lost before they do. There is a difference.
1326142989543088131 2020-11-10 20:41:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> I don't just outright deny friend requests, I accept, then check their messenger status, when I see they are online, then I go back and delete them, so while in the middle of them stalking my photos they suddenly lose access, this way there is no question that I don't like them.
1326031208921395201 2020-11-10 13:17:31 +0800 <swampdecrial> Normally this level wouldn't be possible. It's alleged that voter integrity laws were circumvented resulting in a large amount of fraud. Regardless of the outcome we need to trust the result and any nefarious actors need punished.
1326029292216717313 2020-11-10 13:09:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JohnJHarwood What does the left do when they lose? That's right, claim victory and circle jerk the narrative as if it were true? Lefties always think they have the high ground when their standing on a pile of shit.

1326002800732610560 2020-11-10 11:24:38 +0800 <swampdecrial> Not sure about NY &amp; Cali, but the other two kept integrity rules in place that allowed them to use tried and true methods of counting, quickly and accurately. The others got cute and screwed it all up.

Yeah, but it's evidence, the court decides.  Well if you aren't going to provide any evidence.  I just did, you refused to cover it.  Well, we are asking about it now. We provided it, but you insist on cutting me of

Before the election the money is used for promoting the Trump-Pence campaign. After the election it shifts into a different pool of funds? I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing.

It's a proper title, like you are a Dickhead and my President is President Donald J Trump for 4 more years. The legal votes need counted and the illegal ones tossed out. You know you lost, nobody except simps think you are in your right mind. #trump2020

1325868479392702465 2020-11-10 02:30:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> I think we can blame Biden for Alex Trebek. Since we don't require any proof to blame anyone for anything, according to the left. Corona, Russia? Just blame it on someone.
1325864385009639424 2020-11-10 02:14:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> If the candidates were flipped, could you imagine the involvement of the demonrats? They would crawl naked over broken glass for Biden. Where is that same concern by the repubs right now? No loyalty. No care for Americans.
1325860066088595462 2020-11-10 01:57:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> It seems as though the coronavirus must be responding to the media reports of a Biden victory. Is it magically getting better now? How about we have Trump be President and just tell the virus Biden won. It'll never see that one coming.

1325790812689620997 2020-11-09 21:22:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CondoleezzaRice Why is it when a democrat is "allegedly" in charge does respect and empathy suddenly become a requirement? Those a-holes showed us nothing of the sort for the last 4 years, now we are supposed to just comply? No, we are now going to #resist and fuck the system.
1325774371072466946 2020-11-09 20:16:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> @sleepywizard Luntz is a "pollster" himself and a scam artist that was totally wrong. This fat slob needs to find himself a new job on a treadmill somewhere.

1325670235421151232 2020-11-09 13:23:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> Almost every conservative I follow - Did you all hear that Fox is a piece of shit corporate media outlet?   I'm sorry you just now learned this and that red pill makes you want to tell the world, but I think we get it.. Just turn it off... Pretty easy.
1325667529050697728 2020-11-09 13:12:23 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump @fliflisky Yeah you did. Your supporters know it and understand what you are up against. We are with you.

1325665467365814272 2020-11-09 13:04:11 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tedlieu @megynkelly How about how you shouldn't feel, which is like a victim. Maybe try taking a joke and not being so sensitive and butt hurt about everything. If you don't like America you are free to go, but nobody is telling you to do shit.

1325655711288864769 2020-11-09 12:25:25 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jaketapper Just yesterday it was reported somewhere that Jared was pushing for a concession. Maybe your sources are just bad.
1325655425010819072 2020-11-09 12:24:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche I didn't. I can't overstate the level is distrust us Trump supporters have for the media. I'm sure it seems like conspiracy to those on the left, but to us it's apparent that they hate us and we hate them.  🤷🏻‍♂️
1325654665313316864 2020-11-09 12:21:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche It's interesting. Although as a Trump supporter we assume all establishment people are against him.  It's no secret the Bush's hate him. It wouldn't be too weird for their lawyer to try and discredit him.
1325654147711045633 2020-11-09 12:19:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche I do know this. It also seems as though the total votes for Pres greatly outnumbered any down ballot votes in many cases, also somewhat suspect. Not impossible, but it doesn't really ever happen. Also many mail in ballots reported to only have Biden filled out no down ballots.
1325599253125861376 2020-11-09 08:41:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche Then of course the possibility of the software glitches of the machines, the lack of meaninful access for poll watchers/count watchers. The dirty voter rolls, several dead people casting ballots..all jabs at vote integrity. Enough to change the outcome? Maybe. Maybe not.

1325596119154483200 2020-11-09 08:28:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche Irregularities that if candidates were reversed, I think Biden supporters would rightfully be concerned with. Biden under performed HC in many places, but in places that tipped his totals seemed to out perform even Obama. I'm not saying it's impossible, but does it hurt to look?
1325486116921872389 2020-11-09 01:11:31 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VoteBlue50 @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche Huh.. that's what we said when we elected Trump.

1325474549329256448 2020-11-09 00:25:33 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DavidStaggerLee @Yamiche Good good..
1325474271729217536 2020-11-09 00:24:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Chailey88 @Yamiche Fighters don't back down. There are a lot of claims of fraud and a lot of suspicious numbers..  We need to double check it's all legit. It would be stupid and actually a disservice to future elections to concede before making sure everything has been verified.
1325473463029682179 2020-11-09 00:21:14 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CourtneyBedore @Yamiche Nah. It's the weekend after a stressful week. Tomorrow it's back to pushing to verify that this election was free and fair.
1325472602647908355 2020-11-09 00:17:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Yamiche Calm under pressure, stepping away from the craziness for the weekend. You know he stopped for a photo op with a wedding party, they were thrilled. Biden wishes he could golf. Harris is probably help him pick out his casket, that poor puppet.
1325471675463442434 2020-11-09 00:14:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Find the part in there where it's cool to kill unborn children. Fucking hypocrite.

1324817190252613632 2020-11-07 04:53:26 +0800 <swampdecrial> If they were alleging mass scale fraud I would be all for having it looked into and investigated thoroughly. Their are just taking the "nothing to see here" approach and it's a disgrace to America.

1324808136503558148 2020-11-07 04:17:28 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CNN When it's over it's over, people understand this. But there needs to be more explanation into claims of fraud and integrity issues other than, "nothing to see here" and just pretending like they don't exist.
1324804533898383367 2020-11-07 04:03:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @kallman_tom Well. . Not much, although the lawyers could argue that it's destruction of evidence.

1324785997670993924 2020-11-07 02:49:29 +0800 <swampdecrial> Wonder if Dems wish they could change their fraud from electing Biden to trying to save some of their down ballots. They might manage to fraud their way to elect a senile old man, but republicans get literally everything else.
1324755496004366337 2020-11-07 00:48:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @nick_rumore @realDonaldTrump The problem is that both candidates performed and got votes exactly per expectations in all the states that didn't selectively enforce voter integrity rules. The states that changed/selectively enforced integrity rules are way outside normal expectations, all in Biden's favor.

1324382196808011778 2020-11-06 00:04:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> So instead of being fair, the democrats are just trying to make us losers like them? Everyone is losing, because of their hatred for Trump.

At this point nobody is trusting the process, and whenever the people in charge name their person they will not be trusted as the true winner by half the country. This is an evil sham.

1324206414651424770 2020-11-05 12:26:26 +0800 <swampdecrial> Do Biden ballots count as 10 votes, or what? There's no explanation for this. Biden fans are pretending like there's nothing to see here, but I'm yet to see a reasonable explanation for any of these crazy numbers.

1323687914975494148 2020-11-04 02:06:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> I just thought about later tonight when Trump is declared the winner. I smiled. Let's make it so! VOTE. #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica

A vote for Trump once again steps America back off the edge of leftist tyranny, economic depression, infringement on our rights and our sovereignty. Let's do this, run up the score, no mercy!

1323504265940344833 2020-11-03 13:56:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> Everyone knows someone that didn't vote Trump in 2016, but is voting for him in 2020.

1323436194139676672 2020-11-03 09:25:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Biden said, "...most of the youth involved in the system are not the so-called ‘super predators'"   Translation: He thinks most are predators and only some are super predators.

America has institutions such as the supreme court that are important and laws such as the 1st and 2nd Amendment, which you will try to usurp with your radical agenda. Shut down our economy and starve people and drive them to your level of mentality.

1323387094669103106 2020-11-03 06:10:45 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CHIZMAGA It's not like we have to kick Joe out of he loses, we just kind of wait until the gnashing stops and he'll just go back to the basement to eat oatmeal.
1323386434888282113 2020-11-03 06:08:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> @tillmantweets @realDonaldTrump So let's follow their logic. If racists voted him in, then they will be happy to vote for him again, due to being such an overt racist. . Or he wasn't a racist, so they won't vote for him, but non-whites everywhere will be excited to vote for him. . Either way he wins?

This is about policy, not rhetoric. Not liking Trump's ego is a insane reason to vote for corrupt old crook Joe Biden. Please just stay home.

1323281164661129216 2020-11-02 23:09:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden You should make a plan for your concession speech. Will you tell the violent democrat mobs in our major cities to stand down when Trump wins? You could call for peace, but your handlers wouldn't like that, would they?

Early voting gives dems several days to "find" ballots to make up any deficits. I don't like it.

1321587618052820993 2020-10-29 07:00:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KamalaHarris Very misleading and disingenuous and people will show you how they feel about it on Tuesday. 227k may have died, but standing on their bodies and pointing at Trump is just illustrating how fucking filthy you are mentally.
1321552525649170432 2020-10-29 04:40:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jaketapper Likely voter polls, by telephone are trash. Liberals love to answer the phone for pollsters. I'm not joking, real pollsters understand this sample bias.

1321551716018491392 2020-10-29 04:37:36 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jaketapper @MilesTaylorUSA This election has nothing to do with character of shit. It has to do with picking the person with the better of two policies. Do you want to be China's bitch and lock down the worlds greatest economy indefinitely? Vote Trump for policies not feelings.
1321551276753170435 2020-10-29 04:35:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> @GayRepublicSwag Trump on election day, in person. I feel like if you vote early, then the left knows how many ballots they need to print and stamp and submit on election day. Voting on the day gives them less time. Little time and big numbers are the enemy of fraud.

There is a small group of Ds that will vote Trump, about 10% I think according to polls. Those that think Joe's best days are behind him and those that are more libertarian types that think the left is nuts.

1320692927811723264 2020-10-26 19:45:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump We are trying Mr. President! The left and the corporate media are trying to keep us down. The electorate knows the left is on the wrong side of history! #VoteTrump2020ToSaveAmerica #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
1320691703100198913 2020-10-26 19:40:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump That's the problem, he doesn't think you are George, he is just stuck in the past. He mind keeps taking him back to the time when he was more important and relevant.
1320688601546579969 2020-10-26 19:27:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> Officially starting to unfollow people that like or retweet shit from the left without a comment as to why. Stop spreading their disease.

1320686547872657410 2020-10-26 19:19:44 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AnnCoulter TLDR. Vote TRUMP to save America from communism and socialism.

1319677086961979392 2020-10-24 00:28:30 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DrBiden I want a ruthless ass to turn DC on it's head. Niceness doesn't appeal to me for such a critical position.
1319651056343748609 2020-10-23 22:45:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> I like how dems think Biden is more popular than Hillary. Keep thinking it. It's gonna be funny.
1319650415999356929 2020-10-23 22:42:31 +0800 <swampdecrial> My favorite part was when Trump made Biden upset at Abraham Lincoln.

1319650142581149696 2020-10-23 22:41:26 +0800 <swampdecrial> Lefties think that if you stare at the ground a totally all natural wind turbine appears to give the world 100% renewable energy.  Someone makes them in a factory that pollutes with materials that pollute to dispose of and/or extract.
1319645070224723968 2020-10-23 22:21:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KamalaHarris Just like last time, Georgia will be Trump's before midnight eastern time.

1319636635475116034 2020-10-23 21:47:46 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden You are in a state of denial.
1319635630113067008 2020-10-23 21:43:46 +0800 <swampdecrial> @donsummer @SharylAttkisson I have been pulled over for driving while being a teenager. I have been pulled over (believe it or not) for being white in black neighborhood. Each time I made sure I was damn cooperative, because I know the side of the road isn't where you start some shit with an armed cop.
1319634156490575875 2020-10-23 21:37:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SharylAttkisson Not to mention my dad always told me that if a cop tells you to stop or "freeze" then you better do it unless you want to risk getting shot. Fair enough. Fight cops in the courtroom and not on the side of the road.
1319611857452355585 2020-10-23 20:09:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> @NPRpubliceditor You talked about Russia for 3 years without real evidence. So, this isn't working.
1319610606455050241 2020-10-23 20:04:20 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DonnaWR8 @FriendlyJMC How about we release all of the information? what is the point of this "look what I got" bullshit? Release it, or shut the fuck up. People deserve the truth, not a bunch of teases about "what's about to come out" shit or get off the pot. The election is in the balance here.
1319610156322344961 2020-10-23 20:02:33 +0800 <swampdecrial> @MariaBonanno9 @Kag2020Jeanne Well, then maybe the genius shouldn't have her twatter handle be @AOC if she doesn't want to go by that.
1319609768298897408 2020-10-23 20:01:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @seanhannity So @JoeBiden raised a druggie piece of shit kid. Then instead of cutting ties or trying to help him, he just decided instead to take money from the druggie in exchange for letting him use his name for self-enrichment. Way to stand up Joe. #chinabitchbiden
1319608468685398016 2020-10-23 19:55:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DonaldJTrumpJr @LongJunebug793 Biden said middle class people are sitting around the breakfast table acting like a bunch of entitled victims, crying about their situation. No Joe. We are middle class, because we work for a living, we earned ours. We don't have a corrupt son we can skim from.
1319608170755522560 2020-10-23 19:54:39 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DonaldJTrumpJr @LongJunebug793 They want everyone to go broke so they have to beg the government to help them. Total dependence. I refuse, dangerous freedom is better than safe tyranny.
1319607960105046017 2020-10-23 19:53:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @exjon @FriendlyJMC Solar and wind can be good one day, but they are still very costly. They work okay, but batteries need to get better to store massive amounts of power to keep them reliable. Also, none of this equipment is environmentally friendly to produce.
1319606924363653125 2020-10-23 19:49:42 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JackPosobiec What's the deal with this? Are you guys just going to keep the laptop and the contents hidden? Is this some kind of power move. Release it to the public, or stop talking about it. This "look what I got" bullshit is already old.
1319605670598070273 2020-10-23 19:44:43 +0800 <swampdecrial> @VeraAlthea_ @benshapiro Solar panels and wind turbines are not crafted out of thin air, u know this right? Their components are made in factories that produce waste &amp; have a carbon footprint. Their components in some cases require significant mining efforts to obtain &amp; have a fair amount of plastics.
1319603472778539009 2020-10-23 19:35:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> It's been several days now that several media outlets claim to have this #laptopfromhell and are hiding it from the public. What is this, a power trip? Release it.
1319602363578146818 2020-10-23 19:31:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Cernovich Democrats are rioting and burning our cities and telling us to lock ourselves in our home out of fear for corona. Yet Trump is the negative one. These shills are some pretty basic bitches.
1319601487010516993 2020-10-23 19:28:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Proven_Right @realDonaldTrump He thought he was being funny.

1319489203990876160 2020-10-23 12:01:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> Joe must think wind turbines are just created from thin air. They are made in plants that produce waste and have a large carbon footprint. Nothing is free Joe

1319001666033692674 2020-10-22 03:44:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> Democrats are blocking COVID relief. I'm fortunate enough to not need it, but I think it's pretty shitty of them to block it out of spite for Trump.

1318900765088452611 2020-10-21 21:03:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @nytimes Your polls are totally fucked up. Whatever method you are using to poll people is getting you an over sample of Trump haters. You know this right? Not that you have much credibility anyways after the 2016 polling debacle.

1318254257045442566 2020-10-20 02:14:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DrBiden We have the EC specifically so that one state doesn't decide the election for the whole country. If you plan on voting @JoeBiden just because you Trump says dumb things, you should just do us a favor and stay home. Biden's policies will bankrupt us all.     https://t.co/EXyywun8y8

1318182318847217672 2020-10-19 21:28:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KamalaHarris I looked, and voting early in my state is dumb. I'll vote day of and this way I don't have to rely on the mail. Do you really trust the mail? They are horrible.
1318176930450071553 2020-10-19 21:07:25 +0800 <swampdecrial> @benshapiro Funny how the left went insane when we were doing the #ThanksObama thing. But now instead of "going high" as they say, they just do the same thing, because originality and creativeness is not their strong suit.

1318174646085308418 2020-10-19 20:58:20 +0800 <swampdecrial> A vote for Biden is a vote of approval for corrupt elites. If Biden gets in everything will be suppressed and we'll return to a ISIS-like group controlling the middle east and the American economy grinding back to it's halt.

1316568968472203264 2020-10-15 10:37:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SexCounseling @kalron63 There is a c-word that I typically put after the word "vapid" to describe most women on the extreme progressive side of things...this moron is no exception. But since I'm replying to a lady, I'll refrain.
1316566054567542785 2020-10-15 10:26:22 +0800 <swampdecrial> @seanhannity If this were Trump, he'd have to answer the question 50 times by now.
1316565682562174978 2020-10-15 10:24:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> @icecube I know this may not mean you love Trump suddenly, but I hope it helps you realise that the man cares and wants to help. Vote for Trump's policies. Don't hate him for his rhetoric.
1316562984370671616 2020-10-15 10:14:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TheReal_Hurl Very controversial.
1316524079084646409 2020-10-15 07:39:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> I remember listening to Trump way back before 2012 and thinking he should run for President and I would gladly vote for him. His ideas (which are the same today as they were then) were widely applauded by all.    https://t.co/ajlWXWKiNW
1316509144095100929 2020-10-15 06:40:14 +0800 <swampdecrial> @editor_wp @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump That was like paying for gourmet dinner and getting a crap sandwich. What a bad trade.

Not recognizing them would destabilize relations and make pressure less impactful.
1316501053467103232 2020-10-15 06:08:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @thehill As I always say with these types of stories. Trump is President now. . Why wait? Please leave.
1316498193874640907 2020-10-15 05:56:43 +0800 <swampdecrial> @atrupar It is pretty telling that this President is upset at AG Barr not acting indicting criminals, while the demonrats praised Holder after gun running for Mexico.
1316497461054185485 2020-10-15 05:53:48 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SenSanders Well, the Senate has the duty to advise and consent to the nomination, while the House has the power of the purse. In theory, then, each chamber could be working for America at the same time, but we know what the odds of that are.
1316496839160590336 2020-10-15 05:51:20 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Ek7_PRN Oh yea, 100%
1316495790475546624 2020-10-15 05:47:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden I was going to correct you and let you know that President is a proper title, go ahead and capitalize it. However, then I realized your entire Tweet is incorrect, so that won't really help that much.
1316463236020080641 2020-10-15 03:37:48 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ABC @ABC2020 The questions will be provided up front and will be softballs that are sure to touch upon all of the virtues of the leftist party. They will be worded in such a way that a senile old fool can score points on the issues that they see he needs to makeup ground on in the polls.

1316397078717792263 2020-10-14 23:14:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> Women on the right like ACB mostly seem patient, calm, kind, self-assured. While women on the left are mostly so vapid, disruptive, and just overall shitty. Maybe the reason people on the left feel like they are victims is because everyone does actually find them disgusting.

Let's hand government money to people paid for by taxes on income that people aren't making due to the virus. What a shitshow.
1316141646019547137 2020-10-14 06:19:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden You are still saying this dumb shit over and over? This is more a referendum on early voting than it is on not fulfilling a Constitutional obligation.
1316141465962246144 2020-10-14 06:19:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> Remember when Trump turned a roast into a total destruction of his opponent, while the fat lefties behind him lost their minds to ever increasingly shiny foreheads?     https://t.co/IFdPZJ2MCv

1316056819006087168 2020-10-14 00:42:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @StacyHerndon10 #MAGA Trump wants us to be the country that ended slavery, unapologetically strives for greatness, doesn't cower in fear, or play the victim. The country that is constantly trying to pursue what it means to be free and prosperous.

Please stop playing politics and vote on ACB's merit, not out of anger for Trump. Kicking the can down the road is saying that the current congress, (for which you are a part of) can't  or won't do their job.

1315723724604219393 2020-10-13 02:39:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> In my town there are many places doing rapid (with symptoms) and lab testing (no symptoms) for the china plague, many don't even need an appointment, and a few have a pay scale if you are low income. The problem is angry democrats, not our system and not Trump.

1315691486135148544 2020-10-13 00:31:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> @samanthamarika1 @TheBeaSmith And since Biden has no advice on how to improve things "until we elect him" it seems like the trend will always continue.

1315689195722207233 2020-10-13 00:22:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> So I guess demonrats are just blindly opposed to anyone that holds a personal faith in Jesus Christ and is personally opposed to killing babies in the womb....Really shows you they are the enemy of good.

1314255672847073281 2020-10-09 01:25:44 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump I have to think that Biden's logic is that if we are hiding in our basement not working, then we don't have to pay as much in taxes. That's the only way his words add up. He's nuts!

1314196003579400194 2020-10-08 21:28:38 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RudyGiuliani You can't say you are going to cancel the Trump tax cuts, then say they aren't raising taxes on &gt; 400k. People making less than that (myself included) saw some tax relief from the bill. They are going to raise taxes and shut us down. We'll have no money at all.
1314194896132231169 2020-10-08 21:24:14 +0800 <swampdecrial> @s_waldenberg CNN instant poll of people that watched the debate on CNN. I'd say 38% of CNN watchers is a pretty good haul.

1314192188901818368 2020-10-08 21:13:29 +0800 <swampdecrial> @smokntoes They said they would cancel the Trump tax cuts. . So if those making less than 400k saw a benefit from the cuts and they cancel them. .. Seems like taxes would go up. Seems like they are lying.
1314190961711419396 2020-10-08 21:08:36 +0800 <swampdecrial> @smokntoes Not sure where 400k comes in? I don't make anywhere near that, yet my paycheck was around +$60/month after the tax cuts. It's not a huge amount, but I'll take what I can get from our thieving government. Biden will shut us down and raise our taxes, we'll have no money at all.

1314171217298042880 2020-10-08 19:50:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SchillyPNW @ScottPresler It really speaks volumes that a non-religious person such as Trump is such a better witness to the unborn than a self-professed Catholic. The Church would be in a better place if more people followed Trump's example rather than Biden's cafeteria brand of Catholicism.
1314169588586864641 2020-10-08 19:43:40 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ScottPresler @SavoJr If you are Catholic, you know that a reoccurring theme in the Church that you hear over and over is regarding the sanctity of human life. Joe Biden calls it a "right" to end human life while it's most vulnerable. Dems have always been sick and hiding behind their faith is horrid.

1314167288703188995 2020-10-08 19:34:32 +0800 <swampdecrial> Now I get it. Joe Biden is going to shut the economy down and leave us all inside our basement hiding. Since we won't be working, we wont have any income to tax, so he can claim he won't raise our taxes. What a nasty policy.
1314166910523707392 2020-10-08 19:33:02 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DFBHarvard I'm not really going to go into name calling or personal attacks on her. She is her own person. However, neither her or Biden are fit to be President and both have a reckless agenda that will raise taxes, although it doesn't matter, because none will be working.

1313461804119592960 2020-10-06 20:51:11 +0800 <swampdecrial> @politicalfarm @political_busy If it was normal, then they wouldn't "feel different" or have to "come out". Different implies it's not normal Joe.
1313459786839740416 2020-10-06 20:43:10 +0800 <swampdecrial> Total creep show.
1313459709719064577 2020-10-06 20:42:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> Creepy and low energy. Thank goodness for social distancing, he'd be doing some serious hair sniffing. Seriously dems, this is your guy? Do the world a favor and just don't vote for this tool.
1313456856891822080 2020-10-06 20:31:32 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jperky1956 I almost fell asleep watching this. He's so low energy. Can we start calling him Jeb?
1313456518818340865 2020-10-06 20:30:11 +0800 <swampdecrial> @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump The only death sentence this country could get is electing extreme progressive leftists demonrats to office. That will certainly be the end of it all. Vote Trump and be brave. Biden will shut this country down and have us all like him, hiding in our basements.
1313455823671250949 2020-10-06 20:27:25 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BrandonStraka I hope you are correct. Dems would have us hiding in our basements with diapers on our face. This is not American. We are free people that are not afraid to be strong and live our lives.
1313454803104788483 2020-10-06 20:23:22 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KamalaHarris We just aren't interested in hearing what the dems wish we would do. You don't represent us, the elections in 2016 and 2018 is what we are living under, those terms are still in progress.
1313452859862724611 2020-10-06 20:15:39 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Acosta What is your source? Your intestines?
1313452684196880384 2020-10-06 20:14:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Demonrats want us to hide in our basement with chin diapers on while supporting those that wish to terminate human life in the womb. Very disturbing how they can claim to value life while shitting on it.
1313440648595484679 2020-10-06 19:27:07 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Acosta I'm sure you wear your chin diaper 24x7?
1313228902148517889 2020-10-06 05:25:43 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TheJeffBradley @CelesteHerget Sad thing is. . this could be a doctored video and I would have no idea, because it seems possible he would say something like this.
1313228521435791362 2020-10-06 05:24:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> @MsKarma68 @realDonaldTrump There is a block button if you don't like it.

1313226249293180930 2020-10-06 05:15:11 +0800 <swampdecrial> The left is just mad that Trump never pretended he was a victim. He owned the situation and took it like a true American, head on, and without fear.

1313187368069926913 2020-10-06 02:40:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump The left wants to live in fear. Being a victim is really about the only thing they are good at.

1313185410282070018 2020-10-06 02:32:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Hey, if it makes the left flip their wigs again, I'm happy. Great job. Their tears sustain me and remind me I'm on the right side of history.

1313165231187726336 2020-10-06 01:12:43 +0800 <swampdecrial> @benstracy I feel safer when the media doesn't report at all! That's pretty crazy too.
1313164913410551809 2020-10-06 01:11:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @35Leosa And gender fluidity.

1312823493097127936 2020-10-05 02:34:46 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Acosta I heard from my friends dad that he heard from a guy he works with, whose dad said you were a feckless cuck.

Many of us probably had it and mistook it for allergies. At least now you will have the antibodies and you two will be the ultimate @POTUS and @FLOTUS immune from the china plague.
1312045585290141697 2020-10-02 23:03:38 +0800 <swampdecrial> @zx101z @HyltonRobin I heard that on their last night in the White House Michael helped Barry pack his shit.

1312044671930175489 2020-10-02 23:00:01 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Classy move with this tweet, thank you.    Still not voting for you, but it does show you are at least human.

1311999704004263939 2020-10-02 20:01:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> Good thing Biden hasn't been diagnosed yet. Think of all the women and children he sniffs. Could be a bad outbreak.
1311998945644752899 2020-10-02 19:58:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Do you have a photo of that billboard? Or were cameras invented yet? It was so long ago. You sure seemed to loved the families of incoming congressmen and women, and their kids, maybe a little too much.
1311998416428445697 2020-10-02 19:56:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DeAnna4Congress You are what feminism should be. Strong women doing amazing things and working hard.

1311988979059888130 2020-10-02 19:18:42 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BorisEP @NewsBlurt I would like to ask the demonrats of their atheism and hatred for Judeo-Christian values interferes with their ability to be human beings.
1311988549747699716 2020-10-02 19:17:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JohnCornyn @eavesdropann You could. . I dunno. . Open the country.
1311988426200223744 2020-10-02 19:16:31 +0800 <swampdecrial> @atrupar You mean the press wants her to say it their way and she refused to be controlled by them?
1311988053716676608 2020-10-02 19:15:02 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CNNPolitics Ignoring the fact that she is criticizing the media for not covering her trying to help the kid back to their mother. What the actual fuck is wrong with the media? You missed the key component of her conversation to point out the things that were irrelevant.
1311984814392737798 2020-10-02 19:02:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> Trump is about to take the next 2 weeks to show sleepy Joe how to run a basement campaign.
1311983962529693696 2020-10-02 18:58:46 +0800 <swampdecrial> Welcome to a new day of demonrats showing you how compassionate and loving and anti-hate they are.

1311739004811911169 2020-10-02 02:45:24 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Trump! It's been HOURS since you last condemned white supremacy. Don't you think it's about time you do it again? PLEASE hurry the media not hearing you say it is like not being able to breathe!

1311737250267439104 2020-10-02 02:38:26 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ChuckCallesto @Lrod49 Nope. . He should pull out a bullhorn.

1311735859117527041 2020-10-02 02:32:54 +0800 <swampdecrial> @copdoc1 Yes. . He should have used the words democrat, pay for play expert Hunter BIDEN. Jam all those words into the same sentence.
1311734917668241409 2020-10-02 02:29:09 +0800 <swampdecrial> Not to mention demonrats want to shut this country down and expects us to all cower in our basement with masks on like Biden. Terrible. People need to work and make a living, otherwise surviving the virus is just as bad as dying from it.
1311734512754274304 2020-10-02 02:27:33 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump The only thing that needs to change is Biden's diaper.

1311722939063185409 2020-10-02 01:41:33 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Ilhan How? With our tax money? Maybe just stop taking taxes from us and you wouldn't have to use the tax money to bail us out.

Possibly have blue hair and are mad that crochety old Bernie didn't get the nomination.  I guess Biden would do well in that segment.
1311714795737890816 2020-10-02 01:09:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> Dear government. If you wouldn't have shut us down, you wouldn't need to take the tax money we don't have to bail out ourselves. Thanks.

That right there should make him unelectable. This nation isn't scared and neither should our President be! People need to be able to go to work and live.
1311649137826369536 2020-10-01 20:48:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump For some reason the left isn't worried about possible fraud, this is because they know it helps them.
1311647695921180673 2020-10-01 20:42:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> Very sorry about this. This illustrates that the human inside the womb is a life and has meaning and real value to the world outside the mother. God bless the little one that gets an express pass through this world and into the arms of heaven. Prayers for the loss and suffering.

1311473148672565249 2020-10-01 09:08:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AnnCoulter @RichardAlengi Trump has condemned them multiple times. The shitforbrains left listen to their masters instead of what Trump says on camera.

1311379933856399365 2020-10-01 02:58:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Why do you want to lie? He has done this already, but it's never good enough for the race baiting left. Your party is garbage and deserves to lose every election in November for just baseless fuckery. Back to your hidey hole.   https://t.co/UaTsjXaR6m
1311378951646912513 2020-10-01 02:54:40 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Cernovich There is probably some truth to this, but I think a lot of people just don't trust the process will be fair. So they avoid it. People are over saturated with propaganda and are starting to just ignore a lot of it.
1311318792346259461 2020-09-30 22:55:37 +0800 <swampdecrial> ICYMI. Here is Trump asking all Americans to condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy in the wake of violence just over a year ago.

Biden will shut us down (ruining lives), end the filibuster, and pack the courts. Wallace was a joke of a moderator asked disingenuous and misleading questions. A total shitshow.
1311315606864625670 2020-09-30 22:42:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @mspdcali @RonCentrelloJr FoxNews hasn't even been on my radar for years now and for at least the last 18 months I have felt very sorry and bad for anyone that still consumes content from that propaganda machine.
1311314409587908616 2020-09-30 22:38:12 +0800 <swampdecrial> Biden will close our country down and people will loose their livelihoods, Biden couldn't name a law enforcement group supporting him. Refused to say no to ending the filibuster and packing the court. What a joke.

The NYT was controlling the narrative, even though their own story clearly listed the millions he did pay.
1311311985749917696 2020-09-30 22:28:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Say you don't want to pack the court Joe, say you won't end the filibuster. OOOP SEGMENT OVER. Right Wallace?
1311311618471591941 2020-09-30 22:27:07 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you are a climate change denier and hate the environment, why are you so evil? Mr. Vice President, you have a great plan for the environment, lets hear about it. Really Wallace?
1311310416992239624 2020-09-30 22:22:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Imagine setting the bar so low for your candidate that showing up and remaining upright and stumbling through sentences is considered a win? The left is unhinged. #TDSISREAL
1311289965096194050 2020-09-30 21:01:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> @webofslime Not to mention most of those interruptions were when Trump was punching Biden into the ropes.

1311281731362795520 2020-09-30 20:28:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> All I needed to hear last night was that Trump wants to open our country and Biden wants to shut us down and have us hiding in our basement with masks on. I need to work or I go bankrupt. Fucking tool can take his blank staring senile ass to a retirement home.

1311030255537319944 2020-09-30 03:49:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KennedyNation @VoTe_TrUmp_MaGa Considering that most people have it taken from their check, rather than paying taxes freely, it does sound more like theft than it does paying.

1311027863282384896 2020-09-30 03:39:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Jillibean557 After the suspected fraud in 2016 for Hillary and being in control of congress and the White House, they could have taken meaningful steps to require ID to vote for Federal officials, and other things, but they didn't. Why?
1311025698363052032 2020-09-30 03:30:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TulsiGabbard @Lrod49 You have to admit that giving it that name worries people. Just like the ACA, Patriot, etc... the name has the exact opposite meaning of the actuality. I hope this isn't the same type of thing. Also, there is no way congress will vote to limit it's power, corruption. #TermLimits

1311022526294884353 2020-09-30 03:18:22 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ProudSocialist @GDMiller4043 So in other words, you agree with the left about pretty much everything, except for them being completely insane?
1311020752553086986 2020-09-30 03:11:19 +0800 <swampdecrial> Hey lefties, that lack of enthusiasm for Joe that you also felt for Hillary isn't anything to do with a poor choice of candidates. What you are feeling is a lack of enthusiasm for your political, social, and ethical world view. You know you are failing and you are getting sleepy.

1311018934712311810 2020-09-30 03:04:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @AOC Where did you get $750? You failed to read the full article, which was headlined and prefaced with that, but in actuality he paid millions in taxes. The nerve of people that only believe what they want to believe.

1311017873649938434 2020-09-30 02:59:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> @PattyMurray Trump has done more to help in 4 years than the crochety old liars in Congress have done in decades. Of course you want to stop Trump, he's making you all look like the fools you are.
1311017020843012106 2020-09-30 02:56:29 +0800 <swampdecrial> @megynkelly It's not getting the questions in advance, or the earpiece, or the drugs that are concerning. It's the giant left hand up his ass controlling this puppet that is a bit off putting.

Most people watching have already made up their minds and are rooting for their guy to get more pop shots than the other.

It was a democrat only vote, late at night to ram it down the throats of Americans. We haven't forgotten this, the dems will not get our vote.
1310975373560238081 2020-09-30 00:11:00 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Trump is doing what he needs to do, rest assured. You on the other hand should hydrate.

1310585631568023554 2020-09-28 22:22:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump The left only wants chaos so they can blame you.
1310585271679954946 2020-09-28 22:20:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> So, according to the left Trump is broke, yet didn't pay enough taxes, yet lost a lot of money, but over reported how much he made. You'd think they'd get the story straight first.
1310584832125272064 2020-09-28 22:19:08 +0800 <swampdecrial> @jaketapper So. . you're mad that he has a better tax team than you, or what? I'm confused. If the law allows you to do this, what is the issue with taking advantage? Should rich people pay tax amounts based on making lefties feel better?
1310575371671285760 2020-09-28 21:41:32 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RicciGeri I don't know what the solution is, but I'm sure the government can't or won't fix it. I think it's just time for everyone to collectively turn it off.
1310570276476923904 2020-09-28 21:21:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden I get it. . Horse...Saddle.  You are so smart and funny. You should run for President.

1310568362079125504 2020-09-28 21:13:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Why do you lie right now? He initiated travel bans while your party criticized him. Everything he does all you do is bitch and moan. Grow the fuck up. #Trump2020
1310566753433538561 2020-09-28 21:07:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @H2oVolk They sit on their pile of money and complain about rich people. That's one of their favorite things to do.
1310563134638350338 2020-09-28 20:52:55 +0800 <swampdecrial> @BarbMcQuade 5 justices appointed by the duly elected President of the Untied States. The popular vote means the same as a participation trophy in our system and thank God for that.
1310562647620943872 2020-09-28 20:50:58 +0800 <swampdecrial> I received my neighbors mail in ballot in the mail. I will take it to him myself (doing a better job than the USPS), but the dems should know that he has a Biden sign in his yard and I could have just as easily made sure he didn't get his ballot.
1310560402711998464 2020-09-28 20:42:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> @mtnbikerdenis1 @bfraser747 @realDonaldTrump You mean to tell me if he releases them the left will let it be? hahaha.  The only people that care are his haters, why appease them?
1310557541131268101 2020-09-28 20:30:41 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ewarren Yet all those years in the senate and you've done nothing?  Back to your money filled hole.

1310374021540839424 2020-09-28 08:21:26 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Patriot5611 I'd call the police and have them cited for trespassing.
1310373392516812800 2020-09-28 08:18:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TNSociallyMissy Yes and I'll escort anyone that feels intimidated.

1309923358562189313 2020-09-27 02:30:40 +0800 <swampdecrial> What is stopping people from filling out their mailing ballot and then going on election day and filling out one in person? Serious question, I'm trying to learn why the left thinks this is good idea.
1309581838617325573 2020-09-26 03:53:35 +0800 <swampdecrial> @LindaofNM1 @scottcarpy1 Why wait? Just leave now?
1309581352140972037 2020-09-26 03:51:39 +0800 <swampdecrial> @nytimes Every woman I associate with are Trump supporters, because they think Trump is working for the country and Joe is a senile old crook!
1309580738359185415 2020-09-26 03:49:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden Not thanks, insurance sucks. Why do we use healthcare and insurance interchangeably? It's almost like insurance is in the pockets of corrupt politicians? No?
1309527284462825472 2020-09-26 00:16:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> It's impossible for the left to believe that Trump is resisting mass mail in ballots because he wants a fair election. Their #tds will not let them see it. They think this is for him? We want a fair election, not one riddled in scandal and fraud!
1309509425007398912 2020-09-25 23:05:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> If you want to know what happens when dems get control look no further than the autonomous zones that were a total disaster. Their vision fails every time. Freedom and individual responsibility is always the better answer.

1309479276752887808 2020-09-25 21:06:03 +0800 <swampdecrial> @LibertyCliff This is where law enforcement needs the most reform. This "Not in my town" attitude that law enforcement takes on this kind of thing instead of stopping actual harmful crimes is just nonsense and they should be ashamed. This is not protecting and serving, it's just being asses.
1309476212851515394 2020-09-25 20:53:52 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden You can do that without being President.

1309469720056340481 2020-09-25 20:28:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Brian_Riedl @Cernovich I see that CNN is still using it's tactic of finding anyone with a recognizable name that hates Trump and putting them on air to bitch and moan. Nothing but showboating garbage.
1309462478921834496 2020-09-25 19:59:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> Whoopsie. Hey look everyone can be surprised the deep state swamp is alive and well.
1309456836827979776 2020-09-25 19:36:53 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump Fair voting is good for all parties, it's hard to imagine why the dems are opposed to voter ID and stopping mass mail in ballots. Other than they think it gives them an advantage. I'm not sure why the don't think their voters are smart enough to have IDs and vote correctly.
1309454088107630592 2020-09-25 19:25:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> @ohhnodavid A good move would be for you to stop threatening people using this platform. A second move would be for you to take a deep look inside and find what is broken and get some therapy.
1309453699765489664 2020-09-25 19:24:25 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The dems make the mistake of thinking we care about polls, or their fake social pandering. They bitch and moan while  your supporters are actually trying to make things great every single day.

So why should my party that is currently in charge just lay down here? I wouldn't expect your party to do this.

I now expect them to do their job and confirm an originalist to the court. It's what people expect from their party.

1308105035755200518 2020-09-22 02:05:18 +0800 <swampdecrial> Lets it go dems. You aren't winning in November, there is no sense of waiting to confirm a SCOTUS.

1308100764208955403 2020-09-22 01:48:20 +0800 <swampdecrial> Democrats are funny if they think we are going to wait until their party is in charge to do this thing.

Dems would confirm in a heartbeat if the roles were reversed. There isn't a legal precedent, just an example of what the party in charge can do.

However, when someone you didn't know or care much for while they were alive passes, it's easy to move on and I have. Let's get the nomination and confirmation done. People grieve, democracy doesn't.

1307136321610297346 2020-09-19 09:55:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TNSociallyMissy Yeah, but entirely man made? Nah.

Even if the post office was perfect during the whole process, the guy at the end put it in the wrong box. I'll vote in person and so should 95% of everyone.

1305952732642189312 2020-09-16 03:32:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Or we could use responsible forestry techniques to remove dead trees and ground cover from our forests. Putting the wood to actual good use. Or we can keep pretending that ignoring it and letting it burn is somehow better for the environment. #NOTFitForOffice
1305835249599995904 2020-09-15 19:45:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> @realDonaldTrump @vegasrenae I think a lot of people are leaving California for Arizona. It's getting to crazy there. Hopefully if they move they remember the leftists that ruined that place when they vote and not import the crazy to other places.

At some point there is a job to do and the haters are gonna hate. This has been every President ever. The job is political and divisive. It's called reality. Embrace it.
1304409706962792448 2020-09-11 21:21:23 +0800 <swampdecrial> The left: Let's create science (climate change) then proclaim ourselves experts of it, teach others to think the same, then call them educated. Then insult anyone that calls us out.
1304409344478531585 2020-09-11 21:19:57 +0800 <swampdecrial> The left: Let's blame the fires on climate change, then blame climate change on Trump. Perfect plan from the educated left.

Unity is a choice of the people, not the job of the government. Presidents have always had segments of people that didn't like them or their policies. That's not disunity, that's just anger.

Deserving of a voice? It's the most basic bitch thing ever to insult people without degrees. There are many hard working people, some minorities in this space.

It's not that I don't understand your supreme hive minds, it's that I really don't give a shit. The President isn't ruining this country the media charged virtue signalers are.
1304388538566311937 2020-09-11 19:57:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> It's somewhat comical that the left's solution for our support of Trump is to just get more pissed off and embarrassing. The progressives must really convinced we care.

1304382344351174659 2020-09-11 19:32:39 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RealJamesWoods The only thing man made about many of these wildfires is a total lack of forestry maintenance programs. Politicians in their effort to "save the trees" have created a tinderbox that nature will take care of instead. Never used to be a problem until government stepped in to help.
1304380876747345921 2020-09-11 19:26:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> Complaining about football is about the worst way ever for the right to virtue signal. We are better than the left's cancel culture.

1303862309509632001 2020-09-10 09:06:13 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RepAdamSchiff So you must be in favor of voter ID, in person or absentee ballots only, right? To prevent all possible fraud? Or do you only care when it affects your party negatively?
1303861769362907137 2020-09-10 09:04:05 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TomCottonAR Yeah. Evil progressives exploited a pregnant girl to push their agenda through the courts. A girl that ended up not having the abortion and becoming adamantly pro life. The entire premise is a farce.

1303854587472941056 2020-09-10 08:35:32 +0800 <swampdecrial> Wearing a mask outside and away from everyone on purpose is the latest way to virtue signal. I know this, because if I did it, I would feel like a moron.

The left however, is all of that, combined with just being holistically shitty people that never learned when to shut the  f-up.

1301194383669243905 2020-09-03 00:24:50 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RichardVerMeul1 Looks like a great time to elect @DeAnna4Congress to replace crazy ass Nancy.

For some reason they follow people they don't like and then allow themselves to get triggered by them. It's like some modern version of self-harm I think.
1301187444998582275 2020-09-02 23:57:16 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Lagniap6827 @DMLSolstice @TheRealRileyDog @JoeBiden You mean, Ferguson wasn't during that 8 years? How about Baltimore? Do you blindly believe everything sleepy Joe tells you?
1301186868609011714 2020-09-02 23:54:59 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DawnWil43359455 @5solas_1689 @TheRealRileyDog Murder is always illegal, but killing someone isn't always murder.
1301186516165824517 2020-09-02 23:53:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> @limpblazer @TheRealRileyDog @DutraOne Some places this is legal.
1301186208681414658 2020-09-02 23:52:21 +0800 <swampdecrial> Meteorologists can't protect us from the weather, government can't protect us from a virus. It's a shame that we put so much faith in government to think they would save us from nature. Funny to see Slow Sleepy Joe Biden claiming he can, but only after he's elected. #hardno
1301139633624043532 2020-09-02 20:47:17 +0800 <swampdecrial> @sonyasteele @marklevinshow Could say the same about any politician.
1301138825994031104 2020-09-02 20:44:04 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Katieraydee @mouse458 Not sure what lead up to him being around nasty aggressive shitbricks, but it's best to avoid these animals at all costs.
1300924609580204033 2020-09-02 06:32:51 +0800 <swampdecrial> @IngrahamAngle @TobiMac90 I actually think it's the no fans thing. I would probably watch (even though I hate the virtue signaling), but no fans makes the energy weird. People are sick of COVID and aren't going to watch a fanless game. #OpenAmerica
1300921904623124482 2020-09-02 06:22:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @SharonSharalike @ColEffort @CNNNewsource  https://t.co/k2UYsHEvvZ here he is going up the steps to the plane, then waving.  I know it's CNN @fakenews always so honest, so it would be weird if they were making something from nothing. /s  He probably does more stairs than lefties coming up from the basement.
1300921185224609797 2020-09-02 06:19:15 +0800 <swampdecrial> @CNNNewsource #fakenews Here he is today, taking a flight of stairs up to his plane, at one point taking a few steps quicker, then getting to the top and waving with his right hand. https://t.co/k2UYsHEvvZ
1300919890237435912 2020-09-02 06:14:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @atomictyler @MillikenTony @ColEffort @CNNNewsource Video today where he does his typical talking with his hands. Both average size hands.  https://t.co/IvvvPDbYEv
1300919065930870790 2020-09-02 06:10:49 +0800 <swampdecrial> @TheBeaSmith DNC bump likely. Curious to see what Sept will look like for him.
1300883399280861184 2020-09-02 03:49:06 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RideTheRedWave @Acosta I'm sure she's heard of Soros and Soros wouldn't be guy doing the deal anyways, it would be 2 or 3 people separated from him to keep him disconnected. The deep state has an understanding of what needs to be done and money just shows up into an account. It's like magic.
1300770188535758848 2020-09-01 20:19:14 +0800 <swampdecrial> @DeAnna4Congress Greta doesn't like hairy legs.
1300681911023665154 2020-09-01 14:28:27 +0800 <swampdecrial> @reulDonaIdTrump Can we add a few things to the defund list? TSA? DOE? IRS? EPA?
1300679676281716736 2020-09-01 14:19:34 +0800 <swampdecrial> @RichardGrenell I saw Trump endorsed @kimKBaltimore I guess only certain black women fit the narrative of the divisive demonrats.
1300678208363393024 2020-09-01 14:13:44 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Solmemes1 Probably happy that it's over.
1300677755101679616 2020-09-01 14:11:56 +0800 <swampdecrial> @Lrihendry Yeah. That was the first thing I thought too. playing god with people's lives to get elected...sicko.
