1341382492356489216 2020-12-22 21:58:02 +0800 <TPCLJ> Here's a little tip @JennaEllisEsq: DO YOUR LEGAL RESEARCH! The very situation in which the Insurrection Act came into being was to END A COUP like the very one in play.   I'll give you another tip, in your legal research software, use key word:  Thomas Jefferson.

The judiciary is corrupt to no-end that the only way to curb the injustice was via a pardon of innocence.

You nailed  @McAdooGordon--the filing to terminate the case should never have been done in the manner of a motion. IMHO, DOJ presentation at En Banc is intentionally creating unnecessary obstacles. Love your idea: Suggestion of pardon.

1330004348861026313 2020-11-21 12:25:21 +0800 <TPCLJ> @JoycetheVoice4 The timing of circuit reassignment of SCOTUS justices and its new configuration done by Chief Justice Roberts specific to the crucial swing states raise red flags. It is common knowledge that Roberts is compromised. Therefore, reassignment causes concern of election sabotage.

1327256407197048832 2020-11-13 22:26:01 +0800 <TPCLJ> @HappyTrucker6 @realDonaldTrump Indeed it is.
1327255683838996481 2020-11-13 22:23:08 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano Again, you fail to negate another legal premise. Looks like when you were a prosecutor, your cases got  thrown out the door full throttle. Never had a case where only partial evidence was suppressed and continued on to trial???
1327253640185344001 2020-11-13 22:15:01 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano Evidently, Mark, you don't know the distinction between suppressed evidence and the dismissal of an entire case.
1327249857397084163 2020-11-13 21:59:59 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano For the record: you misstated my analogy. I am in no way stating that legal votes be thrown out. I simply have chosen not to further explain the analysis given your flailing rantings.

1327247802984960003 2020-11-13 21:51:49 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano I suggest your ranting personal attacks are sufficient for people to know who the real kook is.
1327247460675301377 2020-11-13 21:50:28 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano I'll let the "jury" decide what value to put on your retorts. I choose not waste my time on people who only rely on making broad-sweeping conclusions and no understanding of true analysis.
1327245627399483392 2020-11-13 21:43:11 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano Your truth: no thank you.
1327245426119077890 2020-11-13 21:42:23 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano Other than making broad-sweeping personal attacks, you haven't stated why the doctrine of taint has no parralel. There is plenty of case law where civil cases have utilized doctrines related to criminal procedure. I can see you're only interested in smear tactics.
1327244522829602816 2020-11-13 21:38:47 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano Mark, I haven't made 1 personal attack against your asserted premises. The fact that you resort to such tactics speaks volumes.
1327244180687622144 2020-11-13 21:37:26 +0800 <TPCLJ> @TheMarkPantano If you don't understand the parallel of voter fraud to the doctrine of taint. . .I'm kerflemt.

1326936173663686656 2020-11-13 01:13:31 +0800 <TPCLJ> @ThyConsigliori @pikecoinjustice The corollary to the above is that one can "love thy enemy" in the context of Mattew 5 and still not give thy enemy "respect".
1326932497213616129 2020-11-13 00:58:55 +0800 <TPCLJ> @Chicago1Ray @VictorianaCara @FoxNews Long before that!
1326928624084283395 2020-11-13 00:43:31 +0800 <TPCLJ> @ThyConsigliori @pikecoinjustice I submit that If one does not give respect, it is not axiomatic that you then give disrespect. Indifference can kill an enemy.
1326927321752809473 2020-11-13 00:38:21 +0800 <TPCLJ> @ThyConsigliori @pikecoinjustice I agree that there are enemies who command respect-- my perspective: but not all enemies command respect.

Any scintilla of remnants were tossed in the latest burning down of our cities. I surmise that would constitute a "post-Constitutional nation".
1323976878252765194 2020-11-04 21:14:20 +0800 <TPCLJ> @ThyConsigliori @dinodadino @shestokas P.S. the AG has the legal power to prosecute civil law suit on behalf of the American citizenry for unconstitutional lock downs. .but, as can be seen, DOJ has no intention of acting in any capacity FOR We The People. Its evident sole purpose: to facilitate Govt criminal thuggery.

The record shows beyond the pale violation of federal judicial canon of ethics in Sullivan's repugnant display of arrogance and hostility toward Sidney Powell.

1311509812656705536 2020-10-01 11:34:40 +0800 <TPCLJ> @McAdooGordon Let's not forget, Judge Emmet Sullivan has reigned as Chair of the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission since 2013.  The exclusive club amongst attorneys/judges called: American Inns of Court adds good measure.
1311508569368473600 2020-10-01 11:29:44 +0800 <TPCLJ> @McAdooGordon The record shows Judge Sullivan has stepped off the cliff. Over-the-top judicial thuggery. Not a scintilla of evidence to even think this judge has any rational thought process. No judicial oversight in existence. Hence perception of invincibility given En Banc decision.

1311410348155699202 2020-10-01 04:59:26 +0800 <TPCLJ> UPDATE: it seems @KO_Reporter of MA @LawyersWeekly has removed the underlying tweet. Proof positive of his admssion of screwing the facts up.

The sham BD-2020-0013 matter before Justice Gaziano is NOT an appeal. My license has NOT been suspended--the BBO FILED it. NOT ME.

My point was to take it from the premise that the motion to dismiss had in fact been decided and to attack it from that approach, thereby nixing the other issues from the get-go.

Which is different than asking the court to direct a judge to make a specific ruling as if the judge didn't make a decision.

1301028395623550977 2020-09-02 13:25:16 +0800 <TPCLJ> @ThyConsigliori @RADcreate @GenFlynn Indeed the fish rots from the head down.

The first mandamus did not specify relief from the order--that is exactly what the majority sunk their teeth into--the framing of relief sought.

The key is in the 2nd paragraph--making a contempt inquiry BEFORE any hearing even held.   Shows predetermined finding.
