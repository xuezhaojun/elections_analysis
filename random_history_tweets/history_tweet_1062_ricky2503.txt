He opted for brexit on his doorstep out of popularity not out of principle having written 2 speeches one for each. He never thought they would win. How can he sell out the fishermen now?

I wonder if they did it on purpose to make a political point? He is a councillor not a counsellor just to let you know.

1319989998863659009 2020-10-24 21:11:54 +0800 <ricky2503> @montie Tim Montgomerie, Welsh Government giving Â£100 per head to support Welsh business, compared to Â£7.86 per head to English businesses. Why don't you concentrate on the lack of support to your own economy?
1319578826859491333 2020-10-23 17:58:03 +0800 <ricky2503> @thestifflertv @kirstiealley He just isn't Trump. What should worry the republicans is how competitive the Dems are in places like South Carolina. Montana, Alaska and how well their doing in Georgia, Iowa and Arizona.
1319578371748171776 2020-10-23 17:56:15 +0800 <ricky2503> @thestifflertv @kirstiealley Yeah watched a bit this morning. Trump tried his best but he let his guard slip later and he is such an idiot. Biden didn't drop the ming vase and was comforting &amp; dependable and basically a safe pair of hands.
1319577840925495297 2020-10-23 17:54:08 +0800 <ricky2503> @thestifflertv Thanks for all your work Steff

1319366536394657793 2020-10-23 03:54:29 +0800 <ricky2503> @TonyCRUTCHER4 Thanks Tony my understanding is that formal gatherings with bands, music flags etc are not allowed as they will attract crowds of onlookers which is illegal.

1310298491588087810 2020-09-28 03:21:19 +0800 <ricky2503> @labour_history Doesn't this just remind you of something similar that's just happened with slightly different ending!
1309812913918676992 2020-09-26 19:11:48 +0800 <ricky2503> Just makes me thinks regardless of his or my politics for all he did/or represented for the people of Bolsover to do what they did to him, is shameful. Still this will make you smile.
