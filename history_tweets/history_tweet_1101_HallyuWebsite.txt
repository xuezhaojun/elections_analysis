Local poll officials hold back until it’s clear their favored candidate is losing, then they come up with additional ballots last minute.   No observers... obliviousness or indifference to the arena’s CCTV.

If a 78-year-old cracks those particular bones, he will be in horrible pain and should not be allowed to walk at all.  Ask what pain meds the doctors prescribed.  Morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl patch?
