1344011643366346752 2020-12-30 04:05:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Slowly, I‚Äôm learning to experience less shame about resting and taking time off. This is something I have really had to work on since becoming self-employed, but I‚Äôm slowly getting better at it. I think that is 1 of the best improvements I have made this year.  https://t.co/D4LTT3BRAz
1343943118698270720 2020-12-29 23:33:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm used to Canadian winters where it‚Äôs dark for far too long &amp; really cold, and that can lead to high seasonal depression rates. But I know it affects people in similar rates in other parts of the world too.  For anyone who feels like I‚Äôm calling them out by name:  https://t.co/NnbHefOKni
1343943108128595968 2020-12-29 23:33:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is just a reminder to be civil and kind to each other right now. Especially  #DisabilityTwitter, #dyspraxia community, and #neurodiversesquad. This has been a tough year for so many people, and with the end of this year in sight it‚Äôs even more important.
1343941271652589570 2020-12-29 23:25:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Hope you‚Äôre okay.  https://t.co/8myrp77jmJ
1343670765800091648 2020-12-29 05:30:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This however, rarely happens. Then policy choices happen based on ignorance &amp; the very real problems out there with diversity don‚Äôt get solved.  https://t.co/G1NCSWKAOw
1343670757109477376 2020-12-29 05:30:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I will never take someone‚Äôs interest in being ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù and ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù seriously unless they do some really deep soul searching about why they want to be more diverse &amp; ask people who fall under the broad category of diverse how best to include them.
1343600166859845635 2020-12-29 00:50:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I realize that some #dyspraxics drive, but I live in a big city so my motivation to learn how to drive is also low. I have public transportation, pedestrian-friendly neighbourhoods &amp; a husband that is willing to rent a car &amp; drive in areas where a car is the only option.
1343600165698105345 2020-12-29 00:50:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Because of my #dyspraxia, my spatial processing abilities are so bad, that I'm terrified of getting behind the wheel. Clearly, the author of this @TheMightySite  article &amp; I both don't drive for the same reasons.  https://t.co/PsvPsYJdKT
1343586976067420161 2020-12-28 23:57:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @SGT_OW Yes, all the time. Keeps me sane and helps people figure out when I‚Äôm comfortable with them laughing at some of the things that it makes me do. Besides having a neurodiverse brain does have its moments that are funny on their own.
1343290902190686210 2020-12-28 04:21:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Yes, I think this is true....for the most part. I mean...I have encountered some exceptions to that but well...they‚Äôre a minority and what can you do about that really ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1343229947402444807 2020-12-28 00:19:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Nope, this still doesn‚Äôt change my mind about what a painfully stupid idea this movie is, and the justified anger of the #ActuallyAutistic community that I have been hearing about.  https://t.co/uxksDbLYSs
1342901295020183570 2020-12-27 02:33:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Seems like an appropriate question, since Christmas just happened, and was something @Jandelliott and I talked about today: what bad advice  do you often get from your family about your #Disability and how do you hope to correct it?  https://t.co/eYriSzoVRr
1342861587183509505 2020-12-26 23:55:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This üíØ%. And while you‚Äôre at it, avoid the ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù label. I have too many bad memories of being in special education + the stigma that came with that.
1342543248850636811 2020-12-26 02:50:28 +0800 <rosiemay_r> All this seems totally nuts now, but I feel like it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù storytelling for generations who weren‚Äôt alive in COVID times.  https://t.co/oO6T47DETC
1342543221235331074 2020-12-26 02:50:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Doing my annual round of holiday calls was a real reminder of what a truly weird time to be alive it truly is. My brother‚Äôs in quarantine, my parents are spending the first Christmas of their entire relationship alone, and my grandma thought I was my mom.
1342195393380175873 2020-12-25 03:48:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> How to care for your #neurodiverse person in your life right now. 1) do not sensory overload, 2) when you must sensory overload, allow quiet time in between each socially distanced store or family visit, 3) be kind, be patient. The holidays are always a lot to process.  https://t.co/llCh3Qpjkn
1342192227427168257 2020-12-25 03:35:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DrAlanRobinson I‚Äôm not autistic but I‚Äôm neurodiverse so I know this frustration. Big family dinners are always a bit tough for me in that way, and I always get more anxious when my family fusses over me too much. That‚Äôs the one benefit of COVID this year. At least it‚Äôs keeping things small.
1342156028788547588 2020-12-25 01:11:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Now that‚Äôs how you do #COVID19 era Christmas messages just right @allontheboard üôÇüëç.
1342142707662254081 2020-12-25 00:18:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This Christmas I discovered what my biggest #neurodiversity sensory nightmare is. It involves sterile lights, sensory noise overload, &amp; people stressed out about the lockdown. But at this point, if I can survive the sensory intensity of Marrakech, Morocco, I can handle anything.  https://t.co/fna2JUe3tp
1341854561825386496 2020-12-24 05:13:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ballinskelligs2 @DyspraxicHelp4U @Dyspraxialife @krystalbellax Merry Christmas @ballinskelligs2. Yeah hope to have more news &amp; information on that book soon. I‚Äôll keep you posted though üôÇ
1341808698629492736 2020-12-24 02:11:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Thinking of the entire #dyspraxia community today, especially the English (and Irish) advocates I have had the pleasure of getting to know this year: @deviantdyspraxic @dyspraxichelp4u @sgpt_nobarrierstraining @dyspraxialife @krystalbellax @dyspraxia_me and anyone else I mig‚Ä¶  https://t.co/WSEQ9UlCeV
1341794375421095937 2020-12-24 01:14:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ADHDelaide Yep, too familiar. Then, I mask my neurodiversity and people wonder why I‚Äôm struggling with certain things. Sometimes you just can‚Äôt win with these things.
1341782636293926913 2020-12-24 00:28:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It has been 25 years since #disability discrimination was outlawed. According to ‚Å¶@guardian‚Å© equality and inclusion for people with disabilities is now moving in reverse. It‚Äôs a stark view but they‚Äôre not wrong.  https://t.co/SPoLaabsPT
1341532353680818176 2020-12-23 07:53:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @TBreakdownMag I have known so many people who have struggled with their mental health. So I want people to know that if this sounds like common sense, it isn‚Äôt for everybody. This needs to be said, on repeat.
1341527474195357697 2020-12-23 07:34:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Next time you have a conversation about wanting to hire a ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù or ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù workforce, here‚Äôs what you need to know. Stuff like this happens a lot &amp; if you‚Äôre serious about diversity it needs to be avoided.  https://t.co/UUDiLZiimp
1341459170596442116 2020-12-23 03:02:44 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm #dyspraxic, and this is how I learned to tie shoelaces. So I can confirm this method can work.
1341419612227981312 2020-12-23 00:25:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Very quickly it went from my city being in lockdown to my province being in lockdown. COVID numbers aren‚Äôt great. People are taken it seriously though. Not being able to visit certain people is a worthwhile price to pay. Hope everyone‚Äôs non-traditional holidays are going well.  https://t.co/r2u5VQTPmk
1341171120846860291 2020-12-22 07:58:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @MegLaTorre @iWriterly @LyraParish @RedPenKaitlyn Looking forward to the replay. In a crappy wi-fi zone for Christmas. Publishable has been such a helpful resource for me. At the stage of writing a book where I‚Äôm searching for an agent or publisher &amp; I don‚Äôt know a lot of published writers.
1341169784080232450 2020-12-22 07:52:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax I hear her ‚Äúresearch‚Äù was talking to autism speaks not actually autistic people. The autism speaks Wikipedia page is layers of really sketchy behaviour. Like apparently they believe in a cure coming ‚Äúsoon‚Äù for starters but the rest of the story is a lot worse than that.
1341106166752038921 2020-12-22 03:40:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A few words on masking, learned neurodiverse behaviour that is meant to help us survive neurotypical dominated environments. My own personal perspective on this.  https://t.co/YDFVbhUI1k
1341082735541170179 2020-12-22 02:06:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A Christmas album recommendation for my Twitter followers with more alternative rock/ pop tastes: @andrewbird‚Äôs hark. Listening to it in the car right now and it is fantastic. It was recorded during COVID and with the tone of COVID in mind.
1340810682950963201 2020-12-21 08:05:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Listening to @sheandhim‚Äôs Christmas party album, and I‚Äôm loving it. Nice to hear an album from a time when the words ‚ÄúChristmas‚Äù and ‚Äúparty‚Äù weren‚Äôt reckless, stupid, and dangerous. Is this what missing the before times feels like?  https://t.co/VZ9YqoU2Ox
1340732672855912449 2020-12-21 02:55:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #Neurodiversity acceptance is #stimming on a zoom call and someone saying goodbye by saying ‚Äúsee you later. Enjoy those (stim) toys‚Äù. A break from stigma is always nice, and yes this actually happened.  https://t.co/dK83xl6Vzz
1340693580898308097 2020-12-21 00:20:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The more we fight amongst each other, the smaller the support network gets. The smaller the support network, the harder it is to make an impact. When we can‚Äôt make an impact the people making things more difficult for us all win the fight once again. #AdvocateDontcomplicate  https://t.co/psmVu28xOP
1340693571683422210 2020-12-21 00:20:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Why it‚Äôs important we avoid in-fighting in the #dyspraxia community, the #Neurodiversity community, and the #disability community as a whole: it‚Äôs tough to make the right level of noise, get petitions signed, and fight for change alone.
1340389537390968835 2020-12-20 04:12:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I still sometimes get invites to go over to people‚Äôs houses during #COVID19 times, and I hate saying no. But we have to take this thing seriously and I have been for a while. My bubble is small &amp; zoom is my social &amp; work life.
1340360589667917825 2020-12-20 02:17:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But my single friends who live alone and my friends with mental health conditions...well many of them are struggling on a number of levels. I wish I could do more for them. But I also realize how much reaching out can make a huge difference.
1340360587256205312 2020-12-20 02:17:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My ‚ù§Ô∏èand virtual hugs go to the people who are separated from their families or alone this Christmas. I am married and have family close by. That in of itself feels like a wonderful privilege.
1340327118455103490 2020-12-20 00:04:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ThatBlindLad Funny thing about that is I have had the same reaction. I only really hate it when there‚Äôs no obvious reason for it, which is a large percentage of the time. Because the most annoying and lovely thing about Canadians is an obsession with saying sorry for even taking up space.
1340058458020823040 2020-12-19 06:16:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @SNeurotypicals The Rainman comparison doesn't do it any justice. I read in @stevesilberman's neurotribes that the cast of Rainman spent a lot of time with an actually autistic person. Sia just talked to Autism Speaks, which has a really sketchy "a cure is coming soon" false hope angle.
1340021322815029250 2020-12-19 03:49:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As fun as it is to get nostalgic about my childhood, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good thing. Autistic people aren‚Äôt fucking superheroes, or a captive audience, or your latest manic pixie dream girl figure in your artsy movie project.
1340021315298836486 2020-12-19 03:49:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm a bit lost for words on this one. I‚Äôm assuming ‚Äúautistic condition‚Äù was Sia‚Äôs words? For some unknown reason, that term makes me think of Canadian anti-drug ads of the 1990s &amp; children‚Äôs cartoons from that era.
1339994168622510084 2020-12-19 02:01:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @SairaMueller Just sent a pitch your way. I feel like there has been a lot of discussions recently on accessible gaming. So really it's relating to a lived experience perspective on that.
1339949799370608646 2020-12-18 23:05:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Googled how to clean a silicone stim toy last night. Nearly gave up when most of the results had the words ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù. That word is super cringe &amp; people who say it make me angry. Because my needs are not special, I‚Äôm just #neurodiverse.  https://t.co/RHXZNvXD6s
1339672218406678529 2020-12-18 04:42:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Honestly, I always feel a little gross doing tweets like these, but I'm (also) always surprised by the results.
1339672215957155840 2020-12-18 04:42:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My 2021 goal: to take on even more #Disability lived experience-focused freelance #writing projects. Including a link to my portfolio for anyone that needs that in the new year and/or knows anyone that needs thatüëâ  https://t.co/uQvSxSmdxr  https://t.co/QuoFhktiEo
1339624005293268994 2020-12-18 01:30:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DyspraxicHelp4U Too real, and relatable. If that was me, it would probably take weeks, and I would cry and swear a lot.  https://t.co/hIepv7YtkU
1339620441468624896 2020-12-18 01:16:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Yep, I have for sure experienced the same thing. When people say "practice makes perfect" it just makes things worse. Because most of the time I'm not actually sure if it ever will be perfect or even good enough for it to not end in tears.
1339595555320647687 2020-12-17 23:37:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Mine would be well...listen &amp; learn. #dyspraxia has looked so different from when I was first diagnosed vs now. So I‚Äôm learning something new about it everyday. If I say something happens because of my dyspraxia more people need to not question it &amp; react accordingly.  https://t.co/O0prGO1qhb
1339595544495153154 2020-12-17 23:37:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A question for the #disability community as a whole: what is the most underrated thing people can do to accommodate your disability?
1339324200058806276 2020-12-17 05:39:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Dyspraxialife Yeah, I'm so sick of it. It takes the awareness fight several steps back because it gets in the way of genuine attempts to raise awareness. Yep, for sure understand why you took a break now.
1339307133343559688 2020-12-17 04:31:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just keep any dialogue about it constructive criticism &amp; debate focused rather than personal attack focused #AdvocateDontComplicate.
1339307132269846529 2020-12-17 04:31:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Keep in mind that this is #dyspraxia from my perspective. Certain members of the community might disagree with some aspects, but a big part of why I'm still on Twitter is I'm always happy to learn from others.
1339307130311020549 2020-12-17 04:31:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Meant to do this for a while, but I had a free afternoon so I decided to just go ahead &amp; do this anyway. Here's my long-overdue "what is #dyspraxia" infographic. Tried my best to make it as accessible to as many people as possible. If I missed the mark on that, open to feedback.  https://t.co/yreicZtx6i
1339228543226703872 2020-12-16 23:19:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #ADHD was trending for an hour in Toronto today, #actuallyautistic trended after Sia‚Äôs trailer got released. All we need is for #Dyslexia, #dyspraxia &amp; #dysgraphia to trend &amp; most of the #neurodiversesquad would have been a local trending topic at least once in my city.  https://t.co/Okqvd4tB1X
1338913025978486784 2020-12-16 02:25:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Neurodiverse people, like myself, learn to "mask" their neurodiverse behaviour to survive in neurotypical dominated environments. Here's what masking looks like for me right now.  https://t.co/YDFVbhUI1k
1338872890591223808 2020-12-15 23:45:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I want to believe that #COVID19 will force people to think differently about disabilities &amp; create an accommodating environment with more empathy in mind. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple. For the #disability community as a whole the fight is not yet over.  https://t.co/DtKmkFvoi2
1338557388849295364 2020-12-15 02:52:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott @insulinth0t @socialistqweer Absolutely agree! Being neurodiverse made me grow up thinking that being somewhere with as little people as possible was the most ideal situation for me. Iceland taught me just how wrong I was about that.
1338538754609451014 2020-12-15 01:38:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Masking is learned neurodiverse behaviour. It's the act of "masking" neurodiverse behaviour to thrive in a neurotypical environment. This brand new post explores when &amp; why I mask &amp; how it's changing.  https://t.co/YDFVbhUI1k
1338499846941110272 2020-12-14 23:03:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #neurodiversesquad #dyspraxia community. Is anyone wanting to broaden your access to all disability communities beyond #neurodiversity and be added to this list?
1338260320595406848 2020-12-14 07:11:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Took me many years to have a word for it but I absolutely stim. I stim when I‚Äôm stressed or excited or super focused on something. It‚Äôs the better, more commonly used word for my uncontrollable fidgeting and shaking of my hands and legs.
1338260318531760130 2020-12-14 07:11:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #Neurodiversity community friends: maybe I‚Äôm late to the party on this but just discovered @stimtasticco silicone toys for #stimming. I ‚ù§Ô∏èthem because they‚Äôre designed by and for neurodiverse people.
1338144617297022979 2020-12-13 23:31:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Several times in the past year, the @allontheboard program has spread awareness of causes I care about. Here‚Äôs their perspective on #Neurodiversity for example. If I‚Äôm in London once that COVID vaccine is in my arm, I‚Äôll try to find all on the board messages in person &amp; up close.
1337864367589765121 2020-12-13 04:58:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Good initiative if you‚Äôre able to pitch in (or at least read it).
1337483685344342017 2020-12-12 03:45:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a #neurodiverse #dyspraxic, I so badly want more neurotypical folks to say exactly what they mean, even if it's not what I want to hear. Like...I'm pretty sure my "good place" would be everyone being super literal with me about everything all the time.  https://t.co/4pEB2GFvsL
1337453779382390787 2020-12-12 01:46:44 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ManuelaBarcenas @ErinBlaskie @fellowapp Sent you a DM
1337417031457628162 2020-12-11 23:20:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman You shouldn‚Äôt have to handle it on your own. Being a woman on the internet, especially with an opinion is never easy. They‚Äôre the ones who look bad. That‚Äôs silly they created a podcast just to criticize one person‚Äôs blog. Don‚Äôt they have anything better to do or talk about?
1337414397686378496 2020-12-11 23:10:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you don‚Äôt like someone‚Äôs writing, write something your way. If you don‚Äôt like what someone is advocating, advocate your way. But I guess it‚Äôs just easier to criticize other people? But...still that‚Äôs not an excuse. Online harassment is never ok. Unfollow me if you disagree.
1337159427804327937 2020-12-11 06:17:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Yep, also pretty accurate!
1337127305290919938 2020-12-11 04:09:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @oceansofnovels I hope so too. Oh, and I recommend checking out @JKPBooks as well. They are really ahead of the curb on #neurodiverse books and perspectives. I know they have published a lot of good books on #Neurodiversity &amp; featured a lot of neurodiverse authors.
1337123299697057794 2020-12-11 03:53:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott @GilmerHealthLaw @KateandCRPS @SFdirewolf @ReiAlexandraYYC @mssinenomine I absolutely agree about York. I did my undergrad there &amp; it was a welcoming &amp; friendly place when I was only just learning how to talk about my #Neurodiversity and not be ashamed of it. Its progressive view of disabilities was a huge part of why I ended up there.
1337121082587942914 2020-12-11 03:44:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My viewpoint on this subject is available right here:  https://t.co/sNqeGCvsxt
1337121080813740035 2020-12-11 03:44:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm thrilled by just how many new projects by #neurodiverse writers are coming soon.
1337058467169906689 2020-12-10 23:35:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> ‚úÖMy official definition of #dyspraxia: the symptoms that show up in every google search of the word.  ‚úÖmy literary definition: literally a tech analogy: a mix of too many tabs open in a web browser &amp; dial up internet brain.
1336766023064834050 2020-12-10 04:13:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @RayeofFunshine Yeah, sometimes that is what it takes for people to accept that. At least you got breaks in between.
1336761388602109958 2020-12-10 03:55:25 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Short term, it‚Äôs a survival technique that can sometimes work. Long-term it can marginalize you through other people not knowing why you‚Äôre behaving &amp; reacting in a certain way. If you always mask, you‚Äôll damage your mental health, because when you need support you won‚Äôt get it.
1336761385297043456 2020-12-10 03:55:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This can manifest itself as everything from how you dress to  what aspects of your neurodiversity you let other people see. It‚Äôs learned behaviour based on observations of neurotypical behaviour.
1336761382335893506 2020-12-10 03:55:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #Neurodiversity word of the day: ‚Äúmasking‚Äù. Masking is something a lot of neurodiverse folks do to ‚Äúblend in‚Äù.
1336753502673100800 2020-12-10 03:24:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @RayeofFunshine 8 hours?! That‚Äôs intense, info processing wise.
1336708106601050115 2020-12-10 00:23:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs surprising just how forgiving people are when someone says: ‚Äúyou know what? I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable or have the energy to keep my video on today. I‚Äôm just going to listen in the background with my video off.‚Äù
1336708104013090817 2020-12-10 00:23:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As the pandemic has progressed, I have realized that too much zoom causes #dyspraxia induced information overload. My tip for other #neurodiverse people facing similar things (and anyone really) is to address it in the first few minutes.
1336311766574395398 2020-12-08 22:08:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Was interviewed for an episode of @ThatBlindLad‚Äôs podcast yesterday. Had a great chat about everything from how #dyspraxia has affected me throughout my life, to stigma and bullying. The episode is due out in the new year. Looking forward to sharing with others
1335687096896544769 2020-12-07 04:46:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Taking a Twitter break until Tuesday. If you need to reach me before then, DM on Facebook or send me an email.  https://t.co/ZDP3GTU9sw
1335288988748439553 2020-12-06 02:24:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax I was like...4 or 5. Defiantly primary school.
1334968622213632005 2020-12-05 05:11:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just finished reading this, and I am literally moved to tears by what a loving acknowledgement it is of just how hard neurodiverse people have had to fight to find a place in society. If you‚Äôre neurodiverse, read it. If you love someone who is neurodiverse, read it, and you ‚Ä¶  https://t.co/EGgL1AF278
1334920628135137280 2020-12-05 02:00:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Even if I‚Äôm wrong this time, why is that a bad thing? The #autistic brain is wonderful thing. The #Neurodiverse brain as a whole is a wonderful thing.
1334920625589264387 2020-12-05 02:00:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs amazing that there are (potential) vaccine options out there for #COVID„Éº19. What‚Äôs not amazing is that it‚Äôs fuelling #antivaxxers rhetoric + they feel like they have a platform + talking point. No matter what they say no the vaccine will not give your kid #Autism.
1334883091773607937 2020-12-04 23:31:44 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When I started to pitch my book, agents &amp; publishers were mostly accepting book club-friendly books &amp; celebrity memoirs. But I had a quiet #dyspraxia story straight from the ‚ù§Ô∏è. These guys gave me hope &amp; courage to keep pitching anyways. Here‚Äôs whyüëá
1334570410290114572 2020-12-04 02:49:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is 100% on point and accurate üëá  https://t.co/X1DPjVos9D
1334526306697031680 2020-12-03 23:54:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Don‚Äôt save, help, or assume. Just listen to what I have to say about what I need to thrive in my environment. I am not your inspiration, and I am not your burden.  https://t.co/HM8CbNOrT5
1334526297394057221 2020-12-03 23:53:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs international day of persons with disabilities day. As a #neurodiverse person all I really want is equal access to all the things my #neurotypical peers get access to. Please avoid all people with disabilities need to be ‚Äúsaved‚Äù, or ‚Äúhelped‚Äù rhetoric.
1334219569947348993 2020-12-03 03:35:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A helpful resource on how #dyspraxia affects women and how women‚Äôs experiences tend to be different than men. It‚Äôs chloe‚Äôs birthday today, so send some ‚ù§Ô∏èher way.
1334202406050160644 2020-12-03 02:26:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @EmilyyNics Yeah that‚Äôs the most frustrating part. The first time I looked into some of the history of dyspraxia I was so frustrated that the words ‚Äúclumsy child‚Äù was literally the term used in the medical diagnosis at one point.
1334160988120248320 2020-12-02 23:42:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia is not clumsy childhood syndrome, because it is not just a childhood phase &amp; can not be oversimplified to mean that someone is ‚Äújust clumsy‚Äù. There are so many different things that it affects &amp; that is why it took me years of practice to learn how to explain it.  https://t.co/zKqXde2FKo
1333867385183473666 2020-12-02 04:15:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you‚Äôre feeling a sense of despair while looking at these lists, it‚Äôs ok &amp; no rush. You might get these things &amp; you might not. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù might happen next year &amp; it might happen in 10 years. Regardless you‚Äôre not anymore or less of a valuable contribution to the lives of others.  https://t.co/KUA9XOcvWR
1333867374945165314 2020-12-02 04:15:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Unpopular opinion, but I‚Äôm not a fan of under 30, 40, or ‚Äúpretty much any other age you could think of‚Äùlists. I often see people of my generation look at these lists + ask themselves questions about their own achievements.
1333848070430351360 2020-12-02 02:58:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Video games have been a pandemic hobby for @Jandelliott and I so thrilled to see this. The more diverse disabilities involved in the design process the betterüëá
1333515573301547014 2020-12-01 04:57:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> They are essentially describing a storyline seen by a large audience. This storyline is something that spreads &amp; encourages pro-eugenics beliefs, which has always been dangerous + harmful for the well being and best interests of people with all disabilities &amp; their families.
1333515570138984448 2020-12-01 04:57:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Lived experience perspectives on disabilities matter &amp; need to be respected. Lived experience perspectives challenge the worldview of storylines like the 1 that Aaron is describing.
1333477644139192322 2020-12-01 02:26:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I know this feeling. On the #dyspraxia bad days I have experienced this. Especially when it‚Äôs also a ‚Äúchronic lower back pain, didn‚Äôt sleep too good‚Äù day. For me this is also known as the forgot what I did 5 mins ago, ‚Äúwhere I am going/ what am I doing‚Äù day.
1333433988250210304 2020-11-30 23:33:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I had an unanswered #dyspraxia question last night, but the most responsive part of dyspraxia Twitter was asleep by then. Then I found actually #Dyspraxic tumblr while googling my question &amp; I had an answer. So...yeah...this is a thing:  https://t.co/GU6z6AfTnY
1333108910560071683 2020-11-30 02:01:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Yeah, I learned this first from my immunocompromised friends and family, but than I realized it‚Äôs on point for #Neurodiverse people as well.
1333107304355536903 2020-11-30 01:55:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @QueerlyAutistic @Jandelliott can probably relate to how true this is. But honestly I believe it too.
1333095172796715010 2020-11-30 01:07:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs awful that @krystalbellax and @WyrdWombman have experienced this in the #dyspraxia community. In the early days of my diagnosis I was bullied a lot. Many others in this community have experienced similar challenges. I shouldn‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fight against each other‚Äù.
1333049668771737601 2020-11-29 22:06:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Don‚Äôt the bastards grind you down as my dad would say. How dare they be rude to you about it. I read it. It‚Äôs a good blog post.
1332771828411068421 2020-11-29 03:42:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This month I had to do this, but that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm not upset or discouraged. I just thought this through and realized it was a ‚Äúbest interest‚Äù decision.
1332767149325242381 2020-11-29 03:23:44 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman @DyspraxicHelp4U @DysSingSongMike @krystalbellax @EmilyyNics @NDNeuroNews @autisticlyaaron @AutisticPb @dyspraxicchef @kayleighm5297 Good old #neurodiversesquad  #dyspraxia Twitter üòÄ. Thanks all for just being you and never stop fighting the important and often underrated fight.  https://t.co/JoxXJsYPzC
1332751310475694084 2020-11-29 02:20:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @RayeofFunshine It's extremely important. Because hidden disabilities get overlooked and dismissed as not important by even the most enlightened medical professionals far too often.
1332748608576368642 2020-11-29 02:10:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A quick intro to how neurotypical people can be an effective ally to a #dyspraxic #neurodiverse person: 1) Never assume, always listen, 2) when in doubt, reduce the sensory stimuli. 3) 1...thing...at...a freaking...time, please. Did I miss anything else important? Comment below.  https://t.co/z8D8I4uuAx
1332690712345915392 2020-11-28 22:20:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I ‚ù§Ô∏è when I talk to people about #Neurodiversity &amp; #dyspraxia &amp; instead of them being an ignorant, closed minded jerk I get a ‚Äúwait a minute, I think I might have a type of neurodiversity that you just described to me‚Äù comment. When that happens, I‚Äôm pretty much thinking:  https://t.co/kaRfbMQlsr
1332426382438227970 2020-11-28 04:49:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @shiraisinspired Raw tomatoes, noodles, spaghetti, and rice. Not one I know but it's the texture of all of those things bother me. Good thing I'm not Asian or living in Asia because I would have so few options of what I would be comfortable with eating.
1332417063604903941 2020-11-28 04:12:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A #dyspraxia question I have heard before: preparing for calls and interviews. I do a lot of that these days. And the secret is preparation and taking notes of your main points before you dive in. This helps avoid rambling or brain fog about what you wanted to say.
1332393416903286789 2020-11-28 02:38:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman The ableism of her fan sickens me, along with their ignorance. If she had made some effort to talk to autistic people and actually learn more about them, this would be a hundred times more acceptable.
1332350867085922305 2020-11-27 23:49:35 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Having an awareness of what causes these challenges helps me control my environment, meet my deadlines, and have a decent reputation as a reliable, remote worker. So that‚Äôs the angle I‚Äôm sticking with.
1332350864661639168 2020-11-27 23:49:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> So instead I tune into my mindset, because I‚Äôm always working around my chronic muscle pain sometimes effecting my sleep, and my #dyspraxia sometimes effecting my focus.
1332350862744805376 2020-11-27 23:49:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I haven‚Äôt had the luxury of being able to say ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt write today because writer‚Äôs block‚Äù in a very long time.People have deadlines and expectations like any other type of work really.
1332350859347439623 2020-11-27 23:49:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Tonight I‚Äôm leading a virtual writer‚Äôs group session on writer‚Äôs block but I don‚Äôt believe in writer‚Äôs block: I believe it‚Äôs about something much deeper motivation, your environment, and your mindset (basically yoga speak for where you‚Äôre at mentally that day).
1332099472868974595 2020-11-27 07:10:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you want even more #dyspraxia insight, look no further than the people who are mentioned in this thread. Many of them are #dyspraxics themselves &amp; they‚Äôre all important voices of this community
1332065987089354753 2020-11-27 04:57:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax Glad you're doing a video on that. My diagnosis was so long ago that when people ask me about it, I only kind of remember. It was also so long ago that I'm actually not sure if any aspect of the #dyspraxia diagnosis process has changed.
1332046028149825537 2020-11-27 03:38:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Turn that rubbish into something positive and productive and support #disabledtalent. Add to this thread if you have any suggestions, share this with someone who might (if you know someone who might have a good suggestion).üëá
1331982162858545152 2020-11-26 23:24:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Far too many times I have mentioned my #dyspraxia + people have said ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt look disabled‚Äù. According to whose standards though? And why does this make me less worthy of my needs being taken seriously? Invisible &amp; visible disabilities deserve equal treatment.
1331637898278539273 2020-11-26 00:36:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @exclaimnews @NDNeuroNews @autisticlyaaron As one of the first people to speak up about this, I thought you would want to see this. This petition is getting a lot of attention apparently.
1331636486194794503 2020-11-26 00:30:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And this petition is apparently gaining a lot of traction, attention, and participation üôÇ! I‚Äôm so proud of you #ActuallyAutistic #neurodiversesquad community for all your amazing work.

1331253706784903172 2020-11-24 23:09:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Data from Star Trek has so many moments where he is the very accurate depiction of relatable #Neurodiversity moments of confusion &amp; annoyance where neurotypical people aren‚Äôt saying exactly what they mean. But he is 1 of the smartest people on board his ship.  https://t.co/IDjbbe7Y63
1330988818955198465 2020-11-24 05:37:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman @4licerose I honestly needed to hear something that today so thank you üôÇ

1330986864115916803 2020-11-24 05:29:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Today I had the chance to go back &amp; make my #dyspraxia book even better. Today was also the start of #Lockdown2 so for sure a good start to that. Postive news on the book today but keeping the details quiet because it's not finalized or offical (yet).
1330932040468934657 2020-11-24 01:51:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @4licerose @WyrdWombman Stuff like this is more important than I can even begin to put into words. But one thing I can say is that images of people that gave me that same sense of confidence popped into my head as I read that.
1330892851668873218 2020-11-23 23:15:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The #dyspraxia experience is proof that we‚Äôre a long way away from truly understanding the brain. I grew up thinking that blending in or ‚Äúmasking‚Äù was the only solution. Now I am loud, proud &amp; vocal about my #neurodiversity because we need more #dyspraxiaawareness.
1330594391401041923 2020-11-23 03:29:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @poddostarline @KarLeia Me too üëã! After college, I was finally starting to have access to communities where I was in more control &amp; more at ease in a lot of different aspects of my life. Then #neurodiversity went from my big giant secret that I was hiding to something that I proudly told everyone about
1330589676831432706 2020-11-23 03:11:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Today is the beginning of Irish #dyspraxiaawareness week. To help address the confusion of those who are wondering what #dyspraxia even is, I think this @krystalbellax graphic sums it up perfectly. More awareness content coming soon.  https://t.co/Vzz4Y7BmI0
1330581931214434306 2020-11-23 02:40:28 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @CosmoFaenyx @WyrdWombman Self diagnosis is just as valid in my opinion. Far too many doctors have ideas from a different century about what is &amp; isn‚Äôt worth taking seriously. And that can create a very real barrier for #Neurodiverse people who just want their needs to be taken seriously.
1330579590046158850 2020-11-23 02:31:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @CosmoFaenyx This came up in my feed because I follow @WyrdWombman. Welcome to the #dyspraxia community, and that‚Äôs amazing you finally got your diagnosis. As a fellow #Dyspraxic I know how important that is.
1330578142344384514 2020-11-23 02:25:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is why we need the #dyspraxia diagnosis to be accessible to all. This is also why we need therapy options that can make it easier to manage, from OT &amp; PT to appropriate communities &amp; resources to be accessible to all. Knowing is important for your mental health.
1330558717465681921 2020-11-23 01:08:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ItsEmilyKaty I have an older brother who has always been really good at not bullshitting me about anything, including stuff I don‚Äôt really want to hear. The only reason I found out is because of my brother.
1330541553962651649 2020-11-23 00:00:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 3) approaching #dyspraxia with a sense of humour makes life a lot more enjoyable. Like...a lot more enjoyable.
1330541550896619521 2020-11-23 00:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 2) Even if they don‚Äôt have #dyspraxia everyone has something health related. Not everyone is like the bullies I experienced in school. Some genuinely want to understand and support others.
1330541545662140417 2020-11-22 23:59:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 1) there is no value in keeping my #dyspraxia secret &amp; refusing to ask for the accommodations that I could so easily access. I did that for a bit out of shame, and it made my life more challenging than it needs to be.
1330541542638051329 2020-11-22 23:59:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> In solidarity with @dyspraxiaIRL‚Äôs choice to have its own #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek I wanted to share 3 things I wish I knew when I finished secondary school and was about to start post-secondary education about my #Neurodiversity #DAWEIRE
1330541538447863810 2020-11-22 23:59:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm not Irish as my accent gives away within seconds. So I can‚Äôt talk about the #Ireland #dyspraxia experience with any sort of accuracy. But I am #Dyspraxic.
1330206186382176259 2020-11-22 01:47:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DrewGurza Frustations like these are why I make an effort to learn the words for specific disabilities that are approved by people who actually live with those disabilities. It‚Äôs why I also don‚Äôt mind when people correct me when I use the wrong label or word without realizing it.
1330191885223276544 2020-11-22 00:50:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Diversity and inclusion is showing up in every industry conversation. But to make it more than a buzzword you need to address the reason why a particular group is feeling left out &amp; excluded.  https://t.co/XYXNnybB4o
1330191873194012676 2020-11-22 00:50:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The most valuable lesson that can be learned about the Sia movie controversy is that if your ‚ù§Ô∏è is truly in the right place + you want to be a platform for...any type of #Disability really, actual people who live with that disability need to be spoken to &amp; consulted 1st.
1329871003066003458 2020-11-21 03:35:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If there is, I want to know about it. The closest thing I can think of is #neurodiversesquad, but that is #Neurodiversity in a much more general sense of the word. @DyspraxicHelp4U and @WyrdWombman: do you know of anything like this?
1329838358739247105 2020-11-21 01:25:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @autisticlyaaron No worries, my mistake. I‚Äôll keep that in mind for next time.
1329835325926105091 2020-11-21 01:13:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The key lesson: if you want to make a movie about any type of #Neurodiversity talk to people who live with these conditions &amp; spend enough time with them to know what their life is actually like. It is not a rare thing so if you haven't found them, you aren't looking hard enough.
1329835324646809601 2020-11-21 01:13:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Then there was the fact that the actress playing an autistic character isn't autistic. I have met autistic actors and actresses so I know that they are out there. I could immediately tell though because her portrayal of autism was 1 dimensional.
1329835322620973060 2020-11-21 01:13:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I was also furious to see that their primary source was autism speaks, which is a truly shitty part of autism history. Here's why, and here's the Wiki page with more info:  https://t.co/ARBldKCwB8  https://t.co/3QKuKqOX6n
1329835319185854466 2020-11-21 01:13:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I am a loyal fan &amp; reader of @autisticlyaaron &amp; the work he has done on @NDNeuroNews. As a #Neurodiverse person myself, I feel like he is representing that community with a level of courage &amp; dedication that I admire. So I don't like to see other people treat him this way.
1329835317877219328 2020-11-21 01:13:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When the trailer came out, the #ActuallyAutistic community expressed a lot of anger and frustration about it (for the right reasons), and SIA and her fans were super hostile:  https://t.co/XBDI2OkEFP
1329835314911834113 2020-11-21 01:13:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is a trailer for a movie about a girl with #autism directed by a pop star that you might have heard of, SIA. Before you jump to conclusions and say: "heck yeah, diversity &amp; inclusion". Let me tell you the most immediate problems with it.  https://t.co/nEDVjZJuUn
1329825326403350530 2020-11-21 00:33:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @autisticlyaaron @Sia A silver lining to come out of this though. #ActuallyAutistic is trending in Canada on Twitter today because of all this.
1329820307591471104 2020-11-21 00:14:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @autisticlyaaron @Sia The trailer for her movie looks terrible. Yet more nonsense preaching the one dimensional ‚Äúshe‚Äôs an inspiration‚Äù narrative that is so toxic &amp; dangerous for the mental health and well-being of #neurodiverse people.
1329801321080369154 2020-11-20 22:58:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Yep that‚Äôs me üëã. Hello fellow #Dyspraxic friends.
1329522534883217418 2020-11-20 04:30:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I'm sorry for the misspelling of your name @kaytichristian. Anyways, the point is still the same!
1329500900042399748 2020-11-20 03:04:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Going to be recording an episode of @ThatBlindLad‚Äôs podcast I‚Äôll be featured on December 2020. More details coming soon.  https://t.co/EBbpkBHF0f
1329466334032375816 2020-11-20 00:47:28 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ThatBlindLad I would love to üôÇ. Because that is so important. Feel free to DM me the details. Going to follow you back momentarily to make that easier.
1329451792355221509 2020-11-19 23:49:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> People who share their #disability stories are setting a positive example. Stigma is a huge issue, especially in the #dyspraxia &amp; #neurodiversesquad community. I wouldn‚Äôt be sharing my story, if it wasn‚Äôt for others just like me who shared their story.  https://t.co/Z942JdsoNw
1329142527090417668 2020-11-19 03:20:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Once I was discharged from the hospital I got my first birth control pill prescription. I have been on and off the pill ever since &amp; my Anemia is no longer an issue. #ThxBirthControl
1329142526025097216 2020-11-19 03:20:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When I was 18 years old the Anemia got so bad that I was hospitalized. I had a lot of blood transfusions &amp; tests, and they gave me an IV version of the birth control pill with massive amounts of estrogen in it.
1329142524963926026 2020-11-19 03:20:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When I was 13 years old I fainted at a local restaurant when waiting in line with my parents for Sunday brunch. After a lot of medical tests, doctors learned that I was severly Anemic and my consistently heavy periods were the cause of this.
1329142523437125639 2020-11-19 03:20:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It's #ThxBirthControl day. There's a lot of stigma about birth control, so I make a huge point of being open about it to encourage other women to do the same thing.
1329118682925178882 2020-11-19 01:46:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @JBrearley @esioul @Danwhite1972 Just DM‚Äôed you and included my email address in the DM. Email me if you want to talk through the details.
1329116093659668481 2020-11-19 01:35:45 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ballinskelligs2 Aw thank you üôÇ.
1329073099023609857 2020-11-18 22:44:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs my 11th #Twitterversary . Me and my Twitter account have been a lot together, from my senior year of university to the launch of my online business, and getting to know all the wonderful folks in the #dyspraxia community.  https://t.co/tczvW9AaCt
1328774137943367681 2020-11-18 02:56:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Then there is the fuel for the fire this creates for everything from social stigma to pro-eugenics individuals. That‚Äôs extremely dangerous for neurodiverse people and their families.
1328774136068452354 2020-11-18 02:56:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Because #Neurodiversity is not a mental health issue, it is simply about the wiring in your brain. I have never met an autistic person who has run a person over in a van because of their autism.
1328774133723901953 2020-11-18 02:56:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> He claimed that his autism made him unable to determine the difference between right or wrong, or the consequences of his actions. Autism is not the same as a mental health issue. So if that was his lawyer‚Äôs legal advice it is extremely irresponsible.
1328774131429609472 2020-11-18 02:56:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a #Neurodiverse person myself I was appalled to hear that the man who killed all those people tried to use his #autism as a reason for not being criminally responsible for what happened.
1328774128648728577 2020-11-18 02:56:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The other night I was watching @CBC, something that @Jandelliott have done on a nightly basis since the pandemic started. Apparently the guy who killed a bunch of people in his van in my city a few years ago finally got criminal prosecution.
1328741090044891138 2020-11-18 00:45:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And in Canada too üôÇ. Will be checking the #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek hashtag during Irish #dyspraxia awareness week. Happy to RT anything my Irish #dyspraxic friends might have planned/ have been working on.
1328466366270230533 2020-11-17 06:33:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @juliamarygraham That‚Äôs a real thing?! I mean I recognize the value of sharing bad client experiences on @forexposure_txt and @clientsfh anonymously because it‚Äôs a learning experience for freelancers at all stages of their career. But non-anonymous satire: not cool at all.
1328460681943912449 2020-11-17 06:11:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Bragging about this with zero shame: I edited all words on this website, and the finished product looks amazing.  https://t.co/226BuKW4JP
1328449692770955265 2020-11-17 05:27:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @LetsGoCNote My friends who have worked in IT taught me this particular gem as well:  https://t.co/rYOUd0WoPC
1328446248521773059 2020-11-17 05:14:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @kaleighf Yep, pretty spot on. Pretty much how I get past it too.
1328444988187963393 2020-11-17 05:09:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The second wave in my city is really bad. Thank god masks have been mandatory indoors for months now. I work from home &amp; so does my husband. Our entire social bubble is now just us &amp; my parents. We‚Äôre safe, we‚Äôre some of the lucky ones. I remind myself of that everyday.
1328444985524563968 2020-11-17 05:09:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Grocery stores have been a super stressful place for having a #dyspraxic brain during #COVID__19. Everyone‚Äôs stressed out mindset &amp; the pressure to not let my impaired sense of space &amp; time get me too close to people is very real. Especially with an immunocompromised husband.
1328387104720740355 2020-11-17 01:19:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My brand new @PelaCase is the perfect shade of pink &amp; environmentally friendly. It‚Äôs also great for my #Neurodiversity in 2 ways: 1) it‚Äôs a really smooth texture &amp; 2) it protects my phone from my chronic clumsiness and tendency to drop objects all day, everyday.  https://t.co/VtH1W1jjcV
1328071633140150274 2020-11-16 04:25:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Probably 1 of my favourite parts of Twitter is that you can tell your favourite writers, artists, advocates, and people in general that you liked something they did recently &amp; why. Or you can give them constructive criticism as well without leaving the house.
1328055123357143045 2020-11-16 03:19:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @alliecdecker 1. Fair and reasonable revisions and feedback 2. Respect for my time and process 3. Clear instructions and payment agreement
1328005208971096064 2020-11-16 00:01:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs true though...every part of it
1327701375942320128 2020-11-15 03:54:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Really good question. Anyone else have an opinion on this?
1327701117971664898 2020-11-15 03:53:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @JoannaNoBanana Visual representations of spatial instructions needed to advance from 1 part of a game to another. ‚ÄúRight‚Äù or ‚Äúleft‚Äù, ‚Äúeast‚Äù or ‚Äúwest‚Äù are concepts I struggle with &amp; I can‚Äôt read maps. And a narrative script that is 1 not several things at a time would make games easier to follow
1327683714508349440 2020-11-15 02:43:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I want to believe this. I really do. I want to live in a world where everyone from your nurse to your favourite tv presenter can be #Neurodiverse &amp; society gives them what they need to thrive.
1327681858730070017 2020-11-15 02:36:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @D_Ans01 If we are united in our shared desire to make things better. I‚Äôm always worried when #Neurodiversity advocacy groups fracture over things that aren‚Äôt worth the energy or time. We can do this if we are focused &amp; energized despite differences.
1327671143281594369 2020-11-15 01:54:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Yeah why not? It overlaps too much with the other #Neurodiversity awareness weeks and that isn‚Äôt good. I think @DYSPRAXIAFDTN is responsible for the October day.
1327665187315396609 2020-11-15 01:30:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Ireland has its own #dyspraxiaawareness week this month. It starts November 22nd for anyone that is interested. Had no idea? It‚Äôs okay. Only just found out about it today.  https://t.co/RKkQIoQaDS
1327644132244942848 2020-11-15 00:06:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Yeah my hand writing has well...kind of improved but there‚Äôs still a lot of people who can‚Äôt read it, and my signature looks like the signature of a school kid. Glad I mostly type these days anyways.
1327642415386267654 2020-11-14 23:59:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Same. My memory is not amazing and that is a big part of where it can be challenging. Words related, I learned how to read and write later than my peers and I think that is memory related too.
1327631046544908296 2020-11-14 23:14:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer #dyspraxics who are bad at maths are the ones who also have #dyscalculia. I think people mix this up because some not all people  who have #dyspraxia have some other type of #NeuroDiversity as well.
1327369023332511744 2020-11-14 05:53:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù stories on the news that focus entirely on the parent or some other family member of someone with a disability, and treat the person with a disability like they‚Äôre not even there.
1327325426566516743 2020-11-14 03:00:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A hundred freaking times yes, but we‚Äôre both remote workers so perhaps we‚Äôre kind of bias. Doesn‚Äôt change my POV on this though. Not to mention the ableism of this statement &amp; lack of consideration for people who need to stay home and take care of chronic health conditions.
1327285434800623622 2020-11-14 00:21:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Me too. Especially when I look back at the era when I was ashamed of my #dyspraxia &amp; would not tell anyone about it for far too long. Don‚Äôt recommend keeping it secret &amp; not telling anyone, but I also understand why people do that.
1327051890723598338 2020-11-13 08:53:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @skzjennie All my really horrible memories of people calling me out in a large crowd for not paying attention, when it was actually an environment and processing issue.
1326982963058315265 2020-11-13 04:19:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The cool social media find of the week: @RaspberryMcCann the only drag performer (that I know of) that also has #dyspraxia. Even has a positive message about it.
1326974227770200078 2020-11-13 03:44:44 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @englisheduCATER @pvalles1972 @WyrdWombman @RaspberryMcCann @bbcthesocial Exactly. I was just telling my husband last night how cool it is that there‚Äôs an openly #dyspraxic drag queen out there. And honestly @RaspberryMcCann I think your description of dyspraxia is one of the most refreshing takes I‚Äôve seen in a while.
1326971850283491330 2020-11-13 03:35:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @pvalles1972 @WyrdWombman @RaspberryMcCann @englisheduCATER @bbcthesocial It‚Äôe really shitty @RaspberryMcCann is getting all this hate. Drag is an amazing thing really, because people can celebrate who they are on the inside instead of the person other people want them to be. So that‚Äôs what makes a #dyspraxic drag queen so cool.
1326875370558255107 2020-11-12 21:11:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #Neurodiversity is not anyone‚Äôs fault &amp; it‚Äôs not about how you‚Äôre raised. It‚Äôs the lottery-like randomness of how your brain functions. At this point, I shouldn‚Äôt have to say that, but enough people out there don‚Äôt know that.
1326649164902625280 2020-11-12 06:13:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DyspraxicHelp4U Agree with you 100% on that @DyspraxicHelp4U. I'm really excited to share some of the amazing stuff going on in the community. There's so much potential for positive growth and change and that's amazing üëç
1326645123351007234 2020-11-12 05:56:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman @RaspberryMcCann This is amazing. I always secretly hoped there was at least one openly dyspraxic drag queen out there, so I guess I got what I hoped for.
1326642621033439233 2020-11-12 05:47:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @reciteme @EmilyyNics #dyspraxia? In the web accessibility conversation? As someone who lives with it, I am thrilled to hear that. Wish this was a thing years ago!
1326641376629559297 2020-11-12 05:42:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> That feeling when you get revisions back on a freelance writing project &amp; realize you‚Äôre working with a client who is a good editor &amp; really good at constructive criticism  https://t.co/HRshq6c11h
1326595250639540229 2020-11-12 02:38:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Listening to @SFdirewolf on the @deathsexmoney podcast and as a #neurodiverse #dyspraxic I admit I understood much sooner than the host did what she meant when she said ‚ÄúI had to learn to be organized in my brain‚Äù when talking about her college experiences.  https://t.co/c1MESKgo0P
1326543797484810244 2020-11-11 23:14:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> To all those who once served, and all those currently serving I understand and respect what you do more and more with age #CanadaRemembers
1326543794527875076 2020-11-11 23:14:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> With two generations of family members who served in the British army during the world wars, and a brother currently serving in the Canadian army, Remembrance Day has always been a source of pride and importance for me.
1326538026932002817 2020-11-11 22:51:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @autisticlyaaron @Medium Awesome! Gave you a follow as well. Looking forward to reading some of your articles.
1326298504239734784 2020-11-11 06:59:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just published a brand new post, ‚ÄúThe challenges of staying fit as a neurodiverse person‚Äù on @Medium  https://t.co/qYVubzoCSL
1326265948161138696 2020-11-11 04:50:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ThisIsJordanKay I replied no but the real answer is yes but no one can read it and it looks like a child‚Äôs scribbling. Good thing my signature is the only time I use cursive these days.
1326263579620806656 2020-11-11 04:40:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Words to live by. I would say the same thing about all disability community derogatory terms. Language matters, because it affects perceptions and viewpoints.
1326233831943385089 2020-11-11 02:42:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @dyspraxicchef I feel like that so perfectly sums up the part of the dyspraxic brain that non-dyspraxics rarely see but need to understand. Because it is so much worse when it‚Äôs mistaken for laziness or incompetence.
1326232283049828354 2020-11-11 02:36:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is why we need to fight. This is why we need to make sure that #Neurodivergent and neurotypical people get equal opportunities. Because history can be repeated, and we shouldn‚Äôt let it be repeated.
1326232280021479426 2020-11-11 02:36:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It is a complex history filled with everything from the eugenic movement, to a history of neurodiverse people getting punishment, getting damaging experimental treatment, being institutionalized, and being denied education and employment (for being who they are).
1326232276905111553 2020-11-11 02:36:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Reading about the history of #Autism and #Neurodiversity as a whole leads to many, many heavy stories explored. But all that heaviness gives you a real appreciation of how far we‚Äôve come.
1326225431843004423 2020-11-11 02:09:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Amy_jkp @JKPBooks Just sent a submission your way. I‚Äôm glad to know I have an option out there that is entirely neurodiversity focused and many of your org‚Äôs goals so closely align with the goals of my book.
1326198047680966658 2020-11-11 00:20:28 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman What an excellent suggestion. I have been pitching literary agents for four months, and it feels like one big gamble in terms of how much they‚Äôll ‚Äúget it‚Äù or see the value in it. Open to options like this at this point too.
1326176489914703872 2020-11-10 22:54:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Why we should never be so tough on ourselves for needing a break, and not getting as much done in 24 hours as we originally hoped. Timely advice for sure, especially during this phase of the pandemic.
1325913379987468289 2020-11-10 05:29:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The CBC isn't perfect. In fact, sometimes I mock the moments were its political correctness gets too politcally correct. But I'm still proud of what it has done to preserve its reputation, and it's a Canadian institution that I'm genuinely proud of.
1325913379018584071 2020-11-10 05:29:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Without it, we are simply a clone of our American neighbours, and are failing to support or recoginize both the good and bad things going on in our own backyard. Then, talent starts looking abroad &amp; we lose people who could make a difference in our society.
1325913377957441536 2020-11-10 05:29:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> No, I'm not okay with #DefundCBC. As the daughter of an @ACTRAToronto member &amp; someone with family friends who work for @CBC, I have seen why funding it is so important. Funding the CBC keeps the news factual &amp; supports Canadian talent &amp; stories.
1325899919140532230 2020-11-10 04:35:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @autisticlyaaron I have the same issue. Really became aware of it when I first tried yoga. Still not used to all the muscle/ bone cracking noises that always happen.
1325876382719676418 2020-11-10 03:02:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What an amazing idea üëçüèª. Hope to see the rest of the theatre community worldwide do similar stuff. Eventually, maybe, someday, hopefully ü§ûüèª.
1325824810597888000 2020-11-09 23:37:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs like being an awkward adolescent in P.E class all over again despite the fact that my teenage years were a while ago.
1325824807800352768 2020-11-09 23:37:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My hypotonia has come back strong. I have had to adjust the things I was taught to deal with the pain to suit the realities of #COVID19. I‚Äôm always caught between the excitement of trying new things &amp; the challenges of trying new things while being #Neurodiverse
1325824805120172033 2020-11-09 23:37:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When you say turn right or bend my knees, the wires in my brain might cross and hear one thing but do another.
1325824802163200004 2020-11-09 23:37:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What I wish I could tell every fitness instructor I‚Äôve had in my adulthood, and every P.E teacher I had in my childhood knew about my #dyspraxia. It will never be as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù as you make it seem and claim it is.
1325820033600286720 2020-11-09 23:18:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @EmilyyNics Yeah just wasted an unnecessary amount of time in the process.
1325604094145421312 2020-11-09 09:00:19 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @kayleighm5297 Aw man! Can so relate. For me though this happens when I‚Äôm helping make a meal, and I can‚Äôt remember what I was doing two minutes ago and take something out of the fridge that makes literally zero sense at the time, and next thing I know I‚Äôm spilling and dropping things.
1325492306896678913 2020-11-09 01:36:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just found out Alex Trebek died. Thanks for all the sick days, and family evenings throughout my life. Thanks for being a background presence in my living room. May he Rest In Peace.
1325465986313674752 2020-11-08 23:51:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> For the second time in my life I have found an Oxford dictionary definition that is totally wrong. The first time was when I found the 1960s dictionary edition of the word communism. #dyspraxia affects adults too by the way.
1325186531238285318 2020-11-08 05:21:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ballinskelligs2 @krystalbellax Yeah, I watched a Canadian national news media stream of it and it has been confirmed by multiple sources that decide elections. Trump wants to dispute it in court, but some of the journalists talked to some legal experts + they all said he doesn‚Äôt have a good enough case.
1325120479447822338 2020-11-08 00:58:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As someone who has to have a America as a neighbour...all I have to say is....  https://t.co/iTfZbi58du
1325109950302064643 2020-11-08 00:16:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Yeah, definitely. That‚Äôs makes it so relatable.
1325105520538161152 2020-11-07 23:59:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Bad #dyspraxia afternoon: a recent example. Getting lost on the way to a store I have passed a hundred different times before, dropping cans of cider all over the floor once I get there, and being off by an hour about what time my writing group is &amp; everyone wondering where I am.  https://t.co/AzuRCPiQ93
1324789797114826752 2020-11-07 03:04:35 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Setup my Eventbrite page for the next #dyspraxia #Canada meetup. Do you know of anyone who might be interested?
1324761041050439682 2020-11-07 01:10:19 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just wanted to share that because it is a real sign of progress #mentalhealth wise in my community.
1324761038902988802 2020-11-07 01:10:19 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Even going in the park on the CAMH grounds seemed like a terrifying and unpredictable experience. Now patients that aren‚Äôt a harm to others can walk around and it‚Äôs not a big deal.
1324761036847747075 2020-11-07 01:10:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> That is amazing to me, because when I was a kid CAMH patients were the people you weren‚Äôt supposed to talk to, who were closed off behind walls.
1324761034733871119 2020-11-07 01:10:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I was thrilled to see how much friendlier it was than I remembered. The CAMH buildings seemed more like buildings that could be mistaken for a regular condo building rather than a facility for addiction and mental health.
1324761031881740288 2020-11-07 01:10:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I never noticed this before, but @camhfoundation has really shifted since I was a little girl. The other night, I was out for a walk and went in the Ossignton @ShopprsDrugMart.
1324528085644025856 2020-11-06 09:44:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Me too...and absolutely. That‚Äôs all I have to say about that üëçüèª.
1324517831648620545 2020-11-06 09:03:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @thatbberg Especially the portion of it that uses words like ‚Äúhustle‚Äù and brags about the number of hours they ‚Äúhustled‚Äù. Sure, hard work is required but is it really a good thing when you‚Äôre hustling so much so often that you‚Äôre always missing out other not work related things in life?
1324456954266345472 2020-11-06 05:01:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Ah, no worries. It just happened to show up in my feed anyway.
1324454402967613440 2020-11-06 04:51:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Retweeting someone looking for #dyspraxia resources. Leave a comment if you have suggestions.
1324445514272747521 2020-11-06 04:16:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @JuliaEMcCoy Me too. I‚Äôm so sick of explaining to them for the millionth time that I‚Äôm married so no thank you. I shouldn‚Äôt have to for something that is clearly for business and work.
1324444469509394436 2020-11-06 04:12:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I have got this too way too many times. The answer to the are you married question is ‚Äúyes‚Äù but that‚Äôs hardly the point. I have blocked a lot of people who treat my consulting services Facebook page, and even my Instagram and LinkedIn like a dating profile. It clearly isn‚Äôt.
1324372565029199873 2020-11-05 23:26:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman Same thought about Canada too. I have watched the uk, American, and Canadian elections for years. So I would say that if I had to pick one I would go with the uk or Canadian systems which are essentially the same political systems in a lot of ways.
1324349627198525443 2020-11-05 21:55:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A disability issue within the American election that I admit I didn‚Äôt take into consideration, but it defiantly makes sense.
1324107000670785542 2020-11-05 05:51:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If I want to talk to you, I will. If I want to be your friend, I will make an effort to be your friend. Why is that so difficult to understand for some people?
1324106998028357634 2020-11-05 05:51:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The worst part of being a woman on the internet: people who think that putting yourself out there, and talking about something to do with either your work or something much bigger than you is a sign that they have to get your attention, friendship, consent, or time.
1324098288665190403 2020-11-05 05:16:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DyspraxicHelp4U Just like...people making a living out of helping people who happen to have dyspraxia. Like I feel like it would be cool to hear the story of a dyspraxic firefighter, healthcare worker, police officer, etc if such a thing exists.
1324064103787384833 2020-11-05 03:00:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> How to build trust in 2020: 1) attend relevant events &amp; join relevant communities, 2) help people on a regular basis, 3) create (any) kind of niche content that positions you as someone who knows what they're talking about, 4) be patient &amp; don't expect results overnight.
1324033763685392385 2020-11-05 01:00:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #socialmedia cold pitches that skip the "establishing trust first" step are as absurd and gross as walking around your city's downtown and asking every stranger who walks by to be your husband or wife.
1323824605111422977 2020-11-04 11:09:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And me too for the #Neurodivergant American wing of twitter. Stay strong my friends.
1323823898488614913 2020-11-04 11:06:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Emotional support Canadian is trending on Twitter in Canada during #ElectionNight. @Jandelliott if you think about it are sort of that...in a way for American friends on Twitter.  https://t.co/KAkkL5erQD
1323812985316454401 2020-11-04 10:23:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I would say that üá®üá¶is basically the same thing as üá¨üáßin this statement. And yeah...accurate as someone who has watched all 3 of those elections for years. #Election2020
1323764814703939586 2020-11-04 07:11:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My collection is now complete of buttons meant to take the stress out of explaining to strangers: ‚ÄúI have a disability and here is what it is.‚Äù Thanks @sootmegs (and also equity buttons)  https://t.co/bmV0Yn1cJb
1323726363640168451 2020-11-04 04:38:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If it gets bad enough for my American friends to come here: we‚Äôre about as nice as we seem on TV. We have public healthcare, and our cops are friendlier, and our news stations are always very subdued and calm and politically correct, like our PM and most of our politics really.
1323726359642939392 2020-11-04 04:38:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Us Canadians &amp; probably the rest of the world (excluding America) during #Elections2020 . But seriously though, on a historical level most of what happens in America affects Canada. So of course I‚Äôm watching the election tonight.  https://t.co/654BXIzflZ
1323701547327512584 2020-11-04 03:00:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I have had an unconventional professional life so far. I was a work from home professional from the moment I finished college. For far too long, I felt like I had to apologize about it. But pandemic times have normalized #WorkFromHome &amp; that is amazing to me.
1323671549417869314 2020-11-04 01:01:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What makes me good at my work, and how is my #dyspraxia a blessing for that? I have a gift for making people who aren't typically in the public eye but are good at what they do feel comfortable enough to open up about their stories &amp; experiences. Yep...that's my "superpower".
1323339099118444546 2020-11-03 03:00:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> There's a lot of stigma about #neurodiversity, but there are also lots of surprises as well. There's always someone who knows someone who is neurodiverse or mentions their neurodiversity because you gave them the courage to speak up about it.
1323308914180608000 2020-11-03 01:00:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A @thespecials song that reminds me a great deal of what my American neighbours are expressing about this election season. I don't want to tell you to vote or to vote for someone specific, because I get it &amp; have been following American news:  https://t.co/rAlluaUGF8
1323281329841123328 2020-11-02 23:10:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @FullyThoughtOut I put up an ad on Kijji (Canada‚Äôs e-bay) which included my rates and list of all my skills and a link to my blog, and I got flooded with messages. Some of them were paying customers in the end, and some of them weren‚Äôt.
1323276607059075072 2020-11-02 22:51:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Yesterday I did a virtual yoga class with a lot of movements I haven‚Äôt tried before despite #dyspraxia and ongoing chronic back pain issues. No pain, no upset-related to not really understanding what‚Äôs happening so I consider that to be a good session.  https://t.co/fd8b0BRvA4
1322976703015194628 2020-11-02 03:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 1 of my favourite parts about wearing clothing with #Neurodiversity and #dyspraxia messaging is the reactions. I even had a construction worker read what was on my shirt outloud and tell his co-workers that he agrees. I still wonder if he was neurodiverse or knows someone who is.
1322946638286127109 2020-11-02 01:00:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I know women my age who have encountered people who use LinkedIn as a dating site and honestly I don't get it. LinkedIn is for professional, not sexual relationships. And I feel like their messaging makes that pretty clear.
1322599324166070273 2020-11-01 02:00:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Have a happy Halloween everyone and stay safe. My not be able to go to the annual Rocky Horror Picture Show Shadow cast show at my local movie theatre this year, but the Tim Curry Halloween message they always play before the movie is the next best thing:  https://t.co/pDfJcq3yV6
1322570887812571138 2020-11-01 00:07:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @MicrosoftEduCA We need this for #dyspraxia as well. But there are a lot of people with #dyspraxia who also have #Dyslexia so I‚Äôm still happy to see this.
1322570539324551169 2020-11-01 00:06:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This seems like a positive step in the right direction for the #neurodiversesquad #Dyslexia community but as a #dyspraxic I can‚Äôt help but hope for something like this for the #dyspraxia community as well.
1322569161604796417 2020-11-01 00:00:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott convinced me to turn off my #socialmedia push notifications on my phone after a day where I  looked visibly exhausted from my phone exploding with push notifications &amp; messages. I have no regrets about doing that. Because now I can respond on my own terms.
1322322563176009728 2020-10-31 07:40:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @mydyspraxia Yeah it was a while ago. He had back surgery and it was the first time I really understood the importance of the patience perspective for the most part so I often go back to that story.
1322296957688229889 2020-10-31 05:58:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It got so bad I was sneaking in his insulin and supplies for him. But I think you have a good point in a sense that waiting rooms and all the forms are terrible at accommodating the needs of #Neurodiverse people as well along with the entire ‚Äúgoing to the doctor‚Äù experience.
1322296954433536009 2020-10-31 05:58:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The silly thing is he has had diabetes since he was a child &amp; he is in his thirties. He also taught other people how to manage their diabetes in the past professionally. I would understand if he was unconscious or was unaware of his surroundings for whatever reason but he wasn‚Äôt.
1322236828422909952 2020-10-31 02:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Running out of things to do has never been 1 of my #COVID__19 era problems. But when I do, nothing is more worthwhile than calling people who I care about &amp; I know are totally alone in the pandemic. Especially all the elderly people in my life without access to technology.
1322206930534862850 2020-10-31 00:01:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A decrease in social media followers is a sign that you scared away people who aren't interested in what you have to say. That is actually not as bad as it seems. I only want followers who are interested in my opinions on #Neurodiversity, #writing &amp; #contentmarketing
1321922639368212480 2020-10-30 05:11:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Indoors working on some text transcription for work today, but damn...the trees out my window are pretty today.  https://t.co/MrUaKuysv8
1321904601814208512 2020-10-30 03:59:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @NDNeuroNews Work from home is the most in control I‚Äôve ever been. I can control every aspect of my environment which is a dream for my #dyspraxia. Before I moved in my significant other, I was a lot worse at unplugging for the day, but he balances me out with structure and routines.
1321874490662522881 2020-10-30 02:00:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Being good at #socialmedia is a key part of my work,  but I still have a love/ hate relationship with it. The "love" part is the possibilities for building relationships with like-minded people from all over the world. The "hate" part is how emotionally draining it is.
1321844395361161216 2020-10-30 00:00:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> On my birthday I had a lengthy chat on the phone with my sister-in-law. But the most important takeaway was when I told her meeting other #dyspraxics has made me a lot more willing to forgive &amp; kinder to myself when my #dyspraxia creates setbacks + challenges.
1321812749534593027 2020-10-29 21:54:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Well...this study is a bit concerning, but unfortunately I‚Äôm not surprised.
1321538938767609857 2020-10-29 03:46:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @erpfiester @Jandelliott The shirt comes from an English youtuber who does a lot of videos about her own experiences with multiple counts of invisible disabilities @krystalbellax. Met and talked to her at a few zoom events recently. Thanks Elizabeth. Hope you‚Äôre well :)
1321512213929205766 2020-10-29 02:00:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> You might have noticed I haven't produced a lot of new content on my blog this month. Have had to slow down on the content creation short-term but will be back to it soon. There's just a lot to process right now (mostly good things).
1321502024278646786 2020-10-29 01:20:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ballinskelligs2 How lovely üòä. The colours are fantastic.
1321495454308274177 2020-10-29 00:54:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> More on that subject....  https://t.co/l8y2X1wqip
1321495362490847232 2020-10-29 00:53:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A voice memo thanking people for the birthday wishes and reflecting on everything worth fighting for these days.  https://t.co/GL2eW40fXG
1321481877996380162 2020-10-29 00:00:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just got off a work-related zoom call &amp; am excited to celebrate my birthday with my mom, and also my husband with cake &amp; takeout later on. It may be COVID times, but we're doing our best to make it work anyway and on COVID friendly terms.
1321469679555280896 2020-10-28 23:11:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This arrived yesterday, just 24 hours before my birthday. I got it during dyspraxia awareness week because the message is important and the money went towards a dyspraxic content creator. Want one of these shirts? Go check out @krystalbellax ‚Äòs merch store.  https://t.co/qgB2UWlgxN
1321159401122705408 2020-10-28 02:38:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a #dyspraxic, I have always had nothing but love for OTs because their work changes people‚Äôs lives and helps them live an independent life. I include myself in that statement. Happy #OccupationalTherapyDay &amp; keep up the good work üëè.
1321149755326685190 2020-10-28 02:00:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My biggest pet peeve of most of the #dyspraxia FB groups I have been part of so far: people who assume that a good Epsom salt bath or magnesium, or adding any nutrient to my diet will fix the not so fun parts of my disability. If that was true, I wouldn't need to ask for help.
1321122387262377985 2020-10-28 00:11:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When my disability is an issue in everywhere from grocery stores to other public places, sometimes I‚Äôm just a bit too overwhelmed to say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I have dyspraxia. Here‚Äôs what it is.‚Äù I‚Äôm also envious of England‚Äôs sunflower lanyard program, something that isn‚Äôt available ‚Ä¶  https://t.co/zM5Sm6JvbN
1321119683895066626 2020-10-28 00:00:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I don't like conflict &amp; in-fighting. But the older I get, the more my desire to foster collaboration &amp; thoughtful dialogue amongst other people grows. Living with a disability with an awareness problem creates that kind of mentality...well for me at least.
1320787334577770496 2020-10-27 02:00:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My favourite #dyspraxia moment of yesterday was when someone asked me how far away a street I know quite well is &amp; then I remembered that I have no idea how many minutes away any street actually is. Then I made up a number + the stranger walked in the right direction.
1320757266967105536 2020-10-27 00:00:45 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Key lessons from meet-up group leadership: people need to feel like they can safely be heard, respected &amp; never ridiculed. If people don't feel safe they'll leave, tell 1 or more friends about their experience + never come back (unless the problem is addressed).
1320737827911569408 2020-10-26 22:43:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Don't want to make a big deal of it because that's not really my style, but my birthday is in two days. So why not share a blog post that reflects on how being neurodiverse has been helpful for my client work?  https://t.co/dHwrja4gBT
1320734171824820226 2020-10-26 22:28:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @AmeliaLAppel @RJsomer As someone with a disability who is in the #amquerying stage of writing a book, I‚Äôm horrified but not surprised to see that this actually happens.
1320733537054711810 2020-10-26 22:26:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I‚Äôm trying to produce more positive social media lately, but I feel like people need to be warned that ableism does happen in this industry.
1320394812546293760 2020-10-26 00:00:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The "dealing" with people part of running a business is important but #dyspraxia used to give me a lot of anxiety when I had to do that. Then I changed my mindset from "dealing with" people to thinking of it as "helping" people and thinking through ahead of time how I can help.
1320375930804723712 2020-10-25 22:45:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Most of my professional life is writing, editing, getting client feedback, repeat. I‚Äôm good at editing other people‚Äôs work, but tools like this are necessary to not miss errors in my work.
1320150519336370178 2020-10-25 07:49:45 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DCDFilmmaker That was always a rule I lived by from the very first moment I had a social media account even with things that are supposed to be private like DMs. I think this is the one way social media can get dangerous. You‚Äôre so right üôÇ.
1320062543881273349 2020-10-25 02:00:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Both @sootmegs &amp; @queer_kate sell buttons meant to make the invisible visible by helping people understand #InvisibleDisabilities. Kate is the creator of üá®üá¶  Equity buttons. Soot Megs helps people understand everything from #Neurodiversity &amp; #mentalhealth to #gendermatters
1320039976000770051 2020-10-25 00:30:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r>  https://t.co/Vp5jPD9esz
1320032493093998593 2020-10-25 00:00:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What the pandemic taught me: getting 1 important thing done/ day is not a bad thing. Giving in to my desire to rest is (also) not a bad thing. I grew up in a culture where your self-worth is based on much you work &amp; what you do, but I'm realizing it's about a lot more than that.
1319734399122984964 2020-10-24 04:16:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer @TheaDysprxc And once I choose the ‚Äústick 2 fingers up at society‚Äôs expectations‚Äù route I was happier person overall. You‚Äôre so right Gemma!  https://t.co/4goFKcvBXa
1319700275024846848 2020-10-24 02:00:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> "But you don't look disabled" or "you're not that disabled" is not a compliment. It's a close-minded belief that someone's disability &amp; the medical symptoms that come with it aren't that important or worth taken seriously.
1319670344345583616 2020-10-24 00:01:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> There's too much shame about everything from using accessible elevators, to sitting at the front of the bus. Maybe the person you're judging has chronic fatigue, pain, or an invisible disability. Stop assuming &amp; remember: something might be going on that you can't see.
1319351466994315265 2020-10-23 02:54:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The most underrated skill of professional writing and doing basically anything creative on a freelance basis:  managing people &amp; relationships. No, you can't just write a masterpiece and hope that one day someone will notice you. That's not how it works.
1319350442992828422 2020-10-23 02:50:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @jmcmillen89 I have a similar question about talented writers who I basically put email addresses &amp; phone numbers in their hands that will lead to great opportunities if they're willing to reach out &amp; they do nothing about it.
1319337914539659265 2020-10-23 02:00:45 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Once I started to work with businesses, YouTubers &amp; other content creators I admire and go to disability activism groups where many of the people there are doing amazing things I realized that collaborating with people is much more productive than admiring their work from afar.
1319307600282996739 2020-10-23 00:00:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Still reading @stevesilberman's Neurotribes (it's a really long but insightful book so not rushing it). But definitely, the next book on my must-read list is @DisVisibility, which just like Neurotribes, was a disability activism community recommendation.
1318984780873072641 2020-10-22 02:37:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @agvbergin  https://t.co/5sHAaTFBCi
1318975458948636672 2020-10-22 02:00:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I'm a #Neurodiverse #dyspraxic and my spouse is a neurotypical #T1D. What made it easy for us to work around my #dyspraxia is my transparency about how it affects me &amp; his patience when I'm struggling with spatial processing. But our most important motto is "1 thing at a time".
1318961208611975168 2020-10-22 01:03:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Is this the book that you mentioned? Amazing and congrats üëèüôÇ!
1318955186237411328 2020-10-22 00:39:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r>  https://t.co/M3RcLJwzpQ
1318945527522799616 2020-10-22 00:01:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Being open about what isn't working is way better than acting like everything is amazing all the time. Both being a content creator and being involved in the #disability community has taught me that raw honesty/ transparency is leading by example. Because it creates a safe space.
1318926819005968387 2020-10-21 22:47:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And everyone who claims the opposite of this is probably just trying to sell a course on how they made a certain amount of money freelancing in a certain amount of time.
1318613102217318412 2020-10-21 02:00:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If running a business &amp; querying a book manuscript, and continuously building an audience for my blog didn't require a digital platform I think I would still take the entire process seriously. It's the community-building aspect that makes it worthwhile.
1318582861616893954 2020-10-21 00:00:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Far too many people give up on their platform before it gains momentum due to lack of overnight results. As someone who has blogged for 10 years, I know that it takes consistent messaging, the courage to diversify how you put yourself out there &amp; a lot of time.
1318267043628654593 2020-10-20 03:05:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @LetsGoCNote When I first started freelancing, I struggled with this even though I knew exactly what I was doing. When I got into disability activism, I also struggled with this despite decades worth of lived experience. Only thing that worked both times was witnessing actual results.
1318253062465769472 2020-10-20 02:09:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @ciarale01 As a #Neurodiverse person who is also married to someone with a disability,  the concept of that is so common sense to me. I really wish we lived in a world where that didn‚Äôt need to be said but it does! Some people in this world have close minded ideas about disabilities.
1318250826243203078 2020-10-20 02:01:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you reach out to me on #socialmedia patience is required. I get #dyspraxia community messages, messages about my blog &amp; consulting business, and now that I #amquerying literary agents I occasionally get messages about that as well. So that's a lot for 1 person to process.
1318220434584764417 2020-10-20 00:00:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Probably one of the most insightful comments I have received on something I have written in a while. This one is expanding upon a conversation about ableism that exists in the publishing world. #neurodiversesquad #dyspraxia community: what are your thoughts on this?  https://t.co/MdSYM6w8mC
1318188139773648896 2020-10-19 21:51:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @me_abandon It‚Äôs just dyspraxia for sure. Mental health and autism and ADHD are a lot more well known amongst the average person, and are much more likely to get corporate backed campaigns, and politicians tweeting and talking about them.
1317971716447023106 2020-10-19 07:31:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @MsFridayology That‚Äôs the problem with how disabilities and disability issues are treated in politics. So few politicians are people who live with a disability. I genuinely respect them more when they are willing to ask people with disabilities how they can help.
1317966505506689026 2020-10-19 07:11:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs why in fighting in #disabilities communities upsets me. Because we really, really need each other for our lives to be as good as they could be (but aren‚Äôt).
1317966504084836353 2020-10-19 07:11:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I have been told a lot of stories about the early days of the HIV/ AID movement, and clearly it was shared unity and shared struggles that led to actual progress.
1317966500829986819 2020-10-19 07:11:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The game changer is always actively going after the right collaborations with the right people and not expecting them to come to you instead. Far too many people give up before ‚Äúreal‚Äù progress is made.
1317966499303333891 2020-10-19 07:11:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I have been the Vice President of two writing groups &amp; helped out @Jandelliott in the early days of @ONinsulin4all.
1317966497642385409 2020-10-19 07:11:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But then I realized I had to dig a little deeper &amp; find similar communities willing to support me in any way they could. It‚Äôs easy to feel down &amp; like you‚Äôre not doing enough in this community. But often you just need to be more proactive when searching for the right communities.
1317966494949670914 2020-10-19 07:11:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia activism‚Äôs biggest barrier is awareness especially in üá®üá¶. Instead of letting that stop me, I took my most loyal meetup member‚Äôs advice to reach out to a blogger in that space. I had at least one moment of weakness where I asked my s.o ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù
1317872266378706947 2020-10-19 00:56:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> There are some Canadian stereotypes I like. Like....South Park‚Äôs blame Canada skit, and most Canadian comedy shows but SNL‚Äôs parody of Canadian news misses the mark:  https://t.co/Gz7qdbPpdu
1317826474255273989 2020-10-18 21:54:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @dyspraxicchef It is more how other people perceive it that I get caught up on. The moments where I really do feel like I need accommodations for #dyspraxia I feel like it can be tough to ‚Äúprove it‚Äù that I actually need the support to people who don‚Äôt get it.
1317823269588918272 2020-10-18 21:42:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Both are local talent. The weather station did a gig at the place I went to university when I was a student there. Happy to see some high quality local musicians getting a platform on Spotify.
1317823267323957253 2020-10-18 21:42:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Some really good üá®üá¶ music showed up on my Spotify new releases list today: Jennifer castle, who performed at @SummerWorksTO years ago, has a new album &amp; The Weather Station has a new single called ‚Äúrobber‚Äù that is really good.
1317543646271541256 2020-10-18 03:10:58 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Seen this before with #dyspraxia as well. Next time you assume a person is more or less disabled, please take this into consideration.
1317525888930631682 2020-10-18 02:00:25 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What if workplaces &amp; schools provided the same accommodations as people with disabilities to all who need them? I think it would be so much easier for people with invisible disabilities because the process involved in proving that you need accommodations can trigger stigma.
1317495586296418305 2020-10-18 00:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A new thing I'm trying with my #contentcreation: not just focusing on accomplishments. But I don't want to overshare either. I'm a quiet person who cherishes having a private life. I just understand all the mental health effects of social media &amp; I want to do better.
1317465463593586691 2020-10-17 22:00:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @TheLifeDyslexic Me too! It‚Äôs why I have avidly written since I was a kid. Listening to music has the same effect.
1317163430860783619 2020-10-17 02:00:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia and #dyslexia are not the same thing, I repeat... dyspraxia and dyslexia are not the same thing. But there are a lot of dyspraxic people who have dyslexia and dyslexic people who have dyspraxia.
1317133584495411201 2020-10-17 00:01:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Your bullshit dietary recommendations, no matter what they are, will not cure my #dyspraxia. I probably won't live to see the day when there's a cure for dyspraxia or any other type of #neurodiversity but I am more at peace with my disability than I ever have been.
1316844041238130688 2020-10-16 04:50:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @TheaDysprxc As someone who helps people with their content creation professionally, I know that building an audience isn‚Äôt an overnight process. I didn‚Äôt get the followers I have now until I started to be on other people‚Äôs blogs + podcasts regularly, and had consistently blogged for 10 years
1316801117393747969 2020-10-16 02:00:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 1 of the top 10 things to factor in about #Dyspraxics: self-diagnosis shouldn't be stigmatized, not being diagnosed until later on in your life shouldn't be stigmatized, and not getting OT or PT, although it did amazing things for me personally, should not be stigmatized.
1316771231333584900 2020-10-16 00:01:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The 1st time I heard a #neurodiverse content creator talk about what they are &amp; aren't struggling with right now, it really mattered. I used to feel like I had to pretend to be neurotypical on live streams, podcasts, etc but now I'm like: "yeah, I'm neurodiverse. Deal with it."
1316742504683835392 2020-10-15 22:07:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @EmilyyNics More so than I ever have in a job that‚Äôs not work from home. But some days are better than others really.
1316438886822879235 2020-10-15 02:01:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When it comes to my #dyspraxia, some work from home days are better than others. On the good days, I find just the right soundtrack to keep me focused &amp; I have no sensory distractions. On the bad days, everything I touch falls on the floor &amp; I'm easily distracted + overwhelmed.
1316408562235604992 2020-10-15 00:00:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #Disability activism + the life of a freelancer have 1 thing in common. If you simply wait for opportunities to fall in your lap, you'll experience nothing but disappointment. Even when people know who you are, you still need to keep pushing for things to happen.
1316077394424401920 2020-10-14 02:04:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @FreelanceCrnr @tispr Pitching literary agents and publishers. Before I started, I thought it was the exact same thing as cold pitching freelance clients, but actually...it's not. No one said yes yet, but it's the "no"s and "maybe"s that teach me the most.
1316076294870904832 2020-10-14 02:00:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Never apologize for needing a #socialmedia break. The only reason why I look like I never take a break is because I'm a chronic social media pre-scheduler + often create all my social media messages in large batches. It's often necessary for looking after your #mentalhealth.
1316046102207102978 2020-10-14 00:00:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A good thing to come out of this pandemic: saying "no" is getting so much easier when it comes to calls, events, and things I really don't have the energy or will power to sit through. The pay off is the extra energy &amp; time that creates for the much more urgent things.
1315713852248653824 2020-10-13 02:00:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Randos on social media are like: "during the pandemic, I've knitted a sweater &amp; wrote a novel &amp; watched an entire tv series." I'm just continuing to be as unapologetically #dyspraxic as normal &amp; patting myself on the back when just one thing on my to-do list/ day gets done.
1315701642990366723 2020-10-13 01:11:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A flashback in time to my visit to Morocco. I miss this country and want to go back. It is seriously such an underrated and misunderstood country and I feel like I‚Äôll be back one day.  https://t.co/1jFXKxi04H
1315687259706982400 2020-10-13 00:14:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A valuable conclusion to the Dyspraxia Awareness Week conversation. What should we avoid if we want to celebrate and feature more neurodiverse voices and stories?  https://t.co/bwAwKvttuX
1315683842041229312 2020-10-13 00:00:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I was reading about these guys yesterday: they're a not-for-profit org fighting for diversity in the publishing industry &amp; storytelling as a whole: @wordisdiversity. Their mission statement definitely grabs my attention and approvalüëá  https://t.co/sScCgg5ftC
1315651605145018368 2020-10-12 21:52:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman @TheaDysprxc Yeah, I agree with @WyrdWombman . I would also say that it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect. I find that stumbling through a word or a technical glitch or whatever actually makes the whole thing more worth listening to and more relatable.
1315373633607544841 2020-10-12 03:28:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @StephTaitWrites Radical thought probably: but why not accessiblity for all? The biggest problem around it is the stigma that happens if you don‚Äôt meet someone‚Äôs criteria of someone else. I know this is a huge issue for people with invisible disabilities and chronic conditions especially.
1315368929519382530 2020-10-12 03:09:25 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Happy #thanksgiving2020 to my Canadian followers: sure in COVID times we can‚Äôt have large family gatherings, but we can celebrate in other ways. Do something nice today. It doesn‚Äôt have to be something big. Even just reaching out to people is perfect.
1315351531777077249 2020-10-12 02:00:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you want to know what #dyspraxia is, ask a person who lives with it. In some cases, people who live with #dyspraxics are also good resources. But not everyone is lucky enough to live with someone who is well informed &amp; accepting of their dyspraxia.
1315321373884121089 2020-10-12 00:00:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I used to think advocacy was beyond my reach. I'm actually very introverted. Then I realized it was about something I was good at all along sharing stories &amp; real-life experiences. Being loud + clever is not a prerequisite for making an impact.
1315052339317833729 2020-10-11 06:11:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This thanksgiving I‚Äôm greatful for Canadian healthcare. Moment ago got a flu shot, and it cost me nothing. It was quick, efficient, and a well organized process. I can be quite cynical but this is something my country does right.  https://t.co/wG5CTFihAd
1314989071874379778 2020-10-11 02:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Something I  want you to remember about #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020: people with #dyspraxia or any other type of #Neurodiversity aren't your inspiration story or object of pity. We need you to respect &amp; listen to what we do &amp; don't need help with.
1314959076258967553 2020-10-11 00:00:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you're feeling tired after putting yourself out there, that is perfectly ok, especially for #Dyspraxic people. All that stimuli is extra tough for processing-focused disabilities because our brains have to work hard for information to stick. #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1314924697960808448 2020-10-10 21:44:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs why we need each other‚Äôs support, and we can‚Äôt fracture the communities that provide that support.
1314924695272251393 2020-10-10 21:44:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Every new job, relationship, environment, or experience is always the same question: how will I help this person understand and will this person ever understand? And that‚Äôs emotionally damaging and anxiety inducing.
1314924692390785025 2020-10-10 21:44:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The hardest part of having #dyspraxia isn‚Äôt the dyspraxia itself but it being the awkward misunderstood sibling of the #Neurodivergent community.
1314924689358237698 2020-10-10 21:44:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It couldn‚Äôt be anymore appropriate that the end of #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek and #WorldMentalHealthDay overlap.
1314629984422637568 2020-10-10 02:13:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer Don't give up whatever you do. I have heard of people who have reached out to 50 or more people before one person said "yes".
1314628472380235776 2020-10-10 02:07:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer It‚Äôs a tough and very subjective industry. I have been trying to get my book published for a few months but no luck yet. I think they want to be more inclusive, but don‚Äôt think every agent and publisher is there quite yet with being inclusive enough.
1314626707207458818 2020-10-10 02:00:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> There are so few #dyspraxia books worth reading. Too many of them suggest that it's #Neurodiverse people who need to change, not their environment &amp; other peoples' attitudes. Keep up the momentum of #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek &amp; keep fighting. We deserve so much more than this.
1314596568318832642 2020-10-10 00:00:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I'm beaming with pride about the collection of prose &amp; poetry Mia from my #dyspraxia #Canada group has produced for #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020. Here's a passage, and you can download the rest on her blog:   https://t.co/zqF5seM6so  https://t.co/PEoi3DnE8T
1314293458664910850 2020-10-09 03:55:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @PhilosopherCrip As the #neurodiverse person seeing this in my feed, I think that‚Äôs fair. So many people in my community find it extra hard to ask for help. And this is responding to why: you have to prove that you need help &amp; that‚Äôs not an easy thing to do for everyone in every environment.
1314282267573919744 2020-10-09 03:11:25 +0800 <rosiemay_r> In case you need a break from the craziness of 2020, here‚Äôs a photo of my brother‚Äôs dog Beryl when she was just a puppy chewing on a chunk of meat bigger than her.  https://t.co/BrreoHARFC
1314274879877808131 2020-10-09 02:42:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I have been part of this conversation in many ways behind the scenes because this is my husband so well...of course. To me this is a loving and respectful tribute to a dedicated participant in the #t1D advocacy world.
1314264381723676679 2020-10-09 02:00:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Why I'm proud to be supporting #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek: it's the small things really: like being able to go on Zoom with other #Dyspraxics and losing track of a train of thought being a communal experience.
1314259991390547972 2020-10-09 01:42:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax Got lots to say about that so...  https://t.co/wO6eIlN9ov
1314234234702307333 2020-10-09 00:00:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek: why it matters in #Canada: It's the only #Neurodiversity condition with no local advocacy groups sticking up for your rights in the best &amp; worst of times. #dyspraxia is also left out of the conversation when disability funding &amp; inclusivity is discussed.
1314204226260619269 2020-10-08 22:01:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I think this articulates so perfectly how gender stereotypes affect #dyspraxic women and women with other disabilities as well.
1313902101131595776 2020-10-08 02:00:46 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Something I wrote for #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020: an opinion piece on the greatest strength that the #dyspraxia community has at its disposal: unity &amp; how it can be both a blessing and a curse.  https://t.co/GVQ7uVTc7a  https://t.co/p8tOJw9NBm
1313872120347320322 2020-10-08 00:01:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Employers need to make accommodating people with disabilities in the workplace more than a PR statement. To me,  #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek is the perfect time to re-share my @thegoodtrade post on how to make workplaces more disability-friendly.  https://t.co/0787hPkdfZ  https://t.co/o16FSDg2eh
1313837914686713858 2020-10-07 21:45:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> London being part of #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020 in this sort of way honestly makes me so proud.
1313558051522326528 2020-10-07 03:13:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 @WyrdWombman @sadeokayla @SarahDyspraxia I'm glad I was able to tune in! Honestly, I was feeling a bit "blah" today, and hearing from familiar faces in the #dyspraxia community made me feel a lot better.
1313539686913245192 2020-10-07 02:00:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia challenges are invisible yet present during #COVID19 especially. Examples of that include going to the grocery store &amp; too many crowds making me physically &amp; emotionally freeze in place. Canada needs a @sunflwrlanyards program. We don't have 1.
1313533833178947584 2020-10-07 01:37:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @krystalbellax is live now on her YouTube channel along with @WyrdWombman, and @ballinskelligs2. Good talk on #dyspraxia in women.
1313509521533399043 2020-10-07 00:00:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek, I'm extra aware of my strengths. I'm a patient &amp; empathetic caregiver. I have turned my strongest coping mechanism of habitual writing into a business. And I'm stubborn + persistent at learning everything that I either want to learn or have to learn.
1313483107958489092 2020-10-06 22:15:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @allontheboard @DYSPRAXIAFDTN @florencemachine @Caradelevingne @DyspraxiaUK @NHSuk @NHSMillion @NHSEnglandLDN As a #dyspraxic person myself, all i have to say about this is thank you. Nice to see someone putting a definition out there that doesn‚Äôt suck &amp; isn‚Äôt me having to explain it myself.
1313477677807013891 2020-10-06 21:54:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @me_abandon  https://t.co/mngCrTzlL9
1313476867081596928 2020-10-06 21:51:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @lukas8909 Similar story for me. My mom had to spend so much time helping me learn the basics somehow &amp; she showed up at my school and told people off when she didn't feel like I was being treated fairly. When I finally got OT, at least that took the pressure off her a bit.
1313465327997644801 2020-10-06 21:05:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Life with a #dyspraxia brain in a nutshell. Well...an important part of it at least.
1313464720482021381 2020-10-06 21:02:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @H_Bettsworth That alone is the most genius form of #dyspraxia awareness. Great way to explain it without saying anything.
1313177296640057345 2020-10-06 02:00:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I don't remember much about my #dyspraxia diagnosis. But what I do remember is that I was in jr kindergarten &amp; it was the 1990s. My family was poorly equipped resource-wise &amp; got so little support when trying to find the care that I so badly needed. #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1313146988037369856 2020-10-06 00:00:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I  have done remote work for 6 years because #dyspraxia creates sensory sensitivity &amp; processing challenges. So the opportunity to have maximum control over my environment is a huge perk &amp; really liberating. #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1313124664076636160 2020-10-05 22:31:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> A very (perfect) for Dyspraxia Awareness week day 2 read. This one is a reflection on how being neurodiverse has been a good thing for my interactions and experiences working with clients.  https://t.co/dHwrja4gBT
1313116559423008768 2020-10-05 21:59:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> They‚Äôre doing great work, and I have been to some of their events. So Billy is totally right and you should follow @DyspraxicWomen for #dyspraxia awareness during and after #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1312814743992840192 2020-10-05 02:00:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The best #dyspraxia advocates I've met are people who live with it. The best advocate, in general, I've ever met was @NSmithholt12 whose son was #t1d &amp; died from insulin rationing. Moral of the story: patient &amp; families of patients' perspectives matter. #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1312809481974280192 2020-10-05 01:39:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @EmilyyNics My big dream is that the dyspraxia hashtag trends on twitter in at least one country. By collectively agreeing to RT each other well...you never know.
1312806518883061760 2020-10-05 01:27:19 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Emma is one of the first politicians I‚Äôve heard about living with #dyspraxia. I think her #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek2020 message is an important one.
1312784600708583425 2020-10-05 00:00:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> To kick-off #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek I wanted to share @diversebooks definition of diversity. It can be really hard to get the same level of accommodations as others in the disability community. So reassuring to find a definition of diversity that formally recognizes #DCD symptoms  https://t.co/cjRG8RuBoe
1312743420797095936 2020-10-04 21:16:35 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Lotty_ONeill I love how this sums it up, and the art is fantastic!
1312743290425544704 2020-10-04 21:16:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Amazing work Charlotte. Great art and your explanations in both words &amp; pictures are informative, easy to understand, but also fun.
1312497029914877953 2020-10-04 04:57:31 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just published a brand new post, ‚ÄúWhat you need to know about the glue of disability online movements &amp; advocacy: unity‚Äù on @Medium  https://t.co/Qv8nbthdnA
1312462285240111104 2020-10-04 02:39:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The backstory behind how I got started both my blog and my business (just in case you ever wondered about that).  https://t.co/NBE5E3PPAf  https://t.co/CbLxUSjyoy
1312434805833961472 2020-10-04 00:50:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> So proud of you guys üôÇüëç. And such a good cause
1312423369401344002 2020-10-04 00:04:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @kayleighm5297 Well those frustrated white guys can just start their own dyspraxia event then. Actively wanting to empower &amp; organize your own community is a good thing. Especially if that‚Äôs community doesn‚Äôt get enough support.
1312419835935158275 2020-10-03 23:50:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer  https://t.co/LwRsmwI1t4
1312417697624477701 2020-10-03 23:42:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And what‚Äôs the point of that really? Aren‚Äôt we better off recognizing our differences and helping each other make actual change? There‚Äôs enough hate in this world already.
1312417695581822976 2020-10-03 23:42:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I can relate &amp; have experienced so many of these things. What she is responding to is what I can ‚Äúthe privilege olympics‚Äù something I have seen in a wide range of disability communities where people try to out do each other on how little privilege they have for no actual reason.
1312377099303485440 2020-10-03 21:00:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The new schedule with my blog: new content will go live Mondays, every 2 weeks. Here's why I made the decision, and some of the benefits that influenced my decision making.  https://t.co/z5cX5RM0um  https://t.co/83zNTfrhPT
1312056250407026688 2020-10-02 23:46:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But in the meantime I recommend following the following people to stay informed on #dyspraxia from the POV of people who live with it  long-term: @WyrdWombman, @DyspraxicCircle, @DyspraxicHelp4U, @krystalbellax, @DyspraxicWomen, @EmilyyNics, @Dyspraxialife, @NDNeuroNews.
1312056246699204608 2020-10-02 23:46:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My experiences with this condition will be shared, and I‚Äôll RT whatever awareness week content seems worth sharing.
1312056244765691909 2020-10-02 23:46:00 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The reason I‚Äôm doing this is I realize that far too many of my followers have limited or no understanding of dyspraxia and this awareness week could change that.
1312056243142483969 2020-10-02 23:45:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you only follow me for that, you can find a feed focusing just on that via my LinkedIn and Facebook pages throughout that week.
1312056240273592320 2020-10-02 23:45:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Throughout #dyspraxia awareness week, I‚Äôll be temporarily turning off the tool that auto-tweets consulting business &amp; blog related updates. This will start Sunday, and end a week later on the 11th.
1312025490224541696 2020-10-02 21:43:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Probably one of my most important lessons of the pandemic: don‚Äôt apologize for saying ‚Äúno‚Äù. When I overload myself, I get overwhelmed and anxious, when I get overwhelmed and anxious my #dyspraxia gets tougher to control and manage, and coping mechanisms are less effective.
1311718313324621825 2020-10-02 01:23:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> How to make a blog post worth sharing. A proven formula for tremendous results that people actually love.  https://t.co/L8ADn5V4S1  https://t.co/wHMY4mXHje

1311655217008701440 2020-10-01 21:12:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia #neurodiversesquad friends: here‚Äôs something you might want to listen to, RT, and share with people
1311391818366488579 2020-10-01 03:45:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is a message of‚ù§Ô∏è for the #NeurodiverseSquad #dyspraxia community. It is tough out there right now, especially for those with multiple counts of #neurodiversity &amp; #mentalhealth conditions. And remember:  https://t.co/5T3Sl3ZBPV
1311372144769748992 2020-10-01 02:27:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The idea of location independence &amp; moving to a whole new country is nice &amp; all but you also need to make it work. This week's guest shared how she not only moved to a new country &amp; started a business, but juggles other relatable stuff like being a mom!  https://t.co/Qa6CHfXTqr
1311306544055812096 2020-09-30 22:06:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Are you making any of these costly business blog mistakes? The good news is that there are solutions, and they will help make your return on investment a hundred times better!  https://t.co/JrNVfIflJI  https://t.co/bYj96lmQyi
1311301643191881731 2020-09-30 21:47:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a community, that is the real reason why we need to raise as much awareness as we possibly can. The people in positions of power especially need to know that the available support can be so much better.  https://t.co/7WY7Xg4rvW
1311301631540068352 2020-09-30 21:47:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As someone who has known I have #dyspraxia since the 1990s, I used to ask myself quite often: why is the awareness still so bad? It has been medically proven to not be rare. Then I realized it was an accessibility problem to proper resources, OT, PT, care, and also a diagnosis.
1311079464533663745 2020-09-30 07:04:37 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @NDNeuroNews @TheaDysprxc : maybe you might be interested?

1311060223491280904 2020-09-30 05:48:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I also edited something for @DyspraxicHelp4U that is coming out around awareness week. But what's much more important to me: I plan to RT as much awareness week content and events as I can during that period of time. I want to give this community the support it deserves.
1311060221557645312 2020-09-30 05:48:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Things I pre-recorded for #dyspraxia awareness week: an interview about my experiences with #dyspraxia with @bernadinefox and a podcast episode with @NDNeuroNews. Don't know the actual days and times yet. But will keep all followers posted with the specifics.
1311058255624441858 2020-09-30 05:40:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DyspraxicWomen @SarahDyspraxia I loved it! Glad I went and finally had a window of time to show up.
1311051998922498050 2020-09-30 05:15:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer @TheaDysprxc Sounds super cool to me üëçüèª. Giving me flashbacks to the only time in my life I ever tried to make a sock monkey. Let‚Äôs just say it would probably belong in that particular university.
1311007459629293571 2020-09-30 02:18:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Most of my professional life relies on regular interactions with clients. Here's how being neurodiverse has been a huge benefit.  https://t.co/dHwrja4gBT
1310970881263497216 2020-09-29 23:53:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @NDNeuroNews I have a setting on my phone set up that stops me from seeing social media and email notifications on my phone during times when I should either be sleeping or thinking about getting some sleep. I work with people from a variety of time zones so this makes a huge difference.
1310969356772401152 2020-09-29 23:47:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @kat_boogaard As someone who has a bad habit of checking my email and social media moments after I wake up, I admire this üëçüèª.
1310949225975422979 2020-09-29 22:27:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The unity aspect is at an all-time high &amp; no longer does anyone else involved have to carry the torch on this alone. Don't be afraid to reach out, and ask for help if you have to.  https://t.co/rrQZznSKY1
1310949211828031495 2020-09-29 22:27:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> To my #dyspraxia #NeurodiverseSquad community friends involved in Dyspraxia Awareness week in big or small ways I only have a few words: don't apologize about needing to rest or create boundaries.
1310946129492807680 2020-09-29 22:14:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> On the latest episode of the podcast I talked to Mira Whiting about something actually quite practical, photo shoot prep 101:  https://t.co/zgGdq1E9CM  https://t.co/bj1bu1IYPc
1310696009408880645 2020-09-29 05:40:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott @insulinth0t @iamsqueeisback With the combo of #brexit and #COVID19 it has been one big logistical nightmare. Tried phoning, tried their online form, and tried emailing and have no idea what‚Äôs going on. My dad is born &amp; raised in the uk, so according to English law I‚Äôm legally entitled to citizenship.
1310693746942640130 2020-09-29 05:31:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Dear üá±üá∑ neighbours to the south of me who have #dyspraxia: our physical and legal borders may be closed for Covid reasons, but always happy to spread the word about stuff like this. Sincerely your #dyspraxic üá®üá¶ northern neighbour.
1310671420888879106 2020-09-29 04:03:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> So the clients I work with in the end are ones where they want to work with me anyways despite that anxiety. I always want to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm #neurodiverse‚Äù but those words don‚Äôt come out as fast as I want them to.
1310671417223114756 2020-09-29 04:03:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I run my own consulting business and as a #Dyspraxic person I honestly admit that talking to new clients over zoom gives me so much anxiety and I‚Äôm always exhausted by the end of these calls. But I‚Äôm good at what I do, and have like...a decade of experience.

1310598916920967174 2020-09-28 23:15:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When I was diagnosed, doctors told me more boys than girls get #dyspraxia.

1310268692807245824 2020-09-28 01:22:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My most important 1 is running. I have a dad who works in the film industry + his industry has a lot of uncertainty. He stays fit to deal with that. From a very young age, he encouraged me to get up &amp; move &amp; the more I run the more I feel in tune and in sync with my #dyspraxia
1310265807738417159 2020-09-28 01:11:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a neurodiverse person myself, I just want to say ads like this are wrong and this needs to stop. Far too many just like me are unable to access decent relationships or employment because this point of view is far too widespread. I am reading a book on the history of autis‚Ä¶  https://t.co/BM8sTeOORp
1310232303575150594 2020-09-27 22:58:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Eventually I had a diagnosis, but we were given nothing but an outdated pamphlet on clumsy child syndrome from the uk, and zero support or guidance.
1310232301612171264 2020-09-27 22:58:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> In a pre-social media age, my parents had to do a lot of digging and talk to so many different people to find proper therapy along with a diagnosis. That was the era where a lot of my free time was spent at doctors offices, clinics, and hospitals.
1310232298978238464 2020-09-27 22:58:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But the awareness is really bad: everyone knows what #adhd and #Autism is, but finding people who know what #dyspraxia is well...that‚Äôs far too rare. I have even met doctors and educators who think I said #Dyslexia.
1310228493477851136 2020-09-27 22:43:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Unfortunately, CHCs aren‚Äôt everywhere in Canada, but should be. They‚Äôre progressive institutions that don‚Äôt discriminate based on age, sexual orientation, race, social class, or disabilities. Patients are listened to &amp; doctors don‚Äôt pretend to be experts at patient experiences.
1310228491355525122 2020-09-27 22:43:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> CHC‚Äôs are a Canadian healthcare feature that serve people in a specific geographic radius. Government funding goes towards every patient served in that specific neighbourhood. So all healthcare accessed on site doesn‚Äôt cost anything for patients who live in that area.
1310228489153531904 2020-09-27 22:43:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I come from a family of working, professional creatives, so the one thing that helped my parents cover the costs was the timing of my diagnosis. I was just a kid back then so the public system and the access we had to a CHC (community health centre) made it a possibility.
1310228487253495808 2020-09-27 22:43:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> That was the 1990s, and the effects are still felt in the healthcare system. It‚Äôs also not perfect. Prescription drugs, PT, and dental care is out of pocket without insurance for adults specifically. Unless you‚Äôre an in-patient.
1310228485340835840 2020-09-27 22:43:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Unfortunately, past conservative governments have cut the health care budget claiming that this puts more $ in the pockets of the average working person. I am old enough to remember my province‚Äôs Mike Harris years when so many important social programs had their budgets slashed.
1310228482958397440 2020-09-27 22:43:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Let‚Äôs start with the pros. First of all, we have a public health care system so visiting a GP or being an in-patient at a hospital is a tax-payer funded thing. You don‚Äôt need insurance &amp; don‚Äôt have to pay thousands of dollars to get treatment and care.
1310228479460474885 2020-09-27 22:43:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Most of my #dyspraxia followers are from the uk. I just wanted to take a second to answer the question: what is having dyspraxia like in Canada? Although this is probably better suited for something like a blog post, consider this an intro&amp; not a complete answer.
1310217939593891842 2020-09-27 22:01:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @astronaut_Alex1 @WyrdWombman This is giving me flashbacks to my first year of university when I lived in the all girl‚Äôs section of the campus residence. That happened to be the section for loud, frequent partying. So I faced something pretty similar when I had to wake up for a 9 AM class the next morning.

1309874322387935232 2020-09-26 23:15:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @MSWLMA Yeah! Exactly! And I‚ù§Ô∏èthat word count dash idea. I know so many people in my writing group who would appreciate the motivation to keep working on their books. Writing is such a solitary thing and it doesn‚Äôt have to be.
1309870463800225792 2020-09-26 23:00:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> ‚ÄúWhy is it so hard to build a community as a writer? You feel like you‚Äôre an outsider looking in.‚Äù - @MSWLMA podcast. Is it just me or does that sound like a struggle so many people in the #dyspraxia twitter community are articulating lately as well?
1309859867654606848 2020-09-26 22:18:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a person with #dyspraxia myself, the worst part has been the stigma element. But I think this provides a very positive yet practical perspective on how to make sense of it allüëá
1309857902103064576 2020-09-26 22:10:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When approaching a new client, here's a go-to pitching tactic I encourage everyone to try. Do your research and find something in common, so that the message feels personal &amp; worth reading. People...in general respond extremely well to personalized messages.  https://t.co/Zxl5Zk6fUE
1309855904351817729 2020-09-26 22:02:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Emzy100 Thanks Emma üôÇ
1309581559343783940 2020-09-26 03:52:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Since not every neurotypical person is as good as my husband at this, I get the sentiment. I'm super #dyspraxic so all jokes + comments involving space &amp; time confuse me.
1309538943344484354 2020-09-26 01:03:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I talk about #dyspraxia a lot but realize that not everyone knows what it is, or my dyspraxia story. Here's something that I wrote that provides an introduction to both those things.  https://t.co/V6HcWD1cEW
1309498992263401474 2020-09-25 22:24:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This #dyspraxia awareness week, let‚Äôs aim high &amp; aim for this. üëá

1309233173763588096 2020-09-25 04:48:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @MostFoolhardy They're for sure helping, so far. Yeah, I think it's more triggered by too many hours of work that requires a lot of deep thinking. Although when I lived with my parents, sometimes it would happen even when I'm deeply focused on a TV program, according to my mom.
1309230944210112512 2020-09-25 04:39:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But even when I don't show up to events for a few weeks, or take a while to get back to people I am quietly cheering for every small victory in the #dyspraxia community.  And when it's something bad, I'm eagerly hoping for things to get a lot better.
1309230942817579016 2020-09-25 04:39:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Since I am trying to do so many different things in my life right now, from running a blog &amp; business to finding an agent for a book, to playing a key leadership role in 2 meetup groups I can't always get back to people as fast as I want to.
1309230939088785412 2020-09-25 04:39:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Every little thing is a daily highlight for me in this community, both big and small, from a re-tweet to people offering to spread the word about any effort I make to spread awareness.
1309230937495023623 2020-09-25 04:39:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I used to feel really alone in my experiences with this disability, but all the love, support, and recognition I have got from people with shared experiences have helped me realize that not everyone I talk to has to be a person who doesn't understand #dyspraxia
1309230935649521664 2020-09-25 04:39:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> #dyspraxia awareness week is just around the corner, and it feels like a really amazing privilege how many people in this community have invited &amp; encouraged me to participate in their podcasts, live streams, and overall content creation.
1309173708267888653 2020-09-25 00:51:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Check out my podcast episode, where Yolanda McAdam of Suite 532 reveals what she has learned from 2 decades of experience with running a small business.  https://t.co/OECZujsEN1  https://t.co/xrz4EEe8UO
1309131138145943560 2020-09-24 22:02:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I don‚Äôt support organizations who work with organizations that have violated human rights on multiple occasions. As a Canadian myself, I‚Äôm also somewhat ashamed because they started in Vancouver. So they‚Äôre a Canadian company originally.
1309131135914586116 2020-09-24 22:02:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> In disheartening #marketing industry news, @hootsuite signed a contract with ICE, the American organization that has been putting kids in cages and deporting people who did nothing more than seek asylum or were born in a different country.

1308891676199604226 2020-09-24 06:11:08 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Since I was little girl, I have suffered from random spells of fidgeting and shaking. Experts have told me it is 100% #dyspraxia and #neurodiversity related. All this time I‚Äôve spent at home lately working in front of my computer has brought back my most awful fidgeting habi‚Ä¶  https://t.co/GlvEyvtWVM
1308891171461173248 2020-09-24 06:09:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Here's a sneak peek of my book's most important themes.  https://t.co/ZUDsdToyCh
1308843871841984512 2020-09-24 03:01:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But at this point, it‚Äôs an experiment, rather than something that I know for sure works. I‚Äôm around people far less than I was pre-lockdown, so now is a good time to try out a new coping mechanism.
1308843869409288194 2020-09-24 03:01:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Been thinking of taking matters into my own hands and purchasing a plastic ball (not solid but squeezable) and self-teaching myself to use it as a tool to stop the shaking and fidgeting.
1308843866389385217 2020-09-24 03:01:09 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The more I‚Äôm working from home at home, the more my uncontrollable fidgeting and shaking habits come back. I have been told this is entirely a result of my #Neurodiversity &amp; #dyspraxia. The shaking/ fidgeting hasn‚Äôt been this uncontrollable in a long time.
1308823741338656769 2020-09-24 01:41:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> According to @99u, 8% of all men &amp; 0.5% of all women have some form of colour blindness. So how can we #design/ create content that accommodates colour blind people? This is an important factor to consider with your #contentmarketing.  https://t.co/3zrQMV2noz  https://t.co/iPbLiECZRl
1308795790131957760 2020-09-23 23:50:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @enttruth If more people were willing to listen, I think we would all be a lot better off overall. I wish the whole idea of "just listening" was a lot simpler for a larger percentage of the population.
1308794136238215168 2020-09-23 23:43:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @IanYoungBEIS @WyrdWombman Really important for sure. People that aren't cool with it aren't worth the time or effort anyways. I always just approach the whole "I have Dyspraxia" conversation with a sense of humour. Makes it less awkward for everyone.
1308793102635802628 2020-09-23 23:39:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman That's really cool that you're transparent about your #dyspraxia on something like a dating site. When I was single I tried a few dating sites, and never quite had the courage to mention it....until I went on a date with the guy I married 5 years later.
1308767549639852033 2020-09-23 21:57:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I decided to put it on my medium digest page, but my LinkedIn followers can also read it directly on LinkedIn. Bit of background on that photo: that‚Äôs an old photo of my older brother and I in the 1990s:  https://t.co/BU92kgx8Jd
1308584743835971587 2020-09-23 09:51:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @RachelJeanMpls @Jandelliott Yeah. Cost. Same sentiment really. Had way too many questions about why I was buying it even though my husband is a type 1 and I mentioned that. Treated it like something that requires a prescription which is strange because James usually orders it prescription free online.
1308568233511972864 2020-09-23 08:45:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Really opened my eyes to some of the stuff you all put up with.
1308568229351129089 2020-09-23 08:45:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Then I texted James and said ‚Äúis this normal? Do you normally get this many questions about your diabetes supplies. His only answers was yes. That angered and frustrated me, because I love the type ones in my life so dearly so the concept of #Insulin4all is so intuitive to me.
1308568225655988226 2020-09-23 08:45:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I picked up some blood sugar sensors for @Jandelliott tonight. I‚Äôm a wife + granddaughter of #t1d s rather than someone who lives with it myself. So sometimes I feel like there are certain things I really don‚Äôt notice. The pharmacist asked an uncomfortable amount of questions.
1308510614441033728 2020-09-23 04:56:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott @sabrinacoast_ *third person in my family to elope. Zero regrets. Love the saved money and time.
1308510225557786626 2020-09-23 04:55:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott @sabrinacoast_ As the third person in my family well...this sums this up perfectly. I‚Äôm super tired of explaining why eloping in your apartment is not weird, or unusual, or any less legitimate than a huge banquet hall or church.  https://t.co/dt8o1aHZ4l
1308461082156113921 2020-09-23 01:40:06 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @RachAC Good to know! Is it cool if I send a query before October 1st, or should I just interprate this as a sign that you're already closed for submissions?
1308456818306416641 2020-09-23 01:23:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> What to do you need to get in the habit of doing every time you publish a new #blog post (if you want actual results)? @candidlyerin breaks down the essentials into 13 simplified steps:  https://t.co/WrvxfeqUnI  https://t.co/PWT15oR2iN
1308416495073013766 2020-09-22 22:42:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But #dyspraxia gets not enough recognition or support. Especially amongst adult dyspraxics, with and without a diagnosis.
1308416491759509505 2020-09-22 22:42:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> When people tell me that I need to stop talking about my #dyspraxia, I generally don‚Äôt agree with them. Because the interactions I have everyday prove that it isn‚Äôt talked about enough...pretty much...everywhere. Everyone knows about all other forms of #Neurodiversity.
1308398345409437699 2020-09-22 21:30:49 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Human trafficking doesn't have an "easy" solution, but you can help by being a good person &amp; giving someone who went through it a 2nd chance. Amber, the founder of Eleventh Candle's story proves it's possible:  https://t.co/mgJDVzqHMw  https://t.co/clr10GlYx9
1308148839019433984 2020-09-22 04:59:22 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Jandelliott Anyone involved in the anti- eugenics fight, I have a book recommendation: Neurotribes by @stevesilberman. The history of the eugenics movement chapter is 1 of the heaviest things I've ever read, but it pretty much confirmed my belief that eugenics is awful.
1308113435629162497 2020-09-22 02:38:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Interested in including blogging in your business's content marketing strategy? Never managed a blog before?

1308088024589312000 2020-09-22 00:57:42 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just published a brand new post, ‚ÄúLiving With Dyspraxia‚Äù on @Medium  https://t.co/igwzfnYnOe
1308086908032090121 2020-09-22 00:53:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Requesting diverse voices in marketing, publishing, etc is about a lot more than just publicly expressing your support. I live with a neurological disability &amp; I chose to embrace that trend but then I realized that it has its flaws.  https://t.co/bwAwKvttuX
1308043689315520512 2020-09-21 22:01:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> For those of you who are freelance writers or have done some sort of guest writing/ blogging before this is something, you can easily do. It's still your words &amp; ideas. The only exception is ghost writing and copywriting, but that's a discussion for another time.
1308043687625064448 2020-09-21 22:01:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Update on the #dyspraxia article that is no longer available online, but I requested access &amp; permission to re-publish it. I got what I needed to re-share it on my own platforms.

1307761087203422210 2020-09-21 03:18:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Reached out to the site admin of the 1st  article I ever wrote about #dyspraxia. Meant to do this ages ago, but forgot. Although it isn‚Äôt currently accessible online, I‚Äôm requesting permission to re-publish it on my blog, @Medium, or both. Just have to wait for a response.  https://t.co/htYLHp4hIR
1307667904150806528 2020-09-20 21:08:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Perfectionism can be bad for content creation. In my latest post, I explore why, and what to do about it if it's stopping you from producing new content.  https://t.co/cgYykndb3i
1307653402218901504 2020-09-20 20:10:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This needs to continue, and this movement needs to grow in 2020 and beyond.
1307653400591503360 2020-09-20 20:10:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I feel like what unites us all is that we all realize that our community isn‚Äôt doing a good enough job at supporting and accommodating us all. But we celebrate our shared experiences anyways with a sense of humour.
1307653398414712832 2020-09-20 20:10:39 +0800 <rosiemay_r> 2020 is a weird time for us all &amp; the is a bit chaotic right now on a global level. But the one thing that gives me hope is the #neurodiversesquad #dyspraxia community as a whole. The desire to tell our stories &amp; give others a platform to tell their stories is at its peak.
1307477954105159681 2020-09-20 08:33:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @blogspacert I‚Äôve done some podcasting in the past, but I am eager to do more. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to find a literary agent for a book so anything I can do to build my platform is a good thing. Anyone looking for #Neurodiversity stories &amp; voices?
1307453758142644225 2020-09-20 06:57:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> In a sort of virtual sense of the word:  https://t.co/wtIMx6Hamp
1307453743303135232 2020-09-20 06:57:18 +0800 <rosiemay_r> We shouldn‚Äôt be talking about how to spread awareness of COVID to young people, we should be talking about how to provide PPE, protection, and support to those who can‚Äôt just stay home.
1307453740459462659 2020-09-20 06:57:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Not all can work from home like I have for six years in total, and government support is not a guarantee.
1307453737833844739 2020-09-20 06:57:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The real reason why there is a rise in cases for under 40s isn‚Äôt because of partying and stupidity (but in some cases that‚Äôs true). Many are the ones catching the virus because they‚Äôre taking a risk and dealing with crowds to pay rent and outstanding bills.
1307453735359086594 2020-09-20 06:57:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> For starters, due to the crappiness of the economy many people of my generation are taking jobs in very high risks fields (uber drivers, servers, retail, food delivery, retail, and grocery stores).

1307425988964429826 2020-09-20 05:07:01 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @WyrdWombman @ComplicatedPete @Dyspraxialife @DyspraxicCircle When is your podcast being released? And will it be on @spotify? And are you still including the "what is dyspraxia" segments in 1 of your episodes? So...many questions üôÇ!
1307396581902159873 2020-09-20 03:10:10 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer @TumiSotire Way too relatable. I would be richer than Jeff bezos if someone gave me money every-time I heard that.
1307364125757108231 2020-09-20 01:01:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Is your #socialmedia a giant mess? Do you have no idea what to post at least sometimes?  @theburrowsway has a solution: a social media calendar. Here's what it is and why it's so valuable.  https://t.co/gbl6q8V33Q  https://t.co/jmf7INAtAf
1307306544212643841 2020-09-19 21:12:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> If you've ever wondered how I juggle so many different aspects of my business: @IFTTT and @zapier help me save time on all the admin tasks I don't enjoy, but are totally necessary. Here are a few of the things I use these tools for (see image below).  https://t.co/Fdf9nUtk9i
1307024148602990592 2020-09-19 02:30:15 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Working with your 1st editor? I used my experiences both editing other peoples' work + working with editors to show 1st-time writers that working with editors isn't intimidating. If they're good at their job + your interactions are productive of course!  https://t.co/gqcTFN0f3d  https://t.co/GYYqV2dduy

1306988085104832517 2020-09-19 00:06:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @DyspraxicDiva Running too! It has been an important coping mechanism for me, but good point about yoga. A PT taught me the basics when I got chronic back pain problems from working from home and staring at a screen for so many hours on end. And meditation.

1306707954918477828 2020-09-18 05:33:48 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Always happy to share anything that spreads awareness of #Neurodiversity. Despite its long length this thread is an important one from people in the #Autism community. If you read it, you will get your assumptions about autism challenged, which is a good thing.
1306662823733403648 2020-09-18 02:34:28 +0800 <rosiemay_r> An important media appearance that my husband did today, as part of his ongoing activism work in the #Insulin4all community.
1306605568946327552 2020-09-17 22:46:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> On my @thegoodtrade debut, I explore the misconceptions and gaps in how we accommodate people with disabilities in the workplace. I have lived with a disability since birth, so this is from the point of view of someone who has experienced these challenges.  https://t.co/Mvj1g5zIqJ
1306597900319948800 2020-09-17 22:16:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> They‚Äôre all people keenly supporting #neurodiverse voices, and fighting for things that matter for that community.
1306581920755732480 2020-09-17 21:12:59 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Meant to do this yesterday but wanted to share with my followers a list of people in the #dyspraxia #neurodiversesquad #neurodivergent community. FYI: I am also *cough, cough* on this list

1306294671392505856 2020-09-17 02:11:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I took a break and treated myself to lunch at a local cafe I‚Äôve never been to before. Then I found this plaque during my break. It‚Äôs a quote from Johnny Lombardi, the founder of chin radio. The building for that station is still in my neighbourhood.  https://t.co/OzhFX9y3rw

1306244017550692353 2020-09-16 22:50:17 +0800 <rosiemay_r> On this week's episode, I had a fun, informal conversational with two co-founders about how they met/ how they make not living in the same city work. -  https://t.co/5bxk0iYMiO  https://t.co/4Ft4p7DohB
1306229381652713475 2020-09-16 21:52:07 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As a bullet journal and whiteboard user I 100% agree.
1305916160827949065 2020-09-16 01:07:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I live with a neurological disability &amp; in August I started to query literary agents. At first I was thrilled to see words like neurodiversity + diversity on peoples' MSWLs, but then I realized more work needs to be done to be diverse enough.  https://t.co/bwAwKvttuX
1305910295878135808 2020-09-16 00:44:11 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @mydyspraxia Cheering you on from Canada for using this as an opportunity to point this out üëèüëèüëèüëè. Canada‚Äôs treatment of #Neurodiversity is way too similar.
1305892521869021184 2020-09-15 23:33:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Coming soon. As I was telling my dad the other day, I think this is going to be a really good #dyspraxia awareness week. Stuff like this is the reason why. I think the pandemic has sparked some awesome advocacy work from the #NeurodiverseSquad community.
1305857287400062981 2020-09-15 21:13:33 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Recently Leesa Klich, a writer I met via the Freelance to Freedom Project group reached out to me &amp; asked if I'd be interested in contributing to an expert roundup on building confidence as a blogger. And I talked about how practice is good for confidence.  https://t.co/WhyiQAxadk
1305653625952382977 2020-09-15 07:44:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> That was fun :). For sure a perk of the COVID age. Keep up the good work with your photography.
1305590625832665090 2020-09-15 03:33:56 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This 1 is a re-post of something I wrote on Medium &amp; also featured on my blog. Right now so many people are requesting diverse voices, but that request is not yet good enough. Here's what I learned when I started to pitch a story as a diverse person.   https://t.co/bwAwKvttuX
1305569558451965953 2020-09-15 02:10:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I want just 1 platform to focus just on how this influences my work &amp; life. All articles that resonate the most with the average Medium reader will be republished on my blog (which I started to do today) üëá https://t.co/9f98Iom0Zv

1305191246630191105 2020-09-14 01:06:57 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Great places to find ideas for blog posts, based on my own experiences searching for ideas for blog posts for my blog (and other peoples' blogs).  https://t.co/y0Y78n5DLx  https://t.co/vFlo0aHA4u
1305185736199729155 2020-09-14 00:45:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Which is why I‚Äôm encouraging everyone in the #dyspraxia #NeurodiverseSquad community to use this year‚Äôs awareness week as an opportunity to tell their story. The more stories told from the perspective of people who live with dyspraxia, the more awareness will increase.
1305137251374989318 2020-09-13 21:32:23 +0800 <rosiemay_r> All I had was an incomplete manuscript. The true story of how I got a meeting with a publishing professional as an unknown, unpublished author:  https://t.co/mSRmcUsiMR  https://t.co/JY2aRBXKxR
1304905101061095424 2020-09-13 06:09:54 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs been a good day. Did the army run, chatted with a fellow #dyspraxic Canadian over zoom. For sure wasn‚Äôt the best turn out for my meetup so far, but the one-on one conversations were good. Hoping to do another one in dyspraxia awareness week
1304832819554848768 2020-09-13 01:22:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> The why statement: why it's important &amp; how to construct your own:  https://t.co/a7VnvzdVIf  https://t.co/Gcgt3xtEGU
1304796926488051712 2020-09-12 23:00:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Final time once I sent my results to the organizers: 33:43 for 5 kilometres. I‚Äôm proud of my results.
1304796924478926852 2020-09-12 23:00:03 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I thought about a lot of things, from my first cross country coach, to my memory of my brother teaching me how to duck soon after my #dyspraxia diagnosis. But a lot of fond memories of my brother, the Canadian military person I ran for were what got me to the finish line.
1304796922352472069 2020-09-12 23:00:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> With no distractions and an eerie early morning silence, nothing but my Spotify and kat the A.I voice went through my ear.
1304796919923904514 2020-09-12 23:00:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Did my virtual #ArmyRun this morning. Kat the A.I voice reminding me when I reached my next kilometre was no replacement for the screaming crowds at the non-virtual version of these events. But it was a humbling experience.
1304774423556349953 2020-09-12 21:30:38 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My top 4 tech investments: my @weebly &amp; @WordPress-based custom domains, @CoSchedule + @buffer my #SocialMediaManagement software, @zapier, my admin-based task automation software + @Calendly, my booking software for calls &amp; meetings.

1304467004183719936 2020-09-12 01:09:04 +0800 <rosiemay_r> On episode 7 of People Behind the Business, I interviewed Keisha Greaves, the founder of Girls Chronically Rock about the backstory behind her business.

1304418553379147778 2020-09-11 21:56:32 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But always open to discussions and suggestions about any dyspraxia related questions &amp; topics. Any dyspraxic Canadians who want to join can DM me to get the zoom info.  https://t.co/saCkTpcmmo
1304418543258210311 2020-09-11 21:56:30 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Tomorrow on zoom: doing another #dyspraxia üá®üá¶ meetup 2 to 3 pm (eastern standard time). Have some very specific topics in mind: the back to school season during #COVID19 especially for the #neurodiverse community + this year‚Äôs Dyspraxia awareness week.
1304412276842168322 2020-09-11 21:31:36 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I want to put a larger emphasis on building my community. So I decided to reflect on the most valuable communities I've had the privilege of being part of and how they make a difference:  https://t.co/lCfAzH9roo  https://t.co/VchNG1geeS
1304126356784066561 2020-09-11 02:35:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My business coach, Violeta Nedkova reached out to me not long after I launched my podcast, and told me that she wanted to interview me on her blog.

1304085839941693441 2020-09-10 23:54:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Searched for the #dyspraxia hashtag, something I do on Twitter once a day to see if there's anyone in the community I need to RT because they have something important to say. Today was the day where Dyspraxia trolling was the number one suggestion. This can't be good.  https://t.co/DTFVmWIG1F

1303730453858394117 2020-09-10 00:22:16 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Inevitably, there will be people who you'll have to convince that blogging is a good idea before you get started. Here's what to keep in mind when you have your first conversation about blogging.  https://t.co/na2DXVTRyG  https://t.co/Y2gTixr7q0
1303728672478769162 2020-09-10 00:15:12 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @AHahnPeters Get out of the hobby mindset. Treat it like a business as fast as you can. Invest in your business wisely. Just because someone said you can‚Äôt make money off it, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt.
1303694984944799745 2020-09-09 22:01:20 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My advice on working around the challenges of sleeping in noisy environments. Helpful for anyone that is struggling with this over the short-term or the long-term.  https://t.co/EhY8N7bD3U

1303353346875588609 2020-09-08 23:23:47 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Something I wrote ages ago was recently published on the ‚Å¶‚Å¶@Saatva‚Å© blog. It‚Äôs about sleeping in noisy environments. Great read for my #neurodiverse and neurotypical readers alike.  https://t.co/U7ZLbWLMoj

1303021378174685184 2020-09-08 01:24:40 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Asperger: ‚Äúnot everything that steps out of line, and is thus ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô must necessarily be inferior.‚Äù A radical statement to make in the early days of the German reich. When he said this he was openly celebrating the attributes of his #Neurodiverse patients
1302994343985319936 2020-09-07 23:37:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> We just need to make it even better, and update it also for the era we‚Äôre living in. This will help the unions survive for future generations and decades.
1302994341632397312 2020-09-07 23:37:14 +0800 <rosiemay_r> And we need to update the union model for an era of widespread gig work. But I grew up believing in the power of the union. The British part of my family are Labour Party voters, and I have always voted for Canada‚Äôs NDP party.
1302994337924616193 2020-09-07 23:37:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> It‚Äôs #LabourDay. I have been listening to loads of Pete Seeger all day. The unions are still strong since Seeger‚Äôs day. But we got a long way to go. Union benefits aren‚Äôt accessible enough to a large percentage of my generation.
1302979193060429828 2020-09-07 22:37:02 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Freelancers &amp; remote workers have flexible schedules but it doesn't mean they're available all the time.

1302637269849976833 2020-09-06 23:58:21 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Great thread from multiple #dyspraxics of multiple ages describing their experiences. It was so good I also added in some input.
1302636405793972229 2020-09-06 23:54:55 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @sacha_coward Known I‚Äôve had #dyspraxia since the 90s. I often use a web browser analogy to describe how my brain processes everything. The more ‚Äútabs‚Äù (social stimuli, noise, sensory distractions of all kinds) you add the more everything else processes at a slower speed.
1302592908797923328 2020-09-06 21:02:05 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Check out my interview on the Creatives Crushing Anxiety Podcast, where I talk about the hard stuff about being an online business owner, such as facing rejection and handling trolls gracefully.  https://t.co/ED4OpVtlk2
1302302145971212288 2020-09-06 01:46:41 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @zapier Uh...well I guess that would just be me. I was introduced to it at a time where I was reading a lot of productivity and female entrepreneur lifestyle blogs that always recommended it. Hard to name just one. Because there were several.
1302297039343169540 2020-09-06 01:26:24 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I might have a history of public speaking anxiety, but I actually feel like it's good for business. Here's why.  https://t.co/v70Dnlr622
1302286299831971844 2020-09-06 00:43:43 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @Lotty_ONeill What a great idea! Even just offering a definition of #dyspraxia in a comic book form with examples is a good thing. I know so many people who would appreciate that, from people who have dyspraxia struggling to describe it in words, to well meaning people just trying to help.
1302237164428767233 2020-09-05 21:28:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Just wanted to give you peek behind the scenes at how I approach my work, by showing you the six questions every new client gets asked before we get started (click on the image below to take a closer look).  https://t.co/qtnFzUCU2h
1302002619045556225 2020-09-05 05:56:29 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer @WyrdWombman @Dyspraxialife @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxiaUK Yeah, thank god. My parents are surrounded by so many neurodiverse people at this point that I think very little about the reality of it all surprises them at this point.
1301976437856051200 2020-09-05 04:12:26 +0800 <rosiemay_r> @BottomFloer @WyrdWombman @Dyspraxialife @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxiaUK Probably the time I accidentally put my parent‚Äôs landline phone on the top of the oven at its highest setting. I didn‚Äôt notice until the kitchen smelled of melted plastic. I have a really poor sense of smell so it must have been really stinky! Somehow their landline survived.
1301972857753341954 2020-09-05 03:58:13 +0800 <rosiemay_r> This is true. I didn‚Äôt get a diagnosis or testing until I was really struggling not only in school but in basic life skills.
1301927620259516417 2020-09-05 00:58:27 +0800 <rosiemay_r> My networking event "hack". I now go exclusively to events in intimate environments, where there's an opportunity for people to introduce themselves to a small group of people. Then I focus on 2 to 3 people max who: are my target audience or need what I offer. Then, I leave.  https://t.co/jA3ZGdknga

1301678583841198082 2020-09-04 08:28:53 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Listen to neurodiverse people, listen to what they do and don‚Äôt need. No level of discomfort is worth it for a therapeutic treatment which lacks proper evidence of its value and impact.
1301678581702184968 2020-09-04 08:28:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> We need to focus less on quick fixes, and more on helping people thrive, at school, work, and in personal relationships.
1301678579567263744 2020-09-04 08:28:52 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But really...is a cure even a good thing? Getting rid of neurodiversity is a bit like getting rid of everything from a person‚Äôs sense of humour to the sound of their voice. It makes people who they are, and that‚Äôs a unique and wonderful thing.
1301678577319059457 2020-09-04 08:28:51 +0800 <rosiemay_r> First of all, we need to get the notion that a cure is coming out of people‚Äôs heads. It probably never will (unless we become a world of Star Trek medical devices.
1301678575180017664 2020-09-04 08:28:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> As someone who is both #Neurodiverse myself &amp; has met plenty of neurodiverse parents myself I have definitely seen some patterns.
1301678572223049730 2020-09-04 08:28:50 +0800 <rosiemay_r> I think books, resources, videos, etc for parents of #Neurodiverse children have an important responsibility.

1300908685804343297 2020-09-02 05:29:35 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Recently, I wrote about what that means, and my perspective was featured on @curiouspub:   https://t.co/kZDgQ5njWG
1300908683824713730 2020-09-02 05:29:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> But I think the publishing industry has a very real responsibility by encouraging this diversity. We need to look beyond stereotypes, assumptions, labels that are out of date and out of fashion. But more importantly, we need to discourage "inspiration" stories.
1300908682235052033 2020-09-02 05:29:34 +0800 <rosiemay_r> Let's talk about #diversitymatters. Before you roll your eyes at me from behind whatever screen you're looking at, here's what that means from a publishing industry perspective:  https://t.co/qyDrYjCAVP
