1343410072085536773 2020-12-28 12:14:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @Darcman I‚Äôm not hitting at the Giants, the whole thing is just stupid. It‚Äôs even worse than the wild card in MLB. I mean, it‚Äôs totally possible for Washington to win it all, even with a losing regular season record.
1343409077658005504 2020-12-28 12:10:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @Darcman Yeesh. The NFL needs to re-examine how teams can qualify for the playoffs. Washington is at 6-9 and may well be the NFC East champs, yet teams like the Bears and Cardinals, both currently at 8-7, will probably miss the playoffs. Ridiculous.

But this is where his supporters prove that facts don‚Äôt matter to them. They could have checked their voting records, with his going all the way to his time in the House. He‚Äôs no dove, he‚Äôs a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing.

I‚Äôd say he was the one doing the mistreatment.

1343194768931774470 2020-12-27 21:59:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @TFFPrisoner @SilentAmuse @PWM62 @KarenLynne2828 @MTreeBandit @BenVotesBlue The intel was there regarding the matter, and to this day has been ignored.  To restate it: Hillary did not lose. It took the combination of several factors to steal the election from her.
1343194416467619840 2020-12-27 21:57:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @TFFPrisoner @SilentAmuse @PWM62 @KarenLynne2828 @MTreeBandit @BenVotesBlue I did not anticipate the combined effort of GOP cheating AND Russian interference.
1343194139438034950 2020-12-27 21:56:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @SilentAmuse @TFFPrisoner @PWM62 @KarenLynne2828 @MTreeBandit @BenVotesBlue Let‚Äôs see: he couldn‚Äôt get the back vote, and thinks he could have siphoned off some of the wypipo who voted for trump in both ‚Äò16 and ‚Äò20. Isn‚Äôt that the prediction Berners pushed? It‚Äôs painfully obvious to me that, when BS says ‚Äúworking people,‚Äù he means ‚Äúwhite people.‚Äù
1343193504063885319 2020-12-27 21:54:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @SilentAmuse @TFFPrisoner @PWM62 @KarenLynne2828 @MTreeBandit @BenVotesBlue BS lost the primary, yet he‚Äôs the one to beat trump. Shiteating Berners can‚Äôt provide an explanation how that could have happened, yet they continue to push the narrative that only he could have beat trump.

1343017545696239619 2020-12-27 10:15:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @sacca @tystiklorius Same here. I might have carried her out myself and put her in the garbage bin. Too much tolerance is being shown to these brats. They are violating the rules of a private business, throw them out, or call the cops and have them arrested. This is beyond just bullshit.

They blame the losses of their respective gods on rigging, yet cannot provide proof.  Maybe that‚Äôs where I got it wrong. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre alike.  They‚Äôre one and the same.

That he voted for regime change in Iraq? That he kept voting for continuous funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? His excuse? ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of voting against it when it will pass anyway?‚Äù
1343008833803837442 2020-12-27 09:40:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @SilentAmuse @KarenLynne2828 @MTreeBandit @BenVotesBlue Do they think we‚Äôd ignore the fact that he wanted HC be managed by each state? Even with the issue of same-sex marriage, he insisted that it‚Äôs something that should be left for each state to contend with.

Or that House Republicans did more for veterans when he was head of that committee in the Senate? Nah, not even a squeak.

1343003276506230785 2020-12-27 09:18:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @KarenLynne2828 @PWM62 @MTreeBandit @SilentAmuse @BenVotesBlue His flock then attacked Hillary for the Crime Bill. She wasn‚Äôt in Congress, yet that fact escapes them.

He thought we‚Äôre as stupid as his flock that we wouldn‚Äôt find proof his support was for the entire bill.
1343001505247453185 2020-12-27 09:11:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame Men have mistresses, kids with other women out of wedlock. But a woman does that, your a slut, unless you‚Äôre rich, a politician, or a celebrity.
1343001249415892995 2020-12-27 09:10:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame But it also shows the hypocrisy and double standards in the Philippines. They frown upon divorce there, yet the church will grant annulments, but it means you need to have money for that.
1342999658101145601 2020-12-27 09:04:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame Wow, that‚Äôs really disappointing.
1342999562194214912 2020-12-27 09:03:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame During martial law, a youth leader criticized Marcos‚Äô oldest child, Imee, on her ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù That guy was found dead the next day. No one dared to say Imee had anything to do with it, even though everyone knows otherwise.
1342999150376480768 2020-12-27 09:02:03 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame You can literally be killed there for simply saying anything negative about a politician revered in certain regions.

1342996467867398144 2020-12-27 08:51:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame When Marcos declared martial law, I was 5. By the time he lifted it, I was 13.

1342869396792999938 2020-12-27 00:26:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame Reminds me of another wypipo telling me I don‚Äôt know what fascism is, or what a dictatorship looks like, as he researched this in his dissertation. I lived in the Philippines, born a few years before Marcos declared martial law in 1972. So, yeah, I‚Äôm ignorant.
1342868731987431425 2020-12-27 00:23:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @acidsaltydame These are the same people claiming they understand socialism really well because they‚Äôve researched on it for years, then dismiss the experience of such people like Garry Kasparov.

1342533163822809088 2020-12-26 02:10:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @columbiatexan @Mel_Ankoly That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs best to aim and primary them.
1342533006687424512 2020-12-26 02:09:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @columbiatexan @Mel_Ankoly That‚Äôs my thing: why wait to be disappointed? If they‚Äôre aligned with the others, I‚Äôd rather think they share in the group‚Äôs objective of destroying the party. Otherwise, why associate with them?
1342531490916270082 2020-12-26 02:03:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @columbiatexan @Mel_Ankoly Your opinion, I respect them.  As for me, they‚Äôre JD, they‚Äôre NOT Democrats‚Äô allies. They‚Äôre the Dem Party‚Äôs version of the Tea Party.
1342489565806915585 2020-12-25 23:17:09 +0800 <SvDeng> Where is the outrage from so-called ‚Äúfiscally conservative‚Äù Republicans?  And where is the constant coverage from MSM on this clusterfuck?
1342488417377132544 2020-12-25 23:12:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @regstacks @IlhanMN Then again, they have the perfect role model in Darth Berniebus, who‚Äôs been in Congress since the 80s and has virtually nothing to show in terms of accomplishments, other than being the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúAmendment King.‚Äù
1342488030150590470 2020-12-25 23:11:03 +0800 <SvDeng> @regstacks @IlhanMN As members of Congress, they should investigate on why things got so fucked up, and then write bills so that laws can be enacted to correct such wrongs.  But these JD brats think throwing a goddamn hissy fit is what they were elected to do. /2
1342487554910777346 2020-12-25 23:09:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @regstacks @IlhanMN Obviously, NOTHING.  She thinks her job is to throw a tantrum on Twitter. Her fellow JD brat, Bowman, is throwing a hissy fit because he thinks Biden should issue an EO to forgive student debt. /1
1342482184851107840 2020-12-25 22:47:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @IlhanMN You‚Äôre attacking Biden based off of a headline that does not properly represent the entire article?  What are you, a legislator or a tabloid beat writer?

1341916861898907649 2020-12-24 09:21:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @EchoChoirBreach @femalep @BernieSanders They passed a bill in their state legislature, but the governor had to put a stop to it because there‚Äôs no money to implement it.  Just like BS, VT state legislators forgot the part that money is needed. If it failed in VT, how much more does the entire US?

1341900791272108033 2020-12-24 08:17:34 +0800 <SvDeng> Wow. WOW. The gall of this brat and her squad mate to AGAIN claim they‚Äôve done something so novel, when others before her have already done it.  Fuck. This. Shit.

But I have empathy, and my mind has been opened - and I keep learning - of the iniquities they suffer to this day.  It must come to an end.  And neither the GOP nor the far left help.
1341379261639356416 2020-12-22 21:45:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 And I follow their lead.
1341378562381799425 2020-12-22 21:42:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @eMCharge @D4Real8645 I think I will. I don‚Äôt understand those assholes saying ‚Äúbetter to reject the $600.‚Äù For families that are really struggling, $600 is a lot better than ZERO.  But, I guess, for those that $600 doesn‚Äôt even last two days, like Don, it‚Äôs ‚Äúsucks‚Äù.

What rock have you had your head under to not know that Democrats have been pushing for more money, but Mosco Mitch kept blocking it? I know $600 won‚Äôt last you two days, but for those who need it, it‚Äôs better than nothing.

You are no different from GOPers by gaslighting Dems in red states as ‚Äúpro trump‚Äù. If that‚Äôs the case, I should call you and the rest of you Juvenile Delinquents as ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù by how you vote with the GOP.

1341134609631895552 2020-12-22 05:33:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Do you know how JD found her?  A talent search.   https://t.co/2QfYkRTRxr

1341078095432921088 2020-12-22 01:48:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @peterdaou Peter, I understand $600 is something you spend within three hours.Maybe two. But something is better than nothing for struggling families.

1341073990681554949 2020-12-22 01:32:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB Because AOC can‚Äôt hold a hundred candles at Spanberger. The latter, being ex-CIA, has a lot of info and know where to get more. She‚Äôs confronted others on sensitive topics.  AOC? She was the one selected among 10,000 in a talent search by JD.

1340669075308081155 2020-12-20 22:43:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @lizzard1278 The other thing I read was that the ‚Äúbargain‚Äù he offers for buying the pillow is misleading.
1340668905132617728 2020-12-20 22:42:30 +0800 <SvDeng> @lizzard1278 Hasn‚Äôt it been established that his claims about his pillows are false? If so, why is he still allowed to advertise it?
1340663071015116800 2020-12-20 22:19:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @lizzard1278 @itsnotny Anyone who downplayed the seriousness of this pandemic should be last in line.

1340662566901719042 2020-12-20 22:17:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @KhiveBidenBro A face that even his mommy can love?
1340662253855645698 2020-12-20 22:16:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @KhiveBidenBro More materials of misery for him to make a film of, make money from, bitch about, but do nothing about.
1340658828170452993 2020-12-20 22:02:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @Zebop To the duo‚Äôs credit, too, some of their songs placed well on the Billboard R&amp;B charts.
1340658506110808065 2020-12-20 22:01:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @Zebop It‚Äôs truly amazing that, despite the fact that this is the Information Age, more people seem to be either ignorant or oblivious to facts.
1340657041078169600 2020-12-20 21:55:21 +0800 <SvDeng> I know it‚Äôs too late for her, but this just highlights the fact that our healthcare workers, especially those who care for COVID patients, should be given priority for the vaccine, not politicians.   https://t.co/TXfnkKCV6D
1340654497283108864 2020-12-20 21:45:14 +0800 <SvDeng> So, Little Marco and Miss Lindsey are worried enough about the virus that they‚Äôre among the first to get the vaccine, but don‚Äôt give a fuck about the rest of us that they‚Äôd hold back on any help.  Fuck this shit.
1340417174033346560 2020-12-20 06:02:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @SashaBeauloux Democrats need to show their nasty side. Enough of being nice.  Playtime is over.
1340416800656416773 2020-12-20 06:00:43 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @SashaBeauloux Exactly.  https://t.co/Fc4rwwEYoG

1340334120744980480 2020-12-20 00:32:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @LauraBray__ Back in the mid-80s, when I was still a teen in the Philippines, after we kicked Marcos out, some politicians talked about reconciliation to heal the nation. Many of us who marched in the streets declared, ‚Äúno reconciliation without justice.‚Äù /1
1340333198765662208 2020-12-20 00:28:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @LauraBray__ That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to see. Some Dems still think there can be a kumbaya moment.  Fuck that shit.  They want non-white people dead. They should get what they give.
1340332898818420737 2020-12-20 00:27:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @notswedish1 @KikisMa Then let‚Äôs aim for this actively.  They‚Äôve been trying to pummel us into submission. We‚Äôve shown it ain‚Äôt happening.  Time to exact some payback. They need to either shit or we‚Äôll kick them off the can.  Or IN it, along with all that shit.
1340332334999089152 2020-12-20 00:25:05 +0800 <SvDeng> @LauraBray__ His Creator has been telling him, ‚Äúkid, you got it wrong,‚Äù but Pudge won‚Äôt listen.  If what all this struggle brings about is the end of white supremacists - whether in the literal or figurative sense - is it bad?
1340331561422630913 2020-12-20 00:22:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @KikisMa @notswedish1 And we can‚Äôt count on MSM to help us on that. We need to do it ourselves. Two years, we can do it.  https://t.co/G9Fqf5a4j1

1340312574349488129 2020-12-19 23:06:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @SashaBeauloux They don‚Äôt present a problem solely to the Democratic Party. By continuously posing as obstacles for Democrats in Congress, and voting WITH Republicans, they cause a malignancy that affects all Americans.
1340312176964345860 2020-12-19 23:04:59 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @SashaBeauloux I disagree.  The Squad is a cancer to America, no different than MAGAts/Tea Partiers/GOPers.
1340291961970974722 2020-12-19 21:44:39 +0800 <SvDeng> @T_FisherKing It certainly is. I‚Äôd posit it‚Äôs how they get to have some of our accounts suspended as well, though it‚Äôs due from mass reporting for a tweet that did not violate Twitter policies.

1339373329216626690 2020-12-17 08:54:20 +0800 <SvDeng> @dentremontem @ritaag Honest answer: no.  She‚Äôs campaigned against Dem primary candidates who she doesn‚Äôt support, and then pays for political ads in districts and states during the campaigns against Rs.

1337846514228531204 2020-12-13 03:47:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB Exactly. That‚Äôs why I block them. No use wasting time on shiteating idiots who can‚Äôt accept the fact their ideology has been rejected.

1335237092973174789 2020-12-05 22:58:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @FreyrsHof @LisaTalmadge Yeah, it makes Twitter much more enjoyable when I don‚Äôt have to deal with asinine Berner clusterfucks.
1335236422589177858 2020-12-05 22:55:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @LisaTalmadge They still will not respond to this: if liberals - and Democrats - are their enemy, why the fuck are they in OUR Party?  The time for them to to shit or get off the pot is over. They should have left our Party after 2016. So, now, we need to kick them out.

She starts flapping her gums, just like Bush here, and displayed how ignorant she is before saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an expert.‚Äù Bush displayed the same ‚Äúexpertise‚Äù here.
1335229972139683840 2020-12-05 22:30:07 +0800 <SvDeng> This is who üåπare excited about?   Someone who can‚Äôt even explain why the rich have to pay their fair share? Who can‚Äôt even explain what ‚Äúfair share‚Äù is?  She‚Äôs certainly #OneTermCori.

They‚Äôve mostly voted against Dem House measures in the last two years. Democrats have been fighting for stuff like SS, enemies like JD - and you - can go kiss my ass. Fuck off, Berner.

1335104695883493378 2020-12-05 14:12:19 +0800 <SvDeng> What movement, bowel? Seems like it, coming from you, since you‚Äôre so full of shit.
1335102545908412417 2020-12-05 14:03:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @ClistonBrown @brat2381 Yup.  Remember those criticisms of Obama not doing enough during Katrina?

You‚Äôre the one bothered by MY opinion of him. YOU‚ÄôRE the one who can‚Äôt let go of the fact someone can have a different opinion of someone than you.  You want me to unfollow you? Request granted.
1335087754141691904 2020-12-05 13:04:59 +0800 <SvDeng> @thefrostqueen @JesyQ @KhiveBidenBro And that‚Äôs your choice.  As it is mine to see him as among the ranks of JD - a group I consider an enemy of the Democratic Party.  You do you, I‚Äôll do me.
1335082828380430338 2020-12-05 12:45:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @anastasjoy @KhiveBidenBro So you can say what you want about him. It doesn‚Äôt change my opinion of him. I stand by the meme I posted.
1335082464293908480 2020-12-05 12:43:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @anastasjoy @KhiveBidenBro His name, as well as Newman‚Äôs, are on their website. Not just mere mentions. If they‚Äôre not part of their group, they‚Äôre certainly not enthusiastic in rejecting or denouncing JD.

Appropriating a bill sponsored by two true-blue Dems and making it appear as if this was an idea pushed by her fellow fauxgressive fuckers?  How Bernie of her.
1335046216984514562 2020-12-05 10:19:56 +0800 <SvDeng> Wow, you aren‚Äôt even in the House yet, and you‚Äôre already flashing your arrogance. You have some nerve to claim this as a ‚Äúprogressive agenda,‚Äù you won‚Äôt even mention the names of the actual sponsors of the bill.  I look forward to you being #OneTermCori.

1335041042052046848 2020-12-05 09:59:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @tatn @Chatvert Good for her. She doesn‚Äôt deserve that crap. Let them catch COVID and, hopefully, die.

The VT Dem Chapter should see that as an opportunity to pull the rug out from under him.
1334984301826420741 2020-12-05 06:13:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlueSteelDC @RealKHiveQueenB Still hoping it‚Äôs her district. She can then mosey along to Fox and be their ‚ÄúDemocratic Party Perspective‚Äù in their talk shows.

1334980913424461830 2020-12-05 06:00:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlueSteelDC @RealKHiveQueenB What I heard is that her district is one of them.

I doubt they can fart and breath at the same time, so to ask the JD jagoffs to actually do their jobs while basking in the attention is just asking them too much.

1334314933291536384 2020-12-03 09:54:05 +0800 <SvDeng> @bblock29 That‚Äôs a tough one. For me, both of them are the new faces of the Party, not the fauxgressive JD squad bullshitters MSM is pushing on us.  At this point, I‚Äôd say Abrams - and not by much.

1334151525162250240 2020-12-02 23:04:45 +0800 <SvDeng> Tweeting about policy work does not excuse you from doing actual policy work. Which is *checks my notes* ZERO at this point on your part.  Sorry for bothering you, go right back to doing your make-up and cooking tips. Does that count as policy work for you?
1334150278971596800 2020-12-02 22:59:48 +0800 <SvDeng> This can be resolved if Republicans have enough balls to kick Moscow Mitch out as Majority Leader.  But to ask Republicans to have enough balls to do it is like asking them to be patriots.  Never gonna happen.   https://t.co/cgwhbr79F1

If someone can consolidate the data, I think it can be more accurately established just really when the virus came stateside, where it first hit, and probably how as well.

1333579119179796483 2020-12-01 09:10:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnv378 The biggest story in years, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like any of them are really trying to get to the bottom of this. In 2016, they were non-stop covering HER EMAILS, even if evidence presented were flimsy at best.
1333578670452002816 2020-12-01 09:08:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnv378 And I ask MSM: where is their investigation on this?
1333578118532042753 2020-12-01 09:06:14 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnv378 My wife, who works as a nurse here in NJ, was telling me around late December/early January that folks were coming down with flu-like symptoms but tested negative for the flu. ID doctors there are now saying it must have been around then, but without tests, no one knew.

1333066162104659969 2020-11-29 23:11:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @ClaireClegg4 @mhdksafa Taxes paid are based on income (i.e. revenue) and property owned. If a church is small, taxes would be negligible. If they‚Äôre ministries like Joel Osteen‚Äôs or Jim Bakker‚Äôs, if they get to pay through their noses, they should.

1332447432391716865 2020-11-28 06:13:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @Ordinary1World There should be an auto-tweet that automatically posts daily. That would be what I‚Äôd have there.

You fucking fauxgressives abandon us. Take your messiah, BS, fuck off, and form your own Party since you hate Democrats so much.

1332419070310944768 2020-11-28 04:20:36 +0800 <SvDeng> @ViragoX @SilentAmuse I didn‚Äôt know Bowman had a side gig as a stand up comic. He should quit that. He sucks.
1332406363071393792 2020-11-28 03:30:06 +0800 <SvDeng> @DebarringtonH @KurtNiceHHL Well, we've been loud about it. MSM ignores our voices. And insipid Berners have their comebacks of "you're a corporate Democrat!"  Do they really think I get butt hurt with that anymore?  I will continue to be loud about BS and his asinine band of Berners.
1332405797859565572 2020-11-28 03:27:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @KurtNiceHHL As for McConnell: I still am aghast that hardly anyone in MSM has covered the shady dealings of his father in law. As for trump, well, that's too much to cover, but we know how MSM has dropped the ball about him so many times.
1332405285915389958 2020-11-28 03:25:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @KurtNiceHHL Then, with AOC, they go all gaga at how she questions GOPers in committee hearings, ignoring the fact that her questions are not hers alone. They also haven't criticized her for not passing any piece of legislation, or voting too often with the GOP.
1332404829843562496 2020-11-28 03:24:00 +0800 <SvDeng> @KurtNiceHHL They allow Berners to call Hillary "warhawk" in 2016, specifically on her vote for the invasion of Iran, yet they gloss over the fact that BS voted for regime change in Iraq when he was still in the House. They also ignore his votes for continued funding of Iraq/Afghan wars.

Yet, I don‚Äôt see him putting his money where his mouth is. Why doesn‚Äôt HE run for Flint mayor? Or MI governor?

1332398508540911616 2020-11-28 02:58:53 +0800 <SvDeng> @kerryreid @sukatra Loud, she is; meek? That's one quality she has yet to exhibit. Along with humility.
1332398288033681411 2020-11-28 02:58:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @kerryreid @sukatra And how quaint for her to assume she's "smart," when she couldn't even name the three branches of government correctly, much less called them the three CHAMBERS of government.  "Smart" entails having to think well before opening one's mouth, and not ramming a foot in it.
1332397402599383040 2020-11-28 02:54:30 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @TRW_TheMongoose @KhiveBidenBro Yup. And, I fear, this cloak of populism they put on, coupled with a heavy dose of anti-intellectualism on their part, only serves to advance their shitty, corrupted agenda.

1332047385221009409 2020-11-27 03:43:39 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @KhiveBidenBro Yet the supposedly woke Berners would rather buy Fat Fuck Moore‚Äôs bullshit than actually check facts.

1330890927318110209 2020-11-23 23:08:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @ThomB01 @admiralmpj Look at AOC. Just like BS, she talks about how the regular Joe and Jane are denied of many things, yet she lives in a posh apartment complex in DC, while some veteran legislators - Dem and GOPer alike - bunk together to save money.
1330890131079892993 2020-11-23 23:05:08 +0800 <SvDeng> @ThomB01 @admiralmpj It's typical of those who want a socialist society, so long as they're the ones in power. They talk about people owning everything, yet they enjoy all the privileges.  Makes you think: they're really not much different from Joel Osteen, are they?

And there needs to be a clear agreement: do not interject in the affairs of other states. If you‚Äôre in NY, don‚Äôt be launching any political ads in, say, PA or NE?
1328316368400343041 2020-11-16 20:37:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit @ultmtpersister The Party, in general, needs to be present 24/7/365. And it needs to have better messaging to let voters know we do not advocate socialism.  It would also help if we kick out those elements who push such notion.

1327776810373951488 2020-11-15 08:53:55 +0800 <SvDeng> The brat wants a fight, huh?  You‚Äôre gonna get one, brat.   https://t.co/fEXWkTVy6g
1327727374088228865 2020-11-15 05:37:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @EricRubenLaw Jill Stein.  No, wait... Susan Collins!  Hmmmm... Nina Turner?  OOH, OOH! AOC!
1327726037594218497 2020-11-15 05:32:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep @BernieSanders So what if Republicans refuse to do so? That shouldn‚Äôt be the issue. BS is making a fuss over something that‚Äôs moot when Biden is formally announced the winner.  As usual, he‚Äôs full of shit.
1327721945161490434 2020-11-15 05:15:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 @GmoTriguero They go to prison, as soon as they step through the gates, they‚Äôll be shitting in their pants and crying like the bitches that they are.
1327721677166403587 2020-11-15 05:14:50 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 Is this a fucking joke?  This is a tickle session compared to the initiation I got when I joined a fraternity in college.  Dough Boys, that really captures who they are. Fucking soft.
1327610684478263296 2020-11-14 21:53:47 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryzMyHmgrl @Tsiser45 If anything, he was a big reason why Biden/Harris didn‚Äôt do a lot better in MI.
1327607939121750016 2020-11-14 21:42:53 +0800 <SvDeng> Yeah, sure... now that it‚Äôs not a black man or a woman, you‚Äôre OK with working with a Democratic President?  Asshole.   https://t.co/W4NN9OXnGc
1327438642302873602 2020-11-14 10:30:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo Where, in Kentucky?
1327437923021631488 2020-11-14 10:27:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @stevedonsky @admiralmpj He‚Äôs been doing that since he‚Äôs been in Congress. Dem Party leadership needs to cut him off, along with the JD brats and the DSA.
1327437011138048000 2020-11-14 10:23:40 +0800 <SvDeng> @admiralmpj BS is really desperate to be Labor Secretary, isn‚Äôt he?
1327352150704447489 2020-11-14 04:46:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @JoyceWhiteVance According to AOC, they‚Äôre the executive, Senate, and the House.  And that‚Äôs the three chambers of government!
1327286353990709249 2020-11-14 00:25:01 +0800 <SvDeng> Hypocrite.  https://t.co/ytejjRyruQ
1327286093247606784 2020-11-14 00:23:59 +0800 <SvDeng> So, is he saying he's not OK with socialism, but fine with fascism?  https://t.co/3aLekH2rfn

They try to hide the embarrassment by feigning smugness. They think they can beat those two women in a fight when all they have are sticks, and HRC and KH already have M-60s aimed at them.  https://t.co/a62GCRIANW
1327096192120066054 2020-11-13 11:49:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @KristiNoem Show your followers that your ego is so big, it can conquer the virus and this pandemic. Hell, maybe throw a big party, just to show them Democrats you are free of any restrictions./3
1327095217477050369 2020-11-13 11:45:30 +0800 <SvDeng> @KristiNoem And when YOU get sick, don‚Äôt go to the hospital. Because you choose to go against the advice of those who have a better understanding of the virus and this pandemic. Don‚Äôt overburden the healthcare system in SD and force HC workers to care for someone who does not give a damn. /2

1327090671258398721 2020-11-13 11:27:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @RealKHiveQueenB Horseshoe theory, alive and kicking.
1327089855961116672 2020-11-13 11:24:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @RealKHiveQueenB Isn‚Äôt this one of the issues some of his minions is up in arms for?  And, like clockwork, they ignore his fuckups.
1327086034908291072 2020-11-13 11:09:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @RealKHiveQueenB He‚Äôs a pathetic excuse for a human being.
1327085289010032641 2020-11-13 11:06:03 +0800 <SvDeng> @stphnsmth777 As I go.
1327084920452288514 2020-11-13 11:04:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @RealKHiveQueenB Yup. His GOP counterparts in the House did more than he did.
1327081990366109696 2020-11-13 10:52:57 +0800 <SvDeng> @SenRonJohnson Why haven‚Äôt you called in DeJoy to testify?
1327080419423031296 2020-11-13 10:46:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @RealKHiveQueenB He didn‚Äôt do Jack shit as chair of the VA Committee, then had the audacity to claim credit for the bill passed, and that bill sucked.
1327066230692392970 2020-11-13 09:50:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @chipfranklin @Twitter Yes.
1327065588401889281 2020-11-13 09:47:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @TFerrandino @raising_hill It also helps that she shows respect towards that same woman.  Unlike this other woman who thinks she‚Äôs equal to the blonde woman and kept saying, ‚ÄúI have a plan for that.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt. And she sucks big time.
1327064265010843648 2020-11-13 09:42:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @smartplantdad @KhiveBidenBro @AOC Then again, we can apply it to our party and cut off those trying to play the Tea Party of the left.

1327063374300127235 2020-11-13 09:38:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @Ordinary1World That‚Äôs a rhetorical question, right?
1327062339007508480 2020-11-13 09:34:51 +0800 <SvDeng> This is bullshit.  Fuck Zuck.
1327019909235216388 2020-11-13 06:46:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @LaurenUnderwood Congratulations! I am so happy to hear you won!
1327004362934247425 2020-11-13 05:44:29 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Yup, so she would address several issues all at once: provide strong leadership and direction for the DNC, drive away the fauxgressives, and - should any fauxgressives stay - make them shut the hell up.
1327002808894230531 2020-11-13 05:38:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Yup. And the kind of person that will definitely post a formidable challenge to fauxgressives: a strong black woman.
1327002063537115137 2020-11-13 05:35:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 I agree, but Perez is one man. If there‚Äôs one thing obvious after these elections, it‚Äôs that Perez is not up to snuff as DNC head. I‚Äôd say, put someone there who knows how to get people to move. I recommend Stacey Abrams.
1327000711129919488 2020-11-13 05:29:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep Maybe he meant it‚Äôs the struggle to get a fourth home?  In the Hamptons? Or Martha‚Äôs Vineyard?
1326998168811302914 2020-11-13 05:19:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Same here. I won‚Äôt be voting for fauxgressives and DSA infiltrators.
1326998015589093378 2020-11-13 05:19:16 +0800 <SvDeng> @HlRodham If I feel she is the best candidate at that time, yes.
1326957805786587136 2020-11-13 02:39:29 +0800 <SvDeng> @NotMikeDitka89 Fat Fuck Moore is at it again, making people believe Biden alone can eliminate the EC.  Hey, asshole, maybe instead of fucking with the Democratic Party, help its candidates win and recapture Congress? Then the EC can be killed off by an act of Congress.
1326956966623719426 2020-11-13 02:36:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @BrittanyEnd @Halcyon270 @AgTerzo So, because YOU don't buy it, everybody else needs to fall in line behind you?  How big is this "religious left" you speak of that turned the tide against Pete? If you know that there's a homophobe problem, show me your data. Or is this from the three people you spoke with?
1326936481429118976 2020-11-13 01:14:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep He talks as if what he's saying is such a novel idea.  The worse part? His insipid worshipers will believe it is.
1326936220354703360 2020-11-13 01:13:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @mwolfers @AgTerzo  https://t.co/DsDOr3KEKN
1326935981086404611 2020-11-13 01:12:45 +0800 <SvDeng> What does he have to prove? The election results is doing it for Joe. What other evidence does he need to show?  On the other hand, where's the GOP's proof that Democrats cheated?
1326935419842342912 2020-11-13 01:10:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo  https://t.co/TJB6fkkGOp
1326934678817939457 2020-11-13 01:07:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep @BernieSanders Yeah, let's start with him!
1326934527776858112 2020-11-13 01:06:59 +0800 <SvDeng> Do you actually believe YOU are the only one who thinks that way? That THAT'S a novel idea?  STFU, you grifting bastard.
1326933757383897091 2020-11-13 01:03:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @ish_not @david_darmofal @SenWarren You know these fauxgressives are loud in their grifting. "PAY ATTENTION TO MY TANTRUMS, DEMOCRATS!"
1326933109045129221 2020-11-13 01:01:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @ish_not @david_darmofal @SenWarren Just about the same level as BS groveling to be Labor Secretary.
1326932188579966976 2020-11-13 00:57:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @volunteermom113 ANYONE in their right mind would make sure to keep his grifting ass at a distance. Like, as-far-as-the-moon distant. At least.
1326931756591747074 2020-11-13 00:55:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @HlRodham Man, I could like this a million times.
1326931158173683714 2020-11-13 00:53:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @CandiMathis @AOC  https://t.co/x0hJhVlGQz
1326930390578311169 2020-11-13 00:50:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 The Democratic Party needs to cut off the DSA. Doing so, it cuts off AOC and the JD brats.  I understand your sentiment, brother, and it's frustrating that Party leadership is letting these shiteaters run amuck. For me, I will stay and cut this cancer out.
1326924895452794891 2020-11-13 00:28:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @DevonESawa Methinks you'll also be grateful yourself. Why not include the new Xbox?
1326923790371188737 2020-11-13 00:24:19 +0800 <SvDeng> Nah, stay in the Senate. And what makes you think Joe would ask you, grifter?
1326922572521496577 2020-11-13 00:19:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @JRehling @lawhawk Oh, I know that. But even that will be blamed on Biden. Remember how Republicans blamed Obama for the Katrina response?
1326922312122294275 2020-11-13 00:18:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @SiriusProd @JRehling Yup, that's exactly their MO: claim credit for something they didn't do, pass on the blame for their own clusterfuck. Remember how some Republicans blamed Obama for the Katrina response?
1326921992247914497 2020-11-13 00:17:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @lawhawk @JRehling Trust me, GOPers in Congress will throw the blame on Biden come January.
1326921387257294850 2020-11-13 00:14:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @david_darmofal @musicman495 If we listen to left Twitter, we'd be letting our version of the Tea Party run amuck.
1326921044309970944 2020-11-13 00:13:24 +0800 <SvDeng> Agreed. And let those who live in those states take the lead. Support them. They don't need anyone out-of-state to tell them what to do. Follow the lead that the likes of Stacey Abrams have made, and fall in line behind her.
1326919816607911939 2020-11-13 00:08:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @johnoeffinger75 @SRuhle @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton They're aware of their biases, but they don't care. When one realizes these hacks have multimillion dollar contracts with their networks, it's easy to surmise why they will not go against the dictates of their corporate overlords. They won't do anything to stop their gravy train.
1326919075923161096 2020-11-13 00:05:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @kenlhobbs @SRuhle @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton I agree. If there still are Republicans who are true to their party's principles, they wouldn't vote for trump, or even for the likes of McConnell, Collins, Cornyn, Ernst, and Graham.
1326918717503102976 2020-11-13 00:04:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @lucasgw @SRuhle @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Maybe we can call them the Kombucha Party?

1326911224504836098 2020-11-12 23:34:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 I don't understand why, if we call out - and even shame - someone pushing anything that's not based on the truth, we're bullies.  Fucking ridiculous.  This is one of the reasons we got to this point. We allow the liars and the haters to get away with their shit.
1326907887906680833 2020-11-12 23:21:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 We really need to get into the habit of shaming anyone pushing lies and false narratives. Enough of putting everything under the umbrella of "free speech."  Lies aren't free speech.  Hate isn't free speech.  Gaslighting isn't free speech.
1326894671809933313 2020-11-12 22:28:36 +0800 <SvDeng> @jhadleyconrad @raising_hill Oh, definitely. Just look at the place she got to stay at in DC. Whereas even veteran legislators sometimes bunk together to save money, she had to get a pad for herself and her partner in an upscale building.  And what's happened to her district offices?
1326885133476106241 2020-11-12 21:50:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo She also said, ‚Äúif someone does something racist, does this mean he‚Äôs racist?‚Äù  NY-14, is this the best you can offer?
1326860130613342208 2020-11-12 20:11:21 +0800 <SvDeng> shit.
1326808849844727808 2020-11-12 16:47:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @RobertWelchII2 Oh, this hog likes issuing veiled threats now? Why am I not surprised that he talks like Rush, he was a Republican.  Or maybe he still is...
1326808043921825792 2020-11-12 16:44:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @HlRodham Yes. üòé
1326753393914810370 2020-11-12 13:07:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @jhadleyconrad @raising_hill Yup, the likes of Porter, Davids, Haaland, Underwood, and McBath have each done more than her, yet MSM ignores them.
1326749854664712193 2020-11-12 12:53:09 +0800 <SvDeng> When any one of you gets sick, I would bet you‚Äôd be running to the hospital for fear you got COVID. Would be good if you. Thin the stupid herd.
1326747040299225089 2020-11-12 12:41:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @DarkoneOfDamned Nope. No-talent narcissists are a no-no for me.

1326726419842551808 2020-11-12 11:20:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @raising_hill Why, of course the hypocrite will not acknowledge something he himself is guilty of.
1326720419295064070 2020-11-12 10:56:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @KhiveBidenBro Nervous, my ass. She is like trump, would lie through her teeth like it was nothing.
1326640163372544000 2020-11-12 05:37:17 +0800 <SvDeng> @notcapnamerica Talcum X is sometimes good for laughs.  He's still an asshole.  And how, exactly, is Jeffries "obsessing" with AOC?
1326634254852304896 2020-11-12 05:13:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @washingtonpost No one's stopping you. Go ahead, get your state legislature to draft articles of "SUCCESSION". Let's see how long MS can survive by itself.
1326631920613138435 2020-11-12 05:04:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 @RealKHiveQueenB This is probably how she's been getting ahead in life: ingratiate herself with others, be loud without doing her job but criticize others who actually do something, then sabotage someone to get to that position.  In short, a bullshit artist.
1326579501422276609 2020-11-12 01:36:14 +0800 <SvDeng> The governor of VT is Republican. Even if VT law says a special election be held to fill the vacancy, the governor may make an interim appointment.  He will not appoint a Dem.  An incumbent has the advantage in a reelection. Even an interim one.   https://t.co/AOeBLBWwjG

1326506836544131072 2020-11-11 20:47:29 +0800 <SvDeng> @OuakamA @BeautyTechy @blackwomenviews Same here.  I call them some other stuff, but it‚Äôs too long and too many to use. It would use up half of the character limit on Twitter.

1326353860747780096 2020-11-11 10:39:37 +0800 <SvDeng> @ReginaMichele5 @KildayMorgan She‚Äôs busy making videos of her cooking and giving makeup tips.
1326353645596794882 2020-11-11 10:38:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @raising_hill And Yang needs to keep his stupid ass out of GA politics.
1326353454848221186 2020-11-11 10:38:00 +0800 <SvDeng> @SashaBeauloux Sorry, I meant 2018, not 2016.  When will Twitter let us edit our tweets?
1326351359826857984 2020-11-11 10:29:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 Can they hurry this along?
1326344228172156929 2020-11-11 10:01:20 +0800 <SvDeng> @sharicedavids and @RepDebHaaland are also first-termers, representing working people, yet instead of backstabbing their colleagues then crying ‚Äúlook, they‚Äôre attacking me,‚Äù they actually work on legislation. If you can‚Äôt stand the heat you made for yourself, quit.
1326342695728652295 2020-11-11 09:55:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @SashaBeauloux I‚Äôve had people defending AOC‚Äôs tantrums, claiming Spanberger attacked her first. I reminded them, ‚ÄúAOC‚Äôs been attacking real Dems since 2016, and now someone pushes back at her, she cries that she‚Äôs the victim?‚Äù  That‚Äôs some fucked up shit right there.
1326319620987506690 2020-11-11 08:23:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @KhiveBidenBro What‚Äôs laughable is when blind supporters fawn over ‚Äúhow good she is in asking question.‚Äù They don‚Äôt even know those questions were drafted and finalized among her colleagues and their staff well before the committee meetings.
1326319159303688198 2020-11-11 08:21:44 +0800 <SvDeng> @awelab1956 @KhiveBidenBro She‚Äôd rather spend her time posting videos of her cooking or makeup tips than actually doing legislation.
1326318790964088834 2020-11-11 08:20:16 +0800 <SvDeng> @john71124 @KhiveBidenBro She‚Äôs pissed Spanberger called her for what she is.  Maybe it‚Äôs time AOC‚Äôs own dirty laundry gets exposed to the public.
1326318165996015628 2020-11-11 08:17:47 +0800 <SvDeng> @HlRodham @AOC No.  Not nearly enough.

1326304776783622146 2020-11-11 07:24:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @volunteermom113 At first, I thought he‚Äôd be good as DNC head. But with how Stacey Abrams made such headways in GA, I think we need her leadership there.
1326304144265719808 2020-11-11 07:22:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 I‚Äôm just exhausted. Needed that jolt.  I‚Äôm back. And I‚Äôm ready to kick some GOPer ass.
1326296909540159495 2020-11-11 06:53:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 Hmmm... since you put it that way....  https://t.co/0nO2NoY1Wc
1326295107184840710 2020-11-11 06:46:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 Let‚Äôs hope that helps soften the blow on the not-so-hardcore-trumpster GOPers when they announce he lost.
1326293582240763906 2020-11-11 06:40:06 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 Really!  Do folks at Farce News know the party‚Äôs over?
1326293394021289986 2020-11-11 06:39:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @Mojozilla_mojo Congrats.  I was going for a different job. They said no. Sucks, but at least I still have a job.
1326268098165559302 2020-11-11 04:58:50 +0800 <SvDeng> Let me spell it to you as plain as possible, @kayleighmcenany:  A mailed-in ballot post-marked November 3rd WILL NOT ARRIVE TO BE COUNTED ON NOVEMBER 3rd. Even a 5th grader can understand that.
1326256778733096962 2020-11-11 04:13:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @samm_hill @TimothySandefur Hey, as long as Jones Day gets paid, to them, "what democracy?"
1326253985804718081 2020-11-11 04:02:45 +0800 <SvDeng> Really???  Why don‚Äôt YOU hold the fake-Democratic fauxgressive Berners that Uygur supports accountable?  Tell Bernie, AOC, and the rest of the goddamn JD brats to leave the Democratic Party and form their own if they think the Democratic Party is so bad. Fuck off.
1326219499687739392 2020-11-11 01:45:43 +0800 <SvDeng> @jkfecke And I certainly agree with Jones as to the DSCC's and DCCC's failures. Abigail Spanberger touched on some of these in that teleconference with other Dem House candidates. Abrams is definitely on to something, and it may bode well for Dems to place her higher on the pecking order.
1326218845393195010 2020-11-11 01:43:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @jkfecke I've mentioned about fifty state strategies way back in 2016 to some of my friends. Howard Dean had one. Then someone by the name of Karl Rove adopted it. Go figure.
1326218225261096961 2020-11-11 01:40:39 +0800 <SvDeng> @fras99 "Is that the fly guy?"
1326217952660762624 2020-11-11 01:39:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @SheriAWilkinson No, they won't. Had they lost badly in the Senate and House races, maybe. But they knew DT would drag them down, so those campaigns tried to distance themselves. See Ernst for example. When asked about her support for DT, she wouldn't answer the question directly.
1326217283887312901 2020-11-11 01:36:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @volunteermom113 I haven't forgotten. And I'm sure they'll keep trying.  AOC's district will be dissolved. I dare her to take on a Democrat who won't take any crap from JD brats. She can't even mention Spanberger's name in her rants.
1326216839517581315 2020-11-11 01:35:09 +0800 <SvDeng> A good assessment from a conservative writer.  https://t.co/qaAkf2YbNI
1326185863420768258 2020-11-10 23:32:03 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 The entire JD brat squad should be brought down by primaries of 2022.  Then, BS in 2024.
1326184518752100352 2020-11-10 23:26:43 +0800 <SvDeng> This is awesome.

1325916316793008128 2020-11-10 05:40:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @space_mika Nowadays, I envy you.  We‚Äôre in a busy suburb of NYC. My wife is a nurse at one of the hospitals here in NJ hit bad by COVID. Today, she was pulled from her unit to a COVID one. I‚Äôm afraid for her, like last time. And angry at people who aren‚Äôt serious about this shit.
1325914708898091010 2020-11-10 05:34:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @KMP21188 @TheCorollary Someone needs to tell that brat to get out of GA‚Äôs way.
1325911092611178496 2020-11-10 05:20:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @Mojozilla_mojo They don't care about what happens to Democrats. This is part of their plan to hijack the Party.  They are our version of the Tea Party.

1325862242252943362 2020-11-10 02:06:06 +0800 <SvDeng> @RobertWelchII2 AOC thinks it's her.
1325856881580126208 2020-11-10 01:44:48 +0800 <SvDeng> The goddamn brat has declared war.  Well, then, let's give it to her!  https://t.co/tCFqcYrcuE
1325850282929090560 2020-11-10 01:18:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit @KildayMorgan She doesn't need to quit.  Her district will be dissolved anyway, and she knows it. So this "I'm quitting" drama is, once again, as always, another call for attention.
1325839734451605506 2020-11-10 00:36:40 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Yeah, you know, maybe it's a hoax that they're being spammed.  Let's call 1-800-895-4152 and ask if they really are receiving spam calls.  I have a feeling this "calling 1-800-895-4152 is spamming" is a hoax.  So, let's all call 1-800-895-4152, just to know the truth.
1325839333199261699 2020-11-10 00:35:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Fellow Democrats, please stop calling 1-800-895-4152. they're being inundated by spam calls.  Again, please don't call 1-800-895-4152. They're trying SO HARD to prevent a Biden presidency.  So, please, DO NOT CALL 1-800-895-4152. DO NOT SPAM THAT NUMBER.  üòé
1325838497513689088 2020-11-10 00:31:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Oh, darn, I offended them when I retweeted that thing and posted 1-800-895-4152?  Is it really so bad for them if people keep reposting 1-800-895-4152?  Do people REALLY SPAM 1-800-895-4152?  Maybe I should call 1-800-895-4152 again and ask if I'm bothering them...
1325824307835129857 2020-11-09 23:35:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @DespradoProfnd @WonderKing82 They're regressive, repressive, repulsive.
1325813825522847746 2020-11-09 22:53:43 +0800 <SvDeng> Please don't call 1-800-895-4152 to spam it. Please, they're having a hard time with all the spam calls.  So, please, DO NOT CALL 1-800-895-4152 to spam them.  Please.  Don't.   https://t.co/o4ipmOgjwO
1325813503790346240 2020-11-09 22:52:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 Here's the tweet from Lara Trump with that number.  Again, please, don't call that number to spam it.

1325811644639956999 2020-11-09 22:45:03 +0800 <SvDeng> @SunflowerSoul71 What's more frustrating is that this isn't about just Democrats and Republicans. I know some Democrats who don't give a shit about masks and avoiding parties and bars. I know of Republicans who are deathly afraid of the virus.
1325808659952066563 2020-11-09 22:33:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @SunflowerSoul71 My wife is a nurse. There's a surge in COVID patients in their hospital, and she's been sent to the COVID unit today. I am afraid for her and also angry. She does not need to put her life at risk again.
1325801412475949056 2020-11-09 22:04:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @AliVelshi @BernieSanders Why is this non-Democrat allowed to speak about OUR Party?  When will this asshole and his minions be held accountable for inflicting damage to the campaigns of other Democrats?  Fellow Democrats, don't you think we need to be rid of this cancer?
1325799865180413952 2020-11-09 21:58:14 +0800 <SvDeng> @boston_democrat @AliVelshi @BernieSanders If we have to, let's make this the last time we need to.  We need to work on getting his minions our of Congress. And then, work on getting him out of our Party. He's up for election again in 2024. We need to be rid of him by then.
1325799264103129089 2020-11-09 21:55:51 +0800 <SvDeng> And we will hold you accountable for the obstructionism you and your JD minions have been exacting on OUR Democratic Party.  We WILL kick ALL OF YOU OUT.
1325566658161815553 2020-11-09 06:31:33 +0800 <SvDeng> @DebarringtonH @AdamParkhomenko @RealTurkana It's getting old having to deal with the Democratic Party's version of the Tea Party.  Party leadership needs to put a stop to this. Or we end up like the GOP.
1325566077166870529 2020-11-09 06:29:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @AdamParkhomenko Adam, come on. When you do this, you only help fake-Dem Bernie and his minions in the DSA and the JD brats in their attempts to hijack the Democratic Party. Stop it. Call it for what it is, the Democrats' version of the Tea Party trying to do what TP did to the GOP.
1325564850634952704 2020-11-09 06:24:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @shuboogie @AOC Especially when MSM gives her air time to spew them.

1325561848939343875 2020-11-09 06:12:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @shuboogie @AOC Well, some Dems think SHE‚ÄôS the new face of the Party.
1325514051837943811 2020-11-09 03:02:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @shuboogie @AOC This is exactly what Jim Clyburn was talking about, someone hijacking the movement.  Now, she‚Äôs coming for the entire Party.  Fuck this shit.
1325513425481584640 2020-11-09 03:00:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo @AndrewYang @ninaturner I didn‚Äôt know Yang wanted to be a stand-up comic.  BTW, he sucks at it.
1325509617938538496 2020-11-09 02:44:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @Mel_Ankoly @volunteermom113 Yup. And as Jim Clyburn said, be careful of having the movement hijacked. That‚Äôs what BS and the JD brats are doing, hijacking the party.

1325465775126302725 2020-11-08 23:50:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @kerryreid @obbiecole @AsteadWesley He was talking about how much it costs, and why healthcare for all would bankrupt the US.  He said that in the 80s. And now he wants M4A. And tear down the ACA.
1325465230089064448 2020-11-08 23:48:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @BigDogMom3 @js_edit That‚Äôs when MSM needs to shut them up. She doesn‚Äôt represent ALL Dems. Fuck her.
1325464060142424064 2020-11-08 23:43:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @BigDogMom3 @js_edit The problem is MSM, they will always give these fuckers air time.

1325461089828679680 2020-11-08 23:32:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @kerryreid @obbiecole @AsteadWesley They can‚Äôt call it MediCAID for all, since BS disparaged it in an interview when he was Burlington Tyrant.
1325460613599027201 2020-11-08 23:30:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @BigDogMom3 @js_edit Yup, her district will be dissolved but I doubt she will disappear. She doesn‚Äôt have enough guts and savvy to take on Hakeem Jeffries. She‚Äôll end up as a talking head for MSNBC or Fox, then they‚Äôll find out she really is THAT dumb.
1325458521379442692 2020-11-08 23:21:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit Our mission for the next midterms is clear:  1. Get rid of of JD brat squad and BS.  2. Win more Senate and House seats.

1325452240958664705 2020-11-08 22:56:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @stevedonsky @LLeikus She is former CIA. She has more insight about the goings on in government than many of the brat squad. I‚Äôve been taking flak for siding with her, but she‚Äôs right. Biden may have won, but we may lose the House in 2022 if we don‚Äôt do better.

1325450310228250626 2020-11-08 22:49:14 +0800 <SvDeng> @jleetshh @LLeikus @AOC She thinks her job is to think of the grand idea and leave it to others to think about the details: how much it will cost, resources needed, etc. THAT‚ÄôS where the real work comes in. THAT‚ÄôS when she‚Äôs nowhere to be found.
1325449963388669953 2020-11-08 22:47:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @jleetshh @LLeikus @AOC Her ‚Äúquestions‚Äù were not hers alone.

Trying to pass it off as a grand old thing, yet there‚Äôs no details.

1325420620075708421 2020-11-08 20:51:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnv378 No reconciliation without justice.
1325420265292095488 2020-11-08 20:49:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @stevedonsky @lynnv378 With you on this. Those fuckers wouldn‚Äôt think twice to see us dead. I won‚Äôt go to the extent of doing it myself. But I won‚Äôt be stopping to help them out of a burning car.  You can also include Berners with them.
1325413701688709120 2020-11-08 20:23:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @MelissaB1964 I would. I‚Äôd hold it against anyone if they even voted forüçäüí©.
1325412741205594113 2020-11-08 20:19:57 +0800 <SvDeng> @JustJoshinNH I hope he does.
1325386671228133378 2020-11-08 18:36:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @stephen_hunley @Mel_Ankoly @pottercassidy I don‚Äôt understand why I need to explain that to you.

1325286878699003907 2020-11-08 11:59:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @Ange_Amene Our battle cry for 2022: get rid of the JD brats and BS.
1325272175826378752 2020-11-08 11:01:23 +0800 <SvDeng> Please listen to @TheRickWilson and @gtconway3d. DO NOT CALL 1-888-630-1776.  Again: DO NOT CALL 1-888-630-1776.
1325271372084469761 2020-11-08 10:58:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @SarahBCalif @daralebrun Yup. We made headway‚Äôs in some solid red states. They are ready to flip blue soon, if not 2022, 2024.
1325270424066928647 2020-11-08 10:54:26 +0800 <SvDeng> He is too hilarious!

1325267750504296451 2020-11-08 10:43:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @tracilaw MSM can‚Äôt play victim when they‚Äôre complicit to this whole shitshow.
1325267611886686215 2020-11-08 10:43:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @tracilaw Yeah, like it would have been nice if they cut broadcasts of his speech when he spewed lies like he did today and yesterday.

1325263742767149058 2020-11-08 10:27:53 +0800 <SvDeng> @onedankmom @msleen1970 My same exact thoughts.
1325263518623555586 2020-11-08 10:26:59 +0800 <SvDeng> @LLeikus I was hoping as well. I‚Äôll be a good soldier for now. I‚Äôll chalk this up on being caught in the euphoria of the moment.  We shall see.
1325259557128589312 2020-11-08 10:11:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @LLeikus Welp, really not surprised JB didn‚Äôt. Oh well...
1325222955530514434 2020-11-08 07:45:48 +0800 <SvDeng> Did you hear that at the back?
1325222290016055296 2020-11-08 07:43:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @ViragoX We need to be rid of them.  #TickTockJDBrats  #TickTockBS
1325220787494809602 2020-11-08 07:37:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @AshaRangappa_ Check the Russian embassy.  Or maybe he‚Äôs in Moscow now.

1325220217639866369 2020-11-08 07:34:55 +0800 <SvDeng> We needed your help, you stabbed us in the backs. We‚Äôve been suspicious of your flock since ‚Äò18. This last election proves our suspicion of your flock is spot on.  Mark your calendar: 2022 is the day you and your faux-Democratic brood exit the House.  #TickTockJDBrats
1325219282763063297 2020-11-08 07:31:13 +0800 <SvDeng> Don‚Äôt worry. 2022, you all are in our crosshairs.  #TickTockJDBrats
1325218709934395393 2020-11-08 07:28:56 +0800 <SvDeng> @ViragoX Or offering as an obstacle for us.
1325218303472754689 2020-11-08 07:27:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @raising_hill Just more proof: if Dems show up, we win.

1325192724845383680 2020-11-08 05:45:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @SilentAmuse There has to be retribution against them for all those losses.  2022.  Let's start now.

1325191862655856641 2020-11-08 05:42:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @SilentAmuse And I think the losses of Espy, Harrison, Gideon, and Jones are results of that as well.
1325191186068377600 2020-11-08 05:39:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @kylegriffin1 I hope they slammed it on his head. Hard.
1325191048864296961 2020-11-08 05:39:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 That's how it feels right now. I cried a bit, realizing our VP is a black/south Asian woman. But more than anything, relieved.  It will hit me later that there more to be done. And that we still need to be vigilant.  But now, at least, I can breath easy.
1325178564438716418 2020-11-08 04:49:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnluvseddie Yup, "no time for losers," so get lost, trumspters!
1325132596892798977 2020-11-08 01:46:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @WonderKing82 I started feeling that.  Then I saw Bernie‚Äôs tweet. And his followers‚Äô
1325130583069036544 2020-11-08 01:38:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @volunteermom113 I agree.  Get rid of the fuckers.
1325130510255861763 2020-11-08 01:38:28 +0800 <SvDeng> @PattyArquette More like 320 pounds.
1325130422360027137 2020-11-08 01:38:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @MaryLTrump Thank you for everything you did.
1325130172539023366 2020-11-08 01:37:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @Burkmc I hope not.
1325117969593208833 2020-11-08 00:48:38 +0800 <SvDeng> @stevedonsky Don‚Äôt tempt the asshole, he might just do it.
1325116932580909056 2020-11-08 00:44:30 +0800 <SvDeng> FOR FUCK‚ÄôS SAKE!  You just have to make it about you, don‚Äôt you?  Asshole!
1325115962622963713 2020-11-08 00:40:39 +0800 <SvDeng> I‚Äôm literally crying right now.  We got rid of the nightmare, and we have a female VP!
1325113735653036035 2020-11-08 00:31:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 And now the tweet storm begins.  @realDonaldTrump:  https://t.co/clw4ez6kzq
1325113580631584771 2020-11-08 00:31:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @realDonaldTrump:  You‚Äôre fired!  https://t.co/74njkcjQ9I
1325092864351752192 2020-11-07 23:08:52 +0800 <SvDeng> Are you feeling antsy about the elections?  Don‚Äôt be.  The GOP can delay this all they want. trump‚Äôs term still ends 1/20/21. If no winner is declared and sworn in that day, be ready for President Pelosi.
1324932883715416065 2020-11-07 12:33:10 +0800 <SvDeng> By the way, I never read about it, but did she ever have an inauguration?
1324932335368802304 2020-11-07 12:30:59 +0800 <SvDeng> What, the girl who said there are three CHAMBERS of government, the executive, the Senate and the House?  Pfffft... waste of time.  She can keep doing her make-up and cooking videos. Grifter junior‚Äôs gotta grift. That‚Äôs on her constituents for voting for her.

1324923342898540544 2020-11-07 11:55:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo We need to get rid of the fuckers once and for all.

1324828348103696387 2020-11-07 05:37:46 +0800 <SvDeng> @DevonESawa Exciting times!
1324818749808087042 2020-11-07 04:59:38 +0800 <SvDeng> @KonaLowell Especially those we lost by small margins.
1324818489207652352 2020-11-07 04:58:36 +0800 <SvDeng> @alroker Good luck, dear sir. I myself am dealing with the same thing. Knowing enough about you, though, you'll beat this.

1324659622389665792 2020-11-06 18:27:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @realDonaldTrump OK, let‚Äôs stop it. Right now. Even if GA stays red (it just flipped blue), Biden gets EXACTLY 270 votes with the 6 from NV.  So, yeah, let‚Äôs stop the count, NOW.
1324580216145063936 2020-11-06 13:11:47 +0800 <SvDeng> @Yazzster @anenews We can always go with Twitler. Or Orange Shitgibbon.

1324528278808518659 2020-11-06 09:45:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @MadisonKittay @BlueSteelDC And I like the fact he won‚Äôt put up with their shit.

1324340165511446530 2020-11-05 21:17:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @SassyGirlBoss So when he said he owed Hillary an apology, that‚Äôs all bullshit.

1324209215557304320 2020-11-05 12:37:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @SashaBeauloux How about beating a dead-beat socialist wannabe by a lot? In two straight primaries?
1324208702086406151 2020-11-05 12:35:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @GoldenJans According to AOC, it‚Äôs 3 CHAMBERS of government: executive, Senate, and the House.
1324208155052691457 2020-11-05 12:33:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @GoldenJans Now, Larry, and Curly.  Wait, that‚Äôs Shemp.  Darn it...

1324204577734991879 2020-11-05 12:19:08 +0800 <SvDeng> Liar. You GOPers rejected a plea to allow counting of mailed-in ballots as they came in. And now you blame the governor? Typical Republican tactic of creating a problem, then blaming Democrats for it.
1324060211510976512 2020-11-05 02:45:28 +0800 <SvDeng> Four years too late, @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe
1324012581531668482 2020-11-04 23:36:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @LLeikus @chrislongview And then maybe consider Jeh Johnson, Gary Locke, Jack Lee, Janet Napolitano, and Julian Castro. There‚Äôs a lot to choose from. If GOPers can install someone like Barrett, Dems shouldn‚Äôt reject the notion of any of these individuals in SCOTUS.

I want to learn about other people‚Äôs families, their culture, their FOOD! Whenever I heard ‚ÄúAmerica is a melting pot,‚Äù I was uneasy with it. We don‚Äôt need to be blended together. /1
1323246640636043264 2020-11-02 20:52:38 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 And this brown Asian voted for Joe Biden.
1323244892601143296 2020-11-02 20:45:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 Of course they did. They‚Äôre STILL trying to erase her.

1321942637952307201 2020-10-30 06:31:00 +0800 <SvDeng> @LesHailYes She can come to one of the hospitals here in Bergen County, NJ. I dare her to show that to any of the nurses there. Many of them tended to COVID patients. Many got infected, including my wife.
1321941920491413509 2020-10-30 06:28:08 +0800 <SvDeng> @Dknight10k No need to. You have more important things to attend to.

She‚Äôs a non-starter for me. She can stay in the Senate, for all I care. Warm that seat until a true Dem can nudge her out of the way.
1321878473187725312 2020-10-30 02:16:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @longhornfan1969 @volunteermom113 Classic example: Elizabeth Warren. Instead of calling out the misogyny Hillary had to fight, EW jumped on the ‚Äúrigged‚Äù bandwagon. Even in her failed attempt for the nomination, she tried to channel Hillary, yet fail to recognize her.

1321877383364882439 2020-10-30 02:11:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @volunteermom113 @longhornfan1969 It‚Äôs not much hatred as it is fear for men. They feel they‚Äôre being emasculated when women take charge.

We can be our own worst enemy. We need to stop thinking of the enemy‚Äôs feelings. I‚Äôm pretty sure the enemy only cares that we die.

1321243120667906049 2020-10-28 08:11:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @IntsctFeminist These people peddle power and influence. Bill-O bucked them by reaching across the aisle. Obama bucked them by getting HRC as his SOS. There were also rumors he wanted her to be his veep in ‚Äò12.
1321242312370987008 2020-10-28 08:08:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @IntsctFeminist And supported BS in ‚Äò16.

1321240464218034178 2020-10-28 08:00:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @IntsctFeminist These are almost the same people who could not fathom how a DC outsider named William Jefferson Clinton won the party nomination in ‚Äò92 and is still well loved. Those same people reveled in him being impeached.
1321240005394706435 2020-10-28 07:58:59 +0800 <SvDeng> @IntsctFeminist I use that as a term for ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù who could not accept that a black man became the party‚Äôs standard bearer.

1321238291128160257 2020-10-28 07:52:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 I placed it in a drop box at the municipal hall for the town next to ours, a 5-minute drive. When I went there to drop my ballot off, there were others. I got kinda choked up seeing people who are motivated to vote.

1321179580498169860 2020-10-28 03:58:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit It‚Äôs huge, but at this point, we don‚Äôt stop, we can‚Äôt be complacent. We need to carry on with the urgency and focus of someone coming in from behind. Beating üçäüí© and the GOP is not enough.

1320886248953827329 2020-10-27 08:33:17 +0800 <SvDeng> This is not just about winning back the White House. Or flipping the Senate blue.  This is about bringing the Republican Party to its sorry, pathetic end.  This is about destroying trump, his family, and his legacy.  Our wrath will be upon them for generations to come. /2
1320886144893177856 2020-10-27 08:32:52 +0800 <SvDeng> So, Amy Coney Barrett has been confirmed. Did we expect anything less?  Are you angrier? Good.  Channel that anger.  Because we're not done after November 3rd.  Each and every one of us must commit to showing up for each and every goddamn election. Starting this November 3rd. /1

Other freshmen legislators who came in the same time she did - like Sharice Davids - actually learned how to legislate. AOC seems more concerned with the limelight.

1320689090304638984 2020-10-26 19:29:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @chipfranklin I am a Democrat. He is as well. He is our nominee, and as such, he represents the values our Party stands for.  Also, Hillary wants her supporters to support him.

1316814227471032323 2020-10-16 02:52:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @atrupar And they still cover him. After the first few times he attacked and insulted him, there should have been a media blackout imposed on him.
1316813520256880645 2020-10-16 02:49:43 +0800 <SvDeng> @mirandayaver @richardmarx Bad enough that they pushed that no-talent reality ‚Äústar‚Äù on us. It‚Äôs worse that they practically gave him free air time in 2016 while pushing the false narrative on her emails and Benghazi.

1316736608025153537 2020-10-15 21:44:05 +0800 <SvDeng> @darylsturgis @logan48227 Exactly. I had a discussion about this with someone else the other day.

Nobody asked him about his relations with Russia, even after Hillary told practically everyone about it, and the IC knew about it.
1316487398654607360 2020-10-15 05:13:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep No one questioned BS on voting for regime change for Iraq. No one questioned his votes for continued funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No one questioned him about his ‚Äúvisit‚Äù to (stalking of) the Pope on his campaign‚Äôs dime. /2
1316486560641101824 2020-10-15 05:10:29 +0800 <SvDeng> @femalep None of them questioned BS on why he pushed for a different HC bill, undermining the one Hillary was pushing. No one asked him why he said same-sex marriage is an issue best left to each state. No one asked him about Sierra Blanca. /1

On the other hand, NBC Universal has 82 per cent of shares and Microsoft has 18 per cent shares in MSNBC."  How much more "different" can they be?
1316430789580599308 2020-10-15 01:28:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @JustJoshinNH They're still helping the asshole out, hosting his town hall. Really, NBC? Fuck you.
1316430075093540867 2020-10-15 01:26:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @MagnetoAnd @JustJoshinNH And the bullshit "falling out" between him and the adulterous pair. Really? Then they show up at Mar a Lago after he stole the election?
1316429814245531654 2020-10-15 01:25:00 +0800 <SvDeng> @JustJoshinNH I said the same thing in 2016. I still get crap for saying so. I don't care. Because no one can make a case against that assertion.

1314768224043626498 2020-10-10 11:22:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @crisisballing @GarySanchezRBW They need a pitching coach that can get their minds into controlling the game. Be pitchers, not hurlers. Keep Blake as conditioning coach for pitchers, but get a former pitcher who knows what it takes to be a big-time pitcher. /2
1314767752205348865 2020-10-10 11:20:33 +0800 <SvDeng> @crisisballing @GarySanchezRBW Goes beyond just Boone, though he has a lot to answer for. The pitching coach may be good with spin rate, but not with the mental aspect. And the hitting coach was good at hitting home runs when he played - which wasn‚Äôt even enough. /1
1314766776304119809 2020-10-10 11:16:41 +0800 <SvDeng> @lwilsonsmith @GarySanchezRBW I hope they go after Realmuto.
1314765914039111682 2020-10-10 11:13:15 +0800 <SvDeng> @jjcoop36 They kept Andujar, and now his trade value is virtually zilch. They held on to Sanchez, and he‚Äôs proving to be a bust. Instead of having another spot in the lineup, they re-signed Gardner.
1314765445464031232 2020-10-10 11:11:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @jjcoop36 They also understand that, in order to get quality, you need to give it up as well. The Yankees have always had the tendency to hold on to players for too long, sometimes putting too much stock on certain players.

1313574674962558976 2020-10-07 04:19:42 +0800 <SvDeng> Why don‚Äôt you go to the WH today, meet face to face with trump, both of you with no masks, buzz him on the cheek, hold his hand as you sit right next to him and talk to him really close. Do it with cameras from MSNBC and CNN trained on both of you on live TV. I dare you.

1308892453613842436 2020-09-24 06:14:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit @NatCo98 Yeah, it is. The end goal is to get rid of trump. And with that, I will hold off on letting my opinions know as to why it‚Äôs OK for the status quo in the party to let him to do this.
1308891369897971718 2020-09-24 06:09:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit @NatCo98 He wants to make amends?  He can start by admitting to sabotaging Hillary‚Äôs campaign.

1307420085003399168 2020-09-20 04:43:33 +0800 <SvDeng> She did not say she will vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù should a vote be put forth.
1307386518072438787 2020-09-20 02:30:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @spritopias @briebriejoy Like she‚Äôs ever done anything other than in poor taste.
1307386267303280641 2020-09-20 02:29:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @itsnotny @californiadem20 @briebriejoy Exactly. ‚ÄúClass‚Äù and that wench‚Äôs name shall never be in the same sentence.

1307335273924243456 2020-09-19 23:06:33 +0800 <SvDeng> @Purify_toast17 @reesetheone1 They were progressive in name only. If anything, they‚Äôre regressive, repressive, and most of all, repulsive.
1307334940825202689 2020-09-19 23:05:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @AgTerzo @sfpelosi I must have some Italian in me, then. My Sicilian mother-in-law must have passed it on to me by osmosis.
1307334316003909634 2020-09-19 23:02:44 +0800 <SvDeng> @esglaude Here‚Äôs an idea of how much deeper it goes, Sherlock.   https://t.co/meYoQaKkRz
1307329007961214979 2020-09-19 22:41:39 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny Well, it should be a cordial one.
1307328479281770499 2020-09-19 22:39:33 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny Good to know. I need to have a sit down with him. I need to get HIS head straight on whose heads he should be going for.
1307328145012535296 2020-09-19 22:38:13 +0800 <SvDeng> No shit, Sherlock. Or did you develop dementia and forgot how you wrote about not voting for Hillary?   https://t.co/pbrPXm6I4p
1307326768701997065 2020-09-19 22:32:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny He‚Äôs given me a reprieve for now. Though I‚Äôm still waiting for a clearer sign. Will know by next year if I‚Äôm in the clear.
1307326518599847943 2020-09-19 22:31:45 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny They‚Äôre still inserting themselves. Even saying it‚Äôs RBG‚Äôs fault for not stepping down when BHO was prez that we have this SCOTUS quandary now.
1307326178089406469 2020-09-19 22:30:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @mitchellscomet @Tsiser45 Not enough to not vote for him for a significant few.
1307325995003899905 2020-09-19 22:29:40 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny I might just be wandering those corridors, acting disinterested...
1307325603172044801 2020-09-19 22:28:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny And when they do, can they send Berners ahead of them?
1307325426243719171 2020-09-19 22:27:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @jdhattin You and me both. But their entitlement trumps everything that‚Äôs true, right, and sane.
1307325196999766017 2020-09-19 22:26:30 +0800 <SvDeng> @vetthebern With a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire.  https://t.co/CajTOUV79W
1307324917428482048 2020-09-19 22:25:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @KeepingSunny Can‚Äôt they do it now?
1307324789204414469 2020-09-19 22:24:53 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 @jdhattin You know they will be complaining. Loudly. The ranks of Karen‚Äôs will swell, and still place the blame on us Democrats.
1307324403739492353 2020-09-19 22:23:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @SachaLEnglish @Tsiser45 I look at it in simpler terms: destroy the GOP. Every single fucking one of them.
1307324027564892166 2020-09-19 22:21:51 +0800 <SvDeng> Latest fucked-up shit from Berners: ‚ÄúThis SCOTUS vacancy wouldn‚Äôt be a problem had RBG stepped down while Obama was President.‚Äù  Yeah, fuck you very much.
1307323953912967170 2020-09-19 22:21:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist They will keep trying to paint his presidency with that shitty intern. Just like they ignore BS‚Äô shitty record as a politician, and trump‚Äôs fucked-up record as a human being.
1307152937626537985 2020-09-19 11:02:00 +0800 <SvDeng> @QueenCorinda @js_edit With a goddamn baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire.  https://t.co/srPiH8v9P9
1307152065806962689 2020-09-19 10:58:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @js_edit Berners. Each and every fucking one of them. Rose Twitter. Rose McGowan. Rosario Dawson. Michael Moore.
1307100661667033093 2020-09-19 07:34:17 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist @NYAnna22 Yup. And his fucking worshippers keep insisting the primaries were rigged against him. IDIOTS! These last primaries, the rules were revised to accommodate him! AND HE STILL LOST.
1307099992570593280 2020-09-19 07:31:37 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist Because he didn‚Äôt campaign for her. He sabotaged her.
1307098688410521600 2020-09-19 07:26:26 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist And how about states like MI? Wasn‚Äôt BS the surrogate there? Why wasn‚Äôt he criticized when MI voted red? Yet she was criticized for the Crime Bill? She didn‚Äôt vote for it. She didn‚Äôt sponsor it. Yet those two men were never questioned about that.
1307098221186093061 2020-09-19 07:24:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist I still remember when he said his brother, who lived in PA, voted for trump because he was so butt hurt that she didn‚Äôt campaign enough in PA. REALLY??? He was the surrogate for that state! Isn‚Äôt that more a reflection on him that he couldn‚Äôt even get his brother to vote for her?
1307094580622393350 2020-09-19 07:10:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist And I have the list of those who threw her under the bus, sabotaged her campaign, left her to fend for herself, or left her out to dry. When we rid ourselves of the bullshit in the WH, we need to clean the Party of some trash. Especially those JD brats.
1307093937748938752 2020-09-19 07:07:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist To be clear, I will be voting for him. Because he‚Äôs the Democratic candidate, and the primary objective is to kick trump out. But I don‚Äôt forget transgressions.
1307093706776993794 2020-09-19 07:06:38 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 @HillaryFeminist And the other one claims Obama asked him not to run. Another excuse for him not to have to go up against her.
1307093191728992256 2020-09-19 07:04:36 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist Remember what he said later? ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt even a great candidate. I would have been a great candidate.‚Äù I keep my receipts.
1307091895466721282 2020-09-19 06:59:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist He was so afraid of her, he didn‚Äôt even run. Even made the excuse that she would have attacked him relentlessly. What, he can‚Äôt take that heat?
1307091561516281856 2020-09-19 06:58:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @tltwarriior No.
1307091318909407235 2020-09-19 06:57:09 +0800 <SvDeng> @thomaskaine5 Nah, it excuses him from being what he truly is: an idiot. He seems deranged because he can‚Äôt hide his idiocy anymore.
1307091060846407680 2020-09-19 06:56:08 +0800 <SvDeng> @JoJoFromJerz Because he is shit.
1307031337925316610 2020-09-19 02:58:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist Is that even a question?
1307024563860013056 2020-09-19 02:31:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @raising_hill I always knew they were, since 2016.
1307024062896627714 2020-09-19 02:29:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @DievendorfJane @raising_hill The opposing testicles in putin‚Äôs crotch.
1306984755938897927 2020-09-18 23:53:43 +0800 <SvDeng> @kylegriffin1 @KarenLynne2828 Because he didn't have the welfare of Americans at the top of his priorities. In fact, it's never been a priority of his.
1306983193829142529 2020-09-18 23:47:30 +0800 <SvDeng> @JasonMillerinDC Where's your baby mama?
1306982647781089280 2020-09-18 23:45:20 +0800 <SvDeng> @LouGarza86 That's the only one that counts.
1306982525357694977 2020-09-18 23:44:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB WOAH!
1306614181353984001 2020-09-17 23:21:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln And I hope - I REALLY hope - senior Republican politicians see this as well.
1306614028484202497 2020-09-17 23:20:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln You mentioned how tired you are of telling people to wear masks. I agree to that, and it goes beyond that. It‚Äôs having to explain to people that what this administration is doing goes against the very principles this nation is built on.
1306613665433554946 2020-09-17 23:19:08 +0800 <SvDeng> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln This is not a fight between Democrats and Republicans anymore. It‚Äôs a fight for the soul of this nation. There used to be a time not too long ago that we can disagree amicably. These days, it‚Äôs not even much about disagreeing, it‚Äôs more on who‚Äôs on the side of truth and not.
1306613185580085251 2020-09-17 23:17:13 +0800 <SvDeng> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln I understand why those in Congress are fearful to do so. I won‚Äôt express my opinion on that. But I‚Äôm thinking of senior/retired folk like Christie Todd Whitman, George Pataki, George W. Bush (maybe)?
1306612591624675328 2020-09-17 23:14:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @MichaelSteele @ProjectLincoln I agree. I ask you, dear sir, is there any way that Republican leaders who understand the damage that this administration is inflicting on our nation speak up, and be more vocal and stronger about the message, and openly and clearly endorse Joe Biden?
1306569546959126530 2020-09-17 20:23:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Flaming, pandering chickenshit, that‚Äôs what you are. @HarrisonJaime already answered your challenge, yet the traitor in the White House hasn‚Äôt released his, and YOU haven‚Äôt been demanding for it. Looking forward to you getting kicked out of the US Senate.
1306437370816999425 2020-09-17 11:38:36 +0800 <SvDeng> @SallyAlbright He won‚Äôt even acknowledge Democrats‚Äô previous attempts at UHC. Does he even know what role BS played as to why Clinton‚Äôs proposed plan was rejected in 1994?
1306435701496590336 2020-09-17 11:31:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @SallyAlbright That asshole doesn‚Äôt even know John Conyers has been introducing Medicare For All since 2003? And when BS introduced his ‚Äúversion‚Äù (basically plagiarizing Conyers), he didn‚Äôt even properly attribute Conyers for it?
1306428975233863685 2020-09-17 11:05:14 +0800 <SvDeng> @suite_executive @Frank_N_Meems @IngrahamAngle She really has none.
1306227932940177410 2020-09-16 21:46:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @MJM2K @NYAnna22 They can go get a cactus for that.
1306227580543152128 2020-09-16 21:44:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @Needtoresist @NYAnna22 Doubt he does. He‚Äôs probably just giddy getting to be on air.
1306226013790142466 2020-09-16 21:38:44 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 What‚Äôs the full name of that GOP VP? Like S. Penis?
1306210696338829312 2020-09-16 20:37:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @edabny62 @MissyDemeanor29 @SallyAlbright It‚Äôs part of her entitlement. Because that one thing doesn‚Äôt appeal to her, it‚Äôs a BIG FAIL.
1306208801582874625 2020-09-16 20:30:21 +0800 <SvDeng> @SallyAlbright Then we have Laura ‚ÄúNazi Queen‚Äù Ingraham saying trump was ‚Äúunflappable‚Äù last night. I guess ‚Äúherd mentality‚Äù is part of their lingo among Nazi heavies.
1306090787000680448 2020-09-16 12:41:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @RadioFreeTom No shit! It happened!   https://t.co/PP9Pcj5bsf

1306049553209196545 2020-09-16 09:57:33 +0800 <SvDeng> First, you insult @SpeakerPelosi. Now, you issue a half-assed apology. @CNBC, is this the kind of people you have as hosts in your network? #FireJimCramerNow
1306045580330831872 2020-09-16 09:41:46 +0800 <SvDeng> "Herd mentality"???  What a fucking idiot!
1306024097386844161 2020-09-16 08:16:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist Yup.
1306021938930888704 2020-09-16 08:07:49 +0800 <SvDeng> @lynnv378 Me, too.
1305987166351351808 2020-09-16 05:49:39 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist I still remember well who was surrogate for PA, the same person who claimed to be the better candidate than her. /3
1305986843930955778 2020-09-16 05:48:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist During those campaigns, I saw political ads from Schumer here in northern NJ. Hardly heard him mention HRC; mentioned Gillibrand more than her. And wasn't BS supposed to be the surrogate for WI? We all know how it went over there. /2
1305986239674417153 2020-09-16 05:45:58 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist It's hurt her many times. Major ways in '08 and '16. That was one was the worst, though. She won the nomination, but many in the Dem Party leadership left her out to fend for herself. We all saw how EW threw her under the bus by echoing Brazile's claim the primary was rigged. /1
1305983072832290823 2020-09-16 05:33:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @SueShar86032783 @jimcramer He can skip the apology. He's doing a lousy job of it anyway.
1305979295924445186 2020-09-16 05:18:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @Dwyanosaurus @jimcramer Not sure if he had to stoop down, he was probably just a notch or two higher.
1305978972652658688 2020-09-16 05:17:05 +0800 <SvDeng> @BBbmarsh @jimcramer Yup, it really was. Planned and rehearsed. There was not even a pause between him saying the insult and attributing trump to saying it.
1305978422565404673 2020-09-16 05:14:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @KTharase @jimcramer Nah, just resign. Half-assed apologies from a full-on ass is just not sincere.
1305978042590859271 2020-09-16 05:13:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @jimcramer YOU JUST DID, DIPSHIT.
1305973949034106884 2020-09-16 04:57:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @jimcramer He goes unchecked by the press and media - hey, aren't you part of media? How often have you called him out for that? You acknowledge it's bad, yet you proceeded to emulate him. And you keep on digging our heels in by justifying what you did. You are a travesty.
1305951812294447106 2020-09-16 03:29:10 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist Nah.  There should have been no more primaries. The Party should have declared that she deserves a rematch. That's it.
1305944650822438913 2020-09-16 03:00:42 +0800 <SvDeng> @raising_hill Jane Sanders is friends with Joe Arpaio.

1305636832093274112 2020-09-15 06:37:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @Zebop That‚Äôs why I remind Dems, follow all safety guidelines. Assume this pandemic is still at its worst. Let them fucking GOPers catch it and die.
1305612288897024000 2020-09-15 05:00:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @MarthaMcSally Your Party is the one responsible for not putting the bill passed by the House to a vote. Keep projecting, GOPer hack. Pack your bags, your stay in DC is up. #GoMarkKelly

1305509216862511104 2020-09-14 22:10:27 +0800 <SvDeng> @D4Real8645 I wonder what the Mormon church thinks of her statement?
1305508945218469889 2020-09-14 22:09:22 +0800 <SvDeng> Sure. Let‚Äôs test that ‚Äúfound to be effective and safe‚Äù experiment on Pfizer‚Äôs top-level executives and their families. If they‚Äôre so confident in it, they shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble taking it.

1305435937581789185 2020-09-14 17:19:16 +0800 <SvDeng> @LindaLeePeacock @msleen1970 I prefer he just breaths his last. Like, today would be a good day for that.
1305435346537242624 2020-09-14 17:16:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @Darcman @Maggie_Klaus They won‚Äôt. The worst part about it is, they can‚Äôt accept what the majority decided. They participate in Dem primaries, then when they lose, they throw tantrums. It‚Äôs never their fault they lose.
1305434391120957440 2020-09-14 17:13:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @dianeraucher Better if he just dies.
1305433132917760000 2020-09-14 17:08:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @Maggie_Klaus Bernie wants us to lose, period. It‚Äôs his way of saying, ‚Äúif you had me running, we would have won,‚Äù which has no factual basis at all. He thinks his success in lily-ass white VT translates to the rest of the US.

1305361118802644992 2020-09-14 12:21:57 +0800 <SvDeng> @YesSirJames Nah, he just wants a fourth house. In the Hamptons. Or Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.
1305360335445073920 2020-09-14 12:18:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @JRehling I hope he catches COVID there.

1305354042122608640 2020-09-14 11:53:50 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB Hey, I‚Äôve never attacked you. And I don‚Äôt see any reason why I should.
1305353839084810242 2020-09-14 11:53:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @VoLinxx I hate him. Period. Don‚Äôt give a shit whatever party he aligns himself with.
1305353180448993281 2020-09-14 11:50:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist The pain of 2016 will never be gone for me. We lost the opportunity to be led by the most qualified, best prepared, most knowledgeable person who could have ever been the president of this nation.
1305351207939182592 2020-09-14 11:42:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist If she got to lift herself up from such an experience, we can follow her lead. She‚Äôs still fighting for us, and I am following that lead.
1305348892725325824 2020-09-14 11:33:22 +0800 <SvDeng> @CKHollingshead @YesSirJames I actually hate him more. At least with DT, we knew who he is. BS stabbed us in the back in 2016.
1305346932957687808 2020-09-14 11:25:35 +0800 <SvDeng> @Burkmc @fv4881 That, I think, is the crux of the problem: does he have a soul?
1305345667636715524 2020-09-14 11:20:33 +0800 <SvDeng> @HillaryFeminist Yeah, I see it.
1305342734350389251 2020-09-14 11:08:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @JSapp_AR Actually, what he has are excuses for why he lost. Twice. He also knows how to sabotage campaigns. We should have learned from that last time, and how we made 2018‚Äôs Blue Wave happen.
1305340630386831367 2020-09-14 11:00:32 +0800 <SvDeng> @SallyAlbright @mitchellscomet Same for me, especially Ossoff and Harrison. Their victories can help flip the Senate. I have a strong feeling that Mark Kelly can win. Same with Sara Gideon.
1305339867140849664 2020-09-14 10:57:31 +0800 <SvDeng> @SallyAlbright She‚Äôs a Republican. That‚Äôs should answer your question.
1305339742851133442 2020-09-14 10:57:01 +0800 <SvDeng> @obbiecole They‚Äôre gonna let the ambassador be killed to have an excuse to attack Iran.
1305338923137331201 2020-09-14 10:53:45 +0800 <SvDeng> Wow, how stupid are you. Your boss is the one in the White House. Not Joe Biden. Are you really THAT stupid?

1305238775564513281 2020-09-14 04:15:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @Burkmc Indeed.

1304810102973751301 2020-09-12 23:52:25 +0800 <SvDeng> @WonderKing82 Well, it terms of getting a new contract, it was a big fail. Nike, though...
1304809020889468929 2020-09-12 23:48:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @WonderKing82 How can he be so dense? Simple google search, HIllary wasn‚Äôt in Congress then, she was FLOTUS. How dumb can some people be?
1304808484240789504 2020-09-12 23:45:59 +0800 <SvDeng> @tatn @WonderKing82 He isn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre like the opposing testicles in putin‚Äôs nether region. BS the left, DT the right.
1304808037635502080 2020-09-12 23:44:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @dasc1029 Not your fault, you seem to have followed all measures you needed to take. As for us, my wife is a nurse, took care of COVID patients, so the risk is there. But ID docs in their hospital suspected COVID was here since late last year, never detected as there were no tests.
1304807332950441984 2020-09-12 23:41:24 +0800 <SvDeng> @chipfranklin Turd.
1304806906276573184 2020-09-12 23:39:43 +0800 <SvDeng> @2RawTooReal @PenalvaCubana Yup. Media and the press made a big fuss out of nothing for months. Yet there‚Äôs nary a ripple due to the Woodward tapes. Fuck media and the press.
1304806424279740416 2020-09-12 23:37:48 +0800 <SvDeng> @dasc1029 Man, all of us who‚Äôs been affected by it needs it. Me, my wife, and son found our only through antibody tests that we had it back in April, when all three of us had some sort of symptoms, but no tests were available widely available. We‚Äôre with you, my friend.

Hey, why work your ass off if you can ride on the backs of actual working class folk and then talk over in making same folk work for you?
1304804744226107392 2020-09-12 23:31:07 +0800 <SvDeng> @TheFatGrandma @Burkmc That‚Äôs how I felt myself. 2008 was a heartbreaker, and I felt 2016 would make up for it. Obviously not. And what made it hurt more was knowing people we considered as our allies stabbed us in the back.
1304804036617605120 2020-09-12 23:28:19 +0800 <SvDeng> @dasc1029 Sending positive energy your way.

1304771289182285824 2020-09-12 21:18:11 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB I always thought it was you. It didn‚Äôt have to be said. But these wyt people forever misappropriating things to their credit is such bullshit. And when caught on their lie, they throw tantrums.
1304721302394208256 2020-09-12 17:59:33 +0800 <SvDeng> And Berners are still throwing a tantrum that their false messiah was not handed the nomination despite losing, and not make much of a fuss about the tapes.
1304720638893006848 2020-09-12 17:56:55 +0800 <SvDeng> @NYAnna22 With all the shit about the Woodward tapes, MSNBC chooses to distract us with Snowden??? Fuck you, @MSNBC!
1304718804757381120 2020-09-12 17:49:38 +0800 <SvDeng> I see more outrage directed at Bob Woodward for only letting us know about the trump tapes than the media, for not hammering trump on it. As usual, media is letting the asshole in the WH off the hook.

That‚Äôs what participating in a democratic system is all about. But what YOU and other Berners is to simply abandon the primary results and hand the loser the nomination.
1304594905570869248 2020-09-12 09:37:18 +0800 <SvDeng> @NickieBrunnhoe1 @SallyAlbright Bernie ran for the primaries - twice. He lost - twice. And, it seems, for the second time, Berners will once again refuse to accept the results, that majority of Democrat voters - under which party BS ran - said they don‚Äôt want him.
1304594536375693314 2020-09-12 09:35:50 +0800 <SvDeng> @NickieBrunnhoe1 @SallyAlbright Why do Sanderistas continue to bash Democrats? What is the point? Why do they keep sabotaging Democrats election after election unless them - and I think it‚Äôs safe to assume you, as well - want to further divide the country?
1304445809266696195 2020-09-11 23:44:51 +0800 <SvDeng> @mwolfers Don‚Äôt you?  I do.

And I agree, we wouldn‚Äôt be in a death fight with trump, because BS‚Äô campaign would be DEAD BY NOW.  BS is NOT THE NOMINEE. So, what, you‚Äôre gonna be a brat and take your toys home?  What the fuck is wrong with YOU?

1303520256917467136 2020-09-09 10:27:02 +0800 <SvDeng> @ViragoX There needs to be a rule that if the Party does not have representation in Congress - 1 in the Senate AND 1% in the House - it cannot field a presidential candidate. The same ratio at the State level.

Enough of this "running under the Democratic Party" without actually being a member of the Party.

1300759574090321920 2020-09-01 19:37:04 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @maddenifico So I told her, let‚Äôs talk about it next meeting. Meeting comes, she fired up her computer, and I saw the problem.

1300740376559525893 2020-09-01 18:20:47 +0800 <SvDeng> @PWM62 @maddenifico Those brats have no idea how it is to really struggle. To them, it‚Äôs not having the latest iPhone, missing out on the trends on IG and TikTok, having to start in a community college, working through school. ‚ÄúWhy me???‚Äù Fuck them.
1300739226372374531 2020-09-01 18:16:12 +0800 <SvDeng> @realDonaldTrump DUMB AND DUMBER!!!  Both of that is you.
1300738150453645312 2020-09-01 18:11:56 +0800 <SvDeng> @LeonaLioness6 Yes, he is. And what do we do with terrorists? Let‚Äôs do it!
1300735124791848962 2020-09-01 17:59:54 +0800 <SvDeng> @RealKHiveQueenB She‚Äôs so blind of her entitlements.

1300632594887868420 2020-09-01 11:12:29 +0800 <SvDeng> @KhiveBidenBro ‚ÄúSenator‚Äù? What the flying fuck is that??? She wasn‚Äôt even elected to that post, then she couldn‚Äôt get re-elected. That‚Äôs how shorty she is.

1300613059354996737 2020-09-01 09:54:52 +0800 <SvDeng> @mlleaimee @thereal_gunn I think he already gave up his balls. Then again, they spawn...
1300612689077641221 2020-09-01 09:53:23 +0800 <SvDeng> @mwolfers Bullshit answer, as usual. They can‚Äôt go off script. There‚Äôs really no way of having an intellectual conversation with those shiteaters because they can‚Äôt talk about anything that‚Äôs not within the lines.
1300612229113544705 2020-09-01 09:51:34 +0800 <SvDeng> @BlackOmen2021 Let‚Äôs see them. üòé
