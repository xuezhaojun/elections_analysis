1342789368407355392 2020-12-26 19:08:27 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @NKrankie My experience during lockdown - BLM and CRT was infecting many zoom lessons. I complained very strongly, got a reply from head of History he had "not heard" of CRT. However, since September I have not heard a single peep about BLM or CRT and I am watching like a hawk.
1341684406268923904 2020-12-23 17:57:44 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @MichaelYeadon3 It's Hobson's choice. If you consent then there's the freedom of choice and principle, but if you don't consent then they miss out on even more schooling.
1341683259583901696 2020-12-23 17:53:11 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @MichaelYeadon3 I have received emails requiring an online decision for testing my kids in January. Nowhere does it say what will happen if you decide that you do not give consent. I can only surmise it will mean suspension from school.
1341671758617862145 2020-12-23 17:07:28 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @MrFezziwig5 I remember the Salman Rushdie Satanic Verses affair and seeing the mussies in their white dresses &amp; sandals burning his books and threatening him. Oh how I laughed. Not laughing now.

The way the Brexit Party took all the votes in Lincolnshire for the European election was astonishing. So maybe there is hope that if the right party came along change could happen.

1326584146228097026 2020-11-12 01:54:41 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @ukhomeoffice The first duty of the government is to keep citizens safe and the country secure.

White Guilt and White Privilege being commonly used in my daughters lockdown lessons. It ought to be banned it's heaping unecessary angst on teenagers.

The whole reason for ITV is value to it's shareholders via advertising revenue not social engineering.  Maybe ITV should be given a lesson like the Co-op was.    https://t.co/H3mtZH5SNV

1301823835587653633 2020-09-04 18:06:03 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @MervusP30 Please Sir! Been on recently, John Alderton was brilliant as was Joan Sanderson.
1301804770697588737 2020-09-04 16:50:18 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @MattHancock So it's fantastic? Kids off school for 6 months. History lessons BLM indoctrination made to feel guilty. Now spaff about LGBT. There is no wonder our kids are frazzled with mental health issues with the absolute state of secondary school education.

1301788317952946176 2020-09-04 15:44:55 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @BTPMersey It is the asymmetry in the application of the law that galls people. For example, every day you can see hooligan Extinction Rebellion causing mayhem. No arrests. Same with Black Lives Matter. You do not go for the hard arrests. You only go for the easy ones.
1301549314561454080 2020-09-03 23:55:12 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @SteveLaws19 Start with schools. They are the primary way kids are getting indoctrinated. Keep an eye on what they are doing in class. Check their homework. If there is any woke crap get straight onto the school. Pester the teachers. Pester the headmaster. Don't let them get away with it.
1301206253218205697 2020-09-03 01:12:00 +0800 <iknownothingab6> @BorisJohnson @addicted2newz Mate. You can't stop dinghies. You'd never stop the Ivans.
