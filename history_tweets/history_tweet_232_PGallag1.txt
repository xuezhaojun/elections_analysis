1342989230415491072 2020-12-27 08:22:38 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm Wait a minute. The only way I can know to get off Twitter is to be ON Twitter so I can see this message to get OFF Twitter. That doesn’t make any sense. (An often heard Mark Normand Reasoning)😎😮
1342988136159309830 2020-12-27 08:18:17 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm OR... Get OFF on Twitter! 😮😎

1342459425840373760 2020-12-25 21:17:23 +0800 <PGallag1> I feel inspired to open a Patreon called “Patrick Gallagher Blues Guitar.

1336182195120205829 2020-12-08 13:33:55 +0800 <PGallag1> @sammorril I quit drinking 3 years and 4 months ago because alcohol was ruining my life. Putting COVID aside, my life has been improving ever since. 😀❤️🙏
1336180369285144576 2020-12-08 13:26:39 +0800 <PGallag1> THESE ARE MY TWEETS (as inspired by @eddiepepitone) All the little birds on Jaybird Street Love to hear the robin go tweet-tweet-tweet Rockin' robin, (tweet-tweet-tweet) For those who don’t get the joke &gt;  https://t.co/GSLhjsFqLe 😀❤️🎶🎸😎
1334296753747660801 2020-12-03 08:41:50 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone Let’s see. Tired? Yes! Weary? Sometimes! Broke? Not yet! Despondent? No! Bleeding? Not Now! Overeating? Only Thursday thru Sundays! Petulant? Indubiously! Cranky? Only at the office! Irritable? Still office! Public Tirades? Not sure! Self-sabotaging? In denial! Yes, Klantox! 😎
1334293840694554625 2020-12-03 08:30:16 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy Yes. Patheticity - “the inherent patheticness of something or someone.” 😎
1334276523885551622 2020-12-03 07:21:27 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy For straight ahead no nonsense reporting however there need only be one camera. 😀
1334276228539363329 2020-12-03 07:20:17 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy I think I solved it. There needs to be 4 cameras! 😀
1332144398809837574 2020-11-27 10:09:09 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy I get that people on Twitter like to shit on stuff. All I ask is that no one shit on my stuffing. LOL! 😎❤️🦃
1332143008725299200 2020-11-27 10:03:37 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone What I really love about Nutriflex, and I think this was the point you were really trying to get at here, is it protects you from other people killing you while at the same time the production of the product is killing other people. Fuck other people as long as my life is safe!
1332090660464324613 2020-11-27 06:35:37 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy Personally I’m enjoying the break. Every year we eat the usual prescribed ingredients the last Thursday of November because it’s a National Holiday. My question is: why am I such a Sheep that if I don’t want to celebrate it I feel I’ll be accused of being odd for saying so? 😀❤️
1332035286755401731 2020-11-27 02:55:35 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy Poor Lazarus was a hit chain gang song back in the day! 😎
1331669002486210561 2020-11-26 02:40:06 +0800 <PGallag1> @seanconroy If send him a Tweet as “at Trump” or whatever, he just might do it! 😎
1330464982375477250 2020-11-22 18:55:45 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone @eddiepepitone you had me at “completely divorced” 😀❤️🌎❤️🙏❤️🎶
1325321807289868290 2020-11-08 14:18:36 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone Go New York!!! 😎
1319171852326047745 2020-10-22 15:00:53 +0800 <PGallag1> @tedalexandro It’s just perspective. What is sacred or not to one, might be to another. 😀❤️🙏
1314369895346384896 2020-10-09 08:59:37 +0800 <PGallag1> @MikeKnoxComedy @TimJDillon Hey Jesus! I Love the shades man! 😀❤️😎🙏
1314368739937316864 2020-10-09 08:55:02 +0800 <PGallag1> @DirtyNoPants @TimJDillon Jesus is also a Redsox Fan! 😀❤️🙏
1313552691310858240 2020-10-07 02:52:20 +0800 <PGallag1> @TimJDillon The Anti Christ. 😎
1312652908920549376 2020-10-04 15:16:56 +0800 <PGallag1> @TimJDillon What fascinates me is Tim Dillon has been on the Joe Rogan Podcast 5 times in his 35 years! 😎
1312275559670591490 2020-10-03 14:17:28 +0800 <PGallag1> @TimJDillon LOL! 😀❤️🙏
1307098083000541187 2020-09-19 07:24:02 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm What? Women won’t have sex with each other? What they really mean is it’s expensive enough to get to Mars and back without having to support babies that are born on Mars also! 😎
1306728336597676033 2020-09-18 06:54:47 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm Actually it looks like just one person arguing and the other guy is just minding his own business. 😎
1305165303312244738 2020-09-13 23:23:51 +0800 <PGallag1> @nice15670047 @marknorm All jokes have a seed of Truth in them. That’s usually what makes them funny. 😀😎
1305164362936651776 2020-09-13 23:20:07 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm Mark, you obviously also take really good care of your phone! So this begs the question “who is taking really good care of you so that you can leave at 100% when you go out the door?” 😎
1305163699020345345 2020-09-13 23:17:29 +0800 <PGallag1> I Loved Dayna’s workshops. She always sends the recording in my email. 😀❤️🙏  https://t.co/sEPip3u8yC
1304732634556387329 2020-09-12 18:44:35 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone I like mango sorbet and chocolate cake! 😀😎
1304732286487793666 2020-09-12 18:43:12 +0800 <PGallag1> Twitter is a great social media place! It’s great to be able to shout out something like “hey everybody pay attention to me!” But in the privacy of your own home. 😎😀
1304731848782872577 2020-09-12 18:41:28 +0800 <PGallag1> @marknorm In the words of the famous Mork “Humor! Har Har!” 😎
1303133075908562946 2020-09-08 08:48:30 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone Death by strangulation or by having a metal beam take off your head is a few other ways that I would like to avoid as a means of death. So yes, death by hurricane. Much better! 😎
1303131833023057920 2020-09-08 08:43:34 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone @allthingscomedy The Buddha 😀❤️🙏
1302718582581796865 2020-09-07 05:21:28 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone Eddie I Love these “signs things aren’t going well” Tweets! They’re so inspiring brother! Much Love and Peace to you! 😀❤️🙏
1302717316787040257 2020-09-07 05:16:26 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone You’re house throws you out by a poltergeist force and drowns you in a nearby puddle!  You can no longer use your credit/debit card because the government mandates you get a chip in your forehead and you starve to death holding out! You can’t get a date because you’re homeless!
1302715616898449410 2020-09-07 05:09:41 +0800 <PGallag1> @tedalexandro You’re welcome Ted. 😀
1302588324796944389 2020-09-06 20:43:52 +0800 <PGallag1> I love my life. I love my life just the way it is without any need to improve it in order for me to love it. That doesn’t mean that it doesn’t need to be improved however; quite the contrary. There’s still a lot that I needs to improve. Noneed to improve it in order to love it.
1302435899628810240 2020-09-06 10:38:11 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone As an everyday person I live mostly near the fridge and not so much the fringe really. 😎
1302435235506905088 2020-09-06 10:35:32 +0800 <PGallag1> @tedalexandro Really funny show Ted. It’s a don’t miss show kind of a show! 😀😎🤣
1302411895836614656 2020-09-06 09:02:48 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone @tedalexandro @YouTube So far the funniest bit was the game of chips and chocolate with his wife at 7minutes! So hilarious. I play that same game with myself. 😀😎🤣
1302410997039345666 2020-09-06 08:59:13 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone Come back to the present moment. 😀❤️🙏
1302051004981096450 2020-09-05 09:08:45 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone @stevenfeinartz Love the piano and violin music. I thought a David Gilmore Guitar lead at the end however would have been a nice finishing touch on it though. Maybe next time! 😀❤️🎸
1302049876956639234 2020-09-05 09:04:16 +0800 <PGallag1> The slang word “Thirsty” and what it means! 😀❤️🤣  https://t.co/xVPuR8AbhW
1302049586551324672 2020-09-05 09:03:07 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone @tedalexandro @YouTube Yo! I am Checking IT OUT BRO! 😀❤️🤣
1302038078840885249 2020-09-05 08:17:23 +0800 <PGallag1> @Laurie_Holden Sorry for your loss dear Laurie. I hope you can sense them both are with you always in your heart. 😀❤️🙏
1301017968932007936 2020-09-02 12:43:50 +0800 <PGallag1> @eddiepepitone You’re parents who are 79 are the last generation to have money enough to leave you an inheritance and they text you to tell you that they cut you out of their Will because you never amounted to anything in life yourself! 😎
