1328436316363755520 2020-11-17 04:34:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I agree 100%. Obama and Clinton have ZERO class, poise, and polish. Can you say "bitches" boys and girls?
1328435659846127617 2020-11-17 04:31:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @elijahwood @RealCandaceO No it doesn't but it's an essential trait. They call it the "Greatest Generation" for a reason. If a lot of today's men tried to fight that war, we would be speaking German. Those men, and others like them that followed, are the reason you can spout shit without fear of reprisal.
1328413324581744642 2020-11-17 03:03:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ClaraJeffery @jack Raise your hand if you're in favor of censorship. Yes, you. It's like TV. If you don't like it don't watch.
1328409137882025986 2020-11-17 02:46:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AOC So you either want to stiff the universities &amp; colleges, or stick me with the bill. Sorry, I'm not gonna play. My daughter graduated in 2018, without debt. So piss off with your socialism.

1328393409023913986 2020-11-17 01:44:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He got robbed, and he's pissed. Do you really believe Biden got more votes than Obama without a real campaign? Why didn't the Dems flip multiple congressional seats? Have some more Kool-Aid.

1328030028236468224 2020-11-16 01:40:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @PeteButtigieg So your stance on ANTIFA &amp; BLM? Let me guess- just thoughts. Typical left hypocrisy. Fix your own shithole first, then worry about the rest of the country.
1327699729396994054 2020-11-15 03:47:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JeffFlake Voter fraud is not just a conspiracy theory. The evidence is there. Your TDS clouds your vision. How does the GOP pick up house seats if so many voted Democrat? Biden getting more votes than Obama? Without any substantial campaign? Please explain to us.
1327644087827238914 2020-11-15 00:06:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wow. I never heard of a guy doing that before.

We've seen proof that Slick Willie went to Epstein's pleasure island, on his private jet. President Trump merely went to some of the same social events.

We are the very reason you can spout stupid shit without fear of punishment. Trust me, after helping the Cuban refugees I saw and heard how bad it can be. A man told me he was imprisoned simply for criticizing Castro. No trial.

1327357100314521606 2020-11-14 05:06:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KatTimpf Sorry, Kat. You folks deserted me first. What's the difference between Fox and CNN? That's what I say, what's the difference.
1327336684623720449 2020-11-14 03:45:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Ah, the race card. When facts and logic are against you, it's the only play.
1327336258415288329 2020-11-14 03:43:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MartinHeinrich Wrong on so many levels. "Fair and square?" Maybe on your planet. More votes than Obama? No flipping seats? Obits of people who voted? The security threat is Biden, bought and paid for by the Chinese. You're delusional.

1326501871310282752 2020-11-11 20:27:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So all those people who voted for Biden DIDN'T vote for congressional seats????ü§î
1326463850313560064 2020-11-11 17:56:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FoxNews In case you were wondering why your ratings took a "CNN," I'm one of those who stopped watching after your election night coverage.
1326273692968611843 2020-11-11 05:21:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Your eight-year-old probably voted.

1326156703398850561 2020-11-10 21:36:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> POTUS is, and always has been, a white-collar brawler. Gotta love it.
1325888617596776450 2020-11-10 03:50:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @cov_Gretchen I ran out of room. The Hellcat is a decent gun, but the Sig shoots better, and comes with night sights. I switched from a Glock 43 to the 365XL. Love the flat triggers.
1325888138875637765 2020-11-10 03:49:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @cov_Gretchen I'm an NRA certified pistol instructor (and retired LE), and worked the last five years at an indoor pistol range. Get the Sig Sauer P365. It's superior to the Hellcat. I did a survey (with the two rental guns) with some customers. Shot side by side, 11 of 12 preferred the Sig.
1325778980486733824 2020-11-09 20:35:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Swamp Creatures hang tight together.
1325771153323986947 2020-11-09 20:04:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @marklevinshow Please don't use "journalist" and "Chris Wallace" in the same sentence.
1325770583980826625 2020-11-09 20:01:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can you say "failed candidate," boys and girls? Romney is just another swamp creature.
1325770221026734080 2020-11-09 20:00:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Another Swamp Creature.
1325769836878827526 2020-11-09 19:58:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CondoleezzaRice You mean like Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, and Nadler, et. al, have over the last four years? I'm sorry, I don't know the words to Kumbaya, or whatever it is.
1325765110690942976 2020-11-09 19:40:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @EDS_1979 @catturd2 What planet are you on? If that were true, the riots in the US would be starting, not stopping. Connect the dots.
1325764584838471681 2020-11-09 19:38:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 When I voted at 3:PM in Eastern PA, I heard an election worker tell a voter they were not even counting on election day.
1325476346735304705 2020-11-09 00:32:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Because he didn't lose.
1325476184675790853 2020-11-09 00:32:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AOC Stalin and Mao would be so proud of you.
1325471689279467522 2020-11-09 00:14:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> At least when you get robbed at gunpoint in NYC, it's obvious, and plain to see; you have no doubt. The election is another story.
1325466170758213632 2020-11-08 23:52:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets It might be difficult at first, but maybe what a lot of others are doing- go to Parler. I'm going to sign up today.

1325437043367940099 2020-11-08 21:56:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FoxNews You were absolutely horrible. I had to check; I thought I got CNN by mistake. Showing POTUS with a lead in a state, and a checkmark by Biden's name? I'm done. CNN, FNN, same crap.
1325413081351065602 2020-11-08 20:21:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Done. Period.
1324361341361131520 2020-11-05 22:42:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Touched a nerve?
1324360151021834240 2020-11-05 22:37:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Even Fox is playing along. Checking wind direction?
1324101249885786115 2020-11-05 05:28:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods I voted in Monroe County, PA yesterday at 3:00 PM. I overheard an election official tell a woman they were not counting the votes today (Tuesday). They decided ahead of time they were not counting votes on Election Day. WTF???
1324100411368898561 2020-11-05 05:25:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dbongino I voted in PA yesterday at 1500 hrs. I overheard an election worker tell a woman they weren't even counting votes today (Tuesday). WTF?
1323731336063078401 2020-11-04 04:58:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen, brother.
1323708323628277766 2020-11-04 03:27:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> When one has absolutely no facts, the only recourse is insults.
1323703422554640389 2020-11-04 03:07:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Threw the ruck in my truck before I left to vote. I've never seen a line like this (Eastern PA).
1323702857762328577 2020-11-04 03:05:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brianstelter Imagine one of the conservatives taking millions from a foreign interest. I know Biden said he never took a penny. I believe him. It went the family laundry business. Hunter's Wash &amp; Fold.
1323417513917599748 2020-11-03 08:11:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jimgolby @JoeBiden Just one question, Jim. Are you smoking it, or taking it in the arm?
1323416264497340422 2020-11-03 08:06:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Being a 20 year vet, it hurts to hear one of our brothers struggling. Each and every one of you is in my prayers. Vet lives matter, in my opinion, the most. Without vets we would not have this great nation.
1323226708967886850 2020-11-02 19:33:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The strategy of suppression and false reporting? Yeah, that will produce low numbers.
1323226099283857409 2020-11-02 19:31:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @markknoller The same flavor as Joe when we see all his off-shore accounts, and the origins of all transactions. I believe Biden when he said he didn't take any money from foreign interests. That was where Hunter came in. He took the money, laundering it for daddy. SHOW ME THE MONEY!
1323224374904848386 2020-11-02 19:24:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KamalaHarris And everyone is entitled, and shouldn't have to work for it, right? The one who doesn't do squat is entitled to what the hard-worker earns? MERIT, not ENTITLEMENT.
1323062492894023680 2020-11-02 08:40:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Molon labe.
1322941046314119169 2020-11-02 00:38:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SarahR_82 I switched from beer or wine to scotch. Praise Jesus, I've  been healed!
1322940442296668165 2020-11-02 00:35:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Mayor Pete is the typical Democrat. He can't fix his shithole city, but has plenty of advice for how to fix the country. And believe me, South Bend makes NYC look the Garden of Eden.

1322256216450605063 2020-10-31 03:17:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KimStrassel Whenever they say, "Appears to be," it's CYA when it turns out to be patently false.

1322254530227089408 2020-10-31 03:10:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ABC What's the breakdown? How many Red states and how many Blue states?
1322248556032462849 2020-10-31 02:46:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @USAA Screw the NFL. They also support BLM. I'm a 20 year vet, and I quit watching after 40 years.

1321584583138283525 2020-10-29 06:48:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JeffFlake Put country over party? I agree 100%. That's why I'm voting Trump. I don't give a rat's ass what he tweets, he's doing the job. I don't care what my plumber tweets as long as he does the job. You sound like a typical career political hack.
1321581978815254529 2020-10-29 06:37:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JonAnzalone @Ter51850340 @HumanTackboard @chefjclark Suppression? Because they couldn't make the time? Hardly. Everyone knows when election day is. I wouldn't vote by mail lest some Biden supporting USPS worker decides to put my ballot in a dumpster or ditch. It's happened.
1321580797669892106 2020-10-29 06:33:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Election Day and Tax Day (that's April 15th) are government deadlines set by law. Did that clear it up? And for the record, I have paid taxes every year. Even the 20 years I spent active duty, when they knew what they were paying me.
1321577298336849921 2020-10-29 06:19:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Insurrection is more like it.
1321577020170686464 2020-10-29 06:18:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @HumanTackboard @chefjclark When they don't arrive in time. Election day has been set for years, and people have had months to get their ballots, then mail them. Pretty simple, really. Like trying to vote on Wednesday in 2016.
1321546308637904901 2020-10-29 04:16:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jaketapper @MilesTaylorUSA I'd rather see a piece on a certain former naval officer. But I'm sure you and the rest of CNN people have the blinders on. You have the nerve to call yourself a journalist. You're nothing but a lying hack, spewing propaganda for the DNC bosses. No wonder your network is failing.

1321141151475343362 2020-10-28 01:26:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ewarren Please explain how the SCOTUS seat was "stolen." When you do, make sure you quote chapter and verse of the law(s) violated. ACB was nominated by the sitting president, and confirmed by a majority of sitting senators. The constitution places no time or date constraints.

1318987360017747971 2020-10-22 02:47:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So are Biden's beliefs about 'racial harmony.'

1318182458916020224 2020-10-19 21:29:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They're not. They're voting for Harris.
1317947265894449153 2020-10-19 05:54:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> If he's just awake, he's working harder.

1317926055294980102 2020-10-19 04:30:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yeah, but doesn't Ice Cube know men aren't supposed to hit girls?
1317925631875780609 2020-10-19 04:28:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SpeakerPelosi Aren't you clever. Won't clean up "elephant dumpings." I'm not surprised, you won't even clean up the human "dumpings" from the sidewalks of your own city. You have turned it into, literally, a "shithole."

1317884435350622210 2020-10-19 01:45:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Probably just as much as Twitter and Facebook. Same thing.

1317883319506305025 2020-10-19 01:40:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RBReich Here's what you do- click your heels three times... Wait, don't do it. That takes you back to reality. You're living in a fantasy. Stay there. Or maybe hitch a ride with Bruce.
1317868548220461062 2020-10-19 00:42:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Already happening in PA. Although I have to give Governor Wolf credit, he had the foresight to start a few weeks ago, so he doesn't have to do as much of a spike as get closer to election day.

The track fugitives, serve warrants, and provide judicial security. Don't let Hollywood fool you. Tear apart the FBI and rebuild it.
1317446963818860544 2020-10-17 20:46:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Galdly.

1317415918142738432 2020-10-17 18:43:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Let's stop pretending. It's not journalism, it's a four, soon to eight-year smear campaign.

1317217863841779713 2020-10-17 05:36:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup, and Cardi B is in the back of that class. Couldn't spell cat....
1317211640245485569 2020-10-17 05:11:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jack So was blocking some of my political opinion tweets while you let the leader of a terrorist country slide on his threatening tweets.
1317211003420086272 2020-10-17 05:09:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Several times since 2016 I've offered to help them pack. No takers.
1317200620911267843 2020-10-17 04:27:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Scaramucci Nothing about the eight years of rampant corruption by his predecessor. At least Nixon paid for the campaign spying himself instead Obama using  taxpayer's money. KKK Biden is one of the most corrupt in US history. All you have on Trump is insults.
1317190252663025664 2020-10-17 03:46:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @drumdork1952 @RealJamesWoods Perhaps you need to buy a copy of "English for Dummies" and have someone read it to you.
1317189813120937989 2020-10-17 03:44:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @sherrynola @RealJamesWoods It's amazing you see his tweets at all, with Jack's merry band supressing opposing views.
1317188757544730625 2020-10-17 03:40:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I think so. Get Obama's speech writers in there too.
1317167837497229320 2020-10-17 02:17:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Twitter Jack must have forgot something important- The NY Post buys ink by the barrel, and we still read the paper.
1317167520068079617 2020-10-17 02:16:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What career? Who is this girl?
1317166808424681472 2020-10-17 02:13:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's on the pillow, Hunter. Look at the photo!
1317166507433054213 2020-10-17 02:12:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MittRomney You failed and put us through four more years of Obama. STFU, and formally join your fellow Democrats.
1317153481401184256 2020-10-17 01:20:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's SO clever. Too bad mommy can't put it on the fridge.
1317087244583374849 2020-10-16 20:57:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So why am I getting censored?
1317086658127331328 2020-10-16 20:55:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I voted for 'Nessie' because of the bubbles.
1317080570040561665 2020-10-16 20:30:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Vijaya You are still censoring individuals. I couldn't even tweet that I was being censored. You allow the Iranian leader to post terroristic threats, but I can't criticize a politician. I'm going to write to my senator.
1316918991022161920 2020-10-16 09:48:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Not even close.

1316474363961634818 2020-10-15 04:22:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Simple. Twitter is a DNC platform. That's why I retweet the crap out of good stuff. Spread it fast.

1316425070273867777 2020-10-15 01:06:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> ACB is a judicial rock star.

1316423886418870273 2020-10-15 01:01:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> How many years did he work with/for Comey and McCabe?
1316411608994807812 2020-10-15 00:12:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The only thing Mark Cuban truly loves has pictures of dead presidents on it.  China is merely a source of it.
1316411028847108096 2020-10-15 00:10:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> At least 3.5 million, and that's what they found. God knows how much more they got.
1316410588365553665 2020-10-15 00:08:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's no bulletin. How fit is the real candidate, Kamala Harris?
1316409697218498565 2020-10-15 00:05:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> His lips are moving.
1316409303318888450 2020-10-15 00:03:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Sounds like they didn't get the story approved by the DNC before publication.
1316403848483942400 2020-10-14 23:41:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That doesn't mean they won't try.

1316401949361700864 2020-10-14 23:34:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I said this before, who needs to campaign when you have ballot-harvesting minions across the country?

1316373643874754560 2020-10-14 21:41:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Judge Coney-Barrett is a professor in front of a class of fourth graders.
1316372466416209920 2020-10-14 21:37:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> To quote the famous greenskeeper Carl (Bill Murray)- "To the be-Jesus belt."
1316371708882845696 2020-10-14 21:34:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kyledcheney But then there's that little matter of the 3.5 million. You can't move that much money without a paper trail. They found it. Caught.
1316171000615231488 2020-10-14 08:16:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> In the eyes of the left? No. Two sets of rules. This passed ridiculous on the way to ludicrous. What they're really saying is "We got nothing." Trump nominated a woman and killed their hole card- The decades-old sexual assault allegation.
1316159287878725632 2020-10-14 07:30:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @chrislhayes Are you smoking it, or taking it in the arm? It's your Democrat state governors responsible for the COVID deaths. Look at the highest numbers. Dem governors. Governor Wolf got caught inflating the death count. And let's not forget Coumo. His order can be seen online.
1316157823160549376 2020-10-14 07:24:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Only to be regurgitated because of the rancid taste.
1316157584747962370 2020-10-14 07:23:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KamalaHarris The Republicans are trying to speed up Judge Barrett's confirmation? You say that like you aren't deliberately trying to stall it. This is all in accordance with the constitution. So it's not going your way. Deal with it. Maybe try holding a PC. That would be new.
1316156404659630080 2020-10-14 07:18:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CoryBooker Sexual preference? That's all you have? A commonly used, and accepted term? Wow. You really are desperate. And painfully transparent. Pathetic.
1316153112688766983 2020-10-14 07:05:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Demote the chief justice. ACB deserves that seat.
1316148121005625362 2020-10-14 06:45:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> But Biden is a Democrat. It's  OK for them.
1316147556943097857 2020-10-14 06:43:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She is a judicial rock star. We use "stud" to describe a man, what is the equivalent term for a woman? She defines it.
1316142618179497989 2020-10-14 06:23:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> TDS does that. Classic symptoms.
1316130168310820865 2020-10-14 05:34:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The degree of difficulty is through the roof because Maize doesn't even know where she's going. Hard to believe she and Tulsi Gabbard are from the same state. Real head-scratcher. Major Gabbard is a class act.
1316129558677123073 2020-10-14 05:31:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Farts &amp; Crafts?
1316129158620217344 2020-10-14 05:30:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> True, but they don't set the bar very high. ACB would trip over it. They're really stupid to start with, then Biden totally wrecks the curve.
1316128576069160962 2020-10-14 05:27:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods Where's "All of the above?" This thing is like trying to pick a favorite German beer, or classic rock album.
1316128068067635200 2020-10-14 05:25:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Go figure. But ANTIFA &amp; BLM have free reign. Hey Twitter! You going to ban me too?
1316118122676486144 2020-10-14 04:46:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I always say the liberals/Dems don't have any facts, only insults.  https://t.co/YvmnUoTOyD
1316117681175699458 2020-10-14 04:44:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> No way Biden can top that. That was his "A game." He will need at least a week to recover from the effort.
1316117317172985857 2020-10-14 04:43:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Aye! Aye! For the love of God, AYE!
1316117129918320642 2020-10-14 04:42:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amateur versus professional. ACB is making this look easy. Of course the Dems, in lock-step will vote against her.
1316116347882008578 2020-10-14 04:39:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Business as usual.
1316116136979816452 2020-10-14 04:38:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Good riddance.
1316108571340353537 2020-10-14 04:08:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Only McCain (RIP, Senator).
1316107900805427200 2020-10-14 04:05:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He needs to go to the store and pick up a can of "Man." A case of it, even.
1316107454334357504 2020-10-14 04:04:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She's the real deal. A judicial rock star.
1316107237253959681 2020-10-14 04:03:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Nice. This is why I follow you.
1316106919229173762 2020-10-14 04:01:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Another lie. Go figure.
1316106632997277700 2020-10-14 04:00:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Without all the cemetery polling complete, too.
1316106367078408193 2020-10-14 03:59:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @McAdooGordon And if she was all dressed up, you would say she's trying to use her sexuality. Admit it. You don't like her solely because she's Trump's nominee, and you have to dig to find a reason. You dug deep, but keep going.
1316105565991559169 2020-10-14 03:56:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MittRomney Who cares? You're the typical career hack-politician. You're no different than Biden. Why don't you just come out of the closet and join the Democratic Party? That's where you belong.
1316103148809916417 2020-10-14 03:46:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He's running for cover.
1316091431812030469 2020-10-14 03:00:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dcexaminer @amyklobuchar That's in the same category as "strenuously object."
1316091170234261505 2020-10-14 02:59:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jonathanalter Of course. The universities and colleges are overflowing with liberals indoctrinating our young people.
1316090813798125569 2020-10-14 02:57:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Jim_Jordan Wray is just Comey 2.0, and needs to go. Clean house and bring in an outsider to run the bureau. Maybe like a former US Attorney. Famous But Incompetent.
1316086674489847808 2020-10-14 02:41:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Nope. They knew what they signed up for.
1316086483648942081 2020-10-14 02:40:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CarterBays Did you miss the part about her saying she doesn't believe in changing existing laws? That it is not the function of the court? You must be watching the CNN edited broadcast.
1316077656090308611 2020-10-14 02:05:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kylegriffin1 You're an idiot, just looking for something to whine about. You are what's wrong with this country. Don't like the term? Don't use it. It's not targeted at ANY class of people. Get over it.
1316076674799341568 2020-10-14 02:01:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Well I don't regret just telling her she's a hypocritical moron.
1316076489687871494 2020-10-14 02:01:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Won? Only with 110% turnout of the cemetery precincts.
1316076285274329090 2020-10-14 02:00:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @clairecmc The line is long because of the Democrat use of COVID as a political weapon, drumming up hysteria and blaming it on Trump. They're 'social distancing.' And no, suppression is when they're not allowed to be in that line. Hypocritical moron.
1316075232726220801 2020-10-14 01:56:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Why does she suck? Give us fact-based reasons. As a retired detective, I listen to all facts, pro or con. Facts are stubborn things. Want to share?
1316042260820168705 2020-10-13 23:45:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @vanitaguptaCR So Kathryn Mizelle hasn't tried a case since bar admission? Before SCOTUS, the only bench Obama appointee Justice Kagan sat on was in a park. Hypocrite.
1316007703475613698 2020-10-13 21:27:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> üëã ABSOLUTELY.
1316007063936475137 2020-10-13 21:25:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> For decades we have called CA the "Cereal State." It's full of fruits, flakes, and nuts. Here's proof.
1316006678790373377 2020-10-13 21:23:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Astonishing? Hardly. PA Governor Wolf was already caught inflating the death count, and our daily 'new case report' numbers are steadily climbing as we get closer to election day. The Dems made COVID a political weapon.
1316005769159102470 2020-10-13 21:20:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I think Joe is a closet "Grand Exalted Cyclops," or whatever those idiots call the KKK executives.
1316005230388150273 2020-10-13 21:17:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can you say "Fast &amp; Furious," boys and girls?
1316005027522187264 2020-10-13 21:17:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @EricHolder Way too late for you to weigh in on anything. The way you lie, well I think "Fast &amp; Furious" describes it.
1315852084705726467 2020-10-13 11:09:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Acosta Although it's apparently a foreign concept to you, check your facts. No mask mandate in FL. What a hypocritical, sanctimonious, lying hack you are. Shame on you for pretending to be a real journalist. Moron.
1315851324211302400 2020-10-13 11:06:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What Chuck means- "I got nothing." Custer would have said Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull need to recuse themselves too.
1315850781615099904 2020-10-13 11:04:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure mommy is proud of your little art work. Too bad she can't hang it on the fridge. Why don't you try a factual argument instead of fourth-grade insults? Simple. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO FACTS. Only juvenile insults. Thankfully, judging from this, you're not old enough to vote.
1315849737757691904 2020-10-13 10:59:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Kevinliptakcnn He was nominated again for another one, you moron. Try to keep up.
1315849389336821760 2020-10-13 10:58:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets @CLWAL02 @ptsdusa @WarriorsHeart22 God bless you, Gretchen.
1315849219815673856 2020-10-13 10:57:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Easy to do from a $200,000 car.
1315848105485635584 2020-10-13 10:53:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> When they quote RBG's dying wish, why do they never mention her objection to "court packing?"
1315847664664182784 2020-10-13 10:51:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> 2020=1984.
1315691502568443904 2020-10-13 00:31:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dbongino I guess someone told them all the Confederate statues they pulled down were registered Democrats.
1315690660649984000 2020-10-13 00:27:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Well it least they got the party right this time. I'm sure they didn't realize all those Confederate generals were REGISTERED DEMOCRATS.
1315650539267469312 2020-10-12 21:48:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Far from it. Where have you gone, Larry, Magic and Michael?
1315650242981789699 2020-10-12 21:47:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He's just Comey 2.0.
1315454552708177921 2020-10-12 08:49:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> With the character limit, you need at least a dozen tweets for your list. That's just a start.
1315454287913287683 2020-10-12 08:48:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We have your six, Gretchen.
1315454121344929792 2020-10-12 08:47:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Not constitutional? Maybe you should read it again, or maybe have Jill read it to you. This has been done 29 times before. You are truly unfit. POTUS is doing what 'We, the people' elected him to do. Deal with it, racist.
1315448462826180608 2020-10-12 08:25:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Way to go, Gretchen!
1315448138002554882 2020-10-12 08:24:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Or the phony "war hero."
1315447777023995909 2020-10-12 08:22:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Pravda. They're just another DNC funded media outlet,  disguised as a "forum."
1315297946737532930 2020-10-11 22:27:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Congratulations on a great job. I'll say it again, you are the vet's angel.
1315297401901649921 2020-10-11 22:25:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jasondashbailey @normmacdonald Show us the data. Civics lesson- The state governors have the responsibility for what happens in their states. That's why the Dem run states are the worst, although Wolf in PA got caught inflating the death count.
1315284648730284033 2020-10-11 21:34:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @yayo515 @FunnestBestest @mezzalla @PhilletMiGnonn @catturd2 That's really funny, coming from a liberal. We have video of your people speaking to back up our positions. They do so many 180 turns it makes one's head spin. A nice one- Harris calling Biden a racist (one of the few she got right).
1315283398215307264 2020-10-11 21:29:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DanRather You said 'for decades,' then cite ONE example. No wonder you're in 'Media Siberia.' Washed up hack.
1315282678225219584 2020-10-11 21:26:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> My mom always said "You have to be alive to complain." Doing well.
1315282134647570434 2020-10-11 21:24:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> TDS.... Still no cure.
1315125518946140160 2020-10-11 11:02:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> God bless you and keep you, Gretchen. I'm sure your father is smiling as he watches over you.
1315125027403108353 2020-10-11 11:00:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Helene731 You are insane. You have lost all touch with reality. Worst case of TDS so far.
1315107514258726912 2020-10-11 09:50:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wolf's daily new case report totals keep going up.
1315107239817031680 2020-10-11 09:49:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Awesome! Please thank him for his service.
1315106993334616065 2020-10-11 09:48:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Joe Biden isn't even sure who Joe Biden is.
1315013854347309057 2020-10-11 03:38:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JohnBrennan So we're just a little scared, John? Let me guess- Those hand-written notes were forged.ü§£
1315013586662678531 2020-10-11 03:37:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JohnBrennan Hard to think of an agency head, who so abused his authority purely for political gain, not going to jail.
1314975281120186368 2020-10-11 01:05:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JohnBrennan Imagine how our government would be if the CIA chief didn't participate in an attempted coup.
1314975028669276167 2020-10-11 01:04:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Galactically stupid. And he obviously thinks we are. He's a moron.
1314974771873017856 2020-10-11 01:03:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> SO glad I'm sitting down.
1314974481656557569 2020-10-11 01:02:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wolf raised the PA new case count up to 1700 today. The closer we get to election day, the higher it goes. And we have the mask mandate.
1314973988121083916 2020-10-11 01:00:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen, brother.
1314973878679146496 2020-10-11 00:59:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So 3.5 million for Hunter wasn't enough?
1314973563275948033 2020-10-11 00:58:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Love the low-ridin' mask, Joe. It's a great look for the main who claims he will institute a national mask mandate. So I guess we just won't have to PROPERLY wear them, eh?
1314971902352515074 2020-10-11 00:51:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Who the Hell is she to endorse either candidate? Not only is she too young to vote, SHE LIVES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. And it doesn't even BORDER ours. Mind your own business.
1314954257007865857 2020-10-10 23:41:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Talk about media porn!
1314954038639767553 2020-10-10 23:40:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Proud to be a vet.
1314953763560591362 2020-10-10 23:39:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> State? Does he even know what country? I swear, sometimes he must think we're in Russia.
1314953452443914240 2020-10-10 23:38:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovTomWolf So tell me why FL, with no mask mandate, has no spike in new COVID cases, yet we do in PA? I think it's just you, trying to make PA go blue next month. I dare you to give me an answer.
1314917431098445824 2020-10-10 21:15:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Maybe on HIS planet, but not here on Earth.
1314917292476706816 2020-10-10 21:14:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FrankLuntz @SteveScully And you are 100% delusional. If you think we believe you, 200%.
1314916977979412483 2020-10-10 21:13:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup. Like Gotti saying Luciano wasn't a bad guy.
1314916663725301761 2020-10-10 21:12:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RedFriday16 I started in 1978, at 17 years old. I continued for over 20 years. Since retirement in 1998, I am still one. We defended their right to spout stupid shit. Screw 'em.
1314915951175925761 2020-10-10 21:09:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen. "Stand for the flag, kneel for the cross."
1314915667796164608 2020-10-10 21:08:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenFeinstein 240,000 is not the will of the people. Trump sitting in the oval office IS. He is doing, for the 30th time in history, his duty as outlined in the constitution. Don't  try to twist it because it's not going your way.
1314914820446212097 2020-10-10 21:04:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RepKenBuck Absolutely. Twitter allows you to wish the president dies, but God forbid you make conservative comments.
1314720848926986243 2020-10-10 08:14:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nflcommish How is the ratings game going? We TOLD you. Maybe you should have a chat with Silver. You might learn something.
1314719608042074113 2020-10-10 08:09:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Twitter What is wrong with you? Liberals can tweet all day long how they hope the president dies, but you suspend a vets account for BS? HE IS THE REASON YOU CAN EXIST.
1314718902425989121 2020-10-10 08:06:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Sounds like someone needs a POTUS foot in the ass.
1314718658564849665 2020-10-10 08:05:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Lock her up!
1314718345388855305 2020-10-10 08:04:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Negative.
1314716986589536256 2020-10-10 07:58:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RedFriday16 Now you do. Hang in there, brother.
1314716525715173382 2020-10-10 07:57:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Even Nancy knows it.
1314708011537952769 2020-10-10 07:23:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Awesome!
1314707884413014018 2020-10-10 07:22:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @itsjjyoung @codeofvets That's great! Welcome home. Thank you for your service. üá∫üá≤
1314707141719097344 2020-10-10 07:19:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Getcha popcorn ready! Anyway, I'm sure someone will file something somewhere in federal court to try to stop it.
1314705903325597696 2020-10-10 07:14:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Pelosi driven insane? She was close enough to walk.
1314705650363097093 2020-10-10 07:13:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> When was your last reality check? You lost to a dementia-ridden career political hack, with 47 years of doing nothing noteworthy except praise a high ranking KKK member. You should focus on your city. It's a shit hole.
1314638964339417092 2020-10-10 02:48:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A little hard to follow, but yeah.
1314638513162289157 2020-10-10 02:47:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kirstiealley She is still pissed because the house fell on her sister.
1314638026312749057 2020-10-10 02:45:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> If Tucker isn't available, Hannity.
1314615125773561856 2020-10-10 01:14:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And Governor Wolf's daily new COVID case report numbers are creeping up the closer we get to election day. Remember, he got caught inflating the death count.
1314601240890834944 2020-10-10 00:18:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods Also, check out Governor Wolf's daily new COVID case reports. Steadily increasing as we get closer to election day. He already got caught inflating the virus death count. Local media is playing along.
1314593677042495490 2020-10-09 23:48:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> 'Religion shall not be a test.'
1314593402135216130 2020-10-09 23:47:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Like CA residents need another reason to leave.
1314589813430005761 2020-10-09 23:33:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And woefully transparent.
1314589470981861377 2020-10-09 23:32:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Complicit or incompetent? YES.
1314589146149777408 2020-10-09 23:30:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Pelosi has got to go!
1314584442665603072 2020-10-09 23:12:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Awesome. It's a shame so many just don't get it; why we did it. "The good people sleep well in their beds at night because there are rough men willing to do violence on their behalf."
1314582340614656000 2020-10-09 23:03:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Been ready. For years.
1314567020743208960 2020-10-09 22:02:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Yelp So anyone can write a racist accusation against a business, true or false, and you will take action? No verification? Wow. How liberal Democrat of you.
1314564352037605376 2020-10-09 21:52:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> At least Nixon didn't use our tax dollars to pay for his operation.
1314564013150306305 2020-10-09 21:50:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Slim to none, and Slim just left town.
1314562010512842752 2020-10-09 21:43:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm living it, in Eastern PA.
1314393572645404680 2020-10-09 10:33:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Seriously? This is CNN level stuff. Bye.
1314393199415353346 2020-10-09 10:32:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Where's the mask???
1314392894648791041 2020-10-09 10:31:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nytopinion Try Justice Kagan. The only bench she sat on was in a park.
1314392615979233280 2020-10-09 10:29:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm gonna watch MASH reruns instead.

1314367395465748487 2020-10-09 08:49:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They try to keep it quiet. It was on Obama's watch.
1314362427149037570 2020-10-09 08:29:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovTomWolf POTUS is doing his job per the constitution. It's happened 29 times before. We, the people spoke when we elected Trump. Keep your nose out of it, governors have no input. Besides, aren't you busy ruining this state? Yes, I'm a PA voter.
1314360728745324546 2020-10-09 08:23:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenToomey I just read Gov Wolf is going to pressure you to vote against SCOTUS nominee Barrett. Tell him to mind his own business. Governors have no input. I voted for you, don't abandon me because you plan to return to the private sector.
1314304262999093248 2020-10-09 04:38:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Disappointed? That's all? How about disgusted?
1314293739502866435 2020-10-09 03:57:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SpeakerPelosi Now you just look pathetic and desperate.
1314293098588012546 2020-10-09 03:54:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @LeslieMarshall @megynkelly Put up a woman who is qualified. I would have voted for Tulsi, and I'm a Republican. Stop with the crutch.
1314292576342679552 2020-10-09 03:52:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's because there's not much left to destroy in Kenosha.
1314291403522965505 2020-10-09 03:47:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Run, Kamala, run!
1314291238418485248 2020-10-09 03:47:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @benshapiro You're a moron. A moron with blinders on.
1314279843920523266 2020-10-09 03:01:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They will see just how disappointed we are next month. RED AGAIN. Kick some liberal ass, POTUS.
1314279423655456769 2020-10-09 03:00:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @exjon What you call "great success," most of us call a "shit hole." It's a shame, really. I was stationed near San  Jose in the late 80's, and SF was a beautiful city back then. Now, shit hole. Thanks, Harris (and Pelosi &amp; Schiff).
1314278504398192640 2020-10-09 02:56:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> My God. Watching Harris play coy.... Please, I just ate.
1314253133506375683 2020-10-09 01:15:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Acosta I'm sure you, like all the rest of the liberal media, are terrified about what will come out. It will, once again, expose you as a corrupt, biased, lying media hack.
1314236043646959620 2020-10-09 00:07:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MattWalshBlog What a BS story. Stop it. Maybe you should have said 16 instead of 6.
1314235384897957902 2020-10-09 00:05:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hey, she wants to play with the boys. Oh well.
1314225769632223234 2020-10-08 23:26:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's because Major Gabbard is far more qualified.
1314225562592870401 2020-10-08 23:26:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This from the moron who wasted two years of a house majority because he doesn't like President Trump.
1314213351380066315 2020-10-08 22:37:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jaketapper So you're saying, essentially, that a woman isn't capable of being VP.
1314213070923722753 2020-10-08 22:36:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So he is saying a woman doesn't have what it takes to be VP?
1314009975161860098 2020-10-08 09:09:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Too little, too late.
1313986090181812225 2020-10-08 07:34:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Kind of like Turk-182.
1313985993415045122 2020-10-08 07:34:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets What happened? What did I miss?
1313985813919694848 2020-10-08 07:33:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Someone must have told him, his mediocre (at best) performance in the first debate was like catching lightning in a bottle. He will never do that well twice, and certainly not three times. So 20 plus feet of social distance won't work?
1313984761141121024 2020-10-08 07:29:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Alert the press! Oh, I forgot. They won't run this kind of stuff.
1313946523374419971 2020-10-08 04:57:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And fifth-grade spelling is too much for THIS one.üòÜ Don't you at least know how to turn on autocorrect?
1313946049283792897 2020-10-08 04:55:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> No, it exists. It was censored by DNC run Twitter. Can't put too many facts out there, or the Twitter Democrat Thought Police will throw you in Twitter Jail. They hate facts.
1313943217231081476 2020-10-08 04:44:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Do they really think we don't know a stacked deck when we see it?
1313942943049359364 2020-10-08 04:43:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's the only way anyone will look at her. She obviously knows it.
1313942677931659264 2020-10-08 04:42:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They lost in in Nov 2016. Anybody need a fireworks barge?
1313942236233707527 2020-10-08 04:40:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> For 20 years, and the 22 since. Got some nice additional civilian LE training after I retired, too.
1313941891206000641 2020-10-08 04:38:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> But that was BEFORE she was picked as the nominee, excuse me, VP nominee. If time heals all wounds, then Harris is a medical miracle.
1313941325646041088 2020-10-08 04:36:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Change? Yes, we can! Same old crap, rephrased.
1313940863031169024 2020-10-08 04:34:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hanoi Jane hasn't mellowed with age.
1313928579772805120 2020-10-08 03:45:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is this how they plan to install Harris? An 11th hour switch?
1313928336343793665 2020-10-08 03:45:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jaketapper And no specifics about the length of your nose as it grows. Or your IQ, which is off the charts. The bottom of the charts.
1313922966737104896 2020-10-08 03:23:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's peaceful? Maybe on her planet, but not here on Earth.
1313921741379559424 2020-10-08 03:18:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We know what will happen. According to the late, great Warren Zevon, "Send lawyers, guns, and money." It will be a 5A fest.
1313921261299433473 2020-10-08 03:16:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Has anyone told her about the results from DeBlasio "reimagining" police? How about Chicago? I can "reimagine" the US Senate, starting with term limits.
1313912963686952961 2020-10-08 02:43:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jimmyfailla @greggutfeld I hope people realize Amy Schumer and Chuck Schumer are second cousins. Ruffalo and Silverman, well they're just typical, foaming-at-the-mouth Hollywood morons.
1313912331190128642 2020-10-08 02:41:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And these people have the nerve to preach to us. Maybe they'll get the sex offender votes.
1313911856810074113 2020-10-08 02:39:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Because they have four years of crap to eat, served on a silver platter.
1313907252974292996 2020-10-08 02:21:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @espn Even though I stopped watching your network a few years ago (Jameel Hill), at least you don't have that moron Olberman on the payroll now. Get rid of more, and seperate from ABC &amp; Disney, and I might be back.
1313905300911652864 2020-10-08 02:13:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Unfortunately most of the liberal millennials are to young to remember Hanoi Jane. She's sick.
1313896584715931650 2020-10-08 01:38:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's great. I'm a 20 year USAF vet, and I have said it many times- I would do it all over again.
1313895261522010112 2020-10-08 01:33:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @joshrogin YOU have to be the biggest moron on the planet. When the facts are against you, your only option is baseless hyperbole. Tired old platitudes. YOU are what  is wrong with the media. Blind hatred takes precedent over facts.
1313886807025745923 2020-10-08 01:00:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JosephWulfsohn At least he's aware of the age limits.
1313886408294174721 2020-10-08 00:58:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'll wait for the highlight reel. I would probably break my TV part way into it.
1313872211153956865 2020-10-08 00:02:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Unfortunately, all these liberal millennials weren't around to remember, and they don't want to hear it anyway.
1313871736853663745 2020-10-08 00:00:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden That's pure BULLSHIT and you know it. The state governors and city mayors make those decisions. FACT: The worst problems are in states and cities run by Democrats. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts. KKK Bixen.
1313867125170286593 2020-10-07 23:41:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Holy SS, Batman!
1313866915194994688 2020-10-07 23:40:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She's a Clinton. Teflon. Watch the body count rise with the release of documents.

1313865829679849473 2020-10-07 23:36:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Like rats on a sinking ship. One more Comey &amp; McCabe hack for CNN to hire.
1313857975212298240 2020-10-07 23:05:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @alexi They're just saying what we all know.
1313857672131870722 2020-10-07 23:04:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @seanhannity Where have you gone, Larry, Magic and Michael?
1313855841783762946 2020-10-07 22:56:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NFL Are you paying attention? It finally sank in for the NBA. All my Patriots tees and hoodies went in a Salvation Army bin. Get woke, go broke.
1313855349464629250 2020-10-07 22:55:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 One down. Next up, the NFL. I hope Goodell is paying attention.
1313854552945426433 2020-10-07 22:51:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Franklin and Jackson win every time.
1313854244773081089 2020-10-07 22:50:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I hope we get enough notice so I can get my popcorn ready.
1313853914501054464 2020-10-07 22:49:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Without a doubt. Comey already used the 'I don't know/remember' defense, so McCabe has nothing.
1313847935587713024 2020-10-07 22:25:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> His lips were moving. #FamousButIncompetent
1313846648062332929 2020-10-07 22:20:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This makes Watergate look like a fraternity prank.
1313846265373917186 2020-10-07 22:18:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They quote the constitution when it serves their interests. What about the section that states religion will not be a test?
1313644103335391232 2020-10-07 08:55:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Nobody mentions he totally ripped off the idea, then settled for peanuts. Zuckerberg is a thief and a liar.
1313637241340690433 2020-10-07 08:28:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Who knew NYC had an SS division?
1313636926566682624 2020-10-07 08:27:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> As a 20-year military vet, and a big fan of democracy, it frightens me.
1313622494121799680 2020-10-07 07:29:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Lock them all up!
1313622310461595649 2020-10-07 07:28:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NBCNews Liars. Pelosi wants to bail out mismanaged, Democrat run cities. HELL NO.
1313620807118094338 2020-10-07 07:23:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wasn't he from the Mueller &amp; Comey FBI? Are we surprised? Here it comes, my shocked face-üò≥
1313620196402356224 2020-10-07 07:20:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> "Corrupt" sells the Obama administration short, doesn't it?
1313605352844390400 2020-10-07 06:21:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm going to say it yet again- Biden can hide his own Easter eggs.
1313604953307516930 2020-10-07 06:20:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> In the same file with Hillary's.
1313590349693153281 2020-10-07 05:21:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And WHO is channeling Goebbels?

1313581790532165632 2020-10-07 04:47:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can you say, "Landslide" boys and girls? Where's the list? Who HASN'T Sleepy Joe alienated yet?
1313580524825382913 2020-10-07 04:42:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hmmm. Wonder who the Grand Dragon's prot√©g√© is referring to? Surely none of the people 'stocking shelves.' KKK Biden.
1313579644101292038 2020-10-07 04:39:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> If you think about it, not really.
1313577010363498501 2020-10-07 04:28:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She is still pissed off because the house fell on her sister.

1313572335056818176 2020-10-07 04:10:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @WolfVanHalen My heart-felt condolences, Wolf. There will never be another like your father. I still remember the first time. August 1978, basic training. I heard your dad and my jaw hit the floor. Out thoughts and prayers are with you and yours.
1313568208390160384 2020-10-07 03:54:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Yeah. The "buck" stops here. Literally millions of them.
1313567681891762177 2020-10-07 03:51:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Oh, come on! She rearranged the food pyramid. What more do you want?üòÜ
1313567242261594113 2020-10-07 03:50:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Another one we won't see on the mainstream media.
1313566197980385280 2020-10-07 03:46:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now finish it. Lock them up.

1313553991494766592 2020-10-07 02:57:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @PaulaReidCBS Russia! Russia! Russia! Sorry, we've seen that movie. Starring Obama, Biden, Clinton, Brennan, and their lackey, Comey.  The movie bombed at the box office. The sequel won't fare any better.
1313553357899010050 2020-10-07 02:54:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenKamalaHarris So, the 'no precedent' argument was proven BS, the 'RBG last wish' didn't fly, so now this? You're only worried about POTUS doing his constitutional duty. You're a hypocrite. I can't wait until ACB is confirmed. Or did you find someone she sexually assaulted in kindergarten?
1313552203689459715 2020-10-07 02:50:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @hunterw Moron. That means 'I'm not taking questions.' Not even a good spin effort. Loser.
1313526110664224773 2020-10-07 01:06:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Kaitlyn is the stereotypical left wing media hypocrite. Do they really think we don't see it? Or that we're that stupid?
1313518472425594888 2020-10-07 00:36:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> No thanks.
1313518315411775488 2020-10-07 00:35:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Raving hypocrite.
1313518092799152128 2020-10-07 00:34:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MichelleObama Overwhelmingly peaceful? Have you been stranded on a desert island with Gilligan? No, you're just a liar. Beatings, looting, and molotov cocktails are a far cry from overwhelmingly peaceful. Out of reach for your spin.
1313517385136123904 2020-10-07 00:32:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Newsom has to be the biggest moron to sit in a governor's chair. Cuomo, Wolf, and Witmer are just assholes, not morons.
1313502379736739842 2020-10-06 23:32:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now do PA!
1313487224688783362 2020-10-06 22:32:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Obviously you're not watching your press corps or your candidate. Hypocrite.
1313486794126700559 2020-10-06 22:30:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kaitlancollins Busted! What a raging hypocrite.
1313485685735776256 2020-10-06 22:26:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The only thing we have to fear is..... Another Democrat in the White House.

1313117006586089473 2020-10-05 22:01:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Where have you gone, Larry, Magic, and Michael?
1313113998188064782 2020-10-05 21:49:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brianstelter That's hilarious, coming from you and your network. I'm insulted that you think we're that stupid.
1313113630330761216 2020-10-05 21:47:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We're trained (and very capable) to use violence, but more importantly when it's appropriate.
1313112994809884672 2020-10-05 21:45:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Aren't their ratings going down ready? Hey CNN- PULL UP!

1312785592636387328 2020-10-05 00:04:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Anyone know the DNC Kool-Aid flavor?
1312785343884800008 2020-10-05 00:03:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @petestrzok @robertcobrien Too bad when you were an FBI agent, you didn't act like it. FBI- Famous But Incompetent. And you get an extra letter. H for "Hypocrite." As a retired detective, I say you are an embarrassment to the entire law enforcement community.

1312764121633480706 2020-10-04 22:38:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup. My NFL tees and hoodies went to the Salvation Army last month. I was going to burn them, but there are people in need.

1312450673674391554 2020-10-04 01:53:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Schiff is the biggest tool on the hill. Yup, bigger than Schumer, Pelosi, bigger than Nadler. Although to be fair he just edged out Nadler for the top spot.

So when is Wired Biden going to denounce ANTIFA? We know Harris won't, she  ontributed bail money. How about KKK fan Joe? You must be so proud.
1312419765613404162 2020-10-03 23:50:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jonfavs As opposed to BLM and ANTIFA. Oops! Strike that. ANTIFA was wearing masks long before COVID. Your name sounds familiar. Didn't you used to be famous?

Even though you obviously hate facts, especially when they  counter your narrative, listen to every word POTUS said. He NEVER said to take any cleaners. The liberal press flat out lied.

1312374249932361729 2020-10-03 20:49:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And positive for hypocrisy, vitriol, and pathological lying.

1312351058790940673 2020-10-03 19:17:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's what happens when you let the state go to Hell.

1312166790303162368 2020-10-03 07:05:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Shades of Hearst. Yellow Journalism is making a comeback.
1312165088040640513 2020-10-03 06:58:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I missed. I was talking about Acosta.
1312164817096982528 2020-10-03 06:57:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Because without a teleprompter, he has no answers.

1312149929729482753 2020-10-03 05:58:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Because they're backed by the DNC.
1312149690163494914 2020-10-03 05:57:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Twitter obviously didn't mind that one.
1312135773269880835 2020-10-03 05:02:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @betsy_klein Oh, I remember him. He was a newspaper reporter when I was a kid. I turned 60 last summer.

1312126816648261632 2020-10-03 04:26:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He's nasty because he USED to be famous, and then only as Mr. Roseanne Barr. Now that he's faded into obscurity, he just can't handle it.
1312120286985117696 2020-10-03 04:00:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ddale8 Wired Biden set the tone when he broke the agreement first. After interrupted first, he set the precedent. He just didn't like getting his own medicine. And moderator Wallace made sure everything possible favored Biden.
1312115708482838529 2020-10-03 03:42:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Maybe you should ask Schumer. He seems to be an expert (self-appointed) on the science.
1312115416823549954 2020-10-03 03:41:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I expect no better from an NYC resident.

1312094725655199744 2020-10-03 02:18:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JohnJHarwood For the Democrats, yes he is.
1312094448969494535 2020-10-03 02:17:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What? The NBA is still around?

1312083968171413509 2020-10-03 01:36:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Nope. But I got a warning about calling them on it.
1312080264336728065 2020-10-03 01:21:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Twitter How dare you! On your platform one of many wishes the sitting US President dead, and I get a locked message for calling them on it. Are you DNC funded?
1312079726257876992 2020-10-03 01:19:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 I just got locked. Twitter jail. They can wish POTUS dead, but God forbid we call them on it.
1312079361596678145 2020-10-03 01:17:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @lisa_curry You're a typical liberal piece of shit. If I had the "Way Back Machine," I would go back and give your daddy a condom. Obama was a total, corrupt loser, and I still wouldn't wish this on him. Unfortunately, you are representative of the liberal left.
1312078568369917953 2020-10-03 01:14:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 And the cowardly bitch has her account protected. Typical liberal. Can't stand to hear the truth or, Heaven forbid, facts.
1312077897021218816 2020-10-03 01:12:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They never disappoint, do they.
1312055270290468866 2020-10-02 23:42:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We should never use the terms "professional" or "class" when speaking of them. Use "lying sacks" and "mob."
1312054682316136455 2020-10-02 23:39:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Absolutely not.
1312043415866089472 2020-10-02 22:55:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm actually surprised the Twitter Police haven't gone after the well-wishers. Probably because Biden is among them.
1312042223253495808 2020-10-02 22:50:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You are a class act, Major Gabbard. I am a 20 year USAF vet, and a life-long Republican. I said many months ago, you are the one Democrat I would vote for. Again you showed us why. üá∫üá∏
1312040746166489088 2020-10-02 22:44:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We have to admit Joe didn't set the bar very high. POTUS might trip on it.
1312040230808170496 2020-10-02 22:42:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Good job! Show everyone what you're really about. Claim the morals, then show the sleaze. If people were wondering, now there's no doubt.
1312039438957056000 2020-10-02 22:39:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KaivanShroff There's a BIG difference. Did Trump say he wished she would die? No. Not in any way. So spare US your goddamn self-serving bullshit invalid comparisons.
1312033741158711297 2020-10-02 22:16:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @eagleey54374839 @catturd2 And U a MORON.ü•±
1312033206439481347 2020-10-02 22:14:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So apparently it is NOT against your morals. You're a typical liberal piece of shit.
1312026269396217862 2020-10-02 21:46:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Now if you could get your following to show the same class.
1312026009529733120 2020-10-02 21:45:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's a crime in many jurisdictions.
1312025793678258177 2020-10-02 21:45:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealSteveCox You are a piece of shit.
1312022469327425537 2020-10-02 21:31:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Be strong, Mr. President. We need you, now more than ever.
1311835040352002054 2020-10-02 09:07:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BetteMidler Oh, you're so clever. I guess you have a lot of time to think about this stuff, with you not working or anything.
1311823662681657345 2020-10-02 08:21:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's all the left ever has- name calling.
1311823388999114753 2020-10-02 08:20:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GarySiniseFound God bless, Sgt. Rosser.
1311823062770356226 2020-10-02 08:19:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And all the king's horses, and all the king's men....
1311804611330744321 2020-10-02 07:06:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @wasatch_runner @PressSec @johnrobertsFox But he DID. He responded "Sure" when asked if he would denounce it. What is with everybody? Was NO ONE listening????
1311803500553216004 2020-10-02 07:01:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What the Hell is going on at Fox? Greg! Dana! Jesse! Somebody HELP!
1311795204022775810 2020-10-02 06:28:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Sack up and back him up, Senator. Have this conversation in private, don't air it out here. And he DID.
1311785664929816577 2020-10-02 05:50:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> How can this happen? Alright. The third one it's Hannity. Or Tucker.
1311783405521195008 2020-10-02 05:41:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Holy sanitizer, Batman!
1311783081624379392 2020-10-02 05:40:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hillary must have had a schedule conflict.
1311782877605097473 2020-10-02 05:39:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DailyCaller Seriously? Why not just let Hillary be the moderator? If she can't do it, I'm sure Comey will.
1311770746981670919 2020-10-02 04:51:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NickRiccardi @sppeoples The Desperation Samba.
1311770172093599745 2020-10-02 04:49:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Are you that tone deaf Joe? Like we don't remember, or haven't seen the videos of you fawning over your favorite KKK leader, the late Senator Byrd? Are you kidding????
1311742260485201924 2020-10-02 02:58:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And you had to go in mom's basement, I'm guessing.
1311719136268083200 2020-10-02 01:26:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wow. Now you know you have REALLY made it big.
1311710844640808960 2020-10-02 00:53:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It just gets better. While they're at it, why not make POTUS write his answers on a dry-erase board?
1311707091854405632 2020-10-02 00:38:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenatorCollins POTUS DID denounce white supremacy. When asked if he would, he replied "Sure." Please stop being a tool of the left. Are you going Romney on us? Do I have to start denying my Portland birth?
1311704697355612161 2020-10-02 00:29:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hey Collins! You must have nodded off during the debate. POTUS answered "Sure" in response to the question.
1311703919878443009 2020-10-02 00:25:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Wasn't she part of the Brennan regime? I think POTUS should declassify Gina.
1311703431242018816 2020-10-02 00:24:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And is it just a coincidence that Governor Wolf's daily new COVID case report numbers are creeping up as we get closer to election day?
1311691089301180420 2020-10-01 23:35:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> TDS. Wallace has it.
1311690675876966402 2020-10-01 23:33:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Not when he has a case of TDS.
1311650289586446337 2020-10-01 20:52:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Good one.ü§£
1311637010327785472 2020-10-01 20:00:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Do PA next!
1311472162746896385 2020-10-01 09:05:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NickFalacci I was actually going to start with facts just to piss you off, but I have a feeling it won't matter. So, I'll use the liberal tactic, name calling. You're a moron.
1311456863490277382 2020-10-01 08:04:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Then how did the head of the Atlanta chapter get popped for using donations for a car, etc?
1311455927854301184 2020-10-01 08:00:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Cut him loose. Don't worry, CNN will snap him up.
1311348494138069004 2020-10-01 00:53:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FoxNews How is Wallace still employed? He didn't even make a half-assed attempt to be impartial. Way to lose viewers.
1311347308747988993 2020-10-01 00:48:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And don't forget, 'Poor kids are just as smart as white kids.'
1311345040791408642 2020-10-01 00:39:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Like Rob Reiner, Tom Arnold, Jim Carrey... Need I go on?
1311344321048739846 2020-10-01 00:37:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FrancisBrennan Look! A butterfly!
1311344184381538306 2020-10-01 00:36:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What was that Chris Rock said? "Man, I wouldn't do that shit if I was you."
1311343941271379968 2020-10-01 00:35:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Add that to long list of things he doesn't know.
1311338693144326145 2020-10-01 00:14:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @tomselliott @Comey Even when it involves a presidential candidate? I was born at night, but not last night.
1311333618661416961 2020-09-30 23:54:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm gonna say it again- FBI. Famous But Incompetent.
1311327933445832706 2020-09-30 23:31:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ChrisCuomo Drugs? It looked like "Wired Biden" should have raided Hunter's stash before going on stage. I think giving Biden sodium pentothal would be enlightening.
1311326054292885505 2020-09-30 23:24:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I understand. It's like Joe had said, "Here, hold my beer." Or, "Hey guys! Watch this!"
1311324729995923456 2020-09-30 23:19:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> His lips are moving.
1311324573229551623 2020-09-30 23:18:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
1311323448015310848 2020-09-30 23:14:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's official. "Hiden' Biden" is now "Wired Biden." He should fire the people talking in his ear.
1311322949727772672 2020-09-30 23:12:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He's a mole. Fox, CNN or MSNBC has infiltrated your company.
1311322304857726977 2020-09-30 23:09:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Do you mean the guy who wired Biden?
1311313894980440071 2020-09-30 22:36:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He should. The way Wallace moderated the debate surely got CNN hearts pounding, and drew cheers at MSNBC.
1311313193512456193 2020-09-30 22:33:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 You're psychotic! You knew it was going to happen (for all the liberal trolls out there, the "psychotic" was a malapropism. Look that up).
1311305460889186305 2020-09-30 22:02:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kilmeade Still sticking with that opinion?
1311291934250500096 2020-09-30 21:08:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is anyone going to do anything about Biden's wire? We can see it in the video.
1311289657867620352 2020-09-30 20:59:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @robreiner Maybe on YOUR planet. Not here on Earth.
1311287103473549313 2020-09-30 20:49:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CNN It seems you watched a different debate than the rest of us (MSNBC, ABC, et al, exclude). Wallace interrupted Trump 76 times, Biden 16. Biden refused to call out to the Democratic mayors of the war zones. No wonder you're swirling around the bowl. How about Biden's wire???
1311137911774085122 2020-09-30 10:56:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hang in there, Gretchen. You are the veterans' angel. We are with you, 100%. Got your six.
1311137413356544001 2020-09-30 10:54:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You're too kind. He's a piece of shit. All we want is an impartial moderator. Is that asking too much????
1311137062989553664 2020-09-30 10:53:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> One of many mistakes. We just want an impartial moderator. Is that too much to ask?
1311133386996699137 2020-09-30 10:38:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Nope. I already knew Wallace is a tool, and Biden is a crooked incompetent.
1311131697245827074 2020-09-30 10:32:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FoxNews I'm done with your network until you shit-can Wallace. All we want is impartial. He sounds like a CNN talking head. He won't let Trump talk, and he defends Biden. Impartial. That's all we want.
1311127051634651136 2020-09-30 10:13:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @FoxNews How can you keep Wallace on the payroll? He is SO biased, he belongs on CNN or MSNBC. His father was one of the original purveyors of fake news. He's got to go!
1311096719355117569 2020-09-30 08:13:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Don't forget, her husband made a bundle from his US Gov contract to sell USPS properties.
1311089707380596739 2020-09-30 07:45:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @rcohen It's extraordinary, I will agree. So they forged Brennan's notes? Lady, the big Russian involvement is a documented wire transfer to Hunter Biden. Typical response, though. We see through your biased, feigned outrage. The party of lies. We've seen so much of it.
1311087966052204544 2020-09-30 07:38:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Busted, Comrade Wolf!
1311087255671525377 2020-09-30 07:35:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Almost like the Roman Coliseum.üëé
1311077861747568644 2020-09-30 06:58:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kylegriffin1 So a quick look in the ears should be fine, right?
1311077561263362048 2020-09-30 06:57:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They gave up being media long ago. Now they're a DNC PR conglomerate.
1311061042743697408 2020-09-30 05:51:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Word. Although as I think about it, his mom does. He freely admits it.
1311054829939314692 2020-09-30 05:26:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ABC Absolutely, positively, untrue. Joe must have flunked out of DSU.üòÜ
1311051596114124801 2020-09-30 05:13:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NathanLerner @michaeljknowles Stick to McDonald's, or whatever mindless job you have, because it's clear you have no clue how this stuff works. Have an adult explain it to you.
1311036099335258114 2020-09-30 04:12:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> There's no place like home, There's no place like home, There's no place like home.... PhD level TDS.
1311034935294205952 2020-09-30 04:07:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> SO glad I'm sitting down ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1311028872394280963 2020-09-30 03:43:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Catfish? No need to measure, she's legal.
1311016160423555072 2020-09-30 02:53:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Corrupt people, even judges, hate getting caught. The cliche defense is attack someone else.
1311015609744973828 2020-09-30 02:50:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 @gatewaypundit You reach a lot of people, am I the only one who frequently gets the "Something went wrong" screen after posting? It happens several times a day, and the only way out is to close Twitter and try again. WTF???
1311015041316147203 2020-09-30 02:48:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now take it to PA!
1311014930825572352 2020-09-30 02:48:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Never. They believe they're helping us, the ignorant masses.
1311014728722980869 2020-09-30 02:47:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Count me as a contributor. Faithful 40 year fan until 2020. Three weeks ago, 24 tee's, four hoodies, and a pair of sweatpants went in the SA clothing drop bin. I would have burned them, but there are people in need.
1310990999141912579 2020-09-30 01:13:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Sell the whole thing. To China, then ship 'em out. Throw in the NFL, NBA, and the WNBA. No extra charge.
1310990603656757253 2020-09-30 01:11:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The clue phone is ringing off the hook and Harris just won't answer.
1310990373821599754 2020-09-30 01:10:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Don't forget the war against campaign opposition.
1310989080507842562 2020-09-30 01:05:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 @gatewaypundit I'm shocked it's not between questions. Actually, I'm surprised they don't want them before a response.
1310988615867142144 2020-09-30 01:03:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The liberal intellect never ceases to amaze me. Whoever wrote the tweet for this moron actually spelled a few words correctly.
1310988101863571460 2020-09-30 01:01:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup. CNN will check MSNBC, MSNBC will check ABC, who will check CBS, who will check NPR, who will check CNN. All results screened by the DNC prior to release, of course.
1310987598261899270 2020-09-30 00:59:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yes, but with their own set of facts.
1310979475958632448 2020-09-30 00:27:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Like this never happened before. Right, Donna?
1310979311231471623 2020-09-30 00:26:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup. It's Kamala Harris now.
1310979032289345537 2020-09-30 00:25:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We already know about Hunter. A case of the apple and the tree, perhaps?
1310920804163555330 2020-09-29 20:34:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jaketapper How much did Hunter pay on the 3.5 mil? You're a raging hypocrite.
1310919999763230722 2020-09-29 20:30:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is Biden's dementia contagious???
1310919159555989504 2020-09-29 20:27:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A slight twist on an old saying "(Politician) heal thyself." You first, Joe.
1310744855941791744 2020-09-29 08:55:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> WARNING: This tweet contains TDS content, and may be unsuitable for anyone with a brain.
1310735653806706689 2020-09-29 08:18:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hypocrisy. The most prominent trait of the liberal Democrats.
1310728114020986880 2020-09-29 07:48:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Absolutely. Thank God for video.
1310726095394791424 2020-09-29 07:40:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I think I might consider Democrat Horatio Seymour, Grant's opponent. He said "This is a white man's country, let the white man rule it." He was also governor of NY. Sure that gets him consideration. But Sleepy Joe is right up there.
1310707896481656833 2020-09-29 06:28:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Ooops. Hit the wrong retweet spot. Intended for AOC, obviously.
1310707618026057729 2020-09-29 06:27:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Cernovich @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm sure you were a better bartender than US Rep. By the way, you didn't mention your taxes since elected. Care to share? I DARE you.
1310707230392619009 2020-09-29 06:25:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AOC 'Thousands?' What's the matter, afraid to put the exact amount? You did for Trump. How about hiring one's paramour for a high-paid, do-nothing job? That we pay with our taxes. Hypocrite.
1310706507290468352 2020-09-29 06:22:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's not dodging. He's taking advantage of tax laws then Senator Joe Biden pushed through the Senate.
1310705487718092800 2020-09-29 06:18:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @justinjm1 You're so full of shit. The self-defense incidents rarely get media attention, because it doesn't fit the liberal left mainstream media.
1310705043914534914 2020-09-29 06:16:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brhodes If you're saying POTUS is an ass, so what. I didn't, and don't, vote based on likeability. I vote for who I think will best do the job. He is kicking ass, unlike the corruption-infested Obama administration that gave him even MORE things to fix. TDS. Such a terrible affliction.
1310703906620682248 2020-09-29 06:12:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I think it's actually racist on her part. Cloaking it in religion probably seems more palatable to her.
1310703308722655234 2020-09-29 06:09:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kylegriffin1 They have the paper trail, moron.
1310702779741110273 2020-09-29 06:07:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brianschatz He just owes millions in favors, to the Chinese, the Russians, and God only knows who else. To be fair, he probably made some hefty donations to pal Sen. Byrd's favorite charity organization- the KKK.
1310694504803033093 2020-09-29 05:34:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @votelandry So you defend your remark with 50 year old photos? Of women who were Democrats? Your photos were indeed of a dark time, but we're a lot better now. And it wasn't just the women. Were you even ALIVE when those photos were taken?
1310691805642534913 2020-09-29 05:24:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AnnBrenoff @dbongino But not all humans are the same. Some have boy parts, and some have girl parts. This is necessary to make more humans. It's biological FACT, not an opinion to be debated.
1310690831003783168 2020-09-29 05:20:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @votelandry I'm embarrassed that you are a citizen of the same country as I am. I'm even MORE embarrassed you're an elected official. The only saving grace- I DEFINITELY am not from Louisiana. Shameless pandering.
1310687061255557126 2020-09-29 05:05:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AntiTrumpHero @CheckYourLogic2 @catturd2 We haven't seen the off-shore accounts. He probably sits on the Clinton Foundation Board.
1310682746730229762 2020-09-29 04:48:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MrSisXian @catturd2 @DeepSouthProud If Trump is awful, we really have to dig to describe Biden. Horrendous? Dumpster fire? 47 years in US Government and he hasn't done SQUAT.
1310673782810595328 2020-09-29 04:12:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods Dieter, my best friend of 14 years.  https://t.co/Iu56te4zjn
1310671215246405636 2020-09-29 04:02:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Obama is on record using the IRS as a weapon.
1310670859619753990 2020-09-29 04:00:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure there are a lot of things you can't comprehend.
1310670617117700097 2020-09-29 04:00:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can you say "pander" boys and girls?
1310665538549448705 2020-09-29 03:39:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now do PA!
1310665091818414081 2020-09-29 03:38:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> How could you not?
1310664343885840384 2020-09-29 03:35:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Or have my balls pounded flat with a wooden hammer.
1310616256169545731 2020-09-29 00:24:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods My condolences. My best friend will be 14 in two weeks, and I will devastated when his time comes to cross the Rainbow Bridge.
1310615886756282370 2020-09-29 00:22:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hunter's advice, I'm sure.
1310604723519721472 2020-09-28 23:38:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MikeBastasch @DonaldJTrumpJr You have to remember, right or wrong is not part of the equation. It's purely what fits the liberal left/anti-Trump narrative.
1310604151152312320 2020-09-28 23:35:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Ilhan That's really funny, coming from you. Now, how about something on campaign finance?
1310590969457369088 2020-09-28 22:43:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Lock her up!
1310578173340508160 2020-09-28 21:52:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Obama Biden years. Oh yeah, good times.  https://t.co/83zJ2EEXDe
1310577864568377344 2020-09-28 21:51:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brianstelter "Legal access" does NOT mean "legal release." I held a TS in the military for years, with "legal access" to protected information. Release= jail time. You're a ultra biased moron.

1310573442798936064 2020-09-28 21:33:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Not Biden's corruption, Hunter's Russian payday, FBI corruption, Omar's illegal election..... You have no credibility. Zero. And I didn't even mention Bill Clinton's frequent flyer miles on Epstein Air.
1310572559788802051 2020-09-28 21:30:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MichaelSkolnik Trump economy: Succeeded.
1310571768474734593 2020-09-28 21:27:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @WeDemandJustice If you're going to spout facts, spout them all. POTUS is FOLLOWING THE LAW, morons.
1310390264633139202 2020-09-28 09:25:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> LOCK HER UP!
1310354927881945088 2020-09-28 07:05:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BarbMcQuade So? They were legally elected by the system installed by the founding fathers. I am so sick of the "popular vote" argument. I will not stand for the five big cities electing our president again and again. The electoral college insures EVERYONE's vote counts, not just those in NYC
1310331111436963846 2020-09-28 05:30:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KamalaHarris Side note- The longest senate filibuster in history was 75 hours, in 1964. A Democrat trying to block the Civil Rights Act. Just sayin'
1310329560496566279 2020-09-28 05:24:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So you're saying you wouldn't "hand pick" a justice? Hypocrite.
1310329323077931009 2020-09-28 05:23:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> "Hand-picked" is how every SCOTUS justice got there. If you think we're that stupid... Well, to be fair, your supporters ARE. We are opposed to YOU. I wouldn't vote for you as theater usher. Long live Tupac!
1310328557093228544 2020-09-28 05:20:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Small town cat makes it big!
1310324853333991426 2020-09-28 05:06:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He doesn't even know where he is. He can hide his own Easter eggs. You're surprised?
1310324626095038465 2020-09-28 05:05:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Pravda.
1310324432641167360 2020-09-28 05:04:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It takes me back to 1978. We were three years out of Vietnam. As an 18 year-old, I just didn't get why I was treated as a second-class citizen. It seems like we're drifting back that way.
1310308201712230400 2020-09-28 03:59:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They would use a hearing like they have others. Not to ask legitimate questions, but to belittle and badger the individual, as well as spout their leftist cant.
1310307374440370177 2020-09-28 03:56:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And badges.
1310307303116156928 2020-09-28 03:56:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yet ANOTHER Hollywood type comes out as a TDS afflicted moron.
1310307048631009282 2020-09-28 03:55:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> 180 useless years in government will make you say crap like that.
1310306877289500672 2020-09-28 03:54:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Labeling it a "conspiracy theory" does not automatically mean it's not true.
1310306223506575361 2020-09-28 03:52:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I see it.
1310046746714812416 2020-09-27 10:40:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He was probably just reading the teleprompter and doesn't know who Goebbels was.
1310026630484701184 2020-09-27 09:21:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenBlumenthal As a 20 year veteran, I will say you sir, are scum.
1310026267874545673 2020-09-27 09:19:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @VoterCenter I'm not buying into Governor Wolf's part in the Dem scheme. He's been fear mongering most of this year.
1310021329593274370 2020-09-27 08:59:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I guess you haven't been paying attention. SCOTUS is Justice Kagan's first time on something other than a park bench.
1310007005436948480 2020-09-27 08:03:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden You're 100% right, the people should have a say. We the people did when we elected the president and congress. We DON'T vote for SCOTUS justices. They didn't teach that at DSU?
1310005508905086979 2020-09-27 07:57:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GilpinPeri Yet ANOTHER insulated, TDS afflicted Hollywood moron weighs in. Just because you used to be famous, it doesn't make you smarter than everyone. If supporting actress with three minutes per episode counts as "famous."
1310004850881638402 2020-09-27 07:54:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DrIbram Wow. You're a total racist. All you see is skin color, and make your judgements. You're as bad as any KKK member, and that includes Biden's pal, the late Senator Byrd.
1310004121815126022 2020-09-27 07:51:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenBlumenthal Read the constitution.
1310000637455859713 2020-09-27 07:37:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Gotta check wind direction.
1309997104660701186 2020-09-27 07:23:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden The four years aren't up yet, Joe. Have someone help you read a calendar.
1309993064010854401 2020-09-27 07:07:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SpeakerPelosi Help me. What section of the constitution speaks to a SCOTUS justice dying wishes? RIP Justice Ginsberg.
1309977628305231879 2020-09-27 06:06:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> FIVE WHOLE MINUTES? Must have caught her napping. She's way behind.
1309973743196921856 2020-09-27 05:50:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I was way off (but it's far from over). Schumer is starting with the Obama-care angle. Like he cares, he's exempt.
1309968756886700034 2020-09-27 05:31:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I think their two choices are the Catholic angle, and Roe v. Wade. It doesn't matter what she actually said/ruled in the past, they will lie.
1309967189483704321 2020-09-27 05:24:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Sticking pins into her Trump doll. The prelude to snacking on infant children.
1309932117543936000 2020-09-27 03:05:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And STAY out!
1309930927678795777 2020-09-27 03:00:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It seems like it.
1309873755385221121 2020-09-26 23:13:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Four years ago, I volunteered to help them pack. No one took me up on it, but my offer still stands.
1309873323317366784 2020-09-26 23:11:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> All enemies, foreign and domestic.
1309872863248355334 2020-09-26 23:10:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> PLEASE! DO IT! Better get passports printed, and brace yourself for stiff tariffs.
1309872483798048768 2020-09-26 23:08:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He's a New Jersey Dem who tries, and sometimes succeeds, at appearing impartial. But not always.
1309854948386050049 2020-09-26 21:58:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @elrey @DeAnna4Congress I imagine being able to understand you if you learn to write English.
1309854163837353985 2020-09-26 21:55:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Remember, the Indian/Jamaican folks didn't produce any prolific rappers.
1309853670406860801 2020-09-26 21:53:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Unfortunately I think they're cooking with those copper pans-  Nothing sticks.
1309851620289794048 2020-09-26 21:45:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Negative. Hillary even said it out loud.
1309602667963052040 2020-09-26 05:16:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The classic left "Double Standard." One of their main weapons.
1309602338139709441 2020-09-26 05:15:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dbongino I even offered to help him pack.
1309595876369879040 2020-09-26 04:49:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> "I like it, I love it, I want some more of it."
1309595400677068805 2020-09-26 04:47:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Somebody please tack on limits for Congress!
1309586222625497096 2020-09-26 04:11:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Talk about election tampering....
1309585639273308160 2020-09-26 04:08:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Whitlock, you are the typical left moron.
1309580869468852226 2020-09-26 03:49:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm jealous. I live in PA. We have one of the top five worst.
1309580522105065474 2020-09-26 03:48:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Easier to find than Sleepy Joe!
1309580160774164483 2020-09-26 03:46:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure, just like last time, they have three or four set of signs made up. Wouldn't it be a hoot if this was a smokescreen, and POTUS nominates someone he never mentioned? It would set the left back two days waiting for signs.
1309579691410550793 2020-09-26 03:45:03 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Truth simply doesn't matter to Biden, Harris, and the rest of them. Schumer is the grand master of lies.
1309578454220898313 2020-09-26 03:40:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Shhhhh! I'm sure they have no idea.
1309577609806839808 2020-09-26 03:36:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And that's why POTUS kicked him to the curb. A little late....
1309577277290811393 2020-09-26 03:35:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Why aren't we seeing perp walks yet????
1309576899841134594 2020-09-26 03:33:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A no-brainer. He's a career FBI bureaucrat. They need to bring in an outsider, like a former or current USA.
1309568758462246915 2020-09-26 03:01:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @kevincorke @DonaldJTrumpJr PLEASE do. In fact what are you waiting for? You obviously don't like Democracy. I'll help you pack.
1309504218101878784 2020-09-25 22:45:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And I thought it was just me.
1309487489892134912 2020-09-25 21:38:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This is funny, coming from the woman who said Biden should contest the election.
1309476625902436352 2020-09-25 20:55:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dcexaminer Accidentally? In a ditch? If it were a dumpster, MAYBE. Pravda. You.
1309475703226761217 2020-09-25 20:51:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And don't stand in front of my vehicle.
1309295427615850497 2020-09-25 08:55:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Damnit, it's gone. I miss all the good stuff.
1309250533304266752 2020-09-25 05:57:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @TASjr_ T.A.S. should be P.O.S. Piece of shit.
1309238631920537600 2020-09-25 05:09:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> POTUS, be prepared to be called a "lying dog-faced pony soldier."
1309237981149040642 2020-09-25 05:07:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> POS.
1309230950396694530 2020-09-25 04:39:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Kehlani Take out your tampon and try it. Pick a vet, any one of them will hand you your ass. Of course they have go in your mom's basement to find you.
1309230119609946123 2020-09-25 04:35:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's an easy one. Two sets of rules.
1309229882610798592 2020-09-25 04:35:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CNN So you don't think Hunter Biden caught with his fingers in the Russian cookie jar is news? Can you be more obvious? No wonder your network is going down. You're not news, you're the DNC Pravda.
1309206601409196032 2020-09-25 03:02:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Prepare to get pounded with questions about your position on preservatives in cat food.
1309206183551668224 2020-09-25 03:00:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And often.....
1309203131914428417 2020-09-25 02:48:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Asking Comey and McCabe for advice.
1309201510845362176 2020-09-25 02:42:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Ah, the left. What class. They're showing the world what Biden supporters are about. I've said repeatedly, their position is absolutely devoid of facts. This is all they have. But they'll be back inside when recess is over.
1309184767200505859 2020-09-25 01:35:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Ask him where he heard that. From the left? I would want to see the video.
1309184447099666439 2020-09-25 01:34:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Governor Wolf, are you listening?
1309184246767063042 2020-09-25 01:33:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Maybe some of Hunter's cocaine would help?
1308938795627220992 2020-09-24 09:18:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They went past protest at a run.
1308938159254908931 2020-09-24 09:15:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 Aw, isn't Mayor Pete cute. So hopeful. Probably still puts cookies out for Santa.
1308933154036690944 2020-09-24 08:55:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BridgetPhetasy @RealCandaceO You're mistakenly jumping ahead to the trial portion. Here, a judge determined there was probable cause, a reasonable belief based on investigative facts, that specific evidence of a crime was on the premises to be searched. The man shooting tends to back that up.
1308932129368223746 2020-09-24 08:51:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That tracks.
1308906557409759233 2020-09-24 07:10:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BridgetPhetasy @RealCandaceO This is not 'defending a home,' It's resisting arrest. I am SURE they identified themselves, so again, that's out. Nice try.
1308906106018844674 2020-09-24 07:08:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm still with you, Catturd.
1308890635554951168 2020-09-24 06:07:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @HillaryClinton Russia, Russia, Russia. Looks like you were right after all. Well, maybe right church, but wrong pew.
1308888778719850497 2020-09-24 05:59:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Imagine the haul if daddy is elected PRESIDENT? It will make 3.5 mil look like chump change.
1308887866496425985 2020-09-24 05:55:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's a language they understand.
1308874944038735878 2020-09-24 05:04:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now it's time for the GOP to start chanting it.
1308854154937405441 2020-09-24 03:42:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Touched a nerve?
1308853991820988417 2020-09-24 03:41:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> To be fair, I doubt Hunter walked in and said, "Hey mom! Guess who just scored a few mil  from the Russkies?"
1308852967894810624 2020-09-24 03:37:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm still here. Aim high!
1308839888775675904 2020-09-24 02:45:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Ah, yet another "intellectual" liberal speaks, in predictable fashion- No facts, just name calling and obscenities. Yup, not a fact in sight.
1308839442438860807 2020-09-24 02:43:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DonaldJTrumpJr If it were you Don, that's all we would see and hear for months.
1308812752287338501 2020-09-24 00:57:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Keep looking. Good luck.
1308793279870365696 2020-09-23 23:40:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @irodio @catturd2 @FrostyBlueFarms And you are a naive person with no grasp of reality. TDS does that.
1308768025626259458 2020-09-23 21:59:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hell, the flintlock rifle was a weapon of war.
1308767364582977536 2020-09-23 21:57:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen.
1308767260622950401 2020-09-23 21:56:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Left will pull anything and everything. Desperation.
1308766821538033665 2020-09-23 21:55:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Who do you think is running the basement teleprompter?
1308766588485722114 2020-09-23 21:54:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Cindy WHO????
1308755452142981128 2020-09-23 21:09:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @PeteButtigieg And I do agree with you, we ARE getting less democratic, in spite of President Trump's efforts. We can thank the Dems, the party of slavery, for it.
1308755022100955144 2020-09-23 21:08:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @PeteButtigieg Playing the popular vote angle. There's a reason the founding fathers made it LAW. If it weren't for the electoral college, those who didn't live in New York, Illinois, California, and a few other cities wouldn't even bother to vote. Only the five or six big cities would count.
1308584583848497152 2020-09-23 09:50:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @cindymccain @JoeBiden And that, Mrs. McCain, is one truckload of BULLSHIT. He did nothing in 47 years of government except further his own interests. Racist, on top of that. Look at his statements.
1308572654996197377 2020-09-23 09:03:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @cindymccain Your endorsement of Biden is actually an endorsement of Trump. Your late husband, God rest his soul, was a Democrat in Republican clothing. Personally, I don't particularly care for Donald Trump the man, but as POTUS, he's kicking ass.
1308571365033889794 2020-09-23 08:58:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NAACP You are one of the most racist organizations in this country.
1308539163382296577 2020-09-23 06:50:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She was a Democrat appointment. Isn't it obvious? Does "Jim Crow" ring a bell?
1308525977904001029 2020-09-23 05:57:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Said the typical Hollywood actor as he gulps the Kool-Aid (no offense, Mr. Woods. You're not typical).
1308500572107137027 2020-09-23 04:17:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen, brother. Retired in '98, but still ready &amp; willing to defend.
1308470685505933313 2020-09-23 02:18:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> If only we could get into his teleprompter. Maybe slip in "Peter Piper picked" or something.
1308469583343386624 2020-09-23 02:13:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Spineless cowards, that's who. This guy doesn't have the balls to pick up a match.
1308468000958357505 2020-09-23 02:07:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Typical Dems. When the rules (laws) are against them, spelled out in black and white, they want to change them.
1308467603548102656 2020-09-23 02:06:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Absolutely. Even if you don't like Donald Trump the person, you've got to love him as POTUS if you love the USA.
1308452024154021892 2020-09-23 01:04:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 @gatewaypundit Here's a gem I bet most don't know. Grant's election opponent, Horatio Seymour, a DEMOCRAT, actually said, "This is white man's country; let the white men rule." ABOLISH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
1308450501680398337 2020-09-23 00:58:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @rezaaslan There is no "we." You are a cowardly pussy. Why don't you go to the store and buy a can of "Man." Actually, why don't you buy a case. You need it.
1308422220922990595 2020-09-22 23:05:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Dumb and Dumber.
1308422056283865088 2020-09-22 23:05:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Mile High club, Junior Division.
1308421706785136640 2020-09-22 23:03:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why anyone takes this woman seriously, or how she has stayed in government for decades.
1308415082565636103 2020-09-22 22:37:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @brianstelter So Brian- Are you saying it's not true? To be fair, we're used to seeing patently false banners on CNN, but Tucker is not on CNN.
1308412904442679307 2020-09-22 22:28:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Her????
1308412110888673286 2020-09-22 22:25:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @catturd2 Schumer talking about 'decency and honor' is like Hitler talking about racial tolerance.
1308411657408913420 2020-09-22 22:23:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hypocrisy is on every page of the liberal playbook.
1308411064850223105 2020-09-22 22:21:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Been ready. For years.
1308410880783200257 2020-09-22 22:20:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Business as usual for Schumer, Pelosi and co.
1308197503045718018 2020-09-22 08:12:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Remember, there's no such thing as bad press. They're reading you, keep up the great work.
1308197215551344641 2020-09-22 08:11:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BeauWillimon It's in accordance with the constitution; the LAW. Moron.
1308197042297200640 2020-09-22 08:10:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure he'll employ some really nasty, scathing tweets.
1308196771886231552 2020-09-22 08:09:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @amyklobuchar To all the whining, hand-wringing liberals- "You can't handle the truth!"
1308180745391833088 2020-09-22 07:06:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Not even elected and he's already breaking promises. He's too worried about losing supporters.
1308180381359910912 2020-09-22 07:04:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> There's a teleprompter operator looking for work now.
1308163989847801857 2020-09-22 05:59:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Grunt style can go in the SA bin. I was there today and dumped all my NFL &amp; MLB stuff.
1308163719147520001 2020-09-22 05:58:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Gruntstyle Nine line all the way.
1308163365668257798 2020-09-22 05:57:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's a little bit of a surprise. It seems so many liberals are illiterate. Maybe they have others to read it to them?
1308048271122853888 2020-09-21 22:19:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Another victim of the liberal narrative.  RIP,  brother.
1308047972979093504 2020-09-21 22:18:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And the predictable sexual assault allegations, regardless of the nominee's gender.
1308040986904363010 2020-09-21 21:50:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> "All enemies, foreign and domestic......"
1307847520203223040 2020-09-21 09:02:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Better than Obama's Hawaii vacations, I guess.
1307818417387376645 2020-09-21 07:06:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> "Welcome to the Emmys, I'm your host..." Okay, okay, I'll talk! I'll tell you whatever you want to know! For the love of God, just make it stop! TURN IT OFF!
1307799787631247360 2020-09-21 05:52:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I tweeted right to him, mind your own f'ing business.
1307720110824722438 2020-09-21 00:35:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @AOC Maybe it's time you read something. Start with the constitution. My dying wish will be the Democratic Party, the party of slavery and subsequent "Jim Crow" laws, be abolished.
1307714639153844238 2020-09-21 00:14:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealMiniAOC What about Romney and Murkowski? Maybe even Collins?
1307714362023477248 2020-09-21 00:12:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A little while back I tweeted to him, "I thought you just played a meathead on TV. But I see you weren't acting."
1307713886129393664 2020-09-21 00:11:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> AWESOME.
1307709007973543937 2020-09-20 23:51:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The first that come to mind are the NYFD &amp; NYPD first responders who answered the call on 9/11.
1307648783279370243 2020-09-20 19:52:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @thehill @TheHillOpinion Consider her for what? A other new food chart?
1307648341774401536 2020-09-20 19:50:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> If you don't like the laws, contact your elected representatives. Oh, and make sure you watch the videos of Obama, and Justice Ginsberg herself speaking to the topic. God bless, Justice Ginsberg.
1307493521037963268 2020-09-20 09:35:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Already called out a couple. No response.
1307461450714222592 2020-09-20 07:27:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Methinks they will have company on the political bread line.
1307459233638739968 2020-09-20 07:19:07 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @EmmMacfarlane Mind your own fucking business. You have no say in any of our dealings.
1307452108027973632 2020-09-20 06:50:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ewarren The desperation is all yours. Pathetic.
1307451679831449601 2020-09-20 06:49:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RussTamblyn It's the law. TFB if you don't like it. You want war, take out your tampon and bring it.
1307444041819271169 2020-09-20 06:18:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I have to disagree, Liz. Trump didn't sneak into the oval office. We the people put him there in accordance with the laws of this great nation.
1307443098046300160 2020-09-20 06:15:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This is how a 'participation trophy' child turns out.
1307442804826701827 2020-09-20 06:13:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Love it or hate it, Trump is the sitting president until at least January. He has every right, actually duty, to appoint as long as he is in office. Deal with it in November.
1307442321265512448 2020-09-20 06:11:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> How can following the law be "reckless and reprehensible?" Oh, that's right, the law is contrary to the liberal narrative.
1307381264064950283 2020-09-20 02:09:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @rezaaslan Don't worry folks, as they say, 'Don't worry about the dog that's barking, worry a out the quiet one.' Or in this case, pampered poodle puppy.
1307307229452918787 2020-09-19 21:15:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It makes no difference. Some liberal lesbian will say she sexually assaulted her when they were in first grade.
1307306747074314240 2020-09-19 21:13:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RussTamblyn Bring it. Might as well bring both of your liberals with guns, too.
1307306448179912708 2020-09-19 21:12:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> No one takes you seriously when you rant. Calm down.  Discuss things rationally. Intelligently. If you can't, you will just have to stay inside at recess.
1307305904535109637 2020-09-19 21:09:50 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's simply two ways to get across the creek.
1307305561470492673 2020-09-19 21:08:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @rezaaslan Take out your tampon and try it. Oh, that's right, you're trying to get OTHERS to do it. You don't have the balls to grab a gas can and flick a Bic.
1307305055926841345 2020-09-19 21:06:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's all part of the plan to take back the White House.
1307149739830521857 2020-09-19 10:49:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yeah, that former CNN asshole said they will burn it down. I say, "Bring it."
1307149415350706179 2020-09-19 10:48:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's nice to see not all have lost humanity. He truly is a hero.
1307144316725407745 2020-09-19 10:27:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He has what we call "Twitter balls." Face to face, man to man, he would come apart like a cheap watch. He's forgetting a lot of us vets are conservative, and we know how to fight. So take out your tampon and bring it.
1307143428053118977 2020-09-19 10:24:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The most intelligent words ever from a liberal.
1307143127904538626 2020-09-19 10:23:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I don't expect any better from scum. Before, I called him a snake. Then I realized I owed the snakes an apology.
1307142364776062977 2020-09-19 10:19:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @rezaaslan Don't try burning here. There will be consequences.
1307134732166144005 2020-09-19 09:49:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The clue phone is ringing.
1307134529547665408 2020-09-19 09:48:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure it's driving the liberals nuts. CNN will find a way to twist it.
1307124092491960320 2020-09-19 09:07:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You know they're fragile when a flatulent feline upsets them so much.
1307122846808842243 2020-09-19 09:02:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenSchumer She's not even cold, Chuck. You're scum.
1307122614620614657 2020-09-19 09:01:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Keith is the Grim Reaper's stunt double.
1307076688736669697 2020-09-19 05:59:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Doesn't he, or actually, don't his handlers know the video is readily available? That we can do our own fact-checking???
1307041099979071488 2020-09-19 03:37:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> My hoodie just arrived today. It's awesome!
1307032646401298432 2020-09-19 03:04:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I believe the Dems policy is known as "Scorched Earth."
1307031484000284672 2020-09-19 02:59:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Aw, c'mon! The dude emptying the trash cans is OK.
1307021960879247361 2020-09-19 02:21:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Go OUTSIDE the bureau. The current upper echelon defines "Famous But Incompetent."
1307017943939776518 2020-09-19 02:05:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hmmm. Do I smell fear?
1307017390870409217 2020-09-19 02:03:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's funny, you saying that. 94% of PA COVID deaths were in nursing homes. All you did, like your pal Cuomo, is kill off elderly.
1307007773339791360 2020-09-19 01:25:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I've got a 20+ year 'no watch' streak, and I'm not going to break it.
1307007480107618304 2020-09-19 01:24:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Am I the only one frequently getting the message "Something went wrong" when tweeting Conservative viewpoint stuff?
1307007147050512387 2020-09-19 01:22:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Remember the eTrade baby? "Let me show you my 'shocked' face."
1307006758070743041 2020-09-19 01:21:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A few years ago, weren't they banging on Trump, claiming he said he could control the weather?
1306999854657425411 2020-09-19 00:53:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Like I said, general officers are political. This is not new, that was Patton's criticism of Ike. 'Too much a politician.'
1306998718063931392 2020-09-19 00:49:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Mix one part flaming, righteous, hypocritical asshole and a big dose of TDS and what do you get? Joy Behar.
1306986314689130496 2020-09-18 23:59:54 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jameshohmann There's a difference. Many frequently teleprompters for a scripted speech. Joe uses them for his scripted answers to questions.
1306985588336340994 2020-09-18 23:57:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GenMhayden You must remember, one must be political, not a patriot, to be promoted to general officer. I was active duty for over 20 years; I've seen it.
1306984577358069764 2020-09-18 23:53:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Liberals stay angry because they are bombarded with facts contrary to their narrative. "If you want to anger a conservative, lie to him. If you want to anger a liberal, give him facts."
1306978311378292748 2020-09-18 23:28:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We shouldn't be surprised, Dan. You and I have both worked with them during our careers. The FBI upper echelon is infested with career bureaucrats. Clean house, POTUS. This crap will happen until he does.
1306977781599870976 2020-09-18 23:26:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Aim high, Catturd.
1306977602746421249 2020-09-18 23:25:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can't get anything past Joe. Sharp as the leading edge of a bowling ball.
1306976946245509120 2020-09-18 23:22:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Liar.
1306966725020258306 2020-09-18 22:42:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He doesn't even give Cuomo credit for the assist.
1306966382421176320 2020-09-18 22:40:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> FREEZE! Social worker! Put the gun back in your pants and give me a hug!
1306965225736933377 2020-09-18 22:36:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @HumanChain5 @sauter_shannon @catturd2 Biden- 'The president's China travel ban is xenophobic.' Pelosi- 'Come on down and visit Chinatown.' No wonder we have that many deaths.
1306964369822097419 2020-09-18 22:32:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> But I'm sure, according to Cuomo, it's Trump's fault.
1306964140636938240 2020-09-18 22:31:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This is Hypocrisy in action, not Democracy.
1306963673341218816 2020-09-18 22:29:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You earned it. Keep it up, go for 13.
1306963382575271941 2020-09-18 22:28:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RichardGrenell I've been saying the same thing for months. Yes, COVID is real, but Russia didn't work so they're spinning it up. Just the opposite of H1N1. But back then they had the White House. Big difference.
1306794978203623426 2020-09-18 11:19:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You too?
1306794744383705091 2020-09-18 11:18:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen.
1306783240464760834 2020-09-18 10:32:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Sarahkirk40 @NobodyStarving @alisabatman @catturd2 @thehill That's like citing a few malpractice cases and ignoring the doctors who saved lives. So narrow minded. You only search for, and use, facts that support your beliefs.
1306782166827884545 2020-09-18 10:28:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Yup, a few negative, unfortunate incidents wipe out the thousands of times the police helped people. When someone kicks your door in, make sure you call a social worker and head for your safe place.
1306781303824699392 2020-09-18 10:25:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Monroe County, PA. Yup, I'm seeing them too. Unfortunately, the rural counties don't matter. When Wolf got reelected governor, he won 17 of 67 counties.   Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh decide things for the rest of us. The case for the electoral college.
1306772333898723328 2020-09-18 09:49:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What happened to the 'xenophobic' claim after POTUS banned China travel?
1306763925892018176 2020-09-18 09:16:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Can you picture this clown on Hannity?
1306750985772109831 2020-09-18 08:24:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenSchumer So does that include reimbursement for the responsible, law-abiding young Americans who fulfilled their part of the agreement and paid their debts? Of course not. What a slap in the face to them, you despicable, bottom-feeding, political hack.
1306699602767368202 2020-09-18 05:00:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Just read the meme- Does your mom know you have a phone, just like the big kids?
1306699355563401219 2020-09-18 04:59:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> At least the pussy Trump allegedly grabbed was legal age. I saw video of Creepy Joe groping young girls.
1306698908001857537 2020-09-18 04:57:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JesseKellyDC @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump He is another career FBI bureaucrat. They're a cancer in that organization.
1306695682615582720 2020-09-18 04:45:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Help me with the numbers. How many days have the riots been going on? Nancy is just now saying this????
1306688932441186305 2020-09-18 04:18:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He got away more. A LOT more. Go back to the Hawaii mansion, Michelle. You're as bad as Hillary, desperately trying to stay relevant.
1306679910069678081 2020-09-18 03:42:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Did anyone tell her "Me Too" is old news? She needs to be a victim of police brutality now.
1306679502609809415 2020-09-18 03:40:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Sarahkirk40 @catturd2 @thehill Ah, Minnesota. That explains everything. You're fine with all the crap. Wait 'til they get to YOUR house.
1306679066720980996 2020-09-18 03:39:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @secupp Based on what? Facts only. No 'he's a criminal,' or stupid name calling Give FACTS, not fifth-grade insults. Did he commit a crime? If yes, what statute? Enquiring minds want to know.
1306652421318496257 2020-09-18 01:53:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Don't forget the Dem governors. Ours (PA) got busted inflating the death count.
1306652051875786753 2020-09-18 01:51:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> They might want to take a look at him, too. Career FBI bureaucrat.
1306651778252001286 2020-09-18 01:50:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A lot of these Dems seem to be channeling their inner Goebbels.
1306644355680215041 2020-09-18 01:21:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> But PA Gov Tom Wolf issues new positive test reports every day. They're going up! Go figure.
1306635764533526530 2020-09-18 00:46:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is it me, or has the daily COVID positive test numbers shot up since the federal court bitch-slapped Gov Wolf? They release the "new cases" number every day.
1306635040621760513 2020-09-18 00:44:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Molon labe, motherfucker.
1306602098830774273 2020-09-17 22:33:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's like taking a shovel of sand off a full dump truck.
1306594219440574465 2020-09-17 22:01:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm going to print some copies of this and place them around my house to keep the mice away.
1306593246588485635 2020-09-17 21:57:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I like the guy, I just hope he doesn't back-pedal like he did on the anthem protest last season.
1306584486025469959 2020-09-17 21:23:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Spot on.
1306405274870218752 2020-09-17 09:31:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Right from Joe and Nancy. I've seen the videos.
1306399640112291840 2020-09-17 09:08:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Candace, I'm quite surprised you haven't done time in Twitter jail yet.
1306375706247606277 2020-09-17 07:33:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I was thinking a cemetery. After all, everyone there votes Democrat.
1306371079775162371 2020-09-17 07:15:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Right out of the Clinton playbook. When in doubt, take 'em out.
1306370330517266432 2020-09-17 07:12:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I wish he would switch CITIZENSHIP.
1306323214709256197 2020-09-17 04:04:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hillary's little pet and purveyor of liberal crap. It was fun watching him on election night. Looking like he found out there is no Santa.
1306301204511813632 2020-09-17 02:37:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @MikeKellyforPA Now we need to get his ballot order struck down. Imagine being forced to accept ballots when the signature doesn't match the name? He's out to steal the election.
1306294377589936129 2020-09-17 02:10:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hypocrisy at CNN??? Oh, the horror!
1306287900955471873 2020-09-17 01:44:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DebraMessing Epstein's best bud? Wrong president, that best bud would be Bill Clinton. Also why not try some facts instead of name-calling? I'm a retired detective, I will listen to facts, pro or con. And please don't just say "it's a fact," or "everyone knows."
1306281649248890882 2020-09-17 01:19:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I bet they're not really worried. They have been working on their story, over scotch, for weeks now.
1306280791010406401 2020-09-17 01:16:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets Well. Mom alway said "You have to be alive to complain."
1306280415410499586 2020-09-17 01:14:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Where did the "pretty" come from? Her mom?
1306279770544631808 2020-09-17 01:12:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> What made them sit out? Whatever it was, let's do it again. And again. And again........ I wish they would just "Hillary" their phones.
1306279381959159812 2020-09-17 01:10:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Gonna have to flip a coin. Anything gets their panties in a wad, and I find their hypocrisy at turns both amusing and disgusting.
1306278914856292354 2020-09-17 01:08:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @stephens_ben It was humor. I guess you have no problem with the videos that fit your narrative, like the Portland riots, the Kenosha riots, the LA riots, the Lancaster riot..... I could go on, but you should have got the point, even though liberals hate facts.
1306277844969050117 2020-09-17 01:04:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> My money is on "COVID." It's a two-for-one, he gets out of the debates, and keeps pushing the Dem narrative.
1306251906239672320 2020-09-16 23:21:38 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Along with Republicans, Independents, Libertarians.... I could go on, but you get the idea.
1306245398521143299 2020-09-16 22:55:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> ANY poll. They can steer them any way they want. Do two polls on gun control, one at an NRA convention and the other at UC Berkeley. Think the results will be the same? All polls are BS. Ask Hillary.
1306234432517558274 2020-09-16 22:12:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This should explain it all to people on the fence.
1306231288421068801 2020-09-16 21:59:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @notsleeeping @dhookstead That's from Fox. I want to see the numbers.
1306230944391667713 2020-09-16 21:58:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Maybe, but remember, these ratings are WITHOUT fans in the seats.
1306227759061127173 2020-09-16 21:45:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Only when I'm awake (at night, it's on the nightstand).
1306195202995085312 2020-09-16 19:36:18 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @dcexaminer @JoeBiden "Yeah, I'm hip with the young Spanish kids!"
1306194660000436224 2020-09-16 19:34:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @markknoller So if someone throws a Molotov Cocktail, it will be OK? I bet you didn't make this kind of comment on the riots.
1306027265369812999 2020-09-16 08:28:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Now (and then) a disgrace to the uniform. The fact that he only made it to 'light colonel' says a lot. He served his own interests, not our nation, a violation of his oath. When I retired, President Clinton was my CIC. I didn't vote for him, but I didn't betray him or my country.
1306026270208208896 2020-09-16 08:25:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Who cares?
1306014947680423936 2020-09-16 07:40:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @donlemon Obama's Nobel Prize? For what? The ultimate participation trophy.
1306014518665936901 2020-09-16 07:38:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CNN So if the crowd at the White House were looting and burning it would be OK? Someone please flush while this network is in the bowl!
1306003314203598849 2020-09-16 06:53:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Listen to this man. He gets it, and is non-partisan. Again Sean, I always appreciate your insight.
1305993738892779520 2020-09-16 06:15:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's why I like Jesse. He makes me laugh.
1305986487998128130 2020-09-16 05:46:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She is a liberal after all. She is a token, there to provide "balance," like Juan.
1305956617335328770 2020-09-16 03:48:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> We also can see that Joe can read, although he has Jill close, to help him with the big words.
1305951292880281600 2020-09-16 03:27:06 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @mikeroman Classic Dem move. Is he mad because this morning I tweeted at him that we're going red again in November? If it's my fault, I apologize, but maybe he's still stinging from being bitch-slapped by the federal court.
1305928517234851840 2020-09-16 01:56:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @tylerpager Private jets are awesome! Do they have stick-ons everywhere so Joe knows to flush the toilet, etc?
1305927972608765958 2020-09-16 01:54:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @chris_ellis @codeofvets @sciam Blinders on, eh? OK, so the Ukraine is technically no longer part of the old Soviet Union, or Russian. But there's no denying the Biden connection. You're comical. Your blind hypocrisy is amazing in its depth and scope.
1305927096427057152 2020-09-16 01:50:57 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Looks green to me. Joe's color, I mean. Maybe he had a rough flight?
1305923255480578048 2020-09-16 01:35:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @sunny Typical liberal. Nothing that resembles a fact, just name calling. You want Senile Joe in a slow pitch game, because you know he would lose a debate with a potted plant.
1305921262666027008 2020-09-16 01:27:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Dems aren't going to let him. They would have Harris doing it.
1305917379747213314 2020-09-16 01:12:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovTomWolf That's it governor, keep increasing the COVID positive test results. Predictable. Sorry, we're going red again in November.
1305913836348813313 2020-09-16 00:58:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovTomWolf And yes, governor, I am an officially recognized PA "super voter."
1305911780363907074 2020-09-16 00:50:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nytopinion @michelleinbklyn What about the "civil liberties" of the store owners? You know, the stores they trashed, burned, and looted?
1305911368340602880 2020-09-16 00:48:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Let's not leave PA Gov Wolf out of the conversation. 90+ percent of PA COVID deaths were in nursing homes. He also got busted over-reporting deaths.
1305910937984040966 2020-09-16 00:46:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> He will only play in a slow-pitch league.
1305910566381330433 2020-09-16 00:45:16 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I hope Cardi sees this. Not that it will sink in.
1305908636812742659 2020-09-16 00:37:36 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovTomWolf Classic, predictable Dem response. Accuse the opposition of doing what YOU are doing. You already got busted over-reporting deaths, and you leave out the fact 90+ percent of PA's deaths were in nursing home. That's on YOU. You, Cuomo, and Newsom,  all the same.
1305883172434071552 2020-09-15 22:56:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SenMarkey Either you haven't watched the video, or you're a liar. Ask Wheeler. He had to move. He found what Churchill said was true- Appeasement is feeding a tiger, hoping he will eat you last.
1305675087430012928 2020-09-15 09:09:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So much for POTUS being a racist, eh? The Native Americans suffered just as bad, if not worse than blacks. Blacks were enslaved, but not slaughtered. Thank you, Crow Nation, for setting an example for all.
1305669453762494465 2020-09-15 08:47:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Who let him out of the basement? You have to watch them closely, else they wander off.
1305662482803982338 2020-09-15 08:19:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> No accident, I'm sure.
1305662295700320256 2020-09-15 08:18:43 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Biden was the prime mover. He was a thirty-plus D.C. veteran, and BO was still wet behind the ears. I'm sure Joe, and Hillary schooled him. Looks like he was a star pupil.
1305661235027996673 2020-09-15 08:14:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden @NRA Molon labe.
1305660863874060288 2020-09-15 08:13:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @HillaryClinton Are you really that delusional? 9-11-12.
1305659921753665536 2020-09-15 08:09:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Democrats= Hypocrisy.
1305635650918645764 2020-09-15 06:32:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nflcommish Take the hint, Roger. It's not going to get any better. No fans at games, and ratings were still down? The clue phone is ringing. Answer it.
1305634678628667397 2020-09-15 06:28:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is he admitting they didn't do anything positive in eight years???
1305633376251060224 2020-09-15 06:23:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Our federal case ruling in PA against Comrade Wolf should stir things up. He's going to appeal, of course. With Cuomo and Newsom cheering him on.
1305625419404771329 2020-09-15 05:52:11 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @DonaldJTrumpJr Biden just hired Eric Holder? He's seen Holder work- Fast and Furious.
1305624117681557505 2020-09-15 05:47:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm sure Comrade Wolf, with Cuomo and Newsom backing him, will appeal. He granted over 6,000 exemptions right after his initial shutdown order. To the Harrisburg elite, I'm sure, along with his relatives and friends.
1305623440553119746 2020-09-15 05:44:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Certainly not the little black girl shot &amp; killed in Chicago.
1305621492777070593 2020-09-15 05:36:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Right on point. These are the guys who run TO the gunfire, not the gutless sheep who cower in their safe places. Be safe, brothers.
1305585366880194561 2020-09-15 03:13:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's what happens when you openly support rapists and cop killers.
1305570686988103681 2020-09-15 02:14:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealCandaceO A federal judge just ruled PA Governor Wolf's (D) pandemic restrictions were 'overreaching, arbitrary, and violated citizen's constitutional rights.
1305569845472366594 2020-09-15 02:11:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Because Biden would lose a debate with a potted plant.
1305548698299117571 2020-09-15 00:47:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Been ready for years.
1305537922976886786 2020-09-15 00:04:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That highlights the problem in this country- So many want everything for free. They have no idea what we went through. After retirement, I looked a liberal in the eye and told him- "I gave the best 20 years of my life to defend your right to spout stupid shit." He gave nothing.
1305522290143133697 2020-09-14 23:02:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NFL Seriously? You allow a rapist's name on helmets but not fallen officers? What happened to "Me Too?" A new low. Thanks for reminding me why I stopped watching.
1305509870284746753 2020-09-14 22:13:02 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @valdez310 @codeofvets It doesn't have to be another country to be under attack. The really sad part is the so-called journalists have abandoned reporting and turned to activism, stoking the flames.
1305509337746599937 2020-09-14 22:10:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GenieRoan @RealJamesWoods You never were. You're just a other nameless internet troll insulting people from the safety of mom's basement.
1305326335355768832 2020-09-14 10:03:44 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @shadihamid @TheAtlantic Too fucking bad for them. We will stand against them. Bring it. We will respond in kind. Ruck up, brothers.
1305289542400913410 2020-09-14 07:37:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NPRextra Josie gave up her 'protection' when she went from journalism to activism. Hack. Defund NPR!
1305289008243707904 2020-09-14 07:35:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ananavarro Sorry Ana, you (and Joe) can't run from video. There's   just no gettin' around it when we got it right from the horse's mouth (ass?) memorialized in digital recordings. I know, damn all those cameras!
1305266191624175617 2020-09-14 06:04:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I agree with the Trojan Horse theory. Less than a year in (if he's elected) Biden will step down for "health reasons," elevating Harris to the Oval Office.
1305247379147444224 2020-09-14 04:50:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @jeremiah4north You're delusional. You and your kind will never have proof, because you dismiss anything that doesn't fit your narrative.
1305230597686808576 2020-09-14 03:43:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Teflon.
1305223387564978176 2020-09-14 03:14:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Ilhan Thank you for making my day! I love good news. If they're being deported, it's for a reason. You liberals use the COVID like an amputee uses a crutch. I'm sorry, that comparison was disrespectful. To amputees.
1305222673472147456 2020-09-14 03:11:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @berniescoffer @codeofvets Zip it, scumbag. Spout your stupid shit somewhere else.
1305193279517007873 2020-09-14 01:15:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Jacob Blake- Where "Me Too" and "BLM" collided. BLM won (they had guns).
1305192768969551879 2020-09-14 01:13:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Already there.
1305192570054750210 2020-09-14 01:12:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Oh no, Mr. Woods. According to CNN &amp; MSNBC, all this crap started in the last three years. Before that, this country was a friggin' Utopia.
1305191869392064512 2020-09-14 01:09:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods The NFL denied the Dallas Cowboy's request to put the  names of fallen officers on their helmets. But rapists are OK. It makes me sick.
1305180747070951424 2020-09-14 00:25:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Why didn't he just give her a little nudge? Oops, I slipped and fell forward.
1305180431487246337 2020-09-14 00:23:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> You first.
1305180269188648964 2020-09-14 00:23:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Seahawks Stop stoking the flames. Where was BLM when a ten-year-old black girl was shot and killed in Chicago? Supporting an alleged rapist with a criminal history. Her life mattered far more than some street thug. You should be ashamed.
1305171725877993476 2020-09-13 23:49:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Soros, Bloomberg and co. Through numerous shell corporations, of course.
1305171179716648961 2020-09-13 23:47:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KellyO Oh, I get you. They're not burning, looting, vandalizing, and assaulting innocents, so it's not OK. You're so transparent it's pathetic. Why don't you resign from the propaganda bureau and try journalism?
1305168645748908032 2020-09-13 23:37:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NFL @Chargers @TyrodTaylor @J_ManPrime21 @Isaacrochell90 @wyche89 Use your celebrity and money OFF the field. We watch(ed) sports as a diversion. We get more than enough from CNN &amp; MSNBC. My house is now an NFL free zone. Sunday Ticket for free this year (I had it 15yrs), and DirecTV can shove it up their ass, I'm not watching. So can you.
1305167622938537984 2020-09-13 23:33:04 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Don't forget SOFT society. The land of the free and the home of participation medals.
1305166638187241474 2020-09-13 23:29:10 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm no doctor, and I don't even play one on TV. I've been taking them for decades. I expect people to know this, they teach it health class, it's in TV ads.... I wouldn't bang on him for not saying it until now.
1304924126931496961 2020-09-13 07:25:30 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Am I the only one who considered the fact "Mother Earth" is pissed off at California??? Take the hint, Nancy.
1304916485719175168 2020-09-13 06:55:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets @AGlobalCitizen P.S. Obviously Global Citizen has a "safe place" staked out.
1304915882217549824 2020-09-13 06:52:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> A lot of people say things like that until someone comes for THEM. Unfortunately the security provided by The Greatest Generation has made people soft. If the likes of WWII happens again, we're screwed. "Those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who don't."
1304875682519023616 2020-09-13 04:13:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Don't forget NFL, MLB, and something called the WNBA.
1304856152396697602 2020-09-13 02:55:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> And don't forget the NFL, MLB, and this thing I hadn't heard of before- the WNBA.
1304855736107913216 2020-09-13 02:53:45 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The only simple questions come from CNN &amp; MSNBC. Deer in the headlights.
1304845432942718985 2020-09-13 02:12:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @mkraju @CNNSitRoom 'Let's visit Chinatown... Come on down.' And stop by the salon on the way.
1304844310861492225 2020-09-13 02:08:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Remember, NFL Commish Roger is fine with this. This is not MY NFL. Kicked the habit after 40 years.
1304830627594809345 2020-09-13 01:13:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> RIP, brother.
1304799490440912897 2020-09-12 23:10:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GavinNewsom And every crisis is an opportunity, right governor?
1304798873836191746 2020-09-12 23:07:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I went active duty in '78 (age 17). We were just three years out of Vietnam, and got the same treatment. Life does come full circle....
1304553657271300096 2020-09-12 06:53:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nflcommish Fallen officer tribute stickers denied, but they can put felons names on their helmets? What the fuck is wrong with you?
1304553112397656068 2020-09-12 06:51:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I already swore off the NFL scumbags after 40 years of watching, but it seems they want to keep reminding me why.
1304544047894327296 2020-09-12 06:15:12 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump So you're into numbers. How many of those dead had an underlying morbidity? 94%. The overwhelming majority died in nursing homes, thanks to Democrat governors like Cuomo, Wolf, and Newsom.
1304542903830749191 2020-09-12 06:10:40 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @wiftrekutct @matthew_bishara @Johnny_Joey "Like" is quite a leap. A necessary evil. We gave the best years of our lives to protect your right to spout stupid shit. In half of the countries on this planet, you would be in a jail cell now. It's so true, so many of those we protected don't appreciate it.
1304530871756771332 2020-09-12 05:22:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @matthew_bishara @wiftrekutct @Johnny_Joey Matt- You forgot to recommend an English class that includes spelling.
1304519411123056643 2020-09-12 04:37:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Lying? Watch clips of Biden and Harris. You will have hours and hours of watching lies. Schiff, Pelosi and Schumer will give you a year of watching lies. You will know they're lying by comparing videos. 'I will ban fracking,' compared to 'I will not ban fracking.' It's on tape.
1304503727160688641 2020-09-12 03:34:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @wiftrekutct @matthew_bishara @Johnny_Joey Go back??? You're there.
1304458132509396994 2020-09-12 00:33:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CBS_Herridge @ChuckGrassley @JudicialWatch The Hillary defense. Tested effective.
1304457770213703680 2020-09-12 00:32:22 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @GovWhitmer How did you ever get elected? You have no place in government. Instead of ridiculous crap, you can't just say you disagree with POTUS? Where's your dignity? Or even the dignity of your office? In the trash, apparently.
1304453027533910017 2020-09-12 00:13:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Broncos Sorry, I no longer support any of you NFL hypocrites. So put me down for "against."
1304450551082606593 2020-09-12 00:03:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The entire Biden staff is delusional and tone-deaf. Sometimes I think Joe is the brains of the outfit, but then I watch a clip of him speaking.
1304214898101059586 2020-09-11 08:27:17 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins You might as well quit. Your network has zero credibility now. It's been proven with published facts, interviews, and video. You're in the toilet, waiting for the flush.
1304200940518506496 2020-09-11 07:31:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Acosta Good Lord, is there no end to your hypocrisy? You're such a hack. Yup, it's a peaceful protest.
1304173691828342784 2020-09-11 05:43:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> It's called "hypocrisy." That's her middle name.
1304161512781733897 2020-09-11 04:55:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @NYGovCuomo You're either delusional, or you believe that the bigger the lie, the better it is. You're scum.
1304157230204432384 2020-09-11 04:38:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden Who's doing the fear-mongering now? You're the classic, stereotypical two-faced politician. It's even harder to keep up with your lies, what with the severely diminished capacity, eh Joe?
1304108704921460738 2020-09-11 01:25:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Hypocrite. The Democratic Party is 'ten pounds of hypocrite in a five pound bag.'
1304107500808085505 2020-09-11 01:20:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Amen, brother. Sometimes it's not easy defending moronic sheep, but we swore to protect everyone, and that's what we did (I retired in '98).
1303838201979822081 2020-09-10 07:30:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KyleMas31946985 @RealCandaceO Spoken by a USDA Grade A piece of s**t. Crawl back into your hole.

1303785612093411329 2020-09-10 04:01:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @codeofvets Been ready. For years.
1303761332181889029 2020-09-10 02:24:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Perpetualmaniac What you need to do is stay the Hell out of it. We have laws, and a government for that. You're media, in no way part of government.
1303760643003211777 2020-09-10 02:22:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @msreala1 @joleelovesme33 @iamcardib @RealCandaceO So you're saying she is the first ever to switch parties?
1303726248296841222 2020-09-10 00:05:34 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So many forget vets are THE reason they can spout their crap and not get jailed for it.
1303719899915792385 2020-09-09 23:40:20 +0800 <Benjami28009328> This should make people think of Josef Goebbels.
1303541446730035201 2020-09-09 11:51:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Cardi is out of her league in a third grade spelling bee.
1303515429961371648 2020-09-09 10:07:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @LorraineDWilke @SarahHuckabee Give facts, not platitudes, and we'll listen.
1303502605549744130 2020-09-09 09:16:53 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CNN Seriously? Airbrushing the Redskins logo off the hat? You're not about journalism, you're the propaganda arm of the DNC. Oh, for the Lynn Russell era. I used to love your network. No wonder it's in the bowl, waiting for a flush. Despicable.
1303495453854572550 2020-09-09 08:48:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @greggutfeld This from a guy who can hide his own Easter eggs.
1303490913038225415 2020-09-09 08:30:26 +0800 <Benjami28009328> The Liberal Flock of Sheep? Not a chance.
1303466893915947009 2020-09-09 06:54:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @realDailyWire Only the best drugs for the DC Comics staff.
1303466734700167168 2020-09-09 06:54:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealJamesWoods You have to admit, they are comic book caliber figures.
1303438707681353728 2020-09-09 05:02:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Too bad he didn't tube the whole rag.
1303360989266612224 2020-09-08 23:54:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealCandaceO Reading from a script? I think you give Belcalis (Cardi) too much credit. Maybe someone was reading it TO her in her ear. I think she has trouble with big words.
1303360197520502786 2020-09-08 23:51:01 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @LaraLeaTrump @Twitter Almost? Is there any doubt? James Woods can absolutely verify it.
1303086622590803969 2020-09-08 05:43:55 +0800 <Benjami28009328> That's because he is a professional.
1303063828654100480 2020-09-08 04:13:21 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @joleelovesme33 @iamcardib Being a retired detective, I will always accept facts, pro or con. I would be very interested in facts that prove a traitor accusation. Lay them on me.
1303046109053546500 2020-09-08 03:02:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I want to draft Portland, and watch them against Kenosha. The NFL supports both teams.
1303042344363663360 2020-09-08 02:47:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Which is why the Democratic Party must be abolished, or at the very least renamed. Did anyone tell them all those statues they want removed are of Democrats?
1303041498666209282 2020-09-08 02:44:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @BalaamsWord I am so sick of musicians and actors. They mistakenly believe just because they made a lot of money signing, or pretending to be someone else, they're smarter, their opinions matter more, and they need to educate the ignorant masses. They preach from security patrolled compounds.
1303040040315105281 2020-09-08 02:38:49 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @TomJChicago Even if it were true, Biden makes him look like a rocket scientist. Joe could hide his own Easter eggs.
1303021961858215936 2020-09-08 01:26:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @neurotypicant @iamcardib I'm saying she needs to stick to entertainment. The Chipmunks sold a lot of records too, that doesn't make them pol-sci majors.
1303010524976885762 2020-09-08 00:41:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ChuckRossDC @carterwpage As a 20 year LE vet, I never saw an "over-worked" FBI agent. FBI stands for "Famous But Incompetent."
1303009488589512708 2020-09-08 00:37:25 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @iamcardib Watch the Malcolm X clip. Before you were born, he predicted you would do this.
1303009077744861191 2020-09-08 00:35:47 +0800 <Benjami28009328> She needs to see the Malcolm X clip. He predicted her coming.
1303008160224030721 2020-09-08 00:32:08 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @joleelovesme33 @iamcardib How is she a traitor? Give FACTS, don't just start name-calling. Oh, I forgot. That's the only thing liberals have. "To anger a conservative, lie. To anger a liberal, give facts."
1303007588565516291 2020-09-08 00:29:52 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @neurotypicant @iamcardib Cardi needs to go back to what she's good at- working the pole. Isn't that why she bought the bra-stuffers anyway? BTW, she should get a refund for that job.
1302996029407666176 2020-09-07 23:43:56 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Kaufon82 @RealCandaceO @iamcardib Yeah, but intellectually, Cardi brought a butter knife to a gunfight. Everything she has is on the outside.
1302995533385076737 2020-09-07 23:41:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Gross ignorance must be recognized. Tweet away, Candace.
1302995171009851399 2020-09-07 23:40:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Is anyone else as surprised as I am? Didn't they see the  service for Rep Lewis? Not a mask in sight. The rules are for US, not them. I guess COVID doesn't affect snakes.
1302985034593456133 2020-09-07 23:00:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Candace- When your baby gets old enough to be in school, run for US Rep. Please.
1302980140100710400 2020-09-07 22:40:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @iamcardib If you live in the US, he's your president too. Cardi, you made it painfully obvious you're not familiar with our education system.
1302966230064738304 2020-09-07 21:45:31 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JaniceDean Even if he didn't mean to, it was gross indifference. I still believe he did mean to. The elderly are old school Democrats, and don't approve of the new breed. They  vote, too. Criminally negligent.
1302965085569191936 2020-09-07 21:40:58 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @Christhisbitch @yoalexrapz @RealCandaceO @iamcardib Yeah, that's everyone's intelligence metric. I wonder how many music execs she had to "perform" on, er, for. That's what I meant, perform FOR.
1302964358033608710 2020-09-07 21:38:05 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @yoalexrapz @RealCandaceO @iamcardib Cardi Debate Candace? Cardi would lose a debate with a potted plant. Now if it was a contest working the pole, Cardi would win, hands (panties?) down. But she should, she has professional experience.
1302959758861897728 2020-09-07 21:19:48 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @WhitlockJason In a war of words? I'm sure Candace needs to remember to use small words, so Cardi understands.
1302959362240065540 2020-09-07 21:18:14 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @iamcardib I bet teen sales spiked when they found out you worked the pole.
1302958881707110400 2020-09-07 21:16:19 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @TheyCallMeWolfe @iamcardib @RealCandaceO Trump pander???? Maybe some, but not nearly like the Democrats. Biden, Harris, Warren.... They instantly drop flat on their backs and spread their legs for anyone who they think can vote (and many who can't).
1302958239072563201 2020-09-07 21:13:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @iamcardib You're SUCH a class act. If you so much time on your hands, why don't you go back to school and get your diploma? So what if you're the oldest fifth-grader?
1302957355240480775 2020-09-07 21:10:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @oliviakrauth So... Someone else makes it up and they just report it? Without confirmation? I think you're delusional. Hearst and Pulitzer started doing it before you were born. Look up "Yellow Journalism."
1302772610263134210 2020-09-07 08:56:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @iamcardib Go back to what you were (maybe) good at- the pole.
1302701779918950407 2020-09-07 04:14:42 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden You're delusional. I would say a liar, but you probably don't even understand what your handlers are writing for you. You haven't done shit in 47 years. Go away.
1302697114154274817 2020-09-07 03:56:09 +0800 <Benjami28009328> I'm a life-long Republican, and I didn't like McCain. Like Romney, he was a Democrat who said he identified as a Republican. McCain's POW time, and a high-ranking father got him a pass on a lot of things. He was only one of many. Anyone heard of Bennie Dexter?
1302695989145473025 2020-09-07 03:51:41 +0800 <Benjami28009328> So much for standing for what you believe in. Gutless, utterly gutless. This country is overpopulated by sheep.
1302688890705326083 2020-09-07 03:23:28 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @KamalaHarris So you would have us think all this crap started during the last three and a half years? BS! So why didn't Obama and Biden fix things in eight years? Biden didn't do shit in over 40 years in government.
1302613740379086849 2020-09-06 22:24:51 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @EmeraldRobinson The classic "You lie, and I'll swear to it." Seen it a few times in 20 years of law enforcement. If they will print lies, they will certainly speak them. When they're caught, they have to dig in. "That's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
1302319736336809986 2020-09-06 02:56:35 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @thebradfordfile Oh, the disrespect! Standing for hours!
1302266048067047426 2020-09-05 23:23:15 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @RealSaavedra Not this one (retired)!
1302235025694502913 2020-09-05 21:19:59 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @redsteeze I heard that was the charge for the event that started it. A woman called 911 on him.
1301967964732829703 2020-09-05 03:38:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @JoeBiden LIAR!
1301967651233824774 2020-09-05 03:37:32 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Biden and the Dems will have you believe everything that is wrong with this country happened in the last three and a half years.
1301875272451588097 2020-09-04 21:30:27 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @ESPNNBA @itsthebaldgirl @OmarESPN @garystriewski Who cares?
1301302481666945027 2020-09-03 07:34:23 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @michaelmalice She's dead.
1301273043600371713 2020-09-03 05:37:24 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @nflcommish So more piggie socks? When your ratings plunge, count me, a 40 year hard-core Pats fan among those NOT watching. Tell the prima donnas to protest on their own time.
1301272054956728331 2020-09-03 05:33:29 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @SpeakerPelosi You hypocritical hack. You have some nerve. YOU owe AMERICA an apology. Typical elitist hypocritical behavior.
1301215977384718336 2020-09-03 01:50:39 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @seanonolennon I always like your messages. Very thoughtful, insightful, and without political bias.
1301159500230131713 2020-09-02 22:06:13 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @thebradfordfile So where are the liberals shouting "Mee too!" Maybe they wore themselves out at the Kavanaugh hearings?
1300940137560526848 2020-09-02 07:34:33 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @TrumpWarRoom The consummate hypocrite.
1300939244144394240 2020-09-02 07:31:00 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @CillizzaCNN What else would you call mob violence, looting, and destruction of other's property? Guess I need a thesaurus.
1300860630971437057 2020-09-02 02:18:37 +0800 <Benjami28009328> @joshscampbell So you're saying the videos are fake? How come no night photos?
1300860162668933125 2020-09-02 02:16:46 +0800 <Benjami28009328> Not necessarily true. How many altercations that didn't end in death?
