1342891709898829826 2020-12-27 01:55:08 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @PhilCasale Not for nothing, 8 shows a night in fake rep does not help the issue.

1342233314355273729 2020-12-25 06:18:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Curious about what I mean when I say I'm making theater in VR? (I'll be posting this a whole lot)

1341624137182228482 2020-12-23 13:58:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Seems to me trump getting to tell everybody he fought to give americans more money might have been a part of the deal

1341257549400698881 2020-12-22 13:41:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Here is a whimsical, but I believe sincere rant from gordon craig banishing footlights circa 1905 and also my script moving forward for when someone complains about virtual theater  https://t.co/lOvPr22U7p

1341075913165987844 2020-12-22 01:39:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> People who give themselves tasks to keep themselves busy and then complain about how much work they have drive me absolutely bananas.
1340840812649861120 2020-12-21 10:05:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @snowak Birth of a savior for sure
1340767329886609414 2020-12-21 05:13:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Some of my most favorite artists in the world (incl. Mr Maltby below and the incredible Theresa Buchheister) are Pokémon voices so I think this will be very cool.

1340177816223166464 2020-12-19 14:11:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I really hope in 2021 everybody stops talking about their feelings

Just because you aren't popular enough to know anyone who was affected doesn't mean anyone needs to listen to your dumb sanctimonious mouth full of hair
1339768907368939520 2020-12-18 11:06:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Btw this is not a joke. She's not really on Twitter, but if you know her, don't mention this to her plz. Not til Xmas.

1339599456879038466 2020-12-17 23:52:53 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy Serious question: are there any movies you don't think are good?
1339592438734712833 2020-12-17 23:25:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @parker_gibbons I saw that tik tok and got psyched but the comments all read like your tweet or every 5th person would be like "now my apartment is covered in spiders" so I ran the other way.

1339383464722911232 2020-12-17 09:34:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> On this snowy night mid-pandemic I'm still able to do a freelance performance gig out of my home office because of tech so if you're still shitting on virtual live theater at this point I have to assume you haven't ever relied on theater for a paycheck.

1339244098214092803 2020-12-17 00:20:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 Right? This feels important. I somehow need it to be so. (this was after seeing pics of him on Bob Wilson's instagram looking absolutely perfect in a Bob Wilson show)
1339243451246899200 2020-12-17 00:18:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Is Willem Dafoe nice?
1338923451055267840 2020-12-16 03:06:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Sorry to use this platform for hate, but the person who was hired to be on camera for the Paylocity NY sexual harassment training has the worst gig in the world and absolutely fucking sucks at it.
1338908085675503616 2020-12-16 02:05:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I wish I could explain this to the part of my brain that gets so mad at me when a thing that should take a day takes a week
1338737016276717568 2020-12-15 14:45:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @earbox @JustSayXtian Well well well look who's got two rooms!
1338667998203219971 2020-12-15 10:11:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I honestly think it's telling that these "thinker" types obviously spend zero time talking with academics

1338575560151339008 2020-12-15 04:04:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This game continues to shape me insofar as every art thing I ever made is basically about lacking the skill to get past the first few levels but learning more every passing year about how crazy shit gets if only you could just beat em but you know you never will
1338521019284381696 2020-12-15 00:27:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I couldn't figure out how to get @LIV to work with my old version of beat saber and my quest 1 so I made my own mixed reality capture and it definitely works 100% perfect great no notes  https://t.co/NAKTgLllK9  https://t.co/cHPBHZMZ10

1338228164678606850 2020-12-14 05:03:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> At this point, the only metric for who my closest friends are is how deeply I am affected by the weird internet shit they send me.

1338181079694499840 2020-12-14 01:56:46 +0800 <kevinasarobot> "reducing the wages" this is such fucko nonsense
1338180972613873665 2020-12-14 01:56:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Yeah it sucks that people like to pay less for stuff. People should want to pay more for stuff because cultured
1338178936090599428 2020-12-14 01:48:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I havent watched the prom yet but I think it's okay that they hired movie stars to be in a movie

1337537849059635201 2020-12-12 07:20:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> this actually does a really good job of illustrating how software development feels
1337537373211652098 2020-12-12 07:18:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> later on, these buttholes are going to say they just wanted to make sure rules were followed, that they were doing due diligence because somehow we are to the place where actual sedition is just both sides-ism (help we are in hell)
1337534635732045826 2020-12-12 07:08:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> imagine asking an employee to accomplish something before jan 1

1337459304132120579 2020-12-12 02:08:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I said "holy shit" when he hit the button (but like a "oh man that's such a good and simple improvement on physical reality" holy shit)
1337458848177729536 2020-12-12 02:06:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Jesus fuckin christ @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor have you seen the outdoor dining setups?

1336442891015688192 2020-12-09 06:49:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @iBrews He opens it, and the snail says "what the hell was that about?"
1336442851757068288 2020-12-09 06:49:40 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @iBrews One day a guy hears a knock at his door. He opens it but doesn't see anyone. Looks down to see if there's a package or something but just sees a snail on his mat. He picks the snail up and tosses it in to his yard. 7 years later, the man hears a knock at the door....
1336394495999569920 2020-12-09 03:37:31 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blaine_stockton @sporksticks But for the record, you sound violent to me.
1336394451418292224 2020-12-09 03:37:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blaine_stockton @sporksticks Yeah ok I meant that you sound like a crazy person and I expect you behave like one too because you are going out of your way to present that way on Twitter but I think it's very clear that I wasn't threatening violence chief

1334657855425810432 2020-12-04 08:36:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I choose to enjoy this news from the angle that someone at WB said "you know what? Fuck it. 2021 is a loss. We're gonna go ahead and use this time to do some fuckin FIELD RESEARCH" and then set all the sliders all the way up. It's a mad scientist move through and through.

Do not care at all that when sig comes back it will be with the same playwrights as always (great ones!) doing the same shit (writing good normal plays). Was way more excited for Zooms

1328486620941651969 2020-11-17 07:54:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @EricJacobLarson No, that's rotgut. You're thinking of telephone dial mechanisms predating push-button tones.

1328152953551790083 2020-11-16 09:48:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Gonna be adorable when he apologizes for being a short-sighted asshat because his followers are kindly pointing out what a shitty, stupid, un-christian take this is. Shit like this is exactly why people think actors are idiots.
1327966814182191105 2020-11-15 21:28:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @EricJacobLarson No, that's crumb. You're thinking of what it's called when two old-fashioned gangs fight.

1325848057682997249 2020-11-10 01:09:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Stand up is theater insofar as it is live performance with the function of catharsis through a sequence of events or story.
1325847611484598273 2020-11-10 01:07:58 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Murky! Sports is competition, always. Theater is sometimes competition. Gameshows are sports played as theater. Harlem Globetrotters is theater dressed up as sports. Two jesters competing for the King's favor to survive is sports made out of theater.
1325844639627284480 2020-11-10 00:56:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Livestreaming a Zoom show:digital theater::stand-up comedy:meat theater - neither focuses on the utilization of their respective "space" as a primary dynamic component
1325843440102481923 2020-11-10 00:51:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton leaves out digital media wholly, not just semantically. I'm good to refer to it as "digital theater" if it'll calm yr bones.
1325843366018506752 2020-11-10 00:51:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Obviously, "can be recorded" is no longer a reasonable metric what with spatial computing and motion capture. Also, Benjamin was talking about mechanical reproduction which
1325839570865434626 2020-11-10 00:36:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Live streaming is now and has from conception been theater

1325479146764558336 2020-11-09 00:43:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 @Biden_Army I vote we start calling obligatory and value-less social occasions "romneys," like when you have a work birthday party for someone you don't care about or when your neighbor you have no relationship with takes you to lunch because you jumped their car battery for them

(that said, this was in response to one I saw from a person just a year or 5 younger than me - well in to their thirties - so also I think the olds are getting too comfortable again)
1325457736784556034 2020-11-08 23:18:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Every time someone is like GEN Z WILL SAVE US I think "nah we broke them with media overwhelm and now they're too busy turning their feelings in to weird little performances to make any real change" but they sure vote so that's good

1324380687655411712 2020-11-05 23:58:56 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Interesting thread, and in my elitism and intolerance I don't understand how these people they're talking about aren't humiliated and ashamed of themselves for this absolutely pathetic way of life
1324376542613524486 2020-11-05 23:42:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sald0gg I'm not, yet. I hear there is much kissing!
1324375282044882944 2020-11-05 23:37:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Among all of everything, this week some rad teens on the internet made a fan recording of a musical I developed some years back with some friends, and that is cool as hell.
1324373242983948288 2020-11-05 23:29:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> It's time for me to admit I have no idea what roguelite means

1324080529461911556 2020-11-05 04:06:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AshtonFoster That's the only clip! The effects are permanent. This happens every time I open my mouth now.

1323478444680896512 2020-11-03 12:13:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @noazark Holy shit.
1323367893573271560 2020-11-03 04:54:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Fair, open, even-handed and refreshing #TruthMatters
1323358076980908035 2020-11-03 04:15:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AshtonFoster Well that is horrible and I'm sorry.
1323312981086818304 2020-11-03 01:16:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Justin_Schmidt1 @blackoutpete 10000000% agreed.
1323300047967182850 2020-11-03 00:24:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BarbotRobot Just so I'm transparent here - I think these people are full of shit and just taking advantage of loopholes, at best. They don't deserve to be listened to because they don't have a point that isn't based on hate and fear. I just think we have to give em this one, not listen to em
1323294758672961541 2020-11-03 00:03:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BarbotRobot I'm frustrated by the fact that we expect them to understand why we protest but most of us (me included and especially) see this shit and are like "what are they even doing? What point are they making?" but they've been saying it over and over. We just hate it (because it's evil)
1323294384092291072 2020-11-03 00:02:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BarbotRobot I think - if I am being generous - they want us to be inconvenienced to understand their anger and frustration about the things fox has told them about our ideals - by cheering tr*mp, they are protesting against censorship and the quelching of their various liberties
1323293412058112002 2020-11-02 23:58:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete @Justin_Schmidt1 These folks are raging against the bs they are hearing on fox news, but just because they are protesting against something that isn't true or real doesn't make it not a protest.
1323293295284543489 2020-11-02 23:58:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete @Justin_Schmidt1 I hear this! But I've been to a lot of protests where the messaging was confused or unclear, and the only alignment was what we were against. BLM is perhaps a bad example because the messaging is clear and straightforward, but Occupy was a mess in terms of unification.
1323124788030803976 2020-11-02 12:48:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Justin_Schmidt1 I get that, but I haven't heard why they did it at all, and truth be told, I haven't looked it up. I'm not interested in what they're saying, but i mean, they must think they're saying something?
1323124441874837504 2020-11-02 12:47:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ChuckXL I mean, that's how it looks to me, but I also know those people are angry as hell (again, I do not think it is earned or legitimate at all) and I bet that many of them and theirs would say it was a protest. Honestly, all I've heard is that they did it - I haven't heard why.
1323124106221543433 2020-11-02 12:45:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @petestaiano Yes, that is fuckin annoying as hell
1323120506548195328 2020-11-02 12:31:25 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I dunno, I like it when blm protesters block traffic, so I am not mad that tr*mp followers did it. I'm mad they exist and I'm mad they think they are righteous; I don't think these are equivalent causes but organized peaceful protest is good, right?
1323100562649436162 2020-11-02 11:12:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LooNoons I'll never tell.
1323075758814908426 2020-11-02 09:33:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @KatieGonzo Nah, I never had a problem with him personally, but yes. How could he even?! How could any of them? Not making a great case for the whole breed, you know?
1323021728210190336 2020-11-02 05:58:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Holy shit, Terry Teachout blocked me - I know the dude has had a tough year, but what kind of fucking critic can't take criticism? Too bad, I really enjoyed his takes on jazz.  https://t.co/y2lMeZ6jRB
1322992587427487745 2020-11-02 04:03:07 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TerryTeachout1 @parabasis Theater critics making assumptions about politicians' intentions that are contrary to their whole platform based on "line readings" is the absolute stupidest shit I have ever heard in my life.
1322985511758290954 2020-11-02 03:35:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TerryTeachout1 What a good use of your platform, defending a man you claim not to support by assuming his intention is something kinder than anything else he says.
1322951216343748608 2020-11-02 01:18:43 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This is an astonishing art project and you should all put eyes on it.
1322736082962796544 2020-11-01 11:03:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy Well yeah, but your taste is impeccable.
1322724749450092544 2020-11-01 10:18:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @zaphodgjd This is the most important tweet on this god forsaken website
1322708151813263360 2020-11-01 09:12:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> How is it possible that Addams Family Values isn't on every list of greatest movies of all time? This movie absolutely slaps in every single department. If I ever made anything a tenth as good as this movie I would be so proud of myself I would never ever shut up.
1322662770903523328 2020-11-01 06:12:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Yeah yeah but I'M the asshole for thinking it's hopeless
1322545206122655751 2020-10-31 22:25:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @PrecGorgRalf We do not, man, that's my point. It's over!
1322403522932068353 2020-10-31 13:02:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Stop complaining about people complaining. If you get to use your dumb platform to say shit like "stay strong and vote!" then I get to use mine to say you sound like a moron for remaining hopeful that this dumb, broken system is just gonna right itself.
1322399746976350209 2020-10-31 12:47:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> That we have to hope for governing that rewards good, unselfish behavior in order to make change is the reason I have zero hope for our species

1322252714554892294 2020-10-31 03:03:08 +0800 <kevinasarobot> You ever wanna stop following someone because you've realized their particular brand of crazy on main is more annoying than interesting but it is also clear they are the type of person who tracks their unfollows and you'd rather not be on their radar at all?
1322056598785839104 2020-10-30 14:03:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Did you know "look I made a hat" and "god I need a job" scan the same? #sondheim #xr #ar #lensstudio #stockmesh  https://t.co/24R35h3S2g

Well done, @shudder. Keep it up. Everybody go watch Scare Me and fall back in love with stories.
1321869590620721152 2020-10-30 01:40:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> To be clear, yes I am a vegetarian, and yes it is for moral reasons so I will happily literally eat the rich when the time comes because they deserve it.
1321869426963189760 2020-10-30 01:40:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> It's crazy that the billionaires in that article aren't terrified of thousands of new yorkers flooding their home and roasting them on a barbecue
1321586732861706240 2020-10-29 06:56:45 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kitvolta What I wouldn't give to say "look! here is a thing where there wasn't a thing before!"
1321563370286419970 2020-10-29 05:23:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kitvolta For what it's worth, I am surrounded by incredibly prolific people and I don't know almost anyone who has finished more than 40% of a project since March, if it didn't have a specific, external deadline. Or so I keep telling myself as I start yet another unity project

1321288545110286337 2020-10-28 11:11:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I found the social media tipping point where my friends are checking in on me. I'M OKAY EVERYBODY, THE WORLD IS BAD BUT I AM NO CLOSER TO BREAKING DOWN THAN USUAL

1321285106435297280 2020-10-28 10:58:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BarbotRobot @Spocks_Brian Yes, absolutely recommend. It's excellent.
1321282523008303108 2020-10-28 10:47:56 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Often when I am working late I put Stop Making Sense on and it ALWAYS: wakes me up and puts a wiggle in my bottom and SOMETIMES: makes me want to give the fuck up because it is just so incredibly good

1321227381613408263 2020-10-28 07:08:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Spocks_Brian @BarbotRobot Ok but they have a lentil soup that is unreal
1321138886547046401 2020-10-28 01:17:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @GeoffGrimwood It's called Pol*t*cal Idol (asterisks because I am certain they search their own shit a lot) and they sponsored Broadway Briefing this morning.
1321133293430099971 2020-10-28 00:54:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @beakfriends Often I find that it's been so long since I've fixed a port that I will lose a day just on tutorials about removing bendy straws
1321129506623655938 2020-10-28 00:39:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I can't believe this guy wrote Scream
1321122782445490177 2020-10-28 00:13:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Someone make another joker movie but he's a progressive leftist and batman is a billionaire who believes he's above the law OH WAIT
1321119567624740866 2020-10-28 00:00:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @THTRNightmares My god he is committed to the bit
1321118228224057345 2020-10-27 23:55:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> But the producers? The writers? Like, if all you have to contribute to the world right now is entertainment, at least read the room you're entertaining. Distract us, for crying out loud - it's the end of the fucking world out here. People are dying, you fucks. Cutesy ain't it rn
1321118226366013440 2020-10-27 23:55:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I mean a job is a job, I get that, and I don't blame him for working, period. Sometimes being a professional actor means just showing up and doing the thing so you can feed your fam.
1321117237298843650 2020-10-27 23:51:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Holy shit I laughed out loud
1321116879738576901 2020-10-27 23:49:43 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Goddammit I just went to their Twitter and I used to improvise with one of the guys in the cast
1321115021280190466 2020-10-27 23:42:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Imagine being so detached and so privileged that you think a "hilarious musical parody featuring 23 songs &amp; a host of characters from this election" is what people want right now. Theater people are the absolute worst.
1321105521630470146 2020-10-27 23:04:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @elepiech You should be following @yarwadnyc for sure
1321105189244489731 2020-10-27 23:03:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I think the saddest most desperate and pathetic thing is when people put something next to their name on Twitter so at first glance it looks like they are verified. I am actually just jealous and I wish my priorities looked like that.

1320863642888347650 2020-10-27 07:03:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Dude is diagnosed bipolar, and you making fun of him is just telling on yrself that you've never seen or understood a manic episode. Don't vote for Kanye. Do support mental health care.
1320863012383764481 2020-10-27 07:00:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Hey so imma be a guest on @yarwadnyc 's stream tonight - starts at 8, but I'll be joining late, coming in right after therapy. Come see me at my rawest!   https://t.co/5QOYmJCL9S
1320814513139187717 2020-10-27 03:48:14 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @brettwean That IS classy!
1320812267924049922 2020-10-27 03:39:18 +0800 <kevinasarobot> What's the classy way to tell people that someone they are interested in working with has a history of stealing intellectual property?
1320809521644785666 2020-10-27 03:28:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @xoxogossipgita Could it be a function of his star wars contract? By the third one or whatever, he may have earned a blank check project. Also, I hear you re: toxic work enviro but I feel like superhero shit somehow overrides ppl's brains. Like maybe he really just wants to play Moon Knight?
1320780955326599176 2020-10-27 01:34:53 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Holy shit
1320779690450292745 2020-10-27 01:29:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Someone got paid for this during pandemic (but tbh their follow-up tweet just about redeems)
1320739624185155584 2020-10-26 22:50:39 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Like a great poem, this walkthrough slowly reveals itself, but never fully. It answers some questions, but asks dozens more.
1320572361310130177 2020-10-26 11:46:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> And unsurprisingly, here's Palmer Luckey being a fucking selfish dork
1320539654538612739 2020-10-26 09:36:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Is there a word yet for the panic that hits in the moment between a loud fart and confirming that you are, in fact, muted on the zoom?
1320482665045413891 2020-10-26 05:49:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Been tweeting a lot because I'm depressed as shit and so because the universe rewards unhappiness, I've gotten a bunch of new followers. So let's be clear as possible: trans rights.
1320468454567256064 2020-10-26 04:53:07 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sandwichJOY @keithfosterkid Vladimir the Impaler has the same amt of syllables as Alexander Hamilton
1320460115582078985 2020-10-26 04:19:59 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @HermitGaming2 I stepped firmly out of my lane on this, I see.
1320426368891523072 2020-10-26 02:05:53 +0800 <kevinasarobot> The Mortal Kombat barks were the "MY WIIIFE" and "DO I MAKE YOU HORNY BABY" of my generation. They still slip out a couple of times a month and I haven't played any MK in at least 10 years.
1320423596846731265 2020-10-26 01:54:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> If snakes don't need legs then dragons don't need wings
1320420655754600451 2020-10-26 01:43:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @VPBoyle It's this kind of thinking that has highschoolers playing Evan Hansen and Regina George! Actually, I don't think I have a problem with this example. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU!
1320410887560351748 2020-10-26 01:04:22 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Abnoring. I like it. It's abnorable.
1320410797261074434 2020-10-26 01:04:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I didnt know the word "aborning" so I googled it, but it took my dyslexic ass almost 3 minutes to realize the word wasn't "abnoring" which I said out loud no less than 5 times trying to find its definition.
1320410359828799488 2020-10-26 01:02:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Whoa. There can still be good news? Cool.
1320408199401537541 2020-10-26 00:53:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @itsdlevy This is wild. I will be thinking about this for weeks.
1320402297244012551 2020-10-26 00:30:14 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @itsdlevy Is this on a printed sleeve?!
1320176580900065280 2020-10-25 09:33:19 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I believe it's fake Melania but I also bet they've been hiring inner circle body doubles for like 30 presidents by now
1320147783467282437 2020-10-25 07:38:53 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Now is a great time for me to remind youse that I was lucky enough to direct a world premiere @willarbery short @ the old Flea space. It was right after the 2016 elex and I would've quit but Will wrote the only series of words that could've felt worthwhile so I didn't &amp; I'm glad.
1320145678132281352 2020-10-25 07:30:31 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jeremyoharris @willarbery @DanyaTaymor Yall are fuckin magical. Thank you for the show.
1320145586495029248 2020-10-25 07:30:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> The internet is more important more effective and more accessible than Broadway has ever been and if you as a producer are not taking that in to account, you're dumber than you look
1320127367839350785 2020-10-25 06:17:45 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Wow I guess I tweet a lot when I'm in a bad mood
1320127275019501571 2020-10-25 06:17:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Honestly it's barely even about the crime. People as committed to being able to do whatever they want by virtue of permanent privelege should just be wiped the fuck out entirely. Bully them early or execute them later, I say
1320126999487184897 2020-10-25 06:16:18 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Solitary is inhumane, this man should be murdered in public
1320125226936664071 2020-10-25 06:09:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Just a heads up, XR Twitter - comedy Twitter just found out about the Google AR animals.
1320123752865214464 2020-10-25 06:03:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> ok, it has come to my attn that she actually bought that amazon stock with federal pandemic relief money, and not years ago when everyone in books was buying amazon stock. I take it back. Let em fuckin burn. Go online and buy from McNally.
1320111189221924864 2020-10-25 05:13:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @willpurpura Never bring a knife to a mallet fight
1320110063999209479 2020-10-25 05:09:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> If you ever dated someone and it didn't work out but you liked each other a lot I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOLLOWING THEM ON TWITTER #subtweet
1320107108319285250 2020-10-25 04:57:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @david_j_roth Jesus christ I just yesterday got so far in to pandemic brain that I said out loud "it's too bad we can't go to Video Dynamics" to someone who did not grow up in Ridgewood and did not understand the reference. Had not thought of those two words together in years.
1320105073406582787 2020-10-25 04:49:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @astorian_alice Hell yes, thank you!
1320076268004691973 2020-10-25 02:54:42 +0800 <kevinasarobot> if you support the nypd, you're a piece of shit, too
1320072580712288264 2020-10-25 02:40:03 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Get iiiiiit
1320072325354631172 2020-10-25 02:39:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I understand it is biology and age, but I'm gonna need you to support me when I say this pandemic has really sped up my hair loss
1320071429841367040 2020-10-25 02:35:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TheeBeardedBard @f00n Well yeah, cuz there is no substantial user base yet. No reason for anyone to try and get the attention of the VR-using population because we total an insignificant amount of people. I agree, btw, the backlash to the required acct is weird BUT so is the guest acct issue.
1320065406535716868 2020-10-25 02:11:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @willpurpura Dear diary,  Today a stand-up comic beat me up. Tomorrow, I begin my training.
1320060983264542727 2020-10-25 01:53:58 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I respect yall for phone banking and I love your success stories and I am always kind when I get the texts asking for donations, but also honest - i am not gonna donate to any candidates because I believe we are at the end of the species &amp; my unemployment check is going to food.
1320057943694446592 2020-10-25 01:41:53 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I've shared before, but mine was Spider-Man in Manhattan shortly after 9/11, when the new Yorkers start throwing shit at green goblin in the tram rescue scene. Absolutely bananas, legit thought the cheering would not stop. (I don't remember a butterfly scene in Jojo rabbit)
1320056932309389312 2020-10-25 01:37:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I think if you are trying to do shit you learned in an empathy workshop with people who weren't in that specific workshop, you look and sound like a sociopath. I do not trust these workshops. I do believe they are making division worse. I do not trust the phrase "hold space"
1320047186692968454 2020-10-25 00:59:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kentbye @VRChat @mikecsalmon Is that 5 hours?
1320037596421042178 2020-10-25 00:21:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This was meant as a joke, but working theater people are better at sniffing out a toxic/abusive position from a promising job listing than anyone I know
1320036680733282311 2020-10-25 00:17:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MegsOMalls And now it's in all of ours. Sorry to say it Meg, but your tweet is an act of #spite.
1320036483668070400 2020-10-25 00:16:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> In looking at job listings this morning I said "oh fuck that, no" out loud three separate times. I can't think of a better expression of what I have tangibly learned from a career in theater.
1319861330451533824 2020-10-24 12:40:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
1319792803787001857 2020-10-24 08:08:19 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Watching this over the pre-show for Heroes of the Fourth Turning
1319749423136722945 2020-10-24 05:15:56 +0800 <kevinasarobot> My office has a standing desk, and a chair across the room. I take little breaks in my chair but lately my cat takes them with me and now they are becoming longer than I want. Best standing desk perch recommendations so I can have a lap while I work when I need to offer one?  https://t.co/XXmnnhVzMU
1319748389211353089 2020-10-24 05:11:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> And anyway, the place is expensive and the staff is rude and probably they sell more socks than paperbacks, but I'd still rather have them here than not.
1319748132431929344 2020-10-24 05:10:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I'm not saying Wyden is good - I have no idea. Union busting is bad. But owning Amazon stock when you are an indie bookseller mostly just says you've been an indie bookseller for a while.
1319736404419764224 2020-10-24 04:24:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Is the strand books website down for everybody else, too?
1319736182952108032 2020-10-24 04:23:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @bpowtweets Very wonderful work, friend.
1319734410128822274 2020-10-24 04:16:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @VPBoyle I want to see him play the part and I will die on this hull. If I was willing to buy in to 90210, I'll buy in to this.
1319727103923847169 2020-10-24 03:47:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JuziDarden "yet"
1319694419432493058 2020-10-24 01:37:22 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Buy something
1319694201219592193 2020-10-24 01:36:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Tried to tell you
1319653621831794690 2020-10-23 22:55:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JessCannizzaro When people say "the city is a character in the story" this is what they mean. The city is an obnoxious snotty teen proving its points in the most grating possible way. Omg the city is holden caulfield
1319454330173509638 2020-10-23 09:43:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jennyjaffe Someone get this tweet a peabody
1319424427004657664 2020-10-23 07:44:31 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @itsdlevy well then I guess so am I
1319423682499006466 2020-10-23 07:41:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @itsdlevy But David I want to see this I really want to see this
1319413106972516355 2020-10-23 06:59:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> The dude is 105 years old and we all watched a (rad) video of him falling over like a chump. His hand is discolored cuz when you're that old and you fall hard, your shit is bruised. He's probably not necrotic. #probably
1319300719607009280 2020-10-22 23:32:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimothyPlatt @LilTheTrill @bransonreese @jeremylevick Sorry but I work in a university bookstore and it is our civic duty to tell 14 year olds with old souls and a commitment to classic lit to buckle up
1319295658252091392 2020-10-22 23:12:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @E5CHA @DescriptApp Uh, this is witchcraft (extremely dope witchcraft)
1318678438392307712 2020-10-21 06:20:14 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AbeGoldfarb Man he looks so much like Cole Escola in that entrance medium shot (also yes thank you for shining a light on this wonderful movie I had totally forgotten about)
1318677192700735488 2020-10-21 06:15:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Flipping thru my Spolin before Zoom class screaming "THIS DOES NOT APPLY" over and over again desperately missing shared physical space
1318672586956509184 2020-10-21 05:56:59 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @aJoostEggermont @NicolasMenard Oh my god, this is a masterpiece
1318665019924631553 2020-10-21 05:26:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> It's also like 2 years old
1318663621971410945 2020-10-21 05:21:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> My $150 chromebook has a touchscreen and doesn't hurt my neck
1318622079495901184 2020-10-21 02:36:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kentbye @templedsc And one class I'm teaching (with @iBrews and @DavidGochfeld, which is the same group @bpowtweets is teaching) is collaborative with other depts by nature - it's a Tisch-wide class with students in the game design and creative collaboration depts. Acting class has no collab.
1318621643728547840 2020-10-21 02:34:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kentbye @templedsc Yes, I've been using Hubs and Altspace (with some dalliances in the new, non-vr high fidelity spatial audio platform) - for the performance class, I am not having them build anything. For another class geared twd producing work, they are doing some light building.
1318597795570384897 2020-10-21 00:59:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kentbye @templedsc Acting
1318595874172424200 2020-10-21 00:52:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Solari2600 Shared to a talking heads group on FB (shut up) and it's going well  https://t.co/o1ncHNalD4
1318421383156801538 2020-10-20 13:18:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> You're telling me an acid washed these jeans? REMEMBER TWITTER BEFORE?!
1318317527655731202 2020-10-20 06:26:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I would rather die than share a planet with this beautiful terrorist
1318317032367136776 2020-10-20 06:24:08 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MaraWilson Sounds like a John Mellencamp lyric.
1318271202755051520 2020-10-20 03:22:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @GianmarcoSoresi If you didn't use "cooked up a comedy special" in your press emails you have wasted this whole pandemic.
1318270691498774529 2020-10-20 03:19:59 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Hello to my students
1318270406730592258 2020-10-20 03:18:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @mynameisntdave Hey these are all great and also, how is the sound so good? What are you using?
1318265862135087104 2020-10-20 03:00:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BryanChrisBrown But i too have never looked in to it, tbh
1318265796133609472 2020-10-20 03:00:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @BryanChrisBrown I suppose if we agree that punk is a culture of anger directed at facilitators of oppression, then it's the vaguely anarchistic ethos of "information wants to be free," and various other watchcries from 2600 magazine?
1318010705606512641 2020-10-19 10:06:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LooNoons  https://t.co/nJjOc82Jk6

1317873230171017222 2020-10-19 01:00:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Hi I can't speak to this production, but this musical is my favorite bit of art in history
1317872777773371394 2020-10-19 00:58:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TheLastAmanda @PrecGorgRalf You're right! It's all the worst parts of acting combined! ♥
1317865006298529793 2020-10-19 00:27:56 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @slaneyrosej Honestly we will never know
1317854561877528577 2020-10-18 23:46:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Still waking up every day this month glad that something finally killed halloween
1317847363055177728 2020-10-18 23:17:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @samanthagwolfe Queerskins: Ark was easily the best XR dance piece I've seen, no contest.
1317846992052170755 2020-10-18 23:16:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Twittr should have a function that allows me to tweet only to people I don't know offline. How am I gonna talk shit if my fuckin friends are watching
1317669433758912515 2020-10-18 11:30:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @anthojackso If we're all geniuses then gd it so are they
1317649316522196992 2020-10-18 10:10:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @brendanAbradley Thanks! Figuring it out!
1317618383567884290 2020-10-18 08:07:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vinceschiavelli No I know I know what improv is. I'm saying this is actually better than most improv but equally as stupid
1317617845258362880 2020-10-18 08:05:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @PrecGorgRalf Okay, but to be clear, I still think everybody sucks and I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL, RALF
1317608118705074179 2020-10-18 07:27:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vinceschiavelli No, it's well executed dumb shit. Arguably better than half-assed dumb shit (no, not all improv is half assed; yes, most bit shows are)
1317589312398086145 2020-10-18 06:12:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy We are flawed individually, so we owe it to ourselves to criticize the collective. I can love/hate two equally dumb things, but I simply. will. Not. Abide a hundred comics doing that together.
1317589079802941441 2020-10-18 06:11:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy FOOOOOOR REEEEEEAAAAAAL
1317587666876174338 2020-10-18 06:05:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @guiltypanacea @AndyKindler Honestly I'm not convinced he isn't somehow involved.
1317586509785169921 2020-10-18 06:01:18 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy And all those things deserve derision OR respect is all I'm sayin!
1317585912570761219 2020-10-18 05:58:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sonicdork I guess what I'm saying here is I am a fan. I disagree with the philosophy but I appreciate the discourse. Milk is the dad? Hard to disprove.
1317583540125638656 2020-10-18 05:49:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> You seriously wanna tell me this is dumber than literally any bit show at the dcm? If this came from a bkln darling alt comic yall would be worshipping at it AND YOU KNOW I AM RIGHT
1317575046035013637 2020-10-18 05:15:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Gosh I am just so angry about everything happening on earth
1316935378784440320 2020-10-16 10:53:56 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete I laughed out loud at this
1316935217760915456 2020-10-16 10:53:18 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JulieAbridged Ok but that choreo is tight!
1316932273279799296 2020-10-16 10:41:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JulieAbridged Fuck I meant to post this from my musical theater-focused novelty acct but here we are
1316932044086251520 2020-10-16 10:40:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JulieAbridged This is erasure of your most stalwart fan base and I'm confident I speak for all of us here primarily for MT content that the only way you can make this up to us is by posting the video
1316930981883006977 2020-10-16 10:36:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @itsdlevy @RLindnerLolong Nor do they want to encourage the writing of original scores for musicals, it would seem.
1316913244909568003 2020-10-16 09:25:59 +0800 <kevinasarobot> What will it mean to people when Aaron Tveit wins the last Tony award?
1316844219634511873 2020-10-16 04:51:42 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ladyespii I mean that is 1000% fair. I liked the production, but I certainly wouldn't advocate for it being produced AGAIN. We've def seen enough salesmen die. Attention has been paid.
1316838542379749376 2020-10-16 04:29:08 +0800 <kevinasarobot> To be clear, great production. It should have been streaming this whole time is all. It should not be big news when we get a chance to see a shitty flatscreen version of a play. It should be standard.
1316838242562568193 2020-10-16 04:27:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> That this constitutes big theater news is extremely bad theater news
1316836888959950850 2020-10-16 04:22:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Wait they are seriously going ahead with the Tonys? Fuck that.
1316768743259865091 2020-10-15 23:51:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ThisJamesCoker @jeimicke Better.
1316754078454681600 2020-10-15 22:53:31 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Ay theater folks, what are the most non-traditional, tech-heavy shows you've seen/made?
1316535686594547712 2020-10-15 08:25:42 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Guys it's a fundraiser things are priced way above market rate that is how gala fundraisers work this is an org that spent 40 mil to renovate the lobby
1316442751781793792 2020-10-15 02:16:25 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @emilyvdw It truly sucks how undervalued schlamme is by way of his associations.
1316410476604067843 2020-10-15 00:08:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Aidan_Wolf Yes yes yes
1315824315636604929 2020-10-13 09:18:58 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @KevinMackArt @andreeavr I for one would like to hear more about 1963.
1315796104546603009 2020-10-13 07:26:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Let them never return
1315778643663228929 2020-10-13 06:17:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @RichardPapp10 This was the first thing my partner said to me! She was like "you gonna make the chipmunks AR objects or you gonna recreate the whole thing in VR so you can play on it?" and I was like YOU DON'T KNOW ME GET OUT OF MY HEAD
1315777031863504899 2020-10-13 06:11:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> And I would be hard pressed to name a bigger influence on my career than the designers at Ideal Toys, I guess.
1315777030970060802 2020-10-13 06:11:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> There are a bunch of fly-in pieces on string like clouds and spaceships and fish and shit, which again, if you've seen my work...friends, my 10,000 hours of playing with The Chipmunks Curtain Call Theater tangibly shaped my "voice"
1315776507269337090 2020-10-13 06:08:59 +0800 <kevinasarobot> It COMES WITH a bench and a ladder which is huge if you have ever seen any of my shit on stage (spoiler for those who haven't, I love benches I love ladders)
1315776168474353676 2020-10-13 06:07:39 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Impulse bought a childhood toy on ebay and folks we found my origin story  https://t.co/9UkRVUT2Lo
1315328959983292417 2020-10-12 00:30:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Not a cell phone in sight. Just living in the moment. Wish we could go back.

1315157041640542211 2020-10-11 13:07:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ThisJamesCoker ?!
1314967189598990336 2020-10-11 00:33:03 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ChasLiBretto It was this very logic that made me excited about your work in the first place
1314965461487046661 2020-10-11 00:26:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @lucybrrt Did these ever get made available? They are quite wonderful and I'd like to own one!
1314964523598721024 2020-10-11 00:22:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JWCrump Well it's about goddamned time (for the rest of the world to learn what we all knew)
1314586391611953152 2020-10-09 23:19:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @RichHuntTemp  https://t.co/INTQCwFoGo
1314557407788503040 2020-10-09 21:24:43 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules I in fact had not seen it. I am now a different person.
1314557086534119424 2020-10-09 21:23:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules I need a week to unpack this. Oh thank you so much. (Ed Helms would make a pretty strong j pierrepont finch)
1314556475600183305 2020-10-09 21:21:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules OH HOLY SHIT
1314556435230003202 2020-10-09 21:20:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules OMG SVU
1314555956072787971 2020-10-09 21:18:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules WHAT
1314555899445473281 2020-10-09 21:18:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules KATHLEEN
1314551729959174145 2020-10-09 21:02:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Brennanator Many of our interests align until then, for sure.
1314422076262973440 2020-10-09 12:26:58 +0800 <kevinasarobot> No Broadway AND no debate? WHAT WILL WE WATCH
1314419547403964416 2020-10-09 12:16:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Great advice from a person with a small amount of talent and a smaller amount of success! (he's got a special coming out on Prime go find it and bookmark and prove me wrong)
1314359559281143808 2020-10-09 08:18:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Listen, I know the Lincoln Project does not have my best interests at heart, but this is fucking SO good.
1314233069889560576 2020-10-08 23:55:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton Guess who  https://t.co/kIUZrV4s5A
1314211494209318912 2020-10-08 22:30:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton PIER 1 WENT OUT OF BUSINESS?!
1314210504391364609 2020-10-08 22:26:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ParkerDenton The moment we have perfected the "click anything on the screen to buy it" technology, the last 10 years of advertising is going to make a lot more sense.
1314026182808137729 2020-10-08 10:13:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> For real, they need to hire a comedian to moderate.
1313951239869259780 2020-10-08 05:16:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 Just spewing super pro-trump bullshit
1313949055098269696 2020-10-08 05:07:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Fuuuuuck Mamet. Dudes been completely irrelevant for years artistically, why would anyone even consider listening to him, like, as a person? Honestly, why would anyone have listened to him as a person when he WAS relevant as a playwright?
1313948742358368256 2020-10-08 05:06:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Duh
1313515430896697345 2020-10-07 00:24:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @macwrites The acceptable behavior for Infinite Jest is to read it, immediately discard the book, and never tell anyone you read it. Just be ready to mention it in passing anytime someone brings up footnotes.
1313195054115291136 2020-10-06 03:11:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kitvolta Finally a kinsey scale for the rest of us
1313193352578453507 2020-10-06 03:04:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @SheIsHansson CAN NOT
1313190593141633030 2020-10-06 02:53:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> They're both trash, btw. Just so we are clear. Both these men are trash piles.
1313190505669431304 2020-10-06 02:53:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> If you don't live in the city, you don't know what this is really about and you should please please shut the fuck up
1313189981901463552 2020-10-06 02:51:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JoeSchiappa I'll retweet you the moment you post something funny.
1313188411977674758 2020-10-06 02:44:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @lilsmichelle Feed plant?
1313186900132462592 2020-10-06 02:38:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> At this point, my tl is about 30% comedians, 70% XR ppl. An effect of this is I will see like 50 comics make variations of the same joke with almost no response, then an XR person will make the joke, but badly, and like 200 XR geeks are like "😂😂🤣🤣 omg DEAD"
1313185726817808384 2020-10-06 02:34:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Not to get all "who watches the watchmen" but I'm real worried about all our therapists
1313172140770942987 2020-10-06 01:40:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @FDRLST Fuuuuuck you
1313144127371055107 2020-10-05 23:48:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AbeGoldfarb Also how did he age in to looking like young Paul Newman?
1312984239680507904 2020-10-05 13:13:31 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LooNoons Holy! Shit. What? A wank!
1312983962617352194 2020-10-05 13:12:25 +0800 <kevinasarobot> this is not how I envisioned evolution but my transhumanism has now shifted to include THE extremely real  possibility of an intelligent species of FUCKING MUPPETS HOLY COW
1312964563441250305 2020-10-05 11:55:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Holy shit what a week
1312618475123335168 2020-10-04 13:00:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> does anybody have bill barr's cell number? I have some stuff I'd like to say to him
1312604968025821185 2020-10-04 12:06:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LooNoons Oh my god! THIS is boning?
1312575220381876225 2020-10-04 10:08:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @GeoffGrimwood wow ok
1312538928067436544 2020-10-04 07:44:00 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Oh my god this is boring
1312528888732422146 2020-10-04 07:04:07 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @werqinggirl This movie absolutely ruled my world in middle school. Amazing cast just absolutely fucking selling the shit outta that movie.
1312470036649447424 2020-10-04 03:10:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @bpowtweets This is an extremely intelligent and forgiving way to say brands are exploiting data-driven responses to creative expression, but I would rather see it your way!
1312465726679052288 2020-10-04 02:53:08 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Does anyone have any data about whether those follow-up ads to viral tweets actually work? Sheer curiosity.
1312447083081658369 2020-10-04 01:39:03 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Is his brother still dead?
1312438361202651136 2020-10-04 01:04:23 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AshtonFoster My god, "life is as confusing as an episode of glee" is THE line.
1312434369307574272 2020-10-04 00:48:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @GianmarcoSoresi Atamanuik and Baldwin's Maine Pub House is a bad name for a bar, but I'd go.
1312433714316496897 2020-10-04 00:45:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @fivarstories Thanks!
1312433149989785602 2020-10-04 00:43:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @fivarstories Link's broken
1312433002950074370 2020-10-04 00:43:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jaredsaltiel I had to Google it!
1312432198348345345 2020-10-04 00:39:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AndyKimy Smiling is just flashing your skelly
1312430135237324808 2020-10-04 00:31:42 +0800 <kevinasarobot> At this point I can't even remember who it was who nevertheless persisted
1312429013273645056 2020-10-04 00:27:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Saw at least two people get big mad about folks saying rbg should've retired who then immediately tweeted gleefully about yesterday's events. I'm not saying they're wrong, but they're being obnoxious.
1312427629094543361 2020-10-04 00:21:45 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @iangambier I for one would destroy acres of forest for a sandwich as tasty as that looks.
1312216611412156418 2020-10-03 10:23:14 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @magswahl HOLY. SHIT. YOU GOT IT?!
1312184764099510273 2020-10-03 08:16:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AshtonFoster Sure, though I think that's a separate thing than what I said. The original (sub)tweet was about how if a person is largely regarded as an asshole and then says they didn't get a job because of an overly meticulous hiring process, it might actually be because they are an asshole.
1312147067771351040 2020-10-03 05:46:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete Fairly well!
1312142722753425409 2020-10-03 05:29:38 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Don't take someone who didn't get a job on their word as to why they didn't get the job.
1312129373349134338 2020-10-03 04:36:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jasonawest @a1fie1 @JonahBluth @yankyluke @grumpypostie @Metro_Sport You are, I just think you're desperate and sad in how you are feebly expressing it
1312126402863357952 2020-10-03 04:24:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jasonawest @a1fie1 @JonahBluth @yankyluke @grumpypostie @Metro_Sport This Jason dude sure needs to win an argument on Twitter. What a sad little win he wants. What a sad lil guy.
1311799425711439877 2020-10-02 06:45:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @AntonHand Real question: if you value the crunch, is there an acceptable replacement for that element?
1311790988046864385 2020-10-02 06:11:58 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @alisiamartinez_ Oh no
1311756322795290624 2020-10-02 03:54:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @hellorobreese Hell yeah! Psyched to hear your thoughts. 730 eastern here, please:  https://t.co/gKCET9xSmI
1311756213995134979 2020-10-02 03:53:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @bpowtweets Truly the best. If you can make it at 730(eastern), we will be here:  https://t.co/gKCET9xSmI
1311727878409723907 2020-10-02 02:01:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @RSTStatusReport Wonderful! Come on by at 730 EST:  https://t.co/gKCET9xSmI
1311724224365592577 2020-10-02 01:46:40 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vozos was hoping you'd be interested! 730pm, please!   https://t.co/gKCET9xSmI
1311724112579112966 2020-10-02 01:46:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @therealjustlike 7:30 Eastern Standard Time! Thanks and see you then!  https://t.co/gKCET9xSmI
1311720346509365249 2020-10-02 01:31:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> If you want to check it out, we are doing a load test at our virtual theater tonight - if you've got a phone or laptop and want to try and crash a theater at 730 EST, let me know and I'll send you the link.
1311543258732879872 2020-10-01 13:47:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> A lot of what I read on twitter is absolutely none of my business
1311337393010679813 2020-10-01 00:09:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ronnypascale  https://t.co/4M5CUS2eCy
1310429891192651776 2020-09-28 12:03:27 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TheLastAmanda This, by the way, is an incredible response and brightened my whole day
1310365065628000256 2020-09-28 07:45:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @OMaraRules @TheLastAmanda Regular. I wouldn't expect a cinnamon sugar pretzel to be a pretzel - I would assume it was a (delicious) branding choice.
1310314244991320068 2020-09-28 04:23:55 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I just had my first auntie Anne's pretzel and friends, whatever that thing was - and I think I enjoyed it - it was not a pretzel
1309906315125362692 2020-09-27 01:22:57 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Also, we don't have these in nyc, so I'm sure this isn't news to many of you, but did you know Sheetz is owned by Steve Sheetz?  https://t.co/E4wj3z8k6c
1309906296838270978 2020-09-27 01:22:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> About 90% of businesses with trump signs have these shrine situations. I have only seen Biden signs on businesses that are within blocks of college campuses.
1309906295168868356 2020-09-27 01:22:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> About 50% of houses with with trump signs have at least one very very big sign, like 4x6 feet. About 10% of houses with trump signs have what can only be called shrines - dozens of signs of all sizes, often additional handmade, flags, the whole shpiel.
1309906293675700227 2020-09-27 01:22:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> About 75% of the houses with trump signs have 5 or more of trump signs.   About 20% of Biden houses have more than one sign, and it's usually just an ancillary message sign - stop hate, save the post office, love is love, etc. Almost no blm signs.
1309906292597719043 2020-09-27 01:22:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Anecdotal: I've been driving through Pennsylvania and Ohio for two days and there are about 10 trump sign houses to every Biden sign house.
1309660020401942529 2020-09-26 09:04:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Pleeeeeeeaaaaase please please
1309624489509093377 2020-09-26 06:43:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @baumard_nicolas Is this satire or are you trash?
1309623935055679488 2020-09-26 06:40:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I think it's so weird when hot people are pro-life
1309505192891756545 2020-09-25 22:49:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I've worked with Jenn and honestly? You should be so lucky.
1308942866518102018 2020-09-24 09:34:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @SamaanAshrawi Thank YOU!
1308920739186307077 2020-09-24 08:06:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @thedak @TwitterSupport Oh no
1308910685733126144 2020-09-24 07:26:40 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I am getting rid of a bunch of furniture/things and a lot of ppl coming through to take stuff. I've been playing 70s and 80s commercials on the TV while they're here and so far only one person noticed that commercials had been playing for the whole twenty minutes they were here
1308835963972587521 2020-09-24 02:29:45 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Damn this thread is fucking cool
1308626102747836416 2020-09-23 12:35:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sandwichJOY Hungry?
1308625033674227712 2020-09-23 12:31:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Having the kind of week where I set my alarm and when it told me "alarm set for 8 hours and 15 mins" I cried a little at the prospect of getting 8 hours of sleep. Anyway now I'm on twitter dot com in bed

1307417183664963584 2020-09-20 04:32:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> In times like these, I often think "I could tweet some nonsense shit like 'In times like these, it's important to remember a tree's branches pale in comparison to the roots' and if the right white liberal RTed it a million idiots would think it meant something"
1307415999390650370 2020-09-20 04:27:19 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Getting accidentally trapped in a time portal has always scared me but now? In our year 2020? I'm in
1307415343548243982 2020-09-20 04:24:43 +0800 <kevinasarobot> What if an adult couldn't understand puppetry and went to see a puppet show
1307066655286136833 2020-09-19 05:19:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @hellolanemoore Willing you grace and luck, and like so many others have said, I also have a dog who survived accidental chocolate ingestion - hang in to the best of your ability, andnrest assured Lights knows how loved they are and will fight to make their way outta the ER and back into yr arms
1306992267476045824 2020-09-19 00:23:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> THIS IS INCREDIBLE
1306990416189960192 2020-09-19 00:16:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @EmilyKager Wait, I thought a medium number that sounds reasonable is an estimate? Oh god I have been doing things way wrong
1306989654831439877 2020-09-19 00:13:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @HiChrisRyan This is not the kind misinformation campaign I thought everyone was upset about, but
1306989172587139073 2020-09-19 00:11:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 I actually mean user accessibility - I'm subtweeting a dev who I once got in a fight with because he was arguing that hand tracking in VR was a useless feature and I was working with an actor who only had one hand, making most vr ux next to impossible to use.
1306983696260575232 2020-09-18 23:49:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Two kinds of angry antisocial game devs - hardcore leftists who think their game is a trivial way to waste time in a world that is quickly imploding, and the probably libertarians who think they alone are capable of making a perfect game being made and accessibility is dumb

1306637768869773314 2020-09-18 00:54:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I directed a short and really wonderful new play by Rachel Lin for this, and I hope you'll come see! 7x7 is a super fun show, and it's free and it's hosted by one of the all-time great nyc institutions, @TheTankNYC  https://t.co/BNe4YjFZni
1306624825637691392 2020-09-18 00:03:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Good morning from me and the mug my parents have had since I was a child that I have evidently grown up to become  https://t.co/gT0p3omgIH
1306601859763908610 2020-09-17 22:32:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I could do this all day, this is the most fun I've had in weeks
1306601858539102209 2020-09-17 22:32:13 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Also one is joked about as believing they have the power to solve problems that don't exist and one is joked about as believing they have the power to solve problems
1306601857490604032 2020-09-17 22:32:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Also, one has a reputation for a toxic culture where employees are expected to work long hours and burnout and high turnover are common and one has a reputation for a passionate culture where employees are expected to work long hours and burnout and high turnover are common
1306333807524614144 2020-09-17 04:47:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> If good graphics is all you're offering, your shit is probably really boring
1306333040122236928 2020-09-17 04:44:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @alisiamartinez_ Omg so nice of you to buy this for me!
1306082657449771010 2020-09-16 12:09:06 +0800 <kevinasarobot> What they don't sell baseball bats at target?

1306052284279914499 2020-09-16 10:08:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @brillhart Wow, this is... The definitive version now.
1306034205441302529 2020-09-16 08:56:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @_jamesoloughlin THANK YOU THIS CLEARS UP MY FEED
1306033317964386305 2020-09-16 08:53:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Wait why is everybody tweeting about Hackers?
1306029651131801600 2020-09-16 08:38:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete Also! Jonathan Adler bong is an EXTEMELY satisfying Google search!
1306029353361453058 2020-09-16 08:37:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete I almost tagged you in this. And it turns out you're right - I was over-shooting. I guess I have to buy this bong now.
1306026713290334209 2020-09-16 08:26:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Haring might be the thing that makes me think it's okay to have a bong as a mid life crisis.
1306026553927761921 2020-09-16 08:26:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I just got a Keith Haring bong advertised to me and I dunno I guess I love targeted ads? I'd buy this thing in an instant if I was okay being a middle aged man with a bong.
1306012794840588290 2020-09-16 07:31:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Do iiiiiit
1305860000343117826 2020-09-15 21:24:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LillyLyle This advice is so good I'm tempted to ignore it! (new york city - decidedly not Scotland, I'm afraid)
1305731990428299265 2020-09-15 12:55:40 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ChasLiBretto YES
1305731224686788609 2020-09-15 12:52:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Natzke Thanks! I will dig in that direction!
1305729250696273921 2020-09-15 12:44:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Natzke Trying to pixelate the face and some of the immediate environment, and keeping it animated more actively than the face does on its own without animating so much that it draws attn. Mostly trying to anonymize the person in/with their environment.
1305672731648839681 2020-09-15 09:00:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete Oh I love this, is it happening?
1305541175827406850 2020-09-15 00:17:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vozos @JoeSchiappa At the very least, we can make a filter that makes every t shirt say "Stephen King Rules"
1305541011305902082 2020-09-15 00:16:47 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JoeSchiappa But seriously, Ive got a volumetric camera on loan right now that can capture you in 3d and that would be relatively easy to export in to whatever AR medium you're looking for.
1305540763732844548 2020-09-15 00:15:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @JoeSchiappa There are a lot of different ways to do this! But first - does Wolfman got nards?
1305538841080745984 2020-09-15 00:08:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @WarrenWerewolf @HellsTalkShow In a hundred years, it will be!
1305538443896926208 2020-09-15 00:06:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @HellsTalkShow Oh Spark AR is a free program, friends!
1305532627844239360 2020-09-14 23:43:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Omg to have my work called "devilry" by the inimitable @hellstalkshow is the best review I've gotten since the pandemic.
1305532349426413569 2020-09-14 23:42:22 +0800 <kevinasarobot> So I dunno. Maybe there is some kind of menschy goodness to be found in boosting nathie or vr oasis guy because they have worked hard to be seen saying nice things loudly about Facebook's stuff, but in my experience, it doesn't actually move the needle the right way for fb.
1305532348570755072 2020-09-14 23:42:22 +0800 <kevinasarobot> When they are trying to impress the bigger gatekeepers instead of actually evangelizing (in the case of the theater, evangelizing just means putting on shows for people who aren't their shitty alcoholic comedy friends), they have the opposite effect than is intended.
1305532347677368325 2020-09-14 23:42:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> As soon as we started reaching out to civilians (or audience, as we call them where I come from) and stopped focusing on pleasing the loud grouchies, we started actually making money and getting press again. It's not complicated. The evangelists are also gatekeepers and
1305532346687524864 2020-09-14 23:42:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I am actually speaking from experience here - I was brought in to bring a semi-successful comedy theater back to life after the guy who owned it basically ran it in to the ground by trying to cater to a bunch of loud grouchy comics who kept the place insular but populated
1305532345806663680 2020-09-14 23:42:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Fb didn't go to any of those youtubers ppl are upset about because it doesn't actually benefit them or even matter at all. They are trying to get people OUTSIDE the XR space to buy in and do not give a fuck about the mouthy XR heads who will keep showing up anyway
1305532345055948801 2020-09-14 23:42:21 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Quick reminder that YouTube content creators, like theater bloggers, do it because they want to do it and facebook doesn't need to give them anything because they are already obsessive nerds who will praise the thing as long as it is good equipment, which of course it will be.
1305516556991029249 2020-09-14 22:39:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> HELLO
1305515841505628160 2020-09-14 22:36:46 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I'm looking to borrow a halfway decent 360 camera from Sept. 20th to October 5th. Anybody got one sitting around unused I could come pick up?

1305353729294716931 2020-09-14 11:52:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> It's been a rough week so of course I started working on 2 new things to cope - here's the first step of something I'm really excited about. Let's see if I finish it (somebody hold me accountable plz) #sparkar #musicaltheater #pixelcontingency  https://t.co/rgBLMsDS5v
1305322946404257792 2020-09-14 09:50:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete I use goonies as the archetypal example of a movie you absolutely need not revisit as an adult. I watched that movie 100,000 times and it is really, really not good.

1304840591965122561 2020-09-13 01:53:34 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I hadn't thought about it, but yeah, Peloton of all things really ended up nailing it.
1304802244689375233 2020-09-12 23:21:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @blackoutpete Maybe an hour-long Q&amp;A about any of the stuff you run workshops on?
1304637158964318211 2020-09-12 12:25:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @willpurpura I mean I saw it a long time ago but I seem to remember the movie is like 95% Spongebob footage

1304604462774919170 2020-09-12 10:15:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @benz145 Depends on the movie and the mood, I guess. Most of my favorite memories from going to the movies are about big crowd responses.
1304579855825149953 2020-09-12 08:37:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @benz145 It's like going to the movies. I'm not gonna talk during anyway, and feeling like a part of a real audience can be a perk
1304550911566643200 2020-09-12 06:42:29 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @James3rdComedy Shit man, if the stabbing didn't kill him, I bet his mom and dad did.
1304497573689020417 2020-09-12 03:10:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> There are a million things to say about why he is unfit, but anyone - literally anyone - who has ever worked with or even thought about diction can see that he does in fact say "under god" and that phrase features voiced consonants that do not require movement of the lips or jaw
1304473616638246912 2020-09-12 01:35:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jonbraylock This sounds like a trap
1304437444398456834 2020-09-11 23:11:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This is a tweet about usa and 9/11
1304437443005943808 2020-09-11 23:11:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> You ever see a fist fight where the bigger guy has obviously never been punched before, and after the first hit, he's kind of stunned and angry and terrified and goes clumsily ballistic destroying property and accidentally hitting bystanders until he's knocked out?
1304427585045237760 2020-09-11 22:32:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TheLastAmanda I am really not looking forward to that.
1304302921086046209 2020-09-11 14:17:03 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Make no mistake, these lil tributes to Brantley that the other critics are tweeting are just their way of letting you know how they want us to think of them.
1304275561339129862 2020-09-11 12:28:20 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 I did not know you made GAMES
1304272341984305153 2020-09-11 12:15:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TimThom007 @greggturkington @justingaynor @timheidecker Um, you did WHAT?
1304271990929399810 2020-09-11 12:14:09 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I am literally stunned every time I see someone post about what their plans were for this year. Are we still thinking about that? Who cares?
1304097652913639425 2020-09-11 00:41:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> A super-user would've thought to put "checks notes" in before the predicate of this bit. Too impulsive.
1304082077252493313 2020-09-10 23:39:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Pathetic. Just like the low res photo choice.
1304074549038927878 2020-09-10 23:09:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Yall talking about "Sony can't afford" to keep up with these low (maybe even loss-leader) Xbox prices as if they weren't about to make A BAJILLION DOLLARS on that Jared Leto sort of vampire movie
1303869091485286401 2020-09-10 09:33:10 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ladyespii Thanks for the signal boost, espii!

1303442804039913473 2020-09-09 05:19:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @Charlie_Athanas Look, we all have unpopular opinions!
1303359838248931329 2020-09-08 23:49:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I'm glad that covid will give me a year off from fucking Halloween
1303349377080188930 2020-09-08 23:08:01 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sandwichJOY Just like nyc!
1303347419451731969 2020-09-08 23:00:14 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MajorMcDoom Man, until I'm fully vegan, I'm hypocritical as hell anyway. We've all got to draw our hypocrite lines individually.
1303347262752534528 2020-09-08 22:59:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MajorMcDoom Oh, yeah, this is 1000% less abhorrent than factory farming or absolutely most of the treatment of "major food animals" in this country. I still think it's pretty horrible, though!
1303340578973851650 2020-09-08 22:33:03 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MajorMcDoom Are different than dressing something up before killing it. The Guinea pigs may not give a fuck, but I also think that dressing animals up can be (in many circumstances) pretty cruel by itself.
1303339922028474368 2020-09-08 22:30:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @MajorMcDoom I try not to be tooooo sanctimonious about it, but I'm a vegetarian and feel this way about pigs, too. But yeah, this was about the playing with your food aspect. I'm sure this is cultural bias, but I also think celebratory funerals (a great thing!)...
1303326180859355141 2020-09-08 21:35:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I'm sorry but this is what I mean when I say humans aren't worth saving

1302257350162685953 2020-09-05 22:48:41 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @king_lou @ashleyjward I give it 2 days before Lou has a $40k gofundme for his broken weiner but then the weiner will post a series of incriminating images showing it was him who broke his own weiner
1302100578038886402 2020-09-05 12:25:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @thismyshow That machete shit, though? That's new.
1302100456148283392 2020-09-05 12:25:15 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @thismyshow I think it's the latter, tbh. I've had citizen a long time and it was never more intense than when I was working in times Square. And like, I've never in my life felt unsafe in tsq, you know?
1302096091358400512 2020-09-05 12:07:54 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This is the safer neighborhood we moved to.  https://t.co/M2EiJeXpSR
1301947790227058692 2020-09-05 02:18:36 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @jennyjaffe My mom loved this song and I was always suspicious about that.
1301943321405853697 2020-09-05 02:00:51 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I mean I guess I do understand I just hate them for it
1301943223733100545 2020-09-05 02:00:28 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I guess I don't understand why people who believe the prsdnt when he says the election is under attack and there's so much voter fraud aren't frustrated that he's not trying to solve the problem
1301938264501366786 2020-09-05 01:40:45 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @RobGeorge FOLKS, HE'S DONE IT AGAIN
1301932694092345345 2020-09-05 01:18:37 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I give up caring about people. I'm going back to animal activism, trying to save creatures that are not trying to destroy themselves (this obviously excludes pandas, who have been trying to destroy themselves for generations)
1301758160210886656 2020-09-04 13:45:05 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Quite a thread.
1301671615198121989 2020-09-04 08:01:11 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @alexqgb @timoni Playing an instrument induces flow state, and most require focused breathing!
1301615766211624962 2020-09-04 04:19:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @sbishopstone @vozos Oh gosh, I forgot! Either disqualified or extra bonus points for not having it in every movie
1301581483757498369 2020-09-04 02:03:02 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @LooNoons The K stood for kid all along?!  https://t.co/Zh0byWc3VD
1301574784489267201 2020-09-04 01:36:25 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @thedak Hell, gimme some of them light-up jenga blocks and I'm happy
1301568440130568194 2020-09-04 01:11:12 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @joshgondelman @BillyDomineau Please, Mr. Tambourine Man, I am not that man.
1301551385159389184 2020-09-04 00:03:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ICONTROLGRAVITY As your daughter, I'm very grateful for the lesson
1301547860190691332 2020-09-03 23:49:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Josh's talent and good nature was always gonna be the thing that made him successful, but it's this shit that's gonna make him an absolute fucking legend
1301547321583337474 2020-09-03 23:47:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @TheeBeardedBard  https://t.co/KU9COJUfsM
1301544445997965312 2020-09-03 23:35:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I'm almost 40, but if I wanted to start going by a nickname that started with "kid," you'd all support me, right?
1301541318003490816 2020-09-03 23:23:26 +0800 <kevinasarobot> Oh my god
1301530348363411457 2020-09-03 22:39:50 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @azrail13 I can't speak for other people or your boss, but I also think that your rapist deserves to be shot in the head and anyone who doesn't think wanting to kill a rapist is justified should be put in jail. But your point is of course well made.
1301529023638577154 2020-09-03 22:34:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ThatTheatreKid9 I mean, I deserved it.
1301527973342908417 2020-09-03 22:30:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kduquer @vozos This is incredible.
1301527886617350144 2020-09-03 22:30:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @azrail13 Ok. I just think the world will be better off without David Clarke.
1301523160790167552 2020-09-03 22:11:17 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vozos Toni Collette absolutely nails it in sixth sense (she actually might be the greatest actor of her generation), and Kevin Bacon in Sleepers are the only two I can think of.
1301521608201379848 2020-09-03 22:05:07 +0800 <kevinasarobot> This tweet inspired by watching an actor I really like absolutely humiliate himself by attempting a realistic vocal performance in this Philadelphia-set thriller. He sounds like he's drunk in Minnesota.
1301518073388765185 2020-09-03 21:51:04 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I lived in Philly for almost 10 years and have been teaching acting for twice as long. Any time I see someone perform a Philly accent really well, I think they are the single greatest actor of their generation
1301504566995886080 2020-09-03 20:57:24 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I once got suspended from twitter for telling this guy to kill himself
1301235763112300545 2020-09-03 03:09:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> The responses to this tweet are incredibly revealing. If you don't think this is a problem, you have never introduced anyone to the tech (and also likely don't care about accessibility)
1301167968605396994 2020-09-02 22:39:52 +0800 <kevinasarobot> The only people I've ever seen with these cards are white drug dealers over 40.
1301167313312505863 2020-09-02 22:37:16 +0800 <kevinasarobot> One cool thing about 2020 is that we all started finally recognizing "media" as the appropriate plural form of "medium"
1301166878732230659 2020-09-02 22:35:33 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @iBrews @bpowtweets @thedak @kathrynyu @meta_movie @la_Biennale @kentbye @theextendedmind Sold out! Enjoy!
1301155873725779969 2020-09-02 21:51:49 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @bpowtweets @thedak @kathrynyu @iBrews @meta_movie @la_Biennale @kentbye @theextendedmind EAT THE RICH, BRANDON
1301153790872236032 2020-09-02 21:43:32 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @bpowtweets @thedak @kathrynyu @iBrews @meta_movie @la_Biennale @kentbye @theextendedmind ...how?
1301143269238362123 2020-09-02 21:01:44 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @kathrynyu @iBrews @meta_movie @la_Biennale @bpowtweets @thedak @kentbye @theextendedmind Yeah!
1300975878533509120 2020-09-02 09:56:35 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @vancouverceo @joshruben It IS pretty!
1300968561461133312 2020-09-02 09:27:30 +0800 <kevinasarobot> I never checked, did Joe Kennedy actually ever, like, do anything? Just hire people to misspell Worcester?
1300956055116173314 2020-09-02 08:37:48 +0800 <kevinasarobot> @ThatTheatreKid9 @AlanSchmuckler @yodaveholstein I mean, as the director of the thing in several iterations, I always felt like I was working on a fan-made version, my friend. (it me, I'm the fan) I just got to be in a room with the handsome geniuses who wrote it at the time.
