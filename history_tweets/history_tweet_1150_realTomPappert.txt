1344044795442950144 2020-12-30 06:17:05 +0800 <realTomPappert> All these Twitter personalities think Chinese style censorship came to America organically.   No, it was exported by China via American businesses.   We will soon be a true Chinese satellite state unless quick action is taken.
1343989286966882304 2020-12-30 02:36:30 +0800 <realTomPappert> I am shocked. Shocked, I tell you.
1343989244424040450 2020-12-30 02:36:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> After being in politics since dinosaurs roamed the earth, Mitch McConnell finally understands strategy?  It appears he wants to force Dems to accept voter fraud investigations and a Section 230 rework as part of the $2,000 direct stimulus package.   https://t.co/xa03Quo5xp
1343969344418705411 2020-12-30 01:17:16 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trafalgar is basically a Republican push-poll company.  If even they're showing this, maybe it's proof that America doesn't give a crap about fake elections or candidates who don't represent them.  I really don't get Loeffler and Purdue. They don't seem to be acting rationally.

The only way to have a successful career in China is to either join the CCP or parrot its propaganda to the point where it does not matter.

1341965284840714240 2020-12-24 12:33:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> I really respect that Jenna Ellis wants State Legislatures to fix their corrupt elections, but it requires a lot of moving pieces.  I think it could happen in Arizona and Georgia if Americans keep pushing.  I'm not sure about any other state.
1341963028338765824 2020-12-24 12:24:53 +0800 <realTomPappert> Pence has 36 minutes to tell the world what kind of man he is.
1341962617280221186 2020-12-24 12:23:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> My understanding is that Pence will likely need to cast a tie breaking vote on January 6.  If he won't break the tie, then there's no shot at a contingent election.  The best bet is for State Legislatures to remedy their corruption.  Would be nice if Pence just did his job tho.
1341955080120098816 2020-12-24 11:53:18 +0800 <realTomPappert> Update:   Pence's Chief of Staff @marcshort45 just hung up on me.  Phone call lasted 17 seconds.  Pence is a traitor.

1341626297932521472 2020-12-23 14:06:50 +0800 <realTomPappert> Most people would be thrilled that their fledgling news outlet is kicking ass.  I just wish someone else in the Conservative Media would join the fight and remove some pressure.

1341426081547612162 2020-12-23 00:51:14 +0800 <realTomPappert> America proved that its elections are a joke in November.   Then in December it added insult to injury by offering a $600 bribe for us to shut up about it.

1341292919878275072 2020-12-22 16:02:06 +0800 <realTomPappert> I have no doubt Trump is working tirelessly. I just hope he’s listening to the right voices.
1341291708240289793 2020-12-22 15:57:17 +0800 <realTomPappert> I've been pounding on legislators.  Arizona has great people.   Georgia has great people.   The majorities of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin don't seem to have any desire to remedy the fraud.  Why is Ellis still kicking this dying horse?
1341269136807235584 2020-12-22 14:27:36 +0800 <realTomPappert> @JennaEllisEsq Yeah and the fact that the entire base disagrees with you should tell you something.   This country is not willing to accept a half measure.
1341236008516530176 2020-12-22 12:15:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> It's interesting that the same people who tried to make me spike our story about Ashley Biden's diary are currently begging Trump not to use the Insurrection Act.
1341232694072647681 2020-12-22 12:02:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> So basically Dems can steal an election using Venezuelan voting machines, have media cover it up, and if State Legislators across America don't stop it, then there's no recourse?  Jenna, think of the real "precedent" here. We don't live in a Republic if this is the new normal.
1341175757943541762 2020-12-22 08:16:33 +0800 <realTomPappert> The police in my city killed a bank robbery suspect today.  Judging by the Floyd Precedent, I expect riots to begin no later than Saturday.

1341073031108636672 2020-12-22 01:28:21 +0800 <realTomPappert> Just to be clear: SmartMatic is going to sue Sidney Powell for exposing their connections to Venezuela, but if one of these COVID vaccines kills your grandma or sterilizes your wife then you have no legal recourse. Sorry!

1340911073856282625 2020-12-21 14:44:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> I like how all Americans are now getting the equivalent of one (1) week of unemployment.   This is our thanks for being willing serfs the past 9 months?

At this event a US Rep joined the Electoral College fight and announced that Senator-elect Tuberville will as well.   The whole theme of the evening was the Electoral College fight.
1340790912767717376 2020-12-21 06:47:18 +0800 <realTomPappert> I'm guest hosting Election Countdown tonight on BANNED DOT VIDEO!

1340745581556326403 2020-12-21 03:47:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> Democrats want lockdowns to continue until you are  homeless.  It's the only way you'll accept State Housing and a $1,200/mo allowance (if you get the vaccine, of course).
1340543965473480705 2020-12-20 14:26:02 +0800 <realTomPappert> @meredithwire Mitch and Mike Pence can derail everything on January 6.   I like to think Mike is less likely to doom America compared to Mitch.
1340542906302607362 2020-12-20 14:21:49 +0800 <realTomPappert> If Mitch McConnell is smart then he won’t be remembered by history at all.   If he’s dumb, he will be reimagined as the modern Benedict Arnold.   Children’s stories will be written about China Mitch’s betrayal.   It will become part of our country’s mythos.
1340541710384967682 2020-12-20 14:17:04 +0800 <realTomPappert> Abandoning Trump on January 6 is political suicide.   National File and its reporters - almost exclusively 20somethings - will spend the next 40 years reminding America which politicians stood with President Trump during this most pivotal movement, and which betrayed us all.
1340528244014112768 2020-12-20 13:23:33 +0800 <realTomPappert> @BrannigansLaww Charlie's come a long way since the Groyper Wars began.   Still has a long way to come.
1340528032474402818 2020-12-20 13:22:43 +0800 <realTomPappert> I hope Tommy Tuberville doesn't make Matt Gaetz (an honorable man) into a liar.
1340527721634541569 2020-12-20 13:21:29 +0800 <realTomPappert> @PhillinGroovy @realDonaldTrump I'm glad you admit it was wrong for Bill De Blasio to kill thousands of elderly people by giving them roommates who are positive with COVID-19.
1340525520719626243 2020-12-20 13:12:44 +0800 <realTomPappert> @PhillinGroovy @realDonaldTrump That's cool, what will they call the law against killing thousands of elderly people by exposing them to Covid?  De Blasio's Law?
1340524567304003586 2020-12-20 13:08:57 +0800 <realTomPappert> @realDonaldTrump If you call it something cool, like Trump Law, I'm totally for it.  Just saying.

1339042593317982208 2020-12-16 11:00:07 +0800 <realTomPappert> In 2012 I was a bright eyed libertarian Republican eager to participate politics, and my wizened parents warned me: Voting for President is just as real as voting for American Idol.  When Trump got in, I thought it was proof they were wrong.  Now I realize they were right.
1339034202793275398 2020-12-16 10:26:46 +0800 <realTomPappert> Facebook banned me because my pages were visually similar to someone else they banned.  Their words, not mine.
1338991711637401602 2020-12-16 07:37:55 +0800 <realTomPappert> I think it was a big strategic error for Facebook to ban my pages and groups before the media could screenshot everything ever posted to take it out of context and use it against me.

1337885448820166668 2020-12-13 06:22:02 +0800 <realTomPappert> When I was in DC for the Million MAGA March, I was completely humbled by the people who recognized me through Infowars.  After shaking the thousandth hand, I realized that this was happening because #AlexJones sent those patriots to D.C. to protest for Trump, not the GOP.

1337877584160436227 2020-12-13 05:50:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> Alex Jones sends hundreds of thousands of his daily viewers/listeners/supporters to DC so it looks like the GOP has a base and this is how they treat him.  I owe no allegiance to the Republican Party.

1337640906036535297 2020-12-12 14:10:18 +0800 <realTomPappert> After Alex Jones was banned, Trump tried to bring up Big Tech at a rally. Nobody applauded/understood.

1333581446360027139 2020-12-01 09:19:28 +0800 <realTomPappert> Going on the Record: National File will be the last publication posting 100% Trump/Voter Fraud news while Fox News uses its establishment tendrils to pressure all our competition to toe the company line.
1333580681272848384 2020-12-01 09:16:25 +0800 <realTomPappert> @SenMastriano @PASenateGOP MODERN PATRICK HENRY!
1333576465171034112 2020-12-01 08:59:40 +0800 <realTomPappert> Can you imagine if a normal trial required the level of "evidence" that conservatives and the media are demanding Trump provide?  Before this is done you will likely have OVER 24 HOURS of testimony publicly available.  What do you want, a time machine live stream of the fraud?
1333574470813052929 2020-12-01 08:51:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> A brave day for Anglo-Irish relations
1333571451782385665 2020-12-01 08:39:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump: We have 10,000 witnesses saying he's the murderer.  Media: But where's your evidence?  Trump: Well I have 10,000 signed witness statements from people who saw him pull out the gun and shoot the other guy.  Media: LOL HE DOESN'T HAVE EVIDENCE HAHAHAHAHAHA
1333570059369926656 2020-12-01 08:34:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> I hope the GOP losers demanding "evidence" feel REALLY DUMB now.  We've had 12+ hours of witness &amp; expert testimony, thousands of signed affidavits, and enough statistical analysis to make my head hurt.  No "evidence" will make Democrats happy because THEY STOLE THE ELECTION!

1333562059909451776 2020-12-01 08:02:26 +0800 <realTomPappert> Arizona should be a wake up call.  We won.  If everyone starts pushing in the same direction, we can cement the victory.
1333506893810184194 2020-12-01 04:23:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> This Arizona hearing is going to go until 5:30 pm MT.  That's 7:30 pm ET for you Coastal Elites.  This thing is massive.
1333489345882419205 2020-12-01 03:13:29 +0800 <realTomPappert> Pennsylvania GOP Chair Lawrence Tabas is supposed to be an "acclaimed" expert on election law.   So... Why hasn't he said anything since November 3?

People who follow me on this sad Twitter account or watch me on War Room have known this.  State Legislatures are were the fraud ends.  Right now, they are all either Patrick Henry or Benedict Arnold.

1333239644134264834 2020-11-30 10:41:16 +0800 <realTomPappert> So I'm supposed to be upset that Rand Paul "is not a doctor" even though Fauci hasn't treated a patient since like the 1960s?
1333237702368632833 2020-11-30 10:33:33 +0800 <realTomPappert> @BreitbartNews I don't think it's healthy for us to engage in his delusions.  You don't play along when the Alzheimer's patient wakes up and thinks it's 1967.
1333225391226490880 2020-11-30 09:44:38 +0800 <realTomPappert> Can we all casually agree that the Dog Story is obviously fake?  It's a good way to make forget he's 78 years old and clearly has dementia. Plus it makes you remember that Trump never adopted a dog.   If they'd said "fell while playing with grandkids" no one would have bought it.
1333225035436347395 2020-11-30 09:43:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> Democrats: The age of old, white men is over!  Also Democrats: It's completely fine that the 78-year-old white man we plan to fraudulently make president tripped while playing with his dog and HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL OVER IT

1333194804533075971 2020-11-30 07:43:05 +0800 <realTomPappert> America has - if only briefly - returned to the 19th century, where State Legislatures are possibly the most important institution we have.  This move to keep @SenMastriano from doing his job and tossing out this fraudulent election by "diagnosing" him with COVID must not stand.
1333193745207087108 2020-11-30 07:38:53 +0800 <realTomPappert> If @SenMastriano defies the COVID tyranny and keeps working while "sick" (but asymptomatic?) he will officially be the 21st Century George Washington.

This website's always been CIA-operated trash.  There's a reason Jack Dorsey looks like an MKUltra victim and owns less of Twitter than Saudi Arabia.
1333099370577801224 2020-11-30 01:23:52 +0800 <realTomPappert> Twitter is now going to bully Fox News into firing, or at least punishing, Maria Bartiromo.  This is how living under tyranny works.  In 6 months it will be jail if you question election integrity.

1331374118743191556 2020-11-25 07:08:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> America only exists as it does because State Legislators were given immense power.  The Constitution had to be RATIFIED, meaning the State Legislators of the time had to sign off.  They weren't about to give up their sovereignty without making damn sure they had a failsafe.

State legislators, who are usually all but nameless, will soon be the most important people in America.   We must support them and encourage them to DO THE RIGHT THING!

There would be no question about the fraudulent results of November 3.

Hell no.   You've created a monster with no hesitation that exists to ruin you.  See you in court.   #StopTheSteal
1325852065483141120 2020-11-10 01:25:40 +0800 <realTomPappert> You mean a couple of 4chan autists did what you guys have been doing to us for the past 5 years?  uhhhhhhhh BASED?  https://t.co/svsC3GL03e
1325843787562831873 2020-11-10 00:52:46 +0800 <realTomPappert> @BoSnerdley @VP Nikki Haley is everything that Trump voters were trying to escape in 2016.  If the Republican Party thinks they can anoint her as Trump's heir in 2024 they will cease to exist as a national party.
1325826954487091202 2020-11-09 23:45:53 +0800 <realTomPappert> On Arizona and Georgia, I think it depends entirely on how worried the globalists are about this thing backfiring.  This is their out.   They can stop fudging numbers. let Georgia and Arizona go Trump, gracefully lose the Philly lawsuit, and wash their hands of the whole thing.
1325826198891606020 2020-11-09 23:42:53 +0800 <realTomPappert> @tronexports SO TRUE!
1325823449118466051 2020-11-09 23:31:57 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kinda sucks to think elections don't matter anymore.  All those sleepless nights spent working on scoops that - at least before the mail in votes - changed the map in North Carolina, Arizona, and elsewhere.  Wasted.  Should have been getting my beauty sleep to Fight The Steal.
1325822394167123973 2020-11-09 23:27:46 +0800 <realTomPappert> @johncardillo "It's not *WIDESPREAD* evidence" is the new goalpost.
1325821652404477957 2020-11-09 23:24:49 +0800 <realTomPappert> If Biden somehow pulls of this steal - which he won't - he would be the first president to have to pardon his own son, then himself, to keep from being impeached.
1325820192895721476 2020-11-09 23:19:01 +0800 <realTomPappert> @SPC_Harry @DonaldJTrumpJr It's BIDEN'S kid who has the crack addiction, sorry soldier.
1325817713810411520 2020-11-09 23:09:10 +0800 <realTomPappert> I like how it's a week after the election and the GOP is still talking about what will happen "if Democrats win the Senate."  We don't even know who got elected dog catcher because of this clusterfrick of an election.  But CNN says they know for sure Biden will be president.
1325809830196555779 2020-11-09 22:37:50 +0800 <realTomPappert> CNN's night shift interns obviously hate their jobs.
1325809130955747328 2020-11-09 22:35:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> How did she not know this?  A national mask mandate literally the only campaign policy Harris/Biden had going into this thing.  https://t.co/GANHPI3iep

1325780513668345856 2020-11-09 20:41:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> Democrats expect me to believe Russia stole the 2016 election with some Facebook ads but voting machines changing votes after the fact, ballots being found 5 days later, and vote watchers being thrown out isn’t suspect at all.

1325255580085313540 2020-11-08 09:55:27 +0800 <realTomPappert> What's that? That's the sound of millions of people frantically trying to recover their Gab login information.
1325184295065939968 2020-11-08 05:12:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> Reminder that the Supreme Court ordered Pennsylvania NOT to add the votes counted after 8 p.m. on Nov 3 to the state's vote total.  Biden is declaring victory based on a state refusing to abide by the highest court in the land.  This. Is. A. Coup.
1325173138154377216 2020-11-08 04:27:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> I guess now we know why the FBI has been insisting white men are the biggest domestic terrorist threat and will be through 2022.   They consider Trump a terrorist.
1325172469288759297 2020-11-08 04:25:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> It's amazing, Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) are claiming victory - yet Trump supporters are the ones taking to the streets with signs, banners, and hats.  Joe can't even create enthusiasm when he's handed a phony crown by the establishment media!
1325169367240245257 2020-11-08 04:12:52 +0800 <realTomPappert> The best part about this insanity is that when it’s all over, the media will go from being “generally untrustworthy” to “obvious lies and propaganda” in the minds of the American people.   Such a ridiculous gamble for the deep state that can’t possibly pay off.
1324981613185421312 2020-11-07 15:46:48 +0800 <realTomPappert> Revolver News is killing it right now, and I don't just say that because the top 3 articles are from National File!

1324971571560255488 2020-11-07 15:06:54 +0800 <realTomPappert> I'm mostly getting through this by imagining Philly vote counters as cartoonish narcoleptics who pass out when they hear the word "vote."  "Hey Tony, we gotta get back down to the floor, they just got a new truckload of mail in votes from the du--- Tony? Ah crap call 911 again"
1324925670275878913 2020-11-07 12:04:30 +0800 <realTomPappert> At least Joe Biden's speeches are short.  It's clearly because he's dying of dementia, but it's great for my blood pressure.
1324924983290830850 2020-11-07 12:01:46 +0800 <realTomPappert> So the Prime Time Speech we’ve been waiting for since Prime Time ended was a bunch of mealy mouthed nonsense about COVID, a humble brag about voter fraud, and an admonishment for being uncivil?

Then, vote counting was paused at 1 a.m.  When it resumed around 4 a.m., and up until now, the votes have been tilted for Biden in comically high numbers.  Who - other than Democrats - really believes this?

1324764354693259271 2020-11-07 01:23:29 +0800 <realTomPappert> Does anyone really believe that they kept find votes in key battleground states with Democrat leaders until Biden won, then all the votes were found?  It's beyond belief. Literally. It strains credulity.

1324569792813084672 2020-11-06 12:30:22 +0800 <realTomPappert> It's pretty telling that, so far, the Globalists have only been able to get Rick "Frothy" Santorum and Chris Christie (no joke required) to come out publicly against President Trump.  Hang together or hang separately, boys.

1324564361764098048 2020-11-06 12:08:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> Christie was a leaker in 2017.  He also tried to staff the White House with establishment losers.   This is why Trump moved to Bedminster briefly in the transition and had a 15 minute meeting with Christie when all other meetings lasted hours.  It was not a friendly meeting.

1324463687697113088 2020-11-06 05:28:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> Both teams suck.  Romney wrote Obamacare and the Republicans wanted to make him president.  McCain voted to keep Obamacare and the Republicans wanted to make him president.  The Republican Party is only useful as a tool to reach voters.  Trump could have won in Reform circa 2000.
1324462495428468743 2020-11-06 05:24:00 +0800 <realTomPappert> Why does anyone care about the Republican Party?  Do you really think President Nikki Haley, Vice President Lindsey Graham, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will enact Trump's agenda?  Republicans prior to 2016 were just Democrats who gave welfare to big business.
1324460406937686020 2020-11-06 05:15:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> @IlluminatiPatsy In the words of one of their favorite neocons, "You're either with us, or against us."
1324459973724786691 2020-11-06 05:13:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> Pretty sure the Republican Party is complicit in the most widespread voter fraud in American history.  They're the ones trying to give Democrats total control.
1324459144594771973 2020-11-06 05:10:41 +0800 <realTomPappert> Conservative media outlets have a lot of dirt on these so-called Republicans who have attached themselves to Trump over the past few years.  Some higher up than you'd imagine.  They should think carefully about abandoning Trump right now.
1324458707179180037 2020-11-06 05:08:57 +0800 <realTomPappert> I'm really regretting voting Republican down ballot about now.  Should have just voted for The Donald and called it good.
1324456549440520193 2020-11-06 05:00:23 +0800 <realTomPappert> @WrongTimeline Secular humanists expect me to believe obvious lies?  That seems about right.
1324454048729366529 2020-11-06 04:50:27 +0800 <realTomPappert> You can't use any numbers from this election to make predictions going forward.  The only prediction you can make is that votes will not matter in the future.  The establishment and the media will select who they want to win and find enough votes to make it happen.

1324448735426945026 2020-11-06 04:29:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden was never a real candidate. He was anointed by globalists and supported by the media.

As soon as a critical mass fall asleep, like last night, they will call Arizona and Nevada and probably Alaska for Biden and crown him Puppet-King of America.

1324098196323393544 2020-11-05 05:16:25 +0800 <realTomPappert> Joe Biden did not declare victory - which would have earned the ire of big tech &amp; fact checkers - but instead declared that when they finish counting (rigging) the votes, he will be the victor.  This is something out of a Greek play.
1324095202303320064 2020-11-05 05:04:31 +0800 <realTomPappert> It's all coming together - even with comedic levels of fraud!
1324087737138454529 2020-11-05 04:34:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> Mitch McConnell and the Republican Establishment ought to be lined up around the block to kiss Trump's feet.

1324085533983866881 2020-11-05 04:26:06 +0800 <realTomPappert> Here's a silver lining about the obvious election theft:  Mainstream conservatives are going to be censored just like the rest of us for the first time. The only people who won't be censored are the Ben Shapiro lapdog-types who gleefully parrot the Fox News talking points.

You can't deny this is fraud with a straight face, and if you do, it just tells us you're full of shit.

1324025183963881472 2020-11-05 00:26:17 +0800 <realTomPappert> This election has proved that the Republicans are the party of disenfranchising voters who died before election day.  Those dead Americans are voters who mailed their ballot from beyond the grave using the U.S. Postal Service, and they matter to, say Democrats.

1324016141690425346 2020-11-04 23:50:21 +0800 <realTomPappert> It's funny: Normally when there's this much obvious election fraud, it's in a third world country and they call the United States to supervise and put an end to it.  Do... we call in the Marines?
1324014920309051393 2020-11-04 23:45:30 +0800 <realTomPappert> America, a country that's been terrified of a Russian coup for the past four years, seems pretty damn complacent about a Chinese coup happening instead.

1323934647718432772 2020-11-04 18:26:32 +0800 <realTomPappert> Fox News is actively agitating for a Biden presidency, with only Tucker Carlson voicing opposition.  They are not our friend.  Cable is dominated by Globalists.
1323934230464892928 2020-11-04 18:24:52 +0800 <realTomPappert> Watching the GOP abuse Ron Paul made me believe the Republican Party was hopeless, then Trump brought me back.  If the Republicans don't back Trump now then we know the party is worthless and not worth preserving.
1323932851235180551 2020-11-04 18:19:23 +0800 <realTomPappert> A lot of Americans, like me, thought that politics were a scam until Trump came along.  He made us realize that an outsider can still win.  This obvious attempt at election theft is proof we were right the first time.  If you're not a globalist, they literally won't let you win.
1323932414809460737 2020-11-04 18:17:39 +0800 <realTomPappert> Does anyone really believe this many people voted for the guy who showered with his daughter, raised a crackhead, and can't speak properly?
1323931617677758465 2020-11-04 18:14:29 +0800 <realTomPappert> Expect Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, etc. to throw the towel on the election.  Guarantee they're calling Trump like crazy begging him to concede.  I expect them to be apologizing for Trump by Friday.
1323930929451204609 2020-11-04 18:11:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> When I wake up 3 hours from now I expect:  - Trump lost Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Georgia  - Trump is banned from Twitter for questioning the election results - Biden is delivering his first speech as "Leader of America" - All Republicans are banned from Twitter

1323597444035289089 2020-11-03 20:06:36 +0800 <realTomPappert> I took two years of Spanish just for this day

1323596122036838402 2020-11-03 20:01:21 +0800 <realTomPappert> Ahh yes, the first Tuesday in November.  Americans now get to choose between the billionaire playboy and the senile pedophile.  Why is America like this?
1323526454131437570 2020-11-03 15:24:31 +0800 <realTomPappert> @ProPunter Presumably when he’s not advising Ukrainian energy companies via Zoom.

1323500527183892480 2020-11-03 13:41:29 +0800 <realTomPappert> Imagine living life on Easy Mode like Hunter Biden and still becoming a miserable crackhead who pays child support to a stripper.
1323367054393696264 2020-11-03 04:51:07 +0800 <realTomPappert> In 2012, protesting Romney, I registered and voted Libertarian.  In 2016, I tried to register Republican and Kansas kept me Libertarian.  In 2018, I tried to register R and Kansas kept me L.  In 2020, Kansas finally changed me to Republican.  People have faith in this system?
1323348854415216642 2020-11-03 03:38:48 +0800 <realTomPappert> Election results should start rolling in tomorrow at about 8 p.m. ET and be finished by April 2022.

1323335419602313217 2020-11-03 02:45:25 +0800 <realTomPappert> I just realized that since Facebook banned God Emperor Trump, I can reupload my Magnum Opus and the idiot Facebook algorithm will think it's an entirely new video.  Pretty sad to think I peaked at 21 but here it is:  https://t.co/g37vxzP9uC
1322653719566159875 2020-11-01 05:36:35 +0800 <realTomPappert> COVID lockdowns, tech censorship, and the media's disgusting pleasure in it all is our punishment for voting Trump in 2016.  This hell is our punishment for telling the global elite that we don't want the Crooked email lady or the guy who showered with his daughter to rule us.
1322651299855433730 2020-11-01 05:26:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> This dude straight up invaded the Trump Truck's lane.  You don't swerve into a lifted pickup's lane driving Walter White's car.
1322651069139324928 2020-11-01 05:26:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

1322274475195379714 2020-10-31 04:29:36 +0800 <realTomPappert> "indoor dining is allowed at 50% capacity"  Yeah that's shut down bro.   Restaurants literally can't afford their overhead if they limit dining to 50% capacity.   I bet people have to wear face diapers too.
1322269367975972871 2020-10-31 04:09:18 +0800 <realTomPappert> I have a working theory that Fact Checkers exclusively consist of failed journalists who found a niche: being nasty to real journos.

1322265610118639616 2020-10-31 03:54:22 +0800 <realTomPappert> This is puzzling:   We say leftists can't meme, and they can't, but they actually are so bad at making memes that they made something a right winger would laugh at and share.

1321963360146104327 2020-10-30 07:53:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> God has endorsed Trump. You can't make this stuff up.  I think they cancelled TV this year because they knew reality would be just as gripping.
1321962854065541121 2020-10-30 07:51:19 +0800 <realTomPappert> Is anyone checking on Keith Olbermann?   He seems to have completely lost his mind.  Since he can't hold down a job, he now does a weird YouTube show where he rants at Trump for 15 minutes a week from his bedroom.

1321517080739459072 2020-10-29 02:19:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> CNN compares Trump's victory to sudden death lmao   "Even if you believe he has a 10% chance of victory, that's still a chance ... If someone said you had a 10% of dying if you went outside today, you would probably stay inside. Right?"
1321516326561685507 2020-10-29 02:16:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> Journalists engaging in fantasy and wish-fulfillment exercises will be shocked when they, again, get it wrong and further lose the trust of their audience.
1321232942841159683 2020-10-28 07:30:55 +0800 <realTomPappert> Just in case AT&amp;T can’t find a buyer for CNN and it winds up going to auction, I would like to go ahead and place my opening bid for $1.

1320958394371657730 2020-10-27 13:19:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> I think more conservatives need to understand that 90% of college is just "But what if X is racist?"  No matter what class.  It shouldn't be surprising when this shows up in politics/journalism.   Or on the streets of Philadelphia.
1320957922990526464 2020-10-27 13:18:05 +0800 <realTomPappert> The best part:   Due to the extent of Trump Derangement Syndrome, there is absolutely no way of knowing if she's referring to Prince Harry or Harry Potter.
1320954476384129025 2020-10-27 13:04:23 +0800 <realTomPappert> Democrats in September: Riots are killing us in the polls, let's call it off and call Trump racist some more.  Democrats in October: Hunter Biden is killing us in the polls, let's get the riots fired up again.

1320455127573155842 2020-10-26 04:00:09 +0800 <realTomPappert> Also want to give a shoutout to my friends at  https://t.co/NvLxG80k0G who specifically made a Facebook-esque platform for conservatives.  As much as I love my friends, they'll be the first to tell you that the website would run much better if they had Zuckerberg's billions.
1320454598382047237 2020-10-26 03:58:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> Parler has done the best at not being censored, but they had updates to their app banned in the Apple App Store in 2019. It was later restored after political backlash.  It is a very anti competitive environment in my humble and non legal opinion.
1320454288360034304 2020-10-26 03:56:49 +0800 <realTomPappert> There have been several attempts to make platforms that are, at least, in disagreement with the left.  Minds was made by libertarians. It was banned from the app stores &amp; censored on Facebook.  Gab was made by a paleoconservative. It was banned from app stores &amp; domain providers.

1319685318090608642 2020-10-24 01:01:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> As further proof the ban has nothing to do with me breaking Facebook's rules (I haven't), they left up my side page, where I post memes I don't think are good enough for the main page.

1319660602827116545 2020-10-23 23:23:00 +0800 <realTomPappert> BREAKING: Today Facebook banned my pro-Trump Facebook page with nearly 350,000 likes for the 7th time in five years 10 days before Nov 3.  We reached millions of Millennial &amp; Gen Z supporters of President Trump - now gone without breaking a single rule.   https://t.co/K6I6BGem6N
1319647630318850048 2020-10-23 22:31:27 +0800 <realTomPappert> You’re not allowed to be a vocal, effective supporter of President Trump on Facebook.
1319647076762923010 2020-10-23 22:29:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> Today Facebook banned my pro-Trump meme page, God Emperor Trump, for the 7th time in five years.   I broke no rules. I ran no other page that got banned. They just banned my page that reaches millions 10 days before the election based on a totally bogus excuse.  Meddling?  https://t.co/Xvsq1Csf8Z
1319467785852981248 2020-10-23 10:36:49 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden's pledge to represent me despite my utter hatred of everything he and his Crooked family represents makes me feel like I'm going to be sent to a FEMA camp in his first 100 days. #Debates2020
1319467471032799232 2020-10-23 10:35:34 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden pledges to rejoin the Paris Accords, and will hold China accountable to the laughably lax standards which consider them a "developing country" despite them being our biggest geopolitical adversary and the world's biggest polluter.
1319466888339009538 2020-10-23 10:33:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> OHHHHHHHHHH!  Biden used to live near an electrical plant.  Now a lot of things make sense, poor guy.  #Debates2020
1319466495550853121 2020-10-23 10:31:41 +0800 <realTomPappert> @Mondomentus Oh man you're right. He does it whenever Trump wrecks him and he has no response.   It's his "Aw shucks, I'm just a guy from Scranton" face.
1319466031669235714 2020-10-23 10:29:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> Am I the only one who thinks Biden's super wide smile is creepy?  Looks like something from a mid-budget Netflix horror series.
1319465832397799427 2020-10-23 10:29:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> @BoltsLee oh man oh god i didn't even think of that, my favorite $6 lunch meal is now disavowed

1319464368522801153 2020-10-23 10:23:14 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden: I don't see red states or blue states, I see American states!  Also Biden: I couldn't do anything during the 8 years I spent as VP or the like 500 years I spent in Congress because Republicans are mean.
1319464193637208064 2020-10-23 10:22:32 +0800 <realTomPappert> Does Trump have to disavow Freddie Mercury now? #PoorBoys
1319464095121276930 2020-10-23 10:22:09 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden just pledged to be Barack Obama's third term.  Yikes!
1319463858965196801 2020-10-23 10:21:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden tried to change the penalties for possession of crack.  I can't even make a joke, he actually said that.
1319463380550287362 2020-10-23 10:19:19 +0800 <realTomPappert> Bro did I have too much to drink or did Biden just say Lincoln was the most racist president we've ever had?
1319463149838491654 2020-10-23 10:18:24 +0800 <realTomPappert> @BenInfoWarren Woah!  That sounds like something that could be abused to hurt enemies of the media but I'm just hearing about it so what do I know
1319462805502910464 2020-10-23 10:17:01 +0800 <realTomPappert> BIDEN JUST ADMITTED IT'S A RUSSIA HOAX LMAO
1319462538145370120 2020-10-23 10:15:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> "You know my character" says the man with the crackhead son.
1319461204851642369 2020-10-23 10:10:40 +0800 <realTomPappert> Alright, I'll bite. What's racism?
1319460258486603777 2020-10-23 10:06:54 +0800 <realTomPappert> "We owe [illegal immigrants]. We OWE them." - Joe Biden  like seriously who believes this shit
1319459964780466176 2020-10-23 10:05:44 +0800 <realTomPappert> BIDEN JUST THREW OBAMA UNDER THE BUS LMFAO
1319459828906024961 2020-10-23 10:05:12 +0800 <realTomPappert> China, Biden's sugar daddy, has hundreds of thousands of Muslims in concentration camps where they murder them and sell their organs.  But I'm expected to believe Biden's really worried about these 525 victims of human trafficking for some reason.   #Debates2020
1319459258333827073 2020-10-23 10:02:56 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden just said people are making $6/hr.  The federal minimum wage is $7.25.
1319458628521414657 2020-10-23 10:00:26 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden is pledging economic collapse under his malevolent reign. Oh, joy!
1319457762955452417 2020-10-23 09:56:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden just said "this crisis" - meaning COVID-19 - has been happening for THREE YEARS.  How long has he been in that basement?  #Debates2020
1319456506497142785 2020-10-23 09:52:00 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden opens his mouth, I take a sip of whiskey, and think of mean things to write about him on Twitter dot com.  Mostly as punishment for his attempt to bore me to sleep.
1319456088966729734 2020-10-23 09:50:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> My family liked its health insurance before Obamacare made everything so expensive, now I don't have any and take fish antibiotics when I get sick like Obama intended.  #Debates2020

1319454235642179585 2020-10-23 09:42:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> Joe coming in hard with the Malarkey Tour reference!  Solid performance from the guy with the crackhead Ukrainian expert son!
1319453366750224384 2020-10-23 09:39:31 +0800 <realTomPappert> Have to admit, Biden was holding his own before he lost his ability to speak!

1316793222547623937 2020-10-16 01:29:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> Since we've got, like, 19 days left to keep big tech from stealing the election, here's a solid strategy:  1.

1316232078875398145 2020-10-14 12:19:16 +0800 <realTomPappert> The audio speaks for itself.   There are two options:  1. The Biden associate who promised to inform the then-VP of the situation never did and Biden genuinely didn't know.  2. Biden knew and did nothing.   Either way, America deserves a response from Joe.

1314033592725536769 2020-10-08 10:43:16 +0800 <realTomPappert> Tonight we all learned one thing, plexiglass works.   I hereby move that we keep a layer of plexiglass between Kamala and the outside world indefinitely.   #VPDebate
1314031088122187777 2020-10-08 10:33:19 +0800 <realTomPappert> Richard Spencer's Charlottesville march inspired Joe Biden to run for president.   Richard Spencer endorsed Joe Biden, so I guess that makes sense.   #VPDebate

1314016877681741827 2020-10-08 09:36:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala starts rattling off all these buzzwords in that annoying tone and I instantly tune out to think of mean things to write on twitter dot com

1314015185129148417 2020-10-08 09:30:08 +0800 <realTomPappert> @reallouiehuey Sure!
1314014643954876418 2020-10-08 09:27:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala just called theft and publication of tax documents "investigative journalism."
1314013755211157506 2020-10-08 09:24:27 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala's giving off serious middle school math teacher vibes and it's about to make me look for my homework before she threatens to call my dad.
1314013268197990400 2020-10-08 09:22:30 +0800 <realTomPappert> The most annoying thing about both debates is that Republicans are doing what they always do and ceding ground.  We should be throwing Fauci under the bus and joking that Kalama can't lock down her knees but she wants to lock down the country for the flu.
1314012698661789699 2020-10-08 09:20:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> Someone get Kamala a box of wine and a can of Friskies, this is boring.
1314012045185101826 2020-10-08 09:17:39 +0800 <realTomPappert> I feel like they put Kamala in a Clockwork Orange type setup and made her watch thousands of hours of Michelle Obama talking in an effort to make her more likeable and it backfired immensely.  #VPDebate
1314011704985030657 2020-10-08 09:16:18 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala knows a thing or two about super spreaders. #VPDebate
1314011376998846464 2020-10-08 09:15:00 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala is making Americans remember how ugly they were in the early months of the pandemic when we were told 2 million people would die.  But people have eyes. Look around. Have 2 million people died, or is Kamala full of crap? #VPDebate

1314010158180315136 2020-10-08 09:10:09 +0800 <realTomPappert> Kamala's runningmate, some old guy named Biden, Trump's COVID response "xenophobia."

1314009679295639552 2020-10-08 09:08:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> I'm glad this debate is happening because I think most Americans forgot how genuinely boring Kalama Harris is.
1314009415251570688 2020-10-08 09:07:12 +0800 <realTomPappert> What's next, will the Commission on Presidential Debates request Pence pee while sitting down too?
1314008979605983237 2020-10-08 09:05:28 +0800 <realTomPappert> Pence and Kamala seated at separate tables separated by plexiglass gives me old married couple vibes
1314008781819346946 2020-10-08 09:04:41 +0800 <realTomPappert> This debate is already dumb and stupid.

1313354475923439618 2020-10-06 13:44:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> Remember back when the MSM insisted Trump was saying “bigly” when he was actually saying “big league?”   They’ve been intentionally lying about him since 2015.  About the pettiest of things.

1313181837284519936 2020-10-06 02:18:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> You'd think that the Biden campaign would be capitalizing off this and doing as many events as possible while Trump is trapped at Walter Reed.  Instead, I don't think anyone has mentioned him once since Thursday.

1312210534545068034 2020-10-03 09:59:05 +0800 <realTomPappert> @NaturalNewsSHTF Exactly, owning a single piece of property doesn't make you rich. Owning 5 properties doesn't make you rich.  There are opportunities in my city to buy 1940s-era temporary factory housing that's been "converted" into apartments for $30k.   $30k for 20 units that each pay $400/mo.

1312182396175872001 2020-10-03 08:07:17 +0800 <realTomPappert> Maybe because if the landlord can’t pay their mortgage then the bank will own the buildings, and if they can’t pay their property taxes, the IRS will.   This whole “eat the landlords” thing has been the absolute dumbest part of the pandemic.

1311397429162508289 2020-10-01 04:08:06 +0800 <realTomPappert> “Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children.”   Trump's kids: An executive, a media personality, a WH aid, and a lawyer.  Biden's kid: A FREAKING CRACKHEAD LMAO
1311396660564701185 2020-10-01 04:05:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> If elected, will Joe Biden allow his drug addled son to live in the White House basement?  I'm thinking Hunter probably spent the $3.5m on crack years ago.
1311396370402639872 2020-10-01 04:03:53 +0800 <realTomPappert> @CitizenAnalyst @TrumpWarRoom Yes. The crack smoking and sister-in-law philandering.

1311337416679194624 2020-10-01 00:09:38 +0800 <realTomPappert> Last night I had the strangest dream that Chris Wallace was running for President and screaming at President Trump while Biden was trying to hold back tears in the corner.   Anyway how was the debate?
1311191844257173510 2020-09-30 14:31:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> Could you imagine if they let the whiny Libertarian candidate on the stage with those two men and Chris Wallace?  Nails on a chalkboard just thinking about it.
1311183981359104000 2020-09-30 13:59:56 +0800 <realTomPappert> @photocode827 The video I have ends at 1:36:50. Can you send me yours?
1311179321646686210 2020-09-30 13:41:25 +0800 <realTomPappert> On top of his horrific performance, Biden picked one of the ugliest ties I've ever seen.  Maybe to distract from that weird cord-looking-thing that kept poking out of his jacket?  https://t.co/ogNPpUa71U
1311176928460759041 2020-09-30 13:31:54 +0800 <realTomPappert> @ProPunter Agreed, once Wallace and Biden started talking about covid and climate change it got boring.
1311175848616230914 2020-09-30 13:27:37 +0800 <realTomPappert> Alpha Don destroyed opponent Chris Wallace even after an elderly dementia patient wandered on stage
1311175025786052608 2020-09-30 13:24:21 +0800 <realTomPappert> I kept wondering what Wallace was going to do about Trump being an Alpha Chad and refusing to be quiet.  I think he was on the verge of storming out at least twice
1311167313480163334 2020-09-30 12:53:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump At least Nixon had radio listeners believing he won the debate.   Biden only has fellow sufferers of dementia believing he won.
1311142915511590914 2020-09-30 11:16:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> I don't know who lost the debate.   I just know America won.
1311142522513690626 2020-09-30 11:15:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> @JackPosobiec Crackheads should be openly mocked and their parents should be as well for their parental failures
1311142423343570944 2020-09-30 11:14:48 +0800 <realTomPappert> Big 2016 energy tonight.   America's not knocked out, but it's on the ropes and about to get its second wind.
1311139319403421703 2020-09-30 11:02:28 +0800 <realTomPappert> Observation: The hair plugs Biden got in 2019 have already fallen out due to the stress of running against Trump.  https://t.co/4CKrOWGz4t
1311138276884000769 2020-09-30 10:58:19 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump withstood 90 minutes of a 2 vs. 1 screaming match and came out looking good.  Winner by default.
1311133289432993792 2020-09-30 10:38:30 +0800 <realTomPappert> Pretty sure Biden is gonna start a civil war after tonight
1311132926025891847 2020-09-30 10:37:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> Wallace pushing Trump to agree to the globalist plan for his defeat.  Trump denies.  This is masterful and will be viewed as a monumental moment in history for hundreds of years to come.
1311132557254238210 2020-09-30 10:35:35 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden and Wallace are literally giving away the game plan.  Biden loses and refuses to concede. Several Democrat governors say he is the rightful president. They ask Pentagon to intervene, Pentagon says no. House says it's Biden, Senate says it's Trump.   It winds up at SCOTUS.
1311132119280820225 2020-09-30 10:33:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump is telling Americans to vote the same way they have since like 1787, and Wallace has no idea what he's talking about.
1311131398842003457 2020-09-30 10:30:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump is DESTROYING Biden and his Deep State Cronies.  You love to see it.
1311130534572183554 2020-09-30 10:27:33 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden disavows the Green New Deal three times then endorses it in the next sentence LMAO

1311130310705328130 2020-09-30 10:26:40 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden being forced to repeatedly disavow the Green New Deal is HILARIOUS
1311130207148007424 2020-09-30 10:26:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden's bringing up "Global Warming" when it's been "Climate Change" for the past 15 years lmao
1311129354303344644 2020-09-30 10:22:52 +0800 <realTomPappert> Alright I tuned out, is Biden done talking about "green" stuff?
1311128194259587074 2020-09-30 10:18:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> Crackheads are going to be PISSED tonight!
1311127836560953346 2020-09-30 10:16:50 +0800 <realTomPappert> "He's fixed it. He's worked on it." Joe Biden about Hunter Biden's crack addiction.
1311127616242376704 2020-09-30 10:15:57 +0800 <realTomPappert> BIDEN NO YOUR SON GOT KICKED OUT FOR SMOKING CRACK STOP STOP STOP STOP NOOOOOOO
1311127295973785602 2020-09-30 10:14:41 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden's 2 minute case for why he should get your vote is a stuttering, shaky mess.  This could not be going better for Trump unless Biden and Wallace were both struck down in an act of God.
1311126441828986881 2020-09-30 10:11:17 +0800 <realTomPappert> "WE'RE DONE SIR" said the effete newsman to the President of the United States of America.
1311124990713122819 2020-09-30 10:05:31 +0800 <realTomPappert> "Dog whistles and racism"  Is he just spouting off Buzzfeed talking points at this point?
1311124521039081473 2020-09-30 10:03:39 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump bringing up The 1776 Commission and bashing the 1619 Project is red meat for any American who has ever encountered a public school ever.

1311120506943426560 2020-09-30 09:47:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> Why is Biden afraid to look Trump in the eyes?
1311119973927002113 2020-09-30 09:45:35 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden just pledged to raise your taxes LMAO
1311119737229893634 2020-09-30 09:44:39 +0800 <realTomPappert> bruh nobody cares about taxes  how much did hunter biden pay in taxes?  that could be interesting
1311119482077745152 2020-09-30 09:43:38 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden laughing at Trump saving football while Americans were willing to riot about whether players kneel or stand at games like 30 minutes ago lmao  This guy is ridiculously out of touch with society.
1311119114988130309 2020-09-30 09:42:11 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden is saying you should lose:  Your job. Your school. Your beautiful smile.  Because corona?
1311118742928199682 2020-09-30 09:40:42 +0800 <realTomPappert> I FIGURED IT OUT!  Biden can't pronounce words with more than 2 syllables.
1311117965794959365 2020-09-30 09:37:37 +0800 <realTomPappert> Joe Biden, running to be the Leader of the Free World, is practically BEGGING for Wallace, or frankly anyone, to reel Trump in.  This guy can't handle Orange Man, how is he going to handle Xi Jinping, Iran, or North Korea?
1311116886231449604 2020-09-30 09:33:19 +0800 <realTomPappert> "Will he just shush for a minute?" - Joe Biden, a grown ass man.
1311116518776856576 2020-09-30 09:31:52 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump: Vaccines are coming soon, things are going to be okay, America's the best!  Biden: NO THE VACCINES WILL NEVER COME AND WE'RE ALL GONNA FREAKING DIE NO MATTER WHAT   Assuming you believe in vaccines in the first place, which is the better message to win voters?
1311116041645363200 2020-09-30 09:29:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden appears to be talking far too softly and they keep raising his mic to give him a chance of being heard.  Something's wrong with this guy on several levels.
1311115508884942848 2020-09-30 09:27:51 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden being this pro-mask on national TV is basically asking for a civil war lmao
1311113724439064576 2020-09-30 09:20:45 +0800 <realTomPappert> FACT CHECK: Biden's full of shit lmao.  https://t.co/FwOFKJjJ1z
1311113273752932352 2020-09-30 09:18:58 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden is fading into the background and it's 18 minutes in.  This is the Trump Show.   Get bent.

1311112722717773824 2020-09-30 09:16:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> I wasn't sure if it was smart for Trump to actually do debate prep this year.  Apparently it was the right move.
1311112538403332097 2020-09-30 09:16:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> This has 2016 REPUBLICAN debate energy.  Trump is a King among peasants.
1311112276280250368 2020-09-30 09:15:00 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump is currently debating two people: Biden and this loser from Fox News.
1311112115789459457 2020-09-30 09:14:22 +0800 <realTomPappert> Wallace looks like he's freaking out. Things are not going well for Biden.
1311111873627074560 2020-09-30 09:13:24 +0800 <realTomPappert> HOLY CRAP THE VA KILL SHOT   totally unexpected and brilliant.  And now Joe laughs about killing US veterans.  Amazing.
1311111727749234689 2020-09-30 09:12:49 +0800 <realTomPappert> "Your party wants to go with socialized healthcare. And they're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that."  mic dropped
1311111333111377920 2020-09-30 09:11:15 +0800 <realTomPappert> Trump already refusing to play by the rules. This bodes quite well!
1311110865446490112 2020-09-30 09:09:24 +0800 <realTomPappert> Biden's eyes look like black marbles.   Did AOC give him her eye contacts or something?
1311110599858950145 2020-09-30 09:08:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> Let's gooooooooooooooooooo ORANGE MAN!
1311084114309787648 2020-09-30 07:23:06 +0800 <realTomPappert> Murder Hornets must have read The Art of the Comeback
1311053332044222464 2020-09-30 05:20:47 +0800 <realTomPappert> 2 weeks ago Democrats were accusing Trump of snorting adderall  now they're saying it's okay to snort it just in case Biden might indulge  and meanwhile it's basically speed and we give it to small children instead of parenting them  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1311019215466438667 2020-09-30 03:05:13 +0800 <realTomPappert> I hope today's LGBT faux pas will cause conservatives to stop and think about what they're doing when they pander for the votes of interest groups.

1310844471098126337 2020-09-29 15:30:50 +0800 <realTomPappert> It must be an incredibly frustrating experience to be a young democrat wanting to break into journalism.

It's an academic worldview that views everything in America racist, imperialistic, and structurally unsound.  It's taught to college Freshman in Communication courses.

That said, only someone with a very sick brain would try to promote wholesome family values using preteens twerking.   That's undeniable.   And Netflix obviously didn't care about the plot.

WHY THE FRICK DID YOU FORCE GIRLS TO TWERK ON CAMERA IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO START THEIR ACTING CAREER  like holy sh*t what is wrong with these people
1306014690686926854 2020-09-16 07:39:01 +0800 <realTomPappert> Cuties is about a Muslim girl rejecting Islam and embracing the worst of the West then realizing both Western degeneracy &amp; radical Islam suck.  One of the final scenes is her jumping rope.  If not for the 45 minutes of 9 year olds twerking, I could almost get behind that message.

1301195265190383620 2020-09-03 00:28:20 +0800 <realTomPappert> It’s amazing that CDC disease statistics are now as controversial as FBI crime statistics.

1300625421357244416 2020-09-01 10:43:59 +0800 <realTomPappert> Do you think Trump realizes his poll numbers trend upwards when Jared is out playing pretend-Statesman?
1300625186136481792 2020-09-01 10:43:03 +0800 <realTomPappert> I really don't think any establishment mouthpiece in media, social media, TV, or academia, care about money.  We can win thousands of lawsuits and get billions of dollars and they'll somehow get more.  However, they really don't like the associated embarrassment.   #FightBack
1300621995659362305 2020-09-01 10:30:22 +0800 <realTomPappert> Is it a coincidence that Trump is the most based he's been in months while Jared Kushner is taking selfies in Israel?
