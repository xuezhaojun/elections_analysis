Spot on with the great reset agenda. Next will come UBI and debt forgiveness of you give up the right yo own anything forever. The evil of these bar stewards is astounding.

1309454835037728768 2020-09-25 19:28:55 +0800 <BPGeordie> @410MLXVI Absolutely ridiculous but no suprise as this was all in the UN Compact on Migration
1309454505814233089 2020-09-25 19:27:37 +0800 <BPGeordie> @PymPurnell If he was white, his name/photo would have been released almost immediately followed up by constant articles/news reports decrying him as far right and all the usual phobes &amp; ists. Non white equals huge delay in release of name/description &amp; "mental health issues" excuse 🤷‍♂️
1309453118346801154 2020-09-25 19:22:06 +0800 <BPGeordie> Oh great, another 'stabbing of peace'. Nobody of European descent should have to live this way in the countries that their ancestors toiled to build, maintain and protect.
1309450828395184129 2020-09-25 19:13:00 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ftwrharry @wolfiecindy Just here for the lovely ratio and comments 🤭🍿

Tend to block any with pro joo/antifa/BLM on their timeline as you'll never get through to them, they're too far gone/too thick and you know they'll report for the slightest little thing.
1309449228939407361 2020-09-25 19:06:39 +0800 <BPGeordie> @SallyAnneHarri4 Aye and not just any illegals. All will be fighting aged men filled with absolute hatred for all of us. 🤬

1308895441883402240 2020-09-24 06:26:06 +0800 <BPGeordie> @YetAnotherSperg Bollocks, absolutely massive F. Had a feeling that this was coming as I noticed the joo he was arguing with earlier seemed to have got another WN account who'd went to to nose with him nuked.

While most are still sleeping, I've definitely noticed signs today that some of the anglos are finally awakening from their long slumber. All we can do is guide them towards PA as I
1308785696606425093 2020-09-23 23:10:00 +0800 <BPGeordie> @DerrickDay_ If I got fired from 110 jobs or kicked out of 110 pubs, I would definitely start looking at what was wrong with my own behaviour before blaming everybody else for persecuting me. But of course, I'm just an uppity goy - what do I know? 🤔

1308773706886459393 2020-09-23 22:22:22 +0800 <BPGeordie> @BritGroyp @UKfollowgain Yeah, the Ezio Assassin's Creed  games were my favourites in the series. I do have a soft spot for Black Flag as well but thats probably because it's a great pirate simulator.

1304626159620063232 2020-09-12 11:41:29 +0800 <BPGeordie> @_AngI0 @vix000 Hey Chris @PatrioticTalk14, was this you on your last trip back to Birmingham? 😉
1304624352546230275 2020-09-12 11:34:19 +0800 <BPGeordie> @BasedScotsman Spot on kelamaty. He's just another release valve/holding pen to keep pissed of normies from going full ethno Nat.
1304607777931898880 2020-09-12 10:28:27 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ninnyd101 @privvv_colee Once they get past the electoral commission there will be an alternative.  https://t.co/MfZYyzKQIJ

1304607126753611778 2020-09-12 10:25:52 +0800 <BPGeordie> @privvv_colee So the choices for British prime minister are a jew and two Indians. I'll take an ethnically British option though it wont make any difference as all mainstream parties are anti-white, pro mass immigration globalists anyway. There is an alternative though  https://t.co/MfZYyzKQIJ
1304605711226277889 2020-09-12 10:20:14 +0800 <BPGeordie> @billygerent The cowards disabled comments and hid the like/dislike ratio 🤬
1304605291577827334 2020-09-12 10:18:34 +0800 <BPGeordie> @BasedScotsman What a disgusting nonce so called "based lozza" is. Just another anti-white, preachy, globalist elite who sees nothing wrong with paedophilia. 🤢🤮
1304604618140405762 2020-09-12 10:15:54 +0800 <BPGeordie> @HroyOf @BGT I've never watched reality TV and rarely watch TV at all anymore as it's full of anti-white globalist propaganda. However, I applaud those that watch this kind of stuff turning it off and doing something else. 👍👏
1304603442313297921 2020-09-12 10:11:13 +0800 <BPGeordie> @BaronStrucker Every now and then I used look into 9/11 again and end up finding more and more evidence that the joos did it. I thought I'd seen just about everything but some new stuff in this thread for me. Outstanding work mate 👏👏👏
1304600284417740801 2020-09-12 09:58:40 +0800 <BPGeordie> @LVolente Demonic, (redacted) it with fire
1304290042064633856 2020-09-11 13:25:53 +0800 <BPGeordie> @RiseofTAS WTF is that abomination?!?! 🤢🤮
1303746372332654593 2020-09-10 01:25:32 +0800 <BPGeordie> @LVolente Oy vey got, stop noticing things!!!
1303745653055664133 2020-09-10 01:22:40 +0800 <BPGeordie> @Eng85Mike @FunkeMonke7 @JakeHepple1 @Puuthon Don't even acknowledge the term racist. It's now just an anti-white slur that was originally popularised by Trotsky to shut down dissenting opinions in the USSR. Notice how ony white people can be racist by the neo bokshevik left?
1303744702311784449 2020-09-10 01:18:54 +0800 <BPGeordie> @JakeHepple1 I'd been losing interest in the Premier league for a while due to the constant virtue signalling and globohomo propaganda. The players kneeling in submission was a final straw and I've not bothered watching it since. Didn't bother watching England as knew it'd be more of the same
1303564248216408065 2020-09-09 13:21:50 +0800 <BPGeordie> @NormanSLondon @snononell Except at work, at school, on a train/bus, in supermarkets etc. The virus is so clever it knows not to attack these mass gatherings and only attack homes with more than 6 people in them...
1303561913423540225 2020-09-09 13:12:33 +0800 <BPGeordie> @SnowWolfy7 @carlaadamowl @AdrianLiard @IsabelOakeshott @BorisJohnson With the low average IQ of the third world shitholes they come from I sincerely doubt it.
1303555675839135744 2020-09-09 12:47:46 +0800 <BPGeordie> @AlgernonOneShot @thisislaurat I don't even need to check the early life section after seeing her hideous face. Evil bitch.
1303544270478024705 2020-09-09 12:02:27 +0800 <BPGeordie> @410MLXVI Imagine my shock...
1301698387843129345 2020-09-04 09:47:34 +0800 <BPGeordie> @AngeloJohnGage I think I 👃 what you mean...
1301696968113217539 2020-09-04 09:41:56 +0800 <BPGeordie> @OrwellNGoode Oh we see you Michael Obama, in fact we saw way too much of you when your knob was flopping around when you were dancing on Oprah
1301693553249312769 2020-09-04 09:28:22 +0800 <BPGeordie> @adammiller84uk @Revsimonsideway Indeed it is, all part of the Kalergi plan.
1301168109311668226 2020-09-02 22:40:26 +0800 <BPGeordie> @EAHelp You still haven't fixed the issue with players/items that were listed when you took the servers down. I currently have 61 items in limbo on my transfer list that I can not re-list or send to my club.  https://t.co/N4FenbS7cR
1301151828839739393 2020-09-02 21:35:44 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ea_fixthegame @EAHelp Same here, seems to be any players/items that were listed at the exact moment the servers went down are stuck in limbo. Taking up space on my transfer list but can't sell or send to club
1301133185099722761 2020-09-02 20:21:39 +0800 <BPGeordie> @EAHelp @gobs1982 Are you trying to fix the issue where any items that were listed on the transfer market at the time the servers went down are now stuck in limbo? They are on my transfer list but can't be re-listed or sent to my club.
1301130635789168641 2020-09-02 20:11:32 +0800 <BPGeordie> @PatriotActive66 I bet none of the twats have ever donated anything to homeless shelters or food banks. They care nothing for our needy, only for virtue signalling their submission to their replacements. I think I despise these traitors more than those who seek to destroy us.
1301129743169998849 2020-09-02 20:07:59 +0800 <BPGeordie> @MSANNCOOPER @AeHcat It might improve the horrendous smell of those unwashed work dodging oxygen thieves.
1301118535867994113 2020-09-02 19:23:27 +0800 <BPGeordie> @correct_again I don't like that trotskyite word as it is an anti-white slur. I consider my self ethno centric and a race realist.
1301117894839894016 2020-09-02 19:20:54 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ScottPratt1974 @Kemo01414 @EAFIFADirect Yep, looking like classic EA right here. They take it down for 10 hours and make it even more broken than it was before the maintenance! 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
1301117090976366593 2020-09-02 19:17:42 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ScottPratt1974 @Kemo01414 @EAFIFADirect They are back up but things aren't working properly. Any items I had listed at the point they took the servers down can not be re-list Ed or sent to my club. I've seen some say they can't send won transfer bud items to their clubs either.
1301111247912435712 2020-09-02 18:54:29 +0800 <BPGeordie> Absolutely disgusting 🤬
1301110924351279107 2020-09-02 18:53:12 +0800 <BPGeordie> @nilus110 Brilliant mate 😂😂😂
1301108841795514371 2020-09-02 18:44:55 +0800 <BPGeordie> @danropes93 @EAFIFADirect Yeah, I was planning on picking up the players in the early hours when the prices drop but now I'll only have a short time to get them and the market will be way up after the long downtime. Might just buy his TOTY instead to save the hassle 🤔🤷‍♂️
1301108014515183616 2020-09-02 18:41:38 +0800 <BPGeordie> @Kemo01414 @EAFIFADirect Don't worry, this message often pops up when the servers go down. You should be able to get back in on the App now although re-listing your items isn't working yet
1301107537492803586 2020-09-02 18:39:45 +0800 <BPGeordie> @EAFIFADirect @EAHelp I can log back into the FIFA App now and while I can bid on players it won't let me re-list anything I had listed at the time you took the servers down. Is this already a known issue?
1301105710621691910 2020-09-02 18:32:29 +0800 <BPGeordie> @ea_fixthegame @sbc_tips The market seems a bit fooked, just got back in on the App and can't list anyone.
1300852192891539456 2020-09-02 01:45:06 +0800 <BPGeordie> @GroyperUber What a good boy he is. He realised the jogger needed a shower and decided to help improve the horrendous smell eminating from him.
