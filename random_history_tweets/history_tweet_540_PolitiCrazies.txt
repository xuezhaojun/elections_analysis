How can you enjoy your evening when you act so heartlessly to the people who need your help? Disgusting

Tomorrow please start talking about the millions who are going to be evicted because no-one is helping them. Go on the networks and try and get them to focus on this tragedy to come of literally millions going homeless in winter during covid.

1342558911870754816 2020-12-26 03:52:42 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Tell me “not all cops”. We need massive oversight of the people hired to protect us. It is not their right to that job, it’s our choice.

You can’t vote for someone who isn’t there. Two years is not a lot of time and if there’s no-one to vote for you will get Rnc or DNC.

1337586988040523776 2020-12-12 10:36:03 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Alicauni1 @inihelene Then of course he must agree to the cancelation and then you negotiate the cost of his waste of time based on where you were going to go on your date and how long it would be and if he thought he was getting sex, you pay for a prostitute and maybe you’re even &amp; it’s fair. 🙄🙄🙈
1337585738175672321 2020-12-12 10:31:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Alicauni1 @inihelene Yes agreeing to go on a date is like a contract signed in blood, of course you can’t cancel in 2 hours, he would’ve been all dressed or something and couldn’t possibly have done anything else with his time and accepted it gracefully.

And trump is not the one end, he’s just a flamethrower grifter the new Qrazies are likely to become the one end because they’re nuts. The opposite end of that are not represented in gov anywhere.

It looks to me as if the point is to pull back at least enough to fix the problems at home. What’s the point otherwise? Things could be really great for the American people if they were gov’s focus.

No one was suggesting to vote for anybody who just wants the political position for its own sake. The choice is between what’s there. Someone is going to win. If you want change you need to pick people with policy you want. So WHO would that be?

1333550660009259010 2020-12-01 07:17:08 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I wish I could believe that you actually want people of integrity and that the optics rebuilding isn’t just a strategy. You say you don’t lie to each other but then does that mean you are all complicit in the dirty crap CIA still does and just convince yourselves it’s patriotic?

None of them are heaven bound. “Screw helping my fellow man!” ( not a quote but summary of their intent) is pretty contradictory to the message the religious say they believe. WTF happened to WWJD?

Maybe? I think it’s more systemic than defund the police.
1332404359179677699 2020-11-28 03:22:08 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @AsIfUknow So few patriots willing to sacrifice a few weeks of interaction to save fellow Americans ( especially hospital workers) from a virus.

1332290437965631490 2020-11-27 19:49:27 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump Yes he did. You suck and you lost.&amp; he got those votes because of you. All your lying and fear mongering still could not stop the tidal wave of people that ate their own mistrust of Joe Biden because you are so much worse they know you are a dog that needs to be put down. Get out
1332289615181574146 2020-11-27 19:46:11 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump No. You lost. Primary point should’ve been happy thanksgiving military but once again you cannot help being a bloated self-interested windbag full of lies and deceit that never should have been elected in the first place. You are a toxic nasty filthy disgusting swamp monster
1332288520623370242 2020-11-27 19:41:50 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @DEMS_R_GOP @realDonaldTrump He doesn’t need balls for that, he just needs a pen, and it has nothing to do with Hilary, it would just be right.
1332288170172567554 2020-11-27 19:40:27 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @PoliticusSarah Hey but it’s my religious right to spread covid into the world after I attend a superspreader event! When I exercise my religious rights it’s okay if it kills some people. That’s in the bible right? #AmyCovidBarrett #AmyConeyBarrett  Seems like a terrorist plot to kill Americans
1332286031786373121 2020-11-27 19:31:57 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> #DiaperDon ? Why, what happens when we say that ? Does his desk get smaller? He acts more like a baby? ( hardly possible )

1330676564154064900 2020-11-23 08:56:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I think he’s offering to feed all the people his party crushed by having a tiny stimulus for a giant problem. That’s nice, I hope all those millions show up and hope he’s got enough for everyone🤷‍♂️
1330675496787521536 2020-11-23 08:52:15 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Nice . “We will sicken you”

The people at the top are begging for a #GeneralStrike and they’re not even saying “ Let them eat cake” anymore, they’re saying “ let them eat shit &amp; let them eat it under a fkn bridge”. Keep squeezing, we won’t forget &amp; a little crumb won’t cut it

1330668294400045056 2020-11-23 08:23:38 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> This can be fixed but only if you make them fix it. If it isn’t going in that direction soon after Jan 21, then it’s #GeneralStrike time. If they can’t do the right thing when they get power, take the power back. Looking at you @JoeBiden @Transition46 @KamalaHarris
1330666721854828544 2020-11-23 08:17:23 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @thehill No, big Pharma gouges America because guys like you and the complicit house members and senators agree to let them. R’s and D’s line their pockets with Pharma bucks. It isn’t ANY OTHER COUNTRY’s fault.
1330665802102665219 2020-11-23 08:13:44 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @thehill I’d rather have a @GOP that wasn’t captured

What can they say about it🤷‍♂️ make American flags great again😜 but seriously, it would be great to see and probably own some trumpers👍🏼
1330663362385104898 2020-11-23 08:04:02 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @32countydriver @AsIfUknow @joelockhart When good people fail to act . Also when stupid people vote against their own interest while being heavily worked by a con-man who lies constantly but followers believe because they want to.
1330662667678330882 2020-11-23 08:01:17 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @KamalaHarris #MedicareForAll BABY!!!!!!!! Help the people out! Tell @JoeBiden how it would save so many lives from financial and health devastation. It’s right there, start phasing it in.. kids and 55+ first, then 45+, 35+, 25+ then ALL IN ! No networks, no fighting with health profiteers! 🎉
1330661564085645312 2020-11-23 07:56:54 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Maybe an IQ test to vote? 🙈🙈
1330659346028564481 2020-11-23 07:48:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @AsIfUknow All it takes to switch that out is that when you protest, wear a flag and what will they say? Overwhelm their use of the flag and show that your patriotism means you protest. I think BLM should steal the Gadsden flag. Don’t let the right wing “own” patriotism and revolt
1330657830358175745 2020-11-23 07:42:03 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @peterdaou Absolutely. The whole thing is listed under “Features, not bugs”

We are waiting,but if this doesn’t become day one level stuff Chuck, you will find yourself staring at a #GeneralStrike
1330655317735190528 2020-11-23 07:32:04 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Never forget , the US war machine is never about justice. And you pay for it, instead of #MedicareForAll , ending homelessness, ending poverty, building schools and infrastructure, all so people and corporations can make an obscene profit killing people that are no threat to you

Please. If you have any actual manifesting power.. manifest that🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
1330651067407855616 2020-11-23 07:15:11 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @NPR Because the Dems were too cowardly to run on #MedicareForAll and #GND and looked like Republican light and voters said I’ll just go with Republican. Except the ones who WON because they showed they were different by NOT being Republican light. And they’re not learning from it.🙈

1330619584840413187 2020-11-23 05:10:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @dataandpolitics I have evidence that the entire staff of the fox network paid millions to switch the votes from Trump to Biden.

Get the message to him that we don’t want lobbyists and wall streeters and Rahm Emanuel in the White House again or in the cabinet. Or he’s going to have some headaches over a #GeneralStrike

This whole election loss denial thing though is really digging the fascist enablers out of state legislature’s woodwork. We’re taking names though and their dirty work will not stay unnoticed in the future.

1329794931783839745 2020-11-20 22:33:12 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump @newsmax @OANN @FoxNews Nope
1329794750384312323 2020-11-20 22:32:29 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @GOP Did you guys misspell sYdney or did c-span? This isn’t about intimidation @GOP , this is about integrity and honesty. You guys have neither.This doubling down on Trump is exposing how little credibility you deserve. You used to be better, no more. Trump lost. Now you’re cheating.
1329788593062244353 2020-11-20 22:08:01 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @LOLGOP 2020 Republican party policy - whatever trump wants🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🙈🙈 disgraceful. These republicans have no integrity .
1329788081331900416 2020-11-20 22:05:59 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Ask EVERY REPUBLICAN, house and senate, governors, state legislators what they think about this and get them #OnTheRecord this activity is supposed to be illegal and it’s called election interference.
1329787235139510272 2020-11-20 22:02:37 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Chris17710407 @MittRomney He’s the traffic cop blowing his whistle and weakly saying stop (SOMETIMES) while raging Buffalo are stampeding by. I don’t hate him for that but it doesn’t generate credibility for him to me either. He is no beacon of courage IMO
1329786378356469762 2020-11-20 21:59:13 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Chris17710407 @MittRomney Patriotism to me is standing for country over party. When it’s the other way 80% of the time &amp; the right way 20% you get 20% credit (maybe) but it doesn’t take away the 80🤷‍♂️ when you DO things to support unpatriotic people &amp; just TALK about not doing that, are you trying?
1329750725543550977 2020-11-20 19:37:33 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @MittRomney I hope you are willing to do more than tweet. Everybody saw this coming in 2016 Mitt and you constantly hedge your bets when it comes to action. You were participatory in this terrible presidency and tsk tsk-ing about it now isn’t redeeming and it’s not leading
1329747971894882305 2020-11-20 19:26:36 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @nreweel @WalkerBragman Well I don’t disagree that people have a great ability to ignore the suffering of others but i do think that it would make it harder to pretend it’s not as bad as it is and i believe you can motivate people this way but if no-one sees it, it’s just a thought exercise  🙈
1328162188289249282 2020-11-16 10:25:16 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @LewangJames Why do you think I’m not speaking from experience? And who said anything about closing everything down forever because? It can be managed. But Hundreds of thousands of people are DEAD. More than normal and more than flu but you don’t actually care. So keep being stupid, stupid.

How do his cult members not see if he hired the best, he wouldn’t have to replace them🤔 OR that the best people seem to always turn into the worst people after exposure to HIM🙈🙈
1328140873318666241 2020-11-16 09:00:34 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @CREWcrew When did the Trump transition start getting this? I guess it’s different because Hillary wasn’t the whiny little crybaby Donald is🤔 and it was not loyalists who put party ( or cult leader) over country in charge of these things🤔🙄
1328139932569915394 2020-11-16 08:56:50 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @TexasLeftist ABC wants your eyeballs. If you tell them they can’t have them if you mostly see disgruntled Trump voters whining on their station, they’ll look at that
1328139092941565953 2020-11-16 08:53:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @drvox Nope. You can tell them your not watching anymore of that with a friendly( for real) call or email. Tell them you are not seeing enough representation of other views yourself. They listen because they want viewers, don’t just tweet. And they have sponsors that want your eyeballs
1328136045293150209 2020-11-16 08:41:23 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @NJoseph4 @jricole Yep, lose the dependence by overcoming your addiction . Like using a vape to quit smoking, use electric vehicles to overcome oil wars and wanton destruction of everybody else’s places to keep oil companies rich and powerful🤔🤷‍♂️ easy peasy
1328134240035344384 2020-11-16 08:34:13 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I like it, but in this context it’s “RINO” - no H in the word Republican see, so yeah.. carry on, it’s a good idea👍🏼
1328133512357175297 2020-11-16 08:31:19 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I told you my friend had it and didn’t do well and the same goes for over 250 000 fkn people who DIED from it. They died man. Just in America. Stop being stupid. Glad your people are well. Over 10 mil got it and recovered but no 250k died 1 yr from the flu in America EVER!🙈🙈

1328130360710995977 2020-11-16 08:18:48 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Soooo, asking for a friend🤔 if we negotiated a #BidenBernieSwap could that heal the country?This is for #Trump &amp; #Biden supporters. Would you be willing to accept a President Sanders &amp; move on.  @realDonaldTrump , if you like this option, DM me. I know you like Bernie. Serious✌️
1328127942837342215 2020-11-16 08:09:11 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump just has to get over it and stop being a whiny baby and concede to President-Elect Sanders and give him what he needs to get doing the job of governing for the American people #BidenBernieSwap  🤔🤔 🤣🤣 🤔🤔🤔 😯  😳😳 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 🤷‍♂️🤔🤔🤷‍♂️🤔🤔 😳😳🤔🤔🤔🤔🤭😃🤩
1328124637616746498 2020-11-16 07:56:03 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I believe Trump is right that It IS massively rigged. Bernie won, he should be getting the daily briefings to prepare for the transition and it’s unbelievably damaging that Trump won’t give President-elect Sanders’ team the smooth transition we should have. #StopTheSteal
1328121175013269506 2020-11-16 07:42:18 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Wait a minute!.... are you trying to tell me we made this system all up &amp; it DOESN’T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?😳😳😳 we could make something else up that works better for more people &amp; there is no reason not to? 😳😳😳 whoa😮😮😮when can we start?...

Thanks Lee! I didn’t have to think AT ALL! ❤️❤️ #comfort
1328115090965590018 2020-11-16 07:18:07 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @FareedZakaria Yes, a totally reasonable idea that independent bodies act as oversight. It’s not like it’s not on a schedule and it can’t be planned to have an adequate or even overwhelming number of people who come out and get it done efficiently and accurately 🤷‍♂️🙈
1328113021684682754 2020-11-16 07:09:54 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Juliette_Vand @MaxCRoser They didn’t do well. Compared to their neighbours they had a much higher death count. It wasn’t a great plan and apparently round two will be at least equally deadly.
1328111917706194945 2020-11-16 07:05:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Still don’t think humans can affect the environment ? This was a day.

1328110990874079233 2020-11-16 07:01:49 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Great. Inconvenience them and it’s civil disobedience. Annex territories and destroy Palestinian lives and 🤷‍♂️meh. You’d think they’d remember what it was like to have that done to them. Oh wait, they do! But don’t see themselves doing it now🤔 hmmmm quick!look away
1328110107973050368 2020-11-16 06:58:19 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @thehill Really? I just got a tweet from @GOP asking for more grifter money for trump to fight about the election. That doesn’t sound like they admit he lost. It sounds like they’re admitting they’re fully complicit in this disloyal charade to undermine American elections 🤔
1328104987210244096 2020-11-16 06:37:58 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Do not donate to this grift.This has nothing to do with election integrity &amp; they know it.Many have already congratulated Biden. You know why?He won. No cheating,he just won.I don’t know why but I expected more from you as a party. You know there’s no fraud. Unpatriotic dbags🤮
1328104026144206848 2020-11-16 06:34:09 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @GOP I like the pic, reminds me of Hitchcock .You know this really cements how complicit you are in this disloyal attempt to overthrow a fair election that you lost. You can’t just blame it on his disrespect for America. You are proving you really don’t care about integrity. You lost
1328102837570707457 2020-11-16 06:29:26 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @aliyazt I like it!! I think my favourite though is still #VanillaISIS 🤣🤣 the trucks, the banners, so true , just look at the MillionMAGA .. I mean the #MultipleMORONMarch   Y’allqueda is my second, I had a good laugh when I heard that

1328088920840605697 2020-11-16 05:34:08 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @CREWcrew Unless we put actual legislation in place making sure that can’t happen again, it will. now that the really unscrupulous know it can, they will exploit it and they will not be as inefficient or inept as the Donald.

1327994556521078784 2020-11-15 23:19:09 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @NiceBigBuns @johncusack That was his point,they hijacked the strategy.But anybody can,nobody owns i,we don’t have to even “take it back” we just have to implement it.especially in a grassroots nature. It’s not Dems vs republicans,it’s powerless vs power.We need to spread the power out to achieve equity.
1327993497933242368 2020-11-15 23:14:57 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I love @openculture ,it’s a rich resource to thinkers when people still thought. Watching the video of Saul’s interview where they didn’t “two-sides” it, it was presented to allow thought. To me it showed how relevant his opinions &amp; strategies still are.Worth the read &amp; the watch
1327980843797798914 2020-11-15 22:24:40 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Trump doesn’t care, the higher the chaos &amp; death toll left for Biden the more he’ll troll about it. He barely mentions it anymore because Americans dead from his negligence was inconvenient for re-election. “We’re rounding the corner” &amp; will do nothing federally which was his job
1327979813030809600 2020-11-15 22:20:34 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Mmmm I remember using gear like that, so interesting that in that time period all this electronic music was being mixed on analogue gear. Thanks for that, I will be revisiting these scores 👍🏼👍🏼
1327963437465559041 2020-11-15 21:15:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @mviser @daveweigel #MedicareForAll
1327948957104926721 2020-11-15 20:17:58 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> That should’ve been done during the Obama administration. This is why people have a problem with @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer  because this was vital and they dropped the ball.
1327946170912665602 2020-11-15 20:06:53 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> This would be a really good thing to push for right off the bat
1327944299825278976 2020-11-15 19:59:27 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Yes. Crazy times to come🙈🙈
1327942917063892994 2020-11-15 19:53:58 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Wow really? You didn’t know who these people were and what the shithead president was supporting? Nobody believes that and this is a direct result of @FoxNews and OANN and republicans in general demonizing non supporters as the enemy and evil and not correcting them.
1327940859762003969 2020-11-15 19:45:47 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Start in Georgia and #StopMitch @ossoff @ReverendWarnock for Georgians. Don’t let the radical right fool you.

1327935985120907266 2020-11-15 19:26:25 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> And on full crazy display to the world who’s wondering for the last 4 years WTF America?
1327786330101862401 2020-11-15 09:31:44 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @SusanQ294 @TallyAnnaE They will be trying this and I would not count on any republicans to stand in the way if they think it might work. @SenatorCollins might have concerns but she still thinks trump learned his lesson with impeachment and gave him more chances sooooo🙈🙈🙈🙈
1327785178559864834 2020-11-15 09:27:10 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @allinwithchris Can we start maybe with candidates being mandated to show taxes and next how do we get to something substantive on independent redistricting that is actually representative .there’s so much 🙈 voting laws next? Money out of politics for sure. How do we do this in 4 years?
1327784176066637826 2020-11-15 09:23:11 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @allinwithchris Yep🙈we need some really good legislation on so many things that were held in place by the shame and disgrace that would come if you violated the norms. Sadly that time has passed.
1327783201440411649 2020-11-15 09:19:18 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Yes! Who’s on that list? Whoa.. that’s a long list🙈🙈 ok! I’m still in! Let’s go
1327782348566523904 2020-11-15 09:15:55 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> This is why people say defund the police🙈 that and all the killy murdery stuff they do to people without due process. And the mountains of corruption necessary to sustain the aforementioned killy murdery stuff. Plus this👇👇
1327779294916055042 2020-11-15 09:03:47 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Attention!! This is not being radical left. There’s plenty of republicans suffering and dying and you should agree this is a problem. 👇👇👇
1327778473801363457 2020-11-15 09:00:31 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Probably the only thing we agree on🤔 ahhhh common ground🤣🤣🤣

1327777106563096578 2020-11-15 08:55:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Kinda says it all. I will not be “reaching out” to the confederate nazis. They can all go fck themselves and have a big cryfest about it amongst themselves so tightly wedged up Trumps ass. Disgusting. Filthy. Nasty. Unpatriotic. UnAmerican.
1327775671096139778 2020-11-15 08:49:23 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @AsIfUknow 🙈🤮
1327774991891501063 2020-11-15 08:46:41 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Remember people, there were people doing the job better than ICE before ICE. Abolish ice doesn’t mean nothing is there, just the cruel inefficient cruel barbaric and cruel agency is gone and more oversight comes back. Don’t let the radical right fool you. #AbolishICE
1327774100207570945 2020-11-15 08:43:08 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @WalkerBragman Absolutely, if Americans saw the bodies piling up everyday from their action/inaction things would change. We should desanitize all wars.

1327771896390279170 2020-11-15 08:34:23 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> For all those who say “Dems  have moved too far left” look how radically right the republicans have gone from those good old days they claim to love. Don’t let the radical right fool you.
1327770921306873857 2020-11-15 08:30:31 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @sfmnemonic That’s a long long way from this year’s “whatever Trump wants” 🙈🙈

1327758361887182848 2020-11-15 07:40:36 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> We should forget about trump and idiots who blindly follow him and March and lie and whine for him and get Georgians out to vote for @ossoff and @ReverendWarnock so government can work again . People need stimulus, people need healthcare , the radical right is holding it up

It’s SUPPOSED to work that way. Obama didn’t block any of this from Trump. It’s beyond partisanship, it’s about functioning for the people🙈🙈

1325547856632172545 2020-11-09 05:16:51 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Make sure the dinosaurs in the Democratic Party that are saying progressive ideas cost them votes know that’s not what happened and it is the key to the future . A lot are saying different and we can’t let that thinking gain a foothold and just return to “normal”
1325546808093847557 2020-11-09 05:12:41 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @JabariBrisport @peterdaou We have to make it loud and clear that was not the case and the dinosaurs that want to cling to that will soon be escorted out just like trump. We are NOT going back to “normal” and we must clue the media who spout this crap must be corrected as well.

We gave Joe and Dems an advance, we are going to need receipts and see a big return this time. Start listening to progressives , REAL progressives and incrementalism begone!!
1325239319947325442 2020-11-08 08:50:50 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> I’m in. Sounds like a real reconciliation and healing plan to me. That would be Making America Great for real. Imagine how much stronger a country it could be unshackled by its shitty past. Living up to its aspirations.

1325229130116423683 2020-11-08 08:10:20 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @johniadarola No, instead we get the media trying to play up Kasich telling us Biden almost lost because of radical left.

Just look at SCOTUS. I am tired of money turning Democrats into jellyfish who wag a finger and issue stern warnings while complying with bad ideas. Fight or move
1325213009111740418 2020-11-08 07:06:17 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @digby56 They burnt down every bit of goodwill I may have had for them right to the ground.&amp; I never noticed any of them exhibiting any to others.&amp; if Joe thinks everyone is going to forget &amp; go for ANY “reach across the aisle” BS.He’ll hear us.

They supported the worst president ever.They actively were only interested in owning the people that didn’t agree with them and supporting every behaviour they said they stood against. I think we can work for everyone’s  betterment without their input.

You’re not interested in fairness, I’ve seen your statements. If you want to stop fraud, then fix redistricting, get money out of politics, enhance voter rights.. but you won’t, will you?
1323580152492789760 2020-11-03 18:57:53 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @chrislhayes Good. I like the Biden voters not feeling secure and getting out there. And if the GOP gets complacent I’m good with that too, I hope they stay home.

1314172674927718400 2020-10-08 19:55:56 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> This is a lie. Both the article and the statement have vagaries about protecting vulnerable and getting everyone else back to normal without explaining ANYTHING about specifics of what that actually entails. “Reasonable measures” is not a plan John. Where’s the PLAN?

If you want to re-open &amp; learn to live with the virus you’ve got to accept that for now, we all should wear masks, we all should distance but when idiots don’t, we CAN’T get back to normal🙈
1314170362070999040 2020-10-08 19:46:45 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @JohnCornyn @WSJ Oh wait, I just read the wsj article before but I went on to read the great statement it was trying to tout and it doesn’t mention masks at all and refers to a few things to do but is very vague beyond general” vulnerable people should be protected” assertions. That’s NOT a plan
1314168712631595011 2020-10-08 19:40:11 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @JohnCornyn @WSJ Funny it doesn’t say what to actually DO as reasonable re-opening plans.I bet it means people should wear masks as a key infection rate reducer which tRump constantly mocks &amp; doesn’t tell his voters to do. He could just say “everybody wear masks” &amp;save lives but no. Why not John?
1314151664895627268 2020-10-08 18:32:27 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @cenkuygur @SenKamalaHarris So who is the progressive pick to 2024?
1314151338910142465 2020-10-08 18:31:09 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @funder #KamalaWonTheDebate , too bad she had to do it with a moderator that kept giving breaks to VP flybait
1314150549529473025 2020-10-08 18:28:01 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @BarbaraBollier Fingers crossed. I can’t vote there but get those votes out Kansas!
1314150261359861760 2020-10-08 18:26:52 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @BernieSanders Miss you man😞
1314149732747489280 2020-10-08 18:24:46 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Nope. I’m good. His ugly mug can stay buried in the bunker. It’s just better that way
1314149385064853504 2020-10-08 18:23:23 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump I wish, fracking sucks and destabilizes stable ground and poisons the ground and water supplies and we are not even allowed to know the cocktail of poisons injected. If you actually cared about people you’d be against it to but we know you don’t.
1314148385113419776 2020-10-08 18:19:25 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump Great, I had to go take a crap anyway. “Message from the president” always good for getting my bowels moving.
1314147593937661953 2020-10-08 18:16:16 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @thehill Well, maybe as succession goes but I would prefer a progressive. We really should’ve had #MedicareForAll by now and Nancy has a great ability to waste leverage by wagging a finger instead of blocking opposition action. Sorry🤷‍♂️
1314146360506159104 2020-10-08 18:11:22 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @AOC Pro-life should include giving a crap about the homeless, the helpless, the powerless,the suffering,and the struggling. if you aren’t doing that, you are NOT pro-life.
1314145090080825344 2020-10-08 18:06:19 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump Stand back and stand by grampa. Stop shouting at the Twitter, not everything on the internet is real, take your medicine and you’ll get your pudding. There, there.
1314143742039928832 2020-10-08 18:00:58 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @Jim_Jordan San Francisco is America.  Jim Jordan is a partisan hack turdblossom
1313659196794171392 2020-10-07 09:55:33 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> They put in a speed bump
1313658969320296449 2020-10-07 09:54:39 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @JohnCornyn Says guy on team going all the way with destruction of the country🙈 hypocrite
1313656919148703744 2020-10-07 09:46:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Can I vote for this guy?
1313655633661571077 2020-10-07 09:41:24 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump SPACE FORCE!
1313652361685094401 2020-10-07 09:28:24 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @KeithOlbermann Yes! The whole frkin country should be prosecuting this administration and life endangering governors for their purposeful misconduct and gross negligence with respect to pandemic response. It’s disgusting.
1313649715003744256 2020-10-07 09:17:53 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @TeaPartyCat Under par

1313545045195227138 2020-10-07 02:21:57 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @PatinkinMandy That’s AWESOME!!!!! ooops...sorry for screaming🤭 shared. Keep fighting everyone, it’s ridiculously important
1313542629469106177 2020-10-07 02:12:21 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Like Obama did after you and Bush pissed away the entire economy and jobs? Starting the longest stretch of job growth in American history? Only to let it burn away in the tiny hands of president Foghorn Leghorn? Together you say? No thanks, you can leave. Please.. just leave.
1313541395588808704 2020-10-07 02:07:27 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @RepDLesko @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump What about the precedent you set with Garland? Oh yes, you can’t be trusted and have no integrity or shame, sorry, what was I thinking?
1313540285251674112 2020-10-07 02:03:03 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @TallyAnnaE @Acosta Nice😜
1313534950172438529 2020-10-07 01:41:51 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @ryanstruyk @CNN Men can be so stupid
1313534742852235266 2020-10-07 01:41:01 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> They should try helping Americans first. Any country watching the US covid clusterfck is saying thanks but no thanks.
1313533801402957826 2020-10-07 01:37:17 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Do it, do it, do it!! Good luck!!!!
1313533604748832770 2020-10-07 01:36:30 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @SenWhitehouse You start with a premise that they don’t care about: adhering to CDC guidelines .
1313530656757108738 2020-10-07 01:24:47 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @karagoucher Just wait. I have every confidence that @realDonaldTrump has no bottom to his barrel and can and will get worse. I hope your grandfather recovers. Stay strong. 🙏🏻
1313529667958329348 2020-10-07 01:20:51 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @DevinNunes @NEWS_MAKER If you want to say no to socialism you can vote either way. You go ahead and keep playing “red-scare”   PS - you suck Nunes, your cow is waaaaayyyy smarter
1313528614365913088 2020-10-07 01:16:40 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @TallyAnnaE Covita.. 🤣🤣

1313525765066182658 2020-10-07 01:05:21 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> So, @realDonaldTrump wanted @JoeBiden to be tested for performance enhancing drugs before the last debates and now he’s on steroids🤔 more projection from the cheater-in-chief  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
1308352278349467654 2020-09-22 18:27:45 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @kylegriffin1 Answer: DON’T TRUST THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!! Fight to get them out and stop falling for Lucy holding the football Charlie🙈🙈🙈
1308350291612504064 2020-09-22 18:19:52 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @ThePlumLineGS Now if it will only encourage Dem leadership to add more spine to their fight🙄🤞
1308349801956880384 2020-09-22 18:17:55 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> It affects virtually nobody - @realDonaldTrump
1308348836839141376 2020-09-22 18:14:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @SenKamalaHarris @TallyAnnaE I hope you have more weapons than a demand🙈
1308348654160412674 2020-09-22 18:13:21 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @RepMaxineWaters @TallyAnnaE You need to correct that Maxine, no SCOTUS appointments until after INAUGURATION. Don’t leave any room for interpretation , the lame duckers will just say election is over, here’s Terrible McHorrible, your new Supreme Court justice
1308347498667347968 2020-09-22 18:08:46 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @GOP Senate republicans agree, looks like they’re  going to lose this election so we must act with further deceit and take away choice of the people again. Also thanks for helping @SpeakerPelosi by wagging your finger but not doing anything substantive
1308346684964036614 2020-09-22 18:05:32 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @GOP hypocrisy ringing out loud as they quote democrats from 2016 and not themselves lying to the American people that the seat belongs to the next administration and the people to decide. Senate leader has agreed, we don’t care about the will of the people, just power
1308345313342763009 2020-09-22 18:00:05 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Really dangerous move
1308345073642463232 2020-09-22 17:59:08 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> And killed 10’s of 1000’s with the pandemic response when I knew it was serious in February - @realDonaldTrump
1308342569013829632 2020-09-22 17:49:10 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> And nothing new.
1308341795231797250 2020-09-22 17:46:06 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Soaring new heights of hypocrisy and inequality and prosperity for my rich friends and rich people I’m trying to bribe to be my friends #BidenHarris2020Landslide
1308340284556750849 2020-09-22 17:40:06 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> They do not care about honesty and have no integrity. Why would you want them to stay?
1308338909651308544 2020-09-22 17:34:38 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @appleofhiseye6 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Wow, that sounds like you’ve had a bad head injury, better take care. The adulterer in chief is not doing much to follow either the word of god or the constitution but you probably only listen to him anyway so you think all his lies are true🤷‍♂️ pray for the return of your mind.
1308337908475199489 2020-09-22 17:30:39 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump I think they just did that because they think you’re a pig.
1302984168347971586 2020-09-07 22:56:48 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @GOP @realDonaldTrump By causing the riots by not calling out bad cops and empowering them to be even worse
1302983416833617922 2020-09-07 22:53:49 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Everything’s great! But vote for Joe and there’ll be massive stabbings! - says @realDonaldTrump  while stabbing people all over
1302983026956275712 2020-09-07 22:52:16 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> Crazy @realDonaldTrump shows us videos of violence in the street that IS happening and continues to happen under his administration and uses them to tell us that’s what’ll happen under @JoeBiden and to be scared🙈🙈 so dumb, what a #LoserTrump is
1302981527492583425 2020-09-07 22:46:19 +0800 <PolitiCrazies> @realDonaldTrump Are those high marks from Trump University? That you had to pay millions in court because it was a sham? Cuz everybody else knows you’re a failure with your response
