1303509503644557313 2020-09-09 09:44:18 +0800 <anne_tappe> @DevinCow Hannity. They didn't cover up his name when Rachel read the blurb. Tee hee hee
1303472427217772544 2020-09-09 07:16:58 +0800 <anne_tappe> @BET Ain't that the truth. I was like the teenager with my Mom and like the Mom with my teenagers.

1302742858558922752 2020-09-07 06:57:55 +0800 <anne_tappe> @Ruth_HHopkins @thesaltedtable I write phone numbers down and the can't remember who they belong to. I also take notes on them.
1302742510238744577 2020-09-07 06:56:32 +0800 <anne_tappe> @thesaltedtable I still do.
1302725055080661002 2020-09-07 05:47:11 +0800 <anne_tappe> @Dknight10k A man who rapes children, that's who.
1302724646836473857 2020-09-07 05:45:33 +0800 <anne_tappe> @waltshaub Kelly sits on the board of the privately run torture centers.
1302708899234025472 2020-09-07 04:42:59 +0800 <anne_tappe> @waltshaub I agree. Some things just can't be rehabilitated.
1302707527272939520 2020-09-07 04:37:32 +0800 <anne_tappe> @realDonaldTrump You are about as useful as a bump on log. Resign.
1302701394034454528 2020-09-07 04:13:10 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RealKHiveQueenB @TheRealHoarse That made me ill.

1302410926071537665 2020-09-06 08:58:57 +0800 <anne_tappe> @dreammapper I think this was the beginning of Trump thinking McCain was a loser.

1302367804004298757 2020-09-06 06:07:35 +0800 <anne_tappe> @KatiePhang @JETBallin So this is a confirmation of the Atlantic story.
1302351797168734208 2020-09-06 05:03:59 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Tee hee hee
1302336279577649152 2020-09-06 04:02:19 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Ummmm even Bruce knows this one.
1302035575952691200 2020-09-05 08:07:26 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RadioFreeTom @52fairway That was really frustrating. I think the reason Trump hated McCain so much is because he stood up for Obama during 2008 campaign by calling him a good and decent man who was born in this country and not a Muslim.
1302030845134254080 2020-09-05 07:48:38 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Is she in trouble?

1302021479303794688 2020-09-05 07:11:25 +0800 <anne_tappe> @FLOTUS @TheAtlantic So you are confirming this story along with many others are true.
1301998445448892422 2020-09-05 05:39:54 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Poor little guy.  Getting an education can wear a little guy out.

1301986196499738626 2020-09-05 04:51:13 +0800 <anne_tappe> @marklevinshow FOX has confirmed this BS is true.
1301985244631846912 2020-09-05 04:47:26 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Indeed she has.  Our cat Sammy Girl has done the same with our cats. They dont mess with her.
1301971845919379456 2020-09-05 03:54:12 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Is she taking a break from slapping Bruce around?

1301660285724360704 2020-09-04 07:16:10 +0800 <anne_tappe> @SteveGuest The participants were carry statements from the organization they represented. This women felt like her statement needed to go further. Bodem had no idea of questions or comments.

1301319447353765888 2020-09-03 08:41:48 +0800 <anne_tappe> @JordanTBurch @ReverendWarnock Not really. Equally has happened yet.
1301319145661673472 2020-09-03 08:40:36 +0800 <anne_tappe> @chrislongview Devastating. It makes me physically ill.
1301283466911211520 2020-09-03 06:18:49 +0800 <anne_tappe> @ReverendWarnock This is so heartbreaking.  I was ten when MLK was assassinated. Every year for 52 years I pray for things to get better, this year I have a little more hope because more people are saying enough this must end.
1301280625043804160 2020-09-03 06:07:32 +0800 <anne_tappe> @ddale8 All these people coming into DC from Portland, Kenosha and Seattle were there for the march led by Al Sharpton on Friday August 28th. That is also why there were so many protesters yelling at Rand Paul and others Thursday night.
1301278931807477760 2020-09-03 06:00:48 +0800 <anne_tappe> @mdnij34 Fighting another Civil War and this time the KKK will win. That is what it means.
1301085701891481601 2020-09-02 17:12:58 +0800 <anne_tappe> @mmpadellan Pochahotas was a Native girl that was kidnapped and raped. Making a play on her name is as bad as Trump using it to slam Warren. It's not funny or witty, it is hurtful. MMIWG.
1301037012015702016 2020-09-02 13:59:30 +0800 <anne_tappe> @rachel_maria65 @politico No. He had to give up seat.

1300924557151199232 2020-09-02 06:32:39 +0800 <anne_tappe> @RhinoReally Did I just hear Bruce say nana nana boo boo to Rhino?
1300902721273229314 2020-09-02 05:05:53 +0800 <anne_tappe> @waltshaub Probably the feds headed to Portland or Kenosha.
