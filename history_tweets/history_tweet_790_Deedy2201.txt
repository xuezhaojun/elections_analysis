1343552553150251017 2020-12-28 21:41:05 +0800 <Deedy2201> @acgrayling How will you reverse it? You failed to stop Brexit despite having a remainer Parliament, a remainer MSM and constant bombardment of EU propaganda, so let us in on your secret of success because you haven’t managed to win anything to date. Delusional old fool.

Remaining &amp; paying billions per annum to trade with a bloc that runs a £90 billion trade surplus with us? Or is it better that we’re micromanaged and fleeced by a foreign power? If that’s what you call better, it isn’t me that’s the moron.

I boycott anything that isn’t historically factual and from what I’ve seen on here and elsewhere, many are doing the same so at some point the powers that be will have to take notice and stop pushing this on the majority. It just causes unnecessary division.
1341822974941380617 2020-12-24 03:08:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NKrankie Reaching for the remote as I type. Sick to death of it.

We do and can import from the Rest of the World, in fact, I’ve just been eating some grapes all the way from South Africa. Shocker eh?
1341752131632697345 2020-12-23 22:26:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CarrieOnFilms @FlyingSte Of course they haven’t. It’s just another remoaner attempt to blame Brexit when this was all Macron’s doing.

If you are so worried that we'll all wither and die, why are you still here?

Where I live I have visited four major supermarkets &amp; the shelves were stuffed. Btw - we grow lettuce, broccoli and cauliflowers in Britain - we don't need the EU to provide us with veg.

1341675371729735680 2020-12-23 17:21:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Kevin_Maguire If they are rationing items, it is due to idiots like you tweeting that the shelves are empty and people are now panic buying. Not tricky for Johnson, but certainly for a lying arse like you.

1341288437966655493 2020-12-22 15:44:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @johnredwood Because all deaths now appear to be attributed to Covid, even if someone died in an RTA, they are tested with the unreliable PCR and the death is recorded as Covid.

They were ready to give us a Canada deal, when May was ousted &amp; suddenly changed their minds, hoping they would get more concessions from Boris and tried to extract the urine. Tesco recently announced that they are ready for no-deal.

They have had four and a half years, shall we just keep negotiating indefinitely while still paying obscene amounts of cash into EU coffers? We've left already - time to finalise as it's clear nothing is going to change by extending talks further.

There is a whole world beyond the EU with which to trade should the EU want to play silly beggars, and they have had ample time to reach an agreement, but they refuse to let go of their control over us.
1340990782463946752 2020-12-21 20:01:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MonkeyLuminous @Tobias_Ellwood With the EU running a £90 billion trade surplus with us, it won't be us walking back, it'll be them running to us when their exports dry up as we happily trade with the rest of the world.
1340989986338988032 2020-12-21 19:58:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CmPooley1972 @SkyNewsBreak Because there was always a possibility of a no-deal when the EU moved the goalposts when Boris took over from May and removed the option of a Canada style deal. Govt has been banging on about preparing for this scenario over the past six months. Tesco was prepared months ago.
1340989132521295875 2020-12-21 19:54:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hanjaco @SkyNewsBreak We won't run out of anything because we can get everything we need from what we already produce or from countries outside the EU, just like we did before we joined the EEC.

1340965959771811840 2020-12-21 18:22:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNewsBreak Britain produces lettuce, salad leaves, broccoli and cauliflowers, and import citrus fruits from Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Sainsbury's should have taken heed of the Govt message to prepare and reworked their supply chain.
1340964161950519296 2020-12-21 18:15:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNewsBreak Oh jog on.

WE, the electorate, who pay your wages, voted to leave and we've been patient to extract ourselves from under the EU jackboot. Don't like it? Sod off to another member state.

Drakeford is an absolute arse - there is even talk of him introducing a Tier 4 now. He needs to be removed asap. His childish brinkmanship is ruining lives. They could oust Nippy at the same time

Initially, the Govt were protective as it was a big deal and I appreciated their intentions, but now I think they need to remove Whitty and Vallance. Davey however, like Starmer are quick to criticise but never offer any ideas or solutions - just snipe.
1339225876798562304 2020-12-16 23:08:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @barbs_ni @guyapreston1 @Lobbo321 @DeborahMeaden Does it? Did either Guy or myself mention “foreigners taking our jobs”? As for soundbites, you’re the one with all the MSM speak and every remoaner says the exact same thing as you. If you don’t like it, and we’re all waycist, why aren’t you already in another member state?

1339141150230282240 2020-12-16 17:31:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BrexitHome Tough. We voted to leave not satisfy other member state’s demands. No deal it is then.

Perhaps Covid has seen off the flu too. I follow @MichaelYeadon3 for a common-sense approach.

1338420336484814849 2020-12-14 17:47:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GhostWriterMr @wavecrestglen @SnipingFrom @guyverhofstadt Brazil is the largest producer of oranges. We do not rely on "Valencian" oranges, plus we grow our own in the UK. What else do the EU produce that we cannot buy elsewhere? Proximity isn't a factor as we buy fresh produce from all over the world - eg pineapples from Costa Rica.
1338402383806812161 2020-12-14 16:36:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Les1004 I must admit, I did have a wobble following the latest extension and then thankfully read a superb thread by @BarristersHorse giving a new perspective, so back on track now.

1338378091320774656 2020-12-14 14:59:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LadyNoo22 It probably is as there has been quite a hoo ha on here about her behaviour. Off to give my block finger some exercise too! 😀
1338367961216782338 2020-12-14 14:19:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LadyNoo22 I’ve noticed one particular woman who seems pretty desperate for male attention - photos in the bath, another in her underwear then screenshots her DM’s &amp; berates the senders! I’m all for girl power but may have to block her - nearly lost my coffee after the underwear photo.

Erasmus, the student programme remains, and jobs for the British will increase thanks to the end of FoM. You can whinge on, but then I will mute

How do other countries in the world manage without the EU to micromanage them? If you cannot accept a democratic vote, there are 26 member states left (for now) to choose from. My freedoms have not been curtailed.

1338153429898817540 2020-12-14 00:06:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KarinLane12 @BorisJohnson Agreed. I’m hoping Boris is just waiting for end of transition - a natural no deal. If there is a deal, I fear it will be Brino, so if a deal is miraculously reached at the 11th hour, it isn’t going to bode well and the Tories will be done.

1338137656388153344 2020-12-13 23:04:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson Very disappointed that you haven’t walked already particularly due to the recents batch of threats. There isn’t a deal to be done- the EU have made it perfectly clear that they want things to remain the same - that they maintain some level of control despite us having left.

It’s now pretty much established that neither will back down and as there is only a couple of weeks left, it’s hardly worth declaring no deal - he’ll just let it happen naturally.

As for selling our fish, there is a bigger world beyond the EU and if the French, Dutch and Spanish don’t want to buy, that’s on them.

1337997672528171010 2020-12-13 13:47:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @guyverhofstadt They are fish in BRITISH waters and if Macron says he will continue to invade our territorial waters, what do you expect? Trouble is, you think you own Britain and her resources. This is simply a reminder that you don’t.
1337989676389576704 2020-12-13 13:16:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LBC @DavidLammy I voted to leave, not for a deal or did Lammy receive a different referendum ballot to the rest of us with the words “must leave with deal” printed on it? This man shouldn’t be anywhere near our Parliament.

1337722439468519424 2020-12-12 19:34:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DeborahMeaden Because Boris didn’t win an election on a “deal”. He won the election with the promise of getting Brexit done, which is exactly what he is doing. He’s also putting this country first for a change.

No matter how you try and spin it, Burley's actions were far worse than Cummings, particularly as she was due to cover, live, the first elderly lady getting a Covid jab, so not just hypocritical but irresponsible too.
1337272440750297088 2020-12-11 13:46:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @prwhittle It’ll be reduced to a twig with lights next year if Khan is still in charge. He’ll rub out anything associated with Christmas.

Oh and I worked for an MEP in Brussels for four years, so know exactly what I’m talking about.

1337140871628722177 2020-12-11 05:03:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @swanslad33 @KayBurley What she put Cummings and his family through was far more vicious. They were camping outside his house and doorstepping his parents FGS.

And I’m not hiding, I’m here typing - I just happen to love daffodils and unlike many on here, not looking for male attention. Cummings seeking childcare versus Burley throwing a party - yep, it’s all the Govt’s fault. 🙄

1337137236165398532 2020-12-11 04:48:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @swanslad33 @KayBurley I agree, there are lots of people not in the limelight breaking rules, but Burley was so nasty to Cummings, it’s just a little bit difficult to accept given what she and her cohorts put him and is family through, for her to then behave like this.
1337135100757221376 2020-12-11 04:40:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SiobhanBenita @BorisJohnson Yep. Wonderful!

1337131413477404673 2020-12-11 04:25:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ClosdesChenes @KayBurley Is that it? Can’t disagree so name call instead. Very adult.
1337130712462462977 2020-12-11 04:22:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @simon_gg @stottycabanas @KayBurley Don’t tell me -  Cadwalladr saw him chatting with Aaron Banks in a pub not far from Barnard Castle or has another lying “eye witness” come forward? I wouldn’t hold your breath- it is in the Independent after all and everyone knows how “credible” that particular left wing rag is.
1337129341004738562 2020-12-11 04:17:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Gov1Ad @KayBurley Is it? A bloke travelling 200 miles from a Tier 3 to join the party and then Burley herself supposed to be present, live with the first elderly lady having the COVID jab? I’d call that bloody irresponsible and dangerous, but you think it’s unfair. Ok then. 🙄
1337128027961094147 2020-12-11 04:12:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CarrotRebecca @stottycabanas @KayBurley Cummings wasn’t partying but instead seeking childcare and didn’t interact with anyone, but of course, Cummings was worse. 🙄
1337124843565801477 2020-12-11 03:59:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @andersonr_claya @KayBurley Nothing wrong with a bit of gammon - I like mine with a nice maple sauce myself. Oh, was that meant to offend me or was that the name calling sweary bit in the middle? Failed on both counts love  - try harder.

1337121324343373824 2020-12-11 03:45:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @saintsshirts @KayBurley Making a typo is a mistake - people travelling 200 miles from a Tier 3 to attend a party is a tad more than a mistake. It was a blatant rule break. Horrible little specimen eh? 😂 Original, I’ll give you that.
1337120564360712196 2020-12-11 03:42:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @morley_19 @KayBurley One guest travelled 200 miles from a Tier 3 to attend, so not her “social bubble” and no, I haven’t broken the rules.
1337120142673780737 2020-12-11 03:40:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @brownsauce9 @KayBurley And Burley isn’t?
1337119993331380236 2020-12-11 03:40:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @timweatherhead1 @KayBurley Who was that?
1337119504917258240 2020-12-11 03:38:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichMcKendrick @KayBurley Puerile drivel? The woman has been suspended for her actions. Nothing remotely puerile about it - just desserts for someone who thought she was above the law.
1337118559470759936 2020-12-11 03:34:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @chemalino @KayBurley Flag slag...please.

1337114682864361483 2020-12-11 03:19:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @crescuk @KayBurley Truth stinging a bit?

1337114099356995589 2020-12-11 03:16:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Cy25Skipper @stottycabanas @KayBurley Then they would have fined him. Burley did break the law because her bosses have suspended her.
1337113481162727425 2020-12-11 03:14:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ampthetex @KayBurley Cummings had a full scale Police investigation and didn’t break the rules. Burley blatantly broke the law as her bosses at Sky have confirmed following their own investigation, hence her suspension.
1337107900842598407 2020-12-11 02:52:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Fred_in_Spain @TheWoodPeckerEU @KayBurley I’m not a “guy”. How dare you make assumptions about my gender.
1337105254844932097 2020-12-11 02:41:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @stottycabanas @KayBurley The Police cleared Cummings of wrongdoing. Burnley’s blatant law breaking is on another level.
1337102277455339521 2020-12-11 02:29:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MarkMobile68 @KayBurley Show you? I didn’t write it down as I wasn’t aware that one day I’d be asked for evidence of my condemnation. Once the police cleared him, I was happy. Good enough for you your Lordship? Tough if it isn’t- I’m not answerable to you.

1337098373321646081 2020-12-11 02:14:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @fdawg2k3 @KayBurley Why thanks for the recognition - much appreciated.

1337093466699034627 2020-12-11 01:54:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Davis09Kelly @KayBurley Aww, are you triggered love? There, there.
1337093308645052417 2020-12-11 01:54:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SuperDoperr @KayBurley Is that your attempt at a funny? Happily married thanks.
1337093065811615745 2020-12-11 01:53:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MarkMobile68 @KayBurley Yes, initially.
1337092924950142976 2020-12-11 01:52:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichMcKendrick @KayBurley Tell it to someone who cares.
1337092834697031681 2020-12-11 01:52:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Cathal29531632 @KayBurley Accidentally breaking the rules? You’re having a laugh. One guest travelled over 200 miles from a Tier 3 to attend. Nothing “accidental” about that.
1337092125633163266 2020-12-11 01:49:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Botsworth @Den1Fen @WilliamDaly68 @KayBurley So having a Party, guests travelling over 200 miles from a Tier 3 to attend and then Burley supposed to be covering, in person, the first elderly lady having the first Covid jab, is nothing by comparison, right?
1337090927710625804 2020-12-11 01:44:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichMcKendrick @KayBurley I agree.  The people attempting to conflate what Burley did with what Cummings did is quite ridiculous, but then leftie haters are always ridiculous.
1337089545096093698 2020-12-11 01:39:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ljnicholls74 @Den1Fen @KayBurley He had already been grilled, prior to the incident with his child and wife, on why he was attending SAGE meetings and explained that he was there in his capacity as advisor to the PM.  In other words, it was part of his job.
1337084748112523264 2020-12-11 01:20:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @WestmonsterUK Shove off. Just who the hell do these people think they are?

1337080743126855682 2020-12-11 01:04:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanJinkers @Alichat66 @Den1Fen @KayBurley Thanks for your permission - wearing it now as I type. Hope it triggers you a tad more.
1337079490489561091 2020-12-11 00:59:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Den1Fen @WilliamDaly68 @KayBurley He and his wife were showing symptoms of Covid so took the child to be looked after by grandparents. In my book that’s exactly what looking after his family is.
1337077788554227723 2020-12-11 00:52:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Den1Fen @KayBurley Except he didn’t make the rules. As an advisor to the PM he attended SAGE meetings to report back and was not instrumental in drawing up rules. He also travelled for childcare and interacted with no-one, so not comparable at all.
1337074828629733381 2020-12-11 00:40:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KayBurley You knew exactly what you were doing and thought you were  far too important to abide by the rules like everyone else. Apology not accepted, particularly after the way you relentlessly attacked Dominic Cummings. Karma got you in the end and you deserve everything you get.
1337073488331481088 2020-12-11 00:35:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LoyalDefender2K Love ELO - fave tune Sweet Talkin Woman.,Sadly never got to see them live but they provided the soundtrack to my youth. Halcyon days.

1337069841535164418 2020-12-11 00:21:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Steinfireflint @Wolfonabridge @DeborahMeaden Why would we pay more for it if we can source it cheaper elsewhere? We have already set up our own FTA’s with the rest of the world and if the EU decides it wants to put higher tariffs on produce, we’ll simply reciprocate.
1337068570161897484 2020-12-11 00:16:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @etxberria55 @Steinfireflint @Golding314159 @DeborahMeaden And we can import from outside the EU, so what is your point?

Happy to be a gammonette- wouldn’t have it any other way!

Oh and you mentioned car exports and when anyone mentions Germany’s car market it’s all about BMW.

1336946932829347847 2020-12-10 16:12:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Steinfireflint @DeborahMeaden 😂 BMW car sales to the UK are down 25% already as a result of the EU’s stance, so I wouldn’t be relying on them to carry you through. There are 500 million to trade with in the EU - 7.5 billion worldwide. I’m with the latter.

We are not reliant on EU produce but if the EU doesn’t want to continue to trade, we’re too big a market to ignore if the bloc wants to survive.

1336939300462669826 2020-12-10 15:42:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DeborahMeaden As we run a £90 billion trade deficit with them, I think negotiating from WTO will focus the EU’s collective minds. It’s blatantly obvious to anyone with eyes and ears that all the EU is interested in is our money and control.

1335675421166346243 2020-12-07 04:00:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Craig_bellshaw @vonderleyen @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost Why on earth would we drop food standards because we’ve left the EU? We had very high standards before the EU existed or is this leading up to the chlorinated chicken nonsense?
1335674792578592769 2020-12-07 03:57:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Craig_bellshaw @vonderleyen @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost You’re a Scottish Nationalist - should have guessed. The EU has laughed in Nippy’s face about Scotland joining the EU as have Westminster on a second Indy ref. Suggest you book yourself a one way ticket to another member state if the UK is “finished” 😂😂
1335655619030904834 2020-12-07 02:41:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LozzaFox @benshapiro Morgan doesn’t debate. He thinks he’s right on every subject known to man and if you dare to disagree with the narcissistic fool, he blocks. Needs his little echo chamber to stroke his vast ego.

1335639965930311680 2020-12-07 01:39:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Craig_bellshaw @vonderleyen @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost Oh and I do “get it”. I worked for an MEP over a period of four years and have seen the EU machinations up close and personal which is precisely why I voted to leave.
1335639184565035008 2020-12-07 01:36:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Craig_bellshaw @vonderleyen @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost We are now a sovereign country again and can do whatever the hell we like. The EU haven’t imposed their rules and regs on any other sovereign state for trade,so why do they think they can with GB? They know we’ll thrive and they’ll dive so will try to clip our wings. They’ll fail

Why are they banging on about level playing fields and our fish and remaining under their judicial control? How are we going to suffer food shortages?

Why should the compromise be for the UK to make? They can have an FTA but they want to cherry-pick and maintain control, which isn't what leaving is all about, is it? Food shortages?

We’ve left the club so they are not entitled to a level playing field, our fish or to oversee our laws. We need to walk as they will never let us go without wanting to maintain control. Cut them loose.

1331655534647373828 2020-11-26 01:46:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JustinWelby Aid should be for natural disasters only and not sent to countries who have now clearly become dependent as they never change or improve despite billions being sent their way. Trade, not aid.

1328628929939300353 2020-11-17 17:19:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @briansm20193481 Can I make it a double punch? One for Dick and the other for Khan.
1328628239951130626 2020-11-17 17:17:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NikkiStix55 Sending positive thoughts her way. Keep fighting Nikki.
1328625659812438016 2020-11-17 17:06:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Scrap it all together with the exception of natural disasters.
1328624944830439427 2020-11-17 17:04:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @the_insiderUKG @SkyNews Oooh, one. Impressive.
1328624841071714306 2020-11-17 17:03:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AWjaffa @SkyNews So you have to go back to 2015 to find one of two (Jo Cox murder was media labelled far right) so as there is such an exhaustive list, let's have some more, but how about a bit of whataboutery first - BLM, Antifa, IRA, grooming gangs - all part of the far-left cult.
1328615651259412482 2020-11-17 16:27:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Oh FGS. Anyone with eyes and ears knows we have a far-left problem. Give us some examples of "far right" extremism. I'll wait.
1328394830611845120 2020-11-17 01:49:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JoelBaccas If you hate our flags so much, go live under someone else’s. Your problem solved.
1328386202299478017 2020-11-17 01:15:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AlexIden2 Well no 💩 Sherlock.
1328375876069838849 2020-11-17 00:34:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @robert_spalding Neither - both are awful.
1328336216580886529 2020-11-16 21:56:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @kylecee7 @sainsburys @AbstardJohnny There are black people, disproportionately, in EVERY advert. This is still a white majority country and by all means be inclusive, but not exclusive.
1328288069292859393 2020-11-16 18:45:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @sainsburys @AbstardJohnny Try including some white folk, you know, the majority of your customers. I'll be shopping elsewhere in future.
1328282222676348929 2020-11-16 18:22:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @EglantineDupont @BorisJohnson @MichaelYeadon3 Hubby has been enlightened, though the rest of my family will take some convincing but convince them I will!

1328272907064184832 2020-11-16 17:45:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @EglantineDupont @BorisJohnson To be fair, I've had suspicions for a while but didn't buy into all the conspiracy theories all over Twitter, then started following @MichaelYeadon3 and my eyes were opened. I guess I didn't want to believe the levels of deceit being imposed on us by our Govt. Fully awake now.
1328237579934855168 2020-11-16 15:24:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson What would be the point of having a vaccine? I’m beginning to think this is all bs.
1328195054859587584 2020-11-16 12:35:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RhonddaBryant Anything Blair says will be promptly discarded by the majority in this country. He destroyed Britain with his illegal war and invitations to all and sundry to our shores.
1328193557983801344 2020-11-16 12:29:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NKrankie @w1mav @thismorning Don’t normally watch but definitely won’t now if Alison Hammond is taking over - she’s so annoying.

1327898716330745857 2020-11-15 16:58:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AvonandsomerRob Halal. No thanks.
1327679572326936581 2020-11-15 02:27:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Wow, man leaves house - hold the front page. FGS leave him alone - vultures.
1327678224034390016 2020-11-15 02:22:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LBC So what? Jesus wept, who cares that he left his house? Millions of people do leave their houses every day. Leave the man alone FGS.
1327676950765334528 2020-11-15 02:17:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @charlie62215216 Happy Birthday Charlie! 🎉
1327589723762798592 2020-11-14 20:30:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @toryboypierce @BorisJohnson What a lorry load of tripe.
1327576474283544582 2020-11-14 19:37:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Oh jog on with the “far right” label. People see exactly what is going on in the world despite you trying to skew reality and it has nothing to do with the “far right” or are they the ones looting, shooting, stabbing and raping?
1327562623295090688 2020-11-14 18:42:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hugh_pimple Both ugly buggers too. Do you think there is a connection?
1327556300931272704 2020-11-14 18:17:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Peston Or just taking home some files to work from home?

1327476503425200128 2020-11-14 13:00:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Berumster Already blocked it last week after seeing one of it’s posts and the BLM 💩 on its bio.
1327298548455641093 2020-11-14 01:13:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @TiceRichard Please reach out to @LozzaFox . We need as many likeminded folk to unite.
1327286106560360456 2020-11-14 00:24:02 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CKOTH94 Blimey, another one! He must be going through Twitter with a fine tooth comb - you’re about the tenth I’ve seen today! He blocked me months ago. Poor sap simply cannot bear to see a differing opinion. At least you won’t have his dribbling pop up on your timeline.
1327284482269962240 2020-11-14 00:17:34 +0800 <Deedy2201> @EvanAKilgore Yes.
1327283447707131904 2020-11-14 00:13:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SteveOnSpeed No.

1327268767030767616 2020-11-13 23:15:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ArchRose90 Can you imagine the leftie meltdown? 😂

1327239922026229763 2020-11-13 21:20:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @1984Mathew He’s got another account @garyraikes2 and possibly another @GaryRaikes Blocked them all. Thanks for the heads up.
1327229979936108544 2020-11-13 20:41:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RhodesyLu @Nigel_Farage And you deserve everything you get.
1327224597931061249 2020-11-13 20:19:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BethRigby Everyone already knew this a year ago when he announced it. Do try to keep up Beff.
1327206603200880640 2020-11-13 19:08:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Independent Except Biden hasn't won and is not the President Elect.
1327205939334832131 2020-11-13 19:05:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @1984Mathew He's a wet wipe who can't cope with differing opinion so wraps himself in an echo chamber.
1327204231837851649 2020-11-13 18:58:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @carolecadwalla STILL banging the same tired boring drum even when you've been proved wrong. What a sad, obsessed woman you are.
1327197761985536002 2020-11-13 18:32:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DeniseDoris59 Not now and not in the future. Same with Barnardos. They don't need "white saviours" anymore so let them get on with it.
1327197060861464577 2020-11-13 18:30:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PaulLeMay16 He has an aversion to the Union flag I think. He blocked me months ago, although I did hurl and insult or two in his direction to be fair. Can't say I miss seeing his dribbling on my timeline. Enjoy!
1327195107666370565 2020-11-13 18:22:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Tesco Been waiting over three hours to get on your website. Shame the "every little helps" doesn't extend to the waiting time to change my order.
1327181772128481280 2020-11-13 17:29:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier Please just get out and buy a pair of boots made for walking. Sick of hearing the same old tripe day in day out. They are never going to agree to anything that they cannot control. Surely this is clear now after 4+ years?
1327180704288034817 2020-11-13 17:25:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LBCNews Oh eff off. Sick to death of hearing the word bloody racism in every sentence on every subject.
1327179660271251456 2020-11-13 17:21:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy 😂Cummings told us over a year ago that he would be leaving at the end of the transition, so no rats and no sinking ships. For an MP, you really know nothing about anything, do you?
1327132166615085056 2020-11-13 14:12:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @stevec3457 It’ll be that pesky white privilege again.
1327122042785845251 2020-11-13 13:32:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Tojan182 @MichelBarnier And if you want to continue running your £90 billion trade surplus with us, you can do the same. We told the EU to eff off 4 years ago but they are still desperate to keep raping our waters, controlling our judiciary and helping themselves to our taxes. Have a word with them.
1326974723901845505 2020-11-13 03:46:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson @COP26 The climate changes all the time, naturally and humans do not and cannot control Mother Nature. It’s just another scam to tax us with.
1326919748370771968 2020-11-13 00:08:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MichelBarnier We've left your corrupt organisation and are now an independent, sovereign country. You don't own Britain and we are under no obligation to give you a level playing field, so have a jog on that level playing field because it's the only one you're going to get.
1326918180363767808 2020-11-13 00:02:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @talkRADIO @danwootton @benjaminbutter Well he's no oil painting so who would want to date him anyway - lockdown sceptic or not? What a wet wipe.
1326894926773235719 2020-11-12 22:29:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @tomhfh Are you taking part in the trials? Put yourself forward if you haven’t already.
1326762429510979584 2020-11-12 13:43:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @gwentpolice 14? Jesus wept, get real.

1326556791409405955 2020-11-12 00:05:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ghost_wales We have thousands of homeless that would like a home and they are more deserving. Join the queue or better still sod off back to where you came from and take your "demands" with you.
1326555972375109643 2020-11-12 00:02:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Nigel_Farage He's also bad for America as they will find out, to their cost if he's officially elected.

1326524838312353792 2020-11-11 21:59:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Have a word with BLM - they’ve got millions to spare and of course you wouldn’t want any of us white folk charging in as “saviours” right?
1326472264007737345 2020-11-11 18:30:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GMB Here's hoping you're the first to go. 👍
1326443817491369984 2020-11-11 16:37:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KrishanVik @LozzaFox Who put you in charge of what language we should use? Then again, it wouldn't really matter, you'd be "offended" by whatever language was used. BTW, the use of the word "white" to describe Laurence is highly offensive. See how it works?
1326438548732579841 2020-11-11 16:16:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jaycee1001 @d5_rss They soon will when the white folk take their business elsewhere and they notice a drop in profits.
1326437601620996096 2020-11-11 16:12:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @minky2013 I just scroll on by. Same questions from pre, during and post-referendum that have been answered multiple times which they ignore. Waste of digit power.
1326435044915810304 2020-11-11 16:02:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @talkRADIO He's the embarrassment. How anyone could vote for this senile old duffer is beyond me.
1326429531826171904 2020-11-11 15:40:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @carrieeliz429 She most certainly does not. Trump is the President we wish we had.
1326415477690814464 2020-11-11 14:44:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCPolitics It’s like a rerun of the referendum - wheeling out all the remoaners. Biden is not supportive of Brexit so they all think it’s another opportunity to reverse it.

Taxpayers, plus the green tax hikes &amp; what the hell is the NHS doing for anyone who hasn’t got COVID? Sweet FA. I was a huge fan of Boris, but he’s proved himself to be far too liberal &amp; caves under pressure. He’ll cave to the EU too.

Unnecessary lockdowns, there will be massive green taxes if he continues with the climate change nonsense, he’s not done anything to stop the dinghies and now he’s kow towing to a cheat. What’s the betting he’ll screw us on Brexit. I’m done with him.

The EU still thinks it owns Britain, her natural resources, money and judiciary and therefore thinks it is entitled to call the shots. Cut them loose and walk away.
1325108585479680001 2020-11-08 00:11:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @acgrayling I think the opposite. More will leave the bloc following what's happened in France and the clear dangers of open borders.
1325066770697379842 2020-11-07 21:25:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RogerHelmerMEP That’s the problem. The EU believes Britain and her natural resources, cash and judiciary belongs to them which is why they think they are entitled to call the shots. Time to walk. Sick of this pontificating.

1324415186875408384 2020-11-06 02:16:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @msvalthompson @MattHancock I know 18 people personally (family and friends) who work on the front line and 3 who work within the NHS in support roles and have continued to work throughout the pandemic. As for the tik tok videos - countless. At the height there were several popping up daily. It was a thing.
1324392052902297601 2020-11-06 00:44:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SimonPearson961 Aww. Happy Birthday! 🎉🍾

1324385525407633408 2020-11-06 00:18:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DMMosullivan Oh yes, bring back the party can. Halcyon days.

1324379430400204805 2020-11-05 23:53:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ItsSimonG @mitsyarty @moonhare77 Are you STILL asking the same questions, 4 years on and after we’ve already left? I suggest you get a life.

1324352797962346501 2020-11-05 22:08:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bull_Spotter @DanOMalley2 @HarridgePike @MattHancock It makes you laugh does it? I don’t consider any of this remotely amusing. Are you a qualified immunologist? Look up @MichaelYeadon3 - he is qualified and the tests can be cross contaminated and some have been run under taps, returned and come back positive. Explain that one.
1324351779673460736 2020-11-05 22:04:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock But you are quoting death numbers not knowing if they are normal flu deaths, pure Covid deaths or other deaths just recorded “with” Covid. There is far more evidence from Doctors who know what they are talking about out there, so don’t take my word for it - do some research.
1324350507339685891 2020-11-05 21:59:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @UKurbanite @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock Dr Michael Yeadon @MichaelYeadon3 reckons the pandemic pretty much ended in June.
1324350007915487234 2020-11-05 21:57:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @MattHancock Did I say every ward was a Covid ward? They clearly were not overwhelmed then because every other ward was practically empty.
1324348997969027074 2020-11-05 21:53:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock So you know for a fact that all those deaths were “of” Covid do you? If so, point me in the direction of the proof. There are eminent immunologists and epidemiologists currently challenging Whitty &amp; Vallance on the outdated models they are using to justify the lockdown.
1324347139128991745 2020-11-05 21:45:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock Anyone with underlying problems is vulnerable, but then they are vulnerable to every bug out there and we don’t lock the country down &amp; we haven’t managed to “control” flu, even with a vaccine. Again, it goes back to how deaths are recorded - with or of Covid.
1324338198617690113 2020-11-05 21:10:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock As it goes, yes, I have seen copies of death certificates in which a patient had a heart attack and another who died in an RTA and Covid was recorded on both death Certs. Why would you suppose that is? Just two examples of many.
1324336320777506816 2020-11-05 21:02:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Christo25783584 @Sky40222046 @MattHancock My day of reckoning and my buddy Boris? I’m criticising the Govt for clarity.
1324323415055048705 2020-11-05 20:11:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AngelaRayner @BorisJohnson Why should we, the taxpayers, feed everyone else’s kids over the Christmas holidays? Has Child benefit been stopped? If it hasn’t that’s more than enough to feed their kids. Breed them, feed them.
1324309830044127233 2020-11-05 19:17:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock Of those deaths - did they die “with Covid” or “of” it or do you prefer to ignore all the false positive tests that the Govt refuse to report? At the peak, almost all death certificates contained the word Covid, regardless if that was the cause of death.
1324303762991812610 2020-11-05 18:53:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanOMalley2 @MattHancock They were so exhausted from tending to the thousands of (invisible) COVID patients that they decide to dance about on a video? Seriously?
1324303317686755329 2020-11-05 18:51:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pedropan1710 @kent_keith @MattHancock Why are they even allowing flights into the UK? Puzzled me that they didn’t stop all flights first time around, and the dinghies.
1324302925758418944 2020-11-05 18:49:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock *Do we
1324302778928402432 2020-11-05 18:49:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bull_Spotter @HarridgePike @MattHancock Protect the vulnerable and herd immunity, particularly with a 99.8% survival rate. Does we overwhelm the NHS during flu season? No, we tuck ourselves up in bed and get over it, unless there are complications of course. 1st lockdown I agreed with, this one I don’t.
1324295974102147077 2020-11-05 18:22:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @danwootton Totally fed up - not for me personally - it doesn’t impact my life, but for the youngsters those whose lives  have been ruined by job losses &amp; families not being able to hug their loved ones (especially those in care homes). We have to learn to live with it.
1324292438312308736 2020-11-05 18:08:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @bignlittlec Thoughts are with you Nikki - keep fighting my lovely. 🙏
1324287587289321473 2020-11-05 17:48:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock Was it overwhelmed at the peak? All I saw, the nightingale hospitals were empty and nurses had a good time making tik tok videos.
1324257990640361472 2020-11-05 15:51:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DailyMail Yeah, and most of them fraudulent.
1324256396897099778 2020-11-05 15:45:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock Where is the virus going to go while we’re all locked down? Is it going to give up the ghost and magically disappear? It will still be there when we emerge from this economy, job, relationship and soul destroying crap that you’re forcing on us, just like the last time.
1324245087589703680 2020-11-05 15:00:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Linfield_Fan @PaulEmbery Same here. This constant Trump hating is quite pathetic. Trump may not be the most articulate, but he cannot be bought and is doing what he does for the genuine love of his country and its people. What’s so “appalling” about that?
1324233850705379330 2020-11-05 14:15:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GMB @richardgaisford Oh come on. It’s clearly rigged.
1324049352122339328 2020-11-05 02:02:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock You cannot “control” a virus. Have we “controlled” the flu, even with a vaccine? That would be a no, but you just carry on destroying people’s lives and livelihoods with your ridiculous lockdowns, oh and the NHS is there to protect us, not the other way around.
1324042168990900225 2020-11-05 01:33:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> Just tried to like this Trump tweet and Twitter removed the like and comment functions.  https://t.co/P0MrGf9kEk

1323928703676653569 2020-11-04 18:02:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ausland35501967 @ConstantinStHe1 @kwilliam111 The majority have seen this coming for years and when concerns were voiced, were called racists and ignored by the Govt. When an attack happens on British soil (I suspect in the very near future) platitudes and candles will no longer suffice. Mass deportations only, will.

1323496318619320321 2020-11-03 13:24:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews Aww, poor ickle Femi is now so irrelevant he has to resort to attacking our poppy wearing, for attention. Don’t like our history or the way we remember our war dead? Simple solution - go live elsewhere.
1323482371711242240 2020-11-03 12:29:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @debatenothate2 I’ve had similar thoughts. There is a reason they are locking everything down and that reason isn’t a virus. The only other thing infecting most countries is the good old RoP.

1323243550776152064 2020-11-02 20:40:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @cocoandboris Both. They should work together.

These people are here illegally so you are suggesting we should reward them for their criminal activities. They need to be returned from whence they came.

1323169223514984448 2020-11-02 15:45:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @johnredwood Seasonal flu deaths must now be being recorded as Covid as it appears flu has completely disappeared from Britain. Something stinks.

1322631222733004802 2020-11-01 04:07:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LanceForman Covid has scared flu right out of Britain. This place ain’t big enough for the both of them so it would seem, unless flu cases are being recorded as Covid of course.
1322627641632034822 2020-11-01 03:52:57 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PoliticsPollss @MandyMoseley5 Yes, but not Labour.

1322621579826704387 2020-11-01 03:28:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DianeDiy @BorisJohnson Oh and you can’t “beat” a virus. We haven’t managed it with the flu, even with a vaccine.
1322621297281687553 2020-11-01 03:27:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DianeDiy @BorisJohnson Shield the elderly and vulnerable and let everything else carry on as normal. We are equipped with fantastic immune systems which are robust enough to fight off a virus that is only dangerous to the aforementioned.
1322618320282148866 2020-11-01 03:15:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson That’s me and the Conservatives parting company. You are killing Britain. You’ll never have my vote again.
1322598683679068162 2020-11-01 01:57:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RealProfTwatter They were attacking our history last week, now they are re-enacting it.

1322554615523610624 2020-10-31 23:02:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PatriotActive66 Must be the readiness to kneel before them possibly?

1322507304101662722 2020-10-31 19:54:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MayorofLondon @TheVoiceNews I’ve heard it all now. The political party that has been found guilty of racism is Labour. Those who cry racism at every turn are those who are indeed guilty of the very thing they accuse everyone else of. It’s called projection. Jog on.
1322480696938635265 2020-10-31 18:09:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NazShahBfd Oh shut up, you know, for the sake of diversity.
1322478972907802624 2020-10-31 18:02:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @fbptcc @BorisJohnson That would require an undercarriage of epic proportions and there is no-one in our Govt or Parliament who is in possession of such a thing.
1322477801384062976 2020-10-31 17:57:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @guyverhofstadt The operative words being “once more”. When you open borders and insist EU member states take their “quotas” of unknown immigrants from medieval cultures, this is what happens and will continue to happen again, and again and again. Save your measly words - you facilitated this.
1322462663142744064 2020-10-31 16:57:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @alanmcn1 @carlnorwich We never “managed” the flu - thousands still die from it year on year (except for this year of course as it’s been subject to a brand change, it’s now morphed into COVID) even with a vaccine and we’ve never shut down the country for that.
1322426534800609282 2020-10-31 14:33:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MSANNCOOPER @Blackburnjack Not of their own volition. The only way to get them all out is to outlaw Islam, shut down all mosques and ban halal. All European countries would have to do the same though, otherwise they’ll just move their violence/barbarism to another European state.
1322416723673440256 2020-10-31 13:54:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @britishlivesuk @Olgachristie This is what they want to keep their victimhood alive. Whites will stop contributing, we’ll then be called racist for not contributing and then they’ll ramp up the “poor blacks” narrative again. Rinse and repeat.
1322251124922060801 2020-10-31 02:56:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> Check out Reclaim Party. I just joined.  https://t.co/Nr7o4LU5wi

1322176726567424004 2020-10-30 22:01:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> Why is this being allowed @BorisJohnson ? Time to show some gonads.

We have sleeper cells with over 20,000 jihadi’s (that our security services know of) on the “watch list”. How do we tell the difference?

1322027705064370177 2020-10-30 12:09:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MahyarTousi It’s a predominately white country. If he can’t handle that he can leave for an Islamic state of choice.

1321867233887485952 2020-10-30 01:31:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NadineDorries Same with the grooming gangs. He knew then what we know now and did nothing about it. The man is a snake.
1321798757680357376 2020-10-29 20:59:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @guyverhofstadt He outsmarted you and clearly that’s still stinging a bit.

1321471352990244864 2020-10-28 23:18:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters Well as I’m white and David Lammy said no white saviours are required, I’m happy to let the black folk contribute.

Love Nicole Kidman as an actress &amp; was interested to watch until I saw he was involved, so won’t now bother. It’s one thing to have a political opinion, it’s quite another to berate &amp; name call those holding a different view but I guess that’s what the left do best.

1321076370143850496 2020-10-27 21:08:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @gaza380 @madogs93 @NikkiStix55 You said he only cares about himself - if he did, he’d be taking a salary, but he doesn’t. Jesus wept, you’ve fallen for the MSM bs regarding his taxes. Suggest you research a little before regurgitating the MSM narrative.
1321075848041144323 2020-10-27 21:06:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @gaza380 @madogs93 @NikkiStix55 Masks don’t work against viruses- it even says so on the boxes of medical grade masks and with a survival rate of 99.8% why should everyone be locked down or forced to wear face nappies for a virus less dangerous than the flu?
1321025440480415744 2020-10-27 17:46:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @talkRADIO @cristo_radio @GerryKcomic I’m going to declare everything racist so we don’t have to listen to this drivel day in day out. The countryside is racist, Covid is racist, letterboxes are racist hell, just having white skin is racist, so if I declare everything racist nothing else can be labelled as such.
1321023051312570368 2020-10-27 17:36:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @uk_lollipop And they STILL want more.

1320993138085908480 2020-10-27 15:38:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BritishAlba @AlanWilkes1951 @BorisJohnson @sugawitter @JapanGov @COP26 They have funded the scheme by giving local authorities millions in extra funds. Where does this end? Free everything for the feckless? There are no “starving” children in Britain. If there are, please provide pictures of the emaciated millions. I can provide plenty from Africa.
1320975429784739842 2020-10-27 14:27:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @gaza380 @madogs93 @NikkiStix55 Seriously? How could he have prevented deaths from a virus? He’s not superman FGS and Trump hasn’t taken a Presidential salary, so that really shows he only cares about himself right? He may not be the most articulate man, but the best thing about him - he can’t be bought.
1320968930031247361 2020-10-27 14:01:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @riot_rebecca @visitwales That’s exactly how he is acting, like a little Hitler. The man will destroy what’s left of Wales if he isn’t removed.
1320954903238463496 2020-10-27 13:06:05 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Why should Boris speak to Rashford? Just because he’s a rich footballer who virtue signals, does that make him important and demand a personal phone call from our PM? The likes of Rashford really need to get over themselves.
1320786656006426625 2020-10-27 01:57:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BarrySheerman Any links to pics of all these millions of emaciated children you lot keep talking about per chance?

1320770813453312000 2020-10-27 00:54:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MervusP30 They should make the absent fathers pay for their kids but instead the taxpayer is always expected to pick up the tab.

1320751775260049411 2020-10-26 23:38:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @boblister_poole Couple of cousins, one has 4 kids, never worked lives in a 4 bed council house, huge tv, smokes, huge pool in the garden &amp; disability car (nothing wrong with her) Other cousin works 2 jobs, as does hubby live in a 3 bed paying full rent, no car or mod cons. 1st cousin makes me 🤮
1320732388499034114 2020-10-26 22:21:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @John50213207 I thought it was that pesky whispering grass.

1320698230221475840 2020-10-26 20:06:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hscptcrash @onebritishguy @danieltomsdad @JoannaLePut Excuse for whom? The welfare system is not designed for all &amp; sundry to help themselves. It’s there to assist the poorest &amp; most vulnerable in society not provide a living wage.
1320683753111490560 2020-10-26 19:08:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hscptcrash @onebritishguy @danieltomsdad @JoannaLePut Who chose to have the kids in the first place? If people can’t afford to feed kids, the shouldn’t be having them and then expect taxpayers to pick up the tab for their life choices. Welfare should be a temporary stop gap, not a career choice.
1320678562177888274 2020-10-26 18:48:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Independent Tariffs are applied by the EU for goods entering the EU from non EU countries, which they keep and pass on to us, so please explain as we are forging our own deals with these countries, with no tariffs, how food will become more expensive?

1320655382163894272 2020-10-26 17:15:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KingBobIIV Well we have the “white privilege” don’t forget so it can’t possibly refer to us.
1320652574782038017 2020-10-26 17:04:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Startinglifeag1 Then someone needs to remove his perceived authority as historical statues and monuments belong to all of us, not just Londoners, if you can call them that these days.
1320651844281081856 2020-10-26 17:01:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bella___Trixxx A nauseating bleeding heart who thinks she has the right to tell everyone how to think and who to ignore. Just spent a couple of minutes on her timeline. Feel quite 🤢 now. I wouldn’t lose any sleep over it that’s for sure.
1320649270610087936 2020-10-26 16:51:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MJSullivan12 @RichardBurgon Sultana wants to introduce a supertax for the rich, which would include Rashford &amp; Co so it won’t ever see the light of day. They are more than happy to virtue signal as long as someone other than them picks up the tab.
1320645990324576257 2020-10-26 16:38:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichardBurgon Why not raise child benefits to £100 per week per child, then we can all sit at home all day &amp; whine that it still isn’t enough free stuff. Problem though, who will generate the cash to pay this as us taxpayers will join the feckless on our sofas? Cue Labour’s Magic Money Tree.
1320625315929088000 2020-10-26 15:16:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Tony_Yorkshire 😂 We should be worried with all 11 Lib UnDems on the rampage again...not. The party has tried this nonsense before - what is it that they’re just not getting about a democratic vote by the electorate?
1320612472152297472 2020-10-26 14:25:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AlfredWintle @zarahsultana That would suggest she’d be happy to put her hand in her own pocket but that isn’t the case with any Labour MP - they prefer to have their hands in other people’s pockets, specifically those who earn more than them. She could start applying the supertax to Rashford &amp; Co.
1320608247250853889 2020-10-26 14:08:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ricky_K67 Positively emaciated those two...not.

1320385643386703873 2020-10-25 23:24:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @visitwales Wales is my motherland &amp; your pathetic restrictions have prevented me from visiting my family for over six months and this latest lunacy from Drakeford is beyond ridiculous. Just who the hell is he to decide what is essential, &amp; how does that keep people safe from a bloody virus?

1320373156910190592 2020-10-25 22:34:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SoupTomatoSoup @cpearn1 @Keir_Starmer You wouldn’t know the point if it smacked you around the face shouting “I’m the point”. Parents are responsible for their kids, not the taxpayer or the Government. Social services is available for those genuinely struggling all the others are just looking for more handouts.
1320372451650449409 2020-10-25 22:31:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SoupTomatoSoup @harryjoe929 @Keir_Starmer That kid is not starving.

How about taking responsibility for yourself and stop whining or are you going to continue through life wanting your hand held at every step?
1320371034156138496 2020-10-25 22:26:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SoupTomatoSoup @theJockney72 @Keir_Starmer So, if a job, topped up with benefits isn’t enough to live on, why add to the burden by having kids? You just expect everyone else to pick up the tab for your choices.
1320349812110348290 2020-10-25 21:01:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ANARCHOCAPITAL7 @ghost_wales @JeanHair2 Wales has a devolved Govt - a Labour Govt at that. Were you really not aware of that fact? Jesus wept.
1320334004021768192 2020-10-25 19:58:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jeanschiech Happy Birthday Jean! Glad to hear you’re having a blast! 🎉

1320326998045110273 2020-10-25 19:31:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SoupTomatoSoup @Keir_Starmer If there are genuine difficulties, then social services will be involved but that shouldn’t mean the Govt should give blanket handouts to all parents because a tiny minority are struggling.
1320319441746485248 2020-10-25 19:00:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @VeritasHere You are indeed. My turn to thank you for your thoughtfulness during these worrying trends. 😂
1320318799942397955 2020-10-25 18:58:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @VeritasHere I’m glad you mentioned this. I could have been happily scrolling and been traumatised myself by someone else’s innocent screenshot. I will proceed with caution for the rest of the day. 😀
1320316393003323394 2020-10-25 18:48:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @izziefruity @SoupTomatoSoup @Keir_Starmer Absolutely. That is what the welfare system was designed for - not to be used as a lifestyle choice &amp; cover up for bad parental decisions. My cousin has 4 kids, never contributed, claims every benefit going, has all the mod cons, while others work &amp; don’t have half the stuff.
1320305427154980864 2020-10-25 18:05:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SoupTomatoSoup @Keir_Starmer Oh ok, let’s just raise that to £100 per week, per child shall we? If you breed them, YOU are responsible for feeding them.
1320297601099534338 2020-10-25 17:34:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @VeritasHere Thankfully, it blocked me a while ago so I haven’t been subjected to its drivel for a long while. DM is open if you need psychological support during this unexpected trauma. 😀
1320296346495180801 2020-10-25 17:29:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer What are parents spending their child benefit payments on if not on to put food in their children’s mouths? These benefit payments do not stop when children are not at school so it is not the taxpayers responsibility to feed other people’s kids.
1320282271530844160 2020-10-25 16:33:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer @LucyMPowell He hasn’t turned his back on anyone unless he has put a stop to child benefit payments, which he hasn’t so just political virtue signalling as usual from the useless Party that is Labour. You and your motley crew of foul mouthed unintelligent MPs are a disgrace to this country.

1319854010690641921 2020-10-24 12:11:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @icrimages @AlexIden2 @metpoliceuk It appears the Met are scared of everyone other than the white indigenous. The Nigerians have been demonstrating - no sign of the Met, but as soon as any peaceful white folk turn up to protest lockdowns or a maskless Brit is spotted, out come the batons, riot gear &amp; aggression.
1319842707481690113 2020-10-24 11:26:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @talkRADIO Who is making these decisions, and who decides what is essential? This needs to be stopped - it’s disgusting. This isn’t about any virus- this is now definitely about control.
1319677842087645184 2020-10-24 00:31:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Upyourjunker1 Couldn’t be happier actually.
1319659963879460865 2020-10-23 23:20:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock Nothing beats a cwtch which is what our elderly need. So cruel to deny them contact with their loved ones before they die.
1319658278247419909 2020-10-23 23:13:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Upyourjunker1 👋 then.

1319609848493998080 2020-10-23 20:01:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JohnCaveAusten It is! I don’t know how many machines I’ve destroyed. At the very least it has to handle three loads a day! 😀
1319609332225478657 2020-10-23 19:59:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JohnCaveAusten 😂 That’s completely normal and acceptable for a man, although I do draw the line at a fortnight with hubby because I’m such a fuss pot. Did they make their own way to the machine or did they require your assistance? 😀
1319603719571464198 2020-10-23 19:36:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JohnCaveAusten Hubby is the same with jeans - he’ll wear them until they walk themselves to the washing machine if I let him, but jeans with me are in the wash even if I’ve only had them on for an hour! My Mum is the same, so possibly learned behaviour - a family idiosyncrasy! 😀
1319596767126687745 2020-10-23 19:09:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JohnCaveAusten I even use fresh towels each time and cannot wear the same clothes for two consecutive days either! I’m not OCD though - just like to feel clean! Hubby thinks I’m nuts! 😀

1319523619194720257 2020-10-23 14:18:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AGFitness_gla One question - what are child benefits for?
1319479233123672065 2020-10-23 11:22:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @clarewaterfall @sandieshoes @its_loulou @anthonynichol62 They are not vulnerable at all. The parents receive numerous benefits, including child benefit, which is supposed to be for the children, so it’s their responsibility to feed their kids from the child benefits they receive.
1319289969471483906 2020-10-22 22:50:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jjcwow Agree 100%. He should have walked on 15th - his own deadline.

No dignity, no pride just parasites. Why the hell would I be jealous of that? Besides, I have a bigger house, bigger tv and worked for it not sponged off the state.

1319265365143244800 2020-10-22 21:12:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Prisoner0071 @DarrenHen_ I blocked him a while ago - creepy.
1319264188183826433 2020-10-22 21:07:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @its_loulou @anthonynichol62 @sandieshoes My cousin has 4 kids, her &amp; her partner have never worked or contributed, lives practically rent free in a 4 bed council house, both smoke, have a massive TV, huge swimming pool in the garden &amp; claim every benefit going. Why should I, as a taxpayer, pay for her kids &amp; lifestyle?
1319254911129931782 2020-10-22 20:30:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @robertjstroud @MattHancock Whoever breeds them, it’s their responsibility to feed them - not mine (as a taxpayer) or the Governments who are guardians of those funds.
1319253313683136512 2020-10-22 20:24:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock What is the use of extra staff if the NHS is barely functioning outside of COVID or are they extras for the Tik Tok videos?
1319229738842574848 2020-10-22 18:50:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @realMarkWebster 😂 And you were whinging about someone blocking you! Hypocrite.
1319227629342494720 2020-10-22 18:42:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @realMarkWebster Think that’s probably more to do with your attitude than anything else. Just unfollowed you myself. Not necessary to be so rude.
1319226808366174209 2020-10-22 18:39:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @realMarkWebster @afneil I didn’t say it was an influenza virus - it is however a member of the coronavirus family - same as the flu, Sparky - whatever the hell that means.
1319220951071051776 2020-10-22 18:15:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PaulFoulds10 @afneil We have never “controlled” flu, even with a vaccine, so do we spend the rest of our lives being restricted by these “measures”?
1319191347941822464 2020-10-22 16:18:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @afneil Covid appears to have scared flu out of this country or could it be that flu, as a fellow coronavirus, the cases being recorded as COVID, are actually flu?
1319159305506033666 2020-10-22 14:11:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @johncu50 @diddly1525 @GerardBattenUK @RichardBurgon @UKLabour So what is child benefit for if not to feed the kids? How much more do these people want to feed the kids THEY chose to have?
1318944209475411971 2020-10-21 23:56:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Brexit Oh do jog on love. Getting worried now you can see your cash cow’s coat tails. 👋
1318909320076185600 2020-10-21 21:37:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MayorofLondon You shouldn’t have spent your budget then should you, Mr Incompetent.
1318908710899560450 2020-10-21 21:35:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy @BorisJohnson Jesus wept. This coming from you. 😂
1318870565978050561 2020-10-21 19:03:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GMB @kategarraway I think everyone knows the answer to that one. It’s one thing to hold any Govt to account but quite another to shout over ministers following questions by arrogant presenters.
1318856677698031618 2020-10-21 18:08:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Kevin_Maguire @TfL @GMB Khan blew the budget on vanity projects, so it’s Khans responsibility to fill the hole he made.
1318856191439765505 2020-10-21 18:06:33 +0800 <Deedy2201> @leicspolice Women have the menopause, so why are you using the word “people”?
1318803765743489025 2020-10-21 14:38:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NigelKellow @liz_brown2020 No ta. I’ve never had the flu vaccine and never had the flu. This COVID vaccine will not come fully tested with long term effects, plus no liability for manufacturers.
1318618213010333696 2020-10-21 02:20:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ranger_samy @Kippaxer76 @TerryStorey4 @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford I know, but the fact remains, every parent is eligible to claim child benefit, regardless of earnings and we earned interest on the daughters account which cancelled out the tax and still left her quids in.
1318613707484762115 2020-10-21 02:03:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> What the hell kind of sick are we allowing into our country?
1318612669973319680 2020-10-21 01:58:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JoeBiden 😂 Sad deluded fool. Any American thinking of voting for you must be nuts.
1318608890372755462 2020-10-21 01:43:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CrimeLdn 29? Are you sure?
1318602046640193547 2020-10-21 01:16:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ranger_samy @Kippaxer76 @TerryStorey4 @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford Well it is true because I’ve done it, albeit a few years ago now and we stopped the payments when my our daughter went into further education and had no tax penalties.
1318599665395388416 2020-10-21 01:07:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ranger_samy @Kippaxer76 @TerryStorey4 @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford You are still eligible to claim child benefit even if you earn over £60k. I earn over £60k and tried to stop the payments but was told the money was for the child, not for me, so the money went into my child’s bank account for Uni fees.
1318596706104205312 2020-10-21 00:55:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GrahamJ18821678 This happened to me in North Wales. Went to a pub with English hubby- he ordered drinks and the locals sitting at the bar started to insult him in Welsh, unbeknown to them, I am a Welsh speaker and told them off in my mother tongue. Their faces were a picture.
1318592056550457346 2020-10-21 00:36:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson Is the test able to differentiate between the flu (as it’s a coronavirus) and COVID (now labelled coronavirus by the scientists) as it appears COVID has scared even the flu out of this country. No cases of regular flu but lots of Covid. Hmmm.
1318589834743742465 2020-10-21 00:28:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @alex_brian92 It’s had it’s name changed by deed poll to COVID
1318588901104242693 2020-10-21 00:24:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @mattybooboo75 Brown took us to the brink during his short tenure. They must never see power again.
1318559955918770181 2020-10-20 22:29:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock I’ve finally lost my patience with you after reading two stories this morning of a young Mum of 4 who died due to her Chemo being paused because of this bloody virus, &amp; similarly a 34 year old young man for the same reason. You know what you can do with your false positive tests.
1318557301851197443 2020-10-20 22:18:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KingBobIIV @talkRADIO @iancollinsuk He blocked me months ago. As well as being a first class dick, he’s also a grade a coward. He doesn’t like anyone questioning his warped world view. Well, he was besties with Saville, so enough said I suppose.
1318556103412690945 2020-10-20 22:14:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Krista63231295 @Macetrain @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford Yep. I have a cousin with 4 kids, neither Mum or Dad works (he gave up work to become her “carer” to rake in more cash) they live in a four bedroom Council house pay minimal rent &amp; claim every benefit going. They smoke, have a massive tv &amp; huge pool in the garden. Makes me sick.
1318543336442155010 2020-10-20 21:23:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ukhomeoffice @GillJames54 How about sending the arrivals back? Thousands already here that WE are paying for and are we still paying France to prevent these crossings?
1318538683625201666 2020-10-20 21:04:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JoelBaccas Why bother coming back?
1318501079437463552 2020-10-20 18:35:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer @MarcusRashford Every parent of every child receives child benefit payments to supposedly feed their children, otherwise what is it for? Why should I, as a taxpayer, be forced to contribute to someone else’s life choices? You breed them, you feed them.
1318402901707018241 2020-10-20 12:05:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RhonddaBryant You’re the danger to Wales. What a nasty little man you are.
1318257147801706502 2020-10-20 02:26:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @newjonnyberlin I agree with Ann. Watched Dancing on Ice with a same sex couple and it just looked awkward. Stopped watching Strictly - too woke and gushy.
1318247208077172736 2020-10-20 01:46:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @carolJhedges @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier Don’t be so bloody ridiculous.
1318238792583680007 2020-10-20 01:13:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Her reaction doesn’t speak for me, or the nation. Traitorous mare.
1318210437725474816 2020-10-19 23:20:34 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy THEY ARE NOT REFUGEES. FGS.
1318188818088996864 2020-10-19 21:54:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNewsBreak Labour are destroying Wales.
1318162899211374602 2020-10-19 20:11:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @foxyjeepster No, so they can get away with it and avoid prison.
1318162730898149379 2020-10-19 20:10:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NKrankie No. It’s always someone else’s fault no matter what the subject. All part of keeping the victimhood alive and kicking so they can demand special treatment for everything.
1318143970820689927 2020-10-19 18:56:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BarrySheerman Still desperately hanging on to that remain straw.
1318076592283897856 2020-10-19 14:28:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Pigman @JeremyVineOn5 Oh yes, forgot that one!
1318076073767206913 2020-10-19 14:26:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JeremyVineOn5 No, why should I be? I’d rather eat treated chicken from the US than Salmonella laden meat from the EU.
1318049754685853696 2020-10-19 12:42:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy So black people should now automatically get top marks at school, degrees at University, acting positions, become MP’s, professors, doctors, engineers etc based solely on their skin colour or don’t you think black people are capable of achieving anything on their own merit?
1318047490818584577 2020-10-19 12:33:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Oh change the “everything is about colour” record. Beyond boring.
1317831462067064833 2020-10-18 22:14:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KarlTurnerMP You highlight just how undemocratic your Party is with this continual bleating. The electorate voted to leave and we have left. Move the hell on.
1317756213409533953 2020-10-18 17:15:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichardBentall @acgrayling This from a man with FBPE in his bio 😂
1317712847376470016 2020-10-18 14:23:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LondonCalling82 Sky are not far behind.
1317679996111081472 2020-10-18 12:12:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @brown12008 I emptied box number 24 of what seems like thousands, following our house move.
1317505496702648321 2020-10-18 00:39:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @cla55icdom @sssausage14 @Christo03301021 @Tony_Yorkshire @cannock_villa @KEdge23 I probably pay more in taxes than you earn in a year and I voted leave.
1317504079166427139 2020-10-18 00:33:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @v_crouch @paulafr68963440 Thing is, I find cooking a chore whereas hubby enjoys it, so he deals with the bins and meals while I take care of everything else! He wouldn’t have a clue with the washing machine or vacuum!
1317479205215604738 2020-10-17 22:54:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson @jacindaardern God help NZ. Humans cannot tackle the climate- it changes all by itself - always has, always will.
1317470983771488256 2020-10-17 22:22:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @thehill Even if he sticks to his promise of going to Oz (which I doubt) who will actually give a stuff and miss him, and why does he think anyone cares? A lot of other narcissistic “celebs” threatened to leave if Trump was elected - still there though.
1317468556477534209 2020-10-17 22:12:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters It’s the other way around Macron and specifically, you need our fish.
1317434466353221632 2020-10-17 19:57:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @paulafr68963440 I’ve been married to hubby for 23 years and during those years I’ve possibly only cooked half a dozen times. Hubby cooks dinner every evening and breakfast fry ups at the weekend. How lucky am I? 😀
1317419694715002882 2020-10-17 18:58:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SteveLaws_ These idiots still think they are refugees.
1317419029343162370 2020-10-17 18:55:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PortTalbotPrick 👍 Followed and retweeted!
1317418759485796352 2020-10-17 18:54:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LBC And?
1317418651360940032 2020-10-17 18:54:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SueWhitaker11 @MailOnline If this is true, that’s the final nail in the BBC coffin.
1317418289283407874 2020-10-17 18:52:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Telegraph Show us the poll because it appears that the majority of us were not asked. Shield the elderly/vulnerable and let the rest of us get on with living our lives. The last lockdown didn’t work, why should another? We have to learn to live with this virus, just like all the others.
1317346109463973889 2020-10-17 14:06:02 +0800 <Deedy2201> @campbellclaret Your obvious annoyance at the majority finally getting their wish is beyond delicious.
1317116716560883724 2020-10-16 22:54:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BrexitHome @ladyjan67 Jog on Macron.
1317103264773644289 2020-10-16 22:01:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @acgrayling If you prefer to live in an EU member state, you’ve had plenty of time (over four years) to relocate to a European country of choice to retain your precious EU citizenship, so why are you still here?
1317040343762821120 2020-10-16 17:51:02 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Scotty01041874 The countryside is racist too. It won’t be long before oxygen is considered racist.
1317027856044691456 2020-10-16 17:01:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Nigel100007 @DaxGigandet It’s definitely been around longer than first thought. The timing of its arrival coincides with Chinese New Year, oddly!
1317021269896785921 2020-10-16 16:35:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DaxGigandet I think both hubby and I had a mild dose (unusual dry cough) after he returned from a business trip to the States (we assume picked up on the plane) in mid February. Apart from that, we don’t know anyone else who has had it.
1317020158486077441 2020-10-16 16:30:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Carolinepanett1 And she was going to leave if Boris became PM. Gobby mare is still here though taking the white mans £.
1317018163230507009 2020-10-16 16:22:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Andrew_Steward9 @I_am_porr1dge @DavidGHFrost @vonderleyen Absolute sales are irrelevant are they? 😂
1316977127036719105 2020-10-16 13:39:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock You cannot defeat a virus - why do you keep saying you can? We haven’t managed to “defeat” the flu, even with a vaccine, so open up the country and let everyone get on with their lives. Other illnesses are killing people more than this bloody virus along with our economy.
1316940560310112258 2020-10-16 11:14:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Birdybabe07 There isn’t one.
1316934518926954496 2020-10-16 10:50:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @buhashee @DavidGHFrost @vonderleyen Scotland is part of the UK and the UK as a whole voted to leave. The EU also laughed Sturgeon out of Brussels when she asked for Scotland to remain, and there won’t be another Indy ref.
1316933923948154880 2020-10-16 10:48:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @I_am_porr1dge @DavidGHFrost @vonderleyen Oh it will be the EU asking us for a deal considering they run a £90 billion trade surplus with us.
1316809988522807297 2020-10-16 02:35:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @UK_NormalBloke And when she gets there, she can eff off some more.
1316808099714473987 2020-10-16 02:28:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidGHFrost @vonderleyen Just walk away. Enough is enough. They just want everything their own way. Move to WTO and if Boris blinks or capitulates as May did, the Cons will be finished. We’re sick of waiting to have our country back.
1316782201141424128 2020-10-16 00:45:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ernestdecugnac @IainDale @Suffragentleman @JeremyVineOn5 @LozzaFox @y_alibhai @theJeremyVine Of course she won’t- she’s making a good living from the “white man” she hates but is happy enough to take his money.
1316730993672368131 2020-10-15 21:21:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer The second day of the same message appearing on my timeline. Had an original thought, ever?
1316674590714798081 2020-10-15 17:37:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @OTVDesk Or they’ll be allowed to take performance enhancing drugs to ensure they win.
1316673608006152192 2020-10-15 17:33:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @leanjeanp @SadiqKhan Khan would know all about failure - he’s an expert at it.
1316656863556104192 2020-10-15 16:27:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JeremyVineOn5 You can’t “stall” defeat or control a virus. As for the country who handled it best - that would be Sweden.
1316613481613983744 2020-10-15 13:34:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LadBonnie @MichaelBlowfie2 In my experience, far right extremism only becomes a thing in response to the rise of far left or Islamic extremism. Attack the source, not the response.
1316596510491058184 2020-10-15 12:27:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Alf_Grant @Suffragentleman People like her are not interested in debate &amp; are not capable of it because they are filled to the brim with hate. Why should anyone be subjected to her vile abuse? This is her host country, &amp; this is the way she behaves towards any white British man. Shame we can’t deport her.
1316593927764480000 2020-10-15 12:17:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @IainDale @Suffragentleman @JeremyVineOn5 @LozzaFox @y_alibhai @theJeremyVine I’m not a fan of that word, but in this instance, I can’t think of a better way to describe this hateful hag. She gets away with her hate speech almost daily and I sincerely hope Lozza sues her. If she hates this country and the white people in it so much, she needs to leave.
1316434260543315968 2020-10-15 01:42:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GMB It’s hilarious and good on the Govt for continuing to ignore Morgan the Mouth.
1316433752965500928 2020-10-15 01:40:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DaveDon77 @y_alibhai Happy to take the “white man’s” £ though. She’s nothing but a foul, hate filled racist old hag.
1316430183583289344 2020-10-15 01:26:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Wera_Hobhouse Whatever happened to meritocracy or should BAME simply be elevated because of their skin colour?
1316373918756868096 2020-10-14 21:42:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jjcwow He’d better, after all he issued the deadline. This farce has gone on long enough. If the EU keep delaying, they keep getting shedloads of our cash, so it now needs to end, swiftly followed by move to WTO.
1316373048140992513 2020-10-14 21:39:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @dave_etheridge @campbellclaret 😀 No worries!
1316372683643289601 2020-10-14 21:37:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer Are you on some kind of repetitive time loop? That’s the third time I’ve seen this tweet in the last couple of hours. Circuit break = lockdown which we were heading for anyway, so still no original ideas or solutions to bring to the table oh &amp; you cannot defeat or control a virus
1316371868719480832 2020-10-14 21:34:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @dave_etheridge @campbellclaret I’m a Mrs, but I’ll take it! 😀
1316353393137516545 2020-10-14 20:21:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AyoCaesar Start a crowdfunder yourself - I’ll contribute. One way only though because we don’t want you back on this “cursed island” - that’s the deal.
1316352010984226816 2020-10-14 20:15:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @campbellclaret What’s ridiculous about it? Should only lefties be allowed to take up seats in the HoL’s or are you still smarting over Bully Bercow being overlooked? 😂
1316334538172358656 2020-10-14 19:06:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MayorofLondon 😂 Your final warning? Who the hell do you think you are? Hopefully you’ll be ousted soon and we’ll have a proper Mayor in charge of our Capital, not an incompetent muppet like you.
1316333771453616128 2020-10-14 19:03:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CllrAlanRhodes 😂 A trip to Specsavers is in order. All I see is an opportunist desperately trying to sound as if he’s cracked it by using different words for another lockdown, which is where we were heading anyway. In truth, Starmer wouldn’t know an original thought if it bit him on the harris
1316332652925014022 2020-10-14 18:58:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock Did a vaccine make us safe from the flu? No. Shield the vulnerable, get on with living and get the economy off it’s arse. I will not be taking any vaccine - never had a flu vaccine, never had the flu and for a virus with a 99.6% mortality rate, I’ll take my chances.
1316295102420135936 2020-10-14 16:29:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Tony_Robinson Well then you guessed wrong. We don’t support his desperate attempt to appear to have found an alternative solution. What difference will a circuit break make? A three month lockdown had very little impact apparently, so what the hell difference will a couple of weeks make?
1316243135014621185 2020-10-14 13:03:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Simon88UK @DavidLammy Lammy hasn’t got a scooby. He just repeats what Brylcreem Starmer says without actually knowing what it means.  https://t.co/S2lv653JwS
1316242360028848130 2020-10-14 13:00:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Tell us David, as you seem to think you’re the expert, how exactly do you “control” a virus and how on earth will a “circuit break” make any difference whatsoever? You lot are clueless and are desperately trying to sound knowledgeable and credible but as usual, failing dismally.
1316082212060700674 2020-10-14 02:23:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BoerboelUK I’d love to see them try and enforce this tripe on me.
1316077875691491328 2020-10-14 02:06:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer Missed it - thankfully. Didn’t want to risk being bored into a coma.
1316061795287736322 2020-10-14 01:02:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AyoCaesar Simple solution. Bugger off somewhere else. Problem solved.
1316052893187878912 2020-10-14 00:27:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @tnewtondunn Thanks for the heads up. I’ll make sure I don’t accidentally tune in. Don’t fancy being lulled into a coma by the charisma free, monotone brylcreem head.
1316048963141861381 2020-10-14 00:11:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @holland_tom Even if there is, why would anyone take it considering it’s been rushed? We have a vaccine for flu - doesn’t stop people dying as a result as viruses have a habit of mutating.
1315976590568939521 2020-10-13 19:24:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Did they show the same concern to our fishermen when they were raping OUR waters? That’d be a no, so why should we give a stuff about their livelihoods now?

1315891912381956098 2020-10-13 13:47:34 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock You stopped calling it Covid &amp; now refer to it as coronavirus, of which the common cold is one, your tests therefore will produce a positive test for a cold. We cannot suppress viruses- we still have flu despite having a vaccine, yet no lockdowns for that and it kills more people
1315885706703704065 2020-10-13 13:22:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Sirjervisfruit Apart from sniping and criticism, nothing, nada, zip. No solutions or ideas just hot air.

1315715173601161222 2020-10-13 02:05:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock You cannot “control” a virus. We haven’t managed to control the flu, even with a vaccine.
1315714089436483592 2020-10-13 02:00:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Kevin_Maguire @GillJames54 When Starmer actually offers solutions or ideas, he may gain some credibility, but to continually criticise and snipe from the sidelines is not remotely forensic, it’s the easiest job in the world.
1315664862568165377 2020-10-12 22:45:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @latimeralder Covid went on a month’s holiday when we locked down, but came back when it saw that things were opening up again. Canny little bugger this virus. According to Lammy, it’s even racist.

1315264910075531264 2020-10-11 20:16:05 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Reniour Because they feel they are more important than anyone else as they’re famous, therefore think we want to know.
1315235274935287808 2020-10-11 18:18:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AlfredWintle @BBCNews It depends who you talk to. Lammy reckons BAME are more susceptible to COVID and climate (the virus is racist) but others who support BLM reckon they are immune. Well they’re immune from prosecution and criticism, so why not the virus?
1315233970263474177 2020-10-11 18:13:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCNews If she refuses to resign, she should be sacked. She knew she was infected and carried on regardless.

1315170306747772929 2020-10-11 14:00:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCSport Women being the operative word. If you are born a biological man, you will die a man regardless of what you do to your body in between, therefore, men, trans or otherwise, should not compete against women in women’s sports.

1315146768623992833 2020-10-11 12:26:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @cheshiretoad How can he be so precise? Has he had a word with the virus and informed it that it will be deported from the UK in September 2021? He cannot control or suppress a virus. You only have to look to the flu to work that out, so what is really going on?

Coronavirus covers a number of viruses, including the common cold which may explain the rise in number of cases following testing, which isn’t very accurate anyway. When will you start being honest about what’s REALLY going on?

Covid is racist, every non black person in Britain is racist, and now the climate is racist. The snow, if it falls this year or next will be racist as it’s white or should we all pretend it’s black to satisfy your disturbing obsession with colour?

1313080025848127490 2020-10-05 19:34:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NMackz @sainsburys @LozzaFox You nailed it. Providing support for their employees - colour needn’t have been mentioned. If the word black was replaced with white - imagine the outrage - it works both ways. Widely celebrated? First year I’ve ever heard of it and I don’t need any lectures from a grocer.
1313068762548051968 2020-10-05 18:49:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> What do you make of this?  https://t.co/wqm6ynJtAZ

1313053521974112257 2020-10-05 17:48:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NMackz @sainsburys @LozzaFox They are. And?
1313005364221284355 2020-10-05 14:37:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Johnhodg10 What a cutie! Congratulations Gramps!
1312995994724970496 2020-10-05 14:00:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews Great to hear they are being put to good use.
1312974739716091905 2020-10-05 12:35:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DaisyAdeleleo Their desperation to create division is relentless.
1312973450173198341 2020-10-05 12:30:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer Well you’re in Parliament, what ideas do YOU have to give people hope? What are YOUR solutions to the crisis the country, and indeed the World finds itself in? What’s that Kier?   Tumbleweed.
1312971966874292224 2020-10-05 12:24:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @sainsburys @LozzaFox You are creating division by specifically using skin colour and then to follow up with the “if customers don’t like it, shop elsewhere” line is not going to do your bank balance any favours. Your wish is granted. Ocado/Marks it is. That’s approx £10k pa already lost. 👋
1312969213888397312 2020-10-05 12:13:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @misterduncan @Iwontcalmdown @m1nt9reen @LozzaFox @sainsburys So why make the colour distinction? Why not just say “safe spaces available for all employees” not specifically, black employees? Sainsbury’s are creating division here.
1312963863613145088 2020-10-05 11:52:33 +0800 <Deedy2201> @abline11 @Gerat1t Like everywhere else in society, these people don’t want to do anything on merit, they want a free pass they think they are entitled to because they are not white and cry racism when they don’t get it. Time for a swift return to meritocracy
1312960603397459969 2020-10-05 11:39:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @nicolathorp_ That’s all you lefties are capable of - name calling, labelling and attempts to cancel people for holding different views to your own. The race card has been abused to such a degree, no-one cares anymore. Sick of hearing it - even COVID is racist according to you and your ilk FGS
1312794050009985027 2020-10-05 00:37:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Michael57055027 And a damn fine actor, on merit.
1312793629895819271 2020-10-05 00:36:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Well we certainly don’t deserve you and your useless Party who have nothing to offer other than criticism and hindsight. As for “waffle” - you’d know all about that. You do nothing else but.
1312726645837529088 2020-10-04 20:09:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RealJamesWoods We don’t want him or Markle.
1312695028087746560 2020-10-04 18:04:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @darrenhunter2 @BGT Avoided it like the plague it has now become.
1312627859366858752 2020-10-04 13:37:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BGT @Nabilu Not remotely funny or entertaining. Just anti white bilge. Bye BGT.
1312624861412556800 2020-10-04 13:25:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @kenpopekpz Have you questioned the entire population? If not, you’re talking through your harris. The majority have voted to leave the EU THREE times so your assertion is fanciful wishful thinking on your part. Get over it FGS.
1312623263034507267 2020-10-04 13:19:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SandraStubbs14 Who appointed you to be the mask police?
1312356357295792129 2020-10-03 19:38:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DeborahMeaden If you stepped out of your echo chamber once in a while, maybe your reality would alter, plus, I for one am bored of engaging with bleating remainers who are still regurgitating the same arguments (all of which were proven to be nonsense) pre, during &amp; post referendum.
1312102110532575235 2020-10-03 02:48:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MayorofLondon That pesky racist COVID eh? How dare it single out black people.   What a silly little man you are.
1312037947236024320 2020-10-02 22:33:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CAnt70 @SiobhanBenita She could have infected anyone on those trains and Cummings didn’t set the rules- that was the SAGE committee and he was seeking childcare.
1311952929058893824 2020-10-02 16:55:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @2tweetaboutit @foxyjeepster Why are these sick individuals spared jail time and time again? Our judicial system is a bloody joke.
1311943310441951232 2020-10-02 16:17:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Speedy recovery Mr President and FLOTUS.
1311901733405294593 2020-10-02 13:32:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @codeofvets I could easily take them all out in one swoop...and I’m female! 😀
1311900577421500417 2020-10-02 13:27:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SiobhanBenita Bit of a difference between travelling on public transport knowing you are infected, to travelling in a private car wouldn’t you say? I suggest you sit down.
1311871587424120836 2020-10-02 11:32:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JulieFranklinB2 Bye Argos. 👋
1311871361980215302 2020-10-02 11:31:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SimonJonesNews Can we make this a regular thing? They are doing a better job than the Home Office.
1311870805370900485 2020-10-02 11:29:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NicolaSturgeon @Ianblackford_MP The hypocrisy of Blackford. He didn’t follow the rules either. Both should go.
1311738777862316034 2020-10-02 02:44:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @WalesPolitics They can sod off back from whence they came then. They were not invited here and arrived by boat, illegally. What do they expect? To be put up at the Ritz indefinitely? FGS.
1311737314176049154 2020-10-02 02:38:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry STILL whining about Brexit. God, what a bore.
1311711458586251264 2020-10-02 00:55:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @chapman020 @MRHUMBUG3 Thanks for the heads up. I’ll make sure not to tune in accidentally.
1311632992364879872 2020-10-01 19:44:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RenweardPress I did yesterday. Had to go and have a lie down.
1311559556124860416 2020-10-01 14:52:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @mxchelle03 @Femi_Sorry And Femi doesn’t speak for me, hun.
1311335603359883265 2020-10-01 00:02:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HopkinsBRFC Yes, absolutely.
1311333298149433345 2020-09-30 23:53:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry Dear Britain,  Please get rid of Femi.  Love from thousands of British Citizens.
1311264618552098817 2020-09-30 19:20:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @alimarray1 Happy Anniversary! 🎊
1311249919127191552 2020-09-30 18:21:57 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NKrankie 🤮 There are far easier ways to satisfy oneself than that, surely. Don’t think I would ever be that desperate.
1311243557244669952 2020-09-30 17:56:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @afneil Well he is wearing a wire...
1311243142377680897 2020-09-30 17:55:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters How about “we ARE deporting those found guilty of grooming”? We need to see action, not words - they’re cheap.
1311233127747137536 2020-09-30 17:15:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @simon4124 @jaiz_23 I’ve started buying meat from a local butcher where they have affiliations with local farms who slaughter their own stock. It’s the only way forward and helps support British farms/economy.
1311231939299422208 2020-09-30 17:10:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JezLeathercraft @BBCNews I don’t need them thanks - we’ve left. You keep them to continue to mop up the tears you’ve been shedding for the last four years.
1311222396171546624 2020-09-30 16:32:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @OutragedMary @Mal_DuBois Shouldn't think there are any migrants left to inhabit it - they're all over here now in 4* hotels, aren't they?
1311217538433458177 2020-09-30 16:13:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCNews Every day until the transition is over, we will have to endure another round of negative news (or fearmongering part 36) as we did pre, during and post-referendum because remoaners will still not accept that we have left the EU.
1311215759352369152 2020-09-30 16:06:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @kelvmackenzie I'm Welsh living in England and haven't seen my Mum and family for over 8 months. The Welsh First Minister is an arse.
1311211761576673281 2020-09-30 15:50:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Maurice010101 I had to block him as he's such a big one. Couldn't stomach seeing his drivel on my timeline.
1311168487704985601 2020-09-30 12:58:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ukhomeoffice The arrivals far outweigh the returns, and as for you continuing to stop them coming - not doing a very good job are you? Why isn’t our Navy out there escorting them back to France and why when they do arrive, are they treated like kings? They should not be landed on British soil
1310976534983966720 2020-09-30 00:15:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @andreinawie @jdlflower And me. Every time I see his face I want to wipe the smug off it. He makes my stomach churn.
1310958871628914689 2020-09-29 23:05:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DanielJHannan If that is what the EU is saying, the opposite is true.
1310937411422228480 2020-09-29 21:40:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @chapman020 @REP57910897 The best way to check if you have Covid but are asymptomatic is to take your temperature. The body cannot fight any infection without a raise in temperature. The tests are a waste of time, money and effort.
1310936159678337027 2020-09-29 21:35:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SteveLaws19 Just sit in a dinghy - you'll be treated like Royalty.
1310923142127398913 2020-09-29 20:43:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson @WHO Yawn.
1310904515965726721 2020-09-29 19:29:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters Maybe if he hadn’t spent millions on vanity projects, he wouldn’t need a bail out. Time for him to leave. The man is an incompetent menace to our capital.
1310874870541094912 2020-09-29 17:31:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Kevin_Maguire Well if the accommodation is so dire, they are welcome to go back to where they came from or did they expect five-star treatment for entering the country by boat?
1310847717313327105 2020-09-29 15:43:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JohnnyTYKE EU warns, EU demands, EU orders. Jog on - we've heard it all before pre, during and following the referendum. We're not coming back so stop flogging the already dead, three times over, horse.
1310827070503768064 2020-09-29 14:21:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Stop_ForPeace1 If they were genuine refugees, I wouldn’t be calling them parasites. The fact that they are complaining about everything kind of proves my point.
1310815512633520136 2020-09-29 13:35:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DevonshireDanUK @liz_brown2020 Would a genuine "refugee" from a war-torn country complain that the food, Wifi and accommodation isn't good enough? I don't think so. Send the parasites back from whence they came.
1310572557658198017 2020-09-28 21:30:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry I’m right wing and not defensive in the slightest because there is nothing at all wrong with being right wing. How do you feel about being labelled left wing?
1310525246433353728 2020-09-28 18:22:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PatriotActive66 Then sod off back to France. No-one invited you here.
1310510744358748161 2020-09-28 17:24:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @zarahsultana Who should pay them then? Us, the taxpayer? Why should I?
1310509861382361088 2020-09-28 17:21:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @kikeypikey @haveigotnews Or even funny perhaps? Left-wing tripe masquerading as "comedy". Stopped watching a long time ago as it used to raise a titter, but now it's too politicised like everything else these days.
1310476605437939712 2020-09-28 15:09:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @2tweetaboutit @pritipatel @BorisJohnson Sod off back to Sudan then.
1310470615258796032 2020-09-28 14:45:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @FACT_Exeter @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings Laughable that you mention US negotiating in bad faith, while the EU didn’t start negotiations in good faith with their daily demands and orders. As for the “whip” you seem obsessed with, anyone would think it hadn’t been used in Parliament before and Johnson had invented it.
1310469540179054593 2020-09-28 14:41:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hettyb70 @FACT_Exeter @realsb4feelings If they didn’t need us more than we need them, why are they so reluctant to let us leave and continue to demand compromise after compromise including control over our judiciary? As a major contributor to their corrupt cabal, our leaving will damage the EU, and imo, irreparably.
1310248466094882816 2020-09-28 00:02:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @YvetteHenson Let’s hope it’s the start of a new trend.
1310248133021106176 2020-09-28 00:01:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @FACT_Exeter @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings And? The majority voted for it without the whip, so what’s your problem? It is in the UK’s interest or do you suggest we let the EU demand (and get) whatever they want?
1310246526183182337 2020-09-27 23:54:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @FACT_Exeter @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings He’s not “breaching” anything. It is perfectly legal to change a predecessors actions if they are not in the national interest, May’s WA was in the EU’s interest and most MP’s did not require the whip - just the last few remainers trying to upset the apple cart...again.
1310245471043158018 2020-09-27 23:50:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings WE voted to leave, not Johnson &amp; he is implementing our wishes &amp; there are no lies about the EU they really are as bad as any Eurosceptic says to which recent events attest. Whitty &amp; Valance are addressing the public re the virus or do you think they are doing it for show?
1310243334200451074 2020-09-27 23:42:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @FACT_Exeter @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings You are overlooking the fact that May’s WA as it stood kept us shackled to the EU which is not what we voted for.
1310229910640898048 2020-09-27 22:48:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @tradegovuk @jamieoliver Who the hell does Jaime Oliver think he is? He needs to get his head out of his own harris.
1310193260804091904 2020-09-27 20:23:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pastsellby @liz_brown2020 @MetPoliceEvents No, they are labels that the left likes to apply as a derogatory term to anyone who disagrees with them or if they haven’t got a real argument. If you were there, you would know there were no drunks, so I reiterate, you are a liar. 👋
1310191813664419840 2020-09-27 20:17:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @peterwalker99 @JamesfWells Did you miss the word “may” and it’s from the Guardian which isn’t known for truth or reliability.
1310186607287336960 2020-09-27 19:56:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jaycee1001 Let him continue to make an idiot of himself. I won’t be tuning in to see it.
1310185723086200835 2020-09-27 19:53:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pastsellby @liz_brown2020 @MetPoliceEvents Jingoistic and racist are names are they not? As it goes I was there and you are a liar - there were no “drunks”. This is just the usual leftie attempt at discrediting a legitimate peaceful protest, unlike BLM and XR. Now jog on. Bored with your childish nonsense.
1310172460768284675 2020-09-27 19:00:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @hettyb70 @realsb4feelings What would you have done differently with a pandemic but follow scientific advisors or would you not be complaining if he’d ignored them? As for Brexit, it wasn’t HIS choice, it was ours.
1310165279096426496 2020-09-27 18:31:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy What a bore-fest.
1310164380605177861 2020-09-27 18:28:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pastsellby @liz_brown2020 @MetPoliceEvents Leftie name-calling - how original but I guess that is all you have left. Our history is our history - it's not made up, good or bad and if you don't like it, why are you here and tell me, how do you know I wasn't there? Are you clairvoyant?
1310155592007397382 2020-09-27 17:53:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MimiJ9 I was there love and can assure you it was anything but terrible. It was a great time to be alive and if I had a time machine, that is where I would choose to return.
1310153860149846019 2020-09-27 17:46:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pastsellby @liz_brown2020 @MetPoliceEvents Were you there then? Did you personally witness drunk people or are you lying? Statues are most definitely NOT immaterial as they are part of our heritage &amp; the people who destroy them have no business being here. That includes as you have such little respect for our history.
1310143206340820992 2020-09-27 17:04:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @YorkshireCop @OwenJones84 He wouldn't last a minute on the front line before bawling for his Mummy.
1310142473411293185 2020-09-27 17:01:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry @afneil You're bleating into the ether despite him muting you and didn't even know who you were! 😂 Childish name-calling is all you and your ilk have got left. Everyone who disagrees with you is now "right-wing" 🙄
1310140295410057216 2020-09-27 16:52:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Lin_121 This woman's narcissism knows no bounds.
1310136237630590977 2020-09-27 16:36:34 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DPJHodges It's from the Guardian FGS.
1310135398782382080 2020-09-27 16:33:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @salaxxxxxxxx Because he is one.
1310134849135673344 2020-09-27 16:31:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy So what do you suggest the Govt do David?   I won't hold my breath for a response because like Starmer, you have no solutions or ideas, only criticism which is the easiest job in the world when in opposition for which you get paid handsomely even though you're useless.
1310133504018087936 2020-09-27 16:25:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pastsellby @liz_brown2020 @MetPoliceEvents There was a cross-section of people attending yesterday's march for your information and if you think our statues and history are immaterial, then you don't belong in Britain so why not choose another member state to go live in?
1310119189089341440 2020-09-27 15:28:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MetPoliceEvents And yet you stood by and allowed flag burnings, defacing and damage to our monuments during the BLM protests, and watched Extinction Rebellion as they glued themselves to buildings and blocked London roads causing gridlock. You have become a PC farce.
1310117095703748609 2020-09-27 15:20:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MissDomergue I can see you and you are still following me as I am you although your followers/following doesn’t reflect that. Twitter playing around with a lot of accounts recently I’ve noticed.
1310098776044994560 2020-09-27 14:07:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MetPoliceEvents Not a baton in sight from Police at the BLM and Extinction Rebellion protests when they were damaging property and monuments, but plenty of baton waving at a peaceful demonstration yesterday. Disgusted by the two tier policing blatantly being demonstrated.
1310097163414839296 2020-09-27 14:01:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @realsb4feelings What other PM has had to deal with both Brexit &amp; a pandemic? That said, there are major disappointments- illegal channel crossings &amp; of course the lockdowns which imo is down to his advisors &amp; as Boris is not a qualified immunologist, he has to follow their dubious advice.
1310094463868510209 2020-09-27 13:50:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pritipatel I don’t seem to recall you being so vocal about the “galling” BLM or Extinction Rebellion protests and the level of aggressive policing applied to yesterday’s protest. Two tier policing is “galling” as is your assistance of entry into OUR country by illegal migrants.
1310057209729110017 2020-09-27 11:22:33 +0800 <Deedy2201> @IainDale From the Guardian? I wouldn’t give it much credit.

1309726722674372608 2020-09-26 13:29:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Aldeanuk The feeling is mutual Harry. England doesn’t like you either.
1309720995331223552 2020-09-26 13:06:33 +0800 <Deedy2201> @themetskipper Bless his soul. Condolences to his family and friends.

1309709722073935874 2020-09-26 12:21:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @afneil @LeeAdey You are too good for the BBC Andrew and your departure will hasten their demise (hopefully). Look forward to seeing you on the new GB channel.
1309677687884197890 2020-09-26 10:14:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @mitsyarty @Lilies09 @Ann06957684 @pritipatel Is she still at it? 😂 Ignore Jo - don’t waste your time. These idiots are blind until something happens to them as a result of mass immigration. As for her calling me racist, I don’t care. They think they’re powerful using the word but it’s so diluted now it’s meaningless.
1309523794810281985 2020-09-26 00:02:57 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Berumster If he was white, we’d know his entire background by now, including his shoe size and tea or coffee preference.
1309495727983415296 2020-09-25 22:11:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @angelaeagle Aww, you still griping about a mug that was bought for our Chancellor as a gift?
1309488458365366277 2020-09-25 21:42:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Lilies09 @mitsyarty @Ann06957684 @pritipatel Oh and calling me racist is like water off a ducks, particularly as I didn’t mention race, so tell it to someone who gives a stuff.
1309488076146835457 2020-09-25 21:41:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Lilies09 @mitsyarty @Ann06957684 @pritipatel Why not assume it’s an illegal immigrant? Remember the new illegal arrival who stabbed seven staff in a Scottish hotel because the WiFi wasn’t up to scratch? The Romanian who raped a 12 yr old the very same day he arrived here? I’d put odds on it being an immigrant.
1309486415600848897 2020-09-25 21:34:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Lilies09 @Ann06957684 @pritipatel You mentioned race love, not me. Who is the racist again?

1308809985518981120 2020-09-24 00:46:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock With a 99.96% survival rate, “cases” don’t mean deaths or hospitalisation necessarily. Herd immunity and shielding of the vulnerable and elderly has to be the way forward. You cannot keep shutting the country down indefinitely, and the virus is here to stay.
1308808619698331648 2020-09-24 00:41:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RichardBurgon Please enlighten us oh wise one. How exactly will you “eliminate” the virus?
1308791430601682945 2020-09-23 23:32:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @bbclaurak And ignoring the grooming gangs. Forgot to mention that bit.
1308790972256595970 2020-09-23 23:30:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Keir_Starmer Once you’ve turned it into a 💩 hole by championing unfettered immigration? Good luck with that.

A free pass to everything essentially and we can see it in action on the tv. Black people now in every advert, tv programme &amp; it's forced by a "diversity" box ticking exercise &amp; not merit driven.

1306994226559946756 2020-09-19 00:31:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters They can shove it. After being told by David Lammy that they don’t need any “white saviours” they won’t miss my “white” donation. BLM are flush I hear. Give them a call.

Herd immunity is the only way forward or are we going to be in and out of lockdowns for the rest of our lives? The virus is not going to go away and neither is the damage to our economy if this continues.

1306866020569710592 2020-09-18 16:01:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BrexitBassist @Hoffers6 So Ofcom now decides that a record number of complaints are not worth an investigation because Ofcom doesn't agree with them so will therefore choose to ignore. What is the point of Ofcom then?

1306629700954062849 2020-09-18 00:22:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @queenmachine67 @Ofcom Don’t presume to tell me why I complained - it had sod all to do with Black Lives Matter but everything to do with it being on a family entertainment show and if black folk didn’t have equality, how come Diversity as a group, even exist in “racist” Britain?

1306622567336247301 2020-09-17 23:54:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KaneDeffley @Ofcom I complained because the dance was wholly inappropriate for family viewing and guess what? It didn’t scare me in the slightest or do you know me better than I know me along with the reasons of the other 20,000 + complainants?
1306617357465530370 2020-09-17 23:33:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KaneDeffley @Ofcom What a lorry load of tripe. No-one was “scared” of the performance- it does not belong on a family show.
1306616851598921732 2020-09-17 23:31:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ofcom One complaint from something a white person says that is considered offensive motivates you into action, but 24,000 complaints you happily ignore. Not fit for purpose.

I’m no conspiracy theorist, but even my instincts are telling me there is something very bad happening that we are yet to discover.

1306497644144009218 2020-09-17 15:38:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy @AngelaRayner Hilarious how you all try to big each other up (must admit I’ve not seen anyone big YOU up but hey, who would?) on Twitter &amp; paraphrase in an attempt to make it look like an original statement, when instead you’re all reading from the collective script. Rayner was crap.

1306458320283340801 2020-09-17 13:01:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Peston @BorisJohnson About time we started playing by EU’s rules. What’s good for the goose...Boris is defending the UK and working in its interests, unlike our last PM.   Wish all those slating him would sod off to another member state or shut the hell up.
1306455550234890240 2020-09-17 12:50:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @lisanandy Typical whiny Labour response to any problem, and of course, it’s always the fault of a Tory. I’m sure JRM broke the card readers deliberately and manipulated you into not social distancing or are you too thick to work that out all by yourself?
1306437269377691648 2020-09-17 11:38:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Holbornlolz This from the man who can empty a room for just standing up and who the hell would knowingly want to be close to him? Didn’t he also break lockdown rules? Hypocritical slug.

1306191178237435904 2020-09-16 19:20:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HHepplewhite She’s trying desperately to appear competent and relaxed with a silly smug grin on her face, thinking she’s coming across well, but I just find her cringeworthy every time she opens her mouth. Blackford’s up - time for volume down and coffee on.

1305817735453126656 2020-09-15 18:36:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @1222e506f5d748d @SkyNews @pritipatel Cry me a river. What children? I've seen about half a dozen arrive - the other 5000 are all fighting age men.
1305814817467400192 2020-09-15 18:24:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ricsid101 @SkyNews @pritipatel Please enlighten me as you know me so well.
1305813831281709057 2020-09-15 18:20:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RyanBessin @LauraMillssss @Lewisno1fan @SkyNews @pritipatel The race card. 💤 I couldn't care less about skin tone, more the fact that they are arriving undocumented, on our beaches on a daily basis. They are unknowns so any one of them could be a rapist or murderer or are they all doctors  &amp; if they are, why are they arriving by boat?
1305811520773910529 2020-09-15 18:11:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @laurast51362949 @Lewisno1fan @SkyNews @pritipatel How the hell do you know where they are coming from? The majority of them throw away their ID, so not even our Govt knows where they're from, but what we do know is they left a "safe" country to get here, so not "fleeing" anything.
1305810715744313344 2020-09-15 18:08:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PurestVideos @tinamanus Are you calling Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen countries "filth"? Shame, most of those coming ashore are not from those countries. Somalia and Eritrea are the favourites. Don't remember us going to war with them
1305809552626126848 2020-09-15 18:03:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SemiSustMan @EO2076 @SkyNews @pritipatel If they have been deported by the Government that means they have no legal right to be here.
1305809274120089600 2020-09-15 18:02:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ricsid101 @SkyNews @pritipatel I will thanks and you stay calm and relaxed in your naivety - until reality bites.
1305808741363843072 2020-09-15 18:00:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LauraMillssss @Lewisno1fan @SkyNews @pritipatel Jesus wept. Any more "ists" you'd like to deploy? What exactly is racist about wanting our borders protected from unknown invaders? I have just donated 17 bin bags of clothing to charity myself but don't expect to see these men arriving wearing last years blouse.
1305807684357283843 2020-09-15 17:56:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SemiSustMan @EO2076 @SkyNews @pritipatel Well it clearly is if they are being deported by our Government.
1305806728181800960 2020-09-15 17:52:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Lato792 @SkyNews @pritipatel Don't be daft - the left is good at one thing and one thing only - signalling of the virtue. It would be a very different story if one of their kids happened to be raped or murdered by one of these unknowns.
1305806353647230977 2020-09-15 17:51:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @R0bbo67 @SkyNews @pritipatel The Daily Fail is a lefty rag - why the hell would I want to read that tripe?
1305806135534981120 2020-09-15 17:50:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LauraMillssss @Lewisno1fan @SkyNews @pritipatel Oh just you then? That's your evidence? Plus, I doubt any of the young men arriving by the thousand would be interested in your dresses love.
1305805650769989632 2020-09-15 17:48:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SemiSustMan @EO2076 @SkyNews @pritipatel How do you know? Are you familiar with all these people personally?
1305803642788876288 2020-09-15 17:40:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SemiSustMan @EO2076 @SkyNews @pritipatel But it is illegal - if it was not, why are these people not taking the legal route and applying for British citizenship like everyone else who wants to come and live here, but instead arrive by dinghy and many run off once ashore? If it was legal, why are many being deported?
1305802982517284864 2020-09-15 17:37:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RyanBessin @LauraMillssss @Lewisno1fan @SkyNews @pritipatel How do you know they need help and have suffered tragedy? How do you know they are not rapists or criminals? You don't, and that is the point. They are coming from France and throwing their ID. Why would legitimate asylum seekers be doing that?
1305801632328880130 2020-09-15 17:32:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Maurice010101 @LikeGoinThisWay You can just imagine what he's thinking but can't say out loud can't you? 😂

1305799710800785408 2020-09-15 17:24:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @EO2076 @SemiSustMan @SkyNews @pritipatel Just the small point that they are entering our country by dinghy, illegally.
1305799362082148352 2020-09-15 17:23:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ricsid101 @SkyNews @pritipatel Tell it to someone who cares.
1305799206662287360 2020-09-15 17:22:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @tinamanus What "filth" country are "we" entering? I haven't entered any country pretending to be an asylum seeker and throwing my ID away so I can't be deported because ID would give the game away that I'm actually an illegal immigrant and not an asylum seeker at all.
1305791571267334144 2020-09-15 16:52:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @VeteranLittle @ConstantinStHe1 Good luck.

1305788122870018049 2020-09-15 16:38:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SemiSustMan @SkyNews @pritipatel What makes me better than them is that I am not a criminal entering a country illegally under the false pretence of being an asylum seeker from France, and if they are allowed to enter "legally" why are they arriving in dinghies and many being deported?

1305766455057801216 2020-09-15 15:12:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNews My neighbours have been non-compliant throughout this entire fiasco &amp; not once have I been remotely tempted to contact the Police, despite my dislike of them. I suggest @pritipatel prioritise by deporting the filth landing on our on shores daily, not encouraging people to snitch.
1305758083604533250 2020-09-15 14:39:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Carti_Mandua Have no idea. Left the room when he got up, had a shower, cup of cocoa, went to bed, up at 5.30am and he’s still there apparently.
1305754064756580352 2020-09-15 14:23:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock It would be good if the public could actually visit hospitals for treatments or to check on their sick relatives. With all the money that has been pumped into the NHS recently, what the hell are they doing with it as the NHS for all intents and purposes, appears to be closed.
1305752639972560896 2020-09-15 14:17:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid Notice you didn’t answer the question on Javid losing the whip but instead choose to name call. Typical response from a remainer. Regardless, it’s all academic as we won...again.
1305749765448257536 2020-09-15 14:06:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid 😂 That’s rich coming from someone with 69 follows and retweets Cadwalladr. Jog on little boy.

1305599661810552833 2020-09-15 04:09:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid No confusion here. If Javid votes against the Bill, I hope he loses his seat. My guess would be as you’re such a pedant, you’re a socialist remainer.   Just checked your timeline, I must be psychic.
1305598714598359042 2020-09-15 04:06:05 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid Can Javid lose the whip? If the answer is yes, then he is part of the Government - the Conservative Government, not Johnson’s Senior Cabinet/Ministers.

1305590858012655618 2020-09-15 03:34:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid First and foremost, I’m not your “mate” and have worked in the political sphere for over 20 years, so won’t be taking any lectures from you. The PM is not the Government, or does he run the country entirely on his own without a Party? That would be the Conservative Party.
1305589422692409344 2020-09-15 03:29:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ajayjagota I do hope so, maybe then she can cross the floor to her natural home with the Lib Dem’s.

1305585390846345217 2020-09-15 03:13:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid I think you are confusing Government with Cabinet- new “buzzword” to add to your list.
1305583742220632065 2020-09-15 03:06:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid Some education for you - the Conservatives are the Government and Javid is a member of the Conservatives, therefore he is part of the Government regardless of where he sits or his position in that Government.

1305575351452667909 2020-09-15 02:33:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidddCharles @sajidjavid If he is a member of the Conservative Party, then he is in our Government as the Conservatives are the Government.
1305544923819773958 2020-09-15 00:32:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @sajidjavid If you can’t work out why the Govt needs to take this measure, then you don’t belong in our Government and are supporting the EU’s blackmailing stance. Shame on you.
1305544298797166592 2020-09-15 00:29:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @joepike Suggest you watch the unedited version.

1305541982081765377 2020-09-15 00:20:38 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ghost_wales Most of Surrey is a pretty safe bet. We’re moving back to Gove’s constituency having spent a couple of years in John Redwood’s.
1305541435572269057 2020-09-15 00:18:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @stevec3457 I’d say she’s on a par with most of them in the detestable stakes. They are all pretty grim.
1305540795047518208 2020-09-15 00:15:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JeremyCordite The trick is to get in first and then imagine them crying all over their keyboard. Oh and if anyone blocks me, I immediately block them as you then take away the advantage they thought they had in the ability to still read your tweets after they’ve blocked you. 😀
1305526776551092230 2020-09-14 23:20:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Arron_banks @Jatol8817 He won’t be in the Conservatives for long as he’s just outed himself as not being one. Those who go against the UK electorate and the UK national interest ultimately end up in obscurity-ville.
1305524215815299074 2020-09-14 23:10:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @paulafr68963440 I’m not - it’s like Groundhog Day. Whenever the Govt takes action to benefit the UK, the Muppets are wheeled out to demonstrate their support for the EU and look how well it’s turned out for them in the past. It helps not hinders.
1305519479959453697 2020-09-14 22:51:14 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SmartBusSol @Keir_Starmer 😂 I look forward to PMQ’s with her spluttering all over the podium.
1305513973530402823 2020-09-14 22:29:21 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Rehman_Chishti No-one cares because until today, no-one knew you existed. 👋
1305488824122986499 2020-09-14 20:49:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @IWTheDarkPrince @BorisJohnson Even if Boris isn’t, the majority of the electorate are hoping he misses PMQ’s this week. Less chance of us being sent into a coma listening to his monotone drivel. Mind you, it’ll be hilarious to see what intellectual giant from Labour’s front bench stands in for him.
1305469743017721858 2020-09-14 19:33:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @garystreeterSWD Then you need to get out of our Government as you are not acting in the interests of the UK but instead are supporting the EU. Let’s hope you lose your seat as a result.
1305466322667606017 2020-09-14 19:20:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Black_Author The public (that he now calls racist) put him where he is today and can just as quickly send him into obscurity. Banjo has acquired an overactive ego that desperately needs to be popped. Like many celebs - he's gotten way too big for his plimsoles.
1305463227300679680 2020-09-14 19:07:42 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SkyNewsBreak Never heard of him and don't care anyway.

They just want what the white man has, regardless of talent or merit and they don't want to work for it either - just have it handed to them on a plate as they consider they are entitled to demand.
1305462035057201153 2020-09-14 19:02:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NKrankie If it ain't broke, why fix it? This is all about boxes being ticked because QoS is one of the few BBC programmes with an all-white panel and now they have to subject it to their diversity quota filling exercise. Another I won't be watching in future.
1305460129542934530 2020-09-14 18:55:23 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Mathew94379832 @JP46251093 @DPJHodges It's the Human Rights Laws that we are still bound by that allow the illegal immigrants to arrive here - something Boris is changing as I type and at least if they arrive here legally, some vetting has taken place.
1305447821592666112 2020-09-14 18:06:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @stevec3457 Oh God. They've wheeled him out now have they? That's the lot now isn't it? Miller, Blair, Major, Cameron, Hammond, Grieve - same old suspects when it actually looks like the UK may be close to achieving a deal that benefits the UK, up all these traitors pop to bat for the EU.
1305444242811215873 2020-09-14 17:52:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCBreakfast Remainer Cameron? What a shocker...not.

Telling people not to tune in because they disagree with the agenda they push highlights the state of the MSM today thinking they can force people into submission. The opposite is true most are turning off.
1305438444139798528 2020-09-14 17:29:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MissDomergue There is only one "hit" on there and it's "I'm in the Mood for Dancing" which they have dined out on for years. Haven't heard ANY of the others.

A free pass basically. If they are happy to do a job based on a quota filling exercise, then they are going to be disappointed when they are not revered by the public, which they won't be.
1305434098580828160 2020-09-14 17:11:57 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Antipolluters @scomipbanhalal9 I bet the figure is much higher and now for Banjo to come out and call a lot of the people who put him where he is today, racists will further damage the show. Like a lot of other "woke" programmes, it is dead to me now.
1305404038796713985 2020-09-14 15:12:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Desdemo05194742 @Klein17172024 @Will_Radley Oh yes, that awful laugh - ugh. Look at me criticising her laugh - does that make me racist?
1305403148408938497 2020-09-14 15:08:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AlexIden2 @DailyMirror @AshleyBanjo You know when they use the word racist, they are moving to victimhood as a means to shut down conversation. That is how it works. White people can be mercilessly criticised, but everyone else is entitled to be above criticism, according to them of course.
1305401519592943616 2020-09-14 15:02:30 +0800 <Deedy2201> @theorphanmoon68 Khan - dangerous.
1305397053481267200 2020-09-14 14:44:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DPJHodges What absolute nonsense. The majority of us voted to leave the EU with no mention of a deal being part of the process. Remainers and Europhiles were the ones bleating that we had to leave with a deal and didn’t Cameron say that if we didn’t have a deal, we’d leave on WTO?
1305384816653864961 2020-09-14 13:56:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CatharineHoey @Mick62 Labour are not in a position to “demand” anything. Quite frankly, sick of the EU demanding or ordering on a daily basis without MPs from our own Parliament following suit. Support Britain or get out of our Parliament.

It’s one of the very few programmes on the BBC that hasn’t been subjected to the diversity box ticking exercise. As a result, viewing figures will inevitably drop. Can’t wait for this organisation to disappear up its own harris.

They can offer their opinions like everyone else, but they have no influence whatsoever, despite their vast egos telling them otherwise. @BorisJohnson Ignore these two traitorous relics and push on.

Perfectly well is the answer.
1305116082710155264 2020-09-13 20:08:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NickBoles Isn’t it interesting that as soon as it becomes apparent that the Govt will actually implement what the British public voted for, the usual whining suspects come out of the woodwork to slate them. We’ve had Miller, Brown, Blair, Grieve, Hammond &amp; now you. Failed state my harris.

1305079984805933056 2020-09-13 17:44:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Aldeanuk The sooner the better. These laws protect the perpetrators of crime, not the victims of it.

1305056144659017728 2020-09-13 16:10:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry You can tell that Boris is on the right track when the remoaners come out in force with smears intended to undermine our PM because the EU is having another tantrum because they are not going to get their own way. It didn’t work pre, during and post referendum &amp; it won’t work now
1305055096603115525 2020-09-13 16:05:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BoerboelUK Is it too much of a coincidence that the BBC have also decided to ditch Question of Sport presenters in favour of a more “diverse” panel at exactly the same time? Let them pander to the 5% minority while the rest of us switch off or invest in un woke DVD’s to watch instead.
1305054089588465664 2020-09-13 16:01:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @brown12008 He’d be an absolutely brilliant PM.

TBH, the majority of “diverse” actors I’ve seen that have recently been introduced (with the exception of a few) are awful and clearly shows that they are not there on merit.
1305044295561469952 2020-09-13 15:23:01 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Hells4Heroes My Mum had one that used to go walk about around the kitchen when it was on spin!

Following their interference the last time the EU had a tantrum, Boris got an 80 seat majority. Just another two traitors to this country on the EU payroll. Boris is on target.

Khan is grossly incompetent and is destroying our Capital. You’re on a par, if not worse, than Corbyn and that’s saying something.

I didn't - you did and my criticism is of Khan trying to turn Britain into anything but British.

Sweden had safety measures in place, no lockdown &amp; very few deaths, other than those with underlying conditions or elderly. The virus isn’t going anywhere and we can’t live in and out of lockdowns indefinitely.

Hubby and I had short lived weird symptoms and coughs in February. Lockdown is overkill - should have take the herd immunity/shield the vulnerable route.
1304677338903449600 2020-09-12 15:04:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @_EnglishRose_13 It is! Really unexpected though and a little bit creepy! 😀

1304666073657159680 2020-09-12 14:20:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @free_speech_jak @JOHjohJOH12 @LozzaFox I already know it’s happening, I don’t need to sit through a sick film to prove it. I read about child sex abuse almost daily in the news. I appreciate what you are saying though, but producing something so unnecessarily gratuitous is just giving the pervs exactly what they want.
1304661987406811136 2020-09-12 14:03:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @IanKop1 @CarrieOnFilms Was unfortunate to see Linekar at a Wentworth Pro Am a few years back. All the other “celebs” were lovely, having photos taken with the crowds and chatting not Juggy though. He clearly felt he was above everyone else and came across just as he does now - an arrogant arse.
1304658820728262661 2020-09-12 13:51:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LozzaFox Sorry, seeing a few clips here was more than enough to sicken me. I don’t care about “the message” allegedly contained in the film, it’s child porn and beyond disturbing.

1304489100867760129 2020-09-12 02:36:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry What a complete imbecile you are.

I did not say I didn’t like you, or anyone else that lives in London, but Khan is trying to erase British history by replacing it with everyone else’s and that is not acceptable to indigenous Brits.

1304461058170654721 2020-09-12 00:45:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @debatenothate2 Notice the subtle change from COVID to Coronavirus? The common cold is a coronavirus so is the flu and what appears in Autumn? Colds and Flu. This is about more than a virus.
1304459370797895680 2020-09-12 00:38:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Ricky_K67 We can’t possibly have BAME portrayed as being criminals - they are all saints didn’t you know? All BAME crime is brushed under a very big carpet, soon to be visible from space.
1304458070676983808 2020-09-12 00:33:34 +0800 <Deedy2201> @andjusticef_all @PhilDurling100 @MayorofLondon I beg to differ. You’re Turkish.
1304450852787228672 2020-09-12 00:04:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HroyOf @BGT I watched the last series, and Sky linked the new series, so it was recorded automatically. After reading about Diversity’s BLM tribute to a serial criminal, I just deleted, removed the series link and won’t be watching any future shows.

1304449220347387904 2020-09-11 23:58:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @naughttynoo @Ma1r3ad Same here. I held his hand until his last breath. My heart broke that day and has never recovered.

1304437327335432194 2020-09-11 23:11:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @nicryan6 @trussliz So what? We have our own deal and have cut out the middle man. Worried Brexit will succeed eh? Sad sap.
1304436621916475393 2020-09-11 23:08:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @davesherwood87 @Really20202 @nicryan6 @HHepplewhite @trussliz It’s good for this country. I fail to see how getting a good deal for Britain and being grateful to the person negotiating it, is brown nosing or are you a remainer hoping Brexit would fail?
1304435682161684482 2020-09-11 23:04:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @nicryan6 @HHepplewhite @trussliz @Really20202 Please enlighten us as to why she isn’t doing a job job for Britain.

1304427189891457024 2020-09-11 22:30:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pritipatel Maybe consider arming our officers? This would be the only deterrent to the scumbags that have clearly been emboldened to think assaulting our Police is acceptable. Sorting out the handwringing judges who hand down pathetic sentences would also help.
1304422895163191298 2020-09-11 22:13:47 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JuanckersGhost With a £90 billion trade surplus with us, they are not in a position TO punish us, hence the hysterical squealing.

1304367439623397376 2020-09-11 18:33:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GermanAmbUK We’re not accepting the EU’s attempts to keep controlling us as a sovereign country following our transition. In other words, they no longer get to order us around and force us to abide by their rules. Thanks for your input though.

1304345297674547200 2020-09-11 17:05:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @jjcwow Running a £90 billion trade surplus with us, plus Covid the EU is not in any position to be "brutal" with us or anyone else. They thought they had us exactly where they wanted us and have been masterfully outmanoeuvred. Expect the tantrums in the coming days to be on steroids.
1304343829965942785 2020-09-11 16:59:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MarcCorbishley My Nan wore one, complete with Caramac stains!

Good luck Vodafone. If I had been your customer yesterday, I wouldn't be today that's for sure.

1304317936006561792 2020-09-11 15:16:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GiftCee @guyverhofstadt Because he knew they couldn't be manipulated and roll over like May.

Soon every programme they make will be unwatchable because of diversity quotas which is insulting for the actors who know they are not there on merit but for a box-ticking exercise.
1304117297464971270 2020-09-11 01:59:27 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AlexIden2 No ta. I’d rather watch paint dry.

1303998114899128321 2020-09-10 18:05:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @OfficeGSBrown Oh do jog on has been. No-one other than the desperate remoaners is remotely interested in anything you utter. Sell out.
1303997195193135104 2020-09-10 18:02:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @carolecadwalla Correction. We've LEFT the EU and despite all your investigations and accusations, no illegality took place. Accept the electorate vote, stop bleating or go live under another member state flag.
1303969892471894016 2020-09-10 16:13:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LozzaFox Reading those messages, it's no great loss to you Laurence. With "friends" like that who needs enemies? The comment about "letting THEM have a slogan" is disgusting. There is no "them and us" we ALL matter.

1303936539576107010 2020-09-10 14:01:11 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Bella___Trixxx And here comes the victimhood - bang on cue.
1303936225095680002 2020-09-10 13:59:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @chapman020 There is a bigger picture that we are not aware of yet - there must be as the measures being taken are well in excess of what is required. I’m just waiting for the truth to be leaked or the penny to drop.

1303708385490198529 2020-09-09 22:54:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @guyverhofstadt Do jog on Guy. We know you've been expecting a re-run of the May cabal, bowing, scraping &amp; bootlicking, but you're up against a majority Government now. Suck it up, stop trying to "cherry-pick" and act in the "good faith" that was promised. If not WTO it is.
1303679617778233345 2020-09-09 21:00:16 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JeremyCordite Jesus wept. Lammy is enough to turn anyone's radio off for good.   Thank God for @talkRADIO

Anyway, you stick to sorting out your own country and leave us to sort out ours.

A clause (38) is already contained in the WA allowing our Government to take the decision they have made. Maybe it's you who doesn't "understand" eh?
1303604936077344769 2020-09-09 16:03:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CatyMoonlight @Dai111 @pm1491 @RedPandaBand1t @BBCPolitics @Iromg @Nigel_Farage @brexitparty_uk A lot of countries operate under WTO rules and by us moving to WTO should focus the minds of the EU into taking a more realistic approach to negotiations and how dare you suggest that people who voted to leave the declining trade bloc "don't understand".

1303538614224261121 2020-09-09 11:39:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @politicalite So he thinks HE speaks for the British public does he? He’d best prepare for a rude awakening. The silent majority have a knack of putting these egomaniacs back in their boxes. He doesn’t speak for me and anything he appears on in future will be a avoided.
1303535494270267393 2020-09-09 11:27:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy Do you ever tweet about white people other than to criticise them? Why do you continually talk about race? It doesn’t matter what colour a person is, if they are breaking the law, they should be arrested. Try taking your race glasses off once in a while FGS.
1303530282667126784 2020-09-09 11:06:52 +0800 <Deedy2201> @bbclaurak Why, because Boris is acting in the UK interest not the EU’s las we saw with May? They need to resign and get out of our Parliament then.

1303378980322652160 2020-09-09 01:05:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @guyverhofstadt But it’s ok for the EU to renege on a promise to act in good faith? Of course, only the EU can break rules when it suits. I hope we leave on WTO and the EU implodes very soon thereafter.

1303346987279036417 2020-09-08 22:58:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MayorofLondon Who says? You? Jog on. We’ve seen enough of your gross incompetence and the mess you’ve made of London. Brexit has sod all to do with you.
1303345684242927616 2020-09-08 22:53:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @sophieblack2016 @BrexitHome Wish she’d take up residence over there. Duplicitous mare.
1303344608714334208 2020-09-08 22:49:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BrexitHome Still showing her dedication to the EU and demonstrating again how she was prepared to sell Britain out. Thank God she was ousted. She does not belong in our Government.
1303337488333840387 2020-09-08 22:20:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics And we always wanted complete autonomy. Why on earth would there be an issue with lorry drivers?
1303336946564042755 2020-09-08 22:18:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics Still waiting for your comments on state aid, ECJ control or the level playing field perhaps? Nothing to say because it doesn’t fit your narrative?
1303336015495602177 2020-09-08 22:14:55 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics The plus is for a Canada style deal, not additions to it and remembering we run a £90 billion trade deficit with the EU, what are we looking for over and above the Canada deal? Last I heard we were happy with a bare bones FTA but the EU wants a level playing field.
1303327691815481345 2020-09-08 21:41:51 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics Enlighten me. What more are we asking for over and above a Canada+ deal.
1303327410130124801 2020-09-08 21:40:43 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics The EU promised us a Canada + deal but have now reneged on it by adding unrealistic caveats, and what Independent country would allow the EU to continue to control it when it has left it’s club?
1303326455573688325 2020-09-08 21:36:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics We are an island - we do not “share” a border. Access to the single market isn’t an issue &amp; benefits both EU and UK. Why would the EU have a problem with security co-operation if it’s not looking to punish us for daring to leave? Still waiting for your comment re ECJ &amp; state aid.
1303324298980057089 2020-09-08 21:28:22 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AndyEastAnglia Absolutely not. I voted on the premise that it would be a WTO exit. Only remainer windbags like Femidom take issue with it as it has been their go to fear tool, perpetrated by the EU as they will not benefit at all from a no deal exit.
1303322519198478340 2020-09-08 21:21:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics You clearly need the point spelling out don’t you? There were no conditions attached to the Canadian &amp; Japanese deals was the point. Anything to say about state aid interference and the ECJ?
1303320513301950465 2020-09-08 21:13:19 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JMPSimor We had one in December. Didn’t you get the memo?
1303318979235196929 2020-09-08 21:07:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics You’re right - we are given quotas by the EU on how much fish we can catch in our own waters. They don’t like the fact that now we’re taking our waters back, we’re the ones who will be handing out the quotas.
1303318420793024514 2020-09-08 21:05:00 +0800 <Deedy2201> @diamondbacknl @BBCPolitics What? The WA was signed by both Parties, the EU and the UK, only the EU are now trying to attach conditions to an FTA.
1303317949449674753 2020-09-08 21:03:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @raymondinho2 @BBCPolitics So did the EU but they are not living up to their promise to act in good faith.
1303317636684673025 2020-09-08 21:01:53 +0800 <Deedy2201> @CaraPac46808618 @BBCPolitics You seem to think the EU owns us and has the right to make demands - they don’t.
1303317177517453313 2020-09-08 21:00:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @HertfordLibDems @BBCPolitics The fishing grounds are not “shared” they belong to Britain.
1303311243055423488 2020-09-08 20:36:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KingHarold1 I cancelled my contributions when I discovered they were using donations to buy burkinis for muslim girls in Africa whilst cutting jobs in the UK.
1303309892405559296 2020-09-08 20:31:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BBCPolitics The same could be asked of the EU. Have they attached conditions like, unfettered access to fishing waters, interference in state aid and ECJ control with the Canadian and Japanese trade deals? That would be a no, so why does the EU think it can do so with the UK?
1303281591200948226 2020-09-08 18:38:39 +0800 <Deedy2201> @SebastianEPayne Good news. Another remoaner bites the dust.
1303281126186909696 2020-09-08 18:36:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Femi_Sorry You had to watch something to arrive at that conclusion? We’ve known, and could have told you that, years ago.
1303280457954533377 2020-09-08 18:34:09 +0800 <Deedy2201> @acgrayling Insider knowledge eh? Poor sad sap.

1303278012847337472 2020-09-08 18:24:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Peston WE are not jeopardising an FTA - that would be the EU with their ridiculous demands that they have unfettered access to our fish, get a say in state aid and continue with ECJ control. Did they put these conditions on deals with Canada, Japan etc? That'd be a no.
1303267454202806272 2020-09-08 17:42:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @tedxlondon @n1kk1m Only women are women and no amount of misspelling and feet stamping is going to change that biological fact.

1303195147618971648 2020-09-08 12:55:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @vonderleyen We trust the EU will give us what was promised in the WA by acting in good faith. Oh, you’ve breached your own agreement by not acting in good faith. If you can breach the agreement, so can we.

She is not sick but has learned from her father who has also not worked for over 40 years, how to work the system. She along with the rest of her family are scroungers.

1302911425522827265 2020-09-07 18:07:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AndrewEQuinn @DPJHodges What do you think the ECJ does? We HAVE LEFT THE EU which is why we can negotiate our own trade deals. Of course there have been changes - we've left or did you (like the EU) expect everything to carry on as it has for the last 40 years?
1302908796029874176 2020-09-07 17:57:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MikeKatehar941 @JuliaHB1 @johndmtb My cousin has four kids, has never worked (perpetually on the "sick") hubby has now become her "carer", so neither parent contributes, yet they have everything. Both smoke, huge TV, huge swimming pool in their back garden, council house paid for and benefits galore. Makes me 🤮
1302907245655502848 2020-09-07 17:51:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @xeccar 😪 RIP little one.
1302906657891024897 2020-09-07 17:48:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AndrewEQuinn @DPJHodges The WD first &amp; foremost is not an international treaty. It was agreed by our last Government &amp; does not bind successive Governments. The reason we can make trade deals is because we have left the EU. The EU wants us to remain controlled by ECJ &amp; wants access to our fish &amp; waters.
1302891679167512576 2020-09-07 16:49:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @naughttynoo We now need to reverse it and adopt a mass repatriation programme to get these people out of our country.

1302888544604741632 2020-09-07 16:36:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BrettEverest Just look at the joy and wonder on that beautiful little face. Really cheered me up!
1302887771229556737 2020-09-07 16:33:45 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pritipatel @WMPolice Get these people out of our country and stop more setting foot on British soil. ENOUGH.
1302886925469126656 2020-09-07 16:30:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AndrewEQuinn @DPJHodges I worked for an MEP in Brussels for four years, so know EXACTLY what is going on thanks whereas you clearly haven't got a scooby. The EU wants no change to its governance over us post-transition and has undermined this country for over 40 years
1302884294315122688 2020-09-07 16:19:56 +0800 <Deedy2201> @NikkiStix55 They cannot continue with these ridiculous excuses. They must think we're all stupid out here. The filth they are allowing into this country are coming here for one reason, and one reason only and it certainly isn't to spread love among the population.
1302878882182430721 2020-09-07 15:58:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @AndrewEQuinn @DPJHodges So it's ok for the EU to renege by not acting in good faith during negotiations but bad for the UK to do the same? We chose to leave their corrupt club, so they don't get to "cherry pick" or demand what they want.

1302262584859676672 2020-09-05 23:09:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @UKPLC3 @BorisJohnson How many large gatherings have taken place since May? No spikes &amp; no second waves, plus we’ve been told this virus enters through the mouth, nose, eyes &amp; to avoid touching these areas. If you have worn a mask, you don’t stop fiddling with it touching those areas more than normal.

1302223306108567552 2020-09-05 20:33:24 +0800 <Deedy2201> @EdwardJDavey So someone holds an opinion that differs from yours, so you slap derogatory labels on him. What shall we label Moran for battering her husband? Aggressive misandrist? People in glass houses...
1302191442727776263 2020-09-05 18:26:48 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KayBurley Why would he want to discuss it with you after you’ve spent the last two days sticking labels like misogynist and homophobe on him? I really don’t know who the hell you think you are.
1302183186718511104 2020-09-05 17:53:59 +0800 <Deedy2201> @pritipatel So do something about it. Saying something is unacceptable achieves nothing. Arrest them. The Police were quick enough to arrest a bloke on a train for not wearing a bloody mask.

The Japan/UK agreement is imminent- still a hell of a difference between 6 weeks and 10 years wouldn’t you say?  See what can happen when leaving a slow draconian trade bloc? Benefit number 3 I believe.

1301937681711144961 2020-09-05 01:38:26 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BethRigby Great news. One in the eye for bruiser Burley.
1301936900920532993 2020-09-05 01:35:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @WonderToothless @Wade73605662 @acgrayling I worked in Brussels for an MEP for four years and saw up close and personal the corruption and damage it inflicts on member states. Good enough or are you upset that you’ve been denied the chance to whip out the race card?
1301936117252591616 2020-09-05 01:32:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MikePearce17 @krow68 @flashcorbyn @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling If it isn’t a dictatorship, why are we unable to independently determine on state aid? And you have got to be having a laugh on trade if you think the EU &amp; it’s “collective weight” is beneficial - it’s average time to reach a trade agreement is 10 years FGS. UK/Japan - six weeks.
1301923527378055168 2020-09-05 00:42:12 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MikePearce17 @krow68 @flashcorbyn @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling What part of my answer are you not getting? Will we be a self governing nation again &amp; not micromanaged by a foreign dictatorship at the end of transition or not? Will we not be able to set our own trade policy or are you just going to ignore the answer as per?
1301920936099278848 2020-09-05 00:31:54 +0800 <Deedy2201> @krow68 @flashcorbyn @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling More of a bore. Been answering the same questions for over four years. Getting beyond tiresome now.
1301920313656201217 2020-09-05 00:29:25 +0800 <Deedy2201> @flashcorbyn @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling Is it? You’re the one still here whining and we’ve already left.   I have already given two reasons - self governing nation, not micromanaged by a foreign dictatorship and I’ll throw in another - the ability to set our own trade policy and trade deals.
1301919031549665284 2020-09-05 00:24:20 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Roelandpaul @lord_edwards @DavidGHFrost @RuthLeaEcon @sff_uk @NFFO_UK Europe has 450 million vs the World of 7.5 billion. Think I’ll go with the world.
1301918725164142593 2020-09-05 00:23:07 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Roelandpaul @lord_edwards @DavidGHFrost @RuthLeaEcon @sff_uk @NFFO_UK So where will you buy your fish?
1301916893612310538 2020-09-05 00:15:50 +0800 <Deedy2201> @flashcorbyn @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling Oh dear, you may have to fill in a form. I’m whipping out my tiny violin as I type.
1301916624136613889 2020-09-05 00:14:46 +0800 <Deedy2201> @flashcorbyn @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling No, you can travel to Europe, freely, right now unless of course COVID raises its ugly head again. My neighbours have just returned from Spain, with no issues at all, and they voted Leave.
1301915208026329093 2020-09-05 00:09:08 +0800 <Deedy2201> @flashcorbyn @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling You are still free to travel to Europe.
1301915041277583366 2020-09-05 00:08:28 +0800 <Deedy2201> @krow68 @flashcorbyn @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling They still can’t accept they lost. They keep asking the same question over &amp; over - they bore the liver out of me. The first benefit is being a self governing nation again &amp; not being micromanaged by a foreign dictatorship. The other benefits will swiftly become apparent once out
1301913691034652673 2020-09-05 00:03:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Yumblat @BarryNL @BinnieGlen @acgrayling We’re also in the middle of a pandemic, so not all to do with Brexit, although Europhiles like you would blame the weather on Brexit.
1301913223713755137 2020-09-05 00:01:15 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Yumblat @BarryNL @BinnieGlen @acgrayling Many businesses have also returned &amp; stayed put despite remainers gloating over a couple leaving. Where do you shop? I haven’t noticed any change in supermarket prices &amp; investment is steadily rising plus some member states are even setting up shop here.
1301910056540295181 2020-09-04 23:48:40 +0800 <Deedy2201> @flashcorbyn @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling What evidence? Do enlighten me.
1301909150776074243 2020-09-04 23:45:04 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MattHancock Thank God I grew up in a different era where I was allowed to be a child. Now our kids are having LGBT stuffed down their throats like we are having minority rights and pc tripe shoved down ours.
1301905600834686976 2020-09-04 23:30:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Wade73605662 @acgrayling What exactly is racist about leaving a trade bloc and I doubt the EU will still be in existence in five years time.
1301905279261577220 2020-09-04 23:29:41 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BarryNL @acgrayling Can’t wait.
1301905228107841537 2020-09-04 23:29:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BarryNL @BinnieGlen @acgrayling Like all the scaremongering pre, during and post the referendum you mean? All the stuff remainers said that never came to fruition, in fact, the opposite was true? How you will cope when GB thrives and the EU implodes next year I don’t know. Best get your safe space organised.
1301904176746823680 2020-09-04 23:25:18 +0800 <Deedy2201> @krow68 @PeterMayneMusic @acgrayling Clairvoyant too by all accounts.
1301903890242244610 2020-09-04 23:24:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @acgrayling No,we don’t. Get the hell over it or move to another member state.
1301810052291080193 2020-09-04 17:11:17 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KayBurley She's like a dog (literally) with a bone over Abbott isn't she? He must be putting the wind up the lefties if they are trying to assassinate his character every day.
1301809376429211649 2020-09-04 17:08:36 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BevGill41858391 @Melissa5857 @KayBurley And not many like her, despite what her ego tells her!
1301557964470353921 2020-09-04 00:29:35 +0800 <Deedy2201> @RESCUE_UK @GaryLineker @yasminkadimusic Oh just eff off Juggy. If you find everything “British” so abhorrent, go live somewhere else.
1301524253976690694 2020-09-03 22:15:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @LozzaFox I hugged my daughter, who doesn’t live with me, just last week when we met up for lunch and I’ll hug my friend when I meet her for lunch next week. You will not dictate who I can hug or micromanage my life any longer under the pretence of a virus less deadly than the flu. Jog on.
1301522518021410818 2020-09-03 22:08:44 +0800 <Deedy2201> @gary_robertson @PollyIce2 @Will_Radley Always ugly, no matter how much work she has done. Ugly comes from the inside.
1301518113557622785 2020-09-03 21:51:13 +0800 <Deedy2201> @DavidLammy @GaryLineker They are not refugees.
1301463097283170304 2020-09-03 18:12:37 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson Forget the virus nonsense. Open up the country and sort out the dinghy invasion.
1301462450634731523 2020-09-03 18:10:02 +0800 <Deedy2201> @GaryLineker @RESCUE_UK I’d have more respect if you offered to house one of the many homeless veterans we have living on the streets, but no, that wouldn’t fit with your virtue signalling narrative. You make me 🤮 You’d rather house an illegal immigrant than someone who fought for this country.
1301458440007618560 2020-09-03 17:54:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @KayBurley @MattHancock Just because the man holds a different opinion to you, doesn’t mean he is misogynistic or homophobic. The left do love to slap a derogatory label on people who disagree with them don’t they?   Kay Burley is an aggressive throat grabbing misandrist. Two can play that game.
1301425148017496065 2020-09-03 15:41:49 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Crosscolin88 @startrekcbs @ianaIexander @glaad Loved Star Trek, but now I'm out.
1301406364221222912 2020-09-03 14:27:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 Return them from whence they came. All fighting age men - now why would that be? It doesn’t take a genius to work out what is going on here.
1301182225539530754 2020-09-02 23:36:32 +0800 <Deedy2201> @MartinDaubney Leave them up there. Stupid idiots.
1301144082950086656 2020-09-02 21:04:58 +0800 <Deedy2201> @BorisJohnson Open the country up Boris. No more silly masks or social distancing and put an end to furlough.
1301121989336272897 2020-09-02 19:37:10 +0800 <Deedy2201> @rachaelvenables @LBC Glad to see they are being arrested but if there is any more trouble, I know where I can lay my hands on a steam roller. These people are a pain in the harris.
1300841991400497154 2020-09-02 01:04:33 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PippaCrerar Oh grow up FGS.
1300823003891200001 2020-09-01 23:49:06 +0800 <Deedy2201> @Piers_Corbyn @AndrewBellFran1 Wrong Corbyn, Hilary.
1300820328650805248 2020-09-01 23:38:29 +0800 <Deedy2201> @JeremyVineOn5 Absolutely.
1300667967169007616 2020-09-01 13:33:03 +0800 <Deedy2201> @PoliticsPollss What “far right” groups would those be? The only “groups” damaging this country are far left, the rest are just ordinary patriotic people worried for their kids and grandkids with all the unknown illegal immigrants being allowed to roam free among us.
1300663051172163584 2020-09-01 13:13:31 +0800 <Deedy2201> @ThatTimWalker YOU are profoundly disturbing if you think balance is so abhorrent.
