1333856572011917315 2020-12-02 03:32:43 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Well then tell God Damned Trump to SHUT UP already.
1333780330793275394 2020-12-01 22:29:45 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> I'd call him a hero &amp; a rare GOP lawmaker with a backbone &amp; loyalty to the Country.
1333778021573124096 2020-12-01 22:20:35 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> What needs to change in America is the law about truth vs lies, recognizing honesty &amp; severely penalizing people, networks, &amp; others who mass market proven lies.
1333777208771489792 2020-12-01 22:17:21 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> @realDonaldTrump No, you LOST MICHIGAN - and everywhere else - by a lot.  Fool. You are making yourself &amp; the GOP look more stupid every day.

1333773946949406721 2020-12-01 22:04:23 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Why anyone would want to associate, do business with, stay at, work for, build or represent ANY Trump family brand is beyond me.
1333773337626112001 2020-12-01 22:01:58 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Knowing tRUMP he'll probably try to resurect Nazi horror camp Dr. Mengele instead of someone actually competent.
1333770811325501440 2020-12-01 21:51:56 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Amazing. How powerful nature/ the universe is.
1333623322668625920 2020-12-01 12:05:52 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> ATLAS was a Titan god who held the sky aloft in greek mythology. In the White House, ATLAS was Trump's puppet goon who bore his covid LIES aloft. If only Perseus would now appear from the fables with Medusa's head &amp; turn ATLAS to stone, like he did to thousands dying from Covid.

1303010201482788866 2020-09-08 00:40:15 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> I like to think they say that since, under Trump, they've lost it already &amp; want to defend Biden against any other assholes out there.
1303009299300519936 2020-09-08 00:36:40 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Nice! HB girl from Florida!
1303009169671368705 2020-09-08 00:36:09 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Nope.  VOTE BLUE WHATEVER YOU DO.  EVICT SATANS DISCIPLE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.  BIDEN- HARRIS 2020!
1303008875709435904 2020-09-08 00:34:59 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Maybe he had to fart. Again.

1303005743910707200 2020-09-08 00:22:32 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Only one, &amp; it's a failure: the GOP.
1302380600989495296 2020-09-06 06:58:26 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> And, Satan sends his disciples to further his evil work....
1302379377917911042 2020-09-06 06:53:35 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> We all do &amp; hope for the same thing. One wonders why the government agencies around Trump stand for his fucking crap.
1302378757777432576 2020-09-06 06:51:07 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> VOTE BLUE 2020 ANYWAY &amp; TELL ALL YOU KNOW TO DO THE SAME.  Put an auto-reply on your email.  Say 'vote blue's in your voicemail message.  Put Vote Blue on your Facebook &amp; Instagram pages. Write to friends, post signs, talk to people about HOW WRONG Trump is for our Country. @AP
1302378072608514048 2020-09-06 06:48:24 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Everything sinks where Trump is involved.  Including the USA.  VOTE BLUE ACROSS THE BOARD 2020!
1302377386911170560 2020-09-06 06:45:40 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Been getting flu shots every year since 1990s.  Never once had flu again.
1302376623619084296 2020-09-06 06:42:38 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Now it's time for ALL OF US LOSERS &amp; SUCKERS to stand up &amp; FIRE TRUMP. #TrumpHatesOurVeterans #TrumpIsALoser #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlue #militarymen #DumpTrump2020 #ElectionInfection @AP @cnnbrk @thehill @NPR @nytimes @washingtonpost @DNC @JoeBiden @TeamPelosi @NYGovCuomo

1302373392843235329 2020-09-06 06:29:48 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> And all of r honorable active &amp; veteran military should take a stand now, as the entire USA - whatever party - should as well. Force Trump out NOW...don't wait for November. @HASCDemocrats @USNavy @USArmy @USMC @uscoastguard @usairforce @SpaceForceDoD @JoeBiden @AP @DNC @thehill
1302371715012591618 2020-09-06 06:23:08 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> What the hell?  Are you demented?
1302371136358023169 2020-09-06 06:20:50 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> Absolutely!  Thank you Mary, I read your book &amp; if everyone also read it, there would be such an outcry for Donnie's removal it would drown out all his + the GOP chafe we're suffering from.  VOTE BLUE, VOTE BIDEN, VOTE FOR OUR COUNTRY EVERYONE! @cnnbrk @AP @DNC @JoeBiden @MSNBC
1302370120048807938 2020-09-06 06:16:48 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> And if all our great military are losers per Trump, what does that make him as a "bone spur" draft dodger with a fake, failed 'education?' @JoeBiden @MaryLTrump @SenSchumer @DNC @CNN @MSNBC_Breaking @cnnbrk @nprpolitics @AP @nytimes @TeamPelosi @RepAdamSchiff @MeghanMcCain @BBC
1302368944066621440 2020-09-06 06:12:07 +0800 <Capitolhilhairy> He's not pity-eorthy, he's just damn disgusting &amp; NO ONE should support him anymore.
