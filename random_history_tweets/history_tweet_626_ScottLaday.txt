1335765912063008777 2020-12-07 09:59:45 +0800 <ScottLaday> @ajc Trump supporters care more about what happens to Trump than their well-being. Hate is a powerful drug
1335422788094582784 2020-12-06 11:16:18 +0800 <ScottLaday> @CNNPolitics It's not clouded. He was a willing participant. His was fired too.
1335422544640348162 2020-12-06 11:15:20 +0800 <ScottLaday> @taxesr4thepoor @Joanna_Resists I'm sure Rudy knew about the videos before he hired her to put on the show at the hearing. " I'm going to make you a star".
1335421727120257025 2020-12-06 11:12:05 +0800 <ScottLaday> @seanhannity Over 8 million believe Trump has increased the Racial Tension in this country and fired him on November 3!
1335421224470671361 2020-12-06 11:10:05 +0800 <ScottLaday> @11AliveNews Good. And the folks at Trump's Tent Revival (valdosta) should be fined as well.
1335420859616464897 2020-12-06 11:08:38 +0800 <ScottLaday> @RevDrBarber Where you able to watch any of Trump's tent revival in Valdosta Georgia? From my understanding he passed a collection plate.
1335420514723098625 2020-12-06 11:07:16 +0800 <ScottLaday> @SelfImposedXile I'm from the south and back home we call Trump's so called rally a tent revival.
1335419963268616192 2020-12-06 11:05:04 +0800 <ScottLaday> @RandyRainbow @tootame It reminds me of tent revivals in the country. People would run to hear the traveling pastor. He would take their money and tell them they were healed. They weren't healed and he would disappear in the middle of the night with their rent and light bill money.
1335419022981148673 2020-12-06 11:01:20 +0800 <ScottLaday> @IyanlaVanzant You must first be able to identify the curse. People don't know what spirits have been passed on from generation to generation because family members are good at sweeping things under the family tree.

1335409558806802432 2020-12-06 10:23:44 +0800 <ScottLaday> @Entr_py @realDonaldTrump Not lying. He is pocketing your coins as we speak. Trump knows damn well he's not going to win and the money he's raising is going in his pockets. Do you think he would hire #RudyGiuliani  to defend him in a criminal case? Nope. He hire the best darn lawyers available.
1335409027447185410 2020-12-06 10:21:37 +0800 <ScottLaday> @thehill And he is robbing them of their Christmas and personal funds.

1326268385613783042 2020-11-11 04:59:58 +0800 <ScottLaday> @mjmoser711 @AOC I think we should play hardball with the GOP. We have to learn to work together inside the dem party. A house divided can't stand.

It also appears there is tension between Gail and her co anchor (white male with glasses). He comes off insensitive to issues that are important to minority communities.

White on White crime is just as high but you only focus on black and brown murders.
