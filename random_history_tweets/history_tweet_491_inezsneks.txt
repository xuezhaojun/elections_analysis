His love of his brother, his humor, his connections with women. Dean is an incredibly complex character. And Jensen is the soul. No one else could have made Dean, Dean.

The problem is that if you are a w2 wage earner it is automatically taken from your check. And later, down the road, the IRS will not give 2 fucks as to why you did not pay, if you have the ability to stop. &amp; you will pay penalties and interest.Guaranteed!

The 1% must pay their fair share. And the military receives way too much $. And white supremacy must be a thing of the past. And no one will tell me what I can do with my body.

That term has been chewed up and spit out years ago. The KOCHS have made it hardcore libertarian. Right wing white supremacist NAZI. If you do the research you will see.

1338863186980687873 2020-12-15 23:07:13 +0800 <inezsneks> @RonGOPVet4Biden The #TraitorTrump gvmt &amp; the astroturfing Koch consortium told them it was perfectly fine to politicize masks &amp; wreck the CDC. And @KristiNoem, THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH DAKOTA, thought it was great to have Sturgis happen. 250k superspreaders across the US. So yeah, it was them.

Same with the Destials. Love for a family member can be the same for a friend when you think of the friend as a family member. U know, one of the main themes

1336347432859340802 2020-12-09 00:30:30 +0800 <inezsneks> @JuddLegum I usually fully agree with you. But in this scenario I actually want someone who the military respect and understand. Plus he is black and I think it is high time. Unless you can point to something he has personally done which would disqualify him, I'm on board.
1336345947740237832 2020-12-09 00:24:36 +0800 <inezsneks> @x_lenc Makes you wonder how the people who sent out that email are qualified to work at a school like Berkeley. This is actually when you need to speak to the manager😡😡

If they are claiming fraud, it is because they themselves were engaged in fraud. Texas, Kentucky,  Dem governor in KY, but reelected #MoscowMitchMcTraitor ? I don't think so 😡😡

I just hated so much of it and was so disappointed. It pisses me off that Amy just ignored the 7th season, because it wasn't hers. Logan would never be working for his dad &amp; marrying some girl

All of the right wing white supremacist NAZI oligarchs, including the Mercers, the Devos, the Walton family. Once you understand where it is coming from, it can be fought.

The story is not about Dean &amp; Cas, it is about Sam &amp; Dean. Sure Cas was important, but the show would have survived without him. I missed Crowley more.

1334685999318900739 2020-12-04 10:28:34 +0800 <inezsneks> @SuperWiki IMO the fans who ship don't really get the show.They are just about Cas/Misha and nothing else, &amp; obsess over Dean, &amp; ignore Sam. To the extent that it seems like he doesn't even exist, despite being number one on the call sheet. And that pisses me off. The bros are the 💙 of spn

1334682648569110529 2020-12-04 10:15:15 +0800 <inezsneks> @SuperWiki It was the most fitting ending for the show. I personally loved it. It made me cry for days. The grief, and how Sam dealt with it, was spot on. Dean and Sam together in the barn was the best scene they have ever done together. Life is not fair, it is hard &amp; painful &amp; bittersweet.

Christianity is a brutal religion built on lies and insanity &amp; control. Control of anyone who was not at the head of the church.

As the American population began to become more diverse and darker, the white supremacists in the GOP ramped up the hatred. And the KOCH CONSORTIUM destruction of the gvmt became more prominent and open.

And it is antithetical  to proper governing and justice and fairness in society. Because when you privatize &amp; monetize important gvt functions, we all lose. Ex. Prisons, education etc.

1332557156248399873 2020-11-28 13:29:18 +0800 <inezsneks> @CNN @DennisCardiff I'll give you one guess. Did you say the GOP?  Ding, ding, ding. And it is illegal to do this in Florida. People have gone to jail for it in the past. Maybe you can actually investigate some?

1332438540504936448 2020-11-28 05:37:58 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ Well when some of the actors, Misha, encourages the crazy Destials, what do you expect. The show used to make fun of it, and apparently no one recognized that. Then the actors used to make jokes about it, and the fans thought it was real. Destial only existed in fantasy land.🙄🙄

1332339083507617794 2020-11-27 23:02:45 +0800 <inezsneks> @SuperWiki @mishacollins does not need to do anything. He should live his life in peace. Anyone who claims to love him would not be shitting on him. That is what MAGAts do. It is no different. If you love Misha, stop harassing him. If you have nothing nice to say... everyone knows the rest.
1332337375259873280 2020-11-27 22:55:58 +0800 <inezsneks> @Dknight10k #theResistance has never been about being losers. It's about resisting the injustice of America! We may be in a better position, but we are by no means "the empire." If we had all of Congress by a huge margin, then I might agree. As long as the KOCH CONSORTIUM exists, we #Resist.

1330640225027170304 2020-11-23 06:32:06 +0800 <inezsneks> @StephenKing A Stephen King book or short story is always a perfectly fully formed idea. It's fulfilling and the ending is always satisfying. Many times happy, I might add, which makes the reader😊. He has been a favorite author since I read Carrie and Pet Semetary in high school. A true icon

This particular group of Hasids grew out of the Holocaust and their main goal is to repopulate the world with jews, but only who think like them. See Unorthodox on Netflix for a small look into the group. They are a cult. Truly.

Thank goodness they were chosen to play these iconic characters. 15 years of love, family, sacrifice, pain, laughter, friends, redemption, hunting and salvation. And a heart wrenching tragic ending that honored the through story of the show.😪😍
1330352309277220864 2020-11-22 11:28:01 +0800 <inezsneks> @TVGuide @therealKripke @JensenAckles @TheBoysTV I really like Hughie and Annie. I would love to see them end up together. Which means they probably won't. But I am hoping that the show will have the one bright spot of their relationship. Plenty of other pain to happen. Can't wait to see @JensenAckles as Soldier Boy.
1330348227913256960 2020-11-22 11:11:48 +0800 <inezsneks> @kayb625 @JensenAckles @jarpad @FangasmSPN I loved this episode. I thought it was a fitting end. It would have been great to have everyone else on the show who should have been there, but it just couldn't happen. And it would have been nice if they began the episode with the words 1 year later. But otherwise, I wept😭😭
1330343008202612740 2020-11-22 10:51:04 +0800 <inezsneks> @shillman1 Too much humidity in the summer. Too many transients. Too many drugs. To many crazy people. Too many Rethuglicans.

1330284048523141124 2020-11-22 06:56:47 +0800 <inezsneks> @LilyBelle05 @nypmetro They do not give a shit about anyone who is not a member of their cult. Sound familiar?
1330281553751105538 2020-11-22 06:46:52 +0800 <inezsneks> @Mokiness099 It was slightly less painful the 2nd time because you know what is coming. It is just when I begin thinking about the whole story over 15 years that I start being emotional. It is an epic and tragic story, and I love it even more. And I feel sad for those people who are unhappy.
1330279537712787456 2020-11-22 06:38:51 +0800 <inezsneks> @SuperWiki YES! This episode brought the loss in my life to the absolute forefront. The walking into the room of someone you love and knowing they are not returning. The leaving the place you call home because you can't anymore. And the plea to continue to go on, when you can't 😭😭.  https://t.co/qetodidcRS

It also puts the entire show into a truly tragic and epic arc, and everytime I think about it, I 😭😭😭  https://t.co/OWnSRLXWAH

Yes it is tragic. I would have liked something different. But it was the way it was always going to end 😭😭😭

1330171074345136130 2020-11-21 23:27:52 +0800 <inezsneks> @RepRoKhanna Not every American needs it. Only send to the ones who do. Those of us who are working and not having financial difficulties do not need the money. Much prefer lower taxes for those under 400K. So no need to send $ if one does not need it.
1330170246163009538 2020-11-21 23:24:34 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @superinspired67 The worst are the desperate shippers. The Destials who completely ignore Sam/Jared. Like he doesn't exist. Dean only ever told 2 people in his life that he loved them, his mother and his brother. He may have loved Cas as a brother, but not more, just a best friend.
1330169092079292425 2020-11-21 23:19:59 +0800 <inezsneks> @superinspired67 In my mind they are not real fans. They are trolls and obnoxious ones at that. I loved the finale. But I haven't loved this last season. I didn't like the choice of God as the big bad. But in the end I am happy with the way they wrapped everything up. We need to show 💙 &amp; not 😡
1330009884398678017 2020-11-21 12:47:21 +0800 <inezsneks> @Wayward_Lily I just feel like there will be scenes where I will now cry my eyes out knowing what is waiting at the end of the road. Especially the ones where they are children.
1330007110285996033 2020-11-21 12:36:20 +0800 <inezsneks> @mbaram I highly encourage all those MAGATS who want to boycott the Georgia senator races to absolutelydo so!!

It would have been richer and fuller had everyone they wanted to bring back been there, but it was a stripped down version that made an incredible emotional impact on me. Family, love, sacrifice, pain and peace.😍😍  https://t.co/CFhyXspo38

1329932490874757120 2020-11-21 07:39:49 +0800 <inezsneks> @StabGigi I see Sam and Dean, and I also see Jensen and Jared confirming that this was the right time to finish the show.😭😭😭😍😍😍
1329931837259587585 2020-11-21 07:37:13 +0800 <inezsneks> @kyledcheney It doesn't really matter if this is what did or did not happen. All that matters is that they put this out in writing making their position very clear.
1329929085661876226 2020-11-21 07:26:17 +0800 <inezsneks> @elliemaea Yes and it was great😍😍😍
1329927154235273217 2020-11-21 07:18:37 +0800 <inezsneks> @elliemaea That will be any day you watch it😭😭😭
1329925618004353026 2020-11-21 07:12:30 +0800 <inezsneks> @StabGigi Absolutely 😍😍😍. Sam was more than his beloved younger brother, he was like Dean's son. Dean only ever told 2 people he loved them, his mother and Sam. Dean knew he could not go on, but he also knew Sam would. And that meant everything. 😭😭😭
1329923999615381504 2020-11-21 07:06:04 +0800 <inezsneks> @lovejenneel The emotion generated between Sam and Dean in the barn scene should have been enough to let you know that he was ok with it. Probably way more than ok. It is some of their finest work.  https://t.co/WO8dX4baqR
1329922883372642305 2020-11-21 07:01:38 +0800 <inezsneks> @Spencaborg @jarpad You really treated him like a son would a father. And this fan appreciated that!!❤❤😍😍😪😪
1329921645859966976 2020-11-21 06:56:43 +0800 <inezsneks> All of this is 100% accurate and true. The amount of commitment by the whole team, especially Jared &amp; Jensen being in every single episode in mind boggling. I loved the finale, it spoke to my emotional core and generated  much😭😭. I love this show with all my heart.💙💙
1329915910807834624 2020-11-21 06:33:56 +0800 <inezsneks> @TheJimMichaels @cw_spn The last funny scene of the show!😂😪😪😪 So much 😭😭😭😭.
1329910380974518272 2020-11-21 06:11:58 +0800 <inezsneks> @elliemaea Just them for so long. It's always been them and their relationship. Everything else was extra. And I feel bad if other fans don't see that. But this was the ending that the show always spoke about. And the scene where Dean is dying is the scene for J2 saying goodbye to the show.
1329908264105078784 2020-11-21 06:03:33 +0800 <inezsneks> @elliemaea I too cried for a ridiculously long time. I just watched again, and I am an emotional wreck. So much of it resonated so deeply with me. Sam was both his beloved younger brother, and also like his son. Dean only said I love you to 2 people, his mom &amp; brother. And it was always
1329904907219038208 2020-11-21 05:50:12 +0800 <inezsneks> @jnitti10 @Dknight10k Yep. He was always a fat person, and he takes huge offense at comments regarding weight.
1329890865213534213 2020-11-21 04:54:25 +0800 <inezsneks> @Dknight10k I made fun of #TraitorTrump being fat when I first joined Twitter. Walter Shaub, took such offense that he blocked me, even though I was a nobody. Not trying to rain on your parade because she is a fat fuck, but it is emulating the traitor in the WH. I do hate that fat fuck too🤮
1329865035028574220 2020-11-21 03:11:46 +0800 <inezsneks> @guynormanbee 😊😊😍
1329861543215964161 2020-11-21 02:57:54 +0800 <inezsneks> @guynormanbee I must say that I loved it because it really resonated in an emotional space for me. I know many people complained, but I really felt it. Many 😭😭😭
1329860232923779073 2020-11-21 02:52:41 +0800 <inezsneks> @guynormanbee In other traumatic news, do you watch Supernatural, and did you watch last night's finale?

1329816247761051648 2020-11-20 23:57:54 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas I cried so much😭. I am still ready to cry at the drop of a Winchester moment. It's an emotional storm. The show, the virus, the insanity with #TraitorTrump, my 32nd wedding anniversary, my older daughter melting down because the world sucks, &amp; the toxicity &amp; attraction of Twitr

1329785004440870914 2020-11-20 21:53:45 +0800 <inezsneks> @Pathryn34 Ridiculously emotionally painful 😭😭😭😭
1329782142155493381 2020-11-20 21:42:23 +0800 <inezsneks> @shillman1 Another piece of evidence showing that religion is not what makes one a good person. In fact, generally quite the opposite. 🤔🤔
1329781801825542144 2020-11-20 21:41:02 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ I completely agree. It started with Sam and Dean and has always been about them. Their relationship was the linchpin for the show. As well as IRL. All else was side dishes. They were always the main course. Their love and devotion to each other was epic. A road well traveled😭❤
1329773180588843010 2020-11-20 21:06:46 +0800 <inezsneks> @j2loveeachother I agree and that is why I can't listen to one more whiny bitch about Cas.

1329771847991353345 2020-11-20 21:01:29 +0800 <inezsneks> @MitchKosterman I loved it. It hit every emotional note for me. I literally couldn't stop crying because all of Sam's pain and grief resonated with me. His entering Dean's room, his turning off the lights, his missing his brother always.  Family, love, sacrifice, and peace.  https://t.co/jxjXDhoDr7

And is was always about peace when they were done. Jensen and Jared were stellar and real. And I am sad, and that is the way I should be. Family, love, sacrifice, pain and peace.  https://t.co/YJTkxZJmSF
1329731741842542592 2020-11-20 18:22:07 +0800 <inezsneks> @jumblejim I loved it. It hit so many emotional notes in my life. It was always Sam and Dean...beginning to end. Their incredible devotion to each other. This was always how it was always going to end. A road that never really ends, and a final peace. Thank you for creating this masterpiece

1329657218166362113 2020-11-20 13:25:59 +0800 <inezsneks> @SuperWiki Yes. And that is why it resonates so intensely with me. It helps process the grief I have had over the years. The walking into the room of someone you love who has died, the leaving the home you shared, the peace at the end. The love shared, even when you had trouble saying it.😭

And frankly, I don't really give a fuck about those who are whining or hated it. It hit every emotional note for me. Of course Dean dies in the most ordinary of ways. And Sam has the life Dean always hoped for him. I'm good w/it  https://t.co/dpB6NRpwf7

So he is bi only for him? I see that there is love. But I do not see the romantic relationship love that other people wish was there. IMO they just want to see them having sex

1327055073097211910 2020-11-13 09:05:59 +0800 <inezsneks> @lsangel2 Yes, I have read your analysis. I really connected with what you have said. I love that this show lends itself to the kind of sophisticated analysis one would think would not be available. Ultimately it's sue to the magic that is (usually) created by all involved in  each episode
1327026912628256769 2020-11-13 07:14:05 +0800 <inezsneks> @guynormanbee Love it when the ranters have the best words!!

The best way to achieve your goal is to DISMANTLE the KOCH CONSORTIUM and the rest of the mega rich oligarchs. That is the only way we will see true freedom from this evil. Tax them, remove Citizens United, &amp; clamp down on lobbying!

Does he love Dean? Well sure, why not. But I have just never seen it as a gay relationship. He loves Dean because Dean has brought him to the brink of humanity.

And it is way too dangerous to convene a constitutional convention. Because if the Kochs get into that our democracy will be destroyed.

1324947229195563009 2020-11-07 13:30:10 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ Exactly!! I am frankly sick of shippers. They are like trumpers. If you don't agree with them, they attack. I HAVE NEVER once thought that Dean and Cas were "in love." Cas is his best friend. Dean is straight. Get over it. And the writers and cast make FUN of it. Not in support😡

1324555679286386690 2020-11-06 11:34:17 +0800 <inezsneks> @Dknight10k Ah yup!! Very astute. I agree with this message.

1323645294131765250 2020-11-03 23:16:44 +0800 <inezsneks> @wnybuffalodad Hey I get it. The Nazi swastika was an old Asian symbol that had a beautiful meaning. But I wouldn't go with it now. I was just wondering if you were aware. Because sometimes people are not. I saw your feed. I see how you roll.
1323644710724972552 2020-11-03 23:14:25 +0800 <inezsneks> @jerseymouse @selectedwisdom He never thought she was underage because she was a reporter. Only the audience knows that she is supposed to be 15. But he definitely thought he was going to bang her.
1323643704029155328 2020-11-03 23:10:25 +0800 <inezsneks> @wnybuffalodad Did you know that the picture you use as a profile pick is a white supremacist meme? The frog is a white supremacist figure. Your feed does not seem to follow that way.
1323640815214858243 2020-11-03 22:58:57 +0800 <inezsneks> @gregolear Great piece.The only thing you have overlooked is the KOCH CONSORTIUM.

I remember thinking how wonderful and remarkable it was when Obama was elected and inaugurated, that Bush was there shaking his hand and turning everything over. I really thought we had it all.

And because we must change the racist, white supremacist narrative in this country if we have any hope of being here in the future. And if we do not begin to lead the world on climate change, we are all doomed!

1322032941694885889 2020-10-30 12:29:50 +0800 <inezsneks> @JackBear62 Try doing something really boring. That usually makes me fall asleep. Like reading a book you don't really like. Or mucking around on here😂😂
1322019409599303681 2020-10-30 11:36:03 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas And I know they wanted to bring Rachel back and so they made her the Empty. I don't really think it works. Not my favorite. Otherwise I actually liked the episode. The Sam and Dean scene was spot on. #SUPERNATURAL

1321188022667403271 2020-10-28 04:32:25 +0800 <inezsneks> @glennkirschner2 I used to think that. I do not believe that is true any longer. I can only hope that a statistically significant % of Republicans voting, are actually voting blue, especially those who have voted early. I no longer have any faith in the Roberts' court. It will go down in infamy.

It says something about holding the office during good behavior, but not the words lifetime. That is how it has previously been interpreted.

1319730153950531586 2020-10-24 03:59:22 +0800 <inezsneks> @guynormanbee I am a huge proponent of free speech. But even in a society that values and revers free speech, the classic you cannot yell fire in a movie theater restriction still applies. I feel it is absolutely necessary to stop political speech that is just a mountain of lies &amp; deceit.

And also his knowing that he had been lying, again, to Sam. There have been some really stellar kids playing young Sam and Dean. Sadly, while I liked the kids, these were not them.

1319297985470058496 2020-10-22 23:22:05 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas Well, we know the squeaky wheel...
1319296344465371136 2020-10-22 23:15:34 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas I def agree on free post secondary education, or trade school. I am in favor of 4 years. It will so pay off in the long run. I'm sorry you did not have the direction you needed to succeed in school. I also had no one to guide or help me, but somehow it worked out.
1319291508546138112 2020-10-22 22:56:21 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas It is a prejudice in our society. But because your dad was smart he self educated himself. Most people do not/can not/will not. Education, for me, is so important. It is a pathway, just not for everyone. But the lack of education in this country has been a real detriment.

1318579297028874241 2020-10-20 23:46:17 +0800 <inezsneks> @IAmJohnAles @LilHsPuddin IMO, Talent is nurtured and practiced. Read about the 10K hours needed to hone talent by Malcolm Gladwell. It will make sense. Also, people who achieve success in the arts have something else that is indefinable. A certain genuis that cannot really be pinpointed.

1315391611254321160 2020-10-12 04:39:33 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas Not only expensive. They offered a refund for NO. But I still wanted to go, so I left my money with them. Then after the refund time had passed, there were better seats available and I wanted to change my seat. They wouldn't let me. So remain loyal &amp; can't get the better seat😡😡

It's the writers making fun of the fans who promote it, and who cannot follow the show without it. And the actors know, and play it for laughs. If they were gay, great. But they are not, and Cas is just his best friend WHO HE LOVES LIKE A BROTHER

1315377328755822598 2020-10-12 03:42:48 +0800 <inezsneks> @JorCru It is an awesome show. The storytelling is primo, as is the acting. Jensen will just bring an added positive dimension. @therealKripke is a great showrunner and first rate storyteller. Hence the coherence of the story and the present actions making sense after seeing the past.

Why do people who are being abused stay in the abusive relationship, especially when they can leave. These are not people who cannot afford to leave. And people who came after they saw what was happening in the administration? T&amp;P

1313816858756354048 2020-10-07 20:22:03 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ I agree and I never cared about Maggie. There were so many stories that could have been closed out. IMO Jesse, the half demon boy. What an incredible storyline that could have been in juxtaposition to Jack. So much wasted opportunities.
1313816087151116288 2020-10-07 20:18:59 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Yep, it was some of the worst stuff. They made him so distasteful so that when Jack is killing him my reaction was to be super happy. &amp; why would Mary be unhappy or upset by it? Why is she yelling at Jack? A ridiculous plot line to have him kill her, &amp; be unable to bring her back
1313814976788918280 2020-10-07 20:14:34 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Oh yes!!! This bothers me the most. I love Gen Padalecki, but really??? What a stupid and ridiculous way to bring Ruby back🤮🤮
1313814487024185346 2020-10-07 20:12:37 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Well Mark wanted to be challenged as an actor. And they definitely had stopped doing that. It was sad. And I think Mark is a very strong personality and Dabb is not. And he just didn't want to be bothered. And Misha is a fan fav and that was just easier.
1313710974604640256 2020-10-07 13:21:18 +0800 <inezsneks> @INeveenBadr When you meet Jensen, just remember to not look directly into the brilliant sun that is his face.😍😍😍
1313709739726036993 2020-10-07 13:16:24 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas Yes I definitely liked the whole in his head part. I loved the episode in Dean's bar. Wasted opportunities 😪
1313709334896029696 2020-10-07 13:14:47 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas I mean can you imagine him meeting his father?
1313708559109173248 2020-10-07 13:11:42 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas Structure of the show for the season to accommodate for Michael in Dean. But noooo, they did stupid stuff.
1313707999228293127 2020-10-07 13:09:29 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas I think they could have done more with Crowley.  Mark is a very talented actor and there could have been more. I was really tired of Lucifer. I just couldn't stand him anymore. And I think they couldn't figure out how to send the boys off on hunts, instead of just changing the
1313706733878030336 2020-10-07 13:04:27 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas Why worry? If it is thoughtful and analytical, it is how you view it.
1313704700403949568 2020-10-07 12:56:22 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ That is so sweet. Makes them better men.😍😍
1313704376595296256 2020-10-07 12:55:05 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ I liked Robert Berens. He was always thoughtful and emotional. And he did want Wayward Sisters, which I think could have really succeeded. But Robbie will always be in my heart for Fan Fiction.
1313700828855795714 2020-10-07 12:40:59 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Oh absolutely. I can talk about it for hours on end🤣🤣😍😍

1313692203290710016 2020-10-07 12:06:43 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ @TheBoysTV Absolutely!!
1313691387288846336 2020-10-07 12:03:28 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Exactly. I was completely hooked the minute I watched them cry. And talk about really emotional issues. What other show has ever had young men on do that?? NONE. It is the heart and soul of the show.
1313690890704244743 2020-10-07 12:01:30 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas @TheBoysTV 😍😍😍😍
1313690633417232385 2020-10-07 12:00:28 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ I don't see it so much as him lying, as being sloppy and not caring about whether the storyline was one way before. With all of the detail on different show issues, there is no reason to screw up cannon. None whatsoever. Just lazy stupidity.
1313689951553323009 2020-10-07 11:57:46 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ It is so frustrating because I feel that we all could have done so much better. And while I do like most of the current writers, the top notch ones have been gone for a while. I also was extremely unhappy in how they ended Crowley. So damn disappointing.
1313687499064127488 2020-10-07 11:48:01 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ @bjxmas Exactly. When you go back and watch seasons 1-5, the pure genius of it is so apparent. I do love many other seasons and episodes. But nothing surpasses 1-5. And it is not a a once in a lifetime thing. Eric Kripke is a genius.  Have you watched @TheBoysTV yet?
1313686339473289216 2020-10-07 11:43:25 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ I definitely agree.
1313685582003023872 2020-10-07 11:40:24 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Writers tell stories. They challenge our imaginations. They shock and surprise us. They make us happy and sad and terrified. But they don't "lie." They tell stories.
1313685186031255553 2020-10-07 11:38:50 +0800 <inezsneks> @bjxmas @_downandirty_ Totally agree. The whole demon in Jack sucked. I did like Rowena sacrificing herself. She deserves to be the queen of hell. And IMO God as the big bad?? Based on how his character had been portrayed before?? Big no! &amp; I despised the line "God is a writer and writers lie." NO!!!
1313683691374284800 2020-10-07 11:32:53 +0800 <inezsneks> @GenMhayden And we love and support you for it 😍😍  https://t.co/j0vCk0UJN5
1313682897803583489 2020-10-07 11:29:44 +0800 <inezsneks> @_downandirty_ Yep I have been disappointed in season 15 to date. There are some bright spots, but I am just hoping that the last episodes actually do the show justice. It doesn't change how I feel about the show, I still love it. But Dabb...not my favorite show runner.

1313670144732934150 2020-10-07 10:39:03 +0800 <inezsneks> @IAmJohnAles Family are people you choose. My favorite show's through theme is "family don't end in blood." I also did not have much bio family growing up. I have a fairly small family now but a good number of people who are like family. But I also am lucky that there are no MAGAts aboard.

1312743724338876422 2020-10-04 21:17:48 +0800 <inezsneks> @IAmJohnAles Exactly. It must be behavior that qualifies them for prison. Embarrassing info can be downplayed &amp; ignored &amp; gone in a week. But other behavior, like treason, tax evasion, money laundering, and pedophilia and other white collar crime will get them sent to prison.

But it is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean and their relationship and their road trip. All else rounds out the show, but does not define it.😍

1312389397162135552 2020-10-03 21:49:49 +0800 <inezsneks> @ericgarland This has only become an issue now that #TraitorTrump has the virus. The fact that he has called it a hoax and people repeated it has NEVER HAD PUSHBACK BEFORE. The question is of course why are they gaslighting us now???

1311773871926902786 2020-10-02 05:03:57 +0800 <inezsneks> @AndBrazen File a report with the police. Ask that the kid be arrested for assault. You can also sue the school district for failing to keep your son safe and damage to him.

1311675717957095425 2020-10-01 22:33:55 +0800 <inezsneks> @mmpadellan Twits suspended my other account and would not give me any reason. Targeted harassment. 😡😡😡

1311148033501954050 2020-09-30 11:37:05 +0800 <inezsneks> @FoxNewsSunday Your questions were really good. Extremely well researched and perfectly factual. That is the good news. The bad news is that you could not control Trump. He was out of control and you were not in control. Which was too bad because your questions were really good.
1310619857633841156 2020-09-29 00:38:18 +0800 <inezsneks> @Goss30Goss The real question is who doesn't?? Only the poorest of the poor.
1310619393265750016 2020-09-29 00:36:28 +0800 <inezsneks> @donwinslow @VP He has probably also committed bank and tax fraud in Illinois. Remember they raided his accountant's offices there.

1310427966678204416 2020-09-28 11:55:48 +0800 <inezsneks> @IAmJohnAles We go to jail. The IRS are relentless.  It sickens me based on all the taxes we have paid over the past 20 years. It is imperative that we retake the Senate and the White House. Everything depends on it. I must say that this news made me feel much better today.

1310420983799578624 2020-09-28 11:28:03 +0800 <inezsneks> @MagicalPat @chrislhayes The 750 is a huge insult and a number that everyone can relate to especially when they compare it to their tax bill.
