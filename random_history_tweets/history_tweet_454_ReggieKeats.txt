1340052341580419072 2020-12-19 05:52:29 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Postmaster General Louis DeJoy - a political donor, NO POSTAL EXPERIENCE - implemented slow downs per his buddy trump to try to suppress voting by mail. Time to remove him and take back the USPService. We have an incredible postal service. An actual president will bring it back.

Maybe, he could consider NOT doing crazy treasonous deeds, or he may have to be indicted and jailed after the Secret Service carries him from the WH on Jan 20.

1339255357638496257 2020-12-17 01:05:34 +0800 <ReggieKeats> We opposed trump because he stood for trump only.  Given hundreds of chances to step up to the job, he failed, and every time when it was thought he couldn't go lower, he did. Nasty human being.  Good riddance!

Osteen's garage at his expansive mansion in the Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston "is said" to be filled with nice cars. More specifically, the site claimed that Osteen regularly drives a Ferrari.

1319100029299126272 2020-10-22 10:15:29 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Because of @realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP complicity, the U.S. will have to codify every rule, appointment, and behavior to ensure that we return to norms, traditions, and more fair behaviors that these self serving yahoos have trashed.  This includes SCOTUS candidates.

What is more important to you really, relief during these hards times or this?  @SenateGOP and #MoscowMitch do nothing.  What are YOUR priorities?  Are you working?  Paying your bills?  Who's working for you,?

1318312295848497157 2020-10-20 06:05:19 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @SenTedCruz @washingtonpost @seungminkim GOP to release a plan of any kind is a pipe dream.  10 years to release a healthcare plan--NADA. They turned the GOP tax giveaway mess to lobbyists to write just days before they rammed it through margin notes and all.   People you're smarter than these @SenateGOP clowns

Voters do you really think trump cares about you or our country, or only what he can grift? #VoteBidenHarris
1318210096237740033 2020-10-19 23:19:12 +0800 <ReggieKeats> More quid pro quo... Recently, the Republican [trump] said if he comes up short in the Hawkeye State, "I may never have to come back here again.... I'll never be back." He¬†used the same line¬†in Minnesota, Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina.   And you think trump cares about you?
1318200846375473154 2020-10-19 22:42:27 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @atrupar Who votes for these people? US Senator for Wisconsin. Seriously WI, you respect this guy?   #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica

Enough of this sideshow huckster whose MO is to grift taxpayers then skip out on the mess.  Remember voters, he doesn't care about you. #VoteBidenHarris

1317896984968065024 2020-10-19 02:35:01 +0800 <ReggieKeats> R McDaniel says that Biden is trying to "burn down the separation of powers".  Now that is funny.  "Trump had his FBI", the DOJ when he beckons, and signs so many imperial orders, whoops I mean exec orders, in total disregard of Congress, the legislative body. She's a joke.

1317498729415335937 2020-10-18 00:12:29 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @RVAT2020 @gtconway3d All the GOP really thinks this, but when it was critical to get this guy out of office, they did nothing.  Now, their seats are at risk.  TOO LITTLE TOO LATE!   We need term limits for both Congress and for supreme court.
1317497332284321792 2020-10-18 00:06:56 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @gelles This is a joke right?
1317453833350467585 2020-10-17 21:14:05 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MSNBC Let's see if Christie wears a mask the next time he visits the WH.
1317453345175392257 2020-10-17 21:12:09 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @funder I'd be happy if guiliani simply went back under a rock.  Americans are exhausted from this family of grifters and their hangers on.
1317286481933656064 2020-10-17 10:09:05 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Do not get complacent by what you are reading or hearing said about this election.  Your vote matters...we need our democracy back. VOTE!   Read all the instructions and double check your ballot.
1316794508151906304 2020-10-16 01:34:10 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @RaptisHelen Thank you for responding.  Really enjoy your show!
1316781666535309312 2020-10-16 00:43:08 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @RaptisHelen hi, I love your show and love how genuine it is.  Am I the first to comment on the cooking segments with women and long loose hair hanging over the food?  Today's 'Cookish' last week an Israeli cook.  Definitely dims the appeal of the food.
1316141552050163712 2020-10-14 06:19:33 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Definitely time to vote out do-nothing @HerreraBeutler  who we see only at election time.
1316141110964576256 2020-10-14 06:17:48 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @ibew48voc thank you for standing behind and supporting sane political leadership.  Much appreciated seeing it in the Reflector.
1316084576675012608 2020-10-14 02:33:09 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Excellent!!
1316009304743321604 2020-10-13 21:34:03 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Isn't it interesting that having SCOTUS hearings right now, during a national election, allows senators to get campaign snipes in.  Lots of learning from the administration playbook. Stellar guy @LindseyGrahamSC
1315666583776194565 2020-10-12 22:52:12 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Ugh, enough of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle...they retired from being royal, let them depart into anonymity.
1315666237943214080 2020-10-12 22:50:49 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MSNBC That this person will put everyone at risk because he has not followed CDC guidelines.  Why are these people allowed?  Voters, do you want this person coming to your work and speaking to your colleagues?  That's what he's doing in the Senate.
1315653810287603714 2020-10-12 22:01:26 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Maddow calls it:   "...a 'power grab without principle'...is there a coherent defense for launching a Supreme Court confirmation process right now?"   Why are these powermongers allowed to remain in office?   More behaviors that will have to be explicitly codified going forward
1315651788167499776 2020-10-12 21:53:24 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @realDonaldTrump djt continues to behave like a childish schoolyard bully with language that is an embarrassment across America and the world.  Voters, this person does not care about you at all.  Hopefully it won't be too late before you realize it.
1315650530526392322 2020-10-12 21:48:24 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @kylegriffin1 And a repeat question: why does the people's house get to be used for a partisan campaign rally?   America is going to have to codify everything that the reptile in the WH has abused and gotten away with.
1315448579478102016 2020-10-12 08:25:55 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @realDonaldTrump
1314684693598539776 2020-10-10 05:50:31 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MSNBC @NBCNews I thought holding campaign events at the White House was not allowed?
1314634562769625088 2020-10-10 02:31:19 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Vote dammit! Samuel Jackson--you're the best!  https://t.co/T8TrWNwcUa
1314619569357512705 2020-10-10 01:31:44 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @realDonaldTrump It's as if djt has turned Joe Biden into 'the powerful Oz'.
1314619144474488832 2020-10-10 01:30:03 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Go look at this guy's Twitter feed...tweets are becoming wilder and more frenetic.   Scary...
1314555205409669125 2020-10-09 21:15:58 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @politico First things first.  Let's get some normalcy back in the WH.  Outline all the work that needs to be done to rebuild our country that has been destroyed in the past four years--trashed or lack of policy, failed agreements, failed relationships, missing plans...  so much to repair.
1314552530009911297 2020-10-09 21:05:21 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @politico EVERYTHING this guy would do is always "quid pro quo" dependent.

1314204724418076672 2020-10-08 22:03:17 +0800 <ReggieKeats> The person in the WH is definitely not well.  Everyone knows this and fear and loathing in DC is rampant.  Trump swipes at Barr, Pompeo, Wray in return to Russia investigation, Clinton emails  https://t.co/gjGPVqnatr
1314049271579070464 2020-10-08 11:45:34 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Dchinni @MeetThePress Irony... Huge companies  sent everything from manufg. to customer support overseas to increase their profits. Now trump touts bringing everything back to USA, and blaming overseas producers when huge USA companies caused the problem in the first place. Sheesh.
1314047493177405440 2020-10-08 11:38:30 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @alroker @MeetThePress @VP I wanted Harris to touche a reference to K. Conway's 'alternative facts.'
1314043620857507840 2020-10-08 11:23:07 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MikePenceFly___ @ProjectLincoln It was on his head long enough to lay eggs.
1314037384518889473 2020-10-08 10:58:20 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Would have liked to hear more about RESPECT, toward each other, regaining it with the world and our allies, and climate accords--essential because we all live on the same planet.  It was alluded to--enough of childish name calling.
1314036184843124741 2020-10-08 10:53:34 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Everything we learn in school is we can't change the past.  trump  https://t.co/7H5oR6BlfZ. cannot not answer and/or address current questions because they childishly choose to go to the past.
1314035549246640128 2020-10-08 10:51:03 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Acosta That was awful...lie swatter ü¶üü¶ü

1313982942754955266 2020-10-08 07:22:00 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Reuters I thought WH said trump would be in basement office close to medical assistance if needed?
1313982187000131584 2020-10-08 07:19:00 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MSNBC They don't look tall or wide enough.

1313533111183998976 2020-10-07 01:34:32 +0800 <ReggieKeats> NOT a show of strength. A show of unbridled hubris.  https://t.co/nIyeikQavO
1313512459425050624 2020-10-07 00:12:28 +0800 <ReggieKeats> And remember American voters, the Republicans have had 10 years and still have NOT produced a healthcare plan for you and me.  The ACA may not be perfect, but it's in place and Joe and Kamala will work on improvements...  VOTE Blue for truth and for saving our democracy.
1313509761120305152 2020-10-07 00:01:45 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Just because published poll results may say Joe is in the lead--do NOT get complacent and think your vote shouldn't matter then. Make sure you are registered and make sure you vote!  Our democracy depends on it!
1313508357521645568 2020-10-06 23:56:10 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @BetteMidler That's what appears to be 90% of the problem... trump's advisors aren't allowed to advise.  He listens to no one, no one disagrees with him or they're out.   #VoteHimOut
1313506655179423744 2020-10-06 23:49:25 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Perhaps a resignation of the governor of Texas is in order too--one polling location per county?  If that's not voter suppression (at the last minute no less) what is? Gotta love üò° trumpian republicans.
1313500116934770689 2020-10-06 23:23:26 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Acosta It definitely was noticeable that trump in his brief photo OP had labored breathing last night.
1313499239368945664 2020-10-06 23:19:56 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @realDonaldTrump I just keep noticing all the surfaces you touch.  Who follows after you to wipe down all those handrails?   Military staff at your service--prior to your infection no masks, after all in masks. Did you deride them before?  More staff tested positive, frightening.
1313225592142131200 2020-10-06 05:12:34 +0800 <ReggieKeats> trump's erratic speeches, garrulous energy at rallies, chewing his lip, and copious sweating...reminds me of my brother in his later years who would dose himself periodically with a regime of Prednisone.
1313216161559928832 2020-10-06 04:35:05 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Vote out crooked @KLoeffler ... stock sales from privileged information, toadying up to trump...  This new swamp creature needs to go away.
1313181035899699201 2020-10-06 02:15:31 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @RepAdamSchiff you will run for president at some point? Yes?
1313180317092470785 2020-10-06 02:12:39 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @VP NEEDS TO SELF QUARANTINE -- no trips, no more potentially exposing others.  Actually care more about us--the common people--than toadying for his boss
1313168384951951360 2020-10-06 01:25:15 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @ErinMPerrine ...really, trump now has experience fighting covid?     Do you have no idea how stupid you sound?
1313142726548811781 2020-10-05 23:43:17 +0800 <ReggieKeats> The president's ego drive:    "The movement was cleared by the medical team as safe to do," deputy press secretary Judd Deere said."  BS -- the petulant pres stomped his feet and coerced others to get his way...no care for safety of others.  He needs to be gone. #VoteHimOut
1313132377082740736 2020-10-05 23:02:10 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Just saw horrible, totally untrue, and fear mongering trump ad.  Vote for the truth people.  Ask questions; ask for evidence of outrageous claims.  Don't accept, "I heard."  Look it up.  Fact check, otherwise it's a game of Rumor--more fantastical claims with each telling.
1312911097540665346 2020-10-05 08:22:53 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @JoeBiden from this thread, it suggests that you need an open air vehicle, or back of a p/u to wave and acknowledge folks who show up even just to see you and wave.  Please consider...

Even though trump knows the best words.
1312757211576164352 2020-10-04 22:11:23 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump    Yes, why was that? People, do you think this guy cares for you?

1312755782920757248 2020-10-04 22:05:43 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Sheesh, at the WH event for ACB, John Roberts is shown on camera talking quite close with Kellyanne...
1312567343621369858 2020-10-04 09:36:55 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @HerreraBeutler ads are a sham...global statements without evidence...sounds like the president's statements.   I-5 needs a bridge--everyone needs to pay for it, it's not just on the backs of Washingtonians.  Beutler only shows up at election time. She needs to go away.

1312420927963971584 2020-10-03 23:55:07 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Acosta Typical WH behavior.
1312420651517444096 2020-10-03 23:54:01 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @SenateGOP IF as you say, you have all the votes you need for ACB then there is absolutely no reason to ram this nominee through even though Johnson, Tillis and Lee are unable to vote for Barrett‚Äôs confirmation.   What's the rush?  Isn't there enough going on in the country?
1312360070643023872 2020-10-03 19:53:17 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @ktumulty @washingtonweek I miss hearing Gwen Ifill's unflappable and probing style, and seeing her million dollar smile.
1312214297351581696 2020-10-03 10:14:02 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @jaketapper @gtconway3d So today Joe Biden takes down campaign ads that malign the president, and trump campaign ups their negativity.   Who are these people supposedly running the country and wanting a second term?  They are reprehensible swamp creatures.
1312211479869886465 2020-10-03 10:02:51 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @CNN In additional separation for VP debate--install clear acrylic shields.   Pence should be self  quarantining.  He was by M. Lee, and by the president.  He needs to be tested every day.
1312121650473705472 2020-10-03 04:05:54 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @JoshNBCNews @JoyAnnReid @PressSec So if WH Ops said it was ok for trump to travel after knowing he'd been exposed...just goes to show, trump has hired only the best people. The administration (this term is used loosely) is filled with brainiacs. #VoteOutTrump
1312106697796669440 2020-10-03 03:06:29 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @Yamiche Who are these people who say Pence doesn't need to quarantine?  He and his wife need to lock themselves up and get tested daily.  Err on the side of caution, and consideration for others...for once trump administration, think of others.   And Mark Meadows put on a f$%king mask.
1312103936610848768 2020-10-03 02:55:30 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Prior to leaving, djt knew Hope Hicks tested positive for Covid, yet he went anyway to an event at his golf club:  "White House aides were informed of Hicks‚Äôs positive result right before Trump‚Äôs helicopter took off for the trip, said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows..."

1302417739802316802 2020-09-06 09:26:01 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @HerreraBeutler never comes out of the woodwork until election time.  She's a do-nothing official drinking from the public trough.  Time to elect Carolyn Long.
1302061785541820416 2020-09-05 09:51:35 +0800 <ReggieKeats> trump voters, seriously, this guy does not care about you.  If you are rich and can afford your own full retirement and private healthcare, then go ahead and vote for trump.  If you need some help from SSI and Medicare--just know this guy is dismantling both.  He's dangerous.
1301575542504738823 2020-09-04 01:39:26 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @mlbmom15 Hi, good morning.  Open and read the entire link in my tweet.  It's from CNN.  If you are covered in other ways and don't rely on SSI then you shouldn't have to be concerned.
1301325336085323777 2020-09-03 09:05:12 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Ok trump voters, hope you have lots of money stashed away cuz this guy wants to take away your last little safety net, SociaI Security.   https://t.co/bTfzzP3AzE

1301321775410589697 2020-09-03 08:51:03 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump has absolutely no idea what a heritage anything even means...what a joke.
1301319562663665665 2020-09-03 08:42:15 +0800 <ReggieKeats> @MarkMeadows go back under your rock.

1301182649117978625 2020-09-02 23:38:13 +0800 <ReggieKeats> "White House‚Äôs obstinacy is further evidence that, in addition to abdicating any semblance of global leadership", trump apparently doesn't believe that more brains are better than his addled one.     trump voters this is your brainiac president at work.
1300802873438003202 2020-09-01 22:29:07 +0800 <ReggieKeats> Gees Louise...so much (everything) online that headline 'writers' must be pulled from somewhere other than editors with any writing skills.
