1343740726602043398 2020-12-29 10:08:49 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> @ClaraBauler Yes, I found lots of innovative stuff on Twitter, but I still think that Facebook has more advantage over Twitter, esp Facebook groups where fb members discuss current research. I‚Äôm on a group where members share research published in 2020 that you may not find available online.

I used to help friends with citizenship questions, but it‚Äôs getting too hard now. Even applicants will be asked 20 instead of 6 or few questions.
1334294485862330368 2020-12-03 08:32:50 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> It‚Äôs so scary and intriguing how AI can dupe people into delusional thinking and mistrusting others. The idea of the thriller is fascinating.
