I am not jumping on what he failed to do once as an excuse to foolishly expose myself or endanger others. What he “told us to do“ was follow public health guidance, as countries all over the world have been doing during surges.

The point of lockdown, stay at home is to slow transmission so health resources not exhausted.  Now, because lack of compliance w/pub health guidance during TG and after, huge spread. No ICU to treat virus/other cases.

Does his not wearing a mask at a restaurant put him on a par with Trump who lied about Covid, had no national plan, almost never wore mask, spread virus widely?

Is Mr. M as bad a fit to VA mission?

GOP does not want life to be better for the majority of Americans. They do not want to share. Next step will be to gut Medicare, SS, cut safety net to shreds.

Because she was the “plan” person, many progressives didn’t review his, which couldn’t be detailed in debate. Her plans, taken altogether weren’t economically feasible, per her econ. guy.

Warren is far from a foreign policy expert. Progressive votes do not outweigh larger groups’ votes. Biden consulted Bernie and Warren as he finalized his policies. Biden has FP cred.

I’ll wager you over 78 million don’t think Biden lost, along with numerous election officials from both parties, Karl Rove!, and various GOP leaders. I don’t think most of YOU believe he lost.

The vast majority of BLM protesters have not rioted. Very, very few have and in some cases turned out not to be supporters. It is police actions against non-violent demonstrators that can be characterized as rioting.

He will investigate, push papers around, not find anything substantive enough t get near to overturning results. Biden has tremendous legal firepower at his disposal and was well versed in what could happen. Stay united!

Trump became convinced of his supreme powers from the intoxicating effect his cheap theatrics have on his fan-addicts. Our democracy is more powerful than Trump. We just voted for it.

Barr is not all-powerful and neither is Trump. Barr sees the handwriting on the wall. He will not find enough to do anything to overturn results.

Has hundreds of lawyers, knows any possible political leverage within the system.  No. Trump not going to nuke. Narcissist wants to live.

Let hew admin work on transition.

Biden developed a more progressive agenda as he consulted Warren, Bernie, and yes, AOC. But as president, and having been VP, and having a VP very bright and experienced, I think he’s well able to choose his cabinet.

It did arise among a smaller # of activists.

Now he’s bleating about Dems cheating. We didn’t install machines that are rigged, hackable, ignore Russian continuing interference, refuse to secure elections. We want every vote to count!

1323045738939518977 2020-11-02 07:34:19 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @DanRather Their cult leader Trump is a thug magnet, a lawless and corrupt traitor who has urged them on to greater violence throughout his presidency. He has legitimized and empowered their fear and their hatred. He has weaponized them. Let them implode! Stay out if the fray.
1323043273997393921 2020-11-02 07:24:32 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @SueBooThompson @ddale8 His face glistens with sweat. Makeup applied with a trowel. Ramping up accordion hands, lies, threats, whining, urging violence. He does remind one of Downfall’s depiction of Hitler mood-swinging in the bunker. Well, the Yanks are coming, the anti-fascist Yanks...

1323026839271481344 2020-11-02 06:19:13 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @ArvaChris Hunter Biden had the good grace not to make public appearances when in the throes of drug abuse. He also had a productive career in his own right, not just shilling for dad. No cowardly animal kills. Dad loves him. No wonder DonnieJr jealous.

Biden never said he wants to be president for life, that the press is an enemy, that his rival# should be imprisoned. Remember Trump also wants to control history curriculum for children to “teach about our culture.”

Not working. Go back to Hilary’s emails.

He poisons all political discussion with racism, paranoia, narcissism, his angry personal drama as deadly for the American soul as the virus for our bodies. We must liberate our nation from Trump+Trumpism.

Schools opening in areas with significant number of cases particularly need mask mandates, smaller learning pods, good ventilation, sanitation stations, and testing and tracing.

Keep to the status quo, rights and privileges for whites only, a white centered America can continue. It’s like Cvd. Not a big deal so no need to address.

Made substantial and pointed comment about need to protect democracy. Ending great.

Evangelicals want to go full tilt boogie medieval. Trump goes where the 2020 votes are, a coalition of conspiracy crazies, rabid racists, elitists, religious nuts, plain nutty

These folks go back to different social groups, regions and will spread infection diffusely. Big gatherings without any preventive measures are the worst. We needed national/ global strategy, no politicizing
1313929743771684864 2020-10-08 03:50:37 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @vegix Conley said TRUMP reported being symptom-free. A doctor’s report based on a patient’s self-report: worthless. No one goes from Trump’s level of respiratory distress to symptom-free overnight. Conley’s wording deliberate. Given meds/symptoms, Dr. V Gupta suspected CV pneumonia.

Trump was to be in isolation. Others had to help him to vehicle. At the WH he took off his mask. He was infected due to his own recklessness. That’s fine, but he isn’t hesitating to spread to others. 210,000 dead.
1313257491761750017 2020-10-06 07:19:19 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @DavidCornDC He just walked into WH without a mask. He missed the unit on Covid prevention.

Trump put his Covid denial into action with himself and our nation. He killed 200,000 people because he wouldn’t enact a plan for preventing transmission. His own stupidity sickened him.

No partisan paramilitary “watchers” carrying guns!

He was just instrumental in getting a volunteer firefighter inmate released after serving 22 years put on a plane to detainment in Louisiana and then deportation to Laos, where he knows no one and has no family. Not the first.

Don Jr. echoed his call, asking for “an army” of them. I think we can assume they envision armed muscle, not passive “monitors.” In other words, don’t just watch, intimidate. P.S. Only racists need apply.

Neither candidate’s debate success or failure, or their relative styles had to do with age. Lifespan is another issue.

It was a shambles because Trump has no self-control, can not answer questions or rebut, so tried to make it impossible for his rival to talk.

Insults fallen, disabled soldiers. Spreads racism, violent divisions; ignored pandemic until out of control. Denied science. Foreign policy Putin-led. Idolizes dictators. Trump is dangerous to America.

Biden had a powerful message, set the election themes, didn’t get bogged down in policy, and offered wisdom, personal warmth, empathy.  These are sorely needed. Widest appeal.
1301997774280556546 2020-09-05 05:37:13 +0800 <Virgini98900230> @KellyannePolls The Obama economy was great! Trump rode that wave for awhile, claiming the credit. Biden was the VP. He handled the stimulus money and saw that every penny was accounted for. Under Trump, the lion’s share went to rich donors and bigger businesses.

Blake’s ex-girlfriend, not a little girl, made a complaint of inappropriate sexual touching, a third degree sexual offense. Police shouldn’t mete out vigilante “justice.”

In earlier protests, cops did not go after looters or arsonists.  The arrested peaceful protestors, gassed, clubbed, shoved, ran them down.

More concerned about the militias supporting Trump whom some police departments are cozy with, strange because members of these groups have  murdered LE in the past.Infiltration.
