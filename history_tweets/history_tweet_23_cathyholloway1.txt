That is how I used to feel most of the time, then some of the time, now occasionally. It still comes like a sucker punch though. Definitely sparing a thought today for all who feel unsuccessful.

Time to rethink academia and how we retain and grow brilliant talent without the need for life to break said talent. You are not alone, I say also from personal experience. We can do this!
