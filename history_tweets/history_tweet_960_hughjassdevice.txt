If I can’t open my business, my children can’t go to school, I can’t visit my family in the hospital or a nursing home, or walk on a beach(!) or any of 1000 other insane restrictions, that is a lockdown and it has awful effects. Don’t be dense.
1342478297255600128 2020-12-25 22:32:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @drdagly Absolutely not. Having family for Christmas dinner, then getting on an airplane to ski in Colorado. My family will keep living, thank you.
1342469692267573252 2020-12-25 21:58:11 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jeffreyatucker Isn’t the greater evil that they don’t BELIEVE their exhortations (but keep making them)? If Birx actually agreed that gathering her family would put their lives at stake, of course she wouldn’t do it. CA has closed all restaurants, but Newsome is entirely comfortable dining out.
1342466372731871232 2020-12-25 21:44:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kumailn Why do travel restrictions help reduce the spread of covid when covid is endemic across the entire country?

What do you think a check from The government is going to do? The scary thing is how easily you and your kind have adopted this totalitarianism. It’s it’s own virus, and it found the perfect host.

Or children in blue cities who haven’t stepped foot in a school in 10 months. This is monstrous, and if you aren’t opposing it, you are complicit, and will live with that shame forever.

But no more vague than the concept of “expected deaths” for the year 2020. So I think of a lockdown death as a excess death that would not have occurred if the government hadn’t destroyed the economy and our society.
1342257278255292421 2020-12-25 07:54:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @scottdavidherr This is total horseshit

Why in the world do you think the old way of attributing deaths to a pandemic is even valid? We have completely changed how we capture data, with all biases toward one bug. Its insane.
1342210724853149697 2020-12-25 04:49:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @numbers_truth @jhaskinscabrera @Michael95494331 @TheGoosecast @kbo_coyote In this string, you state the CDC excess death # is 340K. This chart shows 247k for covid. Even if those are all correct, there are 93k OTHER excess deaths. Those, I propose, are “lockdown deaths”/1
1342181094368681998 2020-12-25 02:51:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @TheGoosecast @numbers_truth @jhaskinscabrera @Michael95494331 @kbo_coyote Appreciate the apology, thank you.

Sounds like you are one of the lucky people with a guaranteed income during lockdown. Good for you.
1342178140660133891 2020-12-25 02:39:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NPR What does the phrase “after adjusting for age and sex” mean in this context? Because the main reason the incarcerated shouldn’t be at the front of the line is bc the elderly are hundreds or thousands of times more likely to die, and therefore need to be vaccinated first.

The various NPIs that have no effect on covid have eradicated flu? There has been no flu even in places w/o flu shot adoption (it is a global phenomenon).

Proportion of each is an interesting question. The fact that you refuse to even entertain the question is a REALLY interesting question. Doesn’t seem like you are seeking the “numbers truth” at all. Why?
1342159668634906625 2020-12-25 01:26:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @TheGoosecast @Michael95494331 @numbers_truth @kbo_coyote @jhaskinscabrera Do you think that is what is happening? @jhaskinscabrera has reviewed death certs in FL that shows the opposite. Many have pointed out that other causes of death are currently unexpectedly LOW as deaths are overwhelmingly coded as covid. Where’s the flu?

What we are all saying is there are non-conspiratorial reasons why the covid number is inflated. Eg: PCR testing and attribution of any death w/ a positive test to covid.

Why? Do you think PCR testing of every person who walks into a hospital, regardless of reason, is not affecting the number of people who’ve died “of” covid?

It’s not reliable data.
1341840707443671041 2020-12-24 04:18:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @StevenBeschloss Scrolling up for your similar reaction to Clinton’s pardon of the FALN terrorists, who set off 120 bombs in the US. Assume you also declared that the “repulsive act of a sub-human.” Or no?

1341833617849405441 2020-12-24 03:50:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @numbers_truth @kbo_coyote @jhaskinscabrera Of course most of the excess death is covid (especially in March-May). Now, we are in a PCR-based pandemic with people throwing around “another 9/11 every day!!” Who don’t know what they are talking about.
1341833141972025347 2020-12-24 03:48:45 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @numbers_truth @kbo_coyote @jhaskinscabrera That is overly simplistic and will be the subject of future study. What about an Alzheimer’s patient kept in isolation this year, who would have died in 2021, but stopped eating in July and died? If that person has recent a “positive” covid test, that was a covid death in 2020.

Hospitals have implemented unprecedented cause-of-death coding based on unprecedented use of PCR tests. How much confidence do you have that all excess since March is due to covid? Mine is low.

The only valid question is how many deaths is covid adding to total death. Hint: not 3000/day, not even close.

Questions I would ask: what % of max capacity is that? And What % of max capacity are we typically at at this time of year?

1341502031568269312 2020-12-23 05:53:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BrettKelman @subsix848 Which is that hospitals are coping with covid just fine, despite the rise in Covid hospitalizations, and the possible reasons that is the case.

It is not at all intuitive that as seasonal covid cases rise, hospitals are somehow able to magically reduce other hospitalizations  so overall levels are unchanged. However this has been seen in other places (eg TX this summer)./1
1341496675748229124 2020-12-23 05:31:45 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @subsix848 @BrettKelman Agree, but it’s baffling to me that he looks at that chart, and asks US to look at it, and then refuses to admit the truth staring him right in the face. Brett, anything to say for yourself?

1339394287327436800 2020-12-17 10:17:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kbo_coyote @karenvaites @elizashapiro Either way, it’s comical to have the President-elect suggesting he’s going to enact some kind of mini-Marshall plan to open schools, when much of the country’s schools are open today, with NO issues. He is either going to confront teachers unions in blue states, or he’s not.

1339359903681548288 2020-12-17 08:00:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @rfsquared “Yeah but all those suicides and overdoses are because of the pandemic, not because of destructive lockdowns”— lockdown cheerleaders
1339249694489387008 2020-12-17 00:43:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @david_shane Don’t forget, it also satisfies their religious desire for COLLECTIVE action in service of the moral good. And that unleashes the worst totalitarian instincts among the believers.
1339249031671844864 2020-12-17 00:40:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @TedPetrou Is this chart inaccurate?  https://t.co/2VKP7oPQ55
1339236384964550658 2020-12-16 23:50:10 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @msmacb Careful, you’re close to admitting that Soros IS actually influencing elections and policy. You’re supposed to deny that as a Qanon conspiracy theory.
1339075922570469376 2020-12-16 13:12:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> This pro-covid buffoon is going to wear a mask after he’s vaccinated just so we all know how much he loves us.
1339057410720354306 2020-12-16 11:58:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra Sadly yet another way that rich kids (who can afford a PG year) are less impacted by these lockdown decisions than regular kids. The Democrats’ policies are destroying working class kids.
1338996257977720834 2020-12-16 07:55:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jimgeraghty Problem is, If you’re under age 65 and healthy, one of those has no clear benefit to you. And it ain’t the hot dog.
1338959672498327552 2020-12-16 05:30:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYGovCuomo Six deaths per million residents. Open the state!
1338917685044895751 2020-12-16 02:43:46 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @TedPetrou Seems relevant/interesting that over a 2-year period, mortality is normal. That isn’t true in other hard-hit places, I believe.
1338693471222325249 2020-12-15 11:52:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MarkChangizi Another way of saying this is that if we directed all govt and societal resources to only one effort: &lt;PLEASE stay home and quarantine if you have symptoms consistent with covid&gt;, we would have the chance of reducing spread by &gt;96%. With no masks, open schools and businesses
1338690769851469825 2020-12-15 11:42:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ErikMagnu @davidsirota You sir, are a clown in search of a clown show. Good luck.

If your MIL has had a confirmed diagnosis of covid (and had symptoms, ie real disease, not positive PCR test w no symptoms), I urge you to let her live her remaining life in peace.
1338689518002720770 2020-12-15 11:37:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ErikMagnu @davidsirota What do you call it when millions of people starve to death? What the Hell? Did you steal mommy’s phone?

1338687945201635328 2020-12-15 11:30:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ErikMagnu @davidsirota Do you think that’s what his tweet says?
1338686430898507778 2020-12-15 11:24:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @davidsirota Do you think it negatively affects your credibility when you predict the possibility of an American famine that kills millions? That that might be viewed as hysterical trash from a not-serious person?
1338685258984796160 2020-12-15 11:20:11 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BetSnyder @JasonSalemi @bethlinas No one who had and recovered from covid should take the vaccine. What?
1338684992180924417 2020-12-15 11:19:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @shanselman We have 3 9/11s per day of death in the United States, every day, all year long. Take a position on the number of excess deaths that can be properly attributed to covid, that would add something to the conversation. Or shit up, you can do that too.
1338683261237809152 2020-12-15 11:12:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @HumphreyPT Interventions are pointless. Every state has the same curve.
1338682331515727872 2020-12-15 11:08:34 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @michaelmina_lab Because it won’t take long to vaccinate nursing home residents and staff, other elderly and healthcare workers and others with serious diseases making them vulnerable. No one else is at risk from covid so they don’t need and shouldnt want the vaccine.
1338671579358760960 2020-12-15 10:25:50 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Here’s the Exec Dir of @hrw musing that perhaps Biden will re-define being a good Catholic” to include those who favor the legal right to butcher children in the womb.

1338630321038823425 2020-12-15 07:41:53 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki There are some reasons SWE vs NOR is a good one (and some compelling arguments why it isn’t). But SF versus SD seems to be perhaps the worst example of a natural experiment one could devise (unless one believes policy is everything; then it probably seems perfect).
1338614712603381763 2020-12-15 06:39:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Why do you assume the difference in result between those two places had to do with policy, rather than some other difference? Can’t imagine any two places that are more different. Seems like a poor choice for a natural experiment.

YOU suggested my child learn about “sacrifice” from the current situation. The essence of sacrifice is that it’s voluntary. This is the state crushing the lives of kids. (Without any scientific basis to do so). You’re a cheerleader for a moral crime.

1337795626382336001 2020-12-13 00:25:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra So HS athletes can play sports when their grandparents all get vaccinated against a disease that barely affects kids? Gregg, stop being a cheerleader for our idiotic state government and start doing the work of a journalist. Ask some questions. Express just a LITTLE skepticism.

1337611511762726921 2020-12-12 12:13:30 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DavidProkopy @JamesBooth76 The “It worked in New Zealand” crowd is the absolute worst. Auckland airport had 21mm passengers in 2019. Just the 3 largest airports in the NYC metro area had 7 times that volume. The amount covid ever introduced into NZ was minimal. Shut up with the nonsense.
1337604076276768780 2020-12-12 11:43:57 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DavidProkopy @JamesBooth76 How much was avoidable? Please quantify how much death was avoidable from a disease that kills people who are 80+ with an average of 3 co-morbidities?  How much was avoidable in NY/NJ/CT, where 60%+ of the dead lived in LTC? Let us know why you think we invented death in 2020.
1337602322504036362 2020-12-12 11:36:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> This water-carrier for Cuomo’s lockdown says “sports rank 7th highest” for covid spread— omits that getting it in your own house is 74x more likely. These people need to be held to account. We are living in anti-democratic times, and these people are doing their dirty work.

1337542900872335362 2020-12-12 07:40:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhaskinscabrera @Prof_JTaylor I misunderstood, sorry. I thought it was showing that the testing was using a higher threshold later in the season to determine positivity (which would be clear manipulation). But in fact this just shows that later in season, there are still PCR positives but fewer “real” cases.

What evidence are you using to ID so-called “high-risk sports”? Should I keep going, or do you have enough now to DO YOUR FUCKING JOB?!
1337536320542040071 2020-12-12 07:14:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @SportsRushN12 4. Is there any instance of a case of serious disease being traced to a kids sporting event in NYS? 5. Tens of 000s of NY kids have been traveling playing club sports for months? Have any of those kids gotten seriously ill?
1337535551658995714 2020-12-12 07:11:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @SportsRushN12 1. What science are you relying on to restrict kids from playing sports? 2. What science are you relying on for restricting kids from attending in -person SCHOOL?  3. What CT level does the state believe is appropriate in identifying positive cases in PCR testing? . . .

1337514496965926913 2020-12-12 05:48:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Prof_JTaylor @jhaskinscabrera Is there any explanation other than manipulation? I’ve been thinking that as real positives rise, viral shedding should mean that non-infectious PCR positives would also rise bc of increase in “viral debris”. But this seems to imply opposite effect.
1337500559167918081 2020-12-12 04:52:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @daisychick23 @NYSPHSAA “How will students be transported safely?” Seriously? There are millions of kids riding buses, rising in cars w friends, playing club sports. COVID DOESNT MAKE KIDS SICK!!
1337478306892017664 2020-12-12 03:24:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSPHSAA Any reference to “infection rates” based on PCR tests and unknowns cycle thresholds is unscientific claptrap. 5 people per million died in NYS yesterday.

Our idiotic governor currently has a tweet pinned to his Twitter that says over 70% of spread is in households. Yesterday, less than 5 people per million died, statewide. The state has no right to do this to kids.
1337468378236203008 2020-12-12 02:44:44 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @mattyglesias We should “go back” to democratic bodies voting for changes to their laws.

1337258200001875970 2020-12-11 12:49:34 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DinnaShepard @MikeBalsamo1 Too bad they aren’t around to advocate for his clemency . . . Because he shot and burned them to death.

About 9000 a day. Every. Single. Day. Why did we lose our minds over a respiratory virus that virtually everyone survives?
1337229380095979523 2020-12-11 10:55:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kboc21 @Gregg_Sarra @tycoons39 No, I “minimize” because they are MINIMAL!! The number of not-otherwise-dying deaths from covid in NYS is truly tiny.
1337228768948183040 2020-12-11 10:52:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesBooth76 US experiences approx 3 9/11s per day every day, all year.

I’m the pst several weeks, about 3 people PER MILLION in NYS have died of covid. Overwhelmingly elderly, overwhelmingly sick with other ailments. Three. Per. Million.
1337226219746697227 2020-12-11 10:42:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kboc21 @Gregg_Sarra @tycoons39 As the parent of two high school athletes that are having that taken away, it is incredibly central to their lives (and not bc they think they’re going pro; that’s idiotic). And it’s been taken from them for NO REASON.
1337188956308377604 2020-12-11 08:14:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kboc21 @Gregg_Sarra @tycoons39 Even if going to fully remote school is reducing spread of covid (which I doubt), it is not morally acceptable to ruin the lives of children in order to pursue some theoretical effort at protecting the elderly.

1337076986867552256 2020-12-11 00:49:30 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Agree its majority, although full study of state death certificate data needed to determine for sure. Not sure I’d concede your HI/SF point so readily. Also note recent criticism that CDC baseline death # is artificially low for some reason, leading to overcounting of excess.
1337074984682917889 2020-12-11 00:41:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @chrislhayes This whole line of thought is so innumerate it’s enraging. Every day in America, EVERY DAY, about 9000 people die. All year. This year, many people are dying of (or with a positive PCR test for) covid. But the ONLY thing that matters is whether more people are dying than expected
1337073506496942082 2020-12-11 00:35:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki How do you break that down between covid deaths and lockdown deaths?
1336898226084057088 2020-12-10 12:59:10 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @avrnz @jeremyfaust Sounds like *those people (65+) should get vaccinated then, and leave my kids out of it.

And in order to keep up the fiction that its necessary for safety, sports can’t play. I think we should open schools and sports tomorrow. No reason sports have to come second.

1336831255166525443 2020-12-10 08:33:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @CDCgov It has been proven, clearly, that masks do nothing to protect the wearer. Stop spreading falsehoods.

YOU posited that travel bans are the cause of that. This is demonstrably false since many countries on those continents had no ban (indeed not mitigation at all) AND no covid. Come on man.
1336829157863550977 2020-12-10 08:24:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @StatsGuyDaniel Did we just start keeping this stat? Seems unlikely we just find ourselves in the Golden Age of the QB Hit.

And there are countries in Asia and Africa that did virtually NOTHING, and had basically zero covid deaths. It’s not travel bans.

1336806932661809152 2020-12-10 06:56:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Reasonableques3 @zorinaq @Humble_Analysis The minuscule levels of covid death in Africa and parts of Asia, regardless of mitigation, regardless of border controls and regardless of quality of health system is one of the central mysteries of covid. But one thing that is clear: it ain’t travel bans, chief.
1336769491007660034 2020-12-10 04:27:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Reasonableques3 @zorinaq @Humble_Analysis That you think that explains the incredibly low levels of covid death in those countries.

1336511222120898561 2020-12-09 11:21:21 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jeremyfaust Those side effects look worse than the typical case of covid for children and young adults. Why should they be vaccinated?

He’s following SOME public health experts who called for lockdowns, masks and school and business closures. Others have rightly pointed out that this is a seasonal virus that behaves according to its biology, and all these measures are both destructive AND useless.

This is not evidence or argument, it’s unpleasantness at the level of performance art.
1334182429163139075 2020-12-03 01:07:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @MLevitt_NP2013 No, that is also the subject of significant dispute, regardless of your abusive, sarcastic and childish tone. Look at the US Midwest, where all states’ chart are moving precisely in sync regardless of measures taken. And your flu “side effect” is just one hypothesis among many.
1334180491415728128 2020-12-03 00:59:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NickReisman These percentages off of tiny bases are designed to induce a panicked response. What are the hospital CAPACITY numbers?

The reason for it is being hotly debated around the world. Literally the opposite of “indisputable”.
1334174793717977088 2020-12-03 00:37:13 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @MLevitt_NP2013 Your religious belief that the virtual disappearance in flu is due to mitigation is not supported by the data either. Flu also disappeared in jurisdictions with little or no mitigation (“but they mitigated voluntarily”!). Yeah right.
1334165650592456707 2020-12-03 00:00:53 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kerpen This is my fear about getting back to normal in NYS. The numbers here are too low to justify any of the measures being taken, and that has been true for months. And yet here we are, with partial school, businesses restricted, no school sports. So when do we re-open?

Over and over, we see different jurisdictions, w/ wildly different lockdown strategies and timing, w/ covid curves that match exactly (“but people in country X VOLUNTARILY locked down!!”). Yeah right

1333581102737465345 2020-12-01 09:18:06 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq It definitely wasn’t the flu last Spring. Is it roughly equivalent to a bad flu season CURRENTLY?

1333573098004754439 2020-12-01 08:46:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @davidsirota That interpretation requires one to believe Congress intended to give the executive branch the ability to “spend” $1.5 trillion (in forgiveness) without seeking authorization from Congress? That looks like a 6-3 loser. But DC is all about power, so I guess go for it?
1333566741071466497 2020-12-01 08:21:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @davidsirota How does this work without congress passing a law?
1333550719018864642 2020-12-01 07:17:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @elizashapiro Eliza, a more modest newspaper (and reporter) would acknowledge that people have been screaming this from the rooftops since May, and they were dismissed as conspiracists spouting “right wing theories”.
1333522076397940746 2020-12-01 05:23:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @mattyglesias PCR tests are beyond useless. Contact tracing based on PCR test results delivered days later is hilariously futile. This is just NJ residents acknowledging as a group their utter disdain for inept state government.
1333497451416842240 2020-12-01 03:45:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Is it worth including the fact that Sweden has been BELOW the expected number of deaths for the 18 weeks prior to this one?
1333493301991923718 2020-12-01 03:29:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @LisaSeg73503859 @drcraigwax @MatthewSRamsay7 Prove it. Studies have only shown high viral load right before symptom onset, not spread. (no matter how much the masks-and-eyeshield profiles wish it were so). Asymp spread is uncommon, which makes sense, if the person isn’t coughing out germs, he isn’t spreading germs.
1333449740286038016 2020-12-01 00:36:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> If we can’t call what’s going on in the Northeast “herd immunity”, perhaps we should call it “population resistance”. At some point, as cases skyrocket but no one does, we have to call it what it is: OVER.

1333141886329085954 2020-11-30 04:12:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @MartinKulldorff Can you show the restrictions had any effect whatsoever on spread? When the restrictions so obviously have disastrous negative effects, the burden should be on government (and its cheerleaders like yourself) to prove the restrictions have an overall beneficial impact.
1333105186861150212 2020-11-30 01:46:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ABCPolitics Children are perfectly safe from covid, regardless of level community spread. Anyone who talks about kids’ safety is trying to scare you, don’t let them.

1333065004380270592 2020-11-29 23:07:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Yes, it is 34/100,000 above trend for the 10 months ended 10/31.  https://t.co/xyLSFLDoaE
1333051147838492672 2020-11-29 22:12:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrTomFrieden No one believes this. It’s a seasonal respiratory virus. We didn’t do anything to make it go away in Spring, and it didn’t come back in Fall because we “let our guard down”.

1332846636373061632 2020-11-29 08:39:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Solomon_Grundys @AlexBerenson @CDCgov The author should explain, but the CDC’s own data shows significant excess death, so it’s not clear how her data could be derived from that source. This is a recent CDC chart showing excess death during 2020 (the weeks with red +s)  https://t.co/wKlLgyRVcR
1332708276321050624 2020-11-28 23:29:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq This data shows all-cause mortality for Jan-Oct 2020 is in line with prior years.
1332548228005367808 2020-11-28 12:53:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @birbigs What about just regular religious observance by regular people? Are we a better, freeer country if we let those people do that? I’d there room for that?

1332492495251509249 2020-11-28 09:12:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYGovCuomo Total horseshit. Data show Covid hospitalizations are rising rapidly, overall hospitalizations are rising SLOWLY, and capacity is fine. This same lie was told during the covid wave through the sun belt, and it wasn’t true then either. Stop lying.
1332459875805360143 2020-11-28 07:02:44 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @alexkx3 It is also possible that covid is massively replacing other seasonal causes of death and/or deaths of Alzheimer’s, cancer etc are being coded is covid. Right?
1332348475841851393 2020-11-27 23:40:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @omixochitl @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid Too bad Mike blocked me, so he won’t get to see this data. The data ignorance on covid is remarkable.
1332324751109484544 2020-11-27 22:05:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @omixochitl @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid This is useful. Covid hospitalizations are up. Hospitals are coping just fine, and overall hospitalizations are normal:
1332261411356020738 2020-11-27 17:54:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq So you are saying ALL covid deaths in that period will represent excess deaths, deaths of persons who would not have died of something else, like flu or pneumonia?  Given the medical profile of covid deaths, that seems unlikely.
1332196795544428545 2020-11-27 13:37:21 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @argus_constant @harrylitman The framers put the free exercise clause right there in the FIRST Amendment. Perhaps they thought it deserved a “level of ascendancy”.

1332157154195857408 2020-11-27 10:59:50 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BlueSwayedShoes @jhaskinscabrera I read it. Honestly I’m cautious/skeptical about the conclusion since it seems to conclude (from CDC data) that there was no overall. excess death. And we have all seen the cdc chart that shows lots of excess death.  https://t.co/4H1ASuoreF
1332154609255772160 2020-11-27 10:49:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhaskinscabrera Jen, what do you make of the conclusion regarding excess death in the now-deleted JHU article (that there basically weren’t any) versus the CDC’s own excess death data? Those two seem hard to square.
1332144390391930888 2020-11-27 10:09:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @2cities2worlds @tickerguy @JHUNewsLetter Then @JHUNewsLetter should say they pulled it bc it’s wrong. By not saying it, they are vulnerable to criticism of censorship. (Note that all the team reality folks I follow were asking the same question all day, not just spreading this w/o question).
1332142968464142338 2020-11-27 10:03:28 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JHUNewsLetter It was contributing to the spread of the EXACT substance of the article: that covid death is mainly replacing other normal expected deaths. Is that false? If so, your publication should publish a correction. And if it’s NOT false, why censor it?
1332142184699662336 2020-11-27 10:00:21 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @danprimack Why don’t you ring the doorbell so they can come out and kick the living shit out of you?
1332118572496195588 2020-11-27 08:26:31 +0800 <hughjassdevice> The pro covid crown doesn’t want to hear it, but hospitalizations are at normal levels for this time of year.
1332110166632886272 2020-11-27 07:53:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @RandBallsStu Speaking on behalf of the first amendment: Fuck you, sir.
1332091207594422274 2020-11-27 06:37:47 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid The only thing that matters in analyzing covid hospitalization burden is whether it is worse than usual winter respiratory illness season. The NPR article is silent on that point. Unclear if Maddow covered that territory in her blog, I didn’t read it.
1332089108609511424 2020-11-27 06:29:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid These idiotic news stories (“Maddow blog” lol) are not data. Again, hospitals are “critically” busy every winter. Show data that show this winter is WORSE, and that might be interesting.

In general, hospital capacity has been one of the great red herring issues of the whole crisis. No US hospital system has had a significant issue since April (sorry to disappoint you).
1332079651376730112 2020-11-27 05:51:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid Who needs data when you’ve got Mike, who “hears plenty ffs &lt;emoji&gt;”? Good stuff Mike. Happy thanksgiving.
1332063442505781248 2020-11-27 04:47:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid Do you hear yourself wishing for a disaster? What does that say about you? Covid already rolled through the entire sun belt w/o overloading hospitals. Hospitals are not the issue. That’s why all we hear about are “cases”.
1332009786506960897 2020-11-27 01:14:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid Let me guess, you’re neighbor’s cousin is a nurse in El Paso? Hospitals run at or near capacity in winter, every year. Before 2020, it was never in history suggested that hospitals being busy means my kids can’t go to school. It’s insane and you’re part of it. Stop
1331966454917378049 2020-11-26 22:22:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @M1k3ySCC @BigALittleAy @marypaul32 @DaFeid The deaths data in the US is remarkably slow, so we still don’t know whether we are currently experiencing excess death, and at what levels. Hospitals are fine, however, and any reports otherwise are hysterical nonsense. Hospitals get busy w/ respiratory illness in winter.
1331954877212319744 2020-11-26 21:36:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @joshtpm Perhaps worth asking yourself why you’ve gone on this whole garbage person “culture war” rant because people of faith want to worship as they see fit. Why that exercise of 1A rights, in particular, triggers all your authoritarian impulses.
1331953620196134912 2020-11-26 21:31:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DaFeid The CDC data shows significant excess death during the covid period (see image). This article (based on research based on CDC data) states the opposite. Trying to understand why. @JHUNewsLetter  https://t.co/UsPiyYkELA

1331676546113949700 2020-11-26 03:10:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @boutros555 @NielsANielsen @zorinaq These stats are as useless as the “how many nautical disasters” stats. The only question is whether (and how many) more people are dying (or will die) than expected. Still waiting for Marc to address the impact of his 100/day prediction on total death in Sweden.
1331669514749161479 2020-11-26 02:42:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NielsANielsen @zorinaq Estonia sinking? Seriously? Excess death is all that matters in a pandemic. Doubly true for a pandemic that massively overselects for the elderly and sick. And Marc is carefully avoiding making his prediction in terms of excess death bc he knows the impact is tiny.
1331659053056077828 2020-11-26 02:00:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq 1) Euromomo adjusts for reporting lag. Nordics are all normal right now. 2) Your chart above shows ~1800 deaths/day at winter peak. You are forecasting ~100 covid deaths/day at winter peak (5.6% of normal death), much of which presumably replaces other causes of death. Big deal?
1331650448529510408 2020-11-26 01:26:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Euromomo states that Sweden not currently experiencing any excess death. How does 10 deaths per million per day compare to typical respiratory illness season? Are you forecasting excess deaths?
1331615666194018306 2020-11-25 23:08:09 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @FeledyPeter I live in suburban NYC, where we are currently living under all the restrictions I listed.
1331589037799464961 2020-11-25 21:22:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NewsHourExtra @PBS now he’s saying Arizona hospitals are overwhelmed. Is that true? You’ve promoted the guy as a source for families to learn more about covid, maybe you should check.
1331581571007197184 2020-11-25 20:52:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ProfEmilyOster “There is no will to open” is reductive and false. Many many people want to open, and many states and cities are open. There is no will to open among Democratic city government leaders and their allies, the teachers unions. Tell the truth!
1331458681544773634 2020-11-25 12:44:21 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NewsHourExtra @PBS is this true? Should we believe this guy?  You say he’s a good source of covid info, but he’s been lying multiple times a day, every day, for months.
1331417333332664323 2020-11-25 10:00:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrLeanaWen @washingtonpost Thanks Doctor. As a person who made a career tearing children limb from limb in the womb, it is comforting to know you consistently advocate destroying children’s’ lives at ALL stages of development.
1331389585448964096 2020-11-25 08:09:47 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSAAA6 Try this: “Covid doesn’t make kids sick and kids don’t spread covid. Therefore Public schools need to be permitted to return to full sports schedules immediately so that kids of all backgrounds and means can once again get all the benefits that sports provide.”
1331380993601789952 2020-11-25 07:35:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Way to go @NewsHourExtra and @PBS . Way to promote straightforward, non-partisan covid commentary, like this piece of garbage.
1331349894972526597 2020-11-25 05:32:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Furgele228 @jhaskinscabrera Or “Why is canceling school sports a big deal?” Or “Why is limiting capacity at church services a big deal” or “Why is limiting family gatherings a big deal?”  Because the state doesn’t have the RIGHT.

1331260685075042307 2020-11-24 23:37:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSAAA6 Couple observations: 1) Club sports clearly demonstrate that there’s no risk to kids playing and we all need to emphasize that; 2) there is no club football, so those boys have no other outlet; and 3) the class arguments are true, and EVERY athlete should be allowed to play NOW.

1331233673694339079 2020-11-24 21:50:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSAAA6 Worth pointing out that among the thousands  of club sporting events played among NYS kids since Spring, involving hundreds of thousands of NYS kids, how many serious health impacts have there been? Maybe zero? #LetThemPlay

You’re supposed to use the “Sweden did lock down!” arguments when there is good news about Sweden. But here, you are posting it in response to a standard Marc “Sweden is a hellscape” post. So which is it, hellscape, or model of lockdown success?  Can’t be both.
1331025954970488832 2020-11-24 08:04:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @FeledyPeter Look at this chart and ask yourself “if we could go back in time, but with the knowledge contained here, would we lock down the world, close schools and churches, cancel all elective medical procedures, and work from home for 8 months and counting? I don’t think we would.
1331025162196672513 2020-11-24 08:01:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq 0.05% of population. 20.5 days of average death. 5.6% of annual expected deaths. I wonder if the people freaking out about covid would guess the numbers are this low, if asked?

So they want to lock down the entire world.

1330623727999062026 2020-11-23 05:26:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSAAA6 Just scrolled through a week of your posts. There is no single post that says something as simple as “Sports are remarkably safe for kids, all NYS athletes should be permitted to play now”. In your role, that would be a powerful statement and you should make it.

1330524482390396932 2020-11-22 22:52:11 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSAAA6 Of course we can do it safely. It has already been done, all across the entire country, involving millions of kids. Only a few states massively overreacted in this way. Just do your jobs and #LetThemPlay.

1330291514497495040 2020-11-22 07:26:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Drinkofwalter Kids are virtually immune from this illness. Any argument that school closures are for the kids’ safety are asinine and were proven so 6 months ago. You idiot.

1329939430044553216 2020-11-21 08:07:23 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MVPTB12 @Don_Fabbri Right now, all of America’s school kids are required to wear masks, 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. It’s totally unprecedented, so don’t pretend it’s normal. We are basically running a massive, involuntary experiment on our kids, with no evidence of any benefit. Its monstrous.

1329904676284850193 2020-11-21 05:49:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @AlexBerenson At some point, govt is going to have to convince me that, even though my kids are at zero risk of serious illness, they should be vaccinated for the good of society. That is going to require 1) a pristine safety profile and 2) evidence that kids actually spread to adults.

It’s akin to believing in voodoo.

It surely isn’t bc of masks (which don’t work) and washing hands more, which has had little effect on covid. Covid isn’t 100x more contagious
1329851103480049671 2020-11-21 02:16:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DaveBeep @Michael54333358 @MartinJudge10 @ClareCraigPath @larry_griebenow This is a global chart, which includes the Southern Hemisphere. No flu. Even if places w no real lockdowns
1329849442732806144 2020-11-21 02:09:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @KMaherNews12 @RobertZayasNY @MassChiefs @AmityWarriors @PatMedAthletics @WWHSSprts It’s not a “question and headache” for school officials. The fact that club sports have been playing for months is the single best evidence that officials’ approach to covid is unscientific and political, not in the interest of our kids’ wellbeing. Do your job!
1329848155333140481 2020-11-21 02:04:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DaveBeep @Michael54333358 @MartinJudge10 @ClareCraigPath @larry_griebenow Your answer is terrible. Flu isn’t just lessened, it’s GONE. And not just in places that locked down, but EVERYWHERE.  https://t.co/wozNwGbnhj
1329847077271166976 2020-11-21 02:00:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Michael54333358 @DaveBeep @MartinJudge10 @ClareCraigPath @larry_griebenow And it is in answer to this question that the “NPIs ended the flu” crowd just throw up their hands.
1329817674239578115 2020-11-21 00:03:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Has any similarly situated Euro country’s second wave had a deaths/day peak equal to its first wave?
1329810151818326016 2020-11-20 23:33:41 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq 1) cause of death on a day during a wave is meaningless. 2) your own chart shows a seasonal effect w/ no NPIs (“But Sweden did have NPIs!!”) 3) Increase of 10/day would be significant only if it increases overall death form 27-37. I think the 10 won’t increase the total overall.
1329795115913781248 2020-11-20 22:33:56 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhaskinscabrera Got it, thanks.
1329791879303602176 2020-11-20 22:21:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ianmSC Hilarious that anyone thought our current state govts could pull their act together to do tracing at this scale. Ask anyone who’s been to a DMV.
1329791238627799042 2020-11-20 22:18:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JimmyMacLUFC @ClareCraigPath @EmHamSpam And ironically PCR test alone was not used to identify covid cases for purposes of the vaccines. They used PCR at a proper CT plus they required symptoms. Which is why among 000s of subjects they had only a tiny # of actual cases, even in the control arm. We need to end PCR.
1329789076921339906 2020-11-20 22:09:56 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @lied_trump @MarkHerringVA The only metric that you need to fix to get your kids back in school is percentage of state politicians who choose the union over your kids. Gotta get that number down.
1329780688015552514 2020-11-20 21:36:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MollyJongFast To elicit this response from you
1329765684935536644 2020-11-20 20:36:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhaskinscabrera Got it. Someone just tried to tell me that FL only started harvesting old deaths at the end of the summer, but I don’t think that’s correct. I think they’ve been doing it throughout.
1329642339967651843 2020-11-20 12:26:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhaskinscabrera Jen, what does it mean that the massive left/middle part of your chart is solid blue? Were all those deaths reported on the date of death? And then FL started harvesting deaths after Aug when actual deaths started declining, and that’s the multi-colored portion?
1329493143042088960 2020-11-20 02:34:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jivetimes @zorinaq Why would it be useful to accurately predict when FL bureaucrats are going to reclassify deaths from months ago as covid?
1329471885571190786 2020-11-20 01:09:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Any answer on why your model should be consider accurate for FL based on date of reported death, not date of death?
1329395425829400578 2020-11-19 20:05:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MyPawIsStuck @ClarkeMicah There is no basis for this statement. None. If every dumb “wear a mask” advertisement instead urged people feeling the least bit ill to just stay home, it would have a greater effect.
1329270780534910977 2020-11-19 11:50:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq It is widely reported that FL’s death data is harvesting deaths from days or even months earlier. Doesn’t that mean your model “accurately” predicts the bureaucratic reporting of deaths in FL, not actual deaths in FL when they occur?

1329149606295384064 2020-11-19 03:48:55 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq More lying with numbers. It’s a seasonal respiratory virus. It has a SEASON. Seems to last ~8-12 weeks most places. Extrapolating that data annually is ridiculous. Is 10/mil/day atypical level of respiratory disease death in winter season in SWE?
1329135217894973442 2020-11-19 02:51:44 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Does your Model map to FL deaths based on date of death or report date?
1329134706403717120 2020-11-19 02:49:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq If 10 per mil per day die of respiratory disease in Swed in December, is that more than prior years?
1329131218336702467 2020-11-19 02:35:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Humble_Analysis Someone should let Dr. Fauci know. He testified otherwise in front of the US Senate.
1329104433700102146 2020-11-19 00:49:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ClownBasket @foogatwo Hospitalization data is also hopelessly polluted, since every patient is tested when they are admitted. So you don’t know if a patient went to hospital bc covid, or because of cancer, with an incidental positive test (at unknown CT).
1329097311067238401 2020-11-19 00:21:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Government schools, everybody. This is what you get. And this person is essentially guaranteed lifetime employment, a pension, and benefits until death. Something has to change.
1329088996723462153 2020-11-18 23:48:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrTomFrieden Tom is basically sociopathically dishonest. The link below says that masks do NOTHING to protect the wearer. Study is silent on whether masks protect OTHERS, for which no effective RCT is possible. Remember this the next time these psychos tell us to “follow the science.”
1329081941379846146 2020-11-18 23:20:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Embarrassing @nytimes attempt to refute the #danmask study.  But study clearly and irrefutably demonstrates no benefit to the wearer from cloth masks. NONE.  Just focus on making sure those who are sick stay home. That’s it.  https://t.co/9zMsgizf9E
1329068232632905728 2020-11-18 22:25:34 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ClownBasket @foogatwo OK. Obviously any analysis of the curve of deaths based on date of reported death is not useful.
1329066868187938822 2020-11-18 22:20:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @me_marco @IAmTheActualET Of course that study is impossible to produce which conveniently allows you maniacs to continue to mandate what my family WEARS, potentially forever. Fuck you.

1328907190741118976 2020-11-18 11:45:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @VincentRK @EladSharonMD You thought about clarifying that your stated number was 40% or so too high, but then decided not to because it “is the same”.  OK then.
1328906662493773824 2020-11-18 11:43:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EladSharonMD @VincentRK @WHO @business You keep tweeting words, but none of them stand for the proposition that 100% of a population can contract a contagious respiratory virus. That is impossible, and absurd.

1328895672683278336 2020-11-18 10:59:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EladSharonMD @VincentRK So you consider 70% the upper bound. I think that sounds way too high, but OK. But @VincentRK ‘s tweet assumes 100% infection. That is impossible.

He should be fighting for athletes, who all want to play (and to be clear, it is safe to play, NOW, as has been shown across the US).
1328841483319975936 2020-11-18 07:24:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @VincentRK Doesnt this assume 100% of the population would be infected with covid? Is there any basis for thinking that could occur?

1328729830741970948 2020-11-18 00:00:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DailyCaller It is an INTENTIONAL violation of his own order. He didn’t “fall short”. What the hell?
1328407217297616896 2020-11-17 02:38:55 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther I just want useful data. A chart showing only 200 people in the ICU (20 per million) is not very interesting unless that’s a lot more than they usually have. (Or rather, it IS interesting that that is how you chose to present it).
1328403725828886528 2020-11-17 02:25:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther If it has all those differences versus typical seasonal respiratory season, then it should show up in the average annual ICU usage that you are scrambling not to show.
1328399133934317574 2020-11-17 02:06:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther This is an evasive answer. If covid is replacing flu, pneumonia and other illnesses but leading to the same number of ICU admissions, then there is relatively little cause for concern. So the comparison to prior years is vital. But OK
1328397418090606592 2020-11-17 01:59:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther Based on your evasive answer and the incomplete chart, I’ll go ahead and assume this is normal ICU census for Sweden at this time of year. Feel free to prove me wrong.
1328393472274026496 2020-11-17 01:44:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther That ICU trend in particular looks remarkably normal for this time of year. Not even 200 people? Any comparison versus prior year respiratory illness ICU census?
1328339142204411905 2020-11-16 22:08:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BorisJohnson This has as much scientific validity as throwing a virgin into a volcano to bless the harvest. We are living in dangerous times.

1327807336296177664 2020-11-15 10:55:13 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @tikipapier Is that correct? For what time period? In what jurisdiction? How is “expected hospitalizations” defined?
1327789903099342851 2020-11-15 09:45:56 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zachdcarter Please, I am begging here, please tell me how that would be legal. Because I don’t think that’s “how a bill becomes a law”
1327789476010221568 2020-11-15 09:44:14 +0800 <hughjassdevice> If North Dakota’s hospitalization data is representative of national figures, our hospitalization data is overstating covid hospitalizations by 40%. It’s just very sick people who also happened to have failed a covid test.

It is an endemic respiratory virus, it spreads until it stops. Keep doing whatever you have been doing to keep your m-in-l safe since March, and be grateful that the risk to the young is so low

Basically, you are now characterizing fear of longcovid as an example of longcovid. Deranged

1326964022873296896 2020-11-13 03:04:11 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYGovCuomo Do your job: 1. Report NYS deaths accurately by DATE OF DEATH. 2. Report the number of amplification cycles being used for positive PCR test results. 3. Tell us the complete number of people killed by your policies in the nursing homes.
1326950350469804032 2020-11-13 02:09:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @LetCounty @Gregg_Sarra I’m sorry, but this response is incoherent. I am asking whether you think the shelter-in-place, business and school closures, ordering takeout, handwashing and masks is why the covid rate in NY dropped from highest on Earth to near zero and has basically stayed there since June.
1326938778313822208 2020-11-13 01:23:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kelleykphoto @GovMurphy Perhaps he should require all those who have NOT traveled outside NJ to shelter in place.
1326937044732534786 2020-11-13 01:16:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @elizashapiro Because everyone now sees clearly there is zero risk to otherwise healthy kids from covid, while remote (or no) learning is having disastrous effects on kids. This was always true, sad it took us so long to see it.

And you are correct that 25 deaths were reported statewide. You should know that NYS does not report deaths on the date of death, so of those 25 deaths, some could have occurred weeks or months ago.
1326866920113659904 2020-11-12 20:38:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @News12LI @NYGovCuomo @News12LI you need to correct this tweet. Not sure what the phrase “and deaths” means at the end of it, but deaths are not increasing on LI and have been low single digits FOR MONTHS.

Thousands of cases a day, with only a small portion of those hospitalized and only a small portion of THOSE dying. Most people have a cold, or less, from covid.

It’s nonsense. NY’s numbers are low bc it already went through, and there is now resistance in the population to slow it down./1

I’m sure they were both elderly and otherwise sick. That is 1 person for every 3.8 million residents of LI. There is no covid problem on Long Island. None. Zero. It is over and has been for months.
1326602509943599104 2020-11-12 03:07:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra Remember, not just the CHSAA - the entire country found a way to play HS sports, even so-called “high risk” football. We are talking about millions of kids. Have you seen a lot of stories of hospitalized high school kids?  There have been none. COVID IS ZERO RISK FOR KIDS!

1326540981999558656 2020-11-11 23:03:10 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra If someone tells you that “cases are spiking”, know cases and deaths diverged months ago. PCR tests are much too sensitive and pick up viral fragments in people who are not sick or contagious.  And yet all we hear about are “cases”. This is from AUGUST!  https://t.co/kuCmdO4PNO
1326527667873722368 2020-11-11 22:10:16 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra So do you follow the data or repeat “what we’re being told by the government”? Because they are not the same thing. Again, 7.6mm people live here, and TWO died yesterday. TWO.

The whole story simply isn’t out there, that the pandemic has been virtually over in NY for months, and the NY press is not challenging @NYGovCuomo nearly enough.

And that, since they occur overwhelmingly in elderly and sick persons, they will likely replace other deaths of those same people?

1326224504318726145 2020-11-11 02:05:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq @DublinLiving Don’t be dense, no one is hiding anything. I happily concede that Finland avoided covid in the Spring (so did Nigeria, how were their NPIs?). It is obviously valid to compare countries that did NOT avoid covid in the Spring and how they are doing now.
1326223888032862209 2020-11-11 02:03:09 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq @DublinLiving 0.8 people are dying of covid for every MILLION in Sweden. So “one in a million” actually OVERSTATES a Swedish individual’s risk of dying from it today. Since almost all the risk is among elderly/sick, risk to young people is a small fraction of THAT. Stop trying to cause panic.
1326221814134165506 2020-11-11 01:54:55 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra Pay attention to deaths/hospitals. Ignore case data. Did you know that in the current Pfizer vaccine study, Pfizer doesn’t even count a covid pos+ as a “case” until there is a pos+ PCR test AND 2 symptoms? Bc unless you have symptoms, you aren’t sick, it’s just bits of RNA.
1326220837435928578 2020-11-11 01:51:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq @DublinLiving For reference, this is what I told @DublinLiving
1326220677440004096 2020-11-11 01:50:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq @DublinLiving Obviously, WHY covid missed Norway/Finland/Japan/Vietnam/Africa is incredibly interesting, it’s just a separate point. SWE was hit hard, as was much of EUR, and Sweden, alone among those hard-hit countries, is doing fine now. 0.8 deaths per million per day is ~0.
1326220159762173965 2020-11-11 01:48:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq Just did this with @DublinLiving, only he is partial to Norway. Obviously, if you are making a point about coming out the other side of a critical pandemic in good shape, it makes sense to compare with other countries that had critical pandemics, NOT countries that covid missed.
1326196326040793090 2020-11-11 00:13:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jhcowboys3 @RobertZayasNY They should also speak to lacrosse and hockey programs, all of which have been playing since the Spring with no issues. This is unscientific nonsense at this point.
1326191376606744577 2020-11-10 23:53:58 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra The last time the virus was about to go exponential and overwhelm hospitals was in the sunbelt in July/August. It didn’t happen (even in places with low “adherence levels”). Just like in NE states in April. Now the Midwest is going through it. It will pass as it has elsewhere.
1326185485002289156 2020-11-10 23:30:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Laurie_Garrett @CDCgov The population being hospitalized for covid is so sick with other factors that  these re-admittance rates are not surprising at all.

1326176698463825922 2020-11-10 22:55:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jimcramer Please compare IFR of covid in children to recent avg flu IFR. For young people, covid is much much less dangerous than flu. It isn’t a conspiracy theory to say so.
1326144878896615425 2020-11-10 20:49:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DublinLiving Grouping Sweden together with the other countries that experienced similar deaths per million in March-April is completely logical. The fact that Norway and Finland (and Japan and Viet Nam and all of Africa) largely avoided being hit at all is also interesting and worthy of study
1326141471821598720 2020-11-10 20:35:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DublinLiving That isn’t circular logic, no matter how many “??” you use. Are you sure you’re a scientist? If you compare SWE to the other countries that were similarly hard hit in the first wave, they are outperforming. Which is why Marc, who is a fan of harsh lockdowns, is trashing SWE.
1326127081902792704 2020-11-10 19:38:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DublinLiving Come on, you know this. Norway never got hit at all in the Spring.  Sweden got hit hard, just like UK, IT, FR and BE, and it’s different approach has led to a very different result. But again, you know that, you’re being obtuse.
1326013714747764736 2020-11-10 12:08:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Alternate headline: “Sweden suffering 0.8 deaths per million per day”
1326007129732493313 2020-11-10 11:41:50 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Right, but also: the votes for the other guy are overrepresented in the form that half the country believes is susceptible to mass fraud.
1326000929125130241 2020-11-10 11:17:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra You should actually read the declaration, it isn’t long. They certainly don’t advocate something ridiculous like letting the virus “burn through the population”. They merely state principles that were universally held by the epi community prior to 2020.
1325997698210729985 2020-11-10 11:04:21 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra Do you hear yourself? We must wear masks “in public”, so we can all show each other how much we care. So we wear masks OUTSIDE!? If anything, you should promise me you’ll wear one at home, since that’s where the virus transmits. But no, you’ll get no such assurance from me.
1325996826898599939 2020-11-10 11:00:54 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra How do you think a vaccine w 90% effectiveness like the Pfizer vaccine will work? That’s immunity that will also protect the 10%, plus anyone who doesn’t take it. That’s the “herd immunity” you claim not to believe in.
1325993505534210048 2020-11-10 10:47:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra There is no such thing as “stamping out” a highly contagious respiratory virus that is circulating widely. It is a fantasy.
1325993105582067712 2020-11-10 10:46:06 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra This is the “mainstream” practical advice we should follow. Science isn’t a democracy, but this has been signed by 45,000 medical practitioners and public health scientists.   https://t.co/WkifctNGfo
1325991689329250307 2020-11-10 10:40:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra 1) that means 1/3 of excess deaths were caused by something ELSE. What do you think that was? Hint: look at overdoses, suicides and failure to thrive. And 2) The only relevant question currently is whether excess people are dying NOW. CDC data is slow, but I think they aren’t.
1325990875437146113 2020-11-10 10:37:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra It says people suffering from a relentlessly hyped disease recover physically and continue to suffer anxiety and other psychiatric harm. Scroll up, I’ve been pointing out your hypochondria/OCD for days. Of course that’s happening, but it isn’t “long covid”, it’s mental illness.
1325990430530539520 2020-11-10 10:35:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra Your argument: Isolating A PORTION of society won’t work, but isolating AN ENTIRE society will (and won’t have consequences that make the cure worse than the disease).   That’s wrong, and in its effect on children, it’s also evil.
1325988950234849280 2020-11-10 10:29:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra This literally says the sequelae being suffered are psychiatric. What point do you think you are making?
1325988449342664704 2020-11-10 10:27:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra “Cases” based on PCR mean nothing. Sadly, about 2.8MM die every year, so deaths of old/sick people are only meaningful as a statistical matter if they die at a higher rate than is typical. Can you tell me whether people are currently dying at a higher rate than is typical?
1325976609325715456 2020-11-10 09:40:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra No prior pandemic has behaved in this manner (ie virtually no impact on &lt;18, little impact on &lt;55 and an extreme impact on &gt;65). Its a lucky break that makes a targeted response feasible and appropriate. Protect vulnerable populations, let kids be kids.
1325971948011204610 2020-11-10 09:22:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BradJonas9 @Gregg_Sarra It’s NOT complicated.

1325958785404461056 2020-11-10 08:29:44 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra How about you and @newsday address: the 000s of NY kids driving elsewhere to play contact sports since April, with zero impact?  That about 1 person dies for every MILLION in NYS day from covid. The terrible irreversible damage to kids from loss of school and sports FOR NO REASON

Look at any school’s numbers on LI. Remarkably low. You think that’s because of masks? Or keeping a few feet apart? It’s bc kids don’t spread covid, even if they test “positive”. It’s asinine to believe that at this point.
1325928673413828610 2020-11-10 06:30:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gregg_Sarra Right. And apparently, when they come back, the throgs neck bridge kills the covid, bc all those kids come home, hang out with friends, go to school, etc. For the thousandth time: COVID DOESNT AFFECT KIDS!!

As I’ve pointed out to you before, your complaints just sound like garden-variety claustrophobia and OCD. Again, sports or not, kids decided covid was BS 6 months ago, and have been climbing all over each other every day. Covid doesn’t affect kids.

Massive numbers of people who are not sick are getting tested bc they are required to by their jobs, schools etc. They have no symptoms. They are not “sick” by any reasonable definition. Do you not know this?  It’s been in the news.

NYS making different decisions and harming kids based on fear.

1322582054782029825 2020-11-01 00:51:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYGovCuomo So it doesn’t track my location, but does track and log every person I am in contact with? That is probably a greater invasion of my privacy than tracking my location. For a virus that my age bracket survives 99.99% of the time? No thanks.

If kids don’t get sick at all, and older people are also surviving it OK, can my sons play football now? Please?  https://t.co/euIUis1upF
1322265107435384832 2020-10-31 03:52:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq And by the way, this anecdotal story in @nytimes describing lack of serious illness in hard-hit NYC sounds a lot like what the Swedes are experiencing. Cases, but very few deaths.  https://t.co/euIUisj5hd
1322264185879879683 2020-10-31 03:48:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Yeah right. No one is falling for this. It isn’t isn’t 5 weeks, it’s now 10 weeks and counting since case numbers began rising, with no sign of significant death. &lt;4 deaths per day in the entire country.

This basically came through NYC briefly in April, many of the kids who had it didn’t even test positive for covid, and it hasn’t come back since.

Alison is under the misapprehension that children and young people can suffer from some kind of organ damage from covid. I don’t think the sequelae your elderly parents are suffering are relevant to that discussion.

1321229414177427459 2020-10-28 07:16:54 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq How well Sweden did in the early months of the pandemic is absolutely beside the point. Marc, because he is a liar, is painting Sweden as a worsening disaster TODAY. That is indisputably wrong.
1321218423150563329 2020-10-28 06:33:13 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq Because Sweden was hit extremely hard and didn’t lock down. Countries that were NOT hit hard and didn’t lock down are not relevant.
1321217994605973506 2020-10-28 06:31:31 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @thereal_truther This is only the second time, and I have no idea what constituencies he is speaking to or what his motivations may be. I know that it is the goal of the pro-lockdownino-fascists such as yourself to try to characterize Sweden as a failure. Sweden is a model. And you know it:  https://t.co/5AJvJfaQsV
1321206370847334407 2020-10-28 05:45:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @thereal_truther You didn’t ask, so don’t be a twit. I read the whole article, it’s clear that Sweden is having a casedemic, same as rest of Europe. You two lockdown fetishists are just gross at this point.
1321199279826968580 2020-10-28 05:17:09 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @thereal_truther He knows the same thing I do, which is that covid death in Sweden is essentially zero. You guys are buffoons.
1321193116943208455 2020-10-28 04:52:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq In graphical terms, this is what @zorinaq refers to as a “critical point”:  https://t.co/nKcJGvecWl
1321192640403197965 2020-10-28 04:50:46 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq Don’t change the subject. Try to defend the sociopathic notion I was responding to, that Sweden is at a “critical point” because 21 people, virtually all elderly and ill, died last week in a nation of 10 million.
1321188942583136257 2020-10-28 04:36:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Rational_Ground would be great to see this study get more attention, please retweet  https://t.co/ic1yfu9Nzv
1321188643139190790 2020-10-28 04:34:53 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @zorinaq 0.3 deaths/million/day last week, schools and businesses open, no idiotic mask mandates and lockdowns. What were they wrong about?
1321188073787559938 2020-10-28 04:32:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Huge Wisconsin study of HS athletes found lower rate of transmission of covid than among the same age population generally. @kevindolan53 @Joespags12 @NYSPHSAA #LetThemPlayFootball  https://t.co/ic1yfu9Nzv
1321182787085414401 2020-10-28 04:11:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq 3 deaths per day last week is not a second wave, it’s a ripple. Stop lying.
1321147401667776516 2020-10-28 01:51:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> The lockdown enthusiasts are working overtime, but Sweden isn’t cooperating. 21 people died of covid last week, all undoubtedly age 75+. In a nation of 10mm people. 21 deaths is a “critical point”. Honestly, it’s beyond parody at this point.
1321111105322815490 2020-10-27 23:26:47 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EJGSH @bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump Only if you assume they actually care about the election, rather than enriching their own political and media buying operations. It’s a scam.
1321103995902058497 2020-10-27 22:58:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gay4Pizza @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast I also like this new “breathe shallow” strategy. Seems sustainable.
1321102754736181248 2020-10-27 22:53:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Gay4Pizza @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast I contend there is no evidence masks provide “control” over covid 19. There are many hilarious examples of jurisdictions issuing mask mandates, followed by skyrocketing case #s. We are specifically discussing the success of Sweden, where they don’t where masks. What’s your issue?
1321099402547789826 2020-10-27 22:40:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast Oh well.  https://t.co/EygUnlktqb
1321069587404914689 2020-10-27 20:41:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @david_j_roth @RandBallsStu This “Brett Kavanaugh is a bad lawyer” take is hot
1321051715009941506 2020-10-27 19:30:47 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast “Control a pandemic” is a contradiction in terms. You people aren’t practicing science, you’re engaged in witchcraft. Your masks let us know who the witches are.
1320922455926546432 2020-10-27 10:57:09 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @neontaster If they ever re-make the Producers, this will be the plot. Group of creeps take a bunch of money from rich political novices and flush 90% of it down the toilet, skimming off 10% for themselves. No one knows the wiser.
1320914223254458371 2020-10-27 10:24:26 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MollyJongFast Offensive. People who are not ladies also get abortions.
1320879959729180677 2020-10-27 08:08:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @michaelmina_lab @praeternational Not trolling, and that is doubtless sometimes true (that a person who tests pos w a CT of 40 was once actually infected with covid). But is it always/usually true? Or can some incidental exposure w/o infection lead to such a positive test also?
1320856879556370437 2020-10-27 06:36:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast Yeah yeah, 2 more weeks. There are only a few dozen people in the ICU in the whole city of Stockholm, a city of 1mm people. Swedish deaths have been at or below baseline for weeks. The whole country is an object lesson that you apocalyptic fascists have this entirely wrong.
1320846125641904132 2020-10-27 05:53:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast The “second wave” in Europe has been going on for weeks or months. Very few deaths, hospitals are fine. Stop lying and rooting for the virus.
1320836455032365057 2020-10-27 05:15:25 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Hilariously, ⁦@UFT⁩ seems to have posted a positive return-to-school story which is dated 10 days from now, two days AFTER Election Day. Hat tip to ⁦@kerpen⁩.   https://t.co/BfWmJHIVhU
1320833796086943747 2020-10-27 05:04:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Charliejuk @MollyJongFast Would like to hear how you arrived at that conclusion. They have averaged single digit deaths per day for months now, in a nation of 10mm people. You should broaden the scope of media you consume. People like Molly are lying to you because they hate the President.  https://t.co/anbND05t4o
1320830229523402755 2020-10-27 04:50:41 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MollyJongFast Now do Sweden. They never put masks on in the first place.
1320812618228129793 2020-10-27 03:40:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @jivetimes @zorinaq It’s not “odd,” it’s selective and dishonest. The Swedish result has been remarkable, ESPECIALLY considering their starting point, and their approach should be followed elsewhere.
1320804892215283713 2020-10-27 03:10:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq That chart and the sentence in parents just calls attention to how dishonest you are. Sweden was hard hit in April, and is now the model for how to continue to live normally with covid. And the pro-lockdown left despises them for it.
1320737296367443974 2020-10-26 22:41:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kerpen Just one week til Election Day, so it’s time to start turning the narrative around. It’s a supertanker of utter horseshit, so it doesn’t stop on a dime.
1320736437302644736 2020-10-26 22:37:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> PhD in microbiology . . . Attributing ALL excess death in 25-44 age cohort to covid. This is a level of dishonesty that borders on the sociopathic.

1320377631175528449 2020-10-25 22:52:13 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @justinbaragona @jaketapper no honest epidemiologist would claim “containment” of an infections respiratory virus would ever be possible at this level of prevalence. It’s a mass delusion, and you are propagating it. You should be ashamed.
1320344869693513728 2020-10-25 20:42:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> This is madness. Demonstrates a purely evil desire to permanently control over all of us. The really interesting question is why so many people (mostly on the left but not entirely) have so willingly become fascist soldiers in this totalitarian covid project.
1320335759199580160 2020-10-25 20:05:50 +0800 <hughjassdevice> IFR for young people is 1/10 of flu. And hospital capacity hasn’t been an issue anywhere in US or Europe since the very early days of the pandemic. Stop rooting for the virus. Stop lying.
1320162280177389569 2020-10-25 08:36:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq No, you are trying to scare people w/ bar charts and nonsense. Old people die, as you well know. Even if ICU admissions were 10 times this, it wouldn’t mean anything except covid is now an endemic illness that kills the old and infirm in SWE but no one else. Excess death is zero
1320150254717722624 2020-10-25 07:48:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @PowerliftingJ @zorinaq Avg deaths in Sweden have been normal for MONTHS. If you wanted to make a point about runaway covid, it is literally the last country you would talk about. You are trying to justify lockdown by attacking the country demonstrating lockdowns don’t work.   Please stop.
1320136043769769985 2020-10-25 06:52:14 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @SapiensWell @zorinaq Seventeen people, my friend. So 1.7 per million. Total. Honestly, pick a different hill to die on, Sweden is a miracle.
1320135630878363651 2020-10-25 06:50:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Just stop at the first sentence. You have a medium-sized country where virtually no one is seriously ill with covid, nationwide. Who cares about anything else? You should probably focus on poisonings, or perhaps drownings, in Sweden. Both are likely to be of similar significance.
1320106878181978112 2020-10-25 04:56:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq This says 17 people were admitted to the ICU in Sweden last week. Seventeen! In the whole country! Why do you think this makes your point? Sweden is a truly remarkable covid containment story.

1319670491033047051 2020-10-24 00:02:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki @Sean_McG_ @pounsey Except that we are literally living on the slippery slope right now, where we started with masks, and acquiesced in the absence of evidence, and govts have proceeded w/ crushing lockdowns, school closures, churches, etc. if we said no to masks, things would have been different.
1319665005999067137 2020-10-23 23:40:30 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Incredible that this is what the @nytimes puts out, when they could have written this fascinating story: “Whole Wealthy Family on Upper East Side is Mentally Ill, being Enabled by Incredulous Medical Establishment Stubbornly Ignoring Science because of Liberal Political Bias”
1319661202264498184 2020-10-23 23:25:23 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Brown_SPH @HarvardEthics @MSFTIssues Seems like an Ivy League school of public health could contribute more than just adding to the case hysteria. Why don’t you discuss how few people are being hospitalized or dying? Or whether PCR tests identifying “cases” of non-infectious and asymptomatic people is productive?

1319641057244696576 2020-10-23 22:05:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DavidSteadson Serious question: this is obviously massively misleading, since it omits months of far higher ICU burden than exists currently. But WHY have you decided to put out such blatant misinfo? In the US, I would just assume you hate the President. But curious to know your motivation.
1319624814273888258 2020-10-23 21:00:47 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @redsteeze This may be dumber than the people who thought he was talking about the actual 4-legged mammal.

1319617836004814848 2020-10-23 20:33:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Dr_CMGreer read your quotes in the article below, and I’m wondering if you are only concerned about the unfair conflict of interest presented by public employee money in politics when it harms democrats?  https://t.co/B4F4i6lyQl
1319615318998831105 2020-10-23 20:23:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> It has been hilarious watching Democrats like @KevinThomasNY wake up to how unfair and undemocratic it is when public employee union participate in politics.  https://t.co/B4F4i6lyQl

1319494774286581762 2020-10-23 12:24:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @chrislhayes Based on how many what CT threshold?  PCR tests pick up low levels of virus. Focus on hospitalizations and deaths only.

1319313201310420993 2020-10-23 00:22:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Is there currently any excess death in Sweden? How are hospitals and ICUs?

1318965128101060610 2020-10-22 01:19:26 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin This 4-month old article just says there was excess death in excess of identified covid cases. It doesn’t provide evidence they were uncounted covid cases. Many argue these are deaths of despair from lockdown, including @ScottGottliebMD in an interview this morning.
1318964510493999104 2020-10-22 01:16:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin Your account shows a similar amount of ideological “bias”, you just disagree with her. Show that her data are wrong or concede they are accurate.
1318961131508170753 2020-10-22 01:03:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin Good question. You should follow Jennifer, she’s been tracking this in Florida for months. Yesterday, they assigned deaths to 44 different days going back to July 11. I think we can assume that most of those folks are “in the ground” already. And this is going on nationally.
1318951859617472513 2020-10-22 00:26:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin States everywhere are re-characterizing hundreds of deaths from prior periods as covid. Presumably all of those people are also in the ground. Why is your family’s experience different?
1318946406086868992 2020-10-22 00:05:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @RickK101 @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin WebMD, faithful friend to hypochondriacs everywhere.
1318944655187247107 2020-10-21 23:58:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrEricDing And @ScottGottliebMD, no covid conspiracy theorist, said today on CNBC that those are deaths of despair from lockdown.
1318944270427000833 2020-10-21 23:56:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin How can you be sure that the relevant state has not counted your relatives as covid deaths when they are in overdrive going back and re-characterizing deaths every day?
1318943615142424576 2020-10-21 23:53:57 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @RickK101 @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin I’m sorry you are bald. As a #bigdata professional, do you think it’s relevant that virtually no one else has identified baldness as a covid symptom?
1318941290449539077 2020-10-21 23:44:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @matthewamiller If the tweet is inaccurate in its central point, why haven’t you deleted it? An apology is useless if you are effectively continuing the error by not deleting.
1318939484965249025 2020-10-21 23:37:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin Are you sure? US states have been doing death certificate matching and revising death counts retroactively for months.
1318937831063040005 2020-10-21 23:30:58 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @stacey_rudin Right now in most states in the US, even among people who think they have covid and seek a test, less than 1 in 20 do (in NY where I live it’s 1 in 50 or less). Why do you think your relatives had it?
1318922299047890944 2020-10-21 22:29:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @AlistairHaimes And smaller, with less ventilation. If I was TRYING to spread Covid, this is what I would design. It’s madness.

1318895503824793600 2020-10-21 20:42:46 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @CalicoRunning @Abhmin @TPCarney @JonahDispatch This is one anecdote, not meaningful. Study of 200K kids in 47 states found 0.13% case rate among kids and 0.24% among staff. An order of magnitude below nationwide case rate. In other words, teachers are MUCH LESS likely to get COVID than other professions. Open the schools!
1318894794672902150 2020-10-21 20:39:57 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @daysathome @CalicoRunning @Abhmin @TPCarney @JonahDispatch No, they aren’t. Google the Oster study of 200,000 kids across 47 states. Case rate of 0.13% among students and 0.24% among staff, an order of magnitude lower than current overall U.S. case rate is 2.6%.
1318893650294734848 2020-10-21 20:35:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @beckygxmino You know those aren’t food, right?
1318888762022166528 2020-10-21 20:15:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Abhmin @TPCarney @JonahDispatch Well, this data show kids aren’t spreading covid in schools. Do you have different data that show teachers are catching covid in schools? Because in NY at least, covid data is available by school and district and the numbers are incredible low.
1318887516905361408 2020-10-21 20:11:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @benshapiro This is too generous. They know what they’re doing, they aren’t “discovering” anything.

In order “to promote the general welfare”, the founders drafted a constitution that strictly limits what government is permitted to do, in order to protect each citizen’s personal liberty (also mentioned in the preamble).

Can you report how many tests actually represent duplicates?  How about the average CT levels for positive tests in Chicago?
1318609336030167040 2020-10-21 01:45:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kerpen No, “Indirect” covid deaths are also covid deaths, to these people. They don’t see how their ideas could be at fault for any of this.

1318222828865572871 2020-10-20 00:09:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq This shows current death rates of 3 deaths per million people per day.

1317473081837965312 2020-10-17 22:30:34 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @karlprosser @kylamb8 So to be clear, you are taking the view that widely varying global mitigation efforts (voluntary and mandated) that had questionable effects on covid COMPLETELY and UNIFORMLY eliminated the flu everywhere on Earth for 2020?
1317430859616628737 2020-10-17 19:42:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @TimothyLash Wow, almost looks like if you have already had a significant covid-19 outbreak in your jurisdiction, you are somewhat protected from future outbreaks. I herd that has a name, but I can’t think of it.
1317423422612344832 2020-10-17 19:13:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ThadMichaels We can think the virus is “real” and also think that we are being terribly misled by govt and media surrounding it. Just one example: the shrieking about “cases”, based on a PCR test that asp captures people who are not and will never be sick or contagious. That is “nonsense”.
1317308632833396737 2020-10-17 11:37:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Really good point about how to think about Sweden.

Hand washing and ordering takeout didn’t work on covid, but it completely zeroed out 2020 flu? Come on doc.

There is also a LOT of well-founded mistrust of authority right now, which leads to some hot tempers. Doesn’t seem fair to make Kyle responsible for those responses. The flu thing is fascinating, and Kyle’s work illuminating it is valuable.

1317193465340530688 2020-10-17 03:59:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kylamb8 What does “pushed out” flu mean in this context?  Something like “provoked some kind of immune response or other bodily mechanism that is powerfully resistant to” flu?
1317188465524703234 2020-10-17 03:39:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @carrtmannnn @kylamb8 Well, its an extraordinary circumstance. Seems outlandish that covid would eliminate flu (by whatever mechanism). Equally outlandish, in my mind, is that we ordered takeout and washed our hands a lot and ended flu, globally. So I look forward to his data analysis as well as yours
1317180163143118849 2020-10-17 03:06:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @carrtmannnn @kylamb8 Would be happy to take your recommendations on good, independent experts on the topic.
1317177837770727424 2020-10-17 02:57:23 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @carrtmannnn @kylamb8 The absence of flu in 2020 is really interesting, and the possible reasons for it are fascinating. We should all be engaged in an effort to increase understanding. Your focus on credentials is not helpful and limits the conversation. Judge his conclusions not his diploma.
1317174466741501952 2020-10-17 02:43:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @carrtmannnn @kylamb8 No idea. I judge his work on its merits, as should you. You certainly haven’t established any bona fides that would lead anyone to discount his work product in favor of yours.

They need to give our boys and girls clear certainty on what they have planned. Frankly, there are some athletes who are prepared to move out of state in order to get clarity on sports. Thank you for being out front on this issue.
1317156383763156999 2020-10-17 01:32:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Noahpinion Seems like a really interesting debate that we could all benefit from. @AlexBerenson was ready amd willing to take the other side. But instead of continuing to debate, you blocked him. What are you afraid of?

But putting it up to reduced social distancing is absurd. For one thing, kids haven’t locked down to the same extent as adults at all, since they basically don’t get covid, so they should be spreading flu, but aren’t, AT ALL
1317116043412852736 2020-10-16 22:51:50 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @kylamb8 The word “indirect” is going to get a massive workout in the next few months. Not sure it’s up to the task.

Lockdown kills Swedes too!

You are a fundamentally dishonest person. /1

Keep in mind, this disease is not dangerous for almost anyone under age 40.

1316923384811368449 2020-10-16 10:06:16 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @SunetraGupta @MartinKulldorff @jeffreyatucker @stacey_rudin I have no idea, but either do you. Japan had almost no covid, so those suicides were not “caused by covid”, even “indirectly” (your magic word).

1314698619115786240 2020-10-10 06:45:51 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @chrislhayes Many of those deaths occurred days or weeks ago and are the result of death certificate revisions.

Right now, NY has ~zero covid deaths, and our kids can’t go to full time school or play sports. There are no numbers low enough for @NYGovCuomo.  WAKE UP!!
1314695298376237057 2020-10-10 06:32:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @chrislhayes What is the cycle threshold of the PCR tests you receive? Because if it is over ~30, even a positive test is likely meaningless.

1314055305739857920 2020-10-08 12:09:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki E.g. FL reported 137 deaths today, but very few occurred today. They will go back on future days and add more deaths, but very unlikely they get to 137 for today. So a person (you) who says 137 people in FL died today IS WRONG. And NYS doesn’t even REPORT date of death.
1314052123181670400 2020-10-08 11:56:54 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Of course it doesn’t lead to a difference in totals, but it means any asshole, such as yourself, who says x people died today, is wrong. Obviously. The only way to have an accurate picture is by date of death, and states are making that difficult to determine.
1314050235568721921 2020-10-08 11:49:24 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Seriously? Your hatred of the President is melting your brain.  https://t.co/NfmhhlmarY

1312454233287925760 2020-10-04 02:07:28 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Prof_JTaylor What does it mean when they delete a death? Why would that happen other than the occasional clerical error?
1312444569758261248 2020-10-04 01:29:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @wesbury I agree, although I am also sympathetic to the argument that if they didn’t die of covid, they wouldn’t be “excess” deaths. But at the margin, hospitals are certainly doing this. We will know how common this is when we see how below baseline-deaths we fall in the coming months.
1312438215865847808 2020-10-04 01:03:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @GeneSohoForum @wesbury That would also pick up excess deaths caused by lockdown
1312436932362694657 2020-10-04 00:58:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @wesbury This is a great pair of charts showing countries were basically lucky or unlucky based on location and other natural factors:
1312435272152358913 2020-10-04 00:52:07 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @robertjsayer @JuliaHB1 @EdConwaySky The standard PCR test for covid is being overcycled to up tons and tons of people with virus remnants who are not sick and can’t make anyone else sick. So when you see “case” data, ask how about the CT level they are using. If &gt;35, the test is basically worthless.
1312434346222120960 2020-10-04 00:48:26 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EdConwaySky What PCR cycle threshold do English health authorities use for a case to be positive?  Anyone reporting case data should be reporting on the amplification being used, as it impacts the likelihood any positive case is an actual infected or infectious person.
1312352209523429382 2020-10-03 19:22:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @StephenKing This is false. Those 850 people died on different days going back to March, but doctors didn’t ascribe the deaths to covid. So state health authorities are going back and matching positive covid tests to patients and re-classifying them as covid deaths. Wake up!
1312218933450207232 2020-10-03 10:32:28 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Newsday What the hell does this even mean: “ . . . all these younger people who are getting sick — and some are passing”?  That statement is absurd and newsday should clarify. Young people are extremely unlikely to be made sick or die from covid.
1312202492302614528 2020-10-03 09:27:08 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @News12LI Should your headline note that “her boyfriend” opened fire on the police and therefore may be less than credible on this point? Do your jobs.
1312135357538824193 2020-10-03 05:00:22 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @thereal_truther What cycle threshold doSwedish health authorities use for a case to be positive?
1312092745394204675 2020-10-03 02:11:02 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Good one
1312052370092830720 2020-10-02 23:30:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Coronavirusgoo1 Does England report its PCR cycle threshold for these cases? If so, we should be reporting CT along with cases data. As reported today, at 35 cycles, 97% of “positive” patients are not sick or infectious.
1311827135938596865 2020-10-02 08:35:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Maybe, just maybe, we can stop referring to this as some radical theory circulated on right-wing blogs.

They’ve been playing for months!! No one got seriously sick. This idiotic “keep people safe” rhetoric is why my kids can’t play HS sports. And it’s wrong.

1311763686990712834 2020-10-02 04:23:29 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrTomFrieden What is your cycle cutoff for using the term “infection”?  Because at 30+ cycles or more of amplification, a patient probably isn’t “infected” at all. He or she certainly isn’t contagious. Let’s try to be specific. Our freedom is at stake.
1311744556673662977 2020-10-02 03:07:28 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @chrislhayes The virus exists, it’s just not particularly deadly, or even dangerous, and doesn’t justify locking down our society and destroying the lives of children (or are effectively immune from it).

1311425542252625923 2020-10-01 05:59:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @camille4242 Hit hard = high numbers of deaths per million. Again, are you looking at the chart?  NYC’s blue bar represents the worst result on Earth. Someplace called Starr County Texas had almost as much death, population adjusted, with extremely low population density.
1311424381038583808 2020-10-01 05:55:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @camille4242 You are correct that NYC is very different than the other regions on this chart. I agree. The point is that those incredibly sparsely populated areas were hit almost as hard. Not sure how you can conclude “density matters”.

1311038850068819978 2020-09-30 04:23:14 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @IdiotTracker @AlexBerenson This isn’t true, of course. Most of the deaths reported in FL this week are deaths from weeks or months ago “with” covid but reported as something else, and then retroactively revised by the state medical examiner.
1311010827575664646 2020-09-30 02:31:53 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @andrewbostom Absolute blockbuster. Means vast majority of positive “cases” in US are meaningless RNA fragments. It’s like we have been finding Individual pieces of hay and calling each one a “haystack”. Calls into question the hospitalization and death data as well, if based on PCR alone.

1310960399865520130 2020-09-29 23:11:30 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @dockaurG I absolutely agree, but when politics and media narratives drive decisions affecting my kids’ lives (e.g. schools, school sports) its impossible to insulate from it. In NY, where there is ~0 death now, even private schools have to kneel before @NYGovCuomo. We are failing our kids
1310951022202966019 2020-09-29 22:34:14 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DobryJane @AliNouriPhD YOU said we were “killing people”, which is obviously false in NY bc ~0 people are dying. And these @usatoday anecdotes from the anxiety community about #longcovid aren’t science. Just the new lamebrain excuse to keep punishing my kids til Nov 3. STOP LYING, let the kids go back.

And yet @NYGovCuomo gets to decide whether my sons’ private religious school can play football. And I think our consenting to masks let them know we’d consent to anything.

1310665735627313156 2020-09-29 03:40:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @AliNouriPhD Since 42% of “cases” report no symptoms whatsoever, the total number of infections in children is almost certainly much higher than 277k.

Europe’s excess deaths are back to (or likely below) zero and US deaths are headed that way. We are panicking over “cases” of asymptomatic and non-infectious patients. It’s been over for weeks.
1310407956014551042 2020-09-28 10:36:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DanielTobias_ @TheEliKlein @ZacBissonnette Please, please, try to provide some proof of this “closed windows make kids sick nonsense”.  Schools around the world have opened with no significant issues at all. Covid doesn’t make kids sick.
1310376571715411970 2020-09-28 08:31:34 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSPHSAA This is what happens when we let brain dead un-fireable bureaucrats have power our kids’ lives.
1310375279550963720 2020-09-28 08:26:26 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @NYSPHSAA So then let them play!! NYS is currently averaging 0.3 covid deaths per million people per day in the entire state. That’s less than 6 people a day in the whole state. And virtually no kids even get sick from covid. And yet our boys can’t play football?!
1310334852269568019 2020-09-28 05:45:48 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @devisridhar Behavior of Sweden is not “theoretical”. It is textbook pandemic response as provided by authorities such as CDC. What authorities in countries that have locked down have done is the theoretical, or experimental, response of locking down, and it failed miserably.
1310226844768182272 2020-09-27 22:36:37 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Absolutely right. Also: NO ONE in the pro-lockdown crowd can plausibly explain how NYC went from worst-hit on Earth to its current ~zero level of covid, if not population resistance of some kind. They want you to believe @NYGovCuomo cured covid w/ masks and takeout-only dining.

1310034097134284800 2020-09-27 09:50:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Hold2LLC Hey @NYGovCuomo @NYSPHSAA: NY is averaging 0.3 deaths per million per day. What possible metric could we achieve that would allow my sons to play high school football this year? What will it take?
1310005724446162951 2020-09-27 07:57:58 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @aginnt @MartinKulldorff @SWAtlasHoover @NYGovCuomo You still need to explain the shape of this chart, replicated over and over and over again. You have no explanation.  https://t.co/ksl2PlL4gZ
1310004370860396544 2020-09-27 07:52:35 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @aginnt @MartinKulldorff @SWAtlasHoover @NYGovCuomo You have me baffled. NY state is currently averaging 0.3 deaths per million people per day. Relative to where NY was, that is “stopped”. Sweden also. Finland also. Manaus also. The Diamond Princess also. And the ONLY explanation that isn’t ridiculous is population resistance.
1309998682637578240 2020-09-27 07:29:59 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @FreedomLvr2020 @Hold2LLC I think it has more to do with how stupid he thinks WE are.
1309998388876845062 2020-09-27 07:28:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Seems like a pretty basic logical phallacy for a Jesuit to commit— just because Catholics may have overcome anti-Catholic bias to be confirmed does not mean such bias did not exist.
1309997093289963522 2020-09-27 07:23:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BuckSexton Basically, we would be better off if we wound back the law 120 years or so, and then added back the civil rights act. If this is a step in that direction, bravo.
1309996058194464768 2020-09-27 07:19:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @aginnt @MartinKulldorff @SWAtlasHoover @NYGovCuomo Funny that “we don’t know” if population immunity plays a role in stopping the virus (although you offer no other explanation when asked) but you are CERTAIN that Finland’s brilliant, heroic NPIs stopped covid cold.
1309992554797109248 2020-09-27 07:05:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Amy_Siskind How many Americans died of covid today?
1309992043901587458 2020-09-27 07:03:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @aginnt @MartinKulldorff @SWAtlasHoover Actual level of death obviously varies a huge amount. Finland (or VietNam) gets off easy, NYC (or Peru) gets rocked. But even hard hit places burn out way before 70% herd immunity. Fauci wants us to believe that’s from listening to @NYGovCuomo, hand washing and ordering takeout.

1309971760889163777 2020-09-27 05:43:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Njmomnl @Hold2LLC I think an “outbreak” of cases with minimal serious disease, in a statistically tiny community within NYS’s 19 million people, is an item of tabloid news interest but not interesting epidemiologically.

Just have to keep telling anyone who will listen. Thanks for the work you’re doing. Keep it up!

Your quarrel is with the TEACHERS UNIONS and their allies on the left who are abusing those small children. All kids should be in school. All athletes should be playing.

Or is there another, better explanation that isn’t pure pro-Cuomo witchcraft?
1309596463232684032 2020-09-26 04:51:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @matthewjdowd How many people died of covid in the US yesterday? (Hint: it isn’t the number deaths that was REPORTED yesterday).

1308370845727969282 2020-09-22 19:41:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @daveweigel I think Senators are willing to reverse themselves BECAUSE of voter sentiment. R voters, after Kavanaugh and impeachment, want the gloves all the way off and don’t want to hear about Senate niceties. (Dem voters want the gloves off too, of course. We are in an ugly place).
1308247575158550530 2020-09-22 11:31:42 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @AliNouriPhD Please post your ICU data.
1308247259885248512 2020-09-22 11:30:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @FightCOVIDMyths @AlexBerenson I understand. I live in NY. Here, or in NJ, half the deaths or more are in that population. It is laughable on its face that, even as an average, covid deaths cost people 10 years.

1308073410694647811 2020-09-21 23:59:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @FightCOVIDMyths @AlexBerenson Life-years lost is an absolutely legitimate measure of the impact of disease like covid. If it only kills people WHO ARE DYING, that is relevant to measures taken to mitigate it. It’s not “heartless” to argue that kids, who don’t get sick from covid, should be living normally.

1308050499443339264 2020-09-21 22:28:36 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @FightCOVIDMyths @AlexBerenson It is patently false that there is massive excess mortality (or ANY excess mortality) “right now”. And we don’t know what number of deaths during the lockdown will be attributed to lockdown effects.

But the % of excess from covid, versus failure to seek care, neglect, overdose, abuse, iatrogenic cases etc is unknown. And the death laundering going on is manipulating the data further. Now what about PCR over-cycling?

It is definitely fraud considering the covid “positive” test was at 40 cycles of amplification.

If they are the 20th worst country on Earth, they will probably be the ~10th worst in Europe, with no lockdown, no closing primary schools, no mask mandates and their people’s freedom intact. Their leaders will have a lot to be proud of.
1305564355543683079 2020-09-15 01:49:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @pbreit @aginnt But their epidemic is over, with almost no disease at all, and it isn’t yet over in other countries. Would not be surprised if their final rank is far better than this.

1305560853241049093 2020-09-15 01:35:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> Hey @ASlavitt, here’s a great thread covering the reasons the Utah study you touted this morning is complete crap. Try harder.
1305522260766330881 2020-09-14 23:02:17 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ASlavitt Do you have the PCR amplification levels for these “cases”? Is anyone (ANYONE?) in the hospital?
1305522021703573505 2020-09-14 23:01:20 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ASlavitt Where is the evidence for this claim? First I’ve seen this reported anywhere. (And since you’re a known fabricator, I’d like to see some receipts)
1305498220211113984 2020-09-14 21:26:45 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ASlavitt @CDCgov Stop lying. This isn’t “breaking” it’s been out for days. It is also far more ambiguous than you make it sound. And it is TWO childcare centers. There are literally millions of kids in school and childcare around the world. And covid metrics are dropping like a rock everywhere.

Has to be pop immunity.

We are hoping that, just as they have opened schools more fully, they take the brave stance of letting our kids play sports.

1304178954161528832 2020-09-11 06:04:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @thereal_truther @MLevitt_NP2013 How was your published forecast?  Please post it. His POINT, which he made when the sunbelt states were supposedly raging out of control, that excess deaths would go to zero.  And he was right, WITHIN A MARGIN OF 4 DAYS.  I’d say he nailed it.
1304177467733749763 2020-09-11 05:58:33 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki @DavidBahnsen @drutecki9 @AlexBerenson Just to cite one mistake, among so, so many: your statement above that “we're still in the middle of a pandemic.”  That is wrong. Excess deaths reverted to zero in CDC data (through 8/29) published today. Covid is over in the US and has been for a couple weeks.

I attended a “top” public school system, and it sucked, and only reason I went there was a powerful union dictated that all my family’s education $ was paid in taxes to the public school system. Scam.

Others have done great work on stark difference in performance between charter schools vs public schools (eg in NYC), student population decided by lottery, housed in same building!). Unions are the problem.

1303337863736635393 2020-09-08 22:22:16 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Sic_Utere @LPeterP @alaynatreene I live in the NE US, where public schools are strangled by corrupt unions that block innovation and choice, harming kids. Parents should all be given a block amount to educate their kids as they see fit. If a union-run government school is a good choice, parents will choose it.

1302700360495247367 2020-09-07 04:09:03 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki Seems little early to call winners and losers among countries. US obviously did a terrible job at the outset, should have closed border in January. But NOW, knowing what we know about age strats, IFR by age, and that schools don’t really spread it, means your approach is nuts.
1302696230049456128 2020-09-07 03:52:38 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki And all this freakout over asymptomatic cases justifies not sending kids to school full time or letting them play sports. I live in NY, and there are fewer than 400 people in THE WHOLE STATE hospitalized at the moment. And you know their avg age is 80+. It’s nuts.
1302693731783639046 2020-09-07 03:42:43 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki little guy doesn’t need social distance from other kids who are also spectacularly unlikely to get ill. Your wife shd obv be careful, w/in reason. So should all teachers, factoring in age/health. Your solution (every asymptomatic pos case is a cascade of quarantines) is insane.
1302690109544902656 2020-09-07 03:28:19 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @JamesSurowiecki What a waste of time, to protect your son (unbelievably unlikely to get serious illness), other son (same), babysitter (probably same if she’s young) and you and your wife. Moral of this story is for you to maintain social distance from your MiL, and rest of you live your lives.

1302394349846753282 2020-09-06 07:53:04 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @BillHanage Our testing is picking up 40-90% “cases” that aren’t infectious. How is that useful for surveillance purposes.

1302224765101498370 2020-09-05 20:39:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MackayIM 1) They were *probably* infectious at one point. 2) that point may have been as much as ~12 weeks past. 3) contact tracing for that “case” is obviously absurd. 4) calling that +pos test result a “case” indicative of outbreak in a community is closer to voodoo than to science.
1302223317823299585 2020-09-05 20:33:27 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @DrEricDing @euromaestro Why would this be a good measure of aggregate covid deaths? This obviously picks up all lockdown deaths as well, from failure to seek care, overdoses, suicide and violence.
1302222108550987776 2020-09-05 20:28:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MackayIM Simple fix: when reporting new “cases”, it should be standard to also report the number of cycles of amplification used to identify them. US tests using 35-40 cycles are finding people who aren’t sick. US colleges freaking out right now about cases, and NO ONE is hospitalized.

1301307887235616768 2020-09-03 07:55:52 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EricTopol @ScottGottliebMD @stephaniemlee Anyone who “addresses the misconception” of t-cell immunity needs to address NYC: it’s gone up and then down the epidemic curve and now has virtually no covid. Does @ScottGottliebMD think it’s bc we’re being #NYStrong and #NYTough?
1301271255568580609 2020-09-03 05:30:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @WesleyLowery I love it when the light goes on and a liberal realizes (every now and then) that big government is a scam.
1301269926544584705 2020-09-03 05:25:01 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ldavible @MollyJongFast It’s so great that the mayor is moving to an undisclosed location.
1301231875223179267 2020-09-03 02:53:49 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Theresa_Chapple Has anyone studied whether covid causes children to grow a unicorn horn? Because there is equal evidence for that and “long hauler” covid in children.
1301226908361908231 2020-09-03 02:34:05 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EricTopol Any substantive objections to offer?  Or just noise?
1301218465232179205 2020-09-03 02:00:32 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @ddale8 Sure. Do you concede that SOME of the covid deaths were inevitable, covid or not?  And that it is important to determine how many?
1301208843343532039 2020-09-03 01:22:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @HeerJeet Colleges must compete in a marketplace for students. If they go remote, they lose revenue. Public K-12 has a captive student pool that can’t leave and is controlled by a self-serving union with outsized political control, and unions have dictated remote learning. School choice!
1301158607002755072 2020-09-02 22:02:40 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @MarcusBeam1 @space_woke @AlexBerenson “Had CV19” is a mostly useless phrase in this context. The current PCR test in use is over-amplifying so it is picking up levels of virus that can’t make that person sick or make anyone else sick. Does that person “have” covid?
1301147276744765445 2020-09-02 21:17:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @VincentRK If 90% of NYC population is susceptible, why is there virtually NO covid in NYC right now. Massive testing, w/ overly sensitive tests that OVERSTATE infection, and &lt;1% positivity rate. Please, PLEASE don’t tell me its bc we are NY strong and NY tough. Something else going on.
1301146016993939458 2020-09-02 21:12:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @Yellingatcloud1 @hmv666 @joshtpm I am an adult American. I interact with the post office 6 days a week. And I can tell you, if it disappeared tomorrow, the impact on my life would be net positive. Sell the real estate, fire the employees. It shouldn’t exist.
1301129069329870853 2020-09-02 20:05:18 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @hmv666 @joshtpm Further, I would ask you, WHY does the post office need to exist? Why does the govt supply this one commercial service (and no others) in competition with perfectly capable private industry?
1301128652399280129 2020-09-02 20:03:39 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @hmv666 @joshtpm This article does a better job than I could debunking this liberal fantasy:  https://t.co/1l2kLlbzBm

1301016472223977479 2020-09-02 12:37:53 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @wssrstrm @joshtpm Can it be true to that 1. “not everything is a market” and  2. “delivering parcels and letters in exchange for payment” IS a market?
1301015558478008320 2020-09-02 12:34:15 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @joshtpm They provide services to customers in exchange for cash, at a MASSIVE annual loss that would make any private business close up shop. Seems fair to at least CONSIDER whether it’s a business we should be in. I can’t imagine a govt dept I would miss LESS it was vaporized tomorrow.

Any response?  Or am I being “dim”? Or is the nytimes a Trump propaganda organ now?
1300954969768693762 2020-09-02 08:33:30 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @b_tarski @youyanggu You seem disappointed that his model doesn’t predict oceans of death from re-opening schools. You know schools have been open in Europe for weeks now, right?  And in Georgia, and Florida?  Schools don’t spread Covid bc kids don’t spread Covid. Sorry to disappoint.

I live in suburban NYC. There is NO covid here. Empty hospitals and ICUs. Do you think 65% of NYC got covid?  Or the UK, or Sweden. HIT is 20%.

We are testing millions of healthy people, with tests that say they are sick when they aren’t, and we are using that to keep schools, churches and businesses closed. It is INSANE, and it has to stop.

I assume you are now the “get new tests!” Crowd. Maybe you can have a hunger strike for that.

1300890699991265280 2020-09-02 04:18:06 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @EricTopol @AnnalsofIM I have been talking about the aerosolized fart crystals for years. It’s why I won’t eat in a restaurant connected to a mall. Have you seen the people who are willing to defecate in a mall bathroom? Don’t want anything to do with that HVAC situation.
1300890167767707648 2020-09-02 04:16:00 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq @LarryBill1971 @wigglin You must have a PhD in selective reasoning. Is PERU a major international destination also!? Or do lockdowns have no effect, and other factors matter much more?
1300873734367178755 2020-09-02 03:10:41 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Why is it significant that “SWE had the worst outcome in Western Eur, except for the countries that faired worse”? The point is lockdowns have no effect. And we can rightly point to UK, IT, BEL, that locked down tighter than SWE and had worse outcomes.
1300868372347990029 2020-09-02 02:49:23 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq Now add the rest of Western Europe

1300846936229113856 2020-09-02 01:24:12 +0800 <hughjassdevice> @zorinaq The focus only on other Nordics is misleading. Cutting this chart off in July is really misleading since it cuts off the August period, showing that covid is basically over in Sweden.
