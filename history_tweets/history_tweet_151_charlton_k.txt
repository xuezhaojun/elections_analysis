1343659190762549251 2020-12-29 04:44:49 +0800 <charlton_k> I‚Äôm writing this tweet to hold myself accountable for this idea - before the end of 2020, I want to run a 10k. I haven‚Äôt been running in a month or so, so why not go for the big one before the end of the year
1342185641447141382 2020-12-25 03:09:28 +0800 <charlton_k> Finally watching my first Christmas film of the year, went with Carol. Accompanied by a Christmas favourite of mine - southern comfort and irn bru. Happy holidays ‚õÑÔ∏èüéÑ

1341373849007501312 2020-12-22 21:23:41 +0800 <charlton_k> @NorthcoteMatt Thanks Matthew! I hope you‚Äôre well.

1341323190518362112 2020-12-22 18:02:23 +0800 <charlton_k> @micahcline2018 Hi Maike. Very luckily my partner is here with me in the same boat. Thank you for your kind offer however! Have you managed to travel home?
1341307119107227654 2020-12-22 16:58:32 +0800 <charlton_k> I should have been flying home today. Of course, I‚Äôm not. Excuse me whilst I distract myself with some retail therapy. Maybe even another gingerbread latte.
1340771284083486729 2020-12-21 05:29:19 +0800 <charlton_k> Just tried my first ever mince pie. Surprisingly tasty.

1337053002696450056 2020-12-10 23:14:11 +0800 <charlton_k> Anyone else mentally checked out for the Christmas break already? Finding it impossible to start anything new right now. Just very slowly tying up loose ends instead....
1336419594362359808 2020-12-09 05:17:15 +0800 <charlton_k> @richard_vipond I‚Äôm with you on that one!
1336397888654626826 2020-12-09 03:51:00 +0800 <charlton_k> @richard_vipond Naturally, I agree. But unfortunately it was not working at all for me today!
1336288533879906308 2020-12-08 20:36:28 +0800 <charlton_k> Just finished my first attempt at running a class over zoom. I finally understand the struggle. Started off on teams (failed miserably, no functions working properly). Zoom was fine, but left me nervous most of the way through. Technology is not the one.
1335536263965839361 2020-12-06 18:47:13 +0800 <charlton_k> @Dee0871 Wow - what a view. Is this up next to Sham castle? That walking trail has become a favourite of mine

1334570681086988291 2020-12-04 02:50:20 +0800 <charlton_k> @Dee0871 I definitely recommend if you ever find yourself north of the border, it‚Äôs glorious
1334545520614895620 2020-12-04 01:10:21 +0800 <charlton_k> I‚Äôve been writing about the home today, and it‚Äôs making me miss Edinburgh a lot. I never (like many I‚Äôm sure) anticipated moving this year and not being able to go back to visit. Also, fried pizza and chippy sauce ü§§
1334142693337935877 2020-12-02 22:29:39 +0800 <charlton_k> A brilliant seminar from @Dee0871 on prison masculinities. Always grateful for the chance to hear about all the wonderful work happening out there in the prison research world!
1333814964386230273 2020-12-02 00:47:23 +0800 <charlton_k> Dressing in my ‚Äòteaching attire‚Äô (once a week) has become the biggest chore of 2020, I‚Äôve grown so comfortable working from home and wearing lounge wear all day every day.

1329828124918427649 2020-11-21 00:45:06 +0800 <charlton_k> Fantastic presentation from @S_Wright_Crim on ‚Äògetting in, getting on and getting out‚Äô re. Prison research. Refreshing to hear such honest reflections of the emotional challenges in particular. I‚Äôm a big fan of reflexivity, even when it cringes us out üò¨

1329192347289210885 2020-11-19 06:38:45 +0800 <charlton_k> @ClareUytman @HChristie_psych I‚Äôve heard a few folk resort to this, and it seems to do wonders. Feel a strange sense of missing out when I don‚Äôt have immediate access to incoming emails - something to think about for sure... I predict that is not a healthy mindsetü§î
1329185821711273990 2020-11-19 06:12:49 +0800 <charlton_k> @daria_przblsk They must love you haha!
1329185763590811648 2020-11-19 06:12:35 +0800 <charlton_k> @HChristie_psych Very good advice. I think disabling notifications when I‚Äôm done for the day might be wise - although, unhelpful when I‚Äôm not ‚Äòdone‚Äô until this time of night haha
1329182472152764416 2020-11-19 05:59:31 +0800 <charlton_k> Learning how to not feel guilty answering students emails at 10pm is a tough one. Do you disable notifications? Or just let it slide until the morning?
1329111321040785409 2020-11-19 01:16:47 +0800 <charlton_k> @YvonneJewkes presentation on the relationship between light and hope in the prison has been a real highlight of the @CCR_UofA conference this week. Encouraging and brilliant.

1328825546499911683 2020-11-18 06:21:13 +0800 <charlton_k> Tomorrow is a full day of conferences, which means prepare for lots of tweets from me
1328377265084829700 2020-11-17 00:39:54 +0800 <charlton_k> Minor breakthroughs happening today, sometimes a thought pops into your head mid reading you just KNOW you‚Äôre onto something good ‚ú®
1328280359839129602 2020-11-16 18:14:50 +0800 <charlton_k> I‚Äôm not sure if Monday morning quant sessions are a good idea or terrible, it gets it over with for the week but seriously, a Monday morning?
1327017329365016577 2020-11-13 06:36:00 +0800 <charlton_k> @ClareUytman I hope the launch went well. Going to have to get myself a copy of this - will compliment the PhD nicely I reckon üòä
1326917750510522368 2020-11-13 00:00:19 +0800 <charlton_k> Really interesting discussion about the price of parole, and re-entry rates of those who violate these through a lack of funds. The power of third parities in what @reubenjmiller calls ‚Äòa supervised society‚Äô upon release is worth thinking about #SCCJR2020
1326901411104387077 2020-11-12 22:55:23 +0800 <charlton_k> Coffee at the ready. Been looking forward to this all week!
1326085109682987009 2020-11-10 16:51:42 +0800 <charlton_k> If there‚Äôs anything that‚Äôs going to wake me up on my commute this morning, it‚Äôs the uni bus blaring destiny‚Äôs child? Unexpected but not complaining
1325817259999309825 2020-11-09 23:07:21 +0800 <charlton_k> I caught myself falling asleep at my desk today, the after lunch slog is real on Mondays
1324385267088764931 2020-11-06 00:17:08 +0800 <charlton_k> Very informative and engaging session today for the November series - looking forward to the sessions ahead
1324110942171549696 2020-11-05 06:07:04 +0800 <charlton_k> @Dee0871 This has become a life goal
1324073267771179011 2020-11-05 03:37:21 +0800 <charlton_k> After discussing how we got into prison research today with some colleagues, I‚Äôve been reflecting on conversations with my old school teachers who took the time to help me figure out how to pursue all of the things I enjoyed &amp; how pivotal those conversations have turned out to be
1324067183102726144 2020-11-05 03:13:11 +0800 <charlton_k> @the_kav_man2 Been WFH a similar amount of time and my back is beginning to pay for it so yes, I think next up is a chair upgrade!!

1322294106144559104 2020-10-31 05:47:36 +0800 <charlton_k> @ally_ballyb I hear the study suggests the innkeeper is often the loveliest however, so you‚Äôve got that (don‚Äôt fact check this, it‚Äôs definitely right) ‚úåÔ∏è
1322176994512117762 2020-10-30 22:02:15 +0800 <charlton_k> Brilliant and very important discussions happening right now. Looking forward to reading this book.
1320786741326942210 2020-10-27 01:57:52 +0800 <charlton_k> Today I discovered the - until now - untapped potential my brain has when I turn my phone off for a few hours.
1320473463224754176 2020-10-26 05:13:01 +0800 <charlton_k> @linneawallens Tragic, truly. What an excellent save with this tweet however
1319613101172457473 2020-10-23 20:14:15 +0800 <charlton_k> Very encouraging to see this, and well done.
1319326699104968705 2020-10-23 01:16:11 +0800 <charlton_k> A brilliant podcast from @OmarPKhan - if you haven‚Äôt already, get listening! Well done on all that the podcast has achieved so far.

1318595836230750209 2020-10-21 00:52:00 +0800 <charlton_k> Who knew being a PhD student meant my diary filling up months in advance with meetings, conferences, teaching &amp; training programmes. When does one find time to PhD ü§î? #AcademicChatter #AcademicTwitter

1314838916047024128 2020-10-10 16:03:20 +0800 <charlton_k> Next week I am introducing my class to the importance of referencing. Lesson one: read what you reference!!
1314213247428427777 2020-10-08 22:37:09 +0800 <charlton_k> I had the fantastic opportunity of attending the ‚Äòhow to give a good presentation (potential energy)‚Äô workshop lead by @island_41 Brilliantly and enthusiastically delivered, of course. Lots of practical takeaways for PhD students who also find presenting daunting! I recommend.
1313744988350615553 2020-10-07 15:36:28 +0800 <charlton_k> @n_higsonsweeney Wonderful news, congratulations! I hope you find some time to celebrate this weekend

1310980481492684808 2020-09-30 00:31:18 +0800 <charlton_k> Today was eventful. Got lost numerous times, but I did successfully take my first UG tutorial &amp; found the Starbucks on campus. That‚Äôs gotta count for something right? Oh also, the doctoral college is cute:  https://t.co/qBes846DEc
1310639357670326278 2020-09-29 01:55:48 +0800 <charlton_k> @GaryManders I‚Äôll have a look into padlet, thanks for the advice!

1309784639872139265 2020-09-26 17:19:27 +0800 <charlton_k> @NorthcoteMatt Sounds very wise. I find my motivation seriously lacking when working from home but I need to get back into it!
1309580174665617409 2020-09-26 03:46:59 +0800 <charlton_k> I have so many conflicting thoughts about in person teaching this semester, it‚Äôs driving me insane? Seems to be playing on my mind a lot and the semester is only just beginning. I am, to be totally honest, kinda scared &amp; I know many will be feeling the same.
