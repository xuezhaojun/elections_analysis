1301932030180163589 2020-09-05 01:15:59 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @swfc Giant ball cake and the announcement of Jos Luhukay becoming manager awesome 150th birthday year.
1301931361956237312 2020-09-05 01:13:20 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @NikkieHiggs @domhowson Recognised striker? Maybe five years ago 😂
1301931134159327234 2020-09-05 01:12:25 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @domhowson Seems weak like Jos Luhukay and cannot manage strong characters.
1301930244325150721 2020-09-05 01:08:53 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @domhowson Thought they were the ages then.. 45!! Oh shirts.  https://t.co/jDsXrkjhC9

1301755770363695107 2020-09-04 13:35:35 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @TheStarOwls Somewhere between rovrum and barnsley. 😂

1301413234004590593 2020-09-03 14:54:28 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @MReidy1984 @garethkinneavy @domhowson Where did i say i was not happy? Dont put words in my mouth or assume.  Making a comparison on two players and the one that was deemed surplus to requirement seems on paper to be better than the reolacement. Seems odd.
1301411291223994370 2020-09-03 14:46:45 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @MReidy1984 @garethkinneavy @domhowson get ready for the dogs abuse like nuhiu got thats all.

1301409770717487104 2020-09-03 14:40:43 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @MReidy1984 @garethkinneavy @domhowson Nuhiu has a better goal ratio was my point. Fucking nuhiu.
1301408352342282240 2020-09-03 14:35:04 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> @MReidy1984 @garethkinneavy @domhowson IMO hes not really a goal scorer.. Nuhiu has a better goal ratio. 😬
1301407534461448192 2020-09-03 14:31:49 +0800 <ShiregreenOwl> So we sign windyarse and kerchinga and some fans loving it.. Will it be the same fans booing them when they realise theyre not really goal scorers 🤷🏻‍♂️ Big dave has a better ratio than kerchingaling.  https://t.co/3PejnMJZY2
