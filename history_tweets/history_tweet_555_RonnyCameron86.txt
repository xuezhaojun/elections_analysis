This is because non-whites typically don‚Äôt enjoy many predominantly white activities and entertainment such as rock/metal music, hockey, Irish pubs, etc.

No. We need a state of our own. ‚ÄúGoing free‚Äù means absolutely nothing unless we have security and safety in form of our own state and you know it.
1335702965525622784 2020-12-07 05:49:37 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @EuropeanRevolt Kushner, Zuck, etc. Many powerful Js  race mix. All of Biden‚Äôs kids are married to Js as another example. They don‚Äôt really care about race, they only care about power, and removing us is their best chance at gaining maximum power.
1335701734535147528 2020-12-07 05:44:44 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @EuropeanRevolt So, ethnostates are the only way to keep birds of a feather flocking together. I think pretending we can turn everyone into racial purist WNs is a pipe-dream.
1335700771460050949 2020-12-07 05:40:54 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @EuropeanRevolt The point is, miscegenation will happen because love and attraction aren‚Äôt 100% racially anchored. Yes, whites are typically more attracted to other whites, but a 9/10 Asian or Arab chic will still be more attractive to the average white man than a 6/10 white girl and visa versa.

However, a strategy of the Js that we do need to implement, is pushing for creation of an ethnostate...
1335684729903964167 2020-12-07 04:37:10 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @EuropeanRevolt Yes but have they maintained racial integrity? No. Js commonly interbreed and marry non-Js, as it is not looked down upon by the culture in general so long as they assimilate the non-j. American Js are commonly not full blooded J, in another 100y they will appear even less Jooie.

1327938954604195840 2020-11-15 19:38:13 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KeithWoodsYT @KingofShirgar I disagree. Old white conservatives over the age of 70 died off and young whites under the age of 18 grew up to be of voting age. This is explains why the white percentage went down. This explains why GOP among whites has gone down for time; Youth vote left, elderly vote right.

1325918535789506563 2020-11-10 05:49:47 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RichardBSpencer The main issue here, Richard, is that you are not taking this opportunity to help strengthen the push to discredit the system and the globalist agenda because you are to focussed on discrediting Trump. In fact, you‚Äôre siding with the GOP and leftist. This is bothersome to many...
1325914667059982336 2020-11-10 05:34:25 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> If Civ Nats are fighting to discredit the establishment and the globalist agenda in the name of Trump‚Äîthe same establishment and agenda that seeks to replace us‚Äîthan us pro-white DR folk ought to take this opportunity to ally ourselves with them to fight against a common enemy.
1325850420334489605 2020-11-10 01:19:07 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @redmcgraw1 Man existed for thousands of years without guns or weaponry beyond that of branch, so you‚Äôre going to tell me that no man had ever been in combat until the advent of military weaponry?
1325849097560068097 2020-11-10 01:13:52 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Donald Trump has unfollowed Benjamin Netanyahu and AIPAC!  This is big
1325453737733869574 2020-11-08 23:02:51 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @hocmountain @RichardBSpencer In time...  We are entering a new era my friend‚Äîone of which that will see truth, strength, courage, and honour dominate mastery of the English language and memorization skills insofar as having value in the pro-white movement.  I wish Richard the best, I really do.
1325450678739800070 2020-11-08 22:50:42 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> It‚Äôs time for real leaders to emerge.  Pencil neck dweebs have had their chance and they have proven useless...
1325450289705578496 2020-11-08 22:49:09 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RichardBSpencer Your 5% meme is bs. Real men will replace what you have helped to create if you don‚Äôt man up and actually lead...

1325165015519858688 2020-11-08 03:55:34 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RoyalEndeavour I fully agree.  Would be interesting to hear @RichardBSpencer‚Äôs take on this.
1325148649349808129 2020-11-08 02:50:32 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> If Trump is unable to overturn the results and Biden gets sworn in as president, where does the right go from here?  At some point it should become clear to those in the white positive movement that secession IS the only answer.
1324996954489839616 2020-11-07 16:47:45 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> I know what it is like to both win and lose in a fight, and so does any other real man...
1324996377659764738 2020-11-07 16:45:28 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> I don‚Äôt completely trust any man who hasn‚Äôt been in a fist fight as an adult.   Why?  Because they simply don‚Äôt understand what it means to engage in combat and therefore have a limited understanding of what it means to be a man.

I believe in God, but I know enough to confidently say that in order for free will to exist God cannot know our future actions. If God knows and controls all aspect of reality, then we are but puppets in his show...
1324456089119838208 2020-11-06 04:58:33 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Do you think Trump will win Arizona?
1324398725855387650 2020-11-06 01:10:37 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Disagree.  Black women are the biggest supporters of liberalism and the Democratic Party in general, without them the dems would lose every election.
1324119275653705728 2020-11-05 06:40:10 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Nothing odd about this...  https://t.co/cBoyjmxum1
1324099490291322880 2020-11-05 05:21:33 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> So after ‚Äúcounting‚Äù all the ‚Äúmail-in ballots‚Äù it looks like Biden is actually going to STEAL this election!!!  Democracy is officially dead in America...
1324058904867852294 2020-11-05 02:40:17 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @ToastMimosasand @KeithWoodsYT He is a very smart dude, lots of respect for Keith woods as an educator, but he lacks leadership qualities, imo that is.
1324047756042928130 2020-11-05 01:55:59 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @ToastMimosasand @KeithWoodsYT Keith gets this, but he gives too much credit to mainstream news (polls, Covid stats, etc.) so he thought Biden would actually win, then changed his mind when Trump pulled away election night, and is now back to saying Trump won‚Äôt win lol. He has no backbone.
1324043989264355332 2020-11-05 01:41:01 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @yungspeer @KeithWoodsYT EXACTLY.  He seems very afraid to be wrong and if it appears as if he will be wrong he will then immediately shift his take to fit what currently seems most likely to be true. It‚Äôs cringe and unlike him.
1324042649976872962 2020-11-05 01:35:41 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KeithWoodsYT You appear to be flip flopping instead of either standing your ground or just letting things play out. Clearly you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen, but I don‚Äôt think you know what to cheer for. Not hating on you, I  just dislike the fence riding pander to all sides  tweets.
1324023653466546178 2020-11-05 00:20:12 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Biden is now all of sudden just magically leading in Wisconsin and Michigan after ‚Äúpausing‚Äù the counting???   How the f@ck is this even happening?
1323871697896878080 2020-11-04 14:16:23 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> LMAO!

1323379987257323520 2020-11-03 05:42:30 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Donald Trump is going to win the election in a landslide, wanna know why?  ...because there is absolutely no love or enthusiasm for Biden whatsoever as the left does not want an old white guy leading their party of ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù.  At any rate, libs are going to lose their minds!
1323037972661456897 2020-11-02 07:03:28 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> When Trump wins the election, Antifa and BLM are going to cause more violence and destruction than ever before...  Get ready, folks!

1322760066907492353 2020-11-01 12:39:10 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> I‚Äôll never forget all the words of encouragement that @SYNTHICIDE__ gave to me. He was such a positive spirit and always saw the good in people. He didn‚Äôt agree with everything I said, but he agreed with what mattered most, and he always made sure to be real with me.  RIP brother
1322649300464259075 2020-11-01 05:19:01 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> I believe god, as an isolated ‚Äúthing‚Äù, can best be understood as 'subconscious will' as opposed to a conscious mind which ‚Äúdecides‚Äù. The conscious mind does not decide its own thoughts, they just simply form from the subconscious. So whatever God‚Äôs plan is, he doesn‚Äôt know! Lol
1322645633140969472 2020-11-01 05:04:27 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> God can only experience life through his creations, he alone cannot possibly have perspective or experience anything without matter or another will to interact with.  Think about it...
1322350584310206465 2020-10-31 09:32:02 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @a_nice_man_ @SYNTHICIDE__ He passed away on Tuesday
1322340825498554373 2020-10-31 08:53:15 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> RIP @SYNTHICIDE__ , you were such a nice person to converse with and a great friend to have online. Wish I could have gotten to know you IRL, but in ways I feel I did.  I will miss not seeing you in the chat and in my DMs, you will be missed by many.  Love you brother
1322339611759304704 2020-10-31 08:48:25 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @EuphemiaSigne @PatriotAlbion @NoWhiteGuiltNWG Oh my god üò• that guy was such a solid fuckin man I don‚Äôt even know what to say I‚Äôm so shocked and saddened by this
1322247257631166467 2020-10-31 02:41:27 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Moral absolutist: ‚Äúmurder is wrong!‚Äù (raises fist)   Moral nihilist: ‚Äúno such thing as wrong‚Äù (tips fedora)  Moral Relativist: ‚Äúit all depends...‚Äù (scratches head)  Moral Realist: ‚Äúmurder is generally wrong, but extreme situations can allow it to be right‚Äù (takes sip of whisky)
1322242470294507520 2020-10-31 02:22:25 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Moral Realism allows for the existence of an innate moral bedrock of which we can derive truth from, yet it refuses to dismiss the cognitive elements of our being which can evaluate the nuance of a particular event. It‚Äôs perfect
1322241739948756993 2020-10-31 02:19:31 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> So, we can say ‚Äúcutting off your own arm‚Äù as an isolated action IS wrong. However, if it is the lesser of two evils, it then becomes right.  This can be said for anything if we apply extreme enough scenarios.   Moral realism is the most intelligent way of approaching morality.
1322240478654484480 2020-10-31 02:14:30 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Also, the idea that morality is not fixed to a degree and that no isolated action can be considered absolutely wrong is laughable. Rape IS wrong, but there exists realities in which rape is right. Heck, cutting off your arm can be correct in crazy circumstances, but in general...
1322239539419766784 2020-10-31 02:10:46 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> The idea that objective morality is ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù insofar as being absolute in all cases or non-existing, is not a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô or ‚Äòpractical‚Äô approach to morality. Morality is real and ROOTED in objectivity, but morality is also flexible and can GROW in unpredictable ways.
1322238582736756746 2020-10-31 02:06:58 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Moral Realism - a hybrid between absolutism and relativism:  Ex. one SHOULD be loving and respectful towards his parents ‚Äî this is GENERALLY morally ‚Äúright‚Äù. However, if one‚Äôs parent sexually abuses him and neglects him, he is NOT morally obligated to show them respect or love.
1322197955294777347 2020-10-30 23:25:32 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KeithWoodsYT @MarkBrahmin The problem with 'pantheism' (not (pantheon-ism) is that you must assume an atom is conscious and that there is no pure source of god separate from say a pedophile. In pantheism we have to call everything god, but if everything is god then nothing is god. This doesn‚Äôt satisfy
1322196394552250371 2020-10-30 23:19:20 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KeithWoodsYT @Boris41552570 @MarkBrahmin That is great to hear, Keith!  But then why embrace/promote Christianity? Or have you made it clear that you‚Äôre just a cultural Christian (like uncle addy and so many others)?
1322099608240201728 2020-10-30 16:54:44 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Zeinken_ @TheGloriousLion I like the attitude.
1322099055187664898 2020-10-30 16:52:32 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Zeinken_ @TheGloriousLion Right, because I‚Äôm talking about the physics involved and not the politics... come on, man!

1322023506251522048 2020-10-30 11:52:20 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @FencerRichard @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT Now you‚Äôre ignorantly accusing me of being ignorant just because I haven‚Äôt read the work of one man lol. I can tell your IQ is not above 115, maybe 110 most. Could be lower, but 110 tops...
1322022850979635201 2020-10-30 11:49:44 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @FencerRichard @KeithWoodsYT Ok, so let‚Äôs continue then.   Lest begin with the basics.  Do you believe a ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù created the universe or is one with the universe?   Yes or no.
1322022400234606593 2020-10-30 11:47:56 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @FencerRichard @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT ‚Äúbro, if you‚Äôre not going to read my work don‚Äôt bother talking to me...‚Äù  So I guess I have to read every leftist‚Äôs work in order to refute their ideas or points of which they give to me directly?    Your logic is deeply flawed...
1322021669360357377 2020-10-30 11:45:02 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT And this has nothing to do with psychological needs lol that‚Äôs so condescending lol. It has everything to do with deism proving answers to PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEOLOGICAL problems that you admit your ‚Äúreligion‚Äù isn‚Äôt even interested in... hence, why it is not a religion!!!
1322021192916754434 2020-10-30 11:43:09 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @FencerRichard @KeithWoodsYT I‚Äôm trying to have a discussion with you and I don‚Äôt need to read your work in order to do so, just like you don‚Äôt need to read my work (or any one specifically) in order to make a point about theism or apolloism. If u lack care to continue that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt demand I read
1322019172293947398 2020-10-30 11:35:07 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @FencerRichard @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT Please, highlight a part or a tweet in which he tackles the hard problem of consciousness, origins, etc. It‚Äôs just a ‚Äúway of life‚Äù religion without an actual god or afterlife. It‚Äôs philosophy with a pro-white twist that borders on a spiritual way of being, but isn‚Äôt quite one.
1322018535648993280 2020-10-30 11:32:35 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT I agree with both of your criticisms of each other but I disagree with both of your spiritual ideologies. Apolloism is a fine philosophy, but it doesn‚Äôt satisfy the spiritual mind when it comes to the problems I mentioned previously.
1322017849548984321 2020-10-30 11:29:51 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT I skimmed over your writings and I knew what I would find; an absence of anything that speaks to the problem of origins regarding the material world and time.   The problem with your ideology: an absence of god and no account for the soul  The problem with Keith‚Äôs: fairy tales
1322015948719738880 2020-10-30 11:22:18 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT You guys don‚Äôt even argue about the main issues with each other either, you just bash character and accuse one another of being ignorant of your beliefs lol. Yet you call me an ‚Äúantagonist‚Äù, why? Because im trying to chip away at the fat and get to the meat of your feud?
1322015013771612162 2020-10-30 11:18:35 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin @KeithWoodsYT I‚Äôm not, and I don‚Äôt need to be in order to make a point about the superiority of deism as an ideology. I‚Äôve seen you two squabble and neither of you have said anything about deism, which I find puzzling...
1322012103935406080 2020-10-30 11:07:02 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Since we know atheism has a dead-end prior to the moment of creation, deism is the most scientific, logical, and satisfying belief system; one which doesn‚Äôt require the belief in magical births and miracles...
1322011390505324544 2020-10-30 11:04:11 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KeithWoodsYT and @MarkBrahmin, anyone with an IQ above 110 SHOULD know instinctively that deism is the most intelligent way of interpreting the world. Theism and paganism are just not believable. However, no one seems capable or interested in arguing against deism. example:  https://t.co/p0ChPIEb7i
1321958310191472640 2020-10-30 07:33:16 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @MarkBrahmin That‚Äôs a good idea.   At the end of the day, none of us can be certain about the origins of the universe, the true nature of consciousness etc, however, we CAN be certain about the reality of population replacement and global Jewry, so we need to prioritize around our survival...

You know why???  Because our people as a group mastered the natural world long before others, and even our most primitive sub-divisions can build houses.

1313813385201491969 2020-10-07 20:08:15 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Recently, Trump has:  -declared critical race theory as racist against whites (Americans)  -refused to denounce ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù  -accused leftist of diversifying suburbs for the worse  -advised Americans not to be afraid of covid (after beating it)  So...

1303696463713775616 2020-09-09 22:07:13 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison I will agree that we have embraced the better far-end of the spectrum‚Äîmeaning our dainty women and peaceful societies are preferable to that of Africa‚Äîbut I believe the ancient societies of Europe (pre-Christian Celts etc) were superior to both Christian traditionalism and Africa
1303695213786005506 2020-09-09 22:02:15 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison I‚Äôve been in situations where a black chic fights a white girl and I feel like I‚Äôm watching a man fight a woman but what can I do? It‚Äôs a fair fight. I can‚Äôt hit a woman. So it just sucks that white girls on average are just physically unequipped to fight back...
1303694671311446017 2020-09-09 22:00:05 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison I agree men should be stronger and larger on average, but I want lionesses capable of destroying savage hyenas when need be, not little prissy girls who only know how to cook and clean (1950‚Äôs women). Black girls literally just man handle white chicks on average and it‚Äôs sad...
1303694137280077824 2020-09-09 21:57:58 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison It was far more than ‚Äúthe odd woman‚Äù, it was actually a fairly common thing. Exact numbers are not provided, but the writings suggest a 4:1 ratio. Read what the romans had to say regarding this matter, it‚Äôs quite fascinating actually. I would never have believed it either...
1303693097126309890 2020-09-09 21:53:50 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison Once upon a time white women were not only smarter and more beautiful, but stronger and larger as well...  Embrace the ancient way, fack modernity and fack ‚Äútraditionalism‚Äù.
1303687306776326145 2020-09-09 21:30:49 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison Just like in a wolf pack, the alpha female should be alpha physically and mentally, not just a cute girl in a dress ready to have children forever. That‚Äôs the Asian model and it produces weak men...
1303686913635872769 2020-09-09 21:29:16 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison Think about it; a smart, tall strong muscular woman will produce better children than a short skinny average IQ woman will. Christianity turned white girls into small weak people for about 2000 years by reducing them to illiterate weak breeding machines...
1303684814915203072 2020-09-09 21:20:55 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @DazMaddison The Greeks and romans are all we have to learn from regarding the celts because the celts didn‚Äôt keep written history, and BOTH Greeks and romans describe Celtic women as tall, muscular, beautiful, and fierce on the battlefield. This isn‚Äôt fiction bro, it‚Äôs history.
1303683844772696066 2020-09-09 21:17:04 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KarlThorburn Trad does not take into account that some men are better at raising children than women and some women are more dominant and assertive than men. If a strong woman with high T would rather work than nurture, ‚Äútrad‚Äù culture cannot support her, this is a problem.
1303682502058541056 2020-09-09 21:11:44 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KarlThorburn Also, Celtic women were regarded by the romans as being extraordinarily beautiful and often just as fierce as the men on the battlefield. So yes, women can be beautiful, strong, and have lots of babies while not being forced to cook, clean, and stay at home.   Trad is cringe bro.
1303681475129245696 2020-09-09 21:07:39 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @KarlThorburn That is not at all the point I‚Äôm making and is quite the leap for you to take. We can keep the good from various eras without emulating every aspect of one completely. Furthermore, the ancients were not immoral and they certainly reproduced beyond that of one child per woman.
1303501054978469889 2020-09-09 09:10:44 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Kitten_in_Roses I completely agree. ‚ÄúTrad‚Äù isn‚Äôt even traditional when you broaden the time spectrum to include ancient Celtic, Greco-Roman, Germanic, etc. civilizations. The whole romanticizing of the 1950‚Äôs is cringe too because that was basically the decade that gave us boomers lol.

1303178100730200066 2020-09-08 11:47:25 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RichardBSpencer I mean, it‚Äôs quite clear that whites are being dominated/controlled by Js, so using your current logic you would have to concede that Js are superior. But we both know that‚Äôs bs, so don‚Äôt troll us with the whole ‚Äúlibs are superior to cons bc they have more power‚Äù bs, ok?
1303176458488217600 2020-09-08 11:40:54 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RichardBSpencer One could say the same to you about Js in comparison to whites... just because a group has more power at a given time doesn‚Äôt mean they are superior people, Richard.

1303174896550318081 2020-09-08 11:34:41 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @heraclitean11 @RichardBSpencer Lol I hate jazz as well, but I enjoy musical complexity when emotion and purpose is maintained, like for example how it is with most classical, classic/hard rock, and pretty much all forms of metal.
1303173823546654720 2020-09-08 11:30:25 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @RichardBSpencer @heraclitean11 Art is always at its greatest when complexity and simplicity meet to satisfy both the trained mind and the layman. This is why Beethoven will always be more famous than likes of both Paganini and the backstreet boys. Or any synth band from the 80‚Äôs for that matter ;)
1302480107706122242 2020-09-06 13:33:51 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> The story of the universe is the story of the soul; eternal, fragmented yet unified, and forever changing into greater beauty and complexity.

1302478439719620609 2020-09-06 13:27:13 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @natesims07 @Aarick20 Do I believe in eternal bliss or ‚Äúheaven‚Äù? No. That would, imo, diminish the meaning of existence. However, eternal ‚Äúlife‚Äù does not necessarily mean a stagnant state of bliss, instead, it most certainly means constant change and growth ‚Äî much like we experience in this life.
1302477676209467393 2020-09-06 13:24:11 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @natesims07 @Aarick20 We can view this on a smaller scale and it becomes clear that longer/eternal ‚Äúlife‚Äù does not diminish the value of our experience so long as change is continuous.  Does living until your 90 mean life in your 20‚Äôs is somehow less valuable than it is for a man who dies at 50? No.
1302474981666967556 2020-09-06 13:13:29 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @natesims07 @Aarick20 That is a subjective viewpoint which you argue as an objective truth, which given the circumstances, is quite ironic if you don‚Äôt believe in objective truth/morality. I could, in many ways, logically explain how an afterlife could enrich our earthly experience and life in general
1302426371151605761 2020-09-06 10:00:19 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Aarick20 Because they know national socialism is the ONLY thing that can bring people together to defeat both communism and capitalism.   Just not during the winter in Russia... fack was he ever close tho!
1302425435943456773 2020-09-06 09:56:36 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Aarick20 What‚Äôs happening is a logical conclusion of a society without a solid belief in objective purpose, an afterlife, or pure judgement from a pure source. Until we find a god that an intelligent man can actually believe in, not just embrace because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, we are fucked...
1302424350683996160 2020-09-06 09:52:17 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> @Aarick20 You‚Äòre right regarding his disdain for spoon-food materialism by the hands of the elites as a replacement for religion, but you fail to address his main point; without ‚Äúgod‚Äù there truly is no objective purpose/morality.  Whatever replaces god will b less than ‚Äúgod‚Äù, even supermen

There isn‚Äôt anything anyone can do to significantly change anything and we don‚Äôt have a horse in the race to cheer for either. How can you blame people for voicing frustration over lack of leadership?
1300884320098422786 2020-09-02 03:52:45 +0800 <RonnyCameron86> Cities are repulsive toxic breeding grounds for invaders. So, kill two birds with one stone by cleansing yourself of the deleterious nature of urban life and uniting with your white brothers and sisters in rural areas to both combat white genocide and to cleanse your soul...
