1343975266331328512 2020-12-30 01:40:48 +0800 <diregineez> @emmakennytv It's withdrawal symptoms after Crimbo. Go pour yourself a big slug of booze, then have several more. If you don't drink-start!
1343974369685549058 2020-12-30 01:37:14 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues So the man who, when elected pledged to keep slavery out of the US, presided over a civil war that was essentially about  slavery, won it &amp; lost his life because of it, has his statue removed, coz he supported slavery? The Yanks are nuts to allow this!

1343905518293831683 2020-12-29 21:03:38 +0800 <diregineez> @Independent If it could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt tomorrow, that racism had been eliminated from this country, would there be people &amp; institutions that would re-invent it the day after, to preserve their victimhood &amp; income?
1343901545163841536 2020-12-29 20:47:51 +0800 <diregineez> @rebeccabutlerm2 Agreed, I know 4 NHS workers, 2 Nurses, 2 Admin all in different Trusts. They all say the same thing, the NHS is struggling, worse than normal this time of year. No wonder with the number of numpties, out in 'packs' milling about over Christmas.
1343883475565338624 2020-12-29 19:36:03 +0800 <diregineez> @toryboypierce Remove legal aid for asylum cases. If you don't yet live here, have contributed nothing in tax, why should you get it?

1343587649156747270 2020-12-29 00:00:32 +0800 <diregineez> @johnredwood If the French get too awkward, go back to huge ships with containers sailing directly from places like Europort to our major ports. Goods collected in smaller lorries for delivering locally, rather than overweight, euro juggernauts travelling 100s of miles destroying our roads.
1343584988218974210 2020-12-28 23:49:58 +0800 <diregineez> @PaulEmbery Always enjoyed his appearances on QT, nobody got the better of him! A true British hero of the left, who never compromised his principles for ambition. If Corbyn had only followed 'his master's voice', he might have got further.
1343277114750087169 2020-12-28 03:26:35 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox How inefficient is the idea of home birth? It's like a mechanic suggesting to his boss that he gets a van &amp; services customer's cars at their home. He can do twice as many at the garage &amp; if something goes wrong, all the equipment/experience is there to save the 'car'!
1343275429663268871 2020-12-28 03:19:53 +0800 <diregineez> @PAL362 @Independent Watched 20 mins of it a few yrs ago.Texted my cynical, mate &amp; told him what a lot of shit it was.He texted me back that it was his favourite film!Hardly seen him since, shows how successful alternative comedians/writers have been in brainwashing folk to laugh at unfunny schmaltz!
1343270281507450883 2020-12-28 02:59:26 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Oh Laurence! 'Funny' is so last year. BBC's developed a new concept 'Uncomedy'. It spread to C4 &amp; Sky. Brainwash your audience  to think conventional jokes are offensive, get any cheap hack to write some woke shit, get some talentless Uncomedian to perform it &amp; they fill stadia!

1342177942957416448 2020-12-25 02:38:52 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Poor old Starmer, too late to the party now and he will be too late to the party in 2024! Listened too much to his posh, varsity chums and not enough to his working class roots!
1342155779177140226 2020-12-25 01:10:48 +0800 <diregineez> @DavidGHFrost Well done, you deserve a good rest. Thanks &amp; Festive Felicitations to you &amp; your team. You're true British heroes!

Seems to be made up by greedy employers, happy only to employ cheap foreigners. Not just farming, formerly decent paying jobs. Don't invest in training &amp; British kids, easier to say they're all lazy &amp; go straight to europe-until now

1342055909565079555 2020-12-24 18:33:57 +0800 <diregineez> @kinyenoC @PAL362 Do you think that's why when he was PM, they abolished the death penalty for treason?
1342055312807890944 2020-12-24 18:31:35 +0800 <diregineez> @UnwinStanley @PAL362 Teachers should be selective in their whinging. The pandemic shows that remote learning is possible &amp; you may not need as many teachers in future! Wholeheartedly agree about supermarket workers.They had to mix with all sorts &amp; took abuse from numpties when the shelves were empty.
1341907939511181317 2020-12-24 08:45:58 +0800 <diregineez> @Daily_Express Difficult to coordinate vaccination efforts from the Tower Of London, if the rumours are true!

I can see a time when the name Starmer will get a chance to become a PM-in-waitng.... his great, great grandson!   You're right, Naaah!
1341768659451191305 2020-12-23 23:32:31 +0800 <diregineez> @SueWhitaker11 @MailOnline The HRA must be repealed, we don't need it and judges seem to run scared that they will be punished under it, if they pass too harsh a sentence.
1341767875506397191 2020-12-23 23:29:25 +0800 <diregineez> @Stop_The_EU Is that why during his time as Prime Minister, the death penalty for treason was abolished?
1341725901797662720 2020-12-23 20:42:37 +0800 <diregineez> @PAL362 Absolutley spot on. Target big cities 1st, Cops/UKBF + a bus. Are you from UK? No. Got a job? No. get on the bus, yer going home. Various governments could have done this already under EU law it seems. Tories want cheap labour Labour want instant socialists, just add benefits!
1341722977973530625 2020-12-23 20:31:00 +0800 <diregineez> @Lesqueenb @PAL362 On the news this morning about 100 (mainly foreign?)lorry drivers moaning outside Dover Docks. A few masks, but social distancing-not on your nelly. How many foreign Lorry Drivers are used on the channel 'hop' these days, compared to British drivers?

You can start a virus deliberately in a lab or thru disgusting dietary habits,  sabotaging Western economies, but you can't get the blame.WW2 was nothing to do with Germans, but Nazis who were only laundering the world's population benignly anyway!

When they get too big, let them go in the marketplace &amp; get the big bucks. The BBC is chock-full of has-beens getting market-place salaries on the taxpayer. It's the best care home in the country, sorry 2nd, 1st is the Lords!

A time when kids could reach for something, unlike now the staple TV diet is domestic drudgery, perpetrated by unimaginative writers.

1339341237904609285 2020-12-17 06:46:49 +0800 <diregineez> @MahyarTousi Thought so, as most of the TALENTED cast are sadly dead, you know, the ones that made this programme successful.   The BBC had to come up with a gimmick, to attract the sort of viewers that DIDN'T make this a success the first time 'round!
1339339717184270337 2020-12-17 06:40:46 +0800 <diregineez> @mikehatchartist This woke, virtue semaphoring will backfire one day. In the future kids will ask what black people are moaning about. A Tudor King married a black woman, there was a black ambassador at Queen Elizabeth I's court (Mary QofS film) &amp; Henry VI had a black wife(Hollow Crown).
1339291341382148096 2020-12-17 03:28:33 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone Is this like saying, those who don't want to murder can stay at home, but they have no moral right to force their preferences on others? If so, strange statement for a judge! Anyway I'm not listening to a man who, when he's interviewed, is always exercising on his rowing machine!
1339270876798341121 2020-12-17 02:07:14 +0800 <diregineez> @neilsimm @afneil Well said. I have thought about writing to the Advertising Standards Agency &amp; asking them if they are duty bound to accurately reflect the population of Britain, but I don't want the P.C. P.C. coming round. What's that? There's a knock at the door....
1339269425657163777 2020-12-17 02:01:28 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Maybe not on French TV! Advertisers self-regulate. There's a code, but nothing that says they have to represent the population of GB accurately or even roughly!  Census 2011 on mixed couples:'White British were the least likely', yet predominantly that's what's shown in ads.
1339263970516013058 2020-12-17 01:39:47 +0800 <diregineez> @Councillorsuzie @BBCBreakfast I believe it. I was told by a scientist who has survived many a scrape by being cautious. In 1990 he went for a drive with a couple of mates, Buddy somebody &amp; Elvis whatsit &amp; he drove off of the earth. They only managed to survive by clinging on to the edge. Lost his car though!

Usually in the Civil Service when a minister's wet-behind-the-ears graduate recommends something(either stupid, unworkable or been tried before &amp; failed)it's policy for decades! CS must be changing for the better(weeding out the blue bloods perhaps).

With so many of them now dead, do the BBC think she'll struggle, so they've given her a gimmick that will bring working class audiences flooding back-NOT!
1338543237653532672 2020-12-15 01:55:51 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC This is completely wong and his been taken out of context. The BBC are remaking 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and Wrong is one of the new writers. I'm looking forward to watching the sketch when they broadcast it!

Many mixed race ads with a black man &amp; white woman. According to our 2011 census that is the least likely mix. No laws for adverts to show accurate population make-up of UK.

1338142849263677440 2020-12-13 23:24:51 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson Move with the times Calvin funny is so last year. The BBC have been engaging in a new concept, 'Uncomedy'. Funny writers are expensive, cheaper to get some talentless, infantile hack, brainwash the public into laughing at mundane, domestic claptrap &amp; your Uncomedians fill stadia!
1338139997980020737 2020-12-13 23:13:31 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Mr Wong needs to be congratulated. I didn't realise the BBC were bringing back 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' &amp; have engaged him as one of the writers. I think his humourous writing is spot on for the period, I look forward to seeing the sketch!

When I managed a 19th century building, not being a gardener I got my team to plant roses from the period. The flowers were beautiful &amp; as big as Dahlias, but a little (in my case zero) knowledge is a dangerous thing. One puff of wind &amp; the petals disappeared!
1338137523164504068 2020-12-13 23:03:41 +0800 <diregineez> @Botanygeek I didn't realise that the BBC were bringing back 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'. Your style of humourous writing is of the period, well done.
1338136826121506818 2020-12-13 23:00:55 +0800 <diregineez> @prwhittle Why shouldn't these presenters produce Pythoneque race-baiting nonsense, they work for the BBC on hefty taxpayer-mugged salaries. Who is going to stop them? The BBC self-regulates. Two fingers up to the British Public! Time to #defundthebbc

1338131241149861896 2020-12-13 22:38:43 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Walking is racist. If you only walk on white slabs that's prejudiced. If you walk on tarmac pavements that's representational of oppressive, colonial behaviour- Caucasians grinding their boots into slaves. Hopping from crack to crack is OK, depending on the colour of the cement!

1337838701842403329 2020-12-13 03:16:17 +0800 <diregineez> @LeaveEUOfficial Pardon the pun, Heath sold our Fishermen down the river. In 1963, 9 yrs before he took us(some suggest illegally)into the Common Market, he received the Â£35,000 Charlemagne Prize for 'work done in the service of European unification'. What's the exchange rate-30 pieces of silver?
1337834053773430791 2020-12-13 02:57:48 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods I liked 'Cop', there should have been a few sequels.

Better still, invade France, take back the bits that were in dispute 650 years ago. Dump all our nuclear waste over there &amp; the illegal immigrants the French couldn't be bothered to stop. House all our prisoners out there. Win, win!

The Boards of these institutions need weeding of the great &amp; good, many on Â£100K+ &amp; riddled with BRITISH EMPIRE title holding hypocrites.

The total bias of the 'impartial, trusted' BBC. How the EU had screwed us &amp; how our own apologist politicians of all sides, had sold this country out to foreigners.

Instead of ferries, get large ships to come direct to English ports from abroad. Small lorries can then distribute the goods. Fewer foreign lorries making 1000s of trips cracking up our roads.

1331578512382287876 2020-11-25 20:40:31 +0800 <diregineez> @SkyNews Did your interviewer challenge him on the fact that there hasn't been a border for decades? Or does that not fit in with your agenda?
1331577657583132673 2020-11-25 20:37:07 +0800 <diregineez> @darrengrimes_ Where's he been for 20 years? There hasn't been a border for decades. Or is this so he can say, see I told Britain no deal unless there's no border and they obeyed me?
1331577025123979266 2020-11-25 20:34:36 +0800 <diregineez> @JuliaHB1 Is there a 'rentacrowd' element when they need to 'top-up' a studio audience? Coz the same faces seem to appear on other shows, or do they put lalaland stooges in to ask loaded questions?
1331575359645626371 2020-11-25 20:27:59 +0800 <diregineez> @rebeccabutlerm2 @JoeBiden That's like saying, a trade deal will be contingent upon the sun being in the sky! There's no armed border, hasn't been for decades &amp; HMG has no intention of putting one up. Is that so he can say, see UK did what I told them? Funny how some Yanks don't want to be just Americans,
1331573377753116674 2020-11-25 20:20:07 +0800 <diregineez> @Nigel_Farage You'd think an American government  would be considering sanctions, not kow-towing to them further, after what they've done to the world's economy, intentional or otherwise.
1331393819561119756 2020-11-25 08:26:37 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil As its full of racist literature, give all the books to poor black people to burn &amp; keep warm. Then we can fill it with all the great literature black authors have produced..... okay we'll house all the illegal immigrants currently living in 4* hotels then!
1331305537179414528 2020-11-25 02:35:49 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil For too long various HMG's foreign policy seems to be, 'Sod the Brits, let's make ourselves look magnanimous on the world's stage, we're only wasting the pleb's money'!
1331304200756744193 2020-11-25 02:30:30 +0800 <diregineez> @Jeremy_Hunt @RuthDavidsonMSP It's a shame the Tories don't think of their own people in such light. Rather than having a history of uncontrolled, wholesale importation of cheap labour.
1331303276717944835 2020-11-25 02:26:50 +0800 <diregineez> @BarristersHorse Does that mean they flounced out of their own homes?

1330516434980573186 2020-11-22 22:20:12 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues Excellent, but I don't want them going to bat for that shit Christmas song. Especially when the rebel, punk rock, pseudo Oirish band, censored it themselves. Not for commercial purposes of course, that wouldn't do much for their street cred!

There are times when BBC/Sky presenters gush &amp; grovel about the pip squeak so much, it looks like they're about to  break off, fly to France &amp; lick his old chap. But he'd probably be busy at the university!

1330202047015227392 2020-11-22 01:30:56 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox We should certainly do away with the term 'Trustee', particularly in those institutions that we trust to preserve our history &amp; culture. Peopled by a large number of the great &amp; good on Â£100k+, who spectacularly fail to do the job they were hired for.
1330199487776780289 2020-11-22 01:20:46 +0800 <diregineez> @SAshworthHayes If universities don't want 'dirty money', return it to the family's descendants or to the State. They can then redistribute to the 1st in line in the slavery Dept. Descendants of white peasantry who made the rich, rich, 1000yrs before any black slaves stepped into a cotton field.
1330198329637138432 2020-11-22 01:16:10 +0800 <diregineez> @MPIainDS Everyone tends to confuse the public school, oxbridge, overpaid Sir Humphreys at the top with the real Civil Service (the lowly paid who keep the country running) The 'blue bloods' don't like having demands made upon them, or being talked roughly to, that's their job!
1330125401591517186 2020-11-21 20:26:22 +0800 <diregineez> @PaulEmbery Not fit to lick Tony's boots! Got some advice for KS though. Write that advice down &amp; leave it with his solicitor to be given to his great, great grandson. He will be the only Starmer who will get even a sniff at becoming PM, the way the Labour Party is going!
1330121702441951237 2020-11-21 20:11:40 +0800 <diregineez> @toryboypierce I read they are only reducing it. Cut it out completely, do away with the 0.7% commitment. When we're flush we can be generous to countries with disasters to cope with. When we're not as currently, we spend it on our needy.
1329836546934132737 2020-11-21 01:18:34 +0800 <diregineez> @SpecCoffeeHouse @afneil One of the few Spectator articles that is free to view. Is that because it reads like an 'All men are bastards' piece?
1329832786971287553 2020-11-21 01:03:38 +0800 <diregineez> @DCBMEP @pritipatel Too many refer to 'The Civil Service' really it is the born to rule 'blue bloods' who are the problem. Public school-university-senior civil servant(many like daddy before them). The real Civil Service are the low paid workers who keep the country running despite, the blue bloods

1329823954752704516 2020-11-21 00:28:32 +0800 <diregineez> @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak There's the real Civil Service(low paid workers who actually keep the country running)&amp; the self-styled blue bloods. Public school-university-senior civil service (many, like daddy before them) 'spot of lunch at my club?'. They don't like it when somebody tells THEM what to do

I'm only on Â£200,000 a year &amp; that nasty woman won't let me have my way! And she talked to me roughly, that didn't happen at my public school!

1329816225971654657 2020-11-20 23:57:49 +0800 <diregineez> @WilliamClouston @LozzaFox Is this a commercial decision? Who'd want to rock the boat, especially if they recorded a self-censored version of it themselves! That wouldn't look good for the street cred of an anarchic, punk rock, pseudo Oirsh band whose lead singer was born in Kent &amp; went to public school!
1329814179658784774 2020-11-20 23:49:41 +0800 <diregineez> @andrealeadsom @pritipatel Senior civil servants(the blue bloods as they see themselves)don't like being told in a robust way, what to do. That's their province, to lord it over the real Civil Service(the one's that do all the work). So they run crying to mummy &amp; use the system to get their own way!
1329514328723230722 2020-11-20 03:58:11 +0800 <diregineez> @grumpyparkie @LozzaFox The great Irish counties of Eastbourne, Dorset, Stoke, Manchester, Turkey &amp; Nigeria, sure and when the wind blows you can smell the blarney!
1329512501558599682 2020-11-20 03:50:56 +0800 <diregineez> @PaulEmbery An edgy, anarchic, rebel pseudo-irish punk band(whose lead singer was born in Kent &amp; went to a public school)didn't produce a self-censored version themselves surely? Such renegade rock n' rollers wouldn't do that for commercial reasons would they?
1329507627118817283 2020-11-20 03:31:34 +0800 <diregineez> @eightsixonesix @DefundBBC You do know how many of that band were born in Ireland?
1329506848760877061 2020-11-20 03:28:28 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox The Pogues will have to explain irony to the people who run their website. To use a Nazi phrase when the ONLY two members of the group who are Irish, were born in a country that didn't fight the Nazis, that's got to be the definition!
1329486620567990273 2020-11-20 02:08:05 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox @BBC 1) The worst Christmas tune of all time!  2) You can't understand what he's singing anyway.  3) I was going to play this as often as I could very loudly.

1329085877490835457 2020-11-18 23:35:41 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan GB police have to become a FORCE again.Not a business, not a social services wing.Robust with those who wish ordinary citizens harm. It means less graduates/fast trackers at the top &amp; more beat cops who've come thru the ranks &amp; will defend their troops, not sell them out to be PC

1328867428495921154 2020-11-18 09:07:38 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues @Fox_Claire We urgently need a Minister for London if it is to be saved, not a mayor with a strange agenda. The capital belongs to us all, it's how the world views our country, like it or not. Our heritage needs to be preserved, not destroyed by those institutions that we have trusted.

1328154781014224899 2020-11-16 09:55:50 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan I'm sure that's not true about the judiciary, if their local shopkeeper was attacked I'm sure they'd dish out adequate justice. Now what's the name of  that corner shop? Oh yeah, Fortnum &amp; Masons!
1328153459896557568 2020-11-16 09:50:35 +0800 <diregineez> @MrGerryCampbell @pritipatel At senior ranks in the police we need less privately educated, sociology degree toting, straight in at Superintendent, fast trackers &amp; more real, tough coppers, who have come through the ranks &amp; who only just passed their 'O' Levels!
1328116072755703811 2020-11-16 07:22:01 +0800 <diregineez> @tnewtondunn I've seen Govt. Officials in cinemas forcing fat people to consume a week's worth of Cola/burgers/chips/crisps &amp; muffins during the duration of the film. Then they're done by Noise Abatement, coz the punters can't hear the film over slurping, smacking of lips, burping &amp; farting!
1328046811358121987 2020-11-16 02:46:48 +0800 <diregineez> @ByrneBarry The EU have come to expect capitulation from GB, coz of too many years of governments &amp; do-gooder PMs, cow-towing to the EU. Why? Was it was a mis-placed sense of guilt over the fact that we trounced every nation for 1000 years?
1327967470318182400 2020-11-15 21:31:32 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil It's strange how these days the antifascists are more fascist, than fascists!
1327699106983272449 2020-11-15 03:45:09 +0800 <diregineez> @Councillorsuzie Khan &amp; lame duck dame Dick have failed to control knife crime. Are they using deflection to move the headlines? He on more POC cops, Dick alleging racism among Met beat cops still. We need a Minister for London not a local politico with a suspect agenda. Sack Dick get a real cop
1327694848888082434 2020-11-15 03:28:14 +0800 <diregineez> @therealjanbow Congratulations, I like your style of artwork. Such a shame that cancel culture is alive &amp; well &amp; being perpetrated by so called civilised &amp; intelligent people.
1327692549147004930 2020-11-15 03:19:05 +0800 <diregineez> @grahamwettone Khan &amp; his lame duck dame Dick can't control knife crime, so they are trying to get the headlines away from death on the streets to recruitment. How low can Dick get, she also seems  to be accusing ordinary Met. cops of racism. Do they really think they're fooling anybody?
1327688850567798789 2020-11-15 03:04:23 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox @SadiqKhan Good to see loyalty to the troops from the Commissioner's office! Just because she has failed utterly to bring knife crime under control, she deflects by accusing beat cops of being racist. Hoping the headlines will go away? Looking forward to 'DICK SACKED FOR BEING USELESS!'.

They're useless at controlling knife crime, so they'll blame the Beat Bobby for their incompetence. Khan needs to go &amp; be replaced by a Minister for London. Sack Dick get in a real copper, preferably without a degree in sociology!

London needs a Minister for London, like it or not the world judges Britain on what happens in London.

1327313557046833152 2020-11-14 02:13:06 +0800 <diregineez> @SuzanneEvans1 Are our politicians, judiciary, institutions so scared of violence against them/their families that they cow-tow to a 'religion of peace'?

1327305760347447296 2020-11-14 01:42:08 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Has sufficient time now passed, to ask how the hell someone detained at a scene, was transported in a police car, then taken into a custody suite without being searched? Were any new orders issued not to search pocs in public for fear of bad headlines?

I read a while back, advertisers apparently don't like showing white, straight people in case they're accused of 'isms'! They don't mind misrepresenting the population &amp; omitting 80% of us though!
1327206716757471239 2020-11-13 19:08:34 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan At least 'Life' meant life in his case, which is what was promised to pro capital punishment MPs, when the death penalty was abolished. Unlike today, when a murderer is sentenced to life, he does life, the average life of a pussy cat!
1326975355912118272 2020-11-13 03:49:13 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Time to ban fireworks for private use. We once had regulations that banned the importation of Chinese fireworks (higher in explosive content apparently) now it seems anything goes. Public displays by qualified explosives experts is the way forward.
1326971291363119118 2020-11-13 03:33:04 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Eh! Eh! Eh! Calm, down, calm down, calm down!

Then used the might of the Royal Navy to police the world &amp; borrowed funds to pay to free slaves(finally paid up in 2015!). White peasantry were slaves to the rich &amp; not freed in the 1800s!
1326863554029498371 2020-11-12 20:24:57 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone Not good to include ordinary cops in the weasel category (orders from Dick/Khan?).

In the main they've had their knives into DT from day 1. Was that because he was an 'outsider' or just because he wasn't St. Obama? If the Pennsylvania court case finds for Trump, could be a game changer
1326511793632632832 2020-11-11 21:07:11 +0800 <diregineez> @Haggis_UK It's about time they put old Bunter out to pasture, he's past his sell-by date. He's ranting &amp; raving at his 'guest' as if he's biased towards the Democrats! NSS!

1326147242709962753 2020-11-10 20:58:35 +0800 <diregineez> @andrewlawrence Terrific as always. We desperately need satirists on the telly. Not one-way, biased satirists that BBC/C4 employ, but cutting edge, prepared to piss-take all sides of the political spectrum like you. Good if GB News are brave enough to give you a slot, but I don't suppose so.
1326111930969370625 2020-11-10 18:38:16 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods At least Biden stands up for the forgotten Americans, the Deceased! I find America and Britain for that matter, very Deadist. Why shouldn't they have a say? Granted, you may wait a long time for them to speak, but that's democracy! Now if we all hold hands..
1325934623055024128 2020-11-10 06:53:43 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @PoliceChiefs Be fair to @policechiefs if you've only beat-walked in leafy suburbs for the month or so you had to familiarise yourself with what the plebs do, you'd find it difficult to imagine! Possibly unbelievable? Surely shouting in a loud voice, STOP in the name of the law works on telly!

Chock full of lawyers, senior CSs, businessfolk, accountants &amp; various hangers on/favouites of politicos of the day!
1325931129812230144 2020-11-10 06:39:50 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan We should have more diversity in the police-that is class diversity! 50% of senior management in the police should NOT have degrees, they should be officers who have risen thru the ranks, be renowned as tough, thief takers. Not rainbow helmeted, street dancing, social workers!
1325834918337908738 2020-11-10 00:17:32 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @PoliceChiefs How many fast track @policechiefs have walked an inner city beat, not just a fortnight in a leafy suburb? How many were direct entrants to SUPERINTENDENT? What career could qualify you to enter at that level? Military? Maybe SAS, Paras? Not spud bashers!More real cops at the top!

We seem to be living thru the futuristic films of 30 yrs ago &amp; you guys need the uniform to go with it. Visored helmets to protect &amp; act as another weapon. 'Top hat' &amp; cap sadly outmoded.

1325423266459230209 2020-11-08 21:01:46 +0800 <diregineez> @opfirestorm @NormanBrennan Sad, Croydon used to be quite posh (in a working class way!). Seen many a concert at the Fairfield Halls, excellent shopping centre, people used to be nice too.
1325420727768641537 2020-11-08 20:51:41 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone Too many brave young men sacrificed their futures, for what? So overpaid, posh, elitist, virtue semaphorists on Boards of our 'trusted' institutions can dishonour their memory by denigrating our history.

1325045347366924288 2020-11-07 20:00:03 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox FFS, I've seen more people jogging, cycling &amp; milling about like zombies since lockdown 2, than I did in the previous month! Do people think it's compulsory? Maybe they think they'll get fined if they don't!
1325043895139446784 2020-11-07 19:54:17 +0800 <diregineez> @opfirestorm @NormanBrennan Croydon was a terrific shopping area 30 yrs ago, best outside London centre. Lewisham was a close second. Wouldn't go to either now. It's depressing how in 60 yrs this country has been allowed to descend into lawlessness &amp; chaos by politicians/judiciary/institutions.
1325040432770928640 2020-11-07 19:40:31 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues @nationaltrust Is he Chairman of, the NT, Post Office &amp; Samsonite Int.

If he is, he probably doesn't have time to read the newspapers properly &amp; realise what OBLM is about!

1324991779062616069 2020-11-07 16:27:11 +0800 <diregineez> @realDonaldTrump @ChiefScientific Accounts of people attending polling stations and being told they have already voted. An account by a post office worker about late postal votes being stamped with 3rd November. Is this appropriate for your FBI to investigate?

Mind you by that time the care home might not let him out. Will he be too busy trying to work out how to operate the zimmer frame, claiming his pension &amp; drooling into his liquidized meals?

If it means more folk are imprisoned, plenty of Cruise Ships in mothballs, adapt them. Do-gooders can't say 5* is barbaric, can they?

We need a Minister for London. As part of HMG they would 1 Not be in conflict  2 Have direct access to government resources  3 Be able to act faster in a crisis.

I'm disappointed you haven't slagged off the BBC, you've been treated appalingly.

1323999035263504385 2020-11-04 22:42:23 +0800 <diregineez> @DominicRaab After BBC 'engaging in the campaign' as you said in your  interview with Tatty Cat, isn't it time HMG dealt with the blatant bias of the BBC. They have a lalaland agenda all of their own, which no longer caters for the general public &amp;  Tim Davie does not seem to be addressing.
1323996127931342848 2020-11-04 22:30:50 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC Started to watch this last night only because @afneil was helming. I switched off after an hour coz there was too much of this harridan &amp; her playmate from the teatime tinsel politics show the BBC put on, to knock Trump/Boris/ anyone that didn't conform to their lalaland agenda!
1323780648084135937 2020-11-04 08:14:35 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil @BBCNews Glad to see you back on the BBC, trouble is you've got those 2 numties from the tea-time fluff prog the BBC put on to try to deride Trump. Do have Choo-choo on GB News with a new version of 'This Week'. Brit TV is crying out for a real satirical show!
1323697033836986368 2020-11-04 02:42:20 +0800 <diregineez> @BBCNews @FrankRGardner BBC item I saw didn't refer to Islam, only mentioned the terrorist's beliefs. For all I knew it might have been the militant wing of the Tufty Club that carried out these atrocities. The BBC decided to interview an expert in Islama phobia, that's an irrational fear, right?
1323656337335721984 2020-11-04 00:00:37 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan A Minister for London is urgently required. The MoL would have the contacts in government to react much quicker than the political posturing of a local politician. London is too important an asset on the world's stage, to allow it to burn, while a mayor fiddles.
1323653089631621132 2020-11-03 23:47:43 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Time to ban the importation &amp; sale of fireworks to private citizens.  Organised events - great, always enjoyable, licenced professionals in charge, spectacular events.

I thought that black people fought in wars of the 20th &amp; 21st Centuries. Did you forget other ethnic minorities? Let's not forget their sacrifices. I imagine there were a few gay people fought in wars too.
1323646352937701378 2020-11-03 23:20:57 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Bad news. Not only an excellent improviser, a terrific actor and talented mimic on 'Spitting Image'. They should have got him &amp; his cast mates from 'We're Doomed!' to do the remakes of the missing 'Dad's Army' episodes &amp; the recent film which was dreadful.

The YT 'Trigger nometry' interview is eye-opening about the 'Show-biz' cult of wokeness &amp; how you fell foul of it. Penny dropped as to why shows like HIGNFY &amp; MTW stopped being funny years ago!

If this is your union, or your General Secretaries are on similar salaries, do they deserve these sums?
1322902853237776385 2020-11-01 22:06:33 +0800 <diregineez> @Fox_Claire A Twitter contributor told me recently that some lecturers are on minimum wage/flexible hours &amp; can barely make ends meet. If these salaries are correct, lecturers need to get a new union. Especially as some Vice Chancellors salaries are allegedly Â£400,000+!
1322901050395922433 2020-11-01 21:59:23 +0800 <diregineez> @MENnewsdesk Just political opportunism. At a time of national crisis Burnham seems to be trying to score points, as if he's a proper politician still!
1322898765892751374 2020-11-01 21:50:18 +0800 <diregineez> @Fox_Claire When I click on your link, it says the page is not available. Is this twitter censorship or a slip of the digits?
1322897692876541952 2020-11-01 21:46:02 +0800 <diregineez> @Fox_Claire @timothy_stanley MSM will moan for a week about why HMG didn't do it sooner, then start moaning about how long is lockdown going to go on for. When HMG ends it, MSM will moan that they ended it too early. If they started vivisection experimentation on hacks, I wouldn't complain one bit!
1322895072833187840 2020-11-01 21:35:38 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Well said. The biggest indicator here is a TORY government who love profits, shutting down  businesses &amp; anathema to them, paying workers to stay at home! MSM are obsessed with U-turns &amp; gotcha moments. How many asked the same questions last night?

The world's politicians should clamp down totally on violent extremists, not pussy foot around them. Perhaps he should choose another career, if he doesn't have the gonads!

1322517185961566209 2020-10-31 20:34:02 +0800 <diregineez> @MayorofLondon @TheVoiceNews More proof that London is TOO important to this country to have a local politician running it(into the ground?). London needs a dedicated Minister with government resources &amp; close contacts in other Departments to be able to act instantaneously to any crisis. What is SK's agenda?
1322506030392184836 2020-10-31 19:49:43 +0800 <diregineez> @BorisJohnson It's a wonder anyone wants to be a Cop with IOPC indicting Firearms offrs for GBH(after wounding an alleged  blagger!)IOPC also appear to be influencing police SOPs. Are the Cops now being reformed by 25 yr olds with degrees in surfing, fashion &amp; drama, rather than from within?
1322252869668610048 2020-10-31 03:03:45 +0800 <diregineez> @Fox_Claire @UKHouseofLords Isn't it fortunate that low paid, supermarket workers weren't afraid to face their 'customers', like these lecturers seem to be, we'd have all starved.

Could it be he's constantly being interrupted whilst exercising on his rowing machine? Or is it that he's boxed in the past &amp; is shadow boxing whilst avoiding imaginary blows?
1322220297639071744 2020-10-31 00:54:19 +0800 <diregineez> @DPJHodges Starmer is the 21st Century's Neil Kinnock. He'll work hard to drag Labour back to the centre. More identity politics/OBLM support/rights for ferrets down trousers &amp; foreigners who aren't here yet but will be potential Labour voters. Psst! Don't mention the British working class!
1322217319486136321 2020-10-31 00:42:29 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Did I read that they just cast a black actress to play Anne Boleyn? Adrian Lester played Lord Randolph in Mary QOS and Angela Coulby played Guinevere in Merlin. There is precedent, Nelson Mandela has already been played successfully by Harry Enfield on his show. Fillyerboots!
1322205219133018113 2020-10-30 23:54:24 +0800 <diregineez> @Fox_Claire Imagine workers demonstrating? Met would have been ordered in there, truncheons drawn. Ministers/Top Cops don't want their heads chopped off, or their families targeted.'No use appeasing the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last'. You have to kill the fcuker before he gets too big!

1322151204156264448 2020-10-30 20:19:46 +0800 <diregineez> @Andrew_Adonis Dream on! A Starmer might become PM one day, Keir's great grandson! He should stop jumping on every trendy, woke bandwagon that comes along &amp; think about the working class, remember us? Too many of you have forgotten your roots &amp; abandoned the people the party was created for.

A knife wielder is tasered by a cop then gets up &amp; even after there are multiple shots he stays upright. The 2 cops in this latest incident were not taking chances &amp; I don't blame them.  https://t.co/gsxj3JBh8A

How are their people trained, who trains them in investigation techniques? Does this mean that constabularies are changing SOPs on the advice of WBTE 25 yr olds with degrees in sociology, PPE &amp; Dance?
1321829429019070466 2020-10-29 23:01:08 +0800 <diregineez> @cue_bono @ChiefScientific The French obviously conned a previous Home Sec that if bodies started washing up on UK beaches, it would look bad internationally. Now the reverse is true, HMG should use this tragedy to pile pressure on the French to do what we paid them millions for, combat people smuggling.
1321826532948664321 2020-10-29 22:49:38 +0800 <diregineez> @RWTaylors @Fox_Claire Very sad, he &amp; Tommy were very funny and terrific in the recent celebrities in Vegas show. If only the so-called comedians of today were a tenth as funny as C &amp; B. RIP Bobby.

1321542994177261569 2020-10-29 04:02:57 +0800 <diregineez> @MayorofLondon There should be Minister for London, not a local politician  who seems increasingly to be losing his grip. London is too important an asset, it's how the world views Britain, whether we like it or not. It's hardly 'diversity' to exclude a significant  % of your electorate.
1321540001025372162 2020-10-29 03:51:03 +0800 <diregineez> @redamberblack @NormanBrennan If that's the bodycam footage, why didn't the authorities release it at the time? Riots might have been minimal. I thought the cops behaved in an exemplary manner. They couldn't have been more patient, he says that he can't breathe before they even get him in the car!
1321537901788844035 2020-10-29 03:42:43 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan You posted a vid from CWB Chicago where a US Cop tazered a knife-wielder &amp; he just kept coming &amp; I think stabbed an officer. They left it too late before shooting him. These guys weren't taking any chances &amp; I don't blame them. New free TVs for some Philly families tho!
1321532948013846534 2020-10-29 03:23:02 +0800 <diregineez> @BellaSankey They actually died on France's doorstep, not ours. If the French had done what we paid them millions to do, combatting people smuggling, then tragedies like this would not happen.
1321532402896953346 2020-10-29 03:20:52 +0800 <diregineez> @BBCBreaking TV News love a sob story like this, they cynically pluck kindly heart strings like an old fiddle. Most mention the English Channel, glossing over that they died in French waters. Blood is on French hands they've had Millions from us &amp; done very little to combat people smuggling.
1321525963969187849 2020-10-29 02:55:17 +0800 <diregineez> @DPJHodges You have to remember their death rate statistics are lower than ours. Mind you, did I read that they used the same people to count C19 stats that calculated their car emissions?

I'd rather see a 6'6" ex para, who didn't pass his 'O' Levels, who knows 17 ways to restrain, maim or kill, get out of a police car, than a tiny lady who has 3 degrees in sociology, PPE &amp; drama!

Even a Sky reporter said that a year ago there were beach patrols, drones, boats out, now not a sausage, sorry saucisse!

The biggest alarm indicator is a TORY government that love profits, is prepared to shut down large parts of the economy &amp; anathema to them, pay employees to stay at home.

Interested to know the Firefighter's view.

1317881777453731843 2020-10-19 01:34:35 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Sweden, a country on the way to nowhere, almost twice the size of Britain &amp; a population the size of London! They could social distance far enough apart, that they had to use megaphones to talk to each other &amp; still have plenty of room!
1317529033148686336 2020-10-18 02:12:54 +0800 <diregineez> @ArthurFleckEsq @Fox_Claire Very good, I like it!
1317504378622922753 2020-10-18 00:34:56 +0800 <diregineez> @livinglifeldn @NormanBrennan Yes, heightist of me. If I was in trouble I'd rather see a 6'6"rugby player, who barely passed his 'O' Levels, get out of a cop's car, than a tiny lady who has a degree in sociology!Sometimes I walk passed male cops who I am taller than, even tho they've got their 'top hat' on!
1317501443436433409 2020-10-18 00:23:16 +0800 <diregineez> @iMultitudes @LordJustin12 @GowTolson 'Carribeans invited to help rebuild after WWII' often peddled. Really they couldn't get Brits to be Nurses or drive buses coz it was shit money, but far better than was being paid in WI. Ploy to drive UK wages down?1956-64 av wages flatlined, rich tho 'Never had it so good'!
1317435938037968896 2020-10-17 20:02:59 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan That's why 'Life' should mean Life, not the lifespan of your average moo-moo! That's what was promised at the time of the abolition of the death penalty.
1317434796453351424 2020-10-17 19:58:26 +0800 <diregineez> @DevonshireDanUK I've seen no coverage on TV news. Are the media/politicians so frightened to criticise the extreme side of a primitive, unreformed, unchallengeable cult, in case a similar fate  befalls them, or their families? Appease the corocodile, so he eats you last, but he'll still eat you!
1317431032732389376 2020-10-17 19:43:29 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @talkRADIO Gradually, the holiday camp measures are being exposed. Labour &amp; the MSM kept quiet when prisoners got auto-release at 1/2 sentence mark. Without good behaviour? Tougher sentences needed. Short on prisons? Plenty of liners/ferries going spare, fortify them &amp; have prison ships!
1317428438400143360 2020-10-17 19:33:11 +0800 <diregineez> @rebeccabutlerm2 Perhaps they'd like the supermarket staff (who braved the height of the pandemic to keep us all fed) to cover for them!

1317178129690120194 2020-10-17 02:58:32 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Is this why politicians of all sides kow-tow to a primitive, unreformed, unchallengeable cult? Are they frightened that if they speak out, a similar fate will befall them or their families?
1317155530209693698 2020-10-17 01:28:44 +0800 <diregineez> @JamesCleverly @calvinrobinson @pritipatel @KemiBadenoch @BimAfolami It's time for HMG to step in &amp; investigate the BBC, which is no longer impartial. Shows are loaded with negative, divisive articles/drama situations that misrepresent Britain &amp; its people. The BBC act as if we are the same as America, that had virtual apartheid until the 60s.
1317108304640921601 2020-10-16 22:21:05 +0800 <diregineez> @CatharineHoey @DefundBBC @BBCNews Mini is an example of supply chain back &amp; forth, GB-Germany-France-GB,. Why? So EU workers get a slice of a GB icon or revenge? How long before BMW create a factory in this country, rather than keep paying duty, claiming it back, or endless carnets, tying up funds. More GB jobs!
1317076204361535488 2020-10-16 20:13:31 +0800 <diregineez> @Iromg @y_alibhai @LozzaFox Expect a big rise in the sale of the DVDs! Let's start a campaign, We Want 'Inspector Hathaway'. Mind you, the way woke TVland is, Hathaway will come out of the shower, 'Lewis' would all have been a dream &amp; he was really a black man. Then they'll recast. SHIT! Me &amp; my big mouth!
1317073891911675904 2020-10-16 20:04:20 +0800 <diregineez> @UKParliament So let me get this straight, you're advertising a Christmas jumper, people would normally buy to go to a Christmas do in, at a time when there will be no Christmas dos? Is this  the sort of logic we can expect from parliament?
1317072148142477313 2020-10-16 19:57:24 +0800 <diregineez> @WokeyMc Wokedom in the light of OBLM is Britains's McCarthyism. If you don't agree with the lalaland doctrines you get blacklisted. Is that why every other poptastic celeb is confessing their sins? Hallelujah, I seen the light!
1316818232691642368 2020-10-16 03:08:26 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Lots of 'experts' slagging you off here @afneil. They obviously have contacts in politics/media/legal that have been built up over decades on both sides of the pond, that you don't have!
1316815310457110529 2020-10-16 02:56:49 +0800 <diregineez> @theJeremyVine @Nigel_Farage I'm surprised you've raised your head above the parapet, so soon after yesterday's car crash of a programme. If you keep having figures like YAB on your show, spouting litigious bile, you'll go the same way as the other Jeremy!
1316813487893549056 2020-10-16 02:49:35 +0800 <diregineez> @BettyJa08291909 Imagine if they had been like some teachers, none of us would have been fed! Yeah I applaud the low paid supermarket staff, they mixed with all &amp; sundry still being friendly, helpful &amp; jolly. Thanks to you all.
1316701220447420416 2020-10-15 19:23:28 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan In the 1980's to control the Miners, officers were bussed in from other constabularies. If they used this method to control workers, surely it's more important to root out drug dealers etc, by doing similar. Or is that beyond the PPE degree/fast track 'cops' at the top?
1316700322606260224 2020-10-15 19:19:54 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson Common sense as usual. English peasantry were just as much slaves as other races, at the mercy of the rich &amp; powerful. White working class had few opportunities until after WW2 to improve their lot. Thanks in large part to education, but you only get out what you put in.
1316530697574678529 2020-10-15 08:05:52 +0800 <diregineez> @JeremyVineOn5 @LozzaFox @theJeremyVine I wonder how the discussion went? Get Fox on with our little favourite YAB, make him look bad. Oh dear that went wrong! YAB could get sued, Ofcom investigating C5? &amp; Vine looks like a numptie who can't control his guests(who knew?). JVO5 heading for the same bin as Kyle?

1316424577916993540 2020-10-15 01:04:12 +0800 <diregineez> @SadiqKhan There should be a Minister for London. We cannot allow a national asset to be in the hands of a local politician. London is how the world views Britain, like it or not. Knife crime, violence, riots-a real mayor should have combating these as his priority, not virtue semaphoring.
1316421178005782529 2020-10-15 00:50:41 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Not sure, did I see her gulp when you threatened to sue her?
1316419909866393606 2020-10-15 00:45:39 +0800 <diregineez> @JeremyVineOn5 Yes.Our history is under attack coz of a group that began after a HISPANIC was acquitted when a Black man was shot/it's regurgitation when an alleged violent criminal died in Police custody IN THE USA! 2 incidents that have no bearing on the way black people are treated in UK.
1316379182428028931 2020-10-14 22:03:48 +0800 <diregineez> @ratty1404 @JeremyVineOn5 @LozzaFox @y_alibhai @theJeremyVine I think she was well &amp; truly put in her place, when he threatened to sue her. Gulp!

I suspect the faux outrage by academics, is because he criticised Cambridge university for its alleged Marxist indoctrination. Deflection from several other relevant points he made too.
1315693674299379712 2020-10-13 00:39:51 +0800 <diregineez> @CapelLofft Labour won't get power with out-of-touch, snobby, virtue semaphorists at the top. It's like they feared to do any more for the Working Class, so to cover their failure, they jumped on any trendy bandwagon, long as it's nothing to do with the Working Class, particularly white!
1315616025514315777 2020-10-12 19:31:18 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods @TheRealBuzz It's always people who weren't even born when Neil &amp; Buzz walked on the moon! The next generation probably think it was all done by CGI!
1315612258068725760 2020-10-12 19:16:19 +0800 <diregineez> @LeftieStats The traditional stance of the left of the Labour Party was against the EU. In 1975 a pre-referendum, special LP conference voted to come out.  Tony Benn, Michael Foot and the majority of unions supported withdrawal. Strange reversal!
1315609709274173441 2020-10-12 19:06:12 +0800 <diregineez> @PatWilliams1944 We need a Minister for London, our capital city is too important an asset to allow a local politician, with an agenda, to run. The eyes of the world are on London &amp; like it or not it represents the country. In future will tourists be put off by this sort of thing &amp; violent crime?
1315366735059484672 2020-10-12 03:00:42 +0800 <diregineez> @jamescameron191 @NikkiStix55 Absolutely.This is a TORY governement, they &amp; their mates love profits rolling in. Does anybody believe they're enjoying paying people to stay home, shut down the businesses of their supporters? When HMG talked about easing restrictions too many people heard 'BACK TO NORMAL!'
1315364893252620292 2020-10-12 02:53:23 +0800 <diregineez> @Peter_Kirkham @NormanBrennan Cops are supposed to be impartial(NOT take sides?). To show solidarity for a group that was regurgitated after a violent criminal died whilst in foreign police custody, shows a lack of judgement. Is this grounds for misconduct hearings? Unless they were ordered to, of course....
1315358306941140995 2020-10-12 02:27:13 +0800 <diregineez> @HuddlestonNigel The new found shame of Museum Boards re UK's links with slavery did not stop some from accepting BRITISH EMPIRE titles. Hypocritically they don't mind denigrating our history tho. As guardians of our culture they should swear an oath to protect it not destroy it.
1315316166655569920 2020-10-11 23:39:46 +0800 <diregineez> @davidkurten Without fear or favour'(impartiality?) as was rightly said. Trouble is when the cops are led by sociology degree grads with QPMs for admin, rather than bravery, it seems to encourage wokedom rather than justice. How else do you explain cops taking the knee if they are impartial?
1315282434959826945 2020-10-11 21:25:43 +0800 <diregineez> @prwhittle 3 board members of RMG have BRITISH EMPIRE titles, why don't they give them up if they object to this country's links with slavery? HMG has to weed out these bandwagon jumpers &amp; future appointees should swear an oath to preserve &amp; maintain our cultural heritage, not destroy it.
1314994293006893057 2020-10-11 02:20:45 +0800 <diregineez> @IgtIan @policecommander Rather than an impartial arbiter of police activity, does the IOPC see the police as the enemy? Recruitment of IOPC top brass needs reviewing. How do they recruit investigators/who do they recruit/how are they trained/who trains them?How many went automatically from IPCC to IOPC?
1314992081035833345 2020-10-11 02:11:58 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan What happened to the 'Violent Crime Reduction Bill' proposal if you're caught carrying a knife, it's an automatic 5 years in the chokey. That's a deterrent. If they need more prisons, prison ships are the answer. Hang the headlines, they've got a massive majority &amp; 4 yrs to go!
1314991178211880960 2020-10-11 02:08:22 +0800 <diregineez> @GoodwinMJ 30ish yrs ago a study into educational achievement by boys found 1st Asians,2nd White, a poor 3rd Black. The conclusion, Institutional Racism by teachers. Now Whites are 3rd, is there still IR by teachers, concentrating too much on ethnic kids &amp; White boys are the casualties?
1314987870654996483 2020-10-11 01:55:14 +0800 <diregineez> @MrHarryCole @jaymark455 @TheSun It's annoying that such an eminent judge is always interviewed on TV, while he's exercising on his rowing machine.
1314984534513987585 2020-10-11 01:41:58 +0800 <diregineez> @markmaycot Is this a new version of 'Lord of the Flies'?
1314983625797107712 2020-10-11 01:38:22 +0800 <diregineez> @SimonJonesNews @NormanBrennan Thank you Simon for at least reporting this, unlike your MSM colleagues. I wonder how many genuine asylum seekers &amp; legal applicants, these ILLEGAL immigrants are leap frogging? Escaping the brutality of war in France &amp; the arduous journey, being escorted by the French Navy!
1314948328791175170 2020-10-10 23:18:06 +0800 <diregineez> @J_Bloodworth Enjoy SM in its current form. If MPs have their way, SM providers will be so scared of being prosecuted, they'll block  anything even mildly controversial. All in the name of protecting the vulnerable of course! In reality, to stop us plebs sharing opinions/ideas.
1314899244663398406 2020-10-10 20:03:04 +0800 <diregineez> @pritipatel How long before London descends into a wild west town criminals run?More top brass cops should come thru the ranks/be thief takers with QPMs for bravery, not administration. The IOPC is using public money to appeal decisions they don't like. Minister for London needed
1314896197782507520 2020-10-10 19:50:57 +0800 <diregineez> @David_Suchet Many congratulations, Sir David, well deserved. My wife &amp; I have seen you in 'The Price', genius casting as 'Lady Bracknell' &amp; 'Complicit'. Always fantastic performances, thank you so much. Your shadow will loom over any actor who plays HP for decades.
1314893846980055042 2020-10-10 19:41:37 +0800 <diregineez> @InspGadgetBlogs @NormanBrennan Sack Dick! She's got her Damehood, what's she scared of if she defends cops doing their duty? Recruiting police force  top brass must have more cops with a record of catching criminals &amp; rising thru the ranks, not coming straight in at Inspector/Superintendent with a PPE degree!
1314891015791280130 2020-10-10 19:30:22 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @iopc @cps I wonder, instead of being a fair-minded, independent  arbiter of police activity, does the IOPC see the police as its enemy? IMHO recruitment at the top of the IOPC needs reviewing, as does how they recruit investigators/who they recruit/ how are they trained/who trains them?
1314889315550453761 2020-10-10 19:23:36 +0800 <diregineez> @KarlTurnerMP @darrengrimes_ @ReasonedUK @SpeechUnion @metpoliceuk Watch the video, DG doesn't make racist remarks. Neither it could be argued does DS, he uses a minor expletive, in an unfortunate place as emphasis. Is the faux outrage by academics/politiians because he criticised Cambridge University for their alleged marxist indoctrination?
1314885352629432323 2020-10-10 19:07:52 +0800 <diregineez> @BBCSport Another nail in the BBC's coffin, furthering it's lalaland, everybodysnormalexceptnormalpeople agenda. #DefundtheBBC

We need top brass cops to be thief takers, with QPMs for bravery, not for overseeing the installation of a new computer system! IOPC should be an arbiter, not an enemy of the cops.
1314875696242741249 2020-10-10 18:29:29 +0800 <diregineez> @Pippyz @johnsuchet1 @David_Suchet John Malkovich was just as bad.The BBC took the title, ABC Murders, padded it out with fluff &amp; made HP a different detective(ex-priest?!). If BBC want to showcase their talentless writers, let them publish their own books, not hijack one of the greatest crime writers of all time!
1314872050092306433 2020-10-10 18:15:00 +0800 <diregineez> @Peter_Kirkham @NormanBrennan Are the IOPC formulating government policy now? They used public money to appeal a decision by Divisional Court, for that officer not to face misconduct proceedings. Justification, 'Wider implications for police accountability relating to all forms of force'. Is that their remit?
1314724395315855364 2020-10-10 08:28:16 +0800 <diregineez> @johnsuchet1 @David_Suchet Well done Sir David one of our greatest actors, seen him on stage several times. Lady Bracknell was a hoot!  His meticulous research &amp; portrayal of HP was the major factor in its massive success &amp; will ensure HP's longevity, no matter how many have tried &amp; failed miserably since!
1314721030066274304 2020-10-10 08:14:54 +0800 <diregineez> @SimonCalder You certainly don't deserve such treatment, you provide brilliant, balanced advice, but this is the Welsh we're talking about. Did they think that 1000s of tourists tromping across the land, might upset their delicate ecosystem &amp; 'special relationship' with the sheep!
1314713017456750593 2020-10-10 07:43:04 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @PoliceChiefs @IOPC_Help The top brass of public bodies:In the IOPC does a career in a nice, safe office in insurance/charities qualify you to pass judgement on cops who risk their lives daily? Never fear the IOPC's armchair detectives will investigate. Can they find their arse with both hands first tho?
1314708265276780545 2020-10-10 07:24:11 +0800 <diregineez> @ukhomeoffice HMG has to get tough &amp; to hell with the headlines. Repeal the HR Act which only seems to defend criminals &amp; stop the authorities from expelling illegal immigrants. Reform Legal Aid so that only British citizens are entitled to it.
1314706648821305345 2020-10-10 07:17:45 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Not if the armchair detectives in the IOPC have their way!
1314649230355640322 2020-10-10 03:29:36 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @IOPC_Help I realise IOPC is indy, but the HSec must have a watching brief. They've used public money to appeal a decision taken by Divisional Court on grounds of 'Wider implications for police accountability relating to all forms of force'. Are the IOPC creating government policy now?
1314610594083897345 2020-10-10 00:56:04 +0800 <diregineez> @DehennaDavison Civil Service had the Pay Research Unit. Every year they compared CS jobs with similar jobs in industry/other bodies. In the 80s the PRU recommended a massive pay rise, Thatcher ignored it &amp; disbanded the PRU. Suspend the MP's 'PRU' until the UK's something like back to normal.

1314574210883293186 2020-10-09 22:31:30 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Spending your career in cosy, warm, quiet, safe offices in charities/insurance/councils/business(OPC execs?)qualifies you to judge those who risk their lives &amp; take split second, life/death decisions. Disrupting a cop's life/livelihood for months, smug in your self righteousness!

From now on will the cop who sends out a message describing the assailant as 'black', be done for racial profiling?
1314351212343500807 2020-10-09 07:45:23 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @IOPC_Help Since the BLM bandwagon rolled into town &amp; many public bodies jumped blindly on it, I now look at the members of such Boards. IOPC has execs from Councils/Charities/ quangos. Seems no cops/ex-cops. Not essential in an advisory capacity to stop them making idiots of themselves?

Fox must have something, if he's got the massed bands of the woke, lalaland, self-righteous, snobby, virtue-semaphorists on his case.
1310737514358099968 2020-09-29 08:25:50 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan You just don't get the TV revolution going on. BBC are at the cutting edge of a new concept, 'Uncomedy'. You get anyone who isn't white, male, straight or old, commission them to write any old shit &amp; they will broadcast it! Just ensure it's not funny or you might upset someone!
1310722192078966784 2020-09-29 07:24:57 +0800 <diregineez> @PaulEmbery As an actor Connery is Shhhit, but he's the definitive Bond. Moore was great as Templar, but too jokey as Bond. The best Bonds? Ask  the question, is he believable as a killer, only Brosnan &amp; Connery had that sinister quality. I like Craig but it's like Sid James playing Bond now
1310719920515276800 2020-09-29 07:15:55 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson Looks like the beginning of a 'Monty Python' sketch!
1310718806709473283 2020-09-29 07:11:30 +0800 <diregineez> @darrengrimes_ Is Labour hedging its bets in case Biden wins? Trouble is, if he does win will he remember? That or his name? Mind you,  this is Chris Bryant we're talking about!
1310716189811896324 2020-09-29 07:01:06 +0800 <diregineez> @SkyNewsPolitics Another bandwagon Labour have attempted to jump on, mis-footed &amp; is now being dragged around by! Mind you, this is Chris Bryant we're talking about! Former Vicar, former London manager of 'Common Purpose'(there's that organisation again, only heard of it today).
1310710633177001993 2020-09-29 06:39:01 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Are the cops on the ground only doing what they're told by  the senior ranks at Scotland 'We only take Sociology Degree graduates' Yard? Told to go easy on BLM in case Dick gets accused of racism or XR in case Dick gets accused of climate denial. Anti-lockdown-lets party!
1310708261897875457 2020-09-29 06:29:36 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan I think she's auditioning for the remake of Father Ted!

1310605297929662467 2020-09-28 23:40:27 +0800 <diregineez> @GoodwinMJ Â£30 yrs ago, a survey into boys education. No.1 Asian 2. White, then a long way behind at 3. Black. Conclusion?Institutional Racism by teachers. Now White boys are 3rd is there still IR by teachers, concentrating so much on black kids in fear of accusations, whites have suffered
1310604697737269253 2020-09-28 23:38:04 +0800 <diregineez> @NJ_Timothy Labour, the party I was a member of for 25 years has run out of ideas and so jumps on the latest, trendy bandwagons  in the misguided idea that it's staying relevant. There's plenty more it can do for the working class, but it abandoned us for student politics.
1310602897152004096 2020-09-28 23:30:55 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson I saw MF take apart an american news presenter with a similar argument. That's the answer, 'Stop talking about'.
1310601142821367810 2020-09-28 23:23:56 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox I assumed teachers were scared about being labeled institutionally racist, like they were 30yrs ago over poor grades by black kids, that all their efforts went on them, at expense of white kids. But they're so worried about protected characteristics they've no time for white kids
1310596080036450304 2020-09-28 23:03:49 +0800 <diregineez> @haveigotnews Here's an idea to boost the show and keep it relevant, have some people on who are FUNNY! Loose the self congratulatory, we know best, student politics, lalaland, snobby stance, get some new team leaders and... No fuck it just take it off air, it's been crap for 10 years!

1310589761837563904 2020-09-28 22:38:43 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Your political party idea was being poo-pooed on the Vine show today by the usual coterie of indignant, offended onbehalfofothers, virtue-semaphorers. To be fair you were probably only the deflection for the bit on overpaid BBC Radio presenters!
1310586927721205763 2020-09-28 22:27:27 +0800 <diregineez> @LloydsBank Call the police! A murder's being committed that a British  bank are complicit in. They're aiding &amp; abetting in murdering 'We've only just begun' a decent song by one of the greatest female voices of all time. What's worse they've put it in one of their patronising, woke adverts!
1310583279096078341 2020-09-28 22:12:57 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox @JustinTrudeau Well done Lozza you're rattling a few cages. Your political party was poo-pooed by the massed ranks of the woke/ self-righteous/everybodyslovelyexceptEnglishpeople brigade of the Jermely Vine show today. Don't expect to be invited onto Channel 5 anytime soon!
1310581324575576066 2020-09-28 22:05:11 +0800 <diregineez> @bogusNewsViews @LozzaFox I didn't even know this organisation existed, thanks. I am always suspicious of these types of organisations. Especially if they are influencing institutions from the very top.
1310345980995350534 2020-09-28 06:30:01 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues Check YT for bodycam video. GF's resisting every step, the cops are really patient with him. He says he's had C19, then claustrophobic &amp; says he can't breathe BEFORE they even get him into the car, then slithers his way out of it. Riots could've been avoided if they'd shown vids.
1310266585383415810 2020-09-28 01:14:32 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @talkRADIO @YouTube Mostly agree but you used the word 'murdered' in the GF case. Have you seen the 'leaked' bodycam footage on YT? Cops are extremely patient with him, he says he can't breathe even before they get him in the car &amp; he's resisting all the time.He appears to be having a panic attack.
1310259391959101441 2020-09-28 00:45:57 +0800 <diregineez> @IainDale You suspect these are the bogeymen, whose name's are being leaked, so that the lalalanders will accept the  candidates really wanted by HMG. If so, that's a shame, I think both those organisations need a good kick up the arse to make them effective again! Too late for BBC I fear!
1310257683375808513 2020-09-28 00:39:09 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Get rid of elites on Boards of national institutions/replace with a few of us plebs. Make the Board members swear an oath to preserve our history, not denigrate it. Â£100,000+ some of these self-righteous, bandwagon jumpers get! If they break the oath, they're out on their ear.
1310254812987043843 2020-09-28 00:27:45 +0800 <diregineez> @JuliaHB1 Perhaps some have got rich Grannies. Party in the street, go home give Nan a great big slobberin' kiss, she's dead in three weeks and they get her dosh, simples!

1310233723582009344 2020-09-27 23:03:57 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan @SkyNews Bit late,but have the Met's senior management, sociology degree toting team, issued  instructions recently about not searching suspects (particularly ethnic ones) 'til they get to Custody?
1309994768844324871 2020-09-27 07:14:26 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues @OliverDowden Get rid of the elite on the Boards &amp; replace with a few of us plebs. There are many who would do it for considerably less than the Â£100,000 some of these self-righteous, bandwagon jumpers get! Review/revise how these people are NOMINATED, yes they're not recruited!!
1309989370661871618 2020-09-27 06:52:59 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues @nationaltrust If the Board/Council of the NT are suddenly so sensitive about our Nation &amp; Empire's links to slavery, perhaps those with BRITISH EMPIRE titles should resign in protest. These overpaid numpties (Â£100,000+)are supposed to be Guardians of our History/culture not Destroyers!

1309914268716892160 2020-09-27 01:54:33 +0800 <diregineez> @estherk_k Census2011:'Nearly 9% of couples were in an inter-ethnic relationship in England &amp; Wales'.'White British (4%) were least likely to be in inter-ethnic relationships'.Adverts invariably show a black man &amp; a white woman. Misrepresentation of Britain by self-regulating advertisers.
1309657818191011840 2020-09-26 08:55:30 +0800 <diregineez> @DaisyAdeleleo Starmer is the 'Neil Kinnock' of the 21st century. He will never be PM, nor will his successor. If he's lucky the next Labour PM might be a Starmer, his great, grandson!

Blair allowed their philanthropic organisation to go to an American firm. It used to be the best chocolate on the market, now unless it says 'Dairy Milk', it tastes like sickly sweet shit! I won't ever buy it again
1309645581569208321 2020-09-26 08:06:53 +0800 <diregineez> @_SaveOurStatues Books? Not for much longer if the wokerati have their way! Especially if there is anything about white people as discoverers/scientists/inventors/warriors/philanthropists or heroes of any kind. Do they want Year Zero, so there is a level playing field with primitive peoples?
1309642518133379077 2020-09-26 07:54:42 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil So many platitudes from 'colleagues'. I bet there's a few who are camped outside the DG's door, tongues poised, thinking they'll step into your shoes-dream on! Another nail in the BBC's biased coffin. Looking forward to GB News, don't forget Choo-choo for the late night line-up!

This new channel could become the gold standard with him as Chair. A position the BBC should still hold, were it not for the biased/woke/distorted stance they've taken.

1309439849502568448 2020-09-25 18:29:22 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan This has been reported as taking place in the custody suite. The suspect would have been searched beforehand surely for safety reasons alone. Unless the suspect grabbed a police weapon?

A country on the way to nowhere, twice the size of Britain with a population the size of London.

1309271289069264896 2020-09-25 07:19:35 +0800 <diregineez> @UKLabour This is why you will be out of power for 20 years. You are totally out of touch with working class people. The burning question down at the 'Dog &amp; Duck' is not about trans rights! You have nothing new to say, so you latch on to every trendy bandwagon that rolls by.

Slavery by the rich, powerful &amp; privileged of the white indigenous population. Slaves for 1000 years before black people were sold by their own kind to Arab slave traders!
1309147969149698048 2020-09-24 23:09:33 +0800 <diregineez> @neilsimm @MaureenDalby Absolutely, the Robinson's fruit drink advert (but that bit was cut after only a few showings) the BBC TV Licence advert where Sam West acts the goat. These &amp; any product that distorts the make up of UK  population I now boycott. I won't be able to eat soon!
1309143947588112384 2020-09-24 22:53:34 +0800 <diregineez> @MaureenDalby Read that advertisers don't like showing white men in case they're accused of racism! Advertisers should have to portray UK roughly in line with 2011 census, but they self-regulate, so can do what they like. I thought about complaining, but I don't want a visit from the P.C.P.C.!

Their site says they were created after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin. GZ is an Hispanic, so does that mean ONLY BLM?
1309135866665873410 2020-09-24 22:21:27 +0800 <diregineez> @truemagic68 In this crisis if Labour had identified problems &amp; their solutions, but generated a spirit of national cooperation, it would've enhanced it's reputation &amp; made it seem a more responsible party. At the moment it's not on stage, just carping from the wings with bad stand-ins!

1308839322557308928 2020-09-24 02:43:06 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan But according to the Mayor of London when quizzed by an assembly member, he is doing very well. Crime is sooooo last year, the important thing is the mayor's commission to get rid of those nasty racist statues, frivolous entertainment, pesky tourists &amp; become a true mecca. BINGO!

I'm confused, his crack about the elderly at the end, is he saying let's con the old into going out, catching it &amp; snuffing it, less tax to pay for pensions?
1308776192825274368 2020-09-23 22:32:14 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox And if these Boards of Trustees are so concerned about Britain's racist past &amp; Empire, why not sack the ones who have BRITISH EMPIRE titles?  Or invite them to renounce their titles. Quite a sacrifice losing that window seat in the posh restaurants!

Gibbering away to himself as to how he used to be somebody, but got pussy whipped,"Spare a copper for old soldier, Guv!"
1308738991823388673 2020-09-23 20:04:25 +0800 <diregineez> @spectator @afneil He's like a bad actor delivering lines in a once popular, cutting edge play, everybody's seen, but hardly anybody likes anymore, coz it's been adapted to appear trendy by a previous, outmoded director.Current cast are terribly incompetent actors, but it still appeals to children!

1308726873602613248 2020-09-23 19:16:16 +0800 <diregineez> @greyfunneline @Fox_Claire A TORY government that has to curb business activities, pay people to stay at home(agin the Tory grain?)They must see this as a necessity. Twitterists whose opinions I greatly respect seem obsessed with infringement of our rights as the overriding factor, preserving life is #1

1308722188602740741 2020-09-23 18:57:39 +0800 <diregineez> @TerrorismPolice This SC kept emphasising rt wing extremism.Which extremist group have caused the most deaths in Britain? I only heard Basu refer to muslim extremist attacks by their place names!This SC seems concerned with censoring free speech on SM, maquerading as protecting us from extremism.
1308719185984446464 2020-09-23 18:45:43 +0800 <diregineez> @iainpdooley He's been in that post for at least 2 yrs, about time he was moved on.That SC kept on about rt wing extremism, he only refers to muslim extremist acts by the place names where they occurred!The whole thing was muted. Ironic as they appear to want to stop free speech with SM laws!
1308715514131361795 2020-09-23 18:31:07 +0800 <diregineez> @prwhittle @_SaveOurStatues Is there an effort by the establishment to shut down free speech?Watching the select committee today, it seems they want to stop us plebs sharing opinions/ideas/criticism.Do they want to make SM providers so scared of the law that they will censor even remotely contentious items?
1308549281163472898 2020-09-23 07:30:34 +0800 <diregineez> @MattGarrahan Germany, that uses the same people to count Covid 19 statistics that calculated their car emissions. Italy, that seems to be the only country that can test passengers for C19 &amp; have the results back in 30 mins. I understand that Topo Gigio is close to developing a vaccine!

1308455802613780485 2020-09-23 01:19:07 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods It's a shame this doesn't happen to those virtue-signalling celebs, sportsfolk, politicians who kow-tow to the latest trendy bandwagons. Give troublemakers an inch &amp; they don't just want a mile, they want the whole fucking country. Brave pup!
1308452203217195008 2020-09-23 01:04:49 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Getoutofit! That's a sketch from the 'Benny Hill Show'!

How can they be patrolling their beaches if these huge numbers of boats are being launched from them? French appear to be aiding &amp; abetting illegal immigrants. Replace UKBF with RN, treat it like an invasion, repel invaders under National security!
1308197996924997635 2020-09-22 08:14:42 +0800 <diregineez> @PaulEmbery Sadly I think Labour is well over the brink, it's falling Lemming-like to its doom. This brought about by pursuing too many trendy, self-righteous, student politics policies &amp; cow-towing to every crackpot organisation that rears its ugly head. I take no pleasure in saying this.
1308195506909315072 2020-09-22 08:04:48 +0800 <diregineez> @PippaCrerar Allegedly whoever reported it confused him with Tony Blair! If true, what was he doing there in the light of your revelation? This is the same Italy don't forget, that can test passengers &amp; get results back in 30 mins! I hear Topo Gigio has discovered the cure for Covid 19 too!

This is the same Italy don't forget, that can test people at an airport &amp; get results back in 30 mins! I hear Topo Gigio is well on the way to discovering the cure for Covid 19 too!
1308190779257561088 2020-09-22 07:46:01 +0800 <diregineez> @BBCNewsnight @Fox_Claire So that bastion of truth &amp; impartiality 'Newsnight' trotts out a British Epidemiologist BASED IN ITALY! Did he advise the Italians I wonder? What next? A Flat Earther who will knock the government for not waiting until Covid 19 slides off the edge!

They do not want us plebs talking frankly to each other, in case a groundswell of opinion is created.They want SM to be so scared of the law, that they will censor anything remotely contentious

1308183478534574080 2020-09-22 07:17:00 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson @ReasonedUK If every other celeb POC didn't peddle 'We were the only Asian/Black/Chinese family in the village &amp; had dog poo poked thru our letterbox' &amp; every other drama didn't have  whitey doing down POCs, we might see racial harmony. It just devalues POCs who genuinely experienced racism.

1307836856105684992 2020-09-21 08:19:39 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone Yeah let the Swedes take over.

1307819980428320769 2020-09-21 07:12:36 +0800 <diregineez> @ITV @DanielMays9 @Jason__Watkins @itvhub ITV:Be rightly proud of your true-life crime dramas of recent years. 'White House Farm' was brilliant, but if at all possible 'Des' is even better. Excellent, traditional drama with no PC, hindsight spin, sensitively told. Superb acting from the 2 leads &amp; a quality back-up cast!
1307814997041590272 2020-09-21 06:52:47 +0800 <diregineez> @DanielMays9 @ITV You are right to be proud of this stunning piece of true life traditional drama. No attempt to put a politically correct, hindsight spin, which ruins a lot of modern dramas. Quality actors in cameos. I would be hard pressed to award the BAFTA to you or Tennant! ITV to be praised
1307811571473756160 2020-09-21 06:39:11 +0800 <diregineez> @confidencenac Labour started out as the party of aspiration for working class people. Decent jobs, wages, a nice place to live, health &amp; education for their families. Now their policies increasingly seem to want to penalise the very working class, they promised a better life to.
1307731175558074368 2020-09-21 01:19:43 +0800 <diregineez> @JuliaHB1 Yeah let the Swedes take over. Sweden, a country on the way to nowhere, that's nearly twice the size of Britain, with a population the size of London.
1307650555662266371 2020-09-20 19:59:22 +0800 <diregineez> @sundersays If this is on the cards, it has to be part of a bigger reform, get rid of titles like 'Lord Lieutenants', 'High Sheriff' 'Black Rod'. The honours system as a whole is class prejudiced &amp; corrupted by patronage. To tinker with this to appease a vocal minority is wrong.
1307646656716984321 2020-09-20 19:43:52 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil @DefundBBC Plenty of brown trousers too! You should have let them choke on their muesli a bit longer, before admitting you weren't interested.

His Commission to tear down all those nasty racist statues. Replace buses &amp; trains with donkeys, might whiff a bit, but much more envirofriendly.
1306718419803426830 2020-09-18 06:15:23 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC @danwootton The BBC should be a springboard for new talent. They make a reputation, then go earn megabucks from commercial stations that can afford them. Currently it's a care home for has-beens too lazy to compete in the market place. Why bother when the BBC will pay you the going rate!
1306648191077617664 2020-09-18 01:36:19 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone If Institutions that received funding from benefactors no longer want to honour/be assocoated with that person, fair enough.

1306642343601352708 2020-09-18 01:13:05 +0800 <diregineez> @Nigel_Farage The French navy is facilitating people smuggling. By giving illegals(allegedly)equipment to carry themselves to UK, that's aiding &amp; abetting. The French are breaking International law! Seems to be a common passtime in the EU, we just got to it a bit late! Better late than never!
1306611042001334272 2020-09-17 23:08:42 +0800 <diregineez> @FXMC1957 Excellent series. Roger Moore was definitely Brett Sinclair, or Simon Templar, but he was too jokey as James Bond!
1306609222893948928 2020-09-17 23:01:29 +0800 <diregineez> @HPluckrose I don't mind this, a man doing a job of work shoos away a croc, like it's a pesky pigeon(some balls!). What I can't stand these crocodiles worriers, alleged environmentalists, who grab them by the tail for effect. Less now since a few have copped it worrying other creatures.
1306607016614547459 2020-09-17 22:52:43 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Check out BLM's site, it says they were formed when George Zimmerman was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case. I originally thought BLM supported all ethnic minorities, GZ identifies as Hispanic! So does this mean ONLY black lives matter?
1306604583913959424 2020-09-17 22:43:03 +0800 <diregineez> @MaryKenny4 Yeah let's learn from Sweden, a country on the way to nowhere, nearly twice the size of Britain with a population the size of London. And Germany who use the same people to count Covid 19 statistics who calculated car emissions!
1306535005364137986 2020-09-17 18:06:34 +0800 <diregineez> @wizard_david04 I only caught the tail end of this, I was surprised by Channel 5. Despite having some of the usual lisping, apologist Historians on there, I was impressed by some History buffs I'd never seen before. It was quite flattering of Nelson, but that was the last 40 mins.
1306525941259210753 2020-09-17 17:30:33 +0800 <diregineez> @PeterHamby According to the BLM site, they were created after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case. George Zimmerman identifies as Hispanic. Does that mean that BLM don't support other ethnic minorities i.e. only black lives matter?

This kid will  probably be let off with a warning by the courts coz he's a minor, misunderstood &amp; society is to blame! What happened to the automatic jail sentences for merely carrying knife?
1306368956308115457 2020-09-17 07:06:45 +0800 <diregineez> @KingBobIIV This passage conveniently omits that Trayvon Martin was shot by George Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic! I originally assumed that BLM supported all ethnic minorities, not so it seems. What all of this to do with music is beyond me, but should be called out.
1306364158716370944 2020-09-17 06:47:41 +0800 <diregineez> @calvinrobinson Sadly all the while the virtue-signalling politicians, Sky, BBC, C4, poptastic celebs &amp; has-been sportsfolk dominate the airwaves, nothing will change. Thank you for trying to highlight what's going on at least!
1306246628022644744 2020-09-16 23:00:39 +0800 <diregineez> @andrewlawrence It's got strong competition, but I think this is the best so far. Thanks Andrew, if only the BBC could take the piss out of itself like it used to!

They damnatio memoriae-like removed him from Daily Politics, gave Sunday Politics to a former Labour Leader's daughter, then cancelled This Week(best politics &amp; satire show on TV).

Rather than a springboard for new blood, the BBC is just a care home for has-beens, expensive has-beens!
1305934413532930049 2020-09-16 02:20:01 +0800 <diregineez> @DarrenPlymouth Incredibly brave men who fought &amp; died to preserve a certain way of life, justice, free speech, religious tolerance, national pride, patriotism. Not for much longer if the woke, statue hating, masquerading Marxists, 5th columnists &amp; British History denigrators get their way!
1305926952986071040 2020-09-16 01:50:23 +0800 <diregineez> @andrewdoyle_com Now I am confused! A bloke puts a frock on, wig, teeters around in high heels, with his intact tackle swinging between his legs and kills people. But he's not trans?

1305922719926702082 2020-09-16 01:33:33 +0800 <diregineez> @bbcpress I wouldn't put this out as an advert if I were you. It just shows the woke rubbish you broadcast these days! You could afford free licences for over 75s, if you dumped has-been, biased, expensive, poptastic presenters &amp; replaced them with cheaper, fresh talent.  #DefundTheBBC
1305920940514185216 2020-09-16 01:26:29 +0800 <diregineez> @darrengrimes_ @DefundBBC It's a good job the BBC are spending Â£100million on diversity &amp; are sacking lots of white presenters, there were hardly any POC in that sequence!
1305920006912434176 2020-09-16 01:22:47 +0800 <diregineez> @_JuliaMaddox @afneil I've seen the thread to this. You won't get anywhere with the 'Offended On Behalf Of Someone Else Brigade'.Of course Hirsch has really suffered from slavery, privately educated, Oxford, Law School, MSM career. By contrast British peasantry weren't slaves of the rich &amp; privileged!
1305911279249489921 2020-09-16 00:48:06 +0800 <diregineez> @CatharineHoey @DefundBBC BBC should be a springboard for new talent, not a care home!When they get famous/want big bucks, dump'em get fresh talent.Go back to new actors reading news.Newly retired sportsfolk(without the Charisma bypass)&amp; historians without silly lisps,who don't denigrate British History!

1305799669239476224 2020-09-15 17:24:36 +0800 <diregineez> @cue_bono Well said, I'd like to think the BBC is repairable, but it's not.
1305799352070402052 2020-09-15 17:23:20 +0800 <diregineez> @llggeorgia @spikedonline CPWTIA doesn't judge people. If anything, it highlights the amount of debt that people get into, especially since the recession. Sometimes thru no fault of their own, but it's also folk doing nothing to help themselves, but expecting the state/family/lenders to pick up the tab.

1305577745771102208 2020-09-15 02:42:45 +0800 <diregineez> @clearlyPR As a consumer I boycott things made or grown in the EU. Also any products that wildly distort the British population  in adverts, compared to that which was described in the 2011 census. Any sellers who support marxist organisations, I no longer buy from. And I'm a socialist.

It's funnier than Titania McGrath. It's amusing, but I wonder if POC might find it insulting, there's  stuff like 'our black brothers &amp; sisters' apart from that cleverly done.

Unless UKBF give them a lift of course!

After all he wrote about a Moor who is hoodwinked by a white man to kill his wife. Who is Shakespeare to write about PoC? Cultural misappropriation? Unless history is rewritten of course &amp; we discover that he was actually black!

They also seem to cheap-skate by not using big named actors. What's that do luv? Puts bums on seats!

Successive PMs have grovelled &amp; pussy-footed around inferior nations, politely pretending we haven't liberated, bailed out or trounced them! About time we stopped playing by Queensbury Rules while other nations kick us in the cobblers!
1305111108441735169 2020-09-13 19:48:30 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC Yeah, I notice the 5th Columnists are out in force today. BBC News emphasised that these were ex-PMs from different political parties, failing to mention that both are allegedly EU phallus-syphoners!
1305109481366446081 2020-09-13 19:42:02 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC Make the BBC a launch pad for careers, not a Care Home! When they get too big, dump 'em get new batch in! Actors to read the news(as previously). Newly retired Sports folk(who haven't had the charisma bypass) Historians who don't denigrate british history &amp; without silly lisps!
1305107893251964929 2020-09-13 19:35:44 +0800 <diregineez> @FraserNelson @afneil Leaving aside the architectural homliness, as others have said the artistic content has suffered badly from wokeliness. Festival Hall used to be a good folk/rock venue. Now all there seem to be is Pategonian totem-pole dancers accompanied by tribal tin can bangers &amp; whistlers!
1305104375149465606 2020-09-13 19:21:45 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan This sort of thing just furthers the myth that the UK is the same as America when it comes to racism. The Yanks had virtual apartheid until at least the 1960s. Are ITV keen to copy the BBC, whose content is chock-full of programmes that seem to intend to stir racial disharmony.

He had that same sort of self-satisfied smirk on his face as he has now. As if he knows something we don't!
1304424615461126144 2020-09-11 22:20:38 +0800 <diregineez> @SadiqKhan Like it or not, London is how the world sees Britain. It is too important an asset to be controlled by a local politician with an agenda. There should be a 'Minister For London', we can then judge the government of the day by how it manages  our capital.

The BBC had to calculate it over a 10 yr period to get it to double figures! The BBC seem to enjoy stirring racial division in this country.

1303850843947634688 2020-09-10 08:20:40 +0800 <diregineez> @Reniour @MailOnline 1) How are 'Immigration' judges appointed  2) How many are from BAME backgrounds 3) Whether the number of judges from BAME backgrounds is proportionate, using the 2011 census.  Introduce a limit to the no. of years judges can spend on Immigration, to reduce chances of corruption.

1303635626227621889 2020-09-09 18:05:28 +0800 <diregineez> @SpecCoffeeHouse @afneil Mmm, historically themed? The battle of Crecy perhaps, Agincourt, Waterloo. I know WWII where the French refused to surrender or collaborate &amp; kept fighting the Nazis, alone for 2 yrs till the US came in. Oh, wait a minute....
1303633486692192258 2020-09-09 17:56:58 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone I might start watching this, if it's as unwoke as you say!

Then carry out surveillance and nick them. If they wanted to of course!

1303386218143657984 2020-09-09 01:34:24 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Sorry for boys without Dads but it's no excuse. My Granddad died when my Dad was only 2. Family was poverty stricken but my Dad managed to give me principles to live by.He was my hero, mentor, protector &amp; mate. Much of who I am is due to his influence, he was a great role model.

I wonder if she'll bring her parents on 'Woman's Hour' for advice to women. Did I read somewhere that they are interested in women's employment, women's welfare &amp; health? And they can give financial advice too.
1303013506824974337 2020-09-08 00:53:23 +0800 <diregineez> @historykev @Fox_Claire We should NEVER countenance euthanasia for many reasons. Pressure from greedy relatives, Doctors more concerned about budgets than OAPs, or harvesting organs. Interesting timing, Organ Donation Law has just changed! 'Assisted Dying'? A better euphemism, 'The Good Innings Act' !

1302969121236226048 2020-09-07 21:57:01 +0800 <diregineez> @NormanBrennan Are the authorities so scared of declaring that they are after a black suspect, that they pussy-foot around, until they have to reveal it? If he was an asylum seeker, is that so politically sensitive that they can't admit it? What do they fear? Riots?
1302967230766997513 2020-09-07 21:49:30 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Funny how the press have been advertising XR as something virtuous, but when they can't get their 'oily' rags out, they queue up to demand action from the government! Sod the press XR's antics could mask a terrorist attack 1 day, clogging the roads, making the effects 100x worse!
1302738978525847559 2020-09-07 06:42:30 +0800 <diregineez> @StateofShae Sadly, it seems to prove the senior management of police nationally, are more worried about being accused of racism (may affect their chances of a knighthood)rather than protecting the public, by issuing an ACCURATE description of a suspect.

I remember a mate(to the right of Attila the Hun)went to play football against the police in 1980s, &amp; he saw a coachload of cops with NCB donkey jackets on. Mmmm, wonder where they were going?

How long before terrorists use your antics to mask an attack. With your idiots blocking the roads, the effects from an attack would be made much worse if emergency vehicles could not get through.

1301531376160776198 2020-09-03 22:43:56 +0800 <diregineez> @KayBurley @MattHancock Australian speaks his mind without worrying about political correctness-hold the front page!
1301453176852434944 2020-09-03 17:33:11 +0800 <diregineez> @iancharris @DailyMirror @Holbornlolz Perhaps it's catching!
1301451405136482304 2020-09-03 17:26:09 +0800 <diregineez> @witherjay @thecarolemalone @FE_business @JohnC34745847 @AdamJohn2208 Well said. My thanks goes out to the supermarket workers who had to deal with all &amp; sundry.
1301450198422638592 2020-09-03 17:21:21 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods Or Vampires, you need a team out there, headed up by Jack Crow!
1301448399661740032 2020-09-03 17:14:12 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods I hope they bought that puppy for him!
1301448163275014145 2020-09-03 17:13:16 +0800 <diregineez> @TheBembridge Very succinct. This was quite prevalent during Brexit. BBC &amp; Sky would trot out the Colonel Blimp type, or has been politician whose false teeth didn't fit properly, dribbled or the home had let out for the day.
1301446543283834881 2020-09-03 17:06:50 +0800 <diregineez> @NerdSStockin @GeoffNorcott Agreed. In olden days (I am qualified to comment!) there always seemed to be an equal balance. Comedians would ridicule humbug &amp; hypocricy on both sides, even HIGNFY. Now it's too one sided.
1301445338071433216 2020-09-03 17:02:02 +0800 <diregineez> @GeoffNorcott Those are the funniest segments I've ever seen on those programmes. I'm surprised you kept being invited back on QT, you held your own too well for the BBC.
1301440157850234881 2020-09-03 16:41:27 +0800 <diregineez> @RealJamesWoods Don't they have Dojos  for these Sumo wrestlers to practice in?
1301214826321018880 2020-09-03 01:46:04 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil Bet they won't put up the lyrics with the bouncing ball!
1301214553997488129 2020-09-03 01:44:59 +0800 <diregineez> @FraserNelson @afneil If the British Library is in earnest about reforming itself because of slavery, perhaps the FOUR Board members who have BRITISH EMPIRE titles, will give up their honours, in protest of the Empire's links with slavery? Naaa, thought not!
1301212985222926338 2020-09-03 01:38:45 +0800 <diregineez> @edballs Bet they won't show the words with a 'bouncing ball'!
1301212436377329664 2020-09-03 01:36:34 +0800 <diregineez> @addicted2newz He doesn't seem able to convince even himself! I haven't seen this lacklustre performance before.
1301211613488390144 2020-09-03 01:33:18 +0800 <diregineez> @thecarolemalone @AdamJohn2208 Good job the  poor sods who manned the supermarkets in the midst of the pandemic weren't as cowardly, none of us would have eaten!
1301210153224634369 2020-09-03 01:27:30 +0800 <diregineez> @montie We're at the mercy of arrogant, posh, elitists who want to force  their preferences on the British public. If funding continues in the same way it will be a licence for the lalalanders to broadcast more preachy, divisive, disproportionate drama, unfunny comedy &amp; biased news.
1301186815240658944 2020-09-02 23:54:46 +0800 <diregineez> @zarahsultana This is part of the problem with Labour, they abandoned the British indigenous  working class years ago. They seem to care more about people who aren't even here yet/have come here illegally. People who we know nothing about. Expect to be in government...about the next millenium!
1301185093017440258 2020-09-02 23:47:55 +0800 <diregineez> @JYDenham @PaulEmbery This is really about arrogant, BBC, elitist snobs who don't live in the real world. Theirs is a plastic land where only their opinion counts &amp; the public(who pay their Â£300k+ wages)are just a lot of racist, right wing plebs who'll get the shows they're given, not what they want!
1301179788552536064 2020-09-02 23:26:50 +0800 <diregineez> @afneil You could destroy it from within!
1301179373354135555 2020-09-02 23:25:12 +0800 <diregineez> @janak_pandit @Mikey1732 @PaulRaynorUK I think a Starmer could become PM, probably his Great Grandson! That's about the next time we'll see a Labour Government, if they keep jumping on the latest woke/PC  bandwagon.
1301178326514532353 2020-09-02 23:21:02 +0800 <diregineez> @baggyneil @MrHarryCole It's funny how folk who display that flag, can't get their  minds off sheep!
1301175340555960326 2020-09-02 23:09:10 +0800 <diregineez> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Despite being a left-leaning sort of person, I begrudgingly do appreciate your wit and sympathise with some of your views. If however, you are trying to lose the 'Lord Snooty &amp; His Pals' Tag, you're going the wrong way about it!
1301174051952570369 2020-09-02 23:04:03 +0800 <diregineez> @FraserNelson The problem with Starmer is he's a working class boy from South London who has forgotten his roots. If he still had his mates from those days(rather than the varsity snobs) they might remind him what the real world's like, rather than the plastic world he inhabits now!
1301171745764839429 2020-09-02 22:54:53 +0800 <diregineez> @LozzaFox Thanks for sticking your head above the parapet and making the rallying cry again, Lozza!
1301170568927080449 2020-09-02 22:50:12 +0800 <diregineez> @JustSayinCuz @FlashMob4EU @rachaelvenables @LBC After you. You seem to be interested in saving the world!
1301129835234852864 2020-09-02 20:08:21 +0800 <diregineez> @FlashMob4EU @rachaelvenables @LBC If the government agreed about climate change, but told them they would all have to give up their mobile phones, tablets, x-boxes, netflix all electronic devices, you'd see a different kind of rebellion!
1301128818581811201 2020-09-02 20:04:18 +0800 <diregineez> @rachaelvenables @Fox_Claire @LBC Use the same tactics they used on the Miners in the 1980s!
1301127695611441154 2020-09-02 19:59:51 +0800 <diregineez> @Nigel_Farage Not that I worry about the songs as such, but I don't want  unaccountable, overpaid, lalaland, liberal, snobby elitists dictate to me what I can and can't watch. Especially when millions like me pay their wages. The BBC is beyond saving and it saddens me to say that.
1301110993054035969 2020-09-02 18:53:28 +0800 <diregineez> @prwhittle All our institutions need weeding out of the great &amp; the good. Scrutinise those who have made decisions which denigrate our history/culture for the sake of virtue signalling against links with slavery. Those who hold BRITISH EMPIRE titles, take them away.
1300925585221398533 2020-09-02 06:36:44 +0800 <diregineez> @Johnnywas25 @Mike_Fabricant There are that many cats in the UK!
1300924109401055232 2020-09-02 06:30:52 +0800 <diregineez> @ThurrockGazette @LozzaFox Only Essex Lives Matter is that the message from this.... this is a joke account right? The ELM movement demands:- Sovereignty for Southend, A Democratic Republic of Rayleigh and Liberation for Loughton!
1300918091103252480 2020-09-02 06:06:57 +0800 <diregineez> @Johnnywas25 @Mike_Fabricant Cod &amp; Chips, the staple diet of Brits for generations, but we don't eat it. That's why most of it's imported! What a strange argument to have with yourself. Tuna? There aren't that many cats in Britain are there?
1300862839532421121 2020-09-02 02:27:24 +0800 <diregineez> @Mike_Fabricant This is great news for unemployment. Building new fisheries protection vessels (in Britain of course). Recruiting more Sailors to man them. More people going into the fishing industry, more cod in our F&amp;C shops rather than the 8% of OUR own cod the EU allow us!
1300861300780814336 2020-09-02 02:21:17 +0800 <diregineez> @DefundBBC BBC's Head of Comedy said comedy didn't have to be funny, as long as it told a story.'Uncomedy' was born-Revolutionary!Any knob-end can write any old shit &amp; they show it! As long as it don't appeal to those nasty racists out there, what're they called..oh yeah the general public.
1300858270538702849 2020-09-02 02:09:15 +0800 <diregineez> @gregmlarsen Stalin, Mao &amp; Pol Pot, that should keep you busy!
1300857158817533953 2020-09-02 02:04:50 +0800 <diregineez> @Chrissm07537852 @SasminLeBon @drdavidbull You obviously didn't get the memo. According to the BBC's Head Of Comedy, comedy doesn't have to be funny, as long as it  tells a story. Well they've certainly succeeded with shows like 'Fleashit' &amp; 'Nosher Kumar'. Part of the BBC's innovation, 'Uncomedy' it's revolutionary!
1300588671205343236 2020-09-01 08:17:57 +0800 <diregineez> @AshpoleWilliam I'm sure the GERMAN in charge of the BRITISH MUSEUM is interested in presenting British History accurately, aren't you? Do you think they had to go to the EU to recruit him, coz British academics are not qualified/too lazy/not interested?
