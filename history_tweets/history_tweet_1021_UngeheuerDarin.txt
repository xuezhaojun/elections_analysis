1343720690873233408 2020-12-29 08:49:12 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Tens of millions of Iranians have had their lives ruined by Trump's *Adelson-ordered sanctions. Trump appoints the Trump-hating Jhew Elliot Abrams as "special envoy for Iran policy", and exploits a severe corona epidemic to destroy Israel's target.  https://t.co/8G4PHy97La  https://t.co/j45X5EvlnY
1343718506077032449 2020-12-29 08:40:31 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> William Pierce named the Green March as the beginning of the death of the West. Spanish soldiers removed the mines and left the border. Socialist parties perfected the use of waves of immigrants to destroy the Right, to which White voters were steadily moving in Western nations.  https://t.co/q2JT63eFAU
1343717575793004544 2020-12-29 08:36:49 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> In 1975, Morocco sent a "Green March" of hundreds of thousands of civilians, with socialist red banners, into Western Sahara, knowing the Spanish wouldn't fire on unarmed immigrants. No longer allowed, after nationalism was replaced by leftism post-WWII.   https://t.co/ebsDClqXhR

1343347159316500481 2020-12-28 08:04:55 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 25% of the Central African Republic's population have now become refugees bc of a guerilla. Russia sends 300 invited military instructors before election.  Washington calls for "transparency". Would they listen to Russian requests in outright US invasions?  https://t.co/HyXgchHQ5o
1343345989055356934 2020-12-28 08:00:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING It was an impressive victory, and also the sea battle at Salamis. But would it really be so different if the Persians had won? They might have stayed a while to get tax money but then been ousted. Alexander took all of Persia but it was eventually free of Greek control again.
1343344647284928512 2020-12-28 07:54:56 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Looks about right  https://t.co/Uc882heSqW
1343220711087869955 2020-12-27 23:42:28 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING This is the same as the Five Star Movement abandoning Lega Nord and entering a coalition with the Social Democrats in Italy, who they were founded to oust.  The socialists' demand was that the borders be opened for their immigrant voters again. FSM has now lost most supporters.

1342825927261233152 2020-12-26 21:33:44 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Why does  https://t.co/lhTlGDyQOZ keep publishing the nutcases Gary Barnett and Bill Sardi?

They're right across the border! And they have one of the world's largest armies! They could roll in with hundreds of tanks.

He knows it's risk-free for him; Syrians can't fight back, and all the media will applaud him. However, occupying Damascus is something I think he won't do. Even next-door Turkey has de-escalated its involvement with the Turkmen in Syria.

Kurds who let ISIS escape from Mosul. ISIS hurried to hand over the oil fields to them when Syria's military was approaching.
1342538774274859009 2020-12-26 02:32:41 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @ElenaHaskins @N0H8ING Indeed. As the video says, Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and didn't allow experts critical of the war to testify. He controlled the Senate debate this way.

Especially egregious when Britain arrests 10-15 people a day for writing online, and he himself was stalked around his neighborhood as the UKIP leader. Had to leave an interview at a pub when a communist woman called the other communists.

She phoned her mother at home, and said, "In Iran you can't criticize religion. (She meant Shia Islam.) But here, you can't criticize AFRICANS."  Her mother was shocked. Like everywhere else in the world, it's taken for granted you don't want them.

1341855527534538758 2020-12-24 05:17:42 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Tracey has a hard time now; he knows there was immense election fraud but can't be partisan. So he has to scoff at Giuliani being a grifter, things like that; pick out some morsels here and there while avoiding the gorilla in the room. A spending bill like this gives him a break.
1341854738229432322 2020-12-24 05:14:34 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @RacistClip Just an aside - the Vikings show was awesome in the first seasons, but then they took it downhill. Raiding a Muslim town in Spain, Floki is awed by a mosque. Inside the mosque, Muslims keep praying despite armed intruders. The Koran explicitly says to stop praying and fight.

1341854043858202631 2020-12-24 05:11:49 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @RacistClip It's funny how even pointing out something like "0.2% of the world's population" is anti-Semitic.

It's fructose. Not as bad as candy sugar, which is 50% fructose and 50% glucose - the combination worsens the effect. But it's still bad.  And peanut butter. Well done, Pfizer.

They always supported doing business with whoever was in charge in any country they would buy oil from, not get involved in local politics. The neocons were not oil people but Israel's relatives.

1341457215228669957 2020-12-23 02:54:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Mangan150 Not in a single tweet mentioning that vegetarianism comes from the Left.  "Meat is murder! You are a murderer!" Their strategy for generations has been to make Westerners hate ourselves, so we will think we don't deserve to live and accept mass immigration of the Left's voters.
1341456742358654978 2020-12-23 02:53:05 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Mangan150 Or people like grains. No, I'm not saying it's healthy.  Fast-food stands only if people like meat, and they have lots of money. Yet you say they're in on the conspiracy because they have veggie alternatives. Never a word about the fact that leftists push "meat is murder".

Here is World Travel Awards' top-ranked hotel in the entire world 2017, in Mriya.  So of course Washington targets it with sanctions.   https://t.co/P3yA25sruf
1341191254168756226 2020-12-22 09:18:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwayGuevara___ Crimea has been Russian longer than California has been American. Only "Ukrainian" in USSR papers for administration. Crimea overwhelmingly voted to belong to Russia in 1990s but corrupt Yeltsin banned it. U.S. wanted a weak Russia. After US-sponsored Ukr. coup, they voted again.

Stop reading neocon propaganda. "annexation" Did you notice the Washington-financed coup in Ukraine? Or the fact that Crimea has always been Russian?

Russians in 1990s burned Chechnya, killed livestock, killed civilians. Chechnyans had the right to fight.  But what neocons care about is Russia supporting Iran and Syria.
1341188790329733121 2020-12-22 09:08:20 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwayGuevara___ @N0H8ING When Russia saved South Ossetia from the US-financed, Mossad-trained invading Georgian army, they held some Georgian bases briefly. And found US bomb drones, the newest in warfare at the time. Bc Georgia is north of Iran.   The warmongers never rest. They're in DC and Israel.
1341188343862874113 2020-12-22 09:06:33 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwayGuevara___ @N0H8ING Washington financed "color revolution" to overthrow the elected govt in Georgia. TRIPLED Georgia's army - trained by Mossad and CIA, but paid only by the US. Then Georgia attacked Russian-speaking South Ossetia.  Russia blamed for "aggression" by *media when they saved Ossetia.
1341187798561415171 2020-12-22 09:04:23 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwayGuevara___ @N0H8ING Russia sells gas to Europe, builds pipeline to Germany. The U.S. pressures Germany to stop the pipeline, warns of "serious consequences," as Washington wants to sell more expensive U.S. gas.  "Russia is our opposition!" No, Washington and Israel are everyone's opposition.
1341187285275070466 2020-12-22 09:02:21 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwayGuevara___ @N0H8ING "Russia is our opposition" You seriously think they would start a war against the U.S.? Or what, Russians would take control of American media and Hollywood? Another race did that.  Russia wants what's best for Russia, that's nationalism. You have been taught to see that as bad.

Washington approved of the massacre of hundreds and the death of democracy bc the elected president had opened the border.

Could it mean you can have a society without mentioning racism a single time?  And if it's "everywhere," doesn't that mean to stop mass immigration, for peace?

1340819937313648642 2020-12-21 08:42:38 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @blondenfun1 The Orthodox Church sees Putin as the one who gave them a revival. And the Orthodox Church is very much anti-communist.
1340819792815677440 2020-12-21 08:42:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @blondenfun1 I do not approve of blind Putin worship. He plays his own game, and has stifled the publishing of nationalist literature. And the police harass nationalists who put pamphlets in mailboxes. But he is conservative, and certainly nationalist for his country.
1340819193743216641 2020-12-21 08:39:41 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @blondenfun1 Russia is communist? With private banks and businesses and a stock market? With the communist party beaten in elections? Visit a communist forum, they hate Putin intensely. He is far more conservative than e.g. the GOP, which approves of Affirmative Action and mass immigration.
1340818146941231105 2020-12-21 08:35:32 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SerbLARP @N0H8ING Putin is the best there is in Russia I suppose, when he's not harassing nationalist orgs. Russia will never be a friend of West Europeans, but the neocons and Dems lie about Russia regarding Ossetia, Ukraine, Syria, etc. A mixed case. And yes, of course not a Marxist.

Putin is far more conservative than for example the GOP today. What leftism does Putin stand for? GOP approves of Affirmative Action and mass immigration. Your turn.

But now he deleted them all. How odd. Maybe after @CitatBot showed where his pic really comes from.

CNN picked those colors to fill in Bush and Gore wins on their map in the studio that time. They couldn't admit Clinton had been repudiated, so the talking point became "permanently red and blue states" instead.

Or, best not mention the leftists at all, right?

That proves CAPITALISM!!! is behind it all!"  Meanwhile class is never mentioned as a factor when it comes to the workers who actually do the rioting. Only when it comes to others brainwashed by leftist media.

So because some Jhews - who are about 90 percent leftist - are in the media, which are not owned by the government, that means their anti-White propaganda is actually "liberal CAPITALISM!"  But their work through government is not socialism. Despite them inventing it.

While allowing the central Asians to move to western Russia, banning the sale of nationalist literature, and using the police to pick up and harrass nationalists. Done some good things, some bad.

The blood needs a certain sourness or you die. The body corrects itself. But it's easy to measure stomack PH with urine sticks, so you'll feel like your changes have an effect.

Which wasn't the official reason for the firing. Thereby publicly making it personal.

Trump asked him to stay. Always trying to appease the establishment. Let an anti-Trump guy staff the WH with interns from the campaigns of his enemies, practically begging for leaks.

Look at Trump's main campaign donors this time: Sheldon Adelson and the other similar guy, I forget the name. They control the GOP, he had to appease them.

The MAGA agenda's opposition to immigration comes from her. She stuck her neck out for Trump in 2015 and stood by him. But he ridiculed her for pointing out that he didn't do what he promised. Like end DACA.

But these are both people Trump has insulted. He has thrown so many under the bus.  He had a poster of Assange in his campaign HQ in 2015. "I love that guy!" Then later said "I don't know Assange." Like, come on.

But Trump has often failed to do obvious things. He is so disconnected from nationalist discussion.

Even if he didn't stop mass immigration, imagine having that one thing at least.

1338709487079878657 2020-12-15 12:56:28 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 There were many pro-Trump men who wanted to be in the Trump administration, but who were ignored. He wanted to appease the GOP instead. Those who know the history of trying to "cut a deal" could have told him how that would work. He should have been the bull in the china shop.

All US-supported states are pro-Israel, and all those targeted are pro-Palestinian, I wrote. The Lobby always gets what it wants.  He refused to believe it. "There are many factors."
1338705569633464321 2020-12-15 12:40:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING It's a Jhewish tactic to always repeat an accusation over and over, forever. The accusation that is the easiest to use. (Like "Duke is a former Klansman." Every. Time.) Public figures will keep silent about the election fraud, knowing that otherwise they'll be marked for life.
1338705055906721792 2020-12-15 12:38:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING Those who produced and counted the fake votes could brag about it in online videos, and nothing would get done.

It's CI types who want to say "Israel's twelve lost tribes are Whites, actually," who have settled for "Jesus was White".
1337809470139867137 2020-12-13 01:20:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING It's a universalist religion, it does not condemn Jhews, who were its founders and the ones who spread it. It was a part of Judaism until they finally split when Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans. Individual Whites opposing Jhews does not mean Christianity does.
1337809075996938240 2020-12-13 01:18:33 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING Against this we always get that one part, "Jesus said they were of the devil". That's a bad translation. He was talking about villagers who believed the Pharisees instead of him. IN THE SAME STORY he says those at the celebration who believed him instead, were not of the devil.
1337808606444531713 2020-12-13 01:16:41 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING And regardless of individual Christians being suspicious of Jhews, that suspicion is not supported by the Bible stories, where Jeshua goes out of his way to show all peoples should be loved, shocking his Jhewish followers. This was set in stone, couldn't be changed.

Feminists hate Pretty Woman as it is a version of the Cinderella concept, which is present in 99% of Harlequin novels. Where women dream of a handsome and rich man to uplift them. In Pretty Woman she clearly knows her life before him was bad.  https://t.co/BRVABJaBJ4

Labour's communist leader froze the economy, so Margaret Thatcher won with huge margins three times, and the country flowered.  So they changed tack. Smiling Tony Blair increased college students to half the population, a perfect brainwashing machine.

And of course, neocons celebrate the thought of turning from a republic into a caesarian empire - as long as it attacks Israel's pro-Palestinian targets.

So an Israeli got an editorial post at the press agency. He writes about how Judeo-Galactic heritage demands open borders for the Zerg.

He dissolved parliament, and imprisoned and tortured Arab Spring protesters with the help of Saudi tanks. The police and military are imported from Sunni Pakistan.

1337332240888582150 2020-12-11 17:43:47 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @casijndegraaff Honestly, this can't be true. A country will not only specialize in goods with their most abundant factor, they will also produce some of the rest, for local convenience if nothing else. But they will probably do more of what is most efficient for them. This is simply logical.

Cripple Japan's economy, arm and train China, supply USSR and Britain, build bases close to Japan, trace German submarines for the UK to bomb them, etc. Roosevelt/Churchill were very explicit.  https://t.co/DhOulvt3rA
1335988069489659906 2020-12-08 00:42:31 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 7. The old Bismarck hoped in vain to be named an advisor to the new kaiser. However, Kaiser Wilhelm II did visit him in 1897. Bismarck warned him of reckless policies and predicted a large war within 20 years. Possibly from "some damned foolish thing in the Balkans".
1335987400313610249 2020-12-08 00:39:52 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 6. The new kaiser, Wilhelm II, forced Bismarck to retire in 1890, and the alliances fell apart.  Bismarck won a Reichstag seat as a National Liberal in 1894. But he was embarrassed for having been forced to a second round by an unknown Social Democrat, and never took his seat.
1335986250604539904 2020-12-08 00:35:18 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Bismarck also allied with Italy and Hungary. Germany's position has always been precarious, with Great Powers on all sides. France always sought to ally with Russia (or Britain, or Italy) against Germany. Especially after 1870, to once again take Elsass and Lothringen.
1335985406450556933 2020-12-08 00:31:56 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 5. In 1871 the unified Germany was an economic powerhouse, which would even produce more coal and steel than Britain. Bismarck had allied with Britain, Austria and Russia, defeated France and created a nationalist monarchy with a modern economy.
1335984868778528774 2020-12-08 00:29:48 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 4. Bismarck expelled the Jesuits from Germany, weakening papal influence. Catholic schools were placed under government control. But he also allied with Catholics against the socialists, such as the publisher *Reuters, who would make constant new claims to gain followers.
1335983673808719874 2020-12-08 00:25:03 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 3. Otto von Bismarck came up with the idea of state-guaranteed pensions for the old, though the age was set at 70, the average lifespan in Germany at the time. This to counter the socialists' ever-increasing demands. Pensions was a new idea, as people didn't retire at the time.
1335983273789575168 2020-12-08 00:23:28 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> The reparations demands by Bismarck were lenient. By comparison, France sought to crush Germany with reparations demands after WWI, the third attack by France. (Napoleon's invasion and 1870 were the first two. WWII would be the fourth.)
1335982698205163521 2020-12-08 00:21:11 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> 2. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870 was the French attempt to recapture its leading role, after Prussia defeated Austria in 1866. France lost. Bismarck then gave the French army their rifles back to free Paris from the "Paris Commune," socialists vandalizing and looting the city.
1335982179994701826 2020-12-08 00:19:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Interesting Bismarck facts:  1. Three quick wars - against, Denmark, Austria and France - had the result of detaching the smaller German states from alliances with outside forces. Germany could finally be united, the goal of nationalist and liberal movements.
1335980899196923911 2020-12-08 00:14:02 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TCollaborator Speaking of facial hair, Bismarck.  Whenever cuckservatives in Breitbart comments etc talk about "he's a FASCIST and fascists are LEFTIST," because real conservatism is somehow never using the government for anything, I think of Otto von Bismarck. By their logic a leftist.  https://t.co/yKy17B2pJs

1335977079301607429 2020-12-07 23:58:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TCollaborator Tradcons know perfectly well that having sex is part of dating. But they use "people have sex like animals today" to bash all non-marital sex. Because they aren't having any.  They'd also say things like youths go to the gym to have sex. It would just drive ordinary people away.
1335976470150307840 2020-12-07 23:56:26 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TCollaborator If an ideology/religion would start saying "except for..." with a list after each rule, people would lose interest. And others would use this to say that they can ignore the broad rules entirely. So they have to talk broadly only. Which some then use to sound superior.
1335976073025163264 2020-12-07 23:54:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TCollaborator These tradcons exploit conservatism like ISIS exploits Islam and communism exploits socialism. And so on. An ideology or religion will always talk in broad strokes, and can't list the nuances, exceptions, different circumstances. The fundamentalists latch on to the broad strokes.
1335975649039839235 2020-12-07 23:53:10 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TCollaborator It's from the manosphere blogs, which instead started focusing on the Trump campaign in 2015. In the comments you'd always have these grumpy older loners who just wanted to bash women, and bash young people who dated and had fun. Always with "Why aren't you having children, huh?"

1334977515459383303 2020-12-05 05:46:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo The ruling party started allowing businessmen as members in the 1990s, after Deng Xiaoping's reforms. I used to know a girl who was a party member, but as she said, anyone can be that, it doesn't mean anything. The upper levels decide anyway.
1334977241890107396 2020-12-05 05:45:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo This comes from talking to different Chinese students who don't know each other. They all gave the same picture with their thoughts about the party.
1334977078006050824 2020-12-05 05:45:12 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo Pretty much all in China hate the ruling party, as it's just full of people who want to enrich themselves.  Still it would probably be a folly to have democracy in the country. Or maybe not. But anyhow, while most Chinese don't like communism, they don't call the party communist.
1334976660068839425 2020-12-05 05:43:33 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo After that it was simply "we'll do the best we can" on a national level, quietly admitting that private enterprise was needed, and on the personal level everyone looking out for themselves, as always in communist countries after some generations. Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, same.
1334976390903554050 2020-12-05 05:42:28 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo After Mao's death, with twenty million dead and the nation impoverished, Deng Xiaoping was called back from exile in the western provinces. He gathered other dissenters and saved the economy. The Cultural Revolution's terror made the Chinese cynical, wary of ideological slogans.
1334976068080562176 2020-12-05 05:41:11 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @3502zippo China isn't communist, and it is nationalist, but not in the way we'd be in the West. People are treated badly by a party people hate. The party doesn't really have an ideology. (If it was communist they'd ban private business.)

Of course, there are other companies that make paperback novels, and some might include Blacks. These are dwarfed by the Harlequin production.

1334232615847682050 2020-12-03 04:26:59 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Steve_Sailer A fun fact about Harlequin novels: There are no Blacks in them.  The "dark man" genre is usually about an Italian/Greek billionaire. Or a half-Arab, Oxford-educated king or prince from a fictional country. Maybe a Hungarian. Rarely a half-Indian or half-Latino. Never Black. Ever.

1333886633410785282 2020-12-02 05:32:10 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PolskaToMy @AnnCoulter Gary Cohn bragged about it. He and Jared wrote the bank laws that undid Glass-Steagall, ensuring private savers will be ripped off again in the next crisis, like Goldman Sachs wants. Jared has caused damage to Trump and the entire U.S. by promoting his fanatic pro-Israel views
1333886284692119554 2020-12-02 05:30:47 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PolskaToMy @AnnCoulter Jared Kushner didn't betray him? Breitbart reader. Jared told AIPAC he could "handle" Trump. He demanded Trump fire Steve Bannon, who actually came up with the MAGA policies, including the Wall. He buddied up with fellow Democrat Gary Cohn, who stole papers from Trump's desk.
1333885891442577411 2020-12-02 05:29:13 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @armandtennis @AnnCoulter This ties in to what I've always said. Trump's biggest strength was a billionaire could finance his own campaign, so people dared vote for him in the primaries. (Then he asked Adelson for money anyway.) But his business is also his biggest weakness. Vulnerable when many hate him.

1333753591811567622 2020-12-01 20:43:30 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @De80fenderJapan @KLuminess @BepDelta Netflix banned the Community episode where Chang paints himself black to be a Drow elf.  The Drows were invented specifically to have black elves, because you can't allow such a species to be Whites only.  Community is also full of leftist propaganda.   https://t.co/WHFrKKEI5Z
1333752804578570240 2020-12-01 20:40:23 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Of course Netflix made a movie where the orcs are downtrodden because of racism, and the first orc cop is discriminated against. It used to be a joke after LOTR that the Hollywood bosses would portray orcs as heroes.  https://t.co/qxoqi8ycz4

Or you are just obeying the dictate of feminists and their media allies who seek to erase the words she and he. Also, "we're pregnant!" and "my partner" instead of husband/wife.

Yes, the villain/MC named Light is White in the movie, because they couldn't make a whole movie with Japanese actors, for a Western audience. But a White guy in the U.S. And Light in the anime also has blond hair.

1332765177184477184 2020-11-29 03:15:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> In *Michael Baywitzstein's Transformers 3 a robot villain tells Optimus Prime, "All these species mixing with species, it upsets the cosmic balance."

1332332158334210049 2020-11-27 22:35:14 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Language class:  10. Don't use "gaslighting" when you mean lying, to make it sound more scientific or knowledgeable. Read about what gaslighting refers to, which is not every case of lying. In fact, don't use words just because they are fashionable online to sound in-the-know.
1332259204871184384 2020-11-27 17:45:21 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Good point about the physical R2-D2 and CRPO, and CGI Jar-Jar Binks: "One shot of CRPO banging R2-D2's head in frustration is funnier than all of Jar-Jar's flailing around."

1331945424949813255 2020-11-26 20:58:30 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @N0H8ING I must disagree! You mean, there is no conservative movement in U.S. politics. But conservatism does exist. As someone wrote, if everyone lost their memory tomorrow and had to learn how to live anew, what they would find would be conservatism.
1331911776552751105 2020-11-26 18:44:47 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Uh, what? Why is one of the four judges dissenting trending, and not the five judges who made the majority decision?

1331911068302659584 2020-11-26 18:41:59 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @vdare @DavidColeStein The ex-Cruzbots and others would downvote any post on Breitbart that mentioned Trump abandoning promises: The Wall, ending DACA, infrastructure push, end the wars.  They angrily defended Kushner, knowing nothing about what he had done. Because Trump. Consequently, they hated Ann.
1331910134768017410 2020-11-26 18:38:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @vdare @DavidColeStein Though the "he's MYY president" voters David Cole talks about are really fanatic, evangelical Cruzbots who switched to Trump, when he won. I saw them on Twitter and Breitbart. From intense hate to worship. Zero mention of the anti-immigration policies that got Trump elected.
1331745787232006145 2020-11-26 07:45:12 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Language class:  9. Don't fall for calling a targeted government a person (fallible), but the favored side a country.  Like "the US fought Saddam". Compare: Iraq defended itself against Bush.  Side note: "Saddam" is filled with the media's meaning. How about, President Hussein?
1331744845220769797 2020-11-26 07:41:28 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Language class:  8. Don't say "the regime" for governments targeted by the media, but "government" for the Israel-loyal side.  ("But the US is a democracy, not Iran, that's the difference!" Both wrong. And why are Saudi Arabia, Egypt etc not "regimes" if democracy is the issue?)
1331742776967442436 2020-11-26 07:33:15 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Language class:  7. Absurdly artificial words are invented to obscure the reality attached to the real words. "Targeted assassination," "enhanced interrogation" for murder and torture. "LGBTQ+," "African-American" for homosexuals and Blacks. "EU migrants" for criminal Ghypsies.
1331740035989823493 2020-11-26 07:22:21 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Language class:  6. Don't say "a Black/Jhewish person", "an LGBT person" - but "a blonde". Making race and perversion merely an adjective, with focus on "a person" just like you are, while "a blonde" White woman - stand-in for all Whites - is a thing, separate from the reader.
1331733791933652995 2020-11-26 06:57:33 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Latinos did not vote against Prop. 16 in California to help Whites, but in order to not help Blacks, who need affirmative discrimination to stay.

I'd say ISIS when taking Mosul (1,500 vs 30,000 defenders), but it has to be wider and more consistent to make the list.

He would always say that the three top armies in world history were Alexander the Great's army, the Mongols and the Wehrmacht. All routinely mowed down enemies of comparable tech level.

No, he showed that it's the media owners, it's always been. Everything comes back to them. The other actors on their side exist because of them.

1331682013770821632 2020-11-26 03:31:48 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Takimag: Good compilation of Black gun-crime statistics. Uneducated Blacks are three times more likely to be shot by each other in the U.S. than in Brazil.

Instead, eating meat was associated with bone strength. (Of course, since homo sapiens have been meat eaters for 200,000 years.)
1330974964342788099 2020-11-24 04:42:14 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Temperatures from 1998 show no warming, and sea levels rise only an inch, at most, to the year 2100.

1329403959623168002 2020-11-19 20:39:37 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> If we have learned anything, it is that opposition only works within a party, and then only by immense effort and special circumstances. Trump would never have gotten anywhere as an Independent in 2016. He needed to win the GOP primaries to have a chance at the presidency.
1329403527437967364 2020-11-19 20:37:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> You sometimes see writers hope that the GOP or the Dems will fall and be replaced.

But since they're not a government entity, it's "corporate" that is relevant?

The news will be something you haven't seen yet. Like some mentally unstable man shooting up a Democrat office, or something else.  Just like they made up "Hunter DOSSIER is a fraud".
1324032147506737153 2020-11-05 00:53:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou Or the guy who drove all the way to Washington to force his way into the Comet Pizza place. Every single time they wrote about Pizzagate after that, that was the first thing they brought up. Never mentioning any of the countless facts, including pictures and emails. Sidetracking.
1324031813438836739 2020-11-05 00:52:38 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou And they can always make some mentally unstable guy commit an act of violence, and then they'll focus on that any time you object. Like the man who shot a Labour woman and her Muslim aide the weekend before the Brexit referendum. Never happened before or since.

In a vote in Austria, where a nationalist stood against a pro-immigration Green, one town had more votes coming in than there were actual voters. The leftist won.

As a thought experiment, it is interesting.  Now, let's say it WOULD happen. As Ron Paul said, if there'd be such separation, the focus should be on getting CA back again, but after it has changed.

And there's more.

1323797284577071107 2020-11-04 09:20:42 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SebastinPatron3 @zerohedge @DRUDGE It's absolutely hideous. The headlines are just vicious smears against Trump, and he'll have headlines that make Trump's followers look like crazy fanatics.
1323797069916786696 2020-11-04 09:19:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @miked3323 @zerohedge He is running it - people keep saying he isn't, but that was just speculation. He told a persistent reporter about how he doesn't like Trump anymore.  I remember clearly he turned in September 2019 when Trump refused to attack Iran, and instead fired *Adelson's boy John Bolton.

My girlfriend refused to watch a single episode because of the gorilla-like Black in the group, which no fans would ask for if they could have decided. I am ashamed of my own ability to accept such stuff and keep watching.
1323795833343664131 2020-11-04 09:14:56 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 @CitadelMark @SelimSeesYou The Borg was a good idea for an enemy.  I used to watch Stargate as a kid, and they had the feudalistic Goa'Uld, then the self-replicating robots who'd just wipe out all life, and the fanatic Ori worshipers from another galaxy. It was cleverly varied that way.

In 2016, supposedly Hillary was winning everywhere. In the primaries, victories predicted for Sanders - but they went to Biden. Really, we shouldn't be guessing.

1323765361293012993 2020-11-04 07:13:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 Ah, then I don't know. There were many smaller comics that came and went, I must be remembering one of those
1323764470615867393 2020-11-04 07:10:18 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 No, maybe I got the name wrong. But I remember two guys, and they had fast cars and a boat
1323764195075235842 2020-11-04 07:09:13 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 Yes, maybe that was Johnny Hazard? He had a friend, and they had money
1323763905114550278 2020-11-04 07:08:03 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 Garvin called her "Modesty" over the phone only one time, and that's how she knew he was a prisoner forced to trap her. Because he always called her "Princess" otherwise. My parents liked these comics, we also had two Modesty Blaise novels. I wish today I had saved the comics.
1323763492508356610 2020-11-04 07:06:25 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin were awesome. The charm in them being of a former crime syndicate, and they'd always have old contacts when they were traveling. That Colt revolver and Willie's knives, and his total devotion to her.
1323763063980437505 2020-11-04 07:04:43 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 Agent X9, Phil Corrigan. The writer is the same as for Flash Gordon. Every Sunday I read Flash Gordon at Comics Kingdom, they just now finished a crossover where Phil Corrigan visited the planet Mongo through a portal. I read it because it's so old and charming.

1323761921007509504 2020-11-04 07:00:10 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 I wonder if people know that's Rip Kirby. I always took it for granted that it doesn't need to be stated, but maybe it's not so obvious today. Just like there are people who don't know my avatar is of Spirou. I used to read Rip Kirby, Modesty Blaise and Agent X9 as a kid.
1323761284899364865 2020-11-04 06:57:39 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 @CitadelMark @SelimSeesYou Spencer was against Trump in 2015, no one remembers this. He wasn't in the alt-Right, he just adopted the word when he saw everyone else used it. The alt-Right started in Reddit and 4chan.  BUT I am pretty sure he voted for Trump today, not biden. He just wants attention.
1323760923564220425 2020-11-04 06:56:13 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Senpai_316 @CitadelMark @SelimSeesYou Resistance is futile. Stand by to be assimilated.  Well, Spencer also opposed Brexit because "the EU can be a White empire." (So could the UN, if the member countries voted for it.) And he wrote about Polish gi...people moving to the UK, "that is TRUE cultural enrichment."
1323760169990410240 2020-11-04 06:53:13 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @CitadelMark @GigaChadJD Yeah, he can't be serious. I don't believe it. He filled out that ballot but he actually handed in another one, for Trump.
1323759880528945155 2020-11-04 06:52:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DarnelSugarfoo @SelimSeesYou Seriously, imagine being a conservative and not voting. That might have been excused in the 1980s or whatever, but not today. The leftists are openly stating their hatred.
1323759102879764480 2020-11-04 06:48:59 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou Today Hitler would be the first to oppose using symbolism and terminology from the past. He would use the swastika, an old and very common symbol - even in the Finnish and US military, for example - but that's it. It was the time of political parties, not romanticist schemes.
1323758673739554823 2020-11-04 06:47:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou When the brown shirts were banned, they wore white shirts. Hitler didn't get himself arrested by wearing a brown shirt. When they were no longer allowed to carry sidearms, he didn't carry one. In economics he wrote, "No CONCESSION is too great to bring the workers to our side."
1323758388610797569 2020-11-04 06:46:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou Hitler was above all pragmatic and said you must adapt to the times. "You must wrap your policies in the sensibilities of the day." In an early chapter in My Struggle, he derides the "völkish" movement for dreaming about swords and knightly orders etc. Only a modern party worked.
1323758135773986817 2020-11-04 06:45:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou BUT I get away from the issue. Hitler was actually a "moderate" member of the party. Himmler, Goering and Goebbels were all more hardcore. Hitler also wasn't a top-down party leader. For one thing, he opposed adding "socialist" to the party name in the 1920s but was overruled.
1323757766310244355 2020-11-04 06:43:40 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou This grumpy professor has it right. I could have added more: That Hitler not only arrested Strasser and his entire leftist wing of the party, but also Ernst Roehm, who dreamed of an alliance with the Soviets. And so on.   https://t.co/nC3ncpDWz9
1323757535405527047 2020-11-04 06:42:45 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DDG_994 @HitorMissDSA @SelimSeesYou Indeed, Hitler formed an election coalition with another party, which was nationalist and conservative. And in parliament the NSDAP allied with the Conservatives - they were on the same side in almost every issue.  In 1933 all commies and 26 of 120 Social Democrats were arrested.

The major WN forum is Stormfront, as you know, and everyone there wants Trump to win. Knowing he is flawed but knowing what the alternative is. Same discussion as on Twitter. Only one guy keeps posting "Trump Israel!" in every thread.

1323755570193702912 2020-11-04 06:34:56 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SelimSeesYou This man became the head of a smaller bank, which was bought up by Goldman Sachs. But they were the ones who took over the GS boardroom with their own atmosphere, where they called investors "muppets" who should be fleeced. And so GS became what it is today. But I digress.
1323755151019200512 2020-11-04 06:33:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SelimSeesYou The Goldman Sachs CEO wrote that in his youth he used to hang out outside a rich-men's club. He then shared a cab to the airport with a wealthy man. The man needed to know a new topic, and the guy claimed he was an expert. Read a book about it over the weekend, got a job.
1323754793647722497 2020-11-04 06:31:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SelimSeesYou A get-rich-quick guy called *James Howard Kunstler writes that in his youth he got a Wall Street job knowing NOTHING about what to do.  But "I had curly hair, and people think guys with curly hair look smart." Sure, that was it. And the nose, too.  The *Nate Silvers have it made.
1323754168587309056 2020-11-04 06:29:22 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SelimSeesYou *Isaac Asimov said he was surprised the journalists called him as their go-to guy any time new robot technology was made. Because he wrote some sci-fi books about robots. But he didn't know anything about actual robotics.  *Nate Silver is another go-to guy. Equally unqualified.

But everyone he met in the street was another immigrant: A Turk, an Iraqi, etc.  "Where are all the Germans?" "Oh, it's the afternoon. They're still at work."
1323750871683993603 2020-11-04 06:16:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @CityBureaucrat @SelimSeesYou I do pushups with my feet up high (you use 70% of your weight that way) and a backpack full of weights. I work out at home, and once a year I confirm in the gym that I can bench press more than my body weight.  Haven't tested how many ordinary pushups I can do. I'll do that now.
1323747761188200450 2020-11-04 06:03:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Biorealism @Steve_Sailer This is like the Soviet Union. They'd claim that a failed bridge was the result of "wreckers" working for MI6 and the CIA. That Western Europe prepared to invade the USSR, not the other way around. When there was starvation, Pravda would praise the coming Land of Plenty.

I don't know why that has to be thrown in against him - or why people have to claim that the Jhew Matt Drudge is a homosexual. (Comes only from GQ putting Drudge on a list, with no proof.)

Cerno looks at least eight years older than he is. He won't have a happy old age. All those steroids and medical consequences from sleeping with transvestites take their toll.

It is well known among doctors and psychiatrists that homosexuals get gray hair early. Likely from disease and drug abuse.  He then imitates those who excuse getting fat by calling it a dad body.  https://t.co/3v4U6LHtRt  https://t.co/qMUizkO2wZ

Six years after his praise for anabolic steroids, Cerno claims that a mild steroid cream from his doctor, to dab under his eye, caused his enormous outbreaks all over his body. (You can google to see what his skin was like.)  https://t.co/NZSzO4Hsnx

"Never trust doctors!"  Some years earlier he mocked doctors for opposing steroids because "Doctors want you weak." That's Cerno. But I digress.

"It felt like my thighs were fused to the chair." He praises steroids. Then some years later blamed a mild steroid lotion a doctor prescribed for a spot in his face, for causing his enormous skin condition.
1323732663358947328 2020-11-04 05:03:55 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @go_panther @godlyworm @nc_groyp Dershowitz is infamous for digging up information to threaten victims and witnesses, and to intimidate police and prosecutors, or claim in court that they are biased. This is who Cerno calls "a personal inspiration" and "a light," with a framed photograph of the two together.
1323732328540233728 2020-11-04 05:02:35 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @go_panther @godlyworm @nc_groyp It gets especially heinous when he claims that he filed for information on behalf of Epstein's victims. He filed AGAINST them, to get info to smear or intimidate them. He filed the exact same request that Dershowitz, "a personal inspiration" and "a light," filed 2 weeks earlier.
1323732075896295424 2020-11-04 05:01:35 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @go_panther @godlyworm @nc_groyp He is a grifter, is the word.  Sad part is, Cerno actually knows better. He genuinely cares about certain issues. But he ditches them to cheerlead for Trump even when he caves, and worships Israel and praises Epstein's lawyer Dershowitz to get some work.

The only reason for this is so that leftist voters can cheat, which has been verified.
1323125140998262784 2020-11-02 12:49:50 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @stl_blonde @ColumbiaBugle This is not even something to discuss, other than when people want to lie. Barely literate lazy types voted Left, and the Left brought mass immigration. The lie is "it's ACKSHUALLY the business owners who want cheap workers!" When what they get is higher taxes for themselves.
1323124774336450567 2020-11-02 12:48:23 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @stl_blonde @ColumbiaBugle There is mass immigration in the West today because the ones who were too lazy to study in school then voted for pols who promised to steal the money from those classmates who studied hard and made something of themselves. But the Left increasingly also needed immigrant votes.
1323124210395451399 2020-11-02 12:46:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @stl_blonde @ColumbiaBugle Business owners have historically been nationalist and conservative. US today is an exception: media have targeted "racists" for generations, govt rewards its allies. As for workers they have historically betrayed their race for money, but now realize it wasn't such a good idea.

Polls are propaganda. They make people vote for the winner, or not vote at all bc they are demoralized.  But the map above is unrealistic. Read @Peoples_Pundit.

So economic policy is simply about how to distribute it, which does not affect how much wealth there will be tomorrow.
1323075500898746376 2020-11-02 09:32:35 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @CandellaFly @JackFell13 Marxism in two sentences: All groups and individuals are equal, so any difference in success can only be due to oppression. This justifies exploiting elections by bribing voter groups.

Too bad for you. Go back to your Russia Hoax now.
1323059597003923475 2020-11-02 08:29:23 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @randomrussianb2 @MisterBlackPill Most ordinary Iranians in the West don't like the religious leaders in Iran, but share those leaders' disgust for Israel and the neocon agenda. The starvation sanctions have ruined the lives of their relatives in Iran. But GOP sites always have MeK Iranians to quote.
1323059200516345859 2020-11-02 08:27:49 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @randomrussianb2 @MisterBlackPill The Islamist-Marxist MeK guerrilla, housed by Hussein in Iraqi military base, murdered Iranian police and bureaucrats. Mossad, with US money, used them to kill technicians, physicians, professors with bombs. D.C. moved them to a new base in Albania.  "Look, Iranians on Twitter!"
1323058704439271424 2020-11-02 08:25:51 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @randomrussianb2 @MisterBlackPill You know how the neocons get their "look at this pro-neocon Iranian" types. The Soviets invaded in 1941 together with Britain. They installed a communist party in northern Iran. These fled during the conservative revolution, many to the West.

After covering the country, the windmills supply ... 43% of energy. That's it.  30% of power is coal, and Denmark imports coal, nuclear and hydro energy from neighbors. And this is the BEST country for windmills.

Who were tricked into accepting turbines near their homes. Scare away fox and other animals. In water, the noise travels for miles, scaring away fish.

Golden eagles could go extinct in western USA, already weakened there.

1322655781821517826 2020-11-01 05:44:46 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Steve_Sailer Marxism rests on the claim that all individuals and groups are equal in capacity, so that any differences in success can only be because of oppression. This claim is used to justify massive control and theft to bribe voter groups. Marxism was anti-White from the beginning.

To counter that you must have more ......... Black pilots.  Genius logic.

The revolution was a nationalist cause, for the identity and freedom of a new White people, though heavily British to its nature.

We can build on that.  But if he loses "Trumpism" will be said to have been tried and rejected by the people.

Online, people get demoralized and start playing games or watch shows instead. Or talk about diets or other things. And fence sitters choose the other side instead of yours.

The winning side speaks louder during the lunch break. Those with the president, the media and the schools on their side. Other arguments can be waved away - winning trumps everything.

He just tucks in open borders in the middle somewhere, with no extra comment, so he can tell voters he mentioned it. Completely open borders are easy to oppose. Instead of opposing mass immigration, or favor building the Wall.

Of course he won't say "immigrants," which must not be criticized. Being against completely open borders is safe. Means you can still be for mass immigration.  Also, being named Madison as your first name is stupid.

The men had to be recalled, however, when it turned out most Indians didn't even know the British had arrived.

Therefore it cannot have dogma, thoughts imposed on people, which is the only way religion could be made to claim everyone on Earth is your brother and sister.

The media will only show the race and blare it out over the entire West when it's a White killing a Black, usually in self-defense. More than half of interracial murders are Blacks killing Whites.  https://t.co/pwy9OrbNC8

People voted for him because he was a billionaire who could self-fund the campaign. (And then he asked *Sheldon Adelson for money anyway.) And he was tough and worked hard.

It's the reason why Manowar's Eric Adams could sing the aria Nessun Dorma on stage and heavy metal fans cheered. He had already proven himself.

One reporter took a pic of all the propagandists.  They made kids cry by holding them over smoky fire.

1320830465423609856 2020-10-27 04:51:37 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DavidColeStein @realDonaldTrump This started after "a group specifically set up to buy Meetup" took over a few months ago, right in time for the election. (David Siegel has never revealed who are in the group.)  Members otherwise only get invitations to meetings from their own groups, which they have chosen.
1320830055472312332 2020-10-27 04:49:59 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DavidColeStein @realDonaldTrump I would like to write a story for Takimag about how Meetup is being used as David Siegel's propaganda tool since he gained full control. Or maybe I could send it to some other site, I don't know. I wrote three tweets about it here:  https://t.co/Apq1oKAErC
1320828858581614597 2020-10-27 04:45:14 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DavidColeStein @realDonaldTrump Media do this constantly. They cut and pasted a speech by anti-immigration party leader Jörg Haider in Austria - took a part where he talks about immigrants, and then cut to him suddenly shouting angrily, "We will NEVER accept this!" Switched to crowd in between to mask the cut.
1320828267436429318 2020-10-27 04:42:53 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> David Siegel is now using Meetup as his own megaphone. It was NEVER used this way before. There were no online talks held by central Meetup. Invitations to this US-invented SJW agenda are sent out to every member in the entire world, not just the US.   https://t.co/OHXj9UAlf4
1320827462461382656 2020-10-27 04:39:41 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> One of the speakers in David Siegel's propaganda talks is the anti-White Nikole Hannah-Jones, responsible for the lying 1619 Project which claimed the American states seceded from Britain because of slavery. (Even though all abolitionism at the time was in the U.S., not Britain.)
1320826913414356992 2020-10-27 04:37:30 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> This Thursday, Meetup will host an online propaganda talk about transvestites. This follows a series including healthcare is racist, Whites must submit to BLM, Whites are racist, and Whites are racist again. This is the case ever since *David Siegel gained full control in August.  https://t.co/bLRQp4x4jL

Anyway, thought of this when seeing the Taliban, Iraqi resistance etc fighting back against US/UK occupiers. The inclusion of civilians in warfare. But this time the civilians were armed.

"We will exterminate the German working class," Churchill said. It was Bomber Harris' "Splendid Idea".

While Germany, for example, built its air force as artillery for the army. The Germans, led by Hitler, wanted an international ban on bombing civilians, but Britain refused. The Westphalian Peace dragged through the soil.

What had been done haphazardly by others became an open strategy. Later, the British took this and ran with it.

Armies should be of nations, not the Church or cities, merchant leagues, orders, etc. Armies should fight each other, not civilians. Rules for diplomats, and handling war prisoners.

A small province declaring itself no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire. Normally this would be a cold conflict for a while, then negotiated and solved. Spain saw it as an excuse to invade, crush Protestantism, put a naval base in the Baltic Sea.

Disarmed the Yazidis, then left at night to let ISIS move in, murder and kidnap. Then Kurds moved back to take the land.

Exactly what Roosevelt didn't want.
1319400599826333698 2020-10-23 06:09:50 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @reviewnews1000 @dpinsen As U.S. generals and politicians knew, the Japanese feared that their emperor would be arrested and tried as a war criminal if they surrendered unconditionally. Roosevelt knew this too, which is why he asked it, so the war would continue. All to hand Asia to the communists.
1319400340240977925 2020-10-23 06:08:49 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @reviewnews1000 @dpinsen And one final digression: Nearly all the top generals in the U.S. agreed that Japan would soon surrender, but they were bombed with the atomic bomb anyway. Japan had asked for negotiations before, but were told by Roosevelt to surrender unconditionally, which no nation would do.

With their assets stolen and oil imports cut off, they feared they would suffer the same fate at the hands of Roosevelt, and Britain, France and the Soviets.
1319399664798568450 2020-10-23 06:06:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @reviewnews1000 @dpinsen 90 percent of Americans opposed Roosevelt's hopes of going to war for communism, so he asked his cabinet for ways to provoke Japan, Germany's ally, to strike the first blow. They froze Japan's assets and cut off their oil, so their industries would stop and they'd be easy prey.

They have been actively seeking non-Whites their entire existence. They gather Africans to ship to the US and call Latino immigration "a great opportunity". In all this they cemented the Left's cultural agenda too.
1319216960626970624 2020-10-22 18:00:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @ThyLordThyGod @White_History Yes, let's turn this against the Church of England instead.

1319072427364831232 2020-10-22 08:25:48 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @MintChipMusic @AnnCoulter FBI to announce that Trump rallies are a "major Election Security issue".  Activist judge will ban the rallies, Supreme Court split 4-4 on the case with Roberts smirking before the cameras.  Basement Biden will be collected from home when it's time for Harris' inauguration.
1319071003063050240 2020-10-22 08:20:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @GazeWest @skinnypresident Anyone who is Catholic and against immigration should leave that organization. You can be Catholic without paying membership dues to the Vatican, can't you? Of course, THEY say you can't. But I don't recall anything about being directed from a church in Rome, in the Bible.
1319070675823374336 2020-10-22 08:18:50 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @GazeWest @skinnypresident I couldn't refrain from giving a long reply to a Catholic in that thread. I wouldn't. Except he started a "no, YOU" against Protestants.  There are anti-White protestants, but it's not the same as the majority non-White Cath Church completely devoted to mass immigration.
1319070230153482245 2020-10-22 08:17:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @politics_boreme @PatriotZoomer Any Catholic who supports the White race should stop supporting the majority non-White, pro-immigration Catholic organization. Be Catholic without supporting the homosexual Vatican leaders.  https://t.co/VWYwZZ5TPn
1319069875709595651 2020-10-22 08:15:40 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @politics_boreme @PatriotZoomer Yes, there are anti-White protestants. But there is no church so completely devoted to an anti-White agenda as the majority non-White Catholic church. Which started off massacring Whites, including "heretic" Christian Whites, and has never improved from this state.
1319069384216842240 2020-10-22 08:13:42 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @politics_boreme @PatriotZoomer The Cath Church is one of the major proponents of mass immigration in the U.S., one of the main allies of the Hollywood owners. Bishops call Mestizo mass immigration "an opportunity". Of course it's part of the Cath Church's plan to flood the U.S. with Catholic swarthies.
1319068972600483842 2020-10-22 08:12:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @politics_boreme @PatriotZoomer "But Protestants worse"  Totally not Catholic countries plus Greek Orthodox flooding Europe with immigrants who by EU law should have to stop in those countries.  Cath Church is majority non-White.  Anti-White Cath Church has stations in Africa gathering immigrants to ship to US.

While it's not a real parliament, it has duties and debate. But who'd want to join if a few large nations dominated? Some issues are general. But some are about specific national interests. And general opinion differs between nations.

But you can't say it's a "right" when someone else has to provide it for you. Then again, Cerno is no deep thinker.  "may trigger some" Typical snide comment.
1317981047477370880 2020-10-19 08:09:03 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> There was a time when Scott Adams provided intelligent comments like this one repeatedly. In 2015 and 2016.

There should be only one way to vote early, like elsewhere: Go to voting stations where your sealed vote is put in a box held by several people, with no one person having the only key. You show your ID and they note your name so you can't vote again.

Because they have no international media or business or innovation, they are entirely dependent on Western Europe and the U.S., which are the main target. And Easterners help in flooding Western Europe.

Like I said: Could just tell people the facts I know about the camps that are not disputed - and the facts about how the war started, like the Polish dictator three times asking France for a joint invasion of Germany in the 1930s.

Odd how people didn't want that. I guess backward fantasies about a flat Earth and submitting to jealous priests with no life of their own has its own drawbacks.

Because "the greatest friend of the Slavs" wanted to give the Serbian province in Austria-Hungary autonomy like Czechia. They'd be even more reluctant to join the poorer, junta-controlled Serbia then.
1317810487854333952 2020-10-18 20:51:18 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @DrunkAustrian @SelimSeesYou The irony is Austria's "crime" was to invade Serbia to get the terrorists who were armed and transported by a military junta to kill Austria's archduke. (A junta who had massacred Serbia's royal family). What they wrongly accused the Taliban of later, and invaded Afghanistan for.

Cleopatra was the first in the family to bother learning Egyptian. They had spoken only Greek for generations, showing this worked perfectly fine in the ruling class in Egypt.

The problem is, the second type of area is slowly widening.

Whenever someone says "there's no difference between Left and Right" - oh yes, there is. In countless issues like these, big and small. The Left is against the Right's focus on building, which determines how the Right evaluates things.
1317224682312040449 2020-10-17 06:03:31 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @scythyphus @CityBureaucrat A male teacher in junior high told us that "Machiavelli was crazy!" And "he only uses cold logic!" He hadn't read Machiavelli's book The Prince. I had. (I was fourteen.) In an Italy torn apart by mercenary wars, he wrote the facts he had observed about how to unite, and end wars.
1317224268904759302 2020-10-17 06:01:53 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @scythyphus @CityBureaucrat The "logic is cold" nonsense is very much from Star Trek, where they abuse the word logic every time Spock uses it. What he actually meant was "efficiency at the expense of other things you care about so Scotty can be shocked". Logic is to know how things work, how you do things.
1317223381083824129 2020-10-17 05:58:21 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @scythyphus @CityBureaucrat Same teacher told us that women are greater because "the brain halves are more connected in problem solving," so that sacred Feelings are involved, not just Cold Evil Logic.  Which in reality means you convince yourself of what you want to be true, instead of adapting to truth.
1317223090179526664 2020-10-17 05:57:12 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @scythyphus @CityBureaucrat You can always come up with some pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo to argue that "time is a circle," but it has no meaning in real life. Did we start the same year in school over and over again? Of course not. But if there are anti-Western points to score, logic is irrelevant.
1317222694492962816 2020-10-17 05:55:37 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @scythyphus @CityBureaucrat When I was a kid, our leftist teacher told us that "In India they see time as a circle!" which was Living In Harmony With Nature, while "seeing time as linear" was cold Western capitalism, etc.  I was the only one who objected. It ISN'T a circle. She refused to admit that.

It goes without saying illegals shouldn't be counted since the whole point with the count is about allotting political power to the voters, who are not illegals.

And they use the fact that the Right has been defeated, and filled with cuckservatives promoted by the media owners, as "proof" that the Right is also responsible.  Nationalists have always known the Right "follows two steps behind" the Left. But it's the Left that plans.

It's just that some who have voted for the Left can't handle the fact that it's their side that caused feminism, homosexual agenda, immigration, and the rest.
1316898991062327296 2020-10-16 08:29:20 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 14. It's funny then to see some of those voters, when they turn against the immigration they have always voted for, claim that "ACKSHUALLY, since the Democrats (in the U.S. version) don't oppose the existence of private business, they're a right-wing party!" Genius.

Better to favor a small group of allies instead, with government contract, with regulations that favor them.  Meanwhile they tell their voters, "Business is BAD!"
1316898457139990528 2020-10-16 08:27:13 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 12. And it was the Left that took over the universities and used them and the mass media, and especially Hollywood, to brainwash people. Leftist governments never tell their duped voters, but they have always sought alliances with the most brainwashed in the top boardrooms.

It was the Left that demanded the colonies, which had become steadily whiter, be abandoned by the European empires after WWII.

Business owners always favored tariffs the most, since they wanted to be able to go to the factory and home in the same day, not have to travel to India.
1316897636239237122 2020-10-16 08:23:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 9. Well, the duping of the people has kept going since then. But Whites became more literate and wealthier, and steadily left the Left. So since at least the 1970s they have sought to replace Whites with immigrants, to get new voters. UK's Labour even wrote this as a formal plan.
1316897183816421377 2020-10-16 08:22:10 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 8. "The factories just stand there, permanently. Materials in, products out. There's nothing to count or decide.

After the French Revolution, the Left got its chance again during industrialization, when illiterate peasants moved to the city and could be easily duped, as they knew nothing about how an economy worked. Many still thought the Earth was flat.
1316896500241321986 2020-10-16 08:19:27 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 6. Most French had wanted to keep the king, who was falsely accused of treason so he could be executed. That is why they made the French flag, the combination of Versailles white and Parisian red and blue.
1316896236239261696 2020-10-16 08:18:24 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 5. Robespierre put a price ceiling on bread, instead of improving the conditions for production, such as by lowering taxes. The price ceiling meant bread disappeared from the markets, as peasants couldn't afford producing it. This was a major reason Robespierre was deposed.
1316896007507030017 2020-10-16 08:17:29 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad 4. When Vendée resisted, men, women and children were tied together and drowned. 170,000 people died.  https://t.co/vlrfuysXED  Two thirds of those guillotined by the Left were peasants.

They discussed taking all the children from the two German provinces and spreading them across the country, since they didn't speak the language of the Revolution. Everything was supposed to be changed in society, the old erased.

The Left was fanatically egalitarian. They talked about cutting off church towers since they were undemocratically tall. A mandatory citizen uniform for eguality.
1316894061752733696 2020-10-16 08:09:45 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad Now, political history.  1. In the French Assembly, those who who wanted a constitutional monarchy like Britain sat to the right of the speaker. Those who wanted a republic and total upheaval, and who started killing people, sat to the left. That's where Left and Right come from.
1316893562974371840 2020-10-16 08:07:46 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad By the way, I used to push for the word "globalism" incessantly about fifteen years ago in nationalist and conservative forums. Glad to see it take off.
1316893286171332608 2020-10-16 08:06:40 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Art_Allm @cursedsalad And globalism is invented by the Left, after the fall of the Western empires bc the Left said they were racist, fascist after WWII.  "Western Nationalism degenerated into Zionism" - sweeping declarations always have an audience. Some nationalist parties are this way, others not.

First of all, if a woman who has many followers on Instagram has OnlyFans, you can always find the vids and pics for free through Google. Indians save and upload them. Second, haven't people ever heard of porn sites? XVideos?

And the ones on the "Right" are mainly neocons, who are leftists who add war against Israel's targets, the few pro-Palestinian governments in the region. Nice try, Scottwitz.

Just like I imagine Africans considered their slaves to be humans. 3/5ths was only about the North's reluctance to add a full slave count to the census and thereby hand over the House to the South.
1316138333811154945 2020-10-14 06:06:46 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @CityBureaucrat The "Blacks were counted as three fifths of humans!" line is such BS. It was the SOUTH that wanted to count the slaves FULLY as part of the population, as that would give Southern states more House representatives. Northerners opposed counting slaves. So the compromise was 3/5th.

Catholic Bysantine also waged decades of increasingly religious war against Pagan Persia, handing the Middle East to the Arabs. But again, I digress.
1315443692623273984 2020-10-12 08:06:30 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ Sadly, this invasion meant the end of ancient Rome, beginning of the Dark Ages. When Italy's cities were emptied and the fields burned, so the invading Bysan army couldn't even stay as there was no food to eat. So the Lombards easily took over when they arrived. But I digress.
1315443131333193729 2020-10-12 08:04:16 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ To fit Jeshua into a Pagan-style trinity they turned him into the god Yahweh, who he called "father". The early Christians said, and wrote in Bible texts, he existed before, but was God's son - not God. But the Arian Christians were massacred, Rome destroyed, by the Bysan Caths.
1315442335598227456 2020-10-12 08:01:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ Might be why the cross was appropriated by the anti-Roman Christian servants and freed slaves who were slaughtering thousands. We know that the execution method for Jeshua wasn't +-shaped, used in the northern Empire, but T-shaped. It wasn't the initial symbol for the religion.

And praise the group they bring in to fill out their ranks in Hollywood.
1315429684289691652 2020-10-12 07:10:50 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ Speaking of which, the trinity was an old Pagan belief among the Aryan peoples. From Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to Odin, Tor and Frey in early Nordic mythology.  And the Pagan cross stood for the four directions and the four seasons - so all land and time, i.e. the world.
1315429075956232197 2020-10-12 07:08:25 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ And of course, the story about the fertility god, or the son of a fertility goddess, who dies for a good harvest, then to be reborn at the time of the harvest, was an ancient Celtic belief from Gaul to the Alps - well known by those who wrote the Bible stories.
1315428694681411586 2020-10-12 07:06:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ The church also placed Scandinavia's largest church on the site of the largest Nordic temple in Uppsala, where Nordic rulers used to gather with their followers. The Church has a long history of appropriating local Pagan customs. Turning legendary people into saints, etc.
1315427880956985346 2020-10-12 07:03:40 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ But if we're speaking about appropriating from another religion - Jeshua ("Jesus" to make him sound Roman) was thought to have been born in the spring. But this was moved to just a few days after the Winter Solstice to appropriate that celebration in northern Europe.
1315427146098241536 2020-10-12 07:00:45 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @_forest_seeker_ "and essentially just worship them in a Christian manner"  Not true at all. The Nordic gods are a source of great symbolism for nationalism in northern Europe, without believing they are literally real. Just like people celebrate Christmas without actually believing Santa exists.

1313667113039605760 2020-10-07 10:27:01 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> I come to think of that story recently about a Black man shot by a Black from a rival gang, as he was going to a funeral for a Black shot by another gang, who was going to the funeral of a Black who was shot by another gang. Only Africans accomplish this kind of stories.

Now only 2.6% are Blacks. Mexican gangs commit crimes, but not at the same rate, and so randomly violent, as the Black gangs.  https://t.co/zT3zQgtBwi  https://t.co/DIm0UuvHvv

1313662055715663872 2020-10-07 10:06:55 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Voltaire, of course, could never imagine that democracy would mean permanent politicians, political parties, rallies and other threats. Or that the Left would form, as a method to systematically buy votes to get the well-paid seats in parliament.
1313661508161867779 2020-10-07 10:04:44 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> The Founding Fathers were right; there should not be "universal suffrage".  That was never the point of democracy - which was about ensuring you could vote away a tyrant. For that you simply needed a limited, capable group of voters. That's what the democracy philosophers wanted.  https://t.co/cnirAaxQYV

Blacks are only 13% of the population but committed 55% of murders in 2018. And your response is "notallblacks!"  90% of interracial rape is Blacks raping White women. "notallblacks!" So move to an all-Black hood then.

1312889799188119559 2020-10-05 06:58:15 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 Liberals wrote about the natural order of races, how there could be no free society without Whites leading it. No such thing appeared in socialism, where Marx' anti-White son-in-law bragged about having the blood of "four oppressed races," and prized the Black blood the most.
1312889427069472775 2020-10-05 06:56:46 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 "Liberalism," the real kind in Europe, was about abolishing remaining feudal laws. And opposing glorification of the endless petty European wars. Liberals were nationalist students who supported German unification and Scandinavian unification.
1312889033350144001 2020-10-05 06:55:12 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 "Put us in power and we'll reward you with the Oppressors' money, and punish those people you hate, those who studied hard in school and went somewhere."  An excuse for stealing. Used by Jhews to replace the White elite with themselves and their allies.
1312888709747019776 2020-10-05 06:53:55 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 Egalitarianism is the basis for socialism, though through the media it has wormed its way into cuckservatism as well. Egalitarianism: "All are equal in capacity, so if some individuals or groups of people have more that can only be because of oppression."
1312888466972315648 2020-10-05 06:52:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 The French Revolution was inarguably leftist. They wanted to cut off the towers on churches as they were "undemocratically" tall. That's some real-world leveling there. They also considered a mandatory citizen uniform, and other ideas like that. Mao picked it up later.
1312888235094347777 2020-10-05 06:52:02 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @TalentEvaluator @Happy_Doomer77 That's not "liberal", no matter how much Americans abuse that word post-WWII, when the Left hijacked it. That's socialism, by definition the word for the Left, whether social democrat parties or communist parties.
1312887950942691328 2020-10-05 06:50:54 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Happy_Doomer77 Whatever happened to old trucker movies? You'd have a character hitching a ride and ending up in a trucker race across the Midwest.  Of course, hitchhiking came to an abrupt end and no one even remembers it.

In a video she said she met a woman in there who made these wonderful sweaters, and now Martha started selling that kind of sweater. See? Suddenly prison was a good thing.

Nationalism has said over and over that all types of people in society are necessary. All "classes". Which is obvious once you get involved in the hallowed production, or the evil selling of the production, or whatever. You'll see.

The Marxist ideology taught in schools. "This class is good, that one is bad! Put us in power!"  See through it. Those producers you praise don't condemn those who sell their products. It's the point.

1312856127072342020 2020-10-05 04:44:27 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Typical conversation with leftists:  X has bragged about being Black, immigrant or whatever, and acts accordingly, so I point out that X is Black, immigrant or whatever.

The Byzan army leaving when there was no food, Ostrogoths and Romans could offer no resistance. No wonder the Arabs could take Sicily. Byzantine also fought Persia, giving the Arabs their chance.
1311806125428428805 2020-10-02 07:12:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> And after all that, Byzantine invaded Italy in 535, emptied the cities of people, burned the fields, to destroy Arianer Christianity for the Catholic Church. The final end of Rome and the beginning of the Dark Ages. The Byzan army couldn't stay as there was nothing left to eat.
1311805471360249860 2020-10-02 07:09:31 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> The aqueducts fell into disrepair - how to make concrete was forgotten for centuries. This caused widespread disease.

You support the BLM rioters who have murdered people in the streets, and burned and looted the stores innocent people have built. But you suspend a guy simply for supporting the president.

"Breitbart readers want pro-immigration fanatic Amy Coney Barrett? Okay. Because I've already said that it has to be a sacred woman, in order to please the leftist media. That'll make them stop hating me."
1306935711870967809 2020-09-18 20:38:50 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Dallashooker Hmm, what? The Constitution written fifteen years after the revolution?
1306935415715360768 2020-09-18 20:37:39 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> America's destiny in the erarly 20th century was to dominate South America, which could easily have been done. Instead they went to destroy Germany and Austria and unleash communism on the world.
1306933994458697730 2020-09-18 20:32:00 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Does anyone really believe the pioneers went west from the coast "to spread the Constitution?" Old Western movies were more honest than *Shapiros quoted by the Daily Caller. No one even once mentions the Constitution in those movies, when they clear the land for farming.
1306555784101326853 2020-09-17 19:29:08 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Mangan150 By the way, funny how socialists always blame THE CAPITALISTS, but not the other people who work in a business. Apparently the people driving the trucks had a gun to their heads and were forced to take the job? No? Then why don't you ever blame them for the evil sugary product?
1306555070478245893 2020-09-17 19:26:18 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Mangan150 There will always be businesses selling what people want to buy. People all over the world love sugar. You hate that love for sugar so you want to blame it on the businesses. Try to be wiser than that.

You have been reading Marxist kiddies infesting the alt-Right, or worse, listened to podcasts. People don't like sugar because of a CAPITALIST CONSPIRACY. But because of evolution making it tasty.

1306311836795654157 2020-09-17 03:19:46 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Marxism was anti-nationalist and anti-White right from the beginning. Karl Marx' grandson Paul Lafargue, a leading Marxist in France, had Jamaican Indian, Jewish and Black blood. He said "I am proudest of my Negro extraction".

They supported German unification and Scandinavian unification, spoke of an order among the races. Like the FFs naturally assumed race. Too bad they didn't write it as a rule.

Would Britain then have refused to declare war on the Soviets when they invaded Finland and the Baltic states? Everything could have stopped there. But I digress.
1306260828543426561 2020-09-16 23:57:05 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PALE_Primate @DavidColeStein This leads me to something I came to think of during this summer of love. What if the world had the internet and cellphone cameras in the 1920s and 1930s? Communist riots and looting. The commissars' started mass transfer of Balts to Siberia and elsewhere. Red terrorist bombs.
1306258877399396353 2020-09-16 23:49:20 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PALE_Primate @DavidColeStein Hitler planned to retire when Britain stopped its attack. (Then saw USSR amassing invasion army on the border, so that too became an obstacle.) My guess is they'd take Crimea and its excellent naval-base location, Russian oil fields, but mainly Slavic nations would be the same.
1306256566010732544 2020-09-16 23:40:09 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PALE_Primate @DavidColeStein When you don't even have to go to the grocery store, what does Black hostility matter? And if a few - other - Jews get shouted at sometimes, it hardly matters. Besides, it's good cover. See, we're not exempt, and we still support Only Black Lives Matter.
1306255927637692417 2020-09-16 23:37:36 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @PALE_Primate @DavidColeStein Article begs the question how Jews will react to the Die or Die BLM movement. The thugs would attack Jews as well in the Knockout Game that Trayvon liked. But I guess few Jews will ever join David Cole in condemning. And especially not the limousine bosses in Hollywood and media.

Mensa members can't even discuss the reality of IQ at a meeting, since that is Politically Incorrect. You can only talk about safe Discovery Channel stuff.

1306222032993038336 2020-09-16 21:22:55 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Rather than pretend bitcoin is a currency, it would be far better to defend it as an anonymous way of transferring money. As such it does have real value to some people, rather than being bought purely on speculation (hoping another speculant will buy it from you even higher).
1306221045746208769 2020-09-16 21:19:00 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Another bitcoin guy writing "all currencies are just upheld by public trust anyway". They are upheld by being the only legal currency in a country. The currency people need to go to a store and buy something. Almost nothing can be bought by bitcoin.
1306212677937659904 2020-09-16 20:45:45 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @kawashima_ami_ Conveniently leaving out the "independent sources," which would have been the only "evidence" in this thread.

Spooky altars with skulls that some people pray to. Most Whites couldn't believe spirit cooking happened. Talking IRL I couldn't show online pictures, so they just refused to believe it.
1306203669357039620 2020-09-16 20:09:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich That's sad to hear. The alt-Right on Twitter needs more adult voices, rather than kids going for the low-hanging fruit.

1306200456788574210 2020-09-16 19:57:11 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @BradWesley17 @cursedsalad It is anti-Semitic to require Netty to use a key. The White House doors should be opened immediately by the shabbas goyim.

1302686039811686400 2020-09-07 03:12:09 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> One socialist professor invented "multiple intelligences". If the music part of the brain is well developed, that's "music intelligence". So "everyone is good at something," the Left claims.  No. Being good at music is a TALENT. Intelligence is another talent, if you will.  https://t.co/63YehG7mky
1302684982985601026 2020-09-07 03:07:57 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> Socialism, invented by Jhews, is the claim that all individuals and groups are identical, so that any difference in success can only be due to "oppression". This gives an excuse for bribing their voters and footsoldiers, to take control and neutralize conservative White men.  https://t.co/B8r7yGZ1D8

Aside from keeping the U.S. border completely open for Democrat voters. Destroying the US economy forever, but who cares, right?
1302405770152153088 2020-09-06 08:38:27 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @SwipeWright Neocon loyalist Colin Wright suddenly pretending to be pro-White. The neocons he supports all want mass immigration to the U.S. - it's their most important policy, alongside destroying the few Middle Eastern nations who stand up for the Palestinians. Which Colin also supports.
1302405339900514304 2020-09-06 08:36:45 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 7. Neocons and their allies want to destroy the Russian naval base in Crimea, as Russia supports pro-Palestinian Syria, and that can't be allowed. Russia also somewhat supports pro-Palestinian Iran, so Russia must be sanctioned and attacked.  And @Quillette supports the neocons.
1302404947359694849 2020-09-06 08:35:11 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 6. If you cared to look, Crimea is far better off than Ukraine. Most Ukrainians would live in Crimea if they could. But Crimea is Russian, and always has been.
1302404597642940416 2020-09-06 08:33:48 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 5. Russian Crimea wanted to be part of Russia in the 1990s, but ultra-corrupt Washington-backed Yeltsin, with his Harvard advisers running the show, refused.  Now they held a referendum and almost all Crimeans wanted to escape the murderous coupsters in Kiev.
1302404281220378629 2020-09-06 08:32:32 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 4. Eastern "Ukraine" was always Russian. Like Crimea, and South Ossetia, only added to Ukraine by the USSR for administrative purposes. Crimea has been Russian longer than California has been American.  Now the Russian language is banned in Ukraine's schools and administration.
1302403903707852800 2020-09-06 08:31:02 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 3. Washington's paid color-revolution groups overthrew democracy in Ukraine, after the president had promised new elections and withdrew the police from the criminals in the capital, as part of a peace negotiated by Putin.  The coupsters slaughtered peace protesters.
1302403538362957824 2020-09-06 08:29:35 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette 2. Russian-speaking South Ossetia was "Georgian" only on Soviet paper, for administrative purposes. They never wanted to be ruled by the color-revolution coupsters financed by Washington.  Russia saved the Ossetians from a US-loyal Georgian invasion during the Olympics.
1302403153829167105 2020-09-06 08:28:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Quillette Neocon BS.  "after Russian aggression dismembered Georgia and Ukraine, and a bloody foray into the Levant"  1. The US quadrupled the size of Georgia's army, and paid for Mossad to train it. After overthrowing democracy in a color revolution. Then invaded Russian South Ossetia.

1302254675954151424 2020-09-05 22:38:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich Compare this to the permanent ban on Ricky Vaughn, whenever he made a new account. Twitter much prefers the Right Stuff clique who spit at White history because "European colonies only benefitted Private Businesses!" Leftist media have always used this tactic.
1302252427152941060 2020-09-05 22:29:07 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich They will allow someone completely demonized like David Duke to stay on Twitter, just so they can say "Twitter even allows David Duke. Free speech!" They know no one can RT him, after they have completely destroyed his name.
1302251794203136001 2020-09-05 22:26:37 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich People can only understand a total ban. Twitter's tactic goes over their heads. Cutting us down, bluecheck rule, removing the trends we used to get going, temporary bans, shadow bans, means they dominate every trend page. "Look, the people is leftist."
1302250440420196359 2020-09-05 22:21:14 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich "But they allow racists on Twitter" we hear.  For show and to bring in opponents. They banned the best accs one week after the election. Ricky, the most dangerous, was perma banned. They let some come back, but with fewer followers, and ban if they engage blue checks.
1302248216184971264 2020-09-05 22:12:23 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @RacistClip That's not "individualism," which means something completely different. You mean "pride".
1302032992030855168 2020-09-05 07:57:10 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @Partisangirl Slavery wasn't racialized in America either, @partisangirl. There were plenty of White slaves. There were also Black slave owners - some who owned White slaves brought from England. There were slaves sold to the Indian tribes, who held each other and Whites and Blacks as slaves.

It is to do an extraordinary feat that benefits others. What McCain did in uniform, apart from getting caught, was burn down an aircraft carrier by igniting a missile on deck. Hero, right?

They also talk about "protests against racial injustice".

1301964890295414784 2020-09-05 03:26:33 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> @heywildrich About horrible "modern" buildings. Ordinary conservatives and nationalist conservatives are appalled by the same things.

1301950925771362310 2020-09-05 02:31:04 +0800 <UngeheuerDarin> The socialist Guardian "journalists" are of course completely pro Deep State, and attack Julian Assange for exposing the crimes in the illegal war Israel wanted.

Jhew-owned New York Times, being socialist (everyone is equal, any crime is due to Oppression), of course declares this is caused by racism against the innocent Blacks.  https://t.co/5kkrY953f9
