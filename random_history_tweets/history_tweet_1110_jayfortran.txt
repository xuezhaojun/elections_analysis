1329587072441651200 2020-11-20 08:47:15 +0800 <jayfortran> @DiogenesKin @ggreenwald 1. Trump knew it was airborne and didn't tell anyone for months and didn't encourage masks. Absolutely criminal negligence. The whole GOP downplayed it (as Trump admitted was the strategy). 3. Pelosi is garbage. Got rolled by McConnell who only cares about stocks.
1329583474651631616 2020-11-20 08:32:57 +0800 <jayfortran> @DiogenesKin @ggreenwald 1. Bullshit. Numerous GOP leaders (Ted Cruz, Trump) said they thought the virus would disappear after the election (implying it's phony). 2. This number is inflated and COVID is more deadly. 3. I call it GOP mismanagement of the crisis. Lockdowns should've been financed.

1325895692649443329 2020-11-10 04:19:01 +0800 <jayfortran> All protests should use "SIT AND OCCUPY" format. Must eliminate any narrative of violence, given the real possibility of militay deployment/martial law being used against supposed 'violent' protesting.   Without the violence pretext, emergency powers won't be supported.

If people are wearing masks, there are no small droplets to inhale.  You live in a society, sorry to break it to you. Having freedom doesn't mean you won't be inconvenienced.
