The SNP books don't balance without Westminster bailing them out.  I don't want Scotland to leave Britain but if you do it pays to look at what the SNP are saying and what is actually true.

Scotland receives more funding per capita than England does because of the extra funding from Westminster.  SNP want to give your fishing industry back to the EU.  What differences?

Desire for independence is felt in your heart it can't be counted in monetary terms.  I felt that way about getting away from the EU's rules and regulations.  Does that make sense?

Can't help but think this was all a deliberate ploy.  #ChinaLiedPeopleDied  = And it still is.  The US must keep their puppet Biden out of the Oval Office.
1343121852013674496 2020-12-27 17:09:38 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @realDonaldTrump @Sobroski1982 Looks like twitter agrees it was China's fault Donald.  No "disputed" addition to your tweet. üòÇ  I agree too it was &amp; still is Chinese CCP's fault and they should be made to pay.

Nothing!  When Europhile May went to ask for a fair deal from the EU, what was there response?  Nothing!  #BetteroffOut #Brexit
1343115270831923200 2020-12-27 16:43:29 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Well worth a listen. @JamesDelingpole interviews expert Patrick Wood about the Great Reset, Technocracy, Trilateral Commission and the World Economic Forum  Thanks James for this informative video.  All very worrying though
1343112362849685504 2020-12-27 16:31:55 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @BrexitAlex Didn't think I could be shocked anymore by the EU or the BBC but shows I was wrong.  EU wanted all countries to wait before giving vaccine so they could all do it together for a political "touching unity" and the BBC refers to some countries "jumping the gun" to save lives.
1342911509157044224 2020-12-27 03:13:48 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @cablebear Love it.  That would save the EU billions.

I have read several books by abused girls.  Breaks my heart to read them but at least it helps me understand their suffering and gives them money to survive.
1342129983628718081 2020-12-24 23:28:18 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @brunskill_robyn @MrPaulSimpson1 Of course it is your choice.  I hope he thinks about what you are saying though.  Most who wanted Brexit aren't "Little Englanders" - there are a whole host of reasons why we voted to leave the EU.
1342129504567877632 2020-12-24 23:26:24 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @brunskill_robyn @MrPaulSimpson1 So disappointing way that some have behaved regarding vulnerable young girls systematically groomed/raped by migrants  Calling girls prostitutes, hide identity of perps, release them from jail early &amp; do not deport when served short sentences  Protect our girls not the guilty.
1342128942136889345 2020-12-24 23:24:10 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Never!  The EU isn't Europe and if it is a family it is a very dysfunctional one.

Was so disappointed that it was a cop out &amp; didn't expose the vast extent of Muslim grooming gangs in the UK.  Labour mayors, council leaders have all protected these creatures and prevented their exposure to the law.  Sickens me

Discussion is the key and the migrants systematically raping girls in his area doesn't appear to bother him like it does me &amp; you.

1342117447449587715 2020-12-24 22:38:29 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @oflynnsocial Migration had nothing at all to do with my decision to want brexit. It was all about independence and sovereignty to make our own laws etc.    I could see the power creep of the EU affecting our rights &amp; laws  This was back in the 1990s and I have never changed my mind.

Great pickings there from dresses, old mens macs (remember them), indeed anything that looked awful enough to buy, so you could mod it into something great.

1342106513159155712 2020-12-24 21:55:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Little insight into my life.  I have been knitting and watching/listening to ACDC live at the River Plate (on full blast) whilst tweeting.  Surprise?üòÇ
1342105972806967298 2020-12-24 21:52:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Well said Rabbi üëèüëèüëèüëè  Let's move forward and take this wonderful nation of Britain to the next level of prosperity.  Don't look back - look forward!

I get in early and stay late - all unpaid  I have the legal minimum holiday &amp; sick pay with no pension paid from my employer.  You were saying??
1342100744409935872 2020-12-24 21:32:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Just_Jacko Have a great time, supporting your local shops at the same time.  Sod Amazon.

1342095138785538048 2020-12-24 21:09:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TomTierney20 @AngelaRayner Or failing a pay rise, which I think is a difficult call in these circumstances, simply job security.  I don't know if the company I work for will survive this.  Giving anyone in the public sector a pay rise should be BOTTOM of anyone's to do list IMO.
1342093242943352832 2020-12-24 21:02:18 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SocialM85897394 Trout is a river fish isn't it?  Can't see many of them being caught in the North Sea

1342092678754947073 2020-12-24 21:00:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TomTierney20 @AngelaRayner I am not your "love"  Shopworkers on the minimum wage, also work the tills, face to face with 1000's of customers per day.  They have little, or no job security, minimum holiday &amp; legal minimum SSP payments  All UNLIKE the security and benefits workers in the NHS have.
1342091180486615044 2020-12-24 20:54:06 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ParveenAtwal3 Beautiful thread.  Wishing you and your family a Merry Christmas
1342089954613145601 2020-12-24 20:49:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AngelaRayner WHY?  What about minimum wage supermarket workers, delivery drivers. Are they not heroes?  Or is it because they aren't public sector workers. or union members that make them less important in your eyes?  What about the millions who's jobs are at risk in the private sector too?
1342089000622940162 2020-12-24 20:45:27 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Terrythegashead Also reference to the EU's "sovereignty".  The EU is not a nation, it has no sovereignty - YET.  If they get there way though, there will be a lot less sovereign nations in Europe and one will be a nation called the EU.
1342087171109494785 2020-12-24 20:38:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> BBC everytime.  It is SUPPOSED to be impartial, by law.  Time to #DefundTheBBC

1342079347440693248 2020-12-24 20:07:05 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I'd rather not.  Can't think of any "quality journalism" at the Guardian.

1342036056535953409 2020-12-24 17:15:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Iromg Chinese CCP, Macron &amp; Sturgeon would be my top three
1342035784573067265 2020-12-24 17:13:59 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @EuanPhilipps Can't really answer that.  To me it was the 80's  Probably me showing my age and you likewise

1341883418011987972 2020-12-24 07:08:32 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Syria commended Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúactive efforts to increase healthcare.‚Äù Russia hailed ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs cooperation with human rights treaty bodies.‚Äù China praised ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs efforts to protect the rights of vulnerable groups.‚Äù Venezuela cited Iran‚Äôs ‚Äústeadfast commitment to protecting human rights.‚Äù

1341876291046412295 2020-12-24 06:40:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I meant to say I agree with you by the way.  Trying to be too clever there.
1341875536512102403 2020-12-24 06:37:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> If lockdowns don't work! Why keep repeating them? ü§î
1341874603430457345 2020-12-24 06:33:30 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I wonder.  Let's hope the EU has caved in.

1341843853477863424 2020-12-24 04:31:19 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit Forgot to add.  The EEC was much touted as being created with an aim of stopping Germany attempting a third time to expand its influence and rule over Europe.  Look how that worked out.
1341843112537305088 2020-12-24 04:28:22 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit Perhaps.
1341842992613699585 2020-12-24 04:27:54 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ghost_wales @Peston During the Labour caused financial crash in 2008 Peston made sense.  Now he doesn't and should retire.
1341841948584361986 2020-12-24 04:23:45 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit But France is no 2.  In my eyes anyway.
1341836077670281216 2020-12-24 04:00:25 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @MrMasonMills The EU in democratic terms,  Germany and France take, the other 25 nations give.  Thank heavens we are out of this cabal.
1341756180671160326 2020-12-23 22:42:56 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Murray: "I think that's too high a price to pay.

1341554663150276609 2020-12-23 09:22:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ghost_wales Not "Scotland has no shame" - Sturgeon &amp; the SNP have no shame.  Scotland can't get rid until an election, even if they wanted to.

1340820334396796929 2020-12-21 08:44:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Welcome to a leave area.  Where people are sensible and voted for Brexit.
1340819685969936385 2020-12-21 08:41:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @paulderby11 Of course, it was an old tweet of Paul's.  Just thought it needed another airing LOL.  Codswallop needs reminding.
1340818839270019072 2020-12-21 08:38:17 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TeesValleyVoice What a lovely idea.  Thanks for sharing that.

1340815570166542336 2020-12-21 08:25:17 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Ash_Hirani @FoxxysTweets I only had pleasure of listening to the discussions on various stations during my LONG commute to work.  Scumball politicians who don't care about their voters nor democracy.  Only care about access to their holiday homes in France.  &amp; the Maybot ?- well enough said about her.
1340813723510829056 2020-12-21 08:17:57 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Ash_Hirani @FoxxysTweets They didn't crush us Brexiteers, although for a long while I though they would overturn our vote.  Time to drain the swamp in the media, civil service and parliament.  Democracy should be king.
1340812134326931456 2020-12-21 08:11:38 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Lovely photos.
1340811756638187531 2020-12-21 08:10:08 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> When I voted in the referendum I expected no deal  I knew the devious EU would never negotiate fairly.  One of the very many reasons I voted out.

I have never forgotten how awful Brown was as a chancellor and then as a PM.  But of course he "saved the world".
1340764142853099522 2020-12-21 05:00:56 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @EarlyOakR Yeah selling the UK's gold reserves at an all time low price was very insightful.  Not as if we needed those ¬£millions when the crash came eh?

1340760403840819202 2020-12-21 04:46:05 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Of course MPs have their own agenda.  Who honestly thinks they don't?

1340736120594837505 2020-12-21 03:09:35 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> We have a serious PM.  Serious about getting Brexit done.
1340704502429704193 2020-12-21 01:03:57 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Exactly right.
1340695097759981589 2020-12-21 00:26:34 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @NormanBrennan I heard it was the Association of Insomniacs.    Peston would do a roaring trade curing their problems.

1340437684100194307 2020-12-20 07:23:42 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I do too.  Also wonder if the masks are hand made for Nippie and the bill goes to the Scottish Parliament to pay.
1340435710084608003 2020-12-20 07:15:52 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @john_bromfield China had the massive total of 17 infections today, according to Worldometer.  Funny the MSM doesn't question Chinese CCP actions any more and hasn't done since the very early stages.
1340434425541234688 2020-12-20 07:10:45 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @RabbiZvi Never Corbyn.
1340432036021067777 2020-12-20 07:01:16 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> "Since the beginning of December, the R rate has risen from just below 1 - meaning infection rates are largely under control - to upwards of 1.2, meaning an infected person on average will pass the disease on to 12 others."  NO!  R=1.2 means 1 person passes it to 1.2 people.
1340229596285964288 2020-12-19 17:36:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @richardcalhoun Not wrong in society, with the Establishment: Government, opposition etc.

1340058751265615874 2020-12-19 06:17:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TweetyBeds Agreed.  No chance. Death "with covid" reported not of covid.  Coupled with GPs not visiting patients and just putting covid on death certificate regardless if patient had it.
1339964074080296962 2020-12-19 00:01:45 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @JazzHandJones I see Corbyn but who's the horror on the right? üòÇ

1339312351850467330 2020-12-17 04:52:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Especially heartily sick of sanctimonious ‚Äòesteemed‚Äô people who believe they have the right to question others, from the BBC.

1339283003592364041 2020-12-17 02:55:25 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Labour's position will probably continue on the opposition benches because they can't accept that the referendum result was pro Brexit.

1338559526027538434 2020-12-15 03:00:34 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Welcome to the naughty step London
1338548726168772608 2020-12-15 02:17:40 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @petersmill @allisonpearson Tonight the media iis all about London and how bad it is going into Tier 3.  So we didn't matter then?  Our hospitality businesses didn't matter.
1338294567779659776 2020-12-14 09:27:43 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson We say the same although I think it is mainly to do with sleep.  I am a late night person but I need to go.  Forgot it was Monday tomorrow, up at 6 and off to work at 7am.  Speak soon Didier üíï
1338293628213583875 2020-12-14 09:23:59 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @RichRevol @SocialM85897394 I see he has to get his support of Palestine and hatred of Israel in straight away  We support movements for democracy and people‚Äôs right to self-determination across the world including in Palestine and the Middle East, Sri Lanka, Kashmir, and Latin America.
1338293348172443648 2020-12-14 09:22:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson That probably is the best way to go, quick or in your sleep.  I am glad he was a lovely happy clever wine maker
1338293034698600448 2020-12-14 09:21:38 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Wish he could be here now to see Brexit but as he was over 90 when he died I would be worried about him.  He was a pragmatist, not worried about dying at all.  Left me to worry about him at the time.
1338291575286272001 2020-12-14 09:15:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Sad about your dad Didier, mine died 2 years ago.  If he was alive he would be very excited about Brexit for it was he that got me interested in independence back in the 1990s
1338290539322544129 2020-12-14 09:11:43 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Nice house by the way, but I think the electric bill would be rather high.üòÇ  Can you see it from space?
1338290349064790023 2020-12-14 09:10:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson I think he did too.
1338289952795357184 2020-12-14 09:09:23 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Not even sure he won the argument- except in his own head.  No one trusted him, no one believed him, no one wanted him.  Oh except for his racist crank following of course

Join us and see what can be accomplished when you get an impassioned team to focus on change. Our success winning the 2019 general election argument is proof of that!"  Of course he won  üòÇüòÇ
1338288906123534338 2020-12-14 09:05:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn Read the about us page.  Made me giggle
1338288509975748608 2020-12-14 09:03:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ViveBrexit @jeremycorbyn It is a spoof Didier.  Someone beat him to the name.

1338280684306255872 2020-12-14 08:32:33 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @GwynCarwardine @allisonpearson I have written to my MP but of course had no reply.  Cases of covid caught in hospitality settings are so low, you have to wonder whos  agenda is in shutting them down.  JVT is one of my favourites to be pushing for closure
1338279579627171848 2020-12-14 08:28:10 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @MissDomergue @DeanIvy3 Interesting as White British is now an ethnic minority with only 44% of London's population.
1338277953218732040 2020-12-14 08:21:42 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @danwootton Dan, remember the rest of us who were thrown into lockdown when London caught it bad.  Millions in towns/cities are already stuck in Tier 3 now already.  It should not be all about London all the time.  Sincerely  Jane

1338274991167725577 2020-12-14 08:09:56 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @GiftCee I can't help thinking this is all part of the plan to get Harris as President.
1338256182000103431 2020-12-14 06:55:12 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> We went from Tier 1 before lockdown to Tier 3 after lockdown.  So much for lockdown. #sigh

1338236148603383817 2020-12-14 05:35:35 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @bedford_colleen Living in the country in a small village, most of the people I know are odd in that case.ü§£

1338234316573331462 2020-12-14 05:28:18 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @bedford_colleen Heartbreaking isn't it.  I had to hire a man with a van for 2 journeys last time.  Worse though still having to leave my 10 yr old magnolia stellata as it was in the ground.
1338231415431946246 2020-12-14 05:16:47 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @bedford_colleen @sakkoira Sorry missed your tweet.  I am no Percy Thrower either.    My main problem is whenever I move house I start from scratch - then leave my beautiful plants for the new owner to rip out- does get me cross.   This will not happen again üòâ
1338229879582711810 2020-12-14 05:10:41 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Don't forget Bercow, May &amp; Robbins.  They were key players in the matter

1338227620341813250 2020-12-14 05:01:42 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @bedford_colleen @sakkoira Ah so you are one of those gardening racists.  So am I, pleased to meet you Colleen
1338226411560198153 2020-12-14 04:56:54 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @wessas68 @allisonpearson Tier 1 (with the new extension of hours) is the only possible way to let our hospitality survive.  Tier 2 and Tier 3, they just haemorrhage money.  The government, including devolved ones, appear to be happy to kill our hospitality and let the millions of jobs go
1338225618912235523 2020-12-14 04:53:45 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Garfielduk @allisonpearson That is a question I cannot answer.
1338222827992977411 2020-12-14 04:42:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Yes.
1338222690776309762 2020-12-14 04:42:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @allisonpearson @Telegraph Even when our cases go down we are still stuck in tier 3.  Hospitality and life in towns/cities cannot survive without tier 1.
1338222291038195717 2020-12-14 04:40:31 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Garfielduk @allisonpearson I hate to say it but I think it is a worldwide choice being made by governments.  Not just England, Scotland, Wales.  Question is why?
1338218955555659779 2020-12-14 04:27:16 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @allisonpearson Alison, please remember all those towns and cities that were locked down in March even though they had few cases because London had it bad  You are lucky in tier 2 and we are locked down yet again in tier 3  Our pubs and hospitality will not recover and our towns/cities are dead
1338215829075353601 2020-12-14 04:14:51 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @deGourlay @CarolPP9 Just remember if a Frenchman broke into Bryant's house, he wouldn't want the police called out against a NATO ally robber.
1338201908473958401 2020-12-14 03:19:32 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @DamCou Looks like one of those nutty professors from the BBC 2 Open University History courses from the 70s  Wonder why he had to change the name of his organisation from Peace &amp; Justice Initiative Ltd?  https://t.co/pLTHCYQvYr

1338182029742059528 2020-12-14 02:00:32 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @plittmoden @ActionBrexit Very poorly photoshopped image.  That being said yes the sentiments on the sign are still correct.

1338153496705699841 2020-12-14 00:07:09 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Thank you Ambassador  I hope this will still be the case after January
1338150999941390337 2020-12-13 23:57:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @piersmorgan Resign, Morgan, you never want anyone else to have a second chance!

1338143791069474819 2020-12-13 23:28:35 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Agreed,   Also why does he look like he is wearing ladies knickers on his face?
1338142800362287106 2020-12-13 23:24:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Absolutely shocking  Call the police. üòÇ

1338114708465999876 2020-12-13 21:33:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Never_Again2020 Of course the same could be said for the current leader of Labour  Both supported and campaigned for an antisemite, despite knowing exactly what he was at the time.  I call it hypocrisy
1338114342416502784 2020-12-13 21:31:34 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @PaulMIL87122911 The EU is run and regulated for those two countries alone.  The others are just along to provide a tame easy market for them.  Regulations and tariffs are set to aid them  Employment laws are set to suit them  Etc, etc

1338108706014289920 2020-12-13 21:09:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Lest we forget....where we would have been if we had had a Corbyn government inflicted on our beautiful isle.

1338096405513121797 2020-12-13 20:20:18 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ThomasEvans1984 Not forgetting they have told the EU and their own fishermen that they won't be patrolling Scottish waters so it will be an EU free for all come January 1st.
1338085934366142465 2020-12-13 19:38:41 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @stillgray As a matter of fact I follow many accounts, where I disagree with pretty much everything they say.  It helps to see both sides of any argument.
1338085480349446147 2020-12-13 19:36:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Don't worry the UN will sort it out....oh!
1338081971956813829 2020-12-13 19:22:57 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Borisjohnson agree to no safeguards re so called "unfair competition".  We should be able to make our own laws/rules, regardless of what the EU think.  This is not a change from their demands before.  It is simply different wording.
1338079810686488577 2020-12-13 19:14:21 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @john_bromfield Labour with its open door policy, nanny state etc.  I agree that is what ruined our country.  Let's try and get it back.  Nothing wrong with immigration as long as those who come here are prepared to work with us, not against us.

1338075634468261888 2020-12-13 18:57:46 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @PymPurnell Labour have totally lost the plot.  So woke they now don't think about their original core supporters at all.  Woke is anti everything that made our country great.  They want to destroy our heritage, our history and our lives.
1338072553101864961 2020-12-13 18:45:31 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @PymPurnell White heterosexual and working class, Labour doesn't care about you.  Non binary, BAME etc, Labour loves you.  White heterosexual and voted for Brexit. - Labour calls you racist  Not a lot to like about Labour these days.
1338070737068941312 2020-12-13 18:38:18 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @rcolvile There is nothing positive to say about about Hezza so that makes us square.  Time for him to shut up, along with Adonis, Major, Blair etc
1338070432268890112 2020-12-13 18:37:05 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> The UN needs disbanding.  It is not fit for purpose and does much more harm than good

1337921991479881728 2020-12-13 08:47:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @rasg Nearly as good as the original Brexit vote result for me.  We certainly dodged a bullet 12 months ago.
1337921341736030208 2020-12-13 08:44:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @profsked It won't work.    Boris knows if he tries to re implement restrictions no one will adhere to them anyway over Christmas.  We have all had enough.

Now they moan and scream because we are almost certainly leaving on WTO terms.  They should realise they bear a lot of the blame for this.

We were given 1/2 an orange at half time in school netball matches.  Of course my parents bought them too.  Perhaps this numpty thinks the EU invented oranges

1335709369481228290 2020-12-07 06:15:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @BethRigby Actually a no-deal Brexit was all I was expecting unless the EU caves at 11.59 &amp; 59 seconds.  I knew the EU wouldn't give us a fair deal willingly unless it was on their terms and didn't include the UK gaining all the rights and property we lost when we were ensnared by them

1335683401609842693 2020-12-07 04:31:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @DrSpock_MGBGA When @johnredwood says "no deal is better than a bad deal" we believe him.  When Theresa May said it, we knew she was lying.
1335663719129509893 2020-12-07 03:13:40 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @wemustleave1 Time to be proud to be British  Proud of our British history and heritage, no matter how long we have been living here.  Time to stand together and be thankful that we live in such a wonderful country as we do.

1335607135368065027 2020-12-06 23:28:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @mikeman1313 It is only a matter of time before other countries eg Italy leave.  I wouldn't be surprised if the French want out too.  We will show them that our lives and economy will thrive without the EUs ridiculous regulations and rules .  Only a matter of time before EU implodes.
1335605775742496769 2020-12-06 23:23:25 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> No surprise.

You were lied to by Heath etc.  I was too young to vote but I probably would have voted the same. By tend of the 80s I knew different though.  Great that we are finally getting shot of this millstone round our neck.
1335598311349366784 2020-12-06 22:53:46 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Sky News: Sky "news" services say it has "no plans" to add a fictional disclaimer to episodes of its "news" broadcasts.  Despite the fact that there really should be one.

We want this vital industry to recover back to the days pre EU and grow.  More than time to bring back life to our once thriving fishing ports.

1335569691050438657 2020-12-06 21:00:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Shame on you, you have decimated an entire sector of of our small businesses despite them spending ¬£hundreds of millions to make them "covid secure".     We in tier 3 can't help them out.  Pubs/bars/Restaurants  Their demise will be on your head.
1335561600028336128 2020-12-06 20:27:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @MikeGal041 @EssexPR Even though he allowed the hospitality industry to spend over ¬£450 million mitigating it?  Pubs are a minor source of infection as everyone knows.  You can push past someone in a shop, touch hundreds of things but shops allowed to open 24/7.  One rule for shops, another for pubs
1335552815255728129 2020-12-06 19:52:59 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Crosscolin88 @janekin24 @Yalini_Salvini @afneil Instead they ridiculed the Republicans right from the off.  A lot of red faces soon, probably the same red faces that called the Brexit result wrong and refused to admit it  Funny that.

1335542029087088640 2020-12-06 19:10:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @BobDowns14 That I cannot answer.   I am by nature a law abiding citizen but I admit that the current restrictions do not make sense.  If I owned or ran a pub I would probably do more about it including possibly opening despite the laws.  I have already written to my MP (who voted for this)
1335541456887554050 2020-12-06 19:07:51 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @MarkVipond @HonestCitizen62 All the while claiming to be "prudent".  The least popular PM in history in my book

1335539038766436357 2020-12-06 18:58:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @BobDowns14 Sorry I disagree Bob.  We are the silent (apart from here) majority but we are law abiding too.  We are abiding by these ridiculous laws although heaven knows why.
1335538371574308864 2020-12-06 18:55:35 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @EssexPR I think the culprit for closing pubs was JVT.  His "recipes for transmission"  3Cs and a DV Closed spaces, crowds, close contact. Duration. Volume.  He has taken no account whatsoever of the mitigating measures publicans such as yourself have taken.  This is a complete farce
1335536166708391936 2020-12-06 18:46:49 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SimonClarkeMP BLM are an antisemitic racist marxist organisation who wants to defund the police etc.  If you are not an antisemitic racist marxist who wants to defund the police etc, then no need to support them.  In fact the sensible option is to oppose them.

1335498946437914624 2020-12-06 16:18:55 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Article1066 Sergio Montanaro revealed that he plans to take Rome out of the bloc in "less than two years".  He said: "The Italian people, just like the British, want to get out of this cage."
1335497551009689600 2020-12-06 16:13:23 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> We need to "win" on everything.  Nothing less is a failure for the UK.  If the EU don't agree then WTO.

We eat cod and haddock by the bucketload. It should be caught by our fishermen in our waters.  Add to jobs, UK GDP and wealth for our northern coastal towns/cities.
1335490629556711424 2020-12-06 15:45:52 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> They are still trying to keep us tied to their strings.  They can't handle that we are (hopefully) now a democratic independent state.  WTO all the way, as no deal is far better than a bad deal eh @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost ?

1335291260379205637 2020-12-06 02:33:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Wildisonmine And of course twitter does the honours.  I have reported dozens of accounts for antisematism - I very rarely even get a reply from twitter.  Let alone them actually doing anything about it.
1335289920290779138 2020-12-06 02:28:20 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Wildisonmine Pretty much. I had to delete two tweets before I was allowed back. Neither were offensive and both were over 6 months old.

1334632124687798272 2020-12-04 06:54:29 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> "But remember folks, you have to be an SNP, remainer lefty or we ain't picking you!"  BBC tries to increase  it's awful viewing figures.

1334610981918547969 2020-12-04 05:30:28 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> So police are supposedly "overwhelmed" and can't deal with burglaries and other crimes.  Funny that they find time for this harassment then, isn't it?
1334607799620407299 2020-12-04 05:17:49 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Two tier policing and now also two tier "justice".

1334599499227025411 2020-12-04 04:44:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Israel is not authoritarian nor anti democratic, however the Chinese CCP and Iranian government both are.  UN is not fit for purpose.

Where is the impact assessment of these draconian measures taken against this sector?  There is none, these restrictions look personal. Why nail bars open and pubs/restaurants closed?

It was supposed to be in briefing paper but there is no explanation why hospitality is being punished above all other sectors of economy  It begins to look personal.

It is like a leaky ship lurching from crisis to crisis.  All very well in the good times but when a real big wave happens - crash!
1332976863749271552 2020-11-29 17:17:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> And a long month it will be.  I never had the chance to vote us into the Common Market but I probably would have done at the time as we were lied to  I have wanted out for decades, following many discussions with my father who joined UKIP in 1993.

1332827126626734082 2020-11-29 07:22:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> That's it.  Better tell the kids, Father Christmas is banned from delivering present this year.

Bad enough this ridiculous idea of electric cars only in 10 years.  How are people supposed to afford these cars and where will the millions be able to charge them.  Methinks I am a tad annoyed with the government at present
1332824047349084161 2020-11-29 07:09:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @RegBurbage @TykeTalking @Article1066 Great, I have over 60 miles commute each day.  Won't be worth me going to work in this case.  Alright if you live in London with buses, tube etc of course  eh @RishiSunak ?  We don't all have great public transport.
1332822437260615681 2020-11-29 07:03:26 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @ghost_wales @DeanIvy3 Perhaps it is time for Londonistan to have its own devolved government and the rest of England can gain independence  London can keep the HOC &amp; the HOL of course.  We will do a far better job without either of them.
1332818625246408704 2020-11-29 06:48:17 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TykeTalking It has, since the end of January.  The worrying thing is I think we will need to get to at least June 2021 before things get back to some semblance of normality.  It has been too long already #sighs
1332817661194080258 2020-11-29 06:44:27 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TykeTalking Don't worry.  I do it all the time.  I too am waiting for Dec 31st - IF we don't give away the family silver to the EU of course.
1332816896861872128 2020-11-29 06:41:25 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TykeTalking January 31st 2020 - we left the EU.

1332717805876162562 2020-11-29 00:07:40 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @rsw16 @robittybobnob I am one of them. My taxes have paid for the NHS, Councils, Civil Servants etc.  I was furloughed at 80% of my salary which is lower than if I worked in the public sector.  They were furloughed on full pay.  There have been redundancies already where I work, need I say more?
1332713850077065217 2020-11-28 23:51:57 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Roberthill6868 @MaajidNawaz At least your bio is accurate.
1332712589432909824 2020-11-28 23:46:56 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @robittybobnob Agreed.  Business owners and those who work (or did) in the private sector are every bit as important as those in the public sector.  If not more IMO

1332709582809034754 2020-11-28 23:34:59 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Worse the BLM marchers were destructive and violent towards the police &amp; these anti-lockdown protesters are not.  There is an agenda.

1332696552293462017 2020-11-28 22:43:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Of course that goes for Sturgeon etc too.  All more interested in locking us down rather than letting our economies thrive.  How many so called "excess" deaths are they going to be happy with?  Too many that is for sure.
1332696188160778247 2020-11-28 22:41:46 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AbsenceMalice I would never describe my area as "God's country" although I do live in a small village.
1332695943918071810 2020-11-28 22:40:47 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AbsenceMalice I understand that but I never realised how bad the media was until Brexit, particularly the BBC &amp; Sky. Don't expect unbiased opinions from print media.  What worries me is that Sage seems to be ruling @BorisJohnson an I don't know why  BTW I support Wolves - always have &amp; will
1332691747130970112 2020-11-28 22:24:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @actiontiff I don't know John, this whole tier system is a Pantomime.   Only problem is no one is laughing.

1332684366078767108 2020-11-28 21:54:47 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Hancock, why are you decimating our hospitality, and other industries also damaging the health and lives of our people.  All because of a virus that only kills 0.3% of the population and protect the NHS which is supposed to protect us.  What is your agenda?
1332680188698763267 2020-11-28 21:38:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AbsenceMalice Always used to trust the media until Brexit.  Now if they say it is sunny I pack an umbrella.  Would love to live in Cornwall but stuck in the Midlands, hours from the sea.  Coming to the conclusion this is all at the behest of China's CCP (even US election)
1332673377417441282 2020-11-28 21:11:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AbsenceMalice Call me a conspiracy theorist too then.  Unfortunately I agree with pretty much everything you have said.
1332667422583779328 2020-11-28 20:47:27 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> More protected than supported IMO but yes, vast majority of Asian grooming gangs found in Labour held areas.
1332665224156098560 2020-11-28 20:38:43 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @AbsenceMalice I'm with Emma &amp; the Great Barrington Declaration.    Of course you're also right. Those in power &amp; their so called scientists will never let this happen.  If the ONLY purpose of the lockdown/tiers was to tank our economy and destroy lives - then it is a huge success.

I bought the FR David version whilst on holiday in France, then it became a hit in the UK a month later.  Listened to both and still prefer his version.

The restaurant/pub won't have time for a second sitting so why not let diners linger?  I think you are right regarding the infection figures B TW
1332438851843977221 2020-11-28 05:39:12 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @BBCNewsnight @lewis_goodall Just realised I was following you.  Sorted now. ü§û
1332438520221331457 2020-11-28 05:37:53 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @uk_sf_writer @mikewhorley I don't go to the pub at all (husband does) but I am concerned about some of my friends who work in them.   Two have already been made redundant.
1332436639197564928 2020-11-28 05:30:24 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @uk_sf_writer Me too.  Going to be a long winter/spring.
1332436375161991172 2020-11-28 05:29:21 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @mikewhorley @uk_sf_writer Sure I read that 2% of cases were from pubs, so hardly more than anywhere else.  Also if you are having a meal, seated at a table then you are not randomly mixing with others so won't spread it to them.
1332435610653569028 2020-11-28 05:26:19 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @uk_sf_writer Just seems odd.  Since his virus he looks like he is singling pubs out for special measures.  This latest "eat up and sod off" measure makes no sense - there isn't time for 2 sittings so he wants us to rush out of the pub/restaurant for no reason.
1332432262978293761 2020-11-28 05:13:01 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @uk_sf_writer Sounds like a plan.  Is Boris tee total now?  He certainly is picking on pubs.
1332432064600305667 2020-11-28 05:12:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @paulderby11 Agreed Paul,  why have so called "free" elections and then ignore serious concerns from one side.  The media, google, facebook, twitter have questions to answer.
1332107109291405318 2020-11-27 07:40:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Ahh poor mite.  #getsviolinout  My pay will be frozen too and even so I think I am lucky to have a job, as there have been several redundancies where I work - in the private sector.
1332100789448433666 2020-11-27 07:15:52 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @bbcquestiontime @vaughangething Yes.   Public Sector get more pay , job security and better pensions.  Private sector workers are  paid less,being made redundant by the million and WE pay for the public sector jobs.

1330642147826135048 2020-11-23 06:39:44 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SamCoatesSky And no mention of Scotland's woes at all.

1329138759737159680 2020-11-19 03:05:49 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @LBilderberg It doesn't help that the EU has fixed food commodity prices and inflicts high import duties on food from elsewhere.  All to help the French farmers I think
1329128584145940481 2020-11-19 02:25:23 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SallyKowal Ebay needs to get its act together. I generally buy from Amazon or facebook these days.  I used to sell on ebay but the fees are too high particularly for low value items.  I don't trust any business sellers on ebay these days unless I have their business name and address details
1329125379815206912 2020-11-19 02:12:39 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Are you listening @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier ?  Just let us have our sovereignty including own laws, rules, borders and fisheries and we can all be friends and trade nicely again.  What a great idea!
1329124749885128705 2020-11-19 02:10:08 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SallyKowal My husband ordered something from someone in "Leeds".  Turns out they are in China so the expected 4 day delivery is now 3 weeks.  I have tackled Ebay about this some years ago and they won't budge on their rules.
1329120780567842819 2020-11-19 01:54:22 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SallyKowal @eBay_UK I find ebay most annoying as for some reason China is part of many UK only searches.  I always try to buy from my country and indeed try and avoid Chinese sellers at present.

1328469199816175619 2020-11-17 06:45:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> When I see people from the US mocking the British because our media is as liberal lefty as the US one I just remember that not all of us are incapable of seeing beyond the bias of the media.  I support Trump as do millions in the UK.  Please refrain from abusing us.

1328407621473357825 2020-11-17 02:40:32 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Any comment @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier ?  Do you agree with the EU subsidizing terrorism?

Of course Wales, NI, Scotland all have the same problem if they want to leave us. They use the British ¬£.   I don't believe Wales or Northern Ireland want to thankfully

1327719740727570437 2020-11-15 05:07:08 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @wemustleave1 Scotland will never survive financially without England's taxpayers bailing them out on a yearly basis but of course the EU don't care about that.  All they care about is stopping us succeeding alone and showing other European countries there is life outside the undemocratic EU
1327715727965622273 2020-11-15 04:51:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @wemustleave1 Anything to stop the UK having a successful future after Brexit.
1327702300501172230 2020-11-15 03:57:50 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Labour in the UK too.

1327682056718004224 2020-11-15 02:37:24 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @maryyjaneexx @Wicksylax Surely the fact that Labour thinks that postal voting is the way to win indicates that there was fraud in the recent US elections.

1327607055205740547 2020-11-14 21:39:22 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> FGS get a grip Boris!  We are in a time of national crisis!  Stop the EU plundering our fishing waters Stop the economic migrants invading our country Stop locking down the country at the drop of a hat  Stand UP for millions who lent there vote to you NOT the rest of the world
1327604794794647552 2020-11-14 21:30:23 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I would think this threat shows that the EU are not negotiating fairly.  That will make the UK's NI amendment lawful then, will it?
1327594701701124097 2020-11-14 20:50:17 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> "Far-right" anyone to the right of Corbyn?

1327403616517431296 2020-11-14 08:10:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @amor_wilkes @MahyarTousi Great, thanks for letting me know.   Didn't think Mahyar would do that but was surprised by the tweet.  Apologies
1327369919244226560 2020-11-14 05:57:04 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> If they do this then they are finished.  They may have an 80 seat majority but they will be a dead man walking.
1327358774412242949 2020-11-14 05:12:47 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @supergutman Loved Birdhouse in your soul, still do.  None of my friends that liked it though.
1327340012397006848 2020-11-14 03:58:14 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @MahyarTousi How much did they pay you Mahyar?
1327312045998567426 2020-11-14 02:07:06 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Devastated, if Boris gives in to the EU that will be the end of Boris for me.  https://t.co/zAJpKIFAYw
1327308422820343808 2020-11-14 01:52:42 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @PrimalPolitical Oh, I hope not.  If Boris caves in to the EU that is it for me.
1327184766735708161 2020-11-13 17:41:20 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> How about this one?  Allowing police to release body cam video footage when anyone including MPs make allegations against them?
1327176179326078976 2020-11-13 17:07:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Dear @BBCRadio4 just had the doubtful pleasure of hearing @bbclaurak being interviewed about No10.  Is it impartial journalism that she referred to Dominic Cummings being able to hold an argument in an empty closet?  No!  Time to #DefundTheBBC
1327013181873655810 2020-11-13 06:19:31 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Presumably you haven't read Jonathon Powell's book about his time working for Blair.  I have.  This is a storm in a teacup - that was a nuclear explosion.  I suggest you read it and inform yourself.
1326976578606272514 2020-11-13 03:54:05 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> So called impartial BBC.  Shares unconfirmed rumours about the Tories but ignores any evidence of fraud by the left in the US elections. Indeed constantly states there is no evidence.
1326964694884765701 2020-11-13 03:06:51 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @JonathanSGlass Yep Ian, you are an antisemite
1326662720519884800 2020-11-12 07:06:55 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Suicides up 200% since lockdown. And it was the UK's biggest killer of men under 45 even before Covid   Could 2 friends please copy and re-post this tweet? Trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening  Call 116 123 (Samaritans UK)
1326612517519495169 2020-11-12 03:47:26 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> What a shame ü§£
1326597403659661312 2020-11-12 02:47:22 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Do you think the BBC is impartial Alastair?  To be honest I don't
1326419777850646528 2020-11-11 15:01:33 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I don't want to work from home but I don't want the destructive waste of ¬£billions that is #HS2 either.  It will decimate the area around my home for no benefit.
1326283873458802689 2020-11-11 06:01:31 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @EuanPhilipps @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @EHRC @Keir_Starmer She should therefore be suspended @Keir_Starmer
1325940740896280577 2020-11-10 07:18:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Ah, something......boring, and undemocratic.  Finished your sentence off Laura.
1325939969840517121 2020-11-10 07:14:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @cjsnowdon @ghost_wales It already has, Radio 4 has regularly cut Boris Johnson's Covid updates short.
1325937972408152069 2020-11-10 07:07:02 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> #DefundTheBBC   Time to save our hard earned money and get rid of this liberal lefty institution NOW!
1325933693203075072 2020-11-10 06:50:01 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> I wish we could   #DefundtheBBC
1325930838148648960 2020-11-10 06:38:41 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @PippaP22 Not quite extending the olive branch, more like whacking Trump supporters over the head with it.  Total lack of awareness and NO respect for the opposing viewpoint
1325928555063152646 2020-11-10 06:29:36 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Hypocrisy much eh Ian?
1325916647245406209 2020-11-10 05:42:17 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @0_politics2 @ghost_wales Bernie Sanders would more likely become VP than Clinton.
1325886362399223809 2020-11-10 03:41:57 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @StandWithUs @AdamMilstein This must not be allowed to happen again üíîüíî
1325883806268743680 2020-11-10 03:31:47 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Great Article, well worth a read IMO
1325212618248818689 2020-11-08 07:04:44 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Well worth a read.
1325211641819049985 2020-11-08 07:00:51 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Time to #DefundTheBBC  it is not adhering to its own rules of impartiality and hasn't done for years.
1325118622793162760 2020-11-08 00:51:13 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @HonestCitizen62 So if Trump's allegations are true what does that make the Labour party?
1325086093293785088 2020-11-07 22:41:58 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @EarlyOakR @Facts4euOrg Don't believe a YouGov poll.  It is not a random sample of opinion.  You join YouGov and take part in the poll.
1324983468200235009 2020-11-07 15:54:10 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Don't recall you saying the same thing about the democratic Brexit vote though eh?
1324979619544641538 2020-11-07 15:38:52 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @TheHirstComment Also it doesn't look like the new DG has had any impact at all.  #DefundtheBBC  is long overdue now.
1324426634808725507 2020-11-06 03:01:31 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Glad you added that last bit Maurice,  There are many, many poor politicians in the HOC &amp; HOL.  Nothing to do with their monetary wealth of course.
1323772477290516481 2020-11-04 07:42:07 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @SebGorka @KayBurley It is just a shame that Burley will be back on her show herself.  Time to put her out to grass.
1323749845136482311 2020-11-04 06:12:11 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> @Aldeanuk That big?
1323733436960485376 2020-11-04 05:06:59 +0800 <JaneSimkins66> Dear BBC "News" please refrain from spreading fake news as you usually do.  I know this habit is hard to kick for you, but at least TRY!  #DefundTheBBC
