1306633444261351424 2020-09-18 00:37:43 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @HomaBashWEWS I'd feel better if American company took it over
1306633000701001728 2020-09-18 00:35:58 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @TNSociallyMissy NO❗❗❗❗❗❗
1305885114128367617 2020-09-15 23:04:08 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Again you're believing in the false narrative.  For the moment we are still a free country,  everyone has the same opportunity,  you live with the choices you make for yourself.
1305640518391603200 2020-09-15 06:52:11 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage I never said they started it, they are making it worse and encouraging it. Everything the opposite of MLK. Dems made it worse in the 60s with the Great Society,  and pushing it hard every 4 years.
1305639592641650690 2020-09-15 06:48:31 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @ABCPolitics WTG Mary Bruce you just bold faced lied saying Trump lied. NO HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE PANIC❗❗❗❗❗Too bad MSM doesn't feel the same
1305270758671777795 2020-09-14 06:22:54 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Every 4 years there is an election,  the left brings it up.
1305270063835107328 2020-09-14 06:20:08 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @bakermayfield Too late on the kneeling dicission , damage done. You had me so close to going back to watching and rooting for the Browns.  https://t.co/ntlNImSfVE
1305190342271131649 2020-09-14 01:03:21 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage I think BLM is a markist organization and is doing way more damage to black people than helping. BLM and ANTIFA,  hate America are set on destroying it. What a better way than start a race war
1305189247050227713 2020-09-14 00:59:00 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @HomaBashWEWS He lost fans, including me
1304916666309136385 2020-09-13 06:55:52 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage You believe everything you read?

1304636067912577024 2020-09-12 12:20:52 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @FibroSloth I'm so sorry  https://t.co/P2BNzSldbo
1304635347029102592 2020-09-12 12:18:00 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage The movement is the organization.
1304072091457720320 2020-09-10 22:59:49 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Anyone
1304071946024423426 2020-09-10 22:59:15 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage It needs to be separated somehow. This organization is a domestic terrorist organization and these stupid children don't even know what they are fighting for
1303751766442414080 2020-09-10 01:46:58 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @IngrahamAngle How is this NOT election interference?
1303750874603360256 2020-09-10 01:43:25 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage I never accused you of calling me a racist. I asked you to please check the organization out so you would know I'm not lying to you
1303727996084400132 2020-09-10 00:12:31 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> She nails it.   https://t.co/vGRi1tz1h5
1303557514005540864 2020-09-09 12:55:04 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Iv noticed a lot of things are irrelevant to you. Isnt judging white people to assume they are racist the definition of racism???? Just do me a favor, research and find that Im not lying about the organization .
1303479587662372866 2020-09-09 07:45:25 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage On their website. Please tell me how violence,  burning down businesses some being black owned, accomplishes this??? You cant say black lives matter and say black on black crime is irrelevant to what you are saying they are for. That makes NO sense.
1303461968506839041 2020-09-09 06:35:25 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Was her life irrelevant?  The 3 women who started BLM openly says they are markist. Check out their mission statement.  If BLM yes they would help with those things but what they doing? Burning, looting,  murder  https://t.co/yvS184fWYQ
1303452916246884357 2020-09-09 05:59:26 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage 2 helping with someone going to college? Cleaning up neighborhoods, helping LA residents from the hurricane? NO❗❗❗ALL LIVES DO MATTER
1303452380042756096 2020-09-09 05:57:19 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage BLM is a markist organization.  So your saying because I'm white my life isnt as important? Your falling for a fake narrative.  Blacks are at a greater risk at being killed by another black then anyone else. Are BLM helping in Chicago? Are they building community centers or
1303451221215326211 2020-09-09 05:52:42 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @WEWS When and why were they built to begin with?
1303434479537737728 2020-09-09 04:46:11 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @WEWS Your station has pushed the mask thing over and over. Has anyone considered that all people CAN NOT wear masks? I have been turned away twice for health care because of the mandate.  How is this for my health?
1303433672771633154 2020-09-09 04:42:58 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @candaele_1 @BauerOutage Not the organization!!!!! Do some research.  ALL LIVES MATTER
1303400896634683397 2020-09-09 02:32:44 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @GovMikeDeWine WHAT FUCKING PART OF EVERYONE CANT WEAR A MASK DO NOT UNDERSTAND??? You say it's for health but I have been turned away twice now for health care. LIFT YOUR DAMN MANDATE
1303390943261921280 2020-09-09 01:53:11 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @atensnut I'm waiting for it
1303390666509160449 2020-09-09 01:52:05 +0800 <MarshaDerheime1> @BauerOutage Apparently BLM on the pitchers mound is ok too.
