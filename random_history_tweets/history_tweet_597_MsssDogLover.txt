1331839070960574465 2020-11-26 13:55:53 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @philipsknowlton Ya think...? 🤣
1331709138863337474 2020-11-26 05:19:35 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @RealBrysonGray I will never give up! I’m just wondering how many times this has happened in the past and proud to have a President to stand up and fight for the American people.

1331304826274189312 2020-11-25 02:32:59 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @kaitlancollins And when Joe Biden is asked about our kids going back to school he says why are you always asking me these things...... can we get some REAL journalism?

1331292586527617024 2020-11-25 01:44:21 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @JoeBiden First you need to get YOUR Democrat house in order, maybe you can start to “unite” the country by calling off the squad. And what about Senator Eisenstein? #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver

1330562659356381188 2020-11-23 01:23:53 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @_denisv_ @realDonaldTrump Sounds like your speaking for the dead voters, illegal voters and ones that voted multiple times. Your definitely not speaking for the over 73 million alive and legal voters that voted one time. #CountEveryLegalVote
1330522133395607558 2020-11-22 22:42:51 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @AOC Stop pushing the race card! He’s not privileged, he was fortunate that someone with money wasn’t blinded by lies YOUR party is pushing.  So sick of this game your playing
1330514766805274625 2020-11-22 22:13:34 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @ElijahSchaffer That is ridiculous! I’m glad I went before this because I sure wouldn’t go now.
1330513677326364672 2020-11-22 22:09:15 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @realDonaldTrump They really are going to far with the lies

1330166809581023232 2020-11-21 23:10:55 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @JoeBiden Here’s the deal: Voter fraud is real, American people would like to know what all legal vote totals are. When you OFFICIALLY get the President- Elect I’m sure you will NOT have any issues. You and the media need to STOP spinning this story incorrectly

1329874616911884293 2020-11-21 03:49:51 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @JoeBiden You sure are making a lot of promises on DAY 1. Let’s see IF you legally get elected what you actually do. In 47 years you did NOTHING 🤔 #whereshunterbiden
1329872526101639173 2020-11-21 03:41:32 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @kirstiealley I have one named Tom (a rescue) and yes he looks like the Talking Tom 🤣

1329605527505080321 2020-11-20 10:00:35 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @The80sRevisited @MrAndyNgo And called her a cracker over and over

1329567531720470528 2020-11-20 07:29:36 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @AOC Why would you make this about race? We have rights to honest elections. People should not vote more than once in a election and dead people can’t vote. As Biden says “come on” #DrainTheSwamp
1329564012745527297 2020-11-20 07:15:37 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @JimmyKimmelLive @BarackObama I’ll be sure to NOT watch this arrogant jerk who after being elected twice believes we are a racist country. Obama, nobody was spooked by you just disappointed at what little you did in office.

1329527018317377543 2020-11-20 04:48:37 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @ElijahSchaffer Joe Biden is well known for “stealing” other people’s ideas and phrases. He is a fake politician! What a embarrassment!
1329525307263553537 2020-11-20 04:41:49 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @HeatherIAm23 The are more dangerous! Even after that news conference they are twisting the truth to fit the current narrative.

1329513758176243713 2020-11-20 03:55:55 +0800 <MsssDogLover> @MrMichaelBurkes Yet they still find a way put a unrealistic twist to fit the current narrative! It amazes me how these people are so blind to the truth.
