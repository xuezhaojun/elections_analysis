Ny has so many pretty little towns and to see them in their hay day was a sight, I’m sure. The town I grew up in has changed so much since I was a kid. Closed shops, homes in disrepair, it’s just sad
1341051745116545024 2020-12-22 00:03:46 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @twoifbytweet Where in NY? I’m from upstate

1341039866767929344 2020-12-21 23:16:34 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> So I had a friend over yesterday and she mentioned that she orders Chinese on Christmas like in The Christmas Story.   I’m all about this. Would you be?   What’s your Christmas dinner tradition?  https://t.co/hKe4Y2xVQ3

1340858284358705152 2020-12-21 11:15:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ChrisWickNews I don’t want the vaccination and you’d damn well have to knock me out before I’d ever let you near me with that garbage.

1340836642794442752 2020-12-21 09:49:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> The way my Dad was rooting for golden boy Mahomes makes me think he had a lil somethin’ somethin’ riding on it 🤨
1340834732188323840 2020-12-21 09:41:26 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @TeresaEdelglass @NFL Yup. Basically. But when my dad who I haven’t seen since covid hit wants to watch the game I’m all in. It’s my dad and it’s ALWAYS been our tradition.

1340085429484347393 2020-12-19 08:03:58 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Attorneys hold a Juris Doctorate and rarely do I ever hear of one being called “Doctor”. I once had a professor/friend who is an attorney try to pull the doctor stuff and I was like, I’m not calling you doctor or esquire or any other title. Just silliness

1339784803437035520 2020-12-18 12:09:23 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I stand amazed. Solid piece on the politicization of SCOTUS at the hand of John Roberts.

1339760362581864453 2020-12-18 10:32:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RockyJuniorJon1 NY is beautiful, i miss it from time to time(especially on days like today when they get 44inches of snow) but I will never move back. The politics have made it so no one can afford to live there
1339759665383653377 2020-12-18 10:29:30 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> 1 more day of the busiest week of my year. Almost done ✅ but I’m 😴 no lie.   I’m going to sleep hard tomorrow night  https://t.co/NjreMNVgsr

1339752795428274179 2020-12-18 10:02:12 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Omg, are you serious right now? This coming from a guy who was banging a Chinese spy. You didn’t ACTUALLY think she was that into you, did you?

1339626771071852547 2020-12-18 01:41:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> In the last 2 days I’ve seen a Santa on a Harley at Target with a bag of toys and now a Santa on a golf cart handing out gifts.   God Bless you Santa 🎅🏻 🙏🏻
1339584995212419076 2020-12-17 22:55:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RockyJuniorJon1 Bingo. She’s a CNN worshipper. Loathes my president. I thought these fools were suppose to be happy that Biden was their president? She’s even more miserable then I last saw her. Oh well, she dropped him off and left. I get plenty of one on one time now with my dad.
1339583886477598721 2020-12-17 22:51:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @pwc606 @nypost Lol. Don’t regret the decision in the morning. Skip the beer goggles
1339582528135585792 2020-12-17 22:45:37 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Possible snow here in Northern Virginia on Christmas Day. I can only remember once since I moved here it snowing on Christmas Eve. Just once.   I’m kinda excited at the possibility of a white Christmas ❄️ ⛄️ 🎄
1339572587916120067 2020-12-17 22:06:07 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @nypost @pwc606 But you’re always fuzzy cause you’re always drinking.

1339442797682831361 2020-12-17 13:30:23 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> It’s 12:30am and my fathers alarm clock is blaring. He of course cannot hear it bc he takes his hearing aids out  Gotta love my dad. I’m just ecstatic he’s here and I get to spend time with him.   But have no doubt, I will bust on him for making the alarm clock blare in the AM 😆

I can point to 2 women who sat their asses in front of the TV and binged daily on junk while being consumed by fake news fear mongering   It’s sad to see ppl give up on life and let themselves go to hell

1338852724021092352 2020-12-15 22:25:38 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Busiest week of the entire year. Always has been always will be for me.   So how do you make it even more crazy? Throwing a snow storm, Covid, and deadlines into the mix.   on the brighter side of things I FINALLY get to see my dad. Praise God
1338692331449487362 2020-12-15 11:48:18 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @x4changes So will pardoning them allow for declassification?
1338689922153271300 2020-12-15 11:38:43 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Alright Patriots, what’s your opinion on a potential Trump pardon for Julian Assange and or Edward Snowden?   My opinion is probably not popular so I will refrain, though I’d like to hear yours.

1338630175320207360 2020-12-15 07:41:18 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Venmo...it’s like the twitter of payments. But why would you ever keep your account public? I don’t need to see that 😳
1338603191269732355 2020-12-15 05:54:05 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @DLlevara @CrashPatriot @MichaelDeLauzon @realDonaldTrump @Maximus_4EVR @LLinWood @aspen_lindsay There is mass confusion and fake news is leading the charge
1338586706296102915 2020-12-15 04:48:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I love this for so many reasons. Now I have zero interest in Tesla but damn I adore this guy.

1338569596559912963 2020-12-15 03:40:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @DLlevara What!!! Now I gotta look
1338565420396269571 2020-12-15 03:24:00 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> IF Trump it’s not inaugurated in January what is the solution? Does the party of #MAGA Form a New party?   If Trump has taught us anything it’s that we don’t have to live under Republican control. We are the voice of the party yet they won’t listen.   so then what?

1338498701959032833 2020-12-14 22:58:53 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RockyJuniorJon1 Nope. You’ll cave on Christmas 😆
1338497646827335681 2020-12-14 22:54:41 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RockyJuniorJon1 Lol. I’m glad to hear that. From thanksgiving till Christmas can be a bit rough. I feel like I work hard all year to enjoy the holidays tho. However, VA bestie makes these nutball things that are my favorite but eating just one sends me into sugar shock
1338492472255721472 2020-12-14 22:34:08 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Ha!!! #KetoKitties LOVE THIS. Stocking stuffer  https://t.co/3Q33nl8MOf

1338324746988113920 2020-12-14 11:27:39 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @TheJordanRachel I do agree but will add that you probably already should have had that locked down during the Obama years
1338280477002698754 2020-12-14 08:31:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Absolute bullshit. Another bad call followed by a bullshit penalty to end a #Saints come back 🤬
1338278000790540290 2020-12-14 08:21:54 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> If I ever have a daughter and saw her dressed like this we’d be having words followed by actions.   Hey Michelle, maybe you should be spending less time on telling parents what to feed their kids and more time parenting your own. Ones into drugs and the other looks trashy
1338263556479971328 2020-12-14 07:24:30 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Makes you wonder if the box cake princess he was dating was made to sign a non-disclosure. She probably lives in fear  https://t.co/epjQhxzsfg

1338163731591811073 2020-12-14 00:47:50 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @cajunhusker The Supreme Court ruling SHOULD cover that now. Even my Governor had to respect the precedent set by the high court

1337891817682067457 2020-12-13 06:47:20 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Hey @GovernorVA here’s a big 🖕and Merry Christmas as I head out to a Christmas party where we will be exceeding your limit for gathering 😘 Your covid bs won’t stop us from celebrating the birth of our Savior or the fellowship we will share.

1336761531384672257 2020-12-10 03:55:59 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> It came as no shock to me that the SCOTUS didn’t grant certiorari with the PA case. You have to have standing and meat on the bone so to speak  The PA case was too narrowly tailored  TX case could conceivably invalidate the 62 electoral votes. SCOTUS followed its typical pattern
1336754032392744960 2020-12-10 03:26:11 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Don’t unclinch those butt cheeks just yet clown. This fight ain’t over and we both know and understand how the SCOTUS works.

1335748238520033280 2020-12-07 08:49:31 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> THIS has been a total game changer. From 10-14 migraines a month down to 1-2 and those are actually manageable. No more vomiting, drop to your knees kind of pain. Emgality changed all that. I’m incredibly grateful 🙏🏻  https://t.co/4nc8XOo6yI

1335242796366782464 2020-12-05 23:21:04 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Justice_3SO Isn’t it though? So you can sit in a hot tub with all those germs flying and the possibility of spreading the scary “virus” to others Not to mention all the foot traffic in the actual expo center but guns are scary. So does this mean the virus is fake?
1335240719536107523 2020-12-05 23:12:49 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Oh how interesting, they can approve a hot tub show at the Dulles expo YET Governor blackface clansrobe and our commie AG go to court over the nations gun show in the EXACT SAME LOCATION to get it shut down bc of “covid”.   Bullshit!

With all of your public display of hatred for Donald Trump this has ripped your family a part. You have verbally abused your wife and your child shames your family name on the daily but she only learned that from her daddy. #stopthestupid

1329854868597694464 2020-11-21 02:31:22 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Isn’t it something that all these republicans keep contracting the scary virus YET DiFi and Pelosi run around w/o masks and are just fine 🤔

1329845753825652747 2020-11-21 01:55:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> This caller on @RealRLimbaugh is speaking for us all

1329820262523678728 2020-11-21 00:13:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> When a dude enters the zoom meeting with a mask on and is serious as 💩 about it.   🙄🙄🙄😂🤣😆

Suicide rate, the amount of anxiety medication and depression from fear of global warmer and living with their white guilt. These are the chicken littles stepping into power. Frightening

1328752161753337857 2020-11-18 01:29:37 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @GovernorVA I saw these lib millennials cheering on Big Gretch’s decision to shut down MI. They think she’s a badass boss. It’s sad really. We can’t be friends
1328751481550483457 2020-11-18 01:26:54 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ChatChristi I am SOOO jealous. Have some fun in the sun ☀️ and enjoy freedom
1328751006910443520 2020-11-18 01:25:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @GovernorVA This applies to all Virginians unless you’re BLM or Antifa or a Joe Biden supporter. Yet Americans who follow the law are the ones subjected to contact tracing.
1328734757811871745 2020-11-18 00:20:27 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Well that’s unfortunate

1328702471837986822 2020-11-17 22:12:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Run out(if you dare to) and grab mouth wash to fight off COVID-19. No need for a vaccine. There, that’s done, now reopen EVERYTHING. This round of mouthwash is on me.
1328698167869775875 2020-11-17 21:55:03 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> So here’s a question, are you going to quit your job, lock yourself in your home, have everything delivered, wipe anything that comes in from outside down like mail and let your dog pee on the floor?   You can’t stop daily functions or you will be much sick from a normal cold

1327358141672120320 2020-11-14 05:10:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> You know what I’d respect? If she just came out and said “hey, I’m human. My emotions got the best of me. I have bought the liberal narrative hook line and sinker. We called AZ and shame on you for not believing us.”   At least then we’d know you’re honest instead of lying 🤥

1323761787611860992 2020-11-04 06:59:39 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @DFBHarvard @ChatChristi @RealRLimbaugh @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I listened to what he said about his life and what the meaning of life is, not something he would normally entertain on Election Day. He deserves to enjoy life without work and I will push back my selfishness and honor that.
1323755753077985281 2020-11-04 06:35:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @DFBHarvard @ChatChristi @RealRLimbaugh @foxandfriends Sadly I got the feeling today after this interview and his show that once we re-elect @realDonaldTrump Rush will gracefully go out on top and enjoy his life.

1323282619459665922 2020-11-02 23:15:36 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @tamsfitz @realDonaldTrump Ok just read. He’s pushing us to get out and vote. I believe because the polls have been up in trumps favor the past few days so we need not get too comfortable and think we can stay home in Florida and not vote. It was optimistic yet very cautious
1323281959943102464 2020-11-02 23:12:59 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @tamsfitz @realDonaldTrump I’m heading over to read

No fun
1322657583740514304 2020-11-01 05:51:56 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @dougo050445 I mean I like fall, pumpkins and apple picking, bonfires and such but not the guts and gore of it.

1322325627459035137 2020-10-31 07:52:51 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Still won’t see me. No thanksgiving and I shipped Christmas a few gifts to him today. He hasn’t said it but I know there will be no celebrating Christmas together either ESPECIALLY when Trump is re-elected on Tuesday
1322323508756701185 2020-10-31 07:44:26 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> In 2020 The authoritarians have succeeded in dividing families and keeping us from one another with this China virus  So much contention even between me and my own father. He’s always been the parent which I am the closest to. Sadly, I fear those days are gone   2020 sucks

Now he’s just actively trying to throw an election for the opponent by contacting debate moderators. SCUMBAG

1318987554306359304 2020-10-22 02:48:33 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Holy Shit!!! @RealRLimbaugh is always on top of it.   Rush is Saying the reason that the #Hunterbidenlaptop was not turned in a year ago was so that the powers at be could control Joe Biden to get him to do their dirty work when the time comes.   now it makes sense
1318984322301513730 2020-10-22 02:35:42 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RayDWeatherford Do you ever stop and ask yourself what the hell is wrong with these people? Why do they not use common sense? Are they even capable of thinking for themselves?
1318983070616268804 2020-10-22 02:30:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Umm @RealRLimbaugh I am not complaining that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are nowhere to be found. It is looking identical to 2016 and they have learned nothing...so be it!   #TrumpTrain full speed ahead  https://t.co/m2tuNB2wrp
1318968107633958913 2020-10-22 01:31:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Is everyone hearing this caller on Rush?    He’s a libertarian who was not going to vote for Trump BUT now has cast his vote for Trump solely because of the riots.  I wonder how many others out there will be doing the same?
1318967529835036673 2020-10-22 01:28:59 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> If you wear a mask while you drive we can’t be friends. Period.   I don’t need this kind of stupidity in my life
1318961451449667584 2020-10-22 01:04:49 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Kinda funny coming from a man who turned down his own priest who requested they be allowed to marry a woman and start a family
1318960656851271682 2020-10-22 01:01:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @BlueJeanCat Amen sista!
1318960535224913921 2020-10-22 01:01:11 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @YDP Yeah that broad’s book was two books down
1318960438634270722 2020-10-22 01:00:48 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> So will you be marrying a homosexual couple? Putting Gods stamp of approval on this marriage? If so I would say that your salvation is in question
1318959820293230595 2020-10-22 00:58:20 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @AWilliams61 Dang I should have. Instead I just flip them all over
1318959737719951360 2020-10-22 00:58:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @YDP Shocking right that not one book had been purchased
1318959637920710661 2020-10-22 00:57:37 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @BlueJeanCat I attend a Baptist Bible teaching church and my pastor does not preach BUT only from scripture. I’ve really appreciated his sermons on fear and this Covid nonsense and what God has to say about it
1318958870346240002 2020-10-22 00:54:34 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Flip that sh*t over. No one wants to see that 🥴  https://t.co/kGPWV5ZvJS
1318958156630949888 2020-10-22 00:51:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @BlueJeanCat So so happy for you.
1318958005782745089 2020-10-22 00:51:08 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @BlueJeanCat This is wonderful news, friend. I grew up Catholic and left the church when I was 14 before confirmation and my mom and me started attending a Bible teaching church. I was baptized at 15 and I’ve never looked back. It was very freeing as I started to actually learn my bible
1318957208726654976 2020-10-22 00:47:58 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Son of a bitch they are messing with me 🤬🤬🤬  https://t.co/mb7boT15CX
1318952749476814848 2020-10-22 00:30:15 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Rush is so correct on this one. If you haven’t seen a Trump rally in a couple of weeks you really need to be tuned in and watching. They’ll have you saying ‘What Polls’???  https://t.co/13J9ltnZZg
1318948332782440449 2020-10-22 00:12:42 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CherCee59 Agreed. But I rather bring back Jesus and stop relying on man
1318947581708390400 2020-10-22 00:09:42 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I would encourage you to get into your Bibles and read if you think that this man is upholding the word of God. Don’t take his word for it, See for yourself what the actual word says. He has perverted Catholicism beyond recognition
1318925977741856769 2020-10-21 22:43:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I was able to retweet @realDonaldTrump (as if I’d give up on that) and what I figured out was...  -it will pop up as a quote tweet   -leave it blank and press press tweet  we must figure out ways around election interference and censorship.  Keep pressing Patriots. 13 days to go
1318913955872579585 2020-10-21 21:56:05 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @cantika17024242 @realDonaldTrump But I can’t RT anything. Nothing.
1318912843065032704 2020-10-21 21:51:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> So apparently I’m being punished. I am not able to RT any of your things. This is #ElectionInterference
1318912346618736640 2020-10-21 21:49:42 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @EmperorJayLay7 Nope. Just tried. Then I attempted to RT myself and the same thing. It won’t allow.
1318911502234144769 2020-10-21 21:46:20 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> WTF...I go to retweet @realDonaldTrump and it won’t even give the option. Instantly kicks me into quote tweeting. Your days are numbered, Jack  https://t.co/dF9vyNY9PH
1318900634100375554 2020-10-21 21:03:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Lol you ppl are a joke.

1318364575356620800 2020-10-20 09:33:03 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @LarryOConnor It was rough listening to him give his update at the opening of the show. I sat in my car and cried. He is America’s conservative voice.
1318304331125477376 2020-10-20 05:33:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I’ve had kind of a crappy day. Then the mail comes and it’s a surprise from my forever bestie in NY. She knows I collect nutcrackers and would love this, but it’s so much more then just a nutcracker..it’s our connection   Friends are friends forever, if the Lords the Lord of them  https://t.co/31VDGdfY3X
1318275637019398145 2020-10-20 03:39:38 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 I sat in my car and cried while he opened the show with the update. Hit me like a ton of bricks.

1318171951832158208 2020-10-19 20:47:38 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> This makes me smile. The little ducky was Sadie girls favorite toy for probably going on 15 years. She loved that duck. Now Yo-Yo goes and gets it to find me so we can play. It’s his favorite too. So incredibly sweet and like a little bit of Sadie dog is still here with me 🥰😭  https://t.co/yGTYot57X2
1318167858380214274 2020-10-19 20:31:22 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Does this look like a President to you? The masked fool.  https://t.co/ss9IYZBXOv
1318163293815607299 2020-10-19 20:13:14 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @jaketapper Oh darlin, that dog don’t hunt. @MorningsMaria is blowing this whole #HunterBidensEmails scandal wide open.
1318160285157478400 2020-10-19 20:01:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Did #HunterBiden pay for the #BigGuyJoeBiden’s milkshake too?
1318155778419810304 2020-10-19 19:43:22 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> You know damn well @DrBiden knew her kids and husband were involved in Chinese communist money laundering payouts.   This is a NATIONAL SECURITY issue and your BIG GUY husband is at the head of it all. #BidenCrimeFamiily and momma knew
1318153417727102983 2020-10-19 19:33:59 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> All of this chaos with the impeachments, Russia, FBI, it all ties back to one person-Hillary Clinton. She is always responsible for the chaos yet is never held accountable.   WHEN WILL THIS STOP   In @realDonaldTrump next term he’s going to have to gut these institutions like FBI

1318022132698329093 2020-10-19 10:52:18 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Is it just me or does it seem like the only administration official who is digging deep in uncovering the #HunterBidensEmails and #HuntersLapTop scandal is @RudyGiuliani???   The swamp is deep. Thank The Lord That @realDonaldTrump has Rudy on his side
1318021516940935172 2020-10-19 10:49:51 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @diiblack @marklevinshow @RudyGiuliani Yup
1318021449538539520 2020-10-19 10:49:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Wow. WTH is whitey bulgers nephew doing in the middle of the #HunterBiden scandal? And John Kerry’s step-son???   Keep digging @RudyGiuliani  @marklevinshow
1318016907216363522 2020-10-19 10:31:32 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @diiblack @marklevinshow @RudyGiuliani How about that reflection in Rudy’s.
1318016396572450816 2020-10-19 10:29:31 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 *hard. Sorry. Was watching Rudy on levin
1318014457314988032 2020-10-19 10:21:48 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 I just have a heard time believing that one man pulled off that entire operation. Especially after seeing the security cam videos
1318013043863937025 2020-10-19 10:16:11 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 Not to mention that the father appeared to have a violent past in Vegas too
1318011956440256512 2020-10-19 10:11:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I think both @marklevinshow and @RudyGiuliani have the same glasses 🤓
1318011671223349255 2020-10-19 10:10:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Watching @marklevinshow he’s digging in deep to the #HunterBidenEmails and #HuntersLapTop. @RudyGiuliani is on  now!!!
1318010221181177858 2020-10-19 10:04:58 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 Yeah I traveled down the rabbit hole and followed the theories
1318009805068533762 2020-10-19 10:03:19 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 The RT91 shooting and the way Aldean dealt with it, not alerting fans that it was an active shooting, was enough for me to stop listening to his music or hit up jiffy lube pavilion when he’s in town. Hard pass
1318008697667375105 2020-10-19 09:58:55 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 I have MANY thoughts on this. It’s amazing to me how they basically muzzled the media and never answered questions. What’s even crazier is how everyone just stopped pressing for answers. Could this really be the work of one man?   Side note... Bilzerian became a headline
1318005439083257856 2020-10-19 09:45:58 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 Girlfriend was buying time. They’ve been gunning for her since she announced her candidacy. Speaking of, you know who I miss? Milo Yiannopoulos, I recently saw him at an event with her.   Do you have a theory on the shooting?
1318002900858265601 2020-10-19 09:35:53 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @catturd2 He discredited himself years ago

1316909873536401408 2020-10-16 09:12:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Wow @SavannahGuthrie you’re a mouthy little brat. You interrupt the people asking questions and you’re screaming like a little girl. Shame on you.   P.S your shoes are beyond ugly 💁🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
1316908806132146179 2020-10-16 09:08:21 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @EmperorJayLay7 Well isn’t he lucky. He’s made millions from Ukraine and Russia bc of his kids and yet no hard question. I mean why bother right? No big deal 🙄🤬
1316908259526299648 2020-10-16 09:06:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @RobinPasquazzi @realDonaldTrump Right? Let her ask a question
1316907788858253314 2020-10-16 09:04:18 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @EmperorJayLay7 But she’s embarrassing herself. And one had to wonder how she ever got her job. Not attractive in the least
1316907425346342914 2020-10-16 09:02:51 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I’m diggin the chick over @realDonaldTrump stage right shoulder. Girlfriends got that head just a boppin!   #NBCTrumptownhall

I use to have him speak at my women’s Republican club when I was president. Many in the club did not like him bc he was too conservative. Oh well. However I was shocked he pulled that stunt at the convention, toyed with that Never Trumper nonsense 🙄
1316479243082248193 2020-10-15 04:41:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @gadeforvirginia @MarkWarner Excuse me for saying it but they are a bunch of losers. Talk about establishment elite. Cuccinelli would have been Governor of VA if they didn’t close the war chest and openly give up. They actually came out 2 weeks before and said they’d get em in 4 years
1316476626968903680 2020-10-15 04:31:01 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 @gadeforvirginia @MarkWarner Gade is extremely impressive! Canvassing the vote by following the presidents poll #s w/minorities is smart. Remember, Gillespie only lost by .8% and the fact that Warner is running multiple attack ads and debating Gade tells us they r worried. Now if only the RPV would inject $$

1316390099442110465 2020-10-14 22:47:11 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @evdeanna 💯 it’s refreshing to see such a strong conservative woman
1316375143502016514 2020-10-14 21:47:45 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> This may not be a popular tweet however I have been pleasantly surprised by Dianne Feinstein the last 3 days. She’s been down right pleasant to #AmyConeyBarrett
1316373669845835776 2020-10-14 21:41:54 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 An example of a great ad placement that hooked me...Ipsy, boxycharm and fabletics. All on Facebook with video ads. Love those subscription boxes and look forward to monthly deliveries.
1316371143129956353 2020-10-14 21:31:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 I agree but with all the “vlogger” accounts on here you’d think a girl could get a lipstick ad or maybe an eye cream 😁
1316369347590402055 2020-10-14 21:24:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 In the age of AI you would think we could get some quality ads. Give me some cute kittens, puppies or makeup. I’m a sucker for glam

1316365564831576070 2020-10-14 21:09:42 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Confession: Senator Lindsey Graham’s opening comments on how ACB is a role model for conservative women has me in my feelings 😭  Have I mentioned that I adore #AmyConeyBarrett
1316356949672370176 2020-10-14 20:35:28 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I just opened Twitter for the first time this morning and my home page was full of ads. I blocked 5 before even getting to an actual tweet.   Anyone else’s cluttered with dumb ads?
1316354979301601280 2020-10-14 20:27:38 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> That’s too bad. I was rooting for her. Oh well

1316184804547792897 2020-10-14 09:11:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Out of all Senators who questioned ACB today Josh Hawley is the one who caught my attention. Could he be a rising star?   Also, he’s easy on the eyes. What? Like you didn’t notice 🤷🏼‍♀️

She’s hatin on ACB  I told my father, cupcake (that’s what I call his gf to replace a cuss) is intimidating by the very sight of Barrett. She is everything a woman should aspire to be. Maybe cupcake should take notes 📝
1316160947871010821 2020-10-14 07:36:37 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 are you seeing @ScottPresler hosting the @RSBNetwork Trump rally? He has such nice skin not to mention he’s adorbs  https://t.co/UlhEH1psDn

1316153533436170242 2020-10-14 07:07:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> What planet are these fools living on to think The Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare “is just too good to give up”???   Oh wait!!!

1316062963179163650 2020-10-14 01:07:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> God Bless ACB as she sits through Sheldon Whitehouse and his “amicus flotilla” charts 🙄🤣😂   Come on Girl, you know you want to laugh at him as he flamboyantly points to his flow charts 😆😆😆
1316056244633980928 2020-10-14 00:40:34 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I stand thoroughly impressed with @YouTubeTV which I now take every where with me. Gave me the ability to listen to the confirmation hearings while I was driving today. Pretty cool 😎
1316047485429841920 2020-10-14 00:05:46 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Maybe it’s just me and the mood I’m in but does anyone else feel like Mike Lee is treating this confirmation hearing and his 15 minutes in the spotlight as a job interview and I don’t mean for Amy I mean for himself?    I’m kind of annoyed

1315802260035850241 2020-10-13 07:51:19 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Is it possible that @realDonaldTrump looks better after covid then before? I believe so #TrumpRallyFlorida

1315707071300599809 2020-10-13 01:33:05 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 @RealRLimbaugh Had to make sure you grabbed it up. For years he’s fought back against social media but the gloves are now off
1315704667121364992 2020-10-13 01:23:31 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 @RealRLimbaugh Ha. You responded quicker then I could tweet you 😁

1315703819339280385 2020-10-13 01:20:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Did you all just hear Rush Limbaugh? This will be his active Twitter handle moving forward @RealRLimbaugh   Follow it as he will be active on the account.

1315672444624142342 2020-10-12 23:15:29 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Does it shock anyone that Amy Klobuchar would come out attacking Amy Coney Barrett?   Klobuchar is an angry hag who finds Barrett repulsive YET abortion up to and after birth is a fine procedure   Evil witch
1315671100907565056 2020-10-12 23:10:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 WHY are they putting her through this. I wish we could take her out for dinner and drinks later to let know she took one for the team and how immensely proud of her we are
1315668756773900289 2020-10-12 23:00:50 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Ben Sasse was really good too. Told them all they needed a civics lesson 😂
1315665931008389120 2020-10-12 22:49:36 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Amy Klobuchar just blamed the entire  virus on @realDonaldTrump   I bet it enraged her so much she had to beat a staffer or two.
1315664613971820544 2020-10-12 22:44:22 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 I played around and made the BEST peppermint mocha.  Take the chocolate mousse, like 3/4ths of a serving, one cup of coffee, add it to and then add about a half tbsp of peppermint creamer. All you need is some cabin in Lake Tahoe to enjoy this yummy concoction🎄
1315662199088721921 2020-10-12 22:34:46 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 I’m right there with ya 🤬
1315659845375348737 2020-10-12 22:25:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> And dang it all I ran out of peppermint coffee creamer 😡😫  So not in the mood for this crap this morning...grrrrrr
1315659457641295872 2020-10-12 22:23:53 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> This hearing is nothing but Democrats whinnying and crying   Dems:blah blah blah orange man bad...blah blah blah Trump sucks...blah blah blah...virus is Trumps fault...BLAH BLAH BLAH...BLAH BLAH...BLAH BLAH   Shut up and VOTE   #AmyComeyBarrett

1315655683296104449 2020-10-12 22:08:53 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Sen Durbin-we know what Trump thinks because he tweets it out 25 times a day  And yet you STILL haven’t figured out @realDonaldTrump and do you know why? HE’S NOT ONE OF YOU
1315652358181969921 2020-10-12 21:55:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Have they learned NOTHING from @realDonaldTrump
1315651727610216450 2020-10-12 21:53:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Why do republicans refuse to have the upper hand. If the Democrats had the votes and they were in our position there’s no way in hell that they would’ve held a confirmation hearing. This close to election they would’ve rammed her confirmation through
1315648862737051654 2020-10-12 21:41:47 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> How dumb is it that these fools are turning a Supreme Court Confirmation Hearing into a zoom party.   Republicans-this chaos is your fault. There is zero reason to hold these hearings. You are wasting the Americans time and money. Irritatingly irresponsible
1315462369846464513 2020-10-12 09:20:43 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ChatChristi WTF is right!!!

1315443231228858368 2020-10-12 08:04:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 I will admit there is part of me that almost clicked on it. But then I disciplined myself and pulled away. I’d end up an ugly crying mess
1315440482852442115 2020-10-12 07:53:45 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> While scrolling through HBOmax I come across this documentary called “Abortion-stories women tell”. Basically glamorizing the procedure.   I can’t even. F*cking Animals.

1313543435740221443 2020-10-07 02:15:34 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Mark Stein-I like seeing women’s faces but you can’t see them behind the mask tho some do wear it below their nose which is kind of sexy 🤣🤣🤣

1313472513893191680 2020-10-06 21:33:45 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @VictorFaculty I haven’t figured out who runs his account. There are tweets that fire off from this account rapidly during the show. Is he getting paid by a 3 party to push things?
1313464628953915392 2020-10-06 21:02:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @MsCecileB For me it’s muscle tension. Even though it may be hot out my body always feels better in the summer months. I also know that my thyroid causes my muscles to be real tense. I’m waiting for my gym to re-open the hot tubs but that won’t be until Gov blackface moves to phase 4

1313173453428621312 2020-10-06 01:45:23 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> So the daily soap opera narrative is Biden’s up by 13pts in a new poll. ONE POLL. Same poll that had Hillary up by 11 pts.   How’d that work for her?   Notice how the media is ignoring ALL OTHER POLLS.

1311036724504596480 2020-09-30 04:14:47 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @VictorFaculty @ChrisPlanteShow Just read. They will never be held accountable
1311021863011864577 2020-09-30 03:15:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Okay, mass confusion...the judge Sullivan I worked for was a family court judge. No affiliation
1311021265222881280 2020-09-30 03:13:21 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @clawsons84 Lol the man I worked for was a family court judge
1311018439260209159 2020-09-30 03:02:08 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> It’s funny to see Judge Sullivan trending. I worked for a Judge Sullivan, he wrote my letter of recommendation for law school.   ...he also baked the best bread 🍞
1310991375614312448 2020-09-30 01:14:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 @realDonaldTrump It will be Trumps fault. It always is 🙄
1310990261598724099 2020-09-30 01:10:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> With @realDonaldTrump wanting Drug testing, refusing a break and a checking for ear buds-all reasonable things- will this be enough for Joe Biden to cancel last minute?
1310936708620390400 2020-09-29 21:37:22 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Y’all are shameful. You seem to think that a Veteran must fall in line and vote the way you tell them to. A veterans group partnering with @ProjectLincoln an organization that is run by Wife beaters, child abusers and are funded by Russia. You are not credible
1310929700143931394 2020-09-29 21:09:31 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @VictorFaculty @Leerose1985 @ChrisPlanteShow He needs to listen to that song. Shake some of his resting bitch voice. Just sayin

Today will be challenging as I see the left is attacking Christianity leading up to tonight’s debate and Amy’s confirmation  I raise a hallelujah, in the presence of my enemies   https://t.co/X5f0BHOrdp

1310741766077919232 2020-09-29 08:42:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ShannonHeid Completely! It’s sad actually that some many don’t have that sense of faith and community. But ya know what, who’s the first person these secular family members/friends reach out to when someone is sick and in need of prayer...you are! Sure, it’s my pleasure to pray for you

1310737061356269568 2020-09-29 08:24:02 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> What is the beef with ACB’s Christian group she belongs too?  I’m a conservative Christian woman who belongs to bible studies, church women’s groups and my girls and I have a system, all we have to do is text-Pray-and we’re on it  Extreme?

1310566533270327297 2020-09-28 21:06:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Interesting 🤔 I just did a search in the Kohl’s app and I have yet to find any proof of this.

1310560875099631617 2020-09-28 20:43:56 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @BhawksGo Ugh. That’s terrible. Did the surgeries help?  Mine allergies are no where near as bad as your wife’s. I take Allegra and that usually helps but I forgot to take it twice this weekend and I’m feeling it today.
1310542727466147840 2020-09-28 19:31:49 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Ya know, I never had seasonal allergies until I moved to Virginia 🤧

1309542707564556288 2020-09-26 01:18:06 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @YDP @GovernorVA I think someone should tell BLM that Ralph Northam plans on being home for a couple of days
1309541154027909120 2020-09-26 01:11:55 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Our blackface @GovernorVA is nothing but a f*ing hypocrite. Guess who’s got the vid?  https://t.co/3QJ3uJ5LrL
1309539633592782849 2020-09-26 01:05:53 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> “Gov Ralph Northam won’t be leaving the governor’s mansion for a few days after testing positive for covid-19”   Isn’t it funny, these 2 have been all over VA including schools in the past week and yet we are constantly lectured on how we have to stay home. Enjoy your quarantine
1309534736260493312 2020-09-26 00:46:25 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Rush...😂🙃😂 that bit about @GovernorVA was fricken hilarious 🤣
1309514080785436672 2020-09-25 23:24:21 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I’m so over these damn masks. You do your makeup and for what 🤷🏼‍♀️
1309491172398825473 2020-09-25 21:53:19 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @OrangeButterfli Ofcourse not. That would mean the spotlight would be taken off of him
1309488202734919680 2020-09-25 21:41:31 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Holy shit this loser has just witnessed the biggest political coup in his life and the life of this country and yet THIS is what he leads with. Bill, do you see what you’ve been reduced to? America finds you petty and incompetent but why do you refuse to see it? Seek help!
1309461412620783616 2020-09-25 19:55:04 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Oh isn’t that rich. He, as usual, takes no responsibility for his failed leadership
1309459047666585600 2020-09-25 19:45:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @cajunhusker Ha! Yes. No problem sleeping.

1309444829399613441 2020-09-25 18:49:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Over the past few months I have had multiple dreams that always take place in the home I grew up in. My childhood bedroom specifically. Why do you think?   I don’t believe I miss it and the dreams never pertain to missing it but they take place there. Strange
1309327778328834048 2020-09-25 11:04:03 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Which are you?   Me? I’ve already started Christmas shopping 🎄🎁 walking into Hobby Lobby this time a year is magical  https://t.co/u9pSRZes4C

1309255313862938624 2020-09-25 06:16:06 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ChatChristi Make sure to give that gal some cocoa and cookies 🍪 she’s earned it. I’ve been in her shoes and it’s down right brutal

1309237730845634562 2020-09-25 05:06:14 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I ADORE Daniel Gade. There is no better person for this job then him! God Bless You, Sir 🙏🏻  #VASen #VASenateDebate
1309234570554871809 2020-09-25 04:53:40 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> RGBs own supporters dishonor her. So much for Rest In Peace   If you were at a funeral and someone you didn’t care for walked in would you start to boo??? How utterly disrespectful to the person lying in the coffin.   Grow the hell up you fricken animals
1309230205538623488 2020-09-25 04:36:19 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @LarryOConnor dude from playboy needs to realize that his work is overlooked. No one reads the articles 😂
1309229923534503938 2020-09-25 04:35:12 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Did y’all hear the question asked of Trump, “win loss or draw” would he accept the results of the election?   It wasn’t his answer that caught my eye but the fact that the “journalist” was with Playboy. Yes, Playboy.   You do realize that NO ONE reads the articles, right?

Lanes to no where that abruptly end, dirt flying everywhere, dodging dump trucks and stones, and no lines in some spots so you fight for every piece of road and hope to God it resembles a lane.

1308776930729230337 2020-09-23 22:35:10 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CincyOHIO1 We will never know since the family opted to not have an autopsy.
1308776720187744256 2020-09-23 22:34:20 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @WMcCarthy300 Difference here is he was not military. Does not have the same training.
1308767852263026688 2020-09-23 21:59:06 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @WMcCarthy300 Still a minor
1308757207899660293 2020-09-23 21:16:48 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @WendyDupuis11 In both cases the parents should be held liable.   Greta is autistic and her parents are exploiting her   Rittenhouse is 17 and a minor. Where were the parents. They should be held liable as well.
1308737165136998400 2020-09-23 19:57:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Side note: you still cannot convince me that Antonin Scalia died by natural causes. I will NEVER believe that
1308734744163741696 2020-09-23 19:47:32 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh But as a parent you have got to be aware and protect your child which means keeping them home when necessary. This is negligent parenting.
1308734314180476928 2020-09-23 19:45:50 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 Yet I just read that her clerks will be standing guard...against who? Her own cult I presume
1308733821165211649 2020-09-23 19:43:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @CBradshaw00001 That’s what I thought! No matter who it is I’m just not cool with making a spectacle over their body.
1308733410454777857 2020-09-23 19:42:14 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh I have watched the video, it was excellent. I do feel it was self defense, that said I believe this child never should have been involved in a riot. Was this kid just allowed to run wild? Where are the parents and why weren’t they parenting their child?
1308732311073173504 2020-09-23 19:37:52 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> I thought Ruth Bader Ginsburg was Jewish? Aren’t they suppose to be buried by sundown? I’m confused 🤷🏼‍♀️    https://t.co/0wNVcrI5Nx
1308730662153846785 2020-09-23 19:31:19 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh Well then the friend should be liable and that still does not let his parents off the hook for he was 17, a minor in a different state even if it was 20 minutes away.
1308726389999308800 2020-09-23 19:14:20 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Yes, I believe he acted in self defense. However, I do believe he is still culpable and so are his parents. The gun was registered to someone else as Rittenhouse was not old enough and who lets their 17 yr old travel out of state with a weapon to attend a riot?
1308724185678721025 2020-09-23 19:05:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @GerraughtyFrank Not so sharp before the suns up 🥱

1307339895782998017 2020-09-19 23:24:55 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ScottPresler Scott, one of the first things that came to mind when I read the breaking news was Scott has been screaming this all along! Why it was so incredibly important to re-elect @realDonaldTrump -these nominations shape the court and decisions that will decide America’s fate

1307050156123205637 2020-09-19 04:13:35 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Governor clansrobe says that if the baby survives abortion then the doctor and the mother would make the discussion to finish terminating the infant. How do you think those deformities happened?? The abortion that was botched. You are a doctor who favors KILLING BABIES. SHAMEFUL

You have been corrupted. Shameful

If you have You will understand why I would take my risk with the flu which by the way I had last year and was just fine vs having to inject myself with epinephrine and Benadryl and head to the hospital
1304470445236850688 2020-09-12 01:22:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @JNorr35 I am not frightened by an illness that my body will do it’s job and conquer. The crap that they put in the vaccinations Is suspect
1304469699854467077 2020-09-12 01:19:46 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @JNorr35 And to add to that the flu shot is not a vaccination it is a shot in the dark at whatever strand pops up that year.
1304469160488038400 2020-09-12 01:17:38 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @JNorr35 No I’m not anti-vaccines I’m anti-anaphylactic shock. I am allergic to eggs and the flu shot is incubated in an egg.

1303421414574362627 2020-09-09 03:54:16 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Why the hell are economists tracing peoples phones?! And isn’t it interesting that they will trace Sturgis but not the terrorists of Antifa at BLM rallies who hop from city to burning city and you know these morons aren’t “social distancing” or wearing their damn masks 🙄🙄🙄
1303403482167287813 2020-09-09 02:43:00 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @prime_rr @cajunhusker Yeah but I like the humidity

1303343874765664257 2020-09-08 22:46:09 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Sounds like you need to take your own advice there chica. I’m sure if it were your house he broke into and sexually assaulted you may just be singing a different tune.
1303342847433879553 2020-09-08 22:42:04 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @Leerose1985 Ha! Wilma was a sexy bitch. I’d take that name with a smile 😉

1301486203741536256 2020-09-03 19:44:26 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> @ReddogOHIO And those final stages of pregnancy are not easy but obgyns are trained for this. This is also why a C-section may be the safest route. I have mad respect for women who do natural birthing, they are the true warriors.
1301483951366778881 2020-09-03 19:35:29 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> And dude, have some respect for her too. If you’re not man enough to wear a condom or see her through a pregnancy or delivery you have no busy having sex. You worry about pregnancy and birth but not the fact that abortion raises her risk substantially of breast cancer and lupus.
1301483008122380288 2020-09-03 19:31:44 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> If a woman is concerned about mortality at birth she needs to think about that before having sex. It’s called responsibility, if you’re not responsible enough before having sex chances are you won’t be during or after.

1301314459659632640 2020-09-03 08:21:59 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> When will this Nancy Pelosi-Marie Antoinette of the 21st century, be dethroned??   The salon owner Erica Kious is under serious threat, her business is finished and she is forced to move. But oh yeah, not before she issues an apology to mother Pelosi 🙄😡   #Tucker
1301313134687186945 2020-09-03 08:16:43 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> The salon owner is speaking for  https://t.co/NB19j9V5Tw owner...these are the legislators who enforced these masks laws and closed you down YET they do not have to obey their own laws.

1301302637078421506 2020-09-03 07:35:00 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> If Nancy Pelosi is Marie Antoinette then who is Madame Defarge 🧐🤨??? Who’s sitting and knitting her name into a blanket of code 🤔 Dare I say Americans? Have we had enough???

1301213560769581056 2020-09-03 01:41:02 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> Update: The older lady who has been calling me I was able to get a hold of and explain to her that she had the wrong phone number. She wasn’t amused. I finally had to tell her that I live in Virginia and not New York and that I really was not the person she was looking for 🤷🏼‍♀️

1301128449466212355 2020-09-02 20:02:50 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> This makes NO SENSE. Why would Melania even confide in you AFTER she fired you? Your timeline doesn’t match up. Nice try Darlin, enjoy your 15 mins cuz your time has about expired.

1300633755225333766 2020-09-01 11:17:06 +0800 <C0nservativeGal> It’s ironic that Bidens now making speeches on prosecuting rioters and looters after his peeps were donating $$$ to get those fools out of prison.
