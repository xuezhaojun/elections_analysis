1341899256848818176 2020-12-24 08:11:28 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> My mother used to make these for us when we were kids. This has brought back so many memories. Thank you for posting.
1341896631357038592 2020-12-24 08:01:02 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I find doing crochet very relaxing. You can do it while watching TV and it gives you a sense of accomplishment that you created something.
1341896013351555072 2020-12-24 07:58:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> If you are worried about your age and adopting a dog just adopt an older dog. Sometimes people bring their old pets to the SPCA because they can no longer care for them. They will love you for it.
1341894275466838017 2020-12-24 07:51:41 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yeah! It's funny how that happens, isn't it?
1341893773438066692 2020-12-24 07:49:41 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> This is where I am at with my grown children. I have had enough of the nonsense. I am just sad that I raised such selfish children. I feel for you. Hang in there.
1341835675935522818 2020-12-24 03:58:49 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> @JeffreyLuscombe I have Graves Disease so I know a lot about the problems that can happen with a malfunctioning Thyroid. One of the most frustrating thing about this disease is that people don't think you are sick because they can't see that you are suffering.
1341832849016549376 2020-12-24 03:47:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am happy that you have no sign of the disease. One thing that I noticed this year was how creative people came up with ways to cope or deal with Covid. It forced some of us to figure out ways to cope with this situation in many different ways. Have a great Christmas.

1340400355427774464 2020-12-20 04:55:22 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, I have. More than once.

1340070697205284867 2020-12-19 07:05:26 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Me too. It has to be the extra hair I am carrying around.
1339634038936518657 2020-12-18 02:10:18 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yeah! Me too. He is also a Republican. I used to like me but not anymore.
1337598360249745408 2020-12-12 11:21:15 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Sounds really tasty. I like dark rum. Thank you for responding.
1337597566192476160 2020-12-12 11:18:05 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Have you got a recipe for that? Please.
1337496268017291264 2020-12-12 04:35:34 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It was a raid. There was no need for all that firepower they showed up with at her house. It's called intimidation. That's what they do in a dictatorship.
1335735405312790528 2020-12-07 07:58:32 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I miss going out to eat at a restaurant. I would like to eat someone else's cooking for a change.
1335733979664711680 2020-12-07 07:52:52 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Me too. This is not a dating site. Geez!
1335732857621291012 2020-12-07 07:48:24 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I, too, don't believe Trump ever had Covid in the first place. I agree that they are most likely saying this because they want him out of the way for a bit.
1335071907964616706 2020-12-05 12:02:01 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I love it. It's beautiful.

1331342196499382272 2020-11-25 05:01:29 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Why bother joining Parler and have to torture yourself listening to these idiots talking nonsense? Save yourself the aggravation.
1330994800611401729 2020-11-24 06:01:03 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, well, cry me a river, Ivanka.
1330989909717315585 2020-11-24 05:41:37 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Why are 3 million Americans traveling this Thanksgiving? Is stupidity a disease now or what?

1329591991345135616 2020-11-20 09:06:48 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I like to give credit where it's due. You, Chica, brighten people's live in these difficult times so thank you very much.
1329589089532743680 2020-11-20 08:55:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you, Mayra, for cheering me up.♥️
1329584524204732416 2020-11-20 08:37:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Trump does not like it when people say "NO" to him. I think that comes from never being disciplined or suffer consequences when he didn't listen to his parents. His responses to any conflict always look like the temper tantrum of a little kid.
1329271737964326913 2020-11-19 11:54:13 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You are amazing.
1329269170907738112 2020-11-19 11:44:01 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> We all have our bad days. Do something for yourself that makes you happy. I find that listening to upbeat music and dancing helps me when I am feeling depressed.♥️  https://t.co/1iRiYELIdO
1328800693172531200 2020-11-18 04:42:27 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Emily, sign the papers. You seem to forget that you work for all the country not just Trump's country. Do your fucking job. @GSAEmily #SignThePapers
1328789170022735880 2020-11-18 03:56:40 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am really not a fan of beards. My husband has one and I hate it, but it's his face so I live with it.
1328785332700065795 2020-11-18 03:41:25 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Danielle, I hear you and I am sending you some good vibes. You are not alone.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
1328456391347023874 2020-11-17 05:54:19 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> He certainly did and after all of those attempts, he still couldn't win. Looks good on him.
1328450698036572161 2020-11-17 05:31:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Trump is not mentally stable so why is he allowed to make all these decisions before he leaves? Again, why have the 25th Amendment available to you and not use that power when you are dealing with a president who is not living in reality at the moment.
1328075427747823617 2020-11-16 04:40:31 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Hey, Emily, do your job. @GSAEmily

1328057616967159808 2020-11-16 03:29:44 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> If you know someone who is suffering from depression please never say: "Snap out of it". Instead, please educate yourself about depression so you can help the person who is suffering.
1327687802075578368 2020-11-15 03:00:13 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> More idiots.

1326720513243189248 2020-11-12 10:56:34 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Harvey, Fox News is not banned in Canada as we can watch it here on our TV if we choose to do so (And we don't). It is available in BC.
1326718889678442496 2020-11-12 10:50:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Ah ah good one, Don.
1326718202911494144 2020-11-12 10:47:23 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> @realDonaldTrump Trump, will you just man up already. You lost. Deal with it. You look like a fool to the rest of the world with your childish behavior. MAN UP!
1325944958759526401 2020-11-10 07:34:47 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Emily, do your job and sign that letter already. @GSAEmily
1325226732991909888 2020-11-08 08:00:49 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I agree with that too. Just ignore him. He hates that.
1325226210763317248 2020-11-08 07:58:44 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> That's a hard choice, my friend.  I choose the middle one.
1325185369512407042 2020-11-08 05:16:27 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Paul, we are celebrating here in Canada. It feels like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I am overjoyed that you now have a president who cares about humanity.♥️♥️
1325184724696924162 2020-11-08 05:13:53 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I couldn't vote but I fought hard for you my American friends. The day he put children in cages is when I got mad and I was determined that I would do whatever to stop this president.♥️
1325184280608210944 2020-11-08 05:12:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It feels like we just ended a war.
1325183417214922752 2020-11-08 05:08:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I love this. OH! The irony.
1325182533567279105 2020-11-08 05:05:11 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> AH AH, I guess not. What a bunch of uneducated losers? Can you imagine not believing in science? Where do you think your phone, your computer, the Internet comes from? Idiots.
1325181426807889922 2020-11-08 05:00:47 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> No, It's no.t Have at it. Cheers.
1325179699933319169 2020-11-08 04:53:55 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It's almost 1pm here in Vancouver, BC, but tonight someone is going to be toasting to the removal of your president. Cheers, everyone.
1325177537966735362 2020-11-08 04:45:20 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Let's not forget all that Rachel Maddow has done for America. She is a good and decent human being who fought for America. Thank you so much, Rachel. @maddow

1324801900554805248 2020-11-07 03:52:41 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Some people were talking about what the song should be for Trump's exit. My husband mentioned: "Hit the road Jack" by Ray Charles. I think it's very fitting.
1324798608881803264 2020-11-07 03:39:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yeah, me too. I would love to see that video.
1324598848220614656 2020-11-06 14:25:49 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> He would have to find Bill Barr first.
1324594539026264064 2020-11-06 14:08:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> First, they would have to find Bill Barr. I have not seen him for at least 2 weeks. So, where is he?
1324584458020773890 2020-11-06 13:28:39 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Done. I wish to thank you for all the work that you have done in this election. All the best to you, my friend. Love from Canada.
1324582474018480128 2020-11-06 13:20:46 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you, Stacy, for all you have done in this election.@staceyabrams

1324512497592758272 2020-11-06 08:42:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Actually, I would prefer that he went to prison, but I'm sure that won't happen.
1324470499477315584 2020-11-06 05:55:49 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> This guy should be in jail.
1324464545889353728 2020-11-06 05:32:09 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, my children.
1324439015634857986 2020-11-06 03:50:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Congrats, Tank.♥️
1324438220742955009 2020-11-06 03:47:33 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Where is Barr?
1324434837835378688 2020-11-06 03:34:06 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I don't know about you guys, but I am starting to think that Barr has disappeared because he is sick or why?
1324421312224219138 2020-11-06 02:40:22 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Maybe you don't know this but some of us stash money there. Ooops, I guess I should have kept that a secret.
1324420802037510144 2020-11-06 02:38:20 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you for all you do.  I really enjoy your videos as you always put a smile on my face.♥️♥️
1324415235852177409 2020-11-06 02:16:13 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You are absolutely right, Scapegoat. I have come to the conclusion that people who only listen to Fox News for their news are not very smart.
1324178770207465472 2020-11-05 10:36:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am doing much better than last night. I was so depressed today knowing that there are so many racists people in America who voted for Trump. I don't understand why anyone would vote for Trump.
1324171821004906497 2020-11-05 10:08:58 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Love you, man, because you "Sir" are a real patriot.♥️
1324126660719910912 2020-11-05 07:09:31 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Pot has been legal here in Canada for a bit and NO, people didn't go driving stoned and acting weird. Some people were so worried that chaos was going to happen. I got news for you all, it didn't happen.
1324120813658796032 2020-11-05 06:46:17 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> He is lovely.
1324078609640771584 2020-11-05 03:58:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I think we definitely need a recount for these three Republicans.
1324077436263301120 2020-11-05 03:53:55 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I just read that less than 60,000 people voted for Kanya West. What kind of morons voted for Kanye? This is absolutely ridiculous.
1324075340881260544 2020-11-05 03:45:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> America, how can you call yourself a democracy when you are actually infringing on people's rights time and time again. Just look at how many of you voted again for this mad man. Do you understand how this looks to the rest of the world? Pissed off Canadian.
1324069045906255872 2020-11-05 03:20:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you Mr. Winslow.
1324067690856640512 2020-11-05 03:15:12 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yeah, me too. I am losing faith in humanity. Why would you vote for Trump again, America? Why are so many of you so racists?
1324066442812170242 2020-11-05 03:10:14 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Right now, I am thinking of going for a drive. Anything to cheer me up.
1324063852170936320 2020-11-05 02:59:56 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I call for a recount of this because I can't believe people still voted for her. WTF America.
1324062752369881089 2020-11-05 02:55:34 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Very well said. I totally agree with you. To all Cubans out there I don't understand why you voted for Trump. I am disgusted.
1324060508140437505 2020-11-05 02:46:39 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Sad but you just can't fix stupid.
1324060390121107456 2020-11-05 02:46:11 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I can't believe that this happened either. I think if I was to call for a recount it would be for those guys and McConnell and Graham. I am highly suspicious of those results.
1324059861915557888 2020-11-05 02:44:05 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I just told my husband that one of the things that Biden needs to do if he is elected president is to reform the police department. That would be a step forward in helping to stop all these racists.
1324059485577474048 2020-11-05 02:42:35 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Send pics. AH Ah

1324026319479304192 2020-11-05 00:30:48 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Regardless of who wins the election, I am shocked to see how many people still voted for Trump. I hate to tell you this but this looks really bad to the rest of the world. I am so sad and depressed. America, you need to learn to love thy neighbor regardless of race, etc.
1324025204339699712 2020-11-05 00:26:22 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> So is mine. He feels how stressed how stress my husband and I are feeling right now.
1323884677631934464 2020-11-04 15:07:58 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Nice.
1323884125271453696 2020-11-04 15:05:46 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> America, why are you still voting for Trump? I just don't get it. How can you vote for this monster? Your vote for Trump shows a really ugly side of America right now. It's depressing.
1323867506277117958 2020-11-04 13:59:44 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> America, I can't believe how many of you are still voting for Trump, after all, he has done to your country and it's citizens. Trump is evil. Why are you still supporting him? Sad and depressed in Canada.
1323712787260960775 2020-11-04 03:44:56 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Trump should use campaign songs: "The night they drove old Dixie down" written by Robbie Roberston, a Canadian. My husband mentioned this fact to me this morning. I think this song is very fitting for this election.

1323491042486710273 2020-11-03 13:03:48 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am feeling very stressed. I hope that tomorrow will be the end of Trump's circus. I am looking forward to sanity and common sense.
1323374812534775809 2020-11-03 05:21:57 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I love it, June. It's perfect. And you made me laugh. Thank you.
1323372781917011968 2020-11-03 05:13:52 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I learned a new word today "Jackaloon". It's a nice way to say Jackass. I learn something new every day.
1323371743105359872 2020-11-03 05:09:45 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Jackaloons! I love that word. I hope you don't mind if I start using it myself. And yes Fuck them. Excuse my French.
1323367428882006018 2020-11-03 04:52:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It seems to me that your friend has lost his soul. Sorry.
1323365770521272320 2020-11-03 04:46:01 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> OK, but that should only happen when we are officially done with Covid.
1323359232196927494 2020-11-03 04:20:02 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Well, I am sorry to hear that because I really enjoyed your posting. I wish you all the best and thank you for being a patriot.
1323352011127967744 2020-11-03 03:51:20 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am just plain mentally worn out. I can't stand much more of Trump. My anxiety levels are way too high. Please, American people, vote this crazy-ass president out. I beg you.
1323350661094809600 2020-11-03 03:45:58 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you, Joshua, for your kind words. I love you too.♥️
1323347049497047040 2020-11-03 03:31:37 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Bravo!
1323346883587141632 2020-11-03 03:30:58 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> These people are not Patriots because they have no soul. They don't care about right or wrong. And from what I have observed I find they are not very smart. Yes, I said it.
1323346372226019328 2020-11-03 03:28:56 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I will fly from Canada and borrow a ladder to climb his non-scalable wall. See, it really isn't all that hard to get him out of the WH. Love from Canada.
1323341928717414401 2020-11-03 03:11:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Non-Scalable fence? Really. Ever heard of a ladder?
1323341023561408512 2020-11-03 03:07:41 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It matters to me. I like a president who isn't a monster. Thank you for the reply.♥️
1323339999236874242 2020-11-03 03:03:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Sorry, but that's not good enough. Masks should be mandatory everywhere. My family back East is in the Red Zone because people just won't listen to reason. I see a major lockdown happening real soon.
1323337109306966017 2020-11-03 02:52:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am planning to make a lot of noise out on my balcony if Biden wins by a landslide. If there is a God out there which I don't believe in please, please, do the right thing.
1323336736701784065 2020-11-03 02:50:39 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I thought Trump was for you know: "LAW AND ORDER".
1323336404064088064 2020-11-03 02:49:19 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am trying really hard not to fall into a deep depression. Please, everyone, vote for Biden. Let's end this nightmare so we can go back to sanity, love, kindness, whatever... I can't deal with 4 more years of Trump. Love from Canada.
1323335224034385920 2020-11-03 02:44:38 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> This is Canada speaking: "Please, America, let this shit show be over soon. Get rid of the madman".
1323333782930223104 2020-11-03 02:38:54 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am super anxious today and I am Canadian. I hate your president.
1323007288479608832 2020-11-02 05:01:32 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I very much appreciate all this info. Thank you, Cobra.
1323005230066200576 2020-11-02 04:53:21 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Where is the LAW and ORDER that Trump is always talking about? These people are domestic terrorists. So where is the law?
1323004584000856065 2020-11-02 04:50:47 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> @NicfromO Thanks for that info. I will look that up. My preference at the moment is Pink Kush and Jack Herer. I suffer from chronic pain and this is the only thing that helps me cope my life at the moment.
1322999323261505537 2020-11-02 04:29:53 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Is this an Indica or a Sativa or a hybrid? I have never head of that strain.
1322998603854434304 2020-11-02 04:27:01 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Is this what Trump means when he says "LAW AND ORDER".
1322997649566433281 2020-11-02 04:23:14 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Enough already. Make wearing masks mandatory everywhere. Slap a heavy fine that affects people's wallets. My family back east is in the Red Zone right now because people are too selfish to wear a mask. I hope all of you enjoy another lockdown coming near you. Enough.
1322994396845912064 2020-11-02 04:10:18 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I know sometimes we put our cat's scratching pad outside. He goes wild for that.
1322992054612365313 2020-11-02 04:01:00 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> And where are the cops?
1322989621664309248 2020-11-02 03:51:20 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> No, you're not. I hate guys that start like that. I mean, that's your come on line?
1322616368575905792 2020-11-01 03:08:09 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I read that birds and squirrels and other critters like to eat pumpkin so if you have one you want to get rid of place it in a park. They will love it.
1322255445185081344 2020-10-31 03:13:59 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Are you kidding me? What kind of Canadian are you, Bobby Orr? I am totally disgusted.
1322253237215375360 2020-10-31 03:05:12 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> And fuck you from Canada.
1322252784016662529 2020-10-31 03:03:24 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Are you kidding me, Brett Favre? I can't believe you are voting for Trump. I have lost total respect for you. White, rich guy privilege much?
1322251292190760961 2020-10-31 02:57:28 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You got that right, Adam. The suspense is killing me. I want this Trump circus to be over.
1322249950256746497 2020-10-31 02:52:09 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> This is so stupid. What kind of a moron would like to go on a cruise now? Geez!
1322234602639876096 2020-10-31 01:51:09 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Good one. I wish they would stop with this time thing. It drives me nuts. Just leave it alone already.
1321185387721584640 2020-10-28 04:21:57 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Si, se puede.
1320172781007302656 2020-10-25 09:18:13 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you, all.
1320165651625857025 2020-10-25 08:49:53 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> "The Grey Man" by Mark Greaney.
1320161517203943424 2020-10-25 08:33:27 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I believe these are fake nuns behind him. I mean what kind of a nun we go along with this crap.
1319701689465618439 2020-10-24 02:06:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Oh my! I say "Yes" to that.
1319700307639595008 2020-10-24 02:00:46 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> If you were tickling my feet while I sleep you would get injured. My reflexes are really good and when people want to touch my feet they get a rude awakening.
1319487149209649152 2020-10-23 11:53:45 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Frankly, if you are still undecided about who you are going to be voting for I question your moral compass. I mean, really.
1319477034108682241 2020-10-23 11:13:34 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> She deserves what she got. It is mandatory to wear a mask on transit here in Vancouver. Spitting on someone during a pandemic is criminal. I don't feel sorry for her at all.
1319472936982511617 2020-10-23 10:57:17 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> 100%
1319389132049661952 2020-10-23 05:24:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I want to watch it just to see Trump's mic being mute when he won't shut up.
1319013729195814912 2020-10-22 04:32:33 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It is not just you. Twitter is doing this today. All you have to do is click on tweet and you don't have to put a quote and just click on Tweet. That's all. It's a new thing.
1318971910764425216 2020-10-22 01:46:23 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Thank you very much, Paul.
1318740319609892866 2020-10-21 10:26:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Hey Twitter, I can't re-tweet. What's the deal?@TwitterSupport
1318649149370306560 2020-10-21 04:23:51 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am unable to retweet anything. Anyone else?
1317932167050096640 2020-10-19 04:54:49 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Hey Courtney, you forgot the most important one. KitKat?
1317176871872679936 2020-10-17 02:53:32 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am starting to think that Trump didn't have the virus. That this was BS and a reality show of his own doing. He sure made a rapid recovery.
1316923757915668482 2020-10-16 10:07:45 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Whatever makes you happy.
1316162191922352128 2020-10-14 07:41:34 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I am so sad to hear that Conchata has died. I liked her very much. She seems like a good person and she made me laugh. RIP
1316138138922754049 2020-10-14 06:05:59 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> @JerasIkehorn How about you follow me? I followed you.

1315007723205844993 2020-10-11 03:14:07 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> How much money were they paid to do this?
1315005879205326848 2020-10-11 03:06:47 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Wow! I love it. I am not really into poetry, but this is quite beautiful. May I copy it? Thanks for posting.
1315004907699593216 2020-10-11 03:02:56 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> It's quite simple. They are cowards.
1315004599397302272 2020-10-11 03:01:42 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> How much money did Trump pay these people to show up there?

1313927577900253184 2020-10-08 03:42:00 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes. I sometimes do.

1312857505412775936 2020-10-05 04:49:55 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> WTF?
1312850030978498560 2020-10-05 04:20:13 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Why is Vice-President Pence not in quarantine? He is next in line so what's the deal?

1312163297701982209 2020-10-03 06:51:23 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I just saw Trump walking to the helicopter. He doesn't look that sick.

1311442921795723264 2020-10-01 07:08:52 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> What are the logs for? A bonfire. Marshmallows and weenies.
1311440352088211457 2020-10-01 06:58:39 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I hear you. Everyone tells me I don't look like I am 66 years old. I tell them my body says different. Take care of yourself.

1311384060627808256 2020-10-01 03:14:59 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I blamed Chris Wallace last night for this mess but to be fair who could shut Trump up. So sorry, Mr. Wallace but next debate better be able to shut him up and I don't care how you do it, people. Cut off his microphone or gag him.
1311383552596951043 2020-10-01 03:12:57 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> The debate last night was just awful. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Trump's behavior because that's what he does every day. Talk over people and deflect the conversation.
1311153222879305728 2020-09-30 11:57:43 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Chris Wallace, you had no control over this debate. This was a shit show.
1311028092110950400 2020-09-30 03:40:29 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Not at all.

1310357939316641793 2020-09-28 07:17:32 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You know what they say: "You play with the bull you might get the horn."

1310310246053634049 2020-09-28 04:08:01 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You said it Hairball. Apparently, logic or common sense doesn't enter their minds. Greedy morons.

1306999427224104962 2020-09-19 00:52:00 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I read a lot. That's what keeps me sane these days.

1306676085724033025 2020-09-18 03:27:10 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You are not alone. I am so tired of hearing bad news. I think we need more comedy in our lives right now as the future looks bleak. I am just saying.
1306641116142301189 2020-09-18 01:08:12 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I don't understand why you would hate Obama. Please, explain it to me.
1306639991263490049 2020-09-18 01:03:44 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I don't know about you but when I am depressed exercising is not going to happen.
1306356289576996864 2020-09-17 06:16:25 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, I practice doing that when I was a kid. Another useless skill I have.
1306346732465172480 2020-09-17 05:38:26 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Rat.
1306296124374876160 2020-09-17 02:17:20 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Stop with the lying. It was never ready because Trump doesn't have a clue on how to run a country. Please, STFUP.
1306295720404631553 2020-09-17 02:15:44 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Make sure you give us an update on that. Thank you.

1306083808941207553 2020-09-16 12:13:40 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Fucking idiots. That's what I say.
1306076728138149888 2020-09-16 11:45:32 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Really? How can you still be undecided? Do you live under a rock? Can you not see what Trump has done to this country? I am with you MaskItorCasket.
1305907630053838849 2020-09-16 00:33:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Same here. I am so sick of these selfish people who couldn't care less about spreading the virus to the people around them.
1305907054834450434 2020-09-16 00:31:19 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I heard you. And good morning to you too.
1305906572107808769 2020-09-16 00:29:24 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I can't believe that there are so many stupid people in this world. How can you idolize a person who couldn't care one iota what happens to you?

1304931616284786688 2020-09-13 07:55:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Well, you know not everyone is going to put up with Trump's bullshit. Some of us are going to say NO to your leader.
1304651749550993408 2020-09-12 13:23:11 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> So am I. I bet he is never gotten a spanking in his life. I bet no one has ever said no to him, ever.
1304470937245417472 2020-09-12 01:24:41 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I will never, ever, forget that day.💔

1304260098928369665 2020-09-11 11:26:54 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> So, in fact those booing the players are against humanity?
1304245930162487296 2020-09-11 10:30:36 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I know this is hilarious. I don't think he gets what that song is about. I doubt he got permission to use that song. Someone is going to be really mad at him for using it.
1304240588485607425 2020-09-11 10:09:22 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> How dare they play that song. Does he even understand what that song is about?
1304239836409155584 2020-09-11 10:06:23 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Believe me that's a mistake.
1304239612592676864 2020-09-11 10:05:29 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, it is.

1303745704989396993 2020-09-10 01:22:53 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Yes, I know. Sometimes it helps to vent. And I am vetting against your idiot president all the way from Canada. Every day.
1303745032143269888 2020-09-10 01:20:12 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I have to give Brianna Keilar credit. I think more people should watch her because she does a fantastic job of interviewing people and not letting anyhow get away with BS. Check her out.
1303742759413530624 2020-09-10 01:11:10 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I know, right. There is no end to Trump's stupidity.
1303741970930573312 2020-09-10 01:08:02 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> OK, I get that, but it makes me angry that lives could have been saved if Woodward would have spoken about it at that time. I am not naive. I do understand about the ins and out of publishing the book. I am just saying.
1303740158248808449 2020-09-10 01:00:50 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Today, do something that makes you happy.❤️

1303503740968693761 2020-09-09 09:21:24 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I know. I hate that too because it's telling me that summer is over. NOOOOOOOOOOOO

1302653955256627202 2020-09-07 01:04:39 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> My husband. He persisted and made me believe that you can find love the second time around. He is my soulmate.
1302370992409378816 2020-09-06 06:20:16 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Are you kidding me? I can't stop laughing. What a bunch of morons. It defies logic.
1302008260598341632 2020-09-05 06:18:54 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> He was unable to function. What a snake you are, Trump.
1301931857336909824 2020-09-05 01:15:18 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Really, Lindsey, that's the line he crossed? What about all the other lines he crossed and you just stood by him? STFU Traitor.
1301582059987562496 2020-09-04 02:05:19 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> I agree. I am disgusted by it all. Common sense dictates that this is not going to end well.

1301229760903692289 2020-09-03 02:45:25 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> You made my day. Thank you. I was introduced to Whoopie pies when I visited Boston years ago. They are so yummy.

1300922121867022337 2020-09-02 06:22:58 +0800 <LouiseQuoVadis> Watch out or you might get hit by a bag of soup according to Trump. What? I am the only in the world that can see that he is crazy? Are the Republicans not seeing that their master is losing his mind? Really?
