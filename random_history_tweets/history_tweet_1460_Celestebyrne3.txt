1304170812119953409 2020-09-11 05:32:06 +0800 <Celestebyrne3> I think it was in unconscionable to have six campaign rally‘s indoors when he know the virus is transmitted through the air!
1304166043716390913 2020-09-11 05:13:09 +0800 <Celestebyrne3> I will not take the vaccine! I do not trust the government or the president after he lied about the severity of the COVID-19 Virus.

1303811785556885507 2020-09-10 05:45:27 +0800 <Celestebyrne3> I am so angry with these revelations that the president knew, lied and downplayed the pandemic. How many peoples lives have been lost and jobs lost because of his denial and lies? How anyone could even think about voting for him for another term is beyond me! 😥

1301732829877997574 2020-09-04 12:04:26 +0800 <Celestebyrne3> Trump touts Law and Order in his campaign remarks but this is the second day in a row he’s encouraged supporters to vote twice which is illegal. Sounds like he’s telling his supporters to only obey the laws that he likes and disobey the ones he does not like. Go figure!
