1343851095949529088 2020-12-29 17:27:23 +0800 <leahbug56> @EdanClay A stranger giving unsolicited criticism about her looks.  Yeah, women really like that about as much as dick pix.
1343848620337016833 2020-12-29 17:17:33 +0800 <leahbug56> @EdanClay My opinion, treating a woman with genuine respect, focus and friendliness goes much further than a "pretty" comment which lands wrong a lot.
1343748902013591553 2020-12-29 10:41:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @cptnwillie @NhNancie @kingsrush Hopefully the trumplicans can be marginalized and become uninterested in destroying Americans' lives because their BS is stymied. But this starts only if Georgia votes in two Democratic senators.  If not then we can't stop this festering boil on America for generations.

1343740734474768387 2020-12-29 10:08:51 +0800 <leahbug56> @NhNancie @SandyGirl4Him @SonnyVermont @SnakeBadAss It is important to call racism out and not normalize or excuse it.  I didn't mean to downplay the awful scourge of racism.  But I think racism is partly due to the bubbles people live in - the uneducated.
1343740148408836098 2020-12-29 10:06:31 +0800 <leahbug56> @NhNancie @SandyGirl4Him @SonnyVermont @SnakeBadAss Yes - there are still way too many racist pricks, generational and cultural.  Racism is a real disease that needs guardrails up to curtail its insidious nature as we  weed that mindset out.  BLM was a gift this year to help move the ball forward.  Hoping this snowballs.

Those folks don't need to worry what others are dealing with - it does not help them to know. But thanks to the electoral college their votes matter more.
1343737293992034306 2020-12-29 09:55:10 +0800 <leahbug56> @NhNancie @SandyGirl4Him @SonnyVermont @SnakeBadAss I think people are concerned with the activities of their day and don't try to understand what happens beyond their front porch.  National and world news are fluff that they ignore.  It is not that they are stupid but are rather uninterested and thereby undereducated.

The others that are Trumplicans are simply stupid without an ounce of desire to educate themselves about the lies and corruption.  I am hoping the racist breeds are dying off (but not soon enough).

Treat symptoms ... one dose of ibuprofen a day to bring fever down enough to get food in to settle better.  Ask for pain med for a few days if your joints hurt like hell.  Stay hydrated.

To fly in to CLC the planes had to use a 45° angle over power lines to take off and land.  Exciting times.  We worked on shuttle stuff tho so those hop scotch flights were kid stuff.

Someone needs to develop a more realistic portrayal of how capitalism can work in an American democracy.

He wanted 80+% of Americans to get infected.  Assholes one and all in the White House.

1339225132276051969 2020-12-16 23:05:27 +0800 <leahbug56> @NhNancie The good news about Florida, swamps and alligators. Wind tRump up and set him on a path west into south central Florida while in a dementia ridden haze.  🎶🎶"Oh give me a home ... Where the alligators roam"🎶🎶

1339223161930387457 2020-12-16 22:57:38 +0800 <leahbug56> @maggieNYT @PressSec does not get an excuse for lying to Americans from our White House like a soulless nitwit because she is also a mother. McEnany’s salary per year is $183,000, which is the same as Chief of Staff Mark Meadows’ salary. She is an overpriced liar.

Toe cramps that involuntarily bend adjacent toes in opposite directions, calf cramps that pull a muscle which hurts for days afterwards, foot cramps kicked off from barely touching the arch of the sole. Yeah, I know them.

I will be a bit pissed if the Biden/Harris team is deciminating propaganda rather than setting realistic expectations. Sorry to say I see this  happening.

1338747443010301954 2020-12-15 15:27:17 +0800 <leahbug56> @BarbraStreisand I know our founding fathers did not design this government to give one man out of 535 congressmen such total control over this important branch of government. Let us fix this chokehold.
1338746179182616582 2020-12-15 15:22:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @StevenBeschloss @gertch51 But tRump is perpetuating harm ... his evil ways are emboldening other misfits to play mobsters rather than being patriotic Americans. tRump has fostered a total disconnect from compassion and love. This is a bad ripple in any culture.

1338731151498862592 2020-12-15 14:22:33 +0800 <leahbug56> @cptnwillie @PeterFeda I thought so too then I decided, like you, it wasn't even a challenge for me.  Then I drifted further into ... hold on a minute - who is paying &amp; why are they paying?  Then I decided I can't be THAT ugly surely?  It has been a LONG year.  I blame tRump for my toxic reasoning.
1338729576575414272 2020-12-15 14:16:18 +0800 <leahbug56> Mask up and stay 6 ft apart.  Remember to wash hands well (20 seconds with suds) often.  https://t.co/v93FVLew9k

1338675265883557889 2020-12-15 10:40:29 +0800 <leahbug56> @GiovannaNardoz1 That was more than a dry throat ... it was congestion.  Who knows from what and I am not worried.  Biden has real doctors looking after him, not Dr. Candyman, Dr. Press Secretary at Walter Reed or the GI Doc that gave us that insightful first medical report of candidate tRump.

Fox found out quickly when they hired Sarah Palin right after she blew up that presidential ticket.  They canned her pretty quickly.  CNN keeps making repeat mistakes.

Laws, rules, procedures and ethics need to be codified and strengthened to represent the basis of a capitalistic, but compassionate and representative democratic America.

Crede Bailey has been mortally wounded by this virus.  You are EVIL and should slink far away from the view of the public, tRump.  Persona non grata.
1338576631338831875 2020-12-15 04:08:33 +0800 <leahbug56> @kurteichenwald How do we compel others to feel and demonstrate humanity outside of religious doctrine?  My eyes sure have been opened to how little regard others have for the life of anyone but their own.  Education in public schools teaching compassionate behavior?

His only involvement was to be sure as many people died and got infected to cause this to be such a huge mountain to climb before everyone is vaccinated.  He spent taxpayers dollars on stockpiles of two unproven therapeutics rather than sending masks to citizens.

He needs time to shred documents and pardon his criminal friends and kids then resign to be pardoned by Pence.  Why else did Pence try to appear Presidential in a Biden way by jogging to a podium? Practicing for 15 minutes of upcoming fame.

1337415545801551873 2020-12-11 23:14:48 +0800 <leahbug56> @a_westerly Buying property to rent out is a small business for many.  This pandemic has caught them just like restaurant owners/employees and others. Not all landlords are millionaires that can float rents for 6+ months without becoming upside down on their mortgage payments.  Not simple.

1337413491288911872 2020-12-11 23:06:38 +0800 <leahbug56> @cptnwillie Serious question - what remedy do citizens have if congressmen violate their oath of office wrt the constitution?  Can't just be elections so they can commit crimes until then.  Impeach them en masse?
1337412648732913664 2020-12-11 23:03:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @4ever_days Take advil and swill some warm salt water in your mouth.  The salt water helps to leach out infection brewing around the gums that can cause pain.  Tastes bad but do it 4+ times a day.
1337411632893399040 2020-12-11 22:59:15 +0800 <leahbug56> @Kevswatching Do you really want to mimmic tRump's attack on our election system and the tireless efforts of the voters as well as the workers counting the votes?  This suggestion sounds very tRumpian.

1337253832720527360 2020-12-11 12:32:13 +0800 <leahbug56> @JoyAnnReid The USA is behind 50 other countries in infant mortality rates too.

1337095829644079105 2020-12-11 02:04:22 +0800 <leahbug56> 6/ But he doesn’t have the cards. His bluff after ‘the flop’ has been called in court. His ‘turn card’ bluff will be an escalation and his ‘river card’ bluff could be really ugly. But they have to be called.

FOOLS voted for this.

Are you suggesting he not cast a shadow over those nay sayers about managing the pandemic aggressively?  Does he need to couch his remarks to satisfy the midwestern tone police?

1335747372220080128 2020-12-07 08:46:05 +0800 <leahbug56> @meiselasb She is giving Randy Rainbow some strings of words to repeat in choruses.
1335746859688734723 2020-12-07 08:44:02 +0800 <leahbug56> @20jarett24 Maybe good on her knees ... that mouth certainly isn't good for extemporaneously speaking.
1335746381525491712 2020-12-07 08:42:08 +0800 <leahbug56> @meiselasb She is a regular person because she was a waitress and worked in the fields my A$$.
1335746108878893059 2020-12-07 08:41:03 +0800 <leahbug56> @AdamParkhomenko 50 other nations have better infant mortality rates than the USA does.  This is a very important issue that Warnock brought up.
1335745085116387328 2020-12-07 08:36:59 +0800 <leahbug56> @JoyAnnReid Does she have a stick up her a$$ keeping her immobile?
1335744612288389120 2020-12-07 08:35:07 +0800 <leahbug56> @NotHoodlum She is an Afghan Hound.
1335743251769397248 2020-12-07 08:29:42 +0800 <leahbug56> @20jarett24 She sucks.  She spends more time on that hair than she does helping Georgians.
1335742945396404224 2020-12-07 08:28:29 +0800 <leahbug56> @GraceCumings @UncleSaltyJr1 Mine were "good kids" too, relatively speaking.  I was still wondering every week if the kids needed therapy or just slapped up side their head to smack some common sense into their pea brains.  I should have taken the gutter guards out of the alley &amp; let them work things out.
1335738820952793091 2020-12-07 08:12:06 +0800 <leahbug56> @GiovannaNardoz1 I could have guessed that one for you ... LOL.  Procrastination - a birth defect I think.
1335738403409760256 2020-12-07 08:10:26 +0800 <leahbug56> Ohio vs Cleveland State .... had a 40 point run at basketball.  40 uncontested points in a row!  College basketball is a fun sport.

Then enumerate his antics with the Mueller report or his interference with the Flynn and Roger Stone prosecutions.  Discrediting him can be done in 2 minutes.

And having the run of the neighborhood we were free agents outside of school, making our own decisions a lot - not always approved by my mom.
1335731740413923329 2020-12-07 07:43:58 +0800 <leahbug56> @GraceCumings @UncleSaltyJr1 Yep,  mental gymnastics dealing with teenagers ... a tightrope every day.  "Is this just a battle or the war" was a constant dialog I had w/myself. It was exhausting.

1335728116107538434 2020-12-07 07:29:34 +0800 <leahbug56> @UncleSaltyJr1 @GraceCumings Me neither.  I have a strong aversion to unwanted physical contact (my older brother was mean as a snake).  But I sure did get POed at my kids with no help regarding disciplining them from anyone.  My mom had my dad and her mother who would just as soon hit me as look at me.

And I saved their bacon a number of times I should probably not have.

I knew how to take ambien &amp; make it work for me well over 10 years.  F'ing medical profession pisses me off.  Best friend's doctor is an MD, my daughter is an MD but F' doctors!

1335388210441179139 2020-12-06 08:58:54 +0800 <leahbug56> @HGAaronow That is excellent for her.  She is one of those tough older birds.  My 92 yr old mother-in-law has escaped it so far in her assisted living facility.  Only a few employees and just a very few residents not as lucky. They set up a special isolation wing.
1335387295034306560 2020-12-06 08:55:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @SeveralMadmen We parents would take an email, a phone call or two, any words in any form.

1335385222016339969 2020-12-06 08:47:01 +0800 <leahbug56> @HGAaronow I read a few studies that O+ or the RH Factor both have somewhat better chances/outcomes.  Also, Vitamin D was found back in May to be very helpful in warding off bad outcomes.  You can google these if you are interested in finding the actual studies. T'was how I found them.
1335384411009929217 2020-12-06 08:43:48 +0800 <leahbug56> @MsDixieDiva8253 @heyjustme The right edibles help me sleep.  Not all of them - not all indica strains work equally for sleep.  It can cost up to $3/edible to get to sleep for one night.  90 ambien tablets cost me about $1.  $180/edibles vs $1/ambien for 90 days of sleep. F'ing MD's.
1335382881397579777 2020-12-06 08:37:43 +0800 <leahbug56> @HGAaronow Curious what her blood type is and if her vitamin D levels are not low.  These have been found to be relevant in the progression of the virus.

He may be padding the coffers for one of his 3 batshit crazy children to run in 2024.  The tRump brand will be in the toilet though especially after a few more prosecutions. Those are pipedreams by kids.
1335366336906743816 2020-12-06 07:31:59 +0800 <leahbug56> @Julius_Kim Or built their wealth by lying, cheating, bullying and scheming or by stiffing their employees and contractors. In other words, fuck tRump and his like-minded miscreant children.
1335365032524308480 2020-12-06 07:26:48 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan I took one classical guitar class in college.  Loved that exposure which made me appreciate bluegrass music more. If music has content (not just repetition) and something soothing in the sound then I am in.  Heavy metal head banging stuff plus muzak are torturous to endure.
1335360601623760897 2020-12-06 07:09:11 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Country and Bluegrass are kissing cousins.  I did not like ANY country music back then so sort of appalled at that revelation on our first date.  Dolly Parton can sing the phonebook and I would listen.  She's one of our great human beings.
1335359565819490304 2020-12-06 07:05:04 +0800 <leahbug56> @cjspider2020 Hope they don't expect a bus ride home from their event.

That was 46 years ago &amp; still living with that new guy.  At 17 yrs old I had no clue what bluegrass music was until I saw Doc Watson that weekend.

1335355251671642112 2020-12-06 06:47:56 +0800 <leahbug56> @UncleSaltyJr1 I went to a large elementary school in a metropolitan area.  We had to try out to get in the band by humming "My Country Tis of Thee" ... I was told I would not be in the band in 5th grade - sighhhh.  I have a discerning ear but no talent.  Musicians are magicians to me.
1335354145490997254 2020-12-06 06:43:32 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Yep,  I am older now than my Dad was when he died so I understand a lot better now how much he appreciated those stories regardless of his ALS situation. I gobble every word from my offspring.  Have a new daughter-in-law which at times is a fountain of words.  Love her.
1335352538917462017 2020-12-06 06:37:09 +0800 <leahbug56> @kathrynw5 I heard yesterday about a family gathering for 5 to 15 days at their parent's house for the holidays. Driving and flying cross country to do this, with grandchildren.  https://t.co/rIJPryctsu
1335349963140837376 2020-12-06 06:26:55 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan I started writing for someone else in the middle 90's when my Dad was sidelined due to ALS.  Living 1000 miles away, I started sending him faxes about stories of my life with 2 little ones to help fill his days. He knew his way around fax machines - not computers.
1335346789961134082 2020-12-06 06:14:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @UncleSaltyJr1 I am proud to just know someone who has a kid that likes classical music.
1335346213063958535 2020-12-06 06:12:01 +0800 <leahbug56> @OrigamiDad Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg already solved that dilemma.
1335345236286054401 2020-12-06 06:08:08 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Some people were born with a love of words &amp; stories. I have always been a pretender in that world, definitely a left-brained person.  Age and solitude give me more time to formulate perspective and solutions to life, i.e., stories.

Cook a lot (2 cups of dry rice) to keep some in the fridge to heat up in the microwave easily. Two full days of basmati rice seems to right the ship by day 3.

The only thing that begins to drown it out is using earbuds to listen to tv/music.  Read recently that hearing aids can help counter this.  Have no hearing loss or structural problem with the ears - just a high &amp; loud pitch constantly.

1329320804010627073 2020-11-19 15:09:11 +0800 <leahbug56> @DannyZuker tRump is running FROM prosecution not running to be president again.  You think he was a lazy do nothing these past 4 years, imagine how LITTLE we would do the next 4 years.

As a kid I had no idea there was anything called hot sauce.  But we thought all soda pop was called Coke too.

Hopefully he is chosen for the entire world's benefit (to cut McConnell's reach off at the knees) ... but he can move Georgia forward as well.  Georgia is progressive but needs nudging.

I can easily see this happening again ... 73 million people voted for Trump (not just the GOP).  That low hanging fruit will be ripe for the picking from a non-criminal GOP candidate.

I think a mask is an excellent idea in public for a year or more until the rate of infection is slowed from EVERYONE taking the vaccine.  But not everyone will.

I was throwing up literally at the time (migraine) so took for 5 minutes to see his request, happy to delete it, but he blocked me. Nutz.

Meaning 28% of voters and only 1 in 5 Americans voted for him, not half the country.  Stop saying half the country and correct anyone who does.

1327157886250848256 2020-11-13 15:54:32 +0800 <leahbug56> @a_westerly Insomnia for you or the dog?  LOL.  In either case I am the most dysfunctional sleeper I know so have zero useful advice.  My husband falls asleep within 45 seconds from lights out so I know how sleep can work. A combination of RX's &amp; pain affect my sleep.
1327149299227103239 2020-11-13 15:20:24 +0800 <leahbug56> @AmyAThatcher @indyruth1000 TP  - in stock Fucks - out of stock
1327148227666337793 2020-11-13 15:16:09 +0800 <leahbug56> 15/ #14  I am doing what makes me happy. I am responsible for my happiness, and I owe it to myself. Happiness is a choice. You can be happy at any time, just choose to be!
1327148226856824833 2020-11-13 15:16:09 +0800 <leahbug56> 14/ #13  I have learned to live each day as if it's the last. After all, it might be the last.
1327148225921478658 2020-11-13 15:16:08 +0800 <leahbug56> 13/ #12  I have learned that it's better to drop the ego than to break a relationship. My ego will keep me aloof, whereas with relationships I will never be alone.
1327148225153929219 2020-11-13 15:16:08 +0800 <leahbug56> 12/ #11  I am learning not to be embarrassed by my emotions. It’s my emotions that make me human.
1327148224407351298 2020-11-13 15:16:08 +0800 <leahbug56> 11/ #10  I remain cool when someone plays dirty to outrun me in the rat race. I am not a rat &amp; neither am I in any race.
1327148223656583168 2020-11-13 15:16:08 +0800 <leahbug56> 10/ #9  I walk away from people who don't value me. They might not know my worth, but I do.
1327148222847082496 2020-11-13 15:16:08 +0800 <leahbug56> 9/ #8  I have learned not to bother about a crease or a spot on my shirt. Personality speaks louder than appearances.
1327148221873926146 2020-11-13 15:16:07 +0800 <leahbug56> 8/ #7  I give compliments freely &amp; generously. Compliments are a mood enhancer not only for the recipient, but also for me. And a small tip for the recipient of a compliment, never, NEVER turn it down, just say "Thank You"
1327148220997398528 2020-11-13 15:16:07 +0800 <leahbug56> 7/ #6  I have learned not to correct people even when I know they are wrong. The onus of making everyone perfect is not on me. Peace is more precious than perfection.
1327148220070424577 2020-11-13 15:16:07 +0800 <leahbug56> 6/ #5  I stopped telling the elderly that they've already narrated that story many times. The story makes them walk down the memory lane &amp; relive the past.
1327148219198038016 2020-11-13 15:16:07 +0800 <leahbug56> 5/ #4  I pay my waitress a big tip. The extra money might bring a smile to her face. She is toiling much harder for a living than me
1327148218195521537 2020-11-13 15:16:07 +0800 <leahbug56> 4/ #3  I now stopped bargaining with vegetables &amp; fruits vendors. A few pennies more is not going to burn a hole in my pocket but it might help the poor fellow save for his daughter’s school fees.
1327148217386086400 2020-11-13 15:16:06 +0800 <leahbug56> 3/ #2  I just realized that I am not “Atlas”. The world does not rest on my shoulders.
1327148216601677824 2020-11-13 15:16:06 +0800 <leahbug56> 2/ #1  After loving my parents, my siblings, my spouse, my children, my friends, now I have started loving myself.
1327148215758696453 2020-11-13 15:16:06 +0800 <leahbug56> 1/ Someone that crossed 70 years old and is heading to 80 suggests changes in life from what he has learned to date.  This may help young humans better understand older humans
1327141180564525057 2020-11-13 14:48:09 +0800 <leahbug56> @Andy @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs One termers that have contributed to MANY of the 240,000 dead Americans and on the path to very many more deaths - has what?  Are we to weigh feelings with DEATHS?

1327122547297685505 2020-11-13 13:34:06 +0800 <leahbug56> @chrislhayes You ARE the problem here Chris.  Inexcusable including these words in a public statement - "not clear to me that mask-mandates are going to help".  I don't care if the words are couched inside a broader argument.  Inexcusable for someone with a huge audience.

Like childbirth and migraines ... you know the intense pain is temporary until the next episode.  But gotta go through them. Depression same.
1327104990708699136 2020-11-13 12:24:20 +0800 <leahbug56> @FordJohnathan5 Feeling for others can be overwhelming. Throw in a dose of your own predicaments and BOOM. Have to let it wash through, give it time and in due course the good stuff will begin to seep in.

1326376193071984641 2020-11-11 12:08:21 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Just lift up kids and younger adults to help them negotiate life.  Show them humor and acceptance.  These things do not require gadgets, just a loving heart.  Giving a smile and our time when they let us into their world goes a long way.
1326374898542010369 2020-11-11 12:03:13 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan This is a first world problem - all the excesses (info &amp; technologies) at our fingertips to corral into a happy life.  Agree wholeheartedly.  Knowing details of history &amp; current day lives of many others in the world is what makes me feel blessed in life everyday.
1326372392210489352 2020-11-11 11:53:15 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan We cannot turn this spigot off ... technology and information coming like an open fire hose. People have to learn to use these as tools to enhance life.  It takes different education to teach kids to be discerning (teach critical thinking) with all the choices in front of them.
1326371618000658433 2020-11-11 11:50:11 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Kids have access to so much information that they have to assimilate into what is real vs what is not.  What is right vs wrong.  I am a grandparent too. Worked with computers since 1970's so am well aware of the flood of information in our lives.  A new world.  Not bad, just new.

I believe the road to love (no violence) is better education including giving children self-confidence and purpose in life.  With more tools for life then kids will not be as hapless and fall into crime.
1326366350261039104 2020-11-11 11:29:15 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan I don't begrudge anyone for what they negotiate for $$.  But one good thing from this pandemic is placing more emphasis on the importance of "essential" workers.

1326345165875933185 2020-11-11 10:05:04 +0800 <leahbug56> @MuntzStan Education is the way out.  Education of various kinds &amp; to varying groups.  Teach more ethics &amp; social graces because family doesn't cut it for many.  Then more education for the voting citizenry in some magic way they will absorb.  More pay for quality public teachers.

One of my sisters died at 53 yrs old, breast cancer. Her twin had a lump detected then opted for a double masectomy. They found previously undetected cancer in the 2nd breast.

No excuse for pulling a gun on peaceful protestors headed to the mayor's house.  Mayor had done something egregious - publicizing citizens home addresses.  This POS couple need their behavior checked.  F them.

1325512910152617984 2020-11-09 02:57:59 +0800 <leahbug56> @PeteButtigieg I spent 4 years groveling for normalcy with friends in this way, talking of only things that wouldn't ruffle their feathers.  Tried delving in important matters of American democracy but greeted by stone walls.  I am not sure I can/want to reconcile w/family and life long friends

No one gets a hall pass from me for their participation in the destruction of American Democracy &amp; unecessary covid lost lives.
1325491942789091328 2020-11-09 01:34:40 +0800 <leahbug56> @espiers @ElieNYC I have zero empathy for the part of a trump voters' mentality that voted for a mass murdering lazy-assed criminal whose irresponsibility speeds up my date of death. I take it personally because I am on the far right side of the bell curve of good health.

It is when fantasy meets reality that we burn our hands on the stove and learn not to do that.

1324317104422748161 2020-11-05 19:46:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @Mstggc @JoyAnnReid This is news about the voting details as a retrospective but not on the heels of significant reconciliation efforts like BLM has amplified.
1324316646987747330 2020-11-05 19:44:27 +0800 <leahbug56> @Mstggc @JoyAnnReid I wish I were black instead of a boring old white woman ... to enjoy life more.  But I want more white people to love all people.  I just hate the bigotry or seeding of hatred by anyone.  A path to social recovery is not lined with US v THEM rhetoric.  This undoes our baby steps.
1324315710013792257 2020-11-05 19:40:44 +0800 <leahbug56> @BillKristol Really ugly part that Americans in rural America do not see past what is visible from their front porches. Really ugly that these folks are happy to not be educated and vote without knowing who and why. Really ugly that they voted for a mass murderer.

1324313591391158272 2020-11-05 19:32:19 +0800 <leahbug56> @Mstggc @JoyAnnReid What I hear is, our black votes got Joe elected, fuck you white people.  Tell me it is not the sentiment being expressed. I would suggest this is not a healing slant of news reporting now. BLM is making great progress to instilling compassion &amp; change. This reporting not so much.
1324312423457763329 2020-11-05 19:27:40 +0800 <leahbug56> @atrupar @ungerbn103 He would have JaVanka run the country.

1324309398718763011 2020-11-05 19:15:39 +0800 <leahbug56> @Mstggc @JoyAnnReid I came through too. But let us make this white v black just for grins.  Now? While we are trying to heal and grab the common purpose for America? Just not the time with raw nerves all around.
1324308765362061313 2020-11-05 19:13:08 +0800 <leahbug56> @JoyAnnReid Let's keep blowing up black vs white folks.  Nitwits. Does stoking hatred of white people over voting help heal racial  bigotry?  Let's make black people hate white people @JoyAnnReid &amp; @brhodes about election results to see how much that adds to healing racial divide?  FFS.

Not  healing approach at all. You have a higher responsibility as a primetime anchor to do better!  Read the room.

1323927058741895170 2020-11-04 17:56:22 +0800 <leahbug56> @JoyAnnReid The number of American citizens that voted for genocide is VERY disturbing.

1323898914609745920 2020-11-04 16:04:32 +0800 <leahbug56> @Atticus59914029 Yes there are.
1323897920857538563 2020-11-04 16:00:35 +0800 <leahbug56> @meiselasb So, just winning Georgia would put Biden in the White House after it is fumigated.

1323882131953717249 2020-11-04 14:57:51 +0800 <leahbug56> @EdanClay Atlanta has a lot of new and young citizens plus metro Atlanta has a majority of African Americans. Well educated.  Don't despair.  I would say it is more a question of the more rural religious folks' voting proclivities.
1323876386868731906 2020-11-04 14:35:01 +0800 <leahbug56> @mmpadellan They did well ... we will get them next time.
1323874442850820098 2020-11-04 14:27:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @jaketapper WTF is wrong with voters that live along the southern border asking for more draconian ICE raids, kids in cages,  overflowing hospitals, people dying from covid?

Why support anyone who votes for all old people to die and young people to collect pre-existing conditions? Why support regressive social policies rather than love and progress? Do not forget.

Versus their car payments?  How many have filed for unemployment, living off farm subsidies, strapped for cash lime most small businesses? These are not the cream of the crop, most trumpers.

Once inside all guests/burglars were her best friend. Anyone or animal across the threshold was raw meat.  We failed in her training but we kept everyone safe for 12 years until her body gave out.

Go out for extended times in the cold without proper precautions (i live up north) -or- 2. Go to a trump rally and catch covid-19, hypothermia and/or mush-brain from listening to Trump  -then- dumbfuckery has won.

Junior is young enough to live a better life but he is going to do it without his 5 children because he already f'cked that part of the program up.

1315696191380783106 2020-10-13 00:49:51 +0800 <leahbug56> @rudepundit Family values obviously are not what the GOP is known for in 2020. Can Trump even name his grandkids?  Much less does Trump pretend Melania is part of his daily life.  Trump is a cesspool of humanity in every way.

1314782777192128514 2020-10-10 12:20:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @DemocracyInn @richmartin66 I was worried about the millions in Harris County descending on one drop box.  The tow trucks to haul off wrecks quickly would be lined up for miles around a single box.

1314571976690802690 2020-10-09 22:22:37 +0800 <leahbug56> @RealRonHoward This is a good idea.  I voted early already (about a 15 minute line only).  Am too compromised to be around others now.

1314569396845764609 2020-10-09 22:12:22 +0800 <leahbug56> @BarbraStreisand This is what I think Trump has done to us.  Horrible human being and even worse than horrible president.  @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump   https://t.co/PMNTIPAGB0
1314564516701704193 2020-10-09 21:52:58 +0800 <leahbug56> 49/ Think of the evil things (like happily infecting people with covid) that are planned and not even conjured yet that we don't know about.
1314564515502198785 2020-10-09 21:52:58 +0800 <leahbug56> 48/ A vote for Trump or any republican is a vote for the further destruction of America.  Not hyperbole because Trump has demonstrated how far he will go, so far.
1314564514231312384 2020-10-09 21:52:58 +0800 <leahbug56> 47/ A second term gives him free reign to destroy what is left of American democracy. He will have no election to keep him in check a tiny bit. He will quit pandering to the public and cram through all the evil intentions he can accomplish.
1314564512993996801 2020-10-09 21:52:57 +0800 <leahbug56> 46/ Throwing out the concept of checks and balances by the three branches of government 28. Needing one of his kids to babysit him overseas everytime he ventures out of the country Etc, etc, etc. A vote for Trump is a vote for worse than we have experienced as a nation.
1314564511614095366 2020-10-09 21:52:57 +0800 <leahbug56> 45/ Unhealthy relationship with Fox News ... the influence Fox has on our American Democracy is undemocratic. 27. Normalizing the interference in the criminal justice system from the white house 28. Subverting the rule of law to hide lies and schemes 27.
1314564510406111233 2020-10-09 21:52:57 +0800 <leahbug56> 44/ Lack of family values, 5 kids, 3 wives, many extramarital exploits and grandchildren we never see him with nor ever mentions time spent with them. I seriously doubt he can name his grandchildren 25. The man doesn't like dogs or pets. 26.
1314564509219147778 2020-10-09 21:52:57 +0800 <leahbug56> 43/ Packing federal courts with lifetime judges that have unqualified ratings from the American Bar Association and people that have never tried a case in court 22. Incessant public ramblings 23. Lying. Constant lying about very minor and also very significant issues 24.
1314564507902062592 2020-10-09 21:52:56 +0800 <leahbug56> 42/ I know a lot about this technology and believe me, it was not criminal (as the fbi concluded) but rather a case of getting the wrong IT guy for the job. Trump has failed in the mechanics of government resulting in much more serious errors. 20. Devin Nunes 21.
1314564507042304001 2020-10-09 21:52:56 +0800 <leahbug56> 41/ Trump campaign on locking up Hillary Clinton over not using an email server the safest way ... much like Ivanka, Jared, and many in Trump's orbit conducting unsecured classified government work now.
1314564505813299200 2020-10-09 21:52:56 +0800 <leahbug56> 40/ Being fixated on undoing progress that Obama made that pulled us out of the worst financial crisis since the depression from the end of Bush's last term (yeah I know Bill Clinton set some of the house crisis in action) 19.
1314564504861257733 2020-10-09 21:52:56 +0800 <leahbug56> 39/ All against scientific advise in attempts to line pockets of CEOs of pollution causing industries. 17. Rolling back financial regulations that protect citizens, home buyers, small businesses. 18.
1314564503888187393 2020-10-09 21:52:55 +0800 <leahbug56> 38/ Having Jared Kushner responsible for every major foreign and domestic policy initiative ... give me a break. 15. Michael Cohen 16. Environmental regulations rolled back which are hurting our earth, our water and our air.
1314564502877282304 2020-10-09 21:52:55 +0800 <leahbug56> 37/ Trump's obvious kowtowing to Putin (financially or personally compromised?) 13. Nepotism made worse by his opportunitistic and entitled (criminally tainted children who cheated charities among other vile practices) 14.
1314564501862338564 2020-10-09 21:52:55 +0800 <leahbug56> 36/ Trump's complete failure as a manager/business person which is evidenced by the enormance turnover of people in his white house administration 11. Trump's fascination for North Korean and Chinese style military parades to bolster his ego 12.
1314564500897574912 2020-10-09 21:52:55 +0800 <leahbug56> 35/ Trump's lip service in public to veterans while showing disregard and lack of protecting front line soldiers or the top generals commanding the troops 10.
1314564500062900225 2020-10-09 21:52:54 +0800 <leahbug56> 34/ Trump's belligerent personality wrecking havoc with all other world leaders 7. Trump's constant efforts to destroy and cripple NATO 8. Trump paying off porn stars to hide his disgusting behavior to sucker voters 9.
1314564499152818180 2020-10-09 21:52:54 +0800 <leahbug56> 33/ The grifting of Trump taking taxpayer money in his private businesses by hiking prices and forcing secret service and other people needing to be with him to pay his hotels and golf properties, to the tune of $30,000,000+ in these 4 years 5. Trump's lack of work ethic 6.
1314564498326421507 2020-10-09 21:52:54 +0800 <leahbug56> 32/ And I have not even mentioned - 1. The failed covid response 2. The $430,000 personal debt due to be paid by Trump in 2 years 3. The extortion of Ukranian help to help his campaign 4.
1314564497395322881 2020-10-09 21:52:54 +0800 <leahbug56> 31/ This IS the Trump republican party. Insanity is expecting different results with the same people exhibiting established patterns of behavior.  I see that voting for Trump and expecting better and different results is some special kind of insanity.
1314564496527110145 2020-10-09 21:52:54 +0800 <leahbug56> 30/ America is not a police state yet Trump mobilizes the military to control peaceful citizens, using tear gas, rubber bullets, beating citizens with batons and sometimes just so Trump can hold a bible he cannot quote one passage from for a photo opportunity.
1314564495705022464 2020-10-09 21:52:53 +0800 <leahbug56> 29/ We need serious immigration reform but that does not have to include cruel and inhumane behavior which Trump has demonstrated he is fine with.
1314564494509645824 2020-10-09 21:52:53 +0800 <leahbug56> 28/ The GOP is no longer a party of Christian values but rather is a party of locking kids in cages, not prosecuting white racist violence, not caring about the health and welfare of the most vulnerable humans.
1314564493570117632 2020-10-09 21:52:53 +0800 <leahbug56> 27/ All the atheists I know are more reverent about their fellow humans than judgemental religious people are.  Trump is a user and abuser of religion. He is not a loving man except loving himself.
1314564492685193221 2020-10-09 21:52:53 +0800 <leahbug56> 26/ …doctrine.  That is because they knew humans can be moral, just, loving, and civil without being told how to worship or even whether to worship in a religious sense.  The muslims I know are all much more gentle souls than the average self-identifiable Christians.
1314564491833733122 2020-10-09 21:52:52 +0800 <leahbug56> 25/ Trump is very much against anyone different than him, a white Anglo-Saxon with  European heritage (ahemmm Hitler-like).  Our constitution has Christian values embedded in it but specifically says the government must not dictate religion or include any specific religious…
1314564490978103296 2020-10-09 21:52:52 +0800 <leahbug56> 24/ America is a melting pot of cultures, religions, skin colors, workers.  Think are wonderful it is in your own lives when you get the treat of knowing someone unlike yourself and how enriching this has been.
1314564490143371264 2020-10-09 21:52:52 +0800 <leahbug56> 23/ Joe Biden has bags of the right values for America and he surrounds himself with people that believe in science, love, compassion, intelligence, seriously diligent work ethics, enforcing laws, ethics, and the constitution.
1314564489069637632 2020-10-09 21:52:52 +0800 <leahbug56> 22/ Compassion, love, empathy ... traits of which Trump has demonstrated daily that he lacks.
1314564487756775424 2020-10-09 21:52:51 +0800 <leahbug56> 21/ This is what the GOP  is now and this all is on the ballot when you vote for Dobald Trump. Biden has an agenda to raise and stabilize every citizen's life, not just those already more than financially comfortable.
1314564486909620232 2020-10-09 21:52:51 +0800 <leahbug56> 20/ Trump has surrounded himself with opportunistic criminals, many been indicted after close ties to the president.  These are the people Trump admires and relies on, aspires to rub elbows with them and scam Americans together.
1314564485907185665 2020-10-09 21:52:51 +0800 <leahbug56> 19/ Trump was living a similar life of debauchery. He has been and is disgusting even making distasteful sexual comments to boy scouts at a jamboree and to the widow and children of Scalia during a memorial service.  He has no moral compass.
1314564485059932160 2020-10-09 21:52:51 +0800 <leahbug56> 18/ Think of poverty and how overwhelming that is. How many abortions and morning after pills do you think Trump has personally been responsible for considering his very liberal sex exploits from his younger years? Ever watch Mad Men?
1314564484258770944 2020-10-09 21:52:51 +0800 <leahbug56> 17/ Ever gotten in a situation where you were overwhelmed for a period of time to the point of not being able to move forward?
1314564483243704321 2020-10-09 21:52:50 +0800 <leahbug56> 16/ Supporting less fortunate people does not create a society of freeloaders but rather helps people get out of desperate circumstances to be able to improve their own station in life.
1314564482287403009 2020-10-09 21:52:50 +0800 <leahbug56> 15/ Wealthy tax evaders are creating more crime, creating more hunger, creating more homelessness, creating more impoverished children,  creating a healthcare crisis because they are lowering a social safety net to help raise people.
1314564481381523458 2020-10-09 21:52:50 +0800 <leahbug56> 14/ Wealthy people not wanting to pay a share of supporting their communities and set on avoiding taxes are being short sighted by destabilizing society.
1314564480630755331 2020-10-09 21:52:50 +0800 <leahbug56> 13/ Rising waters float all boats, all human lives.  This is not communism/socialism but rather compassionate and social justice.
1314564479590576128 2020-10-09 21:52:50 +0800 <leahbug56> 12/ This has been clear in the wars in the Middle East where young folks without purpose are easily recruited into terrorist organizations. Just as USA white supremacist terrorists were planning to kidnap and harm the Michigan governor at the same time Trump has endorsed them.
1314564477912662018 2020-10-09 21:52:49 +0800 <leahbug56> 11/ Trump is too personally ignorant and cold hearted to develop a healthcare system for the everyday citizens. Without supporting and lifting of every life our society will devolve even more.  This has been clear in the last 4 years in the USA.
1314564476495163398 2020-10-09 21:52:49 +0800 <leahbug56> 10/ Trump has promised a new healthcare plan since 2015 and has yet to produce anything close to the ACA, and has gutted as much as he can from the ACA which has stymied the goals of reforming health insurance.
1314564475614306305 2020-10-09 21:52:49 +0800 <leahbug56> 9/ solid public education many kids stay in poverty and fall into lives of crime, hate and lack of purpose.
1314564474406342656 2020-10-09 21:52:48 +0800 <leahbug56> 8/ …Americans footing the bill for higher cost of goods or  not being able to sell to China.Trump is bad for the US economy. Public education is required to begin to heal the nation.  Without
1314564473072611330 2020-10-09 21:52:48 +0800 <leahbug56> 7/ Jobs have not been created ... check the auto industry, manufacturing, farming, and now with the pandemic jobs not being helped in restaurants, airlines, small businesses, broadway and other theaters, sports, movie houses, etc. Trump's China "tariffs" are being paid by…
1314564472237944842 2020-10-09 21:52:48 +0800 <leahbug56> 6/ Trickle down economics has failed miserably because corporations and CEOs have padded their bank accounts but not expanded their financial support of the low and middle class.
1314564471130664960 2020-10-09 21:52:48 +0800 <leahbug56> 5/ …voters reconcile  voting for a Trump administration seeing how it has corrupted everyone in the party from the top down? He threatens and publicly maligns anyone that does not tow the trump version of reality.
1314564470186835968 2020-10-09 21:52:47 +0800 <leahbug56> 4/ …education to be stripped of funds, uses Christianity as a prop, could care less about abortion except that the issue gets him a few admirers, is encouraging violence and hatred, is uncivil, treats women with blanket disregard, idolizes dictators, etc. How do republican…
1314564469050216450 2020-10-09 21:52:47 +0800 <leahbug56> 3/ He is a juvenile bully, a thug, hateful, impeached, anti-American in many, many ways, has mental health frailities, has increased the national debt significantly, keeps adding to coffers of the top 10% of the wealthy, keeps making poor people more poor, is allowing public…
1314564468144300032 2020-10-09 21:52:47 +0800 <leahbug56> 2/ The thoughts are crisp and discernable. Here goes for those that have more trouble keeping all of these topics in focus at the same time.   Who can pull the lever in the voting booth for this man? Trump is not the GOP of 20 years ago.  He is repugnant and deranged.
1314564467213172736 2020-10-09 21:52:47 +0800 <leahbug56> 1/ Adults can keep multiple thoughts in their head at one time.  When I say negative things about the current Republican party, Trump and his enablers ... my comments are predicated on ALL of this. Not one issue. Plz pardon typos, this was typed out on my phone keypad.

1314501841015705600 2020-10-09 17:43:55 +0800 <leahbug56> @LibertyBritt @gtconway3d Vote! Traditional GOP values are not on this ballot  because Trump has shredded "values."  Trump is also morally bankrupt as a human being.  Remember Reagan's "axis of evil" description of Russia. The axis of evil has been reincarnated as Trump's presidency. GOP=enablers of DJT.

1314385019075538948 2020-10-09 09:59:43 +0800 <leahbug56> @lindyli @CNN Is this because men idolize another man who gets away with "grabbing them by the p◇ssy" and allegedly cheating on his taxes?  Chest thumpers unite.

1314229062303453184 2020-10-08 23:40:00 +0800 <leahbug56> @michaelschweitz A helluva method by the universe to try to eliminate separation anxiety and grief. Inundate us so we let separation and loss become as  insignificant in the scheme of life as daily wearing socks.  Sorry for you mom's loss and your separation.

1314195605179248640 2020-10-08 21:27:03 +0800 <leahbug56> @ElieNYC It might have been too intellectual for trump voters to realize she was explaining a pattern of behavior that is incongruous with being a head of state in a democracy. That the pattern occurred in many facets of governing.  @potus operates more like a mob boss,.
1314194590463909889 2020-10-08 21:23:01 +0800 <leahbug56> @ECMcLaughlin That was the most audacious comment he made all night.

1314193707911049216 2020-10-08 21:19:31 +0800 <leahbug56> @MaryLTrump @VP also made the point that they managed the pandemic well because 210,000 is a lower number than 2,000,000.  A serial killer can use that in court ... "but judge, i could have killed 200 but kept it down to just 20."
1314192861185937409 2020-10-08 21:16:09 +0800 <leahbug56> @danielsogay Trump has also motivated millions to vote that usually consider voting to be a low priority. Mucho Gracious! @potus @realDonaldTrump
1314192255104757760 2020-10-08 21:13:44 +0800 <leahbug56> @ECMcLaughlin The intense extra effort of being a parent during a pandemic - in my mind is easily  twice the effort of raising kids 20 years ago when I thought my kids were preteens.  Parents of school aged kids have my respect and sympathies.

I saw the most qualified vice presidential candidate in decades that is most qualified to be a heartbeat away from the President. I was filled with the hope for a better future around the corner.
1314077544178683904 2020-10-08 13:37:55 +0800 <leahbug56> @Davetepps I just want the people smarter than me to be elected, regardless of age.  Pence and Trump could only be the braintrust of a nursery of baby goats.

1314072987906314240 2020-10-08 13:19:49 +0800 <leahbug56> @BCDreyer I thought she had the perfect tone.  She didn't say, "Hey fuk face, I'm talking. STFU!"  I am afraid I'd have invoked my best impression of an OLD angry black woman. That's why I sit in my living room twiddling my thumbs while she serves the country at the national level.

Statistics show that during recent DEM presidencies that the # of abortions declined. Under the GOP presidencies they increased.  Democrats care more about family planning and women.

He was the q-tip he always is ... just a little dirtier with his lies and rudeness.  Kamala on the other hand demonstrated why she is the only one qualified to be a heartbeat from the presidency.

1314049074602143744 2020-10-08 11:44:47 +0800 <leahbug56> @BillKristol No we can't yet.  What we need to shout loud and clear all night and tomorrow is that Kamala demonstrated she is presidential. She is the only one of the 2 on the debate stage capable of assuming the job.  She is most qualified to be a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.
1314046950937956352 2020-10-08 11:36:21 +0800 <leahbug56> @FordJohnathan5 You are doing a great job of mindfully raising the level of social consciousness and personally caring for Democracy and Americans.  Glad you recovered as much as possible from your episode with Rona.

1314030069623513091 2020-10-08 10:29:16 +0800 <leahbug56> Did Trump rebuild the military by stealing the money from them for the failed "wall?"
1314028483299999747 2020-10-08 10:22:58 +0800 <leahbug56> Can Trump even name his grandchildren?  invoking family for Trump is rich.
1314027687908904960 2020-10-08 10:19:48 +0800 <leahbug56> Could that be a tick on Pence's head? Rocky mountain spotted fever.

And then she has to choose to give the bowling ball away to resume her life or not.

1312477797932167168 2020-10-04 03:41:06 +0800 <leahbug56> @chrislhayes It is like The Three Stooges (Trump, his adult Children of the Corn and his other goons) meet Star Trek (21st century) quests.  Crazy stupidity emanating from all Trump's executive branch.
1312475996071686144 2020-10-04 03:33:56 +0800 <leahbug56> @soledadobrien Wtf? Msnbc, do better. This is a national crisis. Not time for the junior varsity to be sounding so tone deaf.
1312455451032739840 2020-10-04 02:12:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @SchmattCheryl @welladriansays @CBSNews @AndreaChalupa You know Chuck Todd will interview Chris Christie if he recovers. They both will need each other.
1312453098304987137 2020-10-04 02:02:57 +0800 <leahbug56> @RandyRainbow What does her religion say about who should raise all the kids she pops out or adopts? Or is it illegal to ask that question of someone applying for a lifetime appointment to a  high profile job representing all of America?
1312450977866235904 2020-10-04 01:54:31 +0800 <leahbug56> @Catheri08414490 @SessIsBack @Deadpool650 @FordJohnathan5 @politirick71 I have been out 5 times since April - medical visits.  No family or friends other than husband. He (retired) is the hunter/gatherer/sanitizer.  I put the word "abundance" in "abundance of caution." Been there, done that wrt life BC, Before Covid. I figure another year b4 vaccine.

1312444630504333312 2020-10-04 01:29:18 +0800 <leahbug56> @del999444 @RandyRainbow Is this doctor old enough to shave yet?
1312444174088642561 2020-10-04 01:27:29 +0800 <leahbug56> @RandyRainbow Looking into my crystal ball ... 5 Randy Rainbows dressed in scrubs and long white lab coats dancing and singing in a hospital parking lot.
1312443394946293766 2020-10-04 01:24:24 +0800 <leahbug56> @lizoxhorn That is just 23 this week.  Many more have been reported from irresponsible Trump events. Ask the secret service for their covid cases attributable to Trump related travel.
1312439435984662532 2020-10-04 01:08:40 +0800 <leahbug56> @RedloraineV @travisakers Trump, et al, are culpable.
1312438478949412867 2020-10-04 01:04:51 +0800 <leahbug56> @itsJeffTiedrich Zactly.  I think he is busy breathing, coughing, aching, sweating and changing the sheets for one thing or another.   The indignities of being a hospital patient will be huge anger triggers for our cream puff-in-chief.
1312437397632638980 2020-10-04 01:00:34 +0800 <leahbug56> @SessIsBack @Deadpool650 @FordJohnathan5 @politirick71 Voting this year has been the most satisfying by far since the early 1970's.  I cannot wait for Joe and Kamala to start righting the wrongs and enshrining more democracy guardrails in our American laws.
1312435713770618881 2020-10-04 00:53:52 +0800 <leahbug56> @Bluesutherner @cecomp @tedlieu @smartdissent @WhiteHouse Yes, those symptoms started mid-March, left me mid-June.  Was in California from mid-Feb until a week into April.
1312433987650977798 2020-10-04 00:47:01 +0800 <leahbug56> @ungerbn103 @DanRather Hell, that stupid pumpkin doesn't even know when he is lying.  Dementia doesn't play well for a lying blowhard. Chaos ensues.     Please call in the grownup varsity squad. @POTUS @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer
1312432370117640197 2020-10-04 00:40:35 +0800 <leahbug56> @ElieNYC The debate is making more sense. Rabid debate preppers Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani trained Trump to act as crazy as he did. Perhaps the kids and Melania knew DJT was sick which gave them all the resting bitch faces they sported throughout the debate. Dreaming of wills.
1312430041121337345 2020-10-04 00:31:20 +0800 <leahbug56> @chrislhayes The people at that event knew Trump is a dumb criminal and chose to give him money anyway.  They knew how irresponsible Trump is and chose to be maskless around the presidential entourage.
1312426106541178880 2020-10-04 00:15:42 +0800 <leahbug56> @TheRickyDavila Welcome into your exciting 33rd year of life.  Celebrate.

1312418160876883968 2020-10-03 23:44:07 +0800 <leahbug56> @Bluesutherner @cecomp @tedlieu @smartdissent @WhiteHouse I was told for covid-19 that low grade was 100.4°F and below. Daily temp spikes and lowish pulse ox readings with coughing for over 3 months (plus a rash) for me.  https://t.co/UZRA7xOlU8
1312414420799229952 2020-10-03 23:29:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @DrBiden @SessIsBack Amen. Cannot wait for you and Joe to be our new First Family.  Thank you both for offering your service to help heal this great country of ours. What a gift you two are. Stay true to yourselves.  @DrBiden @JoeBiden
1312413162856214530 2020-10-03 23:24:16 +0800 <leahbug56> @kathrynw5 I will take any help someone offers this bag lady in getting through doors. And yes, I always try to do the same to help others have an easier time through the door. Why be ungracious about doors?
1312411046821400577 2020-10-03 23:15:51 +0800 <leahbug56> @AdamParkhomenko When you are laid up in the hospital with respiratory distress plus a myriad of other symptoms, you are not idly lolligagging about with time to kill on twitter.  You are trying like hell to be chill and control the coughing and breathing to stay the F off a ventilator.

Ecstatic that I got that done yesterday. Doing a lot better than a lot of people and not as well as others. So I am better than fine. Just cruisin'.
1312401676603711488 2020-10-03 22:38:37 +0800 <leahbug56> @KatiePhang God is just toying with them now. Drop a GOP pinball in the slot and release the slingshot then smack the crap out of them with the levers.  Herd mentality ... let us see how many moo after their experiences.
1312400874409517057 2020-10-03 22:35:26 +0800 <leahbug56> @HardballChris Done! Voted in-person yesterday.
1312400709497823232 2020-10-03 22:34:47 +0800 <leahbug56> @MollyJongFast Nfw, he has been a monster.
1312400381419368448 2020-10-03 22:33:28 +0800 <leahbug56> @Deadpool650 @FordJohnathan5 @politirick71 I had a pulse ox sat in the low 70% range with double pneumonia as I was wheeled into the ER unconscious 10 years ago. This was 5 years after losing 2 of the 5 total lobes due to a thoracotomy.  NEVER been real healthy since.   I know what he is going thru. It is what it is.
1312398675650449409 2020-10-03 22:26:42 +0800 <leahbug56> @FordJohnathan5 I read yesterday that it is a bitch for republicans to take a dose of their own medicine.  Rx = "If you don't cover it you HAVE to keep it."
1312397905676972033 2020-10-03 22:23:38 +0800 <leahbug56> @FordJohnathan5 Too bad any human has to suffer this.

1310846999818887169 2020-09-29 15:40:53 +0800 <leahbug56> @Just__Abigail These 200,000+ deaths in the USA in 7 months represent roughly 10% of all deaths during this same time.  We have public records to show total deaths vs covid related deaths vs pneumonia vs other flu deaths.  200,000 deaths equates to over 2M total deaths in the USA in 7 months.
1310845801225236480 2020-09-29 15:36:08 +0800 <leahbug56> @Just__Abigail That is a false premise.  Over 200,000 people in the USA have died with covid-19 complications.  These were NOT people that were dying anyway &amp; got covid-19 to tip the scales to death.  Very healthy people are also dying of covid-19 and struggling with bad lasting effects.
