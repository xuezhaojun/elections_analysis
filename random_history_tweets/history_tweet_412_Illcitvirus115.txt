1330892515810156545 2020-11-23 23:14:37 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> excess and complacency. Better for both companies to cut their losses with Nomura in a reboot which takes into account #FullForceSupport in the form of editors, more Disney characters and actors, worlds with actual NPCs and composers.
1330892514040090625 2020-11-23 23:14:36 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> And by that, you mean stretching the story EVEN FURTHER beyond it‚Äôs logical conclusion and throw ideas and characters at the wall to see what sticks but it won‚Äôt work. It never has! And the franchise suffers for it. From Disney‚Äôs greed and neglect, Square Enix‚Äôs

1326423373770010624 2020-11-11 15:15:50 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> You helped elect one. Have you no shame? The man helped start a war and cultivated a system SO BROKEN that a man like Trump could get elected. HAVE YOU NO THOUGHTS IN YOUR FUCKING BRAIN-PAN?!
1326422299348791297 2020-11-11 15:11:34 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister It was never there
1326305773375418369 2020-11-11 07:28:32 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden confessed that his cabinet will be filled with Wall Street ghouls, he is currently undergoing significant and severe cognitive and physical decline. Never forget, never forgive NEVER support. He will not even be nudged an inch to the Left to help our country or Earth.
1326305772020641800 2020-11-11 07:28:32 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden supported the Wall Street Bailout, and the anti-gay DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act). Joe Biden opposes legalized marijuana, he opposes #Medicare4All, a wealth tax, free college, a living wage and against canceling student loan debt.
1326305770703556609 2020-11-11 07:28:31 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden supported the repeal of Glass-Steagall, which ushered in the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession, making it virtually legal for investors to gamble with taxpayers‚Äô money. Joe Biden IS a segregationist, a plagiarist, he supported the War on Drugs.
1326305769436950530 2020-11-11 07:28:31 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden supported the Patriot Act, which takes away American citizens‚Äô protection from unreasonable search and seizure. He supported TPP should would also devastate the working class and allow corporations to sue for loss of expected future profits.
1326305768178667520 2020-11-11 07:28:31 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> ..that he voted for this monstrosity called the Iraq war. He supported NAFTA and paranormal trade relations with China, and supported numerous outsourcing deals which crippled the American working class and elevates the elites and corporations.
1326305766920368130 2020-11-11 07:28:31 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden supported the Iraq war, which lead to a minimum 200,000 Iraqi civilian deaths with a thousand of our brothers and sisters in uniform dead, costing $7 trillion. So whenever he or his mindless electorates say; ‚ÄúHow we gon‚Äô pay for X Y or Z for the people?‚Äù Never forget..
1326305764894445568 2020-11-11 07:28:30 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Joe Biden is NOT my president and will never BE my president and his voting record indicates he will do a horrible job. This is not to say that I don‚Äôt dislike Donald Trump (which I do) but it‚Äôs important to understand his record to gauge his ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù behavior.
1326298682296311814 2020-11-11 07:00:21 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @HowieHawkins This is the end. You didn‚Äôt stand a chance

1325570258208497671 2020-11-09 06:45:52 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> ...No sane man could ever understand what you just said but I KNOW it‚Äôs an insult to the working class!
1325569903714308098 2020-11-09 06:44:27 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> I wasn‚Äôt sure about it at first, but now it‚Äôs a shameless meme machine.

1324745896463130625 2020-11-07 00:10:08 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> One or two of the countries that didn‚Äôt attack us and let the civilian drone strikes light you on fucking fire too! You bastards! You corporate whores! You thought-marred sacks of BASE FUCKING BUNGLERS!! I‚ÄôM SICK OF YOU!
1324745895506837505 2020-11-07 00:10:08 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> like Obama did while strapping a smily face on it while bodies struck down by homelessness and/or COVID continue piling up on the streets. You and the RNC and your corporate friends and Israel, Saudi Arabia and every puppet state under your thumb should all take a vacation in
1324745894550511618 2020-11-07 00:10:08 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> as a candidate. At the very least, he ripped off the mask of the dying American Empire for the world to see and expose its seedy underbelly without shame. Joe Biden will simply LIE AND LIE AND LIE about our country while escalating war and robbing and spying on the people
1324745893606789120 2020-11-07 00:10:08 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> without flubbing a sentence or seven or breaking his neck on the fucking stairs! I do declare his administration will be so dark, so foul and so cruel to the working class and the rest of the world, (should he even live that long) will create someone FAR worse than Trump
1324745892579151872 2020-11-07 00:10:08 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> and elect a 77-year old Third Grader with severe BRAIN damage who said ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù! YOU ARE INCOMPETENT!! You and the Republicans cultivated a #failedstate of the highest degree! I would not even bet on your golden boy reciting Oath of Office
1324745891547414530 2020-11-07 00:10:07 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> We‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic, we still don‚Äôt have a living wage, we still don‚Äôt have #MedicareForAll, we‚Äôre still bombing eight different countries that didn‚Äôt attack us, we refuse to end the War on Drugs, and YOU DNC LOT decided it would be a could idea to nominate
1324745890490425346 2020-11-07 00:10:07 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Oh this is real nice you guys. I mean it, you did a bang up job. Now we can finally have a representative in the White House that ISN‚ÄôT a whining orange man and everything will be as it was before.... Hallelujah.
1324740900917051397 2020-11-06 23:50:17 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski Because he‚Äôll be dead. How come we haven‚Äôt seen him hold a rally or a conference this week? Is he in terminal condition? Is he dead?
1324740777080201216 2020-11-06 23:49:48 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski Looks a lot like Nuclear Winter this year
1324735683815219200 2020-11-06 23:29:34 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> As I thought
1324735558137139203 2020-11-06 23:29:04 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister Russiagate needs to bite it
1324735410308845570 2020-11-06 23:28:28 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister Yessir Mr. Puddin Pop Handsy Uncle Joe! I feel so much better knowing our lives, the economy, and the world are in your wise, capable hands!...  ...We‚Äôre all gonna die.
1324735083543207938 2020-11-06 23:27:10 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @critic_swedish @PMemeister He promised nothing, son. He ran on Dicky McGeezaks and somehow he succeeded.

1324733546657964033 2020-11-06 23:21:04 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski Trump will delegitimize the Mail-In votes.
1324733374578233344 2020-11-06 23:20:23 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski Wrong again
1324733308836712448 2020-11-06 23:20:07 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski No we‚Äôre not
1324707974187798530 2020-11-06 21:39:27 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KyleKulinski No he won‚Äôt
1324585872415666178 2020-11-06 13:34:16 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister I predict he passes away before all the votes are counted. Not sure if he‚Äôs even talked to someone or held a conference during or after Election Day
1324585365492162560 2020-11-06 13:32:15 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister Revolt by Christmas?

1324384897843212289 2020-11-06 00:15:40 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister A newer, more dangerous candidate than Trump will emerge in a Biden presidency
1324384547778252804 2020-11-06 00:14:16 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister I‚Äôm nervous to know what either will do if they win

1324049639180480515 2020-11-05 02:03:28 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @benwikler @KyleKulinski I see Biden doing an Al Gore and giving up halfway through

1324003514692128772 2020-11-04 23:00:11 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister Unlikely. He‚Äôll pull an Al Gore and drop out before all the votes are counted.

1323984253542113283 2020-11-04 21:43:39 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> ‚ÄúMy boy, this peace is what all true warriors strive for!‚Äù

1323983425217417217 2020-11-04 21:40:21 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @JimSterling Biden will probably forget his running like he forgot his opponent and quit like Al Gore did

1323878469986590720 2020-11-04 14:43:18 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @PMemeister I told them Trump would crush Biden like an ant... and none of them believed me!

1323834685575827456 2020-11-04 11:49:19 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> I voted @HowieHawkins to get us a Green New Deal, Medicare 4 All and give actual change a sporting chance!
1323834684166594561 2020-11-04 11:49:19 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> If Trump wins tonight, it will be an indictment on the American Empire and its failures to serve the people and the world. If Biden wins tonight, it will teach the Democrats all the wrong lessons and stunt any and all progress for the next four years.

1323740913114488832 2020-11-04 05:36:42 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @BenjiSdashG @JimSterling The Democrats subtly removed Medicare 4 All from their platform and their candidate said he‚Äôd veto it ASAP in office. Try again.

1323288107073052673 2020-11-02 23:37:24 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KeithOlbermann Final warning. Tell your bot to stop spamming your videos.
1323283067339972609 2020-11-02 23:17:23 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> Just one more day. Both sides are determined to ruin the country in their unique way. But no matter who wins, we all lose because nothing will fundamentally change. In one more day, the Empire dies.

1323148150689988608 2020-11-02 14:21:16 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @richarddoomed Beats me. Keith Olbermann continues bashing Trump from the right and gets mad at anything and EVERYTHING he does, going so far as to continue citing Russiagate and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúDude, what are you doing with your life?‚Äù
1323147561406996481 2020-11-02 14:18:56 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @AbsurdlySane Keith Olbermann‚Äôs right-flavored rants against Trump were amusing, for a while. Regurgitating Russiagate and bashing Trump without tangible solutions and ridding us of another president like him are a little grating atm. Plus I think he has a bot that shitlosts 4 him 24/7
1323147030479441920 2020-11-02 14:16:49 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @KeithOlbermann ...One that you and the Repub/Dem establishment created with policies exclusively serving the wealthy and agonizing working people who had enough and were willing to roll the dice on Trump.

It was supposed to be a celebration of what makes Disney films and Final Fantasy games good. Instead, all i see now is how BOTH companies start caring and it shows in these games, the worst of both worlds, if you may.
1317215134905847809 2020-10-17 05:25:35 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @EthanaterGamer @PhantomStrider Hmm, that‚Äôs a bit of a paradox. The franchise from that point on was stuck up its own butt with its insane story, things like Final Fantasy cameos done right and BASIC character development aren‚Äôt even considered. The Disney worlds and people feel emptier and emptier.

1317168064023220226 2020-10-17 02:18:32 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> @EthanaterGamer @PhantomStrider ....Surely you jest? The first game, in my humble opinion, feels like an actual goddamned Disney movie with some Final Fantasy in it. It was easy to play and listen to and the story was sane. Every game AFTER, however, has been unforgivably convoluted and CRINGE like FFXIII.

It really puts a damper on Riku and Mickey since last we heard, they were supposed to be powerful and skilled Keyblade Masters. And his voice? The latter-day HJO HORRIFIES me.

But other than that, it‚Äôs business as usual in the Wild Wild East. Emotionless, underdeveloped characters, aggravating character design, story and dialogue that would make Tommy Wiseau blush and Walt Disney Himself cringe. Just a f*#%in‚Äô mess.
1306644145558224898 2020-09-18 01:20:15 +0800 <Illcitvirus115> The magic will NEVER be recaptured without #FullForceSupport in the form of a reboot. Kingdom Hearts has gotten out of hand.
