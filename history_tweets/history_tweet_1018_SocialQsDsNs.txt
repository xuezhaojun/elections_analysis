Picking one or two notorious populists and therefore saying ‚ÄúLook, populism is bad‚Äù is to be ingorant of the bulk of history not to mention totally illogical.  Democracy is populism.

This would go to show how intellectually bankrupt this country is. And imho it would be too late for America. Democracy is evil.

Not very current.   Yestranny got run over. The only reason that 18 yo got first degree is because he had retweeted certain memes.

If that‚Äôs your opinion, you‚Äôre entitled to voting for Biden. A lot of us, regardless of race, want to see us do the self-work as a nation.

You should dig into what is left of conservative forums and podcasts. Many of them denounce Trump for being pro-black, pro-hispanic, pro-diversity, even pro-Jew, etc..  You‚Äôre just playing into the hands of the establishment.

After further review I think he was trying to unleash it.   So I was incorrect in my first analysis unfortunately. Thought there was something else going on we couldn‚Äôt see.

1315121248083484672 2020-10-11 10:45:13 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @_SJPeace_ Lol he‚Äôs hiding behind a bunch of girls after he kicks their dog. And when they retaliate anyway, liberals cry ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù lolololol
1315120216695738368 2020-10-11 10:41:08 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @catturd2 Literally you have two kinds of hispanics.  One kind that likes Trump and doesn‚Äôt put up with bullshit theatrics like Biden kneeling.  And the other that literally hates all white people regardless of whether or not they are kneeling.  The latter group is smaller and all female.

1306805895922290688 2020-09-18 12:02:59 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @NPR There‚Äôs no evidence of systemic racism today in the US.   It‚Äôs wrong to drag children into your cult of self-hate.
1305690541313597441 2020-09-15 10:10:58 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @IanAnde53247754 There‚Äôs evidence of climate change occurring on other bodies in our solar system.   You are pushing a policy crafted by the elite. I used to be in your shoes. I feel for you brother. I know it‚Äôs tough.
1303501184666226688 2020-09-09 09:11:14 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @reaITrump2020 I am worried this is fake but I want the T super bad

1302761054049452032 2020-09-07 08:10:14 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @MinnSean @NPR They literally prop of the myth of white supremacy with this CRT stuff. It‚Äôs very stupid and of course whites are out there peddling it to virtue signal and call themselves ‚Äúcompassionate.‚Äù
1302760383036366848 2020-09-07 08:07:34 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @brother_hanson @NPR Racism against white people is condoned and even encouraged by the left and the elite, because they need to attack the majority in order to stay in power.

I would just advise it‚Äôs a last resort. Keep it to your property.   Although if you‚Äôre not white... then it‚Äôs free game.
1302742000484016129 2020-09-07 06:54:31 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump Many examples of suffering being monetized. War, abortion, trafficking etc. I never met a repub who thinks corrupt police-prison systems are good. I voted Obama twice. We‚Äôve been fed lies to demonize the Right.  The elite control media. If they back you, u r on the wrong side bud
1302737701758615554 2020-09-07 06:37:26 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôve never heard of the daily stormer.  You have no real argument. Yes Slavs in general, so this proves my point further. They actually are white. Maybe you should do some traveling if you can‚Äôt bring yourself to crack a book.
1302638593224003586 2020-09-07 00:03:37 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump As far as slavery never really ending... It has to do with felons and debt.  If there wasn‚Äôt this manufactured war by blue-pill liberal SJW covidiots, plenty of right wingers and conservatives would join in a balanced push for prison and police reform.
1302637405279678467 2020-09-06 23:58:53 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump Dates back to the Islamic slave trade. Before the Venetian slave trade and before the west African slave trade (the only slave trade you have ever been vaguely informed about with mostly misinformation).

1302635172941029376 2020-09-06 23:50:01 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump Everything you‚Äôve been told about NA slavery is a lie. There was never such a term as ‚Äúindentured servitude‚Äù until post 1946.   They did use the word ‚Äúindent‚Äù when documenting runaways but it was never tied to a race.
1302631499712266245 2020-09-06 23:35:25 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @zyxwu1234 @Billy4296 @PoliticsShmoli2 @Talkinghead2017 @DotDotDot_John @realDonaldTrump So Abraham Lincoln was a racist huh.   Tell me honestly what book have you read in your life about history? I‚Äôm guessing you never have...
1302630238623420416 2020-09-06 23:30:25 +0800 <SocialQsDsNs> @RafielResists @JonathanFalcons @realDonaldTrump Actually it would be a good thing but it won‚Äôt happen under 1619. The truth is that the majority of plantation America slaves (bondmen/bondwomen) were whites.  It was only 60 years from 1500 - 1865 that blacks were the majority.   And slavery never really ended.

I would only use a weapon if it were life or death and even then expect to go to prison until the tide changes.
