1343740726602043398 2020-12-29 10:08:49 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> @ClaraBauler Yes, I found lots of innovative stuff on Twitter, but I still think that Facebook has more advantage over Twitter, esp Facebook groups where fb members discuss current research. I’m on a group where members share research published in 2020 that you may not find available online.

1342579172066144258 2020-12-26 05:13:13 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> @NaguibSawiris I feel thankful though. I tested positive for Covid19 after being very ill for 7 days. I spent those 7 days trying hard to finish 3 final assignments, &amp; preparing for a conference proposal with my team and I was thinking that I had severe cold. God is merciful.
1342149902235787264 2020-12-25 00:47:27 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> The worst thing that happens when you have Covid is not the chills, fever or the headaches; it’s the fact that you can’t hug your loved ones, be with them or care for them. That’s so cruel :(. #StayAtHome

1334701097081036801 2020-12-04 11:28:33 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> What’s worse is that they also raised the N400 application fees to $1100 &amp; the application processing takes between 8 to 14 months. I used to help friends with citizenship questions, but it’s getting too hard now. Even applicants will be asked 20 instead of 6 or few questions.
1334294485862330368 2020-12-03 08:32:50 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> It’s so scary and intriguing how AI can dupe people into delusional thinking and mistrusting others. The idea of the thriller is fascinating.

1329150630171119619 2020-11-19 03:52:59 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> I heard from my kids that some of their friends did the survey on behalf of their parents, who don’t speak English, and chose blended learning. Now schools are officially closing tomorrow. What were they thinking? Priorities!!!
1329150626144677892 2020-11-19 03:52:58 +0800 <AmyLinguatech> So what was DOE thinking when they gave parents the choice of blended or remote learning?
