1343422239111319552 2020-12-28 13:03:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> You can for sure trust you California political leaders. They will be honest with you. 😒 #RecallGavin2020    https://t.co/fAxx9DCKwx
1343361424182140928 2020-12-28 09:01:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jennybethm And yet, it probably won’t change a thing. 😒
1343237884099194881 2020-12-28 00:50:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> Discussion Point: I presume a vast majority of retirees are not financially affected by the COVID. If true, why would retirees require a COVID stimulus check from the government? More money should go to unemployment benefits.  I'd appreciate civil comments. Much thanks.
1342196002376228865 2020-12-25 03:50:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ @LAPDNorthHwdDiv Is #Gascon going to let this felon out on no bail also. Such a bummer that you officers of the @LAPDHQ bust your butts trying to keep us safe and the new #LADA and other liberal politicians due their damnedest to protect the criminals. 😢 But thank you folks so much.
1342194924846870528 2020-12-25 03:46:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AnnetteGH86 Seems like everything is woke culture identity. It’s sickening. IMO
1342148413199175683 2020-12-25 00:41:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @dbongino @thornedella Sir, Let's be fair please. You seem to intimate that you have never said "good morning" in the afternoon or visa-versa? I don't like liberal policies or many liberal politicians, but if this was the best you could come up with you need to try harder. IMO. Thank you.
1342142133319434241 2020-12-25 00:16:35 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maasbury @w_terrence You're welcome. I'm not wicked intelligent in this stuff, but I do try. 😀
1342141977677230082 2020-12-25 00:15:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maasbury @w_terrence The point would be, IMO, we don't give up just because some people are trying to negate our vote. I hope you reconsider and still vote. We can't give up that right for anyone!!
1342135193147203584 2020-12-24 23:49:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> Ur Calif. politicians are pushing fear mongering about available ICU beds. See below for fear mongering then see below that for actual information as of 12/23/20. And they only talk about four hospitals. @JenniferHorn  https://t.co/fJXZThyJlE   https://t.co/RyU80alyHq
1342127048236490752 2020-12-24 23:16:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maasbury @w_terrence I disagree. Just because some people attempted voting fraud, and IMO succeeded in some cases, which takes away Ur vote doesn’t mean we should not vote again. By not voting, we R just “giving” them our vote. They win. 😢
1341411262614396930 2020-12-22 23:52:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> @clairecmc Then, as usual, the news coverage is providing the American people misleading information.
1341407598415925250 2020-12-22 23:37:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maasbury @w_terrence Madam: How does "never voting again" accomplish anything? ☹️
1341405661364707331 2020-12-22 23:30:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is the bill (H.R. 1865). U can search on words 2 find what U want. Some people on Twitter R spreading misleading info, so search b4 U comment or believe their posts pls. I myself am not in favor of passing this bill 4 many reason. My opinion only.  https://t.co/6xXCSzkMU0

1341395708683972609 2020-12-22 22:50:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> Many news sources are touting in their headlines the "$900billion" COVID relief bill. It's actually a $2.3trillion. "....Lawmakers tacked on a $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill and thousands of pages of other end-of-session..."  https://t.co/cg7thBCqxk
1341206353348575233 2020-12-22 10:18:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenSanders Sir: Did you vote to approve it?

1341182754768080896 2020-12-22 08:44:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> I can't retweet everything that @tomselliott has posted about what's in this bill, but much of it, IMO, has nothing to do with the COVID or helping the American people. This is why I do not fucking trust almost everyone in the Senate or the House. I hate this crap!!!! 😠
1341181311130562563 2020-12-22 08:38:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @tomselliott What is the title of this bill and where can I find the text of it? Thank you
1341180271975022593 2020-12-22 08:34:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge I use to think AG Barr could be trusted. Sadly, it appears I was mistaken. IMO
1341179993808805888 2020-12-22 08:33:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepArmstrongND You R the only congressman, 2 my knowledge, that has provided via bullet points, at least some of the items in the bill. The American people need 2 know. Please work w/ur fellow @HouseGOP @SenateGOP &amp; provide bullet point of all items in the bill. No one in congress will tell us!
1341177794257014784 2020-12-22 08:24:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepArmstrongND This is the information the American people need. While I presume, there is no choice except to pass this bill, for the American people, I'd greatly appreciate more bullet point info on what ultimately is in the bill. Thank you sir for the six you have thus far provided.

1340721677383155715 2020-12-21 02:12:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> COVID Bill: we have to pass it b4 we know what’s in it(my words).  “It would be virtually impossible for lawmakers to read and fully understand the sprawling legislation before a House vote expected on Monday. Senate action would follow.”   https://t.co/LSaHDvJJjr

1340177850800852995 2020-12-19 14:11:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> I hope you people in New York are trying to get your @NYCMayor and @NYGovCuomo recalled or if nothing else plan to vote them out of office when they are up for re-election. They are literally trying to completely ruin your city. We are trying to @recallgavin2020 here in Calif.
1339265928509280257 2020-12-17 01:47:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @reubing @Maur2009 It's only a game changer if something actually results from it. IMO

It's fine 4 them 2 stand their ground if they've no other responsibilities

1339261239596208128 2020-12-17 01:28:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @thepatriotgirl1 @chadjc1_chad @MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump We get upset when the liberal news media says "source" but we don't seem to get upset when conservative news media says "source." I think Ms. Bartiromo should name the source or her creditability is just as invalid as many conservatives believe the liberal news media is. IMO
1339250290839580672 2020-12-17 00:45:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MikayesFiona @colleenrasmuss IMO, it's only damning if something actually comes out of it. Otherwise, It's just people putting information out there and other people saying it doesn't matter. I truly hope something comes out of of this.
1337459294455750657 2020-12-12 02:08:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @nypost I completely support this bill. While I'm extremely doubtful it will even make it to the floor, I applaud @TulsiGabbard &amp; @RepMullin This, IMO, has nothing to do with "transgender issues" It has to do with fairness for women in women's sports.
1337459050879934464 2020-12-12 02:07:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AynRandPaulRyan I completely support this bill.

1337059322648465421 2020-12-10 23:39:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 Yup. I did
1336828053943693314 2020-12-10 08:20:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adam4d This is so freaking wrong!!!!!😕
1336811048863748096 2020-12-10 07:12:45 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ These freaking people R roaming around because our liberal politicians who were voted into office have reduced theft of anything under $950 to a misdemeanor &amp; now the LADA will not be prosecuting many more crimes. This is what the majority of voter asked 4. Props 47 &amp; 57. STUPID
1336798426470608896 2020-12-10 06:22:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 You will notice I said “I believe..”
1336789784954425347 2020-12-10 05:48:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge @carterwpage I “believe” this guy is the scapegoat for all the other people who have done wrong and the deep state is hoping with one conviction, everyone will forget everyone else. 😏

They R destroying our country. I believe people who refuse 2 admit this R ignorant of the fact or just don't care. It must stop!!!!

1336096958105214979 2020-12-08 07:55:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RealCandaceO @AOC @IlhanMN What good does it do to post this stuff. This has been happening for over two years. Her supporters don’t give a rat’s a$$ about this &amp; conservative politicians won’t do a dam thing about it. It’s depressing has hell. 😡
1336064877270589440 2020-12-08 05:47:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> IMO - To the citizens of LA County: This is what U voted for. I hope you’re happy.

1334320542388772866 2020-12-03 10:16:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TheEconomist My opinion is that no woman who identifies as a man should be able to play on a men’s sports team and no man who identifies as a woman should be able to play on a woman’s team. If they want to plays sports, then create separate teams. Again... my opinion. Thank you.

1334270565939433472 2020-12-03 06:57:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @michaelgitter @cookwjennifer Michael: did guy read all the other posts, especially the ones forwarded that were from the restaurant itself? There is much more to this story than just the original story from @newyorkpost - Red Hook Seafood is getting a bad rap on this.

1334260254880612352 2020-12-03 06:16:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AOECOIN @BrownCamel52 William Barr “was” a member of Dominion Energy and resigned when he was confined as U.S Attorney General. Why do you fined it necessary to try to flame false information? Dominion Energy is not the same as Dominion Voting.    https://t.co/lJAsgd0QrT
1333850287266693120 2020-12-02 03:07:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal I personally don't believe they care about the elderly at all. That is just my opinion.

1333846770095255553 2020-12-02 02:53:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> So what???????
1333846502767091712 2020-12-02 02:52:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @margretmagd @RyanAFournier That makes sense to me.
1333846168988598272 2020-12-02 02:51:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal I did a quick search &amp; found student failures have increased drastically as reported in VA. IMO, this will affect an entire generation of students and be devastating to our country. Specifically to the lower socially economic sections of our country.  https://t.co/s3rOSfO9eR

"These days there's dudes gettin' facials Manicured, waxed and botoxed With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands.... "I don't highlight my hair, I've still got a pair, yeah honey, I'm still a guy."
1332832755747594241 2020-11-29 07:44:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JennPellegrino Glad 2 C we R finally getting some ratings information. I’ve been a fan since end of 2013. Love the format which has continued to improve over the years. Love that @OANN also covers “world” news which doesn’t seem to happen with other cable news. Keep up the great work &amp; thanks
1332786455408676865 2020-11-29 04:40:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CharlesSawyer7 I would agree. IMO, his wounds will heal. I would doubt the wounds of the child ever will.

1331375759428968449 2020-11-25 07:14:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> IMO every single restaurant owner and patron in California should sign the petition at  https://t.co/3owTxi3HBH to start to get him out of office and you should also vote all these dictorial liberal politicians out of office. They are killing our state!!!   https://t.co/MVXJ2OYwNS
1330976474476781568 2020-11-24 04:48:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 sure. possible. So, then maybe we should be more like China?

1329826052173045763 2020-11-21 00:36:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 Good point. I stand corrected. But at least you "seem" to admit that ABC is liberal media. :-)
1329678449309573122 2020-11-20 14:50:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Yisthequest_ion He fought the media as much as he could. Very much more than any other politician.

1329677834001002497 2020-11-20 14:47:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Yisthequest_ion I concur. Trump should have been more presidential. I’ve said that periodically over the years.
1329677613808365568 2020-11-20 14:47:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Yisthequest_ion Regarding the riots, the president can only do so much. We have State’s rights. Getting fed govt involved is exactly what dictators do.

1329627538289688577 2020-11-20 11:28:03 +0800 <roncarlson1> @l0hj028 Actually Tracey it was both Democrats and Republicans. It’s virtually all politicians that are “do as I say, not as I do.” 😏
1329619804433608706 2020-11-20 10:57:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @chuckwoolery What difference does it make. They were elected already. This is old news and it’s never published on liberal media. 😡
1329619528884629506 2020-11-20 10:56:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @seanhannity @linklee1 As opposed to doing a zoom conference?????😡  Basic political way of doing things. Tell the citizens they have to quarantine it politicians can travel to exotic places for meetings. 😡
1329532994869022720 2020-11-20 05:12:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> Probably won’t see this on the majority or news outlets and I kind of think a vast majority of liberals will say “where’s the proof?”

1329484231374823424 2020-11-20 01:58:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepVernonJones @newsmax @OANN very sadly, the people who watch @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews and other liberal leaning news organizations do not watch conservative news orgs so they will never see this information. This is suppression of news to the American Citizens, IMO.

It’s the organization that I have problems with and it is “my belief” the organization couldn’t care less about the majority of blacks in our country.
1328522638268923905 2020-11-17 10:17:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 People say Trump divided the country and Trump is the reason for so much hatred. It is the left and their radical supporters who are spewing hate at many conservatives. Where do you see conservatives rioting and burning and looting?
1328522221086593025 2020-11-17 10:15:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 Question: if, per chance, it is proven there was widespread fraud, would you believe the proof?

1328521706860810240 2020-11-17 10:13:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 1of 2: Whether I provided proof or not you wouldn’t agree with it because you would question the sources. But it’s strange you don’t find it odd that none of the liberal sources ever publish anything about it.

And you’re right. I may never find proof but I’m not naive but I do believe it happens and affects elections.
1326272353005826052 2020-11-11 05:15:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 Yes. You're right. I can't find anything on Google supporting voter fraud. Thank you.

The liberal media will say "no" &amp; conservative media will say "yes." People harp on word "Widespread."  If there's serious doubt in the validity of ballots, I truly believe they shud B investigated &amp; maybe redo vote.

I searched the internet &amp; I couldn't find any info on 9.7 mission votes in California. Would you happen to have a source?
1324514449785417730 2020-11-06 08:50:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie @RudyGiuliani @pnjaban Actually that is not true. I vote conservative down the line. I contribute to conservative Pols in Calif when I can. I send emails to my representatives voicing my concerns, but they go nowhere because all happen to be Liberal. What else should I do?
1324513508726251520 2020-11-06 08:46:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @alexmjordan @PG_46 If this holds then Biden would win, correct?
1324512715142950912 2020-11-06 08:43:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie @RudyGiuliani @pnjaban I concur but I think ultimately our vote counts in Calif. At least we got some of the props shot down &amp; we got 22 approved. As far as politicians go, there's way too much of a blue wall in the state that 4 the time being our votes 4 politicians don't matter. Maybe someday.

1323866255615352832 2020-11-04 13:54:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump Please be cordial when you give your speech tonight. There is no reason at all to be aggressive. Thank you sir. @GOPChairwoman

1323815733759938560 2020-11-04 10:34:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> @derrfe @FoxNews @OANN Well, IMO it’s horrible coverage by both @FoxNews and @OANN when they ✅ the person with less percentage of the votes. 😏
1323814511652950016 2020-11-04 10:29:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why does @FoxNews &amp; @OANN show Trump with 54% and Biden with 43.8% in Rhode Island but they have a ✅ next to Biden. Same in Virginia. What am I missing? Anyone please!!!

1323726786413277184 2020-11-04 04:40:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Mommie_03 Sadly, with the internet, we really don't know what information we see is real and what isn't. My personal opinion is I'm not going to believe anything until the 4th estate makes their announcements. That said, if they numbers you posted here are correct, that is a good sign. :-)
1323725732242055168 2020-11-04 04:36:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Mommie_03 I don't think you will see any "results" until either 5pm PST or 8pm PST. I believe the policy is results are not announced so that they don't affect states whose polls have yet to close.
1323676801764261888 2020-11-04 01:21:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @clairecmc @jomalleydillon Ms. McCaskill - Are you aware that a woman @GOPChairwoman was in charge of @realDonaldTrump campaign?
1323675787946418177 2020-11-04 01:17:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler Ms. Wheeler - Do you have any way of determining who is voting in this poll? Conservatives or Liberals?  I actually hope President Trump wins but I clicked Biden because I didn't want to jinx President Trump. Thank you.

1323457583705849858 2020-11-03 10:50:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> I’m laughing at @realDonaldTrump ‘s comments at his Kenosha rally!!!! Loving it!! I pray he wins. But if by chance he doesn’t win, I will accept that and I will not riot in the streets.

Actions like this make it hard 4 women who actually are raped, to be believe. :-(
1322206840269070336 2020-10-31 00:00:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump did it before the virus and he'll continue it if reelected. I believe the #HarrisBiden administration will decimate these black owned businesses.

Or is Ur hatred 4 conservatives so consuming U accept anything that #JoeBiden &amp; his family does? Criticize Trump is fine but 2 ignore Biden in the process is wrong.

1320877612965638144 2020-10-27 07:58:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> All the Democrats coming to the floor to vote are physically giving a “thumbs down” indication as opposed to saying “nay” or “no.”

I may not B seeing all the news but I don't recall conservative companies, contractors, employers saying they will not work with people who have liberal political views.

1320466427778797568 2020-10-26 04:45:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> For eight years Obama / Biden were not able to accomplish this. @realDonaldTrump has done this in less than four years!!!

1320381120781807623 2020-10-25 23:06:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @darksecretplace All of this is happening due to the horrible liberal policies of California politicians.

1320378237831110656 2020-10-25 22:54:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> IMO one of the major issues affecting California’s demise is its horrible tax business climate. Taxes taxes taxes are driving many businesses out. How do politicians not see this? Vote “no” on all props except 20 &amp; 22. &amp; vote Democrats out of office.    https://t.co/d4LfQlbU44
1320153199181901824 2020-10-25 08:00:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @gottogetin @ShellenbergerMD Because the areas that have been burned need to grow back. We need the trees.
1320147743847796738 2020-10-25 07:38:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> The thing I fear is, her followers hear this and may be believing it because she has said it. I have to wonder how many actually check it out?

1320146145977364480 2020-10-25 07:32:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is just one of the multiple reasons we must get rid of #GavinNewsom and vote the liberal California politicians out of office. It’s not an impossible task. @CAGOP

1319468769014542339 2020-10-23 10:40:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @tracybeanz Trump’s people already tweeted it.
1319464954550865922 2020-10-23 10:25:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> I predict- Liberal Media will say Biden won big time, Conservative Media will say Trump won big time. Mark my words. 😬👍🏻
1319460556844138496 2020-10-23 10:08:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> Did Biden just throw Obama under the bus regarding immigration? “...I wasn’t President, I was the Vice President “

And they won’t show when he used one hand. These people are so freaking phony and bias. It’s sickening. We are screwed if he doesn’t get re-elected and we don’t keep at least the senate. I’m very concerned.

1319317322511704069 2020-10-23 00:38:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @EizeShtuyot I am willing to wager, if republicans happen to win seats in California after the "first round" of ballots, things will change after day 17. 😡
1319312215728558080 2020-10-23 00:18:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @EizeShtuyot I have been against early voting from the getgo. And it gets earlier and earlier every year. It's horrible. I am very open for a national holiday on Election Day.

Question 2 Biden: "What flavor ice cream did U get." Question 2 Harris: "Do U need 2 win NC 2 win election?" They must be asked real questions.
1318970578242469889 2020-10-22 01:41:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> I'm wondering how long the California business owners, large and small, are going to continue to put up with the liberal politicians in California.

1318765693257478145 2020-10-21 12:06:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeBiden It seems right now the only people coming together are the DNC, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and other liberal media doing their best to squelch the story of your son, you and China. Why won’t you answer questions sir???

We have seen proof positive that news media conduct interviews with Trump hard and with Biden as soft. Let’s see the unedited interview.  https://t.co/EZ9MHX8GpZ
1318697479848669184 2020-10-21 07:35:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> What liberal media, @Twitter @Facebook @GStephanopoulos and others like him are doing is what places like Russia &amp; China do. They suppress bad news about their chosen politicians. This will be worse under a #Biden presidency.
1318688518781112321 2020-10-21 07:00:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenBrianJones This happens becuz we give in 2 radical “advocates.” The more we give the more they want. Our conservative politicians need 2 “grow a pair” &amp; say no the “advocates.”  If they destroy something then we must punish them harshly. Vote liberal politicians out of office in California.

1318259810429673472 2020-10-20 02:36:45 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DeclineDocument @zerohedge I believe this. Many do not.
1318220375155744769 2020-10-20 00:00:03 +0800 <roncarlson1> And this is because @twitter is the arm of the liberal party and @twitter is causing #ElectionInterference and getting away with it. Why is this not criminal???
1318219944308473858 2020-10-19 23:58:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> Here you go Chicago. Tax tax tax due to  https://t.co/oNCT1KHiP8 Poor Management of your liberal politicians. Vote them out!!!!   https://t.co/f932rk42zY
1318189178820075521 2020-10-19 21:56:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenJeffMerkley Senator: Would you please opine on #JoeBiden avoiding the paying of taxes also?   https://t.co/vRR1H4KAwV
1318185024252833792 2020-10-19 21:39:35 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jarvimom @Eynlyn Here is another one. People lining up to see #JoeBiden in Durham NC.   https://t.co/dLiu9ppPE8
1318008628641632256 2020-10-19 09:58:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is the flagrant bias of the liberal media. They don’t even hide it. Is this the power you want the liberal media to have against you the American Citizen??
1318008179268046848 2020-10-19 09:56:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @brhodes Are you freakin serious?????  What the hell is wrong with you????
1318007850547912705 2020-10-19 09:55:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jarvimom @Eynlyn 😂😂😂😂
1318005222740905985 2020-10-19 09:45:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> I want to see this happen again in November 2020. #MAGA2020 #MAGA2020KAG  But.... if it doesn’t, I will not riot in the streets or burn down buildings or assault people. I give my word in this.
1318003741904105472 2020-10-19 09:39:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jarvimom And I have this one, from yesterday I think. @Eynlyn
1318001367198257153 2020-10-19 09:29:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @chucktodd is, IMO, a disgrace to journalists.  So wickedly bias he doesn’t even try to hide it. And shame on @NBCNews @MeetThePress for condoning this. Shame shame shame.
1317999958771920896 2020-10-19 09:24:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> Well, here’s my vote sent &amp; received 4 @realDonaldTrump &amp; all my Republicans candidates in California. Hoping against hope we can turn Calif. red or if not that, than at least purple.  My vote “may not” count in Calif but I didn’t stay home. I voted. We MUST all vote!!!  https://t.co/8iDx3NebPK
1317998099277651968 2020-10-19 09:16:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> I want to see videos of #JoeBiden “rallies.” Does anyone have any? Anyone???
1317997692933476352 2020-10-19 09:15:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why is this ok to do but churches and schools and many small business still closed or reduced operations?  The American people are being held hostage but this COVID bull 💩 &amp; the politicians pushing it. Yeah, we may still have cases but how many hospitalizations. This is 💩
1317996903309606913 2020-10-19 09:12:03 +0800 <roncarlson1> @charliekirk11 - Are you still blocked by twitter?
1317996768601071616 2020-10-19 09:11:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MissDeb_01 I didn’t block him. I still want to see what rational many of these “haters” seem to have for the things they say. One never knows when we might be able change their minds.
1317996239883960320 2020-10-19 09:09:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @widowmaker67 @daustin96 @RealCandaceO @nbcsnl I figured that Jim but I wanted to see if Libra Life had the courtesy to respond back with his rational. I will presume he won’t or if he does I am concerned he will come back with some negative wording. I hope I am wrong.

1317894354178985984 2020-10-19 02:24:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ek7_PRN Hell yes!!!!
1317887932510986242 2020-10-19 01:59:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @darksecretplace - At the risk of sounding all star struck, I just wanted to let you know that I very much enjoy your Podcasts.  Always a great listen to. 👍🏻
1317873429421289473 2020-10-19 01:01:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @KLUsa45 Thank you. That was just a bit confusing until you corrected with the "but." 😄👍
1317869997838848006 2020-10-19 00:47:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Lowcountry1Girl @ReneeCarrollAZ @realDonaldTrump Do not stay home on election day. Do not throw away your ballots. A win by Trump and the Republicans is not guaranteed. Far from it. We must all get out and vote for  President Trump and Republicans. Do not sit this one out!!!!
1317869901629980673 2020-10-19 00:47:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> Do not stay home on election day. Do not throw away your ballots. A win by Trump and the Republicans is not guaranteed. Far from it. We must all get out and vote for  President Trump and Republicans. Do not sit this one out!!!!
1317869363110629377 2020-10-19 00:45:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SensitiveNomad @DrShayPhD Sadly, even people on conservative platforms won't always be truthful. It's just the way it is. My belief is, before we retweet / comment on anything, do our own fact checking 2 ensure we have most accurate info possible. It takes time, but in the long run, I believe it pays off.
1317867814384848897 2020-10-19 00:39:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas @RepKenBuck @IkeMcCorkle James. Will you please also show the rebuttal? It's only fair. Thank you.

1317849401818337280 2020-10-18 23:25:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @EvanAKilgore I also believe in the death penalty but only if it’s enforced. Here in California it’s only on the books. #GavinNewsom took it upon himself to ban it while he’s in office.  But also, it takes decades before someone gets their punishment. 😏

1317847345544003584 2020-10-18 23:17:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is utterly shameful and sickening. This is the people that @CaptMarkKelly hires. Does Kelly feel the same way? Do we really know?
1317668819008069632 2020-10-18 11:28:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> People of Michigan. Do you believe this??

1317641501145399296 2020-10-18 09:39:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> A must read.  https://t.co/agzk6f6DUB

1317639647413989376 2020-10-18 09:32:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> I’m retweeting it also!
1317639355872129024 2020-10-18 09:31:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> Where in God’s name does @realDonaldTrump get all his energy I freakin Love it!!!!
1317639173818429445 2020-10-18 09:30:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is @Twitter  This is #ElectionInterference   https://t.co/s6opmKfqNB

1317610321477947393 2020-10-18 07:35:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> I’m not saying mail-in ballot issues are intentionally delayed but it is happening &amp; from both sides. This one from a Trump supporting company. We have moved too far too fast on this mass mail-in ballots. There was not enough time to prepare.    https://t.co/Tuu9cmCgQM
1317546632573931520 2020-10-18 03:22:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeMyGod @seanmdav Yup. This appears to be classic liberal hate and vulgarity. 🙄 It seems to me like this is all you have.
1317546323264958464 2020-10-18 03:21:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> @alt_dont @seanmdav @dale_gribbs Likewise. I haven't seen any censorship about liberals. @twitter appears to be conducting #ElectionInterference
1317545232351719426 2020-10-18 03:17:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Alignyourcar @chass2008 Good luck to you. I hope you're able to get in. I just wish he would do a rally in Southern California. @GOPChairwoman
1317483829586587648 2020-10-17 23:13:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Catzlaff @tafkag Cat: Can you post the entire video that says what you say? Much thanks.
1317474610741309441 2020-10-17 22:36:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SJPFISH @EinsteinsMagic @realDonaldTrump I do not display my support for Trump exactly for this reason.

1317473800158470146 2020-10-17 22:33:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @iheartchino @unscriptedmike Hoping so Tracey. Hoping so.
1317297463661789184 2020-10-17 10:52:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ClareSchoenherr @GOPChairwoman Good possibility.
1317289711291953153 2020-10-17 10:21:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @unknown_in_CA @GOPChairwoman Marcie: It may not count in the national election but it will definitely count in the local elections and the propositions.  Hoping you’re voting “no” on every Prop that asks for money!!
1317289166183362560 2020-10-17 10:19:45 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DARSB1 @ByronYork Aahhhh.... Hunter Biden does. And, wasn’t it one mac laptop? Where did the “three” Come from? Thanks.
1317280533215281152 2020-10-17 09:45:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why do people even think this is ok????😡
1317280090963599360 2020-10-17 09:43:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @unscriptedmike @iheartchino I hope so but I’ll believe it when I see it. In four years no one has been prosecuted. No one!!!!!
1317279282071171072 2020-10-17 09:40:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> I believe liberal media is saying the polls R favoring Biden by great numbers because they want Conservatives 2 think there’s no chance 4 Trump &amp; 2 not vote. I say we must all get out &amp; vote. Don’t stay home on Election Day. Vote 4 Trump &amp; Repubs across the board. @GOPChairwoman
1317261471059902464 2020-10-17 08:29:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RealCharlesMoon @my3monkees I can attest to that. I have hearing aids and find I sometimes to the same thing. We don’t always hear ourselves talking and then we raise our voices. Valid point.
1317261146429087750 2020-10-17 08:28:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @my3monkees Looks to me like he lost his place on the teleprompter again around the 35 second mark. 😳
1317260359644839938 2020-10-17 08:25:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @nytimes again doesn’t give honest info. Some huge fires in Calif. have been started by arson, &amp; 1 by couple announcement of their baby’s gender but @nytimes doesn’t mention this. Blames fires on “freak lightning storms.” Just 1 reason I don’t trust NYT.   https://t.co/xTJzZ63tde
1317235720461799424 2020-10-17 06:47:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ccantoon1 Then let’s tag  @SavannahGuthrie so maybe we will know how horrible and bias she was during this town hall. IMO she was a disgrace but, sadly I expected nothing else. #NBC was horribly bias.
1317232613229092864 2020-10-17 06:35:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> I thought the #nbc thing with Trump was supposed to be a town hall. For the first 20 minutes this “reporter” has been slamming trump. What the hell!!!! Here are the citizens???
1317229632811225089 2020-10-17 06:23:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am now watching the Trump town hall, tape delayed.
1316921250476920835 2020-10-16 09:57:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @l0hj028 If I had the funds, my wife would go with me, and I didn’t have my only grandchildren here in California I would depart. I’m just lucky enough I can currently afford to stay here.
1316920572434067457 2020-10-16 09:55:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TexasinCali1 I envy the heck out of you. Sadly, I have family anchors here. Good luck to you. 👍🏻
1316919864435576833 2020-10-16 09:52:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why the heck are we not recalling Gavin Newsom? #RecallGavinNewsom  He is killing our economy here in California. He is getting away with it. He is doing whatever he wants to do. He keeps changing the rules. We need to make it stop. Recall Gavin Newsom now!!
1316919521257639937 2020-10-16 09:50:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kayleighmcenany @mzee26 @realDonaldTrump I haven’t watched it yet. West Coast #NBCBlackout because #AbcTownHall was having Biden’s town hall. Did they really ask him that question again??  Nobody asked Biden about his son’s emails. I was shocked.  Shocked I tell you !!!  😳 😏
1316917280828198912 2020-10-16 09:42:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> End of #Biden Town Hall.  Not one question on #HunterBidenEmails not one question on debate moderator #Scully lying about his twitter being hacked or about moderator bias against Trump. Were these forbidden by @ABC . (#Scully &amp; #ChrisWallace) Some decent questions but not hard.
1316914468132212738 2020-10-16 09:30:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> I live in California. I was in a store today &amp; got into a discussion with a black man. Yeah, he’s a Steelers fan &amp; I’m Pats, but he said he’s no longer voting Democrat, based on how bad Calif is now &amp; how scary he believes the Democrats in the nation are. That was good to hear.
1316913499801608200 2020-10-16 09:27:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Wahoo!!!! I won!! 😬
1316913170829709319 2020-10-16 09:25:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> “Shoot them in the leg....”????  Hell, thugs have been shot in the chest and many other parts of their body and they keep coming at the cops. What a dumb statement. 😳
1316912350000304128 2020-10-16 09:22:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepVernonJones @JoeBiden @GStephanopoulos IMO, There would not be any big long running headlines if he says he “will not” pack the Supreme Court. Only major headlines if he “does support” packing. To me, that is an answer right there. I believe he is in favor of packing the Supreme Court.
1316911350350811140 2020-10-16 09:18:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> The Biden townhall has been going on for 75 minutes and no question yet about the #HunterBidenEmails  They may come later. I’m hoping @ABC did not forbid people to ask the question.
1316910026854981632 2020-10-16 09:13:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump “...way of doing...”

1316908420797255686 2020-10-16 09:06:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Another non answer. There would not be any big long running headlines if he says he “will not” pack the Supreme Court. Only major headlines if he “does support” packing. To me, that is an answer right there. I believe he is in favor of packing the Supreme Court.
1316907053814829057 2020-10-16 09:01:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Good point. I’m playing golf tomorrow. 😬
1316906110155186176 2020-10-16 08:57:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GOPChairwoman I hope you are feeling well.
1316842388011139072 2020-10-16 04:44:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump However, I will watch ABC’s townhall because I want to see the type of questions Biden gets. I can presume they will be softball but I could be wrong.
1316841958157873152 2020-10-16 04:42:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> It appears to me that @NBCNews #NBC caved to the wine community and will not be showing the @realDonaldTrump tow hall until 8:00 pm. How bloody sad. Shame on you #NBC
1316838150602289152 2020-10-16 04:27:35 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Poliwag48 @InGodIDoTrust @BibleBeltDarlin I believe if the Democrats get into office and take control we will never see any of this stuff come to light or anybody held accountable.
1316833460598697984 2020-10-16 04:08:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump I just don’t want to contribute to #MSNBC ‘s ratings. 😂😂
1316832919034327040 2020-10-16 04:06:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Good idea.
1316828634959683584 2020-10-16 03:49:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1shoppingmama @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the info. I really wish they were at exactly the same time. It would have been interesting to see the ratings difference.
1316827931000274944 2020-10-16 03:46:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> Is anyone really surprised? The @DNC and Democrat establishment is so corrupted.  I don’t understand how liberals can still think about voting these people into office. 😳
1316827235588816896 2020-10-16 03:44:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> How is the censorship by #Twitter, #facebook #Youtube not voter suppression and not election manipulation? I don’t understand. Would someone please explain this to me?

1316800814984257536 2020-10-16 01:59:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> Someone mentioned 2 me that Evangelicals don’t often vote. I don’t know if this is true or not but I implore everyone 2 ensure U get out &amp; vote this election year. Both locally &amp; nationally. Vote 4 Trump &amp; Republicans. Do not “presume” they will. Do Ur part 2 make it happen. VOTE

1316772075357442048 2020-10-16 00:05:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> Here's full interview w/ @wolfblitzer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi . Pelosi is calling Blitzer an apologists 4 Republicans because he's asking questions. Pelosi says "I feed them..." (see end of the tape) when referring 2 hungry people. IMO, this is the real Pelosi.   https://t.co/YRKExeOyWW

1316562677959847938 2020-10-15 10:12:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maziehirono - Do you need to know my sexual preference. Are you aware that even #JoeBiden uses the term “sexual preference.” Stop trying to tell us how to speak please. Thank you.
1316559438216478721 2020-10-15 10:00:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RedWhiteBlueSu1 @jack @nypost @Twitter @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Just to clarify, #JoeBiden didn’t say he would run “ads.” He said he wouldn’t run “negative ads.”  It regardless, apparently his campaign did run negative ads while Trump was in the hospital.    https://t.co/2sI1EfmfJ1

The difference now is the internet, social media, 24 hour news coverage. The electorate MUST inform themselves. Sadly, 2 many are very busy living their lives &amp; raising their families.

1316207285622829056 2020-10-14 10:40:45 +0800 <roncarlson1> Ok. Time for a drink. :-)
1316207157247795201 2020-10-14 10:40:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @NikkiHaley @Donna78700883 We see how #SpeakerPelosi treats people, even those who veer 2 the left, when they ask her hard questions. Earlier in the interview she actually call @wolfblitzer an apologist 4 the Republicans. I guess no 1 is allowed 2 ask her the hard questions.   https://t.co/GNlsDhx30V
1316204837009199110 2020-10-14 10:31:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @rose33090 Aaahh. Ok. Now I understand. I thought you were intimating he lied about something relating to his family. Thanks for clarifying. 👍
1316203935095422976 2020-10-14 10:27:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @oldseaminer @JoshuaAHouston @KamalaHarris Not sure about that Hoops. Most of the electorate is pretty much Liberal or conservative &amp; very seldom change their views. It's a small percentage of the electorate that the politicians are attempting to sway. IMO. If one party is in charge, (see Calif) they control everything.
1316203271611019270 2020-10-14 10:24:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenWhitehouse Isn't George Soros paying for a bunch of Judges in the United States? I'm hearing rumors he is. Thoughts sir?
1316202975430238208 2020-10-14 10:23:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jarvimom @washingtonpost @sms_sullivan I feel the same Donna. Hoping &amp; praying that every single Republican &amp; Independent voter &amp; hopefully many Democrat voters, get out &amp; vote for @realDonaldTrump . We can't stay home &amp; presume we will win. We must all get out &amp; vote. Every single one of us.!!!!!!! @GOPChairwoman
1316201831333343233 2020-10-14 10:19:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jarvimom @washingtonpost @sms_sullivan And IMO, unless Trump and the Republicans win, we will not see any results from the Durham investigation. It will all get swept under the rug.
1316200789027688449 2020-10-14 10:14:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @rose33090 Hi Rose: I just need to ask. How is his commercial a lie?  Thanks. BTW, I'm a Conservative and Trump supporter but I'd just like to know what you're referring to. Thanks again.
1316200140470841344 2020-10-14 10:12:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> @esaagar @OcrazioCornPop Saagar: I am a Conservative &amp; Trump supporter, but I have 2 say, using Ur logic could it not also B applied 2 women who R pro-choice? How can people who can't have babies rule on the rights of women 2 have abortions? I'm not arguing, just wondering if same logic applies. Thanks,
1316197746232098816 2020-10-14 10:02:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepBarbaraLee Actually ma'am, the people elected President Trump and the Senators who make up the majority party in the senate, so the people have spoken and their voices have been heard. They are not silenced.
1316197164427616256 2020-10-14 10:00:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoshuaAHouston @KamalaHarris Joshua: No one has said it is not constitutional. What people are saying is it is not very popular at all with the majority of American Citizens. But having a specific party doing this is tantamount to just about total one party rule. Is that something you really want???
1316165046238470145 2020-10-14 07:52:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Chicago1Ray @fantasticlegs @realDonaldTrump I would totally love to see video of Biden's rally if you happen to have it. Thanks
1316164864570605568 2020-10-14 07:52:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BoSnerdley I hope you enjoyed your run in the Senate. Too bad there isn't another Republican running against you. Sadly, we will probably end up giving your seat to a democrat. Happy?????
1316157970468671488 2020-10-14 07:24:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Project_Veritas Done.
1316154430991953920 2020-10-14 07:10:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> American people. This is your representative. @SpeakerPelosi only cares about getting her way and when asked way, she accuses @wolfblitzer of being an apologist. Some of  #NancyPelosi ‘s own people want her to accept the $1.8T package. She doesn’t care about us!! 😡 Trump does.
1316153012620984320 2020-10-14 07:05:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ Make the district attorneys, prosecutors and politicians ensure people who commit crimes are not let out without bail. Repeal props 47 &amp; 57. Lock up offenders. Then you’ll see the crime rate go back down. Making an actual crime not a crime isn’t reducing the crime rate. IMO.
1316116712215859200 2020-10-14 04:40:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> I agree.
1316116683451363328 2020-10-14 04:40:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ACTBrigitte I agree.

1316096430180769792 2020-10-14 03:20:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why are there no coverage of all the people who attend #JoeBiden 's rallies? I have searched the internet and can't find anything??? Does anyone have any video of the attendees of @JoeBiden 's rallies? Thank you.

Stop it already? @JudiciaryGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems

1316057583137042442 2020-10-14 00:45:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Granted, everyone can check, but I fear many don't realize that. Also, we seem 2 B seeing much more mail thefts than previous. Unless previous mail thefts have not been reported. I do believe thefts are related 2 the mail-in ballots. It may not B "systemic" but it's there.
1316048062364618752 2020-10-14 00:08:03 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SpiritsMe @MittRomney This was the reason I used the word "presume." And I have my doubts about Romney and other politicians hate Trump. They may be conservatives but they may also be part of the "deep state." I don't know. It is only my opinion. I do see much more hate from the left than the right.
1316046889624629251 2020-10-14 00:03:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kylegriffin1 Who says it's offensive?? You or other liberals. Just because you say it and just because "you" are offended by it does not make it offensive. For gawd sake sir, grow a pair. 😏
1316046083923955712 2020-10-14 00:00:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SpiritsMe @MittRomney I'm not sure where Ur coming from with this comment @spiritsMe? I don't know about all of them but 1 of the alleged kidnappers was a Trump hater. I would presume he is not conservative. I could be wrong. &amp; that is 1 specific instance. There R many instances of left spewing hate.
1316040060022611976 2020-10-13 23:36:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MittRomney Mr. Romney. that vast majority of the "hate" rhetoric is coming from the left. At least from what I see. Thank you.
1316038786204102656 2020-10-13 23:31:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal Exactly. But I don't believe it would have mattered either way. Barrett gave her answers and in my belief @DickDurbin had he mind made up.

1315706675660165120 2020-10-13 01:31:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AnnetteGH86 I concur. But maybe, just maybe, we'll turn a bit purple.
1315706461016584192 2020-10-13 01:30:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> Would someone please tell me why every Judiciary Committee member has to have their own speech at the SCOTUS nomination? I know one answer is because they like to hear themselves talk, but is there an official reason they all bloviate? Much thanks to those who provide answer.
1315648518971822084 2020-10-12 21:40:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Do you think this confirmation hearing has any impact on Graham's re-election? I do not. The confirmation is almost assured and his supporters realize this. Hard to believe Harrison raised $57M. I've contributed to Graham but I can't contribute that much. 😳 Hoping Graham wins.

They are voting for Harris and the very liberal left. I predict if Joe does win the vote, he will be gone within a year, making Harris the President.

1315338783630319617 2020-10-12 01:09:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TimMurtaugh @thornedella Tim: Would you please provide more than the 15 second clip? More context would be a more honest version. Much thanks.

1315335979423592448 2020-10-12 00:58:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepBarbaraLee It's not majority of conservatives pushing division, causing unrest, calling opposing party racists, bigots, white supremist, destroying property, spewing hate on MSM, censoring people on social media.  It's the majority of liberals. Unity over division means voting Republican
1315334689775783936 2020-10-12 00:53:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> I'm from California and I completely agree!!!!

I just feel it doesn't hurt 2 push the fact we "MUST get out an vote.
1315300301017149443 2020-10-11 22:36:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SunshineSt8Sam @LoneStar_Dad @TeamTrump @EquipoTrump @TrumpWarRoom @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @TrumpStudents As much as I hope Donald Trump wins we all, everyone of us must get out and vote on Nov. 3rd. We cannot stay home and presume that President Trump and the Republicans will win in November it is up to us. Get out and vote!!
1315140451649892353 2020-10-11 12:01:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @baj5252 @FoxNews Very true. Sad to realize that @FoxNews #FoxNews is getting as bad as those other cable media

1315077479652945920 2020-10-11 07:51:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JulieW8 @CASOSvote @JudicialWatch I read this article &amp; believe it. I don’t think fraud, whatever the means, affects national elections much but already we R seeing attempts in local elections where it could have great impact locally. Granted officials R catching some, but I question how many R not caught locally

I just don’t like sending voter ballots 2 everyone even if they don’t want 2 vote or they R not residents of the state. I will trust the system will work but still worry.   https://t.co/jylhQrVC3x
1315051995905044481 2020-10-11 06:10:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JulieW8 @CASOSvote No. My point is the state’s election boards, or someone, is supposed to keep the voter records updated. That is their responsibility. Calif didn’t do anything in over 20 years until @JudicialWatch forced them.    https://t.co/yxZtuUvSLx!

1314972106455564289 2020-10-11 00:52:35 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenDuckworth And #JoeBiden used tax loopholes so he wouldn't have to pay medicare &amp; social security taxes on $15M dollars he received for speaking engagements. How is this not any different? Will you shout this out to your twitter fans?? Hypocrisy?   https://t.co/IHc55MRRTp
1314965004278358017 2020-10-11 00:24:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> Many California conservative voters R busy every day supporting their families. They don't have time 2 review all props &amp; rely on commercials 4 voting. I'm hoping this will help them review all options, including propositions, when they vote. Important.  https://t.co/6zgkYcm9VL

1314962683452514304 2020-10-11 00:15:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ChrisMurphyCT Why do you never mention that fact that China definitely wants Biden / Harris to be in office.

1314379934727503872 2020-10-09 09:39:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LindaLiberty9 @1OldScalawag Sadly, it doesn’t matter how often Trump denounces White Supremacy, he’s done it many times, the left just keeps saying he refuses 2 do so &amp; people, who just listen 2 them &amp; don’t do their own research, believe them. Do Ur own research folks. U’ll find sources R lying 2 U.
1314349559556927488 2020-10-09 07:38:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> I haven’t seen any news on how @FLOTUS is doing. Does anyone know??
1314346307528482817 2020-10-09 07:25:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews 14 days is the recommendation. If a person has no symptoms, which we are being told applies to Trump why does he have to be quarantined for the full 14 days?

How do they believe #KamalaHarris when she said she believed women who accuse Biden of assault but now support Joe Biden?
1314293153852129280 2020-10-09 03:54:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> I do not normally open these sites but this time I am very glad I did. These "colored" photos are simply specular!!

1314281426494259200 2020-10-09 03:08:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CaliNeedsHelp @classytexasgirl They change the voting method in the middle of an election year, of course they try to change the debate rules.
1314281151528280064 2020-10-09 03:06:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> Just another example of "not widespread" voter fraud. While we should be concerned about #VoterFraud in national elections it is these small town elections where #VoterFraud can also hurt us greatly. #VoterFraud is real despite what the liberal MSM tries to tell you.
1314278740810063872 2020-10-09 02:57:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> Voter fraud "is" widespread. It's just not "widely  covered" by #MSM   https://t.co/kNo0XJTEB8
1314277258626920448 2020-10-09 02:51:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> #JoeBiden &amp; #KamalaHarris have repeatedly said "no fracking." Why won't #MSNBC #CNN #ABC #ABCNews #cbsNews @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews rebut what these two people say in the debates and briefings???

1314238242057715712 2020-10-09 00:16:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JackPosobiec @OcrazioCornPop Very valid point.
1314228429043105792 2020-10-08 23:37:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @clairecmc The Democrat Party has been trying to remove President Trump from office even before he assumed office. How is this accepting the outcome of an election and "peacefully" leaving office? Hypocritical big time.

Just trying 2 point out that I'm hoping they don't B completely conservative. When our conservative politicians R wrong, we need 2 admit this.

1314078633837776896 2020-10-08 13:42:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MLBNetwork @Dodgers @Padres Yeah. Probably not. As far a I’m concerned, there is as much interest in baseball as there is any sports and I will remain that way fit me until sports gets back to being sports and gets away from this “wokeness” they out themselves in.

1314029039728750592 2020-10-08 10:25:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> The left media will say Harris won and the right media will say Pence won. Such is the way with wickedly bias media...Both sides. The American people must decide for them selves and not rely omg the media.

1314023563356041216 2020-10-08 10:03:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler I hate that the monitors don’t point that stuff out and don’t give the VP a chance to rebut it.
1314021042994794498 2020-10-08 09:53:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> Harris is not answering the question if China is a friend or adversary and the monitor is not pushing it. Shocking!!!!😳

1314020014521868289 2020-10-08 09:49:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Also, how can they be expected to respond in just 15 seconds???
1314014445702529025 2020-10-08 09:27:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @reallouiehuey No she isn’t but she gets to say she is because she’s a Democrat and they don’t care that she isn’t black. She isn’t white so she can say she’s black and throw the race card into the mix. It’s what the continue to do.
1314009035658588162 2020-10-08 09:05:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is what #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisVP supports.

1313938302668423168 2020-10-08 04:24:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TeamTrump @jimboazil This is what the Liberal Left does. #micheleobama and the #ObamaAdministration did similar things with their #foodpyrmid Since when does the government tell us whether we can or cannot eat meat?? Vote the Liberals into office and they will end up running your entire life. IMO.
1313935073641549824 2020-10-08 04:11:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @VoteRed_ @1geauxhawks What other political family has this many "coincidental" deaths of people directly related to the political aspects of the #ClintonMachine ?
1313934123224821760 2020-10-08 04:08:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ACTBrigitte No way in hell. IMO he is the puppet of the liberal left. We are so screwed if they get elected into office.

1313880622100742144 2020-10-08 00:35:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> The legal voting citizens of LA County MUST vote 4 #JACKIELACEY 4 LA County DA. #GeorgeGascon was the person who actually wrote Prop 47 which reduced many felonies to misdemeanors.

If liberal leftist prosecutors in St. Louis will do this 2 these folks, imagine what they will do 2 average citizens who don't have the resources 2 defend themselves. We can't keep these politicians in office.

It was proof positive that #NBC used some of the same people in their townhall that #MSNBC used in their interviews. They were not undecided voters. Are you really ok with this??
1313875875343986688 2020-10-08 00:16:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump How much more dishonest can the liberal media be? Watch this 1min 17 second video. This is horrible that the media would do this? If the media stoops so low to do this, what will they do to control you if #BidenHarris  is elected?  #MSNBC #CBSNews #CNN #ABC #HuffPost #NBC

Again, this is my opinion and I’m totally aware it wouldn’t rest easy with those who have lost loved ones to this virus.  I have also lost family members and friends to diseases so I also know the pain.

There is no response I can give that would ease the pain of anyone who has lost anyone to any disease because the pain is too great 4 them. But to live in fear, especially for going on almost a year is, IMO, worse than the disease itself.
1313659951823294464 2020-10-07 09:58:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump And thank God you did sir. Keep up the great work!!!!

1313652873016664066 2020-10-07 09:30:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> What the heck is wrong with all U liberal leftists politicians in California?? This is dictatorship!!! Why are we California citizens allowing this to happen. Vote these people out of office.

I’m a long time Celtic fan &amp; Boston sport fan but becuz of all the “wokeness” in sports world I’ve not watched any sport games this year. I watch sports 2 get away from all the political stuff &amp; don’t need it when I’m watching my teams. TY.
1313583621169577984 2020-10-07 04:55:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jayce_bryson @realDonaldTrump Actually sir, @bonnyaye reminded me that the President does not have the power to make the Senate or the House do anything. Equal branches of government. I was mistaken in my request. I’ve sent same request to @senatemajldr and @SpeakerPelosi afterwards.
1313575989578883072 2020-10-07 04:24:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TheGreatFeather @HermanM36169986 You should show the whole clip. He was quoting from something. I thing this clip is very misleading and wrong to put it out like this. Thanks

1313575472639344640 2020-10-07 04:22:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bonnyaye @realDonaldTrump I deleted my tweet asking how your comment related to my question. Now I see it. The President can't "make" the Senate &amp; House do anything. Bad choice of words on my part. Thanks for the heads up. But again, what does "FFS" mean? thanks,
1313574747582558208 2020-10-07 04:19:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bonnyaye @realDonaldTrump Also, what does "FFS" mean. Thanks again.

Wallace also asked President Trump if he would denounce White Supremacy but didn't ask that of Joe Biden. At least I didn't hear him ask Biden. Did he??
1313572272486060032 2020-10-07 04:10:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. Is there some way U can make Senate &amp; House provide American People with bullet point list of what's in their bills. i.e.  *PPE - $1T * School Safety - $1T * Unemployment Benefits - $1T  etc.  It wud give the American citizen an insight 2 what our reps R asking 4.

You can bet @GeorgeGascon will not prosecute many of the criminals arrested. He didn’t do often in San Francisco and he won’t do it in LA. More criminals in the streets and your neighborhoods.

1312560694651359232 2020-10-04 09:10:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1talianG1rly @Onlysony324 @realDonaldTrump I so very much hope we can turn California Red again. Or at the very least this election year, purple.
1312555848229507073 2020-10-04 08:51:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @morningmoneyben Seriously Ben?? You don’t know self deprecation when you see it?? 😏
1312541484244103169 2020-10-04 07:54:10 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ichadlowe Sir: 1)I'm not rich by any stretch of imagination. 2)I'm white, not a white nationalist &amp; not racist 3)I'm not smartest man in the world but by no stretch am I stupid. I also don't stoop 2 level of slandering a large group of people becuz they don't agree w/my politics as U did.
1312521656821149697 2020-10-04 06:35:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump 4 of 4 - Create a 10-percent repatriation tax Cancel the Paris climate agreement Reverse Barack Obama's 2016 gun executive order Nominate someone from his list of justices to replace Antonin Scalia Slash federal regulations Stop TPP
1312521554144550912 2020-10-04 06:34:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump 3 of 4 - Ask countries we protect to pay more for joint defense Limit legal immigration Create private White House veterans hotline Suspend immigration from terror-prone places Move U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Keep Guantanamo Bay Detention Center open
1312521428042825729 2020-10-04 06:34:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump 2 of 4 - Place lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign government Use U.S. steel for infrastructure projects Defund Planned Parenthood Ensure funding for historic black colleges Reverse Barack Obama's Cuba policy Renegotiate NAFTA Take no salary
1312521326188359680 2020-10-04 06:34:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump 1 of 4 - I liked the way U moved away from "pandering." :-) Promises Kept:  End the defense sequester Make no cuts to Social Security Increase veterans' health care Save the Carrier plant in Indiana Raise tariffs on goods imported into the U.S.
1312501089653014529 2020-10-04 05:13:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 @FoxNews @FoxNewsSunday @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity I don’t like commenters who say they are conservatives but their action show otherwise.
1312495236866691072 2020-10-04 04:50:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump IMO, pandering is saying similar things ever 4 years as Democrats do. Pres.Trump talks the talk &amp; walks the walk. The difference between Democrats &amp; President Trump is the Democrats just “say” things every 4 years while President Trump actually does things he says he will do.
1312488810496704512 2020-10-04 04:24:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JennPellegrino @OANN Great for you to credit the photo. I don’t see that near enough. Kudos!!
1312475075115798528 2020-10-04 03:30:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @senatemajldr and @LindseyGrahamSC - This is a valid post. Please do not let any of the @SenateDems tell you how to run the Senate. Vote on SCOTUS nominee!!!  Thank you.

1312463759210758144 2020-10-04 02:45:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> I just called &amp; left my comments on how sad I am that @foxnews &amp; @FoxNewsSunday (Chris Wallace) have veered 2 the left. I don't like they have bias people as commentators &amp; I will only watch @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle &amp; @seanhannity going fwd. Was UR intent was 2 lose viewers?
1312461018442821634 2020-10-04 02:34:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @h2sdrummer @vmsalama I found this on Brietbart but I can't find any of the actual video they speak of. Additionally, there is still no name of the actual source that said it. This is what sucks about "sources" IMO.   https://t.co/5Ar7WRvEEL

1312442526171762690 2020-10-04 01:20:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @h2sdrummer @vmsalama Where did you get this info?
1312434865678159873 2020-10-04 00:50:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> @maggieNYT Who are your "sources?" If your "sources" are unwilling to put their name to what they say, than they, IMO, have no creditability
1312433854146256897 2020-10-04 00:46:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Pismo_B @ILovedat @FoxNews I have to disagree with this. I believe in God and I support all those who have other beliefs. However, I don't believe that any news outlet should be doing these things on public air time. New Media should report the news. Thanks for listening.
1312431567961088006 2020-10-04 00:37:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @vmsalama Why won't you actually name the "source" so your comment can be verified?
1312422939170467840 2020-10-04 00:03:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @chuckwoolery @ll1pretty1 Its apparent me @Twitter is an extremely liberal bias organization. I dont understand how they R allowed 2 get away with the blatant censorship they routinely enforce. I’m on twitter becuz it’s where I C news things tweeted which I can research. But day by day moving 2 #Parler

1312085059294253057 2020-10-03 01:40:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> Has anyone heard any updated information on Bernell Trammell?  I can’t find any updated info.   https://t.co/M0XAUidqra

1311876514846187521 2020-10-02 11:51:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @reimagine_la Of course they did. All the more reason for California voters to vote no on Measure J. Become knowledgeable. Know what you are voting for. Do not rely on TV ads or “feel good” mail fliers. They mislead you greatly.
1311852190374354949 2020-10-02 10:15:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 @SenKamalaHarris BTW... How you doing dude?
1311852079271477249 2020-10-02 10:14:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 @SenKamalaHarris Many people on the right have apologized for things they have said and the left didn’t let them slide. I believe the only time any politician apologizes is because they got caught. I believe mostly what they say is how they feel. BOTH sides.
1311850735965929472 2020-10-02 10:09:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Breaking911 I do blame the media. I blame @johnrobertsFox because the question has been asked and answered ad nauseam. IMO you have done damage to #FoxNews and journalist.  And we know you don’t care what we say.  Ur actions today were despicable.
1311849092469805057 2020-10-02 10:02:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SJPFISH @TX_Bruce Something is off about this. 1) From Planet Ethiopia 2) Right side driving?? Just seems strange.

At the end Biden got one vote and Trump got two (or more?? because @CNN didn’t show the entire group when asked if Trump won).  My thoughts.. neither win that debate.    https://t.co/z4b4E7Eat4

1311817158318465024 2020-10-02 07:55:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @joshdcaplan @realDonaldTrump Let @Facebook erase them. Let @Facebook be the bias crooked organization that they are. This is why President Trump has his followers and we support him. We trust @realDonaldTrump and support him almost 100 percent. At least I do.
1311816356514332673 2020-10-02 07:52:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Techno_Fog @johnrobertsFox Ha ha ha ha!!! Good man @johnrobertsFox I wonder if you will now do a “mea culpa.” But I guess now that you appear to be a puppet of the left you want your two minutes of fame and also want President Trump to denounce them every single day. Good on @PressSec

1311754338793005056 2020-10-02 03:46:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Jennife20311813 Totally understand. It was just surprising to see a tweet about Saturday Night Fever which I hadn't seen in a long while and was, back in the day, one of my favorite movies. :-)
1311752548533956608 2020-10-02 03:39:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Jennife20311813 😄😄😄 I still love disco. Some of it.
1311752380271063040 2020-10-02 03:38:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @johnrobertsFox - U probably don't give a darn about what I think but IMO U &amp; the other people in the room asking these questions &amp; continually interrupting the @PressSec made complete &amp; utter fools of yourselves &amp; U destroyed Ur reputation as journalists. Shame on you all.

1311725397881487360 2020-10-02 01:51:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am not well versed at all on the process for vetting a SCOTUS nominee but wasn’t Judge Coney-Barrett vetted two years ago for District Judge?

I don't think we will ever C that happening. They still don't give @JennPellegrino or @ChanelRion a seat in the gallery. Appears seats R only 4 liberal leaning "reporters."

1311690406925492224 2020-10-01 23:32:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> If these reporters continue to interrupt @PressSec when she is answering questions I foresee the briefings being stopped. The @whpressscorps better get a hold on this.
1311689534459928576 2020-10-01 23:28:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> These reporters at the White House briefing are horrendous. @whpressscorps

1311679855419781120 2020-10-01 22:50:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> Is this the world we want? Were people cannot express their views in a civil manner without being punished for it just because they support Trump?? @QuinnSimmons9 - So sad this happened to you. 😢  https://t.co/F2Tjxn7Gog
1311506455799894016 2020-10-01 11:21:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ I am just an avg citizen. I don’t know politics or reasons leaders make decisions but I believe letting prisoners out early no cash bail very lax punishment 4 some crimes leads 2 increased crime rates. If we don’t fix broken windows more damage occurs. Keep up great work @LAPDHQ
1311493667434110976 2020-10-01 10:30:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am looking forward to the senate hearing because I don’t think the Democrats will be able to help themselves. They will ask questions that will make them look more bigoted and horrible.

1311488744264933376 2020-10-01 10:10:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> Does anyone know why Liz Wheeler is no longer hosting #TippingPoint on @OANN ??
1311488320388567040 2020-10-01 10:09:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump fully supports school choice. Biden / Sanders plan says “we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding.” This is Biden / Sanders 110 page plan. Do search on “charter” and see their plan. (Page 24)   https://t.co/l0NYSb6id6
1311471472544673792 2020-10-01 09:02:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GeorgePapa19 @Eddie_and_Patti He appeared alert because the @TeamTrump #TrumpCampaign @GOPChairwoman consistently pushed that he was sleepy Joe and in doing so severely lowered the bar for Biden to reach. That strategy must end. Thank you.
1311454938250190848 2020-10-01 07:56:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @hearing_nelson @JoeBiden IMO he never will becuz the liberal leftist Dems also supported KKK, segregationist &amp; Robert Byrd. I’m waiting 4 other people who’ve been adversely affected by these people 2 say “enough is enough.” Every 4 years Dems pander 2 people who’ve  been affected, counting on their vote.
1311400107024154624 2020-10-01 04:18:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Alyssa_Milano - I'm pretty sure you won't respond but I sincerely hope you do. #Trump has denounced White Supremacy time and time again. Why won't you admit this? Thank you  https://t.co/p6tyZHOZRe
1311398941926150145 2020-10-01 04:14:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ray13RP @kylegriffin1 @KatyTurNBC Ray: What do you call this?? I really hope you reply. Thanks.   https://t.co/p6tyZHOZRe
1311398768353263618 2020-10-01 04:13:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kylegriffin1 @KatyTurNBC Kyle:  Hopefully, you will respond to me on this link. Here is Trump condemning them over and over. What do you want him to do??   https://t.co/p6tyZHOZRe
1311398074644754432 2020-10-01 04:10:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RefladyData @the1murdock Yes, he was arrested on a Carjacking incident on 09/16 and the DA just announced this morning he is being charged with the LA Cop shooting. I can't find a source to that yet.
1311397178686889985 2020-10-01 04:07:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @the1murdock I'm starting to believe, for the past few years now, the death penalty in California is BS. It only provides the prisoners with better accommodations, (I believe) and we spend bunches of money on appeals. I say "Life and a day" in prison with no possibility of parole at all.
1311393759247036417 2020-10-01 03:53:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Prove it.  Unless you're saying "If Joe Biden were the president China would not have loosed the virus on the world."
1311393474684489728 2020-10-01 03:52:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂😂😂
1311393128784424960 2020-10-01 03:51:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GroverNorquist @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't MSN fact check #JoeBiden??? I believe #JoeBiden will ruin our economy, including jobs.
1311391648329297920 2020-10-01 03:45:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ilhan I would be willing to wager, if everyone spoke honestly,  they would take all the tax deductions they legally can. If what Trump did was legal, according to the tax laws, then he has every right to take advantage of those laws.
1311391115338158082 2020-10-01 03:43:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd I can understand voting for a 3rd party. In 2016 I totally didn't want Clinton and was real worried about Trump so I voted for Johnson. I voted because it's my right and, IMO, my duty. Also, I feel, if I don't vote, I don't have a right to complain.
1311345296530501632 2020-10-01 00:40:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @HelmholzW @larryelder @AOC I agree.
1311345200267223041 2020-10-01 00:40:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Crozierguy @larryelder @AOC Sir: How many times does Trump have to condemn white supremacy? Does he have to do it every single time he's asked and if he doesn't people just say he doesn't condemn it. He has condemned it!!!   https://t.co/fwi8NwoRsN
1311344666827079681 2020-10-01 00:38:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GA_peach3102 @DudleyDidrightV Sir: As much as I want 2 C people who abuse power B held accountable, do U really think anything will happen 2 Comey? Especially if Trump doesn't get reelected AND the Republicans don't keep the senate. If this doesn't happen all the stuff will B swept under the rug. ☹️
1311343329548722177 2020-10-01 00:33:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ForbiddenReali1 @CraigPruess @CBS_Herridge @Comey I believe, sadly, you are right. I think the #DeepState goes very deep indeed. :-(
1311342779000266752 2020-10-01 00:30:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @IAmMonique16 @wegotgunstoo @realDonaldTrump Trump has already condemned white supremacy. The Trump haters want to ask him every single time so if he doesn't say it again, they can say he doesn't condemn it.  He has!!!!  https://t.co/fwi8Nw7g4d
1311341961291296769 2020-10-01 00:27:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CraigPruess @ForbiddenReali1 @CBS_Herridge @Comey Hopefully, it's not too late. There's only four weeks till the election and if Trump is not reelected and the Republicans don't keep the senate, anything that is discovered will be swept under the rug. IMO
1311341375359578112 2020-10-01 00:25:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenAmyKlobuchar Ms. Klobuchar: There have been multiple verified instances of #Voterfraud recently and I'm sure you're aware of this. At what point do you think it becomes a problem??
1311339184586518528 2020-10-01 00:16:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @InfidelAngela @ll1pretty1 I am an avid Trump supporter but this is just my opinion / input. IMO a two second clip doesn't provide any context what so ever. He was quoting quoting from from the document he held.  https://t.co/DtW2gSB4l0
1311323700608737281 2020-09-30 23:15:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge @Comey I’m glad to see Comey in front of the Senate but will any prosecution ever come out of these hearings???

1311315400328540160 2020-09-30 22:42:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> I “think” the “independent” fact checkers on #Facebook and #Instagram are very partisan people.  https://t.co/h3rxCm0w9W
1311313371472429057 2020-09-30 22:34:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @hucklebee_sarah It doesn’t seem to matter any more what Trump said.  Democrats know what he actually said. They don’t care. They still push the lie and MSM repeats it. #ChrisWallace ( #FoxNewsSunday ) was such as bias moderator last night.    https://t.co/eQBLttjkea…
1311174068385714176 2020-09-30 13:20:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @4MiddleAmerican @rdargnews @JoeBiden Trump did the same thing. He was texting while on stage.
1311136962284191744 2020-09-30 10:53:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler I say no one won. I voted Trump because I wanted to see the results.
1311136435026583553 2020-09-30 10:51:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> Well, so much for @JoeBiden supporting the #GreenNewDeal   He flatly stated he does not support the #GreenNewDeal.
1311133105957216257 2020-09-30 10:37:46 +0800 <roncarlson1> #ChrisWallace @FoxNewsSunday - You were so bias in many of your questions. So sad.
1311125095839014912 2020-09-30 10:05:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MAGA_JAKE_MAGA @GOPChairwoman Yeah and no I guess. 😬

1311124474851278848 2020-09-30 10:03:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> Well, I can already presume how the conservative and liberal media will critique this debate.
1311121544882528256 2020-09-30 09:51:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> Trump does need to tone it down a bit. @GOPChairwoman

1311090655490269184 2020-09-30 07:49:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @newtgingrich Of course it is. The proof and instances are getting to the point of rampant. Who give a darn if it isn’t “widespread” as the left and MSM like to say all the time.
1311090241629872130 2020-09-30 07:47:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GOPChairwoman - Please help. I want 2 donate more but can’t find answer 2 a question I have.

We all have our preferences and choices. I begrudge no one for their choices and only hope for the same in return. I enjoy the civil discourse because we never know when our minds can be changed if we remain open minded.

I am paying less taxes also so I know who I'm voting for in 2020. But I don't begrudge anyone for voting who they want to vote for. Thanks to all for the discourse and the links.
1311003581290479616 2020-09-30 02:03:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bjaycat1985 @urbanmodernism @peffley_renee @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Ok. I just read into the article. Now I see what was meant by paying taxes in other countries.  Thanks for providing.
1311001977132740609 2020-09-30 01:56:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bjaycat1985 @urbanmodernism @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Yes. NYC sent me the link about the funding of the IRS. I was unaware of that until I saw the article.

1311000674457366528 2020-09-30 01:51:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @peffley_renee @urbanmodernism @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Renee: I deleted my original response because I was thinking you replied to something else. I see you replied that you "don't take all the deductions you are allowed." I don't understand why, but that is your choice. Thanks I had originally asked that of NYCMom.

One responder said, (paraphrasing) "The IRS is underfunded so doesn't have the time for big accounts like Trumps. I personally kind of doubt that.

1310998529507115008 2020-09-30 01:43:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @urbanmodernism @peffley_renee @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff I understand all that &amp; that is why I pay my taxes.  But again, do you take all the deductions that you are allowed to take?  To answer Ur question: If deductions are legal, I do not think it is wrong.
1310997443912151042 2020-09-30 01:38:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @urbanmodernism @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff I ended up paying less. But I don't know the difference between you and me. However, you didn't answer my question. Do you take all the legal tax deduction you can possibly take when you file your taxes?
1310997058011029505 2020-09-30 01:37:10 +0800 <roncarlson1> @peffley_renee @urbanmodernism @edokeefe @JoeBiden @DrBiden @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Don't you think if Trump was doing something illegally on his taxes the IRS would be knowing about it. Especially after all the publicity this issue has received over the past five years.

I have a sad feeling Mr. Wallace will be very hard on Trump and very easy on Biden. I hope I am wrong. Just my opinion.
1310996034928087040 2020-09-30 01:33:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SJPFISH @mollyday15 I am so hoping all the #BLM protests, street blocking, disrupting people's ability 2 get 2 their jobs backfires on them so hugely that President Trump is reelected in a landslide, Republicans increase seats in the Senate &amp; take the House. I hate when protestors disrupt my life.

He did a 90 minute briefing / question &amp; answer session with PBS a couple of weeks ago and he didn't do badly at all. I think the @TeamTrump campaign lowered the bar too much.

1310760864257982466 2020-09-29 09:58:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @KaMari_Shop Thank you very much!!!!!
1310760611702140928 2020-09-29 09:57:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @markie812 @Madamtazzz IMO, the bar has been set so low for him that I am very concerned that is what will happen.
1310760366138245121 2020-09-29 09:56:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @liquidlaugh I do not trust #ChrisWallace and I am disheartened that I don't. News anchors are not supposed to be distrustful but when the appear to be bias, they are distrustful.
1310757723718340608 2020-09-29 09:46:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> @KaMari_Shop This (see link below) was a clip of the PBS interview/briefing with Joe Biden. This clip is 2:07 minutes but I can’t find the entire briefing. I’m also unable to determine when the briefing was but i don’t think it was that long ago. Are you able to help locate full video? 🙏
1310689053650509824 2020-09-29 05:13:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BenjaminBreeg__ @ihatethemedia @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC @OANN Looking like it, right??
1310688967478583296 2020-09-29 05:12:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AnnetteGH86 That is what concerns me. I really believe in the #NWO  I believe #JFK tried to fight it and it didn't end up well for him. I also believe Trump is trying to fight it.
1310675256785252352 2020-09-29 04:18:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> Listening 2 @seanhannity radio show w/ @LindseyGrahamSC right now. Every day they R saying “..damning evidence 4 yada yada..” @OANN says similar things. If there’s so much damning evidence why has no 1  been prosecuted?  Starting 2 sound like a lot of BS &amp; Ur part of deep state.
1310622701170561024 2020-09-29 00:49:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> @sundance7055 Who ever took this picture, what did you do afterwards besides posting it to twitter. Did you call local law enforcement and report it and wait around to see if someone showed up. Did you report it to the local or national news? Thanks,
1310620367451385857 2020-09-29 00:40:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Johnnywhales @the1murdock @EmeraldRobinson I don't think this is true. I sadly think Biden will do well at the debate. Cud B due 2 him being on meds (I've no proof). Cud B due to questions being softball 4 both. Will definitely B due 2 MSM will gloat all over how great Biden did at debate &amp; how horrible Trump did.

And if God determines, why should we even vote?

1310609900532387841 2020-09-28 23:58:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am just so tired of the many people that spew info on this site a refuse to provide any sources. Or people who post edited videos of events but don't have the decency to provide the entire video. If you have a clip, then you have the entire source. That is just my opinion.

I am just against "anyone" (left or right) putting out false information &amp; if I can, I try to put the correct info. I don't think anyone wins with false info &amp; I don't believe in "They do it, we might as well do it" logic. Thanks,

1310281644641677318 2020-09-28 02:14:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bennyjohnson @spiffyw Actually Benny, I think the key phase here is "..while election is underway.." It's a true statement based only on the almost 45 day early elections. Many times it's happened "during an election year" but I can't find where it's happened "during" voting.
1310280012822528000 2020-09-28 02:07:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SchlagerBomb @GailKent @maddad0921 True. I was just trying to put some actual context to the statement.

But that said, I don't think God has any input on the results of elections. Just my opinion. :-)

1310275807869153280 2020-09-28 01:51:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @vanessagrigor Way to slam a woman Vanessa. You should be ashamed of yourself. 😠

"These old people haven’t earned these entitlements!” "...We will have these phased out completely by 2024...“.....not the past of these older generations.” (See info in this source)  https://t.co/15ZEZx68iD

1310270274072227840 2020-09-28 01:29:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RealJamesWoods But I think, sadly, that many of the liberal American's actually do not believe this is happening because the liberal news organizations are not reporting on it.  @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews
1310267654784000000 2020-09-28 01:18:47 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RandyBoeBandy @Breaking911 Actually Trevor, I think the key phase here is "..while election is underway.."

1310259791441227776 2020-09-28 00:47:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeBiden was asked a question at the very end of today's speech (see below). I couldn't hear it but his answer was "Just tell the truth." He's lied many times in his career, when it helps "him".  https://t.co/anXUxs09tR  https://t.co/Vj9IqbzzCX
1310256604034465792 2020-09-28 00:34:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeBiden has said twice already in his speech (see below) that people "..are voting right now.."  Maybe this should B a reason not 2 have early voting well over 30 days before elections. IMO, early voting is a very bad idea. It should be done away with.   https://t.co/swGjNYOgdI

He said he served in Vietnam, a war where many service men &amp; women gave their lives. To lie about valor is horrendous.    https://t.co/Cq4YObG4IN

1310055568233521152 2020-09-27 11:16:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @YoffeLeah @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman @JennaEllisEsq Sadly, these clips appear heavily edited so we can’t trust that @gatewaypundit and Jim Hoft are providing honest information or editing it to fit their narrative. They do this frequently. This should bother people. They must provide source to full. interview.

This clip &amp; the clip in UR story seems heavily edited. Your news org is as bad as #MSNBC and #CNN when you don’t provide an honest rendering of the full interview. Please provide. I couldn’t find it. Thank you.

1310005709946249216 2020-09-27 07:57:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @swamp_nugget @JoeBiden #JoeBiden repeated said time and time again, no fracking, no fossil fuels. I don’t care how many times he now says he won’t do away with them we know what his true plans are. He doesn’t care about many blue collar workers.
1309993647287328769 2020-09-27 07:09:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @seriouslynow7 - Hi. I see your profile says “Moderate but concerned.” If you don’t mind, what concerns you? I’m a conservative, support Trump on most things but I too have concerns. I worry we may move “too” far to the right. Maybe I’m watching too much “Handmaids Tales.”
1309986276473368576 2020-09-27 06:40:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> Awesome role model!!!
1309986123263873025 2020-09-27 06:40:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> @distrumption It would be challenging to tell with him sometimes. Although he did chuckle a bit.  I’m presuming ur from Calif., re: AB5. I concur, in addition to many other props that need no votes on them.

I wish the Christians who stay they can't vote for Trump because of his past would have the courage to respond, decently, to your post. Sadly, I don't see that happening. Hence, there will never be a discussion. :-(
1309894170178326530 2020-09-27 00:34:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd Are there any recall efforts going on in NY?
1309893995263176704 2020-09-27 00:33:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> Thank you Senate Democrats &amp; Republicans for combining the two.   https://t.co/mumnXSLIsi

1309690132329504768 2020-09-26 11:03:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @GOPChairwoman - Please help. How does the Trump campaign do 800% matching funds? This is email I received.  “Our Nation needs you. I am facing unprecedented challenges For a short time, when you step up and contribute ANY AMOUNT, your gift will be 800%-MATCHED! See below.”
1309634065037889536 2020-09-26 07:21:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> @stillgray @alaskan_patriot These protesters/ rioters can kiss my butt. If they want to block public roadways, which is illegal, then whatever they are protesting / rioting for means nothing to me. I hope that is their intention. I wonder how many others now couldn’t care less anymore about their causes.
1309633349074317314 2020-09-26 07:18:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Susan_Hennessey When has she “ever” made statements like this?? I notice you never mention @SpeakerPelosi mentioning her faith in God. 😏

1309629900131725312 2020-09-26 07:04:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @haveaconcern @KeilKyle 😂😂😂 Yup.

1309626059734695937 2020-09-26 06:49:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @nascarred14 @Nick_Clamorgan I have the same question. My fear is @realDonaldTrump may not be re-elected and all the corruption will be swept under the rug never to be heard about again. 😳

1309622678047784960 2020-09-26 06:35:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler It will be extremely interesting to see what they accuse her of. We already know @SenFeinstein will harp on her religious beliefs. How horrid that “inclusive” Democrat politicians slam people for their political beliefs. 🙏
1309621729057148929 2020-09-26 06:32:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> Thank you @Joy_Villa !!! Hopefully, your words can be a rallying cry for all the other conservative entertainers to make their stand. I have a feeling there are a vast number out there. Thank you  🙏 #ConservativeEntertainers.
1309620857904402432 2020-09-26 06:28:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Joy_Villa @THR @WhitlockJason God bless U 4  speaking out 4 all the entertainers who R afraid 2 speak out &amp; 4 demanding the civil rights act of 1964 B expanded 2 include political affiliation. U have much more at stake than I but as a BG actor I do not even speak of my conservative views. Thank you. ❤️
1309616625839087616 2020-09-26 06:11:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> The liberal MSM continually down play the discarded ballots that are found in various states. @CNN states “...handful of ballots....” IMO when you have “handful” in many locations it is wide spread. People don’t seem to realize this affects many “local” elections also.

1309543113866715136 2020-09-26 01:19:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> And it continues. First @HillaryClinton said @JoeBiden should not concede no matter what and now @SpeakerPelosi is saying @JoeBiden should not debate @realDonaldTrump . This is horrendous!!  @GOPChairwoman    https://t.co/gcnFySpKRX
1309541337813770240 2020-09-26 01:12:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AllieRaffa @JoeBiden I am getting sick &amp; tired of @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris disregarding reporters &amp; American citizens. Why R they not taking actual questions from reporters? Why R they not doing interviews with all media stations like @realDonaldTrump does. What R they hiding? @GOPChairwoman
1309539380759945216 2020-09-26 01:04:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @retweetme2020 @JDPotts2 Did she actually say that? Would love to have the source so I can push that out. Thanks,

1309536886109560833 2020-09-26 00:54:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ChrisMurphyCT @statnews Like @MikeBloomberg paying off the fines of 35,000 felons so they can vote. Are you ok with that happening.  Also, California has become a one party majority control state. Are you against that?
1309536276337446914 2020-09-26 00:52:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @bahiawilson @ewarren Do you know what the composition of the Taylor Grand Jury was? I don't but curious if you knew. Thanks.
1309534712671551489 2020-09-26 00:46:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @EveryoneIn_LA I see many comments directed to @EveryoneIn_LA post here but I don't see any responses from @EveryoneIn_LA - Why won't you answer the questions asked by people???
1309534385096388610 2020-09-26 00:45:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @EveryoneIn_LA Really. If you have rent forgiveness who will pay the landlords for the rental property? Who will pay for the maintenance of the rental property. If landlords to not get their rent payments, who will pay the bills the landlords have to pay?
1309518873998143489 2020-09-25 23:43:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @R3Thorns Truth be told, this verse could have and probably have been used in many events in the world through history.
1309506873352056834 2020-09-25 22:55:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @gatewaypundit It will be very interesting to see the outcome of this issue. However, I fear it won’t matter much because far too many powerful people want to keep #voterfraud out of the public view and want to push it isn’t happen. 🤬
1309498877721018369 2020-09-25 22:23:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Coolwiffit @ShaBacksTheBlue I’ve mentioned that point many times.  Local elections can easily be affected by voter fraud and probably is. This use of the term “no widespread” #VoterFraud makes some people think voter fraud isn’t happening. I’m sure it happened in Orange County Calif in 2018.

1309310592914657280 2020-09-25 09:55:45 +0800 <roncarlson1> @KAG45Patriot I see people walking all by themselves with no one anywhere around and people all alone in their cars with windows rolled wearing a mask. It is “their” choice but, to me, they seem like sheep just following a pied piper. 🙁 I am all for wearing a mask when it’s really required.

1309210142467006464 2020-09-25 03:16:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> Does anyone know the figures of virus cases resulting from the rallies being held by @realDonaldTrump ? I have not heard any numbers. Indicating to me, they are either extremely low or none at all.  Thanks in advance. @GOPChairwoman

1309204765042122752 2020-09-25 02:55:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @vaIkyrie2 @reallouiehuey There are many sources. Search "did ginsburg want to lower the age of consent to 12 years old" and you can find them.
1309203935555514368 2020-09-25 02:51:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @jennfranconews I greatly fear that the Durham report will not be concluded and published in time for it to make any difference. If the Democrats should happen to gain power, all of this stuff will be shut down.

Sadly, there are many people who post incorrect information, for whatever reason, that others take as fact. I don't believe this helps anything at all. I believe one should take this into consideration prior to posting just for trolling purposes.
1309202674017996801 2020-09-25 02:46:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @reallouiehuey It's sad some people try 2 bring up very old &amp; proven false statements. What the reason is, I don't know. It's been proven false many times that Ginsburg didn't advocate lowering age of consent to 12. This is just 1 source. There are others.  https://t.co/OsWtKvmw1L
1309199629695688704 2020-09-25 02:34:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @xirritated @Breaking911 So sir, are you saying it's ok to have nine discarded ballots? I am saying it is not okay to have "any" discarded ballots regardless of who those ballots were cast for. It is still voter fraud. Or, did I just misread your comment? Thank you

1309181452458684417 2020-09-25 01:22:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> Whether this is "intention" or "unintentional" this is voter fraud. Meaning voter fraud continues to happen. I don't care if it's the, phase of the day, "widespread" or not. it is voter fraud.
1309179362810368000 2020-09-25 01:14:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @marklevinshow If we look at the 12:00 - 12:20 mark of the attached C-Span video we see he actually stopped &amp; appears to stay there. What worries me is he can barely walk anyway. Way too old maybe????  https://t.co/6TBWLwsWuB

1308863187735982081 2020-09-24 04:17:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Pismo_B @FullyOpenEyes Give me a freaking break. When all the athletes start showing the same kind of support for all the white people killed by black people then I will probably start respecting their causes. I have never seen any celebrities condemn thugs for killing white people. That is racism!!!

1308487715302719488 2020-09-23 03:25:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @whpressscorps - When are you going to have the “reporters” in the gallery show respect for @PressSec and allow her to answer questions before interrupting her constantly?? It shameful. 🙁
1308253698154323970 2020-09-22 11:56:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CalNBC @ShelbyTalcott I am getting so sick and tired of these “protesters.” It’s so bad that #LEO had to declare a state of emergency??? I think the “protesters” are losing their message.
1308243277951283205 2020-09-22 11:14:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump @RSBNetwork I love seeing these Patriots!!

1308233615449362432 2020-09-22 10:36:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> I periodically watch liberal cable news &amp; I hear many pundits keep saying that @realDonaldTrump is dividing America with his hatred. But all I see from a vast majority of liberal left people &amp; media is complete &amp; unfiltered hatred 4 Donald Trump &amp; his supporters. @GOPChairwoman

1308228668859191297 2020-09-22 10:16:35 +0800 <roncarlson1> Thank you @GovRonDeSantis I pray that many other Governors follow in your footsteps.

1308181842651017216 2020-09-22 07:10:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> Every briefing that @JoeBiden gives never covers what he will do for our country if he is elected. He slams Trump, slams Trump, slams Trump. What is #JoeBiden  plan? Does he have a plan. I haven’t heard it yet.  Here is his Wisconsin briefing of 09/21/20.  https://t.co/qwDjaDHpne

1306740215323799552 2020-09-18 07:42:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> @newtgingrich @VDHanson Sadly, most of the MSM’s reputation in in the trash already, IMO. And yesterday’s censorship by @HARRISFAULKNER &amp; @FoxNews of you using #GeorgeSoros name further eroded their reputation. Regardless of how Ms. Faulkner tried to deny it today. It’s a shame.
1306684371156393985 2020-09-18 04:00:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie I knew a couple of states had talked about it, Colorado for one I think, but I was unaware there was an effort to get a bunch of states in on it.
1306684168286294016 2020-09-18 03:59:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie I did, but I have to admit...Listening to the panel and the things they were saying was a bit depressing. I'm so concerned about how things could turn out if the wrong party gets into control of our country. ☹️
1306680526451867648 2020-09-18 03:44:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie People should also be aware of this. This is scary.  https://t.co/dhUEcLImjF

But on another note, if the Democrats in California are going to use the ballot harvesting, how can we not expect the Republicans to do so also? If it were outlawed, no party could use it.
1306663293155553281 2020-09-18 02:36:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CHIZMAGA @FoxNews Is Biden interviewing with FoxNews? I know he has a townhall with #CNN tonight. Sadly, I believe that CNN has already provided him with the questions.

When democrat senators like yourself wud not approve a slimmed down version of a relief packaged because "it wasn't enough" U said American People will get nothing!! Why can't bills be piecemeal? What must they be all or nothing??
1306659599961878528 2020-09-18 02:21:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump We need to get #BallotHarvesting outlawed in California. Sadly, with the super majority liberal politicization this probably won't happen. @DevinNunes @GOPLeader @CAGOP
1306659097207422977 2020-09-18 02:19:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie Thank you!! I also just signed up for the 11:30 meeting. Election Fraud. I didn't know these events existed.
1306658885160198145 2020-09-18 02:18:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd 😳😳😳
1306655326280663040 2020-09-18 02:04:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ClaremontInst Thank you. Viewing last ten minutes now.
1306654668945149952 2020-09-18 02:02:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd Who was the woman?
1306651268224438272 2020-09-18 01:48:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal @kaitlancollins Diane. The clip that people were tweeting out was from back in May at which time she was chastised via twitter already. I routinely watch the press briefings and look to see if anyone removes their masks immediately afterwards. Haven't seen it since May.
1306650112941199361 2020-09-18 01:43:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie Is this an "open" meeting? Can I view? If so, do you have zoom login info?
1306649833269272577 2020-09-18 01:42:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd This appears to be a photo from February 2, 2020. No masks were required at that time.
1306631368034590721 2020-09-18 00:29:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Starnes2David The only #Fox show I trust is Tucker Carlson. #Fox really pissed me off yesterday when the told #NewtGingrich not to mention #Soros My goto channels are @OANN &amp; @Newsy
1306619417762164743 2020-09-17 23:41:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> @newtgingrich - Sir: I just searched your feed and I didn’t see any comment about how #foxnews / #HarrisFaulkner shut you down regarding mentioning #GeorgeSoros Please say you were not forced to not even comment on that. 😢 Thank you.
1306617336850513923 2020-09-17 23:33:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ANC168 @EinsteinsMagic @realDonaldTrump @VP With what China has done to us with the virus, would we really want masks from them?? But I do understand your point.
1306450214333497344 2020-09-17 12:29:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MaggieM46240943 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1306382023574069250 2020-09-17 07:58:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> More dictatorship from Minnesota. How long are you voters going to put up with this????
1306381625605881856 2020-09-17 07:57:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeConchaTV @starrbasket This is so depressing that @JoeBiden can only take predetermined questions from predetermined “reporters” of predetermined news orgs. Does anyone know of @OANN or @foxnews was there? Not that we can rely on @foxnewsdesk anymore. 😡
1306380162821427200 2020-09-17 07:51:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JustCommonSens9 @DNC It seems like they kick out everyone who disagrees with anything on their platform.
1306379880762945538 2020-09-17 07:50:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CityMinneapolis - You asked for this. Now you have it. Why not send your “violence interrupters"?  I worry for the citizens of Minneapolis who voted you people into office. Turns out to maybe be a big mistake? @IlhanMN @Ilhan    https://t.co/TCIzw9xv8L
1306329062428696576 2020-09-17 04:28:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @emfvet78 @DudleyDidrightV @AdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi @JoeBiden She was on @TuckerCarlson last night and @Facebook deleted the interview and @twitter banned her account. Censorship at its greatest. This is what dictators do.
1306328731384913920 2020-09-17 04:26:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal It sure seems like he knew the question before hand. I also noticed him flipping pages on his podium. Was that his notes to the questions??? @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle
1306327793794338816 2020-09-17 04:23:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal Found it. Much thanks
1306326698896445440 2020-09-17 04:18:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal It’s on Foxnews
1306326586140942336 2020-09-17 04:18:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> Biden is flipping through pages on his podium. Did he have these question. Score hand?
1306325817471844352 2020-09-17 04:15:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> There are so few people at the briefing there is an echo in the room!! 😏
1306325485014507520 2020-09-17 04:14:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> Watching Biden on Foxnews right now. Why is he looking at notes to determine who he’s to ask question of?? Is this all staged???
1306323981717258242 2020-09-17 04:08:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal Where is this???
1306323756122435584 2020-09-17 04:07:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> The Democrats @DNC eat their own. #JohnDeberry I hope you win as an independent and then make your way over to the Republican side.
1306323018126249984 2020-09-17 04:04:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @pushforward40 Damm you @Twitter @TwitterSupport - You people are horrible!!!!!!
1306322759371206657 2020-09-17 04:03:10 +0800 <roncarlson1> @9NEWSNANCY @Concealcarrygrl I just watched it via C-span. Did you happen to see any video of the audience? I heard the applause around the 34 minute mark and it did sound like 10 or so people. And again....No questions.
1306321634282758144 2020-09-17 03:58:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeBiden speech 2 Hispanic Heritage Month Event in Kissimmee, Fl. Reads directly fm teleprompter. Again, no video of audience. At the 34.14 mark applause sounds like 10 people. Y don't we C who he's speaking 2? As always. Biden doesn't take questions.  https://t.co/CSpv354tCL

You should B ashamed of yourselves!!!! SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!! U shut @newtgingrich down 4 saying #GeorgeSoros name??? Another reason not 2 watch @Foxnews Thank goodness 4 @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity &amp; #LauraIngraham
1306312097395953664 2020-09-17 03:20:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @PattyCarr19 I don't think he should wear a mask if the situation doesn't call for it. He has worn them before, but to wear one just to appease the naysayers is not who he is. IMO.
1306310821442547713 2020-09-17 03:15:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BillKristol And I see #JoeBiden is going to be interviewed by the hard hitting @CNN on Thursday. Should be a barn burner!!!! And I can't prove it but I'd be willing to bet Biden campaign already has the questions.  🙄
1306304972099706883 2020-09-17 02:52:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JustCommonSens9 I don't doubt this one single bit. I've done a bit of minor research and it's actually been like this for decades. The 4th estate has always done what they can do to sway voters. Only now, it's blatant and no one is trying to hide it.
1306304416836808704 2020-09-17 02:50:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Mommie_03 Oops!!! 😏 This can't be a good thing for @JoeBiden or @KamalaHarris #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020  On a more serious note, hopefully this "alleged" pedophile #JerryHarris will pay heavily for what he allegedly did to those boys and possibly others.
1306301825897775104 2020-09-17 02:39:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Bolen2001 @DianaBialkowski @hodgetwins I saw clip last night him coming off plane waving. Clip continued w/him walking 2 his car &amp; there were no people in area he was waving 2.  Here's the clip.  4 the record, I'm not happy with the woman cackling in the background.   https://t.co/BOP7uhKLgb

1306296322597597185 2020-09-17 02:18:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BobRmhenry1 @ihatethemedia Please please please....When was this briefing done? Is there a source for the full briefing???? Thank you
1306295453395202048 2020-09-17 02:14:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TrumpWarRoom I'm not sure Y U would post a video from May 17th. It "seems" like U R trying to intimate this incident happened today. Here's the clip from 05/17. For the record, I am a die hard Trump supporter. I just don't think we should stoop 2 the level of the MSM  https://t.co/UGYwNS1E7I
1306292671250456578 2020-09-17 02:03:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kimmiintx @Mary620497 @PressSec Valid question. You would think that would realize it but maybe they are just in denial. But then again, are "we" in denial???? 😳
1306292377816948737 2020-09-17 02:02:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @nflnetwork You can take your NFL and take if for a long walk off a short pier. You people disgust me!!! 😡
1306291994868678656 2020-09-17 02:00:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kimmiintx @Mary620497 Every time I watch these briefings it seems to me the "correspondents" are given direction from their bosses to ask about specific things and it seems they all have the same boss. I continually love how @PressSec handles these questions / briefings.
1306289050253361153 2020-09-17 01:49:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ChanelRion @PressSec @OANN Thank you for the heads up. Watching now.
1306270052082094080 2020-09-17 00:33:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump I don’t agree with this manipulated video or with Trump retweeting it. But on that note madam, are you equally upset with Biden’s ad saying Trump made derogatory comments about soldiers. This info was proven wrong but Biden still made the ad.    https://t.co/V5sIAIoSCs
1306268014778544128 2020-09-17 00:25:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> I have not seen or heard of this on MSM but maybe by my retweeting people who would not normally see it now can.  @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @Liz_Wheeler @OANN @IngrahamAngle @ChanelRion @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
1306261485920890886 2020-09-16 23:59:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TylerBlake77 @NormanFBirnberg @KathySchultheis @AndrewHClark @JoeBiden Tyler: why did you have 2B rude on your response? Why couldn’t you just have said “He’ll be doing the interview on Thursday.” 😳 and yes, I now see he has town hall with @CNN I’m hoping 4 some hard hitting questions.
1306260014382936065 2020-09-16 23:53:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SatcherDebi @anonpatriotq @Zappapj I’d wager he had no idea what the lyrics say.
1306106494421622784 2020-09-16 13:43:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BrandonStraka @pcisbs1 I loved that she ended up just walking away. Maybe, just maybe she will go home and realize she was wrong and change her thinking. Hopefully.
1306104816699977730 2020-09-16 13:37:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @NormanFBirnberg @KathySchultheis @AndrewHClark I’m just finished watching the interview (tape delayed) and I agree with you. He did very well. And I don’t think Biden would stand a chance with this type of interview. He said no to Chris Wallace and no to Stephanopoulos.  Why won’t @JoeBiden do real interviews?
1306103761249513472 2020-09-16 13:32:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> @glitchgorl @zaynsfilms @TennerLizzy Understood. I disagree with you on the Blake issue. If I were a cop and the man continuously refused to stop and reached into his car and I had no idea what was in the car I would have shot him multiple times. Many many times 1 or 2 bullets do not stop people.
1306100142928396289 2020-09-16 13:18:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @glitchgorl @zaynsfilms @TennerLizzy You really don’t want a conversation, do you Alex. You and I appear to have totally different views. Perhaps it’s best we just cease tweeting each other. Thanks.
1306095442585743360 2020-09-16 12:59:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @glitchgorl @zaynsfilms @TennerLizzy Alex, if Blake did have a gun in his car he wud have come out shooting just like other criminal did. Are cops supposed 2 wait until the bullet is coming towards them before they defend themselves? Pls do a search on “traffic stops that end in shootings” &amp; C how often it happens
1306094321989369857 2020-09-16 12:55:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @glitchgorl @zaynsfilms @TennerLizzy I apologize if the “U” offends you Alex. I use it to cut down on the character count. That said, I see you didn’t comment on the video. What are your thoughts on that? Thanks

1306067079741796352 2020-09-16 11:07:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> I watched her interview on @TuckerCarlson Twitter has banned her. It would be great if she could get on #Parler
1306059330320359424 2020-09-16 10:36:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi do not care about the American people. The Republicans are offering a quick fix bill right now for the American workers but the Democrats are saying, "....sorry, not enough. It's all or nothing..." The @DNC @TheDemocrats don't care about us!!!
1306058685098029062 2020-09-16 10:33:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @rad_republicans Probably right after he does the no holds barred interview with Chris Wallace like @realDonaldTrump did.  @JoeBiden doesn't have the courage to do any hard interviews. He is afraid!!!!
1306058199741509632 2020-09-16 10:31:54 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SocialismSucs @bill_billjeter @SenDuckworth @realDonaldTrump @RedNationRising It's called gaslighting. and the more they do it, the more their followers fall for it.
1306057943289225216 2020-09-16 10:30:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is the @JoeBiden #JoeBiden democrats want to run our country????? And @KamalaHarris today said "...under the Harris Administration...." 😳

1306056732934717441 2020-09-16 10:26:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepWilson What is really a shame Ms. Wilson is you know for a fact this is totally false yet you still spew it. Shame on you.
1306056304494931968 2020-09-16 10:24:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ReallyKW @marklevinshow @ABC I'll be watching it at 9pm my time. But I also heard they @JoeBiden #JoeBiden #JoeBiden2020 campaign said they "couldn't find a workable time to do a similar interview" (paraphrasing) Just like they couldn't find a time to meet with Chris Wallace. Such bull 💩
1306055824062652416 2020-09-16 10:22:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Sparks80079110 I'll have to check my local home depot and see if they fly the flag also. Thanks for posting
1306054668678701056 2020-09-16 10:17:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @lowery_lalowery @SenDuckworth Lorraine: Have you by chance heard of any COVID out brakes  resulting from any of Trump's rallies? I'm looking for info on that and can't find any. Thanks in advance for your help.
1306054164397436928 2020-09-16 10:15:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RoseOfTheJungle @SenDuckworth Rose: You forgot to mention Child Sex Trafficking &amp; Pedophilia

That said, did U happen 2 C the video I posted about the traffic stop that turned in2 a shooting. Driver escaped officer's grasp, got 2 his car door, reached in &amp; came out with gun firing @ them. #LEO in Blake case had no idea what was in the car.
1306052247118200832 2020-09-16 10:08:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> I have not and will not be watching any professional sports this year. I want to watch sports for the sport not for political commentary. "Especially" when the @NFLMedia #NFL does what is indicated in this Facebook post.   https://t.co/ejk5tl3Dwd

1305893647594872832 2020-09-15 23:38:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DavidWinterTV Every single time I see things like this I move further and further away from #BLM I wonder how many other people in the United States are starting to feel the same way.
1305893025122410497 2020-09-15 23:35:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepCohen Y don't U criticize #HillaryClinton 4 saying #JoeBiden shud not concede election at any cost but U criticize the "possibility" of Trump not standing down when this situation was "never" said by Trump. Reason I don't believe many people is becuz they always talk on only 1 side.
1305891424919928832 2020-09-15 23:29:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LivingOnLiberty @LawrenceBJones3 I saw an interview with @BretBaier and a campaign manager for #Joebiden. Baier asked him that specific question and the man kept dodging the question and never answered it. 🙄

I believe he already doesn’t support #LEO (Just “my” opinion) But I believe he has to think about public perception.  Do you think he actually sees our tweets? 😏
1305731482141351936 2020-09-15 12:53:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> Let’s see if @KingJames will do this.   https://t.co/CGeIBaCa4P

I can’t find anything relating to it on the internet but then again, I am not well versed in ways to search for things in the internet. Thank you in advance for your answer.
1305593195275808768 2020-09-15 03:44:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ivanka4trump @LawrenceBJones3 I agree Ivanka, and that would be my point. We only seen him in the mornings and early afternoons.

1305575682081042432 2020-09-15 02:34:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LawrenceBJones3 #JoeBiden doesn't take question. The cameras "never" show the audience that he is speaking to. #JoeBiden is always speaking straight ahead. Never takes his eyes off the teleprompter. I have not seen any briefing by #JoeBiden that happens after the late afternoon. Why???
1305573855000313856 2020-09-15 02:27:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal and if not for the outstanding medical capabilities of our EMTs, Doctors and nurses, how many more of these shooting victims would have died??
1305570309077041153 2020-09-15 02:13:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> Why do we "never" see any of the audience at these briefings by #JoeBiden ????

These fires did not start becuz of Climate change. They started becuz of very bad people. They continued becuz of dense growth in these forests. IMO obviously becuz I'm not a professional.
1305233342082682880 2020-09-14 03:54:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MayorOfLA - Sir: I viewed Ur twitter feed &amp; U only had 1 tweet about the @LAPDHQ offices who were ambushed last night. But U have not mentioned 1 thing about the "people" protesting outside the hospital saying "...we hope they die..." How on earth can U not comment on that??

1305223051043155968 2020-09-14 03:13:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @mchooyah I'm totally against this idea. Why shud America cave 2 these people. Keep the Anthem &amp; when enuf "fans" decide not 2 watch games, league officials will realize the mistake they made. If they take away the National Anthem, they have no chance at all of getting me back as a fan.

For all the wrongs that David says Trump did, all he came back with was statement in the interview with Bob Woodward. David: is there anything Trump did that you agree with?
1305003374719377408 2020-09-13 12:40:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump We must, every single one of us, ensure we do not stay home on Election Day and we get out and vote for Donald J Trump as President for 2021. And vote Republican across the board!!!!!

With respect to the violation of federal tax law why hasn’t he been prosecuted? And,  not that it justified it but many Pols have been accused of violating tax laws. i.e. Omar.

IMO, not kneeling during Anthem doesn’t mean a person is racist or doesn’t support the real #BLM.

What’s also sad is that it seems any1 who chooses 2 express views, such as Mayfield, R “slammed” 4 their views.
1304929507120308225 2020-09-13 07:46:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge Do you think the out come of the election would have any affect in this trial happening? I may be paranoid but am concerned a Democrat win in 2020 would mean the trial never happens. Truly hoping I’m wrong.

1304203366067662848 2020-09-11 07:41:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> Watch MSM harp all over that Pres Trump just said “September 3rd” instead of “November 3rd” just now at his Mich rally. It will be their next “gotcha” moment. 😂😂

That said, U asked if I take same offense by burning, anarchy &amp; looting. Valid question I guess, but did U view my profile? I'm totally conservative, supporting #MAGA 100%. Tks.

Listening to @PressSec briefings (tape delayed) &amp; the majority of reporters continually ask gotcha questions. i.e. someone asked “with the Pres talking about ending wars when this announcement is just a drawdown, not a withdrawal?” They expect immediate pullout??

1303523546702868481 2020-09-09 10:40:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> Amazing. I am watching #LastWord with Lawrence O’Donnell and #JohnKerry discuss report on what Trump supposedly said, which 21 people on record denied and they don’t even mention the 21 people denying it, at all!!!
1303518491836739586 2020-09-09 10:20:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am watching @TuckerCarlson (recorded) and he is tearing up Jeff Zucker of CNN and Michael Cohen. He will continue tearing up CNN tomorrow night as he goes after Cuomo’s interview process!!

I'm just getting tired of people with a lot of followers &amp; even people with a few followers posting only portions of things. It happens all 2 often. What's wrong with giving people all the info? Just like people say things, but don't provide sources.
1303421183749050368 2020-09-09 03:53:21 +0800 <roncarlson1> What disgusts me about @gatewaypundit is the way Jim Hoft provides small clippets of videos hoping 2 sway people 2 his way of thinking.

1303069309011329024 2020-09-08 04:35:07 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realredtarget Understood. Thanks.
1303067081147953153 2020-09-08 04:26:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @WorthRisdon @realredtarget I noticed that. I’m guessing much more comfortable than heels.
1303066938457821184 2020-09-08 04:25:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realredtarget Just curious Buck. What would you have her do? No sarcasm intended, serious question. Thanks.
1303066481580597248 2020-09-08 04:23:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JackArnett11 @realredtarget My pleasure Jack. I have always felt that if I make any comments I should put my name to it. I don’t know why people won’t sign their name to what they say. It’s a shame, IMO.
1303055932012675072 2020-09-08 03:41:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> Great questions. @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @ericswalwell - Will any of you people answer these questions??
1303052648656990210 2020-09-08 03:28:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1patriotjeep I'm thinking they weren't allowed at the airport because there were no supporters for Pence's arrival either. I'm hoping to see video of their stops while in WI.
1303051569580056577 2020-09-08 03:24:38 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal I can't find any information where he has been "convicted" or any violations.
1303047400638967808 2020-09-08 03:08:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal Yup. He was arraigned from his hospital bed on September 4th.   https://t.co/7jefeLyYOS

1303046014287323136 2020-09-08 03:02:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realredtarget I guess to be fair though, there were no fans when Pence arrived either. Hopefully, we'll see some gatherings later in their visit.   https://t.co/bOIExMoAkS
1303044581169135617 2020-09-08 02:56:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realredtarget I just replied with the video. Probably the same one you saw. Thanks
1303044425665269762 2020-09-08 02:56:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realredtarget I found this on the twitter machine.  https://t.co/6i0d1gic7G

1302953499215372289 2020-09-07 20:54:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @q_anon_patriots And in addition to that, if they want to change it right now, why can't the tell people to "request" an absentee ballot? There is time.

What the heck is wrong with you?? I did a search on your claim and couldn't find anything. Why won't you provide a source????? 🙄
1302310009913499649 2020-09-06 02:17:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @yogagenie @CitizenSe7en Then in my opinion, the entire @dallascowboys organization can take a long walk off a short pier.

The chance was there for a female Democrat nominee to be their choice but not enough on the Dem side voted for them. I don’t know why. I’m not sure if my response was in sync with your comment though. I may have sidetracked. 😳
1302066096871071745 2020-09-05 10:08:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 @hsinamk @PeteButtigieg @CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews 1/2.. Idisagree. We get 2 vote 4 person who makes it through primaries. I don’t know if party big wigs actually make the decision or not but that’s what we get. The DNC had many women candidates &amp; none of them made it. Last two standing were 2 old white guys. What does that say?

Unfortunately, IMO this neither confirms nor denies its fact. I’m suspicious of “anonymous sources” especially if they are “former administration officials.” What do they have to lose by putting their names to their statements. ...
1302050308466511873 2020-09-05 09:05:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 - I think I’m all caught up on responding to comments that asked for comments. Pls let me know if I missed any. And 4 the record, I don’t respond to people that start cussing and being non civil. That’s not directed at you but at those who are like that.
1302049580784123904 2020-09-05 09:03:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 I’m back. We don’t know each other wry well at all but rest assured I don’t make comments like that. I don’t stereotype liberals or conservatives or anyone. 👍🏻

I like much rust he has done. I am very much conservative and worry deeply about liberal policies. That is who I am.

1301986691478036480 2020-09-05 04:53:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 Will respond later. About to partake in one of my past times.
1301984986338213888 2020-09-05 04:46:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 I’m sorry to hear about the 80% disability. Sad to hear that but I hope it’s military related and our get that benefit. I’m actually 50%. Hearing.

Based on what the CCP virus did 2 our country I think the comeback is very good. I think if other cities/states opened up it wud B better. I cud B proven wrong but now I think it’s good &amp; getting better.

1301980913119584256 2020-09-05 04:30:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 I'm pretty sure our politics don't align, but I'm following you anyway for possibly civil discussion. I do follow a few people where we completely disagree but we do have civil discourse. Hoping for same here.👍

And Trump immediately stated it was false. But I'll bet not one apology comes from anyone.  Start @ 51st minute of this clip.  https://t.co/7FTPIEJweg
1301979568476049409 2020-09-05 04:24:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 @PeteButtigieg @CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump 1/2.....And I can understand your point of view. Trump is not a politician. If people jump all over him and lie about him and disparage him he does not take it sitting down. Maybe not presidential but I support him on this.  Perfect example @AP posted a false story that....

1301977564311744512 2020-09-05 04:16:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CoryBooker Mr. Booker. Please see this clip starting at the 51st minute mark. Note: 4 anonymous say he said it. 10 sources go on record saying he didn't along with an email proving @AP was wrong. Will you apologize for jumping on the bandwagon without verifying?   https://t.co/Plga5tBWWl
1301977050589192192 2020-09-05 04:14:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Grandmascooki10 @PeteButtigieg @CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your reply ma'am. I could agree the comment abut Mrs. Kahn was very inappropriate.  You didn't comment on my remark about Trump not taking the comments against him without fighting back. You still don't believe he should have done that?
1301974093504196608 2020-09-05 04:03:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> Amazing breakthrough in Serbia / Kosovo agreement.  https://t.co/Plga5tBWWl

I did not criticize him 4 disparaging the father of the solider killed. Trump didn't disparage the soldier. The father disparaged Trump &amp; Trump came right back at him.   https://t.co/ik5AH1Q0Ds
1301960687061594112 2020-09-05 03:09:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @PeteButtigieg @CNN @MSNBC I wonder if all of you people who are jumping all over @realDonaldTrump about this, will come back later and apologize when you find out it is a false story. I know you won't but I'm hoping to be surprised. For me: If I find it true, I will slam him whole heatedly on twitter.
1301960219069575168 2020-09-05 03:08:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> @hfields366 @californiapatr2 I just heard on @DailyLimbaugh that this is happening. I sure wish the people of Utah would recall @MittRomney  He is no longer a Republican and does not represent them anymore. 😡
1301959470302416896 2020-09-05 03:05:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @MZHemingway I just heard on @DailyLimbaugh right before he signed off, that Bolton said "...Trump never said it. If he had it would have been in my book." I'm paraphrasing.  I can't find on twitter or Parler yet proof that he said it but I did here it on Rush Limbaugh
1301954206610239488 2020-09-05 02:44:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @larryelder If this is true, it is great. However, I don't believe polls when they say Trump is losing and I won't believe polls when they say he is ahead. I will believe the poll conducted on 11/03/2020. Thanks,

1301953094683508738 2020-09-05 02:39:41 +0800 <roncarlson1> Mr. President (@realDonaldTrump ) @starsandstripes  I'm a 29 yr retired Navyman &amp; just want 2 express my displeasure on hearing the S&amp;S will B shut down.

1301004030177468422 2020-09-02 11:48:26 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TXDeplorable45 @PricePrice999 I did a search on this and found nothing. Why the heck would you make a statement like this without a source to back it up?  Where did you get your information? Are you lying just to start trouble?
1301000395335102465 2020-09-02 11:34:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> @fotogtom @ZaccardiJamie @RLAVINIA5 @WhiteHouse 1st off Tom: U don’t know 4 a fact that Trump has not read the Bible. U have no proof 1 way or the other. 2nd, presuming U believe &amp; follow God, because U mentioned him, do U believe God condones abortion, which it appears to me many of the liberals do? Do U condone abortion?

1300945367719002112 2020-09-02 07:55:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is your Democrat party. Pushing for unrest in the United States of America. What kind of people are these people???😡
1300944695233634304 2020-09-02 07:52:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TheLeoTerrell @Biedaboo @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews @OANN @newsmax @PARISDENNARD @KatrinaPierson @BlackVoices4DJT I have to admit Mr. Terrell, I had been listening to you for years on @KFIAM640 and never ever in my dreams did I think you would switch from the Democrat Party.  I am blown away, but very glad. Hoping you will be able to bring your 190.7K followers with you.
1300939741869805568 2020-09-02 07:32:59 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BattleBornThom @patriots_twin Awesome song and it’s cool how you can associate it with a specific event in your life.  My song was when we were sailing back from the Middle East on the USS Independence and they played “Coming to America” by Neil Diamond.
1300939105006743559 2020-09-02 07:30:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Nomi_Yukiz @Sparks80079110 You should be able to block them shouldn’t you?
1300938509600067584 2020-09-02 07:28:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JustCommonSens9 @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @CuomoPrimeTime @donlemon @NicolleDWallace @ReliableSources @maddow @JoeNBC @morningmika @CNN @MSNBC Yup. 😏
1300938375059431424 2020-09-02 07:27:33 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SLITHEY22TOVE @CBS_Herridge I’m just letting my mind run free here but do you think maybe JFK was not part of the deep state back in early ‘60’s?
1300937414983258112 2020-09-02 07:23:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CountryTisOThee @JiveBunnyMuzik 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1300883936625606656 2020-09-02 03:51:14 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge The deep state runs deep indeed. 😡
1300883690201837568 2020-09-02 03:50:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @kyleolson4 So true.
1300883610463993857 2020-09-02 03:49:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @1blantdaddy @Isabelagrana2 This is so true.
1300883301268299776 2020-09-02 03:48:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @lleansright - I like your pinned tweet. It is so very true.
1300882154302222337 2020-09-02 03:44:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @richiecastaldo @ReaganBattalion @realDonaldTrump Real classy Richard. @realDonaldTrump touring damage done by rioters in your state and you get snarky. You should be ashamed of yourself. 😏
1300881788139528197 2020-09-02 03:42:42 +0800 <roncarlson1> @richiecastaldo I’m curious sir? How can you be for “defendlife” and “abortion” at the same time?
1300881114190340096 2020-09-02 03:40:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> Reparations my a$$!!! California liberals are pushing for reparations. This is so totally wrong IMO.    https://t.co/pRqjVRga47
1300880289258897409 2020-09-02 03:36:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> This is just some of the crap that happens in California when you have super majority liberal party control. We must get these people out of office and turn California at least purple if not Republican majority. Liberals are killing our state. 😡  https://t.co/yRsp68iRZN
1300840095847559168 2020-09-02 00:57:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @NPR Maybe I’m misreading many of these replies but all Trump said was (paraphrasing here). “...based on the video we all saw it looks like it was self defense but we are investigating it...” He didn’t condemn and he didn’t say the guy was not guilty.
1300835861102125056 2020-09-02 00:40:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ShelbyTalcott You know darn well that is not what he intimated. 😏
1300834877013516289 2020-09-02 00:36:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Sabrina67408695 @DudleyDidrightV @BreitbartNews All these cities and states with no bail release are contributing to the rapid increase in crime and no bail release must be stopped!! 😡
1300834356999548928 2020-09-02 00:34:13 +0800 <roncarlson1> @2Badhon I don’t need your advertisements. I’m blocking you  😡
1300832740191862786 2020-09-02 00:27:48 +0800 <roncarlson1> @evalovesLA @InGodIDoTrust They get passed because the liberals in California have a liberal super majority and the liberals do. It care about the children or the average citizens. It sucks!! 😡
1300832406602047488 2020-09-02 00:26:28 +0800 <roncarlson1> @InGodIDoTrust @BetseyAdams1 We must turn California red and stop this crap. Liberal politicians care more about criminals, including sex offenders, child sex predators than they do about children. 😡    https://t.co/0yEwx2wzzk
1300673804813787136 2020-09-01 13:56:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Destiny3650 @c_siera 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1300673625763184642 2020-09-01 13:55:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> Hey Joe and Kamala. (@JoeBiden &amp; @SenKamalaHarris)    @LisaMarieBoothe has very valid question. Why didn’t you bring this up at your big convention? You people are so hypocritical.
1300672827624890368 2020-09-01 13:52:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ - Hope this helps you catch these a-holes
1300671945428484097 2020-09-01 13:48:51 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LLinWood @jimboazil @realDonaldTrump I am so wicked proud or @realDonaldTrump   My President!!!  And to you Mr. Wood, thank you for helping #KyleRittenhouse !!!
1300670314188140544 2020-09-01 13:42:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @celtics Just so the @celtics org is aware, although you probably don’t care because I’m just one person, I’ve been lifelong @Celtic fan. But until #NBA stops kissing a$$ of #China and #BLM you’ll get no support from me.
1300668867442692097 2020-09-01 13:36:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Anticomm19 @michellemalkin @realDonaldTrump W Smith: here’s 1 of many instances of what can happen if a perp is able 2 get into their car when LEO is trying apprehend them. I’d love UR comments on this please. I’ve sent this 2 some others who say the cops R bad but no 1 has commented on this. 🙁  https://t.co/9Gqj25FSSw
1300667696065904642 2020-09-01 13:31:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RLAVINIA5 @fotogtom @ZaccardiJamie @WhiteHouse And IMO, it’s proof positive it is the “deep state” #NWO maybe that is doing this because it started as soon as he beat HRC. He wasn’t even in office yet!!!😳
1300667078907555840 2020-09-01 13:29:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RLAVINIA5 There has been talk about the Insurrection Act but I don’t think Trump will go that far.
1300666743736528896 2020-09-01 13:28:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RLAVINIA5 @ItsJezMyOpinion @Denechek007 @Destiny3650 You may be right. I think the administration is looking into this. Sadly, if Trump and the Republicans do not maintain political control all of these investigations will go away and everything will be swept under the rug. 😳
1300666216671883266 2020-09-01 13:26:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RLAVINIA5 @YouTube I just got back to your posts. Reading them now.
1300664172133277696 2020-09-01 13:17:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ilikepatterns @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler It’s like the liberal policy was on illegal immigrants crossing the border. “Catch and Release.”
1300617595461292032 2020-09-01 10:12:53 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ForAmerica @Reversequestion @PressSec I would be very interested to know how many liberals watch these briefings.
1300616720294572033 2020-09-01 10:09:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> I will be voting in person.
1300613473496428545 2020-09-01 09:56:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> @TrumpWarRoom @ChanelRion I thought this was an edited clip. It I had watched the briefing (tape delayed) and this is an actual portion of it. No editing done. And the signer appears to have an issue signing what Biden is trying to say.
1300612076377784320 2020-09-01 09:50:57 +0800 <roncarlson1> #RogerGoodell  can take a long walk off a short pier for all I care. 😡
