1343631754222067713 2020-12-29 02:55:48 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> This year my family received Al Sultan Sweets as a gift from one of our neighbour's. Straight from the UAE and dangerously moreish...
1343558931688402944 2020-12-28 22:06:26 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> When I was 19 someone I was dating for a while proposed as a route to becoming a British resident. Not unusual. I said No.
1343556739136970752 2020-12-28 21:57:43 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Indeed. Expected ethical standards of public office holders should be upheld through codified laws if nothing more.
1343530231420907520 2020-12-28 20:12:23 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> A sign of the times and a good indicator of what's to come in 2021...

1343166710531190784 2020-12-27 20:07:53 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> The UK will no longer participate in the Erasmus exchange scheme according to the post Brexit deal. Not a route to 'levelling up'.
1343155403304136704 2020-12-27 19:22:57 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Good advice. Agree with this. Sadly in my community people do not want hear anyone else's problems as they have too many of their own.

1342774285920858112 2020-12-26 18:08:31 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @nfmusic I was wondering the same. I grew up on Callas amongst others.
1342772711098036224 2020-12-26 18:02:16 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> I have so many families forming around productions... It's not unusual that people get close when working together in this industry.

1341443337107234817 2020-12-23 01:59:49 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Just received credit vouchers for cancelled flights earlier this year. It took almost 9 months. I must have the patience of a saint.
1341382378749628417 2020-12-22 21:57:35 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @mmegannnolan it is and society makes you feel as if being single is outdated. i'll read your book. Can I get hold of a copy beforehand?

1341339946339201024 2020-12-22 19:08:58 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Sad fact that all the messages bar one today have been sent by text/ whatsapp/LinkedIn/FB and I have only received one call so far.

1341333194398961664 2020-12-22 18:42:08 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> One for our PM to consider: years of oppressive rule were brought to an explosive end in Romania when the nation's tyrannical leader Nicolae Ceaucescu was ousted by a rebellion led by his once-loyal army, on Dec 22 1989. It was more than 20 years b4 Ceaucescu met his comeuppance.

1339521562106613762 2020-12-17 18:43:22 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> The pandemic can be compared to the Iceberg A-68, a giant iceberg adrift in the South Atlantic, having calved from Antarctica's Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017. I no longer believe our politicians were not aware of the pandemic well in advance. The A-68 is on a collision path.

1338767294294536193 2020-12-15 16:46:10 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> It's going to be a 70 hour working week for me this week. Not my idea of pre-Xmas fun.
1338762678446280704 2020-12-15 16:27:50 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Pleased to learn the TV detective @mwilliamsthomas who we are collaborating with on a number of TV shows has joined the hunt for man missing for 23 years after walking into toilet  https://t.co/Lp0iMa9w7k
1338522888912166917 2020-12-15 00:34:59 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> London Elevated to Tier 3 COVID-19 Restrictions, Cinemas Set to Close Again  https://t.co/HXzEYiF7M2 via @variety
1338103521170907137 2020-12-13 20:48:34 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> As a business owner I will not hold meetings with anyone arriving from another country unless I am certain that you have met the rules within the jurisdiction where you reside and comply with UK safe Covid rules for business.
1338103518905954305 2020-12-13 20:48:34 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Let me be clear on our approach to holding meetings with anyone coming to London from abroad; just because we are all working from home does not mean we are not aligning ourselves with UK Covid rules.
1338069433969946624 2020-12-13 18:33:07 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> We have deadlines this week.
1338068951595675649 2020-12-13 18:31:12 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> What do you think I'm doing today? Well I'm working on a tender.
1338051780270231552 2020-12-13 17:22:58 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> To add to the below I didn't renew my membership of the Tory party after Margaret Thatcher died.
1338051313729490944 2020-12-13 17:21:07 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Not only that the politicians at the highest level were incredibly disparaging to anyone who wasn't one of them or didn't fit into their mould. That's why I am no longer a member of the Tory party.
1338050246509813764 2020-12-13 17:16:53 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> What is Brexit really all about? Many Brits from another generation despise anyone who isn't really from here... let's face it. It's ingrained. I spent 5 years in politics and was shocked by the level of nationalistic fervour.
1338045756134060034 2020-12-13 16:59:02 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> The earliest zoom call I've been on during the pandemic with another territory is 5am UK time. This week this is changing to a 7am start... As a UK born national the Brexiteers will be happy to hear that many of us with foreign names will eventually leave this island...
1338042925767401472 2020-12-13 16:47:47 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> I don't know... let's hope so.
1337702588716896257 2020-12-12 18:15:25 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> I haven't achieved anything this year. It's taken a huge effort to achieve so little after doing so much. I don't consider it to be a write-off. However next year new markets await us.
1337522213667409928 2020-12-12 06:18:40 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Merry Christmas!  https://t.co/cnGLhZVi9w
1337334760834822144 2020-12-11 17:53:48 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> It's a pleasure to join the BBC #Diversity Masterclass Briefing this morning.
1337324046472667136 2020-12-11 17:11:13 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Let's not forget the quality of your life depends on the quality of your relationships. Not on your achievements or how rich you are or how clever you are.
1337321616116756480 2020-12-11 17:01:34 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Yesterday I was invited to be on a podcast in the States. Delighted, and look forward to sharing more on that soon.
1337319764524486656 2020-12-11 16:54:12 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> We are living in environments that are sensorially deprived. And this creates a corrective need, for human contact, for face-to-face relationships. Our politicians do not see the damage this is going to have on all generations for years to come.
1337113204057661450 2020-12-11 03:13:24 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @janemerrick23 Do we know in which boroughs?

1335893064498417665 2020-12-07 18:25:00 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Great start to the day with @StoryFutures Many thanks.  https://t.co/C2evS63Bcu

1335635053964128259 2020-12-07 01:19:46 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Regardless of what everyone thinks about what happened in room 2806, the series takes a vivid look at what happened before MeToo.

1335536195405754368 2020-12-06 18:46:56 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Research suggests The Crown's latest outbreak of torrid muckraking is doing little harm to the esteem in which the Queen and most members of her family are held by the programme's viewers according to Caroline Wheeler in today's Times.
1335371014075801606 2020-12-06 07:50:34 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Looking forward to watching the final screening at #Kinoteka tomorrow. @PLInst_London ROCK ‘N’ ROLL EDDIE in the NEW POLISH CINEMA strand. For more, watch the trailer here:  https://t.co/13Gq9CWOek

1334792279333199872 2020-12-04 17:30:53 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @WomeninMarketin Hello.
1334791800993812481 2020-12-04 17:28:59 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> There's so much talk about supporting female founders. I will believe when I see it...
1334789485129773057 2020-12-04 17:19:47 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Very good news further to the below, most of our development and production is outside of the UK. It's an insurmountable challenge securing commissions in the UK market during the pandemic without broadcaster support.
1334786475603472384 2020-12-04 17:07:49 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> The UK will exempt certain travellers, including “high-value” executives, performing arts professionals and elite sports players, from two-week quarantine according to @FT. TV production staff will also benefit from the new policy announced by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.
1334589890793787394 2020-12-04 04:06:40 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @manori_r She's very cute.
1334589526136811521 2020-12-04 04:05:13 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Finally after weeks of being on a balanced diet I am several kilos lighter.
1334582669921947651 2020-12-04 03:37:58 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Here's my response to the below: For too long attention is continuing to focus on the loudest voices in the room.
1334492521431506944 2020-12-03 21:39:45 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> It's called cowardice.
1334491890524282883 2020-12-03 21:37:15 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> For the first time during the pandemic I was ghosted by someone I knew for ten years. I will never understand why people do this especially anyone in their forties. They should know better. Sadly they don't...

1334471219916247040 2020-12-03 20:15:06 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Essential workers list on the FCO site does not include all roles in TV and entertainment. Is this going to change to align with what the government has said so far?
1334459352791592967 2020-12-03 19:27:57 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Apt.
1334249871814127617 2020-12-03 05:35:33 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @JElmes_TV Yep, was thinking of Discovery+ launches in UK, Ireland with 80 hours of streamer originals. Discovery has rolled out its rebranded streaming service Discovery+ in the UK and Ireland, complete with 80 hours of original programming.

1334212223753969669 2020-12-03 03:05:57 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Great to be involved in awarding excellence in the broadcast media and entertainment industry at the #IABMAwards this year. Thank you for having me @TheIABM

1333888362613272581 2020-12-02 05:39:02 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @jeremy_hume The problem is people have got used the lack of social contact. Not only that the telephone appears to be the most mysterious contraption that no one uses anymore unless it's an emergency or zoom doesn't work.
1333886306859053056 2020-12-02 05:30:52 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> As a single woman in London I can tell you these rules only add to the confusion. What are the rules for relationships in each lockdown tier?  https://t.co/PqNSrpyeQC

1333755230714998785 2020-12-01 20:50:01 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> On Wikipedia it clearly states The Crown is a historical drama. I met the Director years ago, a very humble guy. Our Culture Sec @OliverDowden  should be made aware that there is no formula for success, but there is a formula for failure and that is trying to please everybody.

1322967001430663174 2020-11-02 02:21:27 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @manori_r I would like to know if we as producers with our teams on set are able to move around in the same way as news readers so that any shows we are already in pre production on can be shot under lockdown and can continue uninterrupted. That's a solution &amp; applies we have to travel.

1322933530091945985 2020-11-02 00:08:27 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> This whole lockdown business is getting our of hand. This isn't a case for controlling the virus. And I really wouldn't want to have to opt for BOTOX. The British government needs to get a grip on this and soon.

1318810915693875201 2020-10-21 15:06:39 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> There was a time when I praised our politicians. That time is long gone. Now @stfpictures we look at events through a different lens.
1318809104358494208 2020-10-21 14:59:27 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> I'll be joining the Connected TV World Summit @MediatelNews shortly. See you there.
1318808122882985984 2020-10-21 14:55:33 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Time will only tell whether Jacinda Ardern’s victory for compassionate competence doesn't ultimately result in her playing God:  https://t.co/amYA2VZlqR
1318806732538335232 2020-10-21 14:50:01 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> When politicians start playing God...
1318805286719807488 2020-10-21 14:44:17 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Now, there's a thought.
1318535993218170880 2020-10-20 20:54:12 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> As I joined the Rendez-Vous sessions in French  @canneseries  last week I realised that all those years of learning French have paid off. The next step is to sign up for Advanced French...
1318300137467293698 2020-10-20 05:17:00 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Imposing restrictions on freedom of expression is truly abominable.
1318083602576515072 2020-10-19 14:56:34 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> In one of the worst hit London boroughs after my trip to France. Safer to be in Cannes.
1318079547229831169 2020-10-19 14:40:27 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @JElmes_TV @lgaraude Any idea how many people were in Cannes?

1308189721013751808 2020-09-22 07:41:49 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Uncertainty takes center stage.
1308104046230884360 2020-09-22 02:01:22 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Blaise Pascal once said: Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.
1308051208326778883 2020-09-21 22:31:25 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Agreed. Sensethefuture Pictures positions itself in the same way. We see this as a route to successful collaborations in the broadcast space. Broadcast offers more collab opps than any industry I have previously been in.

1307954451265839109 2020-09-21 16:06:56 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> That's one step too far in the wrong direction: When Hancock was asked whether people should report their neighbours for failing to comply, he said: “Yes.”  Oliver Shah quite rightly said in his piece: businesses must rely on themselves, not this shambolic government, to survive.
1307945161557774337 2020-09-21 15:30:01 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> That's one for the girls... #Emmys @Zendaya Congratulations.

1307661925132754944 2020-09-20 20:44:32 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> The people of Barbados have a view of the Queen that even surprises me. The Queen quite rightly stayed in her palace during the Covid crisis.   I have been to Barbados might I add.
1307600789041557505 2020-09-20 16:41:36 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Got round to watching Bombshell. Watchable but not well crafted. There are men out there who are not aware of the #MeToo movement. I still get asked how I make money. Unless you're an investor looking at a business plan women are not obliged to disclose their earnings to you.
1307437855417958401 2020-09-20 05:54:10 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> I can now say that I have been photographed with three former British Prime Ministers not all at the same time plus the one currently in office when he was Mayor of London. Don't ask me how this came about.

The busiest venue so far has been the pub, the beer garden in fact, last month... as long as I can take a walk/run late in the evening, the curfew does not bother me.

1305998283064606721 2020-09-16 06:33:49 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Almost finished watching The Fall. Currently on Season 3. Not a fan of binge watching... it is the only way to do it.
1305993687252467712 2020-09-16 06:15:33 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Heading into Central London for meetings for the first time since March... I had the pleasure of meeting more people in 5 days in Copenhagen than I did in six months since March in London. Thanks #3daysofDesign. Copenhageners are much happier than Londoners after all.
1305113540655710209 2020-09-13 19:58:10 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Hugely inspired @Elif_Safak: "Not to be able to tell your story, to be silenced and shut out, therefore is to be dehumanized.  It strikes at your very existence; it makes you question your sanity, the validity of your version of events. In losing our voice something in us dies."

1304492356855619584 2020-09-12 02:49:48 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Farewell Diana Rigg. Her role in Mother Love was one her best performances. #RIPDianaRigg
1304322684101242880 2020-09-11 15:35:35 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @sueperkins Loved this. How do I get a hold of you? Who is your agent?

1303821109641576450 2020-09-10 06:22:31 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Is anyone attending BCWW 2020? Could you tell me how you access the showcases?
1303767144681926664 2020-09-10 02:48:04 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @Bob_josey :)

1303713797941719040 2020-09-09 23:16:05 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> UK PM believes we should limit social contact as much as possible. Not good for business to limit social contact just because a number of people are incapable of following the rules and get on the tube without face coverings etc. Noticing the differences between Denmark &amp; the UK.
1303712566418563072 2020-09-09 23:11:12 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> Our local dentist will not see anyone unless it is an emergency appointment. What about anyone who hasn't had a regular check-up for over six months due the pandemic?
1303399056090202113 2020-09-09 02:25:25 +0800 <PotockaTeresa> @JElmes_TV Great.
