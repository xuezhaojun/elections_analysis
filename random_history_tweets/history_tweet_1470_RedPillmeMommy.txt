1314180230479859712 2020-10-08 20:25:57 +0800 <RedPillmeMommy> @EricVitner @catturd2 You can call Trump alot of things, but a coward he is not. Maybe you were thinking of Biden. TDS confuses people.
1314176621042163712 2020-10-08 20:11:37 +0800 <RedPillmeMommy> @TocRadio @DailyCaller I wouldn't either. Questions would probably be pre recorded and given to Biden ahead of time.
1314145059722461184 2020-10-08 18:06:12 +0800 <RedPillmeMommy> @Fritzmania @Julio_Rosas11 I thought it was a gutsy move. I'm not sure I would have had your composure with what was happening. I just hope you had something behind that fence if things escalated. #FIGHTBACK

Biden can't remember where he is or what he's done in the last 24 hrs. You can't believe he could handle being President. You choose to ignore the obvious. TDS does that to your kind. MAGA
