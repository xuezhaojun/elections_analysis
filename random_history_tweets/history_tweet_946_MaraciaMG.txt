1337182147820613632 2020-12-11 07:47:22 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ott_deb That‚Äôs what Rush was saying today. Obama is still calling the shots and he wants Harris as president. That‚Äôs why the ok was given to the media to cover the Hunter Biden story

1336793553528377345 2020-12-10 06:03:14 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Brnchiggins1 @agentm0m This suit is saying that these states changed their election laws through their judicial or executive branches, not their legislators. If states change laws correctly or at all, no need to worry

1314382839727742981 2020-10-09 09:51:03 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @t1dcutiepods The governor of Virginia enacted a law that lets the mother decide AFTER birth if she wants the baby or not. The medical staff would keep the child comfortable pending her decision.

1310416785490014209 2020-09-28 11:11:22 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @PoliticsPoorly @chicagotribune If Trump‚Äôs kids did anything close to that, the MSM would be hyperventilating with non stop coverage. Biden‚Äôs family have become millionaires feeding off of his name
1310371277971038209 2020-09-28 08:10:32 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune And Biden used his political position to enrich his entire family. Still waiting to read a Tribune article on this. Of course since you just endorsed Biden because Trump is ‚Äúmean‚Äù I won‚Äôt be holding my breath

1309289292330606594 2020-09-25 08:31:07 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @taranto_peter Because of what Tucker just said to her

1309140119438360580 2020-09-24 22:38:21 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @StevenKJohnson At least Trump doesn‚Äôt supply the ‚Äúinterviewers‚Äù with the questions beforehand and doesn‚Äôt answer by way of a teleprompter
1309135378339819522 2020-09-24 22:19:31 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @jonwchgo @TheDarthXander @chicagotribune And Hillary said Biden should not concede under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Where‚Äôs the Tribune on this?
1308963860129501190 2020-09-24 10:57:58 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @romellcummings Nope not at all. Peaceful is not looting, throwing objects at cops, arson, or shooting cops as just happened in Louisville

1307109497979187200 2020-09-19 08:09:23 +0800 <MaraciaMG> Republicans are way too nice. The democrats would a appoint a SCOTUS  in a heartbeat if the situation were reversed #Tucker

1306796559963742208 2020-09-18 11:25:53 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune And if Biden had been president he would never have closed our border to China or Europe because that would have been xenophobic. Of course Biden can‚Äôt remember what happened today much less 9 months ago....fool!
1306795082134302723 2020-09-18 11:20:01 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune Trump also spoke about it at the State of the Union Address. You know the speech that Pelosi ripped up?
1306794740311089152 2020-09-18 11:18:39 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune On January 24 the Senate held a briefing on the coronavirus while the House was in the middle of impeachment proceedings. At the same time Pelosi said the briefing was just ‚Äúa distraction‚Äù from the impeachment.
