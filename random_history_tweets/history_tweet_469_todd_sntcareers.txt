1343425614821339138 2020-12-28 13:16:40 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Hebrews 11:1 (NIV)
1343424575049248770 2020-12-28 13:12:32 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CodeMonkeyZ @Mike_Pence To just be honest, given recent responses of those that some looked up to the last couple months...I'm not sure as many are aware that should be...it's like a light was turned on and roaches scrambled to hide.  Truth begats truth, deception is the only alternative

1343414074911109122 2020-12-28 12:30:49 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Barnes_Law @thevivafrei fwiw, imo it's more of disinfo to claim or discount the reality or extent of cyber infiltration throughout.  It's a dangerous and absolute false position to take if extent is unknown.  You both take a position of away, that isnt a credible basis of stance
1343412353010958336 2020-12-28 12:23:59 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> I haven't seen any statements or evidence of repeal 230...need more...  https://t.co/268QYGJE3u
1343405582120792065 2020-12-28 11:57:04 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> -just recently it seemed encouraging that he was pro-trump anti-pork bill speech -now...even though some out of his financial realm see success within the fight -he is saying there's no chance... Right is right, wrong is wrong, not a Rollercoaster pov
1343405580204068864 2020-12-28 11:57:04 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> To all @Cernovich followers, I just decided to un-follow him for these reasons/personal ideals;  -He did chose to get out &amp; drive to Arizona to protest for a valued reason -info turned sour and he went on vid to say f-u for criticism of him laying low...
1343396258728198144 2020-12-28 11:20:01 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CodeMonkeyZ I def thought the same but hoped that most would fully read the statement..however the most popular voices started to immediately tuck tail..and concede..unbelievable to me that some would use their given influence to publicly give up. u can't lead from behind, only from in front
1343394095029514240 2020-12-28 11:11:25 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CaptFancyPantz @brendabejot @Hagstrom_Anders Thanks for the like, I choose to disagree with the grift that's being attempted at the moment.  There's popular figures unhappy that he signed it, but there's middle class folks glad that he did. He invoked truth, if it's not followed out then we should decide then...
1343392473431859202 2020-12-28 11:04:59 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Y'all gonna stand up for the impoundment control act of 1974?  Kinda seems as like it was agreed upon in @POTUS statement...he's kept his promises, your going to hold up ur end huh...u said it before campainging #promisesmade #PromisesKept
1343389465042104320 2020-12-28 10:53:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @toddstarnes It's not there decision or their choice even...it's ours.  This is an opportunity for voices to be heard.  If reps seek longevity as such in their current roles.  They will represent us. Period

1343386554778181638 2020-12-28 10:41:28 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Cernovich It's not entirely fair, given your influence, to take a stance like this without expressing consideration of other aspects of a deal being made.  I completely support ur films, hoaxed (the Christmas show) and ur part in @PATPmovie but this dismissal position seems off imo
1343385344427905025 2020-12-28 10:36:39 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Cernovich 1/2 To be honest, at times I'm not entirely sure where u stand, not that u have to tell twitterverse where u stand.  I'm not a constitutional atty, however the statement as written seems to be made in good faith with precedent noted. I choose to remain optimistic for our country  https://t.co/ifa3YzZ3BT

1343380273510162434 2020-12-28 10:16:30 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Anyone reacting saying @realDonaldTrump caved is wrong.  Read the damn statement and precedent noted...my goodness, patriots cannot only stand when there's positive vibes, route urself in the understanding of what and why things happen the way they do
1343379004892577793 2020-12-28 10:11:28 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @jackflak @Hagstrom_Anders Read his statement...look up the invocation of precedent...he redlined it

1343376979370913792 2020-12-28 10:03:25 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @RealMattCouch @realDonaldTrump statement actually defines that, sending "redlined" spending bill back to congress.  MSM is not focusing on the full scope, surprise surprise

1339449556816244736 2020-12-17 13:57:14 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SenJohnKennedy @BillCassidy  Do not disenfranchise our choice to vote for you.  Bc those of us that stepped out to vote for you will absolutely raise cane if some did so "at risk of covid" as we were led to believe.  STAND UP FOR US!!!!
1339448425436340224 2020-12-17 13:52:45 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> I've been encouraged for some time by @SenJohnKennedy, to be honest I voted for @BillCassidy without researching him at all.  However I feel if either one does not support my voice (and I know i am speaking for many), ill be the loudest voice seeking a candidate that does.
1339447184106905605 2020-12-17 13:47:49 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> I emailed both of my senators today @BillCassidy @SenJohnKennedy asking them to stand up and not stand by and let this just play out.

1339435137222762496 2020-12-17 12:59:56 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> In collegiate and national sports most of the public like and accept competition to prove one side prevails over the other through fair contest.  Not with election I guess, it seems some sit back with participation ribbons...wake up...right is right, wrong is wrong. Period
1339434222516383770 2020-12-17 12:56:18 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> 2/2 time voters.  As well as this heightened "minority" voter turn out.  If these individuals trust are broken, there is absolutely no reason to get out and vote again unless trust is rebuilt.
1339434221711085568 2020-12-17 12:56:18 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> 1/2 I just dont get it...those that wanted Biden and/or anti-trump voters, seem absolutely unwilling to look into irregularities in the 2020 general election seem to not realize the detrimental effect this does for independents, some in their same parties, and also possible 1st..

1339428926943326208 2020-12-17 12:35:16 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SenRonJohnson There, I fixed it for you.  "...We need to find out where there are problems and fix it..." FIX IT NOW!!!  Acceptance for "going forward" is accessory to potential criminal activity.  Crazy, I just thought wrong was wrong, and right was right.
1339036705026928642 2020-12-16 10:36:43 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> You would think that if this wasnt fraudulent, biden campaign would speak up and say something about thousands of affidavits issued questioning potential perjury...this is beyond ridiculous.Trump won, listen to the speech again last night. 100% Ambiguous rhetoric

1317678778726961155 2020-10-18 12:07:56 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> #3 but it seems extremely weird for me and my knowledge of it, that this is pulled into focus by the media.  Fwiw, it's ok to question what you're told, no matter who it comes from.  And yes i include myself with that
1317678777237950464 2020-10-18 12:07:56 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> #2 However, from what I gathered at face value was that there was a true push for every American and also every person to simply ask questions of themselves to research and learn for themselves.  Again I'm personally not supporting any extreme or conspiracy type views,

Well...bring on the hate I guess, but here goes.  Initially I was curious about qanon bc of this mess we call year 2020.

Or was it her fault for holding the flag she had? Or was it her fault for not being armed for self defense? I see decent saying she could have impaled the attacker with the flag pole...this is insane

I'm not calling fauci a turkey, just saying
1317648665285152768 2020-10-18 10:08:17 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Chew on this, @realDonaldTrump &amp; @JoeBiden whether you like the candidates or not.  Which candidate has visited your state in the last four years regardless of it being a "red or blue" state?  Let's tally those stats and discuss who truly promotes UNITY
1317646524575326208 2020-10-18 09:59:46 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> #DemocraticParty STOP BURNING OUR MONEY...the media needs to wake up! @SpeakerPelosi she doesn't speak for me, never has never will.

Head-spinning statement imo
1317642802445099008 2020-10-18 09:44:59 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @AngelWarrior321 I get the frustration and am also aggravated about the lack of Barr jumping in, however no immediate response doesn't mean there's not going to be a response.  "Law and order" has its own process, calling for immediate lock up, doesn't help sep us from the lefts typical response

What one person is publicly praised for their achievements and rewards, doesn't allow you to discount their legacy.  I don't even follow NBA, but those that do should help him understand
1317005115023413249 2020-10-16 15:31:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Tonight we basically saw a Trump vs Biden with the @realDonaldTrump &amp; @JoeBiden abc/nbc townhalls.  Yet it did kinda seem as if a debate moderator was there in one of those two.  Hint, it wasn't abc, and @SteveScully regretfully wasn't able to moderate...
1317002293015957504 2020-10-16 15:19:50 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Acosta Why are you so against trump?  U show no balance of opinions at all.  Those that remain unemployed would love to have your so called "essential" job...u seem committed to being unfair to all Americans
1317000336045912070 2020-10-16 15:12:03 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @nataliegwinters @JoeBiden Damn...
1317000020739186688 2020-10-16 15:10:48 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @IvankaTrump YUP!!! See u at the polls...#trump2020
1316999304960217089 2020-10-16 15:07:57 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @blueseaswimmer @TrumpWarRoom I'm not looking to be contentious at all, I just thought it was funny...I actually had to help talk my late ww2 grandfather telling him he wasnt able to drive anymore after he took part in a couple vehicle accidents...#elderabuse
1316996837241462786 2020-10-16 14:58:09 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @blueseaswimmer @TrumpWarRoom Well to be fair, I retweeted this and said what I did bc I thought it was funny to actually hear him say the words I've repeatedly thought to myself many times...I wasn't actually interested in whatever mumbled nonsense might have followed
1316955685876322305 2020-10-16 12:14:38 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden @JoeBiden u want unity right, why not focus ur comments like this to include @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @senatemajldr...split house cant do it alone...right?
1316954429799759873 2020-10-16 12:09:38 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SenFeinstein although I'm sure the "hot mic" moment today might get a lot of attention, and I do not agree with your vote today.  I absolutly commend and appreciate your civility during this #SCOTUS hearing.    You showed true class, thank you
1316942294126395392 2020-10-16 11:21:25 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CottoGottfried As an example, as i am employed by and support my small business employer, I've expressed to all of my employers workers, if u ask off to vote, take your time...no matter the wait in line, im sure the company make it right.  Just go claim ur right and #vote
1316940124849115143 2020-10-16 11:12:47 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CottoGottfried To all...opinions welcome...imo, I would have to hear more, however it seems imo there is a fear on multiple levels to express our independent views...
1316936933239627778 2020-10-16 11:00:07 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> As an American taxpayer, ill back down and still support my Louisiana representatives of congress @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP, I will support repacking her freezer, IF it ultimately leads to helping the American people NOW.  Vote her out!!!!!!  https://t.co/e0Z6ayHOrJ
1316930118116409347 2020-10-16 10:33:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @TrumpWarRoom Thankfully he said it...ive been holding back a bit bc I didn't want to deal with the lash of of me abusing my elders...
1316929130630402049 2020-10-16 10:29:06 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> To @realDonaldTrump, I like John Maxwell &amp; ive read dozens of his books. A key principle point in his books defines leadership as a very simple common sense point, "leadership is influence."  IMO Mr. President, simply put, you show more to influence for U.S. daily vs @JoeBiden
1316926099838951424 2020-10-16 10:17:04 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @1fullboat Trump was in miami...where was Joe?
1316925532378927105 2020-10-16 10:14:48 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Truth = #youready @realDonaldTrump
1316925063329964032 2020-10-16 10:12:57 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Truth = #LetsGo @realDonaldTrump
1316924909457727489 2020-10-16 10:12:20 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> I know it's been asked, but why is tge biden family not all out there helping @JoeBiden get votes...did Joe abandon or distance himself from hunter?  Contrast @realDonaldTrump full family support.. start whining, let's go
1316921709958713346 2020-10-16 09:59:37 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @anniefreyshow @dbongino Ok @JoeBiden please show your support...GO...we'll wait  I predict if he sees this, if he in all truth knows what Twitter is...we'd all hear crickets chirping waiting his response, or like in his townhall tnitea bigly sigh of when u try an answer a question asked by a young voter
1316918825045164035 2020-10-16 09:48:09 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Wait, didn't @JoeBiden respond in questioning earlier in the week or last week, saying that he would be there waiting in Miami for the 2nd Presidential debate?...he said that.  Fact check this tho @realDonaldTrump was there tonight..#wherewasjoe?
1316916438364467200 2020-10-16 09:38:40 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Rainbow_Whisper @JanMareeSmith2 I dont even live there, but NOOO....Wake up CA
1316915207889948673 2020-10-16 09:33:47 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden townhall starts almost immediately with questions from the audience...@realDonaldTrump townhall starts with #FakeNews debate...horrible, horrible, horrible!
1316913615228854277 2020-10-16 09:27:27 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden i literally just watched a person that asked u a question exhale bigly mid answer...yeah joe, you lost him...#trump2020
1316912852310044673 2020-10-16 09:24:25 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @GStephanopoulos asked audience questioner "did u hear what u needed to hear," audience member response, "I think so" 2nd incoherent biden ramble begins...this is unbelievable...genius move by @realDonaldTrump campaign to give America the direct contrast...#trump2020
1316911176278822913 2020-10-16 09:17:46 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden what are poor schools?  Maybe I heard that wrong...idk
1316907557739499520 2020-10-16 09:03:23 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> just a thought, possible #FakeNews headline prediction, trump townhall was packed with more trump supporters than undecided...#commonsense

1315547846343569409 2020-10-12 15:00:22 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @MrAndyNgo I've never been to Portland, I've never seen anything like this take place...but this isn't the meaning of freedom that our leaders meant.  Just disgraceful.
1315546824392966146 2020-10-12 14:56:19 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @MrAndyNgo Lock em up...this shit needs to stop...recess is over kids, time to understand how the world actually works.
1315545863754838023 2020-10-12 14:52:30 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Yeah this actually happened...and yeah it was held by a US network, CNN, I know...I was just as shocked...indictments for those that disagree, lol. Good lawd...   https://t.co/Az0uQupP6J
1315527392107081728 2020-10-12 13:39:06 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Thanks to the YouTube and cspan, credit due.. regarding trumps recent highly criticized manurisms and public speaking...JUST STOP...granted those that actually watch the video, might notice a similar non-political stance...still upheld today...   https://t.co/sf71bfjYzZ
1315479588902928385 2020-10-12 10:29:09 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @samanthamarika1 We need news and media imo...but they've been left unchecked for too long...time to revive the type of journalists that are helping we the people get down to the truth on issues
1315478556143759361 2020-10-12 10:25:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden continuing 2/2, ur opinion...go...
1315478292594655232 2020-10-12 10:24:00 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> For all @JoeBiden supporters, are we as Americans suppose to believe the news networks and other polls?  Beyond other narratives this is a slap in the face of Americans intelligence.  Very few and "fine people" show up for u joe.  But compare and contrast the alternative view.1/2
1315476855538028549 2020-10-12 10:18:17 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @DanCrenshawTX Damn jake...u had me for a moment...I replied to other cut parts...but no way at all u can say ur fair after caving and not pressing for clarification here
1315475208619331584 2020-10-12 10:11:44 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden Wait what did pence say? U have every right to your opinions, but you don't get to create your own facts...u chose to run, so accept those of us that verify.  Easily explained. Joe, hunter is gay. Comments/reaction please?
1315474148735492097 2020-10-12 10:07:32 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @TimMurtaugh Well some news networks chose to break away and comment bs allowing all Americans to listen to the every day coronavirus task force update earlier in the year.  Just because we are told to forget, doesn't mean we listen, it actually has most imo, reacting with a simple "why?"
1315472638039527425 2020-10-12 10:01:31 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Good for @jaketapper for the push back...

1315470320506220544 2020-10-12 09:52:19 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden Joe...who has ur jitterbug?  They're speaking for u.
1315469690613960705 2020-10-12 09:49:49 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JRubinBlogger None of these
1315469580039577601 2020-10-12 09:49:22 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @FedUpWithGovmt @JoeBiden Kinda awkward huh?
1315469318252113921 2020-10-12 09:48:20 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden Um no...u didn't, somebody wake him up please.
1315459052231507968 2020-10-12 09:07:32 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JackPosobiec Yes he will, if he's convicted, the alleged ideology he seems to push won't work well for him in confinement...
1315457667595472897 2020-10-12 09:02:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @JoeBiden
1315457573739470849 2020-10-12 09:01:40 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @jasoninthehouse Go back to sleep, ur tweeting while dreaming again.

1315140296859168769 2020-10-11 12:00:55 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @DPotcner Jeopardy theme will continuously play until this bs is condemned...

1315139370295463937 2020-10-11 11:57:14 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> I'm starting to just get to a point to just having a blanket reply to ignorance saying u want to make a difference? U should just go away, lol...gets so tiresome...

1315135631794802688 2020-10-11 11:42:23 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @MoooPapa @1fullboat Trump should send this to Pelosi and Schumer as a Halloween gift. Super funny

1315133174884831232 2020-10-11 11:32:37 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @DomoLJub45 @EG4USA Ummm. NO...
1315132414298071041 2020-10-11 11:29:36 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @DPotcner Expelled?
1315084488737775618 2020-10-11 08:19:09 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> What if Biden gets covid and asks to take regeneron?  That would be a twist
1314944789259878401 2020-10-10 23:04:02 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Timcast So much for the "biden reaches across the aisle" message...
1314847336779186176 2020-10-10 16:36:48 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @McguireScotty @TrumpLadyFran They beat the hell out of the vehicle. This is sick &amp; Deranged,  I personally commend and respect the driver and/or owner for the way the chose to handle themselves.  I admittedly don't know if I could have had the same level of restraint given the same circumstances
1314846219764740096 2020-10-10 16:32:22 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @McguireScotty @TrumpLadyFran Repulsive!!! Are we all to now be expected that if on our way home and we happen to come across a "peaceful protest" on our street, we are just to blanketly understand and comply? Yells &amp; screams saying, "get the f@#× out here then."  Yet once this driver complies...
1314843929406210049 2020-10-10 16:23:16 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @RyanAFournier I dont care bc I've said it for him 200 million, no wait 200 thousand umm, no 200 billion million times every day.  So sorry folks, I had myself a biden moment, im embarrassed, hate yall had to witness that...lol
1314841746447237120 2020-10-10 16:14:35 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @MasterClassMill @realDonaldTrump Not entirely sure on Michigan yet, but 320 will do, lol
1314423149790928902 2020-10-09 12:31:14 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @TrumpWarRoom I'm just gonna remind those that read this...this dude was called out about coughing into his hand, saying cdc suggests coughing into ur elbow...ole biden replied saying he was by himself, notable isolating in his #infamousbasement . But the video says something different...
1314421253361602560 2020-10-09 12:23:42 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @TomFitton @RichardGrenell @BreitbartNews Let's go with the lib/left narrative, Twitter is just anti-gay, there's absolutely no other explanation
1314420843498409985 2020-10-09 12:22:04 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CortesSteve Same with ACB nomination, why is there not (more) push back on the lame duck presidency of 2016 and similar circumstances surrounding precedent.
1314420314122653698 2020-10-09 12:19:58 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CortesSteve Steve, u already know this, but they are only choosing their words now, to deflect previous records.  Unfortunately, clarification is needed as far as pushing on "ban," lets try "phasing out" and all other word play to pin it down
1314418444150935552 2020-10-09 12:12:32 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @realPowerTie @Texaswild7 Absolutely phenomenal!!!
1314417981200502789 2020-10-09 12:10:42 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> The more the media and the "triggered" folks continue to tell me I'm an idiot, the more sarcastic I get...go to work, get a job...u can make more than the biden campaign is paying
1314416981534298112 2020-10-09 12:06:43 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SJPFISH Who would have ever thought that blocking a road would end up upsetting people?  This wasn't thought out very well...id wager those numbers would total at least in the neighborhood of valid drivers in America...give or take a million or so
1314408714464616449 2020-10-09 11:33:52 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @CNN @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk @cnni @CNNBusiness   Do yall seriously believe it a good idea to tout @BillGates and his comments about covid.  Ever heard the expression "light at the end of the tunnel?"  I hope covid numbers end up less than the flu, wait WHO already let that out...
1314406646249070595 2020-10-09 11:25:39 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SteveScully @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @CortesSteve @TimMurtaugh @kayleighmcenany @SteveScalise @MikeJohnson @BillCassidy  How is this person allowed to be a debate moderator?  Am I jumping to conclusions or taking him out of context perhaps?
1314405363287044102 2020-10-09 11:20:33 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @SteveScully @Scaramucci Absolutely insane
1314404919294779394 2020-10-09 11:18:47 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Targets those that aren't in lock down areas, and promotes freedom, independence, and allows families to still work, earn, and help continue to help parents instill values for our children...if u disagree, please stay objective and cordial, my children follow me on twitter.
1314404918279770112 2020-10-09 11:18:47 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Granted, i tend to overthink things at times.  However, as an employee of a considered "essential business." My opinion is biden campaign tends to target those at home on lock down...trump campaign which is against lock downs
1314404917440843781 2020-10-09 11:18:47 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> Just hear me out here and actually think about it...to my knowledge the biden campaign holds most of their public speaking events in mid-day or late afternoon at times.  Trump campaign events are after 5pm in most areas.  Why is this seemingly the case?
1314086833614094338 2020-10-08 14:14:50 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> BREAKING; Regarding Charlottesville,  Kamala says one side brought "tiki torches," first I've heard this.  If true, apparently there's a infestation of mosquitoes in Charlottesville...the were possibly just trying to combat the pests.

1313686430401560576 2020-10-07 11:43:46 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @AJinKCity1 @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump Umm, we can just agree to disagree.   If I may tho, @realDonaldTrump still is not a politician even today IMO.  I understand-ish, the point that, not everyone likes everything that he says or does.   But name one thing that on it's surface didn't help the country without....
1313684669284651009 2020-10-07 11:36:46 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Stop_Trump20 *it's wrong....Twitter limited my free speech so I sacrificed some letters..lol
1313684256200286210 2020-10-07 11:35:08 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @Stop_Trump20 So who is this hollywood rant suppose to help? I'll agree it's true that he made this video of himself and freely shared his opinions.  His right, that doesn't necessarily mean tho that his opinion is right.  Just break each claim down, I beg of u, this is just hate, and it wrong
1313680948832206850 2020-10-07 11:21:59 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @ElisabethCorr18 @earthViber @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump Sorry @ElisabethCorr18, my name is Todd Davis, i thought my profile said that.  Thanks for the response though
1313680146533154817 2020-10-07 11:18:48 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @nietering @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump Well again, I did make the remark saying I didn't care about his taxes...but how about this, let's say there is in fact "there there"...something significant perhaps and even substantial...$400k per year salary for 8 years would in a way a help to all of us tax payers right???
1313676094160146434 2020-10-07 11:02:42 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @ElisabethCorr18 @earthViber @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump Well that seemed a bit off huh? Some might consider it offensive.  I'll admit, I've never met a person with that name.  Is that why I'm being called ignorant? If so, your right, im ignorant to even knowing someone their parents chose to give them that name, seems kinda sad imo
1313674286272577536 2020-10-07 10:55:31 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @ChrissyXris @JoyceWhiteVance @realDonaldTrump In reading ur initial response it seems within the realm of possible that an international company has made deals probably more than a few with those countries that would be considered within the "international" verbiage within the corporation's name.

Hopefully my initial comments helps explain in part why I haven't taken time to dive into it all, all said which foreign $ are owed?.....

You don't need @realDonaldTrump or his campaign itself to express your own thoughts/feelings. Don't wait for the call, just go do it based conviction alone
1312546402657067009 2020-10-04 08:13:42 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> @teljxr1 I dont believe that would be wise for the country as a whole.  That would present a whole lot more harm than good, imo

1308264852666953729 2020-09-22 12:40:21 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> 2/2 The argument of the next president being allowed the open #SCOTUS seat nomination makes more sense if the sitting president is leaving office due to constitutional term limits....how is this current situation the same???
1308264851609919489 2020-09-22 12:40:21 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> 1/2 @realDonaldTrump , Mr President, I guess I'm an idiot...how is this #SCOTUS nomination anything close to 2016?  Yes, the #GOP held the senate, but the former president was ending his second term, correct?...

I personally think it's an assault on clear minded individuals intelligence...#PelosiBlowout  #ClimateChange #EssentialWorkers I'm not alone here, I presume
1305726322329767937 2020-09-15 12:33:09 +0800 <todd_sntcareers> 1/2 I'll admit, at the onset of this election cycle, I had a complete open mind to attempt to understand the democrat's side and stances.  At this point, I pose the question of what would @realDonaldTrump be able to accomplish without the unequivocal headwind he has experienced

I tend to stay or maneuver away from the potential of my boat being capsized, unless I choose for it to be sunk...I could wrong, but insurance should get involved...

I question everything, and seek out info absent of political bias.  I then decide for myself and my family.  Most that comes from the biden camp says is just an attempt to lecture me

Those that test negative only test once per week.  She believed that the additional positive tests until negative were counted as new positive cases...

Joe biden Pelosi, Schumer and the rest seem to continually question my intelligence to not be able to question and research on my own...the democratic ticket seems to not care..
