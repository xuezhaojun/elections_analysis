They would rather have their loved ones with them. A casual, careless, preventable death is not Christ-like. The countries without citizens having hissyfits about pandemic precautions are able to socialize because they were united

He's holding out for corporate immunity for #COVID19 unsafe working conditions. Perdue &amp; Loeffler supported this until the runoff election. NOW they're playing "friend of the people" 😑

This is a good thing that you're doing, and I hope people take you up on it. I'm not going to be Twitter - available often enough and I'm afraid I'd leave people hanging, at a time when they really need someone right away.

No wonder it stayed with you. This has been a tough Christmas. We have 2 covid recoveries going on, and a very sick friend who hopefully will make it. I'm just happy to be healthy enough to be helpful here.

How many of you in #Georgia, exposed to #COVID19 had your state government contact you with offers of help? This is what it's like when your government works for you

If Hillary had been in charge as she should have been, maybe 5k d. e. a. t. h.s, tops, instead of 300k+? #COVID19 would be contained. Thank you, MAGAts 🤬

I'm a city girl and not used to that sort of thing

1341668388175638528 2020-12-23 16:54:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee Isn't Fair and Balanced PAC Mitch McConnell's PAC? If not, then McConnell's PAC it's a major funder of fair and balanced. I read something on that last week.
1341667325364203520 2020-12-23 16:49:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee @koan4u I never could believe that anybody took Pat Robertson seriously. As a child, I used to look at him with the same horrified fascination I viewed people who moved into haunted house movies. Especially when the dog says don't go there!
1341666049217818624 2020-12-23 16:44:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee @CarmenSisRice Both Perdue &amp; Loeffler have voted against raising the minimum wage. They're so rich that they're out of touch with how hard it is to live on small wages. It's even tough for the middle class. How are they supposed to legislate for people they don't understand?
1341665291571359749 2020-12-23 16:41:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd 🤣🤣🤣 I love Shameless!

1341663577686458368 2020-12-23 16:34:58 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @PatriotTjgreg @ksorbs I never saw anybody on 24-hour oxygen from the flu 😑. I never saw heart rate racing up to 149 beats per minute from getting up out of a chair from the flu. I don't know where you're getting your facts from, but this is no flu
1341662736321662978 2020-12-23 16:31:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw Not just packages, but food delivery trucks for supermarkets would be great to go electric. They're on the road a lot

1341661371881025536 2020-12-23 16:26:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae YES!
1341661246819508224 2020-12-23 16:25:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee I know somebody who used to wrap gifts in newspaper 😂. He was very sweet guy and you know he just sort of like last minute grabbed it, because there was no wrapping paper lying around. That's recycling!

1341658844607365120 2020-12-23 16:16:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CarmenSisRice You want to know where the money trickle down to? Ask the Disney heiress. She made a video saying she was getting millions out of the #GOPTaxScam. She said the super yacht business couldn't keep up with the work. That's who got the money. It didn't trickle down into the economy
1341658329676824579 2020-12-23 16:14:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CarterKimH @CarmenSisRice @lunaticopresid1 There isn't a single reputable economist who says trickle down economics works
1341657924305735681 2020-12-23 16:12:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CherylBlueWave I heard about this, good choice! He worked his way through school, and actually was a teacher
1341657686107045888 2020-12-23 16:11:33 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jkf3500 Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for results from my covid test taken last Wednesday. Results we're supposed to be in 3 to 5 days. I reread the paper. That's 3 to 5 BUSINESS days!

1341656697421455372 2020-12-23 16:07:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jkf3500 That's great Julie! Good to see you have a health plan that looks out for you 🙂👍
1341656457058533376 2020-12-23 16:06:40 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee @GFreding @jkf3500 I can't even predict the outcome of this election 😳. People in Florida put drunken Gaetz in office again despite a great candidate, retired Naval Commander Phil Ehr. Pedophile enabler Gym Jordan was re-elected. I 🤞 and hope for the best. I hope sanity and self-interest prevail
1341655251556859906 2020-12-23 16:01:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Ossoff is so right. #Georgia don't you deserve to be able to put food on the table? Pay your utilities? Maybe some Christmas? Elect somebody who cares about you
1341654315304251392 2020-12-23 15:58:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV If both houses of Congress pass the bill with a veto proof majority, it makes no difference whether Trump signs it or not
1341653413948362752 2020-12-23 15:54:35 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CharlotteChar22 I think he wants people to like him and offering 2K is better than the $600 Congress is offering. Therefore, HE looks good, like the generous one. Probably figures he can draw an audience with that.
1341653019427893250 2020-12-23 15:53:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee 🤣🤣🤣 she's right! It may be too late for this, but try doing closed captioning on a trump speech. He would fail second grade English.
1341652393675563013 2020-12-23 15:50:32 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NReveillee Right? We're not beggars at the gate! People paid tax money into this for decades! And now people who've been sucking it all up wants to deny people their own tax money for relief? Who can be okay with that?
1341651660154671106 2020-12-23 15:47:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae Oh absolutely! We've had everything but the murder hornets here. F you 2020!
1341648406834364417 2020-12-23 15:34:41 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Sunflwrgirl2 I'm so happy &amp; relieved! It's both scary &amp; empowering. It's great that you have support, as you find your land legs again. Please let us know how you're doing, &amp; if we can help. #ONEV1, every one of us, cares ❤

If there are beauceron rescues, you might want to get some pictures &amp; bios, show them to your wife. It would be a tribute to your late dog. Nothing helps to heal a 💔 like another dog to love.

We found out later he robbed them from a bakery delivery down the street 😂. He then stole a bag a pastry from a neighbor's delivery. Crumb cakes, crullers, jelly doughnuts!
1341633457257005056 2020-12-23 14:35:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @lancegregmason That's a cute puppy on your page 🥰, what kind?

1341623257166802944 2020-12-23 13:54:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Very powerful &amp; truthful video. Google fact check &amp; you'll find it's true. #GeorgiaPatriots #Georgia #Atlanta #ATL. We can have a Senate that works for US, not just the rich.
1341621816872165381 2020-12-23 13:49:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> What it means to be Republican today:  - Intimidation - Loyalty lists - Threats - Disregard for democracy  It’s not just Trump — GOP is destroying America.

1341621714237542400 2020-12-23 13:48:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> GOP is the minority party, desperate to maintain power, using: - Gerrymandering - Voter suppression - Voter intimidation  Ossoff &amp; Warnock have the honor, courage &amp; strength to defend our republic.  #GAforAMERICA  #wtpBLUE @wtpBLUE  #wtp574  https://t.co/7muZvbCaBY

Maybe Canada? Canada treats people much better. They would likely be thrilled to have a tropical province. Canada is cold! Puerto Rico could make Bank on tourism alone

1340546817914630145 2020-12-20 14:37:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Jules9800 I read where nurses aren't given time to completely recover from #COVID19 before their jobs demand their return 🤬. Strike.

If you're vegan should you be compelled to eat hamburger or prepare it at a fast food place? Same thing. Happily, all these people will go

The GOP Senate covid relief alternative to the Heroes Act, makes this tax break permanent as well as corporate immunity from liability

As a daughter of police, I can say that there needs to be a purge of racists in law enforcement. From the top all the way down to recruits.

1339025101929385984 2020-12-16 09:50:36 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd I read that months ago. The Trump properties weren't doing well until Russian birth tourism.

1338952206360317953 2020-12-16 05:00:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trying to get quick covid testing. Although it was listed as a provider, @OurLegacyHealth isn"t my insurer.

1338674857173643266 2020-12-15 10:38:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Atlanta #ATL, do you want a woman who's friendly with white supremacists representing you? If you don't show up &amp; vote for @ReverendWarnock, that's what's going to happen. While we're at it, please vote for @ossoff, because it costs $7500 minimum for Perdue to notice you
1338673635318382592 2020-12-15 10:34:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Rosie_wearamask I feel bad not just for our overwhelmed healthcare workers,  but for Laura  Ingraham's brother, who's on Twitter, &amp; horrified at what his sister has become.

1338632475325579265 2020-12-15 07:50:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw That's insanity. They need to treat these people as criminals. Arrest them, charge them with menacing, intimidation, sedition, interfering with the election process. Federal, felony crimes

1338625151915606016 2020-12-15 07:21:21 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @seacreaturemama No doubt DeSantis will get reelected. Wouldn't be surprised if those who lost family to #COVID19 voted for him again.

Many are just as hungry and poverty stricken by #COVID19 as anyone. Maybe the fact that we're keeping them from having their house foreclosed, covid relief to keep their family fed might make some of them think

There's a sizeable group of #Americans who gave up because education was unaffordable. Not everyone has the time or stamina to work 2 jobs or full-time, &amp; go to school. The ability to do 3-4 hrs sleep in succession shouldn't determine education.

1337115101220937729 2020-12-11 03:20:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd 🤣🤣🤣 when he goes to trial, I hope trump insists on testifying. Probably will. After all, it's a captive audience. I wonder if he'll mention the ramp?  I wonder if Rudy will be his criminal lawyer?

He's going to be chasing that for as long as he can, still chasing the high he got from being "America's mayor" after 9/11.

1336162589441576960 2020-12-08 12:16:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @atrupar A reporter asked him about the inauguration. That was enough to send Trump speeding away 😉

If trump gets away with even one thing, some #GOPCorruptionOverCountry somewhere down the line will think they can get away with it too cuz they're smarter 🤬. This needs to be an example and a warning.

These people don't want to know, don't care, don't consider the consequences. It's like they're adolescents whose parents are on vacation🤦🏼‍♀️

What next people riot, demand chimneys in their houses otherwise Santa Claus can't visit them?

1336121415410483206 2020-12-08 09:32:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @seacreaturemama I'm betting that #Florida reflects DeSantis. $5. Any takers? If they reelect Gaetz, a do-nothing drunk who wouldn't even debate his opponent, Phil Ehr, of course they'd reelect DeSantis. Only requirement for votes in FL, is that you do nothing for voters, &amp; lie to them.

1335750165546717184 2020-12-07 08:57:11 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Loeffler response to a question about Senators trading stocks by calling it "an attack on the American dream" 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️. Does it sound as if she represents regular working people? #ONEV1 #SenateDebate  #VoteWarnockForSenate  #WTPBlue #GTCBlue
1335749083349204992 2020-12-07 08:52:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Loeffler has called the #BLM movement "fascist". She doesn't explain this, instead she repeats for maybe the 5th time that Warnock wants to defund the police, even though this is been answered, at least twice. Even her own WNBA team thinks she's racist #ONEV1 #SenateDebate
1335747527849570304 2020-12-07 08:46:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Fact check: In order for the first #COVID19 relief bill to pass the Senate it had to include a tax break for 43,000 millionaires. This cost our Treasury billions, which we could have used to fund covid relief. Making this tax break permanent is in the 2nd Senate covid relief bill
1335746278567804928 2020-12-07 08:41:44 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Loeffler just repeated almost word for word the same answer that she gave 10 minutes earlier, responding about Trump conceding the election. Not a fresh or original statement from her. Is loeffler afraid to go unscripted? Is she capable of going unscripted? #ONEV1 #SenateDebate
1335745187117600768 2020-12-07 08:37:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Loeffler talks about Democrats holding up relief. Democrats don't want to pass the Senate #COVID19 relief program. Their program makes a tax break for millionaires permanent, corporations no liability for covid-unsafe working conditions &amp; resulting deaths.  #ONEV1  #SenateDebate
1335742702848147457 2020-12-07 08:27:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> OMG, #Loeffler is parroting cliches: "the Democrats will defund the police.. the military... socialism". And she can't refer to the Reverend without calling him " radical liberal". #GeorgiaTwitter #Atlanta #ATL, you're smarter than to fall for this. #ONEV1 #SenateDebate #WTPBlue

1335739853032472576 2020-12-07 08:16:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Kelly loeffler in the debate, refuses to answer pointed comments about her insider trading, while telling #Georgia that #COVID19 wasn't serious. Instead, "blablabla I'm a Christian... abortion". Don't fall for her hot button words. Look at what Loeffler ISN'T answering  #ONEV1

1335732296024920066 2020-12-07 07:46:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> In 23 minutes there will be a debate on CNN between the Reverend Raphael Warnock and Kelly Loeffler. DVR it if you can't watch. 7:00.

Both he &amp; Loeffler used the confidential Senate briefing to dump stocks &amp; buy ones what would climb under Pandemic restrictions, lied to #GA. And there's his voting 4x to discontinue preexisting conditions coverage.

Can we just bundle Alabama, Florida &amp; Kentucky together, call it Gilead, get normal ppl out &amp; relocated? We'd be a saner country

For $99, I get access to all the programming, free registration for any other Roku devices I get, and if anything happens to the TV, even if it gets dropped, it gets replaced free.

Lots of people have concealed carry permits, not a proportionate amount of shootings.  But this 🤬 should be charged with civil rights violations.

Sorry, you shouldn't have to subscribe to a $15 monthly service, so you can subscribe to another $15 monthly service 🤨

1334382233298198534 2020-12-03 14:21:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @BobChiro The United States is made up of many diverse groups. Loeffler is anti #BLM, anti LGBTQ, anti-choice, supports organizations that lie to pregnant women about abortion. And she let people think they were safe from the pandemic, even as she cashed in on inside information.
1334336450242826241 2020-12-03 11:19:35 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Suzyqfit4u So sweet!  Looks like a Malenois, they have lots of energy

1334324750013751296 2020-12-03 10:33:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Loeffler is a traitor to her gender and an enemy to peaceful coexistence among different groups of people that make up the United States. She's a bigot, racist, religious zealot. Surely there are enough normal people in Georgia to vote her out

Sad to say but the #Georgia election is a referendum on what kind of a country we want to be.

1334007481534619648 2020-12-02 13:32:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @atouchofsnark I turned my ankle, sprained my ankle, broke bones in my foot all before the age of 25. Age has nothing to do with it. You're just bitter, complaining, mean spirited, and a maga. Begone. Take your foil hat and go hang with your friend, if you have one
1334006399144128512 2020-12-02 13:28:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @kamimagic @ossoff @ReverendWarnock People saying things like this should be arrested for menacing. Surely there's something that they can be charged for
1334003896163844096 2020-12-02 13:18:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae Barr is Barr. Never going to change.
1334003292968390657 2020-12-02 13:15:44 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo I'm shocked at this, not just the principles but some 20-year-old kid! What do they want him to do, falsify data? Trump will never stop. To him, all the chaos, all the violence is power. The people threatening, harassing, need to be arrested.
1333988803162247168 2020-12-02 12:18:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @TheElliotPage Congratulations! Every move to your authentic self is a cause for happiness &amp; celebration.  Looking forward to seeing you in the next Umbrella Academy, &amp; whatever else you choose to do

1333958148445540352 2020-12-02 10:16:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CarmenSisRice @ossoff @ReverendWarnock See? Warnock and Ossoff out in the community helping people get fed. And it's not unusual.  Do you see Loeffler or Perdue helping the citizens of Georgia? No, they help themselves.
1333954914813296640 2020-12-02 10:03:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd Ha! So much for Wuhan! Israel worn Trump about #COVID19 in November. As we all know he ignored that.

1333946953709756419 2020-12-02 09:31:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo I'm thrilled! For Arizona, Mark Kelly, and Gabby Giffords. And for all of us!
1333946430847737856 2020-12-02 09:29:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae That's so true!

1333943378170441728 2020-12-02 09:17:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo There is no way #MoscowMitch is interested in anything but corporate immunity. Those bosses in the pork factory who bet on employees getting sick? They would have no consequences if Mitch gets his way.
1333940956337344512 2020-12-02 09:08:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Loeffler lies. Why should anybody be surprised? She's never not lied; about #COVID19 being a hoax, about her familiarity with having to ration money.
1333940278055485441 2020-12-02 09:05:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Voting for Ossoff and Warnock can help release money so people can feed their families

1333923863537745922 2020-12-02 08:00:06 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Biden won the election a month ago. Trump is still claiming fraud. The country remains divided &amp; the complicit GOP remains silent.

1333916526445953024 2020-12-02 07:30:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> The GOP is trying to disenfranchise millions of voters, mostly people of color — McConnell has had way too much power for way too long.

They risk lives, kill, but get off free! Fair? #georgiaraising, vote for Ossoff &amp; Warnock.

1333551375456714752 2020-12-01 07:19:58 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @kamimagic @JohnCornyn Look at those miles of hungry people, lined up. 53.5% of Texas voted Cornyn back in, so it's likely that they're enjoying being hungry, spending the day on food lines.

I've been the temp aberration in a parade of short. I think it's a temperament thing. Most men above 6'2" tend to be easygoing as do tall women. Shorter people have 2 be more proactive to stand out. It's a balance

They were going to healthcare workers. Maybe other places are doing the same but wanted to avoid selfish riots?

1332824280845848577 2020-11-29 07:10:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw They're doomed. Elizabeth Warren has them in the crosshairs. They can't foreclose until the loans go unpaid on the due dates. And there's the hinky business w/ Justice Kennedy's son &amp; his abrupt retirement from the #SCOTUS, leaving room for Kavanaugh
1332822367798587394 2020-11-29 07:03:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Jaymemaskup @JamesrossrJames @YahooNews More likely arms sales. Trump has no memory for secrets, &amp; requesting highly classified documents would leave a paper trail.
1332820545755250689 2020-11-29 06:55:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @JamesrossrJames @YahooNews The article says they are discussing ways to offload his debt. They can't foreclose before it's due. They also doubt there will be many takers on reselling trump's debt on the secondary market.

Imagine who would be alive, had Perdue &amp; Loeffler came back from the Jan. briefing to warn #Georgia.  Instead, they told us it's a hoax, &amp; used the information to do insider trading &amp; get richer. Priorities 🤬

1332589653770190850 2020-11-28 15:38:26 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @QuancyClayborne I expect people may look in, but not enter an open door near the bathroom. But wandering in, even opening doors, will make for some tension.

A rape conviction MIGHT 🤦🏼‍♀️ move some people out of his camp. I've been seeing the stirrings of Christians, horrified at trump's un Christ-like behavior &amp; the failure of the faithful to condemn it.

Before the families sue them for unsafe working conditions that resulted in death or disability of family
1332472754201714689 2020-11-28 07:53:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Veger70 Cornyn? You had no trouble ignoring the pain of Texans &amp; #Americans, instead using your energies to install a religious zealot onto the #SCOTUS.

1332471001515401216 2020-11-28 07:46:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @deb_ferrari It has taken #COVID19 to show that humanity, or at least the masses, aren't that far from the ancestors who believed in sun gods, mental illness is possession. We are all in danger from people like this.

We're closing out disastrous 2020, the squatter is on his way out. 2021 brings a welcome change &amp; a vaccine. Can't help but be a better year. We just need to safely close out this one
1332145545008218113 2020-11-27 10:13:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This has got to be one of the 1st priorities, if not the 1st. Without Reality Winner, we might never have known about Russia

Their decisions shouldn't endanger our medical, essential workers. I'm tired of #COVIDIOTS putting people in danger

How are we going to get them to believe there's a point of no return, where our planet can't recover?
1332080343717867520 2020-11-27 05:54:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @gsjh59 Absolutely! Why take a chance on gathering for these holidays, in the dread year 2020, if it means one or more of you may not survive, or even be recovered, for the Holidays that follow?  Go the distance!

1331879853532954625 2020-11-26 16:37:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Dem_Hugh Not surprised. Probably not only is Pence a sore loser, but maybe mother won't let him talk to women alone?
1331878797453344770 2020-11-26 16:33:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @PeggyStuart I believe Stacey Abrams. She's one of the few people that if she endorsed someone, I would run right out &amp; vote for them. Abrams' intelligence &amp; integrity inspire trust
1331876556600266752 2020-11-26 16:24:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Dem_Hugh Done deal 🤬
1331876076973244416 2020-11-26 16:22:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> THIS is what the Senate #COVID19 relief bill was about: forcing workers to go without #COVID19 masks, no consequences for business. this worker died. Perdue &amp; Loeffler tried to get corporate immunity passed. Unless #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica, they may win

1331872634414395393 2020-11-26 16:09:15 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @TracieLVaughn Thank you 😊 I hope your Thanksgiving is also safe &amp; enjoyable

1331867801179484162 2020-11-26 15:50:03 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @FeistyLibLady Oddly enough, there are a lot of States in darker colors that voted for trump &amp; the #GOPBetrayedAmerica. Were they thanking them for refusing to pass the Heroes Act, so they could feed their families? I don't understand it.
1331860161309261824 2020-11-26 15:19:41 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is so true! I'm tired of rich people pretending to represent people, when they're just there to get more rich. Time for honesty, integrity in office. People who care about us, our Country. #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica   #ONEV1
1331855259484839937 2020-11-26 15:00:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> How often does a candidate do this?   #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica unlike Perdue &amp; Loeffler, Jon Ossoff doesn't consider regular #Georgians as beneath him. He's fighting for you, alongside you, for a prosperous &amp; healthy #Georgia.   #ONEV1

1331745173500428288 2020-11-26 07:42:46 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> A different, understandable, view. Maybe we can lose the Pilgrim association &amp; change the holiday to one of gratitude?

If trump drove by on his way to golf, they would cheer him. From cars, tents,, that are now their homes. 😳. I'm finding it hard to have compassion 4 them

America the beautiful has become a third world country. You can stop this Georgia, keep bills from dying in the Senate by voting for Ossoff and Warnock.

At some point, you have to let people experience the consequences of their actions or they'll never change. If this was an addiction this would be called hitting rock bottom

Ralph Warnock was arrested for insisting minor children shouldn't be questioned without parents. It's the law. Loeffler was arrested for insider trading off a confidential meeting at the WH, warning donors about covid

1328440586924277760 2020-11-17 04:51:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @dodo Lovely story. See if you can get the license plate, names of the abandoners. In some States, abandoning an animals is a felony.

1327776786478821376 2020-11-15 08:53:49 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jpierni How many are going to be bringing #COVID19 home to their families? Another superspreader event, like Sturges

That money could have been used for #COVID19 relief, stopping evictions by using taxpayer's money ON taxpayers.

1327345749118521344 2020-11-14 04:21:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo The idea is to create enough chaos, so that all our votes, our #American right to choose, is tossed out. Then it kicks over to the House, 1 vote per State. With the Republican State majority, Trump steals our country &amp; becomes dictator.
1327344333930909697 2020-11-14 04:15:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @idew2 And to #Americans, who have to go to jail or prison. Rape is common, especially for small, victims. Serving your time shouldn't be an HIV/AIDS life sentence. Until we can reform prisons, ingoing Americans can also be vaccinated. This will never happen if McConnell owns the Senate
1327341974156763136 2020-11-14 04:06:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Make note of the conspiracy-spewing Senators mentioned by a realistic, Patriotic, outgoing Senator  #ONEV1

1326833826165743617 2020-11-12 18:26:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Does THIS river of cars belongs to a country where those elected by the people actually cared about the people?

1326817278805995520 2020-11-12 17:21:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> I quote tweeted her financial appeal, because Loeffler is rich, even without the insider training scandal. Her &amp; her husband's net worth is around $520 million, yet she's asking for your money! What does Loeffler know about the problems facing working, even middle class? #ONEV1
1326817277904216064 2020-11-12 17:21:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> more affordable? Rev Warnock also wants trade schools to be affordable, as well as college? Sometimes, all that's  standing between a good job, affording children, is training. Is that radical, to want the people you represent to have good lives? Maybe to her 🤔?  #ONEV1
1326817277006671872 2020-11-12 17:21:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Rev. Warnock wants preexisting conditions covered, always. Did you know that any lingering problems from #COVID19 will be preexisting conditions? Did you know Sen Loeffler voted to END preexisting conditions coverage? Is against Medicaid expansion, which would have made the #ACA
1326817275291168768 2020-11-12 17:21:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is amazing #Georgians, is this👇 what Loeffler's been telling you? That the REVEREND Raphael Warnock is one of the most radical Democrats? Let's see, what's  so radical? He wants you to be able to see a doctor, without carrying the balance on your credit card...  #ONEV1

1326757420471742464 2020-11-12 13:23:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> On Veteran's Day, this is especially insulting. Our Veterans fought, sometimes died, came back injured from serving our country. They, and we, deserve straight talk, not Perdue &amp; Loeffler trying to scare people into voting for them.
1326748903245406208 2020-11-12 12:49:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @on_pipe @pamrichmond1 That's true, but his appeal for money is deceptive. He's no longer a candidate, for one. Trump is likely using his superpac funds to pay an installment on debts he can't run out on, at least not right away. How many cash strapped people would be giving hard-earned $ to the RNC?

You have to fork over $8k for your $ to go to election recounts. Deceit to the end. Read the fine print before you donate  #ONEV1  #wtpBlue  #GTCBlue
1326695845513764865 2020-11-12 09:18:33 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @horridpoplyrics I have a question about seeing accounts who are mural follows &amp; real people, following sassygb. I blocked sgb over a year ago, for rudeness to a friend. Are mutual accounts that follow her problematic for me?  And thank you for your information &amp; help

1326626002118746112 2020-11-12 04:41:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @pineapplepleas Sweet! Much respect. My dad enlisted in the Navy pre-WW II. He said they were always working on the ships, but the Marines they were transporting had free time. So when he was home &amp; called for the War, he enlisted in the Marines, cause he thought it would be easier time 🤣🤣🤣

THINKING #Georgians have got to start seeing this as a ploy, deceit. Maybe they'll lose confidence in their Senators?
1326620086753325056 2020-11-12 04:17:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Seamuskitty 😕 Do you now use cauliflower rice instead?  I've been using it more, as a lower-calorie substitute for rice. With madras lentils &amp; sauce on top, it works

1326444491079708672 2020-11-11 16:39:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> No way this would happen. Even if they could somehow delay the inauguration, the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES has the Presidential term expiring on the 20th. Then, "acting President" Pelosi would be temporarily sworn in. Their heads would explode. She would set it right

1325919709510791171 2020-11-10 05:54:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC I remember a prestigious Washington DC law firm having to take the unusual step of issuing a press release saying trump wasn't, &amp; would never be a client. Donnie had been saying differently. Even in his 1st year, he wasn't paying legal bills, ignored lawyer's advice
1325918227059404800 2020-11-10 05:48:34 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC Considering most, if not all of trump's judicial appointees were rated unqualified by the ABA (some had never filed a brief or appeared in Court), I'm guessing he's working with the same pool of experience
1325917042151727111 2020-11-10 05:43:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Imagine examining the votes which put #LeningradLindsey &amp; #MoscowMitchMcTraitor back in the Senate? And where did the $500,000 donated to Trump's fake Georgia scam, through supposedly broke Graham really come from? 🤔

1325576076819460096 2020-11-09 07:08:59 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is going to be tricky. Some Georgians are progressive, but many aren't. GOP ads stress Democrats are too liberal for Georgia.

Lara Trump, Kimberly Guifoyle, &amp; likely others were paid $100,000/month from campaign donations. Trump used them for his business, too. So now they're scamming you, saying the $ is for Georgia. Crooked to the bitter end.
1325570594377658368 2020-11-09 06:47:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae Truth. 😳😕. A really nice neighbor turns out to have been a trump supporter. He lent us his earth mover, had been over for drinks, pre-covid, I gave them produce from the garden.  Fortunately they're going to be moving. Engineering degree, likely no Humanities courses.

The FCC Fairness Doctrine is still on the books, just not enforced. Time for some strict enforcement, as well as a look at broadcasting license guidelines. An entertainment license should not be allowed to act as if it were a news channel.

I don't know that many are reachable as things stand. There are now 3 extreme right "news" channels. If he eludes prison, trump may headline a 4th.

Every voter who braved the MAGAt gauntlet, followed instructions on their 1st vote by mail,  stood on lines for 12 hours, quietly voted blue while doing the trump 2020 with family, Country over Party 1st time Democratic voters &amp; those of us who had no obstacles.  https://t.co/dzwOOATfmG

1325019605677436928 2020-11-07 18:17:46 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MAF_SouthFLA This is dangerous. Why is trump dumping the person responsible for watching over our nuclear stockpile? Now? 😳  Who has Trump nukes America for not electing him in 2020 bingo?

1325018133921361925 2020-11-07 18:11:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @scott4pendleton I can feel myself tensing up as I watch this. It's  hard to believe it took the deaths of almost 250,000 Americans &amp; nearly 1/4 of the world's #COVID19 cases to get this to be a close victory for sanity.
1325016200905023488 2020-11-07 18:04:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Wow, once again #Trump deceives his followers, knowing they'll never read the fine print

1325006279815753729 2020-11-07 17:24:49 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @deb_ferrari And if this came out a month ago, we might be looking at trump 2020. It took people dying &amp; massive unemployment to even get a close Electoral College win

She'll make sure there's no more underhandedness with people's votes, nation-wide.  Fair Fight takes on the national voting system &amp; hinky tamperable machines

1324999780339048448 2020-11-07 16:58:59 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> That's what Hillary said, way back in 2016, if he didn't win. When pressed at their debate, trump replied "we'll see".
1324986243294228480 2020-11-07 16:05:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @PatriciaBeaul19 @sohh No, one of the 30 sexual assault/rape charges waiting for trump was a girl who was 13 at the time. And a virgin. She cried because she was afraid she was going to be pregnant &amp; trump threw a couple hundred at her, telling her to get an abortion. Look it up
1324975723598082054 2020-11-07 15:23:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @VoteBlue4Us @MeidasTouch 😳 who was his ghostwriter?

1324972332587233281 2020-11-07 15:09:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae This is why Alabama voted for a crooked football coach over Doug Jones. Tuberville's going to be on every lobbyists' speed dial by the end of his first week in DC

1324970607998480389 2020-11-07 15:03:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd They must be running on New York time. If you're not early, you're late.  Not that I'd mind them taking over sooner. Would be one heartfelt Thanksgiving

He went through 2 more placements (by the woman who picked him up off the street), before I got him. We had almost 15 years together.
1324953895462789120 2020-11-07 13:56:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> The Presidential concession speech, minus the giant ball &amp; children 😂
1324952828125671424 2020-11-07 13:52:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lesdoggg "They had it in for Trump, didn't count the ballots with Trump for President. The Liberal media wouldn't announce I really won Arizona and Pennsylvania. I'm going to challenge every State I didn't win". That's trump's concession speech.

1324944811678289920 2020-11-07 13:20:34 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @DougJones So sad. Who was it that said people get the government they deserve? I guess we're going to see this in January as Tuberville ignores Alabama &amp; winds up on every lobbyists' speed dial.

1322826264923631618 2020-11-01 17:02:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @AP As we've seen by the maga attack on the Biden bus, there are extremists in every country, every group. I'm concerned that articles about these extremists might lead people to think all Muslims are like this. They're not. I've had Muslim neighbors who were nice, funny, warm people
1322824229851574275 2020-11-01 16:54:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @AP People have left countries which did not allow them to express their religion. For some religions, expression is more than an hour of church on Sunday. What I don't understand is why choose to live in a secular country? Not everywhere in the US, but I'm fine w/ Muslim neighbors.  https://t.co/wVtWY6g7xL

1322820923724976128 2020-11-01 16:40:59 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MeidasTouch Trump had a huge war chest for his campaign. He looted it to prop up his businesses. Brad Pascale was cutting $100,000 checks each month for Lara Trump &amp; Kimberly Guifoyle. That's why trump has no money 💰

1322761599258562560 2020-11-01 12:45:15 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> 😳😳😳 how can any Latinex person vote for trump? Everything about him says "if you're not white, you're not right".
1322760819436740610 2020-11-01 12:42:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> What was Gardner doing about the fires? About #Covid_19 which forced the cancellation of lucrative film festivals? About relief for the people of #Colorado? Nothing. Instead confirmed Barrett, who worked on the shady situation in Bush v Gore, getting them to stop counting ballots

Plus they swarm. The article I tweeted said the police were outnumbered 50:1, &amp; these guys are armed with automatic weapons.
1322753075098968064 2020-11-01 12:11:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> I'm stunned. Such hatred hasn't been seen since the Civil Rights marches.

As to whether they got plate numbers for later prosecution, I hope so. No plates in the back of their cars. Unless there's video from the front, or of ppl, they could claim it isn't them
1322659092054204416 2020-11-01 05:57:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Jovie1kenobi They were. The article states the police were outnumbered 50:1. And the police aren't issued automatic weapons, which these people have. For the safety of the volunteers, and even the outmanned &amp; outgunned police, the sanest thing to do was cancel.

In case Trump disputes his loss, brings it to the #ScotusSham, who kicks it to the 1vote per State House. We need enough Democrats there to keep trump2020 from becoming a reality

1322108050946158592 2020-10-30 17:28:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Vote for @SenDougJones #Alabama. Washington is full of people waiting to take advantage. They didn't snare Doug Jones, but I'd bet they get Tuberville. How long before Tuberville gets caught in an ethics violation?
1322107187724873729 2020-10-30 17:24:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Alabama voters, be poll watchers. Don't let them cheat you
1322106781116506113 2020-10-30 17:23:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @american_proud2 that's Tuberville's integrity for you. The Washington lobbyists will be buying his votes from the minute he gets to town. Even if he doesn't get a 2nd term he'll retire rich, &amp; with lifetime healthcare. But not you cause the health ins industry pays well 4 votes
1322105598574354437 2020-10-30 17:18:32 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @american_proud2 @MsCrowSays @StephenKing And Doug Jones doesn't vote in lockstep with AOC. He did vote to keep your healthcare though. AOC is in the House, Doug Jones is in the Senate. 2 different votes anyway.
1322104907118206976 2020-10-30 17:15:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @american_proud2 @MsCrowSays @StephenKing Jones has a spotless reputation, the lobbyists in Washington can't get at him. Tuberville was involved in a Ponzi scheme, paid a settlement to avoid jail, like his partner got. Google it. Also had a charity, but nobody got money. How long before Tuberville gets paid to vote?
1322103649300963329 2020-10-30 17:10:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> 😳😳😳 that should make #Alabama angry. Why doesn't it make Alabama determined not to be pushed around?
1322103305661632514 2020-10-30 17:09:26 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @auntysmartmouth @kim12705467 @StephenKing @aldemocrats Hey, if there are Ubers or Lyfte in rural #Alabama, I'd chip in to give the rideless a ride to vote. Couldn't afford more than 1 ride though
1322102738486849536 2020-10-30 17:07:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Alabama, with all the lobbyists looking to pay Senators for votes, how long do you think it will take for Tuberville to sell you out?  @SenDougJones has refused to be corrupted by Washington. Aren't you worth a top shelf Senator? One that wants you to have healthcare?
1322101646738911235 2020-10-30 17:02:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Alabama, you would vote for a guy who doesn't even choose to live in your State, to represent you? 😳. Who has a dishonest reputation?  Vote for Doug Jones
1322100781571428353 2020-10-30 16:59:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Alabama #alabamapower Doug Jones has integrity. You can trust him with your money, not being corrupted by lobbyists in Washington.  Tuberville? Not so honest, is he?  Let him go back to coaching
1322099677378957315 2020-10-30 16:55:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MrRaulJenkins @SadieMaeTN @SenDougJones Yay!

1322095249620037634 2020-10-30 16:37:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Yes, @ProjectLincoln @Eleven_Films  give this a watch. It speaks to all of us.

Parents, you've got to show your daughters they are valued, that they are capable of achieving, that it isn't a waste of time setting high goals. You do that in part by NOT supporting, voting for those who would dismiss them. What you do matters more than what you say
1322092501956620289 2020-10-30 16:26:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Awww, so sweet! Looks like the foster kitty.

1322091190477418496 2020-10-30 16:21:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> 😂😂😂
1322090977956253696 2020-10-30 16:20:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Yes, but do we trust the voting machines?
1322090532928020480 2020-10-30 16:18:40 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV 😂😂😂 I always thought that with some seasoning, Mayor Pete has a future in politics. I look forward to voting for him someday.
1322089946270691329 2020-10-30 16:16:21 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV This makes me angry
1322089552337461249 2020-10-30 16:14:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV He's accurate as to Steven Miller's intentions &amp; goals.  Our great-great grandparents would have been deported under Miller's new rules. Even if they're white, they may have had language barriers preventing them from passing to harder test, then out they'd go.
1322088167336337409 2020-10-30 16:09:16 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV He's right. Nobody is the same person they were 10 years ago, even 5 years ago. Your experiences shape you.
1322087402840547329 2020-10-30 16:06:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Truth
1322086459650658304 2020-10-30 16:02:29 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV He's right. It ain't over until Trump concedes, &amp; starts packing his bags for his flight to a non-extradition country.
1322085365491015680 2020-10-30 15:58:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Lee is right. I've seen teens talk parents into cars, later curfews, new phones, all sorts of things. Even did it myself 😉. Use your powers to protect out Democracy, make sure your family adults vote &amp; #VoteBlue

Obama, Biden &amp; Dr. Fauci acted swiftly to contain it, contact traced, quarantined. If ebola had arrived during #Trump's tenure, it would have spread like #COVID19. Ebola is a horrible way to d.i.e

Just like China artificially propped up the yen awhile back. The bonus comes that if trump is reelected &amp; ends #SS as he plans, he never has to pay back the money from people's paycheck deduction
1322081345716187136 2020-10-30 15:42:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> I think #Texans are just tired of the 🐃💩, all meandering talk, no results. And #Texas doesn't take kindly to ppl assuring them a deadly v.i.r.u.s is no worse than the flu, then Trump admits he knew it's airborne &amp; deadly to Bob Woodward.
1322079370811383808 2020-10-30 15:34:19 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Vote #Pennsylvania!  Just the fact that Trump is trying to scam you out of your Constitutional right to vote should make you angry enough to be determined. I've spent time in PA, you're anything but meek sheeple 😎
1322078286965403649 2020-10-30 15:30:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Damage to his reputation? I remember seeing the picture of Falwell with a not-his-wife lady friend on Twitter. Both their pants were undone 🤔. Looks like he did it to himself.

1322021838390611968 2020-10-30 11:45:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump wouldn't know irony if it came up &amp; introduced itself. He has a con man's ability to play a crowd, but otherwise he's too stupid to read a daily briefing. Seriously. WH staff gave up.
1322020953790980097 2020-10-30 11:42:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @atrupar There he is, projecting his motivations onto other people again

Some were sold for slaughter for dog food, some to France. But they have taken to keeping it on the DL, cause public opinion in France is turning against it.

Amy Comey Barrett is in the #SCOTUS to completely deregulate markets. That's why Charles Koch bought the #GOP Senate. Burning the USA to the ground &amp; starting over has too many

The devastation of his past term is an inconvenience in comparison. I'm not willing to let people die without healthcare for my principles, women die from illegal abortions, the children in cages.

Didn't Trump refer to white supremacists as "really fine people"?  Trump was born white, became orange, &amp; now is more of a butterscotch color  So it looks like voting for trump makes you feel like you're rich?

I'm shocked 😳), affordable healthcare, children, infrastructure, education, programs that lift people out of poverty so they can become taxpayers.  Read it
1321724110238461953 2020-10-29 16:02:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Just in case you're still on the fence about #Trump or #Biden, take a look at the 2021 Trump pre-#Covid budget. Who wins, who loses? #ONEV1  #WTP2020 #GTCBlue  https://t.co/lKXi2FxE2H

Sure there's sex, which brings offspring &amp; immortality through them. But the trad wife does the raising. They miss the days when all they had to do was their job, maybe now the lawn.

1321612697201340416 2020-10-29 08:39:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is the Senate that will pass #COVID relief bills that will keep the #American people from losing housing, healthcare. It's OUR tax money, shouldn't it be used to help #Americans out of work? #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

1321608048016678912 2020-10-29 08:21:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Biden's approach is commonsense when dealing with an extremely i.n.f.e.c.t.i.o.u.s  v.i.r.u.s. If you want to survive.

Still, there's no way for him to know who you voted for. Could always say "Trump 2020", then vote for #Biden. Bet he wouldn't even take a picture of your plates. Don't let them intimidate, you're smarter.

Same for those who want offshore drilling in #Florida. Oil slicks, drilling rigs ruin tourism &amp; recreation but they don't care. It's not where they live. Protect your home, vote for Margaret Good

1321578463027847168 2020-10-29 06:23:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #LindseyMustGo, his sun has set. Now he's just been caught in a pay for play scheme involving Thom Tillis &amp; Native casinos. Graham is compromised. #SouthCarolina deserved a Senator w/ a spotless reputation. Jaime Harrison is working to feed the #COVID unemployed while Graham begs
1321576677068005376 2020-10-29 06:16:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> See? Like the #SCOTUS case to end the #ACA, #Trump has scheduled offshore drilling for AFTER the election. Too late for #Florida to do anything about it. Oil spills will ruin tourism &amp; enjoyment. Alan Cohn will work to keep #FL safe &amp; beautiful. He also won't receive you
1321575298303811584 2020-10-29 06:11:19 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #California, chasing #Nunes, hoping he would pay attention to the voters who put him in office is like an abusive relationship. Nunes won't even debate @PhilArballo2020. Vote for Phil. He actually cares about you &amp; the challenges facing your district. Phil Arballo is one of you

Time to take out the trash. YOU employ them, YOU can fire them.

He pocketed over $1.2 million from the NRA alone. Charles Koch pays well. He paid to push through #AmyConeyBarrett because she will decide cases that deregulate the market
1321405482473414656 2020-10-28 18:56:32 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> How often does #Trump narrate a video?

Her priorities are rural access to hospitals, paid family leave. Her GOP challenger, Helfrich, had much out of State money, #ONEV1 #BlueDot
1321389977335328768 2020-10-28 17:54:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Republicans don't. Skarlatos doesn't believe in a minimum wage, the #ACA, #COVID19 relief. Peggy Stevens is running against Courtney Neron. Of course it's the GOP mantra, taxes 🤦🏼‍♀️. Oregon has no sales tax. Let's get practical. Running a community involves taxes. Do we want
1321389976488009728 2020-10-28 17:54:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> I've noticed the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry has bought airtime on Late Night with Seth Meyers, attempting to get #Oregon to vote for them. 🤦🏼‍♀️. We in Oregon believe a woman has ownership of her body, not government, not religion. We support affordable healthcare, #ONEV1 #BlueDot

1320992811760513024 2020-10-27 15:36:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Women are complete as individual human beings. The mandate to have a child "to feel complete" is outdated, promoted by religion &amp; society which wants new members. Shouldn't it be a woman's choice? #ONEV1
1320989328298815488 2020-10-27 15:22:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Women of #America, did you vote in the people who brought this about? Bear in mind, they think pretty much all birth control is abortion except abstinence &amp; they're unmoved by the science that says it isn't. #VoteOutEveryRepublican #VoteOutCorruptGOP #VoteBlueDownBallot

I'm sure people felt unsafe during the McCarthy witch hunt era, but that was awhile ago. Going back is not progress. We need to fearlessly embrace a future where no one is afraid, hungry in their own country.

You don't get things you're never going to use. Is he planning on going to war with #American citizens? Maybe he should stick to Call of Duty?

Even if some idiot doesn't accidentally start a fire, dry lightning starts fires. The current President is a fool, thinks "raking the forest floor" will stop fires 🤦🏼‍♀️

Can we just stop demonizing immigrants already?
1320892339070496769 2020-10-27 08:57:29 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> How did YOUR Senator vote?  For you?  Or for Charles Koch &amp; the extreme religious right?
1320858487811788802 2020-10-27 06:42:58 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> The lie:  “We are rounding the corner with Covid”—Trump  The truth:  225,000 Total Deaths 79,000 New Cases in JUST 24 Hours! 891 dead in JUST one day!  Joe Biden has a plan to beat back Covid!  #BidenCrush  @GTC_Blue #GTCB168  https://t.co/28N1ZElLmM
1320857918695116800 2020-10-27 06:40:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> That's because Charles Koch pays cooperative #GOPBetrayedAmerica Senators better than their their voters. Free markets, which is what Koch wants, will kill the economy, but make Koch richer. Barrett will do this. Our workers will be competing w/ low wage overseas workers
1320847278798630918 2020-10-27 05:58:26 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae Added the # 🙂
1320847129741459456 2020-10-27 05:57:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Not only 60 Minutes, but personally insulting women reporters. Do we want our daughters to grow up in a country where personal attacks on them for doing their job is rewarded?   #ONEV1
1320846160089673728 2020-10-27 05:53:59 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae 😂 you should move to the Pacific Northwest. Guaranteed 6 months of overcast, drizzle to torrential downpours. 1-2 hours to the Pacific.  https://t.co/jztbYxRjJ9
1320842715580354567 2020-10-27 05:40:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo I read an article which did research on why poorly educated women vote against their own interests. It said these women are socialized to believe their worth is determined by their husband's status. So they vote the way he votes 😳

Shannon will work for #COVID19 relief. It looks like we'll have to wait until new Congress comes in, January 3rd. Jim voted against the Heroes Act, which provided economic relief. He voted against the 1st #COVID19 bill
1320833266018963456 2020-10-27 05:02:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CarmenSisRice We need to save the next generation. Schools need to teach critical thinking, philosophy, bring back the social sciences. We're going to need a longer school day, maybe a longer school term.
1320832502437613568 2020-10-27 04:59:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @frankgatto161 @CarmenSisRice That's why we got George Bush Jr. Angela Merkel has sucessfully led Germany through an influx of refugees, #COVID19. Germany is doing much better than we are. Too many #Americans wouldn't vote 4 a woman or a scientist. We're dying, hungry, unemployed &amp; facing eviction due to bias
1320830381923291136 2020-10-27 04:51:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is why #America should #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica &amp; #VoteOutCorruptGOP. Instead of working on #COVID19 relief, the GOP Senate pushed through Charles Koch's #SCOTUS pick. Koch pays them well. Koch doesn't care about women, he wants totally deregulated markets &amp; Barrett will do it
1320828248700325888 2020-10-27 04:42:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Rep. Timmons, #SouthCarolina doesn't owe the voters any explanation for his votes? 😳 That's a lot of nerve!  The voters are Timmon's EMPLOYERS!  They can &amp; should fire him, for Kim Nelson.  It's a business decision, replacing an employee who isn't doing the job.
1320825122329014273 2020-10-27 04:30:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw So, the takeaway is that the poorly-educated, the ones trump has  (according to many witnesses), insulted &amp; looks down on, are the ones donating to #Trump?  Do they not know what he thinks of them?
1320821178668208128 2020-10-27 04:14:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae I was in a March against racism in Philadelphia, years ago. It looked like a lovely city.

1320817415115042816 2020-10-27 03:59:46 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae My dad introduced me to bluegrass, early country &amp; classical😊.  My mom disliked both. She liked Anne Murray &amp; that Take My Breath Away song from Top Gun. Also Italian singers, Dean Martin. Lots of common musical ground 🤣🤣🤣
1320815828304982016 2020-10-27 03:53:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @uskiwiblend My heart breaks every time I look at this picture. They could have left direct patient care, worked safely for insurance companies, processing claims. Instead they put their lives on the line, caring for patients, even #COVIDIOTS, while having to reuse single-use PPE'S.

That's how some families are. There was always respect &amp; love. My dad didn't want hushed grieving &amp; censoring, he wanted normalcy. Also I think it may have been less mean-spirited than it gets on Twitter
1320810544232689664 2020-10-27 03:32:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @briantopping @apathetic_NY It won't prevent. But 1 Navajo doctor was using the oximeter to detect #COVID19 early sign, oxygen issues. They have lower fatalities because they were put on supplemental oxygen early. By the time fever shows, internal organs had been damaged by low oxygen.

When your parent is terminal you speak of many things, from childhood, hopes, love, &amp; yes, politics. Do you think she should have shut the conversation down, even if they reg talked politics? You presume to know their family dynamic
1320803043848286209 2020-10-27 03:02:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> ClackamasCounty, #Oregon. I was researching County Commissioner Position 4.

1320629784183885824 2020-10-26 15:34:11 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CarmenSisRice @GreenfieldIowa Of course Ernst spouting the #GOPLies that #COVID19 is no worse than the flu, it would disappear was a betrayal of the people who elected her. She was supposed to put #Iowa first. Instead,  Ernst refused to work to pass the #HeroesAct, leaving Iowans struggling to pay bills

And since we seem to have way too many Americans looking for someone or something to worship, there needs to be stronger, more specific safeguards

1320535824581079041 2020-10-26 09:20:49 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @idew2 I just saw the Vice network show 'Why We Hate'.  There was a woman who went to a women's convention, set up a booth. Her thing was that women shouldn't be allowed to vote 😳😳😳.
1320533504820539392 2020-10-26 09:11:36 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw The article mentions the book 'Clinton Cash' &amp; its author. That book was commissioned by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a member of the Heritage Society (that brought us some of the unqualified but cooperative judge appointees). He HATES the Clinton's.

1320447871557144576 2020-10-26 03:31:19 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J Everyone supports Hickenlooper. Colorado has its worst fire in history, tourist industry devasted by fire &amp; #COVID19. We can't afford a climate change denier who supports a relief bill that makes a millionaire tax cut permanent &amp; gives corporations immunity 4 unsafe workplace
1320446308436508672 2020-10-26 03:25:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J Mitch responds to 💰, that's it. Not his salary, but selling his influence has made him a millionaire many times over. The good citizens of #Kentucky may get scraps from his table if they're lucky. Why vote for him? What has he done for you?  https://t.co/qCUX4PwtYP
1320444009454522368 2020-10-26 03:15:59 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J Susan Collins is untrustworthy. Why would anyone vote for someone who  frets, but votes what her party tells her to, all the time? Mainers are fed up. Remember this?  https://t.co/BJKxNvUhzi
1320442694573846528 2020-10-26 03:10:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J In NYC I saw Medicaid expansion work. I had a friend w/ ♥️ problems, whose medical bills were past a % of her income. Medicaid expansion covered them. Vote for Cal Cunningham to bring this financial relief to North Carolina
1320441681259368448 2020-10-26 03:06:44 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J Medicaid expansion would allow people who make over the cutoff amount to still receive more affordable healthcare.
1320441030781489152 2020-10-26 03:04:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Anyone in #SouthCarolina, or anywhere in the USA working on having a family using #IVF? Better get moving. Lindsey supports Barrett, who thinks it's sinful. Barrett on the #SCOTUS would be a disaster, because she voted her People of Praise beliefs, not the Constitution.
1320438891313164288 2020-10-26 02:55:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> The only thing DeVos wants to do with schools is to turn them all into rigid Christian religious schools. That's her background. I may have been raised Christian, but I believe schools can't work for all Americans if they make children feel excluded cause it's not their religion
1320437280826216448 2020-10-26 02:49:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @DemInRedOK That's beautiful!  That's one of the reasons I'm voting for #Biden.  The character of the President matters.

My hair is folk-singer long now 🤦🏼‍♀️, doesn't get washed with every shower. I use an oximeter for a coronavirus early warning.
1320433018180308992 2020-10-26 02:32:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Which means Ernst supports someone who ignored the Iowa floods, complaining about bad press instead. Ernst also followed the #GOP party line, #COVID19 was a hoax, no masks or relief for Iowans needed. A lack of support with heartbreaking consequences💔.

People need #COVID19 relief, like Canada &amp; the EU people are getting. It's OUR tax money, why isn't it going to help us until a proven safe vaccine is distributed? They have no foodlines

The 1st botched, illegal abortion death is on her head. Murkowski comes from privilege, even to her Senate seat. She has no empathy for those who don't.

1319749282522517504 2020-10-24 05:15:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is truth
1319741499249020928 2020-10-24 04:44:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CassandraRules The article states the voter must be granted absentee ballot status. That's a separate process not needed in Oregon, Washington or Colorado

1319738594819334144 2020-10-24 04:32:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @KGWNews Thatcher's company destroyed records to cover up evidence of fraud in construction contracts with the State. She was fined $60,000 for this. Do we really need to elect someone with this kind of character? 😳. Would be like a kid in a candy store with a State job &amp; access
1319736583335989249 2020-10-24 04:24:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @wsteaks @SooRinKimm Because trump has been looting his campaign to shore up his businesses. Brad Pascale was also paint Lara Trump &amp; Kimberly Guifoyle $100,000 a month. They're so corrupt that they're looting their own campaign the way they looted taxpayers
1319735628125200384 2020-10-24 04:21:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @braun_fay52 @Oregonian Because the training that enabled him to subdue a terrorist (with 2 other men), makes him qualified to negotiate &amp; pass legislation in Washington? Does your doctor also act as your mechanic? Skills don't transfer. Skarlatos wants to repeal the #ACA, is a #ClimateChange denier

The #Oregon Coast needs their healthcare repealed, more #COVID19 d.e.a.t.h.s, a #ClimateChange denier making laws that increase greenhouse gases, more fires, tax cuts for millionaires, back-alley abortion to resume, likely war with Iran?

1319726159467220994 2020-10-24 03:43:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @rendabeltzer3 @Oregonian So you're AGAINST affordable healthcare, think #COVID19 is just the flu, #ClimateChange is a hoax, a 3+trillion debt is good, 90% of our wealth owned by 1% of the country is a good thing? 🤦🏼‍♀️

1319164179987615745 2020-10-22 14:30:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CynBlogger Much of that is true. However, I have gotten replies from ppl who said they voted for trump in 2016, regretted it, &amp; were voting for Biden this time. I think hashtags, tweet subjects cross barriers. #COVID19 is a huge crossover

Lucky avoided. Until 1 day he had enough of the Rottie. Low growl. The Rottie moved away quickly &amp; avoided him. If they have exercise &amp; a calm environment, they're chill.

He would be fine, then his eyes would look funny, he'd get that menacing growl, even at family. My dad beat him off with a pot once. Turns out he had a (then) inoperable brain tumor. He also had to be euthanized 😪

Lucky liked to go to the dog park for the scents, but it was a rare dog that he would like. More of a "s'up man" attitude. Was trained to be able to walk by cats, dogs, squirrels, etc unleashed

1319154770943250432 2020-10-22 13:53:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Sure, depending. Facebook censors some. But they had some interesting research in terms of what turns ppl off. We have been remarkably restrained as to what we think of trump &amp; his enablers. But the voters we need to reach are often moderates, even Republicans.

Someone showing themselves voting or their vote might be subject to violence. Intimidators would have a means for making sure the voter voted the "right" way.

1318830456746377216 2020-10-21 16:24:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo That's why even Fox News wouldn't touch this story! Guliani brought it to them, but they thought both the story AND Guliani were hinky.
1318829801772216320 2020-10-21 16:21:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Sure, sure. 🤥 Trump's tax cuts, passed by the #GOPBetrayedAmerica, benefited the wealthiest 10%. Google, Safari, browser search it. The few middle class tax cuts are set to expire.
1318828625987133440 2020-10-21 16:17:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #WisconsinVoters, you got played by Trump &amp; Foxconn. All those people lost their homes, but the jobs they were promised, never showed up.

1318823703761674241 2020-10-21 15:57:28 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #WisconsinVoters please listen to this message.  We can have a civil government, with integrity, again.

1318819470542921729 2020-10-21 15:40:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @oldsargepap Trump has a SCOTUS case to repeal the #ACA the week AFTER 🤔 the election. The #GOP in Congress voted unsuccessfully to repeal the ACA. 195,498 people in Wisconsin would lose healthcare. #VoteBlueDownBallot #WisconsinVoters, to keep #Wisconsin healthy, out of medical debt.
1318816976098058241 2020-10-21 15:30:44 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Once again, #ONEV1 is looking out for not only you, but your furbabies.  There's a recall of some brands of pet food, due to aflatoxin.    https://t.co/svcUXN03q5

1318797378451767297 2020-10-21 14:12:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> See?  Here it is. Trump talks about #COVID19, and the truth, month by month
1318796293943091202 2020-10-21 14:08:33 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Not Biden w/ China!  A Trump corp paid $188,561 taxes in China, from 2013-15. Yet he only reported a few thousand in income from China, according to the IRS. Who pays this much tax on "a few thousand"?

Try to sell them a car with issues &amp; they'll call you on it. Try to overcharge them on a service or repair? Same.

For pandemic safety measures. One said 2 weeks was enough! 😳  If they actually observed them then maybe they could be eased. Brown is the reason it isn't worse here.

1318362854559416320 2020-10-20 09:26:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV See? Lies. Trump has been promising a health care plan since early 2016. Nothing. All he does is try to k.i.l.l the #ACA, which he's doing again, bringing the case before the SCOTUS the week after elections. And that bribe of a middle class tax cut? Don't hold your breath

But due to other dogs &amp; cats sharing space, the dog must like cats, get along with the 2 dogs. Female, cause they're male,(?) short coat, cause 1 slobbers. Min. 40 lbs, cause 🙂. No dogs like that in local shelters.
1318289477207429120 2020-10-20 04:34:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @koan4u Best story of the day 🙂

He wants to withdraw from NATO, which would make Putin happy. Instability with trump. Of course they want anyone else!

Every time they tried to meet with trump on serious matters, like #ClimateChange Trump was doing his usual bragging about how smart &amp; popular he was. He withdrew from the WHO, refused to give a visa to any ICC people investigating

If #GOPBetrayedAmerica get in, they could make it more difficult for #Americans who are unemployed due to #COVID19. Like the food stamps, above. Or evictions.
1318081040179552256 2020-10-19 14:46:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> #Maine #Mainers #SARAGIDEON has been targeted in local print media, the pieces commissioned by the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry.  Don't fall for it.

1318073880414625792 2020-10-19 14:17:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae This has been going on for hours, 8 maybe. One news report says he wants to talk to trump or the media. I would think by now they have a net or air-filled something underneath
1318071775817650177 2020-10-19 14:09:34 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae 🤦🏼‍♀️ he's whipped the unstable up to a frenzy.  Now does trump talk to him, spin himself as a savior?  Or does he ignore him, figure he's one of his base, not worth his time?

Without the Saudis &amp; Putin deciding Trump was someone they could manipulate &amp; keep his finances afloat long enough for him to become President, trump would have gone bankrupt yet again. Daddy couldn't bail him out anymore.

And then there's the Kurt's, or what survived of the Kurt's after we abandoned them. #America has turned into a disgraceful ally under trump

But would you behead someone who mentioned Orlando, because there were 9 fewer deaths? Or those who lost children in Parkland, because it was only 27 children? It's not rude, it's personal. We need gun laws, not infighting

Instead of taking me to the GFM link on Firefox, it took me to a regular opening FF page, with the collections box. Not even the link on the pg. It shouldn't be impossible to do this.

Why no #COVID19 relief bill that helps people instead of corporations &amp; millionaires is coming out of the #GOPBetrayedAmerica Senate?
1317745319430418433 2020-10-18 16:32:21 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @KPlatt444 This is true. So mean &amp; nasty, never heard people so willing to not only be cruel, but actually be filmed doing so. Grandkids will have this record, see who they really are

1317741185499197440 2020-10-18 16:15:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Darktuesday Hey! What kind of reporting is this? The Senate #GOPBetrayedAmerica bill makes a millionaire tax break permanent, gives businesses immunity from liability for #COVID19 unsafe working conditions, no moratorium on evictions. The tax break, rescinded, would pay for #COVID19 relief

How stupid do you think people are, to believe Hunter flew cross country to a hole in the wall repair shop, abandoning a computer with sensitive Information? Did Rudy make this up? 🤦🏼‍♀️

Been in the highs &amp; lows, likely for longer than you've been alive. Believe the people who love you. Keep away from negative people until you're feeling more hopeful 🥰

1317001455518142464 2020-10-16 15:16:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ElsaTheActual I live in a legal marijuana State. You don't get in the door without a standard photo ID, showing you're 21. There are daily purchase limits. Even with the tax, it's cheaper than street weed. Police are trained to spot high driving, but it's not a problem. It's very profitable
1316999839847084033 2020-10-16 15:10:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @BobscratchGfarb I know, right? A calm, intelligent town hall.  Everyone had been respectful to each other. It was like noxema on a sunburn

So they dumbed them down, inserted his name as much as possible, so they would hold his interest. Didn't work for long

He will try to kick it to the #SCOTUS, which will mean a 1 vote per State. We need to carry the House. We need to turn the Senate, or they will obstruct healthcare, #COVID19  relief

1316924593014247428 2020-10-16 10:11:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae A Veteran was sitting outside Safeway. I asked him about his hat. He had been in the Marines, like my Dad, but a Vietnam Vet, waiting for the VA office to open, problems with checks. Luckily I had cash on me &amp; gave him $20. He was surprised. Just said to pay it forward.
1316922636841209856 2020-10-16 10:03:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Did you see the Town Halls? Healthcare? Nothing but promises from Trump. He's had 4 years. But he has a case before the SCOTUS to repeal the #ACA. Biden will strengthen the ACA, make it more affordable, even keep your private insurance.  #VoteBidenHarris  #ONEV1 #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/D2kqhg5YSu
1316918818703396867 2020-10-16 09:48:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo A national standard would have stopped the spread of #COVID19. Like New Zealand,  we could have been having live sports WITH an audience, bars, plays, movies. I miss going to the movies!
1316917477654384640 2020-10-16 09:42:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo That's true. The police are supposed to protect ALL #Americans, not just the white ones.  But there are white supremacists infiltrating both the police &amp; military. Ask the FBI, who reported on this? Truth. Getting rid of the bad ones will leave the good police able to function

1316308889491525632 2020-10-14 17:24:29 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Laura_HBIC I also noticed her degrees in math and physics, yet she was aiming to work in vocational psychology. Those are not easy subjects. With her drive, who knows what her contributions might have been in those areas?  Racism &amp; sexism caused us all to lose out.

1316130359940018177 2020-10-14 05:35:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> ✅ I just checked and protected my voter registration in Ore. with @resistbot. You should too, it takes two minutes:  1️⃣ Tap  https://t.co/545GdB5ysS 2️⃣ Press Send &amp; follow the prompts; or 📲 Text CHECK to 50409

Simple clip on the finger for 10 seconds. I bought 2 online. Happy they're taking this seriously

1315974452539084800 2020-10-13 19:15:33 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd It's heartbreaking. People's lives buried under debris 😪. Living under threat of evacuation from fires for weeks is unnerving, but the suddenness of tornadoes, unpredictability, would be harder, imo.

Then they lose a family breadwinner, have d.e.a.t.h arrangements to pay, they get laid off, can't pay the rent or mortgage. And nobody gets immune. No other country has found immunity after #COVID19

Kind of tells you something, yes?  So #TrumpIsALaughingStock steals music, video of people.  Be careful, they may loot CCTV &amp; use the images.

Even if you don't care about them THEY are going to be the workforce, the tax base, when you're hitting retirement. Malnourished, sickly, even d.e.a.d children can't keep a country running. Hungry children can't learn. How will we compete in the world

1315942750932459521 2020-10-13 17:09:35 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Lon_S_J I like that Steve Bullock is involved.

1315934355412324352 2020-10-13 16:36:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @PeggyStuart I kind of would like a lawyer to be making decisions about law. Would you want your doctor to be drilling your teeth instead of your dentist? Your dentist fixing your car? No!  Expertise, education is invaluable

Out with a hooker while his pregnant wife sits alone? Serial adulterer. Credible charges of rape that he's trying to use the Presidency to shield himself from?

1315803417239928833 2020-10-13 07:55:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Roseamund @AmyMcGrathKY So many jobs that pay enough to raise a family now require education. Or at least a decent enough foundation in the basics to be trainable for a job. Social promotions hurt in the long run.

Like the liquor industry (sales up 55% since #COVID19), it's doing big business. In 2017 the US Government collected $4.7 BILLION dollars in taxes on almost $13 billion in revenue.

1315757537283588096 2020-10-13 04:53:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV 🤣🤣🤣🤣 must have been some good-smelling dirt!  Be happy it wasn't 🐴💩. My dog once found some &amp; rolled in it like it was a religious experience 🤦🏼‍♀️
1315756807587987456 2020-10-13 04:50:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Exactly! Thanks for the history lesson

1315755884270637057 2020-10-13 04:47:03 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV That's what kills me 😳😳😳. The same authoritarian government this guy is preaching about would haul his self off to a gulag if he disobeyed any order, including a mask. Don't get to cherry-pick, people.
1315754393728245760 2020-10-13 04:41:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  IslandGirl finds these treasures for us so we don't have to, thanks!
1315748984615440384 2020-10-13 04:19:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is great! Do you know how bad it has been for #America for Republicans to vote for Democrats? @spenser2020 will be a fine Rep for OR-2. She doesn't think raking the forests will stop the fires or support the man who does  #ONEV1 #BlueDot
1315747053604020224 2020-10-13 04:11:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> We may be tired of fundraising appeals, wondering how much we can stretch our $. But it's a war, 22 days until the final day. Look how much they raised. Adding trump's name doubled donations 😳 🤦🏼‍♀️  #ONEV1  #wtp2020  #GTCBlue

That isn't who we are.  Hunters, sport shooters, ppl who live too far away from a timely police response. That isn't going to happen.

There are depressed ppl who would never kill themselves, have seen devastated family aftermath. But they may still need a gun where they live.

I've known someone who was at their best, slightly abrasive, but go-getters, could be fun to be around. Without constraints, they were a lot like Guifoyle.  An inner hardness &amp; lack of empathy can be so foreign that it goes unrecognized for awhile. Like Guifoyle, divorced

He goes through the motions because the ppl who vote for him are Christian. If he was in Muslim country, he'd be going to a mosque. Anything to gain &amp; keep power.

1315447601408307200 2020-10-12 08:22:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ABC @jonkarl Trump was down to relative chump change when he started running for President in 2016. Then the Koch bros, Mercers, Oligarchs, Saudis, bought influence.
1315446308568670208 2020-10-12 08:16:54 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo That's a terrible list. Why would a President shun allies for evil dictators, enemies of our country?  #ByeDon2020. We're going back to a better class of people

1315424594811994112 2020-10-12 06:50:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Their endorsement of #Biden is good news. People who are of faith should give this a thought. Those who claim to be but it's just a cultural custom, carry on as usual 😖  #ONEV1 #BlueDot  #wtpBlue  #GTCBlue

If ppl hadn't turned out in #'s to vote, we wouldn't have had the House. #SocialSecurity, #Medicare #Medicaid the #ACA, #RoevWade would be gone. No clean air regs, all the "Isms" legal.

1315087945703981057 2020-10-11 08:32:54 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> So she's obviously partisan, can't impartially follow the stare decisis principles of the #SCOTUS. Think the #GOPHypocrisy will vote not to confirm her for her bias affecting her work? I wish they'd surprise me but I've seen differently.

1315083984318033920 2020-10-11 08:17:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @KevinVanAusdal So now that you've withdrawn, in an untimely manner, what becomes of the $100k?
1315083574232576000 2020-10-11 08:15:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @KevinVanAusdal Just over the deadline for the Democratic party to field another candidate. Did that facor into your decision? Sept 3rd would have been ok. 8 days later is just suspicious.

Get reps in office who will void it or do the workaround. We accomplish nothing sitting back, unhappy

If the #ACA is voided by the majority that Barrett provides, health ins corps can charge what they want. Vote @AmyMcGrathKY because it's in your best interests
1313731861772787712 2020-10-07 14:44:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @BobscratchGfarb Why would anyone vote for someone who wants to cancel your health insurance?😳 During a Pandemic? 😳 Without any replacement? 😳  That's just crazy voting!  Vote for @mjhegar, who wants to keep you insured &amp; healthy.
1313730345624203264 2020-10-07 14:38:16 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Earl Blumenaur has served OR-03 &amp; should continue. He has the values we hold: #COVID19 relief, for us, small restaurants, save the #USPS, &amp; more.

In #Florida, a woman admitted to shoplifting to feed her children. She used to have a good job. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace &amp; the #GOPHypocrisy's policies let #COVID19 spread while supporting corporations &amp; the 1%

1313597941634932736 2020-10-07 05:52:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw The 🖤 of the #COVID19 relief bill by the #Senate, pushed by #MoscowMitch, is giving corporations like these immunity. They k.i.l.l.e.d workers, &amp; the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry insists they get off free.

Then would give the order for factories to make more.

1312107585894408199 2020-10-03 03:10:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bparnell @SofiadelCielo I'm sure he'll be tested repeatedly.  Trump &amp; Biden were 6 feet apart at all times. Not even an elbow bump.  If Biden wears an n95 mask properly, &amp; people are also masked it should be fine
1312104892144574465 2020-10-03 02:59:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd Wow, all I did during the pandemic was grow awesome tomatoes, zucchini, &amp; jalapeño peppers.  I feel like an underachiever. But I'm happy there are people in this world, still alive to make music &amp; art.  Stay safe Justin &amp; everyone!
1311967883681964032 2020-10-02 17:54:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae Especially as the renegotiated, substantially increased prenup that got her to stay with him is in danger of not being paid. Accounts frozen 🤭

1311944352780873729 2020-10-02 16:21:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @KPlatt444 No surprise there
1311942654196809729 2020-10-02 16:14:38 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump will do a phone interview, to voice support for vulnerable seniors? About #COVID19 exposure?  Sounds like he's trolling for votes. Trump &amp;the #GOPBetrayedAmerica prevented programs passing that would have given REAL help to seniors #ONEV1 #wtpBlue  #GTCBlue
1311925639708995584 2020-10-02 15:07:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC 🤣🤣🤣 maybe they can rustle up kid rock, the born into money singer posing as a redneck. Or washed up actors like Scott Baio &amp; James Woods? 🤭
1311924951675355136 2020-10-02 15:04:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC Both of them, hearts of stone.

1311902440103399424 2020-10-02 13:34:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV There's no class, no grace, about Melania. She cares only for herself. #Americans, even the First Lady role are an annoyance to her.  So different from Dr. Jill Biden.
1311889015361028096 2020-10-02 12:41:29 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump thinks our soldiers &amp; our police are pervs like him. He blames them for getting Hope Hicks sick, says they just want to kiss her 😳

Don't let Abbott # the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry win #VoteOutEveryRepublican
1311867962073124865 2020-10-02 11:17:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> We want a landslide on 11/3 to leave no doubt!

1311855382378102785 2020-10-02 10:27:50 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Take a screenshot of this. Read it before you vote, take it with you in case you run into problems.  Your vote has never been so important
1311854377980682240 2020-10-02 10:23:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC And no, doesn't care about us at all. Doesn't even care about his supporters. If Trump cared about them, he wouldn't be working so hard to end the #ACA during a pandemic
1311853898487881728 2020-10-02 10:21:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LadyJYYC He's probably freaking out. Trump's a germophobe. He works closely with Hope Hicks. She can cajole him into things better than anyone there. So he's likely been exposed

1311400596948221953 2020-10-01 04:20:41 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @lunaticopresid1 We still need to deal with the right proportion of Biden voters coming from States, thanks to the Electoral College. Then there's voter suppression, "magic" voting machines erasing votes, &amp; people not following instructions on absentee ballots, causing them to be voided. 🤦🏼‍♀️
1311399191206338561 2020-10-01 04:15:06 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @raveninak @HamillHimself That's exactly what I said would happen. If there's a 2nd Presidential debate, they need to shut off trump's mike when Biden or the moderator are speaking. Or soundproof booths, sound on when it's their turn. I think Biden could handle that, but trump? He'd spend his 2 min 🤯🤬

Parscale got an $800,000 forgivable "loan" from the small business funds in the 1st #COVID19 relief package. I figure they're taking advantage of his breakdown. Or are they paying him to stage this, accept the charges, plead mental illness?

1311376983331233792 2020-10-01 02:46:51 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV He's so right!  We rise above our troubles. We see this all the time. But trump just wants to brand people, big "x" marking them forever with their lowest moments. Why would anyone want a person like trump even around? You wouldn't want him in your life, why put him in office?
1311375595322789888 2020-10-01 02:41:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Trump &amp; the #TrumpCrimeFamily, the #GOPComplicitTraitors are desperate to keep power &amp; avoid prosecution. They're throwing everything at the wall, hoping something sticks.  If trump wins, it would be worth millions to them, selling off America.

We grow &amp; change through our experiences, what we read, what we see. Is it inconceivable that Biden has, too?  I agree about M4A, but still, enhanced #ACA is much better than trump's plan
1311184995633958912 2020-09-30 14:03:58 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo Right? That's why he's so ruthless now. Trump knows he can't hide behind the Presidency when it comes to being held accountable for his shady deals &amp; multimillion dollar personal loan. Oligarchs don't take kindly to being stiffed

1311183728157237248 2020-09-30 13:58:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> That's not respecting our troops. That's rubbing your hands together gleefully like the gluttony version of Mr. Burns, thinking now he's got 'em
1311140124311207942 2020-09-30 11:05:40 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Limmered This is true. But no surprise. We don't matter to Trump.  #BidenWonTheDebate
1311139720085164034 2020-09-30 11:04:03 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @GrammyGC5 @JoeBiden Absolutely! Joe Biden is the ONLY candidate who bothered to acknowledge the families who have lost one of their own to #COVID19.  #BidenWon because he actually has concern for us
1311137295165054977 2020-09-30 10:54:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Does anyone believe that Trump paid "millions of dollars" in taxes?    Don't you think if he had, he would show proof?  #ONEV1  #OVDB  https://t.co/2VAxu2eAg7

1311134525968142336 2020-09-30 10:43:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump says 91% of our #Veterans, our #USMC #USAF #USArmy #USNavy, say they are satisfied with the VA. I have to ask our military, is this true?  Are you happy with the VA?  #ONEV1  #PresidentialDebate2020  #WTP2020  #GTCBlue
1311132094769160192 2020-09-30 10:33:45 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump is just a one-note joke, "crooked Hillary"? 🤦🏼‍♀️  Trump is like your grandfather who tells stories from the past.  He's in a Presidential debate,  can he stay on topic?

But we in the USA are dealing with ppl who are undereducated, on purpose. Enough to hold employment (sort of), &amp; geographically isolated. And fox news &amp; other propaganda networks that reassure them that THEY are fine
1311080710371901440 2020-09-30 07:09:34 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> See? Biden PAYS his taxes. Trump? Not so much.  I'd rather vote for the person who isn't a crook

1311072325672923139 2020-09-30 06:36:15 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Trump is terrified. In his quiet time inside the bunker, he knows he’s getting creamed.  We can take the Senate too.

I'm not familiar with the breed, but they're pretty common in the PNW. I'm used to Shepherds, Collies, Retrievers, Wolfdogs, mix of the above breeds

They want the  city to dissolve into violence, so trump can point out how scary &amp; lawless these sanctuary cities are. I bet Roger Stone had something to do with this plan.

If only 1 source of many confirms my beliefs, I'd wonder about their truth. I agree, they can be decent ppl. They'd give you accurate directions, help if your car died. But my experience is as a white woman

Unless you don't like having affordable healthcare, especially during a pandemic which shows no signs of going away. 2 weeks on a ventilator can ruin you financially.  Do you want that?  #ONEV1 #BlueDot
1309761755287965696 2020-09-26 15:48:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Willie Nelson has a song for Election Day called 'Vote Em Out' 🙂.  Very catchy!  #ONEV1 #WTP2020 #GTCBlue  https://t.co/z2D8kKeGSf

A recent article said a mother of 4 is shoplifting to feed her children. Another family is living off a children's lemonade stand.

1308898795934150660 2020-09-24 06:39:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @IslandGirlPRV Heartbreaking. Especially when you compare Trump &amp; the #GOPBetrayedAmerica's response to rebuilding Hurricane Maria's damage right away 🤬
1308897401307041800 2020-09-24 06:33:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Qanon newbies (not expecting to get through to the obsessed). Did you know that Adrenochrome, the chemical that supposedly is extracted from children's brains, is available to researchers, 25mg for $55? Kind of makes no sense, the whole child brain thing, does it?  #ONEV1  https://t.co/JltHyWM0wA

If I had children I'd be giving them Narnia or The Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey instead. H.a.t.e doesn't need a platform

It's bad enough trump &amp; the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry is selling their elected office to help the rich &amp; corporations loot our country.

1308848907661778946 2020-09-24 03:21:11 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd It's gotten to the point where trump could literally shoot someone (not in NYC though), &amp; he's corrupted our government so much that none of his corrupt judges would convict him, or his corrupt DOJ would even indict. Look at this guy, breaking the law. No big deal.

Who paid his million+ mortgage, country club dues, massive credit card debt? And there's the college rapes. The #GOP didn't care, but it may be enough to get him disbarred. And you can't be on the SCOTUS if you're not a lawyer.

We had no power for less than a week due to fires. I can't imagine years 😳. A shabby way to treat people

1307216447328854016 2020-09-19 15:14:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LMLohrey Yes, and there's no reason to think it won't happen. The new SCOTUS gives the contested election to trump. He rules via executive order, Cabinet. Totally backed by the SCOTUS. How much would he be able to bypass Congress?

If it gets disruptive, Erik Prince &amp; the nameless military will swoop in. Maybe even send troops. Trump would like that. Everyone will be called antifa, &amp; he'll "law &amp; order".

1307195488869834752 2020-09-19 13:51:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Next, there's nothing stopping the Senate approving Barr as #RBG's replacement. It would make him hard to prosecute or subpoena.  #ONEV1 #WTP2020  #GTCBlue  https://t.co/htYtOXTJ3c
1307195484570673155 2020-09-19 13:51:04 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Am I the only 1 who thinks the timing of #RBG's passing is "convenient"? The election outcome is bound to be contested by Trump &amp; wind up before the SCOTUS.  #ONEV1 #WTP2020  #GTCBlue  https://t.co/NM689vn2nY
1307185906701402112 2020-09-19 13:13:01 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @sharkyrae I know RBG was very sick, but considering our current administration, I'm suspicious. Autopsy? Did Barr visit her?  This is too convenient for a likely contested election outcome.

He cares about HIS money, who's going to pay him, his power. The more power, the more money, the more people have to suck it up &amp; be deferential to him. I bet his wife has to call him Leader

White Houston got rebuilt, #PR got paper towels. Once the election has passed, Latinex ppl will be forgotten, reviled again if trump gets in. Remember this when you vote

There's a reason trump is steering ppl to voting machines. Still, if you have to vote in person, request a paper ballot. If you must use a machine, bring a magnifying glass, check accuracy
1307060994703847424 2020-09-19 04:56:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo I read where one woman said to get your stamp canceled at the post office, then drop it off yourself. A lot of work, but the next 4 years, our country, is at stake. Check to see if its doable
1307060119960776704 2020-09-19 04:53:11 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo I read where a lot are registering their accounts in Canada. All it takes is a VPN switching your location. There are free ones too, but not as smooth as the paid ones. So yes, unhappy voters.
1307056191433060353 2020-09-19 04:37:34 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Cooksey__ Can you tell the difference between continuous &amp; continual?  Mich has been in office continuously, w/out interruption. All #KY has gotten is near bottom ranking: healthcare, economy, education. Biden has been in DC continually, which means frequently. Diff jobs. We got the #ACA.
1307053049496641536 2020-09-19 04:25:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> A great way to enjoy! Happy child, happy puppies.  #ONEV1  #OVTTDS

Once again, there's another recall petition for our Gov Kate Brown. It's run by our outnumbered #GOPBetrayedAmerica, supported by those who think convenience &amp; comfort outweigh science &amp; the often lethal pandemic

As opposed to those who attend a boarding school for magic, there are real people who see themselves negatively portrayed.

It's pretty telling that #VoteBlue people would be ok with this, but not the #GOPCorruptionOverCountry.

1307039999003627521 2020-09-19 03:33:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> What to do about your signature likely not matching your registration signature?

His voter pool may be too sick or d.e.a.d to vote! And to backtrack now is to admit the Democrats, science were right! 🤣🤣🤣
1306890105840267266 2020-09-18 17:37:36 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jpierni Trump wants people to vote by machine. There are reports of Florida machines "erasing" votes. No wonder he doesn't want voting that can't be hacked!

1306879887114932224 2020-09-18 16:57:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MichaelSteele If only it just affected them. I have no problem at this point, letting the defiantly ignorant catch #COVID19 &amp; d.i.e or worse. But they can i.n.f.e.c.t the innocent
1306879327729078277 2020-09-18 16:54:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> If you're in #Florida #FloridaForBiden #FloridaKeys you should read this. 😳 Vote-erasing machines. Absentee ballot,  paper vote, avoid the macines.  There's a reason Trump is pressuring ppl to use them, &amp; here it is.  They're going to erase your vote

1306871260819779585 2020-09-18 16:22:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Jeff Helfrich commercials have chased me from 10 Pluto channels in 20 minutes. GOP PACS, out of State interests are forking over a huge amount of money to buy him an #Oregon State Rep job. He's gonna owe them big. I'd rather stick with Anna Williams, who's doing a great job

1306855456153894912 2020-09-18 15:19:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Look at this - stealing from the Firefighters who rescued ppl buried under rubble. Who inhaled concrete dust, burned plastics &amp; toxic chemicals from burned electronics, insulation, pulverized glass. They're suffering &amp; trump is stealing the money set aside to take care of them 😳

1306466904391917568 2020-09-17 13:35:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Brewing was able to expend into this community because of this. Add better services for the aged. Nobody who lives here would vote for anyone but Anna Williams. She works for us, 🇺🇸 why mess with success?
1306466903548813312 2020-09-17 13:35:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Anna Williams helped to pass the most comprehensive paid family/medical leave in the nation, increased educational funding for rural schools, $1.7 million for emergency storm sewer repairs in Hood River, $2.4 million economic dev, infrastructure in Cascade Locks. pFriem Family
1306466902718390273 2020-09-17 13:35:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> The incumbent Democrat he &amp; big $ is trying to get rid of is Anna Williams. 45% of her donors are people, while Helfrich only has 2%. Less than 54% of her budget is PAC $. 98% vs 54%, do the math. Why do the Republicans, including out of State, want to get rid of Anna Williams?
1306466901288124417 2020-09-17 13:35:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Every 10 minutes, multiple channels, 6 days so far. Where's the money coming from? 98% of his contributions are from business &amp; Political Action Committees. $25,400 comes from out of State. Who do you think Helfrich will represent in Salem?  Not us  https://t.co/9ZfW6yfNc2
1306466897961971712 2020-09-17 13:35:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Do you know who Jeff Helfrich is?  If you watch ANY Pluto channel you know the name.

Dr Fauci- Sending kids to multiple communities after an outbreak on campus is the worst thing you could do.  #TrumpVirus  #GTCBlue @GTCBlue #GTCB091  https://t.co/ksEKmgPZWu

1306377410091216897 2020-09-17 07:40:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Maidstone7 @BResisting I think it's sometimes having problems with ppl who tweet frequently, maybe also with some irate content?  Under the circumstances, it's hard to find a Resisters who isn't irate 🤔
1306376616612831233 2020-09-17 07:37:11 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @JMFDSJ @BResisting What Joanne said ☝️.  Np 🙂
1306376300844597248 2020-09-17 07:35:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw I tried to buy both n95 masks &amp; replacement air filter for a relative with breathing problems, &amp; another whose work has him out, among many ppl. No such thing as next day Prime anymore, or even 2 day. It's all taking a week, same as regular stores.

1306358525879185408 2020-09-17 06:25:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @BonJS0370 @AOL I heard #TrumpIsATraitor talk about not wearing masks at the indoor taxpayer funded campaign stop. #Trump said not wearing, encouraging masks wasn't a problem because HE was up on stage away from the crowd. NO concern for the ppl who came to see him. None. #VoteForBidenHarris
1306356611607224321 2020-09-17 06:17:41 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw I read about the effects of particulate smoke from wildfires. They're working w/out N95 masks. Particulates can work their way out of lungs into the bloodstream 😬. These are our people! Can we elect a President who believes in #ClimateChange, not 1 whose policies make it worse?
1306355453471813632 2020-09-17 06:13:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw If they had a better plan, would #TrumpIsALoser &amp; the #GOPBetrayedAmerica have a case scheduled for AFTER the election, in front of the SCOTUS, to throw out the #ACA? How sneaky is that?
1306354784849465345 2020-09-17 06:10:26 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw I heard trump doing his tired litany of promising a health plan, same 💩 he was saying in 2016. But #TrumpHasNoCredibility, no health plan. The one he tried to sell cut out preexisting conditions &amp; worse. Thank you Senator McCain for being the deciding vote against.
1306353291526193152 2020-09-17 06:04:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @kayranmon Can't read the WaPo article.  They really think #Kentucky will reelect #MoscowMitchMcTreason? Why?😳 #Kentuckydeservesbetter #AmyMcGrath2020
1306352197588803584 2020-09-17 06:00:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo This is so moving 😢, and so telling. Trump's Parkland tweet was about himself, weaseling out of Russian accusations. Biden not only took the time to speak personally, he remembered the grieving father a year later. On sight.  Who do YOU want running our country? #VoteBidenHarris

1306338558106415104 2020-09-17 05:05:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @gsjh59 I miss the way it used to be.  Not just protecting Trump though. There's a strong current of self-centeredness. Not "We The People", but "ME The Person".  We used to look out for each other. I guess that's another trump gift to the USA

1306331786104897536 2020-09-17 04:39:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @fisher_ccp0513 My reaction to this was that his question was direct, comprehensive, on point. It deserved a similar reply, not lies. The expression on his face showed he didn't think much of the answer. Why are you screaming?
1306330837655326720 2020-09-17 04:35:16 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @fisher_ccp0513 And that's what that little thing to the far left is for, people replying. I suppose any reply could be considered "attached". You didn't indicate that you wanted no comments.

1306173328533585920 2020-09-16 18:09:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @glennkirschner2 There's money being spread around here, &amp; no upside to them getting "disloyal" at this stage. If they lose, they still have their megabucks from those that paid them to support trump's policies, Congressional pension.  If they win, more of the same.

1306144847070294016 2020-09-16 16:16:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ItsMeMsVee Well sure, Gen Z will be about 35 years old when we reach the point where #ClimateChange will reach the point of no return.  When that happens, it will be a slow, painful extinction of natural disasters, food not growing, poverty &amp; worse. If they #VoteBlueDownBallot there's hope

He recruited a guy to go to his coke dealer's house in a UPS uniform. The lawyer was going to k.i.l.l. the dealer, steal the coke &amp; the guy keep any cash. The guy told police.

1306087205916430336 2020-09-16 12:27:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd Why don't they use Twitt's music instead of stealing from Springsteen, Young, John, the Stones &amp; others?  Could it be no one wants to hear Twitt?

A little weed, happy movies like A Princess Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas. SciFi: Babylon 5, Quantum Leap, early Stargate, Farscape.  Lucifer is fun. I caught up, but that last episode ending? 😳🤯. What a cliffhanger!
1306081692784812032 2020-09-16 12:05:16 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Jennagizer81 I like to think JKRowling's literary career, content, &amp; relevance ended at Harry Potter.  The excerpts from this new pseudonym series are thinly-disguised bashing, hate-tirades at best.  Let this series d.i.e, panned, unread, shunned.  Like the author.

And if he gets away with ending Social Security, that money never has to be paid back, even though it came from paychecks
1306076660064595973 2020-09-16 11:45:16 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> So over 80% of us didn't benefit by trump's policies,  tax cuts over the past years. Google "trump tax cut benefits " &amp; see that the middle class is left out. WHY is anyone not a millionaire voting for him?

People &amp; businesses survived because the government paid people monthly, so they could pay rent, not be evicted, keep businesses going.

As Fred's favorite, daddy always fixed things. The #GOPBetrayedAmerica did the same. So if he sabotages himself, he expects someone will clean up &amp; protect him

1305408452882083840 2020-09-14 15:30:03 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @idew2 Excellent! Good, patient job! People believe what they hear, 🤦🏼‍♀️. Think they'd learn? Qanon is just so strange. Celebrities draining chemicals out of children?

That's what trump did with the economy. Social Security owns most of US debt. If they cancel #SS as they're trying to, they don't have to pay out our money.

We're being ripped open, the ugliness uncovered. And some think if we go back to the 50's, it will all go away. Bad never goes away unless confronted

1305335241125425153 2020-09-14 10:39:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Doh_Doh_Burrd Trump is just 1 fly obsession &amp; 200 added pounds away from being Renfield

We're having a hard enough time w/the ignorant/self-centered not covering mouth &amp; nose to prevent #COVID19 spread. Do we need a bad example on national TV?
1305221938827067392 2020-09-14 03:08:54 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @firefox I HATE that there's no "open new tab" anymore. Used to be in the drop-down menu. If one search leads to another, this makes it difficult/frustrating.  I'm now using Chrome for that reason.  Bring it back!

Someone suggested going to the post office, getting your mail-in ballot stamp postmarked THEN hand-delivering it.  We're up against desperate cheaters w/lots of $

To do this after shunning our wounded #Vets, dishonoring our fallen soldiers, &amp; calling our soldiers losers is a pointed statement. #TrumpHatesVeterans &amp; he's so sure of his reelection that he's not even trying to hide it.
1304874242803081216 2020-09-13 04:07:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MollyRaePatric3 how are you doing? Also in Oregon, so far zone 1 🤞

Defending isn't eliminating. It's reallocating funds for mental health, etc, freeing them to do actual police work.  Where's the problem? 🤷🏼‍♀️
1304872410374569984 2020-09-13 04:00:00 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @MollyRaePatric3 Very scary 😬.

1304864394581401601 2020-09-13 03:28:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @StuPolitics I'm so sorry 😭. 1st you mourn, then you get angry. Find out why. Get their $. If they're selling sickly dogs $ is all they care about. If you went to a breeder for a specific breed, know there are breed-specific rescues. Google the breed (as in "pit bull rescue"), &amp; you'll see.
1304862955708665856 2020-09-13 03:22:26 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @educated_educ8r Yes. It also means you're actually a godless atheist. No religion condones the actions of trump &amp; the #GOPHypocrisy. Too many d.e.a.t.h.s, cruelty. Supporting them means your religion is just a social group, like joining the Grange or Kiwanis. Might as well own up to it  https://t.co/HrHKIb2ABQ

But you don't have to vote for trump. Check to make sure it isn't also pre-filled out for trump as well, with a "busybox" thing to check, to make you feel like you voted

Kamala speaks her mind &amp; it sounds fine.   Pence? Even trump admired Pence's being able to talk for minutes &amp; say nothing. Not what you want as the VP is it?

1304687720464224257 2020-09-12 15:46:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @DaviesBooks What is wrong with @SenThomTillis, that he doesn't care about "his" ppl, yet expects them to vote for him? Isn't #NC part of a 1st world country? All the other 1st world countries have healthcare? Why does he think we're "not as good" as ppl in England, Canada, Ireland, Scotland?

And there was trump after the towers had fallen, bragging about how his buildings were the tallest &amp; looking to elbow ppl who lost everything out of the way to get reconstruction, business help money.  That's why NYC didn't vote for trump. They KNEW him.  Do you? By now?

1304110626210340864 2020-09-11 01:32:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral @SpicyCayenne9 🤦🏼‍♀️  Just where do you expect this ice to come from? Local stores, no power no ice. Surrounding areas? Bought out. Please stop suggest "just put ice" on our dying food. It looks very insensitive, like "don't the common ppl have unlimited ice 24/7 as we do"?
1304108538818510853 2020-09-11 01:24:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral extra water - not in areas where no power = no water. What to plug the cell chargers into? No power. No ice. Everyone else without power bought up ice, dry ice, generators.  I know you mean to help, but this list to ppl who've had no power for 48+ hrs, is just taunting
1303871352894451713 2020-09-10 09:42:09 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Thank you! I DM-ed my info.

Little did I know that, living near a major city, I'd have to buy gear like I was living off the grid. I actually lived in a small town. Ice storms, huge trees, blizzards, heat wave. Always power
1303847758009253909 2020-09-10 08:08:24 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Even stranger, since our 38 hr long power outage wasn't showing, I reported it. Turns out your system has it happening @ 12:59pm TODAY. Wth, people? Are you just making jokes at our expense?  https://t.co/uW0TjmWAFk
1303843030122725376 2020-09-10 07:49:37 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Now you're just being cruel.  I sit with frozen food rotting, phone dying, promised electric on time a lie. LOOK at your tracker. It says NO OUTAGES. Where's our power if there's no outages?  https://t.co/20pBWoR92p
1303841199141257217 2020-09-10 07:42:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral We actually had a time of 4:30 today for power restoration.  38 hours later.  But no, came and went. I bet you're all laughing "suckers", no go scramble for the ice that everyone who didn't believe us went out &amp; bought.  The "new" page is a map of the area, &amp; shows NO OUTAGES!
1303766549098975232 2020-09-10 02:45:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @wickman CA, WA or OR?  Can't tell the location by the hellscape anymore 🤦🏼‍♀️

1303756096067088385 2020-09-10 02:04:10 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SusanSarandon @ProudSocialist You're not an activist. This is a triage situation for America, &amp; you're willing for EVERYONE BUT PRIVILEGED YOU to burn under trump 2020. Kids die in cages, Black peopled murdered, the West burns, economic collapse, no health care. No skin off your back. You're worse than Ivanka
1303706969644040192 2020-09-09 22:48:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral I went through a hurricane that washed limousines through streets to rest on piles of cars, 2nd story water. You're projecting a 4 day power wait, longer than hurricane Sandy?  The town water is pumping by generator! Restoration just gets further away.  https://t.co/2crLC8akSX
1303563411108757504 2020-09-09 13:18:30 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ErrolWebber Science is real. If people didn't think more of being affronted by pandemic precautions, than they do about us all in this together, we might be seeing more openings.
1303562809901375488 2020-09-09 13:16:07 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bennyjohnson @alekskarlatos Sure. And let's get control of Oregon's women, next. No abortions, no birth control, trump-like health care, toss the disabled &amp; preexisting condition people into some burning embers cause they're getting trumpcare. No thank you.
1303535110034083840 2020-09-09 11:26:03 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Never mind. Sold out of generators &amp; dry ice EVERYWHERE.
1303483953500876805 2020-09-09 08:02:46 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Now the current update says 6:30pm TOMORROW, 40 hrs later! How accurate is this? Spoiled food riding on your answer.  Am I going to, in this time of COVID19 unemployment, have to shell out $1000 for a generator, or $500 for spoiled food? Why weren't you prepared?
1303477159583870976 2020-09-09 07:35:46 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral I'm guessing power in the PNW is less reliable than power in NYC. We've had more in a year than 5 years elsewhere.
1303476540965941248 2020-09-09 07:33:19 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral Had to go back to start to get accuracy.  Instead of 1300 there's 2500 without power. No estimate for return. More credible than it saying you're going back in time to fix it in the morning. Going to have to buy a generator.  We had to have a cat. 4 hurricane to get outages b4
1303455265749073923 2020-09-09 06:08:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral if you look at the updated time for my zip code, 14 minutes ago, our power is still supposed to be on as of 7 hours ago!🤯 HOW is this an update? We called, they said crew was assigned, but they had no clue as to whether anyone was AT the assigned job, or even left the building.  https://t.co/vy5qHZKLD6
1303415426550915073 2020-09-09 03:30:28 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @portlandgeneral I reported outages, zip code specific.  According to your information, we should have had power back on at 8:15 am.  It's 12:24pm, no power!  Are these estimates from the last power outage? They're all completely WRONG!  Might have more confidence if you had accurate times  https://t.co/DlogEjIUaj
1303253940780244992 2020-09-08 16:48:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @DRajesh_UG4PH Looks like a tiny home on wheels🙂

Arkansas also ranks 42nd in education,, the path out of poverty. Tom Cotten has been in Congress since 2012, what has he done?  Maybe time for a change?

Remember, he gets angry about "disloyalty"? He not only fired Col. Vindeman, but his brother (not involved), as well
1303233076823093248 2020-09-08 15:25:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @paulajean2020 West Virginia is one of the most beautiful places in the country. The people are nice to tourists, passing, throughs, etc.  But there's such poverty. It shouldn't be that way. A good Senator can do much to help with that.  Tell me #WestVirginia, time to change your Senator?
1303230452749090818 2020-09-08 15:15:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SizzleBeauty @JoeBiden See, that's why those who own corporations are donating so heavily to trump &amp; the #GOPBetrayedAmerica.  They don't want UNION jobs, with guaranteed hours, a stable schedule, overtime, representation.  A good union helps to balance power, advocate for workers. #VoteBidenHarris2020

If we had started out our country with trump-like leaders, we'd be living in a gravel pit, chemicals needed to force food to grow in polluted air, poisoned soil. No birds, no bees, no allies.

Time for trump's religious supporters to take stock &amp; decide whether their religion IS a religion, or just a social culture. Is there heaven? Will your actions now, let you through the door? Or are you just pretending?

Nobody knows who you vote for, when you push the lever or fill out the mail-in ballot. If you don't want an unpredictable, rage-filled Rep, then vote your secret ballot for @GusForTX , Gus Trujillo 😉.

Let's ask Noel Castor if Ronny "The Candyman" Jackson was the Adderall supplier during The Apprentice.  Does #TX reward "alleged" drug dealers? 🤔 Fine example for the kids if they do

1302778524906917888 2020-09-07 09:19:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Bernie supporters who are planning on writing him in as President: does this sound like it's what Bernie wants you to do?  I think he's looking for the most practical option to save America from trump2020. You going to tell Bernie you'd rather see it burn cause he didn't  win?

The temptations are huge when you have power, but you're making poverty wages.  Just who's getting the oil &amp; gas money? Time for a change. The GOP needs to be voted out

I know survivors of physical &amp; sexual abuse who have done both. It's helped in creating a life far removed from that, happiness, &amp; even something I can't imagine, forgiving.

We need to do better in spotting neglect &amp; abuse in children, and providing safer living situations as well as therapy to help them heal. Investing in children is investing in America's future.

1302734675958329344 2020-09-07 06:25:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw I also take issue with the author's implying that NYC is just wealthy elites. There's people working all sorts of low-middle wage jobs. Mostly they live in the outer boroughs. But education is there for all. Cultural institutions often have reduced admission days.
1302733575385612289 2020-09-07 06:21:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw Education is important, but it's a chicken or the egg situation. Do they elect the GOP, which won't fund education or do they elect the GOP which won't fund education, because they aren't sufficiently educated.
1302732579531972608 2020-09-07 06:17:05 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> What do you think, Trump supporters?  Is this true?    Are you afraid of us?

Trump can't insult our loved ones who have served, he can't put them down without us remembering this on November 3rd.

There are more white people ready to  address systemic racism than there are those who think that it will go away if we pretend it doesn't exist.   Remember "Here. Right. Matters"?  It does
1302715107865108480 2020-09-07 05:07:39 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Did President Trump keep his promises?  Here are some campaign promises from 2016 &amp; where they are in 2020  You be the judge.  ?  #ONEV1 #WTP2020 #GTCBlue  ‘I Keep My Promises,’ Trump Said. Let’s Check.  https://t.co/DP6U3gUP7b

1302392658430586881 2020-09-06 07:46:21 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jkf3500 The Libertarian Koch, the Heritage Foundation, all wanted to end Social Security. They tried with George Bush Jr. Trump &amp; the fiscal crisis he created with his mismanagement &amp; greed, are the latest. If it wasn't for SS funding the government, there would be plenty of surplus

I am grateful for every one of our military who makes it back home, and mourn those that didn't. I remember my dad &amp; his American Legion post putting flags on the graves of deceased #Veterans.  But trump scorns them, belittles their sacrifice 🤬🤬🤬

1302057831164649472 2020-09-05 09:35:52 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> THIS is the source of trump talking about black clad thugs on a plane.

Do you think trump/#GOPComplicitTraitors have been acting to support our troops? Putin's bounty, taking military family's budget $ for the wall, screwing with #SS, #SSDI, inadequate #PTSD treatment. There's nothing good to write about, so trump stops the press
1301951253790953472 2020-09-05 02:32:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @johnis44 You know none of the #TrumpCrimeFamily is going to be taking any vaccine that hasn't been testing on us 1st. Even if they show them getting the shot on TV, I bet it's sterilized water instead.

Special Ed is very one to one. Even if you work from home, how can you do both? Biden has a plan for this. #TrumpHasNoRespect for our military or families

1301939678724067328 2020-09-05 01:46:22 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CherylBlueWave What's more perplexing is that she's the 2nd white woman to claim an identity as a POC.  A mental illness?  Because once she came out, she negates all her work, maybe even her PH.d, if it was self-referential. She'll certainly lose friends, peers. No $ can make up for isolation

1301807267482759171 2020-09-04 17:00:13 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jpierni No pressure. All stores require masks now. I'm in the Portland area, so I'm fortunate that most people realize you can't bully or bargain with a virus. It's rare to see ppl out &amp; about without one.  There are a minority who keep trying to recall the Gov. They say 2 wks is enough

1301801979014856704 2020-09-04 16:39:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ASky1113 Constantly hear that therapists are treating clients who are stressed, depressed about what's happened to our country.

DeVos, charter school money to religious schools, DeJoy, who has $35-$70 million investment still in his former #USPS competing business. Thieves

Don't they consider themselves the law and order people?

You don't survive a day in the military w/out being self-disciplined, able to work for something bigger than yourself.  Our country will be in good hands if they win. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Should that follow him around forever, negating any potential for good, as you do w/Warren? And Bernie had no concrete plans. He had goals, but no realistic step by step process to achieve them.

1301594361168146432 2020-09-04 02:54:12 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @TheLoris2 Yes! We used to have them back on Staten Island.  Had to stain the porch railing before they arrived. Heavy ppl lean on the thing, and if it's weakened by holes, they'd plummet 14 feet onto concrete

1301445664853749760 2020-09-03 17:03:20 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @SofiadelCielo No, because the process will take longer than there is for election.  And their corporate benefactors want them to push through corporate immunity for putting workers in #COVID19 unsafe conditions. So I don't expect that to happen

It's suspicious behavior, true. Perhaps they're being paid to push through corporate immunity. Remember, they get to keep all unspent campaign funds. Most have a Congressional pension 🤨

1300680417448660994 2020-09-01 14:22:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @tatn That sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Allergies to ketamine, contraindicated with other medications or medical problems. I worked in Psych where violent patients sometimes needed to be restrained. There are techniques. Why can't they be taught this?
1300678349845442563 2020-09-01 14:14:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @tatn Ballot selfie? Is this even a thing? 😳.  Then again, people selfie everything

1300676711554531328 2020-09-01 14:07:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @JustBella That's right, blame the devil. Those seeds were cast on fertile ground
1300675098777583617 2020-09-01 14:01:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LynnoVen @JustBella @male_taurean Yes!  We're all going to be healing from the PTSD of the past couple years
1300673776359583744 2020-09-01 13:56:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @AVindman I've seen tweets by Veterans who are disgusted by trump using our military as props, not standing up for them against Putin, the VA mismanagement, money diverted from military family budget to the wall, SS &amp; more
1300672219765374977 2020-09-01 13:49:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @AVindman That's a horrible position to be in, ordered to stand against the people you've sworn to defend.
1300671791141023745 2020-09-01 13:48:14 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> An excellent thread by THE Alexander Vindeman.
1300670205966741505 2020-09-01 13:41:57 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @lunaticopresid1 He can't say anything bad about Rittenhouse because that's his base. He's run out of supporters
1300668631332790272 2020-09-01 13:35:41 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @lunaticopresid1 Can't believe it's even that high
1300668492933337088 2020-09-01 13:35:08 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @CaptNostradamus @lunaticopresid1 My heart hurts, seeing their pictures. 😪. Then I get 🤬.  We can't give him 4 more years to k.i.l.l American soldiers. These are our brothers, fathers, husbands, &amp; trump sold them out.
1300667619767246848 2020-09-01 13:31:40 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @lunaticopresid1 Trump is rambling worse than usual #TrumpIsUnwell
1300666037780660224 2020-09-01 13:25:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Blake_RESISTS @jasondogwood I believe this.
1300665110944337921 2020-09-01 13:21:42 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jasondogwood Then again, if religion holds its power through fear of the afterlife, what does it say about the validity of that belief, or even religion, when those in charge violate its teachings without fear of consequences?
1300664629534683139 2020-09-01 13:19:47 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jasondogwood The biggest hit to religion will be proof of what happens after you die.  It's all held in place by fear. Religion holds its power through fear of the unknown.
1300663034868764672 2020-09-01 13:13:27 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Blake_RESISTS I don't think they even read the New Testament.
1300661671946383365 2020-09-01 13:08:02 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @NhCardona603 Good Luck Carlos!
1300660981115150336 2020-09-01 13:05:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jennycohn1 This is an excellent article, full of ways to check your in person voting, vote by paper ballot, confirm the machine didn't flip your vote (sounds like you may need a magnifying glass to check the fine print confirmation). Also, where to volunteer to be a poll watcher, etc.
1300658466227331073 2020-09-01 12:55:18 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @peaceandteachin #KenoshaDoesntWantTrump but trump created Kenosha. Trump needs civil unrest to scare people into voting for him. The s.t.u.p.i.d.i.t.y of his thinking is that this happened on his watch as President. So why should anyone think 4 more yrs would be different?
1300651231480696832 2020-09-01 12:26:33 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @bkaydw @landessarjes Right? We never saw Americans pitted against each other when Obama/Biden were in office.
1300649965446787072 2020-09-01 12:21:31 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Hellacort There are a lot of retirees who RV around, get, medical, dental, eyeglasses, prescriptions across the Mexican border.  They're not getting treated. Another group punished by trump ignoring #COVID19.  What did they, or us, do to deserve this punishment?
1300647037227028481 2020-09-01 12:09:53 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @LkMoller13 Yes! The ACLU has this app for many States.
1300646671206895618 2020-09-01 12:08:25 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @PersisterCrone @whitesteven3377 @HelenResists @AP Wow, never saw those pods before.  6 months. Providing Biden/Harris win, 6 months from now will see a turnaround. So live small &amp; healthy as much as you can, &amp; hold on to each other. ❤
1300645628054089728 2020-09-01 12:04:17 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @jo_avg @whitesteven3377 @AP Almost 4 yours of trump gives us fighting in the streets. No matter what, how much more left you would like to see the US turn, that isn't an option right now. So you can do a Cartman &amp; say screw you guys I'm going home, or support Biden/Harris as the best AVAILABLE option
1300635923655225344 2020-09-01 11:25:43 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> If you're thinking of voting GOP, write in, we get trump 2020, armed conflict in the streets, our military turned against its own citizens. Below is a quote from trump on Rittenhouse, who shot unarmed people.  #VoteBidenHarris2020  #VoteBlueDownBallot  #ONEV1 #GTCBlue  #wtpTEAM  https://t.co/ajWHgYJuSx

1300625376800944129 2020-09-01 10:43:48 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @ChaplainheArt 🤦🏼‍♀️ bet it stops working shortly after you buy it, &amp; costs $100 to fix, repeatedly

Instead of buying a yellow summer squash &amp; a zucchini plant, I bought 2 zucchinis 🤦🏼‍♀️😂.  But we wound up eating all the muffins before freezing for the winter
1300614217028886528 2020-09-01 09:59:28 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @Ragdoll_Oscar Beautiful eyes!

1300613830079180801 2020-09-01 09:57:55 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @dodo That's so sweet! Easy to find the prior property owners. A felony in their future?  There really needs to be a list of people who should be prohibited from adopting, or buying a pet.
1300610927163666432 2020-09-01 09:46:23 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> @TwitterSupport twitter is even freezing Chrome!
1300609153711239168 2020-09-01 09:39:21 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> Bill Penzey "gets" it.  His response to Kenosha unrest is understanding &amp; supportive. #ONEV1 #OVTTDS  https://t.co/3QF0s09EsO

1300584641749872641 2020-09-01 08:01:56 +0800 <Sam_and_the_dog> This is serious dirt on the spread of #COVID19.  YES, trump had been briefed about this as early as NOVEMBER.  He just ignored it, because trump doesn't have the skills, foresight or desire to lead our country.  He just wants the prestige of the title &amp; money making opportunities
