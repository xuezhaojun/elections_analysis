1344064983366332416 2020-12-30 07:37:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My instinct is if good enough for supreme court..good enough for AG
1344051724269592577 2020-12-30 06:44:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does not sound so distant when you phrase it that way
1344049779832221699 2020-12-30 06:36:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't read anymore about him headlines is enough. They make a great couple
1344049225324240897 2020-12-30 06:34:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Appreciate his support and strong words, and his honesty
1344049114556866560 2020-12-30 06:34:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Purdue and Loeffler only care about themselves
1344048894334926848 2020-12-30 06:33:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Heard that yesterday or the day before..he was golfing then too as I had tears running down my face. You can be sure he did not
1344048618324582400 2020-12-30 06:32:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is he pushing him down and not letting him up?
1344048362950160386 2020-12-30 06:31:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she took trump lessons..she was once sane and I thought headed for good things..that was then
1344048083726950406 2020-12-30 06:30:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Anniversary to you both. Many, many more years of many more
1344047816801460224 2020-12-30 06:29:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> First guy ever heard made good use of the f bomb in a video
1344047451616014337 2020-12-30 06:27:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if possible? travelers need to make it possible and just stay home no matter how much they would like to be elsewhere..so would we like to go , but, we are staying home because it is possible and necessary
1344047005832773633 2020-12-30 06:25:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is going to be unhappier and angrier..o my
1344042266650939392 2020-12-30 06:07:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and isn't it fun
1344027788433633282 2020-12-30 05:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only think of what melania  did to the White House Rose Garden and have a feeling I would have to agree with donald this time. That woman has no taste whatsoever. Not likely Mar a Lago  would win any renovation awards
1343996720166928384 2020-12-30 03:06:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor jenna..guessing the pollster was at a trump rally
1343984610208854016 2020-12-30 02:17:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very true, he is the first person I have ever seen that is good at using people until he uses them up and when they have no more to give, he trashes them
1343977420630724608 2020-12-30 01:49:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would we expect anything different? And, don't you imagine if trump really wanted it, he would not give the order?
1343977142347042817 2020-12-30 01:48:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am guessing you never looked back in history..and you do not like reality either
1343976762355699715 2020-12-30 01:46:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is talking about himself..
1343976537788477447 2020-12-30 01:45:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because it is all too accurate..just cut off the left side.
1343974846741569539 2020-12-30 01:39:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course they would like 2,000 , they would not dare say no
1343965904409923588 2020-12-30 01:03:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't need to eat them all at onceüòä
1343939688235749376 2020-12-29 23:19:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @presidentelectbiden  hurry we can't hold out much longer
1343939479896285186 2020-12-29 23:18:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Patriots are those who protect the Constitution&amp;do not invent their own laws. they stand for what is right not what gets votes or is popular. From what you write, you are not a patriot &amp; you do not care about your friends in Ohio when you want to send them out to get sick or die
1343938697641779201 2020-12-29 23:15:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because ignorance is bliss?
1343937806746447873 2020-12-29 23:11:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Founders would say throw jim jordan out and find a real American not a trump puppet
1343934977776513037 2020-12-29 23:00:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Were you high when you wrote this?
1343934786587525121 2020-12-29 22:59:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Speak for yourself. Maybe you just travel with the top 2 percent so you do not understand
1343934279353569286 2020-12-29 22:57:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your comments say you have no clue. Would not go to your church. Is your first name pastor because you do not sound like a man of G-d
1343934277696815104 2020-12-29 22:57:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The charity payment will feed and house people. The country is open and if people take proper precautions then maybe it won't spread and people will not get sick or die from covid19. That would be key to fully opening. In the meantime what are you doing to help.
1343932683362119681 2020-12-29 22:51:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess the followers do not realize it is their attitude that people do not want
1343932339307606017 2020-12-29 22:50:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hotel has more sense than trum supporters
1343932075251032067 2020-12-29 22:49:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and a fluffy tail?
1343922648355639297 2020-12-29 22:11:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't tell them, they will stop
1343922526376906753 2020-12-29 22:11:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I try to be polite..but...I see so much  of it though so my patience just gives out..and what I think is not polite
1343921530649145352 2020-12-29 22:07:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I remember when I thought Nikki Haley could offer the country something..then I bring myself into the now and remember she is just another trump follower
1343910053544398856 2020-12-29 21:21:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> insanity..this is all so old ..Pence has a job to do and no matter who says what or  how he adores trump..he needs to do that job.. it is not to assist in turning this into trumpland.
1343766282399789056 2020-12-29 11:50:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because her dads fans would probable vote for her that would not get her into office
1343760983265828865 2020-12-29 11:29:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are a good man Alexander Vindmen and a hero to most of this country I would guess
1343760783457579010 2020-12-29 11:28:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You should have no regrets but you were so wronged.
1343760352610279435 2020-12-29 11:26:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and a terrible human being
1343760110741549056 2020-12-29 11:25:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I luv this scene
1343740483911217159 2020-12-29 10:07:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does not look like harassment to me, but I laughed
1343740295582801920 2020-12-29 10:07:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if you really don't then block her..if you want her attention, bet you got it
1343740072307396609 2020-12-29 10:06:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Crud I missed it. was so excited to see it but.just saw this. Why didn't you guys publicize it more?
1343739827863302145 2020-12-29 10:05:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Must watch it
1343739689493286918 2020-12-29 10:04:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still too high and they are still fools..seriously wonder how many even voted?
1343739443149209601 2020-12-29 10:03:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Discount from what? Probably reprinting the price lists
1343739196830343168 2020-12-29 10:02:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and Biden should put him back on the job..and if trump needs an escort out..should be him and his brother that do the escorting
1343738931217625090 2020-12-29 10:01:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice to see something parler that is true
1343732036968865794 2020-12-29 09:34:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes fight for Constitution and Freedom..not for trump to stomp on the constitution  and freedom of speech and so much more. Why would Biden be the person you would call the enemy.
1343731020592537601 2020-12-29 09:30:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that will be a hell of a great day
1343730918687723523 2020-12-29 09:29:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he wont run in 2024 but he would prob want his kids to run
1343730773090836482 2020-12-29 09:29:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just let him overthrow the government ..do you really want to live in a dictatorship?
1343730587773894656 2020-12-29 09:28:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no let him be pres of your state
1343720011958005760 2020-12-29 08:46:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh that has to be horrible for both you.üôèüôèüôèüôèüò™
1343719514203172869 2020-12-29 08:44:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because of the way Pence looks google eyed at trump, I hope someone is standing over his shoulder
1343719217472933888 2020-12-29 08:43:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very sorry

1343717728108961792 2020-12-29 08:37:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is not even likely that trump would sign if it passed all along the way
1343717561112932352 2020-12-29 08:36:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who is counting? besides you and i?
1343717329960636421 2020-12-29 08:35:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tormenting an alligator?
1343697182390677504 2020-12-29 07:15:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden won
1343696923627298817 2020-12-29 07:14:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we are so good to this guy.and still he craps all over
1343696660711485441 2020-12-29 07:13:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If the senate does what will be trumps excuse
1343696529803128832 2020-12-29 07:13:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> death and illness did..closing was trying to stop spread
1343696389507850243 2020-12-29 07:12:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> scammers on the take?

1343681860614950913 2020-12-29 06:14:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if is real tmobile and they are not just trying to gather information
1343676566014996482 2020-12-29 05:53:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very happy for you all. Apparently she wants to be a nurse!!!!  Worthy of a thank you to her
1343676222530867206 2020-12-29 05:52:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where are 1-3?
1343675922671689730 2020-12-29 05:51:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would do it but first would check to see if mental health costs would be covered by the person giving the 100,000
1343675504235311105 2020-12-29 05:49:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so glad u noticed
1343673526902026241 2020-12-29 05:41:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> depends if all of the trumplikins are thrown out..maybe in a few years it can be
1343671251827630081 2020-12-29 05:32:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that sure was politie

1343670510006235137 2020-12-29 05:29:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> one story said cancer (no excuse) but truth is i do not know anymore than anyone else. so suggest waiting til facts in
1343667705677819904 2020-12-29 05:18:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish her a speedy complete recovery and then tell her?

1343619657194991618 2020-12-29 02:07:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps family
1343611013099380736 2020-12-29 01:33:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> should not rush to judgment..not even for a lunatic bomber
1343610760845529088 2020-12-29 01:32:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't go by emotion must go by facts and they are still checking it out.
1343610470528405509 2020-12-29 01:31:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Taking too long
1343609763263873024 2020-12-29 01:28:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Powerfully awesome or awesomely powerful
1343572625503772672 2020-12-28 23:00:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probably golfed and skied on taxpayer dime
1343568884683714562 2020-12-28 22:45:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does russia love them too?
1343568667716571137 2020-12-28 22:45:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that site is there because anyone can say anything..does not mean it is truth or they are not members of his cult. If they think he is healthy in mind and body and has a beautiful soul..guess they do not expect much from people. Poor critters
1343567954273832960 2020-12-28 22:42:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do it for those you care about and those you do not know
1343567952969400321 2020-12-28 22:42:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hospitals will  get more crowded, doctors and nurses are running out of health . They are taking care of those that go out to party.Spoiled selfish children thinking of no one but themselves ..CHANGE PLANS PUT ON MASKS, KEEP DISTANCE.üò™üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò∑
1343567951354585094 2020-12-28 22:42:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Irks me no end that so many will be alone  NYE and so many others will be out partying maskless.. We will be without family and friends doing this to benefit all. Others do not seem to get that the virus will not go away without humans putting on a mask or washing hands.
1343563962445656064 2020-12-28 22:26:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÄ that is evident.
1343385479664824322 2020-12-28 10:37:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that must mean Dr Fauci is the success story ..and we can add little marco to smaller donald for who does not matter
1343385283014897665 2020-12-28 10:36:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Duran Duran?
1343384382376177664 2020-12-28 10:32:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And the point of this nonsense?
1343370002540482562 2020-12-28 09:35:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> truly amazes me how they can be pro-life
1343369889986314241 2020-12-28 09:35:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do not want to see or hear any trump..so i just put this note here without turning on sound
1343369581801435138 2020-12-28 09:34:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the nontrump followers..the smart people know to ignore trumps blathering and the rest do not count. they love the cult..but that is their brainwashed choice
1343368796355125248 2020-12-28 09:30:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He should just resign .asap
1343368583443845123 2020-12-28 09:30:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good luck, you will do just fine.
1343368461251194880 2020-12-28 09:29:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> odd saw nothing about stimulus
1343368214168952832 2020-12-28 09:28:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He likes drama, confusion,  and attention. Now he got all 3 again
1343367996182568963 2020-12-28 09:27:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump is the most anti-american president I have ever heard of or seen and as patriotic as a flea
1343367486301941761 2020-12-28 09:25:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds truly intelligent
1343366846024736768 2020-12-28 09:23:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have a tough road to go @JoeBiden  and it is not your fault. We have faith in you.
1343362995997601793 2020-12-28 09:07:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Vp not losing his benefits, does not care he has those fawnlike eyes for trump so he  follows his leader off cliff
1343362355535687680 2020-12-28 09:05:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wants to take attention from @JoeBiden  and whatever it takes is what he will do
1343362138375647233 2020-12-28 09:04:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòäüò™üò∑Glad you had them as long as you did though it is never long enough. I am sorryüôèüôè
1343357356411924481 2020-12-28 08:45:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is just playing his reality show...as expected ,because he gets attention
1343356980254146561 2020-12-28 08:43:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> for trump is about trump..haven't you noticed that..not about America just trump
1343356698254311424 2020-12-28 08:42:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we know..not a believer in democracy, honesty or fairness
1343346285479415809 2020-12-28 08:01:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and it must be others idea too. They do hang on to everything
1343343698722041865 2020-12-28 07:51:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is playing with your heads and you allow it. same way he got into office
1343343417443627009 2020-12-28 07:50:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If water I think it is empty because none in the container below..might be food and that would just be all wrong since he needs water
1343343125281046531 2020-12-28 07:48:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As you can see he has your attention..as he wants..why even pay attention good or bad or no news it will appear as he plans it why give it more time and space
1343342795847831552 2020-12-28 07:47:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They say waiting for more details
1343342612699348998 2020-12-28 07:46:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Personally at this point I don't care what he does and I think we should stop talking about him or anything he offers..just a reality show
1343336648105463811 2020-12-28 07:23:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right now yet again CNN has trump as star of his own show. He is in heaven when that happens. If it did not happen it would be much better since the reporter is asked "do you think?" What is thought is not the point .Trump needs to be stopped. Giving him attn is not what he needs
1343328417274621952 2020-12-28 06:50:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot say how much this picture makes my day.
1343326774906728453 2020-12-28 06:43:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just think January 20th

1343323833789513728 2020-12-28 06:32:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh if that is not beautiful  no idea what is
1343312907468230657 2020-12-28 05:48:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do I not see water for him?
1343305697900060675 2020-12-28 05:20:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> MEDIA, INDIVIDUALS , LEFT, RIGHT , MIDDLE..just ignore him and his lies and craving for attention
1343305364054433795 2020-12-28 05:18:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Try ignoring trump he will do whatever he does..but he has really gotten enough attention. He thrives on this attention so just STOP
1343289433567670275 2020-12-28 04:15:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> money never buys real friends
1343288450448056321 2020-12-28 04:11:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't ask might give him ideas
1343287949115469827 2020-12-28 04:09:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lolüòÄ
1343271632056541188 2020-12-28 03:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Best idea for amendment EVER, as long as it adds trump from no generation can ever run for public office
1343271158918090753 2020-12-28 03:02:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure cant count on trump..tho he does like the dramatic
1343262180955873281 2020-12-28 02:27:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope was a fine happy healthy birthday with many more coming
1343262025238114312 2020-12-28 02:26:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and ,he loves to be the star, complete with drama
1343261616608071681 2020-12-28 02:25:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anything for attention-guess one more spreader event to detract from the new President of the United States Joe Biden
1343260861083824129 2020-12-28 02:22:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ¬∑ jnsanity under any name is insanity denial by any other name is denial if you give money to this fake cause you are a fool
1343255573731495936 2020-12-28 02:00:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @marcorubio No Rubio he did not know then what he knows now. and people like you are promoting havoc, death and destruction. This is not about Dr Fauci. It is politicians who  like you want to make a bigger name for themselves at the peoples expense
1343255079378366465 2020-12-28 01:59:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dog cant read the card
1343254893067464704 2020-12-28 01:58:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He always wants to ride in on his white horse to save the people..like he said "do not believe anyone else just believe me.  " now if had no other time, he has gone way to far
1343248301689335809 2020-12-28 01:32:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you think this is normal behavior? if so you should join trump for the evaluation
1343245690969927680 2020-12-28 01:21:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most importantly, if you have children and say no ..enforce it. teach them no is no and never be too busy to say no
1343245437948616704 2020-12-28 01:20:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They do not understand that their mouth and nose should be covered..or no sense to a mask
1343245203591868416 2020-12-28 01:19:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She does not want to believe those people are in the same party that her father was in (can't say as I blame her)
1343244897428660227 2020-12-28 01:18:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't let it get you. They are the ones wearing tinfoil hats
1343227268953501696 2020-12-28 00:08:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PamKeithFL  Congratulations..nice to see there are really Americans left in Fl

1343218840747077637 2020-12-27 23:35:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you hear him complain or do anything to change anything?
1343218266723000321 2020-12-27 23:32:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> America says we are hungry, we are sick, we are tired, and we need help. Sadly you are the one can give it and you are too busy being a spoiled child to consider it.
1343217559982764034 2020-12-27 23:29:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If maskers do not do business with the same stores that those selfish ignorant fools shop at, my guess is any store will change policy.

1342981607993585668 2020-12-27 07:52:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> besides, if he leaves as he must, he is fair game to the federal government for his crimes

1342946255484366849 2020-12-27 05:31:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> apparently true
1342946047778320390 2020-12-27 05:31:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and it is what trump has done

1342928431705677827 2020-12-27 04:21:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does it occur to trump he is the one taking advantage of our country and our people?

1342917511633895426 2020-12-27 03:37:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does the covid19 virus stop at the border to ask if dem or repub?
1342900773307502593 2020-12-27 02:31:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I asked about masks and life, not money
1342892644687634433 2020-12-27 01:58:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he never heard of them how does he have a number for them?
1342890138955902976 2020-12-27 01:48:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  Have you put in one straight month with no golf?

1342685728447279104 2020-12-26 12:16:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We proved that the USA and democratic republic still stand no matter how hard trump or his fans try to destroy it . We will be the USA and bigger and better than ever

SELFISH
1342677413604569094 2020-12-26 11:43:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The top of the box is tied to the bottom of the box...ah well Merry Christmas
1342643273802919937 2020-12-26 09:27:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is president that is why , just missing the swearing in.
1342643164017020930 2020-12-26 09:27:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course he would play with Lindsey, pretty much everyone else is done with him
1342642900086226951 2020-12-26 09:26:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just as we expect from a President., a good heart and a statement
1342642639921967104 2020-12-26 09:25:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at his closed door lying speech he will say he will give them their raise..hope they do not hold their breath waiting
1342642318411763713 2020-12-26 09:24:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am guessing he will wait til the very last moment then do something dramatic.
1342642138178269186 2020-12-26 09:23:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> his fawning children?
1342642021744467968 2020-12-26 09:22:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is trumps fault not china..trump spent the money like it was his own
1342633034680590336 2020-12-26 08:47:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't help but wonder if daughter knows daddy is wrong? Should not even be thinking of her in those terms,much less talking about her.

1342608555069890561 2020-12-26 07:09:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am in the remains of the USA waiting for the rebuild..but have always had tremendous respect for your Queen and what she represents. Long Live the Queen
1342608135798857729 2020-12-26 07:08:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the queen is a Queen. trump is a Shmuck
1342607921968984064 2020-12-26 07:07:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could be he knows someone or could be he has checked out of his job
1342607533836562438 2020-12-26 07:05:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they have any idea what their faces project even on their best days
1342607219922264064 2020-12-26 07:04:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gosh i missed him saying that..he always has to blame someone and his supporters still buy his trash talk
1342594606014337025 2020-12-26 06:14:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at various times all of the below..what about you ?
1342577112977469441 2020-12-26 05:05:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he needs a beard and pointed ears
1342574868571762690 2020-12-26 04:56:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you  shocked? he skis trum golfs who runs the country? The same who run it when they are both there
1342574549213315072 2020-12-26 04:54:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too..just listen to the news and we know it is the right thing to do
1342574383878053888 2020-12-26 04:54:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> my uncle kind of had that style back in the 50s
1342542517741481987 2020-12-26 02:47:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad I am not the only one why laughs and shakes my head
1342542352523665408 2020-12-26 02:46:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to see him testify under oath for a lot of things
1342520637374554117 2020-12-26 01:20:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt that hat is to stay healthy  (good excuse). Fact is the more they are discussed like trump the happier they are
1342520251519541248 2020-12-26 01:19:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I still do not know what it means but they are already disgusting and I can't believe it is real but it is.
1342519744289714178 2020-12-26 01:17:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in his head he again has left his job..
1342505798539345921 2020-12-26 00:21:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Far as I know bell's palsy is not permanent
1342503901036212224 2020-12-26 00:14:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well, now I think I know why you developed your humor. It was to contend with life and box spring covers.
1342489515949252608 2020-12-25 23:16:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right..he does not care about you, me or anyone else unless they benefit him..then, it is not care it is selfishness and greed
1342489239322308609 2020-12-25 23:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he thinks the majority live as he does and the rest are not worthy of saving
1342488663427526656 2020-12-25 23:13:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course as usual the presidents message does not come close to matching his actions
1342307281954869255 2020-12-25 11:12:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Put butter on it? Looks delicious
1342306788381700098 2020-12-25 11:10:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching It is a Wonderful Life what are you doing?
1342284354412826626 2020-12-25 09:41:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has been so convinced the election is rigged..would I be surprised? NO every time he accuses anyone or anything of being rigged..he is doing whatever he accuses anyone of doing
1342284092705021953 2020-12-25 09:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe wait until trump is gone
1342283975021260800 2020-12-25 09:40:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does Santa have big claws?
1342283851834544131 2020-12-25 09:39:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe saying will break the bank..maybe 1000?
1342283381564993537 2020-12-25 09:37:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> watching It is a  wonderful life..wondering if you are ..and will you munch on the loaf just for eating?
1342283086210486273 2020-12-25 09:36:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks so good , don't know if I could wait that longüòä Watch out for that wind up there, nasty.  But I want to know how it tastes (the loaf not the wind) Happy waiting, Merry Christmas to the bunch of you.
1342281350850650113 2020-12-25 09:29:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have seen the telegraph never saw what it said except about his son...and I watch it almost every year.Thanks.
1342280965834612737 2020-12-25 09:28:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks delicious..taste the same way?
1342267756113235968 2020-12-25 08:35:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or in the hospital...or spreading it to families and friends
1342263401771376641 2020-12-25 08:18:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have a very Merry Christmas  yourselves
1342263105271844869 2020-12-25 08:17:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can['t he be quietly removed from twitter
1342262856444760064 2020-12-25 08:16:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984 sleep well tonight..excellent. Thanks for your gift to the populace. Merry Christmas
1342262312577732608 2020-12-25 08:14:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bear is in rare form tonight..Merry Christmas anyway
1342250395167551491 2020-12-25 07:26:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> see how into it the are lol
1342250167064530945 2020-12-25 07:25:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He did not say the Jewish person was religious..and since she is not being dragged in against her will, must be good and hope the widow enjoys her meal.
1342245618853490688 2020-12-25 07:07:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hard to pick up the golf club as he tries not to fall over
1342245320885940225 2020-12-25 07:06:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not believe that those at the top cannot imagine what happens to the rest of the population but I am guessing they dont and have no idea how thankful they should be
1342244914810277891 2020-12-25 07:05:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh it is a ball? can't make dinner without throwing the ball.
1342244670278086662 2020-12-25 07:04:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gees so sorry , would love to see people learn from these examples and stay home and masked
1342244204815257601 2020-12-25 07:02:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And then police wonder why people are so leery about the police. I support police. I do not support this behavior.
1342243745195040770 2020-12-25 07:00:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could use the money but think you are right.
1342243052824494082 2020-12-25 06:57:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> odd as it is, pence does have limits and i think overthrowing a government is not something he will do
1342242599214714881 2020-12-25 06:55:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and I do not believe even from the first day that trump  understood when he did what he wanted, he was stomping all over the Constitution
1342242256900804608 2020-12-25 06:54:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yikes ..what  a christmas gift. Hope all is well
1342242072913453059 2020-12-25 06:53:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She does not comprehend this anymore than trump does
1342241912384794630 2020-12-25 06:53:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not doing any...no family no nothing..and about now I am getting angry with people who think Covid19 does not exist or it cant happen to them. People need to stay home and stop perpetuating this virus and the myths
1342241058898522114 2020-12-25 06:49:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very spot on cartoon
1342240924085190658 2020-12-25 06:49:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like his daddy it is all about him
1342231397025640449 2020-12-25 06:11:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but smile    https://t.co/kQ9a9wxMiE
1342230822661840897 2020-12-25 06:09:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly I can almost believe this is true story even if the claim that christmas was stolen just one more trump lie
1342229468157513729 2020-12-25 06:03:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/kQ9a9wxMiE
1342227326331924482 2020-12-25 05:55:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does he intentionally sound crazy and high or is that all trump followers sound the same
1342227079132307461 2020-12-25 05:54:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the New Years Eve ball should drop mid January. Do not want to start off NYE with trump in office
1342226437500231685 2020-12-25 05:51:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and yet..be nice to trump and see what you get..no matter how vicious the crime
1342225474181857285 2020-12-25 05:47:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not a trump sign to be seen and all the flags that were flying for all the wrong reasons are now down
1342225224583020545 2020-12-25 05:46:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is a hell of a team and I am not saying that as a compliment
1342224965773512705 2020-12-25 05:45:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr. Fauci you are an amazing man. Happy Birthday
1342197704072507392 2020-12-25 03:57:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is he trying to get your attention to a tomato on the floor? Is it that he does not like it or trying to help you. Or not a tomato?
1342196912141824002 2020-12-25 03:54:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With what Joe Biden has going on, I am amazed he is doing as well as he is. Not likely he has one intentional lie
1342195965453881346 2020-12-25 03:50:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pathetic that helping people  in need is a political issue
1342194997236477952 2020-12-25 03:46:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Christmas is not about you Jr
1342190396340916224 2020-12-25 03:28:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> crackling fireplace always beautiful sound
1342189614191292418 2020-12-25 03:25:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> check out who many of those on welfare are
1342189411639971841 2020-12-25 03:24:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would love to but wont..are you?
1342189275731939333 2020-12-25 03:23:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is jr high?
1342189013944442880 2020-12-25 03:22:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course they object to it..they cannot imagine everyone not having money to spare
1342175554104131585 2020-12-25 02:29:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more damage he does..about now, his height is about equal to Tom Thumb and shrinking
1342175086556696577 2020-12-25 02:27:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so perfect Governor Cuomo
1342174834017579015 2020-12-25 02:26:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> think determined by intent
1342174494165708800 2020-12-25 02:25:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whatever else happens..Happy Birthday Dr Fauci..
1342173608161005568 2020-12-25 02:21:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lovely contribution..they probably did not want u to feel left out..they did a great job
1342173420776267777 2020-12-25 02:20:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I will bet along with you..probably partying too..and if going to church no masks
1342163997290876928 2020-12-25 01:43:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I also do not think this is his new idea..just thinks right time idea
1342163754465828864 2020-12-25 01:42:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he is and has been trying to sabotage everything because he wants to be dictator in chief
1342132564149075969 2020-12-24 23:38:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> took more than mccarthy
1342130843893047297 2020-12-24 23:31:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it would be great if you could tell me why trump should be elected? because he said so?
1342125082974498817 2020-12-24 23:08:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are so ignorant..worst thing is they cant all be republicans
1342124920365584387 2020-12-24 23:08:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can hope..only takes time away from the future..since cleaning up trumps past. Can only say poor @JoeBiden and @SenKamalaHarris ..people do need patience and if they want to blame, it should be @realDonaldTrump the child is pathetic.
1342123768244744193 2020-12-24 23:03:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good news if he is leaving..will he be taking others with him?
1342123083751190528 2020-12-24 23:00:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not like all this debt but I would guess all trumps hare brained ideas have cost us a lot more than the stimulus would ..and we need to eat or pay bills etc
1342122830008365059 2020-12-24 22:59:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Republicans seem to forget who votes for them..or does not. trump will be gone where will those republicans be?
1342110838799400961 2020-12-24 22:12:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> your encouragement of trumps bad behaviors are not going to play well
1342110478122840065 2020-12-24 22:10:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You and others like you are the swamp
1342108834454786050 2020-12-24 22:04:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With that hashtag only problem is gives him the perfect excuse to hold up or not sign any sort of check for us people that need it..to punish some more
1341956577276915712 2020-12-24 11:59:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the president is most at ease in the swamp since he is one of the creatures in there.
1341956363526795264 2020-12-24 11:58:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Birthday Dr Fauci and Tomorrow in DC is also Dr Anthony Fauci Day..Hope you enjoy both (if you see this)
1341956002200121345 2020-12-24 11:56:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you always sound so ignorant?
1341937791832383490 2020-12-24 10:44:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o thanks ..for now,I will take your word for it.  üòÑ
1341937543818981376 2020-12-24 10:43:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> over time, trump has turned on everyone..people have been more patient with trump than i could ever understand
1341936862672392192 2020-12-24 10:40:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I mention you should not snark at me..or I snark back.. you do make me laugh
1341936131219353602 2020-12-24 10:38:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when Santorum is on, I do not watch..
1341935726255087617 2020-12-24 10:36:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one can pick on him for his history and son can be proud..as if this erased all crime
1341935496499519488 2020-12-24 10:35:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shucks you are just so clever.
1341933045193056261 2020-12-24 10:25:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You would be right..if you were not discussing the "alleged" trump crime family
1341932610164027393 2020-12-24 10:24:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you really do not like Biden but you need to speak truth even if you do not like him
1341932383101136897 2020-12-24 10:23:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he has probably not checked the details and really should
1341929596372054016 2020-12-24 10:12:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was thinking how qualified they all sound for the positions they will hold-unlike trumps cabinet
1341929361461665794 2020-12-24 10:11:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just think how you will feel by the time trump leaves
1341920849817972739 2020-12-24 09:37:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is antiamerican-pro trump and pro russia..and all those shmucks named him president...h ope everyone is happy now that he has destroyed the country and will run away..and Biden has so much  work to do.thanks to the chief shit but we will rise again biggerand better thanever
1341920056213729287 2020-12-24 09:34:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that has been obvious for years
1341919758460055552 2020-12-24 09:32:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she probably loaded one or two..she is her fathers daughter
1341919329646997504 2020-12-24 09:31:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> dirtbags galore and birds of a feather flock together..i see law and order .. trump scammed everyone and no one says boo
1341919044233023489 2020-12-24 09:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No guts to say no..he even wrote him a lovely letter
1341918941279637506 2020-12-24 09:29:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> remember he will say and do anything ..and he does and still his sycophants still stick around
1341918652023635968 2020-12-24 09:28:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL
1341890786246451203 2020-12-24 07:37:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and if he comes down with covid he wont believe it, if his family or friends get it he still wont believe it and if G-d forbid one dies they still wont believe it. The insanity continues
1341890464165855232 2020-12-24 07:36:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nothing done by any of them is surprising
1341890280233062400 2020-12-24 07:35:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> "OMG!  I can't wait!  I'm so excited!"
1341890074229829633 2020-12-24 07:34:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be great, but do not hold your breath
1341886512472985600 2020-12-24 07:20:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1341885641227956225 2020-12-24 07:17:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicely said
1341885471069188097 2020-12-24 07:16:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was informed by the post office that cards I bought for my kids birthday would arrive by the 21st of dec..they were ordered on the 16th mailed from within 20 miles of here,.as of the 22nd i was informed the mail would arrive by the  24th..today the 30th -bday was 22nd..

1341879925683449863 2020-12-24 06:54:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is about him calling them not about you
1341873110786715648 2020-12-24 06:27:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lie with dogs get fleas?

1341861481051250691 2020-12-24 05:41:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be nice. Is it a piece of paper attached at the top as  approved addendum to the rest of the bill so no question
1341861203841343489 2020-12-24 05:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stay home!!

1341860943899312128 2020-12-24 05:39:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> perhaps he is waiting until the day he is president
1341860857798664200 2020-12-24 05:38:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess gingrich is as much a crackpot as trump..maybe why i never liked him
1341860689112166401 2020-12-24 05:38:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like Colin Powell and I would totally agree with him
1341860512443883520 2020-12-24 05:37:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad he stood up at end..been nice if he did his job all along..one word..traitor?
1341844458082463744 2020-12-24 04:33:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't think I mentioned..nice color choice and well said
1341839541313941506 2020-12-24 04:14:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely he means it though Tomi
1341838683763335168 2020-12-24 04:10:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stop whining and stop smoking
1341838488422019077 2020-12-24 04:10:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting..cold blooded murder is still murder. They were civilians ..
1341838043217539073 2020-12-24 04:08:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you don't support  a thing you are as much a fake as donald
1341837711557193728 2020-12-24 04:06:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> except yours
1341837592757751809 2020-12-24 04:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> whatever his plan is..ignore it..more write about it more confusion happier he is... discussing it wont change a thing

1341807120069636101 2020-12-24 02:05:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think spending money on cyber protection makes a whole lot more sense
1341806607144022017 2020-12-24 02:03:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His followers will surpass whatever trump had that he felt he had to steal
1341806400838774784 2020-12-24 02:02:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò™
1341805718232588288 2020-12-24 01:59:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not care give up thinking he does
1341805590163705862 2020-12-24 01:59:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> master of evil in their own ways
1341804138116624391 2020-12-24 01:53:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just wonder if this was always Graham and John McCain never realized it or if McCain died and graham flipped out
1341764012145565697 2020-12-23 23:14:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is a joke?
1341763638093344781 2020-12-23 23:12:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm could it be that they welcomed a dictatorship?
1341760614981578752 2020-12-23 23:00:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pretty disgraceful humans at Newsmax and Fox and proud boys etc ..couldn't have any of this without the people who participate..tho I do wonder if any of them even voted?
1341750304652595201 2020-12-23 22:19:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ouch. But welcome back, glad that was the worst of things. You could have been dead and we would not know what happened.  Speedy recovery to you. Hope the pain is short lived and the recovery is complete
1341749923302305795 2020-12-23 22:18:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If there was a way to change the check numbers when it got back to him he would find something else. He likes the attention but wants the numbers removed that are needed for other projects
1341749437828370432 2020-12-23 22:16:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps just disgusted with what he sees and hears
1341747678120652801 2020-12-23 22:09:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you really believe he is sincere. Not likely, that would require thought for others. He is his concern.
1341747090100277250 2020-12-23 22:06:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So, pence thinks rich people should not do anything but collect money and the rest of us should donate to them?
1341581447690407939 2020-12-23 11:08:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump won't mind pardoning him if necessary. he will ignore election fraud
1341580916217569286 2020-12-23 11:06:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure..if trump was serious he would be sure it was approved
1341574335975337985 2020-12-23 10:40:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If    anyone had a doubt what a dirtbag trump is these pardons should erase them
1341571728250728450 2020-12-23 10:29:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how much these pardons are worth to donald
1341551377944891393 2020-12-23 09:09:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this one now he can hold it over their heads how they owe him when he calls it in whatever it is
1341551198105702403 2020-12-23 09:08:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A play is a play not reality?
1341550979490193412 2020-12-23 09:07:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no source no nothing just foolishness
1341550832031031296 2020-12-23 09:06:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not really seeing this or it is idiots delight
1341535723007184897 2020-12-23 08:06:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watch how pence stares at trump..he adores him? Now does he love country more or trump?
1341535452818526208 2020-12-23 08:05:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is there a ban on flying from UK to US now?
1341534651115036675 2020-12-23 08:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or, English is not the first language
1341534214169214978 2020-12-23 08:00:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> meant to say ran out of money duh
1341534106627260416 2020-12-23 08:00:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is obscene. Shows again how trump loves this country and its people. He does not care who he puts at risk . trump is the fraud and biggest fake
1341533833037033472 2020-12-23 07:59:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ask if he repays the money or only repays those he currently uses
1341500337933443073 2020-12-23 05:46:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> going to wear a mask and recommend others do too?
1341500199542243328 2020-12-23 05:45:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess she isnt finished being sweet talked
1341500070194241542 2020-12-23 05:45:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @VP I was raised and raised my children to believe those with more need to share with those with less and be thankful you can
1341499629662298115 2020-12-23 05:43:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A Republican American..awesome
1341496773047709696 2020-12-23 05:32:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stick heads out door, look carefully around, be sure he is gone  then huge virtual toast around the world
1341495795850342402 2020-12-23 05:28:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oops

1341487110994464776 2020-12-23 04:53:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have a 10 year old to be so very proud of. Hope he never changes.  You did good mom
1341486860770684932 2020-12-23 04:52:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Excellent!!!
1341486016465649665 2020-12-23 04:49:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o no way!!!!
1341485923679285248 2020-12-23 04:49:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicest part is, he has been saying that and he means it
1341485808130420739 2020-12-23 04:48:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not have to wonder what he would do or say  next. I could count on him being Presidential and peaceful to listen too..ahhhh
1341485398111993857 2020-12-23 04:46:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well I tuned in ..and sure glad I did. Can't you be president now? You sounded like one
1341485218390286337 2020-12-23 04:46:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know trump and his followers are worthless..why do something kind when he can be what he is?
1341484640570384385 2020-12-23 04:43:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> criticisms too
1341484510844760065 2020-12-23 04:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor pence, always the trump sycophant and never the citizen of this county or patriot
1341484108527120394 2020-12-23 04:41:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good translation, probably perfect
1341483808307212289 2020-12-23 04:40:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Point was probably overlistened to trump and his criticizms
1341483541964722180 2020-12-23 04:39:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably just needed to get used to public speaking.
1341419530103513095 2020-12-23 00:25:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they will miss the drama and tv show within the show..but bless normal bad as things are normal is coming
1341416845950283777 2020-12-23 00:14:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôè
1341409893375504384 2020-12-22 23:46:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better than a good cup of coffee
1341409466907041793 2020-12-22 23:45:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should have been at the top of the list.
1341399700637945858 2020-12-22 23:06:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope so too but I am afraid we will learn we can't count on them being responsible when they have had trump as their teacher and we know he is not at all responsible
1341399469091401735 2020-12-22 23:05:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Problem is, her granddaughter is indicative of everyone who thinks rules are for everyone but themselves and that is why covid19 is so widespread ..I am sorry for grandma but can't be sorry for her granddaughter.
1341388156151738368 2020-12-22 22:20:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is it I see republicans use dead people voting, republicans move drop boxes, republicans try to stop the votes...you dont want a debate over fraud you want a dictatorship
1341387492948324353 2020-12-22 22:17:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if we really will be able to take a deep breath or trump fanatics will keep causing trouble .."for fun"
1341372033687535616 2020-12-22 21:16:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Amazing that Pat says this now, where was he for the last 4 yrs?
1341371093542703104 2020-12-22 21:12:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think there should be an airport with his name.....in RUSSIA
1341370419006332936 2020-12-22 21:10:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you find anything unusual in the irregularities of the "president"
1341370032178278402 2020-12-22 21:08:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to ask the "good" pastor what trump has done to earn the histrionics
1341368927176286208 2020-12-22 21:04:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> insanity. Did anyone say it is over?
1341368197426102273 2020-12-22 21:01:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> radicalized and cult member=insanity
1341228312635596801 2020-12-22 11:45:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Let's walk to the space ship. It is waiting for us.
1341227920463937539 2020-12-22 11:43:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does this make them patriots or gullible fools?
1341227659838275584 2020-12-22 11:42:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> truth is not trumps strong suit..and I am shocked and relieved that people are starting to speak up to him  Geraldo. Wish it was done years ago.
1341226919333933056 2020-12-22 11:39:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> blither blather
1341226442043121670 2020-12-22 11:37:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> always the way..trump and his cronies accuse others of crimes they are guilty of
1341225827166511105 2020-12-22 11:35:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And we wonder why trump and his supporters accuse ..always said when trump or his henchmen accuse others ..look at them
1341225046698831873 2020-12-22 11:32:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If people in his party or the media did not spend so much time humoring trump we would not be in this mess
1341224573426085888 2020-12-22 11:30:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you yet one more time for your honesty Dr Fauci.
1341224318051737600 2020-12-22 11:29:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am glad you stand up and vote the law not the politics ..or even the man who wants to be dictator. Your daughter should be exceptionally proud of you. Hope you will all stay safe
1341223495766781954 2020-12-22 11:26:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To bad Robertson did not say don't run to trump before he ran in 2016
1341217768474107905 2020-12-22 11:03:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so confused. If prosecutors are talking about Guiliani or trump or anyone..why are the putting all the cards on the table. These people would not mind destroying everything needed for a case. Why is this discussed as if it is no big deal?
1341207893371199489 2020-12-22 10:24:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are not a loser. I am glad you got some items..they wont care..just sanitize..but you know that
1341207487542902784 2020-12-22 10:22:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Having seen some of what you espouse..try the truth as miracle
1341207289106231296 2020-12-22 10:21:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Long nap?
1341206904870236167 2020-12-22 10:20:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o goodness.  As a believer, you are under the auspices of all that is good. Don't forget a mask.
1341206362236305408 2020-12-22 10:18:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like it is well earned by flynn and some great news
1341206150365245442 2020-12-22 10:17:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she looked nervous..but she sure has a story to tell.
1341205904587415552 2020-12-22 10:16:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> isn't any answer the wrong answer?
1341182023554244610 2020-12-22 08:41:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ReverendWarnock  can you say you do not lie @KLoeffler? You do not have to say the words to be divisive or seem racially charged
1341181545839796224 2020-12-22 08:39:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't keep reminding him
1341181358127853568 2020-12-22 08:38:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be nice if far right wackos stopped behaving like wackos when trump is gone but not counting on it or counting on..as long as trump is free he wont be doing this same nonsense
1341181058071576576 2020-12-22 08:37:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe an airport in Russia?
1341168338530086913 2020-12-22 07:47:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not sure he does, think he is just trying to disconnect from her or project that he is
1341168161417289728 2020-12-22 07:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then since everyone is not vaccinated they will go to those frontline doctors and nurses to save their unworthy rear ends
1341167906571358210 2020-12-22 07:45:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> reminds me of the christian right..who just do not care
1341167756889231360 2020-12-22 07:44:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh it is not?
1341167478966239233 2020-12-22 07:43:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mitch will always be a lowlife..is there a way to check the votes?
1341167255862820867 2020-12-22 07:42:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and so now disclaimer and whatever she says or does..publicly trump and rudy are in clear..unless someone turns up some evidence
1341166826630369280 2020-12-22 07:41:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and they get to rename a park or something after jared..so much excitement ..wonder if they polled people who live there see how many wanted that as capital
1341163120513978368 2020-12-22 07:26:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IvankaTrump  you as fake as daddy nice to stand up for your dad..if you can look at him saying he is a role model..but seems to me he does not want to leave office so he does not go to jail, nothing to do with his followers..if he did that at least he would have them wear masks
1341112540206673922 2020-12-22 04:05:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is this a joke?
1341112053667381248 2020-12-22 04:03:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they will retract or tell the truth about all of it
1341111783797493760 2020-12-22 04:02:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will have vaccines and front line people will do without
1341111631078715400 2020-12-22 04:01:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will rescue them
1341111198771757056 2020-12-22 04:00:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> PLEASE JUST VOTE if you are a resident of GA and are tired of this bs
1341110527003676672 2020-12-22 03:57:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> spending .50 a day? Even that breaks the bank
1341109306670915584 2020-12-22 03:52:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @sendavidperdue  where are you?
1341108900561620995 2020-12-22 03:50:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am disgusted, they are disgraceful
1341108571518464001 2020-12-22 03:49:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Merry Christmas dimwits hope you do not live to regret it. Should you get sick, remember nurses, docs and frontline workers should be going ahead of you instead of saving your unworthy rearends
1341107674679787522 2020-12-22 03:46:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yes he should resign..but he won't
1341107492693155845 2020-12-22 03:45:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and a happy healthy new year to you bear (and honeybee)
1341107252867022848 2020-12-22 03:44:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not new "Maga Male" it has been around as long as trump
1341107005726093312 2020-12-22 03:43:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well hasn't trump sent out a great image
1341106792105996288 2020-12-22 03:42:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I firmly believe there are a lot of words his supporters do not understand..that could be how we got here
1341106471862452229 2020-12-22 03:41:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh jeez nothing I would rather see..or not see
1341106294061748224 2020-12-22 03:40:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry about your dad and that you received no response. You are a worthy tweeter ...and I am glad your dad is no longer in pain but I am sorry you are
1341105925566947329 2020-12-22 03:39:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if I believe fox, 22% of Americans are brainwashed
1341084543567224838 2020-12-22 02:14:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have to show them bad idea to overthrow this government, not just the election
1341050909606985728 2020-12-22 00:00:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the richest are getting richer ..they find themselves that much more important and do not stop to think it is those getting the 600. are those who keep the richest going
1341020812749500416 2020-12-21 22:00:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IndThinkDE Maybe all members of the family except him will be found guilty and sent to jail. Might be his only chance until they brainwash him that is everyone elses' fault but theirs..so skip that idea
1341020264843390976 2020-12-21 21:58:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IndThinkDE I thought the kid had a chance..but no way and now he will have to deal with reactions of others t o what his father did though had nothing to do with him..truly sad
1341017110248611843 2020-12-21 21:46:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Let politicians set the example by letting those who are in the front lines get the vaccine as they wait their turn
1341016840273850368 2020-12-21 21:45:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Conservative, Republican, Justice and MAN who respects law and Constitution-stands up for what is right
1341008262775365633 2020-12-21 21:10:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It really is sad that this is what he thinks about his legacy. His little son is going to have to  live with this forever
1341007000415719434 2020-12-21 21:05:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still out to destroy the republican party once and for all? Anyone that loves this country, Constitution and not russia or lily white has left you
1341006499431280640 2020-12-21 21:03:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÄ
1340875529784799232 2020-12-21 12:23:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> might get them groceries for a month
1340875263467503618 2020-12-21 12:22:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fox helped trump try to destroy this country..Mayor Pete is probably exactly right for the position. He is not out to do harm. (unlike fox and trump)
1340874480718143488 2020-12-21 12:19:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not but it is not up to me. Biden will make the right choice
1340874266535997440 2020-12-21 12:18:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Had nothing to do with win before the election. You are the people so focused on you first that is where blame goes
1340873989040664577 2020-12-21 12:17:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do you wear a mask or did you waste the vaccine?
1340873695313707008 2020-12-21 12:16:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no one scoffed at the vaccine..they scoffed at donald and all the other "medicines"  he suggested..like bleach..gee wonder why he is so distrusted. Wonder how it would have been had he told the truth from the first day. Just can't understand why he is so untrusted.
1340873089320665089 2020-12-21 12:13:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and you got your vaccine..but front line worker did not..but you got yours..wonder if any ambulance workers got theirs?
1340860256491061248 2020-12-21 11:22:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is true they will do whatever they can to please you...just sometimes a little more in their time then yours but they are faithful and loving beyond words
1340859733612388352 2020-12-21 11:20:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What an expression on a whatta face!!!
1340859371560071169 2020-12-21 11:19:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> great advice
1340859160255184897 2020-12-21 11:18:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> money and if it feels good do it
1340859047952719872 2020-12-21 11:18:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and we can cry and whine all we want, but it won't change anything because trump followers have no idea what life costs. They reach into their trusts and take money out when they need it
1340858657475538946 2020-12-21 11:16:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry is no one else even comes close
1340858493792907266 2020-12-21 11:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O Jake so sorry, She is still with you in everything you do. I am glad she is no longer suffering. You will get through it.  It feels like life is over (I remember that feeling) It is not, just hang on.
1340857995392114689 2020-12-21 11:13:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting but we know that all those grifters are pieces of human excrement ..hope you have your vaccine now..stay healthy (with or without it)
1340857573893955585 2020-12-21 11:12:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not a hard time believing Biden won at all. I have a hard time believing that conspiracy theorists are so desperate that they do not look at populated areas to see how much of the population is in the area. If they checked it would probably then make sense
1340857118644195330 2020-12-21 11:10:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder what her cut would be  for this idiocy?
1340856930252812288 2020-12-21 11:09:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just have to hang on til Biden gets in..He will reverse it all and those businesses know he will so if intelligent they will not start anything now
1340855640605028352 2020-12-21 11:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how long it will be if ever that the ex cop realizes he has been had  ..and it was insane that he fell for it?
1340855064001441792 2020-12-21 11:02:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and this is news why?
1340831791742107649 2020-12-21 09:29:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice graphic
1340831294591283203 2020-12-21 09:27:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is it January 20th yet?
1340831120338935809 2020-12-21 09:27:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sorry. but, so glad you all got to see each other.
1340830906731401216 2020-12-21 09:26:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> excellent
1340830506351472640 2020-12-21 09:24:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Interesting makes one wonder why it took  so long
1340829668589658112 2020-12-21 09:21:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are the coup and you are causing the crumbling. Patriots are not involved in this.

1340828897521360899 2020-12-21 09:18:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thanks for the reminder.
1340828673457483782 2020-12-21 09:17:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And stabbed himself on the way down.
1340799505382453249 2020-12-21 07:21:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do I want to ask if all of those insulting the doc or her decisions are all trump fans?
1340798932084023296 2020-12-21 07:19:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Francesca   She wants you to be educated. You want to remain uneducated
1340798930607599619 2020-12-21 07:19:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is incredibly sad and cruel is you. Hope you do your best to stay healthy but doubt you will. Stop trying to discourage others from doing it her way.  The Doc did not urge anyone to follow her, but you are encouraging others to follow you.
1340797950809747456 2020-12-21 07:15:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your comment is downright cruel. If you read her comments you know she did not take this decision lightly. The other side is those who will blame everything on vaccines
1340797949438210048 2020-12-21 07:15:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am surprised that you would be so cold and callous as to make this comment. There are two sides..1 is covid is dangerous and can be deadly.  This woman is in the medical field in contact with covid 19.
1340797125282721795 2020-12-21 07:12:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Certainly gives needed info..and reminds you of the value of education. Best wishes to you Dr. K
1340796080917794816 2020-12-21 07:07:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stay healthy!! Both of you.
1340791101297479681 2020-12-21 06:48:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like it has all over the country
1340790296339238912 2020-12-21 06:44:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Include ambulance crews
1340790146082476032 2020-12-21 06:44:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do you think he is coming up with all these far off thoughts and plans
1340767208084033537 2020-12-21 05:13:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not know what that means since antifa is not an organization?. Can you explain it?
1340766739097919489 2020-12-21 05:11:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't blame the guy, he tried.  Guess he needs to learn about the environment.
1340739720200990722 2020-12-21 03:23:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is there a new definition of the word 'best"?
1340739365400694787 2020-12-21 03:22:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and Dr Fauci who is trying to do what is right, not just convenient was talking to a youngster on the internet reassuring them that Santa and the reindeer would be able to go on their way..
1340738836448628738 2020-12-21 03:20:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tucker carlson you are a blithering idiot. Yes stand up for what is right. 3 allergic reactions in the entire country and all in one state..and you run like a coward though this could close down covid. You should be ashamed
1340737987332763649 2020-12-21 03:17:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> history like trumps
1340737671405178881 2020-12-21 03:15:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where were you before ?
1340732629268783108 2020-12-21 02:55:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now we all know why Obama advised against trump hiring flynn
1340732508992909313 2020-12-21 02:55:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is doing what is right
1340732421516439559 2020-12-21 02:54:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> truth is the enemy of the new republicans
1340732238615486464 2020-12-21 02:54:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry about your son Yes you get through and you always will. Thank you same to you

1340679712457285632 2020-12-20 23:25:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> .Best thing we can do is not even mention him or acknowledge him. We know he has not cared about anything except himself.  He believes even bad press is better than no press
1340678327774932992 2020-12-20 23:19:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ask why he is so great then suggest she look around the country and repeat what she sees?
1340677813205086209 2020-12-20 23:17:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have wondered the same thing for years..the only thing I can think is to do what trump did ..in reverse..inundate the air waves with all the lies calling them lies, hold rallies etc..everything trump did that got them, maybe the USA should do to undo them . Brainwash in reverse?
1340489504088535047 2020-12-20 10:49:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope everything works out for both of you.
1340489297879855106 2020-12-20 10:48:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still cant believe he has so many supporters..Can they really all be bigots and afraid?
1340485876254728194 2020-12-20 10:35:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not buy a thing from that guy or even give free advertising..but THAT was funny
1340484743788433408 2020-12-20 10:30:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he will walk away and tell everyone it is their fault
1340484520286560257 2020-12-20 10:29:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He did not care..anything he did or has done would be to benefit himself. If benefit anyone else ok good but not why he does anything
1340484195408355333 2020-12-20 10:28:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he had not pretended and had told the truth, and would have said wear a mask, the numbers would have done a lot better
1340483307780395008 2020-12-20 10:25:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he would disengage and walk away
1340482966645067776 2020-12-20 10:23:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> knew that almost from first lie
1340467441584005127 2020-12-20 09:21:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> even when he has a stoneface it is smug.
1340467327167553543 2020-12-20 09:21:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would still enjoy seeing Lt Col Vindman and his brother remove him
1340467186180222976 2020-12-20 09:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably fund it for years
1340464215174332417 2020-12-20 09:09:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoAnneRBoyer1 @osullivanauthor Me too, if I make a mistake..very rare you understand. üòÑ
1340463655327059969 2020-12-20 09:06:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The trumps write their own laws
1340450227149565953 2020-12-20 08:13:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cant be with others unless vaccinated
1340450125026627585 2020-12-20 08:13:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is sad about that..that is Santas job and child was afraid Santa could not come
1340443718378287104 2020-12-20 07:47:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have no problem with people having millions or billions. My problem is how they got there
1340443519329185796 2020-12-20 07:46:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> a traitor with eyes like the devil
1340436384495132675 2020-12-20 07:18:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You noticed that too uh?
1340427497624711168 2020-12-20 06:43:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What about Russia. I think someone has misled @jiminhofe about Russia
1340427131193581568 2020-12-20 06:41:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now they are alarmed? Where the hell have they been?
1340418348899819521 2020-12-20 06:06:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have you looked at the shade of brown on trumps nose? That is your answer
1340417956023595011 2020-12-20 06:05:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because he does not care
1340417838658498560 2020-12-20 06:04:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I feel like I have moved to another country..but January 20th I will move  back to the country I want to live in
1340411651556843521 2020-12-20 05:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh lordy getting worse
1340411009572462593 2020-12-20 05:37:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @rabrowne75 @SecArmy @ArmyChiefStaff Pathetic there had to be clarity..but thankful there was
1340410711407661056 2020-12-20 05:36:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   Have you noticed what Twitter attached to your ravings?
1340410313242529796 2020-12-20 05:34:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> always has
1340410195315470337 2020-12-20 05:34:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Must be in the bloodline and they all fit so well together
1340409977681420290 2020-12-20 05:33:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we need to stop using those words or he will use them when charged
1340409789654904832 2020-12-20 05:32:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The military is allowed to ignore orders if illegal
1340409067018268679 2020-12-20 05:29:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Again tears in my eyes
1340408787870638082 2020-12-20 05:28:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Rep Schiff became my hero when he spoke up and said outloud what millions already knew
1340408406381871105 2020-12-20 05:27:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When he said it, was already obvious..people did not pay attention..sure hope they are realizing it is time to pay attention
1340408175535775746 2020-12-20 05:26:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Love their little tag
1340408010871611398 2020-12-20 05:25:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> massive registration?
1340407299064688642 2020-12-20 05:22:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has a brown nose?
1340407187538063366 2020-12-20 05:22:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the UK has seen enough that trumps words are useless
1340406616756281346 2020-12-20 05:20:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why were the proud boys told to stand down  until they weren't a week or so later
1340406370122821633 2020-12-20 05:19:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> buying a new car..right out of the showroom-sale on new cars this week  600. is total price
1340405571095306240 2020-12-20 05:16:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and I thought these things only happened on the streets of NY
1340405105561133057 2020-12-20 05:14:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was watching President Biden..gave up on President Elect because he is the only one being presidential.  Fine job the President is doing and that is a damn shame. He has not even been sworn in yet
1340379409874825217 2020-12-20 03:32:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess they should do something about it, but then, they  should have done something at least a year ago..
1340379134657228800 2020-12-20 03:31:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ROFL
1340378338095984641 2020-12-20 03:27:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Fauci said he took care of Santa but I think he forgot to mention that he also took care of the reindeer just to be sure they were okay for their big night.
1340376799289761793 2020-12-20 03:21:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§£
1340376589289353217 2020-12-20 03:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes but, I left you sleeves to my vest. üòá
1340376417670979586 2020-12-20 03:20:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe it would have been easier on you if you were known for your honesty.
1340367560315973640 2020-12-20 02:45:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You would think he believes he is more important than those 3,000 dying people daily ..
1340367232820457473 2020-12-20 02:43:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or it could be a fat lady on a bed in russia
1340367030634115072 2020-12-20 02:42:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cool not seen it but looking forward to it..maybe it will stop donald
1340359708755038212 2020-12-20 02:13:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 2 sons birthdays,2 sons and wives getting nothing for holidays, 3 grands getting nothing  but heartbreaking as it is..they are all healthy so guess rest can wait. Hang in there @Aimie it will get better
1340359064224751617 2020-12-20 02:11:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe we can pack his bags and send him to russia
1340358860540932096 2020-12-20 02:10:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not like donald even an iota..I did not like seeing an adult behave like donald..not even an iota
1340357495798247424 2020-12-20 02:05:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> forgot to mention  üòÑüòÇü§£
1340357291770572805 2020-12-20 02:04:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984 spit out my hash browns or would have choked
1340357155707363329 2020-12-20 02:03:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Experience says trump lies and virus spreads, experience says trump either ignores and russia wins or he lies with same results.
1340337197040459781 2020-12-20 00:44:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Took them year to get this far
1340336936691613696 2020-12-20 00:43:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought he already left
1340336049923518468 2020-12-20 00:39:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You just want an excuse not to pay taxes..and it is obvious you know little about life
1340335939730681864 2020-12-20 00:39:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure Biden won't feel it but we can pay your way if need be..republicans often are on welfare
1340322466242113536 2020-12-19 23:45:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They dominate because people want instant info..they can go to many search engines but choose google because it is easier and quicker. Do not know that that is googles doing
1340321679688552448 2020-12-19 23:42:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He thinks he is correct because no one stood up to say he was wrong
1340321360829181957 2020-12-19 23:41:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh the pity..seems to me if trump had been less self centered..could be a whole dif story.üòÜ
1340321024819277826 2020-12-19 23:40:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RonJohnsonWI     Those are the same people who deliver your groceries, make jets run etc. If they can't eat or pay rent, you won't get their services and might have to do it all yourself
1340321023401537536 2020-12-19 23:40:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't help myself, lost patience , compassion &amp; understanding for idiots. @RonJohnsonWI should be feeling gratitude for what he has, not shrug off the people who do not have what he has.
1340318580102094850 2020-12-19 23:30:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad you are there for him. If he lost "friends" they were not friends to begin with..if he lost family members, some will be back, others won't and they are doing him a favor. Remember you can choose friends not family
1340318071416893442 2020-12-19 23:28:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/ZG4DDaOn34   why wear a mask , wash hands, keep a distance , stay out of crowds? Maybe you could have askedthis senator..but too late
1340316954133999617 2020-12-19 23:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good luck to them all and those they come in contact with.
1340316790270902273 2020-12-19 23:23:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they need compassion for their ignorance
1340308580793262081 2020-12-19 22:50:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why am I doubting this. BIG TIME
1340307045392781313 2020-12-19 22:44:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has friends in high places that will pardon him if needed
1340306877985513472 2020-12-19 22:43:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be great if everyone that wanted a job had one..but 1. maybe they have covid, 2 or no employer.. 3. Maybe too old to work now (in the eyes of employers)? Is he right?
1340306049862131713 2020-12-19 22:40:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do u walk with your nose up donalds rear, so you do not need to work?  Shame you have no brains or eyes to see with
1340278905354268673 2020-12-19 20:52:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm unless he has access to trumps magic med, hope he won't be saying "I wish I had paid attention and listened"
1340277940668526592 2020-12-19 20:48:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @USNavyMomPA @SandiAnthony1   could this explain it?
1340277742399578118 2020-12-19 20:48:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish all these people that say that would tell us what has he done that makes or made us fortunate?
1340277377033785344 2020-12-19 20:46:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do the right thing no matter how tempting everything else might be..and be patient.
1340276798970601472 2020-12-19 20:44:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious-what heritage, mission, culture?
1340276144311050240 2020-12-19 20:41:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What a guy..should not be on force
1340275497826172930 2020-12-19 20:39:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I needed a good laugh..thanksüòÑüò∑
1340275174797701123 2020-12-19 20:37:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984 Is there a third choice?
1340146656885563394 2020-12-19 12:07:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when trump blames democrats..it means look at the republicans
1340140093726740486 2020-12-19 11:41:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is trumps intent. does this convince you why trump was president and besides a get out of jail free card and power why he wants to be president. Hope more than anything this behavior tells EVERYONE he or his family or friends should never be voted for again
1340139549213798401 2020-12-19 11:39:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IngrahamAngle      Does trump stooge sound familiar to you? It should.
1340139103128580097 2020-12-19 11:37:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does nothing about anything russian..except to say "they said it wasn't them"..good enough for me
1340138875176579072 2020-12-19 11:36:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden @DrBiden May they and you all be filled with peace.
1340138531528855555 2020-12-19 11:34:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> look at the expression on his face
1340138220672200704 2020-12-19 11:33:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope moderna vaccine was merit based
1340137241730031617 2020-12-19 11:29:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he will not be president after the 20th so it does not matter what he screams, hollers and rants. Thinking people know what he is
1340136838699380739 2020-12-19 11:28:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that would be the fault of trump and his insane cult followers..maybe one day there will be another but not in an immediate rush
1340136539939061763 2020-12-19 11:27:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tear down the walls?!
1340136410339299340 2020-12-19 11:26:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She is beautiful and so are all the people in their masks
1340102416285523970 2020-12-19 09:11:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and we care why? because donald always had a dream?
1340102301441265667 2020-12-19 09:11:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> JOE BIDEN is PRESIDENT on January 20. No matter what republicans admit or try to block or slow down, or try to convince others of, the thinking people know @JoeBiden is President Elect &amp; next president. After completing his revenge tour,trump walks out with tail between legs
1340100976393465859 2020-12-19 09:05:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they ignore that as they ignore all trump
1340100887969198081 2020-12-19 09:05:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden will be a real president with eyes on order of importance
1340100696205606912 2020-12-19 09:04:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even this has to be politics with no regard for the people who need it
1340100297977315328 2020-12-19 09:03:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh certainly consequential but certainly not in a  good way..
1340099793020973058 2020-12-19 09:01:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Where is the money coming from? Why do we need it right now?
1340099296297934849 2020-12-19 08:59:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those particular people cannot imagine living on less

1340055403523092483 2020-12-19 06:04:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sean why dont you go find  a job
1340054169634410496 2020-12-19 05:59:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is nothing in this country with this president that is too out of bounds to consider
1340053509593567237 2020-12-19 05:57:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still Cuddly
1340050058507632641 2020-12-19 05:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just feels like too much
1340049719846989826 2020-12-19 05:42:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would fox be frustrated..seems they are only ones..would you ask trump about his kids? Would you make them a headline? Nah you would not
1340026816891916290 2020-12-19 04:11:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG Warm and Cuddly, just hope they don't mind the pose. Soooo CUDDLY
1340025303515746305 2020-12-19 04:05:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not a conspiracy theorist either, but so much is going on right now..can't help but wonder
1340024884928372737 2020-12-19 04:03:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would love to see ron johnson and some other crackpots try living on 600 a month or even 1200..prices  even for food keep going up, not down
1340024346627231750 2020-12-19 04:01:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very funny
1340013772791025664 2020-12-19 03:19:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @senronjohnson why didn't you worry about the money when you spent the government into the ground for unnecessary or unwanted items that only republicans wanted
1340012982970052609 2020-12-19 03:16:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @WISenRonJohnson  you are a shmuck
1340012414528581636 2020-12-19 03:13:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nah, the probably use sponges or machinery-quite a vision though
1340012154896969734 2020-12-19 03:12:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those of us that can think for ourselves already know tucker carlson is a fake for trump
1340005076249796613 2020-12-19 02:44:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is this still the USA?  üò™
1339982268102795264 2020-12-19 01:14:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> could donald be having a temper tantrum?
1339965370971676677 2020-12-19 00:06:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sen McCain patriot and hero unlike so many today who do not seem to care about this country but maybe other countries first. Sen McCain was this country first and always
1339964845706371072 2020-12-19 00:04:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Part of the revenge tour.
1339964232130048002 2020-12-19 00:02:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe you should offer the suggestion to Pfizer

1339947492360785928 2020-12-18 22:55:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Luv this!!!! Good morning to you
1339946678984556547 2020-12-18 22:52:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was thinking sound would have been nice..but, we all got the idea..grandpa is a hero
1339946519210975232 2020-12-18 22:51:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is love. Hope grandpa and grandma are fine.
1339945766232731652 2020-12-18 22:49:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump sends pence and once again shows he is a coward
1339945447746625536 2020-12-18 22:47:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump       Sounds like sheer desperation. You have already ruined the GOP  and I would hope Republicans that have stood up to you  will not back down..sniveling bully
1339780552501682176 2020-12-18 11:52:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is on the apprentice and he was fired
1339780397480198144 2020-12-18 11:51:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Question is why would "administration" slow shipping unless yet one more part of revenge tour
1339780019149811712 2020-12-18 11:50:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> getting closer and closer
1339779512687599616 2020-12-18 11:48:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump       What about russia?
1339779200249696258 2020-12-18 11:47:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I second that
1339769874223140864 2020-12-18 11:10:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is total insanity
1339769603346579456 2020-12-18 11:08:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Prove it not just say it?
1339769396504522754 2020-12-18 11:08:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Considering lawsuit? Fed up with what I see
1339768850783592451 2020-12-18 11:06:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Blue is a very nice relaxing color, particularly in Georgia
1339768509023268865 2020-12-18 11:04:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In light of circumstances is there a way trump can be removed from office in a hurry?
1339768224670466050 2020-12-18 11:03:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is something drastically wrong with this picture
1339717931505246210 2020-12-18 07:43:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   üòÜüò∑
1339709749374443520 2020-12-18 07:11:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry this just looks so bitter.  Just bitter, no matter how they earned it, far as I know they worked honestly for it. Yes, I would like some of that money but they earned it I did not.
1339709063140093954 2020-12-18 07:08:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would not be as photo op worthy
1339707803263504389 2020-12-18 07:03:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> keep calling him crazy it will become his defense.
1339707612460421124 2020-12-18 07:02:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He says nothing about russia. I am guessing, somewhere we could find the reason for it but that he has destroyed any evidence. Just a guess
1339707406369103877 2020-12-18 07:01:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why dignify the word rape with a capital R..all caps or none. No reason at all for you to be embarrassed. Why not talk to a counselor about it?? It really is time to let it go.  Wish you well. I hope your rapist has sense enough to be embarrassed by what he did to you. I am sorry
1339699500470988810 2020-12-18 06:30:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Another trump intentional screw up or just looks that way?
1339699226905894913 2020-12-18 06:29:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds delightful
1339699133104480259 2020-12-18 06:28:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering who it is and where it is.
1339698935766650880 2020-12-18 06:28:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No wonder he was so concerned about fraud. He always does it, he blames everyone else for what he does..no different. Maybe Florida needs a recount
1339697595183210497 2020-12-18 06:22:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry this should be a freebee..we have paid for enough of his "entertainment"
1339697364471300096 2020-12-18 06:21:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thought he said he voted from there?
1339695830211674112 2020-12-18 06:15:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> President Elect Biden is stepping in to fill the void
1339695529563975691 2020-12-18 06:14:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad one of the two is President. and it is not Biden
1339694843749142531 2020-12-18 06:11:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gee why postpone..it would intrude on trumps revenge tour
1339694431302275075 2020-12-18 06:10:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity republicans have nothing better to do
1339681312907681794 2020-12-18 05:18:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> First snow in 3 yrs..I wish.  It was gone here today because of the rain..where I live is the dividing line snow/rain. So about half inch.  My sons got 5 or so I guess. Two dif states and locations. One in same state as me üòínot on dividing line
1339672413118869507 2020-12-18 04:42:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You live in PA because you enjoy the fun of shoveling
1339672186303508480 2020-12-18 04:41:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes and they also fired the pandemic team that were in the white house
1339671984964313089 2020-12-18 04:41:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am in NJ and couple days ago it was 70 degrees then in couple days followed by a snow storm
1339660599849050118 2020-12-18 03:55:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I asked someone what that means..the most intelligent response was..wait and see
1339659901765890048 2020-12-18 03:53:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> insanity runs in the family
1339650121961787392 2020-12-18 03:14:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bear understands
1339649810685636620 2020-12-18 03:12:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to see the Vindmann brothers "escort" him
1339649644729647107 2020-12-18 03:12:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If trump has not learned at any other time, he will learn it was on loan to him then
1339618863323877382 2020-12-18 01:10:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just disgusting. Patriots do not do what you do or say what you say
1339618637641117698 2020-12-18 01:09:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> AOC has a lot of growing to do..wish no matter how good the ideas and thoughts, should be  mandatory sit out the first couple years and take time to learn
1339617811883315202 2020-12-18 01:05:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but who is counting?
1339617614608404484 2020-12-18 01:05:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would be glad to see him removed, particularly if live streamed

1339591157374832640 2020-12-17 23:19:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @svdate trump never has anything directly to do with anything..he just starts the ball rolling and sits back to watch.

1339590619174371329 2020-12-17 23:17:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he is trying hard. Astute observation.

1339571905293070337 2020-12-17 22:03:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is not a criminal or out to settle old scores. Besides, the neighbors are suing to keep him out.üòÜüò∑

1339403469485203456 2020-12-17 10:54:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you wishing you wore a mask? I seriously hope you are fine but I am out of patience with repubs who had to obey their tin god,then got sick. Now I hear the head of security got a terrible case of Covid19 &amp; they amputated his leg. Now there is a go fund me for him? use brains
1339401379929075713 2020-12-17 10:45:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and the stuff he is accusing others of is exactly what he is doing
1339400992236957697 2020-12-17 10:44:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think you are confusing your presidents..talk to donald
1339397598617190411 2020-12-17 10:30:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I guess if trump thinks its okay they all think it is okay
1339397376361041921 2020-12-17 10:29:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probably no reason for any investigation but trump has convinced the world it is necessary as part of his biden revenge..pathetic
1339383302201946113 2020-12-17 09:33:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only if you get permits for guns or background checks whatever is needed to make them legal
1339381620063821827 2020-12-17 09:27:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> let him contemplate I am sure nothing would give Biden more joy then evicting him
1339381397933449216 2020-12-17 09:26:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like running through his mind is the spoiled child who says to himself" ok what further damage  can i do?"
1339381009733840897 2020-12-17 09:24:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is not the only one needs to be tried for treason and go to prison
1339380675707854854 2020-12-17 09:23:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not get me wrong I can use the money, but I am more fighting mad over trumps peoplke saying he wanted everyone infected  https://t.co/AkEe5sRmkI
1339370158792593408 2020-12-17 08:41:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can't hand out common sense either
1339369890629693443 2020-12-17 08:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unbelievable really selfish and ignorant ..they can always redo the wedding, cant bring people back from dead
1339368310811598848 2020-12-17 08:34:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That GoFundMe page is great for recreation but NOT for fees incurred because he got covid from being in the white house with donald.  This is insane. donald needs to pay medical and other expenses. This is the WHITE HOUSE SECURITY CHIEF. donald get off your ass
1339367248834801664 2020-12-17 08:30:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because of past history, Merrick Garland..but whichever Joe decides it is his cabinet, I am sure he is getting suggestions and orders from all directions..BUT whichever is more capable and knowledgeable for the position is the right person
1339366322946383872 2020-12-17 08:26:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is nothing marked about fake?
1339366114447544321 2020-12-17 08:25:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know that fox is fake news..that is all we need to know
1339365954267078656 2020-12-17 08:25:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds good to me
1339364549921828864 2020-12-17 08:19:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should not be one..whatever it would be called is not for childrens ears or to be celebrated
1339362503000780800 2020-12-17 08:11:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right or wrong not is not the point. trumplikins have obeyed trump as they go on ..but Biden is not like trump, Biden wants to work with everyone. Comments like that won't help.
1339345600387706881 2020-12-17 07:04:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As long as the republican is not in trumps pocket
1339345328429019136 2020-12-17 07:03:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For Biden it is normal though
1339345171100684288 2020-12-17 07:02:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A Biden fan who has kept quiet and now relief is in sight so relieving frustration..just a guess
1339340478525870081 2020-12-17 06:43:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would you be wrong?  People need to eat. I have made the same choices..and I have no problem with it..neither should you. Of course if you feel that you must,  if you normally send 20 to food banks..instead send 15 &amp; 5 to GA. I do believe that feeding people should be first
1339334821571604496 2020-12-17 06:21:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lies are more acceptable  and easier to digest than facts to many

1339326987886850050 2020-12-17 05:50:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People actually read this? Men who do not wear masks have more a need to check testosterone
1339318702475534337 2020-12-17 05:17:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> disgusting
1339318187184287745 2020-12-17 05:15:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is so susceptible to idiocy ..just make it sound good and appeal to donalds taste and desires
1339316499392196608 2020-12-17 05:08:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good lord..guess they want to see how many cases they can get thrown out on their own
1339315689379819522 2020-12-17 05:05:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> many as you are comfortable with üòÜ
1339289700415254529 2020-12-17 03:22:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If they "knew it" why not stand up to it
1339289461809700864 2020-12-17 03:21:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry have to ask...masks anyone?
1339289311993360386 2020-12-17 03:20:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Funny thing is, not likely it is being heard in any court or senate hearing...but lets him ramble
1339269274620334080 2020-12-17 02:00:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> After I read the last sentence that is how I interpreted it..but if not..then I agree, time for him to move it.
1339268776945197061 2020-12-17 01:58:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the party of trump is not the republican party
1339268667067015171 2020-12-17 01:58:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has to wait until January. I said exactly the same thing til I saw his last line.
1339267734627082242 2020-12-17 01:54:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We need to remember that
1339267142810734597 2020-12-17 01:52:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering which credit u WaPo would give him? 300,000+ dead or allowing scientists to work on the vaccines? Maybe  would give him credit for making paperwork easier but still see 300000+ people in cemeteries and millions sick ..so credit for which?
1339266567914270720 2020-12-17 01:50:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> slimy disgusting DeJoy
1339265803158511616 2020-12-17 01:47:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not understand what was funny.. until I turned sound on
1339265499889332225 2020-12-17 01:45:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Might think good idea..except.........patriots? they tried to overthrow democracy. not patriots at al
1339260310830673924 2020-12-17 01:25:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My sense as listening and watching him
1339260202097500163 2020-12-17 01:24:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watched you and @joebiden  so odd, no drama, no insults, no nonsense,  no hour and half rambling speeches and sentences that make sense. ..who can ask for more!!
1339251740277923842 2020-12-17 00:51:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Warrnock and @ossoff  will win the election anything else is disrespectful
1339251045722152963 2020-12-17 00:48:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should get credit for the speed the paperwork got out of the way..but each time I want to try to give credit I only think about all the deaths and hospitalizations that did not have to be..had trump been honest
1339250578090823681 2020-12-17 00:46:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes by jove you are right.. explains his charm..
1339249727184003075 2020-12-17 00:43:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> right now, I  would take it and be grateful
1339249406009352192 2020-12-17 00:41:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oops lol..nice u mentioned onion now I have to find it and remove it..but it is believable
1339248877703221248 2020-12-17 00:39:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôè
1339236215078400000 2020-12-16 23:49:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to far in distance waiting to see next little bit of idiocy he is doing
1339217978034892800 2020-12-16 22:37:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how much he was paid to show his bigotry and anger?
1339193481735106561 2020-12-16 20:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was there a great donation to the hospital? Name is trump still supposedly human and not above laws or rules
1339192858079858690 2020-12-16 20:57:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> too many are trying to beat the system..it is not smart
1339192546426310661 2020-12-16 20:55:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Best wishes for a successful surgery and  complete recovery for Lila. üôèüôèand her family.
1339191743632306176 2020-12-16 20:52:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would be afraid anyone he put in as Commerce Sec. would be under the influence of donald rather than the country
1339191413473423361 2020-12-16 20:51:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has his minions everywhere
1339190777096925186 2020-12-16 20:48:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The 80+million think that it was not just democrats who voted for @JoeBiden
1339065074867204098 2020-12-16 12:29:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SecPompeo  I hope you donated the unused food
1339060197831159810 2020-12-16 12:10:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pathetic that the great majority of guests had more sense than the host.

1339037338106818564 2020-12-16 10:39:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are we surprised? NO
1339033354939850753 2020-12-16 10:23:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YES
1339033092862988288 2020-12-16 10:22:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where was your mask
1339033011912929280 2020-12-16 10:22:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Congratulations to Tom Cruise
1339032817053863944 2020-12-16 10:21:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tom Cruise is the sound of intelligence and less Covid19
1339032338093707264 2020-12-16 10:19:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Has to be a way to stop the insanity and the brainwashing
1339024339899965443 2020-12-16 09:47:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump     needs to tell these people to stop
1339023596824506370 2020-12-16 09:44:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he will be sure to say we should be grateful
1339023008908840963 2020-12-16 09:42:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Valid. There has to be a psych test given to every presidential candidate. Never again can this country go thru this.
1339022601004478464 2020-12-16 09:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Either they believe it or they are cowards
1339022185718018049 2020-12-16 09:39:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Certainly hope he will be spending time until his hearing in jail. This is all so far out of sanity. The poor guy he went after must have been terrified.
1339021544618680320 2020-12-16 09:36:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> these people are nuts and need to be in jail or psych wing
1339021225528594433 2020-12-16 09:35:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hey genius that mask does no good worn that way
1339021053666988039 2020-12-16 09:34:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he is found safe and sound
1339020808350470144 2020-12-16 09:33:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the more people say no to anything the more trumpass says yes
1339019930629443584 2020-12-16 09:30:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all to sick and ignorant to be funny
1339016147233103872 2020-12-16 09:15:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are as uniformed as he is ..election is over trump lost no matter what he tries to pull off he is done
1339011727325851648 2020-12-16 08:57:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Particularly now, we can always use another Democrat. Hope you won't change your mind.
1338972470766956544 2020-12-16 06:21:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all I can think is DUH they do believe they are above the law..hope they learned they are not
1338972172631543810 2020-12-16 06:20:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if documents the judge requested will get where they are supposed to be
1338963750162997248 2020-12-16 05:46:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DeSantis is such a coward
1338959272391172097 2020-12-16 05:29:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry ..and thank you
1338947844930220040 2020-12-16 04:43:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good grief. If only people would fact check maybe they would not sound so stupid
1338947530663538690 2020-12-16 04:42:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oddly I thought kids in hospitals were sick..How selfish and thoughtless  can she be?
1338946621866995713 2020-12-16 04:38:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not think these postings are right
1338946137831698434 2020-12-16 04:36:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The medical and scientific community came together for this medical miracle. Trump did allow shortcuts in paperwork. Science and medicine did not take shortcuts in science or medicine. Trump is neither a doctor or scientist
1338938964489736195 2020-12-16 04:08:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is it going to be four years of this? I certainly hope not
1338938243581153283 2020-12-16 04:05:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like Mayor Pete. Really curious..I might be missing something I need to know. What does he know about DOT that qualifies him as head of DOT?
1338937416053387265 2020-12-16 04:02:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious. What does Pete know about transportation?
1338915577763672064 2020-12-16 02:35:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No court has seen it
1338915033112338435 2020-12-16 02:33:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Last night for the first time in years I slept all night . Did not wake up once and was shocked when opened my eyes and the sun was bright.  Can only assume has something to do with @JoeBiden
1338914503531040770 2020-12-16 02:31:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was not conned by him but..I see how many are even now and I want to cry
1338902625882959879 2020-12-16 01:43:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hate to say it but I see it..white trash
1338902235741368323 2020-12-16 01:42:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doesn't even has to be a "good" job just a job that shows you care about the people you serve.
1338901885357608967 2020-12-16 01:40:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Adulthood is a difficult place to be when you have never learned how to live as a child
1338897331870117893 2020-12-16 01:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> government is supposed to be about good for the country not individuals
1338897191113527299 2020-12-16 01:22:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and what about the republicans in the senate what scrutiny should they be given?
1338896792101015552 2020-12-16 01:20:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am furious fox gets too much attention
1338887299925479425 2020-12-16 00:43:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> odd thing, it should not be headlines, it should be normal

1338876575983546369 2020-12-16 00:00:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish I could hug them all
1338866734640496647 2020-12-15 23:21:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All they did and Biden will be President because Democracy wins.
1338866524094808071 2020-12-15 23:20:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The same people will also be the  people who wind up in ERs with Covid19 expecting doctors and nurses to put their lives on the line for them and those people will do all they can to save you or your family members....and you wont even wear a mask..so disgusting
1338865992076673025 2020-12-15 23:18:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well people ,Biden will be president
1338858207113072640 2020-12-15 22:47:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He just keeps getting smaller

1338839969201315841 2020-12-15 21:34:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No wonder Frankie speaks. Not surprised. Look at all that intelligence and wisdom in those eyes. Look at that grin. Why wouldn't he speak? (She?) But still scary to know Frankie can speak.
1338701867682062337 2020-12-15 12:26:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right, it is not normal and he is a frail guy and he is your "friend"

1338661943016628224 2020-12-15 09:47:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is passed desperation and insanity. Maybe it is filed so he can plead insanity..asking what sort of sane person would do this.
1338661535065968640 2020-12-15 09:45:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not only surprise, shock me silly
1338661116424105993 2020-12-15 09:44:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am amazed you did not officially run. So long since I have seen you.  I missed you Dudley and  think that they counted wrong. Happy Holidays pup

1338660221552562176 2020-12-15 09:40:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The purpose is simple..to drain more money from his trumplikins
1338659862365007876 2020-12-15 09:39:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he ever speak truth? He did not believe he could not be "the" candidate ..one day maybe he will think it but not likely he believes anyone can dislike him enough to not vote for him
1338659013156810755 2020-12-15 09:35:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Prerequisite for not voting for trump is you need to think not just follow. Great job, not likely you will regret it.
1338652232024281089 2020-12-15 09:08:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very very strange. Sounded like a grown up
1338652073865465857 2020-12-15 09:08:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Frankie is a sweetie..now I will say Happy Birthday. If he responds please let me know
1338651777852387328 2020-12-15 09:07:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not care about this country..look at his history. trump wants to stay out of jail and keep benefits of presidency
1338651566501457922 2020-12-15 09:06:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So insane..elections are to select person wanted as president. Joe Biden won. Do not have to like it but it is how it is.  trump was given opportunity to go challenge in court..all courts threw him out.Time to grow up &amp;realize what elections are for.Not  to have a trump minifit.
1338643087644635136 2020-12-15 08:32:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he have sense enough to be humiliated? I doubt it or he would not constantly kick himself in the ankle
1338636498594394112 2020-12-15 08:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would we expect trump to stand up to anything russian?
1338636359054077954 2020-12-15 08:05:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Warp Speed is worthy of commendation until I keep thinking that if the virus was paid attention to from the start, it is not likely the price would have been so high
1338630267167264769 2020-12-15 07:41:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needs a pardon (or will need it)
1338630187685130248 2020-12-15 07:41:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As emasculated as he wanted it to be
1338629597936709632 2020-12-15 07:39:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course he would pardon barr, look at that glowing resignation letter barr gave to trump
1338629304863879172 2020-12-15 07:37:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now they can ride out on the maga elephant
1338629019051429888 2020-12-15 07:36:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know trump is worthless about a lot of things..just wait a few days for Pres Elect Biden
1338628837408710661 2020-12-15 07:36:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Time has it right.
1338618223802060801 2020-12-15 06:53:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you heard Barrs letter, he sure knows how to suck up to trump to spare himself
1338617377500647430 2020-12-15 06:50:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> call it insanity
1338615568388288512 2020-12-15 06:43:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> charming little piggy
1338614469623156739 2020-12-15 06:38:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waiting for President Joe Biden ..
1338611672076972034 2020-12-15 06:27:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Surprised the dog did not make a meal out of the singer
1338611458041663498 2020-12-15 06:26:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DeSantis is stupid. There must be some sort of charges that can be filed..sounds like a clone of trump.
1338585032986914816 2020-12-15 04:41:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should mention we cant really fire him until after 270 votes..but then can have a mass donald your fired tweet
1338584821765967874 2020-12-15 04:41:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very relatable ad
1338581124642189316 2020-12-15 04:26:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I second that (can I do it)
1338570969380769799 2020-12-15 03:46:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very observant of you. When they point at what Dems are doing, they are pointing at themselves.
1338569337599389700 2020-12-15 03:39:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting
1338568962322419716 2020-12-15 03:38:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could it be?
1338563017471123456 2020-12-15 03:14:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to wonder what country or is it person you are representing?
1338562340674031616 2020-12-15 03:11:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They abuse the flag and for that reason, I  will not fly one until trump is gone
1338562047198572545 2020-12-15 03:10:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will be steering them to the planet he now resides on
1338561770479374337 2020-12-15 03:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wore his admiration for the cult on his sleeve
1338561223454023684 2020-12-15 03:07:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÑ about time someone figured it out
1338561085100716034 2020-12-15 03:06:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My plan is once trump is gone to hang the flag in my window for the first time in forever and show it on here but only once trump is gone, the day America is returned to all Americans
1338547597166915584 2020-12-15 02:13:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You told everyone democracy works and you ruined my day.
1338547402463178769 2020-12-15 02:12:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sometimes the country takes a curve but in the end..."This is America . . . Here, right matters." -- Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman
1338547129049096195 2020-12-15 02:11:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope they ship all of these trump supporters to some far off island and send trump with since he lets them believe their behavior is fine
1338546736667762690 2020-12-15 02:09:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> watching results..so exciting
1338544727071846402 2020-12-15 02:01:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could not control the grin  that came across my face when heard that. Wonder if trump is a believer yet
1338518190931009539 2020-12-15 00:16:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't look a day older either.  üéÇ Happy Birthday and thanks for all you have done.
1338507766093262849 2020-12-14 23:34:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Keep your view to yourself. Most do not agree
1338507322235248641 2020-12-14 23:33:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Isn't it nice to see how america would be living under trump and his friends?
1338506961944539137 2020-12-14 23:31:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better to spend someone elses money..
1338506764711579650 2020-12-14 23:30:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am watching,  enjoying and learning.
1338506606259150848 2020-12-14 23:30:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôÑüòÜ Knew you had it in you!  üòÇ
1338325304608247808 2020-12-14 11:29:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 25th amendment before nothing left?
1338325160810737667 2020-12-14 11:29:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not expect anything from trump unless it is something benefits him. He honestly just does not care and has not from day one
1338324874452938752 2020-12-14 11:28:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very astute and observant of you..has it also dawned on you yet that he did not really think Covid 19 would be gone after the first person?
1338324621247045633 2020-12-14 11:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sounds like daddy and sounds like  a fake video
1338324407069126656 2020-12-14 11:26:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe (we all hope) he is just tired out and needs a good nights sleepüôèüôè Best wishes for good news
1338324047403343873 2020-12-14 11:24:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> saying what  was said about being unconscionable is just the right word to get him pardoned
1338312764553617408 2020-12-14 10:40:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sad thing is there needs to be another party..just not party of trump but it cant be Republicans for at least the next election cycle and candidates have to be vetted to make sure real sane American republicans
1338312137937195009 2020-12-14 10:37:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BillPascrell  you are marvelous!!
1338311572838621191 2020-12-14 10:35:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right..written that way very inspiring
1338310803410313216 2020-12-14 10:32:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is so fantastic ..great job New Zealand. PM cares about people there . So thrilled for you all .
1338307539474190336 2020-12-14 10:19:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump tries , though I never heard it from John Lewis it is how I feel. Apparently trump does not like people who like and respect themselves
1338299168629121027 2020-12-14 09:46:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> class act  thanks for sharing it
1338291976672866308 2020-12-14 09:17:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is the matter with you @GenFlynn  Working for a guy trying to overthrow democracy?
1338277301109272577 2020-12-14 08:19:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do they really look as (old-fashioned word) skanky as I think they look?
1338277083777265671 2020-12-14 08:18:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This has nothing whatsoever to do with G-d
1338276957415469058 2020-12-14 08:17:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very accurately said
1338276772517965824 2020-12-14 08:17:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bad.photoshop, his mouth does not even work with his face..
1338275884281831428 2020-12-14 08:13:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is fake and yes he does
1338270787422334978 2020-12-14 07:53:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ChrisCuomo Sure wish I saw this tweet

1338270172537348104 2020-12-14 07:50:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fascist mob
1338269901719560197 2020-12-14 07:49:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can only think everyone should be saying "stop the lies "instead of making it cutesy
1338269571627802628 2020-12-14 07:48:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you feel as good as you look sir. Happy Birthday
1338269427524046850 2020-12-14 07:47:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disappointed not mad. Another case of trump does what benefits trump
1338260855344025600 2020-12-14 07:13:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he never does speak up to russia..so why start now? Just one more way to show he lies about America first too
1338260468268474372 2020-12-14 07:12:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where is trump now?
1338259973692919811 2020-12-14 07:10:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He never put this country first in his 4 years as president
1338259872106881026 2020-12-14 07:09:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you think?
1338258057952944132 2020-12-14 07:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to wait til Monday? Or, friends in high places?
1338250584529498113 2020-12-14 06:32:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doesn't anyone there think they should break the chain?
1338250405965426693 2020-12-14 06:32:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does this report mean being on the payroll runs in the family?

1338245561791680514 2020-12-14 06:12:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you are strange
1338223870600425476 2020-12-14 04:46:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MSNBC   @CNN why do commentators not call at trumps comments as lies. You use fancy words but most times you do not use the word LIES. Lies need to be used. He starts his interviews with how big he wins and you come and say false information etc. WHY NOT SAY HE LIED?
1338219185546153991 2020-12-14 04:28:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yes he is
1338219110195482627 2020-12-14 04:27:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure does pay to encourage voting..most particularly, against trump
1338218799447805959 2020-12-14 04:26:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÄüòäü§£ü§£üò∑
1338215933463113729 2020-12-14 04:15:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like he wants democracy to win, not so much party
1338204585916313600 2020-12-14 03:30:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not answer itself unless willing to look with open honest eyes
1338204392428892161 2020-12-14 03:29:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably did exactly what the intent was..when will any decent members of the GOP stand up and say enough?
1338203754957516803 2020-12-14 03:26:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Donald you did not win,  donald you still trying to make money over your scam? People are learning slow but sure ,you are a scam artist. You would throw away the 2 party system for your gratification. Stop and think what this country has given to you, you destroy it or try. SAD
1338191926001102851 2020-12-14 02:39:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They make an amazing couple
1338191675571777536 2020-12-14 02:38:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> First he should spend a couple days at his home in DE to give a chance for all disinfecting to be complete and everything dried out or dead
1338191326773473281 2020-12-14 02:37:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> take it from the source
1338166076375523331 2020-12-14 00:57:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yeah I know but had to do it
1338165985677877251 2020-12-14 00:56:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Show you are better than that piece of trash
1338165830517985280 2020-12-14 00:56:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good joke..something like trump
1338165659067424769 2020-12-14 00:55:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> freedom of the press
1338165344293298178 2020-12-14 00:54:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Covering mouth with hand bear
1338164683589693442 2020-12-14 00:51:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WHY CANT FOX TELL THE TRUTH?
1338131137135251460 2020-12-13 22:38:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now if we could only change the date to January 20..THAT would be the achievement of a lifetime
1338130920914776064 2020-12-13 22:37:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watched coverage of the morons in Washington yesterday. I realized proud boys is a very accurate name ,they never grew to adulthood.. must admit I do not know any boys that would be there or be proud of themselves in that situation. But 'boys" is accurate
1338128826870755330 2020-12-13 22:29:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't help but think as I saw another post here today..the ones who wear the masks and though they would rather be with friends and families but skip the holidays are the true PATRIOTS
1338128023745400832 2020-12-13 22:25:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Working on muscle between ears?
1338127912617340936 2020-12-13 22:25:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Big difference between fools and patriots
1338127821202448385 2020-12-13 22:25:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Patriot has a problem with wearing masks 2 save their own lives or those around them?What about his family when he is nt putting on a show for the camera,the people in the grocery store..or people that will have to take care of him in the hospital whn his stupidity is fully knwn?
1338126683690381312 2020-12-13 22:20:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if we can keep up with all the trump scandals that are coming
1338126540610080768 2020-12-13 22:20:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump hates women with brains..unless they benefit him of course
1338126272933883905 2020-12-13 22:18:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just proves how little trump cares about this country or its  people..unless supporters of course but he trashes them too when it benefits him
1338126042263941121 2020-12-13 22:18:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> protestors for trump have destroyed the GOP with the help of the GOP..  maybe they need to read about this country and how it has worked for 250 years
1337973826118950912 2020-12-13 12:13:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she wants to lie to herself and then lie to everyone else because she has talked herself into believing her lies
1337973621940162560 2020-12-13 12:12:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @brookehryan I know I cant do anything but I am so very sorry..can only say know your mom is in a better place now.

1337972959357652992 2020-12-13 12:09:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is a cult and this how cults rave and rant and behave.never believed that people could be but.they are possessed
1337972713030377472 2020-12-13 12:08:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because we threw trump out and now it is the USA and there is freedom of speech..that is how he wastes his freedom most do not listen

1337972013412065287 2020-12-13 12:06:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is a very corrupt heart..fits right into this administration..does not fit in next one
1337950226464780290 2020-12-13 10:39:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My family is healthy and so far my health could sure be worse so who knows. :)  But I am grateful.
1337950224816492550 2020-12-13 10:39:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have it but think more covid..who knows just still feel grateful because someday it will be over and if i live long enough trump will be gone , peace will be back and last but not least..I will get to hold and hug my family ..so I feel grateful can still be worse.just exhausted
1337945953802792966 2020-12-13 10:22:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can guess...fine people on both sides..nazis scum,kkk etc
1337944881248002051 2020-12-13 10:18:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if there is enough manpower to handle the threats now..I would find manpower for Alex Jones but no straight jacket. Should be in front of judge for that threat. I have lost all patience for all excuses
1337944247706718209 2020-12-13 10:15:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Jill Biden if that is her preference.
1337944123697999872 2020-12-13 10:15:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Impressive, you are typing while dead?
1337943245146492933 2020-12-13 10:11:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious..do people want qualifications or diversity if can't have both? I want qualifications more than anything..is that just me?
1337924366038921218 2020-12-13 08:56:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad we agree
1337922912947466240 2020-12-13 08:50:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üòäüíü
1337922605748285441 2020-12-13 08:49:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never to late to get one. so do not be sad..just do it
1337922221369659394 2020-12-13 08:48:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I also agree
1337915589210337285 2020-12-13 08:21:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wanted to prove he could own the Supreme Court. He can't
1337912467675099141 2020-12-13 08:09:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you did realize I do not know their names so I called them people ..was that bad?
1337912247889387521 2020-12-13 08:08:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> absolutely
1337912088744882177 2020-12-13 08:07:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you all Justices for putting Country, Constitution and law above a mere manchild
1337911686909530115 2020-12-13 08:06:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> SNAP OUT OF IT PEOPLE
1337911552737947650 2020-12-13 08:05:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> geesus how ignorant ..and downright stupid..and what a great cult
1337911265591758849 2020-12-13 08:04:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad you realize it
1337907246265757697 2020-12-13 07:48:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shows how wise we are..just wish people had been wise enough to not vote him in
1337907055819190274 2020-12-13 07:47:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree but wonder if it would bother him if the Mr were a Dr?
1337906695679438849 2020-12-13 07:46:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also an act of love
1337888994856722442 2020-12-13 06:36:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> live long and think about what you have all done, every day of your life
1337888736705732608 2020-12-13 06:35:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't help but wonder if First Lady Dr Jill Biden were First Gentleman Dr Joseph Epstein  would he be so offended?
1337888210731544576 2020-12-13 06:33:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is wrong with First Lady Dr Jill Biden?
1337887885186502662 2020-12-13 06:31:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WSJ is entitled to opinions but that does not mean its opinions are worth much
1337886049356419073 2020-12-13 06:24:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ladies I think but who knows
1337885919374872579 2020-12-13 06:23:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nothing to do with God
1337885859933265921 2020-12-13 06:23:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> throw his pillows away
1337885721072427008 2020-12-13 06:23:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What I have seen in the "republicans" are not leadership they are followers. The youth are not fit to vote in donalds party
1337885463722471434 2020-12-13 06:22:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If 2 percent it is 2 percent too many
1337885268876152833 2020-12-13 06:21:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good lord..no wonder trump is a favorite among the uneducated
1337885054920495116 2020-12-13 06:20:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If there were more than 50 it was a success. I did not watch it
1337884909986308114 2020-12-13 06:19:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is maybe the most pathetic is..in his entire lifetime he never learned to deal with the fact that everyone does not like him nor do they have too
1337884118370103297 2020-12-13 06:16:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ROFL
1337883908239716357 2020-12-13 06:15:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why does anyone pay attention?
1337872419978088451 2020-12-13 05:30:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not call it a game, however, I would call it dangerous and good reason not to vote for any of those involved in this disgusting show of disdain for the USA
1337863117519380482 2020-12-13 04:53:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there are charges for treason,whoever commits it
1337862938078703626 2020-12-13 04:52:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is so insane. Doubt Jesus would be impressed. The miracle is donald is leaving
1337862643865034757 2020-12-13 04:51:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Put them on a ship, supply them with food and water then send the ship to an island somewhere ..have the ship return without them. They do not like democracy no need to be here to influence others
1337861905273249795 2020-12-13 04:48:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right now he is telling himself he put them there and they owed him..pity they put USA above trump. As it should be.. just not in trumps pea brain
1337858221294411776 2020-12-13 04:33:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I cannot believe that the people we elect to look out for us are the people who put this country in this condition and do not try to change it.
1337856037454557185 2020-12-13 04:25:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump wants to remove everyone not like him so all of you move and take your lifetimes to settle in
1337842236390846469 2020-12-13 03:30:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> jr is just looking for daddy's approval just as djt tried for his daddy's approval and we see what we got for that. it does not make for cool just makes for a lot of fake and bs
1337805640656424961 2020-12-13 01:04:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like presidents who are presidential..not infants in grown up clothes
1337803692121133060 2020-12-13 00:57:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and now who do we believe? remembering he said top secret
1337803489406308356 2020-12-13 00:56:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I watch his videos with sound off..and it is creepy I can hear him and know who he is blaming and whining about..see his desperation
1337801166265208834 2020-12-13 00:47:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just think separate country across the ocean . We do not need traitors or dictators or those who support them in this country
1337796081816580106 2020-12-13 00:26:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am thrilled that it works ..even if you were just trying to flaunt your power without thinking how it would affect those that want the vaccine and the doubt you cast. If the vaccine would not work I am sure the FDA would not authorize it, with or without you.
1337795079021469698 2020-12-13 00:22:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh lordy the way he reports stories..guess we know truth not needed
1337794820224507904 2020-12-13 00:21:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is fascinating and a bit insane..
1337794542507003907 2020-12-13 00:20:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôÑüòä
1337783741675167749 2020-12-12 23:37:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yup and they are Americans and think that way. YOU LOST TRUMP

1337777864675094529 2020-12-12 23:14:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Start by realizing they are no longer the @GOP many were ready to sell out this country for trumps approval..and I do not mean just in court. What Americans do that? Rename the GOP and call it a security threat
1337603831618736128 2020-12-12 11:42:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Possibly, will return the goods with a divorce decree.
1337603419700416514 2020-12-12 11:41:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad to see he cannot buy his way out of everything. Shame he did not learn that as a child. I hope his children will now learn. Speaking of children have not seen them on here for while..
1337603017466650624 2020-12-12 11:39:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Kayleigh needs to read the Constitution..not donalds version
1337602803703885824 2020-12-12 11:38:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My guess is this is his revenge for the Central Park 5, he wanted them put to death. Took out a full page add in the New York Times..according to DNA they were not guilty.
1337601683522773000 2020-12-12 11:34:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must mean the guests had a chance to relax and enjoy themselves
1337601289702830082 2020-12-12 11:32:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If they donated to the trump campaign not likely they know what trump university is or what happened to it. Maybe they should look it up to see what trump university should have taught anyone about trump and how he adores money and scams people for it.
1337600464729288704 2020-12-12 11:29:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe he should read the Constitution
1337594105807966211 2020-12-12 11:04:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üòá I am now well dressed for any occasion. Even checking out pillows..sorry still you
1337585603441995776 2020-12-12 10:30:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry was you.
1337585301385064450 2020-12-12 10:29:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He assumed he would win because he put those judges in. My congratulations to those Justices. They did the right thing even if they hated doing it.
1337584627653996544 2020-12-12 10:26:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> STAND UP TO TRUMP
1337584486163234817 2020-12-12 10:26:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd I thought they lived up to their responsibility no matter what their personal feelings were
1337584231002894337 2020-12-12 10:25:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mcenany is not stopping yet? THIS IS INSANE THIS IS OVER
1337583945173639171 2020-12-12 10:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope it marks the end for those 126 republicans who in my mind gave up the right to call themselves republicans
1337583190219890689 2020-12-12 10:20:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this whole thing is damn sad
1337550373666557954 2020-12-12 08:10:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Way beyond silly
1337550154807857152 2020-12-12 08:09:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Democracy won. All the antiamerican former republicans now trumplikins need to be run out of office
1337549455424413697 2020-12-12 08:06:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh gosh, we can hardly wait
1337549108526133248 2020-12-12 08:05:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> waiting to see what happens between now and tomorrow morning..betting not likely but he will not be hanging out in public
1337548943257968640 2020-12-12 08:04:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I expected it to fail but I still feel great that it did  https://t.co/vV0CTKhJGK
1337548651552501760 2020-12-12 08:03:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very appropriate I love it.  @JoeBiden
1337548484413632512 2020-12-12 08:03:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They renewed my faith in SCOTUS even if i do not always agree with them
1337548149305511938 2020-12-12 08:01:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To the USA Supreme Court..I say job well done.
1337548016300003330 2020-12-12 08:01:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must admit..good news uh?
1337547887325159425 2020-12-12 08:00:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will prob say Paxton did not try hard enough..but try or not..hope his voters remember him and anyone in any office that supported an authoritarian form of government
1337547457123803137 2020-12-12 07:58:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now he can say his lawyers tried, it is all the judges fault and now we can wait for his next explosion
1337539895817105415 2020-12-12 07:28:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is demented
1337516997882621952 2020-12-12 05:57:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do they need any research results first?
1337516825903587329 2020-12-12 05:57:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THEY ARE IDIOTS..anyone wants to please donald so they lie are idiots..they are idiots if they want  authoritarian rule..lot of reasons to be idiots  if they cant think of the reasons to stand up for democracy maybe they should move to another country that likes authoritarianism
1337516183009030144 2020-12-12 05:54:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you butt out and shut your face, you might even be respected
1337494664153358337 2020-12-12 04:29:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump wants a government where he is the absolute boss. Do we know what that would be called?
1337493786210004993 2020-12-12 04:25:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is it endorsed because trump butted in and bullied them? Or is it endorsed because it is that good? I like to think it as endorsed because it is that good...and now I think the white house has done enough damage so step back

1337478229419040777 2020-12-12 03:23:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is just so disgusting, disgraceful and unamerican. Stop calling them Republicans. trump is not a republican and neither are his sycophants
1337476869738946561 2020-12-12 03:18:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Makes one wonder, is he trying to scare people into not having faith in this ?? This is insane and so is he
1337476657456812032 2020-12-12 03:17:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   We are supposed to be secure that if it is approved it is not because you bullied the FDA. BUTT OUT
1337476656030748672 2020-12-12 03:17:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump    OK what the hell are you doing now. You are telling the FDA  to approve this tomorrow or resign. Are you  trying to scare people into not taking it or into taking it. You are not supposed to be involved.
1337475405272535041 2020-12-12 03:12:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well @amyklobuchar  that seems to be correct
1337474879784964096 2020-12-12 03:10:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If they are part of trying to destroy democracy, they need to speak up and damn the consequences because there really is no excuse. I do not care how terrified they are of him..they should be more terrified of what he is trying to do and they are allowing
1337474273049456641 2020-12-12 03:08:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone does not need to explain. Self explanatory..antiamerican

1337443242544144387 2020-12-12 01:04:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Excellent AG Shapiro.
1337427049946951681 2020-12-12 00:00:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> words are just words to trump, intended for his convenience

1337426702893543427 2020-12-11 23:59:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Be sure to thank djt as he takes credit for this vaccine..he needs to take responsibility for all that happened since the first day he knew about  covid19. To this day has not even emphasized need for a mask. He wants credit for the vaccine.he needs credit for other v word..VIRUS
1337426069964660738 2020-12-11 23:56:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And again, isn't it wonderful ?  Shows good always wins over evil. Just sometimes takes a little longer
1337425511702691840 2020-12-11 23:54:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you have the power to move the calendar faster?

1337422573697687552 2020-12-11 23:42:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donald hasn't changed it..it will be trump and administration that go down as worst and most antiamerican administration in history
1337422252506279937 2020-12-11 23:41:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Abolish it except in extreme cases..like terrorists
1337422079138930690 2020-12-11 23:40:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I still cannot imagine what is happening now..instead of standing for democracy these people are standing for a dictatorship and loss of 2 parties ..so they do not offend trump? Even if signed a loyalty oath to him..loyalty should be for this country
1337421669984591873 2020-12-11 23:39:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Der Spiegel is absolutely right
1337399187516907521 2020-12-11 22:09:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When put in this format it is horrifying
1337399016259252225 2020-12-11 22:09:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also have to worry about the browbeating trump can give to get this support
1337385108995788804 2020-12-11 21:13:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Professionalism began the day that email   was written and mailed
1337384715746152455 2020-12-11 21:12:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mcconnell is like trump..when you think he cant be more antiamerican..he is
1337384228414246912 2020-12-11 21:10:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to love this guy.
1337384105948950540 2020-12-11 21:09:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps revenge
1337247755639590912 2020-12-11 12:08:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also time  the republicans he terrorizes need to stand up to him ..and stand up for  themselves and this country
1337247006377521154 2020-12-11 12:05:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just so impressed that a lawyer thinks this is the right thing for this country..wonder why he allows himself to be so pressured by trump..does he really think trump will win?
1337246584921329664 2020-12-11 12:03:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh this is so lovely!!!!üôÇüò∑
1337245055472513025 2020-12-11 11:57:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh wonderful. Was terrified someone who did not deserve it would get it. This is happy news. Thank you TIME
1337244852191440899 2020-12-11 11:56:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we separate them at the border or say stand down and wait  or we have good people on both sides..all of that instigates hate..hate ends in killing
1337244281229225984 2020-12-11 11:54:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bad idea to determine what you want the country to do based on your emotion
1337235785771151360 2020-12-11 11:20:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> won't live long enough to see the change I would need to see
1337235413631700993 2020-12-11 11:19:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they should all be charged with treason
1337235093639884800 2020-12-11 11:17:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not know that..he  is part of the nazis, trumplkins, proud boys etc etc regime..he forgets this is the USA that has been a democratic republic for 250 or so years.
1337202492124356610 2020-12-11 09:08:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RudyGiulianli  I  am glad you recovered..so quickly but I am angry and sad that not everyone gets the same med.
1337202061667131394 2020-12-11 09:06:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How does it feel to know the great majority cannot get the med you got . They have to suffer and perhaps die. Trump and Friends Got Coronavirus Care Many Others Couldn‚Äôt  https://t.co/ILxbo4F5cL
1337201559160025088 2020-12-11 09:04:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would have believed it years ago, about the time they turned into half baked nuts when I left them because it all seemed so weird even at the time
1337201265659547648 2020-12-11 09:03:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does Jordan really think everyone must vote for trump? That is insanity
1337195557031440384 2020-12-11 08:40:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think she has left earth and is on some other planet
1337195428283097089 2020-12-11 08:40:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> proud boys are not normal either
1337195179875438593 2020-12-11 08:39:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you play some sort of games to get into office?
1337194879865253890 2020-12-11 08:37:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are you nuts?  antifa defense gun? THERE IS NO FREAKING ANTIFA
1337194645793726467 2020-12-11 08:37:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you ask them?
1337184319664754688 2020-12-11 07:56:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So what do you think?
1337183967032827907 2020-12-11 07:54:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't ask
1337183769393045504 2020-12-11 07:53:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No republicans, no democrats just ruler? How did Red and Blue states exist for a couple hundred years. Could it be it was republicans and democrats?
1337183057682587648 2020-12-11 07:50:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not think Joe Biden is like trump
1337176493248614401 2020-12-11 07:24:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> call it fake news?
1337176297626284034 2020-12-11 07:24:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was about to ask what 4 nos for but you answered it thank you

1337175349084479488 2020-12-11 07:20:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is as american as anyone in any foreign country that has no use for honesty, scruples or morals
1337174688414527491 2020-12-11 07:17:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and the same to you!
1337174442582175744 2020-12-11 07:16:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Hanukkah . Best wishes to you and your family,
1337173983259729921 2020-12-11 07:14:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So disgusted by every bit of this. What happened to America, the Constitution , the two party system, morals and right and wrong
1337172918661488640 2020-12-11 07:10:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have apparently taken leave of your senses:  I leave you with these 2 sites take your choice or read both . You want facts here you go  https://t.co/Io5Epzzl8W  https://t.co/b4Mg1g29fl
1337171832961720321 2020-12-11 07:06:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can only think one thing..I truly hope when all these "republicans" see trump leave the white house they hopefully will regain their sanity.
1337169057150328834 2020-12-11 06:55:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only repeat baby is saying moooooooooommmmmmmmmmy
1337163466143129600 2020-12-11 06:33:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whatever it is..It is Hunters issue ..though feel terrible for Hunter and the entire family if there is anything to it. But how many are charged and yet no headlines.
1337163003700125699 2020-12-11 06:31:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mommmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
1337162927980351490 2020-12-11 06:30:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like a windup toy
1337151003402129410 2020-12-11 05:43:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you for having the guts you apparently have
1337145963694133255 2020-12-11 05:23:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the only one I don't trust is trump, he will say and do anything to get the results he wants
1337145786728128512 2020-12-11 05:22:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Then never let it any future member of the trump family or anyone like them in office to roll back programs so this can never happen again
1337145489347768320 2020-12-11 05:21:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That man has not even been sworn in and you already want to tell him what to do? What is wrong with this picture?
1337145156395556864 2020-12-11 05:20:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he did not feel impotent he would not do what he does. Bullies feel impotent but want to feel important so they bully
1337144858717392896 2020-12-11 05:19:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> every paper or computer record that trump had access too or gave directions too needs to be looked into...only way to believe any records
1337144477283184640 2020-12-11 05:17:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and any good parent would speak with their child about that boardgame and having temper tantrums..our baby has gone 70+ years without anyone to say no..I still can't understand how he got to be president
1337139495678914562 2020-12-11 04:57:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Prob have them use saline or something
1337137877847773186 2020-12-11 04:51:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> None of the 3 that deserve it will get it
1337137127021277185 2020-12-11 04:48:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good question..gimme gimme gimme ..cause that is trumps amerika
1337121875462414338 2020-12-11 03:47:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does that surprise you? He wants his kids to be heirs apparent
1337095607681490947 2020-12-11 02:03:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm maybe tell the truth decorated as a reality show?
1337095023012274176 2020-12-11 02:01:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> obviously the truth does not work..
1337094728953847812 2020-12-11 02:00:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only one? Who is the (wo)man who developed a spine and stood up
1337094499298840576 2020-12-11 01:59:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He behaves like a raving lunatic then comes up with these goodies,. can only ask how he strong armed?
1337088605899124736 2020-12-11 01:35:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cannot ignore or they think it is all fine that way..it is not..they are dirt
1337088373702479875 2020-12-11 01:34:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very well said!
1337088038271406084 2020-12-11 01:33:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pigs
1337087332420349955 2020-12-11 01:30:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So if that should happen it would say, why vote? If it says why vote..then it tells us what sort of government we really have and what sort of country we are living in. I do not understand how all those AGs can participate even if it is thrown out as I expect it will be
1337086845927247874 2020-12-11 01:28:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You can find whatever you want..and then you can ignore what you do not want. it was determined that criminal charges cannot be filed against a sitting president. As for Hunter, it is a tax case..and he is not running for president. There are tax cases daily against mere mortals
1337086271181758465 2020-12-11 01:26:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can almost be 100 percent sure that anything that could put trump in a bad light or criminal light is gone

1336880584589783040 2020-12-10 11:49:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Evidence? He is THE donald..what more does he need to provide..cant even provide evidence he is president..just dictator donald..so I assume the Supreme Court can see what this is about and why he wanted the case heard. He wants to collect on the debt.
1336875970377166848 2020-12-10 11:30:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do we actually care?

1336857458074071042 2020-12-10 10:17:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting specimens of humanity. I have about had all I can take. Why are so few (by comparison) objecting to them?
1336857031223992320 2020-12-10 10:15:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what else should be expected..what is more important than donald?
1336856343626608642 2020-12-10 10:12:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am grateful for whatever I have right now. my health, food, not a lot , but some have a lot less. So I donated earlier and hope others will too It does not take a lot ...anything to a reputable food bank is better than nothing.
1336850378411962368 2020-12-10 09:49:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is pathetic not one bit funny
1336849549810413570 2020-12-10 09:45:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have had to stop hearing the count..or trying too
1336849431459737600 2020-12-10 09:45:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does he know he is anti american?
1336849237091491844 2020-12-10 09:44:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I refuse to watch fox..because there are no truth tellers there
1336849054685392897 2020-12-10 09:43:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you really that blind? many thousand dead, many businesses gone, much money missing, children yanked from families, many buddies given favors..the list goes on and on but try to hear this..TRUMP IS IN OFFICE NOT BIDEN
1336848664787087362 2020-12-10 09:42:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will blame everyone but himself. OF COURSE
1336845136312070144 2020-12-10 09:28:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps instead of trying to save trump they should try to save this country  Joe Biden‚Äôs election lawyer responds to Lou Dobbs‚Äô demand the GOP save Trump from electoral loss -  https://t.co/LjVuO1iqF8
1336844309765689349 2020-12-10 09:24:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did anyone have the nerve to tell him he is the one "running" the country?
1336827683104239616 2020-12-10 08:18:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just once I would like to see the Supreme Court say that it is time for trump to stop trying to overturn the will of the people and put the coup too bed.
1336826919606759424 2020-12-10 08:15:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pro choice..but you cannot be pro-life if you were in favor of yanking kids from parents at the border. Think twice before u answer.
1336816597927866369 2020-12-10 07:34:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If I recall, Nixon quit for the good of the country.  trump has no clue about doing anything good for the country
1336815856727318531 2020-12-10 07:31:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listened to trump screaming about Hunter and how "it" is a major crime. Oddly enough ..I think trump  also screamed OBAMA IS NOT A CITIZEN..translates to trump is bs
1336806866890973196 2020-12-10 06:56:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think an appropriate reaction is..Hunter will not be in the white house.  Perhaps the trump children should be good fodder
1336806587915186177 2020-12-10 06:55:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice that Maryland respects the voters and will of the people
1336806166014423045 2020-12-10 06:53:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shame of it all..glad people are reminded he has nothing to do with the ballot
1336805965665067012 2020-12-10 06:52:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol lol
1336790751947223042 2020-12-10 05:52:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Joe was not even running
1336790559978102787 2020-12-10 05:51:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> people need to know cops are doing their job and probably hate it more than any other time in their careers
1336790297636970497 2020-12-10 05:50:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I stand with Hunter
1336790182176174083 2020-12-10 05:49:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is he saying he is fill of hot air?
1336790033316065286 2020-12-10 05:49:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I presume you mean his enabling unamerican cowards?
1336788613271609345 2020-12-10 05:43:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My views are my own:  No one should be nominated for a cabinet position or any other position because of color. Should be strictly based on ability, experience and competence, not blackmail.
1336786392177893377 2020-12-10 05:34:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee how surprising soul of honesty and ethics.
1336786256060092418 2020-12-10 05:34:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> EVER had a doubt of the type person trump is?. look how he is trying to overthrow this country with no thought of the damage he is doing for Biden, how many die or the people? just what he wants, right or wrong just what he wants. Where the hell are trumps cowards?? Unbelievable
1336758825370734599 2020-12-10 03:45:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess they need to ignore masks. They do not need them. For those that wear masks and still show positive. I am truly sorry
1336758593346035717 2020-12-10 03:44:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The way I think of an antichrist is someone who stands for all that is bad..that has what he has shown.. and why he is out of office on Jan 20. Your scam shows the same about you
1336758199601467393 2020-12-10 03:42:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> awesome..so fast
1336757842448162817 2020-12-10 03:41:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Governor Tom Wolfe PA, if you are here..wishing you a complete speedy recovery
1336757657005416451 2020-12-10 03:40:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't be shocked be happy..good things can still happen in 2020 and you were a beneficiary of one good thing
1336717891912290306 2020-12-10 01:02:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you know if trump has a need to throw you under the bus he would?
1336717701989928972 2020-12-10 01:01:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bad news, he has not yet totally flushed
1336717435739795457 2020-12-10 01:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad you noticed.
1336715736467841024 2020-12-10 00:54:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> smart man
1336715454858072064 2020-12-10 00:52:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÑüò∑
1336524814249549824 2020-12-09 12:15:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wasn't it kayleigh who said no lying?
1336524609261285377 2020-12-09 12:14:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no one told them herd immunity works better with masks until vaccinations are ready..then masks and vaccinations are best to get to herd immunity
1336524349185155074 2020-12-09 12:13:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shame you did not have that mission back when we were told how fast it would go away
1336524167190093824 2020-12-09 12:12:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and we voted you guys out -will save a lot of lives
1336523728453300230 2020-12-09 12:11:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if he will ever sober up long enough to hear what he really sounds like
1336523370381398016 2020-12-09 12:09:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been wearing masks, think it is selfish not too
1336523284536553472 2020-12-09 12:09:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good luck..just do not go in looking desperate...wishing you well, have a good feeling about that job interview
1336522991182770181 2020-12-09 12:08:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was this the real ted cruz all along?
1336522847787905024 2020-12-09 12:07:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish they could/would just kick them all out the door
1336522506212155393 2020-12-09 12:06:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôèüò¢üíî
1336499255905804292 2020-12-09 10:33:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is not over it
1336499119309926401 2020-12-09 10:33:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering who the judge is and hoping he will stick to the law..not to partisanship
1336498857115602954 2020-12-09 10:32:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seems to me up is down and down is up..sideways left is sideways right and the more you think and question the more stupid you are..this is trumps world and it is getting worse even though he is leaving office
1336497836435922949 2020-12-09 10:28:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> know what you mean
1336497550795399168 2020-12-09 10:27:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> From your mouth to G-ds ear
1336496122441904129 2020-12-09 10:21:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is about hair brained as it gets
1336494693329190912 2020-12-09 10:15:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> God?
1336494630897135616 2020-12-09 10:15:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I cannot believe anyone is still discussing the white house or its inhabitants..its all obvious insanity
1336494014632235009 2020-12-09 10:12:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> people believe anything that fits their preconceived notions
1336485656302931968 2020-12-09 09:39:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> HMM. so what can you do with the info?
1336482882655752195 2020-12-09 09:28:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 3 cheers for  Supreme Court now they just need to stop trump fro m going to Arizona with all the rallies and covid
1336482642573860864 2020-12-09 09:27:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think trump and his friends need to party there some more and not tell them MASKS if he wants to see how high numbers can get. THIS IS INSANE IT IS INTENTIONAL MURDER. We know republicans think its a sign of manhood to not be masked but that is not what it is at all.
1336481803276853250 2020-12-09 09:24:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be nice if everything that sounds like coal or fracking went away, however, first we need to find money to educate and employ those who depend on those industries to retrain for new industries. Not quite as simple as you make it sound
1336481089548931074 2020-12-09 09:21:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm opposite of winner certainly seems to be loser   trump
1336480897294622720 2020-12-09 09:20:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not really sure, the judges seem fair about this trump nonsense
1336451176724893697 2020-12-09 07:22:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder what she has been drinking or eating
1336450829650374656 2020-12-09 07:21:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Get help!  You are wounded but not in the way you think
1336450491325308931 2020-12-09 07:20:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For a very long time she sounded like needs mental health treatment..now she sounds more like it
1336372526587531265 2020-12-09 02:10:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot believe this country has come to this. The behavior is terrorist particularly when they are the white supremacists nazis and KKK, how is this behavior allowed. How is insanity allowed to rule the country?
1336368045602861056 2020-12-09 01:52:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§£ sure does explain it
1336363584008441858 2020-12-09 01:34:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not know about Doug Jones ..but Merrick Garland, sterling reputation and it would be more than fair
1336359512916324352 2020-12-09 01:18:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> their racism and fear
1336359318371917825 2020-12-09 01:17:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He was no joke and by the time people realized he was evil he would not let people leave
1336359177975951364 2020-12-09 01:17:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is also the gift that he keeps on giving
1336359074703798281 2020-12-09 01:16:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> eek o my ..feel better fast Jenna ..hope you learned to wear masks and not to believe donald
1336358738089963530 2020-12-09 01:15:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do you mean salmon as main course at dinner  or  The Donner Party. group of American pioneers who migrated to California in a wagon train from the Midwest. Delayed by a series of mishaps, spent the winter of 1846‚Äì1847 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountain range will pass on it
1336342530791776256 2020-12-09 00:11:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> even if committed by the president?
1336328476601675786 2020-12-08 23:15:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> combination
1336328399032180741 2020-12-08 23:14:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It  has not stopped amazing me..or making me feel ashamed of what used to be the republican party  now the spineless trumplikins
1336328013181407232 2020-12-08 23:13:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not think so but it would probably have been the perfect excuse for her robot like behavior
1336327104258949127 2020-12-08 23:09:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The new repub trumplikins will assume you are thinking of democrats and agree.
1336326745461407753 2020-12-08 23:08:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To that I say, yummy

1336158464238874626 2020-12-08 11:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who can't like them?
1336149751771918337 2020-12-08 11:24:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not fast enough..so trying to decide peanut butter and jelly or huge bowl of icecream
1336146080954806279 2020-12-08 11:10:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thanks I like asking questions..and really appreciate when someone has answers üòå
1336144384312619010 2020-12-08 11:03:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I suspect a lot of what he does is a federal crime but who will do something?
1336137211398541313 2020-12-08 10:35:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have you looked at the latest numbers?

1336130592790941697 2020-12-08 10:08:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry that pig could not even be presidential enough to stand there for a few minutes. He probably hurried back to call PA and ask them to throw the election
1336130247675285504 2020-12-08 10:07:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If the guy has a physical problem ..imagine it being you. Why would anyone pick on something that can't be controlled. You guys all sound like trump
1336129881646780422 2020-12-08 10:06:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> someone asked lowlife trump about the Inauguration
1336129445590134784 2020-12-08 10:04:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donald is the shmuck that everyone thought he was yet they kept making excuses for
1336128873277366276 2020-12-08 10:02:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what an idiot he is..he must have been reading a tweet or something or someone said something he did not like..ah inauguration question. If you did not know before you know the sort of person he is  I am sorry he was that rude to you. Enjoy your medal
1336128273080791052 2020-12-08 09:59:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe the House speaker has not flipped out like someone we see that has
1336128076934238208 2020-12-08 09:58:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not care what color anyone is.. I care if qualified and not hired for color.
1336127895815794688 2020-12-08 09:58:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is insanity. Also illegal I think
1336124662523236354 2020-12-08 09:45:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Many more than he has said. Allegedly I am sure he changes numbers as trump does
1336124386223513601 2020-12-08 09:44:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like desantis is trumps governor. Wake up people
1336123796617650182 2020-12-08 09:41:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GovRonDeSantis  This is horrifying..no it is beyond horrifying..do you have any idea what you are doing? You owe her and her kids an apology.Or who the cult leader Jim Jones is? THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN AMERICA
1336106084872884227 2020-12-08 08:31:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry Jenna Jesus and religion has nothing to do with any of this. You are part of a cult..as was Jim Jones. Not religion just cult  https://t.co/Hqmk5uzge6 Learn about him and his cult.
1336105390375915521 2020-12-08 08:28:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Something needs to be done
1336105206921256961 2020-12-08 08:27:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not know who he is but if Biden and Harris picked him,..good enough for me
1336097138426736641 2020-12-08 07:55:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does he call himself a conservative? I call him anti american
1336097014141116426 2020-12-08 07:55:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good lord!!
1336096820603342853 2020-12-08 07:54:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you think he would do something to benefit the country not himself?
1336096714357415937 2020-12-08 07:54:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> starvation is always an option-no exaggeration for many
1336095921382322176 2020-12-08 07:51:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can tell you cant see me. Neither despair or fear..(so far) but thanks for the cheering up from the sad ..never give up..January be here before we know it and clean up can start
1336095574697922560 2020-12-08 07:49:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hydroxychloroquine better idea than something that works anyway
1336095432125059076 2020-12-08 07:49:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so you say..thanks for the laughs..good thing these days
1336095042545586177 2020-12-08 07:47:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> comic too?
1336093150281166850 2020-12-08 07:40:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at least half of the nation is better..but some are not..they are antiamerican and in the wrong country
1336093012749918211 2020-12-08 07:39:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do the people that follow and obey trump seriously think this is fine?
1336079271886991360 2020-12-08 06:44:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they hate everyone that does not look like them and do not fear him
1336078875554689026 2020-12-08 06:43:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden can have guards around the plane
1336078704854921216 2020-12-08 06:42:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can hope and now we can not discuss it any further
1336078565385887745 2020-12-08 06:42:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you ask?
1336078398268067841 2020-12-08 06:41:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Want to terrify the kids so they can hate cops because the cops invaded their house for doing the right thing? Telling the truth now gets Florida state police to invade your house?
1336077973024366596 2020-12-08 06:39:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did Florida cede from the US and move to hitler country? I think this would be against the law
1336077359733207042 2020-12-08 06:37:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shouldn't you call the doc and ask them? Feel better fast
1336059926368702464 2020-12-08 05:28:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So what would happen? Any charges wait until Biden is in ..or trump will forgive everyone
1336059653638283265 2020-12-08 05:26:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heard that trump compares this to a 3rd world country? Wonder how that happened
1336055424437653506 2020-12-08 05:10:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Apparently they do not know what they sound and look like ?? Why is the GOP allowing this?
1336055058572730369 2020-12-08 05:08:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just spoke to someone in GA we were talking I said you voting? He said ",Would I miss after last night? They made up my mind for me,  I wondered if she was a robot and her batteries were running out."
1336023372510224386 2020-12-08 03:02:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wondered about donald and now I wonder about Rudy.
1336023011158274049 2020-12-08 03:01:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I laugh at the raise. 20. a month and 1 tomato went from .87 tomato today it is 2.90 ..great raise
1336022435494182919 2020-12-08 02:59:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she so makes me sick..because of the way she flaunts it
1336009244555014148 2020-12-08 02:06:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOVE IT
1336009128683167745 2020-12-08 02:06:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why wait until noon? He gets paid til noon, should rescind anything outside of the white house before noon.
1336008589748662275 2020-12-08 02:04:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably exactly why it was done ..was another of those what can we do to tick off Americans..put in a tennis court of course
1336008377110028291 2020-12-08 02:03:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With a hot house, grow veggies and invite children to eat
1336008235581575168 2020-12-08 02:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but tennis court and what looks like a lovely building
1336007924242649090 2020-12-08 02:01:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrianKarem Hope the taxpayers are thrilled with the waste of money..particularly for the trumps use. Covid needs help, people need help, none of us need a tennis court.
1336003166819799042 2020-12-08 01:42:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @judgebatten You are wonderful The majority of this country thanks you
1336002600542613507 2020-12-08 01:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Birthday Luke. You seem bigger, smarter and cuter today than yesterday. üéÇ  Have a great 4th birthday ..hope you blow out all the candles on your cake today and all your wishes come true.
1336002078150438912 2020-12-08 01:38:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is why (s)he is the judge and I am not. I would not have been that polite
1336001753100247040 2020-12-08 01:36:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1335981591332577285 2020-12-08 00:16:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then winning a couple more times
1335981445756702720 2020-12-08 00:16:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is pathetic..#PearlHarborDay  and Covid 19 victims
1335981124003262465 2020-12-08 00:14:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice catch
1335980746029273093 2020-12-08 00:13:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is just plain cute and you have probably offended him by name calling
1335980379023548420 2020-12-08 00:11:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not care who it is but salute a statue? Glad that one is gone. Never was a good idea to salute him
1335969894450520069 2020-12-07 23:30:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump not likely @JoeBiden  will pay attention to wjat you do, he has better things to do as do his supporters. Hope you are paying for your own plane on the way out
1335969433156800512 2020-12-07 23:28:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She always struck me as phony like her husband. Has not changed.
1335969246661271564 2020-12-07 23:27:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am impressed to  know that judges are still Americans..really wonder about trump
1335968686373560320 2020-12-07 23:25:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow..@bobdylan  nice sale. Congratulations
1335966170009260033 2020-12-07 23:15:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Many people? That makes me feel better.
1335955725064036358 2020-12-07 22:34:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at the sick people, the bodies,the condition of this country. Should be self explanatory as to the question is this the best republicans have to offer?
1335954810902810624 2020-12-07 22:30:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You know he needs limelight ..if no one covers it only those there will know
1335954286581321728 2020-12-07 22:28:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious where Ivankas machines went?
1335939223443169282 2020-12-07 21:28:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Until last night, I never realized that answering the question " did someone win or lose an election"  with  a simple yes or no or no could cause such difficulties
1335938397186252806 2020-12-07 21:25:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not assume. Verify facts
1335938150548598787 2020-12-07 21:24:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Uh, he dies?
1335938060048101376 2020-12-07 21:23:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He would!!!
1335937806674374657 2020-12-07 21:22:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What a pleasure!!! I have no idea who many of the people are that @JoeBiden is nominating for various offices. The one thing I know is unlike trump &amp; people he put in office .I am not concerned, I know @PresElectJoeBiden will put in the most qualified people SUCH A RELIEF
1335919841178509313 2020-12-07 20:11:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôÑüò∑
1335919398167736321 2020-12-07 20:09:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He apparently has no brain cells left..guessing he goes where he is led and when told no need for masks, he believes it. I hope he has a speedy complete recovery. I have some sympathy. But, after recovery, I wish him a comfy cell with a locked door
1335918701326037000 2020-12-07 20:06:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÜüôÇüòÇ
1335917684375113728 2020-12-07 20:02:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guessing those there were  exposed not so much by meeting Rudy , more by, got exposed to Covid19  because those in attendance did not wear masks or keep a safe distance. Hope more people will be wearing masks
1335792862919856133 2020-12-07 11:46:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They fleeced billions so that is what is left?
1335792664835461125 2020-12-07 11:46:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They listen and obey donald
1335791914805833733 2020-12-07 11:43:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe she was being fed her paragraphs or you have paid attention to many conspiracy theories?
1335785039834079234 2020-12-07 11:15:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still he wears no mask..how bout showing everyone how you really feel donald? Oh wait. in this picture you are
1335784147818778626 2020-12-07 11:12:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Somehow I cannot imagine anyone staying mad as they bounce their way around the room.  Just hearing about it makes me laugh, particularly after seeing the video at the vets
1335783824580616192 2020-12-07 11:10:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope the phone number is the FBI or something
1335783675888345089 2020-12-07 11:10:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Something needs to be done. This is insane
1335783545307082753 2020-12-07 11:09:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all so obscene. I think we should ship all trumplikins and trump to some island where they can all be happy and live long lives without intruding on those not interested in their life style
1335783132801490946 2020-12-07 11:08:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do the words space cadet seem apt?
1335782771139219457 2020-12-07 11:06:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the seriousness of what he has done in the name of the president has finally hit home
1335782512509988864 2020-12-07 11:05:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Adorable and you say they dance, do they bounce? What will you do when you yell for them to stop screaming and they turn to you and say "no, YOU stop screaming"
1335781915840884738 2020-12-07 11:03:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we all learned he is a radical liberal (Kelley said so)  and I learned she is  a trumpbot..
1335781235675852800 2020-12-07 11:00:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> way to go..who needs masks?
1335781141811490818 2020-12-07 11:00:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I liked that line too
1335780598238113797 2020-12-07 10:58:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SandiAnthony1 @benphillips76 @gtconway3d Just so cute, do yours bounce up and down like that?
1335780265227132928 2020-12-07 10:56:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @benphillips76 @jp_in_nj
1335780098310430721 2020-12-07 10:56:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG this is precious
1335779944564215810 2020-12-07 10:55:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just a happy to be alive day.
1335757856788852740 2020-12-07 09:27:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would think so
1335756515362353152 2020-12-07 09:22:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  when do you say PUT ON A MASK, 6 FT DISTANCE, WASH HANDS..when do you say it and maybe save lives
1335752744817340416 2020-12-07 09:07:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Duh ..She looks like she has been drugged and that was why so  repetitive
1335751415726215168 2020-12-07 09:02:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shows who she is committed too, as did her few responses to a variety of questions
1335751216941457416 2020-12-07 09:01:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And that is pathetic
1335750636349100037 2020-12-07 08:59:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> while she was interested in images &amp; pictures she tried to create against Warnock, reminded me of trumps way of attacking
1335750635308847108 2020-12-07 08:59:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Loeffler was repeating exactly her same 4 or 5 paragraphs over &amp; over. I do not agree with everything Warnock said, but he seemingly told the truth, answered most questions &amp; was interested in programs&amp; plans
1335745386435272705 2020-12-07 08:38:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @KellyLoeffler  you struck me as a fake with a primary interest in yourself and others like you.
1335744798247047168 2020-12-07 08:35:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòå
1335744122083270657 2020-12-07 08:33:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> TRUMP with her refusal to stand up and use her own brain. She brings everything to personal not to  her plans, just to Warnock.
1335744121059880966 2020-12-07 08:33:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Radical left..how many times have I heard this tonight? Thanks, now that I have heard it, if I lived there I would vote Warnock . She was too busy putting on labels and trying to create images..she created an image of
1335736039705616386 2020-12-07 08:01:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wont even feel a little guilty but will be proud of himself..his brain is as tiny as his hands and his heart is smaller
1335735015938920449 2020-12-07 07:56:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry. Hope you both feel better quickly...
1335734629580627968 2020-12-07 07:55:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Once he is out of office can we speak about who the real traitor is?
1335734348914548739 2020-12-07 07:54:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not forget your humanity or u be no better than donald
1335734237408976898 2020-12-07 07:53:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not laughing don't wish that agony on anyone..even those too stupid to wear a mask as a result of turning a disease and masks into politics. I wish rudy a speedy complete recovery
1335733716031827969 2020-12-07 07:51:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump had such a cruel bunch..hope they never slept
1335686937252859917 2020-12-07 04:45:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LaraLeaTrump  More likely @BrianKempGA  owes quid pro quo to the Constitution not the pres.

1335685480579555331 2020-12-07 04:40:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> SO CUTE!!!!
1335685287142432775 2020-12-07 04:39:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sanitize and fumigate is my message
1335684707942604802 2020-12-07 04:37:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry I think the world is crazy enough now without decriminalizing since who knows what is next.
1335669875264643077 2020-12-07 03:38:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish people would just not pay attention to any of them..but that is me
1335656538627858436 2020-12-07 02:45:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I guess saying it is not over is more proof that trump cannot deal with reality..or does not want too @kevinsorbo  trump lost you can practice dealing with reality yourself.
1335635209052692489 2020-12-07 01:20:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is just an idiot the best thing is not to give him any air
1335634604464762881 2020-12-07 01:17:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry üôèüò¢ Prayers for you all
1335634166529073153 2020-12-07 01:16:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just need more pictures of covid wards..not just numbers. Have to appear on all social media channels  and all tv channels. It is easy to ignore or disbelieve if you do not see people and just hear numbers
1335614635970596866 2020-12-06 23:58:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those are adults?
1335611127586299909 2020-12-06 23:44:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I know it is not a typo but sure seemed Trump was talking about himself?
1335590025812127747 2020-12-06 22:20:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Surprised they got 2 minutes

1335413261773271042 2020-12-06 10:38:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JudgeJeanine  are you slowly realizing who and what you have been supporting and you have been brainwashed?
1335412861666021377 2020-12-06 10:36:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should we be thankful he has stopped discussing Hilary and Obama?
1335412683785506816 2020-12-06 10:36:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JudgeJeanine why not discuss donald instead of Barr who just did his job. Donald is not the leader why dont you speak about him and all the "alleged" frauds he has perpetrated on this country,  the Constitution and the people.
1335410332597186566 2020-12-06 10:26:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not donate to trump he pockets most of the money..
1335410257514946560 2020-12-06 10:26:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the date and archived? this is so over the top
1335409558555123713 2020-12-06 10:23:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not listen did not hear..just want him gone
1335409410647224320 2020-12-06 10:23:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not just killing the GOP where have you been? He is killing the country, and its people
1335409225376391173 2020-12-06 10:22:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is fund raising. Any money donated to his pac is spending money for him. So he whines, he cries, and socks away millions all for him after a f ew minor bills
1335407602310795265 2020-12-06 10:15:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That kid is so darn adorable
1335403729537929218 2020-12-06 10:00:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does what he has been doing all along that so many tend to overlook
1335403352012820482 2020-12-06 09:59:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This has gone on way to long..now trump pressuring the governor to toss an election is not legal
1335401646612942849 2020-12-06 09:52:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Extremely
1335401519210967040 2020-12-06 09:51:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't take watching him  He used to annoy me but I could tolerate him, now If I see his ad i have to turn it off. I get pictures in my head of trump and wonder if he lies like trump does.. Won't buy or try his pillow
1335383563953434625 2020-12-06 08:40:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump still doing his lying poor me routine..making money no doubt ...to support himself ..I liked his comment he will go take a vacation for a couple guys.. this from a guy who spent more time golfing then he did anything else.
1335383051476606977 2020-12-06 08:38:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only ones caught cheating were republicans ..missing ballot boxes come to mind..
1335382858886770691 2020-12-06 08:37:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> had to turn it on election not rigged just trump wants you to believe it..he cheats and he lies
1335382598529540096 2020-12-06 08:36:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope his "fans" realize he has lost and the senators also pay the price for the dirty tricks he and they have done by aiding and abetting it all
1335382056872906752 2020-12-06 08:34:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad the fox news journalists are getting what they deserve. hope trump is getting his scare of verbal abuse too
1335381793344720899 2020-12-06 08:33:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what was their reaction? hope they booed and not cheered
1335349739479584769 2020-12-06 06:26:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How is so much of what he does legal? Easy he is his own god and feels he can create his own rules. Constitution? what is that?
1335349451829940225 2020-12-06 06:24:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump    He is boring he is groveling, he is desperate and with all going on in the world , we are fed up with your loss being the only problem you admit too. YOU LOST DONALD. WE KNOW YOU LOST AND WE ARE TIRED OF IT and your SELFPITY TO RAISE MONEY. SHUT IT AND GO PACK
1335347117842452488 2020-12-06 06:15:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I left republicans long ago just for the changes republicans were making..even when trump gone will be the same behaviors..hope @MeidasTouch will still be sticking around
1335338811824496644 2020-12-06 05:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and too lazy to check out for himself..like every other bit of dirty work he calls on others to do it for him

1335337678502498304 2020-12-06 05:38:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just look at all trump has done and we know who the cheat would be
1335337572399276032 2020-12-06 05:37:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are they really all that afraid to speak up?
1335330482272296962 2020-12-06 05:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly you are right. trump does not scare me as much as his followers
1335330383823597569 2020-12-06 05:09:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they will at some point run for reelection
1335329472413900802 2020-12-06 05:05:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  You have no right to demand anything.  You have no right to bully, if they are still stupid enough to obey you i guess they can watch you bully them too but most know you are leaving mid January and I think they have had their fill of you
1335314951699836930 2020-12-06 04:07:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So..choice between vaccine and possibility of losing life or erectile dysfunction?  Think I know what I would pick
1335313956215328780 2020-12-06 04:03:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GovKemp   tell donald dingbat to go away..stop letting him stomp on you or even make headlines off of you
1335308725238849537 2020-12-06 03:43:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CarlFmd My general feeling is the same but  I would add a psych eval to anyone running, except Biden we see he is fine..can't be a question
1335307968166965250 2020-12-06 03:40:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he can call it a win..sigh
1335307840655863810 2020-12-06 03:39:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Most of the time they do and if you speak with them, you learn that quickly
1335306559677747207 2020-12-06 03:34:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probably truth
1335300958742568960 2020-12-06 03:12:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope stays mild.. when all is said and done,remember,most people are a range of fine.
1335300248256831489 2020-12-06 03:09:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most republicans seem to think they do not need masks..so I guess the dems are still taking care of them and ourselves
1335299853191163906 2020-12-06 03:07:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so perdue took a page from trumps handbook
1335299333923729411 2020-12-06 03:05:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would be nice if these people would look in the mirror. Does this guy really believe that mask will protect anyone?
1335298991068770306 2020-12-06 03:04:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would be happy if people just behaved like people not animals

1335284363995516928 2020-12-06 02:06:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thinking I do ..but first have to know what she did then see proof..just being daddies little girl does not do it
1335271157835177984 2020-12-06 01:13:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You now have control of your own brain.

1335044978410745856 2020-12-05 10:15:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden can outsmart trump anyday
1335044871468539904 2020-12-05 10:14:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh is that why trump would not let Bidens people meet? They can run back to trump and squeal?  No wonder trump worries about spies..he is one and sending others to try to do same
1335044412729143297 2020-12-05 10:12:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What the hell is this? Sure G-d has nothing better to do than want a whining. lying, conniving (alleged) thieving overgrown baby who never learned the word no as president
1335043924210094083 2020-12-05 10:10:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that disgust I see in Kelleys face? where was it long ago

1335042337601429505 2020-12-05 10:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would we be surprised?
1335040192407859202 2020-12-05 09:56:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is despicable
1335036705762635776 2020-12-05 09:42:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mitch trump and barr unholy triumvirate ..but apparently barr did have limits
1335036354246356998 2020-12-05 09:40:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Once it is decreed safe will because it wont go away unless we all join together..besides it has been close to a year since I hugged my children or grandchildren.
1335035717983096833 2020-12-05 09:38:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is a court decision but perhaps they decided enough of trumps revenge because it was no reason to make court decisions that affect others
1335034767725780992 2020-12-05 09:34:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better late than never..how many lies later?
1335029267495874562 2020-12-05 09:12:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> makes one wonder what they are hiding  or what trump is hiding
1335022431740850176 2020-12-05 08:45:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Observant and astute. Did not just give up. He did that for the first time back when he first learned about it and went rallying, lying and golfing.
1335018243195625476 2020-12-05 08:28:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Comes a time to stop. He knows he lost, he just does not want anyone to know he knows. But, still time to stop or you are just bullying just like him
1334948912122228737 2020-12-05 03:53:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Far as I know this should help   https://t.co/oNkGfZImBt

1334947167778304001 2020-12-05 03:46:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry anyone voted for it. I look around at the state of this country and am positive marijuana is somehow involved and leads to other drugs
1334946830682107908 2020-12-05 03:45:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot wait until any and all receive their comeuppances

1334916988402098176 2020-12-05 01:46:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is so disgraceful
1334916801474551808 2020-12-05 01:45:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you get there on time for the vote?
1334858985242025986 2020-12-04 21:55:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> welcome back.
1334848126738436113 2020-12-04 21:12:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Some are, most are not
1334847937889918977 2020-12-04 21:12:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We see it is about you, your biases and assumptions..maybe what you do not understand is you are new and should be the last to speak even if you are 100% correct about everything. You should be listening not just to your constituents but what you can learn in those halls
1334846938034925568 2020-12-04 21:08:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice to know there is a line AG Barr won't cross. Pathetic that apparently there is no line for trump
1334706677405376515 2020-12-04 11:50:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and to that I say..who cares?
1334705953221042180 2020-12-04 11:47:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is no one trying to use the 25th amendment..other than he could use it as defense for criminal charges
1334705770731098114 2020-12-04 11:47:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We cannot think we are "so damn screwed" or there is no coming back. Just need some patience and follow guidelines then we will see improvement
1334705422985551873 2020-12-04 11:45:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this madness cannot be avoided because it has been mad since trump took office
1334667524177354753 2020-12-04 09:15:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1334651733226774529 2020-12-04 08:12:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If this is the most important speech, guess he is admitting he had nothing much to contribute in 4 yrs
1334650766217318400 2020-12-04 08:08:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope it is not most, just some humoring him
1334650326339743749 2020-12-04 08:06:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at the child in this picture..why did people let him get elected?
1334650159045742592 2020-12-04 08:06:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does trump play a flute with his followers..starting with Guiliani and then pence lining up behind guiliani and then on and on the list goes as they  ..step in time to the flute? Pied Piper taking mice and rats out of white house?
1334645793949700105 2020-12-04 07:48:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would seem Biden should be the person names who is who
1334641269990191107 2020-12-04 07:30:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did he mention if saw them get out of their graves?
1334641113836236801 2020-12-04 07:30:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because he does not care about them he cares about him and his money that will allow him to live in the style to which he is accustomed as his followers try to figure out where to get food from ..HE DOES NOT CARE
1334640343971733505 2020-12-04 07:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would it be anything else? he still does not know election is over either
1334639940085420035 2020-12-04 07:25:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could it be he will use insanity in court and this is part of that plea
1334639811244797952 2020-12-04 07:25:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> truly is sad, he needs a medical escort out
1334639636132601858 2020-12-04 07:24:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL did not know she was there..wish her well..she should have left earlier if for nothing else than to save her reputation

1334619405913907205 2020-12-04 06:03:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we knew DeSantis was trumps puppy..no surprise

1334606906086846466 2020-12-04 05:14:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and defund means you cant change the true factual definition because you want too

1334566399281401862 2020-12-04 02:33:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been embarrassing for years..trumps lawsuits just make it worse and his carryings on just make it more third world
1334566180493926401 2020-12-04 02:32:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> knowing trump mentality..wall is probably garbage anyway
1334566035203166208 2020-12-04 02:31:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Punishment for not electing trump? Wonder when it will dawn on them how far they have dropped and how unamerican they seem
1334543483269419009 2020-12-04 01:02:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better not to give him any appearance on anything..friend or foe..NOTHING
1334542557439807489 2020-12-04 00:58:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only good thing is trump must be happy. Hope someone is counting the sick with covid since so many places are running out of beds and caretakers. January cant get here fast enough
1334542260218761218 2020-12-04 00:57:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oops what a sentence this was.
1334541191753429002 2020-12-04 00:53:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so, how is the covid doing in California churches?
1334540888828243968 2020-12-04 00:51:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was supposed to be include the link for someone else who is a she and does not understand the meaning of the word defund sorry
1334540216967815171 2020-12-04 00:49:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you give the rest of the details? This is not politics it is facts and facts do not know party. They could know right from wrong though
1334540006933868546 2020-12-04 00:48:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What really happened does not enter into it..a trump through and through
1334510144286240775 2020-12-03 22:49:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC       Are you waking up to what you have been part of?  Or just another political ploy?
1334510027848159235 2020-12-03 22:49:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC       Are you waking up to what you have been part of?  Or just another political ploy?
1334509692501037057 2020-12-03 22:47:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To give that vaccine trumps name is offensive..besides which, trump will be flattered. Please rethink your position
1334509177478254593 2020-12-03 22:45:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you named the virus for him, he would be honored
1334508966425092100 2020-12-03 22:45:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THAT would be patriotic and American

1334508339628298252 2020-12-03 22:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you have a most marvelous day.
1334507401144365059 2020-12-03 22:38:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Honestly think she has no idea what "defund "means
1334506133277593602 2020-12-03 22:33:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @lsarsour You are trying to  put the police out of business and you want to demand?  To defund the police is to take their money away.
1334505193082380297 2020-12-03 22:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindaSarsour Obama said more was spent on police? Look at crime statistics. When there is crime, police are needed However, more of that money should be spent on educating the police and/or provide support for the police  who can accompany
1334339997978292227 2020-12-03 11:33:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I truly do not believe she knows what it means
1334339812086718468 2020-12-03 11:32:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would you defund the police? Maybe we need your definition of defund so we can understand..because using the real definition of defunding is a really really bad idea
1334339450478997504 2020-12-03 11:31:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If she did she should
1334331700848046081 2020-12-03 11:00:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have the same problem..how can someone know and not say? How can someone know and let it spread. How can someone know masks keep spread down and then rally in huge crowds and not at least say "wear a mask" Can't forgive it
1334331205727248385 2020-12-03 10:58:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lot of other channels to choose from..that is what I have done tonight.
1334319707336413184 2020-12-03 10:13:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more shocking his is followers falling right into line behind him
1334308897318899713 2020-12-03 09:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why am i not shocked
1334301038015373318 2020-12-03 08:58:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump wants you to listen to his lies &amp; blames everyone else, then hawks for money that you think is going one place but in reality part will pay some bills but the majority  is his to do with as he pleases..like live on it. . Remember he has been a scammer for years. no change
1334299755179106308 2020-12-03 08:53:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> luv that pose ..seems to be party of trump and Jesus
1334299389502889986 2020-12-03 08:52:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> these people cannot understand any reality except their own
1334298603695861762 2020-12-03 08:49:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps party is the party of authoritarianism
1334297546588557317 2020-12-03 08:44:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree but when you are trump, you associate with others like you..so do not know any different. Don't misunderstand,  I am in favor of their being punished if found guilty of anything
1334283559713042433 2020-12-03 07:49:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are entitled to your opinion too :)
1334283341777006592 2020-12-03 07:48:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they get what their father deserves ..not saying they should get off scott free..saying they cant know they did wrong because no one said no or you are doing wrong..they still need to be punished, just not as severely as their father
1334282880462315523 2020-12-03 07:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do feel sorry for them..this is how they have lived their lives and if they do not know better, they cannot do better.
1334282511535509504 2020-12-03 07:45:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Discuss it with their father he is the one who put them through all of this
1334282286871834627 2020-12-03 07:44:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> idiots just another gift from the trump administration
1334282100619554817 2020-12-03 07:43:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just more of trumps own doing
1334281655150899202 2020-12-03 07:41:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does it just occur to him that this is real?
1334281521872695297 2020-12-03 07:41:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so many of all sorts
1334281432253026304 2020-12-03 07:40:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hear her..she is one step closer than she was 1 step ago and  she keeps coming
1334281077905567748 2020-12-03 07:39:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not have to do anything except keep opening his mouth. Same as always No need to blame everyone else.
1334280818785738753 2020-12-03 07:38:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fools we knew that and if u were not such boot lickers you would have understood that before 270,000 lives were lost. Hope you wear your masks
1334279818167410688 2020-12-03 07:34:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry you guys have to go through this..just remember they are the minority not majority and if they could think for themselves they would not be supporting trump.
1334265660055154689 2020-12-03 06:38:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TeresaCCarter2 very fine people..think he meant fine animals

1334264501336727561 2020-12-03 06:33:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could it be it is finally occurring to people that DT is a lying sack who is not worthy of that office and...the election is over, he is done
1334264135895429125 2020-12-03 06:32:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôÑ
1334263949949362180 2020-12-03 06:31:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think it should be recounted and I wish Sara Hart well
1334263157993463810 2020-12-03 06:28:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden I  have been listening to people in various organizations say people  should be in certain appointments because of their color..what about filling a position because of competence and qualifications? No one should allow anything but qualifications &amp; abilities
1334261972964085763 2020-12-03 06:23:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gees
1334258981720743944 2020-12-03 06:11:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not know he is a scientist..but is same as a virus
1334258373949353987 2020-12-03 06:09:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anyone that cant tell the difference between lies and facts deserves what they get from him
1334257271363280904 2020-12-03 06:04:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now that you mention it, he will pay more attention
1334256989409566727 2020-12-03 06:03:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pathetic
1334256853946150912 2020-12-03 06:03:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We used to have presidents with scruples and morals and now we have trump
1334256662207721479 2020-12-03 06:02:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is not only the sorest loser but also biggest liar..wish they would take him off of here and let him whine somewhere else
1334256114330968064 2020-12-03 06:00:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if all his little gremlins all got smart and stopped sending him money if he would continue this nonsense
1334224624595439623 2020-12-03 03:55:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think some relaxation
1334224449881640966 2020-12-03 03:54:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It will only get worse for a while PEOPLE STILL NEED MASKS even with vaccines coming out
1334210577166704644 2020-12-03 02:59:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> real republicans care..trumplikins do not
1334208404747923459 2020-12-03 02:50:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just wish kayleigh would go away
1334208099729682442 2020-12-03 02:49:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should say unforgivable unless it is danger to life or limb if information released
1334207419598168068 2020-12-03 02:46:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have no doubt there is  a lot trump holds over heads..so they are terrified..what bothers me is they put trump before country. that is unforgivable
1334206873810120708 2020-12-03 02:44:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will be gone soon. remember this is trumps last medal of freedom. We can capitalize it when Biden awards it.
1334158509336879105 2020-12-02 23:32:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JanekKayley Can only hope once he is out of office for a couple weeks they will regain their sanity. Ever ask them what trump has done to make him next best thing to God?
1334157398639075328 2020-12-02 23:28:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good reason some should not be allowed to multiply. Their children pay the cost
1334156952457383936 2020-12-02 23:26:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hey genius, try to understand, masks need to be worn by everyone.Those who had no thought of anyone besides themselves  also needed to wear them.  They were and are the biggest spreaders  That is why it got this big.
1334155284307193856 2020-12-02 23:19:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It says he knew he was leading his children down the wrong road, thinking he was a good father,(or knowing one day his kids will realize what he did to them and how little he thought of them) he did it anyway and now  wants them pardoned

1334153418693357568 2020-12-02 23:12:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or they are supposed too
1334151773112692739 2020-12-02 23:05:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/sdYo7033y9
1334151540924440577 2020-12-02 23:04:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only thing wrong with that is ..should not use Malia and Sashas name in same breath or tweet with that other name.
1333971163769434122 2020-12-02 11:08:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What really amazes me is he looked into pardons for them which means he knew before he got them involved in anything and still did it. Disgusting human
1333958293757308936 2020-12-02 10:16:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe you should reread what trump has done.  To me Tanden is telling her truth. The same as you tell yours, donald tells his..Not bad judgement ..am guessing she is observant. we  know that you do not believe her but you buy trumps nonsense. THAT is a judgment issue &amp; concerning
1333956818696089601 2020-12-02 10:11:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have no doubt there are enough reasons for impeachment that is just one more
1333956635363045376 2020-12-02 10:10:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Somehow that makes sense to me. If we need to choose between money or lives. the lives and people win
1333956362611675137 2020-12-02 10:09:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With everything these people have done..how the heck can you keep track?
1333956162602082304 2020-12-02 10:08:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably so small he could crawl under a worm
1333955959778140167 2020-12-02 10:07:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> unless he and trump cooked up another scheme so barr would stay in good graces..I hope he is fired. Will say he is not as corrupt as i imagine he is
1333955695197249536 2020-12-02 10:06:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> each time I think he cant make me feel sicker..he does
1333955571343618051 2020-12-02 10:06:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still cant believe he knew he was involving his own kids in what could be and apparently is highly illegal..(or why would he look into pardons) and did it anyway. what a father what a president what a guy
1333955171475451904 2020-12-02 10:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> by the time mcconnell is up for reelection again people will get wise to him..guess his supporters are as thick as trump supporters
1333954699284914178 2020-12-02 10:02:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidTheNonBot he is pathetic..he is playing his supporters for being suckers and he is using them same as he uses anyone else
1333952945319272451 2020-12-02 09:55:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee sorry. Does she say anything of value?
1333952746165317632 2020-12-02 09:54:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What claims to fame lol hope he is proud of himself..he loves his kids so much he gave this legacy to him and his progeny. What a guy
1333916027583950854 2020-12-02 07:28:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh I love that..infestation is perfect and I can't wait for them to go
1333915729364709377 2020-12-02 07:27:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Truth hurts uh Justin? Facts not your friend
1333915480160149505 2020-12-02 07:26:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Higher the votes go, so much better it feels
1333915244096319488 2020-12-02 07:25:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they would need trump to say no fraud and he is finding it to profitable to say that
1333915117361246208 2020-12-02 07:25:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is not barr who is the snake
1333914865996533762 2020-12-02 07:24:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone that stands up for truth should be applauded not insulted or vilified. trump raises money each time you people blame someone like barr and donate to trump. So far over 170 million dollars to do whatever he wishes because his cult supports him
1333912781125509121 2020-12-02 07:16:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Talk to us Ron show us your citizenship papers. Do you still have them?
1333912603861643264 2020-12-02 07:15:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if he still has a job
1333912513499566081 2020-12-02 07:15:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PressSec  @realDonaldTrump you both tell and ask a lot of stupid questions and make a lot of stupid comments..particularly when you want to change the focus of attention. you have no room to discuss others ..fingers point back at you
1333911402109685761 2020-12-02 07:10:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am impressed with Gabriel Sterling.  It went too far a while back..now just further. Thank you for speaking up. It takes courage, honesty &amp; patriotism. What has happened to this country because of donald &amp; his lack of scruples &amp; morals is beyond me. Been angry for a long time.
1333909638497132550 2020-12-02 07:03:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC how can you be so antiamerican? What has happened to you? Wrong is ok as long as it is for trump? What has he got on you
1333909392912211968 2020-12-02 07:02:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How bout the nazi collective?
1333897944370712577 2020-12-02 06:17:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry to break this to you..no deep state. Gad use your brains..go fact check
1333897754343518210 2020-12-02 06:16:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If this were not so pathetically sad and scary, these fools would be laughable.
1333897516396523521 2020-12-02 06:15:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How ignorant these people are. When he agreed with trump and coverd trumps arse he was fine. Now he decided enough is enough, stands up &amp;declares truth. You fools can 't handle it? Is it all good until truth? Barr who was known as trumps lawyer..not how the the AG should be known
1333896734767017984 2020-12-02 06:12:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shut up and climb back under the woodwork. Ask yourself, why are you doing this?  You know trump lost
1333884817054851074 2020-12-02 05:24:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Facts are what is needed..you help trump to attempt to throw over this gov and make it acceptable. Do not blame the weakminded then try to justify it
1333884815591018496 2020-12-02 05:24:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You and rudy are just fascinating..so you think to support trump you should support no facts? This is the cumulative reason you and trump feed gruel and teach them it is acceptable. You do not say not acceptable.
1333875823095451656 2020-12-02 04:49:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1333875707060039685 2020-12-02 04:48:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when they continue their  investigation into the truth..hope they mean the facts and will stop inventing their own ..democracy won not trumps attempts..it is time for this to stop
1333868954717196290 2020-12-02 04:21:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am shocked at health care workers in NY on strike. I support their strike but sure not their timing
1333868479095640067 2020-12-02 04:20:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe just nazis would do it
1333868159351263239 2020-12-02 04:18:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is absolutely amazing.  not that he found nothing but he told truth
1333867022103535620 2020-12-02 04:14:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or white supremacist skin heads
1333866583404539904 2020-12-02 04:12:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A.G. Barr congrats on the big boy pants
1333866504987815939 2020-12-02 04:12:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad he was honest enough to say it
1333866363958464512 2020-12-02 04:11:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that would be great and yes he has..and that way everyone would know who and what they are
1333863380944293890 2020-12-02 03:59:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We are all waiting Joe Pres Elect
1333863179026391045 2020-12-02 03:58:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess trump will have his share of nasty to say about Barr
1333863017814126593 2020-12-02 03:58:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Goodness, sometimes Barr can do the right thing
1333851767713505280 2020-12-02 03:13:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They did not vote for Republicans they voted for trump
1333846217781112833 2020-12-02 02:51:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering if he thinks he will be admired for that idea by anyone other than dingbat donnie and his groupies
1333845997613690880 2020-12-02 02:50:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yet another little bit of insanity
1333845430631796739 2020-12-02 02:48:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They have invented an insane world..it will stand rightside up again no thanks to any of the trumplikins..they do not get this is why and how @JoeBiden  was elected. WE ARE TIRED OF ALL OF THIS
1333836054403674114 2020-12-02 02:11:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> HURRY HURRY
1333817641451053056 2020-12-02 00:58:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not say Ohio state trumplkins  want to impeach since obviously not republican. Republicans appreciate the law,  respecting and looking after each other . trumplikins look after themselves and votes no one else.
1333810216417320962 2020-12-02 00:28:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sigh when do you put Country before trump?
1333809331276570631 2020-12-02 00:25:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If classified what are you doing on twitter about any of it
1333802432497741827 2020-12-01 23:57:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe Andrea Mitchell  does not understand the word forthcoming
1333802192441020427 2020-12-01 23:56:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks very well put together and sincere
1333802001918947328 2020-12-01 23:55:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the writer of that post is the one not to trust
1333801795429167108 2020-12-01 23:55:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol
1333801707243925508 2020-12-01 23:54:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Packing his bags moving to russia?
1333801374778155009 2020-12-01 23:53:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lost touch with reality or playing star of his own reality show..I would say reality show. He feels entitled
1333776836413829121 2020-12-01 22:15:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üíîüôè
1333776546293833731 2020-12-01 22:14:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My prediction is they are not republicans if they vote against Biden nominees. They are owned by donald and his private party and people need to pay attention when the next election rolls around
1333775346357981184 2020-12-01 22:09:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't imagine any "real church" saying come inside where covid runs rampant and pray
1333775015490310144 2020-12-01 22:08:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Birthday..you were just lucky I guess
1333774887446573056 2020-12-01 22:08:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JohnCornyn   Where was the transparency in trumps government?  Saying it is transparent does not make it so.  Good excuse to not support @JoeBiden just not good for the country. This is supposed to be getting USA back to a good place. We are not in a good place now. Notice?
1333771911952797697 2020-12-01 21:56:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is this humor? Personally I do not like govt officials using twitter for govt business..but this is not the govt. But Republicans do not like use of twitter? UH is this humor?
1333596604163641344 2020-12-01 10:19:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We still do not know that to be fact. Yes it is scheduled to run out but with some laws changed it can probably be prevented without a serious cut. (Like raising taxes of the richest and budget and  divert funds to SS has to be honest way to do it without stealing )
1333586221067608065 2020-12-01 09:38:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good luck now maybe you can stick with the type medicine you know and mr pillow will go back to making pillows
1333585984672452609 2020-12-01 09:37:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More the merrier
1333585878971801600 2020-12-01 09:37:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All this winning must feel wonderful. I do not see any trump tweets,it feels so good
1333577803070132226 2020-12-01 09:04:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank goodness!!!
1333577537876844544 2020-12-01 09:03:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be crime for trump and joe digenova
1333577315582963712 2020-12-01 09:03:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump and his attorney just proved the election was as safe and secure as Krebs said. Now the question is what should be the sentence for wanting to execute someone for telling the truth
1333576040459931648 2020-12-01 08:57:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He probably already has but we do not see it
1333571263571374082 2020-12-01 08:39:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Kushner was raised to fit in with the trumps
1333571083035881472 2020-12-01 08:38:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely he will believe it is as bad as people say. I am thinking he needs to go to a Covid ward . Let him see it
1333560783691722752 2020-12-01 07:57:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We all got on a huge  conference call across the country and plotted and planned this conspiracy
1333560294803697666 2020-12-01 07:55:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She speaks well of you
1333560205817352193 2020-12-01 07:55:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @donaldtrumpjr anything or because u make it sound like you think it is everyone elses fault just like daddy
1333560204143841280 2020-12-01 07:55:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he held rallies. Jr  stop defending your father too much is indefensible..and the ELECTION IS OVER DADDY LOST I truly am sorry fo r you , being raised as you were u do not know the difference but if you did you would realize you just make yourself sound bad for either not saying
1333559954150666240 2020-12-01 07:54:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As president your daddy lied from the start to his people at home. Does not matter if china lied or told truth. DADDY DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH We are one in the world in deaths and cases of covid cause your daddy lied and then did not tell people to wear masks and
1333553590821134336 2020-12-01 07:28:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is it rumor that you will avoid cutting social security?
1333540490990510080 2020-12-01 06:36:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just prime example. maybe trump fan wants to be found so he put in his phone number to help you. DUH
1333539833130659845 2020-12-01 06:34:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What a great example of why trump supporters are a cult short on brains and vocabulary but big on mouths. Guess u do not even pay attention to how ignorant you seem. Wonder..are you drunk or stupid? or both
1333539330728595470 2020-12-01 06:32:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they do not check what he says &amp; do not know he lied all the way though or that covid is killing so many &amp; hurting millions more..that is why stand with him they are too ignorant to use their brains..there is so much they need to know . THE ELECTION IS OVER leave democracy alone
1333538332157030401 2020-12-01 06:28:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waving to you as the swamp gets drained..Do not let the drain hit you for the swamp on your way out
1333530540885078024 2020-12-01 05:57:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondered same thing
1333529938406895616 2020-12-01 05:54:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TerrenceMcNulty @JoeBiden be aware you will be giving control back to the repubs again ..how has it worked for you before ..what is it about both of them that bothers you? Tho, I can guess
1333499145756286977 2020-12-01 03:52:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For example 1 tomato now 3.75. was .97 about 6 months ago. Will be interesting
1333493484414701569 2020-12-01 03:29:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @reclaimthefight @SandiAnthony1 My concern is a 20.00 "raise" in 2021 but that "raise" is  more than eaten up by rising prices in groceries.
1333480653241917442 2020-12-01 02:38:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am Jewish and would have treated him but do understand that feeling. Thank you Dr Nichols you most assuredly are okay
1333479896815972366 2020-12-01 02:35:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are all in my thoughts and prayersüò∑üôè
1333479618876157952 2020-12-01 02:34:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are not just a doctor, you are a human being.  I would guess the mantra kicked in and you still did all you could do. So maybe you are okay
1333478533549658112 2020-12-01 02:30:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @FoxNews @foxandfriends  why do you all encourage this?
1333477706688761858 2020-12-01 02:27:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and ask questions
1333460460469936131 2020-12-01 01:18:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice wall..does that mean cheaper materials and another way for trump to cut corners and pad pockets?
1333460047251304448 2020-12-01 01:17:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have no doubt that @JoeBiden will restore it to former beauty as OUR house of the people no longer trump castle
1333459639124582415 2020-12-01 01:15:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joncoopertweets thanks for the correction. I thought new was only about 15 miles..sure wonder where the money went?
1333459174013931521 2020-12-01 01:13:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good move Gov
1333459025413992448 2020-12-01 01:13:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> traitor if he does not call the election fair
1333458448650997765 2020-12-01 01:10:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> love it
1333458196413943808 2020-12-01 01:09:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> among his other reasons
1333458115237453825 2020-12-01 01:09:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heartbreaking
1333452372740333568 2020-12-01 00:46:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think I would probably curtsy and burst out laughing
1333439538081959941 2020-11-30 23:55:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Part that strikes me as funniest is that there is a pandemic going on, affecting many and killing hundreds of thousands. They want us to ignore that  so we can die or get really sick to vote and the GOP (or party of trump)  can win?
1333438942209859584 2020-11-30 23:53:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was beginning to think that their attempts to create an authoritarian government would never stop. Thank goodness it is done
1333438173976915972 2020-11-30 23:50:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not aware yet that the election is done and Biden is President elect. This is what happens when no one has said no to him for his lifetime. Reality is difficult
1333437779817226247 2020-11-30 23:48:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump firing Krebs just added credence to what  Chris Krebs said.
1333437194900549637 2020-11-30 23:46:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ainsleyearhardt       Not mail in ballots, it is what the candidate represents &amp; it is also people  like yourself that seem to be echoing donald, not fact
1333437193403109376 2020-11-30 23:46:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not occur to @ainsleyearhardt that perhaps republicans should overhaul what they should stand for? Like country first, no dictators maybe that would allow for future republican presidents.
1333398096009637889 2020-11-30 21:10:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CaptMarkKelly  best wishes.
1333397881592688640 2020-11-30 21:10:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I tend to ignore Bernie and his followers.they sound like trumps followers..one bad as other
1333257898319892482 2020-11-30 11:53:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no offense but do not misuse the flag
1333257644941987840 2020-11-30 11:52:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish he cared
1333257219438161920 2020-11-30 11:51:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perfectly well said
1333256130580058114 2020-11-30 11:46:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not so sure ..remember donald kept Covid 19 to himself  and when told public said flu  no big deal. That would qualify as pretty selfish and depraved. Be tossup I think
1333251384045690881 2020-11-30 11:27:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü¶â
1333239362323156994 2020-11-30 10:40:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So disgusted
1333238485109641216 2020-11-30 10:36:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That would be so exciting and such happy news
1333237834187235328 2020-11-30 10:34:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad he plays with the dog..sorry he got hurt. He needs to sit that dog down and do some serious talking to him
1333237137240633346 2020-11-30 10:31:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bill Barr got stuck in a ballot box
1333225794978635776 2020-11-30 09:46:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry.
1333225086862680066 2020-11-30 09:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RandPaul  guess you too can believe everything trump drills into your head
1333211682257195010 2020-11-30 08:50:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O my @JoeBiden  hurry up heal that foot and tell your dog to refrain from doing it again
1333210713729413122 2020-11-30 08:46:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If trump is doing what trump has always done and his cult and or republicans are donating without facts ...i have run out of sympathy they deserve what they get
1333210096306970625 2020-11-30 08:43:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is great news for whoever they are , maybe something wrong with me but I just want qualified..gender or color should not be any part of the reason they get a position
1333199196493651976 2020-11-30 08:00:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not wear masks..fall for donalds ignorance. Wish you speedy recovery and a mask
1333198965664313349 2020-11-30 07:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waving bye bye or did u mean for office?
1333198722281385984 2020-11-30 07:58:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree with you. Convince Donald.
1333198504563527682 2020-11-30 07:57:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden    I hope you can find a place for him.Certainly seems qualified, he is a hero &amp; devoted to this country  Same with  Former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch,who was also chased out of her job and deserves to have a position in the Government
1333198502999027712 2020-11-30 07:57:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden  I know you are busy &amp; not likely to see this but I have to try. 1st,I  hope by now they are sure your ankle is not broken..2nd a suggestion, Lt Col VIndman was chased out of his job.
1333196748014104577 2020-11-30 07:50:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Name dropping not always wise
1333196508007698432 2020-11-30 07:49:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very kind of @realDonaldTrump to pay for that recount and donate votes to Biden. Why dont you just stop?
1333196247302365184 2020-11-30 07:48:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jay Silverheels ..that is all
1333196144541839366 2020-11-30 07:48:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can't someone stop him?
1333195747626524673 2020-11-30 07:46:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Surfboards have nothing on the dolphins
1333195518319751168 2020-11-30 07:45:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow so now he is a scientist.. poor delusional donald
1333195303252602880 2020-11-30 07:45:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trusted, free and fair does not equal following directions and saying what you want him to say
1333186420194873350 2020-11-30 07:09:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump is doing what trump always does..lying and hope it sticks..hope people have learned by now
1333173904035209222 2020-11-30 06:20:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you know trump wont it is his revenge..and mcconnell too
1333172917237149696 2020-11-30 06:16:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has a huge job to do ..that has to come before anything else
1333172739377598467 2020-11-30 06:15:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope that people are hired or nominated because they are most qualified not caving to pressure
1333164112738721792 2020-11-30 05:41:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waiting for trump to leave then my flag goes up.
1333163794877526017 2020-11-30 05:39:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree that is desecration of the flag..also when used as masks
1333163607186690048 2020-11-30 05:39:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only thing is, only so many lifetimes he can spend behind bars
1333163179329933313 2020-11-30 05:37:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the milk bar
1333161628402114567 2020-11-30 05:31:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MSNBC @JoeBiden best wishes for a not very sore ankle..tell Major to take it easy on you

1333154114134532097 2020-11-30 05:01:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump said so..even if the judges and ballot recounts all said no..and you  know his followers do not need facts just trump
1333148745228300289 2020-11-30 04:40:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am even more upset by all his followers..officials are cowards..the followers nother story they are more upsetting
1333142121478561792 2020-11-30 04:13:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree trump could not do all he has done without cooperation of his followers in the capitol
1333127952146509827 2020-11-30 03:17:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone with half a brain knows if trump says it or does it check it out first. trump has no ethics does not believe in them
1333127604254150657 2020-11-30 03:16:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not see that but has to be funniest thing I have heard today..thanks

1333127231493836802 2020-11-30 03:14:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if they realize that is how they look? If so what do they think of themselves?

1333082594796314627 2020-11-30 00:17:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why wouldn't they?

1332881121953112064 2020-11-29 10:56:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how much they pay u to be so gullible? This is sad.
1332880493352726529 2020-11-29 10:54:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump plays with heads as do q and other fakes..and people find it easier to believe them than believe facts..so pathetic
1332880177295200260 2020-11-29 10:52:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't any of these brilliant minds realize that if there was anything wrong, the courts would not have thrown out so many of these suits?

He and his lawmakers are all making donkeys out of themselves to please him. No one has guts to say ..the emperor has no new clothes, he is naked. He needs to stop

1332800166420750340 2020-11-29 05:34:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @toddstarnes Biden cheated? Trump can bill the USA for his golf trips , his flights, tell voters to vote twice, etc etc etc and you say Biden cheated though enough courts and ballots have disagreed.  Think you are as upside down as trump

1332758093529292801 2020-11-29 02:47:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that a joke?  Psalms maybe?
1332757704591503371 2020-11-29 02:46:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no comment because I am not a connoisseur and I like your brain fine as is
1332740560122241032 2020-11-29 01:38:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most of his base seem to be or they would not tolerate all he does
1332733595916578819 2020-11-29 01:10:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only trump could be that stupid if he does not realize in 2024 that is a guarantee Biden would run again
1332732942716710915 2020-11-29 01:07:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not saying about DeSantis what i am really thinking
1332732764186177537 2020-11-29 01:07:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you realize Eric has no idea what the words you use mean?
1332732282919063552 2020-11-29 01:05:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure her fans will enjoy it. Not fan, I wont be looking
1332724606218727424 2020-11-29 00:34:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Another bit of trump blackmail and strongarming..then he can yell he loves the military
1332724193063038977 2020-11-29 00:33:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> talk is cheap?
1332723415606841349 2020-11-29 00:29:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so many whines from trump and his acolytes..do not need facts just trump and his puppeteers
1332696525525327872 2020-11-28 22:43:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Since when is proud of being a child of whomever a sin?
1332696133018263557 2020-11-28 22:41:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think it does not matter. Anyone who does not have that sort of problem just spend your time being thankful. It can change at any time. So far I am thankful but no one knows what the future will bring. Why  waste  time mocking someone for something they have no control over?
1332692124366757888 2020-11-28 22:25:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thought it was very kind of the trump campaign...to look out for Biden ..those 132 more votes were a noble move
1332691742705987586 2020-11-28 22:24:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd not one notification tweet today. Not one !!
1332691499864240129 2020-11-28 22:23:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also what a bit of trust does..
1332691334193299456 2020-11-28 22:22:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GeesüôÑüò∑üôè
1332687060663226368 2020-11-28 22:05:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they expect if it makes it to the Supreme Court, donalds friends will let him overthrow the government..uh I mean the votes
1332686718970040322 2020-11-28 22:04:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I believe whatever the vote count is..do you believe anyone can say no to your dad? THEY DID
1332671930982404097 2020-11-28 21:05:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and now he wants to feel relevant.
1332530671747739648 2020-11-28 11:44:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and how did you help?
1332529948486217728 2020-11-28 11:41:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such abuse of the flag
1332523208986202112 2020-11-28 11:14:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> over a year  https://t.co/ogJhXpxOwG nice
1332523057391525889 2020-11-28 11:13:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure hope they know what they are doing.  I am a dog and cat person and oh myüòä
1332522774959710208 2020-11-28 11:12:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe donors to anything connected to trump should check where their money goes.
1332522438735880193 2020-11-28 11:11:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If the Catholics were in favor of their Pope they still are. If right wingers be honest say  you are fake catholics.
1332514943829237760 2020-11-28 10:41:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is this online. He humiliates himself without this garbage. It is not funny it is even lower than trump would go
1332514570360020993 2020-11-28 10:40:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If there evidence one of these judges would have seen it by now. This is really getting boring
1332514361848590336 2020-11-28 10:39:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will tell that reporter not to speak to him that way. He is the president
1332514214871764993 2020-11-28 10:38:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure @joeBiden will be grateful
1332513968917794817 2020-11-28 10:37:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> might wonder what sort of games trump thinks he is playing
1332513488430882816 2020-11-28 10:35:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He just wants your attention
1332513288593297410 2020-11-28 10:34:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all they have to do is see the same whiners and liars..does not take a genius to figure out will be more of same since it is all there ever is
1332513046925877248 2020-11-28 10:34:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If donald is fighting to expose fraud why not start with his own? Among other things telling people to vote twice. He has said so much I cant remember it all.
1332512718637699073 2020-11-28 10:32:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Say what?
1332481030310277127 2020-11-28 08:26:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondered where he has been..maybe i just did not pay enough attention.Wonder what happens if they do this &amp; an innocent person is shot to please donalds revenge . Tho had Donald had his way central park 5 would have been executed..they were not guilty. Guess that taught nothing
1332480331467943938 2020-11-28 08:24:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What would DeSantis do if someone came up and breathed on him..would it be okay?  What sort of lunatics have republicans turned into?
1332480044506238977 2020-11-28 08:22:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Those who can think and use their brains..would not send that out..but then those that would think and use their brains would call their lawyers off
1332479689198366721 2020-11-28 08:21:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is  trumps puppet
1332479499812950022 2020-11-28 08:20:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is nuts and it is sad..but that does not mean I do not get a snicker because of him..that 80 mill votes finally got a laugh though üôÑü§£
1332473050323968002 2020-11-28 07:55:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your rights start when they crash into mine.
1332469032264589317 2020-11-28 07:39:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôÑüòäüò∑ I am giggling-trying hard not to laugh
1332467826448363523 2020-11-28 07:34:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> always. I dare you to find 1 sentence where he tells truth
1332466593473949704 2020-11-28 07:29:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that can do it i guess lol o well welcome back
1332466438343450625 2020-11-28 07:28:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pretty strange thingü§£
1332466310484254720 2020-11-28 07:28:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you stand up for all people or just your boss?
1332465992023351307 2020-11-28 07:27:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what is ingot and why (if that is i got suspended)
1332465802923143170 2020-11-28 07:26:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad the Judge went by the law..not fealty to don
1332465303993847810 2020-11-28 07:24:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @HenryDNGU1  welcome back wondered what happened to you
1332465120572821504 2020-11-28 07:23:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe they vet accounts and comments until so many of the tweets are not based in fact and just do not change. If it were me I would pull the account
1332464709635813377 2020-11-28 07:21:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like that!!
1332464607986933762 2020-11-28 07:21:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Donald do you realize how much like a baby you sound? By now you have to have your supporters really questioning why they supported you
1332464246639226880 2020-11-28 07:20:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in this picture he does not look like he is there. Wondering if tied to covid or just him..until I look at his eyes
1332464036533989378 2020-11-28 07:19:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is how trump does it lol
1332463952798900224 2020-11-28 07:18:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to me it was not against Republicans..until they made it that way by actions. Moral vs corrupt. Had I seen dems behaving that way would have called them out
1332463556470726658 2020-11-28 07:17:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely, guessing more sorry they did not vote for @JoeBiden  especially seeing and hearing how trump is carrying on
1332463114831491078 2020-11-28 07:15:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Every investigation is not supposed to be out in the sunlight ..until it is over if something there
1332462915975311362 2020-11-28 07:14:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Be nice to see one that even seems plausible.
1332462703391150080 2020-11-28 07:13:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is 2020
1332462397005697024 2020-11-28 07:12:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is not trumps cabinet..Kerry was appointed to do a job he cares about.
1332462104130056193 2020-11-28 07:11:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Me too, but he made his comments public. I did not look for them but I can't unsee them
1332440741914824704 2020-11-28 05:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump believes all things he wants are possible..so guess we wait and see for sure. I like to  think not possible, but trump has no bottom
1332440422447190020 2020-11-28 05:45:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was mine until read what he really thinks
1332440199033479168 2020-11-28 05:44:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I loved his music spent a lot on it..so disappointed no one has an excuse to think that way
1332385853491056640 2020-11-28 02:08:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but look at all the free advertising
1332385714676363265 2020-11-28 02:08:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I feel sorry for him but I also feel sorry for us. Could not show anymore plainly what he thinks
1332385392218267650 2020-11-28 02:06:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> long as it takes to make his wishes come true
1332385307484938240 2020-11-28 02:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly,it would not surprise me
1332384072694456322 2020-11-28 02:01:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so shocked each time an appeal is rejectedüôÑüòä
1332374017278406656 2020-11-28 01:21:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i think it is very noble of US taxpayers to fund his vacations ..more than a year out of 4..we are a kind group
1332373621696851970 2020-11-28 01:20:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Saw his rant Will never see clapton the same way again.  Was much more than 1 racist remark.  Can't think of any excuse for all he said..the link I provided was not his entire comment. I was embarrassed for him..and for me that I was a fan of his.   https://t.co/IjFJgVcA56
1332368668089528322 2020-11-28 01:00:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been trying to figure it out for years.. I can't. At least with Biden, we do have a good person with integrity ,humanity and morality.
1332357526206246923 2020-11-28 00:16:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe it is Covid aftereffects on brain that make him think what he is saying and doing is normal..even for him..or maybe it is humor..thinking humor and if it works so much the better
1332357097481265154 2020-11-28 00:14:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòä
1332353051030642688 2020-11-27 23:58:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also, very talented..would hate to be on their bad side.
1332349521398009857 2020-11-27 23:44:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Could it be you have no idea what is trending around the world?
1332349217352855553 2020-11-27 23:43:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he did not like the question?
1332348879103254528 2020-11-27 23:41:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not find it entertaining ..she gives the practice of law a bad name
1332348463124770819 2020-11-27 23:40:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't reopen yet, he destroyed the planes. trump was not spending his own money to do much of anything. I am afraid to really see how far down we are financially when @JoeBiden   make the repairs and replacements.
1332347459926958082 2020-11-27 23:36:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not understand why you disagree with me when I say covid19 does not just affect children. It can affect anyone. But if you say so.
1332346705593950208 2020-11-27 23:33:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe if he did not live in neverland reality would be easier
1332157752790179840 2020-11-27 11:02:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why?
1332157371209162753 2020-11-27 11:00:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well then hope you have it next year

1332152544873897984 2020-11-27 10:41:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like fresh cranberry sauce but no one to make it for this year  (feeling sorry for myself)
1332125925996113921 2020-11-27 08:55:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow I was never blocked by him and I think I am on the right side of humanity.
1332125620332093441 2020-11-27 08:54:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all I saw was verizon ads

1332124445524316161 2020-11-27 08:49:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Had my doubts about expanding the Supreme Court..now convinced we need to do it
1332124216574025731 2020-11-27 08:48:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> awwwwwwwwwwwwww

1332111556964921345 2020-11-27 07:58:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  you are not a king or dictator...ayou are a person as is everyone else and..you have no right to speak to others that way
1332110081454993414 2020-11-27 07:52:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #VerizonLive wanted to watch the parade not see advertising ..thanks anyway
1332096010491981831 2020-11-27 06:56:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I recognize Lorne Green, no way does that look like Betty White? Maybe my mind is going
1332095485319000065 2020-11-27 06:54:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why ask? who cares? he wants drama why help him provide it?
1332095278393004032 2020-11-27 06:53:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> qanon followers are followers in search of a good drama..far as i am concerned easier not to mention them or think about them..like trump
1332094494666354688 2020-11-27 06:50:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Thanksgiving..Right does matter.
1332093808528547841 2020-11-27 06:48:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is a most sickening thought..not Harris..Ivanka is her fathers daughter

1332069449168515075 2020-11-27 05:11:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not if you do not allow it to happen. Is one person worth giving up your family? He will be out of office soon. Patience is a good thing..you could agree just not to discuss him

1332063848111755265 2020-11-27 04:49:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump must be very happy. Those of us with any sense have to wonder why other than the obvious why they are doing this?
1332062928707743745 2020-11-27 04:45:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry, my dad had alzeheimers and on the phone no idea.who i was when saw me he could not recall ,but  his eyes lit up. Wish the same for you I am so sorry
1332062365240725526 2020-11-27 04:43:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering why his eyes look that way..something really wrong unless he has cried a lot
1332048401324773377 2020-11-27 03:47:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And some justices cannot think any further than their patriarch
1332017685673222145 2020-11-27 01:45:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do any of his "inner circle" tell him he is making himself look like an idiot?
1332005150685360129 2020-11-27 00:55:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GOP source did not notice..any version of trump or any version of a trumplikin would not and did not win

1331984972270473218 2020-11-26 23:35:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Then there is special attention paid to those justices who do not want the epidemic to end and the president who bragged about the vaccines to end covid then installed justices who say we do not want to save the nation
1331979128673882112 2020-11-26 23:12:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Paper is good!

1331810741473697794 2020-11-26 12:03:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you think that your attitude is connected to why you are a former Colorado state legislator?

1331755853259698176 2020-11-26 08:25:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can't be serious
1331755632739946496 2020-11-26 08:24:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the publicity
1331755452338761729 2020-11-26 08:23:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Isnt it nice to know that none of you make sense?
1331755227226181635 2020-11-26 08:22:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> has to bring it to court if he wants it taken seriously.,with his evidence of which he has none
1331755052084629506 2020-11-26 08:22:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he needs no airspace. if he wants airspace go to court with all his evidence
1331754904411582465 2020-11-26 08:21:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not in court because he knows none of it makes sense
1331754771888427013 2020-11-26 08:20:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we need to be accountable too..no one is doing anything
1331754696533544960 2020-11-26 08:20:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is pathetic, deranged and it is dangerous ..but why do his lawyers keep letting him lie?
1331753848571105280 2020-11-26 08:17:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just curious to know..did everyone shake their heads and say uhuh..
1331753331992244224 2020-11-26 08:15:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He should be careful of what he asks for
1331753227491139584 2020-11-26 08:14:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Graceland was excellent, there I said it
1331752529672228864 2020-11-26 08:12:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump cannot be compared to any previous president
1331752266483765248 2020-11-26 08:10:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I totally wonder why 6 million votes was all he lost by
1331752100909506564 2020-11-26 08:10:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o so glad I do not find them disgusting..
1331751879198580736 2020-11-26 08:09:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> duh sure

1331751127570853893 2020-11-26 08:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That was totally recognizable..no head scratching and asking what it was..Anyone who saw or heard knows what it was..and everyone could be very proud of what they saw and heard

1331750270792036352 2020-11-26 08:03:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thanks for the good news.. I prefer to sleep after I read.
1331750155272458244 2020-11-26 08:02:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lot to be thankful for..Jan 20 trump be gone and if earth is still standing there are all the vaccines..easier to try not to  think about trump, wish he would just leave
1331747534453288961 2020-11-26 07:52:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> eating alone and turkey ..don't feel so alone doing it for good cause..
1331747353901068294 2020-11-26 07:51:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your new book sounds very creepy.
1331746978871599106 2020-11-26 07:49:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Selfish? Only out for themselves
1331746809065201665 2020-11-26 07:49:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry @SandyD glad you could gather
1331716725411340289 2020-11-26 05:49:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ossoff and Warnock need to be in office
1331716116578791424 2020-11-26 05:47:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh blast it all anyway üòÉüò∑
1331715362489053184 2020-11-26 05:44:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is ok we expect nothing less from the trump gutter..anything goes, as it did in nazi germany too
1331714099491852288 2020-11-26 05:39:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are all alike..can't be a surprise..no low is low enough to be a crime in the eyes of trump and cult
1331701126710833154 2020-11-26 04:47:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe Perdue knows he is not fit for office
1331697419994734594 2020-11-26 04:33:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guiliani is leading trump around by his nose because trump wants to believe in fairytales and sugar and spice
1331696763158351872 2020-11-26 04:30:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Walked in at end of show..@BillPascrell  was so right. If Biden told trump what to do he would be exactly the same as trump. If we wanted a dictatorship we would not have chased trump out in such record numbers during a pandemic
1331683928051240960 2020-11-26 03:39:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fact I am sure if the legal system looks deep enough, treason would just be one of the charges.
1331683626887548931 2020-11-26 03:38:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump why do your lawyers lie to make your ego happy? You lost, there is nothing they can find that will change it. They talk in public not in court..and you probably pay them for it. IT IS AS FAKE AS FAKE IS
1331660430947848194 2020-11-26 02:06:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps you should ask yourself ..am I Constitution and Country first or am I trump first. Then look hard and realize what you are saying. IF you cant figure it out, try a dictionary and encyclopedia too
1331660058237792258 2020-11-26 02:04:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Voting for trump is voting for "just like russia" and probably worse
1331658104488988674 2020-11-26 01:56:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sounds as low and sneaky as a certain someone else..but unlike that someone Joe Biden does seem to like stability and no drama
1331643418834034689 2020-11-26 00:58:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those that show as trump supporters are not republicans. he has poisoned that party..so no longer recognizable..I see it as the party of trump.
1331642933716656129 2020-11-26 00:56:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unless trump gains..he is not interested and just does not care.  I cannot believe he can have any supporters. He would sell his mother for the right price and that is not a lie
1331642261201969158 2020-11-26 00:53:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does that truly shock you? If he were normal he would not do that.
1331636539529572352 2020-11-26 00:31:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No idea which planet it came from but I will bet that It is hatching baby monoliths
1331636130446454788 2020-11-26 00:29:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gees I sure hope not!!  Satire perhaps?
1331631477243715585 2020-11-26 00:10:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We hope we can repair all he broke but we can sure come out stronger and more aware than ever
1331623911914672129 2020-11-25 23:40:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> CNN said it right when they said appeared planted there..now they are waiting for baby monoliths to appear there

1331622533100171266 2020-11-25 23:35:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Somehow I think the DOJ will know that without help or pressure from Pres Biden
1331622308423884801 2020-11-25 23:34:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump disproves your quote

The country, the world is in disarray..unemployment is huge Covid is the order of the day thanks to your president..there is so much no clue where else to begin but look around see what your "normal "has done
1331605795637784577 2020-11-25 22:28:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget his daughter

1331604735707799553 2020-11-25 22:24:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think Biden would like to have trump call but knows trump is not man enough to do that
1331436229464907777 2020-11-25 11:15:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JennaEllisEsq Are you working pro bono?

1331405986599473154 2020-11-25 09:14:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is the DOJs job to do what the DOJ does
1331405786451480578 2020-11-25 09:14:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does that mean the DOJ can do what the DOJ will do?
1331405115064987649 2020-11-25 09:11:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good news

1331404639267418115 2020-11-25 09:09:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you now worried about ethics?

1331386688493531137 2020-11-25 07:58:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PressSec and you are doing what you always do. whining. Having a little fun ..finally is a good thing. You are not having fun you are poking fun. By the way I like Joes' socks glad you noticed
1331385652865355781 2020-11-25 07:54:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We (Republicans, Democrats,Independents)  will know how to respond. Trumplikins like rubio will whine and complain..

1331384455244734464 2020-11-25 07:49:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is a time for adults and a time for children. The presidency is not the time or place for children. Adults make a major difference in the feel of this country

1331379423166214144 2020-11-25 07:29:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what about the pandemic he decided not to discuss that while he golfed. and rallied..and surprise it does not matter election is over. trump lost. I felt badly for him for a long time, then I realized he invites it, but topper, he tried to steal the election. As I said, he lost
1331379421589205001 2020-11-25 07:29:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry 30000 yes Biden yes. taxes cut for those at top rest have to repay in january. regs rolled back dirtying air etc, going to drill in Alaska, 7 million jobs? Obama revived the economy and were those jobs the ones Obama added then you added on top of those.

1331278837796188160 2020-11-25 00:49:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If paying attention you know that trump is the one who wants to defund police and he said it..but he was blaming democrats
1331278428759265281 2020-11-25 00:48:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I truly hope people are looking and seeing this is just the whining of someone who does not want to leave office..but not because it is to do good for American people
1331277870552014852 2020-11-25 00:45:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is an idiot and not much anyone can do until Biden gets in

1331270018416451584 2020-11-25 00:14:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Interesting question. Maybe they do not read or watch anything but trump

1331231703025799169 2020-11-24 21:42:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RandyRRQuaid That system voted for trump. No wonder you lost confidence..however you got it right this time..so maybe the system has been fixed so only those that can vote do.
1331231280512561153 2020-11-24 21:40:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Saw @maddow and her great explanation,  but trump can only spend so much time in jail. So far he probably needs to live to 500 to serve half the time for his crimes
1331042609075277831 2020-11-24 09:11:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not radical.just normal

1331029130138312706 2020-11-24 08:17:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does it matter? It is done

1330959443182411781 2020-11-24 03:40:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You were a lot more polite about it than I was
1330959319328813057 2020-11-24 03:40:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Jim_Jordan     have heard of republicans doing it, needing police to break up gatherings. Are you running for office now? No election now but Americans are tired of hypocrisy..so be quiet..seems only trumplkins like it
1330959316887736323 2020-11-24 03:40:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> .Americans are those who want covid gone and will celebrate Thanksgiving alone to allow even you to celebrate with family and friends next year. I have not heard of any democrats sharing birthday parties with outsiders.

1330947122548641792 2020-11-24 02:51:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And the nicest part is..he wont mind giving credit where credit is due..
1330946268462505986 2020-11-24 02:48:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The Clydesdale are safe ..the transition has still not started so the country is not safe
1330911288655011846 2020-11-24 00:29:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anything he has done that was "good" was undone by the same person for the last 4 yrs. It is like he does not want to succeed..just hold the office and power
1330911027698036738 2020-11-24 00:28:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good for officials who shut that bar down. Selfish children.
1330893569998073856 2020-11-23 23:18:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This says it all about trump and his supporters.
1330889959075614724 2020-11-23 23:04:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not worry about fixing todays issues

1330882093862285314 2020-11-23 22:33:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only wonder if blueberries or any other fruit are mixed in what happens down the road as the blueberries wear the Sherwin Williams brand.  I do think though that maybe SW can take advantage of his love for paint mixing and maybe send him to a SW paint school for lessons.
1330881159111315459 2020-11-23 22:29:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very peculiar..somehow I have to wonder where his pants were...and what he was doing?

1330855750772592641 2020-11-23 20:48:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seems to me they are either still falling for his lies..and do not even realize it is just smoke screens and lies or they are fearful bigots who also want to live in the 50s
1330855210072354817 2020-11-23 20:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was probably given to her by someone half her age who was out running around and dropped in to visit her.
1330854655857922052 2020-11-23 20:44:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicely said.

1330853742678249472 2020-11-23 20:40:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Back the USA. trump is pro trump not  the USA.
1330852164147834880 2020-11-23 20:34:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Americans of all parties want this country to be Covid 19 free. That disease is serious and can be a killer. Sorry that offends you. For you (all trumps) to make a disease partial to parties, boundaries and masks is insane.üò∑
1330851234807472128 2020-11-23 20:30:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you attend those birthday parties you mention? Do you want to keep Covid 19 around? Americans want Covid 19 gone &amp; people to be able to celebrate without fear of getting families  &amp; friends sick. So you are tired of hypocrisy? Want the rest to support you &amp; serious illness?
1330850235006980096 2020-11-23 20:26:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Get the White House disinfected
1330733752138526720 2020-11-23 12:43:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That really should tell you how much of what trump and the RNC have said and done was inappropriate or just plain wrong and you knew it at the time. Where were the standards all the rest of the 4 yrs 2/2
1330733468767105027 2020-11-23 12:42:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But when she said it it was okay to promote..and all the crazy trump has done is okay to promote? All the crazy the RNC has promoted is ok to promote..but not okay if suddenly gone from the campaign .

1330717810104934400 2020-11-23 11:40:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IvankaTrump in a way really feel sorry for you and the rest of your family ..even your dad..because none of you were taught differently.

1330717071144071169 2020-11-23 11:37:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How many dead people could have or would have filled those seats?

1330715886127345664 2020-11-23 11:32:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Has to be psychological testing..this cannot ever, ever ,ever happen again
1330715227533545475 2020-11-23 11:30:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cannot laugh at him any longer..just want him gone
1330715009471688710 2020-11-23 11:29:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What will you do when you realize you prefer normal over insanity?
1330713972807503874 2020-11-23 11:25:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that sounds head rattling
1330713690526584834 2020-11-23 11:24:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is nothing or no one that is in the trump sphere that is not crazy.

1330693908133781504 2020-11-23 10:05:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why release the kraken? You will give it a complex.
1330693522257797120 2020-11-23 10:03:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not hold your breath for that person.
1330693381161410564 2020-11-23 10:03:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is a sample of parler? Now I understand why have no desire to go check it out
1330693132120449025 2020-11-23 10:02:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't get offended Tomi was kidding
1330685125105946624 2020-11-23 09:30:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He lies like a champ too..do you?
1330685008667947009 2020-11-23 09:30:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Need to do something to break up this cult or 2022 and 24 be a rerun
1330684793684701184 2020-11-23 09:29:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 74 million -73 mil 980,000 insane and fearful bigots
1330684080728502277 2020-11-23 09:26:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you ask you might think so
1330676187195117569 2020-11-23 08:55:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has not taken any responsibility either..but guess we all expected that. He did not want to run against that drummer at all from the start..guess he knew the results and did not like them..but oh well here we are.
1330657874016686080 2020-11-23 07:42:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are all republicans crazy?
1330657673843445762 2020-11-23 07:41:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑ü§£
1330657445845340160 2020-11-23 07:40:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would he spend time with his son when his son might be sick and would need him? Easy..because that is how donald is
1330657058149036034 2020-11-23 07:38:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> repubs like division if that is case and there is no excuse to ignore it any longer..but lets wait and see
1330656832549957638 2020-11-23 07:38:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wise of you to drop that question. Very wise!
1330655390762209280 2020-11-23 07:32:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh how nice. Just like hubby. World is going to hell and she is bring in a Christmas tree before even thanksgiving
1330655179084079105 2020-11-23 07:31:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Deep breathe.
1330655088214499329 2020-11-23 07:31:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry, but better to know than not know. The test can show positive today &amp; negative tomorrow. Hope he has been wearing a mask &amp; there is nothing that says he will be positive.. I know it is stressful üò∑üôèwait &amp; see..you, son, family are in thoughts of many.
1330651481750593538 2020-11-23 07:16:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not know trump had sense enough to get rid of her
1330647424533204992 2020-11-23 07:00:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His kids think his way of doing things is normal. If pardoned they will be right
1330647296565010439 2020-11-23 07:00:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think for his entire life trump has been pardoned which is why he is as he is
1330647175710257156 2020-11-23 06:59:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NO
1330637792230207488 2020-11-23 06:22:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You support trump and that by itself speaks volumes about you. More interested in climbing the political ladder than the citizenry.
1330636021420216320 2020-11-23 06:15:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What are you doing on a regular basis for the unemployed and/or hungry
1330625474834423808 2020-11-23 05:33:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess she cares about the Country, Constitution and Flag as much as trump does
1330625052006559751 2020-11-23 05:31:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be nice if everyone understood what that means. Stay safe and dont forget your mask .
1330624183911534594 2020-11-23 05:28:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one taught them any better? They model trump
1330624022091083777 2020-11-23 05:27:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I just looked at that video and changed my perspective..was thinking 25-35 and racist and gun lovers.. age is all i would change..who knows I don't but sure does not say much for any of them in any age.
1330620250442915840 2020-11-23 05:12:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> New take on air hockey
1330619426648027141 2020-11-23 05:09:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I just realize ..are his primary supporters 18-21 yr olds?
1330619186549231618 2020-11-23 05:08:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could someone tell me why they still support him and so few speak up?
1330618218805923841 2020-11-23 05:04:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Add one more farce to the list
1330618100744589315 2020-11-23 05:04:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this picture makes this country as disgusting as it is right now
1330617721403346950 2020-11-23 05:02:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he wants the 4 more years so the tattoo does not embarrass him. I cannot even believe anyone would do that for anyone in politicis
1330617306435768322 2020-11-23 05:01:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry. You do not believe it now, but it will get better.‚òπÔ∏èüôè
1330570746830217217 2020-11-23 01:56:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a mule
1330570370412408832 2020-11-23 01:54:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you believe it, can prove it, stick to it
1330547120110235650 2020-11-23 00:22:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He lost, election over, now wish people would just ignore him and his antics..rather strange sick ones at that..but to him, any attention is good attention so I just wish it would stop
1330546636137918466 2020-11-23 00:20:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sweet.
1330542790766448642 2020-11-23 00:04:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Jensmall15 @ShawnTnBlueDot @MattfromKC @jp_in_nj
1330542337664147458 2020-11-23 00:03:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Jensmall15 @ShawnTnBlueDot @MattfromKC thanks for the reminder.
1330541871341441024 2020-11-23 00:01:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> resent that..am in NJ not cold, not desolate, not emotionless..
1330541132711858176 2020-11-22 23:58:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Beautiful sight to see
1330540460486635522 2020-11-22 23:55:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your description is what makes trump and his followers a cult.  trump would not give up his life for his followers but his  little marching penguins would give up theirs for him
1330540059746045956 2020-11-22 23:54:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no pardon for trump ..he has been getting pardoned his entire life.
1330539893337059333 2020-11-22 23:53:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree VofR..welcome back to humanity, sanity, honesty and facts. @GovChristie  Sorry it was such a hard lesson to learn but glad you learned it.
1330538205368741890 2020-11-22 23:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you saying that blacks are not welcome in trumps world unless they benefit him?
1330538017736548355 2020-11-22 23:45:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Common sense seems to be a missing part of human make up these days
1330517713723273217 2020-11-22 22:25:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> unempathetic, unsympathetic
1330516762790604802 2020-11-22 22:21:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someday trump followers &amp; voters will understand..he does not care about you..any of you..only what you can do for him. He has yet to say PUT ON A MASK so Loeffler and millions of others do not put that mask on. Now they are statistics as trump whines he wants to stay in office
1330515861803851777 2020-11-22 22:17:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they do not wear masks either
1330515565203558403 2020-11-22 22:16:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am weird too then. Never tasted with no desire to taste Starbucks anything.
1330515251067035650 2020-11-22 22:15:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Senator Toomey is Republican and America is first not trump and his dictatorial wishes and dreams
1330514914952306692 2020-11-22 22:14:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I really wonder how many if any supporters has he lost and how many truly understand he just lies a lot and that is what they support?
1330514719824883713 2020-11-22 22:13:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÑüòáüò∑ you cannot see the unhappy smile behind my mask.
1330510189292875778 2020-11-22 21:55:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is smart if you are the people writing down the lists of probable felonies to investigate as you give him enough rope to hang himself
1330500541244379136 2020-11-22 21:17:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wishing you a speedy recovery.
1330496206892638209 2020-11-22 20:59:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ask donald elections are to reelect trump.  He cannot handle losing so the alternative is to hire him for the rest of his life.  Why would it matter what the voters think or the electors believe?
1330359073649340416 2020-11-22 11:54:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> real attorneys generally work better than drama stars
1330358806849720320 2020-11-22 11:53:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wish Kelly Loeffer a complete and totally recovery from Covid 19  in time to return to the campaign trail to get her butt kicked
1330358276391923712 2020-11-22 11:51:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hopefully trump will be more irrelevant than Kristie Alley
1330358007117586434 2020-11-22 11:50:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no one tries?
1330357871289257992 2020-11-22 11:50:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is hysterical. Do think he might need a real lawyer lol
1330357671703310338 2020-11-22 11:49:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry.   She still could be okay ..do not give up. PEOPLE PUT ON YOUR MASKS
1330357359256989696 2020-11-22 11:48:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still likes the power
1330345132072316932 2020-11-22 10:59:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not want to wave the white flag. He does not seem to understand that takes courage. What he is doing now is fighting a losing battle. Takes no courage to do that and sorry he looks like a buffoon around the world
1330344410165415937 2020-11-22 10:56:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @sentoomey. Thank you for being an American first
1330344144800256000 2020-11-22 10:55:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not quite sure of what i am hearing but I think what is staring me in the face is some people who love the coattails and the revenue so they want to keep it all going and will use donald in anyway they can to flatter him and keep him in the fold..hazard of being a narcissist
1330344005142540290 2020-11-22 10:55:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear @Acyn she does not say stop trump so guessing she is continuing
1330333615989919745 2020-11-22 10:13:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As soon as Senator Toomey realized there was no doubt and options were  final,  Pat Toomey stepped forward as an example of decency and integrity.
1330332393597759488 2020-11-22 10:08:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He was a cute kid and now he has headlines..as abusive and helping "alleged" killers get out of jail on bail. Very sad.
1330324085323214855 2020-11-22 09:35:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If trump had anything he would be in court..but he does not,   he is not.
1330323883040370690 2020-11-22 09:35:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No sane person who does own a media company wants that
1330323622947328002 2020-11-22 09:34:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one in their right mind would want trump
1330322582042800130 2020-11-22 09:29:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Though that would be federal prosecutions but there are so many more in NYS
1330321220869517313 2020-11-22 09:24:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is it true?   https://t.co/P8W3MfxGIf
1330313591237595136 2020-11-22 08:54:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But do not forget the type people that got him out..and he is seemingly a "friend" of donalds too
1330313378309562368 2020-11-22 08:53:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone stop them already !!!!!
1330313242523152393 2020-11-22 08:52:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thanks for sending neatly compiled dates no drama , just facts üò∑üëè
1330312966726619137 2020-11-22 08:51:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess rudy is like donald in that way, they do not have sense enough to be embarrassed or know when they look like asses
1330312448792997892 2020-11-22 08:49:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go away donald
1330312114137862144 2020-11-22 08:48:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear @Wharfrat2004
1330311727892865032 2020-11-22 08:46:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was going to send this too you until I realized it was you that sent it :)  He sure is having fun!!!
1330310245734887426 2020-11-22 08:40:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you mean to sound that bigoted? Look at trump
1330309891345543173 2020-11-22 08:39:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> TELL HIM TO STOP ALREADY. You know he cant prove it , he knows he cant prove it. STOP IT ALREADY
1330308288571994118 2020-11-22 08:33:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why hasn't he devoted as much time to helping people instead of helping himself?
1330285377106685959 2020-11-22 07:02:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds reasonable to me
1330284951489683460 2020-11-22 07:00:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone watching to see if truckloads of ballots arrive in the middle of the night? From where? END THIS
1330284713265782785 2020-11-22 06:59:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you DO NOT SAY WEAR A FREAKING MASK..yes, docs and nurses have done fine..radiologists are not cut out for this &amp; presidents are not doctors, also, doctors and nurses are dying from this. Nice how you ignore what is not convenient. Your family has help not available to most
1330280685374935042 2020-11-22 06:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fun too see mom and baby cross the highway on the overpass
1330280402997682179 2020-11-22 06:42:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Animals sure are smart when allowed to be
1330279575910223874 2020-11-22 06:39:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lets give up democracy for donald..do you really think he would give up his power for you? He only wants to stay out of jail..and put his kids in the line of succession. How can people be so blind and stupid
1330279232790990852 2020-11-22 06:37:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pro life trump?
1330279159520768005 2020-11-22 06:37:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump called to execute the Central Park 5..had he succeeded, 5 people who were not guilty..would have died. trump has not changed
1330278702782029826 2020-11-22 06:35:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish I read it correctly the first time
1330278132658688001 2020-11-22 06:33:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I might be repeating myself: THEY ARE ALL SCUM
1330277391697129475 2020-11-22 06:30:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wear the masks that spreads so much love but not covid

1330264072798007305 2020-11-22 05:37:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Haunting!!!
1330263941793116168 2020-11-22 05:36:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To young to look this way. Childhood looks gone
1330263751581446148 2020-11-22 05:36:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that for real?  OMG heartbreaking.
1330262844521275392 2020-11-22 05:32:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would give if I had transportation, I no longer do but I used to give plenty, now I cant give any and I feel so guilty because I can't deliver it or buy it and it is so needed now. I know what you mean
1330261920180543488 2020-11-22 05:28:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> by the hundreds of thousands with covid but wont say wear a mask..you  made us the laughing stock of the world and yet u do not stop. Where are the great things? You do not let anything great happen to completion you are too busy stepping on your own feet ruining good
1330255065794433024 2020-11-22 05:01:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Grill in your back yard? Or maybe ask a restaurant to fry one up for you?
1330254520492945411 2020-11-22 04:59:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and that type seems attracted to trump
1330253950239576065 2020-11-22 04:57:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You guys like the headlines? I am done looking at anything with your names or pictures
1330252857648558087 2020-11-22 04:52:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This behavior is now okay?
1330241138939277317 2020-11-22 04:06:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did not have a rally?
1330240201160073228 2020-11-22 04:02:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tweeted? reminded people why they voted against him
1330211431900459022 2020-11-22 02:08:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that really a sample of trump finest?
1330211250089943043 2020-11-22 02:07:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sorry he is so gullible and uneducated..maybe if he would learn to spell, fact check,  stop name calling and cursing he might like himself more and not think being a sheep to trump is so great
1330205638346076160 2020-11-22 01:45:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if that sender knows how bad he sounds? How he makes case for no more republicans or whatever they are at least for a few years
1330205336221986817 2020-11-22 01:44:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MichaelKnapinski  Welcome back. Hope your plan is to pay it forward
1330204690416545798 2020-11-22 01:41:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is funny. Your attempt to advance peace and prosperity for who?
1330204498673930245 2020-11-22 01:40:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good thought if for right reasons..not to replace your doggie..cant do that
1330196779984433160 2020-11-22 01:10:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is so very sad
1330187195081240584 2020-11-22 00:31:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you mean that he wants money back?
1330186963664723969 2020-11-22 00:31:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think of all trumplikins as racist or they could not tolerate this behavior
1330186055438512131 2020-11-22 00:27:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gotta luv it.üò∑ü§≠ü§£
1330185546963038216 2020-11-22 00:25:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so, did it go up or you just want more readers?
1330184778923077635 2020-11-22 00:22:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course..no one needed masks their leader did not say wear them and they did not have enough sense to put them on by themselves
1330150267212492800 2020-11-21 22:05:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would have preferred to see adults with adult behavior...that could have said see we really are decent.But no, not the trumplkins or trump..(who has already destroyed the republican party)
1330149558865760260 2020-11-21 22:02:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought he already destroyed it
1330148680800858115 2020-11-21 21:58:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> About time!!
1330147246273392646 2020-11-21 21:53:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984  https://t.co/A47X9zbnCF
1329996230404022272 2020-11-21 11:53:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she is interested in cannibalism so did not certify? what am I missing?
1329994259718680581 2020-11-21 11:45:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just all so demented and desperate
1329982170119753731 2020-11-21 10:57:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Same upside down Bible?
1329981793358008320 2020-11-21 10:55:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She thinks only has to listen to trump. Apparently, that is more important than this country.
1329981118435766274 2020-11-21 10:53:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are there any other humans around him as he walks maskless?
1329980925652955136 2020-11-21 10:52:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I refuse to ask
1329980702935445504 2020-11-21 10:51:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Healthy Birthday ..
1329980059235577856 2020-11-21 10:48:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidJohnson31  so glad you are home
1329978770363719680 2020-11-21 10:43:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry I used to like Ricky but I have seen nothing to make him heroic
1329978639824334848 2020-11-21 10:43:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> brave donations and heros what the hell is this?
1329978514204987393 2020-11-21 10:42:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess if you did not learn from having one tv game show host as president, you wont learn from tv celebs of yesteryear or tv ads
1329977540526673921 2020-11-21 10:38:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What sort of country has this become: or maybe the question is what sort of people are these?
1329976687887572999 2020-11-21 10:35:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope twitter will give the Biden first dogs their proper acknowledgement and  space
1329975914038439937 2020-11-21 10:32:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I suppose he can always stand up and walk like a man..maybe first time in his life?
1329962144562081806 2020-11-21 09:37:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That ending is totally perfect
1329961802403356673 2020-11-21 09:36:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She is a disgrace. Reminds me of someone at hitler rally
1329961280212496390 2020-11-21 09:34:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wont look because I am sure he has those traits and i am trying to ignore anything to do with him
1329961047764176896 2020-11-21 09:33:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Excellent..beautiful to see/hear democracy and freedom of speech at work
1329960026425987076 2020-11-21 09:29:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GaSecofState  Thank you for being an American. You can support trump but still have scruples, and stand for your state  and the Country
1329959375654490113 2020-11-21 09:26:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol
1329956732764872704 2020-11-21 09:16:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Here comes the light.. however long it takes to get to January 20, it is coming, Biden..and the vaccine with it. Sounds good to me
1329956353587236864 2020-11-21 09:14:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bet repubs slump a lot more for next election
1329951258090811392 2020-11-21 08:54:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whoever the candidate is.. the media must pay attention, not pat them on the head ( as was done with trump for most of the 4 yrs) and send them on their way
1329943743043133446 2020-11-21 08:24:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So happy there is finally something to combat progeria
1329942230514212865 2020-11-21 08:18:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is so disgusting..no words can say how disgusting he is
1329941837482782722 2020-11-21 08:16:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR ALMOST PRESIDENT @JoeBiden  https://t.co/1Tu6D6MZKr
1329941623317426176 2020-11-21 08:16:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DonaldJTrumpJr     wish you well jr.  maybe you can develop a heart now
1329941404932591621 2020-11-21 08:15:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What does this say? I have lost count of all the covid surrounding trump because he wont say put on a mask..and how many are in jail or under indictment? What a swamp
1329940889737760768 2020-11-21 08:13:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now, now you are better than that..try hard to get the sentence out
1329940545536483330 2020-11-21 08:11:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Awesome..glad he was not hungry.
1329940301146955784 2020-11-21 08:10:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to bad donald does not have the word gracious in his vocabulary anymore
1329939953258795010 2020-11-21 08:09:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If what I heard is correct, I am so glad to know there are real Republicans out there who stood up to trump  and keep the rule of law and scruples alive and well. Thank you MI
1329939437854273537 2020-11-21 08:07:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh you are nasty. don't blame the turkey
1329911583301128194 2020-11-21 06:16:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @andrewcuomo  Congratulations on your Emmy
1329909877179887626 2020-11-21 06:09:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So @LeeChatfield  were you an American first today or a trump chump who is trying to destroy or discredit democracy?
1329908666103963650 2020-11-21 06:05:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well if Sidney or Sydney  does not know her own name can't expect much from her.
1329908421710188545 2020-11-21 06:04:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is sidney powell as ignorant (maybe stupid) as she appears?
1329907899477397517 2020-11-21 06:02:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't wear a mask, go out and cosy up to anyone you please..things are much more important than your life and health and the life and health of anyone. Can you spend or use your things if you are dead or  in the morgue?
1329907414498471938 2020-11-21 06:00:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And yet he did not clarify it..so what did he really mean?
1329906824632545281 2020-11-21 05:57:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot believe the lack of integrity from all the trumplikins
1329906058140266498 2020-11-21 05:54:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Betty forgot her little checkmark..o wait, she is not who she pretends to be
1329905852162125831 2020-11-21 05:53:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very astute
1329905168771657734 2020-11-21 05:51:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why is this here?
1329905049468854272 2020-11-21 05:50:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so many followers in such a short time
1329898726631088131 2020-11-21 05:25:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt
1329898387349647363 2020-11-21 05:24:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
1329898259066785793 2020-11-21 05:23:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do tell?
1329866463121989634 2020-11-21 03:17:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In plain English take this virus seriously. It is not the flu, it travels to others easily and it kills..if not I understand it to be a painful recovery with possible long lasting effects. Take it seriously if you want it to go away.
1329865270677082112 2020-11-21 03:12:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Know Merrick Garland  by experience or words of why he was not even heard for supreme court by the republicans?
1329862214510055424 2020-11-21 03:00:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Think we need more guardrails
1329861745096200193 2020-11-21 02:58:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would agree but I don't because Biden would have to stoop to trumps level
1329860410791571466 2020-11-21 02:53:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wow ,great! now trump gets more vindictive
1329860283238649858 2020-11-21 02:52:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looking at her nails..o my god what are they?
1329860055747977216 2020-11-21 02:51:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if that is what you like, why not?
1329849227665661952 2020-11-21 02:08:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds accurate to me
1329845924995227648 2020-11-21 01:55:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ah thank you will send shortly
1329840080245108736 2020-11-21 01:32:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hillary was investigated..based on whines from donald not facts..no one is whining but donald and friends even now
1329839761394192392 2020-11-21 01:31:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 0 evidence? Haven't you been watching? Even if she did nothing but help daddy in an illegal activity..she is an accomplice to whatever he did
1329833683134672896 2020-11-21 01:07:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> facts are facts. there is nothing that can look as bad as the trumps or their supporters
1329833114890342401 2020-11-21 01:04:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Law is the law whoever you are..for some takes longer for others, it is not harassment or politics if there is evidence to look further
1329832678498197505 2020-11-21 01:03:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Republicans should be standing up telling trump NO
1329832411820158979 2020-11-21 01:02:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and daddy did nothing wrong either..always everyone else
1329825049692561408 2020-11-21 00:32:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps legal team are geniuses it is why trump can lead them by nose
1329823027685695491 2020-11-21 00:24:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are not doing any minimum they are doing nothing and less
1329822805119131648 2020-11-21 00:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> america is a hole? Yes right now it is..it is not a success it is abject failure
1329822076228743169 2020-11-21 00:21:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what sort of moron says he is in favor of law and order..and shows he is not ...unless it is his law and his order?
1329821493937778689 2020-11-21 00:18:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Kingsford Hi went to the site 3 times and cant find what I am looking for so maybe u can help.  How is the date read on your baby back ribs?  Used to think I knew how now not so sure. HELP
1329795182171189248 2020-11-20 22:34:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in every sense of the word?
1329794311211388928 2020-11-20 22:30:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If they do not have enough love of country, or state or sense to say no to Donald, phone calls wont help.  He is a snake oil salesman and they must realize it by now
1329793846239178754 2020-11-20 22:28:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shocking isn't it? But, nice he finally woke up.
1329793626386419724 2020-11-20 22:28:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Eek..science works..so what? Ignoring science? Maybe they prefer covid19?  That is how I see it.
1329792897617682433 2020-11-20 22:25:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be more glorious  if republicans stood up to him as judges rule against him
1329642478744580098 2020-11-20 12:27:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tucker I did not think you needed evidence. Way to go..
1329638801485029378 2020-11-20 12:12:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not? Stupidity now seems normal again
1329631775333773313 2020-11-20 11:44:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could not think of a more deserving family
1329625664312532994 2020-11-20 11:20:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are not there yet and he is not a king to command them or dictator to insist. choice is theirs
1329625464273563649 2020-11-20 11:19:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GOP is not the gop it is the party of trump and whatever the cause these trumplikins  let it happen and need to be held responsible when trump is done with his attempt at a coup
1329624585311019008 2020-11-20 11:16:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The legislators do not have to commit election fraud or say yes..it is a choice.If yes is the answer..remember they will probably never remove him from office,they will be responsible for the destruction of the Constitution and the democratic republic that we all live in.
1329623597871194116 2020-11-20 11:12:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fantastic..can they stand up to him? I sure hope so
1329623436738629638 2020-11-20 11:11:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump believes he is the best and the only one..and he can't understand that he is not. Remember at the start when he convinced his followers, he is the only one can fix it...he is not
1329623161600679936 2020-11-20 11:10:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you are also ready for sanity
1329621955897602059 2020-11-20 11:05:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have words for it..but not printable
1329621639433236482 2020-11-20 11:04:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering whose side they are on
1329621496495484928 2020-11-20 11:04:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if they have money set aside for the legal defense with real lawyers?
1329618677793222656 2020-11-20 10:52:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they realize they are the ones attacking ..Biden and others are protecting and trying to keep the integrity
1329618285311258647 2020-11-20 10:51:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I repeat look at your father like you want to see him
1329618144994996224 2020-11-20 10:50:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe you can look at your father like you want to see. Ignore the dollar signs and look at your father
1329617851955748864 2020-11-20 10:49:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go read the Constitution and determine who has the perverted perception of the Constitution
1329616267515400192 2020-11-20 10:43:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ignore narcissists pay attention to the USA , republic democracy and Constitution
1329615676814864384 2020-11-20 10:40:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe you should read the Constitution and then think about the last 4 yrs.
1329591163154812928 2020-11-20 09:03:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ask mcconnell
1329589972266065924 2020-11-20 08:58:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess they also do not fact check or know truth when it hits them in the face because they are as seemingly gullible as trumps rednecks and do not belong in government
1329589666681589760 2020-11-20 08:57:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sydney powell must live in the same bubble that trump does or she is taking advantage of an old seemingly deranged man for her own greed
1329589385893965827 2020-11-20 08:56:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @gop you and your president have created this mess. When you say you will clean it up..that means you have to clean up sydney powells apparent lies too. CLEAN UP DONALD..you have all seemingl collaborated to destroy the GOP and the USA
1329588537566564352 2020-11-20 08:53:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ok donald do you have another stunt up your sleeve in GA?
1329588276735381510 2020-11-20 08:52:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like a squall..unless it is bugs üòÉüò∑

1329587864632504323 2020-11-20 08:50:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It also says you love yourself, your neighbors ,family and friends
1329586405710983170 2020-11-20 08:44:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how many more times Georgia will elect Biden üò∑üòá

1329585473346531328 2020-11-20 08:40:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His media is out for ratings msm is out for truth and ratings
1329585024417542144 2020-11-20 08:39:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicely said
1329584558971490306 2020-11-20 08:37:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Real republicans are just fine.. it is faux republicans that are trumplikans that are an issue. Look at what you trumplikins have done and are doing. to encourage destruction of this country . No paranoia just do not call yourselves republicans. You are not
1329583279566172160 2020-11-20 08:32:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lets get rid of all the blacks (not my idea) that will hand the win to donald. This is so underhanded, seemingly illegal and bigoted
1329570415996514307 2020-11-20 07:41:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not have sense enough to be ashamed
1329570052996259842 2020-11-20 07:39:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What you are doing to yourself and this country around the world is something your children and grandchildren will have to live with
1329569028407488515 2020-11-20 07:35:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry you missed the beginning
1329568502148198403 2020-11-20 07:33:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching @richardpainter on MSNBC ..if still on hope you watch
1329568196945457153 2020-11-20 07:32:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @richardpainter   Watching you on MSNBC  Thank you for your refreshingly honest voice and thank you for your ethics complaint
1329560969857667074 2020-11-20 07:03:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Used to think it was an act..but when I see the hair color dripping down his face and he does nothing..now not so sure
1329559520289443841 2020-11-20 06:57:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the only ones  that should be humiliated are the ones who believe the trash trump spews . The mask is not political, or religious. The mask is to help you live and make the virus go away
1329559223789907968 2020-11-20 06:56:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd  trump made the mask political..trump does not care if you die, or get hospitalized. ..or if vaccine stays around. If made in image of God the mask protects the image not distorts it. Distort is what trump has done  and it is not likely he even believes in God he uses him
1329558250795266059 2020-11-20 06:52:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Democrats do not try to destroy the country.  nice try.
1329558082503004167 2020-11-20 06:52:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> seems so

1329556747414089729 2020-11-20 06:46:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not even attempt to wipe it away
1329556483151962122 2020-11-20 06:45:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> welcome back @maddow
1329556327409004545 2020-11-20 06:45:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good grief they want a stranglehold all over country..trump here trump there everywhere a trump trump..bad idea
1329539042199941124 2020-11-20 05:36:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So disgraceful!!!
1329535676891746305 2020-11-20 05:23:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unfreakingbelievable ..@SecretaryCarson  what happened to you?
1329535211089121286 2020-11-20 05:21:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sigh
1329535042314493953 2020-11-20 05:20:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds dangerous too..and if he does not change his ways, guessing one more jail sentence
1329534928590135303 2020-11-20 05:20:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a dirtbag..this is your choice to be thought of that way donald
1329531022015336448 2020-11-20 05:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> worthy of more than 20
1329530589867806723 2020-11-20 05:02:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good news..thanks
1329515720057774081 2020-11-20 04:03:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is all insane
1329515548414259202 2020-11-20 04:03:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @AOC  why are you and your friends trying to divide this country now? Why not try to restrain yourself until this country is on the right path.
1329514914352947205 2020-11-20 04:00:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no thanks necessary, your books are good
1329514681782788097 2020-11-20 03:59:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are not in court..no facts so can talk away to the public..but the court requires facts..and there is trump people without facts or decent hair dye..then there is the hot mic
1329514302563348488 2020-11-20 03:58:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nevermind the  hot mic what about the hot hair-dye?
1329505771302883338 2020-11-20 03:24:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is next @osullivanauthor
1329505165074894855 2020-11-20 03:21:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thank you, I have been embarrassed for years..today maybe the word is mortified
1329504916952518657 2020-11-20 03:20:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you only go from 1-10 ..no negative
1329504681886937090 2020-11-20 03:19:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is trump and you degrade the title president every time you use those 2 words together or use the word president. just trump works well
1329498061480062979 2020-11-20 02:53:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess 2 of a kind?
1329497531148021760 2020-11-20 02:51:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great suggestion
1329480436159016960 2020-11-20 01:43:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @mattgaetz Yes matt when you can ask if someone hates america for telling the truth..I would instead ask why do I lie and make up stories to benefit trump?  Is it because I hate america?
1329474445191376897 2020-11-20 01:19:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no violence
1329474160486199300 2020-11-20 01:18:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is so antiamerican it is amazing
1329473769128275969 2020-11-20 01:17:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We just call people like @ErrolWebber totally ignorant. He does not like facts or truth. If that is a candidate..good reason not to vote for him
1329445254236426256 2020-11-19 23:23:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> think about it awhile ..see if it helps
1329445121771905024 2020-11-19 23:23:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BeckyakaGaggy @McnellisWilliam I can hear it now! Apparently so can you.üò∑üòÉ
1329444745320542210 2020-11-19 23:21:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The parade of shrimp remind me of trump and his minions..follow the leader off the cliff
1329436792806912001 2020-11-19 22:50:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What else do we expect from trump supporters???
1329436598937726978 2020-11-19 22:49:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have a way with words..but now that owl..so cute, they need to bring it home. (oh nevermind, home is in Rockefeller Center )
1329435971591557125 2020-11-19 22:46:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess she had him pegged right..but is she still his lawyer?
1329434420282093568 2020-11-19 22:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> should ask yourself that question and follow your instincts. You do not need opinions of strangers for that.
1329433113345331202 2020-11-19 22:35:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A good Christian would know God gives choice. Her choices sound like she obeys donald and he is not God and masks are not political
1329432684259586052 2020-11-19 22:33:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unbelievable. Wonder if it hits in her family if she might rethink her position. Where has sanity gone?
1329432213935558657 2020-11-19 22:31:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh gees something else for trump to whine about
1329431632793755649 2020-11-19 22:29:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not let trump win, even in your head. You are not alone..just look forward to Inauguration Day.
1329430010969600002 2020-11-19 22:23:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What about catching up on what they were not given information about with Covid?  I have the thought that @biden can  and will prioritize quite well. If he needs help or suggestions he will ask.
1329268383053910023 2020-11-19 11:40:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not sound anything like Lindsey Graham I remember
1329267696282832899 2020-11-19 11:38:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But you think it is ok to go into states and discuss elections. Dont try to be an actor, it does not fly..remember trump will be gone, hopefully life will go back to reality based on facts , science and whatever we need to make it real,not trump based
1329267694286368768 2020-11-19 11:38:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not radical, rather middle of road..but u seem to think if someone thinks differently than you it is radical policy, sounds like  personal grudge or fear.
1329266746973413377 2020-11-19 11:34:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trying to cheat in an election.whoever it might be for..is NOT doing something right, when you think it is ok to even infer or question about ballots and signatures particularly not when in your state. it is time for you to go,sorry you think it is okay it is not.I was republican

1329265618303004672 2020-11-19 11:29:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and, AOC is not President
1329265498069020672 2020-11-19 11:29:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am happy to say I do not believeit matters to President Elect Biden what fox wants

1329243383727091712 2020-11-19 10:01:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ought to bring him back where he came from.

1329242686239485960 2020-11-19 09:58:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As trump is making a huge fool of himself and people get sick and die spreading covid far and wide because trump wont even say wear a mask, Biden is still President Elect,needs the paperwork done to get the transition done.trump is still making a fool of himself and lost
1329241712385003520 2020-11-19 09:54:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not care what party he is..If he was democrat I would have left the democrats party.  He is no human to represent our country or be a role model for our children. He is everything a good citizen is not. He is everything a president is not

1329229803233419269 2020-11-19 09:07:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pathetic maga thinks trump is hero and patriot.  We know who the real hero and patriot is.  It is Lt Col Vindman

1329225083521544198 2020-11-19 08:48:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good reason not to be republican any longer..cause it could be true or satire
1329224918953844743 2020-11-19 08:48:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Imagine not Biden's children,  knowledgeable and qualified how strange is that?
1329224534151602178 2020-11-19 08:46:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With all the stories and all the lies of the last 4 years..this might be the funniest
1329165117926346755 2020-11-19 04:50:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GSAEmily       Someone should tell her she is not supposed to have sworn allegiance to trump. She should be doing what is right. COUNTRY FIRST
1329158000578359298 2020-11-19 04:22:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Emily why not pretend you value the country over trump and sign the papers?
1329153251632173061 2020-11-19 04:03:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so sad this is happening to you or anyone in government trying to do their job. I do not know your party, I do not care. THIS IS WRONG IT NEEDS TO STOP
1329141553915441154 2020-11-19 03:16:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> am sure other  seemingly antiamericans will hire her..but for  people loving this country she is toxic
1329126890058166275 2020-11-19 02:18:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but his voters suffer for his behaviors too..don't they see it?
1329126752422072321 2020-11-19 02:18:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mcconnell is showing himself to be as american as trump
1329126308681551872 2020-11-19 02:16:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will there be enough jail cells?
1329126123205238787 2020-11-19 02:15:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh that poor giraffe
1329117814913986567 2020-11-19 01:42:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is any of the handling of Covid19 or any part of what is going on with this transition to Biden now worth jail I have truly had enough!!! I felt sorry for him ..now  I am angry, fed up, he does not care about the people the USA ,the world..even his supporters just seemingly putin
1329107012018429966 2020-11-19 00:59:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IvankaTrump  you need to go out and look at the real world. Too late for your dad..not you
1329106411201175558 2020-11-19 00:57:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not in favor of reparations ..just equality..people that are entitled to reparations are long since gone
1329106159823953921 2020-11-19 00:56:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hate obviously preceded trump since US started I guess..but dimwit knows how to play on it..and he could have made it better or tried ..instead worse than ever
1329104853898027011 2020-11-19 00:51:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How do we shut them up?
1329104567590645760 2020-11-19 00:49:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gee no ballots for Biden in all those votes?
1329102085305102336 2020-11-19 00:40:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if he lives on an orange tree
1329101112947957762 2020-11-19 00:36:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess she would know the details..seems awesome
1329100335634395136 2020-11-19 00:33:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he moved to florida and not likely they do want him back in NYC
1329100201857064960 2020-11-19 00:32:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me
1329098137131212801 2020-11-19 00:24:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 25th amendment
1329098050879565828 2020-11-19 00:24:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or he thinks no one else can figure it out
1329095692351049732 2020-11-19 00:14:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can relate
1329095241337614339 2020-11-19 00:12:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> either he does not know he is disassociated because he has always lived in a reality all his own..
1329082992019402752 2020-11-18 23:24:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Post election, pre-election does not matter trump has always been about trump. Closer to election, closer people of any color matter..after election no need. This is trump and always has been
1329081770935951363 2020-11-18 23:19:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be a lot of investigations..shockingly, way to many
1329080419153633280 2020-11-18 23:13:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is not doing his duty to the American people. Glad you are ..thank you
1329080229239767048 2020-11-18 23:13:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perfectly well said.
1329062678057410561 2020-11-18 22:03:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pardoning would make many vomit.and not change his followers since they believe he has done nothing wrong..
1329061571386101767 2020-11-18 21:59:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Absolutely true. He does not get it..it is probably the same reasons all his businesses failed
1329060301204049920 2020-11-18 21:54:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad your aunt was home  surrounded with love. üò™üôèüò∑
1329059793458302978 2020-11-18 21:52:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure nice Pres Elect Biden- soon sanity!!
1329059504772681730 2020-11-18 21:50:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry Brian.
1329046263212421121 2020-11-18 20:58:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the headline is: trump fired Chris Krebs  for telling the TRUTH
1329035588373196800 2020-11-18 20:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh my, my..get well soon and wear a  mask
1329035399214272514 2020-11-18 20:15:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> (sarcasm I hope)  Other countries pay better?
1329034678079287298 2020-11-18 20:12:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @fransaundersays Absolutely
1329034331646521345 2020-11-18 20:10:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope you are as flattered as you should be
1329033990599307265 2020-11-18 20:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1329033899125723138 2020-11-18 20:09:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and wear masks
1328898731685646343 2020-11-18 11:12:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope you feel no worse than you do now and rush to recovery..also hope you will wear üò∑ and insist others do too. üôè
1328898126321737730 2020-11-18 11:09:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Must be time to get the country back into some sort of order Mr. Raffensperger. Time in the future to go back to republicans if you choose too. Right now you just do not fit in with them. Your ethics and standards are too high.
1328897324488265735 2020-11-18 11:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will spend his time scheming or doing something he is not supposed to do..or maybe he just wanted to spend is LAST Thanksgiving in the white house
1328896585544110083 2020-11-18 11:03:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Billy42472455 Shirky not trustworthy you said
1328896422163468290 2020-11-18 11:02:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would be nice..at least Biden would know who to trust
1328896324431908865 2020-11-18 11:02:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same shithole country that trump invented
1328892322881425414 2020-11-18 10:46:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aw so sad, it is certified
1328891321227075585 2020-11-18 10:42:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not hear that yet. You are right The USA stands proud
1328890991827439619 2020-11-18 10:41:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you are in her tax bracket you will probably be voting for her..but it wont be because of her honesty, her working,  her ethics or for this country
1328885084519362561 2020-11-18 10:17:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is prob digging the dirt..since donald gave him permission lol
1328884278671925249 2020-11-18 10:14:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> talk to your pals about that. According to FBI it is not who you blame
1328884114049654787 2020-11-18 10:13:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not first one he fired for that very same reason
1328883635576053761 2020-11-18 10:12:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are trump fans can always find them..ignorant fools who keep this virus going..cause their god trump never said put on a mask. they volunteer for their trumpy..do you think he would volunteer for them? NO WAY..hope your drive is very boring and your dad is ok
1328865722387271680 2020-11-18 09:00:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden how to get transition paperwork signed?
1328864622376587264 2020-11-18 08:56:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why for a change do you not pay attention to the people not yourself. You are the one being improper..and there was one dead republican..her son tried to get her to vote..he was caught
1328863870400802817 2020-11-18 08:53:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 25 amendment?
1328863694839754752 2020-11-18 08:52:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only way trum can come back to earth is for his republican trumplikins to speak up and tell him the freaking emperor has no clothes
1328858534570811392 2020-11-18 08:32:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course you would disagree ,he wants the law carried out
1328857969757401089 2020-11-18 08:30:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> apparently some want to become felons and maybe disbarred
1328857788014075904 2020-11-18 08:29:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you poor desperate souls..you will invent anything
1328857620426485760 2020-11-18 08:28:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> law and order president just does not say what law and order in what country?
1328857297024643072 2020-11-18 08:27:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trying so hard to steal an election he has not earned and claim a title that is anathema to this country..dictator
1328856981097095169 2020-11-18 08:26:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Huge win for dismissal of Democracy and dictatorship you think
1328853265681887232 2020-11-18 08:11:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ran away?  hiding to pardon trump..I do not miss him until he is mentioned
1328853030515724288 2020-11-18 08:10:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is crazy
1328825496210198530 2020-11-18 06:21:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know why Christopher Miller has that position
1328824727260057602 2020-11-18 06:17:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @charliekirk11 are you paid to sound stupid?
1328818120283316225 2020-11-18 05:51:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò°üò°üò™üò∑
1328816919781269507 2020-11-18 05:46:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is what he asked for but do not know if did since far as I can tell , his "services" are free
1328807639321616392 2020-11-18 05:10:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ah peace, love and children are back on the senate floor
1328787828352946176 2020-11-18 03:51:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't know about Philly but Rudy is suddenly an honest guy?
1328787556067123203 2020-11-18 03:50:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> his father and everyone in his family  but doubt that is why..probably thinks older people are "weak" but he is the only weak i see
1328787296028663809 2020-11-18 03:49:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> for sure
1328787174569938947 2020-11-18 03:48:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GOP does not have enough spine to stand for fact over trump fiction but think they have enough to send rudy scurrying
1328786705843957765 2020-11-18 03:46:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They will not believe it anymore than they believe covid19 is real
1328785811744108546 2020-11-18 03:43:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cowardice, incompetence, corruption, culling the herd, oh heck, all of the above
1328785547146485766 2020-11-18 03:42:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how many other states and counties should be investigated for republican goings on ..this is the straw that says cannot ignore this
1328785362660057089 2020-11-18 03:41:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well gee how shocking
1328785209484042241 2020-11-18 03:40:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RTRageTV @svdate I think trump has been canceled by him
1328784977509707778 2020-11-18 03:40:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe said hello in passing
1328710356416524289 2020-11-17 22:43:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Emily sold her soul to the devil, why think she would do anything decent for the country?
1328709716030189568 2020-11-17 22:40:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôèü§≠ in my  thoughts..
1328709217839177728 2020-11-17 22:38:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is how it should be.
1328708165211451393 2020-11-17 22:34:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt he should have received them at any point
1328708040971980800 2020-11-17 22:34:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will truly be a great day
1328707432261017602 2020-11-17 22:31:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice his advisors can be grown ups
1328542309961568257 2020-11-17 11:35:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòä
1328541968402702337 2020-11-17 11:34:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very nicely said
1328541888346009600 2020-11-17 11:34:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What has the current admin done ..when they are not helping Pres Elect Biden..and that is causing death and difficulties? The vaccines are the hard work of the scientists
1328540621934637059 2020-11-17 11:29:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 133,000 a year not a lot of money
1328540393424773120 2020-11-17 11:28:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Both my boys were scouts, my grandson is a scout. Never a problem, both my boys loved scouts and what they learned (now boys are grown ups and 1 son just worked on pinewood derby with his son just like his dad did with him .
1328533510546714624 2020-11-17 11:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too
1328533267352592385 2020-11-17 10:59:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like that thought much better
1328526312177328129 2020-11-17 10:32:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Among the many things that they cant do
1328526209865707522 2020-11-17 10:31:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bernie and AOC need to let Biden do his job and not be your mouthpiece. Guessing that is why the huge blue wave did not happen
1328525981842337794 2020-11-17 10:30:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do tell..why else would they fatten up that seal?
1328525856516550656 2020-11-17 10:30:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SenKamalaHarris trump is the most vindictive individual I have ever seen, You 2 will have a lot to undo. As of right now trump invited oil a d gas companies to bid on  land in alaska to drill in before u get in. You must know it ,but what they are doing in so many ways should be illegal
1328525011938897921 2020-11-17 10:27:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder what they will do with the seal? Fattened up for a nice coat? Sure hope not
1328519870112296962 2020-11-17 10:06:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Way to go. Good luck
1328505846591074312 2020-11-17 09:10:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most of us know the truth and facts and know those people are helping this virus to continue. We are sorry and thank you for all the work you do and risk you take
1328505844221288449 2020-11-17 09:10:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To  all the very real doctors and nurses who are working past exhaustion because some just do not believe covid exists or masks help I wish we could send those people to tour covid wards..
1328504680410910721 2020-11-17 09:06:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> someone who will probably never see a paycheck
1328504557668880384 2020-11-17 09:05:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no, he left the country with less than no money,  most disliked of all time only concern was for himself and we wont discuss the rest. A portrait to fill in the blank space on the walls but that is it.
1328486850919616512 2020-11-17 07:55:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Poor little bigots..that is why   there should be an older age range..these kids just follow the herd

1328485632918876173 2020-11-17 07:50:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> After hearing that I suggest there should be a hearing.. he has gone so far down..amazes me

1328473078909767680 2020-11-17 07:00:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> notice donald partnered with Moderna not USA partnered ..but yes  he did and here is daughter bragging about it..wondering if she ever considered ramifications of what she said or what he knew
1328470777105178627 2020-11-17 06:51:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No, donald talks about a lot of things &amp; most of us do not believe a word..with good cause. Voting is over, he lost , the pharma companies did the work, maybe if donnie were honest he might have been in for another term. As is @JoeBiden is.Places wheredon could help, he does not
1328469816739508225 2020-11-17 06:47:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JessieJaneDuff  if DJT talked more,golfed less we would not be so angry but now to see his daughter gloating? Get your priorities straight maybe if he had been honest from the start, this vaccine would already be on the market Reading your wording I even wonder if you are real.
1328469815158312960 2020-11-17 06:47:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jessiejaneduff Are you serious ??? 11million cases (people) but he rallied, he golfed and he knew.  He knew that vaccine would work as much as he know injecting bleach or using all the crazy concoctions he wanted? Moderna and Pfizer did this, not donald. Maybe
1328468309210259456 2020-11-17 06:41:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He knew in January,told not a soul.. Great news just think, if you and daddy had been honest earlier would have been so many fewer deaths,maybe he could have said wear masks..do not gather in large groups. so many other things could have done.Great news 11mil cases and you gloat?

1328389182293676033 2020-11-17 01:27:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but trump and McConnell just do not care
1328388956615045132 2020-11-17 01:26:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not care no matter how dire a picture that is painted or how true it is
1328388666700558338 2020-11-17 01:25:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt there is something in it for trump..even if nothing more than thumb in the eye of this country.

1328366773498941450 2020-11-16 23:58:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there are differences of opinion..then there is trash

Hippocrates is still held sacred by physicians: to treat the ill to the best of one's ability, to preserve a patient's privacy, to teach the secrets of medicine to the next generation, and so on.

1328143446373265408 2020-11-16 09:10:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heard that Elon Musk could not go to the launch. He tested positive for Covid
1328143100842291200 2020-11-16 09:09:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Murphy has to get approval from trump but there has to be a way around it
1328142803621322756 2020-11-16 09:08:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o lordy I am thinking very sweet idea and very dangerous, bad idea. What do you think?
1328124196334034944 2020-11-16 07:54:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are not alone but you can handle being alone.Truly sorry. It will get better.
1328124194215915520 2020-11-16 07:54:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Want truth? Has to be a horrible place you are in  and you must feel terrible guilt tho nothing to do with you.  Inspiration comes from inside you. No one can comfort you until you are ready to accept comfort.
1328104629259874307 2020-11-16 06:36:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am now at that point.  Knew what you say is true all along and yet ignored it hoping they would change. Now I am not nearly as tolerant
1328104180410675200 2020-11-16 06:34:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Must be the same ones that swear trump is god. their belief in all this is just so insane
1328103917910188032 2020-11-16 06:33:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everything is far away. Hope you and your pup had a great night. Thank you for what you do
1328101071722516480 2020-11-16 06:22:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and people would think he cares and ignored everything about him that makes him horrible
1328097779047149573 2020-11-16 06:09:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope it teaches him something but is funny
1328097486842580992 2020-11-16 06:08:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Putting smart people in charge is just silly
1328097333557534721 2020-11-16 06:07:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope people recall he had no answers
1328096075174072327 2020-11-16 06:02:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should be held responsible for telling truth but he is not..so it is up to people to fact check him
1328095886145163275 2020-11-16 06:01:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not just trumps fault..also fault of those who do not fact check and allow this to go on
1328061020879904775 2020-11-16 03:43:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just do not look or count or comment
1328056831638310912 2020-11-16 03:26:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Those of us that can think understood your comments. Those of us that can't think love to blame anyone else rather than think
1328056378515091456 2020-11-16 03:24:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but they wont stand up for facts
1328015496478941188 2020-11-16 00:42:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If I live to be 500 I will never understand how this happened? I could possibly understand how trump happened, he is a snake oil salesman. It is the followers in and out of politics keep my head shaking
1328015125207453696 2020-11-16 00:40:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Once Biden is in and this horrible disgusting bunch of lying trash is out..I hope that voters ,even decent, real republicans will not forget this down the road. Republicans need an overhaul and unless people want to lose democracy, no one that participated should be reelected
1328014535437979650 2020-11-16 00:38:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> am sure Biden can pick a bipartisan AG without input from us

1327989314773508096 2020-11-15 22:58:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THE CONSTITUTION IS WHAT IT IS, @BIDEN WILL BE PRESIDENT-what the hell is the matter with you?

1327699335384084480 2020-11-15 03:46:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is she aware it undermines democracy or she does not care? Bet she would if democracy went away
1327699078864572417 2020-11-15 03:45:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> kayleigh is the same liar now she was then..is it to convince us how huge it is or to convince her president how huge
1327698635182706694 2020-11-15 03:43:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> seems to me if you know it is covid and you know people can die..then you are guilty of premeditated murder and i do not care who you are
1327698381104418823 2020-11-15 03:42:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> white nationalists and nazi s he attracts the finest
1327689222736785415 2020-11-15 03:05:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you keep advertising it there could be more maskless, senseless  lemmings  to fall off the cliff
1327688626004766721 2020-11-15 03:03:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does not matter who it is, matters that they see
1327688208591826948 2020-11-15 03:01:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why not just ignore them..more attn u pay more will go

1327658180206202881 2020-11-15 01:02:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> democrat tyrannical control? If dems used tyrannical control or your president used any control..covid would not be as bad as it is. Put on a mask
1327657739758297089 2020-11-15 01:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure you did all you could .you had your arms around her and that was the best thing you can do. My condolences
1327657412720009221 2020-11-15 00:59:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He had a bad day yest.yet today he has his nonthinking followers boosting his ego. Nine cases dropped, trump has lost&amp;keeps losing but his uneducated nonthinking followers keep boosting him up and encourage him to undermine democracy. What sort of fools are you? This helps no one
1327656740163375106 2020-11-15 00:56:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good for the trump appointee who does not play to trumps base or fox, just to facts and truth. Awesome and most impressive @BenHovland
1327655811833880577 2020-11-15 00:53:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cannot believe so many gullibles or that media is covering it and bringing attention to it
1327649406443728897 2020-11-15 00:27:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG! That feels good!
1327649205515640833 2020-11-15 00:26:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope the clan are the only ones there and anyone who can think for themselves and now realizes what they were supporting will stay home and wear masks when outside
1327648982240288769 2020-11-15 00:25:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because Ivanka and Jared forgot which country they represent I hope their power is gone

1327595089430974466 2020-11-14 20:51:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone that can think for themselves will not be there.
1327594476471279619 2020-11-14 20:49:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he also knows rudy is a lackey who loves the free advertising and wants to please

1327593114119380996 2020-11-14 20:43:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In your dreams..but donald likes your comments. Does anyone tell him the truth?
1327436814295175170 2020-11-14 10:22:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Heard that and grinned. So true.

1327436215046574082 2020-11-14 10:20:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone want to protect yourself , those you love, those you like?

1327421561473740801 2020-11-14 09:22:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just so idiotic. Wish he would go babble at a tv screen or something where he is not babbling here
1327420496766492672 2020-11-14 09:18:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Like mandatory masks? distance etc?

1327412684548165632 2020-11-14 08:47:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should take this dimwit to a hospital and let her visit a covid ward.
1327412403978514433 2020-11-14 08:45:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone seated needs a mask
1327411828499025920 2020-11-14 08:43:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You can spread covid and never even know you have it..masks protect you and everyone else
1327411668557721601 2020-11-14 08:42:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Selfishness has no bounds with you or your fellow trumplikins. All you are doing is prolonging this. Your children can get it, your husband, your mother your friends..almost anyone. Your body your choice..needs to not be so selfish, so we can get rid of this virus
1327411148405297153 2020-11-14 08:40:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wants his best bud to stay his best bud
1327411030029381632 2020-11-14 08:40:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry no room for facts in your world
1327410817244012545 2020-11-14 08:39:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope it pours over DC tomorrow
1327410265114238976 2020-11-14 08:37:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If i have to choose just 1, crimes against humanity
1327409821507870720 2020-11-14 08:35:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more chance to get response if do not sound like attacking
1327409495140683776 2020-11-14 08:34:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes..
1327409138654212097 2020-11-14 08:32:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish someone would tell him emperor has no clothes,,it is overdue
1327405728357883904 2020-11-14 08:19:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he has ties, so does your daddy and your sis and probably you..daddy tried to hide his and sis did not brag..now you should know election time is over so crawl back under your bed
1327405384915705858 2020-11-14 08:18:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe he decided to change colors to give his adoring audience something else to talk about
1327369083667554307 2020-11-14 05:53:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> however you spell it..you are right
1327368501401694208 2020-11-14 05:51:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but such a cute, sweet Willow
1327365015024840704 2020-11-14 05:37:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also the same one who is still ignoring the death toll so far
1327364860989108225 2020-11-14 05:36:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> waving bye bye
1327364525159538698 2020-11-14 05:35:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same one that is online now lying thru his teeth..again
1327364008987549700 2020-11-14 05:33:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He lied a couple times. Pfizer did not say 7 or 8 weeks and they said front line first ..a
1327314596273811459 2020-11-14 02:17:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure would not hurt..if only people were not so ignorant or gullible,  Facebook would be fine..but so many are ignorant and gullible so probably a good thing to do
1327287606116225026 2020-11-14 00:29:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely, their support of donald revealed a lot I did not know or knew but did not know how ingrained their fears, greed and bigotry are.. so I can manage without them.
1327287053176999936 2020-11-14 00:27:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now if he would only convince trump to stop playing his head games to see how he can benefit, we might think his opinion matters here. trump does not care..he cares about himself and while he listens to opinions, he only pays attention to those whose opinion match his own
1327260701321261058 2020-11-13 22:43:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My guess is that anyone that wants to  bring this virus under control and  can think of anyone besides themselves will be altering plans.
1327259716905562113 2020-11-13 22:39:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do facts matter to any of them?
1327254846697836544 2020-11-13 22:19:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He could do it without us and do worse without any mention made of what he is and has done. It is not the media doing it, it is some media contributing to intentionally assist but most media trying to stop him
1327253359678644224 2020-11-13 22:13:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What sort of crazies are you?
1327244670066429954 2020-11-13 21:39:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Motorcycle meetups and rallies? Who needs a mask?
1327243754386976774 2020-11-13 21:35:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In my mind it has been old news for a long time..did anyone believe that he ran for president again because he wanted to do the peoples work?
1327243417731149825 2020-11-13 21:34:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump
1327242456560259076 2020-11-13 21:30:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I see that motorcade and I do not cringe. Should feel normal but..feels strange.
1327241564658290690 2020-11-13 21:27:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑Good grief!!!!!  Are you serious???????????????üò†
1327090629009154050 2020-11-13 11:27:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Particularly after this disaster, we just need to be grateful for the leadership of Pres Elect Biden and VP Elect Harris. It can and will be cleaned up
1327090157389033472 2020-11-13 11:25:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ah...feels so good!!
1327089797333196805 2020-11-13 11:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If we were not all so exhausted by all of this you would probably have billion approvals
1327087173032693763 2020-11-13 11:13:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Take down the fences, walls, gates
1327086554808987648 2020-11-13 11:11:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He should be terrified..reap what you sow and all that..I do care, he is responsible for all he has done, but he does what feels good at the time because integrity and the word no were not in his vocabulary and somehow I doubt it was his fault
1327085877353459712 2020-11-13 11:08:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think I read it right.  I saw he was not wishing him badly, just wanting  money. Did you read it again?
1327085472498278405 2020-11-13 11:06:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe I read it wrong. I had the impression he wanted money. Going to back read it again
1327081685012402177 2020-11-13 10:51:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Clueless why? He is talking to and about republicans in the only language they seem to understand now? Guess I am clueless too?
1327081019401408512 2020-11-13 10:49:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What sort of attorneys are trumps attorneys?
1327078933054054400 2020-11-13 10:40:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> "Better late than never". At least they will give him a chance. Some people take longer to look around
1327065767058268161 2020-11-13 09:48:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not a lawyer, not named Glenn, sure a lot that looks criminal to me though
1327062959881940992 2020-11-13 09:37:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hm first instinct is to say sounds like torture to me..2nd instinct is to say that is what he put us through..we had to listen to all his lies and drama..so,moving that way
1327053697285828612 2020-11-13 09:00:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> baby trump
1327046980535775236 2020-11-13 08:33:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry. Keep thinking positive it is difficult, but, it helps.  Why do we keep telling actors to "break a leg?" Because every play has a cast?
1327046187002851331 2020-11-13 08:30:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Chat looks so eerily pleasant.

1326928607768440833 2020-11-13 00:43:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does trump have any idea what he looks like and how he sounds?
1326928389824016384 2020-11-13 00:42:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She is right. Speaker is absolutely right.
1326927534575980544 2020-11-13 00:39:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump       When do you think and use your own brain?
1326918766316441600 2020-11-13 00:04:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> President-Elect Biden will have so much to deal with and yet it is not enough for child trump to help out. trump is being vindictive but so shortsighted he does  not realize he is also hurting his supporters? Will people still support him when they have time to seeforthemselves?
1326912260305006595 2020-11-12 23:38:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When did he start paying for any costs incurred that would be something he did not need again?
1326912001562513409 2020-11-12 23:37:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Saw a number trump wanted people to call if they saw or heard of any voter suppression.  Shall we call?
1326911619876745218 2020-11-12 23:35:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is exactly the vision I have
1326911209866731522 2020-11-12 23:34:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am thinking that we all know that trump is having a temper tantrum. It just occurred to me it could be directed at people who did not vote for him and that is why he is doing nothing but being vindictive
1326898232841080835 2020-11-12 22:42:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Poor you Michelle..if G-d were on your side this would not be happening

1326890782322798596 2020-11-12 22:13:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never anything law and order about him..just can't figure how anyone could even think he was..or how they voted for him

1326014605181784068 2020-11-10 12:11:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Republicans are afraid they wont get to have another president after trump..so instead they want to help fix this by allowing him to create his own party and destroy the republican party and you people think that is sane? HE IS LOSING. SOMEONE NEEDS SOME BALLS TO SAY SO

1326012168018534400 2020-11-10 12:01:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The person who told you there is the need for  a candid CONVERSATION should go have the conversation. Put a stop to this Either you are the solution or you are part of the problem. This needs to end

1325978059040821250 2020-11-10 09:46:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doesn't anyone have the guts or love of country to say to him..DONALD YOU ARE NOT THE EMPEROR OR DICTATOR AND YOU HAVE NO CLOTHES ON

1325977432378236928 2020-11-10 09:43:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The coupe &amp; dictator routine sounds about right..I just do not understand how people who have received so much thru this democratic republic could go to all this trouble to overthrow it &amp; encourage &amp; support trump
1325976550815260674 2020-11-10 09:40:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i am guessing you guess right

1325962733121122312 2020-11-10 08:45:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If it happens, not enough votes. Other than trump and his lemmings who cares? There would not be nearly enough votes to change a thing.
1325961792355495936 2020-11-10 08:41:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant do a thing without support of their someones
1325961645525520384 2020-11-10 08:41:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guessing they will be rehired
1325961320819200004 2020-11-10 08:39:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I notice you selectively remove 1-5 tells me not worth anything. You take care
1325961029386440705 2020-11-10 08:38:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all we need t o do is believe you,we have seen what you and daddy have done before. What you both need to do is stand with daddy &amp; both put on your big boy pants. Do you guys realize how you are embarrassing yourselves, the people of this country and the country in eyes of world?
1325949952334426112 2020-11-10 07:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they will get paid? Or seemingly ambulance chasing for notoriety?
1325949654715015173 2020-11-10 07:53:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and his intent appears to be not to have a democratic republic
1325949470274695173 2020-11-10 07:52:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now 666? wonder what other little tidbits will show up.
1325949305480474624 2020-11-10 07:52:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We have noticed that when donald says Biden or whoever did something..he means he did it and assumes because he does it "they" did it
1325924311882985472 2020-11-10 06:12:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump  @PressSec  So far by every standard you  are getting what u ask for and want. Why not realize you cannot abuse people and have them want you as president. You got what you asked for now, accept the results because the results were asked for too..
1325923237927276546 2020-11-10 06:08:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At first I agreed, but seeing the mess donald is making with help from his "friends" more I think the more ways we can show a president he lost better it is
1325866635941601282 2020-11-10 02:23:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why is trump not being removed?
1325865585524305920 2020-11-10 02:19:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sne is enjoying the commotion.
1325829792239935488 2020-11-09 23:57:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should have taken away AF1 for rallies long ago
1325828642161758208 2020-11-09 23:52:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in my   thoughts
1325827301993566210 2020-11-09 23:47:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Caesar's salad? At the local Caesar salad plant?
1325827033214160897 2020-11-09 23:46:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is funny but..I just want them all gone!!
1325826730142085126 2020-11-09 23:44:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great location..Except trash is in the back
1325826340755484680 2020-11-09 23:43:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and life goes on with or without donalds cooperation
1325815642965094400 2020-11-09 23:00:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was   Pfizer on its own
1325809544933609473 2020-11-09 22:36:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @EmilyWMurphy Why  not put country before donald?
1325808803330338816 2020-11-09 22:33:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pres Elect Biden was informed last night. Where have you been hiding? Is it really you?
1325808484395388928 2020-11-09 22:32:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where is the integrity of the trumps who are being anything but thoughtful or helpful and keep trying to dig dirt that is not there. You assume because you people do what you do..everyone does. THEY DO NOT
1325808106731950080 2020-11-09 22:30:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump could not be more deserving of Joe Bidens numbers
1325807595639201793 2020-11-09 22:28:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he were a real president ,he would do what he could to help instead of hurt
1325806441131892742 2020-11-09 22:24:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am a believer in equal justice for all..until I wake up from my sleep
1325775917868855296 2020-11-09 20:23:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As time goes by grifters does not do them justice.
1325775671298285568 2020-11-09 20:22:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure but, the van showed up driven by Casper the Ghost
1325775379664138243 2020-11-09 20:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Murkowski and Romney, think one more do not remember who
1325652275927404544 2020-11-09 12:11:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It has gotten even worse and more vindictive
1325652014123143168 2020-11-09 12:10:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jaketapper ??
1325651464694456320 2020-11-09 12:08:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CNN pence did not write this did he?
1325650466286546945 2020-11-09 12:04:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very true
1325649699194482688 2020-11-09 12:01:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry not even a joke
1325649538129006592 2020-11-09 12:00:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @vp  No one can take votes away, when honest votes. I knew you bent over for him ..but not that far. You are trying to undermine the election. A lot of words are going thru my mind..pro American does not qualify as one of them
1325648131967627265 2020-11-09 11:55:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just so vindictive and childish
1325647999800909824 2020-11-09 11:54:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o gee here we go again
1325647743768031234 2020-11-09 11:53:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did anyone object when the media called out trump early?
1325632690306101248 2020-11-09 10:53:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC  I was a republican. I left because your party is no longer republican..Maybe change your ways
1325628617527799809 2020-11-09 10:37:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I had the impression she was saying after everything is counted it will be over.
1325628358261174273 2020-11-09 10:36:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has been given a resounding no maybe for the first time in his life..he can't control it..so guess no surprise
1325628004261908480 2020-11-09 10:35:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jp_in_nj
1325625308100390912 2020-11-09 10:24:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @maddow and then there is this:
1325624302994157569 2020-11-09 10:20:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was wrong donald can
1325622007405436928 2020-11-09 10:11:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one could be that vindictive
1325620714658013185 2020-11-09 10:06:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> scum
1325619774332743680 2020-11-09 10:02:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your comment tells me you have gotten younger not older
1325617342685077504 2020-11-09 09:52:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like they took lessons from donald
1325616988031422465 2020-11-09 09:51:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stop sounding like a teenager trying to humor a baby. Right we can't ..bye bye.
1325616661454598146 2020-11-09 09:50:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CNN It is inane. Biden does the work and trump collects the money
1325613203250966528 2020-11-09 09:36:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad she remembers and when it gets to uncomfortable to remember, I hope she forgets
1325608638942244864 2020-11-09 09:18:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is painful, numbing and terrifying. Been through it when my son went thru it when he was 7..that was about 35 years ago and he has been fine ever since (knock on wood)
1325608141048983553 2020-11-09 09:16:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Chemo is tough but kids can weather it. Just keep her full of happy and positive thoughts even when not so easy. She is in my thoughts
1325607667503681538 2020-11-09 09:14:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sad for you and your daughter
1325607459868774408 2020-11-09 09:13:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> dont forget masks and soap..and get another room for you
1325607224052486144 2020-11-09 09:12:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> recount?
1325606328321110017 2020-11-09 09:09:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the voter fraud when your daddy told voters to vote twice?
1325605511220310021 2020-11-09 09:05:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wants to stay in the headlines but seems to  know he has lost
1325581796415852544 2020-11-09 07:31:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure very pleasantly said
1325557981602328577 2020-11-09 05:57:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree with John Kasich I did not like the hard left but wanted Trump out anyway. If it was any other candidate I might not have voted that way
1325557241353789440 2020-11-09 05:54:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe one or two of them can offer to house the whole group?
1325556968585650182 2020-11-09 05:53:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Horrifying and plug ugly. We need those mammals,birds, fish,amphibians and reptiles as much as they need us
1325556516494118913 2020-11-09 05:51:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> McConnell will be leaving office when his term is up and Joe Biden will still be in office at that point
1325556315909992448 2020-11-09 05:50:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> instigator
1325556079216963586 2020-11-09 05:49:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As long as parents are involved in their kids lives, tell them they love them and say "no" and stick to it..no trump
1325551604737695746 2020-11-09 05:31:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How interesting. He is really convinced he owns the Courts?  He is leaving
1325551247282352131 2020-11-09 05:30:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is he high? that is a laugh?
1325551132962394117 2020-11-09 05:29:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how he will handle it when he learns he is wrong..will he just ignore it?
1325550979085955073 2020-11-09 05:29:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden comes as close as fully trusting..just sayin.
1325550805634707458 2020-11-09 05:28:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shhhh
1325550210664312834 2020-11-09 05:26:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh ,only 6?
1325546486701170697 2020-11-09 05:11:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I personally think we ought to just ignore him
1325543808541536263 2020-11-09 05:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If needed, it needs to be  Lt Col  Alexander Vindman and his brother giving him the escort
1325536082751008769 2020-11-09 04:30:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He could not make up the votes anyway, but chooses to ignore that. If he cant control it, he is not interested in going there (like the virus)
1325519242440044544 2020-11-09 03:23:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In truth Biden was the only and best candidate to have done this  It is his time
1325518866626252801 2020-11-09 03:21:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is not a republican. republicans that allowed him to do all he did are not republicans either. they are accomplices in trying to remove democracy and need to go
1325517908508807169 2020-11-09 03:17:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Alex Trebek put up a good fight and now he gets a well earned rest. RIP
1325517590777753600 2020-11-09 03:16:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how long these rants would last if no one paid attention..I can understand his feelings  but it is not just him who has feelings so time for rants to stop.
1325516511793082369 2020-11-09 03:12:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Apparently üò∑üòÅ
1325506465524817924 2020-11-09 02:32:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You see a lot more in there than I do
1325500863033581568 2020-11-09 02:10:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You can be sure he will pack it and take it
1325500709614313474 2020-11-09 02:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§≠üòÑ I would remember without giving donald paper towel. Too precious a commodity now
1325500189818441728 2020-11-09 02:07:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do popular vote and 270 count?  Now you want to worry about integrity?
1325500031563149312 2020-11-09 02:06:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Has anyone told you how kind you are?
1325483863238438913 2020-11-09 01:02:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stacy Abrams will be on CNN shortly
1325483350623215616 2020-11-09 01:00:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  You can't even believe the drek you toss out. Why not just golf and leave your phone out of reach
1325482935387123713 2020-11-09 00:58:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish this had been done from the start.
1325482814276558849 2020-11-09 00:58:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bernie always reminds me of trump ..  just one more reminder.
1325470337392398338 2020-11-09 00:08:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üòÄ absolutely perfectly said
1325469493280329730 2020-11-09 00:05:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But it is Sunday morning. Perhaps she is or was at church? I am thinking we will see a lot of her before the runoffs.
1325469221451689986 2020-11-09 00:04:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe rethink your position ? Might want to look at Der Spiegel coverpages for the last couple days. We know he will not win but you are encouraging him.  @LindseyGrahamSC     https://t.co/Xoh7TiXamN   Maybe tell him to concede?
1325467023560814593 2020-11-08 23:55:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was horrible to recognize but, at least it was defeated. The stunning part is, so many of those involved will still be in office.
1325465832433078273 2020-11-08 23:50:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Masks missing.
1325465285428711425 2020-11-08 23:48:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe she chose not too.
1325423143956131843 2020-11-08 21:01:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity he instilled that there are only winners and losers.
1325422262888112129 2020-11-08 20:57:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You really need to be a little kinder. IT IS
1325421971543388161 2020-11-08 20:56:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or maybe Russia really tried but DEMOCRACY WORKS
1325415953430155271 2020-11-08 20:32:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your sarcasm is impressive. The first way to fix a problem is to admit there is one
1325414660498206721 2020-11-08 20:27:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or did he want attention?
1325269919940943874 2020-11-08 10:52:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People cannot believe there can be success unless there is chaos and lies. Hopefully it will change.
1325268056386441221 2020-11-08 10:45:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Had to be so bittersweet for him tonight
1325264575466512386 2020-11-08 10:31:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and no criticism of anyone that I heard
1325263518921322496 2020-11-08 10:26:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> MASKS MR PRESIDENT ELECT. I take a deep breath when I see you without your mask speaking to anyone after your speech
1325263134215561219 2020-11-08 10:25:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 270 elector votes
1325262827762946048 2020-11-08 10:24:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the voter fraud hotline is ridiculous but also think that people should just stop. Those making those calls are no different than what trump does with his name calling
1325262007789113344 2020-11-08 10:20:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you Joe MR President Elect
1325257844988506112 2020-11-08 10:04:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I might get to see my grands for the first time in 8 months Monday, I am so excited..but I would like to see them inside for the day instead of outside for an hour. Please get that virus under control and do not forget your mask!!! Watching you and looking for your mask. PLEASE
1325256656637341698 2020-11-08 09:59:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not be surprised if he watched and thought may be a good idea to say congratulations to Joe
1325256447819702272 2020-11-08 09:58:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt he would and I am sure you are too
1325256137969709057 2020-11-08 09:57:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think they might if they would just sit down and start listening to reality
1325255841772163073 2020-11-08 09:56:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris   Thank you!  https://t.co/BWes3ZfiRO
1325254007338782720 2020-11-08 09:49:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is their loss and it is a shame they are missing it
1325253811846467584 2020-11-08 09:48:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice hot shower that is badly needed
1325253714861559810 2020-11-08 09:48:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So relaxing I do not have to try to figure out what he means or if it is truth.
1325253544367316993 2020-11-08 09:47:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in complete sentences
1325233206581485570 2020-11-08 08:26:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is not the virus that did it..it is how trump handled it that did it
1325232444107321345 2020-11-08 08:23:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice to see you together. I am guessing that you are very pleased tonight.
1325231242820931589 2020-11-08 08:18:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I know how much damage he has done..and know what he has not done..does not stop me from feeling sorry for him
1325230671359602688 2020-11-08 08:16:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still trying to make deals? Not in position for that
1325230458054070273 2020-11-08 08:15:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is insane. They do not know the number 270?
1325230221696626690 2020-11-08 08:14:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only thing I see that is wrong with all the nasty tweets to  and about trump is..we are all doing what he does so we are all behaving as he does
1325229470551302145 2020-11-08 08:11:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too many other sites he can go to for it..would not much matter
1325229205714505729 2020-11-08 08:10:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Heaven forbid you should notice reality. 270+ electoral votes
1325171145331539968 2020-11-08 04:19:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I had it doubt used it three times.  Your last comment was offensive..but feel the same way lol
1325136788663357441 2020-11-08 02:03:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too feel like you but will feel much much better when official and trump gone
1325124719193038850 2020-11-08 01:15:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been great to have you in the battle
1325121366509629440 2020-11-08 01:02:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So amazing. Thank you @JoeBiden  for not giving up so many times when you rightfully could have and did not
1325120736365748225 2020-11-08 00:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope!!!
1325116079627251714 2020-11-08 00:41:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden  CONGRATULATIONS to you @KamalaHarris and your team. Guess now have to get Reps to pay attn and stop thinking trump is G-d, maybe now they will get a breather from him and see for themselves. @JoeBiden  if anyone can fix or begin to fix this mess, it is you
1325115515430465537 2020-11-08 00:38:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So excited and happy. President Elect Biden and VP have a huge job ahead
1325113753457790979 2020-11-08 00:31:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/dX7pcPQr1C
1325112450723799045 2020-11-08 00:26:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tears running down face
1325112375910035457 2020-11-08 00:26:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YAY CNN CALLED PRES ELECT BIDEN
1325108741440671744 2020-11-08 00:11:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure good for a laugh..ü§≠üòÇ
1325108160273801217 2020-11-08 00:09:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but he has cried and whined over everything for 4 yrs
1325107645410316288 2020-11-08 00:07:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has put more effort into almost anything than stopping cv.
1325104211919593473 2020-11-07 23:53:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh goodness, what a shocking surprise.
1325104068361134081 2020-11-07 23:53:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why was my ballot lost and arrived 2 days after primary in republican area. Why is it I do not read about democrats breaking voting laws just republicans? Why do you keep repeating your same "please trump lines "but do not look independently to find the real truth?
1325103240019632128 2020-11-07 23:50:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He did not remind anyone of what he did with the children..so that did not matter
1325102976428552196 2020-11-07 23:49:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I remember all he has done..but voting is over..just time to call it
1325093448953843714 2020-11-07 23:11:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if he attended that would be for the benefit of the country so it would be shocking if he did attend. His biggest problem is he has never been in it for anyone but himself
1325091026785144833 2020-11-07 23:01:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very cute.
1325090883524497412 2020-11-07 23:01:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My same wish for him as for any of them..hope they now will know to take Covid19 seriously and realize that the virus does not know boundaries or political parties or income but I wish him a speedy recovery
1325090277128876033 2020-11-07 22:58:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unless all of the media is too intimidated to declare it?
1325080908223942657 2020-11-07 22:21:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh good trump is not expecting a sideshow from him
1325080694930993152 2020-11-07 22:20:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Come on man, deal with this..make yourself proud go get help
1325080136849485824 2020-11-07 22:18:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bernie was not elected. At least for now, Joe has enough to handle without groupies with their own agenda
1324933691106320384 2020-11-07 12:36:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Apparently the 4th came and went..and reality eventually starts..Hope he is hit hard enough to teach him a lesson but not hard for real issues
1324927045932113920 2020-11-07 12:09:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just let him be gone
1324926812426825729 2020-11-07 12:09:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IngrahamAngle  try helping donald and his following get him to understand he is done  with nothing worse than the will of the people. If you do not you are making it worse for him and his followers. Maybe you should read some real information
1324926344661233664 2020-11-07 12:07:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am trying not to take a deep breath until it is official..but after hearing him speech. I took a deep breath
1324925966397956096 2020-11-07 12:05:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was just what we needed
1324925872147718144 2020-11-07 12:05:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That includes you?
1324924693149863937 2020-11-07 12:00:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden  Thanks for bringing civilization back..but WEAR YOUR MASK when done speaking. You have to stay healthy!!! You were so reassuring. Tfank you
1324924274143092736 2020-11-07 11:58:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Awful to listen to someone who is not a reality show host
1324919100263587845 2020-11-07 11:38:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is difficult when you are donald lol
1324918761896505345 2020-11-07 11:37:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes do not want to drive him over brink still time to stay before has to go
1324909406111281159 2020-11-07 10:59:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Idiots no one but trumplikns get freedom of speech?
1324904967459762177 2020-11-07 10:42:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish I could post this on FB on my page
1324900713923743744 2020-11-07 10:25:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think the news shows should follow Bidens lead
1324900567412580353 2020-11-07 10:24:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think Biden is a gentleman
1324898418955849729 2020-11-07 10:16:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stay safe and healthy
1324898326853132290 2020-11-07 10:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§≠ü§û
1324898089774288902 2020-11-07 10:14:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Got that right.  oops left..uh correct
1324897786823847937 2020-11-07 10:13:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now he suffers the comedown and reality from his hyper-sonic avoidance of reality
1324897410485788672 2020-11-07 10:12:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whatever he would like or whichever he determines to be most urgent. His choice and they might be the same thing.
1324888695812599815 2020-11-07 09:37:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 shall i ask what that means?
1324881022362800128 2020-11-07 09:07:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This has to be so difficult for him to accept. He has never been told no before and now he is overloaded with that word
1324880124160962561 2020-11-07 09:03:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is exactly why I feel sorry for him. He has no clue how government works no matter what you tell him. If unpleasant he does not want to know
1324879924025561091 2020-11-07 09:02:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÑüò∑
1324879346935468037 2020-11-07 09:00:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree  #TheEmperorHasNoClothes  but someone needs to get him to end this without an explosion
1324878788417757185 2020-11-07 08:58:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump     Perhaps it is not the legal teams but their client?
1324878379980640259 2020-11-07 08:56:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> suggest it to him..tho since not official Pres yet dont know that he can be briefed?
1324875050672132099 2020-11-07 08:43:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 face it, you are meaner than meanie
1324857885843714050 2020-11-07 07:35:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would have liked seeing them send him to one of his dictator "friends" but this is fantastic
1324856740861653000 2020-11-07 07:30:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bigger than trumps hand
1324856227059437571 2020-11-07 07:28:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You mean the guy that told trump separating kids good idea? So  intelligent and kind ..maybe if you his type person as you seem to be.There was nothing about separating those kids &amp; their parents who will be scarred for life and never have the life they should have had!that guy?
1324847011619840000 2020-11-07 06:51:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/zlxIlrX4iK
1324843251992535045 2020-11-07 06:37:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I will enjoy this once official ..trump does his angry dance and everyone says lets avoid that..so we have this
1324827923543662593 2020-11-07 05:36:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He would no longer recognize DeJoy walking down the street but he sure would sue him
1324827710770847745 2020-11-07 05:35:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure is
1324827371631976449 2020-11-07 05:33:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish I heard this
1324825190447067137 2020-11-07 05:25:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If all trump were to be known as is impeached and one term..he would probably be grateful
1324824889627430912 2020-11-07 05:24:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not want to pay..have paid enough and trump would probably negotiate something to allow you to watch. He has enough gov money
1324824552594132995 2020-11-07 05:22:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely trump will do anything good for the general population. Think will have to wait for Biden ..unless maybe Biden and trump can work something out?
1324822244057665536 2020-11-07 05:13:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o u sure like pouring salt in a wound
1324751260919209985 2020-11-07 00:31:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot imagine a better sight..well maybe a little better..if President @joeBiden looks on in the background
1324747785648918530 2020-11-07 00:17:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When/if trump needs to go, hope your husband and his brother are ones first to return (and escort trump out in full uniform in broad daylight) ..add others need to be returned to duty..like Ambassador and ship commander
1324746545435213825 2020-11-07 00:12:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gotta agree
1324746315927035904 2020-11-07 00:11:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Once it is official
1324727957257146368 2020-11-06 22:58:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Get help Jr.
1324727589559242752 2020-11-06 22:57:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guessing they do understand and it scares them silly
1324727354862772225 2020-11-06 22:56:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @josh_wingrove Do you really believe Trump can batter Democrats, Independents and many Republicans into submission? We waited too long and put up with too much to let this go. Why not a little bit of grace? Just try
1324726716531695618 2020-11-06 22:53:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If laws are not violated then laws need to be rewritten to be more clear of what is ethical  and permissible so there is no question.
1324706418080055296 2020-11-06 21:33:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GovChristie  Nice to see you have awakened
1324706102693498880 2020-11-06 21:32:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too the man with the mask under his nose..right and wrong way to wear a mask. Try  https://t.co/d3ER2SUS5y for instructions. You need to cover your nose too or the mask is not helping a whole lot
1324705798241591296 2020-11-06 21:30:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wait til he learns he has sold out his soul for daddy who has no money.
1324705517349064704 2020-11-06 21:29:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Every legally submitted ballot must be counted..without trying to make them appear illegal . Trying to get to trumps court will not make the ballots illegal. All sides are observing all counting. No need for courts, just a need for truth and truth  is not trumps friend
1324704926409347072 2020-11-06 21:27:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is opinion then there are outright lies. If lies (and they are) , how can they act and lie so blatantly against the USA?
1324693888863510531 2020-11-06 20:43:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would you expect anything resembling honesty? Of course that is what they are saying. They did say and will say anything that scores brownie points ..does not mean that they mean it
1324686469085233154 2020-11-06 20:14:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they will ever come back to reality
1324686390811086848 2020-11-06 20:13:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just insane.
1324686112904880128 2020-11-06 20:12:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If Biden wins, they will have their prayers answered.
1324685950992207876 2020-11-06 20:11:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if there is a Covid19 brain as a remnant of side affects of either Covid19 or its medications?
1324685458807422977 2020-11-06 20:09:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You give him a lot of credit. When did he become human?
1324685311817977856 2020-11-06 20:09:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÑüòÉüòÜüòÇ
1324685010583117825 2020-11-06 20:08:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Feel sorry for him that his money overrode his upbringing. He never stood a chance. Feel sorry for his kids too. They don't stand a chance unless they suddenly realize none of this is normal. They won't because to them, it is normal though
1324684098452000768 2020-11-06 20:04:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do not mean it, you think you do but do not however, I hope you have the chance to try it.Rumor has it they are releasing Phil sometime " soon".
1324683384174628867 2020-11-06 20:01:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I slept..then I  woke. Still have not seen democracy saved , but waiting. Do see the effort to save it.. It is historic.Just heard outtake of Joe from yesterday, so calming and reassuring. Guess I missed nothing..and hope today is his day PLEASE.
1324566461667549188 2020-11-06 12:17:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GOPChairwoman     There really are no irregularities unless in your collective heads
1324566195857694722 2020-11-06 12:16:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am going to bed and if like last night..I get up in the middle of the night, turn on tv and no results..I tell myself I tried..maybe tomorrow
1324552500972789760 2020-11-06 11:21:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BMeiselas It is really too bad that no one in his life cared enough to say no to him without giving in to avoid a temper tantrum.
1324547392306294785 2020-11-06 11:01:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So classless anything for a headline. What is the matter with you and trump? Trying to incite rioting..or worse ..will you do what donald does if the worst happens? Sit back and blame everyone else?Just remember this has been seen if anything happens to any name connected to u
1324546201254060032 2020-11-06 10:56:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> waiting eagerly, but think been doing for 4 years
1324528893227917312 2020-11-06 09:47:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üò†  really does ..he still sounds like him but now he sounds like him on steroids
1324526402314641409 2020-11-06 09:37:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just be patient and hope!! (very odd word in this day and age)
1324526257959325697 2020-11-06 09:37:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Acosta How many are still out?
1324526137222045696 2020-11-06 09:36:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/d7lwSUMtcQ
1324525939317972994 2020-11-06 09:36:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No I see nothing worth pardoning..not even him saying sorry
1324525827632058369 2020-11-06 09:35:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Saw about 2 minutes of it turned it off. Do not know how an American president can sound so unamerican
1324525643976114179 2020-11-06 09:34:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump said again he won? Is there such a thing as Covid 19 brain disease?
1324525430100013057 2020-11-06 09:34:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good luck
1324524459563405313 2020-11-06 09:30:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too bad they could not vote after his speech
1324524342479364096 2020-11-06 09:29:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is the party of trump
1324524214628601857 2020-11-06 09:29:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I turned it off after about 3 minutes. It was a disgusting show from anti american president
1324523908628946946 2020-11-06 09:28:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or maybe you should step away from electronics for a couple weeks..and anyone involved in the lawsuit business then look at the issues. Look at the issues then.  I was republican for lot of years until republicans were no longer republican
1324523281903423488 2020-11-06 09:25:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that a real bear ???
1324502352708194306 2020-11-06 08:02:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only ones not transparent are the liars at the top of trumplikins party
1324502049267003393 2020-11-06 08:01:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to thank them too. Watched 5 min that was enough
1324488473328422912 2020-11-06 07:07:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I believe we will win too.
1324488324342554624 2020-11-06 07:06:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just heard but did not see who it was, just know on CNN "the incredible shrinking presidency"
1324483632015286272 2020-11-06 06:48:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jr is seemingly as antiamerican as daddy. and he was sent out to discredit the election,and raise as much trouble as they want. people can spread as many lies as they want or tell as many  fake news stories or discredit anyone with any fake news..but it wont change the vote
1324483025523118081 2020-11-06 06:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump        Every vote counts..aren't you sorry you did not tell your followers not to vote by mail?
1324482338244431872 2020-11-06 06:42:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has not won..this is all fake news
1324481869098921984 2020-11-06 06:40:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> by republicans or maybe you mean by fake news?
1324481103575601163 2020-11-06 06:37:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if she is wearing black for a specific reason
1324480771055386628 2020-11-06 06:36:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you say that as you lied for him?
1324474954142855174 2020-11-06 06:13:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not only should not obey, if they believe order is illegal they do not have to obey
1324474703550009345 2020-11-06 06:12:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right , no one is understanding it
1324465510654922757 2020-11-06 05:35:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Covid 19 is leaving..never hear about it after the 4th..yet one more lie..but this is maybe the most serious lie
1324465240151629825 2020-11-06 05:34:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SPMcKenny @ReallyAmerican1 Smile music with  smiles created by people. Go America!!
1324464192636755975 2020-11-06 05:30:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Far as anyone knows, no illegal or late votes Sorry keep trying ..one day you will understand it is all over but the counting..no more drama needed. @IngrahamAngle why do you help him? Do you really believe him? Not likely, looks like you are humoring him
1324449943583674369 2020-11-06 04:34:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i still feel sorry for him..even though he invited every bit..because he does not understand he has
1324449647021142019 2020-11-06 04:32:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just hanging on by fingernails
1324449453772779522 2020-11-06 04:32:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not listening to bernie or aoc
1324449300441608194 2020-11-06 04:31:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't believe you are either or what he said. Think more opinion than fact..would be nice though
1324421953285955599 2020-11-06 02:42:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A liar and cheat by any name is still a liar and cheat
1324421694015053824 2020-11-06 02:41:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do the lies stop or will they stop after he leaves..or anytime?
1324421178920980480 2020-11-06 02:39:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They still lie and we still pay
1324420867208695809 2020-11-06 02:38:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looking at all this I wonder what she would do this time
1324392487293755393 2020-11-06 00:45:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden voters are not drama seekers and have respect for the flag
1324392353080201217 2020-11-06 00:45:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> drama not Biden thing..also respect for flag
1324389504053137408 2020-11-06 00:33:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not know any other words to describe the intelligence level of trumps believers.stupid and gullible
1324370833524097026 2020-11-05 23:19:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wouldn't that be nice..heaven on earth
1324355660608397313 2020-11-05 22:19:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bold or cowardly? Does not like what he sees, so bully ..it is old routine
1324352180493688832 2020-11-05 22:05:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> goosebumps
1324351992492396545 2020-11-05 22:04:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GO @JoeBiden
1324351809075449856 2020-11-05 22:04:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   Entitled to write his own election rules? Sounds like  a dictator if he could
1324351431961399298 2020-11-05 22:02:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In jail?
1324351244182425603 2020-11-05 22:01:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are ballots to be separated and put in piles? Black Americans, White Americans, Miscellaneous Americans? They count? They don't?  Yet in Florida he will tell Blacks and Hispanics how wonderful they are
1324350726009618432 2020-11-05 21:59:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or they can ignore it and say it is better
1324350550402543622 2020-11-05 21:59:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear Pretty sad, yes!
1324350392399003648 2020-11-05 21:58:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donald says everything is good
1324350233036361731 2020-11-05 21:57:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't think anyone thinks of elections as end of world..maybe what follows could be though
1324346370413727744 2020-11-05 21:42:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wow..is he a bigot? no, not much
1324337363263332354 2020-11-05 21:06:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was nothing. Glad to help.üò∑üòá
1324183453156429824 2020-11-05 10:55:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shelter was a centipede in disguise
1324183311036698625 2020-11-05 10:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good grief, they all have identity crises
1324183131092590592 2020-11-05 10:53:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They should be happy  they obeyed trump. they voted on election day, no mail ins..should make them all happy they are such followers
1324182832747524096 2020-11-05 10:52:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right, that is good
1324139410389127169 2020-11-05 08:00:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not mine we all voted Biden üò∑üòÖ
1324134999692595200 2020-11-05 07:42:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what a hero that bigot is..hope someone will volunteer to fix
1324132570720800768 2020-11-05 07:33:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not have anything much on it..but seeing the honesty there is so relaxing.
1324128466653106181 2020-11-05 07:16:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Total agreement with you
1324070246991470592 2020-11-05 03:25:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure they understand.  . You might ask the teacher to make clear student can call you with questions or you might  call and have a conference with the teacher and ask how you can help. But do not assume or blame this virus and the inconvenience,it is not their doing.
1324070245410197504 2020-11-05 03:25:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mom, I am not a teacher or related to one. No one likes co rona virus. But how dare you blame the teachers. They were not hired to work over the computer. I have no doubt that 99.5 percent of the teachers do the best they can. They cannot stand over your childs shoulder to make
1324068530820685824 2020-11-05 03:18:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still nice to see though
1324050853972615170 2020-11-05 02:08:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His plane was slow landing.
1324050710376423424 2020-11-05 02:07:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Indictments are good.
1324040026762739712 2020-11-05 01:25:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope he means "someones "may have to pay
1324039882193412096 2020-11-05 01:24:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like he is including everyone..no exceptions
1324039564659482631 2020-11-05 01:23:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ..and democracy
1324039141798141955 2020-11-05 01:21:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not alone
1324039029155921920 2020-11-05 01:21:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jail cells only so big..maybe put them all next to each other
1324038630726316035 2020-11-05 01:19:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can relate..waiting for final counts
1324035000849911811 2020-11-05 01:05:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt!!
1324018948258541574 2020-11-05 00:01:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seemingly, sabotage stopped and  democracy saved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan
1324013704984305671 2020-11-04 23:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòä
1324012173690130442 2020-11-04 23:34:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> let's count ...1, 2,3,4,5,6 ..ballots for Biden then they continued. That is the explanation ..hope you understood
1323993759651143680 2020-11-04 22:21:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be wonderful ...but waiting (im)patiently
1323993602402492417 2020-11-04 22:20:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> worst part is he is not even president for anyone but himself..and his followers will go right off cliff because they believe him. Anti american and yet the results are not yet clear.
1323993139502370817 2020-11-04 22:18:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now if rest would follow would be a fantastic day
1323992715105832963 2020-11-04 22:17:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> From your mouth to G-ds ear
1323990717467906048 2020-11-04 22:09:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Noticed the worry with my grandkids..they do not want trump ..Hope your sons prayer comes happens. Still requiring patience though
1323946556723265536 2020-11-04 19:13:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hit send on wrong tweet..and now I am removing it OOPSüòä

1323945982313271299 2020-11-04 19:11:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A democracy that like the Wizard of Oz, people need to see behind the curtain

1323945618503589890 2020-11-04 19:10:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you don't win, I would like to understand how this happened
1323834954476904453 2020-11-04 11:50:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All I know is it still seems something smells fishy..all the indoctrination to how fake this would be and it would be democrats that are guilty of dirty deeds he said  We know trump projects what he is doing on to the dems always
1323811906973536258 2020-11-04 10:18:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe it is just me but something looks fishy to me

1323680594581217280 2020-11-04 01:37:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> excellent
1323675843349151744 2020-11-04 01:18:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> totally excellent..do you have sign on vehicle says ride to polls if you are pro Biden?

1323630306457509889 2020-11-03 22:17:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That method was also used by Goebbels-propaganda minister to hitler. His method was tell a lie often enough and it becomes truth.
1323629844731777024 2020-11-03 22:15:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure hope we can.
1323629722081894401 2020-11-03 22:14:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @donwinslow  Thank you for these videos.
1323628612642394112 2020-11-03 22:10:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only two bowls? Not very filling. You will be back to digging up more in an hour.
1323628330957025280 2020-11-03 22:09:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fantastic..problem is, sadly trump fans wont watch it.unless they are in the mood to be honest with themselves and that is not their thing right now.
1323450742657658881 2020-11-03 10:23:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even big fat juicy worms?
1323440783610044417 2020-11-03 09:44:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tomorrow a party in the white house ..2 or 300 people in a room that never saw politics in it..all close together and prob as usual no masks..he just does not care. I suppose at least Dr Birx finally realized she should have done something
1323440344357314567 2020-11-03 09:42:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump just does not care..wish Dr Birx spoke up earlier
1323439921084964865 2020-11-03 09:40:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gotta luv the guy who does not have guts to sign his name

1323439330539589632 2020-11-03 09:38:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Know that feeling.
1323435963008405505 2020-11-03 09:24:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @marcorubio        are those really patriots? one who loves and supports his or her country ‚Ä¶ praised him as a ‚Ä¶ motivated patriot who was fearless in the quest to preserve American security.
1323430818577059840 2020-11-03 09:04:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is no hunter biden story and voters are too educated to get them to vote trump or change the Speaker
1323430611164532737 2020-11-03 09:03:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot stand seeing what donald has done to this flag
1323430442817753090 2020-11-03 09:03:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Home grown terrorism like the ones that came out of the woods saying antisemitic and insane comments but donald said good people on both sides.
1323429991456133120 2020-11-03 09:01:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kayleighmcenany Not likely he is..just projecting his voice, but, we know Donnie yells
1323429054071144450 2020-11-03 08:57:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump Refugees are not bad people. Even your grandparents were refugees.
1323401114776227842 2020-11-03 07:06:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they have always and will always make excuses for anything he does that is why he thought being a dictator was fine. No one said no
1323400857032032258 2020-11-03 07:05:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> President Biden would hire him back..if the paperwork was  completed by trump for Dr Fauci by the time President Biden was sworn in
1323399749001715712 2020-11-03 07:01:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This might be my very favorite
1323399396042690561 2020-11-03 06:59:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure he did NOT
1323399322633965577 2020-11-03 06:59:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do you think he is so desperate. Seems he has good reason to be fearful so does the rest of his family
1323398732243738624 2020-11-03 06:56:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably so
1323398681995989004 2020-11-03 06:56:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening and agree
1323391539230494721 2020-11-03 06:28:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You really should stop spreading fake information
1323391269004083200 2020-11-03 06:27:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> some intelligence officer
1323390790215835650 2020-11-03 06:25:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Problem is citizens want 2 states
1323389646034841602 2020-11-03 06:20:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üôèü§≠üòä By donald
1323370561033146368 2020-11-03 05:05:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But trump does not want that to be true
1323370284888526853 2020-11-03 05:03:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be proud of them
1323370177975721984 2020-11-03 05:03:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is not the media that  manipulated it, it is the person who did not say it was not recent
1323369958202552320 2020-11-03 05:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> unlike trump we can TRUST BIDEN   VOTE @JoeBiden
1323369637178970112 2020-11-03 05:01:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You truly need to check your sources
1323368567551741953 2020-11-03 04:57:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not surprised. People were discussing it online yesterday. Wish people had enough brains to check
1323365504388648962 2020-11-03 04:44:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Democracy in Texas seems alive and well
1323358521799413761 2020-11-03 04:17:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At least most Karens have more sense
1323350546724642819 2020-11-03 03:45:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is worse
1323349933844533248 2020-11-03 03:43:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Depends where in country you are, how safely you do it and if masks are worn
1323341463560855555 2020-11-03 03:09:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I mention a coward who wants to be dictator?
1323341353342873601 2020-11-03 03:08:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mr, don't you have any respect for your customers or your help?  How will you feel if someone gets sick or even dies because you listen to trump and ignore facts?
1323326701934465025 2020-11-03 02:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Donald and his ducks lie and people die. Cannot believe so many are so gullible and care so little
1323326422534955008 2020-11-03 02:09:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The servers have the freedom to live without Covid ..and the customers have the choice of eating there or not. If the servers are so unimportant to that man, walk out
1323325399275896834 2020-11-03 02:05:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same sort of president that lies about everything, runs away from responsibility..A COWARD
1323319463635230720 2020-11-03 01:42:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why don't you fact check his accomplishments..see what really got finished and dont consider all those deaths and illness because he did it his way..and do not count he does not believe in science..so rolled all obama environmental changes..see shape earth is in.
1323314653762650113 2020-11-03 01:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good lord , must be trump rally or something..he is talking about suppression and blaming it on media and democrats. Still everyone but him..He makes my skin crawl with his lies
1323290797266083841 2020-11-02 23:48:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder where the money came from?
1323290611286507525 2020-11-02 23:47:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Out of touch with reality? Anyone tell him if he wanted childish games he should go back to 3rd grade?
1323290355194843140 2020-11-02 23:46:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So true so disgusting...........VOTE BLUE
1323290014801952768 2020-11-02 23:44:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ProjectLincoln   You have done an amazingly good deed. Thank you!
1323289767652532226 2020-11-02 23:44:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It has abandoned all principles  comparatively long ago which is why he has to go now
1323289426378870786 2020-11-02 23:42:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is his plan but if he is voted out..he will go out
1323288751670513665 2020-11-02 23:39:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If trump had the right to tell us who the winner is..that would mean he is  a dictator..keep counting he does not have that right
1323254191268253697 2020-11-02 21:22:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps he has a good reason for it that is none of our business?
1323239680868032513 2020-11-02 20:24:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump really does hate facts and truth..but Dr Fauci does not. That is why we respect Dr Fauci.
1323238630240997376 2020-11-02 20:20:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would disagree, Biden is not boring. donald is boring, after enough of a tv show it can be turned off. Can't turn off the reality  donald show.
1323238143663972355 2020-11-02 20:18:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if there is any part of reality he is still connected too
1323237732756393985 2020-11-02 20:17:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump yelling make america great..does not make America great..getting Covid under control will put the country back on road to great.. and that is not voting for trump VOTE BLUE
1323236960241131521 2020-11-02 20:14:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mean of them put you in jail-particularly now
1323236805135781888 2020-11-02 20:13:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Vote @JoeBiden  and blue all the way down the line.
1323236613493764096 2020-11-02 20:12:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant find good people on both sides..trump people should know right from wrong..maybe no one taught them that voting is a right and they are interfering as they try to intimidate ..just bullying
1323235856912703488 2020-11-02 20:09:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§û
1323100452427341824 2020-11-02 11:11:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought it could be a last ditch effort at more lies and fake news..üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1323100111497424901 2020-11-02 11:10:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o gees when do they stop
1323100016802779139 2020-11-02 11:10:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he really think he can hide inside and no one can get him?
1323099872287952896 2020-11-02 11:09:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This needs to be illegal
1323099485531181056 2020-11-02 11:07:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like more than that..wondering what it is
1323099352924127234 2020-11-02 11:07:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is the epitome of  the terrorists, anarchists and agitators, white supremacists involved in burning He supports and encouraes it .question is will there be charges for it?
1323098677167181830 2020-11-02 11:04:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It has been made a country for trump and his base and supporters, not for all. I can relate to what you say this is like nothing I ever saw before. I disagree tho, I do not think less harmful than the 50s. Just fewer scars on the outside
1323098220143194112 2020-11-02 11:02:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When does this nonsense stop? Conspiracy theorists and others in outer space still believe it
1323092356778917889 2020-11-02 10:39:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice thing about CNN is they give facts and you can check them out and make up your own mind.  You should try it @kirstiealley
1323092057917968384 2020-11-02 10:38:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kirstiealley  I do not feel terrorized..do not know anyone that does. If you like facts and watch CNN it is not terrorism it is reality
1323091407905673216 2020-11-02 10:35:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Believe him as much as trump
1323089260581445632 2020-11-02 10:27:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At least a lot of those flags are gone. They degrade them by abusing their use
1323089080138276869 2020-11-02 10:26:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Little puppies without a brain of their own
1323088648775106562 2020-11-02 10:24:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> covid kicking in again?
1323083086897254402 2020-11-02 10:02:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how many cant figure it out
1323082945851174913 2020-11-02 10:02:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fidel must be up and walking around the graveyard so he can control Joe...trump is such a lying moron
1323080948108414983 2020-11-02 09:54:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is a scary situation.
1323080380241641474 2020-11-02 09:51:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Coincidence? Not likely
1323068576400609282 2020-11-02 09:05:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope barr and trump stay out of it
1323068381646512128 2020-11-02 09:04:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh no. So very sad. Truly sorry. In my thoughts. Hang in better days are coming.  üôè
1323067766392426496 2020-11-02 09:01:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting ..how would he feel if he was late to the polls because of idiocy like that..but wait has he voted? Does he plan too? Doubt it
1323067378633244672 2020-11-02 09:00:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is he getting free ad space? Probably loving it feeling rather smug. Hope he is facing charges
1323066924335538183 2020-11-02 08:58:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or spread anymore lies
1323066787328655365 2020-11-02 08:57:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is some  basic information the president of this country should know . Because he does not know,, add to the reasons not fit to be president
1323066368120541185 2020-11-02 08:56:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure hope he is going to be facing charges

1323065775540887552 2020-11-02 08:53:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So, he is also dictating how people SHOULD vote to please him
1323060660217982982 2020-11-02 08:33:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never seen as bad as this..but anytime voting issues 99 out of 100 are republicans
1323060360908328961 2020-11-02 08:32:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is why people wanted to come here from all over the world, why my grandparents came here
1323060191584264194 2020-11-02 08:31:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JustMeUK25 @JerryBruv @JoeBiden The ideal was great and is great..what trump did had nothing great about it
1323059635490856960 2020-11-02 08:29:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I used to feel sorry for him..but anytime along the way ,he could have chosen differently..
1323056135604117504 2020-11-02 08:15:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Beautiful moon but who is there that will not be here to attend another rally in a month
1323051718167453697 2020-11-02 07:58:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ask the farmers and the manufacturers. Do not know about the scientists
1323051426810105865 2020-11-02 07:56:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not want to go to jail
1323047400538279936 2020-11-02 07:40:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just say @realDonaldTrump  SHUT UP
1323047056194371586 2020-11-02 07:39:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shows how he twists facts ..one more example of trump propaganda
1323046828598792199 2020-11-02 07:38:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he could find another crooked scheme
1323045994922233856 2020-11-02 07:35:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I blame him for not paying attention to Obama/Biden plan and for getting rid of his team in the white house.  I also blame him for not saying PUT ON A MASK, I blame him for rallies, I blame him for hiding Fauci, yes I blame him  https://t.co/OA2oK0TL8O‚Ä¶
1323045993462538241 2020-11-02 07:35:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Question was is Trump blamed. I do not know if he brought Covid here or not. But he knew and did nothing for a few months. I blame him for that,
1323044108202614784 2020-11-02 07:27:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Voted Biden/Harris
1323043817981988866 2020-11-02 07:26:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Keep repeating it @govchristie..along with just how it felt
1323043575328899074 2020-11-02 07:25:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not let him sucker you again
1323043499529408514 2020-11-02 07:25:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only ones really benefited are the top percent with some trickledown not enough to matter
1323043324715032576 2020-11-02 07:24:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Key is..they do not think
1323043153151250432 2020-11-02 07:24:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He still has too many red. particularly because of what he says tonight about attempting to grab the win like a dictator in a third world country (he did not use that expression, I did). Way to many red
1323036000185163778 2020-11-02 06:55:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Fauci most of the country supports you and find this president despicable. We count on you for truth even when it is bad. Thank you
1323035368678187009 2020-11-02 06:53:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WOW just before election day how cool is that...does not say when they will arrive either
1323035027253452801 2020-11-02 06:51:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WHINE WHINE TRUMP IS SO AFRAID HE WILL LOSE..he makes me sick
1323025692733378563 2020-11-02 06:14:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all he does is get more criminal like and off the rails..so not likely
1323025539234410496 2020-11-02 06:14:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is what dictators do. the rest of us wait and do it honestly and fairly
1323025255347212288 2020-11-02 06:12:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump tell them to go home..tell them to behave like adults
1323025092486569987 2020-11-02 06:12:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is a disgrace to this country..but trump voters think it is impressive..it is not, it is an embarrassment
1323024754748592129 2020-11-02 06:10:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Am sure nothing better to do with taxpayer money then have cops on standby. But, trump thinks sending the babies out  make him look good. They just look like infants just infants
1323023268815740939 2020-11-02 06:05:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope they got where they wanted to be
1323005066547240960 2020-11-02 04:52:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IntegrityIsDead Kid you not..how much integrity can they have?
1323004303875985410 2020-11-02 04:49:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Atlas has needed to be gone for a long time. Now he emphasizes how badly and quickly he needs to be gone
1323004094588637185 2020-11-02 04:48:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SandiAnthony1 Hope @JoeBiden has his raincoat. Sure is wet out there
1323003780334571521 2020-11-02 04:47:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But, where is your mask?
1323003665175728128 2020-11-02 04:47:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just looks like a lot because he makes so  much noise and incites them to be like him
1322994683056922624 2020-11-02 04:11:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He promises whatever he believes will elect him..follow through is another story
1322994500088811520 2020-11-02 04:10:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad FBI is investigating harassment of Biden bus that trump endorsed

1322969897551482885 2020-11-02 02:32:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when the post-gazette says he gets things done..do they mean he spreads the virus and causes chaos?

1322962457254649857 2020-11-02 02:03:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to stop people from expressing opinions and then praise the trump vehicles that did it..is totally unamerican. More totalitarian ..we do not need that person as president
1322950523704758280 2020-11-02 01:15:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would trumps radiologist appear on russian state tv from the white house?

1322942353787801606 2020-11-02 00:43:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also, refusing to allow people to vote is stealing an election  and rights of the people

1322940929616023553 2020-11-02 00:37:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What trump means is Biden does not have to have people laugh at him for entertainment or rev up the crowd with lies, does not have to divide people and people get honesty. No chaos, no hate, very boring. But look who is ahead in the polls.Someone who lets us know him and knows us
1322931165590937600 2020-11-01 23:59:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes donald only one reason , only one person (the one who ignored it to rally and golf)

1322521162883149825 2020-10-31 20:49:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is no way trump has earned a second term, should have found a way to eject him during first term, however, everyone is entitled to support whomever they wish to support.  I think boycotting Home Depot would be ridiculous
1322372177316950016 2020-10-31 10:57:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How about the lives of 2 40,000+ lives do they count? Isn't that prolife and isn't there a moral and constitutional obligation to care for them ..instead of ignoring the rallies that cause death or disease, what about ignoring the first 3 months of the virus was that covered?
1322363595963977729 2020-10-31 10:23:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hi..did she see it? Oh so cute. So many nights..5 more sleeps  VOTE puppy
1322308233969700868 2020-10-31 06:43:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree but thought orange on the outside, yellow on the inside but should be tossed out in early November
1322307921066315776 2020-10-31 06:42:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump said 3 weeks and Joe Biden will be shot and Kamala wlil take over. I commented about this at that time and do not know why it is still there.
1322307548050063361 2020-10-31 06:41:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wtg pregnant lady. Hope you and baby are fine.
1322306994238271489 2020-10-31 06:38:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Surprised those numbers have not been hidden away. Wondering of trump knows how many see and use those numbers to keep track
1322304101280002050 2020-10-31 06:27:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be great if  you gave an inch or two to tell why the report is being reported if it is not covered in the way you do it now

1322303137986826241 2020-10-31 06:23:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Madame Toussads knows exactly where trump belongs
1322298742465269761 2020-10-31 06:06:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would like to stomp, but, better angels say no..so instead I would throw him a jacket tell him to stay warm
1322298477766971394 2020-10-31 06:04:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jr sober up
1322285902694141954 2020-10-31 05:15:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have you checked the rest of the commandments?
1322285686611972096 2020-10-31 05:14:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt there is anything he follows the Bible on ..probably never opened one to read it
1322285483737665536 2020-10-31 05:13:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump lies, kayleigh swears to it ..then  James               Woods compliments. So great ..emperor has no clothes but please go vote

1322282000041103362 2020-10-31 04:59:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I oppose abortion for me. I do not oppose free choice for others. I would not attempt to dictate to the  women in this country what they should do . Ivanka should not try to tell others and neither should her father or the Supreme Court
1322281246102343686 2020-10-31 04:56:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She must mean only babies deserve to live.. even if the mother has no way to care for them or if rape victim, or 12 years old
1322280208662208517 2020-10-31 04:52:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't have to worry those that support trump have no idea what that word means..rest of us do..so will be a lot of Biden voters
1322235960466280449 2020-10-31 01:56:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden has no need to hold 17 rallies in 4 days..no one can legitimately have 17 rallies in 4 days..do not believe that of even a guy that uses a golf cart to get around
1322233241487761413 2020-10-31 01:45:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unlike trump, Biden is not desperate. Do not know about Bidens energy,stamina and drive..do know about his common sense and sanity though.
1322226567947452423 2020-10-31 01:19:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you hate, love division and are a fearful bigot..vote for trump ..other than that, he has nothing to offer

1322218099580559361 2020-10-31 00:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If that woman in the picture is who you refer too..maybe because it is not melania?
1322217016372199425 2020-10-31 00:41:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> List is probably miles long.
1322216139531997184 2020-10-31 00:37:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whoever has decided to stay home because your candidate looks like he/she is winning..........VOTE -no vote or 3rd party votes are the same as saying I want trump.
1322215765853016068 2020-10-31 00:36:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needs to stop paying attention to his father.

1322213131041542150 2020-10-31 00:25:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that child is such an embarrassment
1322212662961442819 2020-10-31 00:23:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> a selfish child who never learned honesty, compassion, ethics. or that he cant always get his own way
1322182055418040324 2020-10-30 22:22:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is sad
1322181703843172354 2020-10-30 22:20:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You devalue toast. I like toast.
1322181433859829768 2020-10-30 22:19:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Somehow I think that would be a great idea!

1322011263019470848 2020-10-30 11:03:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks to me like  he uses his time very strategically

1322000661987401728 2020-10-30 10:21:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can hope Florida goes Blue. No vote is a vote for trump, 3rd party is vote for trump.Just know Floridians cannot sit home. If they have not voted, they need too..and I hope it is Blue.

Think should go..just carefully. Maybe long tube kids can take with them and ask people to drop the candy in a tube that goes into a bag??

That they are two different people, one a tv entertainer, the other a stable, ethical, honest, dependable, fair person. Biden does what is right for all, trump for himself?  So you are trying to tell us they are not clones of each other? good thing

1321240558426378241 2020-10-28 08:01:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes he could be ...but who says it is Giuliani
1321240373180698627 2020-10-28 08:00:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TwitterSupport  each time i try to report trumps violent tweet..i wind up reporting someone else. I ONLY WANT TO REPORT DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS COMMENT ABOUT JOE IS SHOT IN 3 weeks
1321239813891231745 2020-10-28 07:58:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THIS IS NO JOKE
1321239603593007105 2020-10-28 07:57:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TwitterSupport  I was just made to report someone I did not want to report. I wanted to report donald trump but it did not work..donald said  3 weeks joe is shot come on kamala ..then something about most liberal
1321238366164258816 2020-10-28 07:52:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if that is legal we are in more serious trouble then I imagined

1321234993864187904 2020-10-28 07:39:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to trump discuss how he is watching Gov Wolf ..he is insane

1321212471739383809 2020-10-28 06:09:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MELANIATRUMP  then you should convince your husband to give the kids a better display of political responsibility, honesty , humanity ,and fairness. Democrats have been showing a better display of all the characteristics

1321195089838936064 2020-10-28 05:00:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are you saying trump would lie? üòå can't be so

1321194389671215107 2020-10-28 04:57:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How does one take away electoral college vote for Biden
1321192835362803712 2020-10-28 04:51:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not voting is a bad excuse ..no vote is a vote for trump
1321187291600199680 2020-10-28 04:29:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How are you? I am trying not to be a wreck or to get too excited
1321187137996337152 2020-10-28 04:28:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that the same person as Joe Biden?
1321159453580939271 2020-10-28 02:38:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Describe donald trump in one sentence:.donald trump only  cares about donald trump.
1321158874867638273 2020-10-28 02:36:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Economy was about to be screwed up..cant remember the facts but do remember that

1321144395874344960 2020-10-28 01:39:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ProjectLincoln Did the handshaker have the feeling he needed to scrub the grease and filth off?
1321144212969181188 2020-10-28 01:38:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess has lot of experience in trying for drama.
1321142692236218376 2020-10-28 01:32:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump needs to keep having these rallies and proving his love and respect for all the new covid patients, even those that died and wont hear
1321142096259129349 2020-10-28 01:29:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He knows he is beaten
1321140261427306499 2020-10-28 01:22:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just read this in todays NYT: Barrett is swiftly sworn in, as Democrats fume. I do not believe it just Democrats, I believe it is Republicans and Independents that comprise that 70 or so percent against Barrett.
1321139578644946945 2020-10-28 01:19:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How can everything get done that you want to accomplish with everything in such a mess and raise pay to 15.00 an hour. Have to catch up with ourselves first I would think
1321133297913733128 2020-10-28 00:54:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We understand it, you cannot expect trump or his followers even want or try to understand it

1321132108606222340 2020-10-28 00:50:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DemWrite @ReallyAmerican1 @JoeBiden @PACRONYM Did put a smile on my face..thanks for it
1321131601552646146 2020-10-28 00:48:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heard President Obama in Florida..very nicely done..if there were reservations about getting out the vote for Biden..thinking they no longer exist
1321121897027903488 2020-10-28 00:09:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His biggest thing is..he wants to avoid jail ..by staying in office he can do that
1321121738638397440 2020-10-28 00:09:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> TEXAS, VOTE BLUE PLEASE!!!!!
1321121537836130305 2020-10-28 00:08:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yeah he did that ..and then there is covid19, all those dead people and all those children separated at the border..Wondering how many other promises he kept.
1321121270277222404 2020-10-28 00:07:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad you woke up. Now I hope you will go out and vote blue
1321092236831006736 2020-10-27 22:11:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they wanted to keep trump happy. doubt they had any idea of anything other than keep trump happy . trump is happy hope they are too..even when trump is out of office  and all those people who put her through will be voted out of office, she will still in on court decision making.
1321091612756353028 2020-10-27 22:09:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just so qualified
1321091138112114691 2020-10-27 22:07:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and..around the world, the USA would still get some respect
1321090450623746049 2020-10-27 22:04:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What makes her qualified? The president now has someone to do his bidding?
1321090168875634690 2020-10-27 22:03:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At this point cannot do much without removing trump.

1320914797848920065 2020-10-27 10:26:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Beg pardon @JoeBiden is unlike your fearless leader. He does not hold super spreaders. He cares about the people. He had a small event in PA today..thought you might want to know.
1320914417920495616 2020-10-27 10:25:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and no doubt, he is proud of himself
1320907040127111168 2020-10-27 09:55:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good lord just hope you  use votes not trump tactics
1320906861206511617 2020-10-27 09:55:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe I am wrong but I don't think his position will take long to appear..but my question is if he does not will you vote trump?
1320906662711119875 2020-10-27 09:54:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure, until trump has someone tell her what they want
1320906431466491904 2020-10-27 09:53:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Alyssathe1st @tammybuffkin @funder @MeidasTouch Afraid I agree. Everything trump has touched turns into a political football. He has now done it to the Supreme Court. What happens when trump leaves ?
1320891928670539781 2020-10-27 08:55:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The man was more qualified and experienced than anyone trump has stuck in there. Read the full story then understand.  https://t.co/VQ7FmipWfA.
1320881450875559937 2020-10-27 08:14:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wants her there to support his agenda..using her title for political purposes
1320880306417750016 2020-10-27 08:09:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You forgot to let him pardon him for that hairdo
1320879850874261504 2020-10-27 08:07:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will be nice to see the white house back to being the White House and the president returning to be the President
1320878900508086273 2020-10-27 08:04:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All I think about is, he is so desperate
1320877946979164162 2020-10-27 08:00:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @funder @MeidasTouch Shame on Amy Coney Barrett. She could have asked for a postponement and the fact that she did not says she knows the political intent
1320865914800246784 2020-10-27 07:12:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump decided nothing counts but what he wants. Hell with consequences
1320865329682276354 2020-10-27 07:10:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Luv that
1320865165718347782 2020-10-27 07:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SenCoryGardner are pandemics also a good time to celebrate? Do you think anyone might spread Covid to any of the guests there?
1320864901611593732 2020-10-27 07:08:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sad @corygardner had nothing else for you to think about..but tell me..did donald pat you on the head? more people died today..more people are going to sleep hungry
1320864635243941890 2020-10-27 07:07:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would be nice if some of those people would forget party and think Constitution, country and division
1320832600894808074 2020-10-27 05:00:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is the point of this..said days ago..maybe I am missing something but seems senseless to go over and over it. I think more important things to discuss and worry about
1320831835614679043 2020-10-27 04:57:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I read plan is to fire more than a couple people if he wins but wondering what happens if he loses?
1320803918025285632 2020-10-27 03:06:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We need SANITY vote Blue

1320764113589542912 2020-10-27 00:27:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Isn't it odd to hear an adult speak? I am proud to have voted for him too..bet a lot more are thinking that very same thing
1320737629302853632 2020-10-26 22:42:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just make sure to root, root, root for the home team as you eat those pecans and almonds and hazelnuts and cashews, and pistachios you bought

1320734670535958528 2020-10-26 22:30:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Might want to remember how daddy called Gaetz ‚ÄúRick‚Äù more than once in a speech last week
1320734016639803397 2020-10-26 22:28:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Talk to donald let him relate how normally insane he has made this country
1320733722786844672 2020-10-26 22:27:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He means (and I am ashamed to say this) white boys like him do not want them to be successful.
1320733380045135872 2020-10-26 22:25:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Had trump been honest about Covid19 from the start, by now we might have stopped talking about it and no one would blame trump for letting it get this big
1320733113937465344 2020-10-26 22:24:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gave himself more drama
1320732649409970176 2020-10-26 22:22:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Then there is your daddy who  called Gaetz ‚ÄúRick‚Äù more than once in a speech last week
1320732193023578113 2020-10-26 22:21:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LesleyRStahl  Did you really think there would be a health plan in that stack of papers? If so, you might be the only one.
1320711684332359681 2020-10-26 20:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He makes so many mistakes they are forgettable.  He calls states and people by  wrong names. His mistakes, insults, confusion are supposed to be forgiven and forgotten, after all,  HE IS TRUMP
1320710989919195136 2020-10-26 20:56:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What 'cha got?
1320698257576742912 2020-10-26 20:06:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have to think tenants have more sense than to believe a trump supporter who happens to own a building or two. They can see it is propaganda to scare them and keep them from voting for Biden.
1320695566444253184 2020-10-26 19:55:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We think and know some (many) republicans are endorsing and voting for @JoeBiden because of what donald has done to this country and the world.

1320535089789415426 2020-10-26 09:17:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you ask him, he is least racist lol

1320492413606072322 2020-10-26 06:28:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Needs to vote for 4 years of trump? Be serious, needs obedience to trump not to country? Need obedience to donald so he does not have a temper tantrum? Needs 4 more years of me,me, me.Sorry, Biden is a better idea,unlike donald he cares.
1320491616071782400 2020-10-26 06:25:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorta sounds like Biden speech..except the lies..but he sounds more dramatic in a monotone. At least he does not turn my stomach to listen to him just sounds Biden. Even ran to the stage.
1320475309477629960 2020-10-26 05:20:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Poor you @gregkellyusa ..do you really believe the tripe you write or you trying to score brownie points?

1320416127814516736 2020-10-26 01:25:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lot of things that have happened in this country in the last 3 and half years have been unamerican
1320415531493720064 2020-10-26 01:22:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My kingdom for judge-my career for a judge, I adore my president so will get the judge in.She is more important than I am. Go Amy ..then there is the will of the people, abortions&amp; insurance and all the rest that are not nearly as important as Barrett.Might have been fine if fair
1320366068460904450 2020-10-25 22:06:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sigh..you want concern for the people? What is the matter with you?

1320342080393236481 2020-10-25 20:30:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yikes another trump distraction..no there there that would be real?
1320341789245489155 2020-10-25 20:29:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought we were trying to get rid of the trump name..and sons say they consider running?? No Ivanka or inlaws either!!! ü§£üòÇüò∑
1320340480819867648 2020-10-25 20:24:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only think if the Electoral College is abolished, at least they wont be busy trying to rush a Justice in .

1320196312348954624 2020-10-25 10:51:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is what patriotism looks like.
1320196223039643649 2020-10-25 10:51:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is beautiful to see
1320195838413594625 2020-10-25 10:49:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This says it all. I have not seen this before and am really glad I do see it. Hope never to have to see it again. Speaks volumes. ANYONE THAT HAS NOT VOTED, PLEASE VOTE BIDEN
1320195375546966017 2020-10-25 10:48:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we think HE can't go lower, he will find a way
1320195249826824192 2020-10-25 10:47:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just remind yourself you are better than that. Glad you are here now
1320195008960528384 2020-10-25 10:46:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I sent a 3 part tweet to donald dearest..1 part is here where are the rest?
1320192339533586432 2020-10-25 10:35:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant have thanksgiving dinner
1320192183920623616 2020-10-25 10:35:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lindsey anyone that intended to help you already knows, like donald, you kick them in the teeth..gee sorry your broke and begging is not helping
1320191711835004928 2020-10-25 10:33:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just want him gone
1320191223232159745 2020-10-25 10:31:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I blame his puppets maybe even more than him  Now they want Amy Coney to be pushed through just to please him. Why do these congressmen voted in by their constituents get ignored? Where are the peoples rights?.
1320191222028357633 2020-10-25 10:31:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump describe how i feel. If republicans upheld their allegiance to the Constitution, flag and OFFICE of the president..none of this would be happening First kids at the border, no one said a thing.
1320191220061265934 2020-10-25 10:31:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  Saw my grands on skype tonight ,after we disconnected, I cried. Have not seen them since March. Republicans have encouraged all he has done, he knew and did not say a word. I try so hard not to use the hate word..it is not me.but I do not know how else to
1320188133460316161 2020-10-25 10:19:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wise words
1320188035238080512 2020-10-25 10:18:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is plain crazy
1320187857714241536 2020-10-25 10:18:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaltrump My sister died a couple of weeks ago. Covid was not mentioned and you are disgusting
1320187587852632064 2020-10-25 10:17:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If we think we cant go lower, he will find a way
1320187307723526145 2020-10-25 10:15:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MarkSZaidEsq @TheRickWilson @MarkSZaidPC @ProjectLincoln Can one inherit the yearning for lawsuits?
1320162609161797632 2020-10-25 08:37:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He worries about what is obvious? It is obvious this is a person with a crush on Ivanka..probably in the 17 yr old age range.
1320158228026695685 2020-10-25 08:20:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Promises made none kept
1320157962355302400 2020-10-25 08:19:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should make him look at some of these Covid 19videos and then walk him through a Covid wing.
1320157510502895616 2020-10-25 08:17:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No empathy but also why so many of his businesses went of business..no human qualities and no idea how to run a business
1320157102283902976 2020-10-25 08:15:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> uh!!! is this your Halloween joke?
1320156877188194304 2020-10-25 08:15:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then they stoop as low as donald. There is no need for that from anyone connected to @JoeBiden .
1320156602486370309 2020-10-25 08:13:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ProjectLincoln  https://t.co/5Nb54PRhch
1320155796844498944 2020-10-25 08:10:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wind kills birds and he cant go to the basement but he can go to the bunker
1320155548868804610 2020-10-25 08:09:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not see the flies chasing @JoeBiden
1320155393625042945 2020-10-25 08:09:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even flies know BS when they hear it
1320155278927663105 2020-10-25 08:08:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice ,he and Pence can have a contest. Flies are like dogs, good judges of character
1320154996646776832 2020-10-25 08:07:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is amazing.
1320154388741181441 2020-10-25 08:05:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hopefully when trump is out she will return to earth. So sorry.
1320154145157009414 2020-10-25 08:04:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Since trump, I have said the one who agrees with donald and does his bidding is not a patriot. That is the one who disagrees when trump is wrong  and who gives their allegiance to the Constitution,and country not a man or boy.Very well said, thank  you. https://t.co/0bKBhRJjB2
1320152454923694080 2020-10-25 07:57:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pretty odd since @JoeBiden said he would work as hard for those that do not support him as those that do.
1320152126539038727 2020-10-25 07:56:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MrJonCryer, your mom rocks. Hope she has voted by now
1320151185513467904 2020-10-25 07:52:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TheRealHoarse I wish him a long life..but not in office
1320151035068010497 2020-10-25 07:51:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mark Twain was a truly talented and  wise writer. Can you imagine your quote being repeated about 100 years or more later
1320149963544944641 2020-10-25 07:47:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt there are some in GOP who do not want to help him
1320149822989586436 2020-10-25 07:46:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would have to agree with you..after all if it were the stock market ..often, none of us would have to worry about food on the table

1320148997898731521 2020-10-25 07:43:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC     Maybe you should have been helping the Constitution and country above ALL ..
1320148640783097856 2020-10-25 07:42:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ghost_kitty So very,very sorry
1320124388633677824 2020-10-25 06:05:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Insanity..should be taken to court. That is probably illegal
1320124023997665283 2020-10-25 06:04:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> US Government will be providing masks for ALL USA school children  As they are for republicans? As it should be?
1320116124537769985 2020-10-25 05:33:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And the 2 state solution comes when? That is what the people want.
1320115374457823240 2020-10-25 05:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly
1320114681399443457 2020-10-25 05:27:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mail in and absentee..exactly same
1320114443448090625 2020-10-25 05:26:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So you thought voter fraud was funny?
1320114217710739462 2020-10-25 05:25:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was thinking was kidding but then I think of Sarah who lies a lot so who knows
1320114066967453696 2020-10-25 05:24:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must be his sense of humor? I hope
1320063053447180291 2020-10-25 02:02:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As of now we are not close to recovery in any direction..and covid19 is exploding again
1320062662856876033 2020-10-25 02:00:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> keep feeling hopeful,maybe it will happen
1320062493465640964 2020-10-25 01:59:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No 2 state solution and the common thought is no one knows how long Sudan peace will last. Hope it lasts and hope somehow a 2 state solution happens. That is what citizens there seem to want

1319996523527196673 2020-10-24 21:37:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> respect seemed mandatory
1319996038720225280 2020-10-24 21:35:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Money does not buy class or earn respect
1319995850022674435 2020-10-24 21:35:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice of you to verify that @joebiden is the right left person to be president. You have taught us that you and those you support are the right wrong for this country. When you say it ,we know it is not Joe Biden that is the defender for a corrupt status quo.
1319981031894691845 2020-10-24 20:36:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @tomiahonen Well thanks ...and you tell me. I sure can't tell you. I would need to understand to explain.
1319980786817388544 2020-10-24 20:35:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope Biden is the vote. A vote for anyone else or no one, is for trump
1319980696895692801 2020-10-24 20:34:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope Biden is the vote. A vote for anyone else is for trump
1319980070350573568 2020-10-24 20:32:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @tomiahonen Ok maybe allow was the wrong word. But still, do not get it  ü§≠üòä
1319972489880023041 2020-10-24 20:02:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The irony is probably lost on this GOP
1319972359642746882 2020-10-24 20:01:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should vote against lindsey graham because he forgot he swore allegiance to the Constitution not trump
1319967854226251777 2020-10-24 19:43:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @tomiahonen Obviously they are brainwashed. But, the part I do not understand is that so many feel so lost that they allow brainwashing to happen..I know the words, but it does not help me to understand.Did not even know that fox had that many viewers who approve of the behaviorDJT guilty of
1319956302085394432 2020-10-24 18:58:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I will never understand how it is only 8 points
1319955537258307584 2020-10-24 18:54:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Truth is offensive? I did not realize you can be sued for telling the truth! The new amerika
1319954764101189637 2020-10-24 18:51:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hayseed yellow?
1319833975066591232 2020-10-24 10:51:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You must  love trump and he must love you. Decency? is this a comedy?
1319822526667739141 2020-10-24 10:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not funny
1319821549671751680 2020-10-24 10:02:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just hope these people are at that rally to see what a real  freak looks like rather than debate voting for him
1319821295291387905 2020-10-24 10:01:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is insanely jealous of Obama and wants to make sure everyone remembers his name.ü§≠üòÉ
1319820747481796608 2020-10-24 09:59:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh they care, ask trump, they say they do..no masks ,no spacing..all signs of caring PATHETIC why would he want another term? So he could finish everyone off to become the authoritarian ruler?
1319817906818043905 2020-10-24 09:48:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> New breed of republicans are clueless
1319817684410945536 2020-10-24 09:47:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anything
1319805956910350338 2020-10-24 09:00:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is great, particularly if follow the links
1319804772606758913 2020-10-24 08:55:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice jet pack ..do they have stop signs or right away up there  when it gets crowded?
1319803678778396680 2020-10-24 08:51:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy to say, no doubt..must have totally deflated him..
1319793895727894528 2020-10-24 08:12:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dont be bashful, click the links inside.   https://t.co/MAjF342jda
1319789595610009601 2020-10-24 07:55:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you see this? @JoeBiden said he learned what trumps covid plan is and he put a link. So I went, and learned "The Trump plan to defeat the Coronavirus and reopen safely does not exist."
1319788621742985219 2020-10-24 07:51:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> IS this for serious?  lol "The Trump plan to defeat the Coronavirus and reopen safely does not exist."
1319788297271599105 2020-10-24 07:50:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thank you @realDonaldTrump how many people will die today because of you
1319788140798840832 2020-10-24 07:49:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not want a socialist president..female or otherwise ..interesting brain he has..but guess he approves of dictators..are they allowed to be females?
1319786803910615041 2020-10-24 07:44:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is easy, he can release his tax papers. He always could
1319786629003907077 2020-10-24 07:43:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope results were good
1319783214467133441 2020-10-24 07:30:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If only it were just a cold
1319783110695936001 2020-10-24 07:29:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad he is wearing a mask..as he gets people to jump even closer to each other. Really have to wonder the motive
1319781373427798016 2020-10-24 07:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just watched Dr. Fauci on CNN. Always worth watching. He sure is a diplomat
1319766136553164802 2020-10-24 06:22:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTE BLUE
1319743089951559681 2020-10-24 04:50:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not hear any demonizing. Heard room to come together..alternatives
1319733726855745541 2020-10-24 04:13:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does anyone care? Would not expect more out of him
1319733535796846593 2020-10-24 04:12:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a child and walking out, then showing the program are yet more examples. I do not want an overgrown spoiled brat in the white house..and I will wait to see 60 minutes until it shows
1319693134159351809 2020-10-24 01:32:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How bout Central Park 5 he decided were guilty so he took out ads in NYT asking for death penalty..5 were found not guilty via DNA-trump was sued by NYS and lost because he refused to rent to blacks..what a least racist person there is..never apologized to any one for anything.
1319661166306668544 2020-10-23 23:25:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do agree w/most of what Biden says &amp; I respect him, he respects us. Good enough reasons to vote for Biden
1319661164041830403 2020-10-23 23:25:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not have to agree w/everything Biden says or does. as long as I can freely express my opinions &amp; can depend on him to lead not hide in the bunker or fire everyone that disagrees w/him.
1319659457111011328 2020-10-23 23:18:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In trumps mind if he wishes it away , closes his eyes, he can make his world whatever he chooses
1319658150425972737 2020-10-23 23:13:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He said that for a long time
1319657872280723464 2020-10-23 23:12:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump did try to maintain a lower volume....but lied so much..Biden won
1319633209848745988 2020-10-23 21:34:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do they all look alike?
1319479118933708802 2020-10-23 11:21:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RickSantorum      Wonder about the lawsuits because trump refused to rent to blacks (he lost)
1319478830445268992 2020-10-23 11:20:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the expression is like that of a big balloon with a needle poking a hole in it
1319478576656297986 2020-10-23 11:19:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will be leaving soon ..next time there are debates, Joe and x will follow rules
1319476013022281729 2020-10-23 11:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is still a comedy routine in him somewhere.
1319475838644047872 2020-10-23 11:08:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great scorekeeper
1319475664131600385 2020-10-23 11:08:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt he even realizes it..just nothing but white in his world
1319475484934156289 2020-10-23 11:07:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is over and lost track of trumps lies
1319474929918763008 2020-10-23 11:05:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry you are truly unhappy. I thought she was pretty good ..not great but pretty good
1319415433280311297 2020-10-23 07:08:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @namelessism   I am sorry, hope you understand no malice..I am on your side..and already voted that way..It is a block party not bloc. If  this is working right you are the only one sees this.
1319413909556760579 2020-10-23 07:02:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jeezus..keep insulting Biden and riling the crowd trump
1319410456428224518 2020-10-23 06:49:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doesn't he realize that Hunter is not running so it does not matter?
1319408919362588673 2020-10-23 06:42:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Question is will trump stay? Will he answer questions or will he divert attention?
1319408756300632066 2020-10-23 06:42:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who (besides trump supporters who will believe anything)  no matter how concocted as long as anti Biden..but who cares or believes  anything you have to say
1319407723721723911 2020-10-23 06:38:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unlike Joe, trump is not transparent..but trump can lie well (until he backtracks and rescinds the lie)Am thinking Joe knows his son but Joe is still not running for anything. donald is
1319407104067801088 2020-10-23 06:35:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> waving bye bye to him
1319406843324760071 2020-10-23 06:34:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and no doubt it is for shock value..is he paid to show?
1319391485863858177 2020-10-23 05:33:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Really looks like kindergarten free for all
1319387573719080962 2020-10-23 05:18:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Sheriffs_FC @RepSwalwell @coachrickys @AC_DSAL @ACSOSheriffs @jp_in_nj

1319386868895649793 2020-10-23 05:15:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you can't sing..but nice try..seem to know that song better than National Anthem
1319386638460637186 2020-10-23 05:14:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> always liked the song
1319386429252882439 2020-10-23 05:13:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump Nice video
1319386199417651200 2020-10-23 05:12:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such caring about seniors..maybe he means he does not care if they get sick and die? no face masks no distance..but does not stop trump
1319380530757066752 2020-10-23 04:50:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she will be one of his excuses...my father had a great saying. no clue if original bt always liked it "everybody hates me nobody loves me, I will go out in the garden to dig worms"
1319362590464684032 2020-10-23 03:38:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I consider doing it but then I say to myself self..  how else could I take out my frustration with the clown and his believers..and so it stays. Must keep abreast until he is safely out of office. Will then hear about his issues on the news
1319362135965814784 2020-10-23 03:37:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps because fake news and /or propaganda? Take your pick. However, donald has paid taxes in China..a lot more than the 750. he paid here. Check it out.
1319338424223080451 2020-10-23 02:02:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> had to leave -gotta luv autofill
1319331261341700096 2020-10-23 01:34:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think somewhere along the way John Cardillo is not doing this to show anything but to start some trouble
1319330931136749569 2020-10-23 01:33:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this particular picture looks like it was photoshopped
1319330725376757763 2020-10-23 01:32:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They make their sons look like donald if they withhold affection and praise
1319330226955014144 2020-10-23 01:30:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just be fair, ask what he wants to asküò∑üòä
1319329732681486336 2020-10-23 01:28:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O donald, things are not looking good for you
1319329517949849606 2020-10-23 01:27:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe neurological issue?
1319329176898461696 2020-10-23 01:26:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have not seen it yet..but did he jump up and down and slap himself in the head?
1319328641285849088 2020-10-23 01:23:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same one we noticed had Covid19 could not take care of himself..and as Obama said.."how can he protect a country when he cant protect himself" that would be the guy frightened by questions
1319315783567147009 2020-10-23 00:32:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For the future, don't stop
1319314613025050631 2020-10-23 00:28:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Havent seen it yet but maybe covid or med side effects..or maybe a preexisting (before covid19) condition
1319314142788988931 2020-10-23 00:26:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> perhaps 45 minutes?
1319298881054756866 2020-10-22 23:25:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt as any good father,  Biden has kissed and hugged his children. Seriously doubt this is a real photo though
1319297779072643072 2020-10-22 23:21:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps he should look into Jeffrey and donalds relationships before he makes up stories about others.
1319297530849615872 2020-10-22 23:20:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why are jrs eyes so peculiar looking? Is he getting his energy and capability to lie from outside sources?
1319297200443297792 2020-10-22 23:18:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL
1319296767159042048 2020-10-22 23:17:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol  do not forget the courts closed down the university which was not a university at all. I think the leveraging has finally reached its limit with anything that is legit
1319296420868968449 2020-10-22 23:15:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have to agree, trump listens and then does what he wants with no regard to what he heard unless it agrees with what he wants
1319296150084648960 2020-10-22 23:14:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Christians have spoken out against trump/pence as have many organizations and religions.  It is Joe and Kamala show up and trump walks out
1319295103580635136 2020-10-22 23:10:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor jr..as delusional as your father ?
1319279354392707073 2020-10-22 22:08:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is more than one judge that has been passed rated "not qualifed" by the ABA  but this is trumps america. VOTE BLUE
1319279017887854593 2020-10-22 22:06:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lily livered cowards. Hope this backfires on every single republican involved Elections now or year from now have consequences
1319278637921701889 2020-10-22 22:05:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The people who went to the news..are all to smart to be intimidated or taken in by the landlord
1319278209951621121 2020-10-22 22:03:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he lied and tried to intimidate. Anyone with sense understands

1319277648263016451 2020-10-22 22:01:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I feel like in a 3rd world country and the dictator is steamrolling and ruling the courts. Every republican in there for whatever their reasons are terrified of him so do not have enough spine to stand up. Seems so wrong.
1319273687959232514 2020-10-22 21:45:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more qualified and experienced than this woman
1319265577362509825 2020-10-22 21:13:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very impressed by Prime Minister Babis comments and  actions  Much luck to the Czech Republic. Hope the people pay attention

1319261051423281152 2020-10-22 20:55:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That sentence says it all.
1319260862251716610 2020-10-22 20:54:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fox news gibberish? Guess next couple weeks be full of it....and since Hunter is not running no need to be attention. @JoeBiden is a decent honorable man
1319260238973894657 2020-10-22 20:52:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not so sure not photoshopped..but for a father to kiss his son and show love is normal in a normal household. Guess more I look,  this is photoshopped
1319258068622987266 2020-10-22 20:43:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is there now  a new method for determining jobless claims?

You can do it.Try a life saver peppermint. I still use them at times. Just need not to let down your will power,  drink a lot of water&amp; grapefruit juice also helps.

1319062342353768449 2020-10-22 07:45:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As we can see, the FBI , DNI and others are  looking to protect us from likes of Iran and Russia but who knows if they got anything from their emails or hacks
1319053396763119616 2020-10-22 07:10:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @KFILE Just want to wish you well and from experience I know , no matter how well it is going, you are probably scared half to death. Just pause and take a deep breath. It works. Take care of you. Best wishes to you and everyone on your team
1319045748823150592 2020-10-22 06:39:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not easily, but there are more of us that love this country and are determined to vote trump out then trumps cult who wants him to stay in.   We have hope. Thank you for your concern. That is how we cope. Hope. l

1319039838310510592 2020-10-22 06:16:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe he realized how sick in the head he has been behaving..

1319021547684855811 2020-10-22 05:03:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are a trump bot or supporter who is encouraged by Jr..you have a problem with truth
1319020469736165377 2020-10-22 04:59:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> great idea
1319017768172355591 2020-10-22 04:48:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very true!!!!!
1319001882526875649 2020-10-22 03:45:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is there anyone else to vote for?
1319001647281020932 2020-10-22 03:44:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad you got the drift of prageru
1318995446472335362 2020-10-22 03:19:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guessing he plans on either not showing or walking out. What a president

1318979086518259716 2020-10-22 02:14:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe again trump is making up his own version of the truth for release
1318978354633199622 2020-10-22 02:11:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If trump is so popular, why are their rifles at polling sites  with the trump banners out west
1318977528732811264 2020-10-22 02:08:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why does trump keep having the crowded rallies, not mandating masks? Does he really  believe  only seniors are worthy of dying and no one else is affected? Seniors have a right to live as do everyone else. I cannot believe his revenge paranoia goes this far.
1318969654489059328 2020-10-22 01:37:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Covid19 cases are increasing. Eventually everything will need to close down to get rid of this horrible virus and where will your companies be then
1318969130956001281 2020-10-22 01:35:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  "strong" men do not have to resort to hacking bodies, or strong-arming people to do their bidding.They do not focus on revenge. Strong men are just men who are sure of themselves and allow others to be themselves. You/your friends who deny "strongly" not strong.
1318923439240040448 2020-10-21 22:33:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC      aw he really is jealous and ..now he thinks this will ingratiate him among his supporters?
1318922142679879683 2020-10-21 22:28:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pay as much attention to his taunting of Leslie Stahl as I do to his taunting of everyone else..none
1318911706798739457 2020-10-21 21:47:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He just shows what a whiny spoiled brat he is..and he is too old to be whiny or spoiled  brat

1318590212944109569 2020-10-21 00:29:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is no corruption scandal. Pathetic you think lying is okay, but you are a trump thru and thru and I imagine you want to keep your hands in the purse too.Stand up for yourself do not be dragged in, you are in deep enough
1318586278984798208 2020-10-21 00:14:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No better way to determine if trump is real or an actor...look around, trump university great example..the nonexistent college that took peoples money without any credibility . Look it up..he has not changed from those days except maybe worse
1318584949918846984 2020-10-21 00:08:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he intentionally want to lose?
1318584772776648705 2020-10-21 00:08:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he really think he can walk down 5th avenue and shoot without penalty?
1318584400611856387 2020-10-21 00:06:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump No political affiliation. He is respected and trusted. Has worked under presidents of all political persuasions. Can you say any of that that about yourself? No, you listen to a radiologist and fox. Sad
1318584399013826561 2020-10-21 00:06:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump     Just listening to trump pumpkin spout about Dr Fauci..he commented how long Fauci has been there and was full of insults. Dr Fauci has been there for a long time..long enough that we know he does not stop learning and does want to help people.
1318582946098483207 2020-10-21 00:00:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So nice to see real Republicans still exist in this country, not all followers of the great orange pumpkin but people who put Constitution and country over the pumpkin. Thank you
1318574850517176322 2020-10-20 23:28:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no way

1318573726783471616 2020-10-20 23:24:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG Brock so sorry
1318573506439806976 2020-10-20 23:23:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Already answered so wont again..but lot of good reasons to vote for him üòÉ
1318554851534581760 2020-10-20 22:09:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was trying not to say it but ..you continued so I will..I like control of my own brain. Not judgment, except for just me.
1318554516162306049 2020-10-20 22:07:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is a name for him..no, there are names
1318554279528026119 2020-10-20 22:06:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear üòÉ
1318552028914876426 2020-10-20 21:57:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nothing under trump should shock you..which is why you should not close your eyes to it and if you are in the USA ..VOTE
1318551794734202885 2020-10-20 21:57:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is propaganda..on 2 channels around the clock. If you want it, you can search it out and fill your brain with their drivel. So far, always a choice.  We also have journalists and rag like newspapers. It depends what you want. Again, the choice is yours.
1318550005045731328 2020-10-20 21:49:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you for putting this into the sunlight
1318549077479596035 2020-10-20 21:46:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is doing everything he can to divert attention tho he wants the attention.  Everyone has investigated Hunter Biden, I wonder if that means he wants Barr to show his fealty to trump yet again
1318548521230938115 2020-10-20 21:43:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too many stupidly believe the orange, the public needs to know more about your patients and Covid..what they suffer , how they suffer and what Covid does.  .Then, what you say has to reach those who say trump is right, no covid or like flu and not fatal.Thanks for doing whatyoudo
1318546288061931525 2020-10-20 21:35:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to know if he ever paid any legal bill?
1318545887090647040 2020-10-20 21:33:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear Ok guess I asked for it..oh and now u finally said it..reefer I recognize..used that stuff once in my life..so cute names make it sound appealing but still pot.  Thanks! Freedom of choice and all that. Have a great day
1318545097936470024 2020-10-20 21:30:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More I stare at this and your willingness ..    Names for pot?
1318384201658474497 2020-10-20 10:51:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear I have no idea what you are talking about lol but enjoy them
1318384067436568581 2020-10-20 10:50:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @senSchumer  however, I am luckier than many who really need that money. I can just cut some food out..some do not have Social security survivors cushion to cut the food out. (I do not want that Judge either)
1318384065612054528 2020-10-20 10:50:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @senSchumer  I understand the frustration and anger but do you know grocery prices are going up like I have never seen before.. I am a lucky one  tho, not nearly enough because of how prices are going up,
1318382801230725122 2020-10-20 10:45:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> put that on the list of creditors that will never see a penny
1318382607705513984 2020-10-20 10:44:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear Sounds like a nightmare coming to life..but glad you like them
1318374066332618752 2020-10-20 10:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish i could donate more. For me I donated plenty  but compared to others not nearly as much as I would like too.. and üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èvoted blue and keep telling myself be last donation..then i do it again lol
1318373619966365696 2020-10-20 10:08:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why would we expect anything else?
1318369759956766721 2020-10-20 09:53:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well, since he is always in it for himself . and apparently does not want this virus to slow down.I would ask which pharma is seemingly in his pocket? Or how can he gain?
1318369379487080448 2020-10-20 09:52:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NO but it wont be his lack of trying
1318369206711308294 2020-10-20 09:51:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is trump really saying he does not want the pandemic to go away? I would need to wonder what shares of which stock would he make money off of?
1318368996723490816 2020-10-20 09:50:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No, never to be believed or trusted
1318368800753000448 2020-10-20 09:49:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure
1318368663464980481 2020-10-20 09:49:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How bout that
1318368478659792897 2020-10-20 09:48:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> depends on the part of PA but sure
1318368382421524480 2020-10-20 09:48:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump knows it but his base will believe him  (trump)not you so he keeps repeating it
1318368153748099073 2020-10-20 09:47:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> True even as kid someone needed to discipline him with that evil no word and put up with his temper tantrums and stick to it
1318367928178429952 2020-10-20 09:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump stuck in the 50s and 60s unless you count Hillary time
1318343527995183106 2020-10-20 08:09:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To be a republican you need to be a trumplikin so you will not have a bottom
1318342972732309506 2020-10-20 08:07:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhave a lot of handsüôã.. all of them stand with Dr Fauci

1318342608436027393 2020-10-20 08:05:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How too pick one?
1318342388360896512 2020-10-20 08:04:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what sort of pose is that?
1318342165748133888 2020-10-20 08:04:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will that be donalds excuse to not show?
1318342016871387136 2020-10-20 08:03:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump  happy be kind to others week or whatever week you want to call but did not mean at all
1318336289071075334 2020-10-20 07:40:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò∑üòÄ
1318336044941660166 2020-10-20 07:39:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know he does not want to discuss those topics either..we know he can't respond to the other  topics either
1318335722861006854 2020-10-20 07:38:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would that be a surprise? But, does he want to talk about how  his foreign policy has made us a laughing stock? Or is that off the table too?
1318335351015067650 2020-10-20 07:36:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he will not stay quiet..but it is nice to know we can turn off the tv and know we don't miss anything
1318335120382754817 2020-10-20 07:36:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Again he wants it his way ..guess he has not learned a thing. If he backs out blaming Joe and everyone else, it just means he is a coward ..
1318334773597753344 2020-10-20 07:34:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is Hunter running? Think not!!    Way I see it ,Joe Biden is a good man..we all make mistakes , Hunter has been thru a lot and made mistakes, but he would have to be a good man too
1318313847820869633 2020-10-20 06:11:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh my that is massive. I hope people are all okay
1318309677416009728 2020-10-20 05:54:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If I believe my eyes, she flies the American flag made in China
1318291691602956288 2020-10-20 04:43:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so nice he is so good at kissing arse to dictators or he would not get attention from any adults around the world
1318288092562948097 2020-10-20 04:29:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can the trumps do anything without complaint? @JoeBiden  has taken whatever you have dished out. Stop whining.
1318286758702972951 2020-10-20 04:23:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think that is the best idea I have heard in months
1318261405938831362 2020-10-20 02:43:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is exactly what he is saying now. But, nazis come to my biggest rallies. Leave us alone

1318252368262270976 2020-10-20 02:07:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do nothing to help the situation. People get sicker and more die and it is with your help. Just say" put on masks", have Dr Fauci talk to the people and stop hiding from the truth. You do not know more than scientists, neither do your advisors. Time for you to grow up.
1318252366056071169 2020-10-20 02:07:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   Have to agree with you-people are tired of covid19. Sadly we cannot wish it away or hide from it. That is how this got so hugeBadmouthing Dr Fauci is nothing more than blaming him when you know he has done nothing but try to help this country and all citizens.
1318244539937808385 2020-10-20 01:36:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the spineless republicans that would know are too spineless to speak up.
1318244246919483392 2020-10-20 01:34:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not a pretty picture..only bright spot is, unless I misunderstand, he can't fire Dr Fauci, just make his life hell but probably doing that already.
1318243608135389190 2020-10-20 01:32:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> heartbreaking but sensible. Thank you for your reminder and truth
1318243297467506694 2020-10-20 01:31:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump; cannot fire Dr Fauci   https://t.co/meK7SagIdd
1318242928154771459 2020-10-20 01:29:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump also said something like don't believe what you hear or see just believe me..he followed that with about 20000+ lies and covid 19.
1318241798981115911 2020-10-20 01:25:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is sad. Dr Fauci is trying to  help by telling the truth and trump finds fault with facts and truth. How much more upside down can this country get?
1318241496500477952 2020-10-20 01:23:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kbb40332460 @TiffanyATrump You and your other privileged people are some of  those keeping this virus going
1318240654875631629 2020-10-20 01:20:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably would not publicly attack anyone  ..guessing
1318240207951568901 2020-10-20 01:18:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Best to believe Dr Fauci
1318239989231222788 2020-10-20 01:17:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not just ignore trump when he says outlandish things..he wants publicity and you are giving it. Those who believe him about Dr Fauci or any other lies he tells are his base..let them give him attn we do not need too
1318235189206798336 2020-10-20 00:58:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tells you a lot about their IQ cant separate fact from fiction. Even common sense in short supply..so why worry about them
1318190459320258561 2020-10-19 22:01:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> .just one word......desperation
1318190083791532032 2020-10-19 21:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope @JoeBiden has a way to turn off trumps game show host routine
1318187457213583361 2020-10-19 21:49:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> golly gee so who did it? Russia is ruled out but so many others are not.
1318186909693317120 2020-10-19 21:47:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope trump cant bring his contact list with him when he leaves
1318185975579873281 2020-10-19 21:43:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he is saying he prefers chaos but knows it wont work? He is surrendering?
1318181647636889601 2020-10-19 21:26:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does steve bannon actually believe that the American people will do this again?
1318181166768422912 2020-10-19 21:24:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> murder she wrote? cull the herd? make money? or so many other possibilities to choose from
1318179762997702658 2020-10-19 21:18:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trying to have a life despite the ramblings and insanity coming out of the white house by people who know donald is losing
1318179538334064640 2020-10-19 21:17:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No shock!! Betting trump knew that all along
1318179400920301568 2020-10-19 21:17:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> One of those dictator countries will take him/family if the money is right
1318172525830995970 2020-10-19 20:49:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ..and think no one notices
1318171406086045696 2020-10-19 20:45:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Get it through your head he fired that prosecutor to benefit and at the request of the USA and other governments..... He was not covering for Hunter and it had nothing to do with Hunter. You really need to read so you can absorb what really happened.
1318169842680299521 2020-10-19 20:39:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Laws are for anyone not connected to trump. Ethics are also for no one connected to trump..haven't you learned that yet?
1318169596373979138 2020-10-19 20:38:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As insane as this anti-authority thing is-Dr Fauci gets it!
1318163998915891205 2020-10-19 20:16:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> right wing idiots..Dr Fauci is even fighting for you

1318150681161879552 2020-10-19 19:23:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @VenetiaSpencer I think all you did was exactly right and ...it makes you smart

1318035601954951168 2020-10-19 11:45:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good grief dont you stop. Trump will lose Biden will win. Just stop already. Your desperation is overwhelming
1318034201443258368 2020-10-19 11:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whatever he does , wherever he is, after he is evicted..he will not be silent
1318033969548546049 2020-10-19 11:39:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they get sick  with covid19 if it will occur to them where they got it..their beloved president ..he wont be in the bed next to you, he wont get the same treatment, the medicines the president gets are not even approved yet. the deplorables wont be getting those
1318033429401919488 2020-10-19 11:37:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Personification of deplorable
1318033167832502272 2020-10-19 11:36:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thanks for putting that out here..world can use this now
1318032929772195840 2020-10-19 11:35:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You can say that 1000 times and then you see 1001 times when they give their spiel like never saw facts or truth
1318029767078236160 2020-10-19 11:22:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @VP  you have no apology for anything that has happened during this administration? That makes you another trump..do not say you are pro-life to many lives have been destroyed for you to say that
1318029448336318464 2020-10-19 11:21:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  what is better than a woman telling you she likes your looks would be the rest of your audience in masks rather than just the ones in front of the camera?
1318028950489255943 2020-10-19 11:19:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTE @JoeBiden

1318012913676857344 2020-10-19 10:15:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are lying, misquoting, misunderstanding , misinformation or whatever you choose to call it..it is totally inaccurate and wont get donnie reelected..truth might have but that does not exist there
1318012433294893061 2020-10-19 10:13:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not understand why people are harassing others for their voting. Do not have to agree with their vote but at least for now it is their right to vote
1318010772455329793 2020-10-19 10:07:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not care how he goes, just want him gone
1318010663244075009 2020-10-19 10:06:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would you travel down Johnsons road?
1318009630191124480 2020-10-19 10:02:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant wait until anyone with an R who participates in all this racism or any of trumps means of curbing votes is gone ..never to be in public office again
1318009201155805191 2020-10-19 10:00:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why watch or listen?

1318007675901349888 2020-10-19 09:54:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @wendyranderson @debrafeldstein Thank you!..So grandma does not have an email?
1318007370107310081 2020-10-19 09:53:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Height of crazy. Can trump be removed? Dr Fauci wants to save lives and trump is egging on supporters. THIS IS CRAZY
1317992736650334209 2020-10-19 08:55:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that one is as phony as phony can be..beyond troll

1317990982470799361 2020-10-19 08:48:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @twittersupport  I just reported a member of q who is speaking against face masks..but there was no place to really report them can there be a ca tgegory for anti facenasks saying dont work ..they called them face diapers
1317989580658835461 2020-10-19 08:42:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> liars lie..it is what they do best

1317988571635159040 2020-10-19 08:38:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> since January of 2016
1317988378231668737 2020-10-19 08:38:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so what ..? I do not see trump or Biden there. what is the point except your showing cowardice and trying to cast doubt on the debate?
1317986010417008640 2020-10-19 08:28:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He thinks he looks cute I bet
1317985568815448064 2020-10-19 08:27:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone send a picture?
1317985032271781890 2020-10-19 08:24:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is noticed
1317984960045789186 2020-10-19 08:24:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> After you vote , if you go to a box or polls, wash your hands again.
1317984672996118528 2020-10-19 08:23:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh what youuuuu saidddddddddd
1317984474412568578 2020-10-19 08:22:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ok I give up. Thank you..whoever Pearl is, if that picture is real, she looks great and her vote is well appreciated
1317984092156297217 2020-10-19 08:21:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So that picture is really Pearl? Thanks for your response..
1317983863994503168 2020-10-19 08:20:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> presume Ms Pearl is the person with the mischievous face..looks like real hell raiser..unless that is pic off net and not real person
1317972634903154688 2020-10-19 07:35:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol..was curious who said ok for Ms Mischief..I really cannot get over that expression. Sounds dumb I know , childish even , maybe i am reverting lol.  So Ms Mischief is Pearl?
1317971888908402688 2020-10-19 07:32:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bear we do not have to agree, but we do have to give people right to have their choice and vote..even if it is stupid and shows total blindness
1317969775201558528 2020-10-19 07:24:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump misleads about everything
1317969480627212292 2020-10-19 07:23:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @bscreegan @wendyranderson @JoeBiden @BarackObama @gtconway3d Wendy is granddaughter? Sorry  trying to unconfuse me
1317969106071638016 2020-10-19 07:21:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope she will share some of those stories. She is just so darn adorable lol ..So you are bscreegan? Does Ms Mischief type or you type for her?
1317964467733495808 2020-10-19 07:03:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @wendyranderson @bscreegan @JoeBiden @BarackObama @gtconway3d Think will call you Ms Mischief (if you do not mind)
1317962740422553603 2020-10-19 06:56:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @wendyranderson @bscreegan @JoeBiden @BarackObama @gtconway3d You look like such  a troublemaker..love that look
1317962231036940289 2020-10-19 06:54:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> disgusting ..only good thing is trump will still lose
1317906200827146242 2020-10-19 03:11:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RepGregMurphy were you picked for your bigotry? Sure not intelligence.  Want to make sure you see this since your original tweet was deleted
1317905579285925888 2020-10-19 03:09:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why were you picked? A great  example of bigotry?
1317882934704078854 2020-10-19 01:39:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump and his lackeys  are always talking about himself when he accuses Biden of anything
1317862955669651459 2020-10-19 00:19:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The majority must be saying how fantastic it would be if he did not return to any of those states
1317862168226861057 2020-10-19 00:16:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Let me seem him start to recommit
1317862027013087238 2020-10-19 00:16:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a character..cannot even believe he sent this out now after his miserable behavior &amp; example of 4 yrs. If he is sincere and believes character really counts, he would not be doing all the lying about Biden, only character counts with trump is himself, not real qualities
1317860468631982080 2020-10-19 00:09:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nevermind Christian, what sort of human?
1317860372225921027 2020-10-19 00:09:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WOW
1317846784111185921 2020-10-18 23:15:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also know that fox, like breitbart,  is not known for facts or truth
1317846495316631553 2020-10-18 23:14:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Let her look and figure it out for herself  https://t.co/VgAaIc8Dia
1317846220342202368 2020-10-18 23:13:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just so we are clear. His campaign will not give you airtime or the attention you so desperately crave. We know  it is fake news and if you paid attention you would know it too
1317830396541833222 2020-10-18 22:10:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RepMattGaetz Must be a typo..you put in Joes name by mistake
1317829942332227584 2020-10-18 22:08:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because you should be questioning your family income, taxes and connections does not mean everyone is like your family
1317829000887259139 2020-10-18 22:04:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know that the Bidens do not want to be dragged to the trump level so they pay no attention..and neither do all Biden supporters. . You can try to antagonize but it wastes your time. Tell daddy to mandate masks. Do something worthwhile that is real, important. and lifesaving
1317812952884445184 2020-10-18 21:01:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IKnowBO @micheleserro Not saying Caruso is bad..not even close to bad..but to say Pavarotti is mediocre makes me cry. üò¢
1317811948776546304 2020-10-18 20:57:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More than that, I think he  loves control and being a puppeteer. He is big on revenge and wants to show what his ignorant base will still do in his name. I call it insanity
1317809811476590592 2020-10-18 20:48:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was surprisingly enlightening ..but I have been waiting and counting..just more so now. üòä

1317655645735309313 2020-10-18 10:36:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kylegriffin1 trump will do whatever he thinks it will take to get him reelected..and he wont care what it is or think how bad it makes him look
1317655127617142784 2020-10-18 10:33:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 @Ange_Amene Biden will do just what he said..he will let people do their jobs. He will not send any people in to help the other side. He will not get involved &amp; that is the right thing.trump has gotten so involved in everything it is how corruption happens.What happened to Floyd was sickenin
1317651055925170176 2020-10-18 10:17:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes very quickly he got 220,000 dead people. Have a country overrun with covid ..I have not seen or held my grandkids since February.  He is a hate monger. He cant turn the economy around until he turns covid around..but guess it is all in what you like
1317650082821476358 2020-10-18 10:13:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess melania was not in this country back then
1317649975099248640 2020-10-18 10:13:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 Do you really lose your followers when paroled?
1317629626219401216 2020-10-18 08:52:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> foolish old man?
1317629299063726080 2020-10-18 08:51:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No way did I think of it as racist just ignorant, wanting attention like donald
1317628934855528453 2020-10-18 08:49:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Love the expression on Grandma Pearls face.
1317628451227111425 2020-10-18 08:47:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Grandma Pearl  you are so right!! Truly sorry no visits, let us know when you get your visitors please. Everyone is waiting.. has anyone told you, you look like a mischief maker?  You look great.  #belikegrandmapearl
1317627661590605831 2020-10-18 08:44:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also calling for violence
1317624858319163392 2020-10-18 08:33:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disheartening to see no parents or family (masked and spaced) there to watch them
1317624113490481152 2020-10-18 08:30:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> old and boring more attention it is given more it will say
1317623958208978944 2020-10-18 08:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @natsechobbyist  Thank you. In your own way, you are as much of a hero as your husband.
1317617158067785733 2020-10-18 08:03:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> since when are radiologists tied to scientific studies whether pulmonary or immunology or even a radiologist of the caliber of Dr Fauci?  Why listen or trust what atlas says over what Fauci says
1317615537904603136 2020-10-18 07:56:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he can remember Hilary
1317615356068941829 2020-10-18 07:55:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @UROCKlive1 @SandiAnthony1 trump is insane and trying to get a reaction so he can blame dems if something happens..but everyone would know where it came from
1317614877607927808 2020-10-18 07:54:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wow so desperate telling big lies to rile people up.  No one will blow up Mount Rushmore unless trump gets his nitwits to try it and while he is stupid, he cannot be that stupid
1317614431401136129 2020-10-18 07:52:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the trump camp does not understand that desperation has a stench..and the trump camp suffer from that stench. Not likely Biden wants to get near it
1317614128937271296 2020-10-18 07:51:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tracked mine about a week ago-.accepted. Way to go @davidplouffe Tracking is a good idea
1317611211123511296 2020-10-18 07:39:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is giving them dogwhistles, yet he wont get his hands dirty and they listen..he looks down on his followers,  does not like them but he is good at using them
1317608939278766080 2020-10-18 07:30:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great idea!!  @AMCTheatres  good luck with it
1317607534883209218 2020-10-18 07:24:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why do any of the Biden camp want to get dragged to the lower levels of disinformation and other lies of the trumps
1317607144083099653 2020-10-18 07:23:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry saw your email thought NJ ..oops
1317606860304809988 2020-10-18 07:22:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Reconciliation is not helpless ..just friends and family make a pact no trump discussion or even Biden and maybe things will work out. Just remember if friends not friends anymore they never were
1317606544557604864 2020-10-18 07:20:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry, maybe a couple days before the election the electric for all will fail &amp; they will come to their senses and vote for reality. In the meantime just do not change your course BIDEN needs help. I am in NJ this area trump votes..however I am noticing people change mind
1317601928382205954 2020-10-18 07:02:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shows just how much tramp cares
1317601684516950017 2020-10-18 07:01:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure do not raise taxes..let the rich get richer and the bridges not get built. Schools wont be built, do not raise taxes..hospitals can close and the list goes on..lets not raise taxes
1317600770716553218 2020-10-18 06:57:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there seems to be no law in trumpland..until he leaves office
1317600630224146434 2020-10-18 06:57:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can hope
1317600557683658753 2020-10-18 06:57:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a basket of trash
1317600491338145792 2020-10-18 06:56:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Truth is he fires up his base, stands back and watches it happen..he will get off of this scott free, but his base can end up in jail depending what they do..that is his dedication to his fans..set them up because he can and then sit back
1317599987077959685 2020-10-18 06:54:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sad and so sorry..it will probably get worse as trump gets closer to leaving. Hope you are all extra careful and safe
1317599196636065792 2020-10-18 06:51:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump are you going thru your second childhood or is this your first one?
1317598940087320576 2020-10-18 06:50:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòá Very troublesome thought. My thought is rather than change the vote, send trump a note, tell him continue as he is going.  Status quo, problem solved.
1317590459909361665 2020-10-18 06:16:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @IKnowBO @micheleserro If you open your ears and listen you might learn
1317589578388328449 2020-10-18 06:13:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So much talent in one man
1317588168632315909 2020-10-18 06:07:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is just too stupid..it is so intentional and he did not learn from events of the last couple weeks or 2016 or that he is losing so badly in  the polls
1317584772164706307 2020-10-18 05:54:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is coming
1317584665050480642 2020-10-18 05:53:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who paid you to say that? nothing to do with Joe more to do with what sort of person would repeat propaganda..KNOWING it is propaganda?
1317584377539293184 2020-10-18 05:52:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too late I voted..but voted @JoeBiden  so guess itis okay
1317583916136628224 2020-10-18 05:50:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You should pick your friends more carefully @EricTrump
1317583694966685696 2020-10-18 05:50:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Surprise..Rudy a russian asset?
1317582708206374912 2020-10-18 05:46:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is for trump..no doubt he is aware but perhaps some of is base will now know he lies:  Joe Biden's proposed tax increase will mostly impact the very wealthy, Washington Post and PoltiFact report
1317555432366497793 2020-10-18 03:57:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We will watch for a while to confirm he is still there and doing his job. Then we will relax and know it will be okay
1317555204934565890 2020-10-18 03:56:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She was pushed into the wall and now painted over? She finally disagreed without donald
1317554927305097216 2020-10-18 03:55:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You were not the loser. Sadly, your dad lost a lot
1317554489210163200 2020-10-18 03:54:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never knew the world could be like donalds world. So glad I missed it, could have continued to miss it too. Mr Rogers is who I prefer to look up to and respect
1317552556038651905 2020-10-18 03:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unless you are totally wrapped up in yourself you probably know
1317552419845279744 2020-10-18 03:45:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he knows they support him. Doubt much more
1317529138832560135 2020-10-18 02:13:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he already has made America a laughingstock
1317528960205529090 2020-10-18 02:12:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In my humble opinion, the sound of a flushed toilet should be all that is heard
1317528721599975424 2020-10-18 02:11:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he have any money left?
1317527993187749888 2020-10-18 02:08:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such an intelligent cat
1317527809364025346 2020-10-18 02:08:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this wave does not look red to me!!!
1317526923652845573 2020-10-18 02:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Repubs have no issue if power is not balanced as long as they are in power
1317526615245586433 2020-10-18 02:03:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has a history of not paying bills. Guessing he is trying not to pay that one either
1317515001918312448 2020-10-18 01:17:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just remember, no matter how frightening it all is..comes Jan 24 we can fix it and get back to "normal" whatever that will be, it will be better than this.
1317486811778850817 2020-10-17 23:25:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is such a low class act
1317484413324840961 2020-10-17 23:15:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needs to go and take his "family" with him
1317483970007891974 2020-10-17 23:13:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is trying to get people to vote.. me? I would volunteer to pack his bags..on condition he take his family  and he or  his family never return
1317483281793908739 2020-10-17 23:11:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You belong in the lying trump party (you call it republicans)..truth is gone. It is you republicans that no one can afford..even other republicans..the ones that don't support your version of the republican party..the trump party.
1317470958706479106 2020-10-17 22:22:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÇ
1317470603599925250 2020-10-17 22:20:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is such pathetic desperation by probably, trump, russia and rudy. This is old news and has been investigated I think 4 times..Biden did nothing wrong
1317456250674794499 2020-10-17 21:23:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think when he is escorted out the FBI will be waiting.
1317456032029966336 2020-10-17 21:22:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad he got to vote.
1317455592311689222 2020-10-17 21:21:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jacindaardern  Congratulations
1317455431606898689 2020-10-17 21:20:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What will happen if trump is not reelected is why he is fighting so hard to stay in office..for eternity
1317454566292672515 2020-10-17 21:17:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so did we
1317447386277576704 2020-10-17 20:48:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This company should be heavily fined for tampering with elections..after trump is out of office
1317446227978485762 2020-10-17 20:43:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your reality is like trumps..alternate
1317433428028129285 2020-10-17 19:53:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The story was a smear campaign..so what sort of response would you want? He answered your question. If you ask questions like that, what would you like him to say to you? Oh, thanks for keeping this going?
1317430712220422145 2020-10-17 19:42:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bin Laden is like any other piece of history now..Depending on the age of the respondent, name might be remembered details are not...How many say Holocaust never happened?
1317313241333288961 2020-10-17 11:55:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His answering about your question honestly was not going after you, if you go after him with rag type questions what else does he have for a frame of reference for you?
1317312506671566849 2020-10-17 11:52:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden  I am so  sorry you were hit with the article about your son. I imagine it cannot be easy but I just hope from now on you will swallow hard and not get nasty or donald will have found your spot to get to you
1317303201587208192 2020-10-17 11:15:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Afraid I agree. Had people very fooled
1317303064789979137 2020-10-17 11:14:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am still trying to figure out how he hid this nonhuman human for so long
1317302679635431424 2020-10-17 11:13:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Figured it out a couple years ago but do not know how he hid it . Sad.
1317302003329097728 2020-10-17 11:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> a joke?
1317289686843461632 2020-10-17 10:21:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> meeeeeeee too!!!
1317289455766671360 2020-10-17 10:20:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks more and more like the people are rising up to be sure that does not happen
1317289326665998336 2020-10-17 10:20:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTE WITH A BLUE MASK
1317289138668904455 2020-10-17 10:19:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Luv it
1317289013712244741 2020-10-17 10:19:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you are okay. Report the EMT?
1317287439581483008 2020-10-17 10:12:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your salute is magnificient
1317287261629747207 2020-10-17 10:12:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @bidenharris Only way to go
1317287071745253376 2020-10-17 10:11:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wearing blue sleeve in honor of @JoeBiden
1317286668509085696 2020-10-17 10:09:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Think we could help to pack his bags?
1317286052156112897 2020-10-17 10:07:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure looks like that is the message..wonder if still (allegedly) involved with Russia?
1317285644402655232 2020-10-17 10:05:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> home alone for 7 months or is it 8? trying to retain sanity and it is not working anymore. Glad your wife is with you
1317285057774702592 2020-10-17 10:03:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> my opinion is worst, and most dangerous
1317283613986226176 2020-10-17 09:57:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When do you predict it will end?
1317282998774095877 2020-10-17 09:55:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds perfectly lovely to see
1317282626177290240 2020-10-17 09:53:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIFYINGLY WRONG ABOUT THIS
1317282409528856580 2020-10-17 09:52:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> New York will welcome him back with open arms
1317282027050237953 2020-10-17 09:51:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not Chinas fault. Lack of honesty by our "president" at the start and even now at his spreader events
1317281623159746566 2020-10-17 09:49:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree, without their enabling he could not have done as much as he has done
1317278146530627586 2020-10-17 09:35:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can we stand there and wave good bye?
1317277960550944770 2020-10-17 09:35:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Color me surprised if you really are.
1317264854177239041 2020-10-17 08:43:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How many were paid to be there?
1317264488194867201 2020-10-17 08:41:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§ó
1317263614122799104 2020-10-17 08:38:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nothing to do with Obama..was you donald #BlameTrump
1317263260022919172 2020-10-17 08:36:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stay healthy @JoeBiden
1317263121283690496 2020-10-17 08:36:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump eats hamburdgers Joey eats hot dogs..lots of hot dogs
1317262554931040256 2020-10-17 08:34:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know it is fake
1317262232531705858 2020-10-17 08:32:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what does trump have to do with Joey Chestnut?
1317240903598329856 2020-10-17 07:07:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> top is review of Biden?
1317230826740908032 2020-10-17 06:27:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She is so privileged she forgot she is supposed to have a heart and the world is not just about her @TiffanyATrump
1317230558297116675 2020-10-17 06:26:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has learned nothing from the start. He is doing what he has done all along that no one called him on. Guess close enough to elections that people can speak up
1317230288334950405 2020-10-17 06:25:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why worry about it?
1317227435759370246 2020-10-17 06:14:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why did Kelly stay so long?
1317210844057489410 2020-10-17 05:08:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So love Biden's America..trumps sounds and looks like a bunch of maniacs
1317210393383735299 2020-10-17 05:06:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear ü§≠üòÇ
1317209560906649601 2020-10-17 05:03:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure hope it was satire
1317209431667544066 2020-10-17 05:02:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is disgusting..first refused an emergency declaration of  money for help for California..then he changed his mind after Democratic Governor Newsome had to beg
1317196106699190274 2020-10-17 04:09:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching @JoeBiden ..sigh can't it be January already and he even made me laugh..talking about donald saying going around the corner..and said (paraphrasing) he thought he thought donald meant he has gone around the bend
1317192799750586369 2020-10-17 03:56:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Votes for Ronald Reagan or anyone else only take votes from Joe Biden.
1317192573333667841 2020-10-17 03:55:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he was causing it to decline but apparently the decline was not solid..look at the lines at the polls. Common sense and intellect seem to be returning
1317192062660415490 2020-10-17 03:53:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not be surprised if it goes back to rudy and russia. I was actually shocked when he went onto trumps team but guess shows not to judge a book by its cover.
1317191715250446336 2020-10-17 03:52:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't even imagine Biden speaking that way..but that does not mean he did not..and there are predators out there..so no harm in agreeing with them..they can be excited someone agreed lol
1317191117268570118 2020-10-17 03:50:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor rudy
1317187684222337025 2020-10-17 03:36:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be counter ads saying where the money came from and how basically she was bought and paid for by them and trump knew what he wanted..and so did she..he can deny questioning her but when she was vetted she was questioned about her attitudes and outlooks
1317187133791178754 2020-10-17 03:34:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and yet he goes in to this tight indoor spot talking about how he loves the seniors and will look after them..sigh
1317186737664294914 2020-10-17 03:32:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and so? there were and are predators on the street
1317186471011504129 2020-10-17 03:31:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this really needs to stop
1317160771869167617 2020-10-17 01:49:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Since this is only a guess..probably so!!
1317159567520923648 2020-10-17 01:44:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @natsechobbyist You are very admirable.
1317147064401354752 2020-10-17 00:55:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SteveHofstetter trump
1317146733617491975 2020-10-17 00:53:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I just looked more closely, she is not near the person behind her. Just concerned about the Bidens, want everyone to stay well. üòä
1317146241550159873 2020-10-17 00:51:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh wait, that was not Hunter
1317144828736667648 2020-10-17 00:46:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Biden assuming this pic is in Minnesota, where is your mask?
1317124641538871298 2020-10-16 23:26:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would require honesty to tell him how ridiculous that make up looks.
1317124357018320897 2020-10-16 23:24:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh gosh I would feel so safe with a governor who lets trump tell him what to do and basically sticks fingers in the eyes of the residents and the visitors too. I have seen nothing but covid numbers and associated deaths up, Unemployment up.  Gees so safe.  https://t.co/Xsga2diAD5
1317122021818568707 2020-10-16 23:15:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I presume you mean Joe Biden was forthright, comforting and honest. I liked Mr Rogers too
1317121784160935938 2020-10-16 23:14:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @greggutfeld He made that townhall into what it was. I did not watch it, do not know anything but what I read and outtakes. I saw he had a chip on his shoulder. If he had responded honestly, she would have no reason to "badger" joke is people who cannot grasp that fact
1317120772654141447 2020-10-16 23:10:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would also be a good day if he resigned
1317120386673352704 2020-10-16 23:09:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very well said..now I understand.  https://t.co/vzBR1mf8L7
1317118382077038593 2020-10-16 23:01:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right does matter..if you look at the long lines to vote, you will see it. I wouldn't be surprised if you inspired people to vote who never voted before and they probably did not even realize it.  Thank you again.
1317117501344448512 2020-10-16 22:57:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What your daddy does is not debate. I just wonder who decided to waste more taxpayer money on a grudge
1317105044848857088 2020-10-16 22:08:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he does not know and I assume he does not..would he ask someone to explain..not likely.
1317103668072796166 2020-10-16 22:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden does not lie, twist things or exaggerate no need to challenge in the same way if doing or saying nothing wrong. Can be policy questions, interviewers do ask those..and he answers
1317093641874247680 2020-10-16 21:22:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should be made to work on those firelines..and those are the firemen, police etc he says he loves.
1317093306464145408 2020-10-16 21:21:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no one not even his biggest supporters could have expected everything trump has done
1317093057754505218 2020-10-16 21:20:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I liked what he said..from what I heard, nothing but honesty
1317092792930340865 2020-10-16 21:19:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just so exciting..so who cares? I do not see it but what sort of black person would be sitting there flashing white power? Heck, I would not flash black or white power. I prefer equality.
1317083962800472065 2020-10-16 20:44:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I found him normal, not at all boring.  Just waited for the explosion that never came. Scared me I even waited.
1317071177630814214 2020-10-16 19:53:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> None of those outlets are against you..just lies. There is no deep state unless it is republicans..not going thru the rest but you whine as well as donald
1317068859132813312 2020-10-16 19:44:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is funny.  We know why you are employed..you even have to twist and lie about this. Faithful servants
1317067081649631232 2020-10-16 19:37:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§ó Thank youüòä
1316927675869634560 2020-10-16 10:23:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He can't really believe that can he? I mean there is positive thinking..but what is this?
1316927422214930433 2020-10-16 10:22:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would he need to provide it? You do realize of course, he IS donald trump
1316927151086718976 2020-10-16 10:21:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess now people will be asking more questions
1316923298870136834 2020-10-16 10:05:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is this the last bear hunt in NJ?
1316923035757268992 2020-10-16 10:04:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> need to cover mouth and nose
1316922650707492865 2020-10-16 10:03:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden has experience cleaning up republican messes
1316921571882242053 2020-10-16 09:59:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> forgot to mention trump, he is probably whining about how fixed everything is and was
1316921395020967939 2020-10-16 09:58:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And he is enjoying it. We know that was just another bit of propaganda to create an image. @JoeBiden  can out bicycle him, out walk him and outthink him at any given time on any given topic..and prob eat more ice cream too
1316916965559144451 2020-10-16 09:40:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So impressive tonight
1316914648424304641 2020-10-16 09:31:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do sit out or vote @JoeBiden
1316912355914166272 2020-10-16 09:22:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump will do or say anything to get reelected.
1316912354664349698 2020-10-16 09:22:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He had fetal tissue in one of his medications  to heal his Covid19  Personally I am not so sure I could do that but I also cannot dictate who should receive an abortion. It could help someone besides the woman who determined she could not carry a baby.
1316910811936362496 2020-10-16 09:16:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You make us proud. Thank you Mr President. guess I should not jump ahead so you  make us proud. Thank you Mr Vice President.
1316910308594692098 2020-10-16 09:14:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But, trump has been whining about Guthrie all day. No one forced him to do this. He could have had a virtual debate or just sat home with his mouth shut..was all his choice
1316910307084820483 2020-10-16 09:14:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You mean Joe Biden is being real and Donald is being his same entitled "president" Maybe you should listen and learn what is real and fake. I doubt Ms Guthrie started out tonight as hostile.
1316909662118305798 2020-10-16 09:11:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounded strange to me too..and I loved it. A real person who knows the job he will have..
1316909418395611136 2020-10-16 09:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicely put. I am watching him and that is how I feel until I think still a couple more months..Back up it goes
1316909115915075586 2020-10-16 09:09:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what else could he do? that is what you get for watching him. I did not.
1316908977242988544 2020-10-16 09:09:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Golly sure loving @JoeBiden ..sensible,knowledgeable, courteous , believable, presidential..and sane
1316906755062980608 2020-10-16 09:00:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You forget to mention..he answers those question  as one adult to another. I WISH IT WAS NOV and then zipped right to January
1316906417413103618 2020-10-16 08:58:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kbb40332460 @TiffanyATrump Rather not be so selfish that me is all I can think of.
1316906220708659201 2020-10-16 08:58:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would not expect less..but would be shocked if was any thing less
1316905981381574656 2020-10-16 08:57:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aw trump lose his temper with someone that tries to get him to answer a question....nah cant be. You know he will blame Joe
1316905678217281538 2020-10-16 08:55:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Welcome back!!!! Feel better now?
1316903170577207296 2020-10-16 08:45:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden sounds so sane. Prepare who prepares? Just rant and lieüòÉ Face it, Biden sounds like a President should sound
1316902730242379776 2020-10-16 08:44:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad to be watching @JoeBiden
1316902595349327874 2020-10-16 08:43:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> face it trump is a conspiracy theorist to the nth degree..just needs the right people  (with their own agenda, one not necessarily favorable to the USA) to whisper in his ear.
1316902199570685952 2020-10-16 08:42:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and got rewarded for it with a great 3 network deal that costs him nothing except having a temper tantrum
1316901893772378115 2020-10-16 08:40:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gees what can you say to someone that actually believes there is?
1316897869585174531 2020-10-16 08:24:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must mean ratings are up
1316897726823649280 2020-10-16 08:24:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is Biden  unless he is interrupted and yelled over he is always interesting to listen too..and very calming lol
1316897443297054727 2020-10-16 08:23:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> same line he has used since Covid 19 got here  ..i am not watching him you wont learn anything and it rewards trump for his bad behavior
1316897219421872128 2020-10-16 08:22:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yay it is fixed
1316897116212633602 2020-10-16 08:21:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kbb40332460 @TiffanyATrump I have not seen or touched my grandchildren since last march..or my kids. Missed a birthday party, will miss the holidays.  Happy partying @tiffanyatrump is this what privilege does? Glad I am not privileged  #ByeTiffany
1316843237613674498 2020-10-16 04:47:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> way to go Caroline..cant be easy and yet you are standing up to do it
1316842978611208192 2020-10-16 04:46:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I watched Sen Sasse yesterday and I was impressed that he called him out..and now I hope he sees and understands why people are so against the Courts candidate.
1316842335259504641 2020-10-16 04:44:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She ought to stick to truth.
1316842195614404613 2020-10-16 04:43:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is he bringing them in from russia? they are helping
1316842070628339714 2020-10-16 04:43:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> almost black but not quite
1316841929594884102 2020-10-16 04:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is why I like CNN..couple shows I prefer on other channels but overall CNN..for same reasons. I will not even mention those other channels though
1316814163885293571 2020-10-16 02:52:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good dog, smart dog. Someone give him a treat.
1316813966774067202 2020-10-16 02:51:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is an excellent graph
1316813828022243328 2020-10-16 02:50:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and where would he get the money to pay it?
1316813518759493640 2020-10-16 02:49:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is all the stories about trump and family that have been proven true..that is why he tries to divert attention
1316813254581256192 2020-10-16 02:48:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know better, wonder if Rudy will share a cell with donald?
1316813055720935424 2020-10-16 02:47:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he brags about what he did the last 2 years of Obama administration..guess now he can take a bow for the last 4 yrs of trump admin..and on his way out the door maybe the Biden administration will check bank records
1316811915654504456 2020-10-16 02:43:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #ByeTiffany
1316811557557469191 2020-10-16 02:41:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just how many laws can these people break without any punishment..just making mockery of this country and its laws
1316811278338404353 2020-10-16 02:40:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not very adult of me but just wish that big bag of wind would just shut up
1316779192579694593 2020-10-16 00:33:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is what I was thinking when I heard it yesterday..i wont watch that and i wont watch any of those channels tonight..or anytime in the future they are helping trump in his upside down world and showing children it is okay to have a temper tantrum rewards come
1316777846703042571 2020-10-16 00:27:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at what republicans are doing in Cal? Gives a big hint. Ask them, one more way  they believe they are above the law
1316777444561563648 2020-10-16 00:26:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is insanity. When do Senators come back from russia?
1316772000296296448 2020-10-16 00:04:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and people are still dying in bigger numbers than trump wants people to believe and it is not just seniors, it is every age range. trump is not telling anyone that
1316768159853150208 2020-10-15 23:49:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Deaths are going up
1316767194496331778 2020-10-15 23:45:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> forgot @peacock also NBC..thanks
1316763283211288579 2020-10-15 23:30:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would anyone believe anything Ted Cruz? He goes with the wind
1316762770596134913 2020-10-15 23:28:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have no  idea what a jush is??? or whatever it was but she is prepared. That is awesome. She is going to vote..people need to take a lesson from her..VOTE
1316762200619577347 2020-10-15 23:25:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only say this is about time.
1316761386337304580 2020-10-15 23:22:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yes and i would not name the channels ..I would just not tune in ..and watch Biden instead..no doubt he wont present a clown show..but you can relax a while and learn something while knowing you can trust:  #BidenTownHallOnABC
1316752331040600064 2020-10-15 22:46:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not need to hear Murdoch to know all he is doing wrong and how disgusting it is..so Rupert why dont u tell Donald?
1316751823286476800 2020-10-15 22:44:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG how beautiful is that!!
1316751607640526848 2020-10-15 22:43:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no it is what trump wants for trump..nothing to do with the governor at all
1316751402866180097 2020-10-15 22:42:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because he wants to take command of the country
1316751283005665282 2020-10-15 22:42:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he is saying (and showing) that he is the one wants to be dictator and the people cant stand him
1316751028151373825 2020-10-15 22:41:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stay safe and healthy!
1316731516693741568 2020-10-15 21:23:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Msnbc you will try to help trump tonight..so dont you worry your little collective heads.. you have disgraced yourselves and lost  many regular viewers
1316731083287863296 2020-10-15 21:22:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> TWITTER IS BLOCKING LIES
1316729794143420417 2020-10-15 21:17:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @chucktodd  how can you do this? I can only come up with limited answers..so now I am on the #FireChuckTodd bandwagon
1316728979840274434 2020-10-15 21:13:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Where is a copy of that petition? Would be nice to send copies to everyone involved with her approval
1316728389118590976 2020-10-15 21:11:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder if G-d will protect their families and friends? Do they know the answer and were they asked if they wanted to verify it with G-d before the family member attended?

1316725835022454785 2020-10-15 21:01:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe he does have feelings of guilt and words he trips over are words he lies about?
1316725433140994050 2020-10-15 20:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the audience does not see anything strange about this? what did he put in their ]water?
1316725165858918401 2020-10-15 20:58:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Twitter is doing what you should be doing. Make sure facts get out
1316724879614513152 2020-10-15 20:57:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and only obeying people if they agree with you..not because they are right and teach you anything. . How dare you try to blame Pelosi ?
1316721643679514624 2020-10-15 20:44:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the fascination with what is important to these people and not important..makes me wonder what country they are in
1316721342562082816 2020-10-15 20:43:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who cares ..Hunter is not going to be president or an employee of the White House-just one more distraction that won't change votes
1316600258093363201 2020-10-15 12:42:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably not as high because outdoors and not shoulder to shoulder..not a lot of screaming either then there are masks for some. ..can't speak about the rioters they are not connected to the protestors, they are brought in from outside and generally paid.
1316598657660133376 2020-10-15 12:35:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So, so good!!
1316598427334193152 2020-10-15 12:35:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gave me chills.
1316597945303736321 2020-10-15 12:33:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree but you were so really informative (sure opened my eyes)..and interesting ..thank you

1316580806652026880 2020-10-15 11:24:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Remember people, town hall for Joe Biden tomorrow night..certainly hope you will be watching. I won't even sneak a peak at the other channels (they are simulcasting the babies show) during an ad..@JoeBiden the town hall to watch
1316568300504182793 2020-10-15 10:35:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't tell, the Biden campaign stills need money
1316567960845197312 2020-10-15 10:33:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope Sasse can think and act independently now that he sees what is happening with Amy Coney Barret.
1316555976242233348 2020-10-15 09:46:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am not turning on sound I do not want to hear trump make a fool of himself AGAIN
1316555062387367941 2020-10-15 09:42:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never have seen that health care..so he must figure everyone can afford to buy their own even if unemployed out on the market place at 5 times the price
1316554820061458433 2020-10-15 09:41:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if @govcharlesbaker does not vote for Biden, no matter who he is voting for, it is trump . So hope he votes @JoeBiden
1316554156342218752 2020-10-15 09:39:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I noticed that smile..and blank sheets ..does that mean she knows it is a done deal and does not need or care about notes?
1316553629810253824 2020-10-15 09:37:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My sis died a couple of weeks ago, still trying to call her..and i feel numb, probably because of everything going on at one time. Sorry about your mom.  Sad will go away. Just remember the good things
1316553037868085250 2020-10-15 09:34:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How long-as long as it takes you to mourn. Holidays and birthdays or whenever you feel like it. Sit down and cry you will probably feel better
1316552690412007427 2020-10-15 09:33:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What ignorant fools they are..even if getting paid to be there and i do not know if they are this time..but these are their lives and their families and friends..stupid. Used to want to reach out and try to explain. Now I just want to shake them silly
1316551661817663488 2020-10-15 09:29:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Personally I think it is one of two things..1 they want to give equal time and trump decided that was the slot he wants..and he is going to work for nbc once thrown out of white house. 2. trump thru a fit and as usual people cave so as not to upset him .me,I am watching Biden
1316551101798285314 2020-10-15 09:26:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pay for daring to criticise? what foreign country are we in?
1316550512096014336 2020-10-15 09:24:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i try not to watch him
1316550294508105728 2020-10-15 09:23:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so what is the clarity?
1316546110979272706 2020-10-15 09:07:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 never too late to believe in miracles
1316542730047303688 2020-10-15 08:53:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well translated
1316542647905943552 2020-10-15 08:53:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not nice
1316542585880616963 2020-10-15 08:53:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thee are other names she could be called
1316542474186379264 2020-10-15 08:52:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I believe you and your other colleagues should have stood up to trump..so what you say matters not
1316542259064643586 2020-10-15 08:51:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Same crap dif day with all of them
1316532369801777155 2020-10-15 08:12:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you for reminding and/or making  so many aware
1316531686721675264 2020-10-15 08:09:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  look at how you are seen by people that have sense enough to pay attention
1316531388213071873 2020-10-15 08:08:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pity they have no truth to spread
1316527675729682432 2020-10-15 07:53:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Kamala Harris on Rachel tonight
1316527119955120128 2020-10-15 07:51:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 So really sorry I know it has to hurt. I hope you do not try to change their minds..could just drive them further into trump and..I honest to G-d just do not understand any of it
1316526415509164041 2020-10-15 07:48:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have been quite good..and showing her for what she is..but what do we do about it..maybe you are also showing republicans they should pay more attention?
1316526168141631488 2020-10-15 07:47:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry,..i am told that if you try to get people to know the truth it could make them more determined..so i have given up
1316525983684534272 2020-10-15 07:47:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> has to hurt
1316525896338157568 2020-10-15 07:46:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So is trump and you and a few others
1316515407445057540 2020-10-15 07:05:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Joke?
1316510080137916417 2020-10-15 06:43:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope I said tomorrow for town hall..losing track of days
1316508368702517250 2020-10-15 06:37:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thursday 8 PM eastern donald is on another channel same time I am not watching that one
1316491494895820800 2020-10-15 05:30:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess if her kids are affected she will pay attention
1316491328562307072 2020-10-15 05:29:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Understandable, Kamala is very good and makes Barrett very unsure..it's great. She trips her up and informs the public.  Maybe in combination with Whitehouse they will change some opinions where it counts
1316490697323806725 2020-10-15 05:26:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorryafter listening to her, I understand differences of opinion but this is more than that. She is not qualified and should not beallowed to continue..Assume trump will not win. He won't,  when all the politicians that support trump are voted out, legacies will be destroyed
1316489401774505984 2020-10-15 05:21:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> on the other hand crickets are a symbol for good luck.
1316489177450643457 2020-10-15 05:20:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor Barron, he looks like his father.
1316488806586036224 2020-10-15 05:19:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol lol üò∑üòÇ I don't know it for a fact but I believe in context the word you refer to  is nice?    üòáNo other.
1316488094393171968 2020-10-15 05:16:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not object to opposing views. Just oppose when one of the opinions just repeats the misinformation of trump
1316487655929065474 2020-10-15 05:14:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is honest, he has a spine, he does not insult or degrade others, he can work across the aisle, he can talk to leaders of other countries , he is respected there. I could go on but why? I would have voted for him even if trump were not his opponent.  @JoeBiden
1316426316267298816 2020-10-15 01:11:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NBC thinks it still has the apprentice so it needs to kowtow? Maybe it does?
1316425910493556736 2020-10-15 01:09:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure wonder if this judge is teaching her children how to dodge..oops I mean to follow her footsteps..and thinks she will be proud of them if they grow up to be like her
1316396469474275328 2020-10-14 23:12:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot believe he is still there
1316369067616370693 2020-10-14 21:23:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree depends on the show..but  a couple are so obviously trump it turns my stomach. I prefer news to opinion unless they say it is opinion.
1316367971246313473 2020-10-14 21:19:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have noticed some show favoritism. It has been my go to anyway,  but not now. It is disappointing
1316367326187606018 2020-10-14 21:16:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump used steel from China..it cost less
1316366891636719619 2020-10-14 21:14:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> out of the debate he wanted and then refused, then said ok ,and because Biden took him at this word and continued his life, you give dt a townhall at the same time as a reward. Very disappointing  #BoycottNBC
1316366888658706434 2020-10-14 21:14:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #BoycottNBC  You obey guidelines ..that is good..shame you could not find another day or time to air your president. He is destroying this country in every which way and you reward him.He squirmed
1316365961428193286 2020-10-14 21:11:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #BoycottNBC
1316365871632318464 2020-10-14 21:10:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only in trumps america could this happen..bye bye NBC  #BoycottNBC
1316330083871752192 2020-10-14 18:48:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd, I did not see it as self deprecating. Wonder how you can? To me it was just his usual whining I am entitled garbage with an insincere smile on his face..because he does want women to vote for him..does not care if they like him, long as they vote for him
1316324130904518656 2020-10-14 18:25:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When the Healthcare Act is in danger, the people are in danger..
1316323856844455942 2020-10-14 18:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unbelievable..does he really think anyone with any intelligence pays attention?
1316321134493741062 2020-10-14 18:13:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should we say, he seems to be a republican? Sigh!!!
1316320306907222017 2020-10-14 18:09:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When the person who holds rallies in the middle of a pandemic decided he wants to continue holding rallies to see how many die to boost his ego.
1316319786817781760 2020-10-14 18:07:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Once upon a time I thought Rudy had a brain.
1316318326126239744 2020-10-14 18:01:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Those who tolerate this nonsense to vote should be given medals for being patriotic Americans
1316317715779461122 2020-10-14 17:59:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will be so glad when things begin return to normal
1316183265548656642 2020-10-14 09:05:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad @MittRomney is speaking up..now get your associates to speak up with you. This is all so vile and corrupt. So unamerican
1316182678266355713 2020-10-14 09:02:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree with her
1316182119115296768 2020-10-14 09:00:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More than embarrassing. Wondering what year he thinks he is in
1316179881093402627 2020-10-14 08:51:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If this is not lying propaganda no idea what is
1316179660984791045 2020-10-14 08:50:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shows how insecure he is
1316179582324748288 2020-10-14 08:50:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Speaks volumes about him
1316179339965276162 2020-10-14 08:49:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so how do we make them gone?
1316179207135924224 2020-10-14 08:49:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why on earth does he enjoy sounding this way?
1316179012285329409 2020-10-14 08:48:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so now what?
1316178931213570048 2020-10-14 08:48:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we know , it is one of the reasons you are so popular
1316174400245432326 2020-10-14 08:30:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not particularly like her but that is rude
1316172232998166529 2020-10-14 08:21:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gosh such a silly thing to do..perhaps that is why you are in the lead position.
1316172074759655427 2020-10-14 08:20:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But you stayed...glad you did.üò∑üëç
1316171912209477635 2020-10-14 08:20:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are we sure he had it?
1316171305213927424 2020-10-14 08:17:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> uhoh and now AG Barr is in doodoo
1316171142877466624 2020-10-14 08:17:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So destroyed her, but now what. Trump followers do not have enough guts to say no to her
1316140371114631168 2020-10-14 06:14:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or how gullible and hatefilled they are
1316138748220850176 2020-10-14 06:08:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NO ..if people not angry have to wonder what country they are in or what sort of government they want
1316132237805383681 2020-10-14 05:42:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt that interests him
1316132004082208771 2020-10-14 05:41:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I watched @SenWhitehouse, it was educational ..so now she suspects she was bought and paid for ..but she has not withdrawn  ?
1316131550120087552 2020-10-14 05:39:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that a trick question?
1316130946664534016 2020-10-14 05:37:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course it is..

1316126169071341569 2020-10-14 05:18:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seems obvious to me..he has none.
1316125207057367040 2020-10-14 05:14:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gees..hope by now you voted. Thanks for sticking it out
1316121848489410560 2020-10-14 05:01:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump makes her qualified he wants her
1316115786566598658 2020-10-14 04:37:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity we cant withhold their pay as they go through this and ignore us
1316115648381161473 2020-10-14 04:36:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At this point, party should not matter, the people need to come first
1316114412663701505 2020-10-14 04:31:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I lived in PA, voted Republican..then saw what was happening and now glad to say I see @JoeBiden  is winning and as a proud democrat, I am voting for him,
1316113726995652608 2020-10-14 04:28:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> melania where are you?

1316113269401227270 2020-10-14 04:27:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DemocratWit That is one awesome story..thanks and thanks for staying to vote
1316112940597153797 2020-10-14 04:25:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o she is trained too..wondered where melania has been lol
1316112790520836101 2020-10-14 04:25:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are standing in long lines as are white people..and everyone that stands in line to vote is a hero
1316100971655823360 2020-10-14 03:38:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Honestly wondered how many were paid. But I do not care if paid or not, why would someone put such little value on their life, then sign an NDA on top of it?
1316100695901245440 2020-10-14 03:37:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ted Cruz is a very good speaker, but lacking credibility
1316100586870386688 2020-10-14 03:36:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you asked, I missed it
1316100136670564354 2020-10-14 03:34:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even if totally qualified, right now, character has to be lacking to accept the position
1316099907565031424 2020-10-14 03:34:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like he has his hands into every part of government and beyond
1316090315779047424 2020-10-14 02:55:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad Dr Fauci is not planning on caving in to trumps campaign
1316064708454223872 2020-10-14 01:14:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is excellent presentation by Sen Whitehouse. I just wonder if the Judge is aware because if she is not..she has to say no thank you.
1316064402978869249 2020-10-14 01:12:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If watching hearings right now ..educational ..basically showing Amy Barrett has been bought..not sure she knows it but wow

1316046547495387136 2020-10-14 00:02:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better check the mirror. Think she is wrong
1316031314236248066 2020-10-13 23:01:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> has that same obnoxious ,entitled look as someone else
1316031164080107522 2020-10-13 23:00:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC  You want to abolish the ACA and  yet you want us to worry about what you think will happen to the Electoral College?
1316030394911780864 2020-10-13 22:57:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No should not make fun of anyones physical characteristics
1316029660350668807 2020-10-13 22:54:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that THE fly or is it a stroke of genius planted there by Meidas Touch?
1316029091900874753 2020-10-13 22:52:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how many will be too sick to vote after another corona virus spreader
1316009180441051136 2020-10-13 21:33:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if this is where republican,democrat,  independent comes into the conversation . That was totally unthinkable ,until now
1316008726319566848 2020-10-13 21:31:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe someone will ask her
1316008498891837440 2020-10-13 21:30:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Way I understand it, nominated by "friends"
1316002454635507712 2020-10-13 21:06:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not even keep up with COLA just for food
1315998735009185793 2020-10-13 20:52:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you, perhaps if trump went with Dr Fauci and his briefings, comments and questions..trump would be in a better position for reelection or at least  being looked at as  serious candidate who cares about someone besides himself
1315997726795091969 2020-10-13 20:48:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Some of the best  and most influential teachers in my life were black (in the 60s)
1315996565463539715 2020-10-13 20:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You forget what the ABA said
1315996422089699335 2020-10-13 20:42:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thanks for sticking it out.
1315861046708625408 2020-10-13 11:44:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But we all need to be glad the voters did not allow their votes to be suppressed. The republicans are trying every trick in the book and then some. Does my heart good to see voters who love this country..and will tolerate the attempts and vote anyway
1315845427506356225 2020-10-13 10:42:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Some are bound to get it. Why not just put on a stupid mask?
1315845205204045824 2020-10-13 10:41:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC  Once upon a time I liked you, I respected you and I would have sent money ..but that was once upon a time. Now I feel sorry that you sold your soul do not like or respect you and would not send money
1315844752881987585 2020-10-13 10:40:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> insecure people are the biggest bullies
1315844468080287745 2020-10-13 10:39:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC       Maybe you should stop whining?
1315844236508622849 2020-10-13 10:38:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nothing left for the people that need it I guess
1315844018232872962 2020-10-13 10:37:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps as has happened before, some of your pals wanted to do that to stir the pot and blame the dems
1315843728062455808 2020-10-13 10:36:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yes republicans are suppressing votes but not likely there..it has not ceased to amaze and disgust me.  glad no one was hurt..
1315843289581527040 2020-10-13 10:34:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish i saw it
1315843025663340544 2020-10-13 10:33:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I figured since he threw that paper towel at them ..was not worth telling him (let him flounder in his ignorance)
1315842772788817921 2020-10-13 10:32:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I used to think it was ignorance..but they want to remain ignorant..that makes for stupid and stupid follows anyone anywhere
1315842547751759872 2020-10-13 10:31:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not telling them put on masks is extremely selfish
1315835112588742656 2020-10-13 10:01:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can hope he uses that maniacal laugh when he is embarrassed?
1315834831146758145 2020-10-13 10:00:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Must be a fish so what sort of fish is McConnell..sure not human
1315834382922526720 2020-10-13 09:58:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WHO did not agree with you
1315834186440290304 2020-10-13 09:58:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are talking to your base and they must have heard you say your "soldiers" white nationalists were supposed to stand down and be ready  and at other times say there would be problems if you did not win
1315824093132972033 2020-10-13 09:18:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nicely done!
1315823227709652994 2020-10-13 09:14:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do not even care about your followers..you do not tell them wear masks and keep distance. You cannot talk about Joe he does more to prevent covid than you do
1315810734400471040 2020-10-13 08:25:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondered how they could excuse it. So abortions ok if you do not participate?
1315810259185938438 2020-10-13 08:23:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is awesome..but I am afraid some fools will drink the bleach..not realizing it is not bleach..probably soda inside if anything
1315806795584155648 2020-10-13 08:09:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will he (they ) ever be held accountable for all they have done?
1315806556886269952 2020-10-13 08:08:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> forgot you understand my typos so why not understand yours
1315806429811478528 2020-10-13 08:07:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is the child trump is. Did you see how he was signing his tweets with some idiot initials? I tweeted him and said it showed one more reason he should be voted out..kindergartners cant be president..Sent yesterday gone today has to be coincidence but made me smile
1315806036922687490 2020-10-13 08:06:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe he did take an experimental vaccine..one where the side effects are not known because it is an experiment
1315804342918811648 2020-10-13 07:59:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget he would probably throw in a military parade here and there..wonder if he would have the  military goosestep
1315803951539916805 2020-10-13 07:58:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is always lying and I do not understand how his fans do not comprehend it or see it.
1315803593295966208 2020-10-13 07:56:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looking forward to seeing none of them unless it is pictures of them being marched off to jail
1315803150973120512 2020-10-13 07:54:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has no respect for his base, no respect for his family, no respect for anyone ..not even himself..sorry cannot believe I am saying but-trump is an arse
1315802864955031553 2020-10-13 07:53:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> means you have 6666 followers

1315801080354287616 2020-10-13 07:46:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should not have felt so superior and refused the next one.
1315800893737103361 2020-10-13 07:45:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG I love it
1315800679089426433 2020-10-13 07:45:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should wear a mask. They are not political. I do not want to say I told you so.
1315800461702836226 2020-10-13 07:44:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how many of these were paid to attend..and how many will get sick and how many will die? Also wonder if they will have any regrets if they bring it home to their families..did they ask families if they want to get sick for donald?
1315800101051412482 2020-10-13 07:42:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what an obnoxious  lying, threatening S.O.B
1315799867810291713 2020-10-13 07:41:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder the same.. Have you seen Melania?
1315799154237599745 2020-10-13 07:38:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gee isn't that his job?
1315798415238934528 2020-10-13 07:36:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is Obama nothing to do with the insurance I do not think
1315798259538034694 2020-10-13 07:35:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Delusional is correct.
1315798089937162241 2020-10-13 07:34:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Reminds me of what trump is trying to do to Obama.
1315797610746310656 2020-10-13 07:32:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can wish
1315797405120462853 2020-10-13 07:32:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is even worse if it is true
1315797327202918407 2020-10-13 07:31:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @rmsylvia @bobmorehouseNY oh heck saw your response right after i typed mine..same as yours
1315768768392499200 2020-10-13 05:38:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She really is in a difficult spot but she must see what is going on..if she is sincere she will decline for now
1315768411889303553 2020-10-13 05:36:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All I can do is buy the Land O'Lakes products, I do. It is my way of saying thank you
1315767651055140864 2020-10-13 05:33:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does the expression stuck in 2016 mean anything?
1315767441771966466 2020-10-13 05:32:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just released statement-doc says consecutive days tested negative..no idea which consecutive days
1315762846693765123 2020-10-13 05:14:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe if everyone paid attention and took chips off shoulders things would get better...get rid of expression pigs..who do you call when you want help..the police
1315762467721687041 2020-10-13 05:13:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Haven't you noticed that trump lies..Whatever he or repubs argue with or blame dems is what they do
1315752433407197186 2020-10-13 04:33:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has always worked as a mob boss
1315752296622497794 2020-10-13 04:32:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pence has developed a spine!!!! Impressive
1315752110563225605 2020-10-13 04:32:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anyone who has covid and gets through it has immunity..just no idea for how long-they have seen reinfected covid infections within 3 months . trump might write his own rules but eventually he catches up with the mortals
1315751456377581574 2020-10-13 04:29:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice to see that some have come to their senses
1315751303184818178 2020-10-13 04:28:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It won't help. Gets more attention this way and shows how little he thinks of his adoring fans..maybe one day they will understand that
1315750975760719872 2020-10-13 04:27:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My sympathies on your loss..glad she wont be alone.

1315738854197006338 2020-10-13 03:39:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Really wish videos like that not allowed on here. Guy is trying to make hero of himself
1315735445108645889 2020-10-13 03:25:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> go figure..does not say much for sanity or ethics of republicans
1315715011399032833 2020-10-13 02:04:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should know you are doing testing because you care  about people above party. Is there a need for a chance to get people sick?
1315712373068570624 2020-10-13 01:54:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad Biden has sense to take care of himself and those around him

1315710985680846848 2020-10-13 01:48:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> These people are supporting trump not the country not the people, not the Constitution. They all need to go
1315710523036569600 2020-10-13 01:46:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So relieved the long lines are not stopping people from voting!!!! Thank you all.  Vote BLUE that terrifies trump who has earned the blue vote.

1315660934866665473 2020-10-12 22:29:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What I know is they are afraid, feel left out and want someone to make it better..
1315660664971681793 2020-10-12 22:28:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how many will go home and infect their families and who will die as a result of it

1315645723858345986 2020-10-12 21:29:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course if you vote trump it could become Putin land tho looks like it already has..

1315405473009610752 2020-10-12 05:34:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope everyone has enough sense to wear a mask no matter what trump does or says
1315403619391467520 2020-10-12 05:27:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did not see it but we know what donald is he has shown us enough...he might be immune up to 3 months but who knows

1315392618059137024 2020-10-12 04:43:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have not heard a word from or about Melania no idea
1315384829094092804 2020-10-12 04:12:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Fauci I am so glad you spoke up. Can't have been easy.
1315383112805879809 2020-10-12 04:05:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump decided not to appear for debate..now his "doctor" said cant transmit covid..and doc and trump lie..how bout an independent specialist decides if he still can transmit ornot?
1315367101704687617 2020-10-12 03:02:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People that have the money and care about the country are spending the money. It is a great problem, means people are putting a lot of trust in him and believing him to be worth the money
1315360230000164866 2020-10-12 02:34:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is even an ad currently running where Dr Fauci seems to be giving trump credit..when in reality he was complimenting the NIH or CDC not sure..just sure did not look that way in the ad
1315359816110477314 2020-10-12 02:33:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Give grandma a big hug..with a mask please
1315359611839557640 2020-10-12 02:32:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But how do you feel about president trump?
1315358555894173698 2020-10-12 02:28:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow what class..hope they enjoy how they appear to others..trump sure brings out the best in people
1315358301287219201 2020-10-12 02:27:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now you said it outloud so trump wont believe you
1315358182202650630 2020-10-12 02:26:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Obama was fair..the republicans are not
1315357982683803649 2020-10-12 02:25:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oops i did not have to mention it..mcconnell is
1315357797593362432 2020-10-12 02:25:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and..trump has been court packing almost since he got into office
1315347827749531648 2020-10-12 01:45:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I also left. Pathetic, but as donald says .."it is what it is"
1315314976928735233 2020-10-11 23:35:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh lordy here comes all the old headlines that have nothing to do with anything..except maybe more Hilary news.  When does he learn this is 2020 not 2016 and whatever he says is not relevant even if real . #trumphastogo!
1315314555858366466 2020-10-11 23:33:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We do not know where Melania is but I could not listen
1315312850345357312 2020-10-11 23:26:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your father has lost a lot more than money
1315312571176693768 2020-10-11 23:25:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> as long as you guys are out..anything else can be dealt with
1315291291928989697 2020-10-11 22:00:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Forgot to mention, I was also watching Velshi. My only thought was the America that was described had me thinking, that was America, Why do people want to give trumps country the name america. It is not.
1315290092156706816 2020-10-11 21:56:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Patriots are those who love this country and Constitution not the person who is interested in himself not you..and certainly not the Constitution. Patriots stand up for the Country and Constitution not to donate to trump
1315289690392743937 2020-10-11 21:54:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that senior WH official is part of the problem -give up the country for a paycheck and status
1315288155717861377 2020-10-11 21:48:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Brindlepooch limiting intake would probably be very wise üòÑ
1315287944601710593 2020-10-11 21:47:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't even say mine is physical. I live out in the sticks  in a  over 55 development. There were buses running  when I got here, after couple years I sold my car, figuring would not need it because so many means of transportation. Covid came, all transportation stopped.but no car
1315287342727520256 2020-10-11 21:45:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Absolutely does. What bothers me no end..is people believe trump..no matter what he does or says.
1315281639325470721 2020-10-11 21:22:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is what is going on. The theory is to "free them from voting for democrats" Even worse is the propaganda and lies they tell as to why they need to be "freed" Check it out under blexit right at twitter..go out and check it is worse
1315281132884094977 2020-10-11 21:20:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never thought I would not be able to stand in line to vote..but never say never. This is a first for me, very uncomfortable feeling.
1315280796253589504 2020-10-11 21:19:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The truth and you do not have it here
1315280622445830144 2020-10-11 21:18:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bothers me no end , who paid and why- Blexit
1315280202516307968 2020-10-11 21:16:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like your way better..but can only do what I can do. That is excellent
1315276353831424001 2020-10-11 21:01:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I mailed my ballot a week or so ago (Democrat down ballot) and the Elections Board has received it
1315275169439588352 2020-10-11 20:56:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lindsey is a scary thought
1315274973406208000 2020-10-11 20:56:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only problem is if it gets renamed trump would take pride in the new name
1315256958430175235 2020-10-11 19:44:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only ones better off are the ones who did not catch Covid19 (so far)  and are in the top 1 or 2 percent. I totally agree with you, it is why I voted @JoeBiden @SenKamalaHarris
1315256244391809025 2020-10-11 19:41:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Direct answer is..nowhere did he say voters do not deserve to know and that is why he will tell after the election. He did not refuse to answer the question. But do not forget that your candidate won't even answer questions regarding his health..and that is what a refusal is
1315255819970260993 2020-10-11 19:39:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is no other candidate that needs to know where he stands. He said he will respond after the election...we know where you &amp; Trump stand with Barrett, the majority do not want her, yet it does not stop the nomination process. So guess you can wait.
1315125093505339393 2020-10-11 11:00:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You think that is freeing them? People can determine the party they want to vote or independent if they choose.. If you want to encourage people to vote, that is fine but to risk their lives to make a rally look successful?? that is about as selfish&amp; self-serving as you can be2/2
1315125091542405121 2020-10-11 11:00:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @candaceowens Who are you to determine  whether black people have a need to be free?  Something wrong with being a democrat and having ethics? You paid them to go to the white house today and possibly expose themselves to COVID.  1/2
1315122257858105347 2020-10-11 10:49:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pathetic when you think the president who has no certifiable knowledge of medical or immunology etc gets the doctors to seemingly lie for him
1315121128977858561 2020-10-11 10:44:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL LOL LOL sorry for him but LOL he has no compassion for people and he has put this country though hell but I find it funny but sad
1315120576386793473 2020-10-11 10:42:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As this clown show gets on I am so much more confused. Just know I am so glad I voted already...by the time the show is over I might totally lose my mind
1315120256139046913 2020-10-11 10:41:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wobble wobble..
1315119660065583104 2020-10-11 10:38:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ok why do I imagine him scratching his armpits and jumping up and down in this picture?
1315091715888480259 2020-10-11 08:47:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never too late unless you repeat the mistake
1315091295636000769 2020-10-11 08:46:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does that include no use of fetal tissue in medicines that can save lives?
1315091041540861953 2020-10-11 08:45:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gather militias up and put them in a cage that is well guarded. they want to make their own rules, they can do that behind bars
1315090665668259841 2020-10-11 08:43:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well, should we ask which team the fed appeals court is on..and here I had hopes it was country and Constitution over mere mortals and party
1315089895954812931 2020-10-11 08:40:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not realize they were running but we need yet more thing to know why we will not vote for trump
1315089329509691392 2020-10-11 08:38:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe I would say, I was  like you once, then I decided republicans not my type. I got smart and I left. Now excuse me while i go vote
1315087047540039680 2020-10-11 08:29:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They can say as they please but donalds scams dont divert attention ..
1315086760456654860 2020-10-11 08:28:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does not take much to scare Hannity, trump  and that lk
1315086560329699328 2020-10-11 08:27:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too
1315086468755394560 2020-10-11 08:27:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only assume I would stoop to their level, considering my age it might kill me but that is all that would stop me
1315086120858857473 2020-10-11 08:25:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So nice to see reality and it is still Country and Constitution over party and pals
1315085920211791872 2020-10-11 08:24:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I mention those Russia etc indictments were against his people not done by him to clean the swamp. Hope it is now clear to people that might believe it is everyone but trump. It is trump and his pals that are the swamp
1315085499313336320 2020-10-11 08:23:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget, trump will clean the swamp
1315085322569551872 2020-10-11 08:22:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I mention.............Perfect!!
1315085147985915904 2020-10-11 08:21:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thank you
1315085002816786432 2020-10-11 08:21:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are not real..call it fake news or propaganda or whatever you choose, his only scandal that i recall was he wore a tan suit
1315079922688327680 2020-10-11 08:01:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Amazing they all gravitate to the donalds group
1315079696657379333 2020-10-11 08:00:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like a truly kind person
1315079573143461893 2020-10-11 07:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just want to mention the only scandal was his tan suit
1315079361666703360 2020-10-11 07:58:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Try reading about him not at fox or oan or rtv..and without listening to trump  or his trolls..maybe fact check sites would be more helpful if u can put aside your bigotry
1315074692215189506 2020-10-11 07:40:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden will put this country back together (or try) but by your standards it will be boring..no gossipnohate no anger no lies It is not Biden, he is defending,ignoring most of what is said about him&amp;his family. Biden does not need to change his heart, trump needs to develop one
1315073594553249798 2020-10-11 07:35:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§≠üò∑üòÅ
1315071540237611009 2020-10-11 07:27:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in letters about 1/4 inch high one of trumps people said he rejected their endorsement..very meek and mild..maybe saving it for a rainy day
1315070764475985925 2020-10-11 07:24:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Am sure trump is pleased
1315070339781718016 2020-10-11 07:22:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Enough to laugh at that he did do without adding things he did not do
1315070226837450752 2020-10-11 07:22:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I read it...but he did not do it no matter his intent..that counts
1315069702763315201 2020-10-11 07:20:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 2/ 2   https://t.co/Czm2SUg1Zb  Facts matter..
1315069700641091591 2020-10-11 07:20:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump used it to his advantage and it is now worse than ever. That "grand wizard" was not a grand wizard but, Biden did eulogized him ..if you look you will learn he dropped out of the KKK he became a congressman and did  good, that is why Biden eulogized him. 1/2
1315067730815582209 2020-10-11 07:12:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Being president is not being an unfeeling dictator who expects blind obedience no matter what!
1315067369438547969 2020-10-11 07:11:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go read about Obama instead of listening to trump and his sheep discuss him
1315066608197476352 2020-10-11 07:08:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go normal!!!
1315066168286351361 2020-10-11 07:06:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad so few turned out..what I wonder is why so many blue shirts , is it a message to vote blue?
1315065900026998785 2020-10-11 07:05:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Rschooley I hear black people can go anywhere ,conservative or not
1315065442575228929 2020-10-11 07:03:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thank you for the fact check...............
1315064663269400579 2020-10-11 07:00:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like good reason you changed parties..just big mouth yaps who obviously have forgotten there are humans..they are just not one of them
1315038543568351235 2020-10-11 05:16:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I bet only one person would get him to vote right now
1315037819270819846 2020-10-11 05:13:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> strange busy signal instead of video
1315035758873411588 2020-10-11 05:05:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wait for January
1315035682692308992 2020-10-11 05:05:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He could not find fault with Obama so had to invent fault
1315007368879632385 2020-10-11 03:12:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did not realize trump had any sense of decency
1315005136260009986 2020-10-11 03:03:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrum Is he negative or positive..will he be sharing the virus with others as he has all along?  Will he insist on masks and maybe show he cares about others?
1315004383738855430 2020-10-11 03:00:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> US gov account not meant for politics or lies
1315004017983057922 2020-10-11 02:59:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so many in blue..pathetic trump even jealous of that
1314997657035833344 2020-10-11 02:34:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no need for the horns just make people think of trump and his gang of merry "men"  Glad to see no flags from you to make us think of fake patriots.
1314997231301406721 2020-10-11 02:32:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If that is an example..sure would agree
1314996228925554690 2020-10-11 02:28:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I want to visit there and I might never leave
1314996078513655810 2020-10-11 02:27:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do not want the relief package..but not likely Nancy or Chuck do not want it..just not one that benefits the top and omits most others
1314995709544927232 2020-10-11 02:26:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GO BLUE!!
1314995579253149700 2020-10-11 02:25:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> freedom
1314993688318279680 2020-10-11 02:18:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only saw a few minutes. Did not sound very strong or like he believed what he said.
1314993354959134721 2020-10-11 02:17:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mazel tov ..grandma ,mommy and George who is beautiful. Eyes wide open..awesome, watching the world and hoping he sees good things
1314992499363061760 2020-10-11 02:13:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would he think it matters when he respects no one or nothing..he just feels entitled. Right now those at his event today are willing to die or get sick for him so why use ethics or law?
1314992232026509312 2020-10-11 02:12:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> my hero but no prove yet any of his meds are approved or trump is covid19 free
1314992082617094147 2020-10-11 02:11:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Depends your religion and beliefs
1314979829146701825 2020-10-11 01:23:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> friend of mine in The Villages said trump has lost there
1314974971257651201 2020-10-11 01:03:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so many gutless wonders..who got covid, no masks no thoughts and trump had his own covid but did nothing for yours..and not everyone walks out of the hospital some carried out to cemetery
1314973592313094147 2020-10-11 00:58:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gov hearing you say no one was wearing masks in the room reminded me of a kid..why did you speed at 150 mph?  well everyone else did it.   Hope now you would have a different response..like I WILL WEAR A MASK
1314972937351462912 2020-10-11 00:55:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> should not just be ignored..should be stood up too
1314971945432231937 2020-10-11 00:51:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is trump covid tree so he can push his med which is available to only 50000 or so? and not govt approved
1314967939980894210 2020-10-11 00:36:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that would not be a surprise ..or that he plans on losing and will raise all sorts of hell before he goes
1314957925669130245 2020-10-10 23:56:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I inferred should have said it..not as important as law AND this country
1314957272318177280 2020-10-10 23:53:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump and his groupies think of themselves..no regard for what they would cause
1314957061940281346 2020-10-10 23:52:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Excellent judge..contrary to what trump and his minions think, politics is not as important as law. Can't ask for more.
1314956593667112963 2020-10-10 23:50:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anti American?
1314955202080968706 2020-10-10 23:45:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stop trying to divert attention
1314955004013359104 2020-10-10 23:44:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know wherever it originated , had trump worn a mask he most likely would not have gotten it to spread it any further
1314950155783802886 2020-10-10 23:25:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He would be correct, he does not care and it is obvious each time he invites them to die or get really sick for him
1314949769958223872 2020-10-10 23:23:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why does anyone that is proud of who they are have to make excuses?
1314949114879188992 2020-10-10 23:21:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not men and following trumps lead ..to show everyone how inept they are

1314918802942025729 2020-10-10 21:20:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he did not know he would have said so.
1314918634804965379 2020-10-10 21:20:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ok not a Bernie fan..but sure no fan of yours..
1314918184831643648 2020-10-10 21:18:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Know that feeling. Wonder how many  million do the same thing for the same feeling
1314752705425014784 2020-10-10 10:20:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gosh pays for trump to stomp again
1314752040783024128 2020-10-10 10:18:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We do not get his comments just a busy signal
1314751137430597633 2020-10-10 10:14:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still waiting to hear his opinion on this
1314750813957480448 2020-10-10 10:13:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Problem when you do not wear a mask and you lie so much ..tough to believe anything he says
1314742498733043718 2020-10-10 09:40:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt he and trump were in agreement..wondering how they are now..apparently trump still feels that way from his 2000 people that i hope stay home tomorrow and his rally monday..but do wonder how Christy feels now
1314742174395793411 2020-10-10 09:38:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh did not know CDC got an epidemiologist in there to trace..pity not allowed earlier
1314741679488933888 2020-10-10 09:36:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wishing him a speedy complete recovery and sense enough to wear a mask

1314725140677177344 2020-10-10 08:31:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is insane.

1314701021038489601 2020-10-10 06:55:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Am sure canceling the debate will not increase trumps standing in the world
1314700831380381696 2020-10-10 06:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ouch
1314700322665885698 2020-10-10 06:52:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well gee imagine that.
1314700034676588546 2020-10-10 06:51:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wont participate because he cant intimidate or outshout and he has no idea what issues are. He does not want his supporters to see he has no clothes
1314692159585636354 2020-10-10 06:20:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and, he is not part of the committee that determines how the debates go
1314691922775224328 2020-10-10 06:19:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why? Look who he is speaking too..nothing to do with bias just talking to donald with no guts to stand up
1314691571045093376 2020-10-10 06:17:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bias is if you support someone you cant support because they are the same party
1314671815868940288 2020-10-10 04:59:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will do whatever he can , however he can
1314671254067130373 2020-10-10 04:57:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fox says it is true..hope republican..but new ones be out within 3 days..and people who received wrong ones will be listed..which is really kinda evil. Why would they publish names ..they did nothing wrong
1314670602184200193 2020-10-10 04:54:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most will probably sit home..but hope those that attend wear masks
1314670400945651712 2020-10-10 04:53:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so cute

1314669150489505793 2020-10-10 04:48:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not listen...my condolences if you had to sit through it
1314668362958503936 2020-10-10 04:45:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the people who did it are the stupids responsible..the person who encouraged it is the big stupid who loves revenge and violence

1314653945831346183 2020-10-10 03:48:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is hilary running again?
1314653827765854208 2020-10-10 03:47:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is it possible there would be a connection with those who cant think independently and trump who sends out his magic words??
1314653491613315072 2020-10-10 03:46:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SenRonJohnson  who pays for the private plane?
1314651315709136897 2020-10-10 03:37:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hopefully it will end his urge to get outside
1314651090491711488 2020-10-10 03:36:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at least he gets outside
1314650968575946754 2020-10-10 03:36:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would be nice if he showed sincerity and had the audience wear masks ..he might not send covid out but that does not mean others wont share
1314650580288143360 2020-10-10 03:34:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that sounds fair..better than anything else he has said he would do
1314650401485082625 2020-10-10 03:34:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will he care enough to insist on masks?

1314380864512503809 2020-10-09 09:43:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is not looking well or sounding well. If there is nothing there ..there is nothing there whether trump likes it or not
1314370809612427267 2020-10-09 09:03:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So happy for you Justin
1314370165166026752 2020-10-09 09:00:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is defunding police, closing schools and churches because not funding them..mandating masks..excellent idea maybe if more masks worn less Covid 19 and trump would not have landed in the hospital
1314365132428976131 2020-10-09 08:40:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you have totally recuperated
1314364580722868225 2020-10-09 08:38:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just want to clarify for trump and his base
1314364420798246913 2020-10-09 08:37:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> martian space ship? or ball of tar?
1314364258029842432 2020-10-09 08:37:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could?????
1314364050986479617 2020-10-09 08:36:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Keep doing better!!
1314363564115791872 2020-10-09 08:34:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Way to go
1314363326181376001 2020-10-09 08:33:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps rants are about fantasies
1314356308062208002 2020-10-09 08:05:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not likely they vote anyway
1314354764508016641 2020-10-09 07:59:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Knows he will lose because they can shut him up anytime
1314353520188035072 2020-10-09 07:54:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has been since he got into office..COVID just took guardrails off
1314353326075543561 2020-10-09 07:53:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/zwTa472wVk
1314353170093690880 2020-10-09 07:53:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His idea of a joke?
1314345830128717824 2020-10-09 07:23:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought so last night
1314345697257426945 2020-10-09 07:23:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We do not know..seems should be, but he has done a lot of what seems criminal and he keeps going
1314345320415928320 2020-10-09 07:21:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder if his wife lets hm talk to her like that?
1314344155842306048 2020-10-09 07:17:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to ask you this @realDonaldTrump I hear you saying Gold Star Families are to blame for your Covid 19. WEAR A MASK ..who is to blame? YOU ARE.
1314334016766652418 2020-10-09 06:37:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and trump encourages them as he blame BLM who are protestors..
1314332775332409344 2020-10-09 06:32:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I guess that when those that come down with covid realize they should have worn a mask..it will be too late
1314332574152564736 2020-10-09 06:31:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think Jr is lost
1314332107536240649 2020-10-09 06:29:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> An answer has been given over and over by Biden..you might not like it but it was answered
1314330783696531456 2020-10-09 06:24:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nowhere to run, wish their was
1314330276127019009 2020-10-09 06:22:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should no longer be allowed on Fox
1314329524868452352 2020-10-09 06:19:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't be that it is his own fault..no mask?
1314315070755741698 2020-10-09 05:21:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't hide who the phonies are anymore and it is not Gov Whitmer
1314312650998853632 2020-10-09 05:12:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Either he got tested or the fly got him
1314310561702858754 2020-10-09 05:03:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then there is this  https://t.co/yoa6rWaHTB
1314310002451062795 2020-10-09 05:01:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump   @JoeBiden  I just do not understand how a pro life president is now pushing regeneron which among its other ingredients includes fetal tissue  https://t.co/XE0ufR9P0A
1314308328328101888 2020-10-09 04:54:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know trump has not been all there for a long time..term of endearment.. this medication has put him over the edge
1314307535902515208 2020-10-09 04:51:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe some want sanity?
1314307271661441024 2020-10-09 04:50:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you ever watch how admiringly Pence looks at trump.  He is afraid to not adore
1314304735336374285 2020-10-09 04:40:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all getting to crazy..25th amendment ASAP
1314301192764301335 2020-10-09 04:26:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is exactly who we need..it is why trump is trying every trick in the book to stop Biden
1314300323276693510 2020-10-09 04:23:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh great!!!
1314300146725908481 2020-10-09 04:22:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't understand why 25th amendment can not be used? By now even his supporters must see this is not normal even for   him
1314268215170789381 2020-10-09 02:15:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 50 million people watched the fly nest on pences head?
1314267056481669123 2020-10-09 02:10:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> write it!
1314255302024474627 2020-10-09 01:24:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heartbroken..tho think should be over million
1314255167961923584 2020-10-09 01:23:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your mind is running like mine. Poor us
1314255069672624128 2020-10-09 01:23:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will he comment?
1314253192201490432 2020-10-09 01:15:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this has to be on twitter?
1314252668798406659 2020-10-09 01:13:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> right now FBI is discussing a plot to kidnap a governor and there you are in fake news you trumplikins have created
1314252362895233025 2020-10-09 01:12:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> go have another drink
1314247949224947714 2020-10-09 00:55:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is so crazy just like the rest of the country. Just hope not a republican thing..just some idiots
1314222849587130368 2020-10-08 23:15:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not take it as such..tho has said lot of racist comments, more a kid in the schoolyard..ran out of vocabulary so stomps his feet raises his fist and says 'you , you , you monster you '
1314222045383847938 2020-10-08 23:12:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cant be big enough distance
1314221643020017664 2020-10-08 23:10:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Down the road when other jobs available
1314221521204895744 2020-10-08 23:10:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not want virtual because they can shut him up when he is off on one of his rants
1314210352050008066 2020-10-08 22:25:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He won't want to comprehend that. He is saying that he does not want to do this virtually because he could be cut off and that would mean can't outshout or change topics
1314203032435916802 2020-10-08 21:56:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has no strategy because he chooses not to relate. How can you fix something when you do not care if it is broken
1314202700049866754 2020-10-08 21:55:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump ignores the 211,000 Americans..he cant relate to that
1314202525839446019 2020-10-08 21:54:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> flies can always spot crap
1314202458168664064 2020-10-08 21:54:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not knowing trumps plans to stay in office or leave, I would take nothing for granted about @JoeBiden  political coalition.
1314197923140382721 2020-10-08 21:36:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps you should move to Russia and take others like you with you.  Your comment is certainly not American
1314195491555606528 2020-10-08 21:26:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was pence that did not answer most questions. Did you even watch? https://t.co/3WH0WoXCkL
1314194450449653762 2020-10-08 21:22:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe you need to read what Joe Biden said about fracking
1314194047674744832 2020-10-08 21:20:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do fact check @mallen2010..I think last time I heard it said (not first time though) was his town hall..but wherever it was, it was AGAIN said loudly and clearly on camera. Fact check
1314192808438358020 2020-10-08 21:15:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oddly enough that is exactly what @joebiden said.
1314046406324367360 2020-10-08 11:34:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Flies can always spot poop
1314038899145146371 2020-10-08 11:04:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would have ruined that perfect do
1314038601555030016 2020-10-08 11:03:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> believe she answered all but one
1314038413344079872 2020-10-08 11:02:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was watching wondering if he has been tested..if not he should be
1314033454523260929 2020-10-08 10:42:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He was too busy thanking the moderator or Kamala for the question or going back to the previous question
1314033139220611072 2020-10-08 10:41:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering if he knows where embryonic stem cells come from?  and how he feels as a prolifer with that judge he is trying to get thru
1314032430639190017 2020-10-08 10:38:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pence took lessons from donald
1314031891658440705 2020-10-08 10:36:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trying to remember where I first heard that expression
1314031151468679169 2020-10-08 10:33:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To me he never had it
1314031041515008003 2020-10-08 10:33:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does say thank you each time though
1314030892046839815 2020-10-08 10:32:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mike Pence lies as easily as trump..thought u were more selective
1314030664967229443 2020-10-08 10:31:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> quite a nose that fly had
1314030511015292934 2020-10-08 10:31:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the fly could find a pile of poop anywhere
1313998276182638600 2020-10-08 08:22:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TwitterSupport tried to support a qanon name but the name i reported does not seem to be that  https://t.co/qADNZgve56 says I did not report it.what to do?
1313997365213360128 2020-10-08 08:19:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was eating a cookie..now I have to clean the mess
1313969136456916995 2020-10-08 06:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who said navaro has any class or brain?
1313968851600760832 2020-10-08 06:26:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We do not even know what works yet.
1313968567885463560 2020-10-08 06:24:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he notices he does not look well so now he wants to look sicker
1313968369314533376 2020-10-08 06:24:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So glad Carly Fiorina has a spine..and loves this country
1313968132831182849 2020-10-08 06:23:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden makes clear what his issues are you just need to read it..as for other dems ask them.  Now about daddy? Is he still covid19 full?
1313963577791873024 2020-10-08 06:05:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad we can count on you to report facts
1313963249059201024 2020-10-08 06:03:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jaketapper Then he again blames fake media, fake news, Hillary, and the list is endless
1313962120921387009 2020-10-08 05:59:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why? I prefer not to catch Covid19 will also protect from flu so why would I go in maskless this year?
1313961224590315528 2020-10-08 05:55:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is his color weird or is it the video?
1313951467229851649 2020-10-08 05:16:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just need to get him there
1313951287042617345 2020-10-08 05:16:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you ask her if she listened to trump to figure that out?  https://t.co/ZcdnEawpA6
1313950451856015365 2020-10-08 05:12:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 1..really looks bad 2 not really covid?
1313950308331073536 2020-10-08 05:12:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would not miss it..please, do not forget your mask behind the plexiglass
1313948674188288001 2020-10-08 05:05:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How can anyone get to be an executive if they cant think and tell fact from fantasy?
1313948392121397248 2020-10-08 05:04:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> knows he is losing so clutching straws
1313948047286599680 2020-10-08 05:03:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is only for those not intimidated by a bully
1313947895700361220 2020-10-08 05:02:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you are a pip
1313942497337454594 2020-10-08 04:41:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guessing she is a republican lol
1313942377434931200 2020-10-08 04:40:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They absolutely do! üòÅ
1313942239735939074 2020-10-08 04:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder how she will appreciate herself when she sees what everyone else saw
1313942090716512258 2020-10-08 04:39:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lady ..said with some hesitation I wonder how you like what you see when you see you on that video?
1313941642404134914 2020-10-08 04:37:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what about symptom free mentally?
1313935222631792650 2020-10-08 04:12:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Time for trump to leave..and @joebiden to start fixing this mess
1313934533134254082 2020-10-08 04:09:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never would have guessed
1313934282847551488 2020-10-08 04:08:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My heart hurts for you.
1313934135090647041 2020-10-08 04:08:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pay wall says it all..besides if I just look around that tells it all
1313933800473341954 2020-10-08 04:06:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry to hear the problems you have had, speedy recovery is wished to you.
1313929060658094082 2020-10-08 03:47:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is your question a serious question? I think he should send it then we shall see
1313928535782887430 2020-10-08 03:45:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> same as what you see
1313928445458612225 2020-10-08 03:45:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> makes this sound like a game
1313922287654113291 2020-10-08 03:20:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know he is not in the basement to stay healthy
1313909425837617153 2020-10-08 02:29:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How do we know he is the one blurting tweets out?

1313906534754246658 2020-10-08 02:18:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would really like to know who posted that bail
1313906243099074560 2020-10-08 02:17:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Betting she is very proud of you..Condolences to you
1313905042173222913 2020-10-08 02:12:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree..and that is heartbreaking
1313904401111810049 2020-10-08 02:09:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was 2005 and he was elected after nastyc omments, insults etc..why bother with it now?
1313904213160849408 2020-10-08 02:09:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sometimes truth hurts. This is DISGUSTING because it is true
1313902612882894848 2020-10-08 02:02:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nothing between now and election day will be truth from them..just hoping for votes
1313902459040026626 2020-10-08 02:02:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good eye for paying attention and removing letters..wondering what country he is in?
1313901835053346817 2020-10-08 01:59:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Plexiglass and mask?
1313901511538339840 2020-10-08 01:58:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering who posted that kind of bond?
1313901321121038336 2020-10-08 01:57:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you!! To you and many like you
1313900793058267142 2020-10-08 01:55:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think something stronger than whine..so it reflects job well done satisfaction
1313900553777352711 2020-10-08 01:54:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> First 4 yrs dont count, practice run, once in does not want out..besides he will still do what he is thinks he is so good at..sucker people
1313900285543276546 2020-10-08 01:53:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sigh
1313895637973336064 2020-10-08 01:35:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you had told me in 2019 that Americans having no concern for fellow Americans so standing in a group with no masks spreading Covid..I would have thought you were insane
1313895380589965312 2020-10-08 01:34:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could it be Covid and unlike trump the police there want to stop it? Sensible to me if that is what it is about
1313889074395131904 2020-10-08 01:09:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be nice to get ANY information and know it is not disinformation
1313888783797022723 2020-10-08 01:07:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When any clearance in Florida is given for any activity..remember the facts never mind the clearances
1313888395530317825 2020-10-08 01:06:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> And we know this is true, how?
1313879146255310849 2020-10-08 00:29:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee who couldn't see it coming ..particularly when trump said I believe before elected..I will do the same for the USA I have done for my businesses
1313870745794207749 2020-10-07 23:56:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fantastic!
1313870462905184256 2020-10-07 23:55:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hidden talent
1313869532608507910 2020-10-07 23:51:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden needs more of a lead..never enough this election
1313867911736569858 2020-10-07 23:44:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope that means favorable rulings as in Supreme Court will say "gee sorry, would like to help you but law says...." Those would be favorable rulings
1313867373569507328 2020-10-07 23:42:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> need too uh?
1313851407037091840 2020-10-07 22:39:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the trumps are not known for respect for anyone..not even themselves
1313851131307663361 2020-10-07 22:38:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If not voting at all they are voting for trump without taking responsibility for it
1313850107746541569 2020-10-07 22:34:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still spreading the bull? This is nothing to do with Hillary just yet one more bit of propaganda and diversion
1313849153592713216 2020-10-07 22:30:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot imagine me ever voting republican  again
1313848988953653250 2020-10-07 22:29:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> means trump world will all get crazier
1313839204992978949 2020-10-07 21:50:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mute-Major tool of those that do not want to hear this gibberish. You have the right to speak, that does not mean we MUST listen. You have the right to spread lies, propaganda or other conspiracy theories,again, does not mean we must listen while you abuse your freedom of speech.
1313678558951362560 2020-10-07 11:12:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As it should be
1313675751850479617 2020-10-07 11:01:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> white house pay all the bills? sure hope so,,well, donald not white house
1313675532391911426 2020-10-07 11:00:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @KFILE @EricTrump you really need to learn what you are talking about
1313673966742110209 2020-10-07 10:54:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His head is normally full of crickets..hate to be in his head now though..crickets and an entire zoo
1313672639743959042 2020-10-07 10:48:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pathetically well done..almost made me feel sorry for him again
1313671507642642437 2020-10-07 10:44:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at all that space and all those masks..impressively awesome
1313671241161740288 2020-10-07 10:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That would explain why no one has an answer that is the answer. Hope @JoeBiden  did not take his mask off for anything that night
1313670861359116288 2020-10-07 10:41:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think maybe panic combined with his meds
1313670577778032640 2020-10-07 10:40:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone with some money..not most of california
1313670446995451910 2020-10-07 10:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not keeping his mask on either
1313666320286785537 2020-10-07 10:23:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anything Biden does will be better
1313665641241403392 2020-10-07 10:21:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everyone needs to complete the 2020 census , money and so much depend on it
1313665433770352645 2020-10-07 10:20:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was really good..covered everything
1313664572390334465 2020-10-07 10:16:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is the medicine..doubt he was even aware of what he was saying
1313664372833746944 2020-10-07 10:16:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe getting his brain back or someone is keeping an eye on him
1313661063351631872 2020-10-07 10:02:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is stupid. stop testing just means it spreads further
1313660852214673408 2020-10-07 10:02:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and yet they wont use the expertise of the CDC
1313660639710240770 2020-10-07 10:01:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and in any way possible he has been screwing the American public (including his supporters) since he has been in office, the irony and anger not lost on me.
1313660254459228163 2020-10-07 09:59:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is justice!!!!
1313660111680872448 2020-10-07 09:59:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wishing you a speedy complete recovery. and hope the spread stopped with you
1313659900866834433 2020-10-07 09:58:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> makes sense to me
1313659733698633728 2020-10-07 09:57:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> as disgraceful and disgusting now as it was when it all started
1313656231307997186 2020-10-07 09:43:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden cannot be high enough ..EVERYONE HAS TO VOTE BLUE, if not, it is a vote for trump
1313655925291528192 2020-10-07 09:42:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't stop now ..have to vote people, no vote is a vote for trump
1313655726951276544 2020-10-07 09:41:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> new guy has a reputation going down the tubes .
1313655010887163907 2020-10-07 09:38:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gee u think?
1313651527421132800 2020-10-07 09:25:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just wondering if trump told Dr Conley to say that he has met or exceeded expectations , reported no symptoms and had a restful night ?
1313651127938883588 2020-10-07 09:23:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have been and am wondering.
1313650977791246338 2020-10-07 09:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is correct. Maybe his supporters want to die for him..Biden is not his supporter
1313650395160424449 2020-10-07 09:20:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This needed no explanation, his words speak very well for himself
1313635483033964545 2020-10-07 08:21:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She is trying, your pals are preventing it
1313635238220836864 2020-10-07 08:20:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/4grUJC1HkB
1313634563474763777 2020-10-07 08:17:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His daddy would hit the roof
1313634032773627909 2020-10-07 08:15:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not wish badly on anyone, just sometimes seems so difficult not too
1313633676190789633 2020-10-07 08:14:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He always turns his back on the lower classes..bet not on his own kind (the kind whose father left him millions so he could blow it all)
1313631582314524674 2020-10-07 08:05:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probable more to do with trump and mcconnell in concert
1313631333487439882 2020-10-07 08:04:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> keep believing fake news and ignoring real news and facts
1313604980683812869 2020-10-07 06:20:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aod for some congress cannot put Country, Constitution, people FIRST ahead of trump and fear
1313604544857808896 2020-10-07 06:18:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seems like his brain is gone..even for him sounds a bit weird
1313604418869383168 2020-10-07 06:17:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sorry, wonder if trump was there? My sincere condolences to his family.
1313602250883903489 2020-10-07 06:09:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If they can't get inspired to VOTE from what is happening to this country, they need to know if they do not vote...THAT IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP
1313601976933003272 2020-10-07 06:08:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump      Can he really think that blackmailing this country will get him reelected? NO WAY
1313601399884861440 2020-10-07 06:05:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Major networks should show Bidens speech from earlier today
1313601124830785536 2020-10-07 06:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everything he is saying is lies
1313598344804081664 2020-10-07 05:53:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @politvidchannel @facebook  excellent!!!
1313579356707586053 2020-10-07 04:38:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yup am watching.. you are right
1313579276722204677 2020-10-07 04:37:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is true but he still has free rein and that is the scarypart
1313579071620763653 2020-10-07 04:37:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Each time we think he cant go lower he does and I truly do not know where it will end
1313568647332454404 2020-10-07 03:55:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still shaking  my head
1313568153364987904 2020-10-07 03:53:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how he was paid off? more rolls of paper towels?
1313560084375498754 2020-10-07 03:21:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is truly a dirt bag and shows how little he cares for people
1313543806256586752 2020-10-07 02:17:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you say that with a straight face?
1313543259675820033 2020-10-07 02:14:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and don't forget that unapproved expensive medication is not available for all
1313543110396448769 2020-10-07 02:14:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They should not be visible
1313537998122897410 2020-10-07 01:53:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who cares? Those who have a grain of a brain know not to vote for him..rest do not matter
1313537776730681344 2020-10-07 01:53:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will  ignore that, he is president, they just give fine treatment away..never costs anything in his head
1313533118117302273 2020-10-07 01:34:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> choking on it
1313516211641221126 2020-10-07 00:27:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LtGovNunez  No wondery ou are lt gov. Do not have to think to be in office in FL just obey your president
1313515809721942017 2020-10-07 00:25:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt he had no idea what this means..so @realDonaldTrump ..so there is no doubt..he means they cant comment because those people are dead.
1313514283511279617 2020-10-07 00:19:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more and more been thinking "jim jones"
1313514177550602240 2020-10-07 00:19:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is not just the person stupid enough to attend r wear masks,.it is their families, friends, the cashier at the store , the teachers, the police etc.
1313513778328240129 2020-10-07 00:17:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> little difference but not much..just shows his usual disregard for everything and everyone but himself
1313513296117608448 2020-10-07 00:15:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Said months ago he wants to win and does not care what the cost is..geesus
1313511078148661250 2020-10-07 00:06:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i am trying to remember this is saying how the ending can be ..not to encourage trump behavior
1313495651473391617 2020-10-06 23:05:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What a silly question..he wants to be big strong man to get reelected..just shows opposite of what he wants is all
1313494356096159746 2020-10-06 23:00:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry for your loss
1313491332170690563 2020-10-06 22:48:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She stares out and says is this worth all the money?
1313491096471826437 2020-10-06 22:47:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Is that a joke?
1313490656380227585 2020-10-06 22:45:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Blessed be the patient people..hope you have on a mask and brought lunch and maybe dinner
1313485859568717824 2020-10-06 22:26:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he talks about them..he needs to wear them, but then if he did that he most likely would not have spent time in the hospital and not be a breeding farm for covid now. You are angry? How many have been infected from contact with him in just the last few days.
1313485284164673536 2020-10-06 22:24:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who has trump spoken too recently
1313477089711067139 2020-10-06 21:51:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if they don't think they should wait?
1313476727054663682 2020-10-06 21:50:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would they object to the plexiglass? One has to wonder.
1313468990606520321 2020-10-06 21:19:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üò°
1313467302680178688 2020-10-06 21:13:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry for all catching covid from this "covid donnie". Best wishes for a speedy complete recovery. Wish I could believe trump was just so pumped full of drugs he had no idea this is a contagious disease..but I do not
1313466219882786817 2020-10-06 21:08:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Which nation deserves this?
1313465526354669571 2020-10-06 21:05:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not that I don't think donald is capable of anything..but this could not have been trumps October surprise..could it? Or am I turning into  a conspiracy theorist now?
1313464337051328512 2020-10-06 21:01:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He had so much goodwill going for him after his diagnosis..then he went out for a joyride, risking others. Then he went to the w.h. and made it into another reality show video. We won't even discuss what "he learned" So much for goodwill.
1313463478074699776 2020-10-06 20:57:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is good that voters have time to see what and who trump is..
1313463198520049666 2020-10-06 20:56:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You have made the court political just in the headline. Democrats are flirting with destruction? What about putting someone in the court who will guarantee that the court is overwhelmingly  political ?  You do not think that will cause destruction of any integrity in the Court?
1313295546388541440 2020-10-06 09:50:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @AlwaysElpida was so civilized it was shocking
1313295428243394560 2020-10-06 09:50:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Apparently there is not one of that bunch of bananas that know anything about the virus, they just believe the trump
1313294848221499394 2020-10-06 09:47:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why are these so watched? I am ignoring all but this one just to ask
1313294631023542272 2020-10-06 09:46:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But we saw, we enjoyed
1313290320776433664 2020-10-06 09:29:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good thing is even without support from most of the media ..we saw it anyway and it was excellent #JoeBidenTownHall
1313289346334760967 2020-10-06 09:25:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Potus lies a lot
1313289105841717253 2020-10-06 09:24:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not have to accomplish anything, he just has to have you believe he did
1313287309987655680 2020-10-06 09:17:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Supposed to pretend
1313287099198640134 2020-10-06 09:16:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is a very polite and understated response
1313283778752770049 2020-10-06 09:03:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> totally enjoy hearing @JoeBiden ..so peaceful, well thought and informative.
1313278531032551424 2020-10-06 08:42:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching you..can only say..go @JoeBiden
1313278244670631936 2020-10-06 08:41:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Tooda @TeamJoe @CNBC o wait..I did üíôüòá
1313278132426739712 2020-10-06 08:41:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Tooda @TeamJoe @CNBC Me too
1313277929024114696 2020-10-06 08:40:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did rudy get tested?
1313268361430806529 2020-10-06 08:02:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly needs approval of more than they can get approval for
1313267983842672643 2020-10-06 08:01:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Used to think it was ignorance. Now I know..sheer stupidity
1313267754888290305 2020-10-06 08:00:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to vote blue if you need to crawl on glass
1313267590530301953 2020-10-06 07:59:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could not believe what I saw
1313254257144082432 2020-10-06 07:06:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is what i figure..but you are right something does not seem right. Now he is abusing everyone for his own ego. Turned back on white house do not want to see this
1313248978943840257 2020-10-06 06:45:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the way his mind functions is very scary..he is not out of the woods for another week and one of those meds are for sickest of sick
1313248092888727552 2020-10-06 06:41:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has hospital facilities at the w.h.
1313247956494168076 2020-10-06 06:41:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not so sure Walter Reed would damage its name for him
1313246726766178309 2020-10-06 06:36:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What do you really believe?
1313246534738341890 2020-10-06 06:35:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like everything else..publicity stunt
1313236228297424898 2020-10-06 05:54:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tell me this is a joke?
1313235597083971591 2020-10-06 05:52:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> such a shock..
1313235170716192771 2020-10-06 05:50:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he was not in world class hospital I would think he did not...doubt they would ruin their reputation for him and ..covid does work different ways on different people..and he is pumped full of drugs right now..and he is not out of trouble yet and his drugs not all approved and
1313225636329160704 2020-10-06 05:12:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pence trump puppet no not call off- proper safety precautions ..stick pence behind plastic wall
1313219911771095040 2020-10-06 04:50:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can pretend we are in the white house ignoring covid like trump did
1313210297583316993 2020-10-06 04:11:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where did you get that from?
1313209833294835712 2020-10-06 04:09:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should tell him had he worn a mask..he probably would not have gone to the hospital
1313195534665109505 2020-10-06 03:13:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would Walter Reed Participate? They have a world class reputation..not likely they would destroy it
1313191390357192704 2020-10-06 02:56:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or..different people affected in dif ways..and he is prob leaving tho docs want him to stay..and patients will be thrilled he is gone
1313187889707188224 2020-10-06 02:42:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should tell him is does not feel better just med says he does..should also tell him those are test meds and still not all vetted..but on top of that it affects different people different ways ..should have been under trump admin months ago, since they knew and did nothing
1313172171930374146 2020-10-06 01:40:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to not vote is a vote for trump
1313172020918661120 2020-10-06 01:39:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he has not learned in all this time, he wont now
1313171768476160009 2020-10-06 01:38:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still wish her and the rest well..for a complete recovery
1313164384500428800 2020-10-06 01:09:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Goes with the rest of the man made insanity in this country now
1313128484189937666 2020-10-05 22:46:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1313125289992519680 2020-10-05 22:34:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is also the fact that CV19 affects different people in different ways..not every case is as serious as many cases.
1313124567859240970 2020-10-05 22:31:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Too late, I already voted blue..and I refuse to do it again
1313124317719343107 2020-10-05 22:30:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> better health care he wont discuss or show- must be great
1313123874775748610 2020-10-05 22:28:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go look at all details..dont forget, wear a mask
1313123701819400194 2020-10-05 22:27:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Imagination and role playing now a bad thing?
1313123509829279745 2020-10-05 22:26:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget how he will also say .."see I knew Covid19 was not so bad" (he forgets that different people react in different ways and most do not get meds like he gets)
1313110473441673216 2020-10-05 21:35:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/x0gt6EXzfp
1313110238137118722 2020-10-05 21:34:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ChuckGrassley  Do you wear your mask to protect yourself and others?
1312926591538913280 2020-10-05 09:24:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He had that behavior before
1312926362215342080 2020-10-05 09:23:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have not seen that but I am thinking Covid+trump=hoax
1312914437620277248 2020-10-05 08:36:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I might laugh all night (and not even feel a little ashamed)
1312913854654025728 2020-10-05 08:33:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL LOVE IT
1312913638244724736 2020-10-05 08:32:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wants to be reelected ..and thinks that will do it..he does not care about the rest
1312910644379820033 2020-10-05 08:21:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would I watch so many conspiracy theorists in one place for so long?
1312910004656181248 2020-10-05 08:18:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Made me angry. How to disrespect a fine hospital and its doctors to amuse the ego of a "president who says he has covid" but wants to win reelection and does not care if he sets himself back or risks the lives of the people in the car
1312909348205666304 2020-10-05 08:15:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I DID VOTE..but nothing I can click says that üòáüíô
1312909020664156162 2020-10-05 08:14:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sad..maybe she will change
1312904581513457666 2020-10-05 07:56:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I felt and feel the same way.
1312898162722471936 2020-10-05 07:31:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or a joyride around the block?
1312897538073210880 2020-10-05 07:29:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt he wants it to be his Chloroquine  and it will save his votes
1312896403421700096 2020-10-05 07:24:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very nicely said @jaketapper
1312896205454749696 2020-10-05 07:23:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is playing all of this and safety be damned
1312890100733349891 2020-10-05 06:59:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry Stephanie
1312886796410392576 2020-10-05 06:46:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope CNN pulled the plug on Jason..if so congratulations @CNN
1312872877658648576 2020-10-05 05:51:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Insanity!!!
1312872759899426817 2020-10-05 05:50:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I suppose should be thankful he did not jump out of the car to shake hands
1312872302628032516 2020-10-05 05:48:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was bad enough if he returned to the White House..but out for a joyride with COVID? no words
1312872095181877249 2020-10-05 05:47:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree, even if it was virus caused him to get up and go, he is not fit to be pres..so needs the insurance of those ads to reinforce that he needs to go
1312871619342331912 2020-10-05 05:46:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I guess he bullies Walter Reed too ..they need to take away his tv and sedate him so he has no clue
1312870594518671361 2020-10-05 05:41:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget the people in that car he put in danger. They need to take his tv out and deal with his temper tantrums. Only good thing out of this is I think he will lose more votes
1312868781358821379 2020-10-05 05:34:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are on med, could make you feel better..can hit you later make you worse. Truly hope you have your face covered..and tell your supporters to go home so others in that hospital can rest
1312868275953561603 2020-10-05 05:32:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me me me me ..he just wants reality tv..hope he tells them go home and he loses votes because of this
1312867582345707520 2020-10-05 05:29:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is so misunderstanding all of this..hope he went back to Walter Reed with masks
1312866943704199174 2020-10-05 05:27:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yet one more reason he is not qualified to be president. Wonder how he will feel when meds wear off..cause he knows better
1312866524269547531 2020-10-05 05:25:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No sooner did i say that then he was gone..no respect for anyone
1312865847015354368 2020-10-05 05:23:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wah wah I wanna go home
1312864157939703808 2020-10-05 05:16:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doctors are speaking to Donald  and do not want to upset him..Can't blame them if worse than they are making it sound..not so much political as mood
1312858957321469966 2020-10-05 04:55:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Happy Birthday Noah..hope you are. sharing your cupcakes with your admirers. Sounds like you have all the qualities of a good son and excellent human
1312858032968290312 2020-10-05 04:52:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was my thought when I saw this initially
1312857143557619713 2020-10-05 04:48:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think all in the wording
1312856910907965441 2020-10-05 04:47:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all crazy..absolutely insanely crazy
1312856794914525186 2020-10-05 04:47:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such a shock
1312856701348048899 2020-10-05 04:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> HARD NOT TO AGREE WITH THAT
1312856472922066946 2020-10-05 04:45:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just wish trump had said put on masks most of this would be moot points. Hope when he gets out he will have guts enough to say, "I was wrong put on a mask'
1312851276451938306 2020-10-05 04:25:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> jesus..
1312842217124442113 2020-10-05 03:49:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTE BLUE AS YOU CAN ..everyone has to vote in huge numbers..YOU CANNOT STAY HOME. This is a bit fishy
1312841975662555139 2020-10-05 03:48:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Seems bit odd..has to be somewhere or someway to check machines
1312832172257153035 2020-10-05 03:09:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He probably as looked around and asked himself..what did I do it all for? RIP Amb Schifter
1312831789380112384 2020-10-05 03:07:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is he shuddering or just disgusted
1312823489536110595 2020-10-05 02:34:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he were a patriot or really loved our country he would have put on a mask by March and told the damn truth
1312823218256990208 2020-10-05 02:33:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @politvidchannel thank you Marine
1312823147255783428 2020-10-05 02:33:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The mask you are using in that picture is not effective. There are masks with adjustable ear pieces, nose pieces and made of good materials..just learn how to put it on to cover nose and mouth.
1312822023324864512 2020-10-05 02:28:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Really nicely done..and it is true..hope the republicans can now get up the guts to put on masks
1312820533994696705 2020-10-05 02:23:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What an amazing back story.
1312820097053069312 2020-10-05 02:21:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hoping we will see something different now (But not counting on it..just hoping)
1312819247102357505 2020-10-05 02:17:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope anyone in trumps sphere (even the photographer) is masked up
1312818229040087043 2020-10-05 02:13:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess it is easier to drop out then face being fired.
1312817866538770432 2020-10-05 02:12:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because trump wants to convey strength overseas, good or bad trump wont stay in the hospital if he has a say, good or bad, he wont give completely honest report ..besides he wants to get reelected
1312805290459398151 2020-10-05 01:22:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad citizenry is realizing  Biden was made for this moment
1312804914008129537 2020-10-05 01:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could not relate..this is probably first time in his life he cant control what is happening and has learned he is a mere mortal
1312804261659639809 2020-10-05 01:18:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably true..but facing the fact you really are not G-d might be life altering
1312803669746872321 2020-10-05 01:16:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will wait to see for myself..he  has suddenly learned he is a mortal ..might be true but last for couple days..or might not be true at all..
1312793866576240643 2020-10-05 00:37:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought the docs were a little more honest today..but still think that the salute to the fearless leader takes away from facts. As long as that continues, I think it speaks volumes..military is not supposed to be political
1312791138726809600 2020-10-05 00:26:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if it even sinks in to trump or his pals
1312790306715246592 2020-10-05 00:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope it helped  David üòá
1312781449767026688 2020-10-04 23:47:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In trumps wanderings at Walter Reed, is he wearing masks? Not so nice to hear applause for the fearless leader prefacing all remarks. Nice to see questions answered..
1312779691858767872 2020-10-04 23:40:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not on his list of meds or treatments..do not encourage the fools..
1312779515681267718 2020-10-04 23:40:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For a change we can compliment @MarkMeadows  but trump still has learned nothing
1312779152181923842 2020-10-04 23:38:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> These people need to stand up to trump and put on freaking masks.
1312778921738481665 2020-10-04 23:37:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only say MASKS
1312778757493657604 2020-10-04 23:37:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fools..no mask..just fools
1312778566896160769 2020-10-04 23:36:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just saw and heard the cars, horns and people outside Walter Reed..mostly trump supporters..naturally no regard for patients inside ..they are there for their health.I am sure that racket does not help their recovery. If any of you see this, go home show a brain,someconsideration
1312776735646244869 2020-10-04 23:28:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> MASKS that are placed correctly
1312776390203314181 2020-10-04 23:27:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know what the A stands for..and you "ain't" no lady
1312771772190781440 2020-10-04 23:09:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/JxrLBgxcKb
1312771453134274561 2020-10-04 23:07:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> such an astute observation lol
1312771213085863937 2020-10-04 23:07:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also more responsible adults..
1312765558224490498 2020-10-04 22:44:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why do so many republicans think they are so indestructible or is it noncaring?
1312764953212977155 2020-10-04 22:42:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bye bye @LindseyGrahamSC
1312764332363653121 2020-10-04 22:39:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A usual non-answer..why can't I get used to those responses?
1312741586397265921 2020-10-04 21:09:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôèüò•üò°
1312741032249954307 2020-10-04 21:07:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am truly glad you got the once in.
1312740456204304384 2020-10-04 21:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Poor Jr What about the trust of the American people who are more than one person ..you whine and make excuses just like daddy..and what about all you have done in the name of your father..and what about your father? talk about trust..
1312739847564648448 2020-10-04 21:02:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was hopeful to see some sort of change..no changes unless maybe worse
1312735751830994949 2020-10-04 20:46:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> proud boys showing how ignorant they are..bet not one has sense enough to fact check..or wear a mask
1312735492098666496 2020-10-04 20:45:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is a clear choice..and it is not you
1312735072655736832 2020-10-04 20:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wish daddy well but he has not worked for the American people since he got into office and since last January even less. Stop the propaganda
1312729289838792705 2020-10-04 20:20:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice to finally realize  Corona will cause republicans to pay a price ..guess you have now learned CV19 does not care what party you belong too. Hope you have learned masks have nothing to do with politics and start wearing them.
1312728683568869377 2020-10-04 20:18:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think Bob Woodward wanted as many facts as he could gather.
1312566462104600578 2020-10-04 09:33:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can hope
1312565821441478656 2020-10-04 09:30:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to think I used to like Lindsey Graham until he sold the USA and Constitution down the river for allegiance to donald
1312565217415569408 2020-10-04 09:28:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was there a mouse under grahams  podium? Wish I saw this..nice job @harrisonjaime
1312564031199346690 2020-10-04 09:23:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> certainly brings it home
1312547347445026816 2020-10-04 08:17:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He could have protected everyone or most everyone with a mask and insisting others wear masks too
1312547158319562752 2020-10-04 08:16:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope your next one does too
1312546887719845891 2020-10-04 08:15:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not voting is a vote for trump
1312545892231196681 2020-10-04 08:11:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> covid does not know who is dem or rep..kinda like masks
1312545729769070594 2020-10-04 08:11:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is awesome
1312544132397756419 2020-10-04 08:04:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes you have health, jobs and love..cant ask for more..wishing and hoping you will continue with all of it. Much happiness..maybe consider handing out nice masks at your eventual outdoor wedding?
1312541772162236422 2020-10-04 07:55:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Exactly what has he done? Rolled back Obamas regs and rules? and now water is dirtier, air is dirtier, hurricanes more powerful, drilling goes on and  the list goes on..but the oil and gas industry are happy. Sure is delivering..
1312541341155553280 2020-10-04 07:53:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yay!!! Good for you.  üíôI did too in NJ ..there is no other presidential candidate  is there?
1312540877777244161 2020-10-04 07:51:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not want to appear weak..wonder how he thinks the dog and pony show looks..still not being honest
1312540525308923904 2020-10-04 07:50:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> another republican I presume?
1312540116297175043 2020-10-04 07:48:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PressSec  do you realize your soul has gone to the devil? I have never said that to anyone before..but how does it feel? Is trump worth it?
1312536410486763521 2020-10-04 07:34:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At least in NJ they do not count them until the legal time frame but they do check them in ..mine checked in.
1312536139249508352 2020-10-04 07:32:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wearing masks and coats is what doctors do in a hospital
1312535182189027328 2020-10-04 07:29:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Has barr been tested, does he wear a mask  or he is just wandering around the people
1312531098665054208 2020-10-04 07:12:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we already know this
1312530989957091329 2020-10-04 07:12:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So easy to wear a mask
1312530839519948802 2020-10-04 07:11:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> white supremacists is all you need to condemn ALL OF THEM and sound like you mean it. Maybe if you say it often enough we can believe you and you will believe it
1312530343279300608 2020-10-04 07:09:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @KamalaHarris @BarackObama @michaelb4jordan I voted..straight blue..do not let anything get in the way of your votes folks
1312529818378932225 2020-10-04 07:07:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He cant be locked up he says...I want to see him get better but I do not like this crap he is pulling, it is about votes and yet he does not stop to think yet about masks
1312529410809946112 2020-10-04 07:06:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I knew it..he wants to get back so can continue his run...and sounding so noble .
1312529114767654912 2020-10-04 07:05:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry, not easy to lose mom even if you expect it. Only a little loss? I felt a lot lost when my mom died. Losing mom is not easy. Can only say it does get easier..if you want to cry cry..if you want to chat, here we are üôèüò•
1312526280508624896 2020-10-04 06:53:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> these are same words i saw earlier and they do not sound like his ..but good spin lol
1312525773878648832 2020-10-04 06:51:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL who is he kidding?  Does not even sound like him..it is exactly the same thing as someone else said about trump earlier he expounded on it..this is how he will try to spin it
1312507154134257664 2020-10-04 05:37:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump etc think of themselves..had they reached out to Biden, trump would look it as  a sign of weakness
1312498554032668672 2020-10-04 05:03:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only say if he bought all those boxes with his own money I could forgive him somewhat even for his letter on the boxes
1312498216873553921 2020-10-04 05:02:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just put on masks
1312497611262160896 2020-10-04 04:59:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ouch
1312497460955082753 2020-10-04 04:59:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DonaldJTrumpJr  masks do not know political party..neither does COVID hope you will wear masks and stay negative
1312497110940479488 2020-10-04 04:57:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you mean he did not? I guess that means same for boxes of food with his name on the outside....so disgusting to do that..and people will buy it
1312496872615862272 2020-10-04 04:56:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no bleach either
1312488486180593664 2020-10-04 04:23:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> some got the hint..so those that did not would be the trumplikins..republicans now wear masks
1312488266004742144 2020-10-04 04:22:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Though I see more masks than used too, still , blithering idiots is still what comes to mind. Why does everyone not have a mask on?
1312487943118839808 2020-10-04 04:21:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Excellent
1312487561823096832 2020-10-04 04:19:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think sicker but will see in a few days
1312487356235038720 2020-10-04 04:19:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I VOTED BLUE-hope you will too
1312470390191476737 2020-10-04 03:11:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What matters more is the next couple days..comparably, first couple days of cold not bad either..then it gets worse..covid19 is same
1312470012611842048 2020-10-04 03:10:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So intentionally ignorant?
1312469813478846465 2020-10-04 03:09:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd, I have seen no one wish him death..most wish a speedy recovery but anger is allowed, that does not equal death. Never forget this
1312468822549430273 2020-10-04 03:05:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> motorcycle rally attended by thousands, many hundreds came down with covid within couple weeks and they were not wearing masks
1312468477622403075 2020-10-04 03:04:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Need to wear masks
1312468313197301763 2020-10-04 03:03:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @theTrumpSpring @MarciHunni @WLH84469010 @laceyinnh @fstuart2 @LisaDNews If that happens your mask is on incorrectly
1312468106485276672 2020-10-04 03:02:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where did you see this nonsense?
1312422782895091712 2020-10-04 00:02:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ChrisChristie  Sorry about your covid hope u recover quickly and decide to wear a mask so you wont donate it in the future
1312422177812238336 2020-10-04 00:00:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Supposed to portray strength to "enemies" Doctors did look like it was a trump show though..not big on fact but more phot op
1312421761292607494 2020-10-03 23:58:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @greggutfeld  What a lovely toady you are. trump the saint is trying to solve this issue? This was all he could of to do it? No offense you are a blithering idiot
1312421321075240960 2020-10-03 23:56:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Leader of "free world" It is a just in case..
1312418443119992832 2020-10-03 23:45:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not change my mind about what a lowlife he is..but I can hope he learned something though watching Doctors looks like a political speech for the med. Guess will see..do wish him speedy recovery
1312409344361861120 2020-10-03 23:09:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks more like pence
1312409056443801602 2020-10-03 23:07:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who is speaking truth here?
1312408593392689152 2020-10-03 23:06:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Might not have a choice since to vote, they have to be there. Can't be home with that pesky Covid19
1312407977492647939 2020-10-03 23:03:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is the children teaching the child
1312407862262587395 2020-10-03 23:03:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 12 feet and off to the side so while facing each other, they will not be breathing or spitting on each other
1312395332781834244 2020-10-03 22:13:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are too smart to let us in
1312394964345782274 2020-10-03 22:11:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That would be his advisors which explains the state of trumps efforts to be reelected (like 5 yr olds)
1312393621937819653 2020-10-03 22:06:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that a joke? Or do you work for fox?
1312390601325846529 2020-10-03 21:54:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the trumps are superior beings..no need for rules or laws for them..hm wait donald is in the hospital, maybe they should rethink being above rules or laws and superiority
1312390157644038145 2020-10-03 21:52:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he would be reelected?
1312389663034933248 2020-10-03 21:50:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also, please do not lose sight of the fact..we are better than that
1312389292937928704 2020-10-03 21:49:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are worried ..cannot believe I am reading this..so the 205,000 previous deaths don't count toward lack of reelection just trump getting Covid19?  Do they really believe he is G-d and that his being sick is all that would sway the vote? Trumps aides as brilliant as trump
1312380943605301249 2020-10-03 21:16:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So true.  It is all part of the same nightmare. Maybe it is the only way trump could truly learn and pay attention. I guess we will find out
1312380492189184000 2020-10-03 21:14:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt,but did he get his covid 19 test? I see two smart people there..they must be breathing a sigh of relief.
1312226968759341056 2020-10-03 11:04:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @mattgaetz  says social distancing doesn't work? How would he know? I have never seen any of them try it..or masks
1312226557142814720 2020-10-03 11:02:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not care whether he cares or not, I am human  and have a gene he seems to be missing. he is the worst of humanity..but I wish him a complete full recovery..and if that medicine works think how much good it will do for thousands or millions.I also want him to face charges
1312224298531250178 2020-10-03 10:53:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have to vote trump out and any other republican in office, whether it is the trash administrator, city council, senate, congress..school board..anything that wears the title republican has to be voted out
1312222740116656129 2020-10-03 10:47:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sad part is it is true
1312222667987210240 2020-10-03 10:47:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not care about them either. Just a tool to get where he wants to be. Maybe he might grow up now as he realizes not invincible..but not sure..in any event I wish them all a speedy recovery

1312134374280720384 2020-10-03 04:56:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How bout the 208k and the congress and senate that has yet to be discovered..add them to those you pray for?
1312133693163544576 2020-10-03 04:53:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He did not exactly say it but he said it
1312133554634059777 2020-10-03 04:53:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and won't make masks mandatory? That by itself says he does nothing to earn the title Mr President
1312133332348530688 2020-10-03 04:52:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> from trumps side you want honor?
1312133113061892097 2020-10-03 04:51:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you really want us to believe the situations are the same? DUH

1312109143960870912 2020-10-03 03:16:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Makes me glad again today I voted @JoeBiden
1312108897084166146 2020-10-03 03:15:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @johnjenkins2015   I appreciate your comments and respect you for them.  I hope any tests you take are all negative
1312108138313601025 2020-10-03 03:12:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what makes them ridiculous? That unlike the president, people are looking at all possibilities to be prepared?
1312107860516503558 2020-10-03 03:11:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§£
1312085378954919937 2020-10-03 01:41:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorta like the candidate for Supreme Court..he does not want to wait..well ..why would anyone want to wait for another election date?
1312067568845422594 2020-10-03 00:31:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> happy results for the Bidens!!!
1312067262396985351 2020-10-03 00:29:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope Chris Wallace said that and keeps saying it
1312066600271515648 2020-10-03 00:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do we need to stoop to trumps level? Think not!!
1312066467886661634 2020-10-03 00:26:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden you all stay healthy
1312066292761931779 2020-10-03 00:25:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is truly pathetic
1312066058245865472 2020-10-03 00:24:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> happy news
1312065826565038081 2020-10-03 00:24:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> EXCELLENT so happy for you both ..hope you will get tested frequently
1312053489351241728 2020-10-02 23:35:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has never been considered big on brains or common sense.  Just hope anyone that contracted it has a full complete recovery
1312046038933540866 2020-10-02 23:05:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> since trump is doing "business as usual" perhaps he should get in front of a camera now to show the world he has mild symptoms and mark meadows should wear a mask
1312041290998124544 2020-10-02 22:46:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Until conspiracy theorists get that brainstorm from posts like this?
1312034403120549888 2020-10-02 22:19:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know ronny has a penchant for lying for his boss
1312034263282442242 2020-10-02 22:18:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NO WAY
1312033061241061376 2020-10-02 22:13:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Her too?  Just hope people now understand to WEAR MASKS wash hands and keep distance..wishing all a speedy recovery and a hard lesson learned
1311866133654495237 2020-10-02 11:10:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everything is crumbling
1311865742846029824 2020-10-02 11:09:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now i see the newspaper that is a friend of trumps has a headline from the head of another department who is also a friend of trumps saying hunter got money from burisma..put it all together more fake news
1311864940316315648 2020-10-02 11:05:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering how trump feels about mocking Biden
1311864393127399425 2020-10-02 11:03:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thought crossed my mind but fortunately @JoeBiden wore a mask..do hope they get checked tho
1311861827425492993 2020-10-02 10:53:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She must get her info from her husband..and it is fake
1311861660181819392 2020-10-02 10:52:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When trump accuses anyone of ANYTHING he is the one doing it
1311857346734444549 2020-10-02 10:35:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MeidasTouch she is a gem!!
1311852072980164608 2020-10-02 10:14:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will deny he has it if he does..but it could  change him then he knows what people are talking about and maybe he would stop lying about it and people will pay attention to tht
1311851798794182656 2020-10-02 10:13:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He cant get it ...it is a hoax isnt it?
1311851443863912450 2020-10-02 10:12:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So is trump positive? waiting for results..why is he having to wait so long?
1311847010371133442 2020-10-02 09:54:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @FLOTUS     is trump your news source? Obama did not build the cages.. this is what happened if you fact check..hope you get this and will read to the end  https://t.co/Z0VQPfLbhM
1311845534693552128 2020-10-02 09:48:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Liberals are crazy? lol
1311845044572258305 2020-10-02 09:46:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They want to take away will of the people..think about what his goal is
1311843622342586370 2020-10-02 09:41:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wish him complete recovery and a mask
1311838950902968321 2020-10-02 09:22:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wishing her a complete total recovery and sense enough to wear a mask no matter what dingbat says
1311838733126316033 2020-10-02 09:21:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not care who he screws as long as he achieves his goal..which is not likely now
1311833578226036739 2020-10-02 09:01:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thought has crossed my mind..
1311826149941678082 2020-10-02 08:31:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lets all obey trump and not wear masks
1311825940096352260 2020-10-02 08:30:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will like it..his voters wont and trum wont rescue him because trump is using him
1311822360367030273 2020-10-02 08:16:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you are giving him too much coverage..he is trash and it shows..probably will go  beat up his wife too..scared cowering sniveling children all like donald
1311822034557693952 2020-10-02 08:15:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o gosh how intimidating..do you all beat your wives too?
1311798545851314176 2020-10-02 06:42:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great example on a grand scale. He holds his rallies in or out..he gets tested daily, those near him get tested. All those rallying do not and what happens after they get sick or die..he is fine ,he just does not care..he treats everyone the same way, even you @GovAbbott
1311798543040954368 2020-10-02 06:41:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GovAbbott  when trump is done with you he will do to you what he does to all..he uses you til he uses u up, then he will throw you under the bus. You think you are different, you are not ..wait and see or..you can do what is right for this country, people  Constitution and sleep
1311797138762993664 2020-10-02 06:36:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is so jealous of Biden etc..they take up all the space in their heads that the crickets have not filled
1311796719651303424 2020-10-02 06:34:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lets stop discussing him, his shenanigans and his bigotry and see if he is missed
1311796458182643712 2020-10-02 06:33:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh yeah mock them..just remember we mock you and your sort a lot more
1311794714207817729 2020-10-02 06:26:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think most people know who they will vote for..and I think most know trump is full of it..and I also think we should stop giving them and their white nationalists groups air time..they dont need it they just love the attention they get
1311794092167307265 2020-10-02 06:24:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has always picked on her and always sounds like the idiot he is
1311790221583888388 2020-10-02 06:08:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 so far beyond sad
1311788997614727169 2020-10-02 06:04:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O my stay safe (and dry)
1311788484911398917 2020-10-02 06:02:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump trying to intimidate the Sponsors of the Debates..sure hope they do not allow it
1311776246347554817 2020-10-02 05:13:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not need dissecting ..is no question who started the chaos..who prefers chaos? Who loves lies and chaos?
1311762843084169219 2020-10-02 04:20:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aw donnie is afraid and wants what he wants..not appearing is certainly a choice ..we can handle no more
1311762597834825751 2020-10-02 04:19:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when he is out in the real world..as is he can send his underlings out, his white nationalists, and whoever else ..they are his agents and they have the risk not donald..worst part is they dont understand that but trump does
1311761979380506625 2020-10-02 04:16:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @johnrobertsFox good for you!!
1311761116087889922 2020-10-02 04:13:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I bet when they go home they also abuse their wives and families.
1311760917068210177 2020-10-02 04:12:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He and his insanity is tearing up this country and that has to be good cause to throw him out, it is not just disagreement on policy.
1311759685284958208 2020-10-02 04:07:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is such a coward
1311759601470181388 2020-10-02 04:07:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Reject trump reject white terrorists like the proud boys and reject their violence
1311759141921267715 2020-10-02 04:05:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so glad that @JoeBiden supporters can think without being told what or how to think...that makes them sane. Also means they can tell the difference between right and wrong..and respecting the people,  country and its Constitution.
1311758335042113538 2020-10-02 04:02:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would like to wish Jimmy Carter a Happy  Birthday..but he has probably lived to 96 because he does not use the internet?  Happy Birthday Mr President. You are an inspiration. Keep on keeping on.

1311756515804672001 2020-10-02 03:54:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump campaign has to blame someone since trump does not take any responsibility ..himself..if he or you don't like what people say, try the truth and then  you would get different results
1311756002518335488 2020-10-02 03:52:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When does the crazy stop

1311746606342057987 2020-10-02 03:15:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Most are not  I am sorry you were in that situation..but it does not change my mind, I do not believe the great majority are qualified to vote at 16
1311742357625241601 2020-10-02 02:58:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not matter what it was. He sold out right, wrong, the people, this country and Constitution for it whatever it is..so guess he earned a kick in the butt out the door
1311741697383161857 2020-10-02 02:56:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lindsey too late..you went to sleep with dogs, fleas should not surprise you.
1311741451768823808 2020-10-02 02:55:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even when he condemns any of the white supremacist groups that the FBI says are leading terrorist groups in this country..he does it so hardheartedly you know he is insincere
1311741001606848513 2020-10-02 02:53:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure ..when they are 18 or so I agree. ...they cant join the service
1311740632633929730 2020-10-02 02:51:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So I guess to McEnany she thought it would be okay to say it since she graduated from Rhodes and that makes her a Rhodes scholar
1311739559332458499 2020-10-02 02:47:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL
1311736563764809733 2020-10-02 02:35:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tell me I did not hear that Speaker Pelosi wants 16 year olds to vote????
1311721076351791105 2020-10-02 01:34:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> solitary
1311686637303279620 2020-10-01 23:17:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I left the sound off thought it was about shampoo
1311686175384580096 2020-10-01 23:15:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope he had a hankie for the "construction worker"
1311683243721326593 2020-10-01 23:03:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I see you
1311655512262533122 2020-10-01 21:13:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @politico Would say unbelievable but for trump, totally believable plays right into his propaganda campaign to make the people believe they should be more indebted to the fearless leader
1311654298808442884 2020-10-01 21:08:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought it was a bit of humor
1311653631066886146 2020-10-01 21:06:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can we take that as a promise and a fact?
1311625662197829633 2020-10-01 19:15:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He gets what he asks for and then complains?
1311618983074897922 2020-10-01 18:48:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the republican party is no longer the republican party
1311478460913778688 2020-10-01 09:30:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Congrats
1311478101310951426 2020-10-01 09:28:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> During Ukraine ruckus (DJT had a conversation with Rudy who was in Ukraine in which he said he wanted to look like an investigation on Hunter did not really have to do one just look like it..but they have done so many investigations on Hunter..nothing there .what about djt kids
1311477319169646594 2020-10-01 09:25:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I voted @JoeBiden today , will give a  couple days then call to make sure they signed it in..after getting ballot 2 days after primary when requested 2 months before, leaving nothing to chance. Took pic of mailman picking it up  too
1311476979330412545 2020-10-01 09:24:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are probably right and that makes me cry
1311476860182818817 2020-10-01 09:23:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like no shame in masks there

1311453185081516032 2020-10-01 07:49:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious, if trump has made clear, no room for racism, why is this country so divided?
1311452809288658944 2020-10-01 07:48:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Charliedesigns3 @JoeBiden voted Joe today NJ üíô
1311452536235274240 2020-10-01 07:47:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can you point them out?
1311451760020598784 2020-10-01 07:43:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if they looked at their video..and think about how smart and clever they look
1311451432692875264 2020-10-01 07:42:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Flags don't look like an insult to this country either.
1311451128077443072 2020-10-01 07:41:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice crowd, masked up and ready to go and they do not sound like a riot waiting to happen..so civilized, so smart
1311450339925733385 2020-10-01 07:38:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ..bullying and bribery are not acceptable in the USA
1311450018709155840 2020-10-01 07:37:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is what she said? Bye bye susan collins..there is fault with you too
1311449699405225985 2020-10-01 07:35:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Much a liar as donald
1311449386707226629 2020-10-01 07:34:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would guess that is why he divides the country..and wants to keep it that way
1311449237226487808 2020-10-01 07:33:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice to see some very smart @Lakers wearing those masks
1311416389819920385 2020-10-01 05:23:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear I find abuse of the flag so upsetting whether it is trump making love to it or someone wearing it as a mask....guess I am old
1311414608503214080 2020-10-01 05:16:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that should be illegal..it is already disgusting
1311414085821628417 2020-10-01 05:14:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @mmpadellan @ForNanie Totally agree with you Nanie. Very frightening..so today I voted..BIDEN ..and like you, I hope anyone that sees this is also voting @JoeBiden
1311413491933290498 2020-10-01 05:11:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> boys wearing flags what an insult to the flag..disgusting
1311374377607462912 2020-10-01 02:36:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I VOTED TODAY    SUCH A PRETTY BLUE..shouting from rooftops cause last election they sent the ballot 2 days after election...I was worried..now I am not worried I VOTED TODAYüòá always took voting for granted because I never had a problem before. Never take it for granted again
1311373153755713542 2020-10-01 02:31:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did my share. I voted for Biden today
1311361732116393985 2020-10-01 01:46:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He could not call out white nationalists he is and always has been one of them
1311361242737541120 2020-10-01 01:44:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I VOTED!
1311336922435014669 2020-10-01 00:07:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If we did not know before, we know now..Biden is wiser, calmer, more intelligent,unafraid to speak truth to power and the list goes on but space here does not..so, @JoeBiden  for President 2020
1311311345288085505 2020-09-30 22:26:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pick a dictator, any dictator
1311311210307104768 2020-09-30 22:25:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump resign
1311298764355842048 2020-09-30 21:36:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right just let him ramble..but it was upsetting. Never had a reaction to a "debate" like i had last night.
1311298546398900225 2020-09-30 21:35:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not know about that just know this is now..and this is when it counts
1311298157880451072 2020-09-30 21:33:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Like trump they do not need facts to open their mouths
1311298039504670721 2020-09-30 21:33:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now do not need to go on the street to know it
1311286160476590080 2020-09-30 20:45:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I say turn off the mic.  People will see even worse behavior to point out how unpresidential he is
1311285892552818689 2020-09-30 20:44:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You mean trumps racism (sorry)
1311285664508522503 2020-09-30 20:43:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope people will read this
1311285183543480321 2020-09-30 20:42:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @hogangidley45
1311284664057954306 2020-09-30 20:40:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump was soooooo disgraceful
1311284055439273984 2020-09-30 20:37:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to Hogan Gitley telling the world that Joe Biden spoke at a service for a KKK member..he just forgot to include that the KKK member gave up on KKK many years before he died when he realized how horrible they are
1311278419351609345 2020-09-30 20:15:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Get rid of them all ..no questions..just VOTE BLUE
1311278203340836869 2020-09-30 20:14:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Amy_Siskind Like your thinking!
1311278029491130373 2020-09-30 20:13:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That photo speaks volumes. That picture is trump saying there was no pressure on Ukraine. Look at that picture..it speaks volumes
1311275226592927746 2020-09-30 20:02:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee, received not one tweet from anyone since  around 8 pm last night. Anyone see this?
1311273290242109442 2020-09-30 19:54:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He babbled like the bully he is
1311272990932377602 2020-09-30 19:53:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bullies, bigots and those filled with hate love him. They are him
1311272626787155970 2020-09-30 19:52:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has always been a bully..could not help but wonder if his supporters realize how big a bully he is
1311272383626571777 2020-09-30 19:51:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was how I saw it
1311271886467338240 2020-09-30 19:49:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump should not..but more than that @joeBiden should not attend another "debate". Trump needs someone to provide him with definition of debate then teach him how..
1311150944315412481 2020-09-30 11:48:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no lol
1311149164072402950 2020-09-30 11:41:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> better not to pay attention..something like trump
1311148811461496833 2020-09-30 11:40:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ddale8 @UROCKlive1 @realdonaldtrump
1311148712777965569 2020-09-30 11:39:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1311148480988094464 2020-09-30 11:38:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was impressed by Biden, he had so many opportunities to either call out trump and family or respond about his son he did not stoop to trumps level
1311147983635963906 2020-09-30 11:36:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1311147774692519936 2020-09-30 11:36:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden
1311147648003584000 2020-09-30 11:35:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sick so the white supremacists that are cowards and bullies are like trump,they cant think for themselves
1311147285556932608 2020-09-30 11:34:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who is best on public safety and law and order? Easy answer!!! Joe Biden
1311143252435890178 2020-09-30 11:18:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Absolutely works for me
1311143174157545473 2020-09-30 11:17:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I said..sure wish a cut off switch on trumps phone  so we could all hear @JoeBiden
1311142218221187072 2020-09-30 11:13:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> America has lost for 4 years Joe will turn it around
1311142139137531906 2020-09-30 11:13:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump was disgusting and disgraceful
1311128275096403975 2020-09-30 10:18:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> better late?
1311128149334396935 2020-09-30 10:18:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but trump not doing it was sadly expected
1311128017943617536 2020-09-30 10:17:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is white supremacist?
1311127918362472450 2020-09-30 10:17:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> exactly what he did..guess  he wants them to wait for their dog whistles to spring into action again
1311127663000551426 2020-09-30 10:16:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is scum
1311127358796161026 2020-09-30 10:14:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> watching with your eyes closed?
1311127063747850242 2020-09-30 10:13:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not to be confused with ..go away proud boys
1311126917794484225 2020-09-30 10:13:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will probably call out Russia the same way he just called out white supremacists lol
1311126681386713091 2020-09-30 10:12:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Antifa is not a radical group it is individuals against fascism..and the FBI did say riots etc are set up by white supremacists to look like it is not
1311123295350161408 2020-09-30 09:58:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trum sends rabble rousers in and then sends cops in to clean it up and makes it sound like it is political..it is trump and his politics
1311122288704593925 2020-09-30 09:54:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump is getting his arse mopped he just shouts louder
1311106727211925504 2020-09-30 08:52:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump incites violence because he is a cowering bully ..and violence gives the attention he wants to cover it
1311101939913035778 2020-09-30 08:33:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We can only hope AND be sure....@JoeBiden will do more than a reasonable job. same cant said about @realDonaldTrump
1311101086074376193 2020-09-30 08:30:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> awesome!!!
1311095368994770945 2020-09-30 08:07:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden cannot portray himself as the "con-in-chief.'  that is dons job and it comes naturally
1311094817041125381 2020-09-30 08:05:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden   Kick butt..and stay calm ..hope you do not stoop to his level
1311093831769751553 2020-09-30 08:01:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not have to make sense, he just wants attention
1311092386332848128 2020-09-30 07:55:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 But we know it is lies, @JoeBiden  knows it is lies..and it shows the pigs mentality..so do not sweat the small stuff
1311076160059699200 2020-09-30 06:51:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just want to see Biden keep his composure and trump turn totally red and maybe walk off
1311075754009124865 2020-09-30 06:49:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gosh we wish you well..that you all get what you earn
1311075566804709377 2020-09-30 06:49:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> makes you a very decent person..you want to have equal treatment under the law
1311075270313619458 2020-09-30 06:47:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol lol
1311070198112440324 2020-09-30 06:27:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How stupid no wonder they dont answer
1311069805164793856 2020-09-30 06:26:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course no evidence of it..this is trump distraction
1311050715549310976 2020-09-30 05:10:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yikes Disney laying off 28000. due to pandemic that trump says is slowing down
1311050457586991106 2020-09-30 05:09:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> best passengers should be the Republican people who decided to vote for Biden
1311050262233198592 2020-09-30 05:08:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he was free to show tax papers anytime even if under audit
1311050119941324800 2020-09-30 05:08:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never looked forward to a debate as much as this one
1311037945768542209 2020-09-30 04:19:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When someones biggest interests are how wonderful and rich he is and name calls everyone else, that sort of says it all-fake-sham
1311037531610374145 2020-09-30 04:18:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good thing is, most that see that garbage, know it is garbage
1311037157042204675 2020-09-30 04:16:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How nice for him to try to get votes out of it..not likely will help. Do hope those tests work
1311036863499689984 2020-09-30 04:15:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But good place to stay in touch with family
1311036561434095617 2020-09-30 04:14:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just goes to show, Biden is a lot smarter than any of trumps fans
1311023467375079424 2020-09-30 03:22:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Like is attracted to like
1311023109290496001 2020-09-30 03:20:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it's the little fact checking bug in trumps ear , it is the fake media, it is that the sky is not green..
1311021477236482048 2020-09-30 03:14:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't need to understand just need to show up üòÅ
1311021207333019649 2020-09-30 03:13:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @judevwellness Now everything makes total sense. Thanks kindly üòä
1311018833403170817 2020-09-30 03:03:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> same time military does, families of 250,000 + do same time handicapped do, etc etc
1311018564963504139 2020-09-30 03:02:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @judevwellness does that mean when I know I should see more notifications and I don't  it is shadowbanning? do individuals with  means do it too?
1311008804037971968 2020-09-30 02:23:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @judevwellness I have no idea what shadow banning is?
1311008631324897291 2020-09-30 02:23:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one can accuse the trump bunch of anything except faithfulness to their leader..not truth
1311007857089949702 2020-09-30 02:20:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cowards want to be dictators
1311007783370792960 2020-09-30 02:19:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump loves dictators because trump wants to be a dictator
1311007473566994434 2020-09-30 02:18:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear Yes I care that trump is a tax cheater, but I also care that trump has not done much over his time in office besides attempt to destroy this country and raise hate crime rates and covid19..tax cheating would be bottom
1311007104585539584 2020-09-30 02:17:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear wah accidentally clicked when I was not intending too..consider that a wrong click
1311006475192537088 2020-09-30 02:14:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> permanent exile would be best
1311006346247053314 2020-09-30 02:14:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> both is good..but even a week behind bars would do it..
1311006026104279042 2020-09-30 02:12:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You certainly have a good understanding of trump methods and madness
1311005719244800000 2020-09-30 02:11:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think we need to get rid of all of them at the first opportunity
1311005172194324481 2020-09-30 02:09:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If bear cant afford it bear can talk to bee..but if bear considers it waste of money that is different. It is probably what bee has dreamed of for her entire life. You might just invite the ones that bee wants and whoever your family might be. Set a budget.
1310984660143534081 2020-09-30 00:47:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Congratulations.  Hope everyone is healthy and over the moon What a beautiful, unique name.
1310984037125763073 2020-09-30 00:45:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have no doubt he will be sniffing plenty
1310983834838675456 2020-09-30 00:44:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt that there are comparatively many who enjoy what is going on.  As long as the President does not try to divide the country, I am sure there will be no problem burying that hatchet.
1310983190337802241 2020-09-30 00:42:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think Rudy has his candidates confused
1310978839535849473 2020-09-30 00:24:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgusting and totally not right or fair..fits right in with how trump does business. Use the people up then discard
1310977181162647560 2020-09-30 00:18:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump wants to check ears..guess he needs to be sure no fact checking by @JoeBiden  because he is aware of how many lies trump will tell
1310976628084944896 2020-09-30 00:15:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she wants to spend more government money (as if they have not spent enough) for a criminal investigation..this has markings of obeying donnie  Maybe  while they investigate they can check Bidens ears.? Each time I think white house and occupant cant get more insane..it does
1310976626205876227 2020-09-30 00:15:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So, if I understand this correctly, Kayleigh said there is a leak over fake (not real, not exist) facts and based on this leak over the fake tax leak
1310975399778803714 2020-09-30 00:11:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and if nothing there Biden wins and trump walks off ?
1310975248104411141 2020-09-30 00:10:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such a pathetic example of an insecure scared desperate child who knows he is losing and wants to divert attention
1310974954029166593 2020-09-30 00:09:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What a f---up. Does Biden check his? Or is it more how does it feel to want and not to get?
1310951525901008896 2020-09-29 22:36:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÇ
1310950131496366080 2020-09-29 22:30:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We all know the purpose of so much of this is to discredit Biden in hopes no one will vote for him ..what really happens is each time they try to discredit Biden, they discredit trump and fewer will vote for trump
1310949753493114888 2020-09-29 22:29:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think it is reasonable to ask if this "doctor" is asking as a favor to his very own president? Just discredits the "doctor"

1310947955617169409 2020-09-29 22:22:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That video looked like he was a football and the tackle is what knocked him down
1310947759164395526 2020-09-29 22:21:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> These comments about trump and his belittling of his CHRISTIAN supporters needs more attention
1310947544952901634 2020-09-29 22:20:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh I missed any reference to abuse? was I offline too?
1310946114359758859 2020-09-29 22:14:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did sound like a bit of sarcastic humor. But, why would anyone say with "Jewish girl from his school" Why not a playdate with a girl from his school?
1310945676298276864 2020-09-29 22:13:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why am I hearing Pence introduce and discuss Amy Coney Barrett in terms of politics?
1310764527672229889 2020-09-29 10:13:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not expect anything legitimate. This says it all folks:   https://t.co/dy0aH2vlnC
1310763265207738368 2020-09-29 10:08:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jr grow up. before you end up the same way as your father..u must know you are scamming,  lying and sending people on wild goose chases at taxpayer expense..doesn't it bother you?
1310757695595704323 2020-09-29 09:46:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All pandas
1310757529031450625 2020-09-29 09:45:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you listen to donald it is about gone. Today passed million mark dead around the world. Might remind you, masks and distance save lives..saves more to wash hands. That is the plan for today.  IT WORKS
1310744229463891969 2020-09-29 08:52:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that what happens when no mozzarella? or did lack of sausage do it?
1310743882670501888 2020-09-29 08:51:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BrunTheBear I love this!!!

1310741105516908544 2020-09-29 08:40:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must be a trump fan from out of the country
1310740946573840384 2020-09-29 08:39:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> here go the idiots..is anyone showing the dates on them? there was 1 whining today about 100 or more forgot the amount dated 2 yrs ago
1310727437286862848 2020-09-29 07:45:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a despicable human being (not sure about the human part)
1310727216309956613 2020-09-29 07:44:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pathetic!!!
1310718853987684356 2020-09-29 07:11:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Obama did wear that tans suit...and he was a good role model..so pathetic

1310707075144613888 2020-09-29 06:24:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You should be a very very good conman or think you are until eventually it all comes home to show not so smart as he thinks
1310683398252494850 2020-09-29 04:50:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YAY after getting the last ballot 2 days after the primary..today I got my ballot!!!!! Now need to just track it back to make sure it counts. üòÉ
1310683007871848455 2020-09-29 04:49:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thanks ..maybe nothing is done because the world is upside down enough and everyone in there is a pal of trumps
1310674885488840709 2020-09-29 04:16:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget we are paying for his golf and hotels etc
1310673922254352386 2020-09-29 04:13:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope that they are wrong

1310667989277184002 2020-09-29 03:49:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @amyfiscus Quite a memory
1310667798805467148 2020-09-29 03:48:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not sure if established practice or an actual law that no president can be charged when in office..
1310667318469550085 2020-09-29 03:46:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is another name for bad takes do you mean truth is being spoken?
1310667008875298822 2020-09-29 03:45:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is the plan going to be more lies ..with a dog bone tossed in?
1310666636337307651 2020-09-29 03:44:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that what happened when  the guy threatened to harm himself and wife called for help?..
1310651862484426752 2020-09-29 02:45:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been noticing more and more how he behaves like hitler and his propaganda chief.  Just shocked comparatively not that many notice. Of course much of his base believes the holocaust never happened either and he has so many bigots among his followers..so guess no surprise
1310650320658354179 2020-09-29 02:39:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like candidates or presidents that have a bit of taste
1310641069755957249 2020-09-29 02:02:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we know ..nothing but fake news everyone picks on him
1310640863324839936 2020-09-29 02:01:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump loves to thumb his nose
1310634528575234053 2020-09-29 01:36:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe bigger fish to fry or maybe bigger net to cast
1310634170394304517 2020-09-29 01:35:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He may and he may show his taxes etc
1310587427908653057 2020-09-28 22:29:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump   read and learn
1310587236438736896 2020-09-28 22:28:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump This is nothing but a desperate crock of poop. Ballots will be accurately counted and if anything is going wrong, it is very minor and can be adjusted . Stop trying to delegitimize this election it will not help you
1310577971879702529 2020-09-28 21:51:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Aside from the youngest are there any innocent family members?
1310577741423685632 2020-09-28 21:50:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is there a divorce brewing or jumpsuit (says I do not care?)

1310569961220435970 2020-09-28 21:20:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe he is idealistic, blind, deaf and dumb?
1310569702473846784 2020-09-28 21:19:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> imagine thinking donald would be a good president
1310569548559593477 2020-09-28 21:18:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Amazing the mess the trumps are in and what they have done to this country and people in it..yet jrs reaction is to babble and lie
1310569171516821505 2020-09-28 21:16:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No Biden is not compromised..but nice try jr
1310569076113248256 2020-09-28 21:16:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> jr , daddy and paper are all pals  and if you notice this is opinion and I guess everyone is entitled to one of those..but does not make it true..just means trump wants votes and do what they think is necessary to get those votes
1310560712398381056 2020-09-28 20:43:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> country betraying=traitor?

1310560031620898816 2020-09-28 20:40:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is nothing that can better show how tax laws need reforming..I believe these were business taxes..wonder what personal tax laws were twisted into pretzels
1310550779472891904 2020-09-28 20:03:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not believe it..no one with that much money would brag about it ..so consistently or specifically

1310397995247112200 2020-09-28 09:56:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He must have been really impressed with Stormy..not so much this country though..and yet he is president.
1310363770720530432 2020-09-28 07:40:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> exactly what it looks like and is
1310363316871729154 2020-09-28 07:38:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so much fake news and yet he does not pay for the time he uses either
1310363144674570242 2020-09-28 07:38:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 70000 for that? lol

1310361414633127936 2020-09-28 07:31:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Where does one begin with all the charges after he is defeated in Nov
1310361048755691520 2020-09-28 07:29:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donates salary to Government  Golf costs taxpayer..used to be current, no idea now   https://t.co/Epg6ScXvar
1310360625860747264 2020-09-28 07:28:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 204,738 deaths in the USA   7,107,673 US Covid 19 Cases
1310360003509981184 2020-09-28 07:25:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how many more times he will say fake news?
1310359456149102592 2020-09-28 07:23:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still blaming everyone else  , irs, fake new, his hair dresser, his accountants (gee wonder why they take so long to figure it out), it is always everyone else and poor me poor me..I am so tired of poor me
1310358800109572101 2020-09-28 07:20:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still see nothing of his great health plan
1310358464045121537 2020-09-28 07:19:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and probably more
1310354836173578240 2020-09-28 07:05:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÇ
1310354647933161473 2020-09-28 07:04:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ah just posted a tweet of my own..guess they will just keep throwing stuff out and ignoring all donald did that is provable and factual
1310354421805723648 2020-09-28 07:03:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> BS  now lets deal with facts.. what do you think of your daddy not paying taxes?
1310341343374389248 2020-09-28 06:11:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü•±üòÇ
1310341198264045574 2020-09-28 06:11:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> millions and millions you got it right
1310341098498404357 2020-09-28 06:10:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he does not have to pay for time
1310340992181194754 2020-09-28 06:10:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> next to his tax papers
1310339844191727617 2020-09-28 06:05:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to trump divert attention from himself..all lies..wonder if he  has a problem understanding that Biden has been cleared Hunter has been cleared..and he keeps going
1310305960267841538 2020-09-28 03:50:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YES
1310273746201186305 2020-09-28 01:42:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SShedlin Consider it no big deal. I really do my share of irrational..about now am shocked I am not totally irrational
1310272939510595584 2020-09-28 01:39:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jaketapper  am surprised when someone says Hillary told Joe to never give in..that you did not remind him what was said by Hillary was..do not concede until all votes are counted...
1310272350319935488 2020-09-28 01:37:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He would not want a drug test..would show he uses if honest test.  But fact is he just wants attention , he did it to Hillary too..she did not take it either..just diversion borne of desperation
1310268891311071232 2020-09-28 01:23:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course once filling out ballot never know..maybe all flip Biden or all trump..what a nightmare thought. On the face, nothing as important as what u did though
1310246607825362948 2020-09-27 23:55:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh gosh what a shock lol
1310246519208108033 2020-09-27 23:54:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he would have someone else do it..but no one required him to take a drug test last time, they should have..now it is just one more distraction,one more whine he can do if he is blasted off the stage by truth, facts and Joe... "poor me joe had to be high routine..not honest"whine
1310207808240054273 2020-09-27 21:20:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I don't know, maybe if they go to  a country that has a dictator ?
1310198900830150658 2020-09-27 20:45:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can we help them pack?
1310042935745015808 2020-09-27 10:25:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not blm that is problem it is proud boys and trump who lets them think they are great
1310042685613510656 2020-09-27 10:24:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no way you had to pose her!!!!
1310042599827345408 2020-09-27 10:24:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and sooooooooo cute
1310042366082985990 2020-09-27 10:23:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do we all remember when donald said he would " to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." I know it is an overwhelming honor to be nominated..Barrett..if you love this country &amp; do not want to be a pawn in destroying it..refuse
1310041245629263873 2020-09-27 10:19:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bullies are easy to intimidate..just stand up to them
1310041078809194496 2020-09-27 10:18:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> way to go donald and lackeys
1310040769605099523 2020-09-27 10:17:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would that be a shock? And they have what tapes of what Omarosa might say?
1310040600499060736 2020-09-27 10:16:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Explains everything ..bikers are sober they know the difference.WTG
1310026720435752963 2020-09-27 09:21:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You would applaud it Marco
1310026552084701184 2020-09-27 09:20:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only way it matters is if she decides she is American first and swears to leave some things untouched.
1310026192376926209 2020-09-27 09:19:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very observant,apparently wise.
1310016698200797184 2020-09-27 08:41:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how many trump thinks  of his supporters and family he will kill off..or if he even cares
1310016432579792896 2020-09-27 08:40:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if she will keep politics out of the Supreme Court no matter how much pressure is applied
1310016105923182593 2020-09-27 08:39:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @AmyP5280 @michelleomalle @Stonekettle She has all those kids..I hope she wants to set a better example
1310015869326680066 2020-09-27 08:38:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are disgusting. Maybe you should pretend to be an adult
1310015219872264193 2020-09-27 08:35:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Those that stay instead of obeying the curfew in Louisville are not helping the cause....or showing respect to Breonna or her family
1310011905050902528 2020-09-27 08:22:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gotta luv gangs..whose job is to break the law and call it enforcing law
1310011648359440384 2020-09-27 08:21:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL
1310011038616768512 2020-09-27 08:19:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They have no right to carry that flag
1309996245616922625 2020-09-27 07:20:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/2TwDmu6izT
1309995277420503040 2020-09-27 07:16:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not..did anyone watch? I think he probably staged and leaked enough info so people already knew. Why watch?
1309985751665446913 2020-09-27 06:38:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that seems a bit backwards
1309984675285422080 2020-09-27 06:34:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NO VOTE OR A VOTE FOR A 3RD PARTY CANDIDATE IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP
1309981366386413569 2020-09-27 06:21:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would never do it
1309981176120180737 2020-09-27 06:20:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unless trump says u owe me
1309976446249644032 2020-09-27 06:01:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gees
1309973655888236546 2020-09-27 05:50:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not likely that will win him the election..he has done so much above and beyond wrong and antiamerican
1309973152773087233 2020-09-27 05:48:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cute shirt but might start a fight
1309972888825614336 2020-09-27 05:47:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice lawn sign
1309972719459590144 2020-09-27 05:46:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't we love 2020 ? Such a perfect year
1309962137960435719 2020-09-27 05:04:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> After he is feeling recovered I hope he will go out and do an ad campaign about how masks do help and this is not a hoax  and they need to take this seriously
1309961366195888129 2020-09-27 05:01:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope he makes a complete recovery
1309949558609321984 2020-09-27 04:14:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 @D_jeneration hope so
1309948965434122242 2020-09-27 04:12:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he is happier than the expression on his cute face
1309948757107249152 2020-09-27 04:11:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NJ if my ballot ever arrives
1309948635556306944 2020-09-27 04:11:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is there such a thing as socialist dictator ..I think that would be donald
1309947113640427520 2020-09-27 04:05:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @D_jeneration @D_jeneration ..wise of you to put this out there
1309946937530089473 2020-09-27 04:04:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @D_jeneration @Wharfrat2004  you have probably seen this but just in case..maybe you can think of others who have not but need to see it and hear it
1309946613310394373 2020-09-27 04:03:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @amyklobuchar l   If I could jump up and applaud, I would. Amazing heartfelt speech that will get to anyone that watches it and knows fact from fantasy. Thank you.
1309944072426135554 2020-09-27 03:52:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  all human life is sacred but kids in cages and those with COVID19?  those demonstrating? which all human life? The ones that obey you? White Nationalists but not Black people.  unless they are obedient?
1309943283322417154 2020-09-27 03:49:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I totally believe that was a lot of bullying and pressuring and I am impressed by Olivia Troye who had the guts to walk out
1309943053919105028 2020-09-27 03:48:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they lie a lot about a lot
1309942916446646275 2020-09-27 03:48:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Some always need someone to blame..take no responsibility for their own behavior..something like trump
1309924927533985794 2020-09-27 02:36:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the people to be sued are those that were violent
1309924654677659648 2020-09-27 02:35:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess the hunter should have walked away
1309924544560467968 2020-09-27 02:35:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I feel worse for those that do not know they need hugs
1309924084357230593 2020-09-27 02:33:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can blame anyone but truth is it is donalds world
1309898934681317378 2020-09-27 00:53:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump        has no idea what support the troops means
1309898473664323584 2020-09-27 00:51:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @VP  do you really not see that you and donald have "transform this country into something utterly unrecognizable."??? Take your head out of his backside and look around
1309898264469217280 2020-09-27 00:50:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> such an unpatriotic president and his followers and they do not get it..maybe trump does as he laughs as he watches them go off the cliff
1309897941545615367 2020-09-27 00:49:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can only look at these tweets and the news and all I can think is this country is so freaking upside down
1309896740548620293 2020-09-27 00:44:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has his wall around the white house..can't wait to take it down
1309896376025743360 2020-09-27 00:43:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that says it all..except maybe and this is a president?
1309876792019292160 2020-09-26 23:25:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only hope you are right
1309875846589681664 2020-09-26 23:21:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good luck on that. That would mean a republican keeps their word
1309870835197456385 2020-09-26 23:01:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Drumroll please. Trumps tv judge show is almost ready to be announced..200,000 dead from covid19, more coming
1309868346003816450 2020-09-26 22:52:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @gayleking If Pelosi said that, she is right..but so what? it is the truth. This is not how government works, it is how "families" work
1309867990041665542 2020-09-26 22:50:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he has no mind..so will say anything to stay in office (he thinks)
1309867748261011457 2020-09-26 22:49:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he wont rat out daddy because he likes money and power too
1309867424360083456 2020-09-26 22:48:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> tho I am not in favor of cops killing people..well done deputies
1309867050072932352 2020-09-26 22:46:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Aw..will donald send flowers?
1309860972371247104 2020-09-26 22:22:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ILLEGAL but he just does not care
1309860709824688131 2020-09-26 22:21:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol he is probably right but reasonable viewers do not comprise most of their audience.
1309856289619619846 2020-09-26 22:04:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump says ," the only way trump can lose is if the voting is rigged." What a huge head. That means he thinks everyone loves him.  No poll says that. So he can lose if it is honest voting too. DUH..trying to stir the pot AGAIN. Does anyone realize how insane that sounds?
1309837291955916800 2020-09-26 20:48:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Big much on conspiracy theories?
1309836472862810112 2020-09-26 20:45:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TwitterSupport  For 2 or3 days now I get the same notifications over and over and over again?  Then I get rid of them, log out come back and there they are again. Help Help
1309833319538929664 2020-09-26 20:32:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Destroys if he has so intimidated everyone that they think it is just fine to let him be dictator..and guess his children can succeed him
1309832794084986880 2020-09-26 20:30:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 200,000 +   dead..this is not a nothing. The Ohio gov sounds like the only one with a brain there
1309831624964612098 2020-09-26 20:26:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Who gives him the right to send it? It is just another headline topic change
1309670462348300288 2020-09-26 09:45:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does my heart more than a little good. Nice to know some judges actually do their job without favoritism
1309670074018672640 2020-09-26 09:44:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> very bigly but I think we should discuss Covid19 and 200000+ deaths
1309669848742494210 2020-09-26 09:43:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump 262,000 deaths-guess he has not checked recently
1309669593779179522 2020-09-26 09:42:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump   and you are no president but I like Kamala..think she will be Vice Presidential without being a phony. So glad she is not mike pence
1309669317907296256 2020-09-26 09:41:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump  and you are no president
1309668968446259201 2020-09-26 09:39:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not surrendering it..taking it back in January I can't look at that flag now
1309639466072584192 2020-09-26 07:42:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry to see this..no doubt there are mistakes in every investigation.. if Barr and trump had not inserted themselves in everything that goes on..perhaps I would pay more attention
1309634240959700994 2020-09-26 07:21:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Most of the geniuses have no clue
1309634016732213248 2020-09-26 07:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> another of trumps broken meaningless words..he has no money to do this
1309633031582429186 2020-09-26 07:17:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just one more sad example of the "upper echelon" of the republican party and why they have to go
1309632821024231425 2020-09-26 07:16:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yum to the lobsters!!
1309632463241654273 2020-09-26 07:14:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Many do not want their yards trashed so they do not put out their signs..what does that say about trump people? As for the flag I can only speak for me.&amp;those around here..American flags do not mean what they used too.. I am sure there will be a lot more when your daddy is gone
1309624454755028993 2020-09-26 06:42:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think so..can't retain much changes to fast lol
1309624313461518336 2020-09-26 06:42:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My grandfather too, it was 60 yrs ago but I still remember until he died, he was paralyzed and could only talk out of the corner of his mouth.
1309623824204390400 2020-09-26 06:40:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> should have just pulled i t down and put it in the car
1309623604502556672 2020-09-26 06:39:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we expect personal attacks by trump cause he cant do anything else. it is all he knows
1309623179414044679 2020-09-26 06:37:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too
1309623116075855879 2020-09-26 06:37:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Saying goodbye had to be overwhelming for him
1309622958747463680 2020-09-26 06:36:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I found it touching, not at all tacky.
1309622458857803776 2020-09-26 06:35:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That devotion brought tears to my eyes. I am sorry for your hurt.
1309622005965164548 2020-09-26 06:33:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My goodness, that is love pure and simple
1309621709239185408 2020-09-26 06:32:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jim jordan wants another investigation that the government can pay for? Think there have been about 7 so far by republicans..crawl back under your rock unless you care to investigate the trump boys..haven't heard of any of those
1309612530814185472 2020-09-26 05:55:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needs help but thinks it is everyone else
1309611748505387010 2020-09-26 05:52:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People are so ignorant it is terrifying
1309611346233880583 2020-09-26 05:50:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Soros has nothing to do with rioters..Soros is a dog whistle for those not liking Jews   https://t.co/371aB0Zz2S
1309610736935723008 2020-09-26 05:48:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you really need to ask?
1309610426750111744 2020-09-26 05:47:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o  gosh is Comey running or is jr  feeling the need for attention?
1309610244922683393 2020-09-26 05:46:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not just you..and the answer is YES
1309610163305840641 2020-09-26 05:46:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÇ
1309609332196225025 2020-09-26 05:42:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Little one is a good judge of character.
1309608807321022466 2020-09-26 05:40:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just trumps type
1309600774691999746 2020-09-26 05:08:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is good he is doing well but he is 85. I do wish him the best
1309600305961742336 2020-09-26 05:06:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe it is the only way can handle working for daddy
1309599764116373504 2020-09-26 05:04:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Rand says he seems fine..in hospital
1309599370392858626 2020-09-26 05:03:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so dumbfounded at how ignorant desantis is. Anything for a pat on the head from his president. Wonder what the deal is.
1309599065504612353 2020-09-26 05:02:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GovRonDeSantis    Do you get the same protections trump gets? You must, but what about other people without those protections. Do you pay hospital bills?
1309598685886590981 2020-09-26 05:00:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad he is found..though no idea why ..haven't heard he has done much of anything
1309598514746404867 2020-09-26 04:59:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will this include white nationalists? I hope so!!
1309597975040192513 2020-09-26 04:57:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ..TELL PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS WONT EVEN COST YOU ANYTHING
1309597695376527360 2020-09-26 04:56:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What are you doing here for this country and Covid 19 ..TELL PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS WONT EVEN COST YOU ANYTHING
1309536804018757633 2020-09-26 00:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity she did not donate based on Bidens qualifications and trumps lack of same
1309535993402470400 2020-09-26 00:51:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 14-25 percent (depends which study you read) ..it is strange until you consider it is probably due to drinking and driving
1309534041075601408 2020-09-26 00:43:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Governors are late with the investigation request..
1309533749365936129 2020-09-26 00:42:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wrong party? Or maybe for whatever his logic, feels do more harm than good
1309533146631806982 2020-09-26 00:40:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would have liked to read it..but paywall says I used up my free copies
1309532460015923200 2020-09-26 00:37:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are getting more and more insane and desperate
1309518621358649345 2020-09-25 23:42:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If those judges understand the gravity of the Supreme Court, not likely they will be bullied
1309518360284196864 2020-09-25 23:41:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably result of trump receiving his reward from the onlookers üòá
1309518131640049664 2020-09-25 23:40:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great idea but do you really believe DeJoy would squeal? lol
1309460749664825344 2020-09-25 19:52:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does not say much for trump followers mentality..if they fact checked they would know how much they have been suckered by trump and that would probably lead them to learn how little trump cares about them..meantime covid19 about 203,000 now
1309460154111455232 2020-09-25 19:50:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly I do not believe or trust what comes out of barrs DOJ
1309459026028171265 2020-09-25 19:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They apparently think that they can't..what a pathetic shame..what has happened to those people?
1309458326665732098 2020-09-25 19:42:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why are you telling your fans to send in their ballots now..if you think it is so fake?
1309455502821208064 2020-09-25 19:31:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But, if you add "until all votes counted"..not as interesting to trumps base as do not concede.Gad even his lackey congress people believe do not concede. None of them smart enough to hear or see on own. Follow trump off cliff instead
1309454679085117443 2020-09-25 19:28:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gosh was feeling so left out..wondering if trumps daughter and son in law would agree?
1309438727761035265 2020-09-25 18:24:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @____June___ Is that a dummy the cop ran over?
1309305500857704453 2020-09-25 09:35:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should tell him there is a difference
1309305415461728257 2020-09-25 09:35:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if he wishes he can make it so?
1309305184649129991 2020-09-25 09:34:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No destruction leave it for white nationalists.
1309293210087444480 2020-09-25 08:46:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then do not stop now :)üíô
1309292987017498626 2020-09-25 08:45:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would totally agree but trump would ride into the rescue I would think
1309290619421032448 2020-09-25 08:36:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> many as you wish
1309290438608777217 2020-09-25 08:35:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Promises promises
1309286558579785729 2020-09-25 08:20:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess Hilary was right.
1309286403323441152 2020-09-25 08:19:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I feel sorry for him
1309286160435425287 2020-09-25 08:18:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he gets 1 vote it is like giving trump 1..have seen other names tho.I feel sorry for Kanye trump is taking advantage of him too
1309285863768064000 2020-09-25 08:17:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The guy is a drunk ..he does not need people cheering him on..maybe someone to help him and see if he wants a ride to a hospital
1309285495592177664 2020-09-25 08:16:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So what does the judge do now?
1309284921593270274 2020-09-25 08:13:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No 3rd party candidates-that is like voting for trump
1309284594932486146 2020-09-25 08:12:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not recall a day going by where he did not let the majority down
1309284274441539584 2020-09-25 08:11:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he know ???
1309273909955616768 2020-09-25 07:29:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if he ever tells the truth about anything?
1309273196353458177 2020-09-25 07:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh great the american taxpayer pays again..what does he think cash cards for 200 will do? Buy a vote..it wont
1309264759213248513 2020-09-25 06:53:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know he is still lying
1309264442081914885 2020-09-25 06:52:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he is talking about his plan (still) and still we do not see it
1309264036681449479 2020-09-25 06:50:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We should see it first..but it would not get my vote
1309263740391612416 2020-09-25 06:49:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have felt sorry for him..then he does something else and while I feel sorry for him, also want to see him receive justice..not wrong with you ..you still have some humanity..he does not
1309253847093829638 2020-09-25 06:10:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What idiots..who are the bigger idiots the ones who promote this or the ones who believe it
1309253133844054016 2020-09-25 06:07:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like all his businesses he ran it into the ground then knew he would bail on it..he might have done something if he tried it honestly but honestly is not his way
1309252472662355968 2020-09-25 06:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @amyklobuchar great job today
1309241253016539138 2020-09-25 05:20:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More like stunned
1309240827135361025 2020-09-25 05:18:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he took and abused her money   https://t.co/NNXDJlOOsd
1309240428756176896 2020-09-25 05:16:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not fiction if you watch him and read..sounds very true
1309240100635783174 2020-09-25 05:15:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probably more now that she has given up on him.
1309239730572328967 2020-09-25 05:14:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Allow me to ask what your daddy has done to make him worth 4 more years? Covid 19? Babies in cages? Seriously what has he done..told people to vote twice? the list goes on so from your perspective what has he done?  Called military losers? Belittle everyone? Ran out of room  here
1309238992643264512 2020-09-25 05:11:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds like a delightful day
1309238793564811264 2020-09-25 05:10:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only say covid 19
1309238592892538881 2020-09-25 05:09:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only his violence and lawlessness?
1309238356413485057 2020-09-25 05:08:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope that was a dummy not a human ..no excuse for it if person
1309223788500914178 2020-09-25 04:10:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Let us discuss covid 19 and what trump knew and did not discuss for MONTHS and now over 250000 dead
1309222467563642885 2020-09-25 04:05:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @amyklobuchar      way to go
1309221255338487808 2020-09-25 04:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those at home heard it ..and trump heard it judging by the expression on his eyes..after he was sure of what he heard is when he left i think
1309218095622492160 2020-09-25 03:48:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Another distraction which is very legal and very helpful but they like to throw it out for dog meat..like covid 19
1309213289910546432 2020-09-25 03:29:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure that is how it should be in a real government not a banana republic
1309213086516117505 2020-09-25 03:28:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 200000 + Covid deaths. Thank you donald
1309212874871635969 2020-09-25 03:27:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would have liked to see him maskless..probably stunned silly since he is always so sheltered from reality
1309212288411410434 2020-09-25 03:25:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> covid 19 numbers keep going up
1309205929590697987 2020-09-25 02:59:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and covid 19 and maybe 1200?
1309203583045439488 2020-09-25 02:50:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh yes word barr brought back into our language..guess he knew about jrs plans
1309203322927230980 2020-09-25 02:49:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> covid 19
1309203274155855872 2020-09-25 02:49:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> covid 19
1309203103825235969 2020-09-25 02:48:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only do it if we let him...covid 19
1309202841383374858 2020-09-25 02:47:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He cares about not going to jail..Covid 19
1309199475118874624 2020-09-25 02:34:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> COVID 19
1309199342796972036 2020-09-25 02:33:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> COVID19
1309199157383573504 2020-09-25 02:32:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Only if we let him..I am in favor of discussing COVID 19
1309188770110074885 2020-09-25 01:51:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think just have too keep after Justice Ginsburg word
1309186096740347904 2020-09-25 01:41:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the part with trump was horrifying
1309185302515404801 2020-09-25 01:37:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he will be impartial and that scares donald
1309185214212603904 2020-09-25 01:37:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nothing will be fair unless donald wins..ask him
1309184421564764164 2020-09-25 01:34:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG

1309179686921043968 2020-09-25 01:15:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If what trump says is true..he would not try it as fake news..he would show everyone where and how. Probably means a trump kid got money that was wired.
1309177898587258883 2020-09-25 01:08:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YES
1309177142132060165 2020-09-25 01:05:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He means president is crazy
1309176987550916610 2020-09-25 01:04:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> has to go thru the court that they are doing best to stack?
1309176741940924416 2020-09-25 01:03:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like it even if pandemic still here..can use the money
1309169387631411204 2020-09-25 00:34:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is their distraction from COVID-19 talk about that
1309168857773486081 2020-09-25 00:32:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You still have it Bruce!!

1309166080712232961 2020-09-25 00:21:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bet for obvious reasons trump is glad he has a mask on now ü•±üòä
1309165265163374595 2020-09-25 00:18:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish as humiliating as he has earned
1309153682550861825 2020-09-24 23:32:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> whine whine that must mean he wont ask questions trump wants..or wont let trump take over
1309148151262085122 2020-09-24 23:10:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad he can study something..perhaps it should be Corona Virus19 and after studying he can strongly suggest face masks, distance and handwashing then keep suggesting as he says rallies will be virtual ..unless masks worn by all with spacing. better use of time for him
1309147392361615360 2020-09-24 23:07:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You forgot to recognize them when not trying to help out your boss.
1309146534617985024 2020-09-24 23:03:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they hide him away among the group who will kowtow to him. he is not exposed to real people..today he got a dose of real people
1309144991512571907 2020-09-24 22:57:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do not know how nominations work but must have been trump or same person nominated trump
1309144788080439297 2020-09-24 22:56:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump wants attention..if he sees he can get away with what he says he goes a step further..i say no attention is good attention
1309144444424392704 2020-09-24 22:55:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great day all around!üòñ
1309144080258134021 2020-09-24 22:54:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe he should respect her wishes to get some respect
1309143583161815040 2020-09-24 22:52:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice that he sees this country is made up of more than his adoring fans. Could not shelter him there
1309143302327988233 2020-09-24 22:51:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could see him thinking "how can they treat me this way, what did i do"
1309142976468316160 2020-09-24 22:49:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gees everyone is in line peacefully and respectfully in front of the Supreme Court..except for the guy yelling "Jesus Christ saves"
1309133410888228872 2020-09-24 22:11:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> unless trump pulls another rabbit out of hat..
1309133296127877125 2020-09-24 22:11:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not usually give McConnell credit for anything, but it is all in the wording..he did not say winner would be decided on the 3rd.
1309132719289520129 2020-09-24 22:08:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RexHuppke Wonderful moment in time.
1309132473784307712 2020-09-24 22:07:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> "vote him out" was the other chant.  All did my heart good.
1309131282899705870 2020-09-24 22:03:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People who were outside at the Supreme Court honoring Justice Ginsberg had the right idea..trump went to pay "respects" Audience saw him..first what sounded like a collective groan then chants of "Vote him out"  He went inside.
1309115849119281152 2020-09-24 21:01:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does what trump does..tries to make headlines..and ignore covid19.  I prefer to ignore him..remember he does not want to cause panic (he said) but if he does it makes him happiest
1309113352388587520 2020-09-24 20:52:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But mother russia and hitler both say confuse the people easier to take over..so my thought is stunning as it is , remember he likes confusion and chaos..so hard as it is, ignore it
1308944093431635970 2020-09-24 09:39:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I lost track of how many republican investigations we have  paid for about Biden..and yet each time..nothing but expensive noise
1308943549526929409 2020-09-24 09:37:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think though I do not always agree with him, he is fundamentally decent so will not vote to give the country away
1308943258232422405 2020-09-24 09:36:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps you need to be careful with your votes
1308942270402646017 2020-09-24 09:32:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at her teacher..same with her brothers
1308941993939263490 2020-09-24 09:31:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not know if AG can butt in to NYS
1308933140153610240 2020-09-24 08:55:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all trumps friends went to jail or will ..John McCain would not fit in
1308932658727182340 2020-09-24 08:53:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There was a time the president of the USA was not a spoiled child showman  who would not embarrass himself or his country. Oh wait that is every president but this one.
1308931974086656000 2020-09-24 08:51:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> problem is trump wants that being the topic..I prefer COVID 19 and the death toll being the topic
1308931578408689668 2020-09-24 08:49:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not like felons being able to vote..however, I was not aware there is a law against being generous?
1308931231892070401 2020-09-24 08:48:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are not men they are frightened children like trump...they are bigots who want a white world where they can rule..but I cannot believe those numbers
1308930662875967489 2020-09-24 08:46:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has been for months..VOTE
1308919317891821571 2020-09-24 08:00:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like father like sons
1308918444079931395 2020-09-24 07:57:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if he sees we are paying attention and nervous..he wins ..if media pays attention he wins
1308918286126665728 2020-09-24 07:56:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We all MUST vote
1308911916677509121 2020-09-24 07:31:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but he will say anything that he thinks will work..like if people get intimidated and throw up their hands..JUST VOTE
1308911694547165184 2020-09-24 07:30:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> atlas you are giving trumps science, that is not fact based and i am afraid you not going to have attention paid to you
1308911388669210625 2020-09-24 07:29:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DearAuntCrabby no
1308911169806229504 2020-09-24 07:28:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will you let him intimidate you as he tried to do to hillary?
1308910515389947905 2020-09-24 07:25:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no matter what he says and what is true or false, trump thinks he is a showman..to me he is just a fraud but he loves drama
1308910260824965127 2020-09-24 07:24:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nope cant see :)

1308909807169146880 2020-09-24 07:23:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shut up trump
1308909527648083974 2020-09-24 07:22:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What they might consider is just be a man and go peacefully then he can use his money (watch how fast his family deserts when money gone) to sue everyone to hold everything up
1308907866900910081 2020-09-24 07:15:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shut up donald..we know you and russia just want to confuse us and undercut those who care about this country.
1308907486842413057 2020-09-24 07:13:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kylegriffin1 He and Russia just want to confuse us
1308906516653789184 2020-09-24 07:10:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will say anything to throw off news cycle. But I choose to ignore him &amp; his bs..we know he wants to hold on to power &amp; avoid jail..but i wont give him my time..will just wait &amp;see &amp; have faith in the repubs, ndependents &amp; dems who care about this country not trumps histrionics
1308899034787205120 2020-09-24 06:40:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is trump friends with J &amp; J
1308898865920258049 2020-09-24 06:39:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope @govkristinoem is eating those birds not just having fun
1308893076107284480 2020-09-24 06:16:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will keep that half in front of her

1308884426600873984 2020-09-24 05:42:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I must I must..wait she half Chihuahua does that help?
1308869838060871681 2020-09-24 04:44:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If Joe Biden used a teleprompter or did not..what is the dif. We know trump does and if he goes off it he goes haywire and the next day if people are so inclined he is a running joke.
1308849004495732736 2020-09-24 03:21:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THIS CANNOT HAPPEN
1308848559433940997 2020-09-24 03:19:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly the law does not count emotion just facts
1308848284606160896 2020-09-24 03:18:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mccarthy is such a coward ..and I am so fed up  with the lemmings
1308848129920434176 2020-09-24 03:18:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondered when Dr Faucis patience would wear out..he did it so well
1308847921719377925 2020-09-24 03:17:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like a bunch of joy not a little joy
1308847569737580544 2020-09-24 03:15:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòñ I have a chihuahua

1308846838896877570 2020-09-24 03:12:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why wont donald present his tax papers?
1308835805922766853 2020-09-24 02:29:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> May be the 5th worthless investigation by them at cost to the taxpayers ..they should investigate themselves
1308835345371410433 2020-09-24 02:27:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why does this sound so socialist?
1308830941473837057 2020-09-24 02:09:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still trying to make sense of this
1308810838099320832 2020-09-24 00:49:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No, because trump will be leaving
1308810063025451009 2020-09-24 00:46:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure rush to dictatorship
1308805624105500677 2020-09-24 00:29:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad UN Sec-Gen has a brain and thinks

1308782758827888640 2020-09-23 22:58:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course she lied, so did trump..what else can we expect?
1308781001821298688 2020-09-23 22:51:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope they do not show..veterans have all heard what he has said
1308780771629555713 2020-09-23 22:50:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This investigation  is being overdone at trumps request and each and every time they waste taxpayer money the result is the same. Nothing to do with his dad
1308780339104485376 2020-09-23 22:48:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why don't you read your history books , see what you are participating in?
1308779005173215232 2020-09-23 22:43:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Each time ..and there have been several investigations, people have tried this investigation, nothing to do with his dad..
1308742799702069248 2020-09-23 20:19:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she gets paid to lie
1308589257112649728 2020-09-23 10:09:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why are people sounding like Covid19 is over. IT IS NOT and employees need to be protected
1308588881453907968 2020-09-23 10:07:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is so disgraceful..the Goya brand needs warning to say " I support trump who is unfit"
1308588176735428609 2020-09-23 10:05:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> russians are not radical left..they are trumplikins

1308585597804699650 2020-09-23 09:54:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Give us a list..without EO, of what you have done?
1308572504575946753 2020-09-23 09:02:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trumps disparaging military members was made pretty widespread and public.

1308543408038961154 2020-09-23 07:07:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> how many days since trump said he would release taxes
1308543261179600901 2020-09-23 07:06:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is what he has said or inferred

1308542253334499329 2020-09-23 07:02:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> China did not let this happen..Donald let it happen by doing nothing for 3 months. tired of hearing him whine it is china's fault..when in reality 200,000 that trump let happen
1308528902248243209 2020-09-23 06:09:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how many will be standing in 2 weeks..and how many if any will die in 12

1308512595629010946 2020-09-23 05:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he has not voted yet..
1308502080504594433 2020-09-23 04:23:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when we lose over 200000 people in this country blame the republicans
1308501849746665474 2020-09-23 04:22:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden Harris 2020 good news travels fast
1308501606904868864 2020-09-23 04:21:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> real donald lies about everything at rallies
1308501392835969024 2020-09-23 04:20:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she forgot to speak  about children yanked out of their parents arms and still lost at the border
1308501120764051456 2020-09-23 04:19:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> russia speak
1308482625632440323 2020-09-23 03:05:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So easy not to panic when Dr Fauci tells the truth. Apparently he was right trump wrong..yet again and maybe if trump had followed Dr Fauci the numbers wound not be so astounding
1308481508303409158 2020-09-23 03:01:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and do not want to admit to it..but just see the rush now..says it all
1308479941051322369 2020-09-23 02:55:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> exactly true
1308479837452013573 2020-09-23 02:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> these people probably think trump will repay in kind..what they do not realize is they will go under the bus when he is done
1308479547780853762 2020-09-23 02:53:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @OliviaTroye easy to just ignore them @Oliviatroye
1308479256943566851 2020-09-23 02:52:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and getting worse
1308467261607489538 2020-09-23 02:04:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does she know this virus is not done with us yet?
1308464656529399808 2020-09-23 01:54:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not that he is not trying
1308443348802379776 2020-09-23 00:29:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and who keep them employed
1308442539297566721 2020-09-23 00:26:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the justices have to have some respect for right and wrong
1308432328088223744 2020-09-22 23:45:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe some of both..or maybe you are just proud of yourself and want to announce it
1308429609738829825 2020-09-22 23:35:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yeah he can thin the herd without laying a hand on them
1308408794184114177 2020-09-22 22:12:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was interesting conversation..thank you for it
1308408532488912896 2020-09-22 22:11:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He knows he will win debates and be the next president. It is why he is so desperate about the judge
1308407795109298176 2020-09-22 22:08:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to trump talking to UN says always in favor of human rights..guess he means other countries not here
1308407428128661504 2020-09-22 22:06:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering what trump is doing ..
1308234051690663936 2020-09-22 10:37:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I  also noticed that and can't help but wonder..there has to be something in the law books or some arcane constitutional info  that can stop this before it is too late to stop it. It is like a huge snowball going downhill
1308233344379949056 2020-09-22 10:35:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> dont give him any ideas
1308233078243028995 2020-09-22 10:34:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the changes at the cdc are also noticeable and all of it is so antiamerican. Btw if trump wants to announce his vaccine he and his family should be the first to take it..but of course how would we know it is real?
1308232221669634048 2020-09-22 10:30:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very attention getting, interesting and sensible.
1308230972614356992 2020-09-22 10:25:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like lindseys excuses but what he needs to think of is the difference in circumstance here..this is all so alice in wonderland
1308229732924874758 2020-09-22 10:20:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everyone has their opinion..I just happen to agree with yours..except trumplikins ..there are still some decent republicans..but wont vote for any of them
1308219645699252224 2020-09-22 09:40:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even if it were it "elderly people" still have lives and most would not volunteer to be killed off
1308219399145488384 2020-09-22 09:39:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> charge
1308218669328105474 2020-09-22 09:36:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dr Atlas is not a radiologist?  I would like to see Dr Fauci in change too
1308216784647004162 2020-09-22 09:29:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DISGRACEFUL
1308216666363441157 2020-09-22 09:28:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is he allowed to retire not be thrown out? William Crews, a public affairs specialist at the NIH‚Äôs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,  DISGUSTING  https://t.co/XM1WL6Kz5Z
1308215771785560065 2020-09-22 09:25:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe republicans should step back into reality then deal with facts
1308215413323567104 2020-09-22 09:23:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why is he allowed to "retire" he should be thrown out on his ear. Does he have a name?
1308213366889025536 2020-09-22 09:15:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then what?
1308184590075531265 2020-09-22 07:21:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sad!
1308184436626857985 2020-09-22 07:20:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would they be children who disappeared at the border and now you will look for them?
1308184236843728903 2020-09-22 07:20:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they can remove it as many times as they choose..it still makes sense and people will still discuss it and i hope find it smarter to put on masks
1308183814032830466 2020-09-22 07:18:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is he talking about himself?
1308183309910933509 2020-09-22 07:16:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt whatever @JoeBiden  said pales by comparison and intent. Contrary to trumps comment, this is about respect, it was what she wanted and if he disregards it he disregards her and respect for her..voters will notice
1308181392824700928 2020-09-22 07:08:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> uh?
1308174987723968513 2020-09-22 06:43:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if he clears them I hope he and barr and all the rest have  nightmares for the rest of is life. Why did the family get cash if they were not guilty. Stick to law Daniel Jay Cameron..ignore influence
1308174985350049792 2020-09-22 06:43:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who needs facts Daniel Jay Cameron (born November 22, 1985) is an American politician and attorney serving as the 51st Attorney General of Kentucky. Cameron is the first Republican elected to the office since 1944 and the first African-American attorney general of Kentucky. them
1308173767617675264 2020-09-22 06:38:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> could be he was told what to say by putin?
1308173574717538305 2020-09-22 06:37:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> face it, they know trump is going to lose
1308173390310780928 2020-09-22 06:36:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wow great logic-what a thinker
1308172693322248193 2020-09-22 06:34:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No shock he would say that..since it is what he shows
1308166705001177093 2020-09-22 06:10:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because of the apparent coziness between those 2, I try to stay away from facebook
1308165890924519424 2020-09-22 06:07:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The only thing I am sure of about this rally is trump does not care who gets sick or dies..as long as it is not him
1308165673072365572 2020-09-22 06:06:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Insanity..hope they remember the great time today as they and their families and friends pay the price within a week or two
1308165436714946563 2020-09-22 06:05:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your statement does not say what looks perfectly clear. He does not care who lives or dies as long as he achieves his goals
1308165108137369601 2020-09-22 06:04:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he knows what he is doing..and he does not care how he gets to where he wants to be..good thing is he will lose
1308164836992446470 2020-09-22 06:02:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump knows he will lose
1308164659514675201 2020-09-22 06:02:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> used to think it was ignorance, now I think of them as lambs to the slaughter
1308164448406908931 2020-09-22 06:01:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess the Lt Gov has more sense than the lambs being led to the slaughter
1308154764048334848 2020-09-22 05:22:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ask if trump and barr are working together? I wonder if any white nationalists were at work in any of those cities
1308154501824733186 2020-09-22 05:21:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> disgusting
1308152447412641792 2020-09-22 05:13:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We have all suspected that for a very long time
1308152127206891520 2020-09-22 05:12:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needs direction from Russia what to say
1308151803654148096 2020-09-22 05:11:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they do not realize they will be implementing socialism in the form of a dictator
1308151628940414981 2020-09-22 05:10:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity Biden did nut use trumps word and say he chocked..or choked
1308151058720526339 2020-09-22 05:08:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Vote Blue..I know what you mean but as long as we vote BLUE we are not useless
1308150735939534849 2020-09-22 05:06:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because trump does not care about the USA
1308150389544497155 2020-09-22 05:05:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you Lou
1308140058524950530 2020-09-22 04:24:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/DfOHwhudeo
1308139859073265666 2020-09-22 04:23:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds about right.  I watched a show last night I had seen bits and pieces about over time. Do not know if this will interest you, I saw it last night very eery..could be today but it was fascists and hitler   https://t.co/DfOHwhudeo
1308129003379789824 2020-09-22 03:40:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only say WOW. they wont get it though
1308126394174656512 2020-09-22 03:30:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not care what republicans say or use as excuses..@senatemajldr is ignoring the fact that Justice Ginsberg asked for a last wish-to wait until after the election. Anything else McConnell discusses or uses as an excuse is nothing more than that
1308115452061782023 2020-09-22 02:46:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If the republican record on almost anything has been so good..why are republicans fleeing to independent or democrats in droves?
1308107290080313346 2020-09-22 02:14:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He knows he lied as he said it.
1308107100858527745 2020-09-22 02:13:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Plain old insanity from people who feel a need to belong
1308106120872054794 2020-09-22 02:09:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is insanity as is he
1308105314068201472 2020-09-22 02:06:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They are full of hypocrites and thick heads
1308105208019521546 2020-09-22 02:05:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you have any idea what you are requesting? Somehow I doubt it. You lie for him , you lie about him..not likely you have a clue what he is doing and what you allow..and that is pathetic ..it will all crash down with a bang, you will say gee i did not understand
1308103162956570624 2020-09-22 01:57:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and trump is not a believer in Jesus Christ..if he were he would behave differently
1308102942369685505 2020-09-22 01:56:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he hates himself..very insecure..i don't waste time on hate..only hurts the hater not the hatee üòá
1308090811175895040 2020-09-22 01:08:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> where is his respect for RBG?
1308089598128590848 2020-09-22 01:03:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He can only steer the focus if the media allows it
1308086777727639555 2020-09-22 00:52:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the guy who no longer could find a bank in NYC  and received no cooperation from NYC because of all that he did
1308063043058794497 2020-09-21 23:18:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is done intentionally
1308062863467204610 2020-09-21 23:17:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is more than punishment..it is a person who wants fascist control and power. he does not want to go to jail and is desperate..nothing worse than desperate and mentally ill
1308062135696711680 2020-09-21 23:14:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> magas cheer because they do not think on their own they follow direction..and that is scary
1308062004830232578 2020-09-21 23:14:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Those that favor this dictatorship have no idea what a dictatorship is..add fascist..the gov owns everything and you have no thoughts of your own..all for the good of the country and its ruler
1308050505122361345 2020-09-21 22:28:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> a desperate there is no bottom contender ..who will do whatever he thinks it will take to retain his title
1307874342584430594 2020-09-21 10:48:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTERS -Jaime Harrison needs you, Joe Biden needs you, RBG memories needs you, .the USA needs you,  please go out and vote straight BLUE line top to bottom
1307873579011366913 2020-09-21 10:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump  and his lackeys have to go!!
1307873230787575808 2020-09-21 10:44:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Absolutely must.
1307873089548619777 2020-09-21 10:43:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Primary process has not started..the ELECTION has started..what do you say now @LindseyGrahamSC
1307872620440956928 2020-09-21 10:41:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We are not supposed to remember..just like we are not supposed to remember all the other "incidents" That is why he keeps changing the headlines..he does not want people to remember
1307871076454723584 2020-09-21 10:35:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You did not tell the full truth and now you have disappeared..see how loyal he is to you?
1307865171885514753 2020-09-21 10:12:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who is the company that owns the other 1/3 of tiktok?
1307864915395383297 2020-09-21 10:11:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I refuse to hate anyone, even trump
1307864738932629507 2020-09-21 10:10:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump knows he is going to lose so he is hurrying
1307855548545630209 2020-09-21 09:33:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SShedlin Take care Steve.This has or should give everyone a whole new perspective and I suppose for that we should be thankful
1307855188561211392 2020-09-21 09:32:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She deserves to have her last wish respected
1307854937855012864 2020-09-21 09:31:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you sit on your brain? You cannot believe this nonsense. My patience is gone for idiots who cannot think, use logic or research on their own
1307854026046922754 2020-09-21 09:27:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such an adorable alpaca on the Emmys tonight
1307853348075429888 2020-09-21 09:25:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then why would McMaster go on tv and say it so trump can drive himself nuttier trying to figure out who?
1307852983443619840 2020-09-21 09:23:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sick..what is the matter with these people? Were they born brainless or it just happens because they are so insecure and  they do whatever trump says. You are risking lives you blithering idiots
1307852545541406720 2020-09-21 09:22:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not watch awards shows either..but this is an exception..Kimmel and creativity
1307852301957320706 2020-09-21 09:21:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump cant help himself
1307843317338644482 2020-09-21 08:45:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is a thought for everyone, probably everyday, even when the kids live hour away. Guess it is a reminder to appreciate our loved ones every minute of every day.  Hope you and daughter stay safe and healthy
1307841284690804736 2020-09-21 08:37:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YOW
1307841219184205824 2020-09-21 08:36:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Remember your words..anything you get you invited
1307826294088962049 2020-09-21 07:37:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Personally I can't stand the guy but I  think that was disgusting and never should have been attempted. (no sarcasm)  That is as bad as white nationalists attacking any minority
1307825771424210944 2020-09-21 07:35:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to AOC, yes we are a melting pot, yes everyone should keep their backgrounds alive and well. Because this is a melting pot, there is a common language so we can all understand each other. English is that language.
1307814162328965121 2020-09-21 06:49:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and he will spout "law and order"
1307798672843956225 2020-09-21 05:47:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't be repeated enough. trump is only trying to save his own butt so he will say anything or do anything to save his butt. Smart not to believe a word he says unless yu enjoy being gas-lighted or willing to fact check every word
1307797309476999174 2020-09-21 05:42:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> L‚ÄôShana Tovah!
1307796929640890368 2020-09-21 05:41:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is not a Republican, it  is an excuse for a trumplkin without a spine  @SenAlexander
1307796477658439681 2020-09-21 05:39:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @annacabey1 @D_jeneration So so sorry
1307796367893463046 2020-09-21 05:38:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like dazed and confused when looking for his plane even though he mocked his dad for having it.   It is a disease I would not wish on my worst enemy.  My dad had it . I suspected it with his word salad.   https://t.co/iBjzvQ3xdq
1307796365284651013 2020-09-21 05:38:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just reading trumps nieces book, maybe I have been on Mars but did not know his dad had Alzheimers. The tendency can be passed on (in the genes as he said today  or yesterday about something else)  Cannot mock that and I am afraid this is his problem .
1307783920067522560 2020-09-21 04:49:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gotta luv trumps talking points..like ballots missing,, stolen, miscounted etc........WHAT A FREAKING LIAR
1307783465098711044 2020-09-21 04:47:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I should not ask this but I will..is your daughter a trump follower?
1307782591852969987 2020-09-21 04:44:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @grandfla12703 Both my kids would disagree. Perhaps we should ask those at top of the ladder
1307782291675058178 2020-09-21 04:42:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I suppose it is a choice of  @realDonaldTrump  and @senatemajldr
1307779031757135873 2020-09-21 04:29:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So even in the Supreme Court if I believe what I just read, facts don't matter to donald, just feelings
1307760424973205507 2020-09-21 03:15:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is trying to evict him
1307760303569088513 2020-09-21 03:15:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump is not pro God
1307755396199780352 2020-09-21 02:55:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What I heard of Moore made sense
1307755214196310021 2020-09-21 02:55:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden was on..soothing, relaxing Biden
1307747379110608898 2020-09-21 02:24:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and a couple others saying it should wait? As for impeaching..he has done so much to be impeached for and that tells u all you need to know about your party..
1307747377017696258 2020-09-21 02:24:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe has something to do with not waiting until RBG was even buried before swooping in like a hawk..or maybe  has to do with Obama and his nominee or even something to do with Mcconell a
1307738966830067712 2020-09-21 01:50:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you like advertising ignorance?
1307730526141394945 2020-09-21 01:17:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and democracy
1307729946270367745 2020-09-21 01:14:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is a person who does not care about anything but  making his puppet master happy-like trump ,no scruples, no morals
1307722739453698048 2020-09-21 00:46:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> will be again after election
1307701192454217728 2020-09-20 23:20:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump pity microphones do not go dead each time he lies..would have been off most of the time
1307700939747479553 2020-09-20 23:19:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one says he can think..not the Supreme Courts job ..but then he says  coronavirus19  will just go away too and vaccines available for all before year end (unless he changed that)
1307700356965691394 2020-09-20 23:17:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at least someone corrected him this time
1307699866752167941 2020-09-20 23:15:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not just visit?
1307698760064159745 2020-09-20 23:10:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jones followers did not realize what Jones was until the last minute and it was too late
1307698207212920832 2020-09-20 23:08:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 @davidmweissman wah nah..
1307697950508933120 2020-09-20 23:07:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was a republican. Not likely I will be again but do not think they were always this phony..just the last few years
1307667847640997889 2020-09-20 21:08:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still cannot believe her body had not yet been buried but the wolves were out in full force.  While not unexpected or surprising it is so disgraceful..says a lot about trumps faith in winning the next election and shows he will do anything for his own desires.
1307667022784933889 2020-09-20 21:04:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Aren't you glad you found out now without a fire and early enough to get it fixed before you will need the heat for the winter?
1307657308294524928 2020-09-20 20:26:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wanted America alone-he forgot to add except for other dictators
1307655494866272256 2020-09-20 20:18:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would trump or his campaign even think of doing anything illegal, ads or anything?
1307655291073421313 2020-09-20 20:18:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think they are for his  people teleprompters .like nars corrected to Mars ..
1307653528027115521 2020-09-20 20:11:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't imagine there is any way to find a humanizing look at trump
1307651605450326016 2020-09-20 20:03:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that how come some nights trump does not slur or mispronounce words -he gets a "big fat shot in the ass before he comes out??  THIS IS A PRESIDENT?
1307649802776309762 2020-09-20 19:56:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> welcome to sanity
1307649671767248896 2020-09-20 19:55:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Notice the masks behind him? How bout in front of him? The Covid19 deaths keep mounting and yet the propaganda keeps churning.
1307648599656927232 2020-09-20 19:51:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not have to agree with everything said or done..can still be friends. trump wants total agreement..real people are not that way
1307648217379676160 2020-09-20 19:50:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He noticed?
1307511070777643008 2020-09-20 10:45:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But ,we can try it out and see what happens
1307510856406700038 2020-09-20 10:44:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If only!!
1307510728925024256 2020-09-20 10:43:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> common sense
1307510443167174656 2020-09-20 10:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I don't know how anyone could miss it. I voted for Hillary too
1307510234597019652 2020-09-20 10:41:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RadioFreeTom @1nonblonde2 Trump has no idea what a moral duty is. Guess his writer provided the sentences and he likes the sound.
1307509947400417280 2020-09-20 10:40:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is his newest chapter in the ongoing reality show. Anything to add  drama " How much lower can I go?" But, Covid 19 is still out there and we are now over 200,000 deaths
1307509072913199105 2020-09-20 10:37:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We hope he will keep his word..but..it's trump
1307508755949649921 2020-09-20 10:35:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yeah but we know what his word is worth
1307508375563964416 2020-09-20 10:34:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @HeathMayo Never been through anything like this in my life. Never want to have the country, my children and grandchildren or you  or anyone go through it again.
1307507923199889408 2020-09-20 10:32:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No one will please everyone 100 percent of the time..but welcome to total sanity.
1307501146622357510 2020-09-20 10:05:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Eleven_Films @pttrn_ntgrty Do not know if you saw this..@Wharfrat2004
1307499750963503105 2020-09-20 10:00:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is a lie everyone wants a vaccine..just not your vaccine..we want the ones the scientists say are useful. when they say they are good to go.not what you say as u apply pressure to them with your knee on their necks
1307499347806949383 2020-09-20 09:58:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that the lowest grade?
1307499157490409472 2020-09-20 09:57:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Without much work, I can imagine that.
1307498607906639879 2020-09-20 09:55:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòä mars is difficult to say..is pronounced nars on some part of that planet
1307498123166707712 2020-09-20 09:53:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well yeah but that was then..takes a special type person to stick with trump..so do not expect them to keep their word
1307494550391402511 2020-09-20 09:39:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anything for attention, like he is on TV instead of president
1307494176477544449 2020-09-20 09:37:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we realize they have their own laws..but election day is coming
1307494001612918784 2020-09-20 09:37:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will be behind bars and it will be so nice
1307482670012788736 2020-09-20 08:52:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is a tear jerker
1307481244658171906 2020-09-20 08:46:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and the greatest majority want no nominee named til after the election. Perhaps donald can work a deal..like both of them get one (if Joe is willing, dont know why not) and donnie holds up his nominee til the election
1307480932912332801 2020-09-20 08:45:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What bothers me is it predictably started last night
1307480352257118208 2020-09-20 08:43:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> great, trump wants, the king wants ,the  dictator wants,  and the king has no clothes on..perhaps @joebiden can make a deal with @realDonaldTrump .both get a drug test but  you do not name a nominee until the election is over.
1307478988487569409 2020-09-20 08:37:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bite your tongue
1307478877623681025 2020-09-20 08:37:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can wish
1307470256978493442 2020-09-20 08:02:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think she had sense enough to know donald would not win and donald has sense enough to know that too.. it would explain the rushin
1307469111195303937 2020-09-20 07:58:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look how they are demeaning the Flag. This is disgraceful. trump want to give them all medals?
1307468665042935808 2020-09-20 07:56:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was he trying a ballet step or a trampoline step?
1307468545295560705 2020-09-20 07:56:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His ego could use that üòáüòÇ
1307468376277647360 2020-09-20 07:55:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he was not hurt but that was funny
1307468161655205888 2020-09-20 07:54:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> With all RBG has done for this country,in my head, it would be better to respect her wishes
1307467763246600195 2020-09-20 07:53:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What does it mean..voting donalds way?
1307466847789420544 2020-09-20 07:49:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if Democracy means legalized cannibalism what does it mean to be a trump follower
1307466263489282052 2020-09-20 07:47:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You could move out of the country? Before you go look up  socialist you will find trump right there
1307465942436327430 2020-09-20 07:45:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe he means the ones he hires for his polls
1307465821837570049 2020-09-20 07:45:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> GROSS
1307465176334184450 2020-09-20 07:42:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He wants to make this funny..it is not it is a decision for the Supreme Court not donalds tv channel
1307465019261677569 2020-09-20 07:42:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You sound like you are trying to get through to ethical, normal, moral people who know about respect and if nothing else, they know about honoring last wishes. This is not who they are
1307464698338652164 2020-09-20 07:40:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would like to think so but have not seen/heard her say she wont vote whichever trump wants when trump wants
1307464529710907392 2020-09-20 07:40:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is no low to low for donnie..but the people that can think wont fall for it, the ones that would fall for it are probably not able to understand a word if it was serious debate.. sounds like trump appealing to the people going low with him
1307463550714216449 2020-09-20 07:36:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he would be that stupid..but I wonder if Joe Biden will fall for it and discuss trumps very own children and their income from all the nepotism
1307463331922485255 2020-09-20 07:35:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÅ
1307463120118480896 2020-09-20 07:34:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> long as you do not sound,  look or act as desperate as him we will
1307438435699953665 2020-09-20 05:56:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has no respect..he just knows what he wants at any cost
1307438277536948228 2020-09-20 05:55:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> in agreement
1307438108745650176 2020-09-20 05:55:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and are made sick /angry by this.He wants politics and ratings this is the Supreme Court not politics or votes
1307438107021709313 2020-09-20 05:55:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not want to discuss him /his timeline..let him give his story full of lies to his supporters. They do not realize all that will be given up. they do not understand truth or fact..why give free space for everyone else who cares about fairness/facts
1307436323372924932 2020-09-20 05:48:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hate to be crude..he is a dirtbag with no sense of decency just showmanship
1307435982132838400 2020-09-20 05:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donald does not need truth or facts..remember?
1307435694718152709 2020-09-20 05:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He thinks so little of his base he crams them closely together, they are not in masks.and he just does not care..just wants to put on a good show and be reelected , if you die you die..he wants what he wants and he wants to stay out of jail and not discuss covid19
1307435194018861056 2020-09-20 05:43:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> perhaps people march ?
1307429341723328513 2020-09-20 05:20:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A trumplikin keep their word? That is like saying a trumplikin has ethics..does not work
1307428849593069568 2020-09-20 05:18:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ChuckGrassley Pigeon..trying to figure out if you are serious or not
1307427944986537986 2020-09-20 05:14:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same craven person would be a member of party of trump so should be a political choice not qualifications choice
1307427510028840963 2020-09-20 05:13:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is all one big reality tv show
1307426737966534658 2020-09-20 05:09:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But she is not specifically saying: "I will not vote before election"
1307413166838685699 2020-09-20 04:16:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should remind trump and doug collins that babies that are not aborted grow up to be adults..and when they are not wanted ...and abused, .you finish the sentence..generations of unborn babies that have a chance to live?
1307412077431140352 2020-09-20 04:11:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did you raise any of the babies put up for adoption? What did you do to show how you value human life? Adore a guy who puts kids in cases? Maybe make excuses for his dislike of touching his fans that shake hands? Covid no mask? Where is the respect for life in any of this?
1307411104491020292 2020-09-20 04:07:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know none of them have any honor or integrity
1307410871300349953 2020-09-20 04:06:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder is there any country that will accept us? No 3rd world we have that now?
1307409357638901762 2020-09-20 04:00:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great idea. Bet they think twice
1307407659335856132 2020-09-20 03:54:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this has turned into such a fine country..something to be proud of and getting so much betterüôÅüòñüò™
1307394763855888392 2020-09-20 03:02:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the person who nominates someone for the Supreme Court, should be someone with morality, integrity ..not for votes..means Biden should nominate
1307394291157864449 2020-09-20 03:01:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that why you are so much like your dad..and granddad?is it about the genes?
1307393822209519618 2020-09-20 02:59:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they would do what it takes to clear the streets and then blame the protestors
1307393404989583362 2020-09-20 02:57:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not a good or smart thing to do..we can hate or intensely dislike the s.o.b. or anyone in the white house but not kill him or anyone else over it
1307392527713042433 2020-09-20 02:54:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can hope but that would bring down the wrath of donald on her
1307392390785839104 2020-09-20 02:53:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is a hater who wants to raise his brown shirt children to hate and omit the truth about the usa. hitler did the exact same thing
1307391852488855552 2020-09-20 02:51:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably won the man right over
1307383356611612675 2020-09-20 02:17:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am more concerned with qualifications than color..but we will see.  first need to get out and vote
1307379071354109957 2020-09-20 02:00:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have to agree..unlike anything else, that does make sense  https://t.co/ERNwwZkkfN
1307378844467331075 2020-09-20 01:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LisaPad23455182 would follow but already am..üòÉ
1307378477872553984 2020-09-20 01:58:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CarlFmd  so witch was it? witch? or you do not know
1307368976880631809 2020-09-20 01:20:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> witch finger ..clever wife
1307368361425276929 2020-09-20 01:18:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> integrity? that is not in their vocabulary
1307359518901391365 2020-09-20 00:42:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wise words

1307350424412880897 2020-09-20 00:06:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC
1307349704305500164 2020-09-20 00:03:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not getting on trumps bad side must be priceless
1307349288922513411 2020-09-20 00:02:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you so pleased with him or so afraid of him?
1307346465270968321 2020-09-19 23:51:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 but that is me :)
1307346268268699649 2020-09-19 23:50:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 I would just be happy if they vote for Biden
1307337381729710087 2020-09-19 23:14:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Got it, thanks for the explanation...but sure waste of emotion he doesn't feel your hate, only you do. I missed the vote Jill crowd.Hope he will vote Biden this time since then is gone. Maybe he wont be so pathetic this time.
1307336912210927617 2020-09-19 23:13:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Never forget he is just like trump..no bottom
1307336193948954625 2020-09-19 23:10:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 @esglaude uh?
1307334927843721218 2020-09-19 23:05:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC
1307326424282431488 2020-09-19 22:31:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol well qualified for nothing but it would not stop him
1307325359432630289 2020-09-19 22:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has no low he is his concern
1307318204000284674 2020-09-19 21:58:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gosh we are such a generous people.
1307318018372972548 2020-09-19 21:57:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder who wrote this
1307299639637479424 2020-09-19 20:44:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just wish there could have been a pause of  a couple days..out of respect for RBG
1307152367943643136 2020-09-19 10:59:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sounds more like it will turn into a nightmare if he is reelected
1307152160895971329 2020-09-19 10:58:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump do not know where you get all your stupid lies but really wish you could provide a link from a fact check site..if you don't it can only be that like your other lies..not true and you are exploiting your base
1307150871315337217 2020-09-19 10:53:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Being white, I do not like being embarrassed. Must be majority white bigots-the guys with the supremacist after their names..it is the only way there can be 45 percent
1307134156909010944 2020-09-19 09:47:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> musta had this statement waiting..could not even wait until her body is cold. All she has done and he can't respect it. Guess he cant respect himself either..must be why trump, barr and mcconnell go so well together-another incidence of birds of feather
1307133493940551682 2020-09-19 09:44:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Murkowski said she would not vote until after election
1307132287625105411 2020-09-19 09:39:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Respect? What is that to those cretins? So afraid they  cant do that without cheating either.
1307118796411416582 2020-09-19 08:46:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if trump is declared winner he can do that but first has to be declared..so EVERYONE HAS TO VOTE BLUE
1307117920871493633 2020-09-19 08:42:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Needed that
1307115680391671809 2020-09-19 08:33:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PreetBharara @HonorDecency If he was helping he would have respected her wishes and let her stay a little longerüôÅüòñüò™
1307112165078335489 2020-09-19 08:19:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heartbroken
1307111803659354112 2020-09-19 08:18:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This gif gives me chlls
1307111030305288192 2020-09-19 08:15:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is what she said and it should be respected
1307110734007066624 2020-09-19 08:14:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> small but mighty
1307110466993491969 2020-09-19 08:13:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Dont give up..has to be way to stop it or postpone I should say
1307101892347146240 2020-09-19 07:39:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So my question is...who or what do you support? The Constitution or trump ? You cant do both
1307101620975611905 2020-09-19 07:38:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 2 or 3 or 7 does not much matter I guess
1307101445582458880 2020-09-19 07:37:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How sweet it is!!!
1307101059698036736 2020-09-19 07:35:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> RIP  #RBG you have always been an inspiration and will always continue to be
1307100842152071170 2020-09-19 07:35:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You mean you are not interested in Black lives. You are pathetic @ag
1307100563620999169 2020-09-19 07:33:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sad
1307100474684960772 2020-09-19 07:33:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For many reasons I am sad and angry..RBG is dead..I know it sounds selfish but heck of time. Really thought she would make it.  She did have to be in a lot of pain Glad the pain is over for her
1307099035946360837 2020-09-19 07:27:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @slmalamud @D_jeneration who they?
1307088500571996160 2020-09-19 06:45:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who they? we can hope
1307066453447802883 2020-09-19 05:18:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad he was taken out if mask was the rule
1307066177110278144 2020-09-19 05:17:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anything trump accuses others of he is doing, has done or plans on doing
1307065935963062276 2020-09-19 05:16:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But if trump were from scranton and acted the same way..I would still be disgusted by him
1307048270343155714 2020-09-19 04:06:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> talk to a plant it would enjoy it more
1307048185236516866 2020-09-19 04:05:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YAY and in Oregon
1307048100243156997 2020-09-19 04:05:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he would not answer
1307042358501019649 2020-09-19 03:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Everything I heard was a scam..on himself
1307042177722257408 2020-09-19 03:41:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I went out to walk the dog when I left was about 3 min into trump and 5  lies..now i am back and he just wrapped up with 3 lies..not noticing that Paterson is in NJ (he spoke like 2 dif places)..wondering if he told any truth in between?
1307041754101805064 2020-09-19 03:40:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> show proof trump loves this country? trump has never been criticized for loving his country (just not USA) He is criticized because the USA is the country and it is not his country but he sure wants you to think it is. He lies like a rug ..and if you doubt it, go fact check.
1307026273596772353 2020-09-19 02:38:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Monaheart1229 @slmalamud The very same to you both- and your families
1307024200394309632 2020-09-19 02:30:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he never learned trust but verify
1307004306604908545 2020-09-19 01:11:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally agree.
1307002579071664128 2020-09-19 01:04:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am impressed by what I see
1306990745308614656 2020-09-19 00:17:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Think I would be afraid of just paper..unless it can be copied first
1306990582477266945 2020-09-19 00:16:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Observant I am not but sure nice to see some people still are.
1306978430924320768 2020-09-18 23:28:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump
1306978227743870976 2020-09-18 23:27:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bet he read it, questioned it..and  now hitting himself in the head but, also knows how important he is to fixing this mess
1306977707062898691 2020-09-18 23:25:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Video is well done. I sure like facts.
1306975532949606401 2020-09-18 23:17:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @_DirectorWray So now we know this is fake
1306974996712087552 2020-09-18 23:14:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering if donald really thinks we believe him or the Officers.  If he thinks we believe him, he is as gullible as his voters
1306970441412743173 2020-09-18 22:56:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Disgruntled with trump no doubt..and I believe they had good reason for that
1306967677299232769 2020-09-18 22:45:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am thinking a lot of Biden voters do not want neighbors too know but they will vote Biden
1306961869605941250 2020-09-18 22:22:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> white nationalists or are my eyes deceiving me?
1306949686234882054 2020-09-18 21:34:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mask has nothing to do with why he won't go. üòÅüòá
1306949251314987008 2020-09-18 21:32:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh shocking!! Sure not the mask that keeps him away.
1306943839836532739 2020-09-18 21:11:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Until last election I had always been excited to vote..this year I am doing cartwheels as I wait for election day. The excitement is "hyuge"!
1306942779386462208 2020-09-18 21:06:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't remember the last time I slept all night or woke up relaxed. Am in serious agreement with you.
1306942040115220480 2020-09-18 21:03:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hoping her belief system keeps her warm during Maine winters when she will be at home in the cold once elections are done..
1306941615517446152 2020-09-18 21:02:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well, guess we figured besides asking what now..not much to do until Nov..VOTE
1306937343526526976 2020-09-18 20:45:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am strictly guessing, but for the 25th amendment, cooperation is needed between both sides ..repubs wont give it..so Dems are restricted in what they can do.
1306925916631826433 2020-09-18 19:59:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So what is done about it besides hand wringing?
1306925748406693888 2020-09-18 19:59:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No doubt a lot of those in government do not agree with trump..but scared witless to leave and even more afraid to speak up.  I am very impressed by devos top aide. She is the definition of a patriot.
1306925083450126336 2020-09-18 19:56:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Long ago I noticed trump starts the trouble then runs in to fix it..my hero
1306924853807718400 2020-09-18 19:55:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh yeah ..takes an Einstein to figure she needs to get attention that way rather than with her Einstein brain.
1306924559334092802 2020-09-18 19:54:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Or because he is aware of topics beyond donald trump
1306924149332475905 2020-09-18 19:52:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bidens teleprompters do not preach hate and division
1306924001810354176 2020-09-18 19:52:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder for how long she has practiced that look
1306923163222265856 2020-09-18 19:48:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Barr does not care if people do not approve, as long as trump approves
1306917557123809280 2020-09-18 19:26:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thinking about those debates is certainly making me smile.üòÅ
1306915945080905733 2020-09-18 19:20:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he and his family recover quickly and that he will talk about his experiences as he tells people to wear masks
1306915270326390788 2020-09-18 19:17:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kylecupp So very, very sorry.  üò•üôè
1306913592592273410 2020-09-18 19:10:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that could be the truth..he feels insecure, which is why he is such a bully or tries to be
1306913259174473730 2020-09-18 19:09:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you knew how to think and were not so brainwashed..you might understand
1306912932912128002 2020-09-18 19:08:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and yet, last I heard he refused to give his own dna
1306786728213180417 2020-09-18 10:46:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Eisenhower is dead, cant do trump any good. I would have loved to have attended
1306786191317127169 2020-09-18 10:44:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has never cared about any voter or any group unless they do good things for him and he would throw anyone under the bus that got in his way
1306785825284411392 2020-09-18 10:43:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÅüòÇ
1306785441094545414 2020-09-18 10:41:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Go to Bidens website.
1306784791405228036 2020-09-18 10:39:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> because he can and he does
1306784443370217473 2020-09-18 10:37:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps Joe is not wrapped up in himself..or name calling etc, does make a difference as does caring about the country .
1306784010564259842 2020-09-18 10:36:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is amazingly fantastic.
1306783693005033474 2020-09-18 10:34:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yet to figure it out but if you can, I would love what you came up with.
1306783247444123648 2020-09-18 10:32:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A judge in the Jakarta area has the right idea. People must wear masks to combat COVID19..if they dont wear masks &amp; get caught, they are now digging graves for victims of Covid 19. Wonder if that changes their thought process? My feeling is tour of Covid hospital but this works.
1306780500938424325 2020-09-18 10:22:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump would have told his tough guys to throw them out and not be so kind. Biden is civilized
1306779901576572930 2020-09-18 10:19:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> reads something other than comics?
1306779628955197440 2020-09-18 10:18:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why? Because he knew answers?
1306778688843853825 2020-09-18 10:14:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What embarrassing senior moment? Did trump speak and i missed it?
1306766827633152001 2020-09-18 09:27:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @thehill Nothing wrong with this headline. He said it, unlike trump who denied it about himself
1306766389164879875 2020-09-18 09:26:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @The_Johnald @JoeBiden and to think all those years of experience,   no one stopped to think he was elected,. I do not think I ever heard of him doing anything like @realdonaldtrump has done  or saying things like donald has done. His integrity has never been called into question, until now
1306765376974401537 2020-09-18 09:21:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps that is because @JoeBiden Biden thinks and trump does not know how
1306752360308453381 2020-09-18 08:30:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh it is not just you. It is anyone not in a red state, anyone that does not support and agree with him..not just you
1306737565970640896 2020-09-18 07:31:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> after? Prince Eric said? I would hope that it is up to the AG who comes in when
1306736091786084352 2020-09-18 07:25:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope when this pastor recovers he will spend as much time telling people to wear masks as he did telling the people coronavirus19 is not real
1306733022910312448 2020-09-18 07:13:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The head of the Moderna team working on a vaccine says you have " a vaccine now, wear masks"
1306727502526713856 2020-09-18 06:51:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Robert Hendrickson..so very excellent. Clear , concise, perfect
1306726885427163137 2020-09-18 06:49:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When he shows and says who he is..believe him
1306726220852277248 2020-09-18 06:46:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Since you knew enough to post here I would think you could speak to people that the Lt Col cant reach. Thank you!
1306725822351507456 2020-09-18 06:44:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Taking a wild guess that you helped that class and its voters tremendously
1306720241477615617 2020-09-18 06:22:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you saying that donald will say anything for a vote? BIDEN WON'T!
1306719836110761985 2020-09-18 06:21:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @HenryHatfield11 @AshaRangappa_ If you fall for trumps definition of history and you believe what he says, it is you dumb as rocks
1306719107597971456 2020-09-18 06:18:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> read or listen to tapes from Bob Woodward and trump tne put two and two together
1306718375515693057 2020-09-18 06:15:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @OliviaTroye   thank you!
1306717409735323653 2020-09-18 06:11:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why would he? which do you choose USA or trump. cant have both
1306716992003604482 2020-09-18 06:09:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> indoctrination is what you are trying to do
1306716667955884032 2020-09-18 06:08:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> absolutely true
1306704390158454785 2020-09-18 05:19:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump wont try to debate just outshout and lie
1306704277214240768 2020-09-18 05:19:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you try to hide facts and make it all about you and your sort..no one ashamed of history just you trying to hide it
1306692769952522242 2020-09-18 04:33:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So you are pro USA..üòá
1306676545931575296 2020-09-18 03:29:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Which are you? Pro USA or pro trump? You cannot be both
1306676004140781569 2020-09-18 03:26:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and to rewrite history
1306675871965736960 2020-09-18 03:26:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I wonder if you realize donald is taking away your rights..patriotic is not kissing up..patriotic is standing up
1306674559085543425 2020-09-18 03:21:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at this point all i can say is tough luck
1306661882925928449 2020-09-18 02:30:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> After first billion never have enough
1306653824090861568 2020-09-18 01:58:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when you have your birthday cake..close your eyes and wish before you blow out the candles..not asking to much for your wish to come true..very unselfish..happy birthday
1306653532624490498 2020-09-18 01:57:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Probably why he is off on medical leave
1306653329909575680 2020-09-18 01:56:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> A radiologist now knows more than experts
1306653112711737344 2020-09-18 01:55:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> another one ??
1306652764903276544 2020-09-18 01:54:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do mean for rehearsal right? Not for actual debate?
1306635422253101059 2020-09-18 00:45:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maine 12 pts is good but bet u can do better
1306633760105017345 2020-09-18 00:38:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ag  he means he is not interested in black lives but too gutless to say it
1306633433624596480 2020-09-18 00:37:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think we have noticed what donald is doing with russias help so what do we do?
1306633034913984512 2020-09-18 00:36:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ALL LIVES MATTER unless you do not support trump..no matter what color you are or what state you are in
1306632590313639936 2020-09-18 00:34:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess making clear plans for dictatorship
1306632452232839170 2020-09-18 00:33:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe he went to medical school and got a degree without telling anyone........or maybe @gopleader and trump are idiots..and do not need degrees if the idea is to shaft the public and show how little they think of Americans
1306632116936093698 2020-09-18 00:32:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> barr is not only trumps mouthpiece..also an idiot like donald is a genius knows more about vaccine then people who spent years getting an education and then research for more education..
1306631442672345095 2020-09-18 00:29:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden  that comment you made to donald is like banging your head against a brick wall..All you get is a headache.
1306614704375291904 2020-09-17 23:23:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if he gets his way, wonder what he would name his country
1306614393338310658 2020-09-17 23:22:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never do that üòá

1306613411158126592 2020-09-17 23:18:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump fans should definitely be first in line
1306613280455225344 2020-09-17 23:17:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do any of you have enough guts to say to him this is moving too fast, it is dangerous?
1306612921145995266 2020-09-17 23:16:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nothing out of the words of trump or his allies should shock anyone
1306612665528320000 2020-09-17 23:15:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> "allegedly" the same degenerate that thinks he is god and everyone owes him
1306612472737128451 2020-09-17 23:14:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the most corrupt admin in history..no surprise
1306599021847490560 2020-09-17 22:20:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yours..don't you understand , virus, crime, anything..everything stops at the border and says "ok, are you red or blue? I need to know so I know if I am welcome and can cross your border."  that president you mention is stupid enough to think we believe that.
1306567312812761088 2020-09-17 20:14:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Barr would prefer go out and infect others and watch them die.
1306566939830087680 2020-09-17 20:13:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Easy, they remove the uterus that solves the problem of removing the fetus which in turn, gives permission to say "pro-life"
1306566081675489281 2020-09-17 20:10:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is funny..if only you were not so pathetic Jr...by the way breitbart is not known for facts.
1306565741009866753 2020-09-17 20:08:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ask the election board?
1306565608373465088 2020-09-17 20:08:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is why trump is so desperate..that will be result if he does not win the election
1306563012980027392 2020-09-17 19:57:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÄ Didn't you have a need for that measurement?
1306560689566253057 2020-09-17 19:48:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Please do not let the events that trump  is creating distract you from voting for @JoeBiden . They will get worse..just not factual
1306426222101041157 2020-09-17 10:54:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought he had  a burp stuck in there somewhere
1306425880512733184 2020-09-17 10:52:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why doesn't trump leave them alone to do their job..his radiologist has no clue, trump has no clue..so  why not step back , let the experts handle it  @realdonaldtrump
1306425539914334208 2020-09-17 10:51:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MittRomney very sensible of you..so nice to see a real Republican still there and speaking up
1306425310980775936 2020-09-17 10:50:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when i think cant get more insane or maybe criminal it does
1306425163391660032 2020-09-17 10:50:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sounds like trump and kushner share the same crickets
1306412975574650880 2020-09-17 10:01:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would just ignore whatever he types..more we acknowledge more he spreads his crap around
1306409368829788164 2020-09-17 09:47:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess they are truly desperate
1306409127263039499 2020-09-17 09:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Welcome to the world of " if you have a brain, can think/  reason, you passionately despise trump"
1306400360966352897 2020-09-17 09:11:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if you really believe he would leave peacefully after 4 more years..so is moot point
1306392224876425217 2020-09-17 08:39:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like anyone else he deserves a trial..or many trials for many charges..but does deserve trials
1306391828166516736 2020-09-17 08:37:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have not been there in years, always loved going there..and always found it friendly  ..would love to go visit but cant happen. Only one country I ever loved I live there and after donald is out, I will grow to love what it represents again
1306391275298607104 2020-09-17 08:35:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be restored to a rose garden and work of beauty. Don't know about Jackie Kennedy's garden though
1306390283601481729 2020-09-17 08:31:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I cannot take anymore trump
1306390075111084032 2020-09-17 08:30:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he got from his meeting in the morning with CV vaccine experts  ..we want info and honesty, Biden calmly gave it . We do not want propaganda, lies or any b.s.
1306390073139769347 2020-09-17 08:30:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe if you stopped playing toadie to trump and watched anything he puts on tv lately..you would understand. Biden made sense and answered without changing the topics He did not try to do more than tell facts
1306388835815882753 2020-09-17 08:25:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he thinks we are.
1306388699027058688 2020-09-17 08:25:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pardon me but.........LOL
1306388401160101888 2020-09-17 08:24:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> 25th is good but impeachment sounds perfect need less cooperation from his henchmen
1306374091352481792 2020-09-17 07:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you listen carefully you can hear the sounds of my disbelief getting the best of me and so I am banging my head on the desk..might never stop
1306373752683401222 2020-09-17 07:25:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> everything has been crazy with all of them..now the same crazies are insane. Can the 25th amendment apply to others? It should apply to all
1306373429130657792 2020-09-17 07:24:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me too! @ThadCrewsJr ..astute man
1306372104548483072 2020-09-17 07:19:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he knows he did not
1306371822380896256 2020-09-17 07:18:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now they  know who she is, I am offended but not black. I noticed her .I silently congratulated her and I was impressed.  I am also sure a lot of other women noticed her.
1306371821013524480 2020-09-17 07:18:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is any white woman offended with Joy Reid or just me? She is talking to Prof. Black who basically told trump to shut up last night at the town hall.. Joy said that that comment must have made every black woman sit up.
1306356141795037184 2020-09-17 06:15:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> such a sweet dream
1306355793231515654 2020-09-17 06:14:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump   will u pretend you know what is going on in the world and sit quietly?  You do not own the country, you are not god either ,you are not expected to know all..shut up and let experts talk then people might think you are bright
1306355296030392320 2020-09-17 06:12:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Which GOP Senator?
1306355136835526656 2020-09-17 06:11:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he even have the idea of how idiotic he sounds?
1306354990408228866 2020-09-17 06:11:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't trump let the people who know what they are talking about talk?
1306351139764482049 2020-09-17 05:55:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Caputo is on a medical break..he needs it..be nice if trump would do that
1306350063531233287 2020-09-17 05:51:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can imagine trump now..stomping his feet and pretending he is the doctor saying, I want this by election day and that is it!!!!..I will listen to scientists
1306272584082821120 2020-09-17 00:43:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How on earth can this have happened?
1306271698472271874 2020-09-17 00:40:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> republicans are not immune
1306271100830134278 2020-09-17 00:37:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is disgusting..his morals (or lack of) alone make him not fit to be president
1306257385577684993 2020-09-16 23:43:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stay healthy children..hope your families do too
1306257178156769281 2020-09-16 23:42:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shamefully 2/3 of younger kids do not believe the holocaust happened..this is probably part of that group.
1306256770898296832 2020-09-16 23:40:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You sounded just like trump
1306254241527463943 2020-09-16 23:30:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> herd mentality lets you try to talk yourself into herd immunity (does not work-but you can try)
1306253904154365954 2020-09-16 23:29:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was impressed
1306253829520982020 2020-09-16 23:29:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do you think he cares?
1306253516126728193 2020-09-16 23:28:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess could not read the height of the overpass..or figured like his cult does that the trestle will part when the god wannabe gets there..(it did not) just proves still a mortal..maybe they should try again with trump on board üòá
1306253083324932098 2020-09-16 23:26:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is your daddies country ..yours too since you encourage him
1306252629375438849 2020-09-16 23:24:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> please show us one "great" review would even take 1 "good" review
1306252494251659266 2020-09-16 23:23:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all that ignorance in the head of the president of this country? sinful
1306252321240895489 2020-09-16 23:23:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone that starts paying attention to what trump says and does..will be voting for @Joebiden
1306251232185638912 2020-09-16 23:18:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can sure hope so
1306251151134863367 2020-09-16 23:18:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump uses hitlers propaganda minister tactics to inoculate his supporters, who I would guess are bigoted and do not feel included so also afraid
1306227453719961600 2020-09-16 21:44:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can trump have dirt on every single republican ? Or maybe they do not want to see  democracy survive?
1306226582873407490 2020-09-16 21:41:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure you are not alone thinking, as insane as it is , it is possible
1306226298336014336 2020-09-16 21:39:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> another thought..wonder if trump believes the Holocaust did not happen
1306225546729316353 2020-09-16 21:36:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Worse than not good..is the Holocaust no longer taught in schools?
1306221197865226240 2020-09-16 21:19:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> doesn't everyone?  must admit though, been looking all over for mine they must have sprouted wings and flown away
1306220970949177345 2020-09-16 21:18:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ambush? why because people asked questions that mattered to them? Or, are you sucking up to trump so you can commiserate with him and he wont mouth off about fox for not defending him?
1306220357465108480 2020-09-16 21:16:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did anyone ask his name? He probably would have answered that honestly
1306220195401342977 2020-09-16 21:15:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YES would you?
1306219132409516033 2020-09-16 21:11:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What happened to the undecided? Did they run to Biden?
1306209334456705027 2020-09-16 20:32:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Deep question. If either, which scares you?
1306208725099839488 2020-09-16 20:30:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If üòáget that herd mentality maybe he thinks it converts to herd immunity..just have to work on it
1306208511689404416 2020-09-16 20:29:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Stable genius who won't tell the truth..not organizers doing..just donald
1306208243065257991 2020-09-16 20:28:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they are desperate, trump and cronies have been known to fake information, photos and videos..and/or to use foreign videos and disinformation..why be surprised?
1306207791447707649 2020-09-16 20:26:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gosh how very strange of them to have a problem with that
1306207633234329603 2020-09-16 20:25:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if donny really wants the job of president or wants to cause trouble. He always shoots himself in the foot but the last few weeks he has outdone himself
1306059737465790464 2020-09-16 10:38:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was a good time for him to depart
1306059601910128641 2020-09-16 10:37:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Herd mentality means think like member of herd until you achieve herd mentality that will confer herd immunity, but Doctors not even sure herd immunity will last more than 3 months but they are sure that herd mentality wont.
1306058554714075142 2020-09-16 10:33:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I keep telling myself that posture is because of height or because he is so tense he can't sit back to relax a little
1306058057676468224 2020-09-16 10:31:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> love it!!!!
1306057859487223809 2020-09-16 10:30:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump he still says he thinks he cant do more..and yet no masks at his rallies and no one asked about that?
1306057413435498497 2020-09-16 10:28:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well it will ..after we are dead and can't tell the difference..we can think it is gone
1306057079459897345 2020-09-16 10:27:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you were president now we could at least take a deep breath knowing on the start to getting better
1306056867664334848 2020-09-16 10:26:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O gee maybe he can't do it in democratic cities because they do not tolerate beating up people  or flash bangs etc, that only makes things worse for longer evnif it sends crowds home at the minute.If only he would talk to the proud boys &amp;other white nationalist groups .would help
1306056151247843336 2020-09-16 10:23:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The charges mean more than the money
1306056019861221376 2020-09-16 10:23:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure a great one
1306055937116049414 2020-09-16 10:22:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Are you surprised?
1306055849127874561 2020-09-16 10:22:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is blithering..but at least his eyes are clear tonight
1306055698409754625 2020-09-16 10:21:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He talks fast when he has no idea what to say
1306054770839478274 2020-09-16 10:18:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not so bad so far..his eyes are clear..give him time snorting getting louder and more frequent
1306047978201907206 2020-09-16 09:51:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People are dying so he is right it will go away along with the people. He is totally unfit
1306047609149288448 2020-09-16 09:49:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My sincere condolences, I know that feeling when everyone goes home. You are not talking to much about it. She was and is your daughter. You are not alone and as long as you breath she is with you.
1306046910978031618 2020-09-16 09:47:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Perhaps barr and trump should show proof that is not the intent
1306046787300593665 2020-09-16 09:46:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought that was the intent..but I would guess he is not hearing
1306046604319830020 2020-09-16 09:45:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she was quite good ..guess he won't be bsing her
1306046466654449664 2020-09-16 09:45:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wished I was there too applaud her
1306041391081033729 2020-09-16 09:25:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> under her desk trying to remain unnoticed
1306041098389917698 2020-09-16 09:23:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guessing trump does not want to remember what he said
1306040991850389506 2020-09-16 09:23:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is trumps mess..when Biden gets in I am sure it will be different, even if it does take a while. trump made a huge mess it won't be cleaned up over night
1306040602992283648 2020-09-16 09:21:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> waiters?
1306037248358576129 2020-09-16 09:08:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not see fit to stoop to trumps level. Why deny it..he is no different than he has been since I started watching and listening to him . (Unlike donald who has gotten way worse than he was)
1306036619938598912 2020-09-16 09:06:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Charlie Kirk heads up some right wing organization called turning point.
1306035933930827776 2020-09-16 09:03:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yes requote the one not done by Charlie Kirk who cannot think for himself
1306035388658716672 2020-09-16 09:01:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People found out how fake and destructive trump is? Hope voting Biden  not forming some other party.
1306019720739598338 2020-09-16 07:59:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realTuckFrumper Jr or daughter prob offered up
1306019574241001473 2020-09-16 07:58:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You gotta be kidding
1306019228970086400 2020-09-16 07:57:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I regret to inform you..cant get a political opinion, just personal attacks
1306002909818224640 2020-09-16 06:52:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trust and trump do not belong in the same sentence
1306002720927756294 2020-09-16 06:51:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right he could have been a hero..but it is not what he wants
1306002490593247234 2020-09-16 06:50:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> .Experience here shows me that only if it affects them do Republicans  pay attention..wondering how he feels now?
1306002118122319879 2020-09-16 06:49:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot believe what republicans have done for my attitude in the last few years..I was a republican.  Now I look at Fred Girod leading people out of the senate and I can give no sympathy
1305996496303779851 2020-09-16 06:26:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/Io5Epzzl8W
1305996229751582728 2020-09-16 06:25:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even back in 2013 you were rabble rousing. You are the cause and you think no one sees or knows
1305994466579316736 2020-09-16 06:18:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/53fKGC702Y
1305993076108918784 2020-09-16 06:13:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How bout a 2 state solution?
1305981872212709377 2020-09-16 05:28:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fantastic!!!
1305975960018313216 2020-09-16 05:05:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÅ
1305970178748973056 2020-09-16 04:42:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anything to change the Covid 19 headline or the forest fires etc..but where is the two state solution?
1305969736128364547 2020-09-16 04:40:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> whatever happened to the girl was 14 when she said trump raped her..showed up at a later age to face him in court for a hearing, the day of the hearing, she disappeared. No idea if she was paid off or what the story was
1305969187064557568 2020-09-16 04:38:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Instead of name dropping who would agree or disagree, see how many with same credentials as Dr Fauci disagree. Use your brain. A radiologist is agreeing with trump so trump brought him in and uses him for advice
1305968799062073351 2020-09-16 04:36:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump does not listen to scientists or anyone that knows more than he does and that is the great majority
1305968232239636483 2020-09-16 04:34:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not normally suggest this but apparently nothing is off base so why not check out donald we have all heard the stories. If lies good for donald maybe lies or facts about donnie also good ..what a pig
1305967468788277249 2020-09-16 04:31:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Regardless of statistics-I thought as parents it is our duty to protect  our kids..not argue over it
1305966967753449474 2020-09-16 04:29:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If the media would show pictures of Covid victims maybe that would help
1305963563371114502 2020-09-16 04:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so this is how he will debate?
1305962523724840960 2020-09-16 04:11:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then perhaps trump should take it
1305960359539376131 2020-09-16 04:03:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why spread this for him? He will leave like it or not as long as everyone votes in blue
1305960139648835585 2020-09-16 04:02:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is currently burning it ,without flames
1305957135109558272 2020-09-16 03:50:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> arrest everyone in that administration üòá
1305956911569928192 2020-09-16 03:49:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it looks like he is publically denying Covid and climate change..I doubt he would respond to that question from Woodward though
1305954611262521351 2020-09-16 03:40:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1305954406446387200 2020-09-16 03:39:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Of course Covid-19 goes to each boundary line of each state  and asks if it is Dem or Repub before it attempts to  come in... it is like masks..asks if wearer is red or blue
1305953891314470912 2020-09-16 03:37:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not be surprised if trump cult went thru neighborhoods just planted the signs then people in the houses woke up and said no way and now Biden signs
1305953466624471040 2020-09-16 03:35:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Still no 2 state solution but the countries are thumping each other on the back
1305953237628080134 2020-09-16 03:34:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course he cannot say that words bigger than 3 letters strain his brain or that Woodwards book was fact
1305946211233468416 2020-09-16 03:06:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jimcramer you say imitating trump? So you think that behaving like a 5 yr old is correct? Why would I trust one financial bit of info you give. You just went from bad to worse
1305945577553891331 2020-09-16 03:04:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now he can stick to more lies , threats and propaganda..o wait does that with or without money
1305944486225285123 2020-09-16 03:00:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think it would be great if trump did not entertain reporters or if no one laughed ,even if what he says is off the wall..like his comment about science and forests
1305935231925587972 2020-09-16 02:23:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does not sound crazy to me..but they do
1305934936705298434 2020-09-16 02:22:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fact is fact
1305934823144521729 2020-09-16 02:21:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jim Cramer should be gone and have a huge heavy fine
1305934678940176385 2020-09-16 02:21:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We have to get courtesy and respect back into this country
1305934197576683521 2020-09-16 02:19:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump prefers this way and yes he should have
1305933868197982211 2020-09-16 02:17:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden is Catholic..not fake christian..or friend of trump..have fun
1305891042156335106 2020-09-15 23:27:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am suddenly thinking trump and regime like the comparison
1305883306030923776 2020-09-15 22:56:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @mhdksafa Of course
1305883171809095680 2020-09-15 22:56:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They might be held prisoners but this is not nazi Germany is it?
1305882566021599232 2020-09-15 22:54:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The idea is to give airtime to any cretin who can try to cause trouble..so yup this is hell
1305875720724512768 2020-09-15 22:26:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We ask first why are you fighting against changing this administration?  Just sit there and help get Joe in so we can get this changed
1305875468030291968 2020-09-15 22:25:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump did you intentionally show Russian jets to support our troops with?
1305875279865356288 2020-09-15 22:25:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and now what?
1305870740890300416 2020-09-15 22:07:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> funny this is not..but we need to realize these people are this gullible and ignorant and they probably figure hitler is good, after all look what he did to those he disliked
1305870087002501121 2020-09-15 22:04:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Same old trash, he has nothing sensible or true to say-difficult to talk about climate change since he rolled back all regulations out of jealousy. Covid science/medical news?  He  does not believe in that science or medicine either
1305868313126490112 2020-09-15 21:57:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks to me like most had masks..guessing those are the ones sitting behind trump
1305867824062255105 2020-09-15 21:55:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow you are such  a good lemming..very impressive. Bet you got a pat on the head.
1305867511657889795 2020-09-15 21:54:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee, I miss all the fun..again I missed it
1305866966759026689 2020-09-15 21:52:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If America is made great again..I wonder how many if any of those at that rally will be alive to see it.
1305866797095227393 2020-09-15 21:51:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and that cult prefers ignorance to facts..they get their share of the blame for intentionally walking into those rallies
1305866426117435395 2020-09-15 21:49:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Better not at all
1305866149264011266 2020-09-15 21:48:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has done so much worthy of the 25th
1305681788145197056 2020-09-15 09:36:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fox News should be renamed fox opinion pieces specializing in no news
1305681492488728576 2020-09-15 09:35:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only donald
1305681312460738560 2020-09-15 09:34:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump cant tell the truth and in this case i do not think he cares enough to learn the truth
1305680915335708672 2020-09-15 09:32:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just hurry up and win so we can get you in
1305676651460689921 2020-09-15 09:15:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More time goes by more disgusting you get. Good thing most people are more discerning  and among things we know is that @JoeBiden is more civilized
1305676649397133314 2020-09-15 09:15:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  what exactly are you trying to do ? Do you want to tell us about your Black people &amp; how you have done so much for Black people? or are you trying to cause  more trouble because you are so desperate?
1305675391718305792 2020-09-15 09:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SpoxHHS  what,why ..you need to check your ego at the door and look up what you speak of before you speak
1305674909268488193 2020-09-15 09:08:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish people would study up on Jim Jones ..this is so insane
1305674782436986880 2020-09-15 09:08:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is such insanity. Each time someone says " I have freedom to do what I want and I can think for myself"..my head spins..
1305674531214954496 2020-09-15 09:07:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Windmills make so much noise that they cause trees to explode with a tremendous pop and then burst into flame
1305674184073371648 2020-09-15 09:05:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üôèüò¢üôè
1305673596799508480 2020-09-15 09:03:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LindseyGrahamSC  Once upon a time I cared what you thought.. but at this point..I just do not care what you say . You are an annoying piece of something on the bottom of my shoe
1305672869326794753 2020-09-15 09:00:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have decided I must be really old because absolutely none of the trumps or their  "family" or their followers make sense
1305672602388660226 2020-09-15 08:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I remember when a sign like that was joke
1305672313908719616 2020-09-15 08:58:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well lets have another rally.
1305672085067493376 2020-09-15 08:57:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I must ask..are you saying prosecutors do not issue reports? Did i misunderstand?
1305671911834353664 2020-09-15 08:56:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad people are speaking out and up
1305671591326613504 2020-09-15 08:55:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the one that is president here..but I do not know why took this long for so many to figure it out
1305649827703713792 2020-09-15 07:29:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are right they don't so must be someone riding through the trees just setting them all off as they go üòä
1305649599252701185 2020-09-15 07:28:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I just went back and saw that for the first time..I think I have trump blindness and exhaustion. You are right they don't explode. Thanks
1305648696349069312 2020-09-15 07:24:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess those up for reelection do not want to be reelected either
1305619594330202113 2020-09-15 05:29:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That's ok now he is not sure if the earth is warming or there is climate change..would we think he would say different?
1305612655751815168 2020-09-15 05:01:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or try
1305612551338762241 2020-09-15 05:01:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> particularly you, make sure you vote by mail and then go try again in the polling location (that is trumps idea) and you should follow his suggestion
1305600260799107072 2020-09-15 04:12:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump flicked off the Gov like a fly
1305595502378049537 2020-09-15 03:53:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not worried because he is too selfish to think of others
1305592131457867778 2020-09-15 03:39:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to selfish to care about others..he just does not want it
1305592006706692099 2020-09-15 03:39:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I really don't think trump has the sense to love himself..but he wants to be the boss of this country. I think he is totally insecure
1305591718444662784 2020-09-15 03:38:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To me, you are a hero and have been since I saw you at the hearings. I am looking forward to you and Lester Holt tonight
1305591144248758272 2020-09-15 03:36:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never would have guessed.   You do speak truth
1305590873120534536 2020-09-15 03:34:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also could be campers and a gust of wind
1305590737736736777 2020-09-15 03:34:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can be lightening strike or just too much heat
1305590535831392257 2020-09-15 03:33:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is so crazy and heartbreaking
1305574049028935680 2020-09-15 02:28:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trees do dry out and  a spark can set them off
1305573758753746945 2020-09-15 02:26:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> citation: trumps crickets
1305563033306042368 2020-09-15 01:44:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just add to the list of lies and propaganda
1305562906231214080 2020-09-15 01:43:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @maddow Oh gees..
1305561879142596608 2020-09-15 01:39:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> could be underestimate too who knows? Has to be a better way to get statistics for rallies, meets,e tc
1305561272361070593 2020-09-15 01:37:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sad and scary
1305561108162449409 2020-09-15 01:36:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VP Biden is on CNN and MSNBC discussing all the crises going on now
1305552036734406659 2020-09-15 01:00:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he means it
1305550835779334144 2020-09-15 00:55:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is not kidding if he is reelected he has no plans to leave unless it is to hand it to his children
1305543109401612290 2020-09-15 00:25:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> His attendees come down with it as do FBI agents and aides..do you really believe he would tell you? He is like anyone he tells to do something he knows is wrong or will end badly..he tells others to do it, not himself
1305542466544832512 2020-09-15 00:22:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no and some (like Caine) die..and some like FBI agents get to bite the bullet for him. I hope they have recovered but no idea
1305539910850543618 2020-09-15 00:12:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe someone should send her a copy when it is released..then she can see it for herself and no longer ignore the truth
1305536905770041347 2020-09-15 00:00:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They can ask ..because trump likes that idea ..does not make it a good idea or an idea to be followed. Perhaps a real debate not an event is a better idea
1305525602829598725 2020-09-14 23:15:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> perhaps most stupid thing I have heard..but I guess trumps base will buy it lol
1305519122609041410 2020-09-14 22:49:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§£ I will miss them over the next few months but some will take u seriously and jump right on this
1305509898730590208 2020-09-14 22:13:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> has a goatee and a tail
1305509484337430528 2020-09-14 22:11:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How stupid. Joe Biden does not have a disastrous record on CV19. He tried to steer trump the right way, trump chose to ignore. Trump has the disastrous record, you do not help
1305508625163726848 2020-09-14 22:08:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump means his "law and order"
1305508464484024320 2020-09-14 22:07:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You noticed hm
1305508120848932871 2020-09-14 22:06:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Scottcrates Have a great day!
1305507934097547274 2020-09-14 22:05:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Put cruel at the top of the list. Sadly I do not think you are being too cynical, I think more realistic
1305502100680585218 2020-09-14 21:42:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG ..I truly wonder if any of these supporters ever hear what he says or look around at what he has done
1305501594751037443 2020-09-14 21:40:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry üôèüò• Keep faith, however it works out, it will be the best for him.   Take care of you, he is in good hands.
1305500947649646592 2020-09-14 21:37:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TimKennedyMMA @joerogan @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump It would be up to Biden and trump..but I do like the 4 hours no live audience etc..just prefer someone a little more qualified to moderate it.
1305499404309344260 2020-09-14 21:31:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is a covid party..but still true
1305499211979542529 2020-09-14 21:30:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does he have a problem in his pants?
1305499087689654273 2020-09-14 21:30:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yes
1305499027811827714 2020-09-14 21:29:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would not like trump if any party or no party...would like to see some human qualities cause I do not like him or  see him as a human
1305498630787391491 2020-09-14 21:28:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Something is wrong and needs to be looked into
1305498477884043265 2020-09-14 21:27:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would make my day
1305498361710116866 2020-09-14 21:27:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sanders was not named to represent the dems because of his radical ideas and he needs to stop trying to sow seeds ..this election is just too important
1305497742643548161 2020-09-14 21:24:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am impressed Fox has gotten some sanity
1305497049727668224 2020-09-14 21:22:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Scottcrates No idea what you are talking about
1305496948057796608 2020-09-14 21:21:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Scottcrates You are not scamming me I would not send any personal info. Never a moron to verify before personal info is sent.  Your response says plenty.
1305323148523507714 2020-09-14 09:51:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Scottcrates send you personal info from a receipt? THINK NOT
1305322783342288896 2020-09-14 09:49:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> give you the receipt with personal info? hmm
1305317384543186944 2020-09-14 09:28:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/zmA7K175Nv
1305316978115182592 2020-09-14 09:26:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have heard this is done often..and if they do this..what else would they do and who would they pay to do it?
1305316475973054464 2020-09-14 09:24:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @BearroristJodi Hope you know how many are pulling for you. Take a deep breathe and keep pulling for yourself
1305315486394089473 2020-09-14 09:20:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and trump says what? He rallies ,spreads some covid? And about the Ambassador?
1305315040216707072 2020-09-14 09:18:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bob Woodward did not destroy trump. trump does it on his own.  Just finally , people are saying it all outloud. People should have done it years ago
1305314749698183170 2020-09-14 09:17:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to gain more money and power..if your life were so wonderful you would not be as you are
1305314499130396672 2020-09-14 09:16:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is no Q it is a conspiracy theory..so  anyone can be q gees this is so crazy. trump is a bad guy. At this point i fear for the worlds mental health
1305313063688601603 2020-09-14 09:11:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just admit it we are a kind generous people..no matter how bad things are we can always afford to throw money away on food for the top of the food chain..so many regular people can't afford food for themselves but it's more important to feed  the social butterflies
1305311967477936128 2020-09-14 09:06:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> insanity.. I am just so baffled and confused. I know what common sense tells me..then I stare at this and shake my head.
1305311330216312833 2020-09-14 09:04:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How do you convince the trump rally trumplikins that if trump even cared about them he would either insist on masks or cancel the rallies? i still cant imagine this
1305303414604206082 2020-09-14 08:32:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> try reality..1/4 of population of world and 25 percent of covid illness
1305302841863671808 2020-09-14 08:30:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why couldn't someone say "there is no bay of pigs award?"
1305298843286810624 2020-09-14 08:14:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you can be sure we will never get the count on how many
1305298622322540550 2020-09-14 08:13:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @jaketapper fine job!!
1305298216569757696 2020-09-14 08:12:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump you must hate politifact uh?
1305287649180123136 2020-09-14 07:30:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice to see other stores are joining in
1305287464047841282 2020-09-14 07:29:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not likely he would die or even get sick..if he did he might learn respect for others
1305287238876569608 2020-09-14 07:28:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #RunoftheTrumpies
1305286616332853248 2020-09-14 07:25:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump would sell his mother
1305286276027908098 2020-09-14 07:24:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I see your tweet, I just do not see mine most of the time
1305286119936921603 2020-09-14 07:23:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have u tried Ban?
1305286013145710598 2020-09-14 07:23:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sure most of them believe it is no big deal..only after they get it do they learn.
1305285841938505728 2020-09-14 07:22:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Having read most of his books over time..that line surprised me..tho I agreed it was surprising
1305270955367968771 2020-09-14 06:23:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe not calling cops?
1305270740611194880 2020-09-14 06:22:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Lady you are as insane as the rest of trump supporters.. grow a brain this is old and tiring
1305270386892967937 2020-09-14 06:21:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> either fired or still anonymous?
1305270234014724096 2020-09-14 06:20:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all so freaking insane
1305269853155192832 2020-09-14 06:19:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am thinking whatever the GOP or trump says we need to steer it back to who is president and responsible
1305262132473323521 2020-09-14 05:48:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We must have missed something, @GOPChairwoman and @realDonaldTrump  apparently think so..had he been president this could probably have been bad, but not nearly this bad.
1305261784195047424 2020-09-14 05:47:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @JoeBiden  did not lie or slow down tests or play politics with ppe and different states..that is all @realdonaldtrump  @GOPChairwoman  GET YOUR VOTERS TO WEAR MASKS ..have to start somewhere . here and now is a great time! MASKS DO NOT KNOW POLITICAL PARTIES
1305260604781985792 2020-09-14 05:42:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What planet ae you on? @joebiden warned donald, he and President Obama left them instructions what to do in case of a pandemic, they left him a pandemic team..trump ignored it all, fired the team..what are you talking about @GOPChairwoman, also, do not forget TRUMP IS PRES
1305259819797024768 2020-09-14 05:39:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wow what planet is she on?
1305259703837036546 2020-09-14 05:38:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wondering how many more will die in the next two weeks thanks to donald..did the attendees ask their friends and family if getting covid and /or dying would be okay with them
1305244607844884480 2020-09-14 04:38:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he means it..if trump gets in this time he or his family will never be removed
1305243982474219528 2020-09-14 04:36:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why even discuss it?
1305243739586256899 2020-09-14 04:35:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did anyone think he would?

1305243351688585218 2020-09-14 04:33:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is no Q it is a letter of the alphabet ..someone started a rumor and here we are
1305243080602386432 2020-09-14 04:32:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Least they did not start a forest fire
1305242847193575426 2020-09-14 04:31:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> EXCELLENT!!!! ü§£
1305242658978369541 2020-09-14 04:31:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mr trump? lol  Personally I think any Biden grandchildren should be off limits. They did not ask for the microscope
1305242231578726400 2020-09-14 04:29:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only say q people are listening to .Q  is a conspiracy theory who does not exist except in your heads and trump lies a lot. Go look trump up his lies are nonstop
1305241748298518529 2020-09-14 04:27:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anything is possible..hope people are too smart to pay attention to this
1305232667508703239 2020-09-14 03:51:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just have to get them to get on the "right side" (wrong expression i think)  to realize what it is
1305231926941437952 2020-09-14 03:48:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> last thing he gives his fans is peace..he gives them insanity and excuses..they would be bored by peace (they would have that if voted for @JoeBiden  so it would be very unsettling to have to face themselves
1305231527761063944 2020-09-14 03:47:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Republican with a brain..and a unique video
1305229735987949570 2020-09-14 03:39:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that so makes sense
1305228310654447617 2020-09-14 03:34:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He likes anything with his name on it..
1305227000412614657 2020-09-14 03:29:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even if give him real benefit of doubt and it is huge..he has to know covid19 can kill and people at his rallies are set up to get sick or be killed..no excuses
1305209570009190401 2020-09-14 02:19:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> shortages of paper towel and toilet tissue here in nj
1305209459283722243 2020-09-14 02:19:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> depends where you look
1305209294871244800 2020-09-14 02:18:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I found some paper towels..have to wait 2 weeks for delivery and they are top dollar
1305208952318238725 2020-09-14 02:17:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just heard trump denigrating Biden and his sending of unsolicited ballots (that is not Biden doing it just another trump lie)  IT is trump sending mailing that he wants people to think were official..they are not but they have trumps name smeared all over the official looking mai
1305204275333730304 2020-09-14 01:58:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is the one talked about defunding police
1305203880804917249 2020-09-14 01:57:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he did not even realize those Hispanics in Puerto Rico were American citizens
1305203635345920000 2020-09-14 01:56:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is just one more arm of trump ..and just as honest
1305203368311296000 2020-09-14 01:55:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Peter Navarro is not who i want to see on tv..
1305195165792043008 2020-09-14 01:22:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @joebiden need to open headquarters in neighborhoods with signs etc so people can find signs
1305194858915692544 2020-09-14 01:21:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like your name and impeccable logic
1305190081263734784 2020-09-14 01:02:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> At least they got that part right..but same 1/3 are sticking up for someone that does not even care about America. Still dumbfounding
1305189716866854912 2020-09-14 01:00:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is going as far as he is allowed...i just hope he realizes there are fewer fascists then there are Americans
1305189530136449031 2020-09-14 01:00:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> biggest fools of all time.
1305189359348572160 2020-09-14 00:59:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He needed time to rally and golf at that point
1305189177110265856 2020-09-14 00:58:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how many millions they sent that same tweet to
1305188848905879552 2020-09-14 00:57:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> WOW, anything for a dollar...salesmanship? No, CON JOB
1305178649612685313 2020-09-14 00:16:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @marklevinshow  you are either very high, very ill informed or just a moron..go fact check at real sites instead of conspiracy theory sites
1305177040518348802 2020-09-14 00:10:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I still cannot get how they follow so willingly &amp;trust &amp;believe anything he, fox, oan or russia says. So easy to fact check  So easy to see how many republicans are leaving trump..Cannot fathom those that stay and willing to sacrifice themselves to Covid19..just do not get it
1305176437150961666 2020-09-14 00:08:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to any fan of trump who thinks he is joking and would leave peacefully after 4 yrs..you are a complete fool if you think he is kidding
1305175501573627906 2020-09-14 00:04:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @SRuhle @MikeBloomberg @JoeBiden @SRuhle ..wherever @MikeBloomberg is, so is support for @JoeBiden
1305174916392771585 2020-09-14 00:02:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @axios @MikeBloomberg knew you would do something big..can't get much bigger..Thank you
1305174593183920130 2020-09-14 00:00:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad to hear trumps cv19 party tonight will not get its usual coverage..just not safe
1305167417681870849 2020-09-13 23:32:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we are 4% of the worlds population and 25 percent of its corona cases
1305166893137965057 2020-09-13 23:30:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @GOPChairwoman  can you say you honestly believe that? If so you are dumber than a doorknob
1305151843648122885 2020-09-13 22:30:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People want a real President not a bully president
1305151533949034499 2020-09-13 22:29:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope not
1305151246987337729 2020-09-13 22:28:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I will never understand this..  welcome to my covid19 party..come on in. NEVER UNDERSTAND
1305147113492316162 2020-09-13 22:11:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no idea how anyone can trust donald on vaccines he is not a doctor and the doctor he has as advisor is someone that agrees with him..who i think is a radiologist ..sigh
1305146388821442562 2020-09-13 22:08:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he does not even like this country other than for what it can do for him
1305146228007669763 2020-09-13 22:08:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nicely said
1305130389237837825 2020-09-13 21:05:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just one more way to prove how little respect donald has for the military  and honesty and tells us all what comes first in donalds world.
1305130055455121409 2020-09-13 21:03:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Could not think of anything more appropriate than the Vindman brothers as escorts
1305129028463067139 2020-09-13 20:59:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> makes my skin crawl
1305128958875312129 2020-09-13 20:59:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What country do they believe they are in? Since when are dictators and fascists okay in this country? Why does Pirro think it is ok to just listen and let him think it is okay? @realDonaldTrump  YOU ARE JUST A BULLY
1305127820881006593 2020-09-13 20:54:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I cannot believe he gets people to believe this BS
1305127488587264002 2020-09-13 20:53:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does that mean he and his minions are again up to no good or does he mean he knows he should be in prison?
1305126894216544256 2020-09-13 20:51:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when the election is over and @JoeBiden swears allegiance to the Constitution and country, we can send trump, his family and cohorts back to mother Russia with no passport and no need for charges because they will never be permitted to step foot in this country again
1305125529792765953 2020-09-13 20:45:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the sucker and loser is in the white house turning the country and truth upside down
1305125338536697858 2020-09-13 20:45:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then what?
1305125242222841856 2020-09-13 20:44:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> INSANITY
1305125091857104897 2020-09-13 20:44:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope all family and friends were asked if they also wanted to participate in their possible demise or a very uncomfortable sickness.
1305124888588488704 2020-09-13 20:43:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Have no doubt that is what happened and donald knew it, which is why he kept saying he won and denying it could be any other way
1305124128945590274 2020-09-13 20:40:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DonaldJTrumpJr  does that mean you are voting for @JoeBiden  I also prefer a president like that.
1304973059242291200 2020-09-13 10:39:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why are we the ones commenting and yelling at these people to go home when it should be trump telling them masks or go home
1304972851984977921 2020-09-13 10:39:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is soooo idiotic, moronic&amp; just plain stupid..how can anyone believe someone that has lied so often. If only they would look there is so much proof..and yet they are willing to get covid 19 to see him..just wonder if they asked their family if willing to get sick or die 4him
1304972325922758657 2020-09-13 10:37:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no way!!!
1304972207827939333 2020-09-13 10:36:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG and no matter what we give seems like not enough
1304960871928602625 2020-09-13 09:51:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE..one among many thousands
1304960760129507329 2020-09-13 09:51:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is doing what trump does best..and i hope that this is seen by twitter
1304960572916731904 2020-09-13 09:50:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> how is the 2 state solution coming?
1304960467690024960 2020-09-13 09:49:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is what he said and it is not voter fraud because he said so
1304960322554531842 2020-09-13 09:49:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I prefer your name , I just called it a covid19 party, mind if i use yours?
1304958076525649920 2020-09-13 09:40:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> good a reason as any..as long as he does not vote trump is good..cause he was not " My African American" I hurt for him when i heard it
1304956580702683136 2020-09-13 09:34:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what are they all hiding
1304956517884604418 2020-09-13 09:34:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Haven't seen anything to show differently
1304955773248733184 2020-09-13 09:31:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no need for that
1304955585847328769 2020-09-13 09:30:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is maybe one of the best comments I have seen on twitter  in years or maybe of all time
1304955358713131008 2020-09-13 09:29:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòäüòÄ

1304951281786720256 2020-09-13 09:13:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so so glad you are speaking out..

1304950713240485889 2020-09-13 09:11:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she is gonna be tall ..hope she stands up straight and enjoys her height
1304948224462118912 2020-09-13 09:01:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oh yes i will want to miss it..so i will

1304925718242045956 2020-09-13 07:31:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Am so happy for Canada ..hope stays taht way
1304922819395047424 2020-09-13 07:20:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oddly I do not think they are bad people, just addled and feeling they dont belong but being made to feel they will not be controlled as they let trump control them &amp; determine what they can do. It is at a groups expense, not the typical stereotype,can be ended at any second
1304921978495795207 2020-09-13 07:16:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope when she comes down from her high she knows what an arse she looked like
1304921699998224390 2020-09-13 07:15:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is about intimidation and being the boss whichever karen it is
1304910099627077633 2020-09-13 06:29:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ask trump where his are
1304909900234076160 2020-09-13 06:28:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is not the same ..this is done to people who all behave the same way due to donald trump making them believe they are above all..nothing to do with anything else
1304909362603929600 2020-09-13 06:26:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if blue VOTE

1304907456909369346 2020-09-13 06:19:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They stereotype themselves..at first I had to ask what a karen was..but then,I no longer did
1304906862559662080 2020-09-13 06:16:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> how was your grasshopper taco..(that is weird)
1304906426507317249 2020-09-13 06:15:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was he talking to trump?
1304901401533915139 2020-09-13 05:55:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have to wonder if republican heads are so far up their asses they see daylight  through their mouths..cant even believe I said it. I hope this is not offensive to any one except those I typed it too and if it is I hope they will pull their heads out and look around and SPEAK UP
1304900669049122820 2020-09-13 05:52:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is not normal and i am beginning to believe not human either
1304900438983151616 2020-09-13 05:51:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not imploding bigly and badly enough
1304900292379582464 2020-09-13 05:50:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> These days those with covid mentality that believe trump and think he will save them.....................they don't just not think ahead..THEY FREAKING DON'T THINK
1304895727143968768 2020-09-13 05:32:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is so sickening
1304895403435986946 2020-09-13 05:31:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> More trumps people who i see are pretty silent today
1304894946621747207 2020-09-13 05:29:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump fans enjoy life they see nothing wrong, they attack others who do not think as they do, they carry and use rifles..must be enjoyable to them..o wait you said sane
1304894706787155968 2020-09-13 05:28:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The word promise is not what we need to hear. We expect you to do all that you promise because you are a decent man  but you do not need to promise to know you will do what you can for the betterment of this Country. Let trump promise, you do not need to demean yourself
1304893441097302022 2020-09-13 05:23:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What sort of people are these? I am sorry how can you contribute to killing off and hospitalizing  people because your master wants to look good? I am just so dumbfounded and ashamed
1304892410657415169 2020-09-13 05:19:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly so right..yet I thought people in this country were different from ben ladin or qanon
1304891720195280904 2020-09-13 05:16:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waiting
1304888642788364288 2020-09-13 05:04:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching outside rally as they are yelling 4 more years as reporter is saying CDC changed records to match trump.. WHAT  IS WITH THESE PEOPLE
1304881372738314243 2020-09-13 04:35:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but they stand up for pres who breaks rules, knows his fans will die, and has destroyed the constution. WHAT IS THIS INSANITY.
1304881369861033984 2020-09-13 04:35:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does it phase trump supporters that trump told the writer of this book about his new nuclear weapon?  It is all just insane that these people are so blind, deaf and dumb. It is duty as an american patriot to stand up for your country and constitution
1304870734288883712 2020-09-13 03:53:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was a pandemic and still is..and death from this is painful
1304867007578476544 2020-09-13 03:38:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if sanders is trying to help trump ..would not surprise me since I always thought of him as a trump
1304866290402820102 2020-09-13 03:35:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did he say to sweep the forest floor?
1304865408219045890 2020-09-13 03:32:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gosh and I missed them all
1304865184947806208 2020-09-13 03:31:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but, are you THE Steve Martin..if so should mention it
1304864893200457737 2020-09-13 03:30:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Bernie is not running for Pres now Biden is so his choice..and I agree
1304862331839619079 2020-09-13 03:19:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Redistrict more attention he gives to what is going on..more press and trump will make of it so why bother?
1304862026926354432 2020-09-13 03:18:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> totally agree..but hint..much easier to just call him trump, cant call him President or even trump with capital T
1304858293622444040 2020-09-13 03:03:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> who told her it was illegal to insure that customers wear masks? She is as intelligent as all the other karens .. so embarrassing to know so much ignorance and viciousness in this country
1304857862888402950 2020-09-13 03:02:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> karen needs a mask if for no other reason then to muffle her
1304857671691112449 2020-09-13 03:01:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more than a sigh..that is a WOW.
1304857447304224768 2020-09-13 03:00:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice to see everyone in masks
1304857266567426048 2020-09-13 02:59:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> for McConnell, it is too late
1304856882985816065 2020-09-13 02:58:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o gosh poor, poor donald
1304855991331229696 2020-09-13 02:54:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what does trump have around the white house now?
1304855785869017089 2020-09-13 02:53:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is right..trump quivers in Bidens wake because he knows Biden will mop up the floor with him..and Russia does not want  trump. He has been that way for years
1304855388530061314 2020-09-13 02:52:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You forgot to mention with your current CV..American patriot
1304855037974380546 2020-09-13 02:50:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't think I could find a reason to miss it  I am just so sorry for the abuse you were put through
1304843004272877569 2020-09-13 02:03:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe it is not so much of memory or drug maybe it is more he keeps the pages turning so no time for anything to really sink in..unless truly huge
1304842737246666752 2020-09-13 02:02:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> how did i miss that? ..it is disgusting
1304842508556537859 2020-09-13 02:01:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> .Maybe I don't get it but never thought of deadheads as individuals.just groupies..except you of course, you apparently have a brain of your own. Please explain?
1304830975499698181 2020-09-13 01:15:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is trump
1304830725594714112 2020-09-13 01:14:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not understand and I will never stop scratching my head trying to understand it
1304830215613542404 2020-09-13 01:12:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 Trying again..hope you did not see first response..I am not surprised deadheads follow trump..am not surprised you follow Biden/Harris. You are a thinker. So what dumbfounds you that they are?
1304827228887408642 2020-09-13 01:00:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Yeah would be lot of work , probably why trump hasn't tried. But I would be in favor of a Noble (Nobel) for that  As for Norway and Sweden , why didn't I think of that?
1304826659963572224 2020-09-13 00:58:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> dont want him executed but recovery from a case of covid be okay
1304825633978101767 2020-09-13 00:54:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> horrible feeling..and equally as horrible his republicans turn their heads the other way and help him
1304825418088882177 2020-09-13 00:53:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> remember when one of the "believers" walked into a pizzeria with his gun to save children? There were none..was just more conspiracy theories that were take..can you imagine if people got shot..for no reason other than eating pizza?
1304818844784046081 2020-09-13 00:27:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they will recognize what is going on once it affects them..not a second sooner
1304818518379188227 2020-09-13 00:25:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Wharfrat2004 I wonder if Dead ever suspected they would become fans of Biden/Harris?
1304818173687091201 2020-09-13 00:24:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks just like the you i have come to "know"
1304802997659226112 2020-09-12 23:24:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We could get through it together much easier and calmer if only trump said wear a mask
1304802797037277188 2020-09-12 23:23:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He forgot to add -we get thru together until trump and I  makes it the job to divide us..and the base falls for it
1304781294677766144 2020-09-12 21:57:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if there are drugs involved, we know who is using them..is what I hear
1304780887964475393 2020-09-12 21:56:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is a noble cause (he thinks) Advertising for the NOBEL? anything is good for the circus he has created
1304778538017587200 2020-09-12 21:46:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the person in the white house
1304778111276511233 2020-09-12 21:45:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As long as we can get him out it can be fixed. EVERYONE NEEDS TO VOTE BLUE
1304777946905939968 2020-09-12 21:44:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Check with your polling officials to see if it is official. I have my doubts. Looks like another way for trump to  get attention and a vote. Does not make it a legit ballot.
1304776963232595970 2020-09-12 21:40:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wow she now speaks
1304776830025699328 2020-09-12 21:40:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Expected and this has to end
1304776662081568769 2020-09-12 21:39:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/HCUiZVtCff
1304775723282989056 2020-09-12 21:35:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would be impressed and even care if there were  a 2 state solution..but maybe I missed it since the news is on the latest "accomplishments" or -maybe it was not done!
1304613437096501250 2020-09-12 10:50:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is a great show for the intelligentsia? I would rather not be member of that select club
1304613090789675009 2020-09-12 10:49:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sad to be so very afraid and desperate
1304612865156902915 2020-09-12 10:48:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> simple answer...: because it only matters to donald and his cult?
1304610145981394944 2020-09-12 10:37:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have a very great evening
1304610016176082945 2020-09-12 10:37:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and yet one more astute observation today
1304609848278089729 2020-09-12 10:36:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> probably afraid of the ants
1304595374997491712 2020-09-12 09:39:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There are a variety of ways to be  stupid  I would assume it is going to be harder than Biden bargained for because it is so never ending but I know he can handle it.
1304580035635015688 2020-09-12 08:38:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you think about it,he lied about Covid so what would stop him from lying about everything out of his face. Now we know how he got over 20000 lies since got into office. If people want to believe him either you are stupid or you need to fact check to determine for yourself
1304579100531662861 2020-09-12 08:34:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What you know is why trump keeps looking for something on you. Seems all you do is tell the truth. Thank you.
1304570755749994502 2020-09-12 08:01:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> VOTE BLUE ALL DOWN THE LINE
1304570585243152384 2020-09-12 08:00:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I knew they cannot read and do not listen to anything but fox and oan..such insanity ..wonder if all sharing same drugs
1304570321589219329 2020-09-12 07:59:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can't laugh that is disgraceful
1304570231428448257 2020-09-12 07:59:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> mickey mouse is good
1304570055418675200 2020-09-12 07:58:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The Senate could speak up
1304569949369888769 2020-09-12 07:58:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> being thrown out of office
1304569877919870977 2020-09-12 07:57:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did not expect this bad because I did not think this bad would be permitted
1304569543948410882 2020-09-12 07:56:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so sad too..for our country and donald. I knew he would be bad..not this bad
1304569222052360194 2020-09-12 07:55:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Amazingly that is what I hear about the president.
1304569012723081223 2020-09-12 07:54:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am so glad you are there to check this idiocy out

1304568305362100227 2020-09-12 07:51:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we can hope and then another case of donald shooting himself in the foot
1304567936808628224 2020-09-12 07:50:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I was home, UPS man was at the door. I was signing for a package..he said, "they must be filming a movie in the city".they were not

1304543699746127874 2020-09-12 06:13:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Tell the trump believers that this has a lot to do with climate change..they wont believe it

1304515543043649537 2020-09-12 04:21:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> antihumanity
1304513817985024000 2020-09-12 04:15:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think it is a brain problem not intentional
1304500036974321667 2020-09-12 03:20:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> doesn't know words?maybe self conscious?
1304499127141781506 2020-09-12 03:16:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When trump points fingers at others, the fingers point right back to him
1304498918164762627 2020-09-12 03:15:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Luv how trump deflects and projects. Thing is, .he just wants to get attention off of all his huge problems and any drug issues he might have. Wants to change headlines and try to demean @JoeBiden ..but though he can try, trump cant take him down to his own level
1304484323173847045 2020-09-12 02:17:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Congratulations Des Moines Iowa for standing up for what is right

1304481076803514369 2020-09-12 02:04:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Ignore it , it will slither away
1304480920364351489 2020-09-12 02:04:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice job
1304480637701828609 2020-09-12 02:03:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know he is not fit, but isn't the picture on the left one of his sonns?
1304480116735717377 2020-09-12 02:01:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anything is possible but even he must have some limits
1304479802628374528 2020-09-12 01:59:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank goodness for Dr Fauci. Wish I could find his twitter account.  to send a personal thank you and thank him for his honesty
1304479155300569088 2020-09-12 01:57:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> me either..wont forget where or what,  it is etched into my brain..also wont forget how the area I was in all came together like one..and when I compare it to today, if I started crying at the differences, I doubt I could stop
1304478473579311106 2020-09-12 01:54:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> embarassing
1304468822292934662 2020-09-12 01:16:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what else do we expect?
1304468276739796993 2020-09-12 01:14:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thinking back to then ..and now..can only say hope trump is happy..the majority of the county would have preferred what happened and who we were the days following 9/11
1304467536407392257 2020-09-12 01:11:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very well said!!!
1304466985460404225 2020-09-12 01:08:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We dont hold Norwegians responsible. We know what Tybring-Gledde is and we know what the overwhelming majority of Norweigans are..no comparison. You are very kind..and talented
1304465940843823109 2020-09-12 01:04:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump  maybe because of who nominated you and how much you deserve it..it was no big thing
1304462530631413760 2020-09-12 00:51:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wise words bear
1304459643641573379 2020-09-12 00:39:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No way!!!
1304450459822944256 2020-09-12 00:03:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> everything they are doing is bizarre now
1304434752452165634 2020-09-11 23:00:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is right..it never goes away but it does get easier.
1304434437657112583 2020-09-11 22:59:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Strange coincidence about when this started..or just more trump/mnuchin  accounting?
1304432822250360833 2020-09-11 22:53:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not learn what you talk about before you type
1304432269378154499 2020-09-11 22:51:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> From the very start,Covid has been a terrorist but not treated as such
1304431641494986756 2020-09-11 22:48:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so he wants to be noble..but, noble he is not
1304426970969710592 2020-09-11 22:29:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why not just read this and for a change learn something before you open your mouth ..again  https://t.co/d5V4DYt66M
1304425589978341376 2020-09-11 22:24:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't stop shaking my head
1304425290102460416 2020-09-11 22:23:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My God, will anyone ask these fools if they did not hear his voice on those tapes?
1304406968824729600 2020-09-11 21:10:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is a crazy..and people need to recognize she is crazy
1304259962370220032 2020-09-11 11:26:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whenever they get the final election results.............I will collapse and not wake up for a week
1304259696132587520 2020-09-11 11:25:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I try not to think about it
1304259499105177602 2020-09-11 11:24:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Her fathers daughter.. would want proof it is the vaccine and still would not influence me
1304237407651409920 2020-09-11 09:56:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We even deserve a president who is a president
1304236571349188613 2020-09-11 09:53:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did you have a mask?
1304235554813476864 2020-09-11 09:49:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is the invasion
1304234836266291201 2020-09-11 09:46:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee we never would have guessed that trump loves to foment hate and prejudice
1304234034827014144 2020-09-11 09:43:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> she is another that has to go
1304233916165959681 2020-09-11 09:42:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guessing more will be coming
1304233784427061249 2020-09-11 09:42:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure who would you like him to tell..all that genius in one pea brain
1304233576230252576 2020-09-11 09:41:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thoughts will be with the victims and survivors..if you and donald can let us have that time
1304232960141529089 2020-09-11 09:39:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I see masks..some better than none
1304232033535897600 2020-09-11 09:35:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden told you, @realdonaldtrump you ignored it. Stop blaming everyone else
1304230574517882892 2020-09-11 09:29:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has shown that contempt all along..people are just noticing it more now
1304226603933880321 2020-09-11 09:13:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is time for you and others like you to go
1304226044032016384 2020-09-11 09:11:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone should ask him what he would call it if not a lie?
1304225665361809410 2020-09-11 09:10:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @RealJerseyGirl2 @SandiAnthony1 So very sorry Darlene
1304203663414620161 2020-09-11 07:42:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump his showing his love for his base again..sending them out to get sick and maybe die..just wish these fools would ask their families and friends and all those other people they come in contact with if they are also ready to die
1304202103708155915 2020-09-11 07:36:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thought they passed treason long ago
1304201766075084801 2020-09-11 07:35:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i think it should be same as vaccine..trump should fly out on that brand new aircraft first and then take that vaccine
1304193096918466561 2020-09-11 07:00:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> masks are for people who care
1304190681611669513 2020-09-11 06:51:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd ,thought trumps America
1304190389109362699 2020-09-11 06:49:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nope does not want to cause fear or panic people
1304176546605826049 2020-09-11 05:54:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is so much more huge than Nixons coverup. Just wonder how many of those people that trump does not care about even if they are his supporters..asked their families if they care if he sent them out to die too?
1304175945981530112 2020-09-11 05:52:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do any trump supporters realize he thinks so much of you, he sends you out to get corona virus? Have you asked your families if they want to die for him?
1304175726745325569 2020-09-11 05:51:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> lol
1304173074800091138 2020-09-11 05:41:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is  why I want hm to be my President too. I like adult presidents, particularly when they wear  their masks, even if they are not comfortable, just know necessary to slow down COVID
1304168090217992193 2020-09-11 05:21:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> well rounded individual
1304167823632105474 2020-09-11 05:20:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Waited and waited to see the interview..then I missed it.  @joebiden
1304166752926957574 2020-09-11 05:15:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad the guy was caught and has been indicted
1304166607275593728 2020-09-11 05:15:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sir you are the authorities and no one forced you to speak to Bob Woodward. Responsibilities lie with no one but you..nice try
1304160882046504971 2020-09-11 04:52:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump will throw anyone under the bus at any time if it suits his purposes.
1304160683232198657 2020-09-11 04:51:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Will see
1304160358601457675 2020-09-11 04:50:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does it matter that they have Covid ??? That many are most likely miserable? Once over it they can have symptoms and suffer for months? or just that they are not in the hospital?
1304159930883149824 2020-09-11 04:48:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #bidencalm Sounds heavenly after we get through the #trumpstorm
1304158821506482177 2020-09-11 04:44:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish more video I am watching this over and over..soooo sweet
1304157730941394950 2020-09-11 04:40:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not know if someone like that can speak or write well?-me
1304140952769093634 2020-09-11 03:33:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure would not think the Covid19, violence, the struggles, all under trump..and he is still lying
1304140568839311361 2020-09-11 03:31:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> a coward?
1304140419966566403 2020-09-11 03:31:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump just came on for his propaganda and other lies conference
1304139936199737348 2020-09-11 03:29:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does everyone have to be in your political party for you to listen to them? I am an exrepublican and I like @chucktodd
1304139525636132870 2020-09-11 03:27:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> republicans have more than tough reelection races after this..this stunt just ended any chance they had. Don't even have enough sense to understand they were traveling on thin ice before
1304139170290507777 2020-09-11 03:26:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> People need to get that trump admires dictators and dictators do not leave office
1304138880162070532 2020-09-11 03:25:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> IT IS TERRIFYING that his supporters give up their vote and sacrifice themselves and their families to help trump get another term is insane. Wonder if they ask their families how they feel about it?
1304138877456863232 2020-09-11 03:25:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> to make wearing a mask political still amazes me. trump willing to kill off his supporters to keep himself in office is beyond amazing.
1304137676992458753 2020-09-11 03:20:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> let us suddenly believe everything fox says
1304136582853808128 2020-09-11 03:16:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nothing he does or will try to do will surprise me
1304134822454005768 2020-09-11 03:09:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and tried to create alarm about everything else
1304105665489707008 2020-09-11 01:13:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope he is doing well and will have more to say about Covid 19
1304105251344125952 2020-09-11 01:11:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> yikes ..what a darling father ..you do not deserve even that sort of talk @ivankatrump respect yourself
1304103154682822662 2020-09-11 01:03:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant help but wonder if a president that is not high would say everything that was said..
1304102807138643968 2020-09-11 01:01:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÇ
1304086598221541378 2020-09-10 23:57:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Joe Biden is not the president..sure sends a message..of trumps incompetence ..and his issue with color and maybe why he incites..no proud boys in that picture or any other white nationalists who are involved more often than not
1304085460046802944 2020-09-10 23:52:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So what gets done about it?
1304085346666385408 2020-09-10 23:52:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you know how shallow you sound? 190000 dead?
1304085051731304455 2020-09-10 23:51:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> But, like donald trump, Kim Jong Un is in good health.
1304078487800741888 2020-09-10 23:25:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trying to get him to square trying to instill fear with almost every tweet about everything but CV, yet not mentioning CV, so does not instill fear and sense of panic? So confusing
1304057037693870086 2020-09-10 22:00:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> O so valid..maybe those that do not understand will understand this
1304055866178625540 2020-09-10 21:55:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm perhaps I misunderstood and he meant @JoeBiden will turn this mess around
1304055648628473861 2020-09-10 21:54:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is trump reminding us of his wins? I am looking around trying to find them.
1304055438577676289 2020-09-10 21:53:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Amazing if he feels love from anyone..even his base who suddenly realized he threw them out in the wind to fend for themselves. Hard to feel love if someone throws you away encouraging no masks etc to die for a vote
1303879633889263616 2020-09-10 10:15:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> kismet!
1303879363906220043 2020-09-10 10:13:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump was/is knowingly willing to sacrifice , his bases family, friends and even his supporters..what a guy. Do you want to die for trump. He is not the one getting sick, he tests those who get near him
1303878808358055936 2020-09-10 10:11:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So all along,  Lindsey Graham tried to keep the wheels from falling off?
1303878345420156929 2020-09-10 10:09:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I thought everyone told him not to do it
1303876756844277763 2020-09-10 10:03:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so cute!!
1303876626191724544 2020-09-10 10:03:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What gets me is ..he has sacrificed and continues to sacrifice,..his base, their families, their friends  and he just does not care. So trump supporters do you care? Is he worth dying for and suffering for?
1303876253947170816 2020-09-10 10:01:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He will like the publicity you give him. Guess you will be pardoned ..whether any law abiding citizens like it or not
1303876027882577920 2020-09-10 10:00:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because you say it is so does    not make it so
1303875843672997891 2020-09-10 10:00:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ERemlig @gnuman1979 Is there a donkey running around?
1303875687888101377 2020-09-10 09:59:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Try to change the subject..pro life? You let kids in cages die? You let Covid 19 run rampant knowing grandparents, parents and kids will die..PRO LIFE? whose life?
1303875478760062979 2020-09-10 09:58:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Try to change the subject..pro life? You let kids in cages die? You let Covid 19 run rampant knowing grandparents, parents and kids will die..PRO LIFE? whose life?
1303875057782059008 2020-09-10 09:56:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> HE EVEN SACRIFICES HIS SUPPORTERS AND THEIR CHILDREN
1303870800521502721 2020-09-10 09:39:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sadly not..just glad Dr Fauci is not a sell out
1303870593306169346 2020-09-10 09:39:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ah yes  nominated by someone as right wing as himself..what an honor
1303869919264755713 2020-09-10 09:36:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice find..do not eat it
1303869369274040320 2020-09-10 09:34:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aw dont worry folks, its no big deal, no need for masks or anything it will disappear on its own ..that is your current president lying to his base and killing off people including his base
1303869052385976320 2020-09-10 09:33:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no and not likely wait til january
1303868824773627904 2020-09-10 09:32:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> is that little hand a show of white supremacy or just a show of a little hand?
1303868669945155584 2020-09-10 09:31:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all just never ending..but trump is right it is never ending wont end until trump gets some scruples or gets evicted..scruples he wont get
1303848771340709891 2020-09-10 08:12:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> there is no defense for things he has done just excuses
1303848531262869506 2020-09-10 08:11:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If dementia should not be a joke
1303848291260608514 2020-09-10 08:10:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all trumps should shut up
1303848093339856896 2020-09-10 08:09:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Another really sad case ..trump is president his economy is fu*cked
1303847739894181890 2020-09-10 08:08:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You would think the trump children would just sit back and shut up
1303847388612886529 2020-09-10 08:06:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you poor pathetic soul. How many dead? How many in the hospital?  How many still suffering after effects? Sure great ..to know that unlike you and your father..@joebiden did not contribute to the totals
1303840957792690176 2020-09-10 07:41:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he has any brains he will have nightmares tonight
1303840756583596032 2020-09-10 07:40:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pennsylvania is too smart to want 4 more yearss
1303840645073833984 2020-09-10 07:40:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oddly I must have been misinformed. Thought trump was supposed to pay for his own defense.
1303840025109565440 2020-09-10 07:37:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very very sorry
1303839258122346497 2020-09-10 07:34:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> all in  a couple of days and COVID 19 is still killing people, but trump does not mention that..or that he knew how bad covid was in jan and did not discuss it so he would not create a panic..so he went and held rallies and golfed and now we have so many dead&amp; dying..but no panic
1303838038800424963 2020-09-10 07:29:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I bet you the prisoners volunteered ..you are nasty
1303837787641327616 2020-09-10 07:28:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would hope you would talk to the principal
1303808745730867201 2020-09-10 05:33:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and you suddenly want honesty from that white house? He downplayed it so people would vote for him and he kept downplaying it as people died so they would vote for him..he never stopped to think how many people didn't vote because they died
1303803927218073611 2020-09-10 05:14:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DO NOT GIVE UP
1303803280519311368 2020-09-10 05:11:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess that could tell us why Cruz and now a couple others suddenly forgave anything he said
1303803061555560448 2020-09-10 05:10:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> u poor blind fool
1303801859631730692 2020-09-10 05:06:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only say he will say whatever it takes
1303794513429827584 2020-09-10 04:36:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and if he is impeached and ousted has to be way to stop pence from pardoning him
1303794178292355073 2020-09-10 04:35:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or kick him and his gang out on their asses
1303793996431532033 2020-09-10 04:34:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is frightening..but beautiful
1303793855171637249 2020-09-10 04:34:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In light of his wanting to stop testing of those coming from other countries, combined with what he knew even back then..he wanted to be reelected and kill off "weak" people
1303793559326384133 2020-09-10 04:33:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Great so more Covid can come in because trump wants to let it come in ..wonder what his intent is..seems he needs to be removed. Sounds like he wants to save anyone that can withstand it and kill off the rest?
1303793017497833475 2020-09-10 04:30:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/seYlAthNvD   https://t.co/V1lL25k4TT
1303761516764823555 2020-09-10 02:25:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Jesus!!!
1303761011594399744 2020-09-10 02:23:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Doubt it is a maybe
1303757786925486080 2020-09-10 02:10:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They evacuated a town..this is horrifying
1303757260628340739 2020-09-10 02:08:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Watching @JoeBiden -makes such sense
1303743970472845313 2020-09-10 01:15:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @presssec you must get paid some really big bucks..and have no conscience
1303743634815283203 2020-09-10 01:14:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget to include his comments about race that should clinch it if nothing else does
1303742658045767686 2020-09-10 01:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I bet she is scared and you are scared for her. Hope the updates are good ones. Don't give up and tell her daughter not give upüôèüôè either üòä
1303742127726305282 2020-09-10 01:08:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> resign and be pardoned? this needs pardon not given. pence will not do that
1303741831658831874 2020-09-10 01:07:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Shoot another book I need to buy.
1303741549889626112 2020-09-10 01:06:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry,hope your friend pulls through.
1303741273631793153 2020-09-10 01:05:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I doubt the reason was due to panic..more to survival of politics and himself
1303740165740023810 2020-09-10 01:00:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> more contemptible than i imagined
1303739950286999552 2020-09-10 01:00:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder what the real numbers are
1303739669318959106 2020-09-10 00:58:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I had a hunch he knew and I suspect something else too because he knew and did nothing
1303712234980466688 2020-09-09 23:09:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @christiantybringgjed This is trumps america and his white nationalists
1303711837570162690 2020-09-09 23:08:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> US needs people to wear masks.  Until or if we can get to that testing, masks are something people can get involved in and contribute to the health of this country and its people
1303711213734498304 2020-09-09 23:05:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Again trump is trying to show  he is above the law..but what it really shows is how little he thinks of people, even his followers and what a little man and poor leader he is.
1303709612798025729 2020-09-09 22:59:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pictures like this and/or his white nationalist flag waving followers is why I can't put my flag out or even look at a flag without my stomach churning. Until trump I was always proud of this country and flag until I see what trump has turned it into. @joebiden counting on you
1303706877214285829 2020-09-09 22:48:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Well done!
1303705765786587138 2020-09-09 22:44:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What would we expect from any GOP source.Irony is a good word.. Start a war in your own country get nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
1303702320467804160 2020-09-09 22:30:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Been thinking Jim Jones for years-problem was at end last minute, many woke up and decided they did not want to follow jones off the cliff but he did not allow them to change their minds. That was so horrible and you are right now it is here
1303701621210218496 2020-09-09 22:27:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump Yet one more of your lies. But, what I do not get is..do you believe this is all your following is capable of believing. What about real facts? You diminish those who serve(d)now you even diminish your cult following by feeding them lies like you do not think they have real brain
1303701109358440448 2020-09-09 22:25:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Cannot believe that PolitiFact has to waste its time confirming that Biden does not want to abolish any suburbs.Why does trump insist on lying to his following? Does he really think so little of them? Why is this trash permitted?Much more important real stuff to prove or disprove
1303697655701397514 2020-09-09 22:11:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your pbj needs to win. It is difficult to get the 2 to meet in the middle
1303696406557982720 2020-09-09 22:06:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nominate does  not = win.
1303686060652847108 2020-09-09 21:25:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why did trump and his family even into the not to distant past,  buy and/or manufacture so many goods  in China for years?
1303684061702090757 2020-09-09 21:17:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @parscale @JoeBiden  https://t.co/8bUx2sbl6k
1303683467830587398 2020-09-09 21:15:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Political events behind his walls
1303672091611365378 2020-09-09 20:30:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only thing I am sure of is that the entire syndicate does not wish this country well
1303671887789252613 2020-09-09 20:29:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> snarl üò†
1303670292712169478 2020-09-09 20:23:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does anyone know what she is talking about? I suspect she does not know because it does not exist and she is using a trump tactic,"stuff" against the wall and have it stick
1303669810170138624 2020-09-09 20:21:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only hope!
1303669668700401665 2020-09-09 20:20:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Real hope is others on the committee take the nomination seriously,  and realize what they would be doing if they approve as a favor...trump can wear on nerves and some could be intimidated
1303669021536137216 2020-09-09 20:18:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe I am guessing wrong, but thinking Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer are looking out for the interests of the everyday people, not your pals who do just fine
1303667974532931585 2020-09-09 20:14:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Curious to know who these people really are
1303667841972011011 2020-09-09 20:13:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only hope that holds this year.
1303667529957675008 2020-09-09 20:12:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If these are legit protestors it does not help. Question is who are they?
1303667283064168450 2020-09-09 20:11:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I  have suspected the possibility  but then there are NY crimes where pence cannot pardon.
1303666390243651592 2020-09-09 20:07:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can respect law and order, enforce it without creating hate crimes or hate....that is how @JoeBiden does it
1303665770594000901 2020-09-09 20:05:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess good friend..wonder what trump offered if he did it
1303665500124327936 2020-09-09 20:04:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just telling myself nominated does not mean wins. It is a disgrace to  Nobel nominees and recipients past  and present.
1303665105742200834 2020-09-09 20:02:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Often wonder the same. If they insist on making a mockery out of the white house, we should somehow insist on having costs reimbursed.
1303510061935984640 2020-09-09 09:46:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like father like son
1303509682619899905 2020-09-09 09:45:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You can be sure trump is not paying..so first we get zapped with the cost of the convention and then we get zapped with the lawn..double whammy
1303508405424971778 2020-09-09 09:39:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If she is willing to go through all this, well, gee, uh
1303507961961222145 2020-09-09 09:38:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> barr and trump fit together as perfectly as puzzle pieces..not a compliment to either
1303506331605884928 2020-09-09 09:31:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> #TrumpsRadicalRight
1303506199552327681 2020-09-09 09:31:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he just wants to stay out of jail and will do whatever it takes
1303489909337075717 2020-09-09 08:26:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Adorable cover. Really well done..oh and nice autograph too
1303489614892675076 2020-09-09 08:25:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anyone left to vote for him?
1303489305181065222 2020-09-09 08:24:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Good for AstraZeneca to put truth and facts  above trumps temper and foot stomping
1303488752380268544 2020-09-09 08:21:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but President Elect Biden can turn it into a campaign ad
1303488492484194304 2020-09-09 08:20:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> unfreakingbelievable
1303487830820352000 2020-09-09 08:18:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is all unbelievable
1303487666688847873 2020-09-09 08:17:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How can the DOJ defend trump in this? Has to be some way to legally stop it
1303487233966723074 2020-09-09 08:15:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is what I saw and had no chance to read. Sure moved fast glad someone got his
1303486713126416384 2020-09-09 08:13:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at his eyes
1303481051063484416 2020-09-09 07:51:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess truth to the old saying "never trust a junkie" and we trust our lives to him..guess we see where that gets us
1303479510860431361 2020-09-09 07:45:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> She could not have gone to Harvard Law..so pathetic..guess Harvard changed
1303479163567955970 2020-09-09 07:43:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he pulls through and has something else to say

1303467413162336256 2020-09-09 06:57:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sorry taking so long..never could see sense to it
1303467135612616704 2020-09-09 06:55:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Mexico did not pay
1303466417073913862 2020-09-09 06:53:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> should trump and his gang be voted out, fired or whatever, they will need to build new jails to hold them all

1303463953020989441 2020-09-09 06:43:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we are waiting for proof of  the vaccine you are talking about
1303463809533841410 2020-09-09 06:42:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What does handle mean? did not know that DOJ did that too
1303463646631211008 2020-09-09 06:42:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> For all i know there are 2 possibilities..1 they were obeying their republican leader who has told them to do it or, 2 It did not happen. That is why being checked out
1303463226164867078 2020-09-09 06:40:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/zpxEJUhPsr
1303462846341222400 2020-09-09 06:38:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @charliekirk11 were they republicans obeying their president?   https://t.co/eL0D1lTbgd.. of many millions they were caught and will be punished
1303458702532530177 2020-09-09 06:22:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is more understandable that cops don't wear masks than citizens dont. Not saying cops should not wear masks, they should but it is understandable why so often they do not
1303458213904429063 2020-09-09 06:20:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We have all heard him we know it is truth. Why is there so much question??
1303457881333866497 2020-09-09 06:19:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I used to be such a  big supporter of police but now I am just so confused and upset. Seems every cop is on a hair trigger. I know it is not every cop but seems everyone is on a short fuse
1303456865255403523 2020-09-09 06:15:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> armed militia probably get there first
1303439276999348227 2020-09-09 05:05:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LincolnsBible @UROCKlive1 National holiday ? No way. To many would just take a long weekend ..voting should be safe and accessible though
1303437912445513728 2020-09-09 04:59:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if they will tweet out anymore than greetings?
1303436587439714304 2020-09-09 04:54:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> such disrespect of the flag
1303436413220925440 2020-09-09 04:53:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> happy donald? @realDonaldTrump
1303436220408700931 2020-09-09 04:53:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pretty radical you did nothing about Covid for months..definitely radical
1303434942802726918 2020-09-09 04:48:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can't believe how like trump, they disgrace the flag
1303434615332507648 2020-09-09 04:46:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hm wonder if that changes his outlook.
1303434350181183489 2020-09-09 04:45:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did she learn to lie there?
1303434278164889602 2020-09-09 04:45:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @presssec No bottom to your bottom either. Sleep well
1303432765539602436 2020-09-09 04:39:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kaitwyatt so very sorry. Had to be very painful to see and to hear. Thank you for your service and for that of your husband
1303431897553547268 2020-09-09 04:35:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope they all had a good time and think it is worth it
1303431687938998274 2020-09-09 04:35:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> really proud  boys and the rest of trump crud
1303431426851962880 2020-09-09 04:34:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> does donald think all the lies help him?
1303431271134236672 2020-09-09 04:33:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> anyone that cares about family , friends, acquaintances..puts one on when walks out the door
1303430039728463873 2020-09-09 04:28:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> LOL sure
1303422206823870466 2020-09-09 03:57:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then re-implement Obama/Biden rules and regs
1303421990964002816 2020-09-09 03:56:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Unreal!!! Hope all 250000 survive and then do public speaking about what it was like
1303421242951819266 2020-09-09 03:53:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> when trump starts ranting about sending in whoever that is when protestors show up and trump calls them names because he wants people to think he i s talking about peaceful protestors and lefts when it is really rightist trouble makers
1303420850792804353 2020-09-09 03:52:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant sit on polls though..but they give hope
1303418015984373760 2020-09-09 03:40:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope people in those states will look at what has happened to this country and the world ..ignore their biases and use their brains. Look closely and then vote as if this country depends on it. It does and trump does not care about this country he cares about staying out ofjail
1303417298699649024 2020-09-09 03:37:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> then he blames the silent, well behaved protestors
1303417179061321728 2020-09-09 03:37:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they have been doing that for awhile and think no one knows it
1303405974691164160 2020-09-09 02:52:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> o such a liar he is
1303405730557382657 2020-09-09 02:51:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @kerrileewalsh  I did like you until i just learned how ignorant you are.. I hope you and yours stay healthy
1303405499803631616 2020-09-09 02:51:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd I think of it as a big exercise in being stupid
1303402394588413952 2020-09-09 02:38:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not have to announce something to do it.
1303400097456291841 2020-09-09 02:29:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor bear..such a scare
1303398770978295808 2020-09-09 02:24:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure he will
1303398462722105345 2020-09-09 02:23:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> NJ
1303386600957767680 2020-09-09 01:35:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure trump would do that ...LOL
1303386360909303810 2020-09-09 01:34:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he probably thought he was reclining
1303385545335345161 2020-09-09 01:31:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sarah is similar to trump. If she had to tell the truth she would be lost
1303365569941581825 2020-09-09 00:12:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone pays attn to qanon are 51 cards short of a full deck
1303364840170422279 2020-09-09 00:09:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I repeat again..trump is a shmuck
1303364579498524674 2020-09-09 00:08:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is not the normal. We know trump lies a lot and has a really limited vocabulary. His vocabulary only extends to who and what he is  Thank you all military
1303363488744603648 2020-09-09 00:04:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PressSec  what are you talking about?
1303362979656871937 2020-09-09 00:02:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess he does not know what the "high road" is
1303341064015810560 2020-09-08 22:34:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We all know about his fearmongering but I notice it is not so coded anymore.
1303338081450430464 2020-09-08 22:23:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I remember frequently watching you  lie and wondering how you could do it
1303335969727426562 2020-09-08 22:14:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Vote for @JoeBiden it counts as a vote for @JoeBiden , vote for a 3rd party person, it is a vote for donald trump, do not vote, that also is a  trump vote..vote for trump..before you do look carefully at this country and then choose
1303335385934827520 2020-09-08 22:12:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Please keep repeating yourself (Glad you are recovering)
1303334330576646145 2020-09-08 22:08:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> besides being a thief? benefit of doubt-he asked for them knowing they were repros? hm no matter how I work it, it does not say much
1303333792917131264 2020-09-08 22:06:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thinking same but got Mary Trumps was nothing new (so far) just more detail
1303333421478023169 2020-09-08 22:04:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidTheNonBot I started to read expected humor, read the first line stopped laughing. Shame on you. üòá
1303333025934176264 2020-09-08 22:03:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they do not speak english so no idea what is really going on?
1303318516611919872 2020-09-08 21:05:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope you mean you will vote for @JoeBiden with that one vote
1303317923486932992 2020-09-08 21:03:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ProudSocialist @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden maybe you need to look up definitions then look around
1303317743610081282 2020-09-08 21:02:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have said that for so long it is pathetic..glad we agree
1303317610700865536 2020-09-08 21:01:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did not watch do not know..but I know any of his press conferences are just whhhhhine and cheese events,  no sense to watching
1303316980255125504 2020-09-08 20:59:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would have been nice if they just stayed home
1303316586447675393 2020-09-08 20:57:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So true..and we the people who want democracy to thrive and covid to go away are the silent majority. who will be evicting you from our house
1303162226161987584 2020-09-08 10:44:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ok PRESIDENT trump see what you encourage? and the trouble you cause?
1303161941825859584 2020-09-08 10:43:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The guy with the flag one of the troublemakers?
1303161642566529025 2020-09-08 10:42:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This looks  white nationalists trying to get blacks in trouble and cause some more fear and aggravation
1303161034669203458 2020-09-08 10:39:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So easy for trump to lie guess has enough experience at it..but his own team is saying money is missing?  So which is it? Money just disappeared or stopped spending because it was not benefiting?
1303161031397695493 2020-09-08 10:39:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not know which story is true but this is the one I heard. I do not even like trump but I do like facts and truth  https://t.co/kqwEinTsMp
1303156584869232642 2020-09-08 10:21:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gees hope everyone is safe.
1303152677724008453 2020-09-08 10:06:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know because we see, donald lies and his cult swear to it
1303152451856601088 2020-09-08 10:05:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You actually counted? Wasn't there anything else to do?
1303152005712576512 2020-09-08 10:03:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So sorry, shock to the system ..but glad you were there for Rick and the grand kids were not. I think a couple days might be a better idea.
1303149553571463173 2020-09-08 09:53:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I cant fathom having a subject and debating it. i can imagine someone who is his buddy sending him all sorts of topics he can lie through but not a debate..and certainly not winning any debate
1303149201073803264 2020-09-08 09:52:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> jr wants the truth as much as his daddy does..neither know what to do with it
1303149055334395904 2020-09-08 09:52:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not only is @JoeBiden better ,he is a man..unlike trump
1303122442144145409 2020-09-08 08:06:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Goodness It is Joes workers in the USA but Ivanka has to fly overseas to check her dads stock of hats
1303121499369467905 2020-09-08 08:02:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Would like to know which is the factual real story?
1303121079712575490 2020-09-08 08:00:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope he takes the video to the police
1303120894374666242 2020-09-08 08:00:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right wingers who want to blame the "left" but suddenly being exposed who it really is
1303120666242281473 2020-09-08 07:59:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did I hear wrong?I thought that they stopped spending because the money did no good? Made no change in his ratings?
1303120292710146051 2020-09-08 07:57:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because he would be happy if it was brought up? Yet one more news cycle to keep discussing?
1303111373652623360 2020-09-08 07:22:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so not protocol
1303110610490667009 2020-09-08 07:19:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he handled it very respectfully..no need for name calling
1303110103189655553 2020-09-08 07:17:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @francescatututu @donwinslow @jeffmason1 waiting to hear if there is a price to be paid..sure hope not
1303109868493180934 2020-09-08 07:16:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that was beautiful..it is a free country
1303109615668858883 2020-09-08 07:15:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> must drive trump insane(r) when someone disobeys
1303109443555655680 2020-09-08 07:14:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It would be so great if there was an edit button
1303108450419957761 2020-09-08 07:10:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He said he would do to this country what he has done with his businesses..sent a chill down my spine ..and he meant it
1303100356310765569 2020-09-08 06:38:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not think he hates the troops just does not understand anything about anything..ignorant..like the Constitution has no idea what that is
1303099831427239937 2020-09-08 06:36:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have never seen a loon in the wild..just the 2 legged kind
1303099622316011521 2020-09-08 06:35:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Loon comes regularly to visit in NJ
1303099427247271936 2020-09-08 06:34:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660>  https://t.co/Q1GSRmFA0h
1303098802149220353 2020-09-08 06:32:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but that is not how he sees it..he is the owner we are the employees..he does not think he works for us
1303098565061947398 2020-09-08 06:31:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> think it just says what we know..his business so of course his customers
1303097624283803648 2020-09-08 06:27:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would he do anything like that?
1303095202865963009 2020-09-08 06:18:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hate is a big word..waste of time and energy..do however, want him and his cult out of office and in jail for every single crime
1303094474936127488 2020-09-08 06:15:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Very confident walk ..
1303094049725968390 2020-09-08 06:13:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what a picture
1303093888299790338 2020-09-08 06:12:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> proud boys and his other white nationalist groups?
1303093761682083841 2020-09-08 06:12:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never thought of that as a "high road" thought of it more as spoiled child who is not looking out for America, just his supporters

1303082517122166789 2020-09-08 05:27:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump What sort of animal are you donald?
1303082262456565762 2020-09-08 05:26:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would trump do that? Do you really think he cares? He does not want a free world
1303081680115240965 2020-09-08 05:24:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sounds so russian or at the very least propaganda
1303081137296805890 2020-09-08 05:22:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You just need to listen to trump &amp; his cult..They checked when the count was 15 and never checked again. They were told one day it will  miraculously disappear,but you are right, now 6,297,021 &amp;189,122 dead last count.  They are too smart to pay attn .more important listen donald
1303077037683376129 2020-09-08 05:05:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thanks for the reminder I forgot about the Federalist and Daily Caller
1303076560883388416 2020-09-08 05:03:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope the USA will go back to the quality it had in their goods
1303076435687550979 2020-09-08 05:03:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> also most honest no doubt
1303076332805541888 2020-09-08 05:03:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder if there have been masks..but somehowwith all that intelligence in one place..I strongly doubt it
1303071140320096259 2020-09-08 04:42:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do not know why it is being covered
1303065478210949122 2020-09-08 04:19:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> both combined with ignorant
1303065353615011840 2020-09-08 04:19:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor donald ,so insecure
1303065110639005701 2020-09-08 04:18:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Selfish? Nah not him..he just wanted attention is all üòäüòá
1303052282364297216 2020-09-08 03:27:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looking better all the time
1303052139938410497 2020-09-08 03:26:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and probably tell the bartender to cut him off
1303050473218465794 2020-09-08 03:20:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> new jobs? afraid not..
1303050192942436353 2020-09-08 03:19:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> YIKES!!
1303049716767301634 2020-09-08 03:17:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just proves he thinks of this country as one big store or business and why it is so easy to drive it into the ground
1303046945993306114 2020-09-08 03:06:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just heard trump demand an apology from Biden/Harris for their anti vaccine rhetoric. I have the strange feeling either trump is deaf or trying to change topics really quickly. In short trump lied again
1303046617298284544 2020-09-08 03:04:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has his own rules and laws ..haven't you noticed?
1303046421046755329 2020-09-08 03:04:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe I can agree with some of those "Sophisticated friends" Innocent as in has no clue how to run a  government
1303046136505266177 2020-09-08 03:03:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is so jealous of Obama and all he accomplished..you know first black president etc and since trump is so bigoted must be very offensive..that is how he gets in there
1303045727246053377 2020-09-08 03:01:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that has to be sarcasm
1303045630026223616 2020-09-08 03:01:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> might be inclined to agree with many people
1303032527343493126 2020-09-08 02:08:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fearmongers generally are wrong. It is why they try to intimidate others in hopes no one realizes how ignorant they are
1303032123092357120 2020-09-08 02:07:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do know Biden is not stupid so it must translate to (Trump) "not only am I stupid but I am  truly an ignorant person and everyone knows that."
1303031598728785921 2020-09-08 02:05:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not sure OANN is russian funded but is proven fake news
1303031377688961024 2020-09-08 02:04:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what is a little propaganda or outright lies?
1303030827173978113 2020-09-08 02:02:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so glad doggie is out of the car..what sort of nitwit leaves an animal in a car on a summer day
1303030589210210308 2020-09-08 02:01:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @politvidchannel wondering why this "press conference" is still on as he spreads his lies and propaganda
1303029543972876292 2020-09-08 01:57:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and we care why? time for more lies?
1303029350321790976 2020-09-08 01:56:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Just proves bullies are weak. trump is a bully
1303029121925238785 2020-09-08 01:55:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Now who should we believe when we know he has made all the mentioned comments?  Then there is Lt Col A. Vindman who was bullied by trump until he drove him out..because Vindman told the truth. Wow all this respect!
1303025098878787585 2020-09-08 01:39:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> besides being a toady, Mike Pence is also a mind reader?
1303021558248747009 2020-09-08 01:25:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This should be widely shown..she is the one got 2 yr  probation and a fine. It was not donald paid for it (as usual)
1303020926297047042 2020-09-08 01:22:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This was 2016
1303019608388050949 2020-09-08 01:17:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @AmbJohnBolton  you do realize if you write someone in you might as well be voting for trump?
1303015812563972096 2020-09-08 01:02:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is a rather nasty, unfair comment
1303011783851102209 2020-09-08 00:46:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All I can remember is trumps denying that Russia had anything to do with his first election. Remember how loudly, often and frequently he denied it? Remember how many of his supporters denied it. No one could speak about it as he denied it do you remember the Mueller Report?
1303010653247082496 2020-09-08 00:42:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I  second that.
1303010186219708416 2020-09-08 00:40:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Vietnam's economy is largely state-run and can therefore be considered to be following socialist policies.
1303010183912841218 2020-09-08 00:40:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What is an example of socialism?  https://t.co/ehWgXVRrVh The former Soviet Union is an example of a socialist system. ... The country of North Korea is a socialist state, lacking a stock exchange, supporting many social programs, and the economy is state-run.
1303008275257065472 2020-09-08 00:32:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump
1303007634019299332 2020-09-08 00:30:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the same person leading it if he is not tweeting or golfing..no one is home in any event
1303006867124367361 2020-09-08 00:27:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh, so well said.
1302985301774696449 2020-09-07 23:01:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> That is a favorite of his..promise everything give nothing..unless backed into corner. Hope the check did not bounce
1302984560171536384 2020-09-07 22:58:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe he meant he was first before trump
1302982457759858690 2020-09-07 22:50:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> aw nice I was not gonna say that..just mentioned many are part time..thought that was enough..yours is  better thanks
1302981569406263297 2020-09-07 22:46:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> of course trump will give him all sorts of rewards for killing the transgender person ..who if it was trump in danger, would not refuse help from that same transgender person..and yet another duterte dictator showing what a coward trump is.both are bullies  and cowards
1302979117449719809 2020-09-07 22:36:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wondering if they mean trump can outshout and lie the best? Is that winning?
1302967274018615302 2020-09-07 21:49:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> -trump is not a doctor and his "top" official is not tops in science, immunology, or any other field that can tell the difference in what works for antibodies. Why have they been taking orders from donald who agrees with Dr Atlas on opening schools and  is a radiologist.
1302807496176926722 2020-09-07 11:14:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so surprising NOT
1302807262961037312 2020-09-07 11:13:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if true should be headlines so people do not send the info back
1302807051861716999 2020-09-07 11:13:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he looks like his brothers just looks like he hates being there..hope for the kid if they get him away from his parents and siblings
1302794637959102466 2020-09-07 10:23:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just need to investigate..after  someone is found that is independent of justice department  but can convict or do something
1302793646765469696 2020-09-07 10:19:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks like everyone should expect to be bullied or fall in line. Who do you go too? I hope everyone has not gone to the bullying side. I hope victims are not alone..but if I believe what I see on tv it is pretty difficult to believe they are not alone
1302792833930326016 2020-09-07 10:16:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so, someone do something!!!!
1302791879629692932 2020-09-07 10:12:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly need no more confirmations I have heard him say a lot of what he has been accused to have said..glad to see it not being forgotten but so disgusted and tired of knowing it is truth
1302787492605820929 2020-09-07 09:55:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Betting lot more of them out at those protests causing hell..Yup this is trumps america
1302786678046756875 2020-09-07 09:52:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> totally stupid thing to do..so no
1302759954756046849 2020-09-07 08:05:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he admitted to racism then he would have t o admit the truth of what he does and if he did that trump would eviscerate him
1302759043216347137 2020-09-07 08:02:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is why trump is so intent to remain in office..so many legal issues
1302758656837062660 2020-09-07 08:00:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Whatever floats his boat..but who is it?
1302758274308157444 2020-09-07 07:59:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no shock
1302757858271006722 2020-09-07 07:57:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> bet we would find similar groups in the middle of all those violent protests (just a hunch)
1302757433207664640 2020-09-07 07:55:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> donald will get in the way of anything that changes the life he pretends exists
1302757174968561666 2020-09-07 07:54:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> often asked myself that and at the start I found a couple of things..until he stepped on his own toes and blew it. Since then nothing positive.
1302756722176659457 2020-09-07 07:53:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone that does not vote or votes for anyone other than @JoeBiden is voting for trump
1302756372455526400 2020-09-07 07:51:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Steve Jobs would be very proud of his wife. She does not get suckered in by conmen
1302756161331040256 2020-09-07 07:50:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Christians are not following him. christians are
1302755818069266433 2020-09-07 07:49:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hope Biden just cocks his head and stares at him.
1302755375066873861 2020-09-07 07:47:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ugh..so nonbusinesslike
1302731378937782273 2020-09-07 06:12:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If you protest at night and trump has his cult go after you, he wins, you lose even if you sit on the side of the road doing nothing..just go home
1302730980747350023 2020-09-07 06:10:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry about your friends dad. Wear masks and keep distance people
1302730797993144321 2020-09-07 06:10:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÅüòÉ
1302730534989242369 2020-09-07 06:08:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wise words
1302720969363120130 2020-09-07 05:30:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> easier to ask of any statements were true?
1302720472681979904 2020-09-07 05:28:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so sorry ..hope lines woman is ok, also Djokvic
1302720201763491842 2020-09-07 05:27:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Also was not the normal to talk to presidents in a church
1302719807243026432 2020-09-07 05:26:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> matt gaetz is an ignorant fraud and apparently so is someone else
1302719479466655744 2020-09-07 05:25:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He assumes every person is like donald who will do anything for a photo op. Guess he just learned there are trumps then there are actual normal real people
1302711126422097920 2020-09-07 04:51:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Am pretty sure last few days have been tough since he heard about trump. His sons death is still recent
1302710687005896706 2020-09-07 04:50:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is used to donald who is always up for a photo op
1302710386530156545 2020-09-07 04:48:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @FrancisBrennan Why would  he do a press conference there? Rather rude, thoughtless, and just plain inconsiderate of you. He should keep meandering. You should have waited outside the cemetery if you just had to talk to him
1302709516652380161 2020-09-07 04:45:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Don't forget trump rally just ahead of that. Hope everyone is happy
1302708463039066113 2020-09-07 04:41:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @brooklynmutt @realdonaldtrump Is his dictatorial behavior what you want for your president? Do you really think it will be ok or better if reelected?Do you really think he would be happy with just 4 more years. He does not want to go to jail and he does not care about anyone but himself
1302694227109871619 2020-09-07 03:44:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not think these people realize what they are inviting. They think it will get better ..and they are sooooooo wrong only worse no matter what he says
1302693848569843721 2020-09-07 03:43:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you want everyone to ignore facts but I am not one to ignore facts. There are tapes, tweets, videos of him saying a lot of things..How you can not believe it is beyond me
1302688124221509634 2020-09-07 03:20:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump you have no idea what real sacrifice is
1302687634783907840 2020-09-07 03:18:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> glad no one was hurt..nice to see justice is served..you would think his supporters would take a hint..
1302687336317235201 2020-09-07 03:17:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My late husband spent 10 yrs in the Army.  No one I knew thought of him as a loser. We always respected that time and to this day I still do.
1302673764887474179 2020-09-07 02:23:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad Facebook decided it is not suitable
1302662758589177862 2020-09-07 01:39:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cops have more sense
1302662669804228608 2020-09-07 01:39:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why would anyone think barr tells the truth. He is there for trump no one else
1302645645375934469 2020-09-07 00:31:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ignorance
1302645270535196677 2020-09-07 00:30:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what country is she in?
1302645062854156292 2020-09-07 00:29:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I would like to know how many of the 7% included white supremacist types who came in from outside
1302640878847168512 2020-09-07 00:12:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> nice projection
1302640686018318336 2020-09-07 00:11:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> better to golf than govern
1302640114535890944 2020-09-07 00:09:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Right on the money..makes it powerfully horrifying that this wants another 4 years
1302615017368453121 2020-09-06 22:29:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump      Reality is fact based truth...changing reality to fit your personal reality  and your own biases and prejudices is anti-american
1302610411129315328 2020-09-06 22:11:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no way he is 95..
1302610211836960771 2020-09-06 22:10:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has always shuffled money around
1302610060766568448 2020-09-06 22:10:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In order to build a lasting economy first we need to get COVID19 under control .If you cant see that it would have to be the first most important reason to say,  you are not fit for office. You are part of the con game taking place in D.C.
1302609278939922432 2020-09-06 22:07:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly I noticed it long ago. At first I thought imagination in overdrive, then realized it is not
1302594785581117440 2020-09-06 21:09:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump I am sure her husband would be thrilled that she is spending her money so wisely
1302591819776176131 2020-09-06 20:57:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @charliekirk11 Seems she has good taste and a lot of intelligence

1302578125562355712 2020-09-06 20:03:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Palmetto bugs? Not having a good day are you?
1302569371521425408 2020-09-06 19:28:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Looks to me like many of these antifa , agitators, white supremacists are all paid for out of the same pocket. Wish demonstrators would stay home at night
1302568461617504256 2020-09-06 19:24:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Interesting so what gets done about it?
1302568245870972928 2020-09-06 19:24:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> poor baby
1302567857625141248 2020-09-06 19:22:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are the fool and it looks like for whatever reason, you are comfortable assisting in the destruction of this country for a "man" who is just a frightened coward
1302566474154995714 2020-09-06 19:17:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Until the last 24 hours I did not think it could get more bizarre..knew could get worse but this is just bizzare
1302566279128199168 2020-09-06 19:16:16 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He also thinks he is a winner because he can't claim military service..some winner uh?
1302565798469222400 2020-09-06 19:14:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do you not get it ? Do you not want to get it? You and your "family" are destroying this country..it is not the left or the right it is donald and his "family"
1302562941858975744 2020-09-06 19:03:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @LizMair You do not need to be impressed. No one will be perfect. You just need to vote Biden/Harris because any vote to anyone else is a vote for trump.  No vote is a vote for trump. No one is perfect. The very best is Biden/Harris
1302561926170411008 2020-09-06 18:58:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DearAuntCrabby I know I do, been up since  before the " "butt crack of dawn' 2:30 am finally got out of bed.  Hope you get to go back to sleep..but have a great day anyway.

So tired of you blaming everyone for what you are responsible for. Donald this is your doing. And you know what you are doing and why you are doing it
1302436652170858496 2020-09-06 10:41:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> kick a poo joy juice and i wonder why someone that finds it so funny is not taking away the bottle

1302435996236218369 2020-09-06 10:38:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> at least when he said he didn't get it..he told the truth
1302435752656203786 2020-09-06 10:37:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh how time changes things...now the people are embarrassed by donald j trump and nikki haley

1302415649461932032 2020-09-06 09:17:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump uses the methods of hitlers propaganda minister (goebbels ) His theory was if you lie enough times and keep lying..people will believe it. Well people have finally caught on-trump lies about everythig

1302400311194275840 2020-09-06 08:16:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did he take the hint? ü§£
1302400082277433344 2020-09-06 08:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As I listen to trumps diatribe about soldiers who died or pows....what does he say about those that paid to stay out..but never missing or dead.. what should be the general consensus?
1302399268184117248 2020-09-06 08:12:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not a ballot but you might  put in a change of address
1302399002541948929 2020-09-06 08:11:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Blue Wave came down faster than expected
1302388598726103041 2020-09-06 07:30:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You would think country before a person..this is as catastrophic as  them thinking  a man is more important than the country
1302376761167171585 2020-09-06 06:43:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is not funny ..sure makes one wonder
1302376150300323840 2020-09-06 06:40:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> look at that huge photo op
1302376017902829568 2020-09-06 06:40:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what sort of moron is this stable genius? Again he is telling people to go in after mailing in..maybe they should just go to check to see if it was received at local polling location on the phone
1302365488492797952 2020-09-06 05:58:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He does not care about anyone but him. He will use and abuse anyone and when  done with them will send them out to the trash. No one is safe from him
1302364880805257217 2020-09-06 05:55:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @adallos (3 is my favorite unless someone photo shopped the beard)
1302364434506055680 2020-09-06 05:54:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> maybe the owner does his hair too
1302364093031034882 2020-09-06 05:52:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @tomiahonen I agree with him.. he is fired and needs to go
1302362960896106496 2020-09-06 05:48:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @UROCKlive1 @adallos I love 3 because it looks like a painting but it is a real duck with real colors
1302362027478921216 2020-09-06 05:44:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh gosh I thought I missed itüòá
1302361874852392961 2020-09-06 05:44:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Trump supporters who decided bad idea to support him? Or fate playing a hand here
1302356178513653762 2020-09-06 05:21:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is still unacceptable
1302353536156606465 2020-09-06 05:10:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not so sure mentally ill ..just something missing in his DNA or something no one took time to teach him
1302353173412220928 2020-09-06 05:09:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You used to be someone I would pay attention too..but that is used to be
1302352954297593856 2020-09-06 05:08:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am a huge fan of Comey and his honesty even when he is not sure it is the right thing to do
1302352636881104898 2020-09-06 05:07:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984 Glad only an almost

1302343504551702528 2020-09-06 04:31:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @CillizzaCNN so I have a hunch that was tongue in cheek from you so can you clarify?
1302342968804859904 2020-09-06 04:28:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has a reputation for lying and much of what he has said has been on tweet and tv..while I have not heard that about Jeffrey Goldberg...
1302342309644832769 2020-09-06 04:26:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If there is a god I hope @RepThomasMassie runs right into him on his attempt to get into heaven...unless he bypasses the entrance and gets a direct line to hell. Giant economy size bigoted idiot
1302338102275571715 2020-09-06 04:09:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you for what you have done . It cannot be easy no matter how often it is done
1302336802880212992 2020-09-06 04:04:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess trump is right people that do not respect or treat our veterans well ..so time to go donald
1302336296900272134 2020-09-06 04:02:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> naturally..that is considered normal
1302336047897026563 2020-09-06 04:01:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The most disgusting part is they tried to get her to take the blame for her being shot
1302335846226460674 2020-09-06 04:00:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @Trumpet1984 are you sleeping yet?

1302323339810295809 2020-09-06 03:10:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know she spoke truth and fox and cronies did not
1302322547304935425 2020-09-06 03:07:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder if there is anyone that is known for honesty that will get up there and say it is fake?
1302321783685763072 2020-09-06 03:04:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We have all seen it for ourselves ..I gave fox benefit of doubt thought maybe attempt to clean up their act. Guess in one form or another, trump and fox big partners always were trash and always will be..truth is not their friend
1302320289498492929 2020-09-06 02:58:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> family is probably mortified
1302320118584807425 2020-09-06 02:58:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone saying it is trump that is the fascist?
1302319811322576903 2020-09-06 02:56:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Easy explanation..while I could couch everything I say in educated sounding words and phrases.. with trump no need..he is a shmuck
1302319271050084361 2020-09-06 02:54:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Hitlers propaganda minister (goebbels)  believed if you told a lie often enough people believe it..and so does trump

Latimer improved the bulb, made it more user friendly and accessible..to me , that tells me he  invented the bulb we know today and people are losing sight of what this is about   https://t.co/TWVe2PdbPl    https://t.co/rtTjHlbuCF

He even wrote a book in 1890 on electric lighting, the first of its kind. Because of Latimer's contributions, incandescent light bulbs became more affordable and practical, MIT says,.

You are trying to divert attention. why are you still discussing birth certificates now? do not want to discuss  military,that's true too

1302025376215052288 2020-09-05 07:26:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope only his family watches and wish him peace
1302023895759941635 2020-09-05 07:21:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Thank you!!!
1302023819536805891 2020-09-05 07:20:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You are not the losers..you are the patriots who did the right thing..unlike donald
1302023635985666059 2020-09-05 07:19:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He did not get it and did not try to get it
1302023471208296454 2020-09-05 07:19:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He would then become a martyr
1302022083371728903 2020-09-05 07:13:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and then said something about getting help before plan is gutted by trump
1302021709424472064 2020-09-05 07:12:20 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> seems to be
1302014174772580353 2020-09-05 06:42:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does he have a low? Seriously?
1301993809417510912 2020-09-05 05:21:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> fox hm might give them a brownie point
1301979846373978112 2020-09-05 04:25:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> astute observation
1301979649677963265 2020-09-05 04:25:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> long as military has their paper and know trump canceled it then changed his mind is good..trump still scum
1301978480641536000 2020-09-05 04:20:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> if need to comment on S and S..make sure we understand he ordered it closed and now open
1301978110804537344 2020-09-05 04:19:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realDonaldTrump @starsandstripes so glad u used your brain for a change
1301977844931874816 2020-09-05 04:18:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Fox confirms..hm now what donald
1301966887274844162 2020-09-05 03:34:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> "Yup irresponsible rhetoric of our president TRUMP" then there is that classy bunch
1301966494105034754 2020-09-05 03:32:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> eventually reporters will get this is not donald dump
1301966371912286210 2020-09-05 03:32:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sorry Governor...do share your sentiments though
1301965931741089793 2020-09-05 03:30:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Oh I can almost see trump giving a great reason not to meet up.
1301965601443901442 2020-09-05 03:29:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even his kool aid drinkers appear to be drifting away..just not as quickly as I would like..but they are going
1301960476021215234 2020-09-05 03:09:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> still cant see the other foot..wondering if it is help him maintain balance
1301946264318357510 2020-09-05 02:12:33 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DISGUSTING
1301945817759207425 2020-09-05 02:10:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> As long as u mean he thought be a positive for Biden..that was what i expected
1301940467521683457 2020-09-05 01:49:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I said what @joebiden said, never been so upset or angry, it is a disgrace..but then said @realDonaldTrump  if I thought u had some redeeming social value, I no longer think it
1301939305200398340 2020-09-05 01:44:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> oddly enough it is why he should be and will be president..and did you notice he did get noticeably upset over that article, but he did not yell or scream..he stayed quiet and civilized no matter how he felt..What a guy..definitely needs to be president
1301920149671415808 2020-09-05 00:28:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thank you
1301920061670617091 2020-09-05 00:28:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> easy answer trump is president and does not give a fig about the military
1301919483154632704 2020-09-05 00:26:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and now the commander in chief who has no brain decides he knows better than anyone else. and it wont matter he tears down the morale a little bit more
1301919101045145604 2020-09-05 00:24:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is and has been obvious he does not lead them because he can't lead them
1301916789799088128 2020-09-05 00:15:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump did not implement Veterans Choice and I am tired of hearing he does..to many lies to call them all out
1301912295837179904 2020-09-04 23:57:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I can't blame it on ignorance or close my eyes ..or try to be polite ..blithering idiots..allowing trump and his Joanie Ernst types to get away with this trash and outright lies..morons
1301911341763002368 2020-09-04 23:53:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> did not think my opinion could get lower..it did
1301910377224077312 2020-09-04 23:49:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope people are paying attention and will finally hold him responsible
1301909963930038272 2020-09-04 23:48:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He said he dodged the draft because of his feet, but I believe it was his niece or sister told him  his dad said join the military I disown you
1301909051337572352 2020-09-04 23:44:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the loser is donald
1301908173469757440 2020-09-04 23:41:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can only ask what sort of idiots are raised out there?
1301891210810994688 2020-09-04 22:33:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Should be arrested for a lot of things said and done
1301889779873837056 2020-09-04 22:28:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What does trump care? Laws are for everyone but him..he thinks
1301888259279253505 2020-09-04 22:22:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe they are not hypocritical as much as the trumpers that remain are the "losers and suckers"
1301881971677843456 2020-09-04 21:57:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Convenient connected to antifa..so many coincidences in some of these states
1301879316314193921 2020-09-04 21:46:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> feel free  to research, I started you off    https://t.co/R0W3N0834I
1301877467657965569 2020-09-04 21:39:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Gee yet another lie
1301716913094094848 2020-09-04 11:01:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @fishyonekenobi @D_jeneration should have said did not recognize you in dognito
1301711368811405312 2020-09-04 10:39:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I don't understand either just know article had to open up a lot of old wounds again. Sorry
1301711109267873792 2020-09-04 10:38:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @fishyonekenobi @D_jeneration Lol my warped humor you do not look like a Fred ..more  like  a mortimor
1301708438246957057 2020-09-04 10:27:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @MilesTaylorUSA @Wharfrat2004 he is a character but he has no character.
1301707981906685952 2020-09-04 10:25:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @fishyonekenobi @D_jeneration like your incognito ..just cant recognize you
1301707460684775426 2020-09-04 10:23:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Does trump think time to resign? I do
1301702081682776064 2020-09-04 10:02:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and to think McCain fought and was captured to give people like trump the freedom to say this
1301701637963210752 2020-09-04 10:00:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> words are just words until you see them put into action..he is the garbage and we tried to warn all of you
1301701194595827713 2020-09-04 09:58:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Because of trumps so obvious caring looks like a lot of company and that is pathetic
1301700604188921865 2020-09-04 09:56:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump has always said whatever is necessary to get what he wants and achieve what he wants. You are either a great liar or drinking koolaid
1301700301871820801 2020-09-04 09:55:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I do not know how he was elected. The paying to get out of the military was known before elected. I will never understand how the irony of how he could pay to stay out and yet be Commander in Chief
1301699757337968640 2020-09-04 09:53:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sadly, good story
1301699426000478208 2020-09-04 09:51:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump Everyone tried to tell you but you knew better than everyone. I am sorry for you and your kids, you had no idea. Get Barron some help before he is like you
1301698771131260929 2020-09-04 09:49:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Odd the things that always would be normal suddenly have to be spelled out. So sad.
1301680071795761163 2020-09-04 08:34:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pathetic that trump insists on showing his ignorance
1301679911715954689 2020-09-04 08:34:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No idea what he said, I did not hear it in entirety .but it was probably factual
1301679607104536584 2020-09-04 08:32:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Read it and it was worse in entire article
1301679393832607744 2020-09-04 08:32:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> i must be old what is JQNL? besides a flower
1301679217038495751 2020-09-04 08:31:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why watch him? I do not see him nor do I want too
1301671556410740736 2020-09-04 08:00:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> looks like a plane
1301668467712589824 2020-09-04 07:48:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> most pathetic part is he probably does not get it..he would have to be patriotic and pro USA to understand, instead of being pro trump. General Kelly if you see this..I am sorry
1301668116229914627 2020-09-04 07:47:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has lied from the day of his hearings and he got through it..why would he stop now?
1301667957051928576 2020-09-04 07:46:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You worry about Pelosi living down her hair do? What about trump
1301667778143891458 2020-09-04 07:45:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> When they can put her up on the wall in the White House tells me maybe Pelosi (who did take responsibility) was telling the truth about set up
1301666936414142466 2020-09-04 07:42:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pence also has to go he allows alll of this
1301666791555506177 2020-09-04 07:42:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is mimicking russia
1301666196249608192 2020-09-04 07:39:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> can relate and I saw 2 tweets today really did me in
1301666016011968518 2020-09-04 07:38:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @ChrisDJackson @donwinslow @JoeBiden It was not a photo op..that is trumps way not Bidens and he was on several networks  Incidentally, it is goading not goating.
1301665032837750784 2020-09-04 07:35:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonderful! It sounds like a plane..must be a plane
1301664727697940483 2020-09-04 07:33:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He is the loser and maybe if he had served he would not be the sucker. He never served..during draft time he  bought his way out, not 1 time, not 2 times, not 3 ,not 4..but 5?
1301664357454163968 2020-09-04 07:32:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not leading in pa
1301664187458957312 2020-09-04 07:31:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Personally I have always thought that all people should be required to learn English and it should be used in stores, shopping,schools drivers tests, etc
1301663701011963905 2020-09-04 07:29:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> think just about money ..it is what happens when you are friend of trump
1301661929509924864 2020-09-04 07:22:42 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just retweet and spread it Please
1301661673581875202 2020-09-04 07:21:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can only ask what is happening? Are there that many afraid individuals who think that whites will be eradicated so believe it justifies what they do or say?
1301661209226248198 2020-09-04 07:19:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @art_morehouse @CNNPolitics add to the list
1301660992179499008 2020-09-04 07:18:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know trump would do say or do anything
1301660727627915272 2020-09-04 07:17:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Please read..pro or con trump please read
1301653360253243398 2020-09-04 06:48:39 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump   you are the cripple and gimp. You are depressing and disgraceful. Fatty too. You are an embarassment and disgrace and your diseases are much worse than any soldier who was protecting  anyone anywhere.
1301652786719924224 2020-09-04 06:46:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @realdonaldtrump He just never stops disgusting people. This needs to be all over the news.
1301646393149358085 2020-09-04 06:20:58 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @slmalamud Ah, ok thanks ..was hoping I misunderstood. Thanks.
1301639222848294918 2020-09-04 05:52:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Someone who is evicted due to Covid 19 should be helped ..my neighbor rents and her landlord tells me he has not seen rent in a year..now Covid19 is rescuing her and it just not  fair to those that earned the help. The landlord gave her every option and now another reprieve
1301638033117253632 2020-09-04 05:47:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So very sorry for your loss. Maybe you can send your story to your congress person so they can be reminded there are real people affected by trumps politics
1301636507216871424 2020-09-04 05:41:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have seen a lot that hurt , was painful , got my attention and disgusted me. This is trump and his supporters in a nutshell. SOME NEWSPAPER NEEDS TO MAKE IT A HEADLINE I AM FUMING AND FURIOUS
1301636122452385794 2020-09-04 05:40:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Goodness, if abroad, rush to get your absentee ballot
1301635922551865352 2020-09-04 05:39:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Biden went to Kenosha and did not make it political
1301634874089013248 2020-09-04 05:35:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If Biden ever proves to be less than genuine  I will never support a politician again.
1301634071324491776 2020-09-04 05:32:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ok will go back try again
1301633845133967361 2020-09-04 05:31:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @TheMouth1969 @realDonaldTrump @realdonaldtrump LOOK AT THE EYES OF THAT GUY HOLDING THE MANS MOUTH.. you started this ..it is what you foment and you think worthy of wearing a flag? The man he is holding is wearing a mask to protect the likes of him? AND YOU SAY NOTHING
1301633390656073732 2020-09-04 05:29:18 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at the eyes of the grabbing his face..maniacal
1301633266492018688 2020-09-04 05:28:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> geesus christ. And wearing the flag while they do it.!!!! SCUM Would tear off their flags they do not deserve to wear them
1301632546653057025 2020-09-04 05:25:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @rmsylvia tried
1301632441875079173 2020-09-04 05:25:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So so desperate..or is it hard up?
1301632290704044033 2020-09-04 05:24:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All happening in world and all the white house can set up to discuss is a hairdo? tells me Nancy Pelosi told the truth and the white house needs to get back to reality..not get back..start with reality
1301630133774807040 2020-09-04 05:16:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @rmsylvia Heard nothing but sounds like sound of cash register
1301629675987492864 2020-09-04 05:14:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You think I lied when i gave my opinion? odd but okay
1301629310781005824 2020-09-04 05:13:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no idea what you are talking about
1301611629445079040 2020-09-04 04:02:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I am sorry to say it I am sorrier to feel it...but I do not believe a word russia, trump or barr say
1301609558029283334 2020-09-04 03:54:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> what do you think? Check to see if it is real? But anyone can put the name trump anywhere and they do.
1301609019489087489 2020-09-04 03:52:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would be nice but there is the time factor
1301608926388117505 2020-09-04 03:52:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> No presidential debates if it is fox oan etc with softball questions
1301608704178106368 2020-09-04 03:51:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Sure ask him. By now I think your esteemed Adjunct Professor is as confused as the rest of us
1301608474783211521 2020-09-04 03:50:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @svdate @VP you lie..to know trump is know someone who will keep his word if he can and if it benefits him
1301596573898596354 2020-09-04 03:03:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do they really think we do not get what they do?Seriously?
1301589724071628800 2020-09-04 02:35:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This sounds amazing
1301588724074057730 2020-09-04 02:31:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> All these so qualified trumps..just amazing
1301588498709975040 2020-09-04 02:30:55 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So when do you position the screen and position to show victims of Covid  and of those who died
1301587637845852160 2020-09-04 02:27:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump fans will buy that. No VOTE IN NC if you live there
1301586944472870912 2020-09-04 02:24:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they have the right to choose their own leaders ..so not even you
1301583248297013252 2020-09-04 02:10:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> those people really need to show they are Americans not hairbrined jerks and research qanon
1301583043346526210 2020-09-04 02:09:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> huge crowd..10 people?
1301582735094538241 2020-09-04 02:08:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Congratulations..you probably  do not need the reminder but..make sure you vote. üá∫üá∏
1301581463180148737 2020-09-04 02:02:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PressSec  perhaps you should give the truth then no need to try figure it o ut
1301580641675476995 2020-09-04 01:59:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> desperate
1301576929401810945 2020-09-04 01:44:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @pupadhyaya_ @realDonaldTrump
1301576766071373825 2020-09-04 01:44:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> easy for trump to want whatever he wants..but notice, he is not the one doing it or risking his own life or health..easy to put someone else in to amuse him
1301576149609385997 2020-09-04 01:41:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> have also heard he pays blacks to go start trouble
1301575901675749376 2020-09-04 01:40:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you have certainly described his supporters well
1301575630732103682 2020-09-04 01:39:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @PeterAlexander but if meeting privately why are you making it public
1301575524037386243 2020-09-04 01:39:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do not have to worry about what horrid things they will say..
1301572982599450626 2020-09-04 01:29:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I don't care who anyone supports, I do care if they cant tell fact from fiction or cant give a few reasons they support
1301564239551881227 2020-09-04 00:54:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Was not intentional flattery, just intentional truth üòä
1301563759895474178 2020-09-04 00:52:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> are those states where rallies and motorcycle events took place or people from those states went to rallies?
1301563365656014850 2020-09-04 00:51:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder why he has not joined in but then i wonder why he has not asked about bounties or criticized putin
1301562985727561728 2020-09-04 00:49:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> let trump insist and lie..we know the difference and know how desperate he is and how much he wants to change the topic back to himself..so why not just ignore it
1301556550071463942 2020-09-04 00:23:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Not familiar with Mifeprex at all but I am familiar with republicans..so I pay it no mind, except to say for some pregnancy can be life threatening or  always life altering and it should be up to medics to determine what is healthy or not..not to politicians
1301555641446731776 2020-09-04 00:20:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In his eyes it is only fraud if democrats do it...and like everything else he does not get his little fingers dirty if he can avoid it.sends everyone else to do his dirty work
1301555039639605252 2020-09-04 00:17:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My question is why do you give them the satisfaction of seeing themselves here? (I think you are funny, very witty and I dont think you are condescending I think you tell it like you see it (with for good cause, a little arrogance thrown in)
1301554646012628994 2020-09-04 00:16:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess he does not want anyone responding..is another trump  coward
1301554453850599435 2020-09-04 00:15:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> just a shame have to stoop to the level of the trumpers so people can tell the difference
1301554146349326337 2020-09-04 00:14:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> everything about this regime is beyond criminal  and trump knows if he loses his office it will be time for all to pay the piper
1301549220684541959 2020-09-03 23:54:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> hope you will light the candles
1301547372548427776 2020-09-03 23:47:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Love your fun  filled facts!!!!
1301546895962238976 2020-09-03 23:45:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> In January wont say go fly a kite. Will say go fly the American flag with pride
1301546423289294848 2020-09-03 23:43:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is the difference between someone going out there that cares and someone who treats everyone like a deal without respect..and makes it a reality show
1301546186474745857 2020-09-03 23:42:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If he cared about Americans he would not have done all he has done or tried to do. First president I think of as antiamerican
1301540568670048258 2020-09-03 23:20:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> it is sad ..I agree and that is why I decided when trump is gone (inauguration day) and President Biden is in..the flag goes up
1301539980112781315 2020-09-03 23:18:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They say ban political ads a week before but they also say lies are permitted in ads up to that point
1301539282717376512 2020-09-03 23:15:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> To say brutal is putting it mildly.. if only everyone would watch with an open mind not the mind that says it is radical left and lies. Truly is wake up call
1301533165039820802 2020-09-03 22:51:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> My thought
1301532833845047296 2020-09-03 22:49:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DearAuntCrabby If trump and his cronies try it out I would still have doubts
1301532687266652160 2020-09-03 22:49:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> OMG
1301514203434553346 2020-09-03 21:35:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Can't treat as a joke the fact that this administration stupidly wants us to  believe this is truth
1301513655469641730 2020-09-03 21:33:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What happened to thinking for oneself..after seeing evidence, not hearing what trump who only cares about himself wants?
1301510651794395137 2020-09-03 21:21:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I hope we are not going to be surprised by some avid republicans who again change their mind at the polling place.I like to believe republicans are really thinking country over party
1301510315843219456 2020-09-03 21:20:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I just need to see a flag on or off  a pickup and I now wince. I will raise the flag when Pres Biden gets into office
1301509688006258689 2020-09-03 21:17:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He has apparently cooked any numbers and books.. and now he wants to win so I hope people remember that
1301506579573989377 2020-09-03 21:05:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @FranceRsistanc1 @RsAndIs4Biden @JoeBiden @Reuters You really like to help spread that propaganda..only problem for you is except for trumps base who loves to believe fake news..everyone else knows @JoeBiden
1301505947278422022 2020-09-03 21:02:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Country over person is the ultimate show of patriotism.
1301505711415988224 2020-09-03 21:01:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Certainly is BS
1301505574157377536 2020-09-03 21:01:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Do not think 99.9 percent of them even have an idea what social security is
1301336127660531713 2020-09-03 09:48:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> THey just mean truthful
1301335526558007296 2020-09-03 09:45:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> or? did he think we are too stupid to notice?
1301335071832580096 2020-09-03 09:43:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> stood out soon as he said it..wonder if he realized it
1301320695155228672 2020-09-03 08:46:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> don't you mean pea soup shooters?
1301320460941111296 2020-09-03 08:45:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no doubt he would
1301320373015896064 2020-09-03 08:45:28 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I did hear it and if they do that I believe they can be jailed but again trump gets others to do his dirty work for him
1301319708822646787 2020-09-03 08:42:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Campbells is probably loving the free advertising.
1301304721320415233 2020-09-03 07:43:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> DUH he sounds so logical
1301304463802728449 2020-09-03 07:42:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never noticed the resemblance before
1301304109224669184 2020-09-03 07:40:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Isn't that the way the "militia" was dressed when they rolled into towns and caused trouble..but they turned out to be white nationalists, proud boys and more of those groups? etc?
1301303730504110081 2020-09-03 07:39:21 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> either he is crazy or wants us to believe he is to excuse it all
1301302597576519686 2020-09-03 07:34:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he should have been disbarred the day after he got in..but since not ,we can always dis bar barr
1301302144591704066 2020-09-03 07:33:02 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> barr reminds me of trump..truth not friend
1301301812448964611 2020-09-03 07:31:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I read your plan ..and all i could wonder is why trump fought so hard against it and made this so much worse than it had to be.  Thanks @JoeBiden
1301301099673124867 2020-09-03 07:28:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad the Bidens will go,they can relate and are not going to be there for anything other  probably to see how they can help.
1301300320375537670 2020-09-03 07:25:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why would trump try to get his base to vote twice? He would use them to try and cheat..no surprise ..nothing and no one he uses should be a surprise
1301299367761059841 2020-09-03 07:22:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think US administration from trump on down should take the first vaccines under the watchful eye of an independent team to be sure it is the same vaccine that they want to give to the front line workers and common men/women
1301298830516932613 2020-09-03 07:19:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If that vaccine comes out..he would be that cruel..so how many would take it?
1301298456686997504 2020-09-03 07:18:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> forgive me but I can think of a lot of adjectives for trump and nouns too  not one are decent
1301298118760292353 2020-09-03 07:17:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Your words of encouragement are underwhelming..but sure makes it look easy and relaxing
1301273670594244620 2020-09-03 05:39:54 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> What do you think of the CDC press release about end of Oct vaccines..conveniently about election time.
1301270615358427136 2020-09-03 05:27:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that really what he said? No one could be that ignorant. I would not expect him to be in touch with the "lower classes" would expect him t o have some idea of how salaries and incomes work
1301270214760431621 2020-09-03 05:26:10 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It was headlines
1301268645037957121 2020-09-03 05:19:56 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we are not supposed to know that
1301268514565582848 2020-09-03 05:19:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> weknow what this is.  what d u want to do about it when entire government is corrupt. Have to get out and vote
1301268175418544135 2020-09-03 05:18:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is insane
1301267959910989826 2020-09-03 05:17:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Listening to Barr ..gad he lies. Trump must adore him. Saying Antifa people get on planes and fly all over the country after they buy whatever ..to cause damage this is so insane..I do not hear a thing about white nationalists
1301266385755164674 2020-09-03 05:10:57 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> so easy for some to believe lies rather than check for facts..pathetic
1301266019340759040 2020-09-03 05:09:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this is insane. CDC how can you say this? Justify it..without help from trump
1301265699579588611 2020-09-03 05:08:13 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> now they are saying CDC  might have a vaccine by end of october..who the hell believes that or more believes trump will do ANYTHING to win
1301265249937559556 2020-09-03 05:06:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> do men really believe trump sounds strong?
1301265035445010435 2020-09-03 05:05:35 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He said it as a joke but..one never knows where the discussion goes back too
1301247715553275904 2020-09-03 03:56:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He can run against all of them and he will win
1301229369499713538 2020-09-03 02:43:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> guess we can see for ourselves the mental health of @JoeBiden  and @realDonaldTrump
1301229069602881536 2020-09-03 02:42:40 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> coward
1301228971292610560 2020-09-03 02:42:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> would hope that is a joke
1301228456068472832 2020-09-03 02:40:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> ü§£
1301228237549338624 2020-09-03 02:39:22 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Totally enjoyed watching and hearing..even some real humor
1301222557690064897 2020-09-03 02:16:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and why wud you be off the clock if u can find something illegal to do
1301222397195038720 2020-09-03 02:16:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> read the response to someone else who said that
1301222306161852416 2020-09-03 02:15:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You do not get it..can only work overtime if something is going on..something they might create to get that overtime. Maybe you should stop assuming
1301220878240358400 2020-09-03 02:10:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidTheNonBot ü§£ o no doubt

1301205711708454917 2020-09-03 01:09:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> no surprise. This world would change so quickly if fox were gone
1301205265208008706 2020-09-03 01:08:05 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @DavidTheNonBot never would have guessed
1301205155271053312 2020-09-03 01:07:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Nice to see Chris Wallace moderatin
1301180044858011648 2020-09-02 23:27:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Even if your faith is in yourself, you gotta have faith. Nothing to do with God just faith. Maybe check this out:  https://t.co/RNtrno0zjQ
1301175237502005249 2020-09-02 23:08:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is always eager to play make believe..that might get him a vote or two
1301173894297145344 2020-09-02 23:03:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Glad something good did come out of your  illness and associated problems
1301172337933516802 2020-09-02 22:57:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Guess you answered your own question
1301172105950695424 2020-09-02 22:56:19 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Walk, crawl, fly, whatever it takes, VOTE BLUE  VOTE @JoeBiden
1301168195617910785 2020-09-02 22:40:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I have no idea what that was about..understood word towels and whoo whoo, but that was it
1301167531697352704 2020-09-02 22:38:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Is that why they became Nobel Prize winners?
1301148051336245248 2020-09-02 21:20:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> never occurs to any of them that what is wrong for dems is wrong for repubs
1301147513634934786 2020-09-02 21:18:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wonder how DeSantis voters feel?   Is the money worth more than their lives or lives of their families and friends?
1300990515211632641 2020-09-02 10:54:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> but he might come up with a conspiracy theorist name

1300988288992456704 2020-09-02 10:45:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> If I just read twitter support correctly, it should all work now
1300987875694186496 2020-09-02 10:44:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I heard trump likes dr atlas because they agree on far fetched,no idea if true or not but time will tell..where is Dr Fauci?
1300987406150176769 2020-09-02 10:42:23 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I agree, health is not a joke
1300976996672049153 2020-09-02 10:01:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Did she at any time meet with any republican lawmakers and speak with them??

1300957389160615938 2020-09-02 08:43:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> There is no intent to defund police by @JoeBiden . If you have any questions message joe or his team. Learn what is real. Cannot even believe trump is politicking and lying on the white house account. these are trump lies that anyone  can confirm at fact check sites
1300956721763037184 2020-09-02 08:40:27 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> only one who wants to spread the rumor to  defund police is trump

1300920331889184769 2020-09-02 06:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> personal stock like his champagne or hotel
1300920141543362561 2020-09-02 06:15:06 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> @thehill at least he read his name right
1300919739460583424 2020-09-02 06:13:30 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> not likely they were saying thanks
1300918389268008960 2020-09-02 06:08:08 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> rancid would not be there without allowing himself to be there-typical trump toady ..wondering what he was promised

1300893397633425408 2020-09-02 04:28:50 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> cant make fun of someone with mental problems but could if he were faking it
1300893010868264968 2020-09-02 04:27:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he says words..
1300892843997880327 2020-09-02 04:26:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they forgot to change hats
1300888348039536641 2020-09-02 04:08:46 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> how can anyone call themselves a christian and support donald
1300888153184759815 2020-09-02 04:07:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He was the thug in the back of the room dressed in black
1300887437594501127 2020-09-02 04:05:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thugs in black?
1300879615737630724 2020-09-02 03:34:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is THE most stupid, most embarrassing,most selfish, most a lot of things..none complimentary person that has ever been fortunate towalk the earth yet not have a clue what fortunate  means
1300872180474040320 2020-09-02 03:04:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> üòÄüòáüëè
1300871656412459018 2020-09-02 03:02:26 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> they gave the questions or discussion items ahead of time?
1300871500426248193 2020-09-02 03:01:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> He shows no respect for the citizens..as usual donald does what he wants then blames everyone else
1300871178173718529 2020-09-02 03:00:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> So he is saying we do not obeyand that is why so much unemployment? Not covid 19 and risking lives?
1300869165167898626 2020-09-02 02:52:32 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Why not his taxes..perhaps same logic if he does people know what is going on
1300865157493649408 2020-09-02 02:36:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> like to hope without input from or trying to please trump
1300864769516343303 2020-09-02 02:35:04 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Votes have to be a huge blowout no matter what polls say
1300864371661385731 2020-09-02 02:33:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> that is even with all trumps dirty tricks..am sure Biden will expand it..without dirty tricks
1300862560217059328 2020-09-02 02:26:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Pity you cant leave politics out of this
1300862417719758848 2020-09-02 02:25:43 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder how often they start at facebook
1300862300685991937 2020-09-02 02:25:15 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> sure would if i could
1300862031713587200 2020-09-02 02:24:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is nuts
1300847265280659457 2020-09-02 01:25:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> he is correct..he was  by himself and had no plans other than be aggressive
1300846512830926850 2020-09-02 01:22:31 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I like Van Jones, just depends on the day as to what he says. Comments like that are opinions I refuse to let politics stop me from watching what I like and deciding on my own whether someone is sincere or full of it..but that is me
1300845831222898689 2020-09-02 01:19:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Wish they would get trumps mouthpiece (jim jordan) out of the hearings and replace it with people who care about the money and distribution not trump
1300832001348562945 2020-09-02 00:24:52 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> gaslighting? NO IT IS INSANITY
1300831564058812416 2020-09-02 00:23:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How to loot? They tried to get the nut of the plane
1300831319015002113 2020-09-02 00:22:09 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> thanks I needed that @tomiahonen
1300830950323085315 2020-09-02 00:20:41 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> need for trump to stop shrugging Covid off and inventing cures and turn covid back to the scientists and experts as he sits back and just shuts up  while he pretends this is not happening and he can fix it
1300829722620891137 2020-09-02 00:15:48 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> wonder what happens when trump and friends stop propping the stock market up? I can guess
1300824055134720002 2020-09-01 23:53:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This would be Bryan Steil (R) going against what the mayor or gov want so as not to upset donald..has to be political instead of actually caring
1300823419131486209 2020-09-01 23:50:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> You keep supporting trump even when wrong so whatever transpires, since you want to take the credit, will also reflect on you. even though you were not the reason for any peace
1300822923247316994 2020-09-01 23:48:47 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump had nothing to do with why there was help.  Steil is a republican doing what republicans best do for trump
1300822475333406723 2020-09-01 23:47:00 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> The great majority of cops are good but it is not as easy or cut and dried to deal with being good vs dealing with bad cops and their unions
1300822070700527617 2020-09-01 23:45:24 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> we have seen him instigate to let him become the hero ..what is he doing now? He sends in his agents then blames dems and rushes in to pat the police on the head same show, same script, he has done it for years in different scenarios and his supporters dont want to see it
1300821525109575680 2020-09-01 23:43:14 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> you noticed
1300821438597914625 2020-09-01 23:42:53 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> and getting attention for it  and all his lies
1300817905337143296 2020-09-01 23:28:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump is lying through his teeth at the press conference...argh and he really needs to remember he is president now
1300797766180974592 2020-09-01 22:08:49 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> How many were successfully reunited? How many died? How many are still waiting
1300796701846929410 2020-09-01 22:04:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> It is no secret ..anyone with sense sees it.  You apparently ,thank goodness, have sense and as we get closer to elections more will notice it.  VOTE BLUE as you know, anything less is a vote for trump
1300795951565725696 2020-09-01 22:01:37 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> the dark shadow people are those who tell trump when to open and shut his mouth
1300795732035862530 2020-09-01 22:00:44 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Look at those eyes..he needs some help
1300787755585282052 2020-09-01 21:29:03 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> was from June1  and I guess trump liked it so took the story and made it his own (or tried)
1300787142768066560 2020-09-01 21:26:36 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Anyone mention this is an old tweet?  trump is trying to cause more problems, like he has not created enough?
1300785803078053888 2020-09-01 21:21:17 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> We know that trump likes to create trouble so he can ride in on his white horse to save everyone. I can put nothing passed him since I have seen him as capable of so much
1300785331181060098 2020-09-01 21:19:25 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> trump and dhs is trying to strong arm Mayor Wheeler from Portland
1300784911805284359 2020-09-01 21:17:45 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Maybe trump is jealous of Booker like he is of Obama-both more accomplished than he is
1300784435323908097 2020-09-01 21:15:51 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> were you there? do you know what happened or just what makes for the sleazy attention you and daddy want

1300776173073567744 2020-09-01 20:43:01 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think donald is afraid..terrified even of a couple things. What applies here is he is afraid he will be the only white face left in the world
1300775536709570561 2020-09-01 20:40:29 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> Such a considerate young lady
1300775320723881986 2020-09-01 20:39:38 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> This is what happens when everyone glad hands donald and gives permission to do and say outlandish things and no one says NO
1300774960563191810 2020-09-01 20:38:12 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> They were employees of donald out on assignment?
1300602162762993664 2020-09-01 09:11:34 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> pathetic
1300601814509854720 2020-09-01 09:10:11 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> I think he seriously needs to check into Walter Reed
1300589465614856192 2020-09-01 08:21:07 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> this did not teach me
1300588426803261442 2020-09-01 08:16:59 +0800 <Mitzi62891660> why dont you go to the emergency room?
