1325137530371547138 2020-11-08 02:06:21 +0800 <teej_matthews> @harmil_art I am unfamiliar with this emotion, it's very suspicious 🤔
1324808380540661762 2020-11-07 04:18:26 +0800 <teej_matthews> If you're looking for some top-notch _flow_ gameplay to sooth you through these extremely rough days, then this is worth your bucks 🧩⏳
1323597671362400257 2020-11-03 20:07:30 +0800 <teej_matthews> @emilyjessturner This is extremely what we needed today
1322615353189564416 2020-11-01 03:04:07 +0800 <teej_matthews> Extremely jarring to watch depressing death stats in the Gov briefing, whilst simultaneously tons of fireworks going off outside

1318985960198111238 2020-10-22 02:42:13 +0800 <teej_matthews> Good to have this talk going on as Tory MPs just voted ideologically to let UK children go hungry over the winter. It's basely a principle of inhumane priorities.
1318985959023824900 2020-10-22 02:42:12 +0800 <teej_matthews> Currently watching this and ongoingly depressed at just how fundamentally and economically _easy_ it would be for the Tories to actually support lives and wellbeing across the UK. @arise_festival  https://t.co/9UOFOWwYLk

1315570262004371457 2020-10-12 16:29:27 +0800 <teej_matthews> @harmil_art This really sucks. I had a similar experience asking for an Asperger's test; unless I could prove that my brain being like how it always has been is very detrimental to my work or social life (jury's out there) then there's no path to diagnosis. What private options are there?

I both reject the gender binary but also acknowledge that my attraction to others does differ depending on gender identity?? but hey sexuality is a big ol' paradox anyways! And it's all valid as heck 🏳️‍🌈🤷‍♀️✨
1308753053944815623 2020-09-23 21:00:18 +0800 <teej_matthews> @harmil_art It's to signal a full surrender to the rainbow. I for one welcome our new queer overlords 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
