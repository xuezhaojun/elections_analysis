In first salon, they took temps, wore masks, distanced people in different aisles 6' apart.  In 2nd salon, a neighborhood one, I was the only client.  Masked. Tipped well.

1306686180021342208 2020-09-18 04:07:17 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @DropsOJupiter7 @MaureennKelly There are so many dog walkers in Seattle, I wear mine walking our dogs.  Not enough room to socially distance in our neighborhood.
1306684466018922496 2020-09-18 04:00:28 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @tribelaw Tell that to my mother and her generation who were interned during WWII.

Xi told him personally the virus and airborne. Xi did not talk to Fauci. He did not want to tell the public the hard truths. He acted like a cheerleader, not a leader.

1304831976839417856 2020-09-13 01:19:20 +0800 <cindyinchaos> It's dark outside in Seattle but nothing like those terrifying photos of dark orange skies in SF.  Stay safe out there, folks. Another reason to use the defense production act for N95 mask that are still not available to us nonessential people.
1304828807048654849 2020-09-13 01:06:44 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @SanaLopRod @GhoulSecurity My friend in San Diego has a go bag ready. I was thinking of somewhere less urban, more rural, a little less expensive.  Stay safe out there.
1304675664163823619 2020-09-12 14:58:12 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @GenMhayden @cryborg I never heard his comment.  But I'm on the west coast, and he did not matter on that day of all days. I numbly went to work, after contacting my parents and brothers, monitored the news, and tried to comprehend the enormity of the tragedies in NY, PA, and DC.
1304672461879820289 2020-09-12 14:45:29 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @KyleClark And McConnell and the GOP want to shield corporations from liability.  Seems like they're already protected.
1304671569872973824 2020-09-12 14:41:56 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @SanaLopRod @GhoulSecurity Thank you, but I'm 50 miles from the nearest fire in western Washington and separated from it by steel and concrete, not by trees and brush. These fires have me rethinking my future relocation plans, though.  Have to factor in the effects of climate change
1304667191673942018 2020-09-12 14:24:32 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @GhoulSecurity OMG!  I hope he will be okay.  Fires have to be contained but ultimately, my house can be replaced.  He can't.
1304571881215803392 2020-09-12 08:05:48 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @JoeBiden @CorporatePiggie And Washington's worst, too.  Probably Oregon's also.
1304571221862879233 2020-09-12 08:03:11 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @JoeBiden @Buck_Bucklin Worse.  He promoted disinformation that is still resulting in unnecessary deaths.

If he wrote an article without the other corroborating interviews he conducted and other documentation he collected, it might have been another 24-h "fake news" cycle.
1303809824350707713 2020-09-10 05:37:40 +0800 <cindyinchaos> @educated_educ8r My dad served in the National Guard, Army, Army Security Agency, and National Security Agency.  He served in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.  He died 5 years ago.  I miss him.  #WeRespectOurVets

1303795282191069185 2020-09-10 04:39:53 +0800 <cindyinchaos> You do not avoid panic by downplaying a threat.  You get the facts out to mitigate the threat.  You organize the country to confront the threat.  You lead NOT lie.  #TrumpResignNow
