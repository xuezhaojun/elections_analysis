1341735724060725249 2020-12-23 21:21:39 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> Finally we have a representative who explains the convoluted process, thank you @AOC
1337813917779845123 2020-12-13 01:37:48 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> Blows my mind that so many Republican representatives would go against the voters who they're supposed to represent and ignore the election results #DiscourseIsDead
1337263577711964162 2020-12-11 13:10:56 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @MikeWhalen108 This didn't age well, kind of like 2020
1337128223398916098 2020-12-11 04:13:05 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash It looks like those 28 million "missing" ballots are not actually missing but just uncast (means that they were not filled out or not returned). RealClearPolitics actually posted an article in May after yours came out in April to clear up the issue  https://t.co/oO6Fa6UU1P
1337124369898876937 2020-12-11 03:57:47 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash I understand your point that keeping your beliefs to yourself is best, but not everyone feels that way and I think people can do their job professionally and still have their own political affiliations. I wouldn't mind if a Trump supporter handles my mail in ballot(country&gt;party)
1337082977583583235 2020-12-11 01:13:18 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash For union's conflict of interest, those are just workers who like Biden's policies more. If you are stating that they would throw away Trump ballots, is there any evidence of this? If Trump told his supporters to vote in-person &amp; by mail, maybe he would have gotten more votes?
1337082020602781697 2020-12-11 01:09:30 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash Can you send me your sources for your missing of millions of ballots claim? Also, the USPS is an independent agency and was founded to provide mail to citizens "door to door" which is one of the reasons their operating cost is so high. (1/2)
1336419074545504257 2020-12-09 05:15:11 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash  https://t.co/NFS4gwa9SH  Why make it harder for people to vote? This article was from August.
1336418879803977732 2020-12-09 05:14:25 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash Each state has their own way of counting mail in votes and not every state was a disaster. Also, many people knew that mail in ballots were going to be higher than normal because of COVID-19. It was a clusterfuck because Trump blocked  postal service funding. (see below)
1336103065112469504 2020-12-08 08:19:28 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash I agree that nobody wants errors, but humans are unfortunately prone to this, so as long as we can track it, we can fix it. Not sure about the software glitches (Hillary did a bad job of using it in 2016). What do you think is a better way to count ballots to ensure no fraud?
1336045895352201216 2020-12-08 04:32:18 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @ChiddyCash It was corrected after the clerical mistake and Biden won by more than 400,000. Why trust some random tweet from Arizona Informer?  https://t.co/ZKehc6eOZH
1334685736411557895 2020-12-04 10:27:31 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> Counting votes is still proving to be too difficult for some people #Election2020results #TrumpIsLyingToYou
1334293091445071872 2020-12-03 08:27:17 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> Thank you @polarisaus for spending 4,074 minutes with me this year on @Spotify. You are my #1. #2020Wrapped  https://t.co/hjl50Bt1xS
1329784398938509314 2020-11-20 21:51:21 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> A president that can't take a loss. Shameful, I hope he knows this will be his legacy along with a bunch of other horrible things.

1324444934645186560 2020-11-06 04:14:14 +0800 <Tommy_got_em> @Mal_Cottonballs even funnier part is that maybe if the President had actually told his supporters to use mail in ballots, Biden wouldn't be getting all of these votes at the end. It's almost as if giving people more options to vote helps get more votes #WhoWouldHaveThought #CountEveryLegalVote
