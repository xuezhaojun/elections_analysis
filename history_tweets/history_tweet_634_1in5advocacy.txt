1336278075299012609 2020-12-08 19:54:54 +0800 <1in5advocacy> Critical note prior to article: I do NOT believe dyslexia requires “cure”—it requires awareness, identification, appropriate education, acceptance. Some extraordinary people are bringing awareness now—@JessicaSimpson, @RashanAGary—this #moms4fAPfE is deeply grateful to each.  1/

Wow.

1315683005839609864 2020-10-12 23:57:27 +0800 <1in5advocacy> @SenKamalaHarris Excellent! The Affordable Care Act should be repealed and replaced to correct the current failures. Just like the grossly flawed #IDEA that’s negligently overdue for revision, reauthorization and FULL FUNDING. #moms4FAPE

1306572576970412035 2020-09-17 20:35:51 +0800 <1in5advocacy> @alexanderrusso It’s the way ed “journalists” cont to ignore public schools’ inability to teach reading/writing/arithmetic proficiency to EACH student—neurotypical &amp; non-neurotypical. @ehanford’s award-winning work should be front page, mainstream, print/digital/cable.
