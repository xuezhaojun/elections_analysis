1343609942117404674 2020-12-29 01:29:07 +0800 <Gelert9> @IAmBased420 China incentivising European brain drain =/= looking out for European interests. It does not benefit Europeans to be exploited refugees in China, it does benefit the CCP though which is why the theory makes sense. Nothing Striker said insinuated anything different.
1343586171465723905 2020-12-28 23:54:40 +0800 <Gelert9> @thuletide How is this Sinophylic? He's not saying it's good to be exploited refugees at the mercy of the CCP, just that it would be a smart strategy for China to take advantage of a European brain drain as it descends into shit.

Love for all equates to love for non, I potty your children.
1338996468947038208 2020-12-16 07:56:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ If Britain is not exclusive to British people, then British people will cease to exist before long. Such a statement is true of any people in any land.
1338996367507791883 2020-12-16 07:56:26 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ At the end of the day "indigenous" doesn't matter, how far we can trace our ancestry doesn't matter; what matters is that maintaining the British people benefited my ancestors, it benefited me and I will be damned if I let it be stolen from my children.
1338996199618179075 2020-12-16 07:55:45 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ The more sentimental, however, can content themselves knowing that the empire brought civilisation, medicine, technology and stability to countless millions across the globe. you suggest poverty and genocide, I'd like to hear some examples.
1338996165380104192 2020-12-16 07:55:37 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ The empire should be nothing but a point of pride for any Briton, it was the crowning achievement of our people, for no other reason than the enriching of ourselves should we praise ourselves for it .
1338995910139895808 2020-12-16 07:54:36 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ This people has resisted significant change for over a millennium and has produced the most ingenious and successful people on the planet, it is no benefit to our descendants to deprive them of a country exclusive to them.
1338995804439277568 2020-12-16 07:54:11 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ The Brythonic/Goidelic Celts, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings make up the modern British phenotype and even then the majority of British genetics comes from the Neolithic settlers of over 12,000 years ago.
1338995731483553792 2020-12-16 07:53:54 +0800 <Gelert9> @SarahOwen_ One can look into the history of any people and dissect them into their ancient component parts, the usefulness of such is only to confuse and alienate people from their heritage instead of letting them accept, learn from and find unity in their shared history.

1338771665279389696 2020-12-15 17:03:32 +0800 <Gelert9> @AlecWilletts @OwenJones84 If I defend my house by fighting off looters, will you, being averse to violence, burn down my house so I have nothing to protect and the looters have nothing to steal? What you call "racism" is just people interested in defending the people most precious to them.

Is it not also rightfuly interesting that any criticism or attempt to resist such an organisation publicly results in being labelled "anti-semite"?

1334875396224012289 2020-12-04 23:01:09 +0800 <Gelert9> @SueWhitaker11 What does "could" mean in this context? A murderer claiming asylum flips a coin and if it's heads he's allowed in? If this was substantive we could say that 'murderers and rapists WILL be barred from claiming asylum'. This double edged language is lying through omission.

Again your great great great grandmother only makes up 1/12 of your DNA by your reconing that's less than my 1/10 SH builder DNA. Ridiculous right?
1328744111977926662 2020-11-18 00:57:37 +0800 <Gelert9> @HumanRi56 @GordonJBarclay @Tess_Machling @urbanprehisto I like all Eurasians are a hybrid of Neanderthal and Homo-Sapien. My relation with Britons from 3000BC, however, is much more intimate. Whereas Neanderthal DNA is common to all Eurasia, from ~40000 y/a, the SH builders DNA is exclusive to modern Britons. 1/10 is not insignificant
1328730062003314689 2020-11-18 00:01:48 +0800 <Gelert9> @HumanRi56 @GordonJBarclay @Tess_Machling @urbanprehisto I didn't defend the KKK I gave context to their formation.

The link affirms that the construction at stone henge was performed both before and after beaker culture. It also affirms a 1/10 share of British genetics, proving a strong relationship to modern Britons.

Construction persisted between ~3000BC-2000BC so the builders of such would have been of both pre-beaker culture and post-beaker culture societies.

You can't have "white" cultures without white people as such a thing is a result of the subtle genetic temperaments unique to whites.

Perhaps you should re-examine all the evil stuff said about Nazi Germany when it was used to retroactively justify a useless war.

White minorities in non-white countries get genocided. The less exclusively British spaces, the less British people. Any policy promoting the destruction of such spaces is genocide.

The death penalty is effective, murder, pedophilia, rape, treason, these are unforgivable crimes that cannot be allowed and are only decisively beaten with capital punishment.
1326186145982668806 2020-11-10 23:33:11 +0800 <Gelert9> @FurySaucer My understanding is that the method is to promote immunity in stronger healthy people around the vulnerable by using vaccinations so they are never directly exposed. The more vulnerable one is, the more likely they are to contract the virus introduced by a vaccine.

They betrayed the soviets to save Eastern Europe from them; the Baltic states, Romania, Finland, even non-German Poland.

If I truly hated trans people I'd encourage them to go through with GRS, knowing they'd likely commit suicide from it. I don't believe the deluded should have free reign to disfigure their bodies, no.

If you say you feel like the opposite sex there is nothing many psychiatrists can do but direct you to GRS.

If your friend is better of with the inverse then good for them, though aside from data and studies my personal feelings are ultimately of pity.

If society holds no standard for itself it will suffer for it and it's most in need will be neglected by the compassionate people who could have intervened, that is what you advocate.

To be intersex is, at the best to have a slight hormone imbalance such as with XXX chromosome people and at worst to be completely infertile such as with Klinefelter syndrome.

It seems much more a product of deep seated issues then a cause of extra ones. It also acts as an unhealthy fixation bound to fail upon GRS.

I guess I'm just a compassionate idiot. What "cure" increases the suicide rate? How does it solve "gender" dicomfort?
1322503091179130880 2020-10-31 19:38:02 +0800 <Gelert9> @AliceRoscoe @abigiles21 That doesn't change the fact that in most western countries trans people have the social power to shame and vilify any who reject, or even accidently miss-label ,them.

It's disgusting should a government start treating serious self-destructive mental illness as normal healthy behaviour.
1322496964043440133 2020-10-31 19:13:41 +0800 <Gelert9> @AliceRoscoe @abigiles21 If by "help" you mean encouragement to delve deeper into their delusion then yes, as post-op statistics show, suicides greatly increase. In real life a phone call from a trans person could mean one's job, I don't think you understand just how much power these people really have.
1322484197823569920 2020-10-31 18:22:57 +0800 <Gelert9> @AliceRoscoe @abigiles21 I know of no place where trans people are refused total accommodation. In my experience people are mostly terrified of offending a trans person considering how delicate they are. The "help" you speak of only increases the suicide rate, only de-transitioning has proven effective.

1322232683574005760 2020-10-31 01:43:32 +0800 <Gelert9> @TanithK @jeanniejuno @Variety The Saxons and Vikings didn't just genocide the Brythonic population, they came in relatively small numbers and represented more of a shift of power between warlords than an actual ethnic replacement. Much like the Normans who failed completely to leave a genetic footprint.

The Anglo-Saxon migration can be seen in present day British DNA, but it's extent "clearly exclud[es] the possibility of long-term Saxon replacement."
1322229990595928064 2020-10-31 01:32:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @TanithK @jeanniejuno @Variety The more Figures like Arthur are Africanized the more black kids can identify, and so the less white kids can identify in turn. Thank you for agreeing with me that the race indeed does stand  as an obstacle for English children to enjoy the character.
1322229839894614019 2020-10-31 01:32:14 +0800 <Gelert9> @TanithK @jeanniejuno @Variety There are British citizens who are born in England who are black, they are not ethnically English and therefor, not English. Peoples aren't defined by a government issued piece of laminated card.

I ignored that to make the more substantive point that in fact the hypothetical king Arthur does share an ethnic connection to the English people, as ironic as the nomenclature may be.

For an English boy to look to heroes of his people for inspiration, in history or legend, and see a black king Arthur is oppressive of his ethnic identity.

Or will they accept they have no history exclusive to their own people? This is to destroy their ethnic and cultural identity.  https://t.co/CuCyOG72ud

It is very dangerous to convince the modern English Audience that they have no undisputed history in their own homeland.
1322212479926181895 2020-10-31 00:23:15 +0800 <Gelert9> @TanithK @jeanniejuno @Variety The more English history is portrayed in such a way, the less people will respect the historical significance that England at the time was almost completely ethnically English.

1316757386334482433 2020-10-15 23:06:39 +0800 <Gelert9> @DevonshireDanUK @thisislaurat As long as establishment safe positions like that Fox is presenting are promoted over our actual message, people who would otherwise have been with us all the way will instead think they don't have to make the commitment and go with the easier alternative available instead.
1316755891593637890 2020-10-15 23:00:43 +0800 <Gelert9> @DevonshireDanUK @thisislaurat Still a bad deal. we aren't going to get into a better position by accepting slightly less bad deals, that's just appeasing those too squeamish to conduct real political action. Unless we get our untarnished message out then our movement will never get past these gatekeepers.
1316594062548500480 2020-10-15 12:17:40 +0800 <Gelert9> @TheJBear The drum is pretty unwieldy and requires a guide rail to fix in place, in a pinch one could just open the breech and throw in a round instead of fumbling for a full reload.Then again, what situation are you in where you need a full auto shot gun but a single shell reload will do?
1316322081911562242 2020-10-14 18:16:55 +0800 <Gelert9> @KarlThorburn The media advertises sex, not healthy relationships. Many people are demoralised from it when they realise the world isn't 'sex in the city' and are given no alternative sexual lifestyle except to become gay. "settling down" has been made into such an off-putting term to many.
1315830575702437890 2020-10-13 09:43:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @thisislaurat It's often a non committed dismissal such as : "that's a conspiracy theory, but you must be a real Nazi for thinking that's a bad thing."
1315278405055713287 2020-10-11 21:09:43 +0800 <Gelert9> @AnEnglishGent1 English "culture" is a bit of a red flag. Culture instead of people is often used to bait the more squeamish nationalists away from proper racial activism. See 'Britain first'. It's only one step away from "we're not racists, honest, please give us  a platform".

It is very rational to fear the knock-on effects of tolerating sexual perversion and so is technically not a "phobia",claiming such is assuming there is no rational opposition to your outlook,rather bigoted

I think the real argument should be the protections for domestic business being stronger in an internal economy than allowing wanton foreign investers to buyout critical industry.

The Romans ruled longer and they, like the Normans, left only trace genetic impact. Britain is mostly Celtic.

What good can any immigrant do if your people are not there to see it? It is the night of arrogance to believe Ireland is immune to demographic shift and replacement.
1310875917808545793 2020-09-29 17:35:48 +0800 <Gelert9> @greenbhoy65 @whitescapegoat @Diane_Ihirwe In the past the Irish have been a remarkably fertile people. If they continue with the trend of other white countries of declining births and increased immigration that will change. You struggled for centuries to have your own country and now you want to give it away again.
1310842431538106368 2020-09-29 15:22:44 +0800 <Gelert9> @greenbhoy65 @whitescapegoat @Diane_Ihirwe You believed it was hypocritical for a white New Zealander to defend Irish identity because his people are not natives. You've shown you recognise native rights, just not for the Irish by using this reasoning to defend an African calling themselves Irish. Yours is the hypocrisy.

Find real anthropologists claiming that. I would very much like to know where you are pulling this "WASPism" from. You're just trying to cover your own blunder with accusations now.

There is no conflict in saying blacks can't be Irish. Your argument comes to a convoluted "I know you're a hypocrite but what am I?" game.

There is no conflict saying an African isn't Irish while being a white New Zealander. There would be if he was claiming to be Maori, but he isn't, that'd be as dumb as an African calling themselves Irish.

1310601279786356737 2020-09-28 23:24:29 +0800 <Gelert9> @Hipferd @ClaireWhyTed @Diane_Ihirwe Is it to the benefit of the Irish people when employers are fined for not meeting the diversity quota? When schools recieve lower scores for being too white? When non-Irish are allowed their own racial advocacy groups but the Irish aren't?

When governments proactively support policy that excludes whites in the name of diversity they will see their power and numbers decreased. I used "killed" in a metaphor, but the end result of these policies is nothing less than genocide.

I don't care if it's done at the point of a gun or through policy excluding whites from work and education or crime increasing exponentially with migrants.

A French family having lived in England for three generations is indistinguishable from an English one and have a shared interest with native English. A Pakistani family keeps to it's own people and creates an enclave, petitioning for racial privilage.
1310554430425759745 2020-09-28 20:18:19 +0800 <Gelert9> @PatAlternative I don't see much point playing the "they were worse" game. Blacks enslaved themselves and we profited from it. If we had intervened and stopped them we'd be accused of destroying their culture with evil colonialism. We were the best, they will always be jealous of us.

Whites, who are able to be integrated pose no threat when taken in small amounts. A non white immigrant population will collectivise and try to wrestle away power for their own benefit everytime.

What is the point of excluding nigerians if it's just to be replaced by Poles? When Immigration is allowed, however, immigrants who are more alike to the natives will have a much better chance integrating painlessly.

1304498133905309698 2020-09-12 03:12:46 +0800 <Gelert9> @labor_national 4 million put back to work and wages didn't tank. The reorganization of the German economy with labour based currency is one of the most obfuscated economic policies purely because it removes speculative leech financiers from taking a cut.

1304276239570661377 2020-09-11 12:31:02 +0800 <Gelert9> @pinochetbelle I find comfort when sad. The sadder I am the greater the potential happiness I am capable of. If one is less than the other the greater will lack the contrast to be fully appreciated.
1304233951762972672 2020-09-11 09:43:00 +0800 <Gelert9> @labor_national Heterosexuals are easier to trust and motivate to action because they are the ones with children at risk of suffering if they lose their job or get reduced pay or die on the job from shitty conditions. A homosexual ,without that motivation, will suck up to the employer every time
1304184566979203072 2020-09-11 06:26:46 +0800 <Gelert9> @labor_national @RandomWhtDude The reason Jesus opposed the Pharisees was because they followed the Talmud, referred to in the Bible as the traditions of the elders. Jesus saw it for what it was, a misanthropic subversion of the word of god to justify bullying Judeans into their racket.

1303722928522043392 2020-09-09 23:52:22 +0800 <Gelert9> @_sam1906 These and policy like them drive Natives out leaving less and less space exclusive to them.
1303722621427740673 2020-09-09 23:51:09 +0800 <Gelert9> @_sam1906 Policy forces employers and institutions of education to give preference to non-Britons. Police refuse to apply the same standards to other races so Britons are at greater risk of victimization. More migrants drive down wages and drive up house prices.

1303702229740912640 2020-09-09 22:30:07 +0800 <Gelert9> @GeorgeCuper @newmoo41 More people=more demand for jobs. You see the greater problem but are selective with the inherant underlying facets. I agree much reform is needed, but how can one accomplish that when jobs are becoming more scarce, housing more expensive and healthcare more and more spread thin?
1303700755325517832 2020-09-09 22:24:16 +0800 <Gelert9> @Cinaed6 @kastanada @newmoo41 The immigrant is the weapon of the capitalist elite to strip the British worker of any leverage they may have. It is much harder to form an effective union when you have no homogenous community to support you and your comrades. You are a bourgeoisie stooge for defending them.
1303696183869747201 2020-09-09 22:06:06 +0800 <Gelert9> @GeorgeCuper @newmoo41 It's a little difficult to fight corruption and injustice if you are ethnicly cleansed from your own country

We only have Britain. Undercutting the British worker with infinite scabs is oppression.
1303335819659313152 2020-09-08 22:14:08 +0800 <Gelert9> @AustraliaFair_ @maaark1991 If you understand that a right to life is only earned by those with the will to take it, the best way to ensure that right for your people is to gain advantage and use it or it will inevitably be used against you by those without such scruples of arbitrary morality.
1303193538805616640 2020-09-08 12:48:46 +0800 <Gelert9> @RichardDawkins If one says their curry is too "spicy" it's unlikely people are going to look around bemused and ask, "like cumen? Why is that a problem?". Words having shared meaning reliant on context stops our language becoming bloated and allows more nuance for those putting the effort in.

1301514339732664321 2020-09-03 21:36:14 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 When it comes to being faced with a legitimate standard of evidence you are backed into a corner, this is disapointing, if you can't compromise on one small suspect piece of circumstantial evidence then you were never coming to this with an objective outlook.
1301513466944139265 2020-09-03 21:32:46 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 The fact you wont admit how easily staged such a photo can be, not just leaving it and going onto actual pictures of actual shootings into actual mass graves excavated ager the war, shows you are incapable of compromising on such a large and complicated topic.
1301511871766425600 2020-09-03 21:26:25 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Sorry if I offended you, please, prove me wrong. You respond condesendingly with sardonic emojis and shit all through this discussion and I hit you with a jab or two and suddenly i'm the one making up for a lack of substance? I'll welcome it if you want to be gentlemen about this
1301510450857693185 2020-09-03 21:20:47 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Then you can come back and explain how they could do what you ask of them when the holocaust had been put under Judicial notice before their trials. To deny or offer evidence against was not a valid defence and so a death sentence if they tried.
1301510311606988800 2020-09-03 21:20:13 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 We've already put the legitimacy of the trials under question if you want to pursue a line suggesting these men were not under any duress.
1301510256867106816 2020-09-03 21:20:00 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Is this the same Raul Hillberg who testified under oath that there was no scientific evidence for the gas chambers? That hundred of men had been sent to death over a case with not a shred of scientific fact behind it? Simply based on the word of the Soviets, Poles and Jews?
1301510197060534272 2020-09-03 21:19:46 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Did Hille take the pictures himself or did he find them? The fact that the Soviet Czech government magics up some prime propaganda without any evidence of authenticity is highly suspect.
1301510135366459395 2020-09-03 21:19:31 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 You have yet to provide an appropriate provinance for these photos. Some questions that should be asked before this is considered solid evidence. Did this HIlle exist? What was the nature of the confiscation?
1301510045910421505 2020-09-03 21:19:10 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Of what significance would those hypotheticals be? I don't think i have ever seen an NKVD execution photo but the soviet archives lay bare most of their crimes without any real motive for lying. Please refrain from strawmanning me.
1301509938565521410 2020-09-03 21:18:44 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 It's like arguing with an athiest on who is primary in the trinity. I don't believe the narrative so you can't use it as a crutch to make weak evidence stronger.
1301509737691795458 2020-09-03 21:17:57 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 I see no evidence that those women are dead. You need to prove the photo shows killings, you need to prove it's authenticity yet you keep saying it's true because it aligns with a narrative I don't respect in the first place so how do you expect me to be conviced?
1301509524340301824 2020-09-03 21:17:06 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 That little niggling in the back of your head is called cognitive dissodence, it's probably the only reason you are still engaging with me.
1301509396938264576 2020-09-03 21:16:35 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 This is not hard evidence. I can find you pictures of people being shot into mass graves but you are dying on this hill because your standards of evidence are so bad and you respect the narrative so fantatically that you wont even entertain the thought of even a mistake.
1301508770477072385 2020-09-03 21:14:06 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Your evidence is vague, reliant on a narrative to bias the viewer and circumstantial. I don't "know" these things in the same way you don't "know" them. You think it is true because you already believe the narrative, your logic is working ass backwards.
1301409703650525185 2020-09-03 14:40:27 +0800 <Gelert9> @ghost_wales @LKingelot Sorry, If Boris can't stop the navy and RNLI from bringing migrants here and accidentally housing them in 5* hotels I don't think the British people should vote for him in the polls. He is either weak or complicit, and we're being taken advantages of because of it.
1301405241741643777 2020-09-03 14:22:43 +0800 <Gelert9> @guardian Everyday I hear about black issues, never native British issues of which there is myriad.Methinks 3% of the population fighting for an even bigger voice isn't for recognition but to drown out others being negatively effected by being forced to tolerate these people in our country
1301399545318912008 2020-09-03 14:00:05 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 still waiting on the source for the pie chart.
1301399275360976896 2020-09-03 13:59:00 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 you expect me to make the same assumptions about vague photographs because you see it all in the context of an already accepted narrative. I don't accept the narrative so your standard of evidence will have to be a little higher than hoping i just take your word.
1301398351921983489 2020-09-03 13:55:20 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 All this was supposed to slam dunk my claim about stupidly inneficient execution methods, so do you actualy admit by arguing this point that the official narrative on gas chambers is as logistically ridiculous as common sense dictates?
1301397746872655872 2020-09-03 13:52:56 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 The photo, as i just pointed out, does not support your killing narrative. Evidence is supposed to suport narrative not the other way around. Just because one lie is consistent with another does not mean they are both true.
1301397469675347972 2020-09-03 13:51:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @romboidram @powerm1985 Point out the source, were these found in some Einsatzgruppen album or something? How many propaganda offices did it go through before it was catalogued in the offical narrative? The earliest source i see is the Instytut Pamieci Narodowej. No further provinance is given.
1301196961698193411 2020-09-03 00:35:05 +0800 <Gelert9> @p13tobler Great! Now we can help Romania's unemployed even more!
1301122435148902400 2020-09-02 19:38:56 +0800 <Gelert9> @PrisonPlanet @WiseOldQueen The organization may be fake but a couple black trump supporters doesn't erase the fact blacks will come out in mass to loot, rape, kill and destroy during any civil disruption.
1301118458466390017 2020-09-02 19:23:08 +0800 <Gelert9> @jdpoc The BUF was anti-war, not pro Germany, they protested and agitated, never sabotaged. Men of the BUF died at Dunkirk, Normandy beach, Caen and Anzio just like any any other British soldier.
1301027235399380993 2020-09-02 13:20:39 +0800 <Gelert9> @NickKristof If Rittenhouse is the benchmark for rightwing violence then I think I can safely say this is bunk. Lo and behold reading the CSIS report it seems the cases of "right wing violence" are defined and catalogued in the loosest and vaguest way possible to bump up the scary numbers.
1301007861686956032 2020-09-02 12:03:40 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 It's unfortunate this had to come to such a petty level. I hope you can come to reconsider my position. Goodnight.
1300989470045605900 2020-09-02 10:50:35 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 We argued the objective facts presented and you lost on every point, playing the semantics game when I made a point of clearly hashing out your definition of colonialism. All thinking is subjective, my aim in using it was to find truth not ease some imaginary burden.
1300988868943130624 2020-09-02 10:48:12 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Are you trying to impress me by saying this? You fail to maintain definitions in discourse, flip flop between talking points to project your morality, mischaracterise my points and now you're the big internet tough guy because I made you butt hurt. Grow up, I don't care.
1300987346062639109 2020-09-02 10:42:09 +0800 <Gelert9> @EuropeanRevolt Don't accept their loaded language in the discourse, throw it back at them with it's real implicit meaning.  e.g.Racism= excuse to humiliate, dehumanise and dispossess whites of their rights.Diversity=excuse to ethnically cleanse and force whites out of education and employment.
1300986170202099714 2020-09-02 10:37:28 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Because you "can't accept that kind of thinking" you will be surprised when you are strung up by those who can. You have admitted your morality precludes such thoughts and so you have chosen to remain ignorant tough guy.
1300972250930327553 2020-09-02 09:42:10 +0800 <Gelert9> @powerm1985 Some actual substance on the topic would be greatly appreciated. This is childish school yard back and forth.
1300970819221426177 2020-09-02 09:36:28 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 You are limited by your precious sensibilities so that you cannot view history in context, thus you cannot learn from it and will quickly find yourself as vulnerable and at the mercy of those barbaric forces which care not for sensibilities as those people who opposed the Khans.
1300884664542998528 2020-09-02 03:54:07 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 You're strawmanning me. I care that colonialism but the British people as the benefactors of the world strategic hegemony. I don't care if it helped others, that doesn't change the fact it did. Modern international policy is not colonial policy. I won't repeat myself anymore.
1300882578598252552 2020-09-02 03:45:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Not done be colonialism. You are calling any interventionalism colonialism now. You are ignoring our previous definition.
1300882326252126208 2020-09-02 03:44:50 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 You're hiding in semantics now. We hammered out a very solid definition for your idea of colonialism and now it's turned into any form of international influence "per se".
1300881705545461761 2020-09-02 03:42:22 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Are you saying today's governments are skin to those during the majout colonial periods? I don't think this is responsible government. For someone so opposed to communists you love their anti-colonialist propaganda.
1300880212805267457 2020-09-02 03:36:26 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 "Cradle of civilization" doesn't mean shit after 100bc. Give me an example.
1300879836743962625 2020-09-02 03:34:56 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 So you agree, It wasn't colonialism which brought communism to China, it was de-colonialized western meddling.
1300879321771446272 2020-09-02 03:32:54 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Just because a culture is ancient doesn't mean it's compatible with a responsible civilized government, in fact it usually precludes it from such. I don't think you know what the customs of those ancients were if you defend them so much.
1300878650393362432 2020-09-02 03:30:14 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Again, only after western support of Mao and pressuring of ChianKaiShek, the problem wasn't our subjugating them, it was leaving a power vacuum. I know it was never colonized, you brought it up as an example of your definition of colonialism we just hammered out.
1300878090625863681 2020-09-02 03:28:00 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 When the whole country is infested with Thugee, ethno religious genocides and human sacrifice you need to strap a few rabble rousers to cannons and blow them across a parade square to civilize people. The sort of practices those "genocided" cultures espoused were barbaric.
1300877469797490689 2020-09-02 03:25:32 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 You've been drinking Indian nationalists cool aid. Most things done by colonial powers to India are only barbaric out of context.
1300876213087621131 2020-09-02 03:20:32 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 China was capable after it's upteenth self genocide. Look up the boxer and failing rebellions and then tell me European intervention did only damage in civilizing and bringing long term stability.
1300875505831419913 2020-09-02 03:17:44 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Also be explicit with the damage you feel outweighs this tech transfer which brought some stone age peoples into the modern world.
1300874996068253696 2020-09-02 03:15:42 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Colonies* not dominoes
1300874682414096384 2020-09-02 03:14:28 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 Colonial yokes*
1300874341127778304 2020-09-02 03:13:06 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 But you must respect that those put under colonial holes were not capable of civilized responsible government. The fact so many ex-colonial nations were so suseptible to communist subversion to be effectively dominoes of the USSR or CCP shows that.
1300873694751985664 2020-09-02 03:10:32 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 If you are defining colonialism as the doctrine of ruling other alien peoples to the benefit of your overlord nation then ok. I can respect that one would be uncomfortable with their fate in the hands of foreigners.
1300871690457624581 2020-09-02 03:02:34 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 So you admit it did good before?
1300871386592837638 2020-09-02 03:01:22 +0800 <Gelert9> @badnickname @anglospergFB14 @BritNatAdam_ Churchill starving India is a malicious twisting of history. It originates from the overall strategic plan to concentrate war material for victory in the western front before focusing on the eastern theatre. Obviously because how could India hold out if Britain was invaded?

It was the decolonisation which opened the power vacuum for communist radicals.

Vietnam wouldn't have fallen to the Viet Minh if McArthur allowed the British and French to reinstate colonial rule.
