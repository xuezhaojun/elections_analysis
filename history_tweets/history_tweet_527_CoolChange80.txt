1325279584795979778 2020-11-08 11:30:50 +0800 <CoolChange80> Mitt Romney still believes that he will be the GOP Nominee in 2024 .
1325278891167113218 2020-11-08 11:28:04 +0800 <CoolChange80> @Scottieterrier Bad things in my life happen under Donald Trump 's presidency , most of which was not Trump 's fault .
1325278442087182337 2020-11-08 11:26:17 +0800 <CoolChange80> @Thinky2020 I voted for Donald Trump Twice , but my life has been more unhappy under Donald Trump . It is not largely Donald Trump 's fault .
1325276245110697985 2020-11-08 11:17:33 +0800 <CoolChange80> I hate Barack Obama , but my life was better under Barack Obama than it was under Donald Trump .
1325275783108104192 2020-11-08 11:15:43 +0800 <CoolChange80> There is voter fraud in almost every election  like there is holding almost every play in football .

1325243919563694080 2020-11-08 09:09:06 +0800 <CoolChange80> Sarah Palin is way better than Nikki Haley and Ted Cruz .
1325243338195410945 2020-11-08 09:06:48 +0800 <CoolChange80> @AbelWolfen810 My point is they conned Trump supporters . There was never any Blexit . It was obvious .
1325242391650070533 2020-11-08 09:03:02 +0800 <CoolChange80> @nypost I'll take Sarah Palin instead ,
1325125640757129221 2020-11-08 01:19:07 +0800 <CoolChange80> @AnnetteGH86 @TheMarkPantano How about that Blexit ?  Newt Gingrich 's predictions like Trump was going to win Georgia by 8 points .
1325124958977077249 2020-11-08 01:16:24 +0800 <CoolChange80> Blexit Was A Grift For People Like Candace Owens .
1325124736943345664 2020-11-08 01:15:31 +0800 <CoolChange80> So many Grifters and full of shit people that should never be believed .  I was always Cynical of them .
1325124028860952576 2020-11-08 01:12:42 +0800 <CoolChange80> Candace Owens , Diamond and Silk  , and Newt Gingrich Should Never Be On TV Again .
1325123840809168898 2020-11-08 01:11:57 +0800 <CoolChange80> Candace Owens and Diamond and Silk Laughed All The To The Bank .  There Was No Blexit  As I Accurately Predicted For Years .
1325122588650074115 2020-11-08 01:06:59 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano But Newt Gingrich assured us that Donald Trump was going to win Georgia by 8 pts and over 300 electoral votes . If Newt Gingrich is predicting you to win over 300 electoral votes then you are guaranteed to lose the election. See Romney and now Trump .
1325122020061769729 2020-11-08 01:04:43 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano What was the plan ? Fill the Administration with worthless Bush machine hacks and pander to blacks for 4 years for nothing while losing ground with White Men .
1325086825069875202 2020-11-07 22:44:52 +0800 <CoolChange80> I told people for 2 years now if they owned property in Georgia , they should sell it .  Florida and Tennessee are better options .
1324893913153462276 2020-11-07 09:58:18 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn I'm actually blocked by Donald Trump and I voted for him Twice .

1324874459992428545 2020-11-07 08:41:00 +0800 <CoolChange80> Joe Biden himself bragged about having “the most extensive and inclusive VOTER FRAUD organization” in history. He wasn't lying .
1324874402962546693 2020-11-07 08:40:47 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn Joe Biden himself bragged about having “the most extensive and inclusive VOTER FRAUD organization” in history. He wasn't lying .
1324873947104604161 2020-11-07 08:38:58 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn Endless Black Pandering By Trump And He Went Up Only 1% With The Black Vote  And Looks To Have Not Won 30 Something Percent Black Georgia .
1324873512448876551 2020-11-07 08:37:14 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn Donald Trump Always Tweeted And Touted The Lowest Black Unemployment Rate In History ,  While Neglecting The White Man .  Never Anything On The White Male Unemployment Rate .
1324872788025413640 2020-11-07 08:34:22 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn I said on Twitter many times that it would be White Voters that decide if Donald Trump is re-elected and it looks like white voters , specifically white men said no .
1324872200491573248 2020-11-07 08:32:02 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn The election was stolen from Donald Trump  and the Supreme Court will do nothing about it .  Amy Coney Barrett , Kavanaugh , Gorsuch , Thomas , and Alito could save Trump  but I doubt they will . We know John Roberts will throw Trump in the ash heap of history .
1324871465204912130 2020-11-07 08:29:06 +0800 <CoolChange80> Donald Trump Spent 4 Years Pandering To Blacks While Losing Ground With White Males . My Brother Voted For Joe Biden ,  He Said Things Have Sucked Under Trump .
1324870870368718849 2020-11-07 08:26:45 +0800 <CoolChange80> 6 states plus North Carolina were probably won by Donald Trump , but are going to be stolen and he can't do jack shit about it . That's where we stand .
1324870403655933952 2020-11-07 08:24:53 +0800 <CoolChange80> It is pretty much over for Donald Trump ,  there is no way in hell the Supreme Court will give him a lifeline . Maybe if he had the lead in Georgia and Arizona .
1324870052450013184 2020-11-07 08:23:30 +0800 <CoolChange80> Trump is trailing in 6 key states . He needs to win at least 3 of them plus North Carolina . If he had the lead in Georgia and Arizona , then he might have a better leg to stand on with the courts .
1324756043939926017 2020-11-07 00:50:28 +0800 <CoolChange80> I'm Going To Take A Break For A Couple Of Days . This Election Hell Is Giving Me Terrible Stomach Pains . I Don't Want To Have A Heart Attack Or Ulcer At 39 .
1324755142575534081 2020-11-07 00:46:53 +0800 <CoolChange80> I Was Right About The Black Vote And Trump Losing Ground With Whites .
1324754499223855105 2020-11-07 00:44:20 +0800 <CoolChange80> @kyleraccio Exactly .
1324753996700127232 2020-11-07 00:42:20 +0800 <CoolChange80> AMERICA IS NO BETTER   THAN ZIMBABWE OR NICARAGUA
1324752267468283906 2020-11-07 00:35:27 +0800 <CoolChange80> @kyleraccio No Republican will ever win the White House . America is South Africa .
1324751091108642819 2020-11-07 00:30:47 +0800 <CoolChange80> AMERICA SHOULD BE VERY AFRAID OF WHAT IS COMING . THE 2020S  WILL BE THE WORST DECADE AMERICA HAS FACED AND THAT INCLUDES THE CIVIL WAR , WWII , AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION . AMERICA SURVIVED THOSE .

1324748464861945856 2020-11-07 00:20:21 +0800 <CoolChange80> AMERICA  IS NOT A DEAD COUNTRY WALKING AS I SAID IN THE PAST .   AMERICA  IS A DEAD COUNTRY .  AMERICA IS A DEAD COUNTRY !

1324747387127189507 2020-11-07 00:16:04 +0800 <CoolChange80> TRUMP PANDERED TO BLACKS  AND  IT TURNED OUT THAT BLACKS WOULD BE THE ONES COMMITTING THE VOTER FRAUD FOR JOE BIDEN  .

1324048145479852040 2020-11-05 01:57:32 +0800 <CoolChange80> @OpinionsMiOwn The 2020s are going to be absolute hell for America and 2020 is just the beginning . The United States is over as a SuperPower , it was over before Trump . The US is like the UK after WWII except worse Demographics and Debt .
1324046416835235848 2020-11-05 01:50:40 +0800 <CoolChange80> Black Pander is was not a winning strategy for Trump / Kushner 2020 .
1324045850096619527 2020-11-05 01:48:24 +0800 <CoolChange80> A Civil War by 2030 .
1324043555439071232 2020-11-05 01:39:17 +0800 <CoolChange80> All these Grifters from Conservative Inc going on FoxNews and elsewhere telling Trump is going to win 20% of the black vote . Blexit .  Candace Owens and Diamond and Silk laugh all the way to the bank .
1324043044929372160 2020-11-05 01:37:16 +0800 <CoolChange80> The White Middle Class And Working Class Have Their Opportunities And Future Stolen From Them And Yet They Do Nothing . They Don't Burn Cities To The Ground , They Don't Do Jack Shit .
1324042300696264707 2020-11-05 01:34:18 +0800 <CoolChange80> How about that Platinum Plan and the First Step Act and the Black Unemployment Rate . What a crock of shit .
1324041864102744064 2020-11-05 01:32:34 +0800 <CoolChange80> Everything went the way the elites wanted it to . No resistance from the white middle class and working class .
1324041500569804803 2020-11-05 01:31:07 +0800 <CoolChange80> Donald Trump didn't make any major in-roads with blacks , if he did , he would be have won Georgia by a lot .
1324040811588292609 2020-11-05 01:28:23 +0800 <CoolChange80> Everything went according to plan for the criminal elites and their partners , now they can oppress the middle class and working class as usual .
1324040364731322370 2020-11-05 01:26:37 +0800 <CoolChange80> My dad gave Donald Trump a 100% chance of winning the election , I didn't believe it because I knew the mail-in ballots and voter fraud would be off the charts this year.
1324039907644493833 2020-11-05 01:24:48 +0800 <CoolChange80> BLACKS ARE THE PERFECT GROUP TO COMMIT VOTER FRAUD FOR THE ELITES BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION IS AFRAID TO CONFRONT THEM , BLACKS CRY RACISM AND VOTER SUPPRESSION .  BUSINESS AS USUAL . THE ELITES CRUSH THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH THE HELP THEIR PARTNERS AND PAWNS .
1324039075003813896 2020-11-05 01:21:29 +0800 <CoolChange80> I knew the voter fraud and mail-in ballots was going to doom Donald Trump and the Republicans in 2020 . Everything went as planned .
1324038033683947520 2020-11-05 01:17:21 +0800 <CoolChange80> What are you gonna do about it,  America?  Nothing .
1324035869658021888 2020-11-05 01:08:45 +0800 <CoolChange80> In many ways Donald Trump built his own defeat .
1324035693434167297 2020-11-05 01:08:03 +0800 <CoolChange80> Trump disbanded the voter fraud commission and basically treated Kris Kobach like a pariah after the 2018 midterm
1324035362386288642 2020-11-05 01:06:44 +0800 <CoolChange80> @PennStateBMP Donald Trump spent 4 years pandering to blacks and neglected whites .  The Black pandering clearly didn't pay off , but the neglecting whites may have cost Trump the election .
1324031569531670529 2020-11-05 00:51:40 +0800 <CoolChange80> The Republicans have enabled voter fraud for decades , even Republican appointed judges have done nothing to stop it .
1324031253029572609 2020-11-05 00:50:24 +0800 <CoolChange80> How did that 4 years of pandering to blacks work out for Donald Trump and Jared Kushner . Not well .
1324029636288937986 2020-11-05 00:43:59 +0800 <CoolChange80> YOU THINK THE PANDERING TO BLACKS PAID OFF FOR DONALD TRUMP AND JARED KUSHNER ? TRUMP CLEARLY DIDN'T GET DOUBLE DIGITS WITH THE BLACK VOTE .
1324029208876748801 2020-11-05 00:42:17 +0800 <CoolChange80> @JackFell13 America is not a great country anymore
1323980281267822598 2020-11-04 21:27:52 +0800 <CoolChange80> @conchrepublic72 The Republicans and Trump failed to do anything in 2017 and 2018 , now it is costing Trump in 2020
1323978177321095168 2020-11-04 21:19:30 +0800 <CoolChange80> I'm glad a solidly red state like Montana didn't put a piece of shit like Steve Bullock in the senate .
1323977896134905856 2020-11-04 21:18:23 +0800 <CoolChange80> @EducateAPatriot Cornyn ran ahead of Trump in Texas .
1323976836574044163 2020-11-04 21:14:10 +0800 <CoolChange80> John Cornyn is a lot more popular in Texas than Ted Cruz .
1323976655917010944 2020-11-04 21:13:27 +0800 <CoolChange80> They wasted a fortune trying to defeat solidly RedState senators and failed. McConnell , Graham , Daines , Cornyn all won easily .
1323975435156336640 2020-11-04 21:08:36 +0800 <CoolChange80> @stranahan FoxNews has no future . They are the network of nobody . FoxNews was worse than CNN at times tonight .
1323972620493246464 2020-11-04 20:57:25 +0800 <CoolChange80> John Cornyn won by a solid margin in Texas .
1323972352280010753 2020-11-04 20:56:21 +0800 <CoolChange80> Lindsey Graham wasn't the Ted Cruz of 2020 after all ,  Lindsey Graham won in a landslide .
1323972024327352321 2020-11-04 20:55:03 +0800 <CoolChange80> Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham won landslide victories despite the Democrats spending insane money trying to beat them.

1323966435832508416 2020-11-04 20:32:51 +0800 <CoolChange80> Donald Trump allowed himself to become one of the least powerful presidents in American history by hiring so many bad people .
1323965703037267970 2020-11-04 20:29:56 +0800 <CoolChange80> America is a dead country walking .
1323965389127225345 2020-11-04 20:28:41 +0800 <CoolChange80> FoxNews is Arnon Mishkin and Chris Wallace .
1323965192594694144 2020-11-04 20:27:54 +0800 <CoolChange80> Donald Trump 's paranoia is validated .

1323963859842048000 2020-11-04 20:22:36 +0800 <CoolChange80> My prediction of a Civil War by 2030 looks better with each passing day .
1323962488052981761 2020-11-04 20:17:09 +0800 <CoolChange80> The United States of America is not worth saving .

1323318229620719618 2020-11-03 01:37:06 +0800 <CoolChange80> I'm cynical . If Trump was getting 20% of the black vote it would show up in some poll and they couldn't hide that. His lead in a state like Georgia (30%+ black electorate) would be 8 to 10 pts instead of maybe 2 points , or 6 or 7 points in North Carolina(20%+ black electorate).

1322572625596612608 2020-11-01 00:14:20 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano Republicans need a dose of reality . Georgia 6th (Newt's old district) , Texas 22nd (Delay's old district) , Texas 7th (Culberson's old) . 8 years ago these were districts that Republicans won by at least 20 points. Demographics are destiny .
1322571348594593792 2020-11-01 00:09:16 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano Every Suburban Texas and Georgia district went Republican by double digits even 8 years ago.  Newt Gingrich /Tom Price 's old district is held by a Democrat , Obama got only 37% there in 08 and 12. Stacey Abrams carried it by 3.5 . Georgia 6th . Demographics
1322569875336929281 2020-11-01 00:03:25 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano If Donald Trump was getting 15% to 20% the black vote , then why isn't there even a Republican poll or any poll showing him a state like Georgia or North Carolina by low double digits or high single digits . There is no Blexit despite what the Grifters say .
1322569297294745601 2020-11-01 00:01:07 +0800 <CoolChange80> Blacks will never leave the control JudeoBolshevik elites . Trump will stay in the single digits with the black vote  , he will improve with hispanics compared to 2016 .
1322568033924194309 2020-10-31 23:56:06 +0800 <CoolChange80> @TheMarkPantano They feed the people shit that Donald Trump is going to get 15% to 20% of the black vote and 40%+  of the hispanic vote and yet he's campaigning in Georgia and North Carolina  and Texas is considered close .
1322566411429007360 2020-10-31 23:49:39 +0800 <CoolChange80> Sean Connery was a great screen presence but a horrible actor . He was as bad as Kevin Costner .
