1328163417593700352 2020-11-16 10:30:09 +0800 <nandelabra> @rmbodenheimer It’s not a distance learning problem, it’s the lack of a social safety net. Not all students have the same resources, kids of color have weak internet/one laptop per household for multiple siblings. Public education was an unequal mess before covid and its 1000000x worse now.
1328163111724064768 2020-11-16 10:28:56 +0800 <nandelabra> Sure, but the idea that we open schools back up because kids need to learn doesn’t at all account for teacher health. I don’t get a choice about teaching in person. I have to or I must resign.

1327790942707912705 2020-11-15 09:50:04 +0800 <nandelabra> May we all aspire to be more like Sita and slightly less like Ram. THE END. (34/34)
1327790938597564417 2020-11-15 09:50:03 +0800 <nandelabra> In some ways, Ravan had way more respect for Sita than her own damn husband, because the former swore not to touch her until she consented. And Sita had more respect for herself than anyone could give her, which is why she kicked her petty husband’s ass to the curb. (33/x)
1327790934344478722 2020-11-15 09:50:02 +0800 <nandelabra> So while #diwali itself is a celebration of the triumph of good versus evil, what happens after the celebrations took place is even more important than what came before. Anyone can triumph over evil, but it takes a truly good person to live up to those ideals. (32/x)
1327790930221535235 2020-11-15 09:50:01 +0800 <nandelabra> Ram is only kind of ashamed. Mostly he’s shocked: “Geez Sita, that was just a suggestion, you didn’t have to get all huffy about it!” Anyway, he packs up his sons and heads back to Ayodhya, having set a terrible fucking precedent for misogyny and patriarchal customs. (31/x)
1327790926098522112 2020-11-15 09:50:00 +0800 <nandelabra> She shouts to the sky: “I refuse to live like this. If I have never betrayed my vows, may the Earth goddess herself swallow me whole and return me from whence I came.” The gods, pitying Sita and pissed at Ram, open the Earth and Sita disappears into the soil. (30/x)
1327790921958690818 2020-11-15 09:49:59 +0800 <nandelabra> Sita: “From the moment I married you I have done nothing but worship your shadow, your mind, your soul. I have given you everything. I never even spoke a word against you when you punished me for my loyalty. You have injured me in a way I never thought possible.” (29/x)
1327790918007713792 2020-11-15 09:49:58 +0800 <nandelabra> “Yeah well,” Ram says, “I need male heirs after I’m dead sooooo I’m just gonna take the kids with me.” Sita asks, “What about me?” “Weellll,” says Ram, “people still think you’re a slut. Why don’t you find a way to prove you aren’t?” Sita fucking loses it. (28/x)
1327790913641455616 2020-11-15 09:49:57 +0800 <nandelabra> Ram berates Sita for never telling him that he had kids. She calmly tells him that she was pregnant by him when he had her abandoned in the forest, and given his disrespect she never planned to introduce him to his kids. AS IS HER RIGHT. (27/x)
1327790909862400001 2020-11-15 09:49:56 +0800 <nandelabra> The fucked-up, misogynist end of the story doesn’t stop here. Many years later, King Ram, on a hunting trip in the forest, comes upon twin brothers who look just like him. His kids! He follows them to Sita, who has, again, lived most of her life in exile. (26/x)
1327790905907171333 2020-11-15 09:49:55 +0800 <nandelabra> Lakshman is shocked that his brother will not defend his wife, but he once swore an oath to do whatever his brother asked of him, so he puts the pregnant Sita in a carriage, rides to the woods, drops her off BY HERSELF, and heads back to town. (25/x)
1327790902060994560 2020-11-15 09:49:54 +0800 <nandelabra> He calls his brother Lakshman and says, “Look bro, I can’t govern if people don’t believe me. I can’t govern if they think their queen is a fallen woman. Can you please take her to the woods and like leave her there? Forever? She’ll be fine, she’ll eat berries and stuff.” (24/x)
1327790896537071616 2020-11-15 09:49:53 +0800 <nandelabra> Ram is psyched. “See?! We’re good now! Thanks, Sita, I love you, honey!” He promptly impregnates Sita. But rumors persistent. People are convinced Sita performed some kind of witchcraft to trick her husband. Ram is so horrifically insecure that he won’t defend her. (23/x)
1327790893097771009 2020-11-15 09:49:52 +0800 <nandelabra> Sita is deeply offended and hurt, devastated by both her husband’s distrust of her and his inability to stick up for her. But she agrees. And naturally, she walks out of the fire with not so much as even a split end of hair. (22/x)
1327790889775861761 2020-11-15 09:49:51 +0800 <nandelabra> She protests, saying she prayed day and night for her husband to come get her. “Totally, I get it,” Ram says, “but uhhh you’re gonna need to prove it. Let’s have you walk through a holy fire, and if you come out unburnt, I’ll believe you!” (21/x)
1327790885988409348 2020-11-15 09:49:51 +0800 <nandelabra> So he goes to his wife, WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY NEVER EVEN LET ANOTHER MAN SO MUCH AS HUG HER, and says, “So hey, look, *I* know you didn’t cheat on me, and *you* know you didn’t cheat on me, but everyone else doesn’t know.” Sita is, rightfully, shocked. (20/x)
1327790882167214080 2020-11-15 09:49:50 +0800 <nandelabra> What precipitated his decision: as he was going about Ayodhya, Ram heard a washerman beat his wife, yelling: “How dare you cheat on me? Do you think I’m like Ram, who allows his woman to sleep with other men and then come home to him?” Ram loses it. (19/x)
1327790878619013120 2020-11-15 09:49:49 +0800 <nandelabra> In fact, Ram is such a good guy that he decides to question Sita. He decides to subject to interrogation the woman known for her honesty, loyalty, and unequivocal devotion to her husband. (18/x)
1327790875443929089 2020-11-15 09:49:48 +0800 <nandelabra> Murmurs begin in the palace, that Sita is unworthy of Ram, that she has broken her vows, that she has lain with a demon god and then lied to everyone, including and especially her husband, who is SUCH A GOOD GUY!!!! (17/x)
1327790872558264320 2020-11-15 09:49:47 +0800 <nandelabra> Gossip begins to wind its way through Ayodhya, suggesting that Sita is lying. “How could she have lived with that man and not submitted to his desires?” “If she was forced to sleep with him, then she’s lying to us about her fidelity.” (16/x)
1327790869622255616 2020-11-15 09:49:47 +0800 <nandelabra> Upon returning to Ayodhya to claim his rightful throne, Ram is greeted with celebrations, fireworks, parties, prayers, all the trimmings. Sita is upheld as the paragon of loyal wife, and Lakshman is hailed as the embodiment of a good brother. HOWEVER. (15/x)
1327790861762039808 2020-11-15 09:49:45 +0800 <nandelabra> BUT. Now is the time for the part of the story that absolutely no one teaches you when you’re a kid. I didn’t even know about it till I was about to graduate from high school.  (14/x)
1327775360562454528 2020-11-15 08:48:09 +0800 <nandelabra> But the common folks worship Ram and his family, so they light earthenware candles all over the country so they can find their way back. Hence, the Festival of Lights. (13/x)

1327775357580226562 2020-11-15 08:48:08 +0800 <nandelabra> Upon arriving in Lanka, Hanuman lights the end of his tail, and while flying about Lanka, lights the entire country on fire. Ravan is killed, Sita is rescued, and everyone heads home! Yay! Happy ending! (11/x)
1327775356066160640 2020-11-15 08:48:08 +0800 <nandelabra> Meanwhile, back at the ranch in the woods, Ram and Lakshman have discovered Sita’s kidnapping and are enraged. They recruit the monkey god Hanuman, and his monkey comrades, to build a bridge to Lanka (since only Hanuman can fly and the mortal Ram and Lakshman cannot). (10/x)
1327775354552012802 2020-11-15 08:48:08 +0800 <nandelabra> Upon landing in Lanka, Ravan says point blank: “Look, I’m not gonna touch you until you want me. I’m happy to wait forever, but I will not even sit next to you until you want to be my wife.” Sita ignores him, sits in silent meditation, knowing her husband will rescue her. (9/x)
1327775353042063360 2020-11-15 08:48:07 +0800 <nandelabra> After grabbing her and revealing his true form, Ravan flies (he’s a very intelligent and powerful being, so yes, he can fly) to Lanka (present-day Sri Lanka) with Sita in his arms, who is screaming and crying and begging him for mercy. (8/x)
1327775351251079168 2020-11-15 08:48:07 +0800 <nandelabra> Ravan, still in disguise, stands outside the line in the sand, and beckons Sita closer. She is hesitant, says she cannot defy her brother-in-law. Ravan-as-monk gets upset. “Is this the treatment a holy men receive from the great Sita?” She apologizes, crosses the line. (7/x)
1327775348751261696 2020-11-15 08:48:06 +0800 <nandelabra> So he disguised himself as a traveling monk and trekked to our heroes’ huts in the woods. Sita came out to greet him, and he requested food and drink. In Hinduism guests are a form of god, and it’s a sin to deny generosity to a guest. (6/x)
1327775347144876033 2020-11-15 08:48:06 +0800 <nandelabra> Meanwhile, in the country of Lanka, the evil lord Ravan—who was so intelligent that he had ten heads to hold all his knowledge—heard of Sita’s beauty and, basically, decided to smash that. (5/x)
1327775345605570561 2020-11-15 08:48:05 +0800 <nandelabra> I wanna make clear: Ram is held up as the epitome of Hindu male deities. Honest, brave, loyal, generous, etc. Sita was renowned for her beauty, steadfast loyalty to her husband, intelligence, etc. Lakshman had sworn his fealty to his brother &amp; SIL. (4/x)
1327775343881695234 2020-11-15 08:48:05 +0800 <nandelabra> The trio lived simply, happily in a hut. Ram &amp; Lakshman went out to hunt/forage every day, while Sita kept house. Before leaving each morning, Lakshman would draw a line in the sand outside the hut, instructing Sita to never cross it, that she was safe behind it. (3/x)
1327775342019416065 2020-11-15 08:48:05 +0800 <nandelabra> Lord Rama and his brother Lakshman, and the former’s wife Sita, were banished by R &amp; L’s evil stepmother Kaikeyi, and forced into exile in the forest for 14 years. (2/x)
