What WE need to do is find and list the hate groups that call themselves Antifa.  Just blanket hating 'Antifa' is a boogeyman. It doesn't have a leader. It's an impossible fight.
1322314994961149952 2020-10-31 07:10:36 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @BBouffiou @naughtyforfuns1 @fundubulous Yes really. It's so crazy trying to explain this to you.  let's try this; ALL LOOTERS AND VANDALS ARE CRIMINALS BUT NOT ALL LOOTERS AND CRIMINALS ARE ANTIFA.  Let's find and punish all the looters and criminals but if your hunt is for Antifa you're wasting your time.
1322313174536736768 2020-10-31 07:03:22 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @naughtyforfuns1 @BBouffiou @fundubulous That's a fundraiser for The Portland General Defense Committee. Again, if 'Rose City Antifa' is responsible then THAT is a specific group. What you've tried to offer as evidence is not. BUT this is perfect if you're not lying; Stop 'Rose City Antifa' not just a general boogeyman
1322308963661012992 2020-10-31 06:46:38 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @BBouffiou @naughtyforfuns1 @fundubulous exactly. Creating a boogeyman to be afraid of that can never be caught is very Orwellian.
1322308738032627712 2020-10-31 06:45:45 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @naughtyforfuns1 @BBouffiou @fundubulous it just makes me reasonable. Again, who are they? who is the leader? You're not after Antifa, you're after the criminal organizations committing crimes under the banner of Antifa. They have leaders and cells just like identifiable hate groups. Antifa doesn't.
1322272234296156160 2020-10-31 04:20:41 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @lisa_curry time to squat

1322271553170464769 2020-10-31 04:17:59 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @LMyers7718 Well, there are two ways to answer this; 1. No. this is exactly my point.   2. you don't remember Hippies setting fire to things and trying to tear down the establishment in the 60s?  I'm also against fascism but I don't set shit on fire or looting. Thanks for proving my point.
1322249965020700673 2020-10-31 02:52:12 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @lisa_curry @MayorOfLA oh no. where are you going?
1322249793419141121 2020-10-31 02:51:31 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @KateElizabethK1 @Cj7jeeps Totally. (I think this video has been proven to be out of context but your point is still correct-ish).  Yes! prosecute them for being assholes, vandals, criminals etc YES! But saying that they should be arrested for being Antifa is just silly. See how its just a boogeyman call?
1322248362460995584 2020-10-31 02:45:50 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @Immadothething what happens to them?
1322246689659396096 2020-10-31 02:39:11 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @KateElizabethK1 @Cj7jeeps nothing is harmless. There are assholes in every subsection of people. There's probably even a couple assholes on the latest Disney show. Doesn't make them terrorists. I don't even think the 'Hippy movement' was harmless to those in power.
1322245807219769350 2020-10-31 02:35:41 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 I don't have a party. Only logic. And yes, not being fascist is a good idea.
1322244250394787840 2020-10-31 02:29:30 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 Dude, here's a direct pull from the article you sent me - "But neither antifa nor feminism is itself an organization. You cannot subpoena an idea or a movement."  I wish you could understand this. We're both probably on the same side. I hate looters and rioters and criminal gangs
1322243829534126080 2020-10-31 02:27:49 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @emeryemeryii Well, that experience supercedes everything of course
1322242673013526528 2020-10-31 02:23:13 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 Damn Hippies!
1322241380194811904 2020-10-31 02:18:05 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 Dude, exactly. Conspiracy theories don't burn down cities and hurt people. Militias and criminal organizations do. Until we find those out, you trying to blame things on a boogeyman is just as effective as screaming "Damn Hippies!"
1322240962836377601 2020-10-31 02:16:26 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 Oh yeah, where do these Antifa donations go? To the head of an organization? I bet they have a title that ISN'T ' https://t.co/dAPrMoYrDD Antifa'. Your snide digs at my facts don't validate your conspiracy theories. Find the criminal gangs and prosecute them!
1322239651688579072 2020-10-31 02:11:13 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @TheLassNextdoor @kiyasapphire up like a rocket! lol
1322239483455049728 2020-10-31 02:10:33 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @Cj7jeeps @KateElizabethK1 yes, a group is a group But terrorists DO act in cells and groups and they ARE monitored. It's like saying 'The Right wing' is a terrorist organization.  No, it's groups like The Proud Boys or the KKK. That's what needs to be figured. Otherwise you're just yelling "Damn Hippies!"
1322237838348333057 2020-10-31 02:04:01 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 ah your grammar is ok. But your 'facts' are just conspiracy theories. Dude, if they were a terrorist organization you'd know the leader.  Militias and criminal gangs are organized and funded. Find the leaders of those. The damn hippies!
1322234870198804480 2020-10-31 01:52:13 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @BBouffiou @fundubulous exactly. What are they called? let's figure it out.  I'm not quite sure about your stat that 'Anti-fascism' has killed more than Fascism tho
1322233862601105408 2020-10-31 01:48:13 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EldonTyrell9 ok, i'll play your game then.  Who is the leader of Antifa?
1322233122591629314 2020-10-31 01:45:16 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @KateElizabethK1 yes. It's just as effective. They're not an actual group. We need to find the actual criminal groups that get away with fooling you in to thinking Antifa is some group that can be found. Damn Hippies!
1322232333559230464 2020-10-31 01:42:08 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @michmommy675 @timiofak @MeghArlot true
1322232056277999616 2020-10-31 01:41:02 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @BBouffiou @fundubulous now just replace 'Antifa' with 'damn hippies' in your tweet.  Antifa is a banner but the actual militias and looters who use the title 'Antifa' so that you can't find their figurehead are what need to be figured out. They're actually not called 'Antifa'
1322230855289372672 2020-10-31 01:36:16 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @kiyasapphire well, you pay very little. everything has a same standard price and when I lived there it was ¬£7.60 lol
1322230494512099328 2020-10-31 01:34:50 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> Screaming "It's Antifa" is the just the 2020 version of my dad screaming "Damn Hippies" in the 60s.

1322228870741852160 2020-10-31 01:28:23 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @fundubulous @BBouffiou Who is the leader of Antifa anyway? This just seems like a boogeyman that they love to bitch about. Find the actual groups and then take them on. Shouting "it's Antifa" just seems to be the 2020s version of when my dad used to scream "Damn Hippies!" in the 60s üòÇ
1322228130602340352 2020-10-31 01:25:26 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> Biden wants to raise taxes for people who earn over $400,000 and some Americans are crying "It's like being mugged". Yet, they'll pay $400 for an Epi-pen that Canadians and Brits get for a fraction and they think that's just the cost of healthcare. American healthcare 'mugs' you.

Not as bad the US but their herd immunity attempt went very poorly. Still does. Come on Heather, the facts are all right there, from a number of non-partisan sources. We're hopeful for you.

Also, scientists are pretty unanimous. Here's a link to ACTUAL science news. The pandemic should be taken seriously.  https://t.co/CIIQ4GiJpI
1315720233752043520 2020-10-13 02:25:23 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> Heartbreaking for America watching Republican Senators sing the praises of RBG while knowing they're nominating someone who will help them erase all the progress she made. #rbglegacy  #NotoriousRBG
1315712245360291840 2020-10-13 01:53:38 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @HeatherLC74 @JOSalinger @SLAMonline That's not really the way to look at it. You're not being dictated to, you're being advised. And after being advised, like these guys, they choose not to take the advice of scientists and probably take it home to their grandparents who are not part of your '99% recover' non plan.

1314310759241842688 2020-10-09 05:04:38 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> During the heyday of action films People used to say  "If I was in solitary confinement like -Insert Hero Name Here- with nothing to do I'd just work out and emerge super buff too" I think we've all learned that is not true by now.

1310995325448929280 2020-09-30 01:30:17 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @tl_trevaskis Exactly. there should be an operator who can communicate with them full time. like "officer 251 you're good to go. Camera check confirmed." We have these functions in other aspects of life.

1308496652181729280 2020-09-23 04:01:27 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> It's not that I get frustrated at little things, it's that I let them frustrate me for too long. After they've lost relevance. Like the bill for a therapist. Even after the money is long gone, say half way through a session I'll still be thinking about how overpriced it was.

1306222653716312064 2020-09-16 21:25:23 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @29nkshah It is not. I‚Äôm offended that you would try to make such an accusation. The same can be said for a cat or any confused animal in a bath of ANY person. It wasn‚Äôt an observation on Religion.

1304512953455005696 2020-09-12 04:11:39 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> I'm really proud of my Country's actions on that day and appreciative of every Nova Scotian's actions, especially my paw. It's not lost on me how my upbringing on Airforce bases shaped my world view. I do my best to approach the world with a Canadian military kind of compassion.
1304509337625219072 2020-09-12 03:57:17 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> My father told me it's the only time in Canadian History that they received orders to be prepared to fire on hostiles ON THEIR OWN BASE as they searched and cleared each plane. Tense to hear. With thousands of people stranded that ol' Canadian Hospitality kicked in afterwards.
1304507999168401409 2020-09-12 03:51:58 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> On this day 19 years ago my father was the Commanding Officer of Shearwater Airforce Base in Eastern Canada as hundreds of USA flights were redirected to them. I'm very proud of the actions of the Canadian Military and small communities (see, 'Come From Away') in that crisis.
1304503123008913408 2020-09-12 03:32:35 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @RevEnFuego My Dad was the Commanding Officer of Shearwater Airforce Base.  He said it was intense. They had to search hundreds of flights redirected to them. My dad said it's the first time they've ever received orders to fire their weapons on an enemy on their own base.
1304502420290981888 2020-09-12 03:29:48 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> @EricBreitigam Go ahead and look it up man. 'Come From Away' is the Musical based on Canadian actions after 9/11.  most of USA's flights on the eastern seaboard were redirected to Eastern Canada where we jumped in to hospitality mode. My father was actually the C.O. of Shearwater Airforce Base

1300616799067668487 2020-09-01 10:09:43 +0800 <JJWhitesnake> Big ass cockroach on the top of my cauliflower as I unwrapped it just now. Just brought it back from the grocery store. Had hell of a battle gettin it in to the sink. (Felt like 5 minutes but was probably 30 seconds) Anyroad, I‚Äôve got some adrenaline going now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
