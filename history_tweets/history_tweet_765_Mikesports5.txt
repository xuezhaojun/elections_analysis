I know of 3 Calif cities that had outside Christmas lights &amp; decorations banned by Chinese. They say it's distracting, it's also a step closer to muting Christmas. No one complains bc it would be racist.

That's why prop13 passed in California bc so many seniors were starving or going homeless. While Boomers were focused on getting rich.

They forgot about the depression, child labor, working 12 hour 6 days a week, previous generations had to endure &amp; fight to fix.

HR were Boomers trying to find jobs for POC, by removing White Males. My boss was trying to save our jobs, w/out getting into trouble.

One day the boss came around and assigned everyone a label, i.e. I'm Hispanic, your disabled etc. HR came around &amp; asked personal questions, anyone who didn't have a label, i.e White healthy male was let go.

I asked how? he gave me a # I called 1st question, Are you Hispanic? Yes. Foreclosure stopped, debt forgiven. Gave the # to White friends, All were denied.
