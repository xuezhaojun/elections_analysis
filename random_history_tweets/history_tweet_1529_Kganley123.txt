1344033037722374144 2020-12-30 05:30:21 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm wondering if @potus Trump knows Pence is going to sell us out &amp; has therefore called Patriots to DC to put on pressure or back him up when he arrests Pence. Pence is scheduled to immediately fly out of country following whatever action he takes. Fleeing maybe? Be prepared.
1343963562809540609 2020-12-30 00:54:17 +0800 <Kganley123> You must. Don't disappoint us Sir. We love you. We do. But we can't take anymore. Frustrations &amp; lost hope are high. Thank you.
1343963561144422401 2020-12-30 00:54:17 +0800 <Kganley123> and I don't trust the trip will avail anything but more empty rhetoric &amp; further loss of our country. If you really are our President, if you really stand for our Constitution &amp; this country, then you MUST stop trying to work within the system &amp; do the hard but correct thing.
1343963560062328833 2020-12-30 00:54:17 +0800 <Kganley123> nightmare, utilizing all our creativity to bring in work trusting in your word to fix this, "the best is yet to come". I would love to come to DC to yank every Congressman &amp; judge, mayor, Antifa/BLM &amp; police scum out of their seat &amp; pummel the life from them. But I can't afford
1343963559034699777 2020-12-30 00:54:16 +0800 <Kganley123> delivered up. Our cries seem to be ignored as you continue to trust your traitorous staff, generals, politicians, &amp; judges. It's wrong Sir, it's dead wrong. Personally, we've done everything possible in our company to keep staff working &amp; getting paychecks during the 2020
1343963557398859778 2020-12-30 00:54:16 +0800 <Kganley123> to come to DC for yet another "rally". For what? We have been standing in Pilot's Praetorium crying out for Barabus to be delivered up for justice. We are crying out to reverse the crime the Saducees &amp; Pharisees committed when they convinced the people to ask for Jesus to be
1343963555977039876 2020-12-30 00:54:16 +0800 <Kganley123> 5-D chess, the "reveals". Especially re: the election. We get it. There was immense fraud. Now you must DO something substantive outside the Cabal system. We've spent our last dollars, lost our businesses, been abused &amp; arrested &amp; yet you ask us to spend more money we don't have
1343963554953588736 2020-12-30 00:54:15 +0800 <Kganley123> know what action needs to he taken &amp; it must be done now. To continue trying to work within a very broken, diabolical, evil, wicked, system &amp; trusting anyone within that system, &amp; expecting any type of positive outcome is the definition of insanity. We're burnt out on "the plan",
1343963553699569665 2020-12-30 00:54:15 +0800 <Kganley123> An open letter to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Dear Sir: I am not sure if any other Patriot shares my sentiments here, but I hope they do &amp; will find some way to get this to you. I am begging you to please stop the insanity. Please do what is necessary to save us &amp; this country. You
1343793883021373443 2020-12-29 13:40:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @CattHarmony @GuilloryTracey How did you book it? When I looked they were 12,000 a night.
1343790414063493122 2020-12-29 13:26:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @GeorgePapa19 Why are you wearing a mask in the first place?
1343788906538434560 2020-12-29 13:20:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @LLinWood @imginamarie1 As we're obligated to do.
1343788754750717954 2020-12-29 13:19:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes!
1343788544548999170 2020-12-29 13:18:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio Sweet!
1343788336163377152 2020-12-29 13:18:00 +0800 <Kganley123> James 4:2 "We have not because we ask not". I'm going to be bold here &amp; ask by Faith, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I would love to experience staying in your hotel for the Jan 6th rally. May I have a room for 2 nights?
1343787010159341568 2020-12-29 13:12:44 +0800 <Kganley123> So we've come to our Red Sea moment. January 6th Patriots will be gathered in the thousands at the US Capitol facing Pharoah. All seems lost, all options expired. And then @realDonaldTrump, our Moses will lift his voice &amp; our deliverance will begin.
1343785717088960512 2020-12-29 13:07:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @tyler_casper Sunday brunch. Lazy day neked Sunday brunch.
1343667597770772480 2020-12-29 05:18:14 +0800 <Kganley123> Here's how it will go with Pence on 1/6. It will either be the final snuff out of a traitor w/ Pence voting for Biden &amp; being summarily arrested or he will show himself to be a true Patriot &amp; vote for Trump thereby saving his life. Remember the envelope?
1343529220299915269 2020-12-28 20:08:22 +0800 <Kganley123> I was thrown out of Best Buy yesterday for doing the same thing this gal did. I'm proud as heck.
1343528359557361666 2020-12-28 20:04:57 +0800 <Kganley123> My guess on the strategy here: this is a forced cornering by Pres. Trump. VP Pence is now forced into proving what side he's on. His vote will publicly prove he's either a Patriot or high level traitor mole &amp; Trump will react accordingly. Final flush out. Remember the envelope?
1343527413624446977 2020-12-28 20:01:11 +0800 <Kganley123> Better believe it.
1343526031269871616 2020-12-28 19:55:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @dunbdav Not without airfare and a hotel room. Don't know if you realize it yet, but many of us have been barely scraping by. And many haven't been able to  even do that. Just saying.
1343523021718396928 2020-12-28 19:43:44 +0800 <Kganley123> And stop wearing the damn masks!!
1343522006151487491 2020-12-28 19:39:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @w_terrence No.

1343517647250440192 2020-12-28 19:22:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @MysticSheWlf As long as I also had books.
1343515810791268353 2020-12-28 19:15:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @audreyy_kaye Yes we do, polite alpha males!
1343429710034788352 2020-12-28 13:32:57 +0800 <Kganley123> No. I don't need a $10 million home.  But I DO need my own home. I have the location, Floorplan, finishes, furniture all mentally chosen. Less than $500 k.
1343429148656594944 2020-12-28 13:30:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Can someone please explain to me why @realDonaldTrump keeps pushing the damn vaccines for an illness w/ over a 99% recovery rate?
1343427893909581825 2020-12-28 13:25:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @donnajdowns @GeorgenewsOrg That doesn't mean squat.Ambiguous relative wording."Focus strongly" can mean anything &amp; take forever in said "focus". You've seen Congress work.  If it's anything Trump wants its slow walked. Look at Barr &amp; Durham for instance. Weren't they tasked w/ investigations &amp; prosections?
1343423625907458049 2020-12-28 13:08:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Kirstie for President! Except increase the $1k to $2k. That's more realistic.
1343368532680089600 2020-12-28 09:29:51 +0800 <Kganley123> masculinized bitch manager to defend him. What a joke &amp; pathetic as hell. Give me liberty or give me death!
1343368531694383105 2020-12-28 09:29:51 +0800 <Kganley123> me a sheep, laughable. When Montana is this bad, then I know this country is done. Wyoming, Texas, &amp; Florida are last hold outs. I laugh because the emasculated door monitor is so owned, he gets his only legitimized reason for breathing by passing out face diapers &amp; calls his
1343368530591248385 2020-12-28 09:29:50 +0800 <Kganley123> female bitch ordering me around because "it's my store &amp; our policy". After toe to toeing with both of them for a bit, causing a very loud scene,  She threw me out. Which is fine, I made my stance, pointed out their sheeply communism, pointed out Constitutional law, they called
1343368529597198337 2020-12-28 09:29:50 +0800 <Kganley123> Got thrown out of Best Buy in Billings, MT for refusing to wear a mask. The door monitor, black guy my age,  insisted I wear one.I refused for medical reasons. So Mr. "he has to tuck his head between his legs to find his baby dick" calls his manager. Who turns out to be an alpha
1343038256363925505 2020-12-27 11:37:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Or night time military ops. SpaceX is active too.
1343038051241455616 2020-12-27 11:36:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @DonnaWR8 There are many night time military ops occurring right now, as well as day. Many different types of aircraft. Follow  https://t.co/g5pOQOX2KR to catch up.

1343037097423224832 2020-12-27 11:32:51 +0800 <Kganley123> The Nashville explosion will be shoved down our throats, if possible, as another Timothy McVeigh style bombing. Mark my words. But it was a missle. Mark those words.
1343036702915379200 2020-12-27 11:31:17 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes it is!
1343032539280101376 2020-12-27 11:14:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Interesting that isn't being done &amp; that Sidney is being barred from the WH. Things that make me go hmmmm..

1342988931495649280 2020-12-27 08:21:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Isn't this what Barr &amp; Durham &amp; the 16 +1 team have said for years? Pushed off drop dates,  promises of big booms that turned up empty, promises of draining the swamp? Yea, how's that working for us?
1342871390840528896 2020-12-27 00:34:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Of course He's King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords. No doubt, no shame.
1342870270789312513 2020-12-27 00:29:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Well if Pence needs that to do what's right, he's no Christian and has tiny if any balls.

1342864746630955009 2020-12-27 00:07:59 +0800 <Kganley123> Sydney is playing the role of bait to flush out those remaining traitors surrounding our President. But he should not neglect his spiritual advisory team. Wolves there as well.  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sir, now is the time to cut bait, trust only your family, Gen. Flynn, Sydney,
1342863472971849731 2020-12-27 00:02:55 +0800 <Kganley123> This does not look like Taylor.
1342855781914300417 2020-12-26 23:32:22 +0800 <Kganley123> I keep expecting Gene Roddenberry to step in &amp; do a monolog about 2020, esp. the election.
1342855480176041984 2020-12-26 23:31:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @atensnut Me too, all of is do!
1342855176080695298 2020-12-26 23:29:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @1Naasty Of course without question. I'm ready to lay down my life.
1342854965304291329 2020-12-26 23:29:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Actually for all we've been through &amp; lost $5- 10 k is more suitable. $2k won't get is through a month with rent prices, utilities, food.

But I'm very happy because their lives are all about drama, control, &amp; who has the most $$. &amp; they don't love or know Jesus. Wheat from the tares. Just pray for them

I've prayed not only for your 100% healing but that Almighty God will at least grace you to see this ENTIRE war through to the victory. That is the right of generals.
1342220992643387392 2020-12-25 05:29:56 +0800 <Kganley123> @DrShayPhD That's why you're there.  Time &amp; place for a reason, there are no accidents or coincidences. God knows you're faithful to pray.

1341979821732057088 2020-12-24 13:31:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @55true4u @Faithforever113 Mine too.
1341979300568821760 2020-12-24 13:29:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @AdrianNormanDC That's right!
1341979203252543489 2020-12-24 13:29:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @disclosetv Good.
1341978810640596992 2020-12-24 13:27:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @kelliwardaz @RealRLimbaugh You WILL make it back Rush, God must, I pray,  allow you to see the end of this long fought war in which you were a mighty spark so many years ago. My father loved you!
1341977806062845955 2020-12-24 13:23:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @atensnut @Alpha6Phinsider Sure have been. He's an important hero.
1341977091596636160 2020-12-24 13:20:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @ChuckCallesto Yes.
1341977052312846336 2020-12-24 13:20:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ @realDonaldTrump Not sure it was Mark, but somebody did. Also won't get her clearances.
1341976816458768384 2020-12-24 13:19:40 +0800 <Kganley123> So much truth here.
1341976627182358528 2020-12-24 13:18:55 +0800 <Kganley123> @PISDI94_96 Merry Christmas! Have fun, be blessed, be safe!
1341973865027661824 2020-12-24 13:07:56 +0800 <Kganley123> @JohnWiQ1776 Either way looked nice.  It's your heart &amp; soul that matters.
1341973553088872448 2020-12-24 13:06:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @LLinWood @TrumperWavin Thank You Sir, you have inspired many of us who were dog tired worn out. But you brought fresh life and air. We pray for you and the team!
1341967715121078274 2020-12-24 12:43:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin I would absolutely love it!!!
1341967441467908097 2020-12-24 12:42:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @philipsknowlton Graham crackers are just sheets of dry wall.  Simply apply LOTS of spackle ( thick frosting) to the edges, bases.
1341967014596755456 2020-12-24 12:40:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Tank I would like to pray that President Trump invite you to meet him in the oval office. You have been a steadfast champion of positivity throughout all of 2020 for those of us needing it so much. God bless you! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS
1341193315241193472 2020-12-22 09:26:19 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm so sick &amp; tired of hearing "rigged election" repeated over &amp; over ad nauseum I could throw up. We get it already. China stole the election. Either do something substantive about it &amp; the criminals involved or let us do something. Because so far in this war Proud Boys are it.
1341191979980316672 2020-12-22 09:21:00 +0800 <Kganley123> This is being American. On both sides. Anyone still closed or wearing a mask is a ball-less communist.
1341191146500833280 2020-12-22 09:17:42 +0800 <Kganley123> Let me repeat: Justice delayed is justice denied.
1341190883870314496 2020-12-22 09:16:39 +0800 <Kganley123> Dear God, please stop with the date projections for when "something big" is going to happen. We've been through it infinite times since 2017. AND WE'VE SEEN ZERO JUSTICE!!!
1341186465741467649 2020-12-22 08:59:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You've got to ball up NOW &amp; do the difficult but right thing. Otherwise, YOU are the traitor. Screw your advisors, they are wolves in sheep's clothing, esp. your spiritual advisors. The GOP nor anyone else is going to fix this election. Call Gen. Flynn!
1340910322907901952 2020-12-21 14:41:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @1Naasty Hasn't he already stopped?
1340910186517594112 2020-12-21 14:41:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @senatemajldr Bfd, Chinese whore. It won't even buy groceries. You need to face the wrath &amp; justice of Almighty God.
1340908729236037633 2020-12-21 14:35:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Go ahead &amp; make the rough calls Sir, we're ready. So ready that we're beginning to run out of steam from the delay. We support you in every way we can.  Let's get the fat lady on stage and singing!
1340908134651502594 2020-12-21 14:33:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @1blantdaddy 🙋‍♀️
1340907961435054080 2020-12-21 14:32:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle This is so true Tank!
1340788252114972672 2020-12-21 06:36:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Wow! Ya'll need to watch this &amp; pass it along.
1340783216085532672 2020-12-21 06:16:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @kimKBaltimore And you have ours Kimberly. I have my campaign management diploma from The Leadership Institute in Arlington, VA. I worked on several campaigns &amp; petition drives in Maryland. Our team was phone banking door knocking fiends. 10,000 doors one very hot summer,  temps over 100.
1340650799781695489 2020-12-20 21:30:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio @mackenziechilds Cool!
1340646828061048832 2020-12-20 21:14:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Thank you,  cheers for you! Real Americans &amp; Patriots here!
1340646607931338752 2020-12-20 21:13:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Yea, not wearing a mask to fly on an overcrowded plane, treated like cattle, 2 hours of pre- TSA early arrival b.s.
1340639095475716097 2020-12-20 20:44:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @cov_Gretchen @GuilloryTracey Me.
1340637390235287552 2020-12-20 20:37:16 +0800 <Kganley123> Because Americans have become fat, weak, low IQ bots.
1340637088857767936 2020-12-20 20:36:04 +0800 <Kganley123> @Timmyti60650909 So sorry to hear this, my condolences. It's ok to get angry, we're at war.
1340634508119273472 2020-12-20 20:25:49 +0800 <Kganley123> America IS open. AMERICANS are too chicken to walk in their freedom &amp; authority. They "want to comply" so they get what they deserve.
1340632582082371585 2020-12-20 20:18:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @no_silenced Hahaha! They already OWN us lock stock &amp; barrel. Try not paying taxes or traffic fines.
1340632205341589505 2020-12-20 20:16:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @martingeddes I won't complain, how yummy &amp; fun does this cart look?! I'd totally eat the profits though.
1340492072017481728 2020-12-20 10:59:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @NCPatriot888 @re5iGam Agreed. It all seems so hokey &amp; staged to me. Came off as Mike Pence tooting his own horn like some hero. I can't get past the whole Star Trek logo &amp; "Guardians" name. Really? Good gosh next they'll be publishing comic books. Wait, that's already been done. 🤦‍♀️
1340301730794196994 2020-12-19 22:23:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @NASCARSammy It looks beautiful! What a generous grandma!
1340298846111350789 2020-12-19 22:12:01 +0800 <Kganley123> 10 -1 Hunter ends up being CIA.
1340298678079168513 2020-12-19 22:11:21 +0800 <Kganley123> So why is this guy at the WH Christmas party? Isn't he persona non grata?
1340296015681753091 2020-12-19 22:00:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Well I just think it's uber wonderful that while the rest of America/world is suffering lockdowns, business losses, home losses, finance losses, zero Christmas for many,  the WH &amp; elites can still party like it's 1984. "Let them eat cake".
1340291833767755778 2020-12-19 21:44:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @SammiG0203 So why do you do it? Stand up to the confrontation, quit puss-ing out. Funny thing, once you take back your human authority no one questions it again. I never get questioned. It's been months.
1340291266513268736 2020-12-19 21:41:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @Dustmopp31 Bourbon &amp; coke.
1340290682280321025 2020-12-19 21:39:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Well he's a horse so...
1340289854601482240 2020-12-19 21:36:17 +0800 <Kganley123> Agreed. Enough soy boys, deselect that dna!
1339764534072942593 2020-12-18 10:48:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @LinSapCT @CodeMonkeyZ Really? You think for one minute our great President, military, &amp; 17 + million combat veterans + Patriots, fear Antifa/Blm? We need war, it's the only way to kill "the virus". It's the immunization "shot" heard round the world.
1339759980858073089 2020-12-18 10:30:45 +0800 <Kganley123> Well we love you Sir. And we're sick &amp; tired of you &amp; your family being treated badly.
1339757710829449217 2020-12-18 10:21:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @no_silenced 🤦‍♀️
1339757372206501889 2020-12-18 10:20:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @Gunny_Q Leave work. They aren't my maker &amp; support, God is.
1339756954416152576 2020-12-18 10:18:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @BHeuskin You're very welcome,  we're glad to "know" you in this cyber world. 🙂
1339755970084306951 2020-12-18 10:14:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @CraigRSawyer @DonnaWR8 A bullet
1339755840597716993 2020-12-18 10:14:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @LadySusette It's beautiful!
1339755198386860032 2020-12-18 10:11:45 +0800 <Kganley123> @martingeddes You forgot zombies.
1339755079490969603 2020-12-18 10:11:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @TX_WalkerRanger Yep.
1339754472369659905 2020-12-18 10:08:52 +0800 <Kganley123> It's been on my heart for a couple of days to issue a big heartfelt thank you to all our current, past, &amp; retired military K9 soldiers. You keep our humans comforted &amp; safe. We are indebted to you for your loyalty. ❤💕🐕‍🦺
1339680679420837890 2020-12-18 05:15:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Jesus is Lord!
1339677134248275968 2020-12-18 05:01:33 +0800 <Kganley123> Just like you prophesied!
1339655227331366912 2020-12-18 03:34:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @world_hillary @HillaryClinton Noose
1339654494670340096 2020-12-18 03:31:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Sweet! You'll do very well!
1339584894276530185 2020-12-17 22:55:01 +0800 <Kganley123> And this explains Pedo Joe's fake dementia, his earpieces, &amp; who's steering him.  Notice how he's a bit more lucid these days?
1339452806575443968 2020-12-17 14:10:09 +0800 <Kganley123> "Dictionaries"? That's soo 20th century.
1339451465677434881 2020-12-17 14:04:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @tjb123_tiffany @VFL2013 My condolences Tiffany, may he RIP.
1339450395202973697 2020-12-17 14:00:34 +0800 <Kganley123> @55true4u We love you back Patriot!
1339446707881299969 2020-12-17 13:45:55 +0800 <Kganley123> @lebronsonroids Wyoming here to help btw. Something is better than nothing.
1339446349398302720 2020-12-17 13:44:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @lebronsonroids This is so kind &amp; very generous. God bless you and all your "angel" connections.
1339442356123172864 2020-12-17 13:28:37 +0800 <Kganley123> Truth.
1339440275597344774 2020-12-17 13:20:21 +0800 <Kganley123> Omg!! It's like a clone or something! Creepy weird.
1339439704773574658 2020-12-17 13:18:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @dbongino Have you tried doing a back bend over the side of your bed to stretch your diaphragm?
1339437832683757568 2020-12-17 13:10:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @philipsknowlton The morbidly obese bearded "woman".
1339437591242760192 2020-12-17 13:09:41 +0800 <Kganley123> Ooohhh...the Rino's are "warning us". We're so scared... We the People, your BOSSES will do whatever we damn well please pussies!
1339437095589310464 2020-12-17 13:07:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @CharminUltra17 Could be CCP ops at this stage of the game.  In any case you can bet Soros has fingerprints on this.
1339436433598107650 2020-12-17 13:05:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Great advice Tank, everyone has a future!
1339049898990190594 2020-12-16 11:29:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh sweetie you're just aching for that fashion forward GITMO lounging attire aren't you? Make sure to wear matching lipstick.
1339048677143244802 2020-12-16 11:24:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @BluntForceTrut1 Everything ok?
1339048267405877250 2020-12-16 11:22:39 +0800 <Kganley123> Congratulations!
1339048086090309633 2020-12-16 11:21:56 +0800 <Kganley123> @SixQ2020 More than enough.
1339042991340625920 2020-12-16 11:01:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @ACTforAmerica @Mrssnuffy1 It's fading.
1339042783198253057 2020-12-16 11:00:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ @realDonaldTrump My guess is they're deep state too.
1339027095322648576 2020-12-16 09:58:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Truth.
1339026629448802309 2020-12-16 09:56:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Beautiful prayer, thank you. I pray the same on your behalf.
1339025624535420928 2020-12-16 09:52:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @JohnWiQ1776 I would like &amp; hope to be a much better person.
1338868137362538498 2020-12-15 23:26:53 +0800 <Kganley123> I want to strongly caution everyone currently making guesses about future events, timeliness, dates. DON'T DO IT! We've rowed this boat up the river so many times in the past 4 years only to be severely disappointed. Don't read your hopes into messages &amp; tweets.
1338865006671142913 2020-12-15 23:14:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ Have you ever been to Cody, WY Ron? It's the best ice climbing in the lower 48. Highest concentration of climbs. Alpine environment, rugged approaches. My ex pioneered the climbing, &amp; I made lots of memories.
1338864253655126017 2020-12-15 23:11:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Someone find where these NAZIS live &amp; harass the hell out of them until they can't leave their homes.  Follow them, berate them.
1338862852896014338 2020-12-15 23:05:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Hi Terrence!
1338862457930956805 2020-12-15 23:04:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio Lol
1338860937256738819 2020-12-15 22:58:16 +0800 <Kganley123> I gotta hand it to the MI Governor &amp; Secretary of State. It takes HUGE balls to blatantly &amp; so publicly enforce, oversee, &amp; conduct the wholesale cheating in this Presidential election. They have more chutzpah than Patriots who should have tarred &amp; feathered them by now.
1338827308023476225 2020-12-15 20:44:39 +0800 <Kganley123> Love it.😆
1338818926805803009 2020-12-15 20:11:20 +0800 <Kganley123> Charles again I must compliment you on your sense of style. It's always tastefully bold.
1338675349115179009 2020-12-15 10:40:49 +0800 <Kganley123> Brave Patriot here,  thank you!
1338671114428456961 2020-12-15 10:23:59 +0800 <Kganley123> 10 to 1 he's offered a position by Biden.
1338668199731109889 2020-12-15 10:12:24 +0800 <Kganley123> @catturd2 Yet.
1338668138200592384 2020-12-15 10:12:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @JohnWiQ1776 Dude, me &amp; my kids found Carmen years ago. Pretty sure Hunter is with her &amp; Waldo.
1338667912484175872 2020-12-15 10:11:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @DrShayPhD Rumors mostly i believe.
1338667229290762240 2020-12-15 10:08:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @MikeyMulkey Yes, because the big clean up is coming.
1338667078023200768 2020-12-15 10:07:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle We love you too Tank!
1338562742379307017 2020-12-15 03:13:21 +0800 <Kganley123> This must happen!
1338562295572668416 2020-12-15 03:11:35 +0800 <Kganley123> That's awesome! Now he needs massive protection!
1338562044543561731 2020-12-15 03:10:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Already have. Long ago.
1338519333752881152 2020-12-15 00:20:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @onlydob @anonpatriotq You're an idiot for mis-interpreting our words. Because low IQ. That's not what we've meant.
1338519039883112448 2020-12-15 00:19:42 +0800 <Kganley123> He's either being kept safe in anticipation of events or he's using his entire prior support as cover &amp; is now revealing his true self as d.s.
1338518238800478208 2020-12-15 00:16:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Thank you Mr. Mayor.
1338518152926220292 2020-12-15 00:16:10 +0800 <Kganley123> By "vaccines" I pray &amp; hope he means Marines!
1338517784477585416 2020-12-15 00:14:42 +0800 <Kganley123> Absolutely! With very secure anchors &amp; rope though.  I'm no fool. 😉
1338517006308368386 2020-12-15 00:11:37 +0800 <Kganley123> Tank is awesome! I hope President Trump invites him to the oval office someday. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It would also be way cool for Tank to meet Gen. Flynn.
1338516036270714880 2020-12-15 00:07:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @RolandiaKarnak Zero "credentials" I studied Constitutional Law in College, it was my major, Magna Cum Laude, Member of College Republicans, Pi Sigma Alpha, &amp; more.  Why in the hell would I bow to your "credential requirements" to prove myself. Anyone who can read can educate themselves in this.
1338503691242893313 2020-12-14 23:18:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @roberta3611 My condolences 😔. Ask God for another earth love if you want. Not a replacement as each is unique, but another special one.
1338502841258930176 2020-12-14 23:15:20 +0800 <Kganley123> And a stronger, freer world!
1338502516032425984 2020-12-14 23:14:02 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! Someone knew even back then!
1338502272582500353 2020-12-14 23:13:04 +0800 <Kganley123> So true. All they're doing is trying to legitimize their positions for the coffee filter face crowd.
1338498224479301632 2020-12-14 22:56:59 +0800 <Kganley123> Since when does a pedo computer software geek  get to dictate health policy? Epstein Island much there Gates?
1338497677521113096 2020-12-14 22:54:49 +0800 <Kganley123> Amen!
1338497135331799041 2020-12-14 22:52:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Congratulations!
1338300648614371328 2020-12-14 09:51:53 +0800 <Kganley123> And lazy fat ass Americans. Because it's easier to put on a mask than fight for what's right.
1338299749254893568 2020-12-14 09:48:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Good point!
1338299674998927360 2020-12-14 09:48:01 +0800 <Kganley123> You ain't as good as you once was,  but you're as good once as you ever was!
1338299258051543041 2020-12-14 09:46:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump At this stage, you have a duty &amp; obligation by your oath to invoke the Insurrection Act &amp; take control of the Chinese deep state b.s. If not, it means war &amp; fewer sheeple are prepared for that than martial law. We Patriots are ready, have been.
1338165550359330817 2020-12-14 00:55:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @AMandidaugherty @VincentCrypt46 Morning!
1338165408650637313 2020-12-14 00:54:29 +0800 <Kganley123> Fantastic strategy!
1338164771409956865 2020-12-14 00:51:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @atensnut Happy birthday!
1337995801759367169 2020-12-13 13:40:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep.
1337991830927863808 2020-12-13 13:24:45 +0800 <Kganley123> This is when you're tryna be sexy but completely miss the mark. They look like they drunk dressed.
1337894236423766016 2020-12-13 06:56:57 +0800 <Kganley123> Well there's that,  lol.
1337894140147769344 2020-12-13 06:56:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Has anyone else noticed when POTUS salutes, he SALUTES. It's not some half-assed limp wristed begrudgingly given effort. It's a straight up honorable salute. Hell Yes!
1337892850046967808 2020-12-13 06:51:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Good choice, lol.
1337892650934890496 2020-12-13 06:50:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @kingron_b Dear dear Jesus, she's both beautiful  &amp; adorable at the same time.  Protect her like a warrior.
1337891940436594688 2020-12-13 06:47:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @MikeyMulkey Hey "Mikey". Dr. Rand Paul &amp; his wife were accosted following the Trump rally on the WH lawn. This was following him suffering 3 broken ribs &amp; injured lung after a neighbor attacked him. I think he's done with "putting himself out there".
1337889873068318721 2020-12-13 06:39:37 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! "Damn. I f**ked her head off, wth?".🤣🤣🤣🤣
1337888821065576448 2020-12-13 06:35:26 +0800 <Kganley123> 1940.
1337888661749125120 2020-12-13 06:34:48 +0800 <Kganley123> And Christie Noem.
1337888265991385088 2020-12-13 06:33:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @travofoz Aww dang. Not that Red.
1337885894812962816 2020-12-13 06:23:48 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep.
1337885742211592192 2020-12-13 06:23:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Awww...
1337885603744993282 2020-12-13 06:22:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @Qtah17 After all he's been through,  Gen. Flynn is understandably cautious about who he is seen &amp; surrounds himself with.  Every photo op can be misconstrued into "something" as verified by this thread. And can come back to bite you in the ass. What is innocent will be twisted.
1337883049573273600 2020-12-13 06:12:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ Well that's a positive at least.
1337882903389224962 2020-12-13 06:11:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Sweet young man.
1337882329881055233 2020-12-13 06:09:38 +0800 <Kganley123> So wrong, so so wrong. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1337881896387137536 2020-12-13 06:07:55 +0800 <Kganley123> @JanetTXBlessed @FairyQ15 #1 is out, it looks cheap. Any of the others though. #3 might be too busy?
1337879876875943936 2020-12-13 05:59:53 +0800 <Kganley123> @GMarty85 @VincentCrypt46 Truth.
1337877608684343299 2020-12-13 05:50:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Wouldn't that be a great gift?
1337877051546615808 2020-12-13 05:48:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Strategy for China, post lists of all Govs &amp; Mayors etc. aligned with them. Military removal. Take back ALL lands, businesses, &amp; assetts purchased by or owned by China or linked persons. Kick every last one of them out of the country. Tons at NIH in Bethesda.
1337874676035383296 2020-12-13 05:39:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Anna you are so right. When Israel faced the Red Sea, Pharoah ( Satan) at their backs pressing down hard, high mountains on either side, all they could do is stop, hope, pray &amp; believe. Bewildered, confused, discouraged, exhausted, &amp; scared as all heck. And then God.
1337872636362178561 2020-12-13 05:31:07 +0800 <Kganley123> Make them into houses! They're great insulators when filled with dirt.
1337870032408203264 2020-12-13 05:20:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @mark9015pv Don't you dare break your path of success! It's not worth it. Why throw all those years of victory &amp; achievement away?
1337778571620716545 2020-12-12 23:17:20 +0800 <Kganley123> President Trump just announced the vaccine is ready &amp; is being shipped to governors for distribution. Yea you can keep your vaccines I'll take my chances with the 3 day flu bug.
1337777178864316416 2020-12-12 23:11:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @lebronsonroids @cjtruth The deal is Marines have been moving &amp; staging, heavy troop movements. Exponential military sky traffic worldwide but especially here.  All types of birds. Chinese have supplied ANTIFA &amp; BLM &amp; they're now trained. Watch  https://t.co/g5pOQOX2KR for updates.
1337774495059255303 2020-12-12 23:01:08 +0800 <Kganley123> allow this to happen again.
1337774494065160192 2020-12-12 23:01:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Make no mistake folks this battle for the life &amp; soul of our country &amp; world won't be settled in the courts, w/ an election, or peacefully. It's been prepped w/tons of prayer &amp; only a military operation can now solve this.We have to endure this w/ painful revelations so we NEVER
1337771289872723969 2020-12-12 22:48:24 +0800 <Kganley123> That's awesome! Hi Tank, we love you!
1337771055209828353 2020-12-12 22:47:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @PISDI94_96 They want to end the death penalty because they are subject to it.
1337770853442887681 2020-12-12 22:46:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @OldBob51 Happy birthday Bob!
1337770109432041478 2020-12-12 22:43:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep, I found that too.
1337770008194084867 2020-12-12 22:43:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ @realDonaldTrump They've already started.
1337402241599193090 2020-12-11 22:21:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Oooohhh...someone's getting a bit nervous about justice being served on her, the little traitor.
1337401843299667970 2020-12-11 22:20:21 +0800 <Kganley123> "Anti-democratic" is correct. We are NOT a democracy, which is veiled socialism/communism. We are a Constitutional Republic and you're a traitor to that Republic &amp; due a traitor's punishment.
1337401094951981056 2020-12-11 22:17:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Beautiful tree!
1337400781574586368 2020-12-11 22:16:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeschlossDC Hahaha! "Esteemed reporter". No such thing.
1337400589244792833 2020-12-11 22:15:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Same hydra, different snake head.
1337400424668700672 2020-12-11 22:14:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Follow the pen.
1337399884123533312 2020-12-11 22:12:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Biden is grasping at straws, pulling names out of a hat. Don't take any of this seriously, he's done.
1337398631201050624 2020-12-11 22:07:36 +0800 <Kganley123> Suuuure, her useful purpose has been served, her time is up. Time to pay the piper.
1337395113199247360 2020-12-11 21:53:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @elenochle F
1337393835010211840 2020-12-11 21:48:32 +0800 <Kganley123> NoW this is TRUTH!
1337039900261027845 2020-12-10 22:22:07 +0800 <Kganley123> Welcome back Mr. Mayor!
1337039414191505408 2020-12-10 22:20:11 +0800 <Kganley123> @kylegriffin1 It's not just 18 red states idiot, there's far more, it's just 18 states that have joined the lawsuit. And it isn't "the will of the people" for a demented pedo to be president. It was a fraudulent situation bought &amp; sold with cheating &amp; Vachinese $$.
1336537378706505728 2020-12-09 13:05:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio Meatballs and gravy!
1336534207082860544 2020-12-09 12:52:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @brokebackUSA @RonDeSantisFL I want to be there!
1336533895043403777 2020-12-09 12:51:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Both. But not just on weekends.
1336533548057067520 2020-12-09 12:50:04 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes.
1336533348131373056 2020-12-09 12:49:16 +0800 <Kganley123> With gas.
1336533168489332736 2020-12-09 12:48:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheOfficerTatum "Lately". He changes like the wind,  typical politician, greasy like the rest.
1336531220939698177 2020-12-09 12:40:49 +0800 <Kganley123> Thank you! Don't mess with Texas!
1336530432569929729 2020-12-09 12:37:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @RudyGiuliani Good to hear Mr. Mayor, I've &amp; many others have been praying!
1336530049638359045 2020-12-09 12:36:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @ReverendWarnock And you're wrong. Jesus is not pro-choice He's pro-life so we know whom you serve &amp; it's your father the devil.
1336529690832474112 2020-12-09 12:34:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel 4:44, 2:22 for me today.
1336529370593148928 2020-12-09 12:33:28 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh ok Chuckie, because BLM, ANTIFA, AOC, OMAR, RASHID aren't threats or anything. Sit down &amp; let the adults govern. You and your little chair demon can leave now.
1336528826113789952 2020-12-09 12:31:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @tedwheeler You're a pathetic joke &amp; no one takes you seriously. You're just trying to save face before your hanging. BTW, there are no "crises" except those &amp; your ilk you create.
1336528368787836929 2020-12-09 12:29:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @gayhouse90 @tedwheeler Hahaha! The Oregon Trail game!
1336094512955891713 2020-12-08 07:45:29 +0800 <Kganley123> Because they're being blackmailed &amp; are on the $$ dole.
1336093856949915649 2020-12-08 07:42:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Thank you Senator!
1336092648663175168 2020-12-08 07:38:05 +0800 <Kganley123> Right on right on!
1336091746728460291 2020-12-08 07:34:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @SixQ2020 Happy birthday! Enjoy the rest of your day!
1336089687044157442 2020-12-08 07:26:19 +0800 <Kganley123> So far. God has the last word.
1336089514293391360 2020-12-08 07:25:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @thewillwitt America HAS Christian values. Millions of us &amp; we were founded on them. It's the devil &amp; his followers that have converted the weak &amp; lost to their side. We need to fight like heck to capture them for Christ.
1336089053939130370 2020-12-08 07:23:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @ReaganBabe War.
1336088011646193664 2020-12-08 07:19:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Yes we are, you are very accomplished &amp; stay so positive which is incredibly helpful to all of us.The world needs lots of love &amp; postivity.
1335816331631886336 2020-12-07 13:20:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @vangough123 @LogicalThinki17 "To whom much is given, much more is expected."
1335816124798095360 2020-12-07 13:19:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @MattieTC27 @LogicalThinki17 Which is true. I've pondered this myself. Because we are fallible &amp; all our knowledge is subjective, influenced by egos. We can't truly say we "know" anything. Only God the Creator truly "knows" any &amp; everything becauz He made it &amp; is infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent
1335812210392645632 2020-12-07 13:03:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Ha! He pointed out Gov. Hogan of Maryland specifically &amp; almost did a Freudian slip, "...in your state(s)..." Hogan is dirty.
1335811083534102528 2020-12-07 12:59:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @LisaMarieBoothe That would be a big NO!
1335810477008408577 2020-12-07 12:56:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin @GuilloryTracey Yes, all will be well one way or another because it will be His way, not ours.
1335810038842023937 2020-12-07 12:55:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeachcatTt Prayers offered,  how tragic!
1335809338552635393 2020-12-07 12:52:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @Lawakenings Exactly. That's 1 of 2 storage locations for the original swine flu from which COVID was made.
1335732024980635648 2020-12-07 07:45:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @17HeartofGold17 So so sorry to hear this, it truly hurts my heart. Yes, certainly prayers offered.
1335730916115681280 2020-12-07 07:40:41 +0800 <Kganley123> Ppfffttt...Maryland is so corrupt it probably helped develop the "virus".
1335729379033280512 2020-12-07 07:34:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @PISDI94_96 Enjoy &amp; a very happy birthday to your son. Party like you're set free from Newsome in California!
1335662720000032768 2020-12-07 03:09:42 +0800 <Kganley123> I don't know where ya'll find this shit but it is just nasty. Good Lord save us. I'm real damn tired of these Noah flood reject people.
1335661945156820992 2020-12-07 03:06:37 +0800 <Kganley123> Have mercy on us I implore you, grant us some relief. We need to SEE justice. Blind faith only lasts so long. We need to SEE Truth upheld. Even the rocks are now crying out &amp; the earth groans. Thank you.
1335661944137687040 2020-12-07 03:06:37 +0800 <Kganley123> Dear @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I am imploring you on behalf of all Patriots &amp; white hats throughout the world: I have no doubt some measure of Justice is now occurring behind the scenes. But for reasons only you know, we are preventing from seeing it, therfore our frustration grows
1335627746169384961 2020-12-07 00:50:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Good thread!
1335625580574724098 2020-12-07 00:42:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @Haim44 So so cool. Israelite history is the key.
1335613414341656577 2020-12-06 23:53:47 +0800 <Kganley123> So don't do them, stop obeying.
1335612992914743298 2020-12-06 23:52:06 +0800 <Kganley123> Or ever.
1335612881904123908 2020-12-06 23:51:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Wish I got paid handsomely for ass sitting.
1335612361395195904 2020-12-06 23:49:36 +0800 <Kganley123> Amen!
1335611598413565952 2020-12-06 23:46:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Love the tree Tank! It was decorated with heart. RT-ing so others can enjoy your love expression.
1335611239087542273 2020-12-06 23:45:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh this is goood.
1335610116427501570 2020-12-06 23:40:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Spicy!
1335609953575346176 2020-12-06 23:40:02 +0800 <Kganley123> Americans! Get a grip on yourselves! Really. You should be highly ashamed &amp; embarrassed that you have &amp; are allowing a regime &amp; agenda from China to dictate your lives.What is wrong with you people?! You shame our 1776 Patriots, our Constitution, country. Take off the masks!!
1335608196082233354 2020-12-06 23:33:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @drdavidsamadi I use it when I state I have medical CS &amp; can't wear a mask. If they try to ask me what medical CS ( Common Sense) is I tell them they can't ask because of HIPAA laws.
1335601364592861184 2020-12-06 23:05:54 +0800 <Kganley123> Ya think?!
1335600284588904455 2020-12-06 23:01:36 +0800 <Kganley123> Should already have been a daily occurrence.
1335599981579812865 2020-12-06 23:00:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Now is that time.
1335598968676311042 2020-12-06 22:56:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @doqholliday Civil War. At least we'd go down fighting, rather than being weak sheep.
1335596414982782976 2020-12-06 22:46:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottFishman Trumplicans.
1335595331346546690 2020-12-06 22:41:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep.
1335595248794288130 2020-12-06 22:41:36 +0800 <Kganley123> Well lookee here...
1335595070204997632 2020-12-06 22:40:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Busted!
1335449705405267973 2020-12-06 13:03:15 +0800 <Kganley123> Love the sound effects!
1335449210464862213 2020-12-06 13:01:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @3days3nights I feel the same,  like their not real people. Behind a veil or something.
1335448889575411712 2020-12-06 13:00:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio Nice!
1335433596853620741 2020-12-06 11:59:15 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm good.
1335433247698763778 2020-12-06 11:57:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @annielaulainen @GuilloryTracey Whoa.
1335399056420401154 2020-12-06 09:42:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @SJPFISH Me!
1335394681388113922 2020-12-06 09:24:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @STR1KER @TANK_Patriot @GovHogan @LarryHogan No kidding, he AND his wife should be in GITMO.
1335393916913209344 2020-12-06 09:21:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Anyone who does is a jackals. He's had his 15 minutes of fame now he just needs to slink away to GITMO.
1335391709107089412 2020-12-06 09:12:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @MissILmom @realDonaldTrump Because in oder for President Trump to move forward at warp speed to rebuild this country,  he needs both the House &amp; Senate on his side to get bills passed.
1335391190867345408 2020-12-06 09:10:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @_SCA3_ Oh yes, it's also from the touch of God.
1335390948499488769 2020-12-06 09:09:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @GeorgeHaught Prayers up for you. My condolences.
1335364191755018243 2020-12-06 07:23:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @1Naasty @GenFlynn And I truly love each &amp; every one of you quirky ass beings! 💖
1335363899210678272 2020-12-06 07:22:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @dbongino I don't even know what that is.
1335363472482168833 2020-12-06 07:20:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @NancyTriplett @kimrunner Thank YOU! We need the help and are very tired. I have a slight second wind now to continue the spiritual battle but we need all the soldiers we can get.
1335362704471519233 2020-12-06 07:17:33 +0800 <Kganley123> Wearing masks &amp; closing businesses is for the weak minded.
1335362498506047488 2020-12-06 07:16:44 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm not being played,  I don't play reindeer games.  That's for the weak.
1335362201050181633 2020-12-06 07:15:33 +0800 <Kganley123> "Mexico can be gotten dirt cheap right now"
1335362199875829760 2020-12-06 07:15:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Me, my sons, &amp; their crew were sitting around work last week b.s.-ing at the end of the day. The topic turned to the S. border. Them: "Oh we solved that problem. Pres. Trump needs to buy Mexico, renovate/rehab/rebuild it, flip it, &amp; sell it back to Spain."@POTUS @realDonaldTrump
1335360345179791360 2020-12-06 07:08:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @ridgeisback Absolutely spot on righty-o.
1335360181853511681 2020-12-06 07:07:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Right?!
1335273173764358150 2020-12-06 01:21:47 +0800 <Kganley123> At this stage of the game, as I posted on Parler, of you're wearing a face coffee filter or diaper, YOU are the problem. YOU are supporting the Chinese communist agenda, YOU are weak &amp; bowing to Baal. Open your businesses, do not comply with evil. I have zero compassion for you.
1335265606317142017 2020-12-06 00:51:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Nothing, I love nothing about this perishable vessel. It contains my non-perishable Spirit that is its function &amp; will soon cease to exist.
1335265077461569537 2020-12-06 00:49:37 +0800 <Kganley123> We can, but don't.
1335264741489475584 2020-12-06 00:48:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel You too!
1334883913156608001 2020-12-04 23:35:00 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly! Get off your paranoid asses America!
1334882384987054081 2020-12-04 23:28:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Ol' Biden isn't long for it now. He'll be "No-Named" soon. First the boot with changing sides &amp; stories, then he'll conveniently disappear off the scene, have a heart attack or brain aneurysm and he gone. He not only has a monitor now but I'll bet good money on a kill switch too.
1334880734725644290 2020-12-04 23:22:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Right?!  Eveyone's like, "Oh, let's take the lazy boy chair approach &amp; let President Trump &amp; his family/team handle everything" .
1334879908082769920 2020-12-04 23:19:05 +0800 <Kganley123> #takeoffthemasks #openyourbusinesses #stopbeingsheep #takebackyourpower #trustGod #ballupAmerica !!!!!!!
1334878230386335746 2020-12-04 23:12:25 +0800 <Kganley123> 🤣 This is both funny &amp; sad. It's come to this.
1334706869932183553 2020-12-04 11:51:30 +0800 <Kganley123> So the strategy is for everyone to now claim themselves as homeless.
1334705920652181506 2020-12-04 11:47:43 +0800 <Kganley123> What Eric said. This is strategy to win people, check your moral platitudes at the door. We've got to keep the Senate.
1334699516692291584 2020-12-04 11:22:16 +0800 <Kganley123> This kid thinks he's something going up against "The Rudy". You got your 10 minutes of fame ignorant prick, now go back to your play pen.
1334695522754387969 2020-12-04 11:06:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Boom, put box blonde Karen right in her place.
1334694417731481607 2020-12-04 11:02:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @DrShayPhD Yes ma'am!
1334694308511793161 2020-12-04 11:01:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Thank you Tank!
1334694242581499904 2020-12-04 11:01:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Boom!!!
1334692498602541059 2020-12-04 10:54:23 +0800 <Kganley123> These creatures are sub-human.
1334690392558641153 2020-12-04 10:46:01 +0800 <Kganley123> Well this is taking Karen to a whole new level. I would have grabbed something out of the cart, swung it at the dickhead while kneeing him in the groin or running the inner sole of my boot down his shin. Or kicking out his knees from the front or sides.
1334688455368998913 2020-12-04 10:38:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Very very true. But Trump won. That is our confession.
1334688232328605699 2020-12-04 10:37:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @Hoosiers1986 Nope.
1334688198300090369 2020-12-04 10:37:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @SeanCordanon Amen.
1334687737102790656 2020-12-04 10:35:28 +0800 <Kganley123> His plane has been busy judging from reports by  https://t.co/g5pOQOX2KR who keeps regular tabs on all non-commercial flights of any consequence esp. military. GITMO flights have been hopping as well as to the overflow GITMO site in Honduras. Also to &amp; from black CIA sites.
1334686936020094977 2020-12-04 10:32:17 +0800 <Kganley123> As does Gen. McInerney.
1334686320724070400 2020-12-04 10:29:50 +0800 <Kganley123> You're absolutely correct. There is no conspiracy. It's a FACT.
1334685734825914369 2020-12-04 10:27:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Zero.This Patriot says zero. I balled up at the start of all this b.s. Being a feisty Irish comes in handy.
1334670347749060611 2020-12-04 09:26:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @Reckoning1720 Patriot
1334670282141835264 2020-12-04 09:26:06 +0800 <Kganley123> Well this is comforting,  lol.
1334667908148940800 2020-12-04 09:16:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Stop wearing the damn masks &amp; closing your businesses! There's more of us than them. You're empowering these freaks of nature with your compliance! Grow a set of balls America &amp; rub them all over the chins of these traitor LEO'S &amp; politicians!
1334667286603464706 2020-12-04 09:14:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @LLinWood We love you, you know that right? Sincerely. Not Hollywood superficially. If damn sure take a bitter bullet for you.
1334666010465501184 2020-12-04 09:09:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealMattCouch Sure did!
1334665923685306370 2020-12-04 09:08:47 +0800 <Kganley123> Homemade clam chowder. In Wyoming. It's what's for dinner. But nothing beats Maryland fresh clams. Bumble Bee canned sucks.
1334665494113107970 2020-12-04 09:07:05 +0800 <Kganley123> Everything. Absolutely everything. Some of it might piss me royally off &amp; frustrate the heck outta me, but by God it's ALL a lesson in some form that He has for me.
1334665061902635008 2020-12-04 09:05:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Ooh ooh ooh, pick me! I have the PERFECT solution for clearing the deficit: sell tickets to Patriots to participate in the firing squads.
1334529505575071745 2020-12-04 00:06:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Lets get this trending folks: #takeoffthemasks #masksaremuzzles #takebackyourpower
1334528921191137280 2020-12-04 00:04:23 +0800 <Kganley123> To be fair, with all the pedo pervs around I think this is a wise choice. At least for this year until they're all eradicated. This grandparent works STRONGLY caution against my kiddos sitting on any laps.
1334528113166884866 2020-12-04 00:01:11 +0800 <Kganley123> We are NOT Republicans! We are Constitutional Patriots, the Party of Trump.
1334518336416145409 2020-12-03 23:22:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @realCarone_ Don't worry what people think, worry about what GOD thinks &amp; what brings peace to your soul. Thank you for your courage, bravery, &amp; willingness. We're all in this together. ❤
1334196526202044417 2020-12-03 02:03:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Who would gladly trade some rah rah entertainment factor only Trump rallies for some substantial &amp; meaningful firings &amp; arrests right about now?
1334196205933326336 2020-12-03 02:02:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Swamp monsters need to go NOW! @POTUS needs to go all Apprentice on some asses!
1334158851059326977 2020-12-02 23:33:52 +0800 <Kganley123> He should have declared it a strip club.
1334158626475311106 2020-12-02 23:32:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @rabbitz_84 Happy birthday!
1334157964752478209 2020-12-02 23:30:20 +0800 <Kganley123> At this stage anyone donating any $$ anywhere except to Sidney Powell et al that are fighting the election legal battle, are dopes. Both political parties are worthless &amp; corrupt as hell. Synagogues of Satan.
1334157409732894721 2020-12-02 23:28:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @ArtValley818_ @InXVIIweTrust Good!
1334004296715669505 2020-12-02 13:19:43 +0800 <Kganley123> Sumpthins wrong with ol' Nader. He's looking &amp; moving kinda throw-uppy green.
1334003797253787648 2020-12-02 13:17:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Godspeed! And thank you!
1334000962982199296 2020-12-02 13:06:28 +0800 <Kganley123> But they're still on Trump's payroll. So what does that say?
1333999982538416129 2020-12-02 13:02:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Agreed. POS's don't deserve the uniform or respect.
1333999308635422721 2020-12-02 12:59:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @KayaJones @dbongino Been praying for you!
1333998042236665857 2020-12-02 12:54:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. But yet he still has a job.
1333995604242952193 2020-12-02 12:45:11 +0800 <Kganley123> She has my vote for whatever she wants! Amen!
1333993810167099393 2020-12-02 12:38:03 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly. Now it's like a Roman Holiday for the damn traitors.
1333993408881299457 2020-12-02 12:36:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. A big yep. And make the f**king arrests!!!
1333992634998611970 2020-12-02 12:33:23 +0800 <Kganley123> President Trump if you're reading this, you'd better pay attention. Your countrymen are fed up, your job is to defend us. Those "men in blue" you're so fond of, yea, they're dying this shit.
1333991265667432449 2020-12-02 12:27:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Dear God, are we STILL on that worn out topic?!
1333987688781815808 2020-12-02 12:13:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @MajorPatriot You can stop repeating this now, it's gotten tiresome.
1333984914857836544 2020-12-02 12:02:42 +0800 <Kganley123> It's not TOO deep for God, but it's much deeper than President Trump imagined i believe. Having grown up there i could have clued him in. DC is literally a city-town built on the swamp dredges of the Potomac and the people who work there are the same. Corruption has always ruled.
1333911210689892353 2020-12-02 07:09:50 +0800 <Kganley123> Not sure why this is such a surprise since it was quite obvious this summer when no arrests or convictions or indictments were made/unsealed.
1333910349255380992 2020-12-02 07:06:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Bill Barr is early career CIA, they never stop being CIA they just hide it to infiltrate.
1333910104077320192 2020-12-02 07:05:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Me too!
1333910039979982849 2020-12-02 07:05:11 +0800 <Kganley123> What??!! My gosh, does he have a pulse, did anyone check him for robotic seams?
1333849463668948994 2020-12-02 03:04:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Thank you Tank!
1333819146514034690 2020-12-02 01:04:00 +0800 <Kganley123> Happy December 1! #ditchthedamnmasks #takebackyourpower #openyourbusinesses
1333818479271526401 2020-12-02 01:01:21 +0800 <Kganley123> Too many 'shrooms honey, too many 'shrooms.
1333686168781635584 2020-12-01 16:15:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @PMGRANDS1 It's higher even than them. Think black pope in the Vatican. Of the Jesuits who also reside in the Vatican. Then 13 families. Same down through the centuries.
1333683083036426240 2020-12-01 16:03:20 +0800 <Kganley123> Beautiful! Congratulations!
1333682604441169922 2020-12-01 16:01:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Right?! Marie Antoinette, King Louis, didn't end well for them.
1333680950425731074 2020-12-01 15:54:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @SamsonStrong11 Inform please. I got nothing on a look up.
1333652280566943745 2020-12-01 14:00:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes they do!
1333650891606351873 2020-12-01 13:55:25 +0800 <Kganley123> Truth here! Stop wearing the damn masks &amp; open your businesses!
1333647572418715648 2020-12-01 13:42:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Painting things with a rather broad brush aren't you? Many of us didn't major in "Liberal Arts" neither did we plan the economic crashes that wreaked havoc on jobs. Neither did we keep raising tuition through the roof. We're sorry we're not as privileged as you.
1333635223947362305 2020-12-01 12:53:09 +0800 <Kganley123> 😂😂
1333635011929509891 2020-12-01 12:52:19 +0800 <Kganley123> What a fool. Another GITMO cell needed.
1333633307162988545 2020-12-01 12:45:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes, Congrats!
1333626965337669632 2020-12-01 12:20:20 +0800 <Kganley123> God &amp; the aliens must look down on us &amp; shake their heads. "Where the heck did we go wrong, they were doing so well &amp; then they shit all over themselves".
1333625224164622338 2020-12-01 12:13:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @Arcticwolff @def_dawn @RealJamesWoods Parler. He left Twitter along with many others.  Many of us have dual accounts. Get Parler, there's no censorship.
1333624031929532416 2020-12-01 12:08:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @BillFOXLA @SheilaKuehl @FOXLA I think "Sheila" is a dude.
1333623781009412098 2020-12-01 12:07:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheMikeClayton8 @FunkyHellyeah Yep. We are.
1333622991482093568 2020-12-01 12:04:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @thebradfordfile @FLPea5 Very excellent.
1333622533615095809 2020-12-01 12:02:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Ppfffttt...I accepted this about myself a long time ago. Mainly because my stinking ego gets in the way making everything my subjective opinion. And not sure if you've noticed,  but I'm not shy about sharing said subjective opinion. Not even to our President.
1333621694007713793 2020-12-01 11:59:24 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ @IminHisbook We love you CodeMonkey!
1333620749672693760 2020-12-01 11:55:38 +0800 <Kganley123> It's gorgeous!!
1333618672426860545 2020-12-01 11:47:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @Matthew97421238 @Rothbard1776 @SidneyPowell1 Not sure you've noticed, but we already ARE a Banana Republic.
1333618462938124288 2020-12-01 11:46:33 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes they do. Starting with Barr &amp; Durham. But at the end of the day, they are President Trump's employees so...buck stops with him.  Can he not keep track of his agency heads?
1333616354310582274 2020-12-01 11:38:10 +0800 <Kganley123> Great explanation, but despicable that you even had to provide one. Ms. Klacik you have a strong power &amp; will do very well in life.
1333612982509584384 2020-12-01 11:24:47 +0800 <Kganley123> That's what I believe too.
1333612837726420995 2020-12-01 11:24:12 +0800 <Kganley123> We're just one big ass basket of weirdness. We're "Special" &amp; we love each other because of &amp; in spite of it. I own my weirdness and flaunt it like a champ!
1333612004112695298 2020-12-01 11:20:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Two possible scenarios for the awol Barr &amp; Durham. 1) They are guilty of extreme dereliction of duty &amp; disobedience to our President &amp; need immediate firing/arrest 2) They're down in GITMO or Honduras (2nd GITMO) taking care of business.
1333436688383713280 2020-11-30 23:44:15 +0800 <Kganley123> Wyoming is beautiful this morning!
1333436030456713218 2020-11-30 23:41:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Nope.
1333435914375241728 2020-11-30 23:41:10 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh yes he did, he's a boot club member soon to be rope club.
1333435530193760257 2020-11-30 23:39:39 +0800 <Kganley123> How stunning is this?
1333429746181390337 2020-11-30 23:16:40 +0800 <Kganley123> It IS &amp; HAS BEEN an attempted coup for almost 4 years. Arrests must be made NOW, &amp; treason charges filed against all perps from the highest to the lowest, national &amp; international.
1333427244459409408 2020-11-30 23:06:43 +0800 <Kganley123> No kidding right?!
1333221845563162627 2020-11-30 09:30:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @realTrumpForce @darkom56 Not now Sir, we're too close to the winning!
1333221701434236934 2020-11-30 09:29:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @Absolute1776 @pmgossett This is all what I thought too except didn't make the Old Dominion Rd/Great Falls connection.
1333218095612063744 2020-11-30 09:15:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Congratulations!
1333217774991147010 2020-11-30 09:14:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @timMonr46087308 Beautiful!
1333217165005053953 2020-11-30 09:11:56 +0800 <Kganley123> @deedeeprospertx @fit4aqueen3 @KellyO He's in the "boot club", probably got a tracking implant in exchange for singing.  HRC, No Name wore them as well.
1333216609519845376 2020-11-30 09:09:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @Time4U2Know Beautiful. And frigid. 🥶🥶🥶🥶
1333215836614533122 2020-11-30 09:06:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @NottaLemming Yes, and I've been totally conflicted about this ever since studying it. It goes against the grain of our founders design &amp; purpose of 3 branches of gov't. But, in extreme circumstances, such as we have today of wholesale coup &amp; treason, it's useful.
1333213795678777344 2020-11-30 08:58:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @FireBallNPizza Try Coconut water?
1333213154038280194 2020-11-30 08:56:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @Harleysdad65 "Pretty" soon fades. No matter the amount of spackle &amp; anti-aging/wrinkle cream.
1333212790782234627 2020-11-30 08:54:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @IPOT1776 I've missed you as well as others. But glad we have trails as to where to find you.
1333206851551252485 2020-11-30 08:30:57 +0800 <Kganley123> Well this doesn't bode well for the rest of this evening's reading; I'm down to my last 3 pieces of Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark. 😔
1333205734331351041 2020-11-30 08:26:31 +0800 <Kganley123> This is all "Trump Speak" speaking superficially around topics without really divulging anything. Tidbits, stating the obvious, but not selling the farm. He knows good &amp; well what's up with Barr, Durham and their MIA status. He's not a babysitter but he keeps an eye on things.
1333203210798993408 2020-11-30 08:16:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @realTrumpForce @darkom56 Yes we are! Got a second wind thanks to lots of chocolate!
1333200762558586880 2020-11-30 08:06:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Time for brand new political parties, not just new names.
1333200174131286016 2020-11-30 08:04:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @CheriseGuilfoil Amen!
1333199053769740290 2020-11-30 07:59:58 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm sorry sweetie, bless your heart, but President Trump doesn't need nor want your help. After all those years of bj-ing your way "to the top" you're still going to be relegated to the Island of Misfit Toys.
1333198298190995457 2020-11-30 07:56:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @SteelhorseQ This might sound weird, but can Vicks Rub under a wrap help at all? I use it for deep muscle soreness or on my feet. I hike long distances, used to do manual labor &amp; it sure helps me.
1333195512468553729 2020-11-30 07:45:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @GoJackFlynn St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness &amp; snares of the devil, do thou oh Prince of the Heavenly host cast into hell Satan &amp; ALL his evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. Pray morning &amp; night.
1333194660261421056 2020-11-30 07:42:31 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel If we don't let them go, God will remove them for us. Been there,  done that.  He wants His own sequestered to Himself.
1333193964602605568 2020-11-30 07:39:45 +0800 <Kganley123> @DJFreedomRocket 👏👏👏 I'm sooo excited!
1333193725934145537 2020-11-30 07:38:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @EvanAKilgore Amen!
1333193560040951809 2020-11-30 07:38:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @40_head So in lieu of popcorn, I'd like a box of chocolates for this next round.
1333193213117562881 2020-11-30 07:36:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @40_head I'm thinking another more insidious disease will be unleashed, like smallpox. Wiped out entire populations of Native Americans in the winter.  BUT if Biden starts sporting a boot as his new fashion accessory, their gig could be up. Means he sang like a canary.
1333189952578830336 2020-11-30 07:23:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @LionelMedia TB test?
1333188259585744896 2020-11-30 07:17:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @VFuska Hope so! Hoping this is why they've pro-actively supplied the "dog tripping" story.
1333188002588213248 2020-11-30 07:16:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @MajorPatriot Confirmation please!?
1333187763844259840 2020-11-30 07:15:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @MajorPatriot No name = J McC***. His name isn't said because he's a traitor. He, Hilliary, &amp; now Basement Biden (plus others) share a fondness for ankle boots to cover their trackers. They are offered a couple of traitor earned death choices in exchange for giving up information.
1333186337797619712 2020-11-30 07:09:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @SteelhorseQ It sucks. Hard. I realize long ago though my obligation is to continue loving them even as they moved out of my life or continued to spitefullly abuse me (not physically). It's hardest when it's family.  But Jesus suffered this too.
1333184861595607046 2020-11-30 07:03:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Good question. Rhetorical?
1333182174619549696 2020-11-30 06:52:54 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly. When I tell people this, they look shocked.
1333175550093901824 2020-11-30 06:26:35 +0800 <Kganley123> They're true. Stuffs been happening all along.
1333175321957318661 2020-11-30 06:25:40 +0800 <Kganley123> I think allot of these interrogations are happening right now &amp; have been. Hence the black eyes, boots, non-comms from many Hollywood types etc.
1333174244549672965 2020-11-30 06:21:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @EricMMatheny What a horse!
1333173484919291905 2020-11-30 06:18:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @disclosetv Ok, ya'll are cracking me up! The best memes &amp; responses go to Anons! Witty, humorous, &amp; TRUTH!
1333171993093423104 2020-11-30 06:12:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @kimKBaltimore Your time is not yet up, don't give up,  just have fun waiting out this storm.  It'll be over soon. Thank you for your willingness to fight on behalf of Maryland &amp; this country. God knows we need it.
1333171431740346371 2020-11-30 06:10:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Notice our President used the word "major" twice, &amp; that also happens to be the "name" of Biden's dog. Hmmmm...
1333167510443552768 2020-11-30 05:54:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Check out  https://t.co/tSiAXJ3tMk site for military aircraft tracking updates/info, plus his blog videos (very informative). May answer the Biden boot question for you as well as many others.
1333166862771712001 2020-11-30 05:52:03 +0800 <Kganley123> Think McCain boot, Hilliary boot. Tracking or kill switch implants? Maybe something along the lines of what Monkey Werx (.com) speaks of in his blog vids? Plausible.
1333165882105708544 2020-11-30 05:48:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @MajorPatriot No!
1333165800576880641 2020-11-30 05:47:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @ACTforAmerica Supernatural.
1333165638051721218 2020-11-30 05:47:11 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley I've been asking God for 1.5 years for 5 specific things, big things. They aren't needs but purely wants for my next life stage. I would like to have those prayers answered.  Bigely.
1333163766297501696 2020-11-30 05:39:45 +0800 <Kganley123> Wouldn't it also be seditious treason? Or accessory to?
1333163528765673472 2020-11-30 05:38:48 +0800 <Kganley123> Winning!
1333091686864470017 2020-11-30 00:53:20 +0800 <Kganley123> He's already won.
1333091525815799808 2020-11-30 00:52:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley Clear your sphere of influence, no negative vibes or energy allowed in!
1333091222601166850 2020-11-30 00:51:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin Well only God can do that so...
1333089977941463040 2020-11-30 00:46:33 +0800 <Kganley123> Perhaps God doesn't want us in churches right now. Many are cabal institutions &amp; sold out to ds. He's tucking His faithful away under the shadow of His wings, we don't need a building in which to pray &amp; praise. All of nature is His church &amp; even the rocks are now crying out.
1333088991638261760 2020-11-30 00:42:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @broussard_troy @SwampSwag I got you over on Parler. It's an honor to be kicked off FB, etc. It means you're doing the right thing &amp; are a threat.
1333088185920864261 2020-11-30 00:39:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @no_silenced 70 Ford Mustang
1333087954307170305 2020-11-30 00:38:30 +0800 <Kganley123> Questions like this from President Trump may be rhetorical. They're his employees he'd bloody well better know where they are &amp; my betting $ says he does. He baiting US to ask the question. Maybe they're at GITMO doing business. Lots of birds in &amp; out of there lately.
1333087175307497474 2020-11-30 00:35:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Or Wray, or Haspell. But our President has the power and obligation of oath to deal with this treason &amp; insurrection. And should NOW!
1333086845408735236 2020-11-30 00:34:06 +0800 <Kganley123> Great analogy &amp; true!
1333086513890877440 2020-11-30 00:32:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ And there were US casualties I believe.
1333077309033615362 2020-11-29 23:56:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! Perfect! This is perfect!!!! 👏👏👏👏

1332893799811477504 2020-11-29 11:47:00 +0800 <Kganley123> Must must listen &amp; RT! Explains The Kraken, first Gen. Flynn interview plus Gen. McInerney. Important info to hold President Trump accountable to his oath of office to defend this country against enemies foreign AND domestic NOW! JUSTICE NOW.  https://t.co/A8qCPONneg
1332885361341599744 2020-11-29 11:13:28 +0800 <Kganley123> The siezed server in Frankfurt Germany was in a CIA facility from which our Spec. Ops did the extraction.
1332884244314480642 2020-11-29 11:09:02 +0800 <Kganley123> So "The Kraken" is the 305th Military Intelligence group per Lt. Gen. McInerney. It's their nickname. They're the ones working on the election fraud cases with Sidney Powell &amp; Linn Wood. Other groups as well are assisting.  He also stated FBI, CIA, DOJ are working for deep state.

1332742363593146369 2020-11-29 01:45:15 +0800 <Kganley123> stage I experienced earlier this Spring/Summer. I'm thrilled for firings currently being done but seriously we need justice too. I'm doing my part to red pill folks here in WY, but they want justice asap too. It's how we roll out here.
1332742362506743816 2020-11-29 01:45:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn I realize you've listened to me rant for months about the need for justice. But we've reached a point in this game whereby even the rocks are crying out for it. I've long since given up,  but I'm seeing others now phase into the frustration
1332703784934334466 2020-11-28 23:11:57 +0800 <Kganley123> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1332089870957780992 2020-11-27 06:32:28 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, time to start posting your most awkward Thanksgiving moments.
1332088391173763072 2020-11-27 06:26:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @josh_hammer Too many trips to "the Island".
1332088129851822080 2020-11-27 06:25:33 +0800 <Kganley123> And for today's fashion expo, HRC is sporting the "fresh from prison cell look" .  👏👏👏
1332087701869260801 2020-11-27 06:23:51 +0800 <Kganley123> Wow. Look like sh*t much?
1332087295357251585 2020-11-27 06:22:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @lex31555 Hopefully. And firing squad.
1332085659494846464 2020-11-27 06:15:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @CindyKendrick11 Nope, the greatest insult is an over the top compliment. Pouring ashes on their head.
1332055000369885184 2020-11-27 04:13:55 +0800 <Kganley123> We love you @FLOTUS !
1331960577032290305 2020-11-26 21:58:42 +0800 <Kganley123> Twist those knives &amp; thumb screws baby!
1331959735239675908 2020-11-26 21:55:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Happy Beautiful Thanksgiving everyone! We're at the part in the Patriot movie when Mel is knees on the ground, almost beaten, Brit officer thinks to slice off his head from behind. But Mel turns at the last moment &amp; impales the Brit instead.
1331959139921063937 2020-11-26 21:53:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ Same to you Ron, thank you for everything!
1331959000519229443 2020-11-26 21:52:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @RoscoeBDavis1 @SidneyPowell1 Thank you Sir, your service &amp; Texas fortitude are very appreciated. Sadly, many LEO's are caving to their liberal masters &amp; forgetting their oaths. Illegal orders are not to be obeyed.
1331958079437426688 2020-11-26 21:48:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @RoscoeBDavis1 Can't access the link, Twitter locked it up.
1331957528800837632 2020-11-26 21:46:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @tyler_casper Off.
1331834408660176897 2020-11-26 13:37:21 +0800 <Kganley123> I'll bet a few people will be dry choking on their turkey tomorrow. Enjoy it, they don't "do" Thanksgiving where you're going.
1331832501770153984 2020-11-26 13:29:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeholdIsrael Thank you &amp; same to you!
1331832227202678784 2020-11-26 13:28:41 +0800 <Kganley123> Ahhh...I remember those halcyon early Covid days when the country bought the first lockdown " for the good of the plan" I hated it. I bitterly complained to @POTUS that @FLOTUS could get her hair, nails pedi done but we peasants couldn't. I was pissed. Now, it may prove worth it.
1331830993527791616 2020-11-26 13:23:47 +0800 <Kganley123> Been thinking the same thing.  I sure could use some of their cheese.
1331830099188977665 2020-11-26 13:20:14 +0800 <Kganley123> Has anyone besides me noticed the similarity in names between Camel Harris &amp; Camel Parker Bowles? And both stole their positions &amp; slept/bj'd their way to the top.
1331829287276617730 2020-11-26 13:17:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @LionelMedia Used toilet paper.
1331829069084725249 2020-11-26 13:16:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump knows how much I've complained about lack of Justice. I think time has finally come. What a relief &amp; release. Maybe I can sleep again.  I pray General Flynn has the BEST peaceful night sleep EVER tonight!
1331828400026128385 2020-11-26 13:13:29 +0800 <Kganley123> Amen to this!
1331827125096128515 2020-11-26 13:08:25 +0800 <Kganley123> What I've said, but ants will be ants &amp; keep following the line until 1 ant breaks rank. Then many follow to check out the new path.
1331823975417085954 2020-11-26 12:55:54 +0800 <Kganley123> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1331823810220228608 2020-11-26 12:55:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @AUMindyT @RobTurchetta Is this a real tweet from her?
1331823414949027841 2020-11-26 12:53:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @JosephJFlynn1 No Sirs &amp; family, it's for YOU! But thank you for being so gracious and generous.
1331823072081444869 2020-11-26 12:52:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @w_terrence A noose?
1331821724644491265 2020-11-26 12:46:57 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm with you there.
1331821454892023809 2020-11-26 12:45:53 +0800 <Kganley123> With aggression!
1331821358108479488 2020-11-26 12:45:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @Heyokaphoenix Happy birthday! You look 40! I'm 59 &amp; look 70. Life got ALL over my face.
1331754750291787777 2020-11-26 08:20:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @Phaethon314 Could be an energy point marker. The desert has many areas of " high energy" or magnetism. Have the metal tested for its composition, that will tell you allot.
1331753979491991553 2020-11-26 08:17:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @CheriseGuilfoil No.
1331753913788166146 2020-11-26 08:17:30 +0800 <Kganley123> I want to be there so much!
1331746562020524033 2020-11-26 07:48:17 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! You're pathetic.
1331744842028699648 2020-11-26 07:41:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly.
1331742630175141888 2020-11-26 07:32:40 +0800 <Kganley123> But behaving banana.
1331740845305851904 2020-11-26 07:25:34 +0800 <Kganley123> So, Thanksgiving tomorrow. There are many of us who's lives are upside down, in chaos &amp; a train wreck. Not much to be happy about,  BUT focus on others &amp; Jesus, Infinite Wisdom. I'm trying hard 😔 We'll all find our "Thanksgiving".
1331739177814134784 2020-11-26 07:18:57 +0800 <Kganley123> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1331739096872480768 2020-11-26 07:18:37 +0800 <Kganley123> EXONERATION! Get it right please.
1331738487867932672 2020-11-26 07:16:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Good for him,  don't give them the time of day or show his hand.  "Let's finish this".
1331673290683781121 2020-11-26 02:57:08 +0800 <Kganley123> "Begin"? You mean Continue don't you?
1331615000205479938 2020-11-25 23:05:30 +0800 <Kganley123> Where I "worked" yesterday.  Southfork Valley, Shoshone National Forest. Enlarge photos to see frozen waterfalls I used to climb, tons of them in this valley. Plus elk, deer, bighorn sheep, grizzlies.  https://t.co/HbGHByflUU
1331611042523168769 2020-11-25 22:49:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @WINDOCTORRX @Faithforever113 And IRS.
1331610923136479234 2020-11-25 22:49:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Wheat from the chaf brother, wheat from the chaf. I want to hear, "Well done my good &amp; faithful servant".
1331610653480534017 2020-11-25 22:48:14 +0800 <Kganley123> Sounds like he was a tad controlling. "I want my way or else!" "Everything has to be my way!". I had a boyfriend like that, delegitimized all my thoughts, opinions, dreams, goals, etc. Kicked him to the curb.
1331608955047485440 2020-11-25 22:41:29 +0800 <Kganley123> Already did
1331608765532041216 2020-11-25 22:40:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly.
1331302587895672832 2020-11-25 02:24:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @Nick_Clamorgan @gbroh10 Highly suspect. Soros wouldn't be anywhere near the states right now,  especially Philly.
1331300803508719616 2020-11-25 02:17:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @SusanPMarlowe1 Howdy howdy howdy!
1331300328881278976 2020-11-25 02:15:07 +0800 <Kganley123> We all know @realDonaldTrump won the landslide re-election. Relax in that knowledge. Everything else from here is legal formality &amp; enduring various forms of the demons temper tantrums until the hammer falls. We're like the Spartan 300 against their last gasps of life.
1331219604392222721 2020-11-24 20:54:21 +0800 <Kganley123> 😅😅😅
1331218841351798794 2020-11-24 20:51:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, I'm sure she's not the only one,  bud so far the most visible.
1331118728256184321 2020-11-24 14:13:30 +0800 <Kganley123> I have to say, during all this 4 years of POTUS, Patriots have been making some dank memes of him.  Biblical in scope. Thank you!
1331117386091544576 2020-11-24 14:08:10 +0800 <Kganley123> Look at her eyes, she's totally possessed. Comey eyes.
1331116115599134720 2020-11-24 14:03:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @Melissa30985062 @EllenMadrid4 @LLinWood Hold the line. I'm frustrated too. But those that stood at the foot of the cross were too. They didn't understand the process as we now don't either. And then came Resurrection Sunday!
1331115308052934656 2020-11-24 13:59:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Good!
1331115215140753409 2020-11-24 13:59:32 +0800 <Kganley123> And frickin masks, social distancing, lockdowns?
1331114213025013762 2020-11-24 13:55:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @AngieBurley @EllenMadrid4 @LLinWood Hang in there, the wheels are turning. POTUS is golfing which means he's relaxed &amp; not worried. Which means we can be the same way. I want him to golf ALLOT.
1331104076658925570 2020-11-24 13:15:17 +0800 <Kganley123> No kidding! Along with Durham!
1331102384114733062 2020-11-24 13:08:33 +0800 <Kganley123> FLOTUS you are gorgeous as always but was hoping to see Barron assisting too?
1331099667812155392 2020-11-24 12:57:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @MrMichaelBurkes @lebron_family07 Yes, I'll forgive them,  just won't forget them.
1331099541450354693 2020-11-24 12:57:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @ImAwakeRU72 I like watching Dry Bar stand up on YouTube. Lots of clean funny talent.
1331096410150690816 2020-11-24 12:44:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @dbongino @MikkiSm56095348 Sorry but Special Councils solve nothing. It's all bloated hot air politicians jerking off to each other.
1331095846067208199 2020-11-24 12:42:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! Yea, ok.
1331093826400710656 2020-11-24 12:34:33 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep!
1331093243379949569 2020-11-24 12:32:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @RattlerGator @EllenMadrid4 Excellent thread, especially the end! Keep 'em coming!
1331090967412129799 2020-11-24 12:23:11 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrevDon Hillbillies for sure! Granny &amp; I can find some trouble now!
1331090635214835713 2020-11-24 12:21:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Really ugly tranny dudes in PA. Trannies don't age well.  🤮
1331089439523696642 2020-11-24 12:17:07 +0800 <Kganley123> Guess what the new popular wedding dance will be instead of the macarana? The TRUMP dance!
1331089181255241729 2020-11-24 12:16:05 +0800 <Kganley123> I love it!
1330885766864486403 2020-11-23 22:47:48 +0800 <Kganley123> I hope he enjoyed his R&amp; R &amp; gets lots more!
1330885643904315393 2020-11-23 22:47:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Hold these scum accountable people, make their lives miserable like they're making ours.
1330883590817628160 2020-11-23 22:39:09 +0800 <Kganley123> Please contribute to Sidney's legal defense fund. It takes lots of $$ to fight this battle. A case before the Supreme Court costs $10,000 out of the gate.
1330882676241301504 2020-11-23 22:35:31 +0800 <Kganley123> @CraftyNSparkly So sorry Anita, prayers for you, your family &amp; mom. Deep condolences.
1330882410452422656 2020-11-23 22:34:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Can someone please make Sidney Powell's posts by proxy on her behalf so we can keep up on status with her &amp; cases?

1330880065492504580 2020-11-23 22:25:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Sadly yes. I sure wish SOMEONE would end this sh*t show occurring in our country NOW!
1330674221773570050 2020-11-23 08:47:11 +0800 <Kganley123> @DineshDSouza Yea, what gives with the confusing Sidney Powell message?
1330673996656852993 2020-11-23 08:46:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Hmmmm...I need my PF Flyer decoder ring to figure this one out.
1330672132364255233 2020-11-23 08:38:53 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley Thank you for the praise report Kirstie, it helps reinforce our future prayers!

1330514587712569344 2020-11-22 22:12:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Biden supporters here are undercover, they don't dare show themselves. They'll get eaten alive.
1330513950165917696 2020-11-22 22:10:20 +0800 <Kganley123> 😭😭😭😭
1330513498271571970 2020-11-22 22:08:32 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm channeling my Patron Saint Joan D'Arc these days. Because she was bad assery before it was a thing.
1330512447476805632 2020-11-22 22:04:21 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. And the Christ within.
1330512213375848450 2020-11-22 22:03:26 +0800 <Kganley123> I, thank God, have been blessed with hyper sensitive intuition &amp; common sense. But math uh uh. It's all algebra to me. 😆😆 Who decided that replacing numbers with letters &amp; symbols in equations was " a great idea"?
1330507694671740928 2020-11-22 21:45:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @rickyschroder13 Hi Kyle!
1330506854015840256 2020-11-22 21:42:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh I want one of these!
1330506081504813060 2020-11-22 21:39:04 +0800 <Kganley123> Jail time! I hope those stripes on Abrams' prison pj's run horizontally to enhance her oompah loompah figure for extra humiliation.
1330505181549641728 2020-11-22 21:35:29 +0800 <Kganley123> So the press is now trying to Non-person our President by not reporting or printing his speeches, appearances, plus big tech censoring him.  What say ( do) you America?! Anytime I meet a dem they get bitch slapped &amp; knees to the groin. Because they've earned it.
1330504316227112960 2020-11-22 21:32:03 +0800 <Kganley123> I want my President @realDonaldTrump to enjoy all the golf he wants. He's bloody well earned it, &amp; frankly regular exercise keeps the brain synapses sharply firing. Plus endorphins are fun! Go big @POTUS !
1330502421290704898 2020-11-22 21:24:31 +0800 <Kganley123> You people are fools, IT'S A FLU!! Too bad you can't put forth all that false emotion towards all the babies you support murdering daily. HYPOCRITES! How's our President's stock market treating you these days btw?
1330500632193757184 2020-11-22 21:17:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Wouldn't we all. But it's like that elusive early morning dream that seems SO REAL, aaannnd then you wake up.
1330357218642837511 2020-11-22 11:47:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @greta @realDonaldTrump Seriously Greta? I think our President has other higher priorities. Besides,  Bush Sr. did it along with others. As he did 9/11. Dig on that for a while to see what you come up with.
1330352605352980481 2020-11-22 11:29:12 +0800 <Kganley123> her inquisitors.
1330352603926937600 2020-11-22 11:29:12 +0800 <Kganley123> St. Joan D'Arc was pretty bad ass for a 14 yr old milk maid. Organized &amp; headed up the armies of France &amp; got back the crown from England. Burned at the stake by the Church for doing this because of her gender. They said she was a heretic but she knew dogma &amp; doctrine better than
1330350846970896384 2020-11-22 11:22:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @martingeddes Best investments ever!
1330350183842910208 2020-11-22 11:19:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Really cool kitty &amp; story.
1330349005663039493 2020-11-22 11:14:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @cvpayne Wear this insult &amp; others like a huge medal because it legitimizes our position and your belonging on the side of Truth. Have a very happy, blessed, healthy, safe, fun, pie-filled Thanksgiving Charles!
1330345706242990081 2020-11-22 11:01:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealJamesWoods We're with you!
1330345131266826246 2020-11-22 10:59:30 +0800 <Kganley123> According to centuries old Catholic prophecies, Germany ignites in fire followed by France. The "country of the North" experiences debilitating difficulties but "the Lion" resolves them.Then helps Germany, France, Europe recover. Rome burns, false pope flees.

1330341731905146880 2020-11-22 10:46:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @Beer_Parade @timallensblues @BayArea_650 @SidneyPowell1 Supreme Court doesn't use jurors.
1330341458621071360 2020-11-22 10:44:54 +0800 <Kganley123> Aren't we all.
1330338585019486208 2020-11-22 10:33:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @Johnheretohelp Ol "Harry" is a political hack lightweight. Fancies himself better than he is. Ran a small commercial RE company in Maryland, &amp; thinks that qualifies him to run a country. He can't stand in Trump's shadow.
1330336824854720512 2020-11-22 10:26:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @martingeddes Thank you,  how sweet &amp; wonderful.
1330154495427432453 2020-11-21 22:21:59 +0800 <Kganley123> He, Soros, &amp; higher ups.
1330152446174302209 2020-11-21 22:13:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump I hope he comes out doing 1-arm push ups!
1330114737661734912 2020-11-21 19:44:00 +0800 <Kganley123> non-tweet, Durham Barr non- reports at end of summer,  zero arrests, etc. We're being used as pawns in one great huge AI game with fake "clues".
1330114735799414784 2020-11-21 19:44:00 +0800 <Kganley123> This is so good. Explains the entire, "you're watching a movie" rhetoric. But we're actually in an AI game where it's playing us. Which makes total sense,  hence the many "proofs" that never panned out: Election 2020+ protected, 10 or 3 days darkness, "my fellow Americans"
1330103937945505794 2020-11-21 19:01:05 +0800 <Kganley123> How true this is!
1330103795821535235 2020-11-21 19:00:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Do it!
1329942448445956097 2020-11-21 08:19:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Huh. That we know about.
1329942305252380673 2020-11-21 08:18:49 +0800 <Kganley123> Get him Scott!
1329941501317562369 2020-11-21 08:15:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @ChuckCallesto F**k Mitt Romney.
1329941351215943681 2020-11-21 08:15:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @8Notables Me too, I've been crying inside all day, feeling hopeless &amp; lost. I just have this sinking feeling in the goal of waking others up, Trump overplayed the hand &amp; we're seriously losing trying to play catch up &amp; spin rhetoric in our favor. Like hollow cheerleading.
1329939880244199425 2020-11-21 08:09:11 +0800 <Kganley123> My Friday night date: Bottle of Argentinean high mountain Malbec. Because if I can't beat 'em, I can at least get drunk over it. Because waking people up is more important than the sanity of supporters.
1329939106814517249 2020-11-21 08:06:06 +0800 <Kganley123> What a f**king farce.
1329938779709161474 2020-11-21 08:04:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley That's a frickin' fantastic plan! I'm communing with a bottle of Malbec. Sometimes drunk is the best option.
1329938358278098950 2020-11-21 08:03:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep, even the good stuff.

1329804932313010176 2020-11-20 23:12:57 +0800 <Kganley123> Hey @MittRomney why don't you &amp; your magic Mormon underwear go join your traitor son in Ukraine?
1329804401217716224 2020-11-20 23:10:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @CodeMonkeyZ You look like the rest of us out here in Wyoming, which is fine &amp; dandy with us!
1329804017522802689 2020-11-20 23:09:18 +0800 <Kganley123> I believe she's a tad busy @TuckerCarlson &amp; doesn't have to bow to your requests. Quit being childish.
1329797874310291456 2020-11-20 22:44:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Amen Tank!
1329525116749791232 2020-11-20 04:41:03 +0800 <Kganley123> Wow! After that news conference! Close FBI, IRS, DOJ, CIA, NSA, &amp; just hire the legal dream team. All we need, less bloat &amp; more actionable substance! Go Team Trump. Kraken baby!
1329497751256633345 2020-11-20 02:52:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh I've been praying this for sure!

1329496373943697408 2020-11-20 02:46:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @PrincessTiger1 @richardgibb8 Me neither. It's all too fanciful &amp; "out there". I defer on the side of sound reason. But I confess the thought of it being true is nice &amp; tempting.
1329495938981761026 2020-11-20 02:45:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @SamsonStrong11 Increased &amp; enabled it.
1329495852541300736 2020-11-20 02:44:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Good! Let's hope it passes!

1329303306422763521 2020-11-19 13:59:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha!
1329300745733083137 2020-11-19 13:49:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @GroveKilosdad73 @KatDelT I would LOVE to move to Florida, I've been praying for over 1.5 years.  My stuff is in storage waiting for God to move my mountain..
1329300408796233730 2020-11-19 13:48:09 +0800 <Kganley123> The power team! Thank you all so much!
1329300065702146049 2020-11-19 13:46:47 +0800 <Kganley123> Wrong. It's AMERICANS fault for complying with illegal mandates from OUR servants. They only have power over us that we give them.  I don't give them s**t.
1329299016723566592 2020-11-19 13:42:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheBettyTrump We love him too!

1329296646199394306 2020-11-19 13:33:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Truth.
1329296548107206656 2020-11-19 13:32:48 +0800 <Kganley123> Mark of the beast.
1329296239406432257 2020-11-19 13:31:35 +0800 <Kganley123> What a sh*t head Graham is.
1329292976254713856 2020-11-19 13:18:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @FREEDOMWWGIWGA Too funny,  I'm currently eating popcorn. Synchronicity.
1329292564332122123 2020-11-19 13:16:59 +0800 <Kganley123> @MrMichaelBurkes Nope, I just want arrests.
1329292307888107522 2020-11-19 13:15:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @MichaelBarden8 Who is that?
1329291765468127232 2020-11-19 13:13:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @tyler_casper I like it if it's clean &amp; not scraggly.
1329287996026150913 2020-11-19 12:58:49 +0800 <Kganley123> Attention John Q Public: A mandate is NOT a law. It is an order. It is not a legislated law on the books. Any elected official CANNOT order us to do anything. THEY work FOR US not vice versus ergo they have no power to give us orders, we have power to give THEM orders.
1329285901449535489 2020-11-19 12:50:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @RepJayapal On what planet?
1329284015707152387 2020-11-19 12:43:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Tank, she sounds like a troll. They purposely seek out Patriot accounts or positive oriented accounts in order to insult &amp; denigrate. They are sick unhappy mean spirited people. Don't worry, we know you are genuine love &amp; light. Ignore the dark souled ones.
1329281737663213569 2020-11-19 12:33:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Tank, what are you upset about,  I don't understand?
1329146233999429634 2020-11-19 03:35:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Me too!
1329145997981753344 2020-11-19 03:34:34 +0800 <Kganley123> @PaddyMrs Hi Mrs. Paddy, yes there are many who care only for numbers. Like those high school cheerleaders desperate for popularity. I think they feel it's their way of building an army but that isn't how it works. Because the more they build, the faster Twatter removes.
1328805056301330433 2020-11-18 04:59:48 +0800 <Kganley123> Love how all the deep staters are now calling for canceling student debt. Don't fall for it, it's part of their NWO economic communist reset. They're also co-opting a plan OUR legitimate President discussed under NESARA.
1328804262231490562 2020-11-18 04:56:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin Look, I don't know anything about "God's plan or the Kraken". All I know is something positive &amp; substantive better happen to stop all this b.s. because allot of us are starting to take matters into our own hands. And we ain't stopping until all the deep state is flushed.
1328530794403381249 2020-11-17 10:49:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @KrystalGoolsby2 Deep breaths. YouTube some 432 or 444 hz meditative tones. Relax for 20 minutes, eyes closed, empty your mind. Then YouTube evening gratitude prayers &amp; recite them.  Drink lots of water.  Sing praise &amp; worship songs,  the demons can't stand them. Speak scripture out loud.

1328526404632285187 2020-11-17 10:32:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly.
1328526089686290433 2020-11-17 10:31:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley Howdy Christie! How ya doin'? 😉
1328524857491877889 2020-11-17 10:26:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Contradiction: When Godless humanoids believe themselves to be God. Humorous &amp; illogical.
1328521919990099969 2020-11-17 10:14:43 +0800 <Kganley123> instituting global communism &amp; NWO paradigms. This isn't about just us,  it's about THE WORLD. Dark to Light.
1328521918895439873 2020-11-17 10:14:42 +0800 <Kganley123> This is what MUST be understood. It isn't just about THIS election. What Our President is trying to demonstrate is that the corrupt demons have been using Dominion &amp; Smartmatic for YEARS worldwide in order to turn countries socialist/communist via vote changing /stealing thereby
1328520348782923776 2020-11-17 10:08:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @dwhcosmos You're just now discovering this?
1328518045317300226 2020-11-17 09:59:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Yes sweetie, you are sad. And very criminally demented.
1328517559595855872 2020-11-17 09:57:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Too funny,  I never thought of this but so true!
1328516788695363584 2020-11-17 09:54:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @ajmtx72 Oh my gosh how sad! I am so sorry &amp; offer my sincere condolences with prayer.
1328516403746336768 2020-11-17 09:52:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth I've lost track &amp; not even sure who's keeping track.
1328199907019161600 2020-11-16 12:55:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @DrShayPhD Keep that beautiful smile! Prayers offered,  God's got this,  confess it, believe it!

Just start reciting them in Jesus Holy &amp; Mighty Name. You'll literally feel the cloud lift off. The devil can't stand our praising God. Do it every morning &amp; evening as protection.
1328185564802076672 2020-11-16 11:58:09 +0800 <Kganley123> Because the police suck. I'm so sorry &amp; hope you're okay?
1328184884955807744 2020-11-16 11:55:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @BardsFM To be fair, some of us have been fighting this battle since before you were born. So we're entitled to our battle fatigue. We don't like false promises, lived through tons of them. So when "the good guys" dish them out we get pissed. But we hang on because God. Not a human.
1328183351769874433 2020-11-16 11:49:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @marklevinshow @DJNazSD Yep, they're saying Wyoming is 5th in the country for cases. We are the least populous state,  how can we have that many cases? If there were that many, we'd know about it.  I haven't heard a word.
1328182684024066048 2020-11-16 11:46:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @Shutterfly777 @DomoLJub45 @PatriotPirate74 Yep, I pointed this out when he announced it on the tarmac. I grew up in MD, met him at many Rep. fundraisers for the Senator I was working for. He came to be seen,  chat to a select few &amp; leave. But was never boots on the ground involved like many of us trying to fix our state.

1328175361058775040 2020-11-16 11:17:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @kathrynw5 REAL men, you know,  toxic males, get REAL women as girlfriends. We aren't wussies, we know what men like, we know how to give it to them,  &amp; we don't mind making them sammiches. Because they darn sure take care of us.
1328170500929961985 2020-11-16 10:58:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Isn't that the truth. Or a hooked on a Sunday morning.

1328162078884913152 2020-11-16 10:24:50 +0800 <Kganley123> I got faith President Trump will asap fire Barr, Durham, Wray, Haspell, clean house in FBI, CIA, DOJ, all of it.
1328160896535838720 2020-11-16 10:20:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @peterdaou No. That's de- incentivises achievement.

1328158065351294976 2020-11-16 10:08:53 +0800 <Kganley123> @PeteButtigieg Thank you for appreciating President Trump! He's a great President and you're right, he'll soon be pronounced the winner!

1327391522795319296 2020-11-14 07:22:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Ya'll need to quit expecting Barr or anyone else to do anything. They've more than proven they aren't. So, we can continue to wait upon false hope OR take back this country OURSELVES our way.

Hoped, prayed, tweeted, memed, passed along info to whoever we could,  kept informed,  followed "the drops &amp; dates" held onto promises &amp; dates that never panned out. I think we're just done. Hanging by our fingernails.

1326881246123708417 2020-11-12 21:35:15 +0800 <Kganley123> It's December 12, and Joe Biden is still never going to be president.

1326871388842418176 2020-11-12 20:56:05 +0800 <Kganley123> I haven't seen chemtrails in Wyoming all summer. They started up again last week. Weather went from gloriously warm &amp; sunny to cloudy, mid-teen temps, and snow. 🥶🤬

1326181375746080769 2020-11-10 23:14:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Get those votes recounted, Maryland is a huge corruption state.
1326180655701528576 2020-11-10 23:11:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Except for trees are now farmed like corn etc. so virgin forests aren't as threatened as before.

1325963044258607104 2020-11-10 08:46:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Yes it is!

1325657715599765505 2020-11-09 12:33:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin Peaceful &amp; good.

1325568872787832832 2020-11-09 06:40:21 +0800 <Kganley123> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump "Suck it up" like you all did? I don't think so basement dweller.
1325567796625854464 2020-11-09 06:36:05 +0800 <Kganley123> God would not have given us the grace of 4 years of Donald Trump only to rip the rug out now. That is not the character of God. We are more prayerful now, more repentant now, more aware now, more grateful now, more motivated now. God will honor that. Trust Him, pray &amp; thank Him.
1325509657436188672 2020-11-09 02:45:03 +0800 <Kganley123> Do you think President Trump would be out golfing if there is anything to worry about?
1325508879824814080 2020-11-09 02:41:58 +0800 <Kganley123> Oh this hurts my heart, may he pray for us in heaven. RIP, Eternal Rest Grant Unto Him Oh Lord, Let Perpetual Light Shine Upon Him, May He Rest In Peace. Amen.
1325508483035275269 2020-11-09 02:40:23 +0800 <Kganley123> Says the man who oversaw the destruction of the twin towers on 9/11 that his father orchestrated. Need I mention JFK assassination?
1325507778903859200 2020-11-09 02:37:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Wow, now we know why your own elections have been so contentious &amp; full of protests. Your people knew things we just found out about you.  Deep State satanic cabal much? Judas &amp; your 30 pieces of silver.
1325305489626820609 2020-11-08 13:13:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Deep state are psychopaths.

1325294609769979906 2020-11-08 12:30:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Sweetie, how in the world did you even rate being a bartender? Someone sold their T &amp; A didn't you?
1325293246369599488 2020-11-08 12:25:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheRealistNow @FLPea5 Here!
1325289606481240064 2020-11-08 12:10:39 +0800 <Kganley123> The relationship w/ the deep state cabal is like a psychopathic abusive husband/boyfriend ( or gal). Don't fall for the false promises, apologies, "it'll be better this time". Don't be a co-dependent. Divorce the deep state &amp; have zero further contact.
1325288596434137088 2020-11-08 12:06:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @realTrumpForce @dave_dav05 Yes we do!
1325287994912251906 2020-11-08 12:04:15 +0800 <Kganley123> People remember, just because Joe Biden proclaims himself president it doesn't make it true. They proclaimed a false impeachment that also wasn't true. Joe Biden can proclaim himself Jesus Christ with the backing of all the world's media but it STILL doesn't make it true.
1324793434595491841 2020-11-07 03:19:02 +0800 <Kganley123> Republicans in Senate are now gong to come out in support of Trump right now. They're CYA-ing big time in case of a Biden presidency. They're in self protection mode. Because if Biden steals this they don't want to be on record as being on the wrong side.
1324522324645748739 2020-11-06 09:21:45 +0800 <Kganley123> Can we do this people?
1324522038283792384 2020-11-06 09:20:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @ArtOfWarNews @lanaurey This is not proven to be factually accurate.  Check your sources.

1324518410173079552 2020-11-06 09:06:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @KamVTV Ummmm... you do realize Barr does not act in our best interests.

1324512089185005568 2020-11-06 08:41:04 +0800 <Kganley123> Funny how all Twitter mentions from/about JFK Jr, Vincent Fusca, Schiff, Comey, Hollywood, Barr, Durham &amp; more have just ceased. Twitter censorship?
1324510358246092800 2020-11-06 08:34:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Could sure use some "The best is yet to come" right now.
1324510183159050240 2020-11-06 08:33:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin Very distraught &amp; tired.

1324477950612271105 2020-11-06 06:25:25 +0800 <Kganley123> Me either.

1324476808012558336 2020-11-06 06:20:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Agreed. It's discrimination.
1324475437469241344 2020-11-06 06:15:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Go get 'em!
1324448507139297281 2020-11-06 04:28:25 +0800 <Kganley123> The venue I chose for fasting &amp; prayer today. A high place. Windy as heck though. So I'm hunkered in my car.  https://t.co/boWQEAaXU4
1324446844433309696 2020-11-06 04:21:49 +0800 <Kganley123> They've blanked out. Maybe CIA Barr is in GITMO?
1324443125478117376 2020-11-06 04:07:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @GreyGhost_Biker @daverich503 @realDonaldTrump Voice &amp; maybe something else if it comes to that.
1324442220456370177 2020-11-06 04:03:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @tracybeanz No they do not. They sold their souls to satan long ago.
1324441849520553984 2020-11-06 04:01:58 +0800 <Kganley123> How about just arresting them?

1324216085047054337 2020-11-05 13:04:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealBrysonGray @roadcrew16 How about, "can we get some arrests now" chant. That's what should have been done.
1324215720163581954 2020-11-05 13:03:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @GenFlynn Sorry General. I gave all my trust &amp; belief at the office. It's over for me,  I trust not in this President or anyone in this hot sh*t hole mess any longer.
1324211558386343936 2020-11-05 12:46:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Exactly. Spot on!

1324208883129184256 2020-11-05 12:36:15 +0800 <Kganley123> Ooohhhh... he's going to "expose" the fraud. I'll bet they're shaking in their boots. It's already exposed. They aren't held accountable so who cares?
1324206800678236160 2020-11-05 12:27:58 +0800 <Kganley123> Yea, I'm thinking this is a rumor.
1324206420301000705 2020-11-05 12:26:27 +0800 <Kganley123> Well gee Don Jr. you're father hired him &amp; Barr. Why don't YOU enlighten us. Because your dad owns this sh*t show for not arresting &amp; prosecuting these demoniacs long ago when there's a preponderance of evidence to do so.
1324205251214233600 2020-11-05 12:21:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @VFuska We're frickin' well over the show.
1324156500110045186 2020-11-05 09:08:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @Army8589 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I needed this!
1324155555603099649 2020-11-05 09:04:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealJamesWoods Yep.
1324155084658286593 2020-11-05 09:02:28 +0800 <Kganley123> these millions of prayers being offered. We want to do and be better, we want the evil removed. I have to believe somehow God will honor that. It's all we've got. It's all I've got.
1324155082926034944 2020-11-05 09:02:28 +0800 <Kganley123> evaporating. And then came Sunday. God told Lot He world save Sodom &amp; Gomorrah for the sake of 1 righteous man. I know there are many righteous in this country &amp; world that have been praying, hoping, repenting, fasting for us. I can't believe God would cast us to Satan with all
1324155080552058881 2020-11-05 09:02:27 +0800 <Kganley123> the followers of Jesus felt at His crucifixion.They didn't understand the plan &amp; talk about suffering a mind f**k. Your friend &amp; all your hope was hanging mutilated &amp; dying on a cross. When you were believing in something greater, more positive. All your hope &amp; trust was
1324155078555525120 2020-11-05 09:02:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, so I've spent all day trying to figure out this entire sh*t show we're experiencing. I've vented, given up, driven into the Wyoming mountains.  These are my thoughts for what they're worth. We're all being horribly mind f**cked right now. It's cruel. But I think about how
1324151952373022721 2020-11-05 08:50:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @QohnG And what job would that be? Because I'm not seeing it.
1324150500187500547 2020-11-05 08:44:15 +0800 <Kganley123> You do get that with a Biden win Israel is toast.
1324148936370651136 2020-11-05 08:38:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @MrCryptoAddict @cjtruth Agreed. Should have been handled long ago. We're all being mind f**ked .
1324147746052296705 2020-11-05 08:33:18 +0800 <Kganley123> So when do we get to the "the best is yet to come" part?
1324134000005324800 2020-11-05 07:38:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheRealFKQ @BadBoyIII4 Love you!
1324133741304799232 2020-11-05 07:37:39 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm with you. Do NOT underestimate the righteous anger of Patriots. Do not. We've been more than tolerant &amp; patient. It's over. Where do we meet up?
1324131775610679296 2020-11-05 07:29:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @BenJackd1 @EricMMatheny -100
1324131221325033472 2020-11-05 07:27:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @SchmittNYC @Luce_52 If Biden takes this,  you can be sure Trump &amp; family will be Clintonized along with allot of us. GITMO will be our home, not theirs.
1324130856152170496 2020-11-05 07:26:11 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. Pretty much. While all their heinous crimes were revealed &amp; NOTHING done about any of it!
1324130630133719040 2020-11-05 07:25:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @patton6966 @MikkiSm56095348 We're PISSED. Not fearful. Trump could have nipped all this with timely arrests &amp; justice. But nooo..decided to play with our emotions &amp; minds like a cat w/a mouse. I'll go put in a blaze of glory before I'll submit to satanic communism in this country any further! Hear that God?
1324129793378451458 2020-11-05 07:21:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @PaddyMrs @doqholliday I think it's the WH. USSS refers to US Secret Service.. Maybe it means WH secured.  Not sure,  just guessing. Anyone else w/ thoughts?
1324127889655123968 2020-11-05 07:14:24 +0800 <Kganley123> @martingeddes @Inthenameoflo19 Yep.
1324127709807570944 2020-11-05 07:13:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @hodgetwins @realDonaldTrump Wyoming. We're uber safe.
1324127629335797764 2020-11-05 07:13:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @PaddyMrs Yep.
1324127353946042368 2020-11-05 07:12:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @BlackFlagArmy10 Yea, I don't think it will matter what you say at that point. Because we'll all be gulag candidates. GITMO will be used for us.
1324095914533740544 2020-11-05 05:07:21 +0800 <Kganley123> @CaptianAdhd @Shiftworker1976 Yep.
1324095771847716864 2020-11-05 05:06:47 +0800 <Kganley123> I'll bet ammo is flying off the shelves right now by folks not already stocked up.
1324093869449859073 2020-11-05 04:59:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Correct. But hindsight is 20/20
1324090907474366465 2020-11-05 04:47:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @Shiftworker1976 @CaptianAdhd After 59 years &amp; living through all kinds of crap in DC, I've earned my cynicism. I trust no one. No plan. I've studied history, I've studied Chinese communism. I've conducted business in China. Trump is not Jesus Christ. This is a very dark, sinister, well funded, organized evil
1324089277978796032 2020-11-05 04:40:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @Shiftworker1976 @CaptianAdhd Yea, I'm not a normie. I've been following this crap all my life since my teens in the 70's. Every single part of their agenda has worked out to a "T". I grew up surrounded by CIA &amp; FBI operatives, you learn stuff. My uncle was high level CIA. Pardon me if I'm cynical.
1324085982526754816 2020-11-05 04:27:53 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeyondContesta1 @LikeFineWine63 And we can get it from Oregon.
1324085920035860480 2020-11-05 04:27:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeyondContesta1 @LikeFineWine63 Me too, if I'm still around.
1324083776108986369 2020-11-05 04:19:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @ari_russian @BadBoyIII4 me!
1324083297509548033 2020-11-05 04:17:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @CaptianAdhd The whole NESARA thing or whatever it's being called now, rainbow currency, everybody gets a house, debts removed, everyone on the same level, no more being able to have housing loans, car loans, paying with soul work or whatever. Sounds like world-wide communism to me.
1324081692085084160 2020-11-05 04:10:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @KratosLiving @PositiveAbraham Exactly.
1324081507711897601 2020-11-05 04:10:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @TimDorsey12 Are we? The R's have proven themselves inactive RINOS whose pockets are also lined with laundered Chinese &amp;  Middle Eastern money. Do you really think Camel Toe will abide by the Constitution? They've done well away with it and will crush it completely.
1324078167766659072 2020-11-05 03:56:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @TimDorsey12 Guess you'd better read up on your China history. It's what they do. Remember Pol Pot? Mao? Yes, they want to reduce the world's population anyway. Camel toe Harris spoke this truth "we're coming for you". I don't care, I'd rather be dead than communist. But I'll go fighting.
1324076942451200000 2020-11-05 03:51:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel He doesn't give up, but He does bring correction &amp; judgement.
1324076705615552512 2020-11-05 03:51:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @TimDorsey12 No, I'm not, we look like a Banana Republic to the world now. We can't even conduct a decent peaceful election. Do you think they will EVER trust ANYTHING Trump tries to do moving forward?
1324075993653411840 2020-11-05 03:48:11 +0800 <Kganley123> Whatever happened to, "My fellow Americans, the storm is upon us" ? What a farce this has been.
1324075159611830272 2020-11-05 03:44:52 +0800 <Kganley123> President Trump, his family, followers, all of us are going to wearing orange in front of firing squads if this isn't fixed. And FAST!
1324074712675201024 2020-11-05 03:43:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @patton6966 @HellsBellShel B.S. We aren't fearful, we're effin' MAD. We played this game Trump's way for his entire administration. We trusted "the plan", we fasted, prayed, repented. ALL of it. Now, it's time to play the game OUR WAY &amp; show no mercy. This is what the 2nd amendment is for.
1324074236806270976 2020-11-05 03:41:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel While I agree in one part, we've played the game Trump's way throughout this entire administration. Now it's time to play the game OUR way. And show ZERO MERCY!
1324070868545232897 2020-11-05 03:27:49 +0800 <Kganley123> All this is squarely Trump's fault &amp; is laid squarely at his feet. Should have been thwarted this summer with arrests &amp; convictions. But he trusted those he should not have. Because "there was a plan". Riiiiiiiightttt.
1324070040501538816 2020-11-05 03:24:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Yes, I was a Ancient Aliens show addict until I moved to Wyoming &amp; now do not have TV. Never read any of their books though. I can start YouTubing though now that the election is over. The election &amp; work has had my full attention. I think I can get many answers from meditation.
1324063397021806592 2020-11-05 02:58:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Because we're all being played. "It's all a movie" remember?
1324062782204088323 2020-11-05 02:55:41 +0800 <Kganley123> How's it feel being played for the fools America?
1324062301473796096 2020-11-05 02:53:47 +0800 <Kganley123> And Durham. Durham &amp; Barr. Crickets from both. As well as 16+1.
1324061910942191617 2020-11-05 02:52:14 +0800 <Kganley123> "Trust the plan" they said. "White hats in control" they said. "Hold the line" they said. 😂😂😂 How's that working out for us America?
1324060764462702592 2020-11-05 02:47:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Mars is home isn't it? Something deep inside keeps gnawing at me over my life saying this, otherwise why all the efforts to get there &amp; live? Also, what's up with the space station we NEVER hear anything about, what is REALLY going on up there? I've never felt "home" here.
1324059506083418116 2020-11-05 02:42:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Truth here. Except we're fed up now and we abide by the 2nd. We were willing to trust the plan through the election. It's now over &amp; time for us to take back control.
1324059065819955203 2020-11-05 02:40:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Honey, we're done. Over it. Something should have been done about the ds way before now. We look like fools to the world, to the minority voters who trusted the plan &amp; Trump. How do you think they're feeling today?
1324058269078364160 2020-11-05 02:37:45 +0800 <Kganley123> @DGPurser Don't hold your breath, you'll expire.
1324057940848865280 2020-11-05 02:36:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel The library at Alexandria was burned for a reason. All of earth's, human, and technological history was in that library and we were immediately thrust into the Dark Ages to essentially start over &amp; we're still trying to catch up.
1324057368871620608 2020-11-05 02:34:11 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel I believe our planet to be much older than we're told, giant humans did exist as well as other beings, climate change DOES occur over cyclical periods because it's supposed to based upon planetary &amp; earthly alignments plus revolution path in universe.
1324056917983993856 2020-11-05 02:32:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel And why do we only see 1 side (face) of the moon while others rotate &amp; spin?
1324056697934000129 2020-11-05 02:31:31 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel And why do we only ever see 1 side (face) of the moon while others rotate or spin?
1324056474318876672 2020-11-05 02:30:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Keeping with the Mars theme, we have this huge push, &amp; have for years, to put humans on Mars, not just visit but to live. So my mind asks, "are we actually trying to return 'home' "? Is that why we're so obsessed with Mars? Why not so much with other planets?
1324054801089351681 2020-11-05 02:23:58 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. Keep your powder dry.
1324052908573220864 2020-11-05 02:16:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel Yea, okay. Pfffftttt....
1324052746606051329 2020-11-05 02:15:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @StarSoul777 @HellsBellShel I have a question. When we look at photos of Mars there is a huge scar across it's face. This has never looked natural to me but like it occurred from some supernatural weapon. I believe Mars was at one time a living planet, but whatever happened to cause this scar, killed it?
1324047802406596610 2020-11-05 01:56:10 +0800 <Kganley123> Look, obviously nothing is going to be done for us. Trump is still trusting the courts and those he erroneously trusted for "some plan", none of which was revealed to us. It's up to US, the PEOPLE, to take back our country by any &amp; all means possible.
1324046353446531072 2020-11-05 01:50:24 +0800 <Kganley123> You know, my IRISH is up this morning. I really want to go all Braveheart on this situation. (Yes, I know he was Scottish).
1324046018678198272 2020-11-05 01:49:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @Phaethon314 Oh we're angry all right. I've got my Irish SERIOUSLY up this morning.
1324044547895095297 2020-11-05 01:43:14 +0800 <Kganley123> Do you think all those minority voters who trusted in our system, our President, their hopes &amp; dreams, will EVER trust the Republican side again? They crossed over because they BELIEVED. That belief has now be shattered. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump
1324043889125195776 2020-11-05 01:40:37 +0800 <Kganley123> won't ever do that again. Any hope of keeping their trust &amp; faith just went down the toilet in a big "FLUSH".
1324043888147918849 2020-11-05 01:40:37 +0800 <Kganley123> f-get-aboud-it. Ain't nothing truthful or real gonna come out for a long while if ever. This country has now entered the realm of being a Venezuelan sh*t show. Think about how all those Latino, Black, &amp; other minority voters trusted our system &amp; Patriots &amp; were let down. Bet they
1324039288825106432 2020-11-05 01:22:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @BadBoyIII4 @realDonaldTrump I'm in, time for mobilization of troops. Tired of the b.s.
1324038780672643075 2020-11-05 01:20:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin They're saddle stirrups, quit trying to read "messages" that aren't there. It's like you have your PF Flyer magic decoder ring on. We're done with it.
1324038365751046144 2020-11-05 01:18:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth Whatever. We no longer trust the "behind the scenes" rhetoric that has caused the loss of this country.
1324038113472122880 2020-11-05 01:17:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Not sure if you're aware @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn etc. but a bunch of tweets are not going to save this country. But WE THE PEOPLE will. If you won't, we can and will.
1324037397642797056 2020-11-05 01:14:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @patton6966 Whatever. It's past time for prayers, it's time for real armoring up. We've sat on our hands far too long and it's now time to take matters into our own hands. 2nd amendment is still alive and we'll use it while we can and as we should have long ago this past summer.
1324035556410421248 2020-11-05 01:07:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheTRUMPTRESS @BadBoyIII4 I agree, it's time WE THE PEOPLE take back our country. Their "plan" has gotten us nowhere but closer to communism and satanism. I'm in Cody, Wyoming if anyone wants to reach out. I'm all in!
1324033625990463488 2020-11-05 00:59:50 +0800 <Kganley123> Deafening silence from 16+1, all those prophets &amp; pastors who predicted 2 terms for Trump. 5-D chess just went to Chinese checkers real quick.
1324033089379524610 2020-11-05 00:57:42 +0800 <Kganley123> I can tell you one thing, as long as this election remains a sh*t show w/o a determined winner, Pres. Trump will not be able to accomplish anything internationally or nationally policy-wise. Iran &amp; other countries are now emboldened to rattle their sabers, threaten Israel, etc.
1324018087390191616 2020-11-04 23:58:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @ThursdayGem Yes. The devil won.
1324017998819061760 2020-11-04 23:57:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Look dude, we've HAD FAITH! We're frickin' burned out on it already &amp; so is the rest of the world. We look like clowns &amp; are.
1324017524934025218 2020-11-04 23:55:51 +0800 <Kganley123> Except each state has laws, or not, regarding how long they can count mail or absentee ballots.
1324016969473908738 2020-11-04 23:53:39 +0800 <Kganley123> What an absolute sh*t show. And it's OUR FAULT! We sat back &amp; did nothing trusting in some "secret plan" while Satanic communists literally stole our country from us. I just want to know from God how many prayers, repentances, fastings etc. did He need from us to save us?
1324008054606585856 2020-11-04 23:18:13 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm sorry, tell me again about "the best is yet to come"?
1324005117943664641 2020-11-04 23:06:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @DevilsNightBaby We lost, it goes to the Supreme Court now.
1324004970656538632 2020-11-04 23:05:58 +0800 <Kganley123> Hey America, how's that "trust the plan" worked out for us? We look like absolute fools on the world stage because we sat back and literally gave our country &amp; the world away to satanists. Should have taken matters into our own hands this past Spring &amp; Summer.
1323982942327066625 2020-11-04 21:38:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio Yes, and "found" thousands more in the early morning hours while we slept.
1323864169309827072 2020-11-04 13:46:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @DonnaWR8 I agree.
1323863861317890048 2020-11-04 13:45:15 +0800 <Kganley123> And the stealing/fraud commences.
1323862200331595778 2020-11-04 13:38:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @SamsonStrong11 Need to send some to DC. Rioting underway.
1323861590416871429 2020-11-04 13:36:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Hysterical, Joe Biden said he is going to speak. He can't even string a coherent (or so he acts) sentence together.
1323849545785094144 2020-11-04 12:48:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Kinda wondering where all those white hats are right now that kept telling us "they're in control". Really,  because the fraud structure is working really well &amp; we're exhausted from constantly getting beat up by them. And yet we STILL have to have more riots too.
1323848708811730944 2020-11-04 12:45:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @kimKBaltimore @Mfume4Congress So sorry Kimberly, I really am.  I'm from Maryland &amp; left this past Spring for "fresher air" out west.  Maybe with your talents you may want to consider other horizons. Let the pigs have their pig pens, they love them.
1323847886015098880 2020-11-04 12:41:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @BlackFlagArmy10 @catturd2 It's not the percentage reporting, it's how that percentage is weighted by county.  Pima County was the deciding factor.
1323847614245163008 2020-11-04 12:40:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheRealistNow Yes it is
1323847572386017282 2020-11-04 12:40:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Philadelphia announced they aren't counting anymore votes tonight because Trump has pretty much won PA. The Arizona loss caused them to decide to drag things out.
1323842144235184128 2020-11-04 12:18:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @BlackFlagArmy10 I think he just won his race.
1323841368611934208 2020-11-04 12:15:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @SamsonStrong11 Yes it does.
1323826124615348225 2020-11-04 11:15:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @heather_giron It's fraud, she's cheating.

1323818808411254784 2020-11-04 10:46:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScottBaio @FoxNews Don't watch MSM returns,  they're all fake. Watch metrics oriented channels.  Try Dlive on Clouthub
1323818434942038017 2020-11-04 10:44:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @_SCA3_ They're not the one for you or shouldn't be in your sphere of influence. Anyone you accept into your life should "click"  with you, no trying about it. That goes for siblings etc.

1323778277824098304 2020-11-04 08:05:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @SugarMAGA What is RSB?
1323777931156484096 2020-11-04 08:03:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  I thought White Hats were in control? If so, why is big tech allowed to control the election news streams? Wtf, where can i get accurate updates?
1323775159015100418 2020-11-04 07:52:47 +0800 <Kganley123> Big tech is at it, deleting sites like crazy. I hate what they're doing,  (Hi Jack) but my biggest revenge is to pray for their salvation. Because MY God beat their god back to hell on the cross &amp; via His resurrection. My GOD HATES their loser god. And so do I.
1323747838556139521 2020-11-04 06:04:13 +0800 <Kganley123> Wow. Bitchute is offline. What creepazoid did that?
1323740083518779392 2020-11-04 05:33:24 +0800 <Kganley123> Why do women do this thinking it will make some sort of shock impact? Because seeing tits, cleavage, ass in public is so common nowadays no one cares.  It's slutty. Stop it, respect yourself.
1323738464194473984 2020-11-04 05:26:58 +0800 <Kganley123> Someone get to this precinct and open it up NOW!!!
1323735923511603201 2020-11-04 05:16:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley @IoDrew It's fantastic!

1323690911411314689 2020-11-04 02:18:00 +0800 <Kganley123> I voted early 2 weeks ago. Kind of feel like I'm missing out on all the fun. But I'm praying hard today, pulling in Saints from heaven, archangels, Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Joan D'Arcy ( my Patron, she's a warrior!).
1323669364147511296 2020-11-04 00:52:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @Qtah17 Where can I get updates?
1323669035750338560 2020-11-04 00:51:05 +0800 <Kganley123> Inside source of telling me it's showing the House remaining Dem, Senate in trouble. Biden is taking WI, NV, AZ. NC, IA, MI a toss. Get out and call people to vote red!!!!
1323663389839687681 2020-11-04 00:28:39 +0800 <Kganley123> Who is reporting legit election return results throughout the day. I'd like to follow from Wyoming.
1323662973622128640 2020-11-04 00:27:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealJamesWoods Yes I did, a couple weeks ago!

1323618907706466304 2020-11-03 21:31:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Amen!
1323618791876489219 2020-11-03 21:31:26 +0800 <Kganley123> Been here in Wyoming for months from Maryland waiting out all the craziness. It's surreal. I've been very cocooned &amp; detached from everything. Wyoming is what the US used to be in the 50-60's. We're fired up about this election, but no fear or anxiety. Law &amp; order still the rule.
1323605097260019712 2020-11-03 20:37:01 +0800 <Kganley123> It's beautiful!

1323443031417081856 2020-11-03 09:53:01 +0800 <Kganley123> You're brain dead Keaton, have you not seen the Hunter Biden material? And it's the DEMS who caused the chaos! But you're just a Hollywood actor, you're devoid of intellect. All you can do is memorize words.
1323442171467329536 2020-11-03 09:49:36 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok everyone, let's push President Trump to not only a win but a 50 STATE SWEEP!
1323402875167404032 2020-11-03 07:13:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sir, This "Chumpster" would like to request you perform your signature "rally dance" at your re-election victory party please. It would really put the icing on the campaign cake of 2020. Thank you!
1323400413761085440 2020-11-03 07:03:40 +0800 <Kganley123> Right on!!!

1323362616731820032 2020-11-03 04:33:29 +0800 <Kganley123> To all Dems: while you STILL cling to old news about our President like taxes, normal people like us have long ago moved past to embrace an incredible future. You cling to the decrepit past, even wanting more destruction &amp; poverty, while we invite and LIVE in the future of good

1323357490436739072 2020-11-03 04:13:07 +0800 <Kganley123> Our great&amp; beloved President Donald J. Trump &amp; his beautiful, classy wife Melania, have traversed this country on an exhaustive schedule to meet/greet us, speak to &amp; with us, rally his troops, communicate what the media won't. The LEAST we can do is get out &amp; vote for him! Whoot!
1323354891822137344 2020-11-03 04:02:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @PISDI94_96 No, I'm very excited! Can't wait!

1323114017662009345 2020-11-02 12:05:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Why is NG reporting to metro police officials who've been told to stand down in the past?

1323086979739774976 2020-11-02 10:18:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @tyler_casper I do. I'm a single. I'm a "tranny", I wear both dresses and pants.  🤣🤣🤣🤣

1323045490238185472 2020-11-02 07:33:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @ACTBrigitte @jackbill2 Bill Barr &amp; John Durham's investigations lead to nothing,  they're useless. Any investigations at this point are worthless because they're devoid of justice. Any revelations end up as nothing more than dirty gossip.
1323044655487856641 2020-11-02 07:30:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley @weston4P Just because it's a perfect in-your-face truthful ad. Demoniacs don't need reasons, they lack all use of logical faculties.
1323042216198090752 2020-11-02 07:20:19 +0800 <Kganley123> While I commend their enthusiasm, I'm a tad concerned about whether emergency vehicles can get through.

1322933639718465536 2020-11-02 00:08:53 +0800 <Kganley123> Father God &amp; Holy Spirit, in Mighty Holy Name of Christ Jesus Our Lord, thank you for the gracious &amp; merciful gift of appointing our President, Donald J Trump, to a second 4-year term as the leader of our country. Your Love, patience, &amp; long-suffering with us is infinite. Amen!
1322913071803768832 2020-11-01 22:47:09 +0800 <Kganley123> Happy November 1! Out here in Wyoming the clock adjustment allows for better morning hunting,  the rut is on! Wishing our President, VP, their families, loyal staff, White Hats, Patriots, 16+1, a very happy start to 4 MORE YEARS!!!!
1322723281296764928 2020-11-01 10:12:59 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth Agreed.
1322721304257048576 2020-11-01 10:05:08 +0800 <Kganley123> Prove you made over 90,000 calls in 1 night. I've done allot of phone banking &amp; even with robocalls those numbers are WAY skewed.

1322695766519934976 2020-11-01 08:23:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @EricTrump you are correct! It all begins with the children.  How do you think the demoniacs became so successful over the decades. Mind shaping. Get rid of "social studies" it's divisive &amp; from the pit of hell. Math, hard sciences, ancient history leading up to American History,

They were probably cheering much the same way one does following a football game victory. But you're still wearing a mask so your intelligence is in question anyway.

1321532863246782464 2020-10-29 03:22:42 +0800 <Kganley123> If you're a Christian Pastor &amp; you're advising your flock to not vote for President Trump, you are bought &amp; owned by Mammon, Baal &amp; are no Christian.

Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Maybe you'd do well to read about  David committing adultery with Bathsheba &amp; yet God still upheld him as King &amp; prospered him.  Because David repented as did President Trump.

1320526945491185664 2020-10-26 08:45:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Sounds demonically gruesome.
1320525781856972801 2020-10-26 08:40:55 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin I don't think the truth will be released or any perps held to account. The evil is very high level and goes back to the age of Solomon. Unless President Trump is Jesus Christ, even he may be controlled. Because the controllers &amp; bankers control Langley which is the seat of "_".

1320410791531589634 2020-10-26 01:03:59 +0800 <Kganley123> @brhodes Which means NY, California, &amp; other high population areas would always control the outcome. Electoral College protects against this.  Genius of checks &amp; balances by our founders.

Shouldn't she have come to the defense of her kids, reported it, removed them from the situation? &amp; now she's out enabling &amp; stumping for the wicked perv

1319803426327257089 2020-10-24 08:50:32 +0800 <Kganley123> You're joking right? You've asked the very guy who has failed to bring any indictments or arrests on anything.  Your smoking meth with Hunter dude.
1319800919731572736 2020-10-24 08:40:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Heck no!

1319798203558969344 2020-10-24 08:29:47 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, let's play a game &amp; see if @POTUS @realDonaldTrump answers.  "Where's Hunter?" Tweet your answers. I'll start.   GITMO being  interrogated via the Bush method.
1319797014901583872 2020-10-24 08:25:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @patton6966 But I've been seeking the "why" from heaven and *crickets*. What is my role? Because I've gone through some gnarly life crap to get here &amp; in still in a muddle.
1319795991491399680 2020-10-24 08:20:59 +0800 <Kganley123> Is this what is meant in the Book of Revelations when it says,  "the dead shall rise first"? 🤪

1319757651610423305 2020-10-24 05:48:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @KamVTV Welcome to the family!
1319755518588514304 2020-10-24 05:40:10 +0800 <Kganley123> FBI, DOJ, CIA, IRS = one big circle jerk club. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has the responsibility for oversight of these agencies. They are all rogue and need reigning in, flushed out, brought to heel. DC rule of thumb is NEVER EVER trust ANYONE left over from prior administrations.
1319728702545039360 2020-10-24 03:53:36 +0800 <Kganley123> I give up on Barr, Durham, @potus etc. Justice will never be served on any perps of value, they're winning,  we're losing. All this "exposure" has served zero purpose other than as dirty gossip. Prove me wrong.
1319727569374113792 2020-10-24 03:49:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @eschmannjoe @JohnWHuber Because he knows where ALL the bodies are buried.
1319658162891280387 2020-10-23 23:13:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @anonpatriotq Everyone is missing the mark. What the heck is the point in releasing all this info when it's devoid of justice?! Who cares? It's nothing more than dirty gossip if they aren't arrests. End of story. Barr is a CIA mole Durham, who knows.
1319656962611556353 2020-10-23 23:08:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin We'll see.
1319472572644298752 2020-10-23 10:55:50 +0800 <Kganley123> I suspect our President will be letting the tweets fly tonight and come out swinging hard tomorrow.  He pulled the wings off his fly tonight. Legs next tomorrow then begins the squishing.
1319465194167283713 2020-10-23 10:26:31 +0800 <Kganley123> @PeteButtigieg No he's focused on his teleprompter contact lenses and cheat apparatus in his hand.
1319464117728464897 2020-10-23 10:22:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @JeffOnTheRight No he isn't. Proof is in the pudding. Listen to Joe's statements over the course of his career, was mentored by kkk clan leader. President Trump actually hires and empowers minorities minorities as he has his entire career.
1319463122139189248 2020-10-23 10:18:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @LeahR77 He's wearing teleprompter contact lenses.
1319461597442502661 2020-10-23 10:12:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @PatrickGunnels Just understand President Trump is gathering ALL of this as fodder to hold against Joe in the remainder of the election and criminal trials.
1319461207321890816 2020-10-23 10:10:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @KamalaHarris Oh butter legs, I wouldn't be so arrogant. There's dirt on you too honey poo. Lots and lots of dirt. Didn't your family own slaves? Oh, &amp; you ain't black.
1319457736011051008 2020-10-23 09:56:53 +0800 <Kganley123> "He's running against Joe Biden, Joe Biden." Joe is suffering delusions of grandeur thinking he's Jesus Christ. C'mon man.

1319455255956877314 2020-10-23 09:47:01 +0800 <Kganley123> How many C'mons is Joe going to say?
1319454164619988995 2020-10-23 09:42:41 +0800 <Kganley123> They aren't allowing Trump to answer.
1319454068595519489 2020-10-23 09:42:18 +0800 <Kganley123> Joe is setting himself up for a grand fall. Trump will use all of Joe's responses against him in coming weeks.
1319452574412533760 2020-10-23 09:36:22 +0800 <Kganley123> He does know how to game the system idiot. He's smart, he's supposed to outwit the government using their rules to do it!
1319452031493443586 2020-10-23 09:34:13 +0800 <Kganley123> "You're the big man"
1319451960815144961 2020-10-23 09:33:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Joe you idiot, Trump is a business man, he's ALLOWED to make money legally in other countries.  Unlike you who mafia strong arms.

1319445906484150272 2020-10-23 09:09:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @kenningtonsays Right??! I thought so too.

1319436091452133377 2020-10-23 08:30:52 +0800 <Kganley123> President Trump and his family have endured daily character colonoscopies with a brillo brush.

1319363233128587265 2020-10-23 03:41:22 +0800 <Kganley123> All of the revelations re: the deep state satanic cabal while good,  without convictions they are nothing more than juicy gossip between old ladies across a pocket fence.

Because we can spot a lie 10 miles away and we bring immediate justice/consequences to bear.
1318684755047583744 2020-10-21 06:45:20 +0800 <Kganley123> Scenario1: Hunter is fed up w/abuse from his dad &amp; family which goes back to his childhood. Decides its payback time &amp; to get monkey off his back dumps laptops for "repair". Scenario2: Trump admin has Hunter &amp; he's agreed to turn over evidence via a scheme to dump the laptops.
1318684022269038593 2020-10-21 06:42:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @tracybeanz Oh yes he did.

As a lone female be very careful re: your route choices. Join a running or cycling club, this time of year is fantastic to volunteer for campaigns or the polls. Walk dogs for spare $, volunteer for veterans.
1317973341337047042 2020-10-19 07:38:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @carrieksada I totally do. It's just way too obvious, kind of like the kidnapping of the Michigan Governor. Trump keeps asking, " Where's Hunter?" so somethings up.  Maybe Hunter was tired of being bullied by his dad, I suspect he may have been abused as a child, and decided to give it up.

1317281411317968896 2020-10-17 09:48:57 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, but my connection says internal WH polling shows the President behind and they're worried. I can't seem to get any straight answers.  Anyone out there have internal numbers?
1317280594691203073 2020-10-17 09:45:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @_SCA3_ I feel you, I'm in the same boat. However, I may be a failure in human  estimation but I know God kept me on this planet for this long enduring all kinds of shit so there must be a reason. I must be something in His estimation &amp; that's all that matters.  And so are you.

Until black youths BELIEVE  in themselves enough to stop killing each other, get off drugs, become educated, fathers stay in the families they create, nothing will change. It's about self dignity.

1316558035913830400 2020-10-15 09:54:30 +0800 <Kganley123> Hi Twitter, FB, Jack! Just want you to know your tactics are lame.  Our God made your puny god, our God doesn't need you or your pathetic tech. Neither do we. It's a tool,  that's all. Our God made the earth, cosmos, everything that dwells within &amp; upon. He can EASILY bypass this
1316556545296011264 2020-10-15 09:48:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Social media censorship is trying the resolve of everyone. But let's look at the bigger picture. God is far bigger,  more infinite,  omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. Maybe He wants to be glorified by presenting us miraculous ways &amp; means outside these demonic methods. Be stil

1316389970655944709 2020-10-14 22:46:41 +0800 <Kganley123> Isn't that cute. Barr worked for the CIA in the 70's and Pappy Bush in early 90's. So how logical is it to believe the snake will do a fair investigation of itself with indictments? Definition of insanity? There's a pattern of Pres. Trump hiring these creeps just saying.
1316277219619033090 2020-10-14 15:18:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @HSRetoucher @izzyforAmerica Arrests of a low level staffers third cousin on his step mother's side 4 times removed.  IOW, no one of significance. Don't you get it people? They lead us on, no justice, we complain, they throw us tiny bones of appeasement. Wash, rinse, repeat.
1316271211509215232 2020-10-14 14:54:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @TheRISEofROD @mspdcali Well don't give this to Barr, there will never be justice. Probably won't anyway.  Lots &amp; lots has been revealed w/out any evidence of justice.
1316269142492635136 2020-10-14 14:46:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @ProudMaga12 What is the recipe?
1316268843426217984 2020-10-14 14:45:22 +0800 <Kganley123> Do you all know what the definition of insanity is? Doing the same thing over &amp; over expecting a different result. It is just sick, wrong, &amp; insane for us to continually sit back waiting for justice when time &amp; again that waiting produces NOTHING but disappointment.
1316244359822503937 2020-10-14 13:08:04 +0800 <Kganley123> @GeorgePapa19 @QArmyInfo So what? Implication is not prosecution. Oh, I know,  I have an idea, send it to Barr, he'll prosecute it. NOT!
1316243795957039105 2020-10-14 13:05:50 +0800 <Kganley123> So, @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @John_F_Kennnedy what now happens with Barr?
1316243568860700672 2020-10-14 13:04:56 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. He is.
1316243387444412417 2020-10-14 13:04:12 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep. And they know it. They are more empowered each day.

IF President DJT has the laptop, or knows what's on it, why isn't HE doing something about it? Besides leaving it up to more worthless ds rats like Barr to sit on and do nothing like he just did with unmasking? Something smells &amp; We The People are fed up!

Yes, your passion may motivate you to run, but reigning in the passions for reason &amp; logic is a hallmark of emotional maturity. What are your reasons for running, can you actually run this country

1316218975613673472 2020-10-14 11:27:12 +0800 <Kganley123> So AG Barr formerly worked for Pappy Bush and his father recruited Jeffrey Epstein? Anyone confirm this please?  That's what I'm hearing from Steve Motley, which explains why Barr = no prosections. He's a globalist cabal member too!
1316208698830643203 2020-10-14 10:46:22 +0800 <Kganley123> said nothing will be done until re: Hilliary etc. until AFTER  the election when we were told "hot summer", at end of summer for Durham report etc. We have been strung along all to win an election? "Trust the Plan"? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump your people are getting pissed up.
1316208697958264832 2020-10-14 10:46:22 +0800 <Kganley123> It is becoming VERY obvious to me we all may have been duped &amp; played hard. Barr concludes no wrongdoing in unmasking investigation, no Durham report, Trump wanting more $$ for airlines forcing people off planes for wearing political gear or no masks when they eat. Trump himself
1316205097240543232 2020-10-14 10:32:03 +0800 <Kganley123> I agree. I hope this isn't one huge troll.

1316125563774361600 2020-10-14 05:16:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @Lawakenings Aw heck, that has money laundering written all over it. We'll probably find out Hogan was getting $$$ from China too. He was running so many illegals through our state, had sanctuary counties, i saw unmarked white busses up &amp; down our hwys, all hours of morning &amp; evening.
1316100440539316224 2020-10-14 03:36:11 +0800 <Kganley123> Nope. I'll bet if someone walks up to him and begins questioning him about Hunter or Bo, he'll get lucid &amp; defensive real quick. It's an act.  He's trying to stay outta the noose. Benghazi anyone?

1316098913724583936 2020-10-14 03:30:07 +0800 <Kganley123> The CIA has run and controlled EVERYTHING in this country &amp; abroad since day 1. That is their function. They are an agency from the pit of hell, nothing good about it. A spiral of liars and lies.

1316092491502809088 2020-10-14 03:04:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @Lawakenings Exactly. Which begs the question, what was in it for them? Also, because they were from offshore, the risk of infection from the kits was higher, meaning, more true &amp; false positives, meaning longer shutdown &amp; control.
1316088102360817666 2020-10-14 02:47:09 +0800 <Kganley123> I LOVE her expression! 🤣 Utter contempt &amp; disdain for the fools she's suffering. She has full confidence in herself.

1316080542140383234 2020-10-14 02:17:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest So is your strategy to siphon votes from President Trump? Or from the demoncratic voters not likely to to vote for the President? There is obviously a deeper plan here since your campaign has been superficial at best. Like Biden's, but his is to avoid indictment.
1316078682205638656 2020-10-14 02:09:44 +0800 <Kganley123> Does anyone have any record on a tweet supposedly made by John F Kennedy Jr. re: an Oct 27 reveal as Pres. Trump's running mate?
1316078195154640901 2020-10-14 02:07:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @Lawakenings Nothing is ever hopeless because God. I believe the current ds cleansing will positively impact Maryland. But entire legislature needs purging with the Gov. Hogan's wife directly negotiated with S. Korea for face mask shipments etc. She is a private citizen, no auth to do this.

First thing I was instructed on was Chairman Miller's hold on the legislature. Nothing got past him, every Governor kissed his butt. It's still that way.  Ehrlich was the best though.

They've never seen daylight therefore eyes, facial features, ears, skin is underdeveloped. Roswell is a hub.
1315353916553351171 2020-10-12 02:09:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @_SCA3_ These are all normal feelings when you start breaking further out of the matrix. Your body &amp; mind are adjusting and want to climb higher.  Leave the old behind,  embrace the new.
1315308490059964416 2020-10-11 23:09:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @HellsBellShel @TrustThePlan_ So true.
1315306787680075777 2020-10-11 23:02:30 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm making a coffee table from a hollow cottonwood stump that has an old honey bee hive inside. Every time I sand it, honey bees come around to check it out, sometimes landing on the hive. I tell them I'm turning their former home into something beautiful. Gotta honor nature!
1315305684313927680 2020-10-11 22:58:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley I'm in Wyoming, drinking coffee,  just getting motivated to do more sanding on a coffee table I'm making from a hollow cottonwood tree stump.
1315303338032857088 2020-10-11 22:48:47 +0800 <Kganley123> @bktastic__ @VincentCrypt46 @Phaethon314 Congratulations! Blessings for a fruitful loving life!
1315302789443063812 2020-10-11 22:46:36 +0800 <Kganley123> So if we're "watching a movie" then logically the election has already occurred same as arrests. So why all the angst &amp; concerns?
1315301902158950401 2020-10-11 22:43:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrustThePlan_ @HellsBellShel We'll see. So far there's been nothing burgers because of " the election". Which is odd because we're also told we're watching a movie &amp; arrests have already been made. If we're watching a movie, then the election has also already occurred, so why all the rallies &amp; angst?

1315105685902770176 2020-10-11 09:43:23 +0800 <Kganley123> I liked Kirstie.
1315103378922303489 2020-10-11 09:34:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @Yolo304741 @realDonaldTrump Nothing burger. They're redacted.
1315073191715323904 2020-10-11 07:34:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @kirstiealley To be honest, it should Kirstie. The framers of our Constitution specified landed MEN to be the voting block. Only those with businesses could vote because they wanted to prevent low ambition, or emotionally driven votes. They figured if a man had a business he had the intellect.
1315071831745855488 2020-10-11 07:28:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumperWavin The point being as well, is that if there isn't a visual justice, then there's no deterrent for future perps and we'll be right back at square 1 as soon as President Trump leaves office.
1314747191504691200 2020-10-10 09:58:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @TX_WalkerRanger Very much so!
1314746989897154560 2020-10-10 09:58:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @kylegriffin1 So envious, I would love to be there,  of clean the toilets just to go.
1314745413996478464 2020-10-10 09:51:48 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha! Major ass covering attempt FAIL!!!!
1314744796573954049 2020-10-10 09:49:20 +0800 <Kganley123> Ok, I don't care who you are,  this is funny.
1314744641250492422 2020-10-10 09:48:43 +0800 <Kganley123> "Starting..." 😅😅😅
1314743807901016067 2020-10-10 09:45:25 +0800 <Kganley123> Welcome home! Glad you're safe!

1314741842651488256 2020-10-10 09:37:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @USARebelSway I'll bet that is such a relief!
1314740596787961856 2020-10-10 09:32:39 +0800 <Kganley123> @realTrumpForce @justcallmepatti Well let's just say that unlike beautiful Melania who rocks stilettos like a lady, Kameltoe's were testing wind direction.
1314727353029783553 2020-10-10 08:40:02 +0800 <Kganley123> If anyone didn't see this coming after missed August date, you're smoking crack. No Barr or Durham report. They had to change things up. Remain calm. This is a life or death vote for us. Literally. If POTUS loses how long will cabal let him or his family, or any of us live?
1314726335260975104 2020-10-10 08:35:59 +0800 <Kganley123> I voted early today. Lady next to me requested a ballot to take home &amp; mail back. I stated to election off. I was happy for early voting because I don't trust mailed in ballots. Lady next to me: "I don't either". And THAT America is why we're in this mess. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
1314722702150701056 2020-10-10 08:21:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @ramble_rants Is this rhetorical? If not, there is plenty of vile, disgusting, child porn, abuse, torture on that laptop.
1314722274637869062 2020-10-10 08:19:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump While I agree partly, this is incorrect.  Jesus did not protect the devil, He went to war &amp; committed violence against money changers in the temple. An extreme act of violence was on the cross. That is Holy Love violence. Defending right at times takes violence. Revolutionary war

1314687038818377728 2020-10-10 05:59:50 +0800 <Kganley123> Already voted in person for @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. Let's do this people!!
1314686825332535296 2020-10-10 05:58:59 +0800 <Kganley123> So that's your strategy/arrow Nancy &amp; dems? Purposefully infect @realDonaldTrump @POTUS w/CCPvirus &amp; then try to invoke 25th? Even though he's fully recovered? Wow. That's a weak strategy &amp; already known by us.
1314596804185354247 2020-10-10 00:01:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @VincentCrypt46 Yes
1314555958211747841 2020-10-09 21:18:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @VincentCrypt46 Which is no coincidence. Weather control.
1314555610327740416 2020-10-09 21:17:35 +0800 <Kganley123> Make no mistake, God will not be mocked. The shaking in this country will continue &amp; increase until we as individuals &amp; a nation REPENT in prayer. Only repentance &amp; gratitude bring victory. We don't deserve blessings. Sincerely repent, fast, pray. The demons are strong.

1314301113282125824 2020-10-09 04:26:18 +0800 <Kganley123> @KamalaHarris You're an ignoramous. He paid the $750 as a fee for an extension. He's paid millions in taxes honey, educate yourself instead of flying your legs in the air.
1314300772813688834 2020-10-09 04:24:57 +0800 <Kganley123> Hahaha, face diaper Nancy. You are too funny. You are so scared of going down you're pooping your depends.
1313948470177275904 2020-10-08 05:05:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @dbongino We'll keep you in prayer.

1313840003974193152 2020-10-07 21:54:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @DefTiger Proof?
1313825650239705089 2020-10-07 20:56:59 +0800 <Kganley123> I don't know about anyone else but I will be happy when all this bi-polar schizophrenic nonsense is over. "Something big is going to happen" then nothing. "Booms incoming" then nothing. "So &amp; So is going down" &amp; more nothing. I'm not out of popcorn, I'm out of mood levelers.
1313818980902072320 2020-10-07 20:30:29 +0800 <Kganley123> Yea, not supporting any LEO's until this crap stops. I don't care who or where you are,  if you're part of the organization that uses its power like a Nazi brown shirt, you deserve zero support, zero $$, zero sympathy. Get your crap together!

1313689420495638528 2020-10-07 11:55:39 +0800 <Kganley123> For real?!!! Are you kidding me??!! Are we in Nazi Germany??!! Do something for God's sake people!! This isn't an "optics" moment. This is police being criminally negligent. Yea, support those dirty scum.  @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FLOTUS
1313687621277822982 2020-10-07 11:48:30 +0800 <Kganley123> Me too! Feels great after so much summer depression!

1313675859773911041 2020-10-07 11:01:46 +0800 <Kganley123> Tank is awesome! Very committed to his goals, determined, focused,  heart of genuine 24k gold.
1313612967624269825 2020-10-07 06:51:51 +0800 <Kganley123> Anyone tired of winning yet? Not me, this party is just getting started!
1313612456317648896 2020-10-07 06:49:49 +0800 <Kganley123> We love him too!
1313610158900011008 2020-10-07 06:40:42 +0800 <Kganley123> Actually Michael was the worst first tranny in our history.
1313606276123824128 2020-10-07 06:25:16 +0800 <Kganley123> Yep.
1313606077557080064 2020-10-07 06:24:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Yee haw!
1313605836636258304 2020-10-07 06:23:31 +0800 <Kganley123> @RogerFritz7 Why are you so concerned with numbers? You're missing the forest for the trees. You're gong to quit doing trains because no one is noticing or engaging anymore &amp; your numbers aren't climbing? Wow. That's pretty superficial.
1313605237156900864 2020-10-07 06:21:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @reelpat215 @TimothyNMarsha1 Welcome to the party! Literally. Not The Party, but the party!
1313554628848414721 2020-10-07 03:00:02 +0800 <Kganley123> Thank you,  what a generous &amp; kind gesture!

1313553291368828928 2020-10-07 02:54:43 +0800 <Kganley123> I've just been released from 7 days of Twitter jail for calling Alyssa Milano a negative name that starts with w and rhymes with stench. Because you know sensitivities and all.
1310802020064845824 2020-09-29 12:42:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealJamesWoods Awww...sorry to hear this, so cute. Happy it was peaceful.
1310799093317296129 2020-09-29 12:30:31 +0800 <Kganley123> Any updates on Kanye West's trip to Haiti? I'm thinking it wasn't for a vacation. What better way to gather intel than to send a popular rap artist? People will fall all over themselves to offer info just for a photo op.

1310793098646007808 2020-09-29 12:06:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @CoralineElise The homesickness is from God. You miss Him &amp; He misses you. I get it all the time. This is not your home, you're a pilgrim, visitor here.  Your real home is back in heaven where you came from. That's why you're homesick. You're yearning for God, His perfect love, &amp; perfect place.
1310792021183926275 2020-09-29 12:02:25 +0800 <Kganley123> You're justified in how you feel.  We were asleep at the wheel,  chasing our own selfish dreams or, on the hamster wheel of slavery trying to survive.  Sacrificed our children to daycare for material "stuff" or because we had to.
1310791343547981825 2020-09-29 11:59:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @Wretched1775 I like both. I remember when S &amp; G released the original, it brings back nice memories.

1310788023768891392 2020-09-29 11:46:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @HSRetoucher @GuilloryTracey Ok, not to be a Debbie Downer or pessimist, but we've been sold this bag of goods so long now no one believes it anymore.  Cans &amp; dates have been kicked down the road numerous times.  Still waiting for Durham report due at end of August.
1310785366236884992 2020-09-29 11:35:59 +0800 <Kganley123> @prayingmedic I'm thinking so.
1310784968994349056 2020-09-29 11:34:24 +0800 <Kganley123> This is sad, very sad. How low can a society go?

Gen. Flynn is released NOW to go forth in peace &amp; 100 fold payback blessings!
1310781547675443201 2020-09-29 11:20:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @VFuska @DemsGotTrumped I agree. There's already found to be enough uproar &amp; demonic rebellion, why throw fuel on the fire w/ an HRC arrest. Securing safe, accurate elections should be the focus now.  We need prayer, prayer, prayer, spiritual warfare like Omaha Beach.
1310780480891973633 2020-09-29 11:16:34 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump He'll probably pee green as a reptilian. Or adrenachrome will show up in his blood.

1310364462562512896 2020-09-28 07:43:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @p4trump @BlueNelsonNYC Twitter has been removing Patriot's followers under their censorship rules. We're all rebuilding. Don't judge. It'll happen to you too. It's a badge of honor we carry because we're scaring the crap out of dems right now.
1310363619591217153 2020-09-28 07:40:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @Fibci2 I thought this was an earlier version, however he recently fired back in similar fashion at dungeons moment when they asked about Hunter's $3.5 mil. These snakes are cunning,  don't believe what you see.
1310355862708338689 2020-09-28 07:09:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @robreiner Archie Bunker was right and Gloria a dumb blonde for marrying you.  🥴
1310354976250589184 2020-09-28 07:05:46 +0800 <Kganley123> And just like that,  Biden's dementia went away. "Let's do push-ups man". Who says that crap?
1310354255501389824 2020-09-28 07:02:54 +0800 <Kganley123> @SenSchumer Yep, that's the benefit of being wealthy Chucky. He, and I'm sure you too, can afford to pay high $$$ accountants to find legal tax loopholes. And, if he spent more $$ buying or improving properties than he earned,  then it's a loss. Duh. Don't act ignorant of these things.
1310353583225712640 2020-09-28 07:00:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @Patriot5611 @N_Testie 1st amendment. Or you can claim it's part of your religion or part of your peaceful protest. Anything goes nowadays. Use the enemies tactics against them.

1310193646797385728 2020-09-27 20:24:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @SenBlumenthal Been to Epstein Island there Skippy? Because someone has you by the balls.
1310193306102411270 2020-09-27 20:23:21 +0800 <Kganley123> @DefenderParty And how, pray tell, do you think we should "fix" miscarriages? They occur due to a particular womb not being a suitable environment, improper DNA mix via close kin marriage, &amp; a variety of other biological factors.  Miscarriages are not murders.
1310192034875990019 2020-09-27 20:18:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @DefenderParty You missed my sarcasm. Which is why I said "miscarriage". It's a miscarriage, not a pc renamed term. It's a miscarried pregnancy or life. Your attempt at glorifying the term abortion is failing.
1310188148379406338 2020-09-27 20:02:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @ewarren Shut up.
1310187848797020161 2020-09-27 20:01:39 +0800 <Kganley123> Understand he's faking allot of this.  Whenever he's asked a ? re: Hunter or his illegal dealings he gets lucid &amp; defensive real quick.

1310185741935235073 2020-09-27 19:53:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @DefenderParty What do they call it then? "My PREGNANCY test confirms I have multiplying cells"?   And what the h is a "spontaneous abortion"? Miscarriage? You're brain synapses aren't connected &amp; your conscious seared.

1310180432206413824 2020-09-27 19:32:11 +0800 <Kganley123> When a woman takes a pregnancy test, no matter how early, she pronounces herself pregnant. There is no ? whether it's a viable life.  So why is there a ? of it being a life when she chooses to murder said pregnancy?

1309673083582652416 2020-09-26 09:56:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @ewarren Oh go soak your head loser. What nationality are you claiming this week?
1309667905152319488 2020-09-26 09:35:35 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  My favorite Christmas present for 2020? To see you in front of the decorated WH with FLOTUS, JFK Jr, RFK Jr, Caroline Besset, Julian Assange, Seth Rich. Atlas Shrugged anyone? So is Julian playing Frisco to JFK Jr's John Galt?
1309610969237053440 2020-09-26 05:49:21 +0800 <Kganley123> Get better asap, there's still some fighting to do!

1309593195454500864 2020-09-26 04:38:43 +0800 <Kganley123> This poor excuse for a human is pathetic. "Incredibly good judgment" my butt.
1309592855879405571 2020-09-26 04:37:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @DrShayPhD @GOP There is an agenda by the GOP for sure. But the President wants EVERYONE &amp; EVERYTHING exposed so he's allowing the GOP bad guys to rat themselves out. It's not just dems who are wicked.
1309591837053607936 2020-09-26 04:33:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @Pontifex @UN While at the same time creating an atmosphere of individual confidence, security. Those who sit in ivory towers shouldn't judge. Don't think you've ever been a gal walking alone to her car in a work parking garage at night.

1309531704130826240 2020-09-26 00:34:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @CQEverything I think Pres. Trump may be getting this man a cure? "Don't even talk about your expiration date,  i know my people, you'll be surprised,...I just sent you a little note. "
1309530536247873536 2020-09-26 00:29:44 +0800 <Kganley123> @Daniel4all8 Thank you! Everytime Pres. Trump gives the 5:5 signal I've wondered what is meant.  He took an emergency call during his presser, gave the sign, then later tweeted, "LAW &amp; ORDER". I'm thinking another ds'er was dealt with?
1309519030638706694 2020-09-25 23:44:01 +0800 <Kganley123> What does 5:5 mean please?
1309276005169684480 2020-09-25 07:38:19 +0800 <Kganley123> Love her a million times over!!! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump please grant her a meeting. What an inspiration! Thank you @Liz_Wheeler
1309259679936118784 2020-09-25 06:33:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is why cops are vilified. LEOs are meant to uphold the Constitution. These dirty cops are TRAITORS!!! RETWEET TO HOKD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
1309232973716140032 2020-09-25 04:47:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS   Cut to the chase and designate GS a terrorist organization.
1309227512392630272 2020-09-25 04:25:37 +0800 <Kganley123> No, he's still running a shadow government

1309226515976998912 2020-09-25 04:21:40 +0800 <Kganley123> We all hope so. And no counting votes after polls close on Tuesday night.

1309120896150503426 2020-09-24 21:21:58 +0800 <Kganley123> With all the $$$ GS has you'd think he'd follow the trend of his minions &amp; get some face work. At least an eye bag repair. But when you're emperor Palpatine I guess it doesn't matter.
1308968013404626944 2020-09-24 11:14:28 +0800 <Kganley123> @WilkowMajority @dbongino This suggestion might hurt. You might consider stopping the show. Science shows laughing helps reduce cancer considerably whereas anger has the opposite effect.  Healing &amp; wholeness is about forgiveness, joy, peace. Meditation is crucial. Could be God's way of saying job done.
1308966825909194753 2020-09-24 11:09:45 +0800 <Kganley123> I can't wait until we all look back on 2020 &amp; say, "remember when we were all locked in our homes for weeks, then wore stupid masks in public for months? Man, we were dumb f**ks."

1308960620960604161 2020-09-24 10:45:06 +0800 <Kganley123> Am I the only one who LOVES Progressive ads? They're comedy genius.
1308959956985499655 2020-09-24 10:42:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @THEOUTSIDERZKY Welcome Sir, prayers for you.  I still miss my business, it was like another baby I was raising. I was in my 20's I'm now 59 &amp; it still sucks hard sometimes.
1308958292505366528 2020-09-24 10:35:50 +0800 <Kganley123> @THEOUTSIDERZKY Sorry to drone on but I totally identify with your situation. My husband lost our $17 mil bz *poof*. 6 months. long story. It was my identity, my everything, my life, passion, soul. In the 80's when things were REALLY rolling. Years later I realized my misplaced priorities.
1308956356326518785 2020-09-24 10:28:09 +0800 <Kganley123> @THEOUTSIDERZKY It sucks. But sounds like God is shutting all doors for you there.  For better bigger future reasons elsewhere? Safety is first.  Businesses come &amp; go, it's a thing, an object. Chapter 7, 9, 10, 11. Wealthy people leverage it to get wealthier.
1308955188833652737 2020-09-24 10:23:30 +0800 <Kganley123> @THEOUTSIDERZKY Go to God. Right now He's in the midst of making massive changes in people's lives.  He wants to be #1. Maybe your business became an idol, your identity. Everything has a season. Maybe God wants you &amp; your family elsewhere so He can bless you bigger there.

1308948122903736327 2020-09-24 09:55:26 +0800 <Kganley123> @WilkowMajority @dbongino Pure lemon juice, apple cider vinegar. No lie, they're acids but neutralize the body chemistry. Cancer only grows in acidic environments. Detox ionizing foot baths. Research &amp; eat foods that are neutralizers.
1308946825123000320 2020-09-24 09:50:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @PepeMatter @JuliansRum He has a podcast on Bitchute. He's getting press now. Imo he should lay low, nothing good ever comes from discussing anything with the enemy, they just twist everything into lies. But I guess he wants his 15 minutes of fame.
1308944801623146497 2020-09-24 09:42:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @MajorPatriot Ya think?!
1308944707112726528 2020-09-24 09:41:51 +0800 <Kganley123> I guess he thinks he's an American now. He may want to lay low, since his uncle is a pedo, queen mum and his father did some nefarious things, and maybe ol' Harry's life might come under a microscope if it hasn't already.
1308900236685905922 2020-09-24 06:45:09 +0800 <Kganley123> I LOVE corn!!! I especially like watching the harvesting.

1308898238968332292 2020-09-24 06:37:12 +0800 <Kganley123> want to "pull a Lincoln" and supercede states rights &amp; autonomy. He can't be that President dictator.

1308894799756435460 2020-09-24 06:23:33 +0800 <Kganley123> I certainly hope so because He's got to be bored to tears listening to me make the same prayer requests for over a year now.

1308610059333558272 2020-09-23 11:32:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @damilare @kanyewest We need our artists &amp; they are underappreciated. They love the night because it's quiet, they can ponder,  imagination &amp; inspiration flows, they can release the "inner them" because most others are sleeping so there's no condemnation.
1308609145336074240 2020-09-23 11:28:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @damilare @kanyewest They are completely ignorant. There are 4 innate temperaments which a human has their entire lives. Can't be changed. Choleric, sanguine, melancholic, phlegmatic. Sometimes any 2 combo of those.  Any other diagnoses is b.s. I should have said artistic disposition. It's a blessing
1308603111502569472 2020-09-23 11:04:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @314khalea I love Mark &amp; Patricia, good for them! "Abolish the suburbs" the ignoramus chants through her germ encrusted mask.  Because she likes living Somalia style in her poop filled hovel. I did notice the rings on her fingers. Pretty bugie for someone chanting that.

1308501597173940224 2020-09-23 04:21:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @damilare @kanyewest He does wear many hats, &amp; as many artists are, is whimsical. For which he receives negative comments.  Because people don't understand nor appreciate the artist's temperament. My son is an artist. They love the night, can be broody, subject to mood swings, &amp; inspirations erratic.
1308442036131885056 2020-09-23 00:24:25 +0800 <Kganley123> @damilare @kanyewest Whether we care about someone's judgements or opinions does not negate the fact of their occurrence. If one is a spokesperson &amp; wants their messages consistently understood, then logically one would frame &amp; present them in the highest manner possible.
1308414408775938056 2020-09-22 22:34:38 +0800 <Kganley123> Did anyone else have trouble sleeping last night? I was wide awake, could have run a 10k. Tried to meditate but was too hyped for whatever reason. ????
1308413896726896640 2020-09-22 22:32:36 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest As a public figure, you always want to put your best foot forward. Always convey your messages to be correctly received. Perception of others of not only our messages but our self presentations is important.  Humans make judgements about each other w/in the first 3 seconds.
1308413267648352258 2020-09-22 22:30:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest No, but let's put it this way: if you want your message to cross all language, cultural, nation groups, then proper English is the best way to have your message correctly interpreted with the greatest impact.  Other countries learn proper English in schools not our slang.

1308406605533323265 2020-09-22 22:03:38 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @atensnut Very excited!
1308406467616178178 2020-09-22 22:03:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President Sir, @realDonaldTrump  @POTUS we have gone this long w/out the stimulus, we can survive longer or give it up entirely if it means winning against the cabal. At this point, whatever it takes. Americans, it's time we cooperate like ants &amp; bees to keep our hive!
1308361028502077440 2020-09-22 19:02:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @blaze0497 And "she's" an ugly tranny.

1308136716885094400 2020-09-22 04:11:11 +0800 <Kganley123> Does Nancy P &amp; other Dems realize appointing a person to SCOTUS does not constitute an impeachment  "high crime &amp; misdemeanor"? Are they desperately scared or what?

1307713481781567489 2020-09-21 00:09:24 +0800 <Kganley123> @HSRetoucher Cloning has been around for a while.  I lived on a high end Angus farm where allot were clones. Anytime there was a structural defect in a natural cow it was butchered to select out the DNA from reproducing. Artificial insemination was the reproduction method.
1307524553195753477 2020-09-20 11:38:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @VincentCrypt46 Really creative!

1307512311276421120 2020-09-20 10:50:02 +0800 <Kganley123> I'm done, over all of it,  spent. Demoralized, depressed. I just want off this planet please God. Have mercy on me &amp; make it so. No hope, no dreams,, no desire, no future, no joy, just lonliness &amp; boredom. My heart no longer has motivation, for anything but being out of here
1307510976938274817 2020-09-20 10:44:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @CQEverything Dear God me. Anything uplifting please.

1307507369463562241 2020-09-20 10:30:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @Preciouslindy RIP Officer. RIP. Prime Rib &amp; a soft bed for you in heaven buddy.

1307505804086452225 2020-09-20 10:24:10 +0800 <Kganley123> Has anyone ever lived an entire life knowing where they AREN'T supposed to be,  but never knowing where they're SUPPOSED to be or doing? And everything has always ended up being 1 huge clusterf**k?

1307378624366931968 2020-09-20 01:58:48 +0800 <Kganley123> My faith, energy, hope is depleted. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for everything you &amp; your team have accomplished &amp; will. My heart has failed me &amp; I'm done.  There is no future for me, I've fought so hard all my life "in the system" only to fail time &amp; again because I saw

1307376624027885568 2020-09-20 01:50:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @_SCA3_ Me too.
1307327854217060354 2020-09-19 22:37:04 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest please establish an account on Parler and Clouthub along with Twitter. No censorship going on there &amp; you'll reach a broader audience.
1307320331812524039 2020-09-19 22:07:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest stand strong in what you're undertaking. God has given you a voice, following, ideas, for a reason. "To whom much is given, much is expected". Do your part in the take down &amp; witness to the music industry. You're on the right path. "If not you, whom, if not now, when."

1307314234116567040 2020-09-19 21:42:56 +0800 <Kganley123> President Trump would not have compiled a list of nominees &amp; added to same if he had no intention of quickly filing a vacancy. Imo. Another brilliant chess move as he calculated the dem meltdown perfectly to use for his greater purposes. They are so easily played.
1307309521442725888 2020-09-19 21:24:13 +0800 <Kganley123> @BeeJaySee @dinmadness Good.
1307278571396673536 2020-09-19 19:21:14 +0800 <Kganley123> Not a fan of RBG, RIP. Don't make her out to be in Saint in death as was done w/ McCain. She stood for the murder of innocents.
1307277837859127296 2020-09-19 19:18:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @italia515 @mabomm1 Trump speaks, tweets, signals, &amp; even dresses in code all the time.  As does FLOTUS. EVERYTHING they do has meaning &amp; purpose, nothing is by chance. 5d chess, game theory. He'll repeat certain words &amp; numbers in speeches for a reason. The "virus" has dual meanings as does vaccine
1307273648097517570 2020-09-19 19:01:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @ProudMaga12 Time &amp; place. A campaign rally is no place to mention the passing of a high level official. It's about manners &amp; decorum. He knew everyone's Twitter feeds etc. would advise them of the status. I suspect he'll make a statement today.
1307195281616764928 2020-09-19 13:50:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth Ready, willing, able!

You don't scare nor intimidate us. Remember, don't sh*t in your own sandbox cuz you gotta live there too. How was life in CHOP/CHAZ?
1307194295179378688 2020-09-19 13:46:21 +0800 <Kganley123> @John_F_Kennnedy Long overdue!
1307194162836418560 2020-09-19 13:45:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Good! Next time use someone else's account by proxy. Use their phone,  computer,  whatever.  Just put a sign in your tweet to let others know it's from you.
1307193709264396292 2020-09-19 13:44:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @PepeMatter Exactly. I've been saying the same thing.  She's been deceased a while.
1307193389524201472 2020-09-19 13:42:45 +0800 <Kganley123> @TankSchottle Thank you Tank!

1307188890269147142 2020-09-19 13:24:52 +0800 <Kganley123> RBG has been deceased for a while imo, they're just know letting out the "news".

1306777125043740672 2020-09-18 10:08:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @QTFife @8Notables @VincentCrypt46 Exactly. It's easy to do nature here in Wyoming. I raised my sons w/out TV, still don't have it. We hunt, have a garden, Cody water has zero additives and is fantastic! Never wore sunscreen, tried it once I got hives.
1306766449487130626 2020-09-18 09:26:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @Ambi4T Excellent! More of these should be made.
1306764618283405312 2020-09-18 09:18:58 +0800 <Kganley123> So is everyone in authority too chicken to do anything about Soros? Just askin' for 1000's of Americans &amp; millions worldwide.

Big money evil means big power. My hunch is everyone is too chicken to do anything about him.  Because there's ample evidence to fry him.
1306761855755415557 2020-09-18 09:07:59 +0800 <Kganley123> @8Notables @VincentCrypt46 How do we get in sync with the earth's natural resonance?
1306760851366445056 2020-09-18 09:04:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @thehill What? Being honest? Being beautiful people that love our country? Michael go back to diddling yourself.
1306758012615319552 2020-09-18 08:52:43 +0800 <Kganley123> @OratorBlog @Anonagain3 So this is why DC area weather is so constantly crappy with overcast &amp; rainy weather. Blue skies are very rare. When i was growing up we had beautiful skies &amp; weather.

I've called &amp; asked all over re: payroll tax reduction &amp; now I'll do it for Medicare. I've even reached out to you. Crickets. You keep touting these exec. orders but as yet there is zero implementation. Election pandering?

I don't see any lowering of Medicare from my check either. What's the point of exec orders? Election marketing? Info please.

1306611523331059718 2020-09-17 23:10:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @Dinmarto @SgtGarrisonUSA Blocked it, thank you for the heads up!
1306611189296709634 2020-09-17 23:09:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @MrMichaelBurkes 🥓🖐. Had to throw the bacon in there.  Because...bacon!
1306610395751178241 2020-09-17 23:06:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @ScrapperChris Thank you for posting this, it helps keep things in perspective. I started reading it yesterday and twitter removed it from sight mid-read. That's another strategy they use.  If I click on something to read or RT, they blank it out, it just disappears.
1306607982021550080 2020-09-17 22:56:33 +0800 <Kganley123> @BarbaraThayer1 @RogerFritz7 Many times. Very discouraging. It's been my life story.
1306474517900849152 2020-09-17 14:06:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @shilo1949 @SusanIverach Ridiculous. Over- policing. LEOs take note: we love you when you stand for righteousness but we despise you when you are the gestapo. This is a harmless man exercising his freedom. Go arrest real perps like BLM or Antifa. Oh, i forgot. You're afraid of them.
1306473825463197696 2020-09-17 14:03:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @QDROP8 @absentmind314 This too will fail and they'll lie lie always. Or plead 5th.
1306473541504655361 2020-09-17 14:02:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @george_revere @Oldgloryfighter What about Portland?!
1306471369949892609 2020-09-17 13:53:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @theonlyrymac Excellent for them!

1306468089534402560 2020-09-17 13:40:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth Could be a green screen background. It's definitely a cheap room someplace.

1306433422785540096 2020-09-17 11:22:55 +0800 <Kganley123> Can someone somehow get a message to Kanye &amp; tell him to migrate to Parler.
1306433147341471744 2020-09-17 11:21:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Migrate to Parler where you'll be FREE!

1306428485896826880 2020-09-17 11:03:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @Avenger2Toxic @PaddyMrs Amen!
1306428427348525062 2020-09-17 11:03:04 +0800 <Kganley123> @cjtruth Love. Because of LOVE that died on the cross for me &amp; my sins.
1306428114671558658 2020-09-17 11:01:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @mikejon61399654 @JoAnn99167659 Welcome Sir!
1306427366529359873 2020-09-17 10:58:51 +0800 <Kganley123> @ThatTrumpGuy @starryskylol Big deal. 3very one of them will just lie lie lie. Another waste of time blowing hot air.
1306427057191047174 2020-09-17 10:57:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @cvpayne @HMLoeschMcK Charles! Where have you been? Good too see you back! I no longer have TV so can't watch you,  twitter is my source now.
1306426313800953856 2020-09-17 10:54:40 +0800 <Kganley123> If anyone gets locked out by Twitter, ask a trusted friend if you can tweet by proxy using their account. Simply add a code or sign in the tweet to let everyone know it's you who is actually tweeting. I would gladly host  Patriots.
1306425821322567681 2020-09-17 10:52:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @RealCandaceO Tell him he can communicate by proxy using another trusted person's Twitter account.
1306425433412444160 2020-09-17 10:51:10 +0800 <Kganley123> @DineshDSouza Truth!!
1306362786507759616 2020-09-17 06:42:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @127bama @noname76089779 Because he signs their paychecks &amp; puts out hit orders.
1306362585013350400 2020-09-17 06:41:25 +0800 <Kganley123> then that evil survives to return in other forms 7 TIMES STRONGER. The house must be swept clean and all openings shut to their raising their ugly heads again. That's scriptural.
1306362584082206720 2020-09-17 06:41:25 +0800 <Kganley123> Let me explain. I am very grateful to President Trump, Cue, Cue team, etc. for ALL the miraculous achievements. They are miracles. But I also know how evil works. If the high level demoniacs are not swiftly dealt with,  if we see no justice, if they're merely slapped on the hand,
1306336773153280000 2020-09-17 04:58:51 +0800 <Kganley123> #shovesubpoenasupyourasses We're DONE with hearings, all they do is lie! We want arrests NOW mutherf***ers, our country is burning!! I can't breathe in Cody from the fire smoke, others have lost homes, lives,  businesses!
1306336019210362880 2020-09-17 04:55:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @blusie @Qtah17 Thank you,  your exactly right!
1306335803329576960 2020-09-17 04:55:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @Qtah17 Bfd, how many opportunities are we going to give these clowns to lie with no results. They can shove the subpoenas up their as**s.
1306335098560634880 2020-09-17 04:52:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @TrumpJew Fox News covering for Georgie Porgie because he signs their paychecks @newtgingrich
1306334651787567105 2020-09-17 04:50:26 +0800 <Kganley123> How disheartening would it be to all who have patiently waited and endured through 2020 for no high level arrests to be made. It would truly erode our trust in "the plan", people involved,  &amp; administration.
1306333781146525696 2020-09-17 04:46:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @PepeMatter True, but they haven't been dealt with legally which is what is needed.
1306314181059080192 2020-09-17 03:29:05 +0800 <Kganley123> @cajun4trump Love him!
1306313787620773888 2020-09-17 03:27:31 +0800 <Kganley123> #indictmentsnotsubpoenas  Enough already! They're all going to lie anyways.
1306313162413674497 2020-09-17 03:25:02 +0800 <Kganley123> @zeusFanHouse @RacySicilian Dear Jesus God, how much more testimony is needed??!!! If there isn't enough evidence by now then all investigators are pathetic limp noodles!! John Q Public has compiled enough evidence to hang these scum. Indictments NOT subpoenas!
1306311333105737728 2020-09-17 03:17:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @RyanAFournier Indictments would have been better, how many more times will they be allowed to blather on &amp; on w/out arrests?
1306310985737621504 2020-09-17 03:16:23 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Good place to be. Then get up and fight with all of heaven behind you.
1306309661994360832 2020-09-17 03:11:08 +0800 <Kganley123> @QTAnon1 Hahaha!
1306308565171281920 2020-09-17 03:06:46 +0800 <Kganley123> @PepeMatter That doesn't mean they've been dealt with,  only sold real estate.
1306307354518933506 2020-09-17 03:01:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @doqholliday Well "they" hated JFK and Bobby so it's a no Brainerd "they" will hate JFK &amp; Bobby Jr.
1306234837108285441 2020-09-16 22:13:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest If you're a Patriot, you're covered in prayer daily. Put on the full armor of God &amp; Mind of Christ, not only to resist the fiery darts of the wicked one, but to deflect and melt them.
1306234202132627456 2020-09-16 22:11:17 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Most of the prophets spent their lives in the desert, similar to Cody. Away from worldly distractions. There, they quieted themselves in much meditation &amp; contemplation &amp; were taken deep into God's &amp; the Universe's Truths. This is where my wonderings have been answered.
1306233442024058880 2020-09-16 22:08:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest How far down the rabbit hole are you willing to go? Because once you know what you know, it's like the Hotel California. You can check out anytime you like,  but you can never leave. It's not only about Biblical Truth, it's about ALL Truth.
1306227494429667328 2020-09-16 21:44:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Whoo hoo! I love College football! A purer version than pansy NFL.
1306225744016596992 2020-09-16 21:37:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @janiszewski_q Clones, while viable physically, don't have souls. Only God can infuse a soul. So they aren't really clones,  but flesh robots with AI brains.
1306224662511144961 2020-09-16 21:33:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Look into their deaths. There may be more there than you realize.
1306224345509892097 2020-09-16 21:32:07 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest The music industry is one of the biggest plantations. A plantation within a plantation. Total usury of artists, and then disposal of them.  Same with athletes. It's all a gamed system for the elite, we're just playing their role in it.  Have heart Kanye, the system is ending.
1306223483140022272 2020-09-16 21:28:41 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest It's been this way since the beginning. The Beatles were horrendously ripped off. MJ bought their music rights at auction. Then refused to sell them back to Beatles. I always wondered the reason because I felt MJ had to have a bigger plan in mind.
1306222368134586369 2020-09-16 21:24:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @kanyewest Start drilling down on Michael Jackson, Prince, &amp; more deaths. Follow the money. Also start listening to @SantaSurfing17 especially from this past month.Informative.

1305863784695816199 2020-09-15 21:39:22 +0800 <Kganley123> @QPrayerTeam I pray the money the radical left is using will be transferred into our hands NOW Jesus, for Your Word says the wages of the wicked are stored up for the Righteous. In Jesus Christ Holy Mighty Name!

I'm psyched, I'm happy, keep it up! Because when your now very short time is over, it's our turn.  And we're awesome at what we do! Right @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ?
1305530916735913991 2020-09-14 23:36:40 +0800 <Kganley123> A big thank you &amp; shout out to Antifa, BLM. I love the fires &amp; destruction you are doing. I'm grateful for your efforts to turn the above earthly plane into a homey environment for yourselves akin to the hell pit from which you came. Because you see, you're destroyers. We're

1305204815622881280 2020-09-14 02:00:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Did anyone else notice the Presidential Seal on the lectern in Freeland, Michigan, has what appears to be gold bars behind the eagle rather than individual rays? True @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. Could be stylized rays I don't know.
1305143253251928064 2020-09-13 21:56:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @yogagenie Truth!

1304820379945377793 2020-09-13 00:33:15 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Probably not.
1304819487703670784 2020-09-13 00:29:42 +0800 <Kganley123> @RacySicilian This needs to happen much more often to these miscreants. Baboons behave better.
1304819060161441792 2020-09-13 00:28:00 +0800 <Kganley123> @no_silenced Good! He's a horrible driver anyway.  Token to comply with the liberal agenda just like Danica. Her cross over to NASCAR didn't gain high results.
1304818184935993344 2020-09-13 00:24:32 +0800 <Kganley123> Could someone dm me please re: Nesara/Gesara? I have ???. Trying to determine truth from fictional hope.

1304780000629989376 2020-09-12 21:52:48 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump ALL our lives would have been very different.  YES, a huge price must be paid!

1304630319350337536 2020-09-12 11:58:01 +0800 <Kganley123> @trumpvoterdarre We love him!
1304629674186690561 2020-09-12 11:55:27 +0800 <Kganley123> @pushforward40 Been there many times during this journey.  Prayers offered. It's very tough at times.  Put on some praise &amp; worship music or 432 hz tones from You Tube. God tones.
1304626366558552065 2020-09-12 11:42:19 +0800 <Kganley123> @PatriotsChris45 Understand God has a better place for you. It was just a season in your life,  His purpose for you is elsewhere. He's moving allot of pieces around on His chess board right now. Go deep inside and ask Him to show you where He wants you.  He loves you infinitely.
1304440145408524289 2020-09-11 23:22:20 +0800 <Kganley123> Anyone who meditates for just 10 minutes on the gravity of what happened on this day in 2001, will be gobsmacked by the deep realization that our own government attacked us. Like a cancer in our own bodies or an auto immune disease. That sh*t eating grin on Bush's face...
1304420636140294145 2020-09-11 22:04:49 +0800 <Kganley123> May we all spend as much of this day as possible in prayer, in spiritual battle, in repentance &amp; remembrance, in humility &amp; Thanksgiving.  Protect our President &amp; his family, White Hats, patriots, Anons, Cue team, worldwide church &amp; those hoping &amp; praying for our DJT reelection.

1304417886178484225 2020-09-11 21:53:53 +0800 <Kganley123> @OldNavyUSA It wasn't Muslims as the planners &amp; perps. Stooges maybe, but we all know the Truth, come out of the dark.
1304402652046831619 2020-09-11 20:53:21 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS please tell me Walmart shipping of children via Maersk shipping lines, which they own, back &amp; forth from Wuhan China has been shut down? Please. #SaveOurChildrenWorldwide
1304401701214978048 2020-09-11 20:49:34 +0800 <Kganley123> Never forget this day 19 years ago when our government &amp; other nefarious actors attacked our country for the sake of $$$. RIP all those who passed that day &amp; later.
1304401271810531328 2020-09-11 20:47:52 +0800 <Kganley123> @CallingDrLove69 Yes.

1304397271887298561 2020-09-11 20:31:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @Oldgloryfighter October 31 won't be pretty.

1304288810981752833 2020-09-11 13:20:59 +0800 <Kganley123> 9/11 was an inside job folks. Never forget. We need justice.

1304286785636245509 2020-09-11 13:12:56 +0800 <Kganley123> @IAWTP1 I relate to "the alone"
1304286683941072896 2020-09-11 13:12:32 +0800 <Kganley123> @IAWTP1 I was praying for God to show me &amp; confirm Truth to me, not only Biblical but ALL things. He kept leading me to information or people who had it. Because I've NEVER settled for what I was told if it didn't feel right. I wanted always to know the "why". R
1304285412374933504 2020-09-11 13:07:29 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump Gorgeous photo, those people are so blessed! Who gets this close to not only our President but AF1? Would you ever ever in a million years make it to Wyoming?
1304284352256200705 2020-09-11 13:03:16 +0800 <Kganley123> @AwakenedOutlaw Hahaha. Wait. I'm a girl so this conversation has to drag out muuuch longer.

1304282940184997888 2020-09-11 12:57:40 +0800 <Kganley123> @69MimiLisa Oh yes. How they determine someone's IQ from tweets is beyond me but they're obviously suffering from a bloated ego &amp; high opinion of themselves.

1304276951050235904 2020-09-11 12:33:52 +0800 <Kganley123> Can anyone please tell me how to comply with or effect the payroll tax cuts for my employees &amp; business? I can't find answers anywhere.  Called the WH, my state reps, my US reps, the IRS ( who are closed). @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
1304276037509890051 2020-09-11 12:30:14 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @GmanFan45 We haven't begun deferring taxes yet, no one can tell us how.
1304275812703584256 2020-09-11 12:29:20 +0800 <Kganley123> @govkristinoem Wyoming Ma'am. In the black, low taxes, no carry permit needed at all, lowest population of any state = room to breathe.  Our freedom rocks better.
1304274463144448000 2020-09-11 12:23:58 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump They won't let it happen.
1304273796816416768 2020-09-11 12:21:20 +0800 <Kganley123> To those in larger population areas blessed with a President Trump rally:  soak it up, remember every moment,  take those videos. We'll probably never see him in Wyoming, so consider yourselves very very fortunate. Like the leprechaun's gold.  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

1304242836884185089 2020-09-11 10:18:18 +0800 <Kganley123> 9/11. I will NEVER forget. The image burned indelibly into my brain: Bush Jr. sitting in that classroom unmoved with a sh*t eating grin on his face when informed of the news. No panic or impetus to leave the scene for safety. Just sat there. Because he knew all along.

1304233713350242304 2020-09-11 09:42:03 +0800 <Kganley123> Why did the Qmap go blank? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Q is dropping like crazy &amp; I can't get them.
1304233473738043394 2020-09-11 09:41:06 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump You are amazing Sir, we are thrilled and I'm humbled to have you as our President. I was a tough sell,  couldn't commit 100%, I was about at 95%, lots of emotional ups &amp; downs. @SantaSurfing17 helped allot with getting me firmly off the ledge.

He was not receptive &amp; after telling me to go to the IRS he abruptly hung up on me. NOT the kind of reception I was expecting at your switchboard. Very poor
1304093731222478857 2020-09-11 00:25:49 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I just contacted the White House switchboard for info on payroll tax relief compliance for businesses.  IRS has no info, nor my state or US reps. The operator was curt, snotty, &amp; unhelpful. I asked him to
1304042956987359232 2020-09-10 21:04:03 +0800 <Kganley123> @RepAdamSchiff I pray for your soul, you're pitiful right now. Jesus loves you even in your misery of being lost and demonically tortured.

Taxes were very low, interest rates very high.  We had HUGE amounts of disposal income.  I had my own SAAB, apartment, went shopping, dined out. I was 19. Now we pay over 55 +% total in taxes.

You've been MK Ultra-d through the school and media system.  Take authority &amp; control of your mind &amp; life. We are only as smart &amp; aware as we allow ourselves to be.

1304036809194614785 2020-09-10 20:39:37 +0800 <Kganley123> @realDonaldTrump I believe the "news" media are boxed in. In fear for their incomes &amp; possibly lives, their only recourse is to report as their told no matter how ridiculous. MK ultra plays out in many forms, some may be red pilled but fearful. Others are playing a role as directed in this movie.

This is literally a battle between Good and evil. Please choose the Good. We don't know you Corrine, but as a fellow human being we love you.

1303287768043237379 2020-09-08 19:03:12 +0800 <Kganley123> @AmirAminiMD @realDonaldTrump Because it's true! Anyone knowing anything about the Pentagon realizes it's full of career war mongers. The military exists for war.  If not for wars,  why the need for any military? They have to justify their existence somehow.

1302389537411223552 2020-09-06 07:33:57 +0800 <Kganley123> @prettypeacejimi Yes. Religion is man's interpretation of God and imposed rules based upon that interpretation. It removes the personal 1 on 1 communion &amp; communication with God, Jesus, &amp; The Holy Spirit. If you're a Christian they reside in your bodily temple.
