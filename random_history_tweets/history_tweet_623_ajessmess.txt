1321941624847396869 2020-10-30 06:26:58 +0800 <ajessmess> @DivinaFarms @mmpadellan Cases are spiking like crazy in my small city right now. I don't think they'd get it, but our overall mood is just kind of ruined. Especially with the snow. It just seems like Christmas now, not Halloween. Sigh.
1321922846340210688 2020-10-30 05:12:21 +0800 <ajessmess> @TRAPTOFFICIAL Cool Cool. I'll go burn my Trapt album now. Just kidding, I don't have one, and never have. #YouSuck
1321917240120238080 2020-10-30 04:50:04 +0800 <ajessmess> @mmpadellan My kids aren't even interested. We don't want to spread or get anyone's cooties. Plus it snowed a foot already, so that's no fun to trick or treat in.  We'll have scary movie night instead.
1321871648794931200 2020-10-30 01:48:54 +0800 <ajessmess> @NYPDShea You let a child torturer keep his pension? Why? Can you please explain that so the people understand?  Michael Valva literally tortured his child to death. I can see no excuse for this decision.

1321554344714489857 2020-10-29 04:48:03 +0800 <ajessmess> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump The one with smart, socially distanced people, and not the one with cootie laden dirty white trash. #TrumpVirus

1321383603276640256 2020-10-28 17:29:35 +0800 <ajessmess> @JayEdResists She‚Äôs not bright, certainly no genius. She has no character. She‚Äôs just as big of a p.o.s. as her husband.
1321380888270131200 2020-10-28 17:18:48 +0800 <ajessmess> @KimKardashian I‚Äôm so over the braggadocio. YAWN. We all wish we could live a life of eternal vacations, like you. Alas, we live in the real world.
1321232506457255938 2020-10-28 07:29:11 +0800 <ajessmess> @JasonMillerinDC Why did you use random quotation marks? I see that your level of intelligence rivals that of your orange master.
1321232085982433281 2020-10-28 07:27:31 +0800 <ajessmess> @JasonMillerinDC You are an icky person. On so many levels.
1321171149393309697 2020-10-28 03:25:22 +0800 <ajessmess> @robbrozz Some people just don't feel the need. Some aren't comfortable handling them. Some just shouldn't have them around. It's whatever your comfort level is. You'll be ok without one though, I think. I hope things don't get that scary.
1321169951193874433 2020-10-28 03:20:37 +0800 <ajessmess> @JasonMillerinDC Oh really, I didn't know Joe Biden was President already, and had issued a national outdoor mask mandate.   Oh, that's because he's not, &amp; your dump of a president has done NOTHING to prevent the spread of C19. Including having rally after stupid rally full of dirty white trash.
1321158236066648066 2020-10-28 02:34:04 +0800 <ajessmess> @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden Honey, did you forget to take your meds today?
1321157683630673920 2020-10-28 02:31:52 +0800 <ajessmess> @JasonMillerinDC No it‚Äôs not. You know what is though? Spiking your pregnant girlfriend‚Äôs drink with an abortion inducing drug. Why aren‚Äôt you in prison?
