Lots and lots of soybeans and pork. Former IA Gov. Brandstad is ambassador to China. I have no doubt there are certain interests involved.

That includes for the invalids, the terminally ill, the oppressed, etc., who are unable to get to an "official church building." In the early church days, the church met in homes.

1336703929535565826 2020-12-10 00:07:06 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @MajorPatriot I lost my vote to count when after I was checked by my ID, other states didn't, and other false votes canceled mine. I was disenfranchised.
1336700971204939778 2020-12-09 23:55:20 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @TheRealMaddog58 The case Texas and the other states bringing to SCOTUS isn't necessarily about the resulting fraud, but about unconstitutional methods used to conduct the election, disenfranchising other states who followed the rules.
1336700220051251201 2020-12-09 23:52:21 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @VincentCrypt46 Isn't this what happened when the 3 kings followed the star to find Christ? I read this may have been a possibility...🤔

1336465263148085248 2020-12-09 08:18:43 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @ArtBrent @BrandonStraka Because the case by Texas against PA, GA, MI, WI is much more serious, covers more ground, much more urgent. 7 other states joined on w/Texas. Pertains to Constitutionality of election processes and results. Besides, PA case wasn't dismissed totally. Just injunction.
1336456760769605634 2020-12-09 07:44:56 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> 17, huh?

It featured a political symbol like that of the Trump lion head, only it was a buffalo head, red and blue. One side GOP, the other DNC being represented. The "buffalo party" combination of both smashed through, wrecking both other parties.🤔

1325242767996563463 2020-11-08 09:04:32 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth I don't worship Trump. I support him, and recognize him as God's anointed. I worship and thank the Lord God Almighty for raising him up for this time, as the prayers of the remnant have enabled it to be done. Praise You, and thank You, Lord Jesus!🙏😁
1325240071734386690 2020-11-08 08:53:49 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum I ditto you. Trump is always unexpected in his actions. That's one reason why the establishment hate him. He doesn't play by the DS rules. And that's another reason why I support and fight for him.
1325238619657867265 2020-11-08 08:48:03 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum I am. Dropping red pills to all in my rcf, and my mom. Telling them what's really going on, the facts of the blatant fraud, etc. One person (staff at my rcf) is still way asleep, refusing to believe anything else but what the MSM tells her (especially FNC). It's tough with her.

But, one person is worried when Trump is announced victor, the riots will start again and be even worse. I told her notice Trump supporters not doing that.
1325160028454727681 2020-11-08 03:35:45 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> I hope @POTUS @realDonaldTrump screenshots MSM websites and newspaper hard copies declaring (early) the news that Biden wins... and then takes a picture of him holding it after he is made the official winner after fraud is proved. Y'know, like the famous Truman photo.😁👍

They keep having him speak via video, but hide the fact he's drugged and controlled by nefarious usurpers.
1325090483174043648 2020-11-07 22:59:24 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum Biden did say, "a dark winter."

1323056027051401216 2020-11-02 08:15:12 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @PepeNewsNow I saw my first TV Christmas commercial even before Trick or Treat started this Halloween... So much for Thanksgiving...

Their reason? Going to be poll watchers! A good chance they're for Trump - as they're the ones that would wear Patriotic and YS flag masks!😁🇺🇸👏

Unless most folks here don't want to place Trump signs in their yards for fear of retribution, a distinct possibility...

1321510345291292672 2020-10-29 01:53:13 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @drawandstrike So, being said, what if the Dems "take" the election by just having their MSM report false results (say Biden won)?
1321508844057624576 2020-10-29 01:47:15 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth Interestingly enough, in Waterloo/Cefar Falls, IA, there are a lot of Biden-Harris signs all over, but relatively few Trump-Pence signs. These twin cities are very blue, though (as is the overall county they are in). I'll be shocked if they flip...

1320505725723049985 2020-10-26 07:21:13 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> Same here. Too many man-made rules for whichever different denominations. I have a close personal relationship w/Jesus Christ, and led by the Comforter (Holy Spirit). Stick to His Word and the Spirit's leading - not by manmade dogmas thinking they know what makes God happy.

Or is it because flu cases are being reported as Rona? Flu deaths are just as high or higher during flu season, but we don't have the same reaction to it (lockdown, mandatory masks).

Also, the shield can be not only used by a single individual, but also form a wall of defense when used in tandem as a group of people (i.e. in a circle).

In "IJ Temple of Doom," the high priest of the cult rips out the heart of the victim of a Kali ma sacrifice. It's incredibly gruesome. I don't recommend watching this film. I saw it before - will never watch again.

1317259750007054338 2020-10-17 08:22:52 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @BiasedGirl However, my mom is elderly &amp; feisty. She bought an "I 💗 Trump" shirt right when they went on sale at the Trump campaign site. She also got a couple Trump yard signs. She lives in a very blue small town, &amp; her neighbors across the street vote Biden. 🤞
1317255568097185793 2020-10-17 08:06:15 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @BiasedGirl I agree. Here in my city there are hardly any political candidate signs in yards, for both Trump and Biden. It's unusual.  I know, though, many Trump supporters are flying with stealth against political radar.

1317229379005665283 2020-10-17 06:22:11 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @patton6966 Just read a thread by @GinaPhi94724925 that she posted talking about a recent experience of prophetic anointing by the Holy Spirit during one of their prayer groups. They were directed to bind a strongman spirit over this nation, the Egyptian god of death &amp; darkness, Anubis.🙏
1317112533510180867 2020-10-16 22:37:53 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Checker31761921 The head of the household does the anointing. I am no longer w/my parents, so I did mine. If you are not, or live w/others, ask their permission. I live in an RCF w/11 others, plus rotating staff. I asked the supervisor of my home, she said yes. I had permission &amp; so I annointed.
1317101642400075776 2020-10-16 21:54:36 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @GinaPhi94724925 I have annointed the four corners of my home at their foundations. I annointed the doors and frames (posts) of my home, as well as the door to my secret prayer room. We have done this as a family for years. I concur with you as to the protection.

1315455449446125568 2020-10-12 08:53:13 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth I'm on Parler and Gab, as well. Staying here on the frontlines, though.
1315454263536033792 2020-10-12 08:48:31 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum Yeah. I've known about this meaning for awhile now. My Heb/Greek/Eng study Bible had that translation. Same as "pharmakia" translating as potions/medicines/drugs in my study bible.
1315451451406249984 2020-10-12 08:37:20 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth Jesus said, "Some things can only be overcome by prayer and fasting..."

1315418219629420546 2020-10-12 06:25:17 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @MajorPatriot @SirWilliamScot5 But apparently Seal Team Six whacked the double of OBL, not the real one. To cover this up, fake burial at sea, ST6 identities revealed, ST6 helicopter shot down on setup mission, and Iran blackmails Hussein admin to keep the whole thing quiet. Did I get that right?

1315396776480866304 2020-10-12 05:00:05 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Annakhait I knew Seal Team 6 was taken out by Hussein administration (possibly on his orders) due to the circumstances surrounding it,  but not the reason why. I'm VERY interested as to the answers to the questions. Waiting patiently...🤔

1313257682942464006 2020-10-06 07:20:05 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Did I say Obama created a special counsel to prosecute Flynn? No. I did not. You did not read what I said. What I said was concerning the mandate of the special counsel. And subsequent document release about it, as well as its findings. Also the documentation release about Flynn.
1313253792406736897 2020-10-06 07:04:37 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports No excuses when you can read the documentation online showing the truth.
1313253308161761280 2020-10-06 07:02:42 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports As later released documents show (you can read for yourself), Flynn was setup and framed to get him out of the position to blow the whistle on the Obama administration's malfeasance concerning abuse of FISA, illegal unmasking, spying, and money schemes in intelligence agencies.
1313251887270039552 2020-10-06 06:57:03 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports The Special Counsel did not prosecute Flynn. The task was to look for "Russian Collusion" from the Trump campaign/administration, and if anything was solidly found without reasonable doubt, to pass on recommendations for prosecution. They found nothing to corroborate.
1313250436351221764 2020-10-06 06:51:17 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports As well as never-trumpers who have personal interests should the rule of law be followed. They all have a stake in it. Money, political or professional interests, connections, favors, possibly some blackmail. They DO NOT want this DA to find the dirty laundry.
1313248925651013632 2020-10-06 06:45:17 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Again, you probably have not read the documentation on the Stone case. A biased juror and prosecution malfeasance on sentencing caused Barr to also look at it again.
1313248125902090241 2020-10-06 06:42:06 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports I suppose you have not read any of the documentation pertaining to the Flynn case. Documentation shows that Flynn was coerced to making a guilty plea. Exculpatory evidence was withheld by defense and prosecution. The DOJ got ahold of the evidence, and so dropped charges.
1313247399897374727 2020-10-06 06:39:13 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Yes, he does. The former AG, prosecutors were all Liberal Progressive, formerly working in the Obama, Clinton, etc., administrations. They like lawfare, bending and twisting law to forward an agenda. They don't like Barr because he's actually enforcing established laws.
1313246550894804994 2020-10-06 06:35:51 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Sigh. So much for logic...
1313243618568699904 2020-10-06 06:24:12 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Barr is following rule of law, as written, according to the Constitution. Just because you don't like those laws, or the process infringes on your Progressive agenda, is irrelevant. If you do not like those established laws, then either 1. Go into law; 2. Get elected to Legislate
1313238573605425154 2020-10-06 06:04:09 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @M2Madness @JenniferJJacobs @SalehaMohsin It's gonna be like a entrance you see professional WWE wrestlers do before a big match starts!🤣👏👊

1313236040338026501 2020-10-06 05:54:05 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports I did. Did you read my answers? I am not okay with organizations that try to put individuals into the judiciary to trample on the Constitution. But, you have answered my question, now. You only hate people appointed to judiciary that don't legistlate to forward Leftist agenda.🤷‍♀️

1313230166458544129 2020-10-06 05:30:44 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports You shouldn't throw rocks yourself.

1313224448149983233 2020-10-06 05:08:01 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports They're not DS. I would think Obama running his shadow Presidency, George Soros paying to get Progressive DAs and judges appointed, FBI &amp; CIA weaponizing their intelligence abilities to surveill people and use lawyfare on those the DS finds problematic is more deepstate.
1313222540295315460 2020-10-06 05:00:26 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports I like judges that interpret law according to the Constitution, not legislate it. I am an Independent. Not all Republicans agree with my views. And no Progressive Lib I have encountered agree with my views. They would rather the courts legislate to enable their agenda.
1313219217026617349 2020-10-06 04:47:14 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports The Federalist Society is not Deep State. It is an institution to advocate for interpretation of law according to the Constitution as written, not opinions trying to rewrite and take lawfare liberties with what the Constitution lays out (thereby not adhering to the Constitution).

If the Left Liberal Progressives won Presidency and majority of the Senate, and they are influenced by ACLU and Open Society Foundation to appoint judges, would you be upset at as well? Or only at Concervatives/Constitutionalist orgs?
1313201869347590153 2020-10-06 03:38:18 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports ACLU, Open Society Foundation

The question is, do you feel the same way about Liberal Progressive activists having a hand in appointing judges as well?
1313194231545106432 2020-10-06 03:07:57 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @realDonaldTrump Wonderful! Glad you've got your spring back in your step! God does answer prayer! #MAGA😁👏🇺🇸

If Hillary Clinton had won, and was able to fill judge seats Obama left open,  would you feel the same way about her appointing Left Liberal Progressive judges, who undoubtedly would legistlate from the bench, and not interpret via the Constitution?
1313178995949817856 2020-10-06 02:07:24 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Actually, Reps (especially Constitutional Conservatives) are upset because Roberts doesn't interpret law according to the Constitution, which is what the Judicial branch is supposed to do as outlined in the Constitution. Instead, he is taking on the Legislative, creating law.
1313176071559360513 2020-10-06 01:55:47 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports As for the Federalist Society, if they have judges that rule according to interpretation of the law by aligning to the Constitution... that's not a DS trait.
1313175658869252097 2020-10-06 01:54:09 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports My question is this... If Hillary Clinton had won, and filled the various judge vacancies left behind by Obama with judges of the Progressive Liberal leanings, would you still have a problem? She wouldn't have pulled them from the Federalist Society, but from other DS org.
1313170236976304129 2020-10-06 01:32:36 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports And Trump's picks are their own single persons. There are other Federal judges and district judges that also legislate from the bench with Liberal based decisions. The 9th Circuit is replete with them, and Hawaii is a big one. The DC circuit and SDNY is quite Liberal, &amp; Sullivan.
1313166831746772992 2020-10-06 01:19:04 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports Uh, does Judge Sotamayor ring a bell? Put in by Obama. And she has stated that, yes, her ethnicity (and personal beliefs) will shape how she rules. Not the Constitution. Obama put her in there to advance the Liberal agenda, legislate from the bench.

And other Senate and Congress candidates who are up for re-election also use taxpayer dollars for their campaigns; i.e., Abby Finkenhauer of IA mailings even include "paid for by US taxdollars" on it

To make it more difficult for Biden to hear the transmission. Maybe why he told @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to "shut up..."

1306557875066675201 2020-09-17 19:37:26 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> Something interesting... will wait for further happenings...
1306541976377069568 2020-09-17 18:34:16 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth The question the Holy Spirit always asks me: "Do you trust Him (Jesus and The Father), even though you have NO idea what is going to happen or how it will exactly turn out?" I just take a deep breath, release everything back to Him, and thank Him for taking care of me.
1306504288303284224 2020-09-17 16:04:30 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> I wonder what other BOOMS are gonna happen this week...🤔

1306497707226411009 2020-09-17 15:38:21 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Terithi1 @MajorPatriot Popeye isn't Disney. It's Fleischer, which then went to Paramount. And Daffy Duck isn't Disney. He's Warner Bros. Still, all animation houses have dark secrets if you're awake enough to see...
1306456188058509312 2020-09-17 12:53:22 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @VincentCrypt46 I saw a hologram Michael Jackson concert was done a while ago... can't remember where it was done. But it was hologram technogy.

Dems know they can't beat Trump and other Reps in other Congressional races. So they plan on stealing the election by just "taking" it. @Johnheretohelp talks all about it in a very interesting thread...

1306336668291608576 2020-09-17 04:58:26 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @PepeMatter Gee, I wonder if the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and military could do something about that? Like, oh, start a new branch for fighting in outer space or something...🤔😏
1306335775689244673 2020-09-17 04:54:54 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @SteveInmanUIC Almost a brush with death...😏

1306327215047692290 2020-09-17 04:20:53 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum Maybe I should get an Instagram account...🤔 "Wanna see my Renegade?" Yeah... that was disgusting.🤮

1306318700400840705 2020-09-17 03:47:03 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @drawandstrike Still annoying, but they also may be really stupid and 1: outright lie, or 2: throw each other under the bus. Number two would be much more entertaining.😏
1306317604445999104 2020-09-17 03:42:41 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @EyesOnQ Same. And proud to serve as a digital soldier alongside all of you. And to quote our @POTUS, @realDonaldTrump, "The best is yet to come!"🇺🇸👊😁

1306308227920023552 2020-09-17 03:05:26 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @TheLastRefuge2 The Obama shadow government. In other words, Harris is voted in, Joe is the Trojan Horse, and Obama is pulling the strings of the administration for a fourth term shadow presidency. This is reprobate and disgustingly evil!👹👹👹🤬🤬🤬
1306304883071627265 2020-09-17 02:52:08 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @WhiteHouse FINALLY. BUT... I'm still pissed at Iowa players telling Iowa fans that if they don't mandatorily agree to support the BLM movement the Hawkeye players support, then they should just not watch/attend games, or consider themselves Hawkeye fans. Jackasses.🤬

1306294401849753600 2020-09-17 02:10:29 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth My ONLY tweet on this subject. I don't focus on this. I don't believe it is central to importance to the battle. Too much cause for division. I pretty much ignore it, really. Got too many much more important issues to spend energy, focus, and prayer on. God bless, Patriots.🙏🇺🇸🤬

I wait for further information to come out, and don't knee jerk. If it turns out to be true, it needs to be investigated and prosecuted.

1305977511084466178 2020-09-16 05:11:17 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Existential2020 True. I'm just saying it could be used as an angle for the DS and Dems and MSM to try to derail the peace accords.
1305976141434490880 2020-09-16 05:05:50 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Existential2020 Interesting, now that talk of SA joining the peace accords w/Israel is being floated...

1305667464076947456 2020-09-15 08:39:16 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum When you know the opponent plays their strongest card, and when you play the Trump card, your opponent has no cards left to be able to change the rest of the match to their favor, thereby allowing you to take the match (i.e. in Eucre).
1305653622575902720 2020-09-15 07:44:16 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @stillgray Reminded me of that old '80s TV show "TJ Hooker" where William Shatner (as Hooker) every show jumped on top of the bad guys car hood as it was trying to drive away in escape...🤣

1305647288287727620 2020-09-15 07:19:05 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @tomselliott @JoeBiden A former Biden campaign staffer reported on 4chan that Biden is in early stage Dimentia. He is on meds for it. A side effect of the meds is that he can't control when he pisses. That's why he takes no questions - he needs to run to the bathroom.

1305568514930102272 2020-09-15 02:06:04 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Existential2020 They may be doing a test balloon to guage the people's reactions and opinions. Dependent on that, we may see something else happen...

She couldn't believe it, but there I was, and lab results didn't lie. She decided not to give me a transfusion, and just let my body naturally refill my blood supply.

1303504884872998914 2020-09-09 09:25:57 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Bob452020 He achieved his biggest dream. Make $20 Mil for acting services rendered. (He got that w/"Cable Guy"). Broke open the doors for actors to get huge deals. Anyway, after that, he turned political and started really going out there. I believe he made a deal with the Devil, literally
1303503991180070912 2020-09-09 09:22:24 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Bob452020 I was an avid Carrey fan over 15 years ago. One of the things I liked about him back then was that he purposely didn't get involved in politics, and even made fun of the celebrities that made the big political speeches during award ceremonies... but... then...
1303496555102703616 2020-09-09 08:52:51 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth Daniel. Prophesies are some of the most powerful in the Word. Surrealistic imagery, powerful spirituality, God's Word and truth. Daniel is also a man of God who would have fit into our country today, probably joining along with Anons. "Close up the book till the time of the end."

1303454519590875136 2020-09-09 06:05:49 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Phaethon314 I would like to know more about the bloodline subject. Where are some good places to start looking for information? ThanQ!
1303449325301903367 2020-09-09 05:45:10 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @lurch_the @JuliansRum I usually do. And if have have other questions, I'll go do more of my own research, as well.

1303423891575058436 2020-09-09 04:04:06 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @JuliansRum I appreciate all the amazing autist, anons and Patriots who have done tones of research, though, and chose to share with the rest of us who may not have the tools, skills, or knowledge to do deep digs. However, I still go look for that research and original doc info sources.

1302391009683308544 2020-09-06 07:39:48 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Jobu4Real @JuliansRum I remember that one! Lol!
1302108063554564096 2020-09-05 12:55:29 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @TrumperWavin @VincentCrypt46 Well, "cracker" comes from the name the slaves would call the masters who would whip them (whip-crackers). Most were white, but yes, there were others. And so the term "cracker" applied to whites by blacks over the decades. I find it just at offensive as the N word.
1302105378533126144 2020-09-05 12:44:48 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @Gunny_Q Ironically, I am not all night tonight, for other reasons as well. I'm in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at the hospital being tested for my seizures. Have been here 2 days. Will be here the rest of the weekend. Difficult days.

1302057706216468481 2020-09-05 09:35:22 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @kylegriffin1 So, does that mean you won't question the sincerety of Trump's faith, either?  As for the award, I seem to remember somebody getting a Nobel Peace Prize for doing absolutely nothing. I feel the Medal of Freedom going to a bunch of Hollywood celebs cheapened it, too.
1302048142188306434 2020-09-05 08:57:22 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @M2Madness That's like dad talking you out to the wooshed for a whipping then thanking you for spending some quality time with him...
1302042992774176775 2020-09-05 08:36:54 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @prayingmedic I just talk to Him. Share what's on my mind and heart. Be totally honest with Him. He loves talking and listening. He loves to hear His children talk to Him, but He likes them to remember to make sure to stop and listen to Him when He speaks in return.

Decodes and deprogrammer of the MK Ultras by @GinaPhi94724925. Follow her a definite must! Anyway, I will keep an eye on this. I live in IA. Gov. Reynolds won't stand for it.

1300624586141302784 2020-09-01 10:40:40 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @elenochle I don't mean to virtue signal. This is what I had known. If what I had known, then I was incorrect. Nothing wrong in being deceived for so long, without help of being corrected, with no source of correction. I have now been corrected.🤷‍♀️
1300622642593107971 2020-09-01 10:32:57 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> I am looking out my window on my cool night, at a bright, white lit moon. I pray to my Lord God, praising Him, thanking Him, basking in His glory. I restore myself in Him, physically, mentally and spiritually. How great is my God, as His Spirit guides me in prayer for others...🙏

1300601799930507264 2020-09-01 09:10:07 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @cjtruth This lady is awesome to follow. I am starting to learn a lot. I never new the significance about my favorite color to the Cabal (purple)... I even took color theory in college for design and psychology. I highly recommend others to follow her (@GinaPhi94724925 ).
