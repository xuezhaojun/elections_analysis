The actual test re-scans your sample from 15 to 50 times.  Ask the facility how many times yours was done, because if it's 30+, FALSE positives increase dramatically.
1337053887845588995 2020-12-10 23:17:42 +0800 <SatireWorks> @tomvaughan One of the biggest ones is the fact that Pelosi never legally passed "ObamaCare" in the House.   She had a person from NY, who was not a certified member of Congress, vote "Yeah" on the Bill.

1337046052931768323 2020-12-10 22:46:34 +0800 <SatireWorks> The CNN report is from 2017 just after President Trump took office.  That means both the 2018 and 2020 elections went forward with disregard of the corruption in every state still using the machines!
1337044733831614467 2020-12-10 22:41:20 +0800 <SatireWorks> LAUGHABLE: There is a new video from Portland in the news today, showing the latest scuffle with ANTIFA "children".

1336486316662525957 2020-12-09 09:42:23 +0800 <SatireWorks> @WallStXyz @KamVTV Follow the money... There are many familiar names associated with Dominion as investors, stock and lean holders, not the least of which is NY Billionaire, George Soros.  If the Chinese aren't the "majority" stockholder, they're likely a close second.
1336485066151784449 2020-12-09 09:37:25 +0800 <SatireWorks> Looks like Kemp is just another in a long list of American politicians who are in bed with the Chinese.  That "Ultra-King" size bed is getting very crowded...
1336450869651361793 2020-12-09 07:21:32 +0800 <SatireWorks> @larryelder When it first dawned on Hillary and Bill that the Chicago Communist mob was determined to put Barry in office, they started to claim he wasn't even a legal candidate.  Rumor has it, one little "heads up" that Chelsea would be killed, ended the Birther Thing for them.
1336448963793154054 2020-12-09 07:13:57 +0800 <SatireWorks> Tragically, a large percentage of Americans still have no idea how corrupt the U.S. Judicial System is from top to bottom.  Blacks get most of the outrage and attention, but in reality, being a White male (compared to a White female), charges, convictions, &amp; sentencing is harsh.

Hillary and Bill Clinton were the first people to claim Obama was not born in America (the "birther" theory). Reportedly, Obama's "people" may have threatened to kill Chelsea, and suddenly the Clintons never said it again.  Never underestimate things.

1335642732539367424 2020-12-07 01:50:17 +0800 <SatireWorks> If you haven't noticed already, I suspect there is a 'battle royal' brewing between Orlando and Tampa to see which one can be more supportive of liberal Democrats.

1335634894131777536 2020-12-07 01:19:08 +0800 <SatireWorks> Actually there is a "moment in time" when this happened.  In the early 1970s, American educators descended into the liberal swamp with two dramatic agendas: (1) "Students have the right to fail." (2) "Young people have the right to sue their parents." Classroom discipline died.

1324027730049064963 2020-11-05 00:36:24 +0800 <SatireWorks> Trump WINS if he gets... Pennsylvania and Arizona (278 E votes) or Pennsylvania and Nevada (273 E votes) as long as he holds on to Georgia.
1324026076604096513 2020-11-05 00:29:50 +0800 <SatireWorks> The #Trump organization is convinced that the President will still win in AZ, PA and WI.   Others are claiming AZ will stay with Biden because of escapees from California.  That doesn't make any sense.  Democrats are happy with idiotic Sacramento.  Why would they leave?
1324024954015358977 2020-11-05 00:25:22 +0800 <SatireWorks> BREAKING:  ALL FOUR MEMBERS OF "THE SQUAD" HAVE BEEN RE-ELECTED.  That's a real tragedy that four people who hate America, will still be in Congress. 😠
1324012991491301376 2020-11-04 23:37:50 +0800 <SatireWorks> Fox News is masking all their bias by focusing on Trump's win in Florida.  Their inaccurate reporting Tuesday night in which they were heavily criticized, must be hidden with the smoke screen of "feel good" stuff for moderate and conservative viewers.  YOU ARE BEING PLAYED.
1324011923390795776 2020-11-04 23:33:36 +0800 <SatireWorks> Attorney General Josh Shapiro on the ballots being counted in Pennsylvania: “We’re going to get an accurate count, it’s the law.”  Nice of him to promise to include an "accurate count" of all the INACCURATE/ILLEGAL votes!  https://t.co/1Olavr5Z3x
1323999861457506304 2020-11-04 22:45:40 +0800 <SatireWorks> Frank Luntz use to be a GOP darling with all his political predictions.  Then he had a bad year.  He crossed the road and became the darling of the Democrats.  Recently he seemed to speak well-enough to be accepted by both sides.  Now he is on the GOP's "s-list" again. ⁩

1323997861890187267 2020-11-04 22:37:43 +0800 <SatireWorks> Democrats in Pennsylvania are busy looking for almost 700,000 Biden votes from the big cities and mail-in ballots, to overcome Trump's lead.
1323997154004865024 2020-11-04 22:34:54 +0800 <SatireWorks> A Federal Regulation already exists.  Technically, states allow many people to vote that are excluded from casting a vote for President/VP.  Perhaps that's the foot in the door the feds need to control the whole ticket.
1323994776971157504 2020-11-04 22:25:28 +0800 <SatireWorks> Pennsylvania GOP leaders say "Trump is going to win Pennsylvania...If the rules are properly applied".
1323993951007813634 2020-11-04 22:22:11 +0800 <SatireWorks> Media people on both sides of the fence had said for the last two weeks, "Pennsylvania is the key" to this election.  So WHY did we see videos pop up before 9 in the morning Tuesday of GOP observers being denied entry or Biden signs and handout in polling places?
1323992542292123650 2020-11-04 22:16:35 +0800 <SatireWorks> The Number One opportunity for CORRUPTION in this election was "mail-in voting".  Is it any surprise that #Biden has held that advantage in virtually every report?
1323860674091560960 2020-11-04 13:32:35 +0800 <SatireWorks> "Late votes" are breaking 2 to 1 for Trump.
1323860119340355585 2020-11-04 13:30:23 +0800 <SatireWorks> Can Trump still win?  YES.  301 may be his number.
1323859645031731200 2020-11-04 13:28:30 +0800 <SatireWorks> IOWA is called for Trump.  He leads in Pennsylvania, BUT... counting has been stopped for the night (so they can figure out what they need to get a Biden win).
1323858854602547201 2020-11-04 13:25:21 +0800 <SatireWorks> Violent faction of ANTIFA members have now replaced earlier, more restrained people in DC by the White House.  Pro Trump people are also on scene so...
1323857966009901056 2020-11-04 13:21:49 +0800 <SatireWorks> BREAKING:  Fox News has suddenly gotten a little skiddish on their AZ call for Biden.  NewsmaxTV is reporting there MAY BE some significant pockets of voters yet to report.  Other media is also questioning the AZ call.
1323850541882089473 2020-11-04 12:52:19 +0800 <SatireWorks> My phone has had that same message nearly every day for the last two years...
1323849820176601088 2020-11-04 12:49:27 +0800 <SatireWorks> Decision Desk HQ projects that Trump will defeat Biden in Ohio.
1323845943544942592 2020-11-04 12:34:03 +0800 <SatireWorks> 11:38pm  Trump MUST hold on to every state he currently leads in or he may lose the election...  Penn. is looking better but no decision coming from there until Thurs. or Fri.  NM just went Biden.
1323845144752328704 2020-11-04 12:30:53 +0800 <SatireWorks> Fox News is playing with the scenario that Biden gets to 270 now that AZ has gone to Biden.  They are not predicting a Biden win, but they are bending over backward to flirt with a Trump disaster.
1323844020175601664 2020-11-04 12:26:24 +0800 <SatireWorks> A 7 point lead with 3/4 reporting is the reason.
1323843771096879107 2020-11-04 12:25:25 +0800 <SatireWorks> BAD NEWS....
1323843219126444033 2020-11-04 12:23:13 +0800 <SatireWorks> 11:30pm  AZ is called for Biden.  That is very bad for Trump!

1323830168792813570 2020-11-04 11:31:22 +0800 <SatireWorks> The citizens of Wisconsin are sick and tired of all the radical liberals in Madison.  Perhaps there is finally a successful backlash against the ultra liberal base in the Capital.

1323828361085489152 2020-11-04 11:24:11 +0800 <SatireWorks> How come millions of Americans still vote for any Democrat?  The sun was barely up this morning before corruption by Democrats in Philly was on full display.  NY came soon after as voting machines in primarily GOP centric areas, failed.  MI came later.
1323827605892669440 2020-11-04 11:21:11 +0800 <SatireWorks> Madison, WI, the Capital, is filled to the brim with insanely radical, liberal Democrats who think of Berkeley, Cal. as a brother city, has 77.5% of its vote going to Biden/Harris.  Last time I had breakfast in the city, when I spoke truth about Obama, people walked out.
1323826464442195969 2020-11-04 11:16:39 +0800 <SatireWorks> Biden's claimed "hometown" of Scranton, PA has voted FOR TRUMP!!!

1323700571854020608 2020-11-04 02:56:24 +0800 <SatireWorks> As expected.  Pennsylvania is "ground zero" for Democrat's voting fraud activities today!

1323683252306141184 2020-11-04 01:47:34 +0800 <SatireWorks> Any failures outside of major cities in Pennsylvania, will dramatically affect GOP votes.  No holds barred in PA today.  CHEAT, CHEAT, CHEAT...
1323682679980761088 2020-11-04 01:45:18 +0800 <SatireWorks> Well, maybe if Obama could have "started" his average day at 10am, and wasn't stoned just after dinner, he might have gotten some work done and filled the vacancies!
1323680938904137733 2020-11-04 01:38:23 +0800 <SatireWorks> Probably wasn't a good idea to have her face on camera...
1323661681185181699 2020-11-04 00:21:51 +0800 <SatireWorks> Democrats on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning: "We know Joe Biden won.  We just haven't stopped counting the votes yet..."
1323660732026806272 2020-11-04 00:18:05 +0800 <SatireWorks> I suspect #SandraSmith's audition for a change in networks must be about over.  Many nets will have a massive hiring campaign after they fire everyone currently on staff soon. BILLIONS in support money from private sources and LIES have failed to sway people in this election.  https://t.co/wmd6Q5M353
1323659344563576833 2020-11-04 00:12:34 +0800 <SatireWorks> The Federal Prison system has versions of "GITMO" right here in the continental U.S.  They're referred to as 'secure communications units'.  As indicated, it puts a person into solitary confinement where they can't communicate with their fellow Seditionists.  https://t.co/w9QlNQ5BRP
1323657716078989312 2020-11-04 00:06:06 +0800 <SatireWorks> In his closing campaign remarks, brain-dead #Joe encourages supporters to get out and vote "...to save our Democracy..."

1323651981349736449 2020-11-03 23:43:19 +0800 <SatireWorks> #Trump is going to end up with more than 300 Electoral votes.  Don't let the totally unreliable MSM convince you otherwise.  In 2016, Trump was obviously the winner by 8:35pm ET, but TV networks didn't declare until about 11pm just to keep viewers watching.  Media Whores.  https://t.co/IlSwjBG2rZ
1323650761985789953 2020-11-03 23:38:28 +0800 <SatireWorks> @AriFleischer  NOT ONE WORD YET from Fox News about extensive irregularities at polling places in both PA and NY.   Unfortunate you didn't mention that when talking to Leftist drone #SandraSmith.

1323643564753039361 2020-11-03 23:09:52 +0800 <SatireWorks> Gays and Closet Gays are overwhelmingly the biggest demographic in the "multiple-offender" category of sexual offenders.  So often, when a male Democrat is exposed for child sex, it is with a boy, not a girl.
1323640578890993665 2020-11-03 22:58:00 +0800 <SatireWorks> Time to scream this to the fraudster cities and states all day long: If they can't play by the rules and have to cheat, then they simply can't participate.

This could create lines that are hours and hours long.  Too many people might have time conflicts or simply resolve themselves that there's enough "other voters"!  https://t.co/AMdjfamyd6
1319685301380448266 2020-10-24 01:01:09 +0800 <SatireWorks> I hear radical liberals want #Biden to adopt a new campaign ID... #JoeBribem.  They're actually proud of his level of corruption and deceit.

1319683247199162368 2020-10-24 00:52:59 +0800 <SatireWorks> RUSH is reminding listeners today that "ObamaCare" was actually designed to FAIL.

1319659228429156352 2020-10-23 23:17:32 +0800 <SatireWorks> The last half hour of the Thursday night debate had the most hesitations and stumbles by #Biden while he kept looking at his watch.
1319657716588138498 2020-10-23 23:11:32 +0800 <SatireWorks> A similar fraud is used in groups that want you to "join" them.  What may be a $25-$50/month "membership", is made available "on a trial basis", for $1.00.  This is simply a way for them to get your credit card information. When they gain thousands in a week/month, they're gone!
1319656551452475394 2020-10-23 23:06:54 +0800 <SatireWorks> Perhaps the biggest scam on the Internet today, is "Special Offers" for consumers to get a product for "FREE" if they "Just Pay Shipping".  Most often you will be subject to a $90 recurring product shipment, that's hidden in the fine print.  Canceling on the first day is ignored.  https://t.co/MoU3dUJwtC
1319654109721612289 2020-10-23 22:57:12 +0800 <SatireWorks> It's very troubling that #PresidentTrump didn't directly respond to #Biden's lies by saying: "You're blowing smoke up everyone's backside because all the major media outlets haven't exposed your corruption.

1318206872894275584 2020-10-19 23:06:24 +0800 <SatireWorks> "Look at me!!!" has been the social agenda for years.  Purple hair, numerous tattoos, insane clothing.  It's all the same with the rioters.
1318205194971320320 2020-10-19 22:59:44 +0800 <SatireWorks> Just a thought if you are afraid:  If you see a bad video, simply discuss it without retweeting it.
1318204143559999490 2020-10-19 22:55:33 +0800 <SatireWorks> Reportedly, there is a 20% gap between the number of Americans who like what Trump is doing and those who say they are voting for him.  Is that simply because they don't want to admit it publicly?
1318203363834683393 2020-10-19 22:52:27 +0800 <SatireWorks> I got the impression back in 2016 that Jeb didn't want to run, but it was expected of him by the family.  Perhaps he was not up for the challenges that were coming and knew the Bush name was going to be drawn into the NWO mess.
1318060308792037376 2020-10-19 13:24:00 +0800 <SatireWorks> I guess you think reminding people that previous reports have associated Hillary and Huma with "snuff films" and wearing the actual face of a 12 year-old girl as a mask, should automatically be dismissed? The reports were based on Weiner lap top videos that "sickened" police.
1318054679771860992 2020-10-19 13:01:38 +0800 <SatireWorks> @SteveHiltonx @NextRevFNC Study GOP/Deep State/Fox News Commentator, John Sununu Sr.  He ran GOP "Northeast Corridor" for years and assumed control of H.W.B.'s NWO upon his death.  Romney's puppet master too.
1318050913156739074 2020-10-19 12:46:40 +0800 <SatireWorks> @marklevinshow  @TuckerCarlson  Who was a "close friend" of all of them?  NH's #JohnSununuSr, the politician who ran the GOP's "Deep State" Northeast Corridor for years, and has now combined the reigns of the Bush NWO with it.  The Globalists stretch from NH to FL to TX.

1317850347159826433 2020-10-18 23:29:41 +0800 <SatireWorks> Isn't the legal term "aiding and abetting"?
1317848119728607233 2020-10-18 23:20:50 +0800 <SatireWorks> And somehow this comes as a surprise to you? Think of local police or sheriff departments who place fake sex ads in the media to entice a response.  Without their ad, no one could act on such a thing.  BUT corrupt judges refuse to properly dismiss such cases of ENTRAPMENT.
1317846914046504962 2020-10-18 23:16:03 +0800 <SatireWorks> You already know that elderly people in nursing homes are routinely "helped" to vote.  But have you ever heard this law exists (to help fraudsters)?  "Nursing home patients are exempt from showing any identification in Tennessee."

1317842081164001280 2020-10-18 22:56:51 +0800 <SatireWorks> Disney Corp. is the Number One donor to the Democrat Party in Florida.  Undoubtedly the same is true in California.  Odd that a GOP state allows the park open, but a Democrat state has made reopening nearly impossible.
1317841103937261569 2020-10-18 22:52:58 +0800 <SatireWorks> If a Democrat is running for District Attorney or Attorney General in your state, the chances are they are being financially-backed by billionaire George Soros.  These are the same people letting criminals walk free every day.
1317840364624105474 2020-10-18 22:50:01 +0800 <SatireWorks> When all is said and done, Deep State info from both Republicans and Democrats will be on full display.  SW has repeatedly held the position and reported that the Bush family headed the GOP side and the Clintons, the Democrat.  #JohnSununu Sr. must be questioned by Congress/FBI.

I have no idea why any American parent would send a child to public school or a liberal college in this day and age. If a sacrifice to your living standard has to be made, isn't your child worth that price?
1317306697396965376 2020-10-17 11:29:25 +0800 <SatireWorks> @Italianmike @darhar981 Truth is... Young females go out to a bar or dance club and spend so much time taking pictures of their group or exchanging texts, they never see that 10 guys are trying to get their attention.  Then they go home and complain they didn't meet anyone!
1317278887706066945 2020-10-17 09:38:55 +0800 <SatireWorks> They shouldn't worry.   It's not "close" at all.  Trump is going to pull so far ahead now, the election will make McGovern's failure look a lot better.  This is like Jimmy Carter being replaced by Obama as "The Worst Ever".
1317277820045807619 2020-10-17 09:34:40 +0800 <SatireWorks> You may have missed it today, but when #Wallace was speaking with fellow Leftist, #SandraScott on Fox News Friday morning, he referred to the first debate as "My Debate", not "Our Debate" or simply "The Fox Debate".  Shallowness is a brother to Falsely-Inflated Ego.
1317276695699869697 2020-10-17 09:30:12 +0800 <SatireWorks> @Hoosiers1986 @HillaryClinton That wasn't nice.  You know Hillary doesn't like to be overshadowed by anything else.  200,000 from COVID really is a kick in the butt for HRC.  She only has about a hundred on her "score card".

1317273226175807493 2020-10-17 09:16:25 +0800 <SatireWorks> We'd like to be supportive of #OldJoe's "Build Back Better" program, so we have arranged for the entire family to reconstruct a deteriorating wall at GITMO.  Don't be concerned about transportation Joe.  We'll arrange that after you all are done at Central Booking. 😊😄😁😆😂🤣

The Anti-American, Islamic and Muslim radicals already elected to Congress, aren't even waiting for the Election.  They're already demanding Biden promise to put a Muslim on the Supreme Court!!!!

The last time someone with a conscious from Florida was elected to a national office (West in the House), within 90 days he pointed out fraud.  National GOP in DC told FLGOP to redistrict him into a Democrat territory so he couldn't be re-elected.

1315876920299606016 2020-10-13 12:48:00 +0800 <SatireWorks> 100% of U.S. media is portraying the current battle over the Supreme Court in an odd way.

1315751621079502848 2020-10-13 04:30:06 +0800 <SatireWorks> So Biden has an ambulance follow him wherever he goes.  Seems like a Coronor's van would more likely be put to use.  Anyone know if Tim Cook from Apple has given an Apple watch to Joe yet, to let him know if he is dead or alive each day?

Just like other organizations, it list abductions of young children who "may be with their mother".  Past statistics indicate a mother perpetrates 3/5 of "parental abductions".  Don't help hide them when they show up with a sob story.

Of course family members may have moved a 1,000 miles away and it's too expensive to own a dog.  Fri. and Sat. nights are no different than Sun-Thurs.  Very depressing.

1306991112226209793 2020-09-19 00:18:58 +0800 <SatireWorks> Unfortunately, the answer to your Soros question is "Yes".  This week Fox cut off Newt when he even mentioned George's name.  Sometimes it's not "all about the money".  Seems like senior ownership and control at Fox News are liberal Democrats.  They pine for acceptance in MSM.

What are authorities doing at every level, to prepare for massive unrest and destruction when Biden loses?  One step would be to end "catch and release" standards NOW, and openly PUNISH people.
1305507141579689990 2020-09-14 22:02:12 +0800 <SatireWorks> It's sad to see this image (100% Biden supporters) that is supposedly along I-4 in Florida.  From Daytona to Tampa, there MUST be a major presence of #Trump2020 every day for the next 50 days!!!  Get a bumper sticker or Trump flag on your car now!
1305503675490631680 2020-09-14 21:48:25 +0800 <SatireWorks> @WestPointWeber Why do you leave out the first major "lesson on sex" from the Democrats?  When #PresidentClinton was busy getting "tune-ups" in the Oval Office, the teenagers began to think of oral sex as the new "goodnight kiss".
1305502638818185219 2020-09-14 21:44:18 +0800 <SatireWorks> @drdavidsamadi It appears there will be a long, drawn-out series of legal battles by the Democrats if #Biden does not "win" in the initial election counts.  Remember, Biden has already been told not to concede under "any circumstances"!

1305183688284610560 2020-09-14 00:36:55 +0800 <SatireWorks> Might be interesting to remind Old Joe that Hillary Clinton was dead set against NAFTA when Bill's handlers said it had to be passed.  She was taken to the "woodshed" over that issue and told "No!" for once.
1305183007993724932 2020-09-14 00:34:12 +0800 <SatireWorks> Glenn is spot on with his statement: "MSNBC's core audience is more Democratic than Fox's is Republican".

1304986469937934336 2020-09-13 11:33:14 +0800 <SatireWorks> A foreign (where AOC is below 18) film depicts "dancing" that's the equivalent of a risque U.S. cheerleading routine. Both scenarios are based on female coaching.  Outrage overlooks a scene in the FEMALE DIRECTED movie, where an adult male, properly rejects seduction by a female.  https://t.co/CFRIOwyDSR

1302454718745194497 2020-09-06 11:52:58 +0800 <SatireWorks> Anyone remember the (Omaha?) story about a strip joint that featured preteen and teenage girls dancing in bikinis?  While "technically" legal, officials found a way to close it down in a heartbeat, if I remember correctly.   Gay drag shows with minors seems like the same thing.

1302446136226131971 2020-09-06 11:18:51 +0800 <SatireWorks> Americans began giving away the country in the mid 1960s.  Sure there was an obscene war going on and it deserved to be ended.

1300834461764980736 2020-09-02 00:34:38 +0800 <SatireWorks> @cmclymer @NPR Quick... Name one program on NPR that openly supports the rights of men or fathers.  One of NPR's most famous on-air quotes:  "All the news we think you should hear..."
1300833232250863616 2020-09-02 00:29:45 +0800 <SatireWorks> @ByronYork You are invited to send a signed copy to SW for review. 😀
1300832290633846785 2020-09-02 00:26:01 +0800 <SatireWorks> Despite Headline: "Father of Wilkinson County 12-yr-old charged with murder." "At around 2 p.m. Thursday, the GBI arrested (Mary Kathrine "Katie") Horton who was charged with Cruelty to Children in the second degree and Murder in the second degree for the death of HER daughter."
1300828834779090944 2020-09-02 00:12:17 +0800 <SatireWorks> I hear the "EXIT" doors at the exchange all have the same sign this week: "Only Intelligent People Allowed".
1300827120684367874 2020-09-02 00:05:28 +0800 <SatireWorks> @TheQniversity Hillary used this against Bill for years.  She openly bragged that she "knew everything that went on in the White House".  Undoubtedly, that included the Oval Office, so she threatened to play victim and "out" Bill for his actions, unless he followed HER orders.

1300825382996803588 2020-09-01 23:58:34 +0800 <SatireWorks> @Nationalist_KAG @mollyday15 Voters put these idiots in office.  Citizens fail to #RECALL them when it is obvious how much harm they are doing.
1300824780673777666 2020-09-01 23:56:10 +0800 <SatireWorks> @TheQniversity @2Mynita The graphic about Hefner is a "text-book" case of what psychologists call "Shame-based control".  Tragically, this is used in many personal or family relationships.  A woman "grooms" a man to be dependent on the affection of her child.  As soon as a line is crossed, she has him!
1300822003851694081 2020-09-01 23:45:08 +0800 <SatireWorks> @USMCMIL03 @AtlOBrien Had an MGA "brick" phone in '88.  Tech people were fun back then.  They gave me the key number to dial in to listen to all the executives.  The discussions of the NFL draft (the day before) could have been valuable if Vegas was doing online back then 😏

1300807325419216909 2020-09-01 22:46:48 +0800 <SatireWorks> PREPARE for the big headlines from the BS Fake Media today.  A CNN "Urinalist" is now claiming #PresidentTrump had a stroke last November and #VPMikePence was put on standby to take over.  https://t.co/Y0uVRpPTiT
1300804864616869889 2020-09-01 22:37:02 +0800 <SatireWorks> How many times have you seen any reporter or commentator on TV or radio, point to the Obama Administration or the Democrats in general for importing 100s of 1,000s from countries with an Age of Consent as low as 10 to 13?   ZERO?  #SexualAssaultTrafficking
1300670003486826498 2020-09-01 13:41:08 +0800 <SatireWorks> The criminal behavior didn't just start a few months ago. I can remember re-posting this video perhaps 6 to 8 months ago.  It's still worth repeating.
1300668242655092737 2020-09-01 13:34:08 +0800 <SatireWorks> How cunning and corrupt is #Hillary? Think 2016.  Muslims likely gave her million$ so she would select #TimKaine as VP.  He supported Muslims for 20 yrs.  If they planned to kill her in office, she likely had a backup plan to then kill Tim so #NancyPelosi would become President!  https://t.co/ux3qtk4fpL

1300611201244815362 2020-09-01 09:47:29 +0800 <SatireWorks> Those uncoothed neighbors.  Can't he see we are on our break time.  Go chase your ball for awhile.
