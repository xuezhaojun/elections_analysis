1307795490742898690 2020-09-21 05:35:17 +0800 <jedacek> My best friend died 9 months ago and his final words were ‚ÄúFill that seat!‚Äù
1307380849374105600 2020-09-20 02:07:39 +0800 <jedacek> @KurtSchlichter @rail581 Ok Kurt. Who do you suggest we in S.C. vote for? The socialist democrat plantation negro and lose a senate seat? Get off Graham‚Äôs back. He‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. You big mouth non South Carolinians need to myodb.

Today two dem women insisted that Biden is not senile and the Democrats are not socialists. You can guess what news channels they all watch.
1307318549690580995 2020-09-19 22:00:05 +0800 <jedacek> @AmyKremer @realDonaldTrump So Amy, who do you suggest we in SC vote for‚Äîthe socialist democrat plantation negro candidate and lose the senate seat? Wish you fools would stop attacking Graham. He‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got.

1307309064129572864 2020-09-19 21:22:24 +0800 <jedacek> Fellow Americans, is it not a fascinating historical time to be alive? Our first Revolution established our beloved Republic and we are now engaged in a second Revolution to preserve her. We must prevail. Vote red.
1307287003344576515 2020-09-19 19:54:44 +0800 <jedacek> @will_OC_Ca No, since moving to South Carolina 12 years ago, I have educated myself on southern history and understand the true significance of the Confederate battle flag. It has been hijacked by racists and it‚Äôs symbolism distorted for political purposes.
