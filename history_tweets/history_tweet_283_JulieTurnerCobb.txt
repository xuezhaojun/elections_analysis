1321928781385355272 2020-10-30 05:35:56 +0800 <JulieTurnerCobb> @srkitchengarden so disappointed, I ordered 2 pairs of secateurs (one intended as a present) several weeks ago now, only one pair arrived. I contacted customer services who eventually replied after two weeks with a very lame email and no progress. Very upsetting, not impressed.
