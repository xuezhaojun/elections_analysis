1337215545461104642 2020-12-11 10:00:04 +0800 <TLCraig75> @zorrothewonder1 @catturd2 I don't know where you are, but I'm in a very red state. We have mask mandates, but many ignore them. Many still gather in large groups. If you're in a blue area, my condolences. Red states are lower in virus counts than in stricter blue states. Go figure. Like guns and Chicago🤷

Our Lord sees our heart and provides. Create your own alter at home if you like. This relationship is between you and our Savior. No one else.He wants you in this.Just you. Love on Him 💖
1337213065524342784 2020-12-11 09:50:13 +0800 <TLCraig75> @zorrothewonder1 @catturd2 Fellowship and the church aren't the same thing. You and I can have fellowship online because we are the church. The early church went house to house. They all knew each other. Small groups. Now we can communicate electronically too. Connect to the world. Spread the gospel 😊
1337210759160459264 2020-12-11 09:41:03 +0800 <TLCraig75> @Sndvls2 @catturd2 I guarantee you that if you were up for it, we could worship God together online 😊 You're going to have to find a way to "have church" in different places soon. Churches have been targeted. You've seen it. It isn't going to get better for a few years. Even if Trump is declared.

Gather anywhere possible, but not in a building that has been targeted. Face it. We're going to have to go underground soon, so start networking now.

1337206050576068610 2020-12-11 09:22:21 +0800 <TLCraig75> @snooze_cat @chiproytx If the counts are correct, why not let this play out and let Trump make a YUUUUGE fool of himself? If counts are correct, Biden will be inaugurated. You will all be vindicated and can gloat. And if election fraud has occurred, wouldn't you want to find out?
1337204302645956611 2020-12-11 09:15:24 +0800 <TLCraig75> @chiproytx So you're ok with election fraud going unpunished. Any chance someone has dirty pics of you? Maybe you own shares in certain companies? You're afraid for your family? You hate President Trump? You're a closet socialist? You're a rhino? You were broke with bills to pay?  What?

A faithless church is worse than no church.Pastors are supposed to teach about the gospel of Christ,then send them out to spread it. Christians don't even want to discuss it.

In essence, destroy the nuclear family.

Trust God with your health and life.Reject the Democrat agenda. Otherwise you're not moving forward with us, you're just walking the same path and want us to join you.

Shutting down a building shouldn't affect the true church. The people. We still have a job to do, and a shutdown can't stop us.

People are the church, and it was never intended to make a building or organization the "church". "Go out and spread the gospel" is a directive to get off our butts and get busy, not get comfortable in a pew for life. WE are the church.Get busy.

1336869430379356160 2020-12-10 11:04:44 +0800 <TLCraig75> Question for Christians who wear masks... If you trust God, why do you wear masks? Do you only trust Him with some things? Why not with your health? Or life? Or do you think He needs help from man made cloth?  Just curious. 🤷

That will come when the demoncrats bring China and the UN in to help them establish a socialist government. Then China will take over and the big, last war will start.  This election actually means little. We know POTUS won but...

Covid19 is only .004% deadly, many don't know they have it unless they test, even more only get mild symptoms, it's *very rare* for asymptomatic people to spread it, so...? What's this new virus you are warning us about?

Two powers will be operating. One is the child(ch 12), a person of law and order, the other will lead socialism.Get ready.  *Vaccine provides the chip/mark.

Look at Dr Ben Carson, world class neurosurgeon.   You want slaves, dependant on the government, not independent thinkers and workers.

Dems just can't stop judging people based on race, socioeconomic status, religion, etc. Why is that?
1331656306277691392 2020-11-26 01:49:39 +0800 <TLCraig75> I love Jesus.I can't WAIT to see Him face to face!I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid of death. There is only goodness when we go through the veil. So what else can the democrats threaten me with? Lockup? I'm a loner anyway. Pain? Been there, done that. Family?We're ALL SAVED😁  https://t.co/i1Pw5duTEr
1331654547291467776 2020-11-26 01:42:39 +0800 <TLCraig75> @LLinWood Respectfully,if I could be shown that none of the corrupt would ever be able to hold power or hurt anyone ever again,I'd be fine with not seeing them on trial.Yes, have the trial, but I don't need to see it.I won't rejoice in their suffering. Different sins,but we're all sinners.

They won't be able to touch Flynn, and he can finally start talking.  And what would prevent President Trump from exonerating Flynn once his win is confirmed?   Maybe this is just a poke in the Dem noses?
1331455814608048128 2020-11-25 12:32:58 +0800 <TLCraig75> @JoeBiden Actually, we are stronger when we can work with our enemies. Anyone can play nice with friends, but it takes wisdom and intelligence to keep peace with your enemies.   But then, I'm talking to a war monger. 😳 A war monger with dementia with his finger on the red button. 💩
1331454402918559748 2020-11-25 12:27:21 +0800 <TLCraig75> @ChuckCallesto Can one be exonerated after being pardoned? Flynn is safe with a pardon *in case*, but could President Trump then exonerate him after being confirmed winner?
1331453679115833345 2020-11-25 12:24:28 +0800 <TLCraig75> @SheepDogSociety Because they NEED us locked down to destroy the economy. Make everyone dependent on the govt asap.

1331073827724464128 2020-11-24 11:15:05 +0800 <TLCraig75> So @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden and @BarackObama paid Iran to take out Seal Team 6 because they knew that Osama bin Laden was not the man killed. Iran demanded $152Billion to keep that fact hidden. Obama ran for 2nd term on the "fact" that he got ObL. That pallet of cash was payoff.

They bail them out of jail, visit rapists in the hospital and tell them they are proud of them, they march with them, and they encourage them.  Trump is about to lower the boom on them.
1331064689422426113 2020-11-24 10:38:46 +0800 <TLCraig75> @Natebutler6 @PepeMatter Nope. Optics. The EC hadn't voted yet, among other big blocks to Biden's "win". Telling the GSA to start protocol doesn't mean he's quitting. "When they think you are weak is when you are strongest".

So under his watch, canvassers are being threatened, and their children are being doxxed. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, (fake) President Joe?  Show us how your gonna take care of ALL Americans.

1329255387435069442 2020-11-19 10:49:15 +0800 <TLCraig75> @RyanRobinsonJ First prepare by asking the Holy Spirit to guide.Teach the message Jesus taught- Unconditional love for people. Teach about separation from God.Teach absolute faith in God in all matters,not just belief.Train them to go forth. Lead by example.   I don't hear much of that anymore.
1329253365235191809 2020-11-19 10:41:13 +0800 <TLCraig75> @TrumperWavin I can't imagine what it's going to take to wake them up. They deny evidence right in front of them. Only an incredible movement of the Spirit of God could do that. Y'all we've gotta be ready to teach them! We can't just point them to the nearest church we have to BE THE CHURCH!!!

You know they'll retaliate. They want us to hit them. They are trying to push us to that point so they can round us up.They've done it to moms in parks w/ sucess

1328505040991096834 2020-11-17 09:07:38 +0800 <TLCraig75> @TrumperWavin I watched a documentary about JohnJohn a few weeks ago. In an old interview, he was asked if he still used "Jr", and he says rarely. He's his own person.

1328502845302333440 2020-11-17 08:58:55 +0800 <TLCraig75> @RepPressley Tell me how not paying a debt that one, regardless of race, signs on the dotted line to accept, has anything to do with race? If a minority buys a car or home,do they get debt forgiveness for it because of their race? If the student signed the papers,they agreed to pay said debt.

If they interrupt your daily life, that could affect your job. I'm not taking any vaccine voluntarily, regardless of who puts it out. Age gives me enough side effects. I don't need artificial ones.
1328498997795893253 2020-11-17 08:43:38 +0800 <TLCraig75> @donnydebowski @MajorPatriot Since Fauci said that masks and social distancing would still be needed after receiving the vaccine, I'm not taking it. Not voluntarily, anyway. Not that I was even going to take it to begin with.

Masks don't stop a virus, according to Fauci's study years ago.   This is about controlling the population.

1328089435490152450 2020-11-16 05:36:10 +0800 <TLCraig75> @fireman452a The difference is willingness vs force. Conservatives believe in the goodness of people to share.

1327374952362897409 2020-11-14 06:17:04 +0800 <TLCraig75> @ChuckCallesto So Cuomo bans the vaccine. The other states use it. NY death tolls continue to rise while the rest of the country declines dramatically. Would Cuomo death, or life without the possibility of parole?

1324549438191390722 2020-11-06 11:09:29 +0800 <TLCraig75> @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Because the instructions were to vote Biden/Harris, not vote for everyone on the ticket. Which brings up a good point. Count the Senate and House votes, and subtract from presidential votes. You'll know the number of fraudulent Biden votes.

1319322606319841286 2020-10-23 00:59:55 +0800 <TLCraig75> @TrumpBender @Park_Of_America It's too late to put in a new candidate. Ballots have been printed and dispersed. Votes already cast can't be recalled, voters can't vote again. Their push for mail in is going to bite them HARD. Trump will run unopposed when Biden is pulled from the race over the laptops 😂😂😂

1313285618491895809 2020-10-06 09:11:05 +0800 <TLCraig75> @Who_Lives_There @alaynatreene There's no vaccine for the cold, either. Everyone's been infected with that. Infection rate means less than you want people to think it does. MANY cv19+ said they never felt sick. Of those who did get symptoms, they were mild. It's not as deadly as you want people to think it is.

1300792834371579904 2020-09-01 21:49:13 +0800 <TLCraig75> @natisolom @thejtlewis Trump has been condemning the violence from the beginning. PedoJoe just crawled out of his basement and noticed his poll numbers plummeted because the democrats weren't speaking out.
1300792358448099330 2020-09-01 21:47:20 +0800 <TLCraig75> @Davey3482 @natisolom @SusanStJames3 @realDonaldTrump Nope. Not"underlying cause". Those with comorbidities are more likely to die, like those in Cuomo's death homes, but they were very weak to begin with. The virus just added to the load.
1300791456806899715 2020-09-01 21:43:45 +0800 <TLCraig75> @natisolom @po_maga @thejtlewis "I'm a Democrat only because I've inherited that from my family," she explains. "It's not as if I'd ever be a Republican, but I'm completely dissatisfied with both parties."  I think everyone feels the same today, regardless of race. Corruption in govt needs to be eliminated.
1300779408010162176 2020-09-01 20:55:52 +0800 <TLCraig75> @GenevieveLee19 @Nevada7Desert @saorwngtsn @kylegriffin1 Tax cuts that bring more J O B S back. The Tax cuts to your paychecks. Unlike Obamas bailouts that went straight to bank CEOs pockets, these tax cuts benefit workers. That's why the unemployment dropped to historic lows until cv19.

1300642104968990722 2020-09-01 11:50:17 +0800 <TLCraig75> Might as well have stayed in his basement and invited this little group over. Except they'd see what he's got in his basement.

1300637478341300224 2020-09-01 11:31:54 +0800 <TLCraig75> @mattklewis ...according to the speech his handlers wrote for him. He only bungled it a few times, and kept the lies below 1500.
1300636747026624514 2020-09-01 11:28:59 +0800 <TLCraig75> @natisolom @thejtlewis 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 if you think Biden wrote that, or even knows who George Floyd is, then you haven't been paying attention!! He fell asleep during a TV interview! He has dementia. He can barely speak a coherent sentence, let alone write a campaign ad.
1300635377846358016 2020-09-01 11:23:33 +0800 <TLCraig75> @purple_manatees @justin_hart Nope. Just a few of the thousands of things you would have to do without if fossil fuels weren't used anymore. Your skin, nails, and hair wouldn't get pampered anymore.
1300634858121764864 2020-09-01 11:21:29 +0800 <TLCraig75> @natisolom @thejtlewis Did you condemn the killing of the truck driver? The Trump supporter? The man who was trying to protect his business?  Video shows muzzlefire to the left of Rittenhouse, and to the right in front of him. People were shooting at him. Self defense.

The economy tanked because of the virus the O admin funded. Unwarranted violence against police by terrorists that democrats support. Give it up. You've ALL lost. AGAIN. #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica

Trump tried to send help. Trump has offers of hemp on the table for all of these cities, but the DEMOCRAT mayors refuse it.

Biden has a litany of derogatory things he's said about blacks. Kamala's family was slave owners.Democrats started the KKK, now they have Antifa. Why r u Democrat?  https://t.co/k9x6YBdpKn

1300610747026878469 2020-09-01 09:45:40 +0800 <TLCraig75> @JoeBiden POTUS wants to open the county up. DEMOCRATS were screaming that it would kill millions. Those lost jobs are on DEMOCRATS. The Dem narrative is dead. No more fear over a #SIXPERCENTVIRUS, the world has watched as DEMOCRATS let communities burn and people be murdered. You've lost.

1300589779797540866 2020-09-01 08:22:21 +0800 <TLCraig75> @JoeBiden The simple truth is that democrats want power so bad that they are willing to destroy the country they want to control. They encourage and enable domestic terrorism,and only mentioned the violence because of poll numbers. We see you. GOD WINS #Trump2020Landslide  #PedoJoeHasToGo
1300586680412504073 2020-09-01 08:10:02 +0800 <TLCraig75> Never forget. She said the violence should NOT let up, and is directing people to bail the terrorists out of jail. She is NOT FIT to serve this country in ANY capacity. #LawandOrder  https://t.co/8TrBBjyCRd
