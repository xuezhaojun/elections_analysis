My job is to move information from one file to another, and upload everything, so I have multiple apps open all the time PLUS my email. The extra monitor makes everything easy to see all the time.

1305915693154668551 2020-09-16 01:05:38 +0800 <ornwen> What gets me is that Drumpf’s followers will just accept this as fact:
