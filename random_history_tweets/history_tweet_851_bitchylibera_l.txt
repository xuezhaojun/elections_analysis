1301630330210856963 2020-09-04 05:17:08 +0800 <bitchylibera_l> @DeAnna4Congress I do not agree. Nancy Pelosi got her hair done and Donald Trump continues to undermine the election, he has not stopped Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and he has withheld PPE from healthcare workers who really need it. Who‚Äôs the real bad guy here?

The withheld PPE for healthcare workers, causing hundreds of thousands more coronavirus deaths than necessary, they let Putin put bounties on soldier‚Äôs heads, and our economy is tanking under them.
