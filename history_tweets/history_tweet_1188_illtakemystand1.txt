1344015659022376968 2020-12-30 04:21:18 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @wil_da_beast630 When you have a society based on rule of law (as we do), the principle of equal treatment should flow through as many areas of culture as possible - lest it be deemed illegitimate. That means *what* one says or does should matter, not *who* says or does them.
1343930316168310785 2020-12-29 22:42:11 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @JohnHMcWhorter @wil_da_beast630 Have a working definition of “problematic”? It seems be wokespeak for “bad” but without the speaker believing that further intellectual justification is required.
1343892999114285058 2020-12-29 20:13:53 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @wil_da_beast630 (2/2) A statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the ... races - a distinction founded in the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color - has no tendency to destroy the[ir] legal equality
1343892544086810625 2020-12-29 20:12:05 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @wil_da_beast630 (1/2) The New Segregationists think that one’s subjective intent is what matters when you separate blacks from whites, etc. Apparently the following quote from from the classic Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) has withstood the test of time:
1343870488997720064 2020-12-29 18:44:27 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @2ndBolivian @EngageReaders This term needs to spread like wildfire. Just saying it is like an incantation to ward off the Twitter mob: “wokeaboo bullshittery”
1343869619908567043 2020-12-29 18:40:59 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @EngageReaders The tendency in education to apply presentism to the values of the author turns works of art into just another object to socially deconstruct American culture. You underestimate the ability of students to separate art from activist politics and thus sacrifice the former.
1343317929446748161 2020-12-28 06:08:46 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @EPoe187 @RichardHanania This is why I post nothing online under my real name. As a professional who owns a small business it’s too risky to chance the your family’s future on a tweet.

1343030197260603393 2020-12-27 11:05:25 +0800 <illtakemystand1> A vital issue the right needs to advocate more is using antitrust laws to break up consolidationalist capitalists like @amazon and @Facebook. Capital, like govtl power, concentrates when unchecked, and at some point must be balanced against community interests.

1337077192140976128 2020-12-11 00:50:18 +0800 <illtakemystand1> @EPoe187 Correction: All men who were part of the then-existing political community were created equal. They vast majority of the Founders meant nothing more than that. The problem was that their rights “as Englishmen” (ie, as part of that political community) were being trod upon.

Have any of these revolutionaries wondered what will happen to all of them when the generation two years from now takes over? The Revolution will indeed consume its own. #culturalrevolution
