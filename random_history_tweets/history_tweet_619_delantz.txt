1341816805887598593 2020-12-24 02:43:50 +0800 <delantz> Majority of white voters voted for Trump. Not because of his integrity, intelligence, or conservatism. He is a racist &amp; xenophobe. Majority of white voters want to maintain power that can only be wrench from their cold dead hands. A dysphemism people...
1341813156373413888 2020-12-24 02:29:20 +0800 <delantz> Your still a felon to anyone with integrity. This doesn't change the fact that you admitted lying to the FBI. Don't worry, your family and friends probably don't fall into the category of people with integrity.

I have NEVER voted Republican. Need education about systemic racism and unconscious bias for hope. We need the non-whites to way outnumber whites to win elections.

1327407809156169728 2020-11-14 08:27:38 +0800 <delantz> @robreiner As well he should.
1327407510278455296 2020-11-14 08:26:27 +0800 <delantz> @MuellerSheWrote Yep! Except he won't be president and so he won't be doing anything related to the vaccine.
1327407122607267842 2020-11-14 08:24:54 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 Yep!
1327397597628178437 2020-11-14 07:47:03 +0800 <delantz> @MarthaMcSally Pretty amazing thing for a dishonorable person to say

1327396408509427712 2020-11-14 07:42:20 +0800 <delantz> If you don't like it, WEAR A GODDAMN MASK! Get your back-assed cronies to do the same.

1327377784134504448 2020-11-14 06:28:19 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets This is just heartbreaking. Not! Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out!

1327074209105731584 2020-11-13 10:22:01 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets She has no compassion, integrity or grace. She is in alignment with Trump. She is a Birther white supremist. As her jacket said on her trip to the border, "I really don't care, do you?

1326006351516950528 2020-11-10 11:38:44 +0800 <delantz> Pfizer has nothing to do with Warp Speed. Pfizer took no money from the government.
1326003271341727744 2020-11-10 11:26:30 +0800 <delantz> @LizForTX8 I think they are complicit and culpable in the present shitshow.

1325945702208319490 2020-11-10 07:37:44 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets Only question was, how much did it cost them for that lie?

1325847596909252608 2020-11-10 01:07:54 +0800 <delantz> @freddyatton Good God man! All the male journalists in the media and you are putting this on one women? There is a word for this that begins with M and Trump was one of those too.
1325710075843936256 2020-11-09 16:01:27 +0800 <delantz> @Manny_Funes Works for me.

1325602081680486403 2020-11-09 08:52:19 +0800 <delantz> @AshaRangappa_ Aawww. Too bad. They supported a white supremist, self admitted sexual assaulter, misogynist, xenophobe. What is there to like? Maybe it is just soon?
1325600528831709184 2020-11-09 08:46:09 +0800 <delantz> I would love to hear that.

1325534666879741952 2020-11-09 04:24:26 +0800 <delantz> @mitchellreports Too little too late. If he had endorsed them before the election that would be worthy of a tweet. He called...who cares. No big deal.
1325533199083008000 2020-11-09 04:18:36 +0800 <delantz> @NaveedAJamali @ProjectLincoln Indeed!

1325529020063051776 2020-11-09 04:02:00 +0800 <delantz> @ReportsDaNews It only matters if he endorsed him before the election. No big deal here.

1325469411461922822 2020-11-09 00:05:08 +0800 <delantz> Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief. One of the best if them all. Sorry for the shade on the other Chief Liars, Sean Spicer, Anthony Scarramucci, Sarah Sanders. @SarahSanders9 @Scaramucci @seanspicer
1325467872492019712 2020-11-08 23:59:01 +0800 <delantz> If you want the truth, start by telling it. Nothing you have said about Trump is true. Your false statements attest to your delusional state. I am more inclined to think that you are, indeed, just like him a Liar.

1324530323623825408 2020-11-06 09:53:32 +0800 <delantz> @ReportsDaNews I can't see there us reason to celebrate when half the voters wanted a continuation of Trump and his anti-democracy, racism, xenographic, mysogynistic, anti-immigrant, and pro-rapist regime.
1324528102177792000 2020-11-06 09:44:42 +0800 <delantz> @rosyishjess @rickshodan We are doomed
1324526794192531456 2020-11-06 09:39:30 +0800 <delantz> @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump Yes, but they don't give a shit.
1324526403304394752 2020-11-06 09:37:57 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC JMJ! So true.
1324525399682899968 2020-11-06 09:33:58 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub @blaireerskine Don't go. We need reason and knowledge of the law, maybe now more than ever
1324493109644832769 2020-11-06 07:25:39 +0800 <delantz> @ybarrap Trump's campaign manager. Almost the majority of voters wanted Trump and his criminal cronies to remain in power. Dear world, please pray for America. Even if Trump loses in the not sure we will overcome the power of evil.
1324492323061821440 2020-11-06 07:22:32 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC Thank you
1324491944882417664 2020-11-06 07:21:02 +0800 <delantz> @JoyAnnReid Of course he does.
1324488832117469184 2020-11-06 07:08:40 +0800 <delantz> @jilevin With his dementia full blown. So sad to say it would still be close.
1324488543041802240 2020-11-06 07:07:31 +0800 <delantz> @DrJasonJohnson One can only hope she runs far, far, far, away.
1324487940072853504 2020-11-06 07:05:07 +0800 <delantz> @jelani9 Yes it is disgusting and terrifying. At least we can't deny, any more, that 40%+ Americans hard straight up racists. The rest of white people are trying to understand, at long last, what is privilege, systemic racism, and unconscious bias. The alternative gives no hope.
1324486658700402688 2020-11-06 07:00:01 +0800 <delantz> @Sigmundine2 Again!
1324443126933512192 2020-11-06 04:07:03 +0800 <delantz> @neal_katyal It is only good if you are pro-democracy.
1324441847112949761 2020-11-06 04:01:57 +0800 <delantz> @rak_strong Close the bloody borders. He is expected in court.
1324421150873546753 2020-11-06 02:39:43 +0800 <delantz> @donwinslow Unfortunately, almost half of us are deplorable racists like Trump. That is the point. Time to face reality. Our vision of ourselves is massively distorted.
1324420242211155970 2020-11-06 02:36:06 +0800 <delantz> @GeigerNews Is it even possible? I think there is a genetic flaw in 40% of the population. I am not seeing hope. I'm disgusted.

1324172918331379716 2020-11-05 10:13:20 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC What's up with you @mitchellreports?
1324172623958269952 2020-11-05 10:12:10 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Positively and absolutely. Almost half of the electorate are straight up racists. These people are NOT voting against their own self interest. They are voting according to their bias.
1324171067661824000 2020-11-05 10:05:59 +0800 <delantz> @Sigmundine2 Not all white women voted for him. None of my family or friends voted GOP. It is inexplicable to me. Thank God for black women and other women of color have saved our asses.
1324168019556265985 2020-11-05 09:53:52 +0800 <delantz> @a_fly_guy_no Sadly, they won't let Americans in at the moment... Since April. The border is closed.
1324166993323282434 2020-11-05 09:49:47 +0800 <delantz> @jelani9 No shit!
1324165980386332672 2020-11-05 09:45:46 +0800 <delantz> @jemelehill Exactly!
1324163896710623233 2020-11-05 09:37:29 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC Hear! Hear!
1324162629837860865 2020-11-05 09:32:27 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Too late. He stripped it of all decency.
1324162340250529792 2020-11-05 09:31:18 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 That is the question. There at 66 million indecent people that have voted for against decency.
1324161879174868993 2020-11-05 09:29:28 +0800 <delantz> @StevenBeschloss So, so very disturbing. I read an interview of a Democrat that voted for Trump in 2016 and said he was voting again for Trump because he like what Trump has done. No words.
1323730270827147264 2020-11-04 04:54:24 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC You are so polite!?
1323719296401338369 2020-11-04 04:10:48 +0800 <delantz> @thehill Remember, she is the present Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief.
1323718817948684288 2020-11-04 04:08:54 +0800 <delantz> @a_fly_guy_no @AnandWrites Thank you, Lars. Unfortunately, about 40% of Americans are racists bullies. Sadly, that is what the election of Trump has taught us. That is the devasting truth with which we must live.
1323717248826011648 2020-11-04 04:02:40 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 Yes, exactly that.

1323712658323877888 2020-11-04 03:44:25 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Really?
1323698929775489024 2020-11-04 02:49:52 +0800 <delantz> Just reasd a Democrat interviewed post voting 5oday in PA. He said he was voting for Trump again, as in 2016, because he likes what Trump has done. Maybe everyone shouldn't have a right vote. We need a test for critical thinking. And a lot more education on systemic racism.
1323697913663377409 2020-11-04 02:45:50 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill That it is.
1323695354638815234 2020-11-04 02:35:40 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill Thank you for the clarification. I'm very short on Yiddish.
1323682452783521797 2020-11-04 01:44:24 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill For those of us that don't know Yiddish: To be a shanda for the goyim is to confirm the most hurtful stereotypes,thereby doing damage twice: a Jew who dishonors Jews by doing something bad that confirms the worst fears of others about Jews in general
1323672545174806529 2020-11-04 01:05:02 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC Yeah!
1323671717437337601 2020-11-04 01:01:44 +0800 <delantz> @Sigmundine2 When has logic been a consideration with Trump? Why don't we see him as he is? Naked and afraid. Now that is logical.
1323658297795252224 2020-11-04 00:08:25 +0800 <delantz> @Tazerface16 @tromboneguywpg AMEN!
1323655436571086850 2020-11-03 23:57:03 +0800 <delantz> @tribelaw And you all thought he was stupid.
1323654823640662016 2020-11-03 23:54:36 +0800 <delantz> Well, maybe he is not as stupid as I thought. Imagine that, everyone gets a vote in the Democrat's America. It's the Republicans that only want their supporters to vote.
1323653675990970368 2020-11-03 23:50:03 +0800 <delantz> Thank you.

1323456124826210307 2020-11-03 10:45:03 +0800 <delantz> How conveniently timed. As in it is about bloody time. Dr Birx as been too little too late from the get. I hope Biden fires her.
1323455778695471104 2020-11-03 10:43:40 +0800 <delantz> @SRuhle And Mexico did not pay. The American people paid for the wall.

1323004323115069441 2020-11-02 04:49:45 +0800 <delantz> @MSNBC Get Ted Cruz the "efff" off the air. Out right lies flowing from his mouth impunity. To push back. The MSM is complicit and culpable, from the campaign in 2016 to the present re-election, in the present shitshow via the GOP.

1317550890060926976 2020-10-18 03:39:45 +0800 <delantz> I would say you are not a progressive you are a racist.
1317550515924869120 2020-10-18 03:38:16 +0800 <delantz> Thanks to Trump, the on European country open to them is Russia. Perfect.

1317548606031736833 2020-10-18 03:30:41 +0800 <delantz> He is a coward just like his colleagues.
1317548436653133824 2020-10-18 03:30:00 +0800 <delantz> @Amy_Siskind @freddyatton Who cares? She was not solid like Fauci. She did a little bit too much of the talk out of both sides of her mouth.

1317510166829387777 2020-10-18 00:57:56 +0800 <delantz> @NBCNews Blood on their hands. Sasse is not a good guy. He is still a coward like the rest of them. Blood on all their hands.
1317509536505212928 2020-10-18 00:55:26 +0800 <delantz> SDNY can be on this so he does not escape.
1317509257902710784 2020-10-18 00:54:19 +0800 <delantz> SDNY needs to nail him before he gets away. No excuses!

1317487918391283720 2020-10-17 23:29:32 +0800 <delantz> So why isn't this being anticipated by SDNY and him taken into custody immediately on January 20th?

1314344864423657472 2020-10-09 07:20:09 +0800 <delantz> @JonLemire It's the COVID-19.

1314331836701523969 2020-10-09 06:28:23 +0800 <delantz> @DearAuntCrabby @MaryanneChisho2 Evidently his goal is to kill as many of us as possible. Seems like killing his base seems contrary to his interests.

1314277546473582592 2020-10-09 02:52:39 +0800 <delantz> This is s sign the President is not mentally capable of reasoned thought. He doesn't think Joe Biden should run against him. He wants to cancel the election, and he may not abide by the results of election. Hitler's mini-me. shou https://www.msnbc.com/maddowblog

1314240729477079041 2020-10-09 00:26:21 +0800 <delantz> @KellyO Good.
1314240336269512705 2020-10-09 00:24:48 +0800 <delantz> @matthewjdowd It is, unfortunately, expected that especially older are misogynist. The real rub is when women are misogynist. @SusanPage did not give Senator Kamala Harris her equal time and was obsequious to Pence.
1314231313436561409 2020-10-08 23:48:57 +0800 <delantz> @JohnBerman @TiffanyDCross @realDonaldTrump I'm relieved.

1314230933801717761 2020-10-08 23:47:26 +0800 <delantz> @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Aaawww, too bad soo sad. The big fat whiny baby-man is going to take his blocks and go home. The American people were not intelligibly enlighted by the last debate. It was excruciating to watch and exposed so many to the virus. All debates during the pandemic should be virtual.
1314230810258493441 2020-10-08 23:46:57 +0800 <delantz> The Main Stream Media gives Trump free airtime daily.
1314230605354164225 2020-10-08 23:46:08 +0800 <delantz> @blackwomenviews Does she deserve ANY recognition? I think NO.

1314229394387345408 2020-10-08 23:41:19 +0800 <delantz> @StevenBeschloss Odds are he is COVID-19 positive. I have no expectation of transparency.
1314228999078305792 2020-10-08 23:39:45 +0800 <delantz> @bryanbehar I think it was that she would have won the debate had she NOT been a black women. Maybe just bring a women is the disqualifying factor. Just saying.
1314228202445828097 2020-10-08 23:36:35 +0800 <delantz> Just like the Trump plan only louder..... Except for the balls part.
1314226985091039233 2020-10-08 23:31:45 +0800 <delantz> @Acosta There are psychotropic drugs that might be helpful.
1314226679351398400 2020-10-08 23:30:32 +0800 <delantz> @DavidJHouck There is an idea. Wrapped up in a jacket of some kind... Like really wrapped up.
1314225826657792000 2020-10-08 23:27:08 +0800 <delantz> @StevenBeschloss He's done so well NOT protecting Americans from COVID-19 due to his negligence. It is not a familiar concept.
1314217625988157440 2020-10-08 22:54:33 +0800 <delantz> @rak_strong Yes, and you sir, are a mean old racist. Calm down. It will all be over soon. The Sargent-at-Arms of the Senate will protect you from the nasty women, especially the women of color.

1314216070627028993 2020-10-08 22:48:22 +0800 <delantz> @Joyfulvink94 Evil, as in a better liar than Trump. He lies so calmly all wrapped up in self-righteous pompous bigotry.
1314215106796945409 2020-10-08 22:44:33 +0800 <delantz> @jilevin Good. What a relief. Nobody wants to watch another shit show.

1314213384309465088 2020-10-08 22:37:42 +0800 <delantz> @MaryanneChisho2 Well, there is an alleged rapist, self-admitted sexual harrasser in the WH. Takes one to know one I guess. His type of scare tactics usually work with 2-yr olds, oh, and his base.
1314212246084481024 2020-10-08 22:33:11 +0800 <delantz> @mmpadellan Sounds like a good decision to me.

1314185892433592322 2020-10-08 20:48:27 +0800 <delantz> The question is how many will he expose before he does.

1314115019282345984 2020-10-08 16:06:50 +0800 <delantz> Yes, the religious piety, he has that over Trump. Trump just lies with impunity. I think Pence is creepier and evil.

1314109659448393729 2020-10-08 15:45:32 +0800 <delantz> No more in person debates. Remote only.
1314104322066530304 2020-10-08 15:24:19 +0800 <delantz> She was obsequious to Pence and did it keep him to the rules. He lied and she never called him on anything letting keep talking and not giving Kamala equal time. We expect this shit from men, when women do it is pretty maddening.
1314103210299121664 2020-10-08 15:19:54 +0800 <delantz> The entire townhall should be remote.
1314102753480720384 2020-10-08 15:18:05 +0800 <delantz> To Senator Kamala Harris and millions of women watching Pence was very offensive.

1314076328698675200 2020-10-08 13:33:05 +0800 <delantz> @CallieKhouri @bryanbehar She is a reason but not the main reason. Trump, through his criminal negligence, who is responsible for 1000s of needless deaths because he did not implement a national plan and in force the Defense Act to manufacture all the PPE, supplies, and Travlcing &amp; Tracking.
1314071911106703360 2020-10-08 13:15:32 +0800 <delantz> Pence asked the question. She shouldn't have even tried to answer it. WTH is McConnell doing these last 4 years and what did he do in 2016 with Garland nomination. Seriously Andrea, what do you mean? Next you are going to go at Hilliary Clinton. Get some rest.

1314070262384521217 2020-10-08 13:08:59 +0800 <delantz> @JillWineBanks And @SusanPage is responsible. She was obsequious to Pence.
1314069861287387137 2020-10-08 13:07:23 +0800 <delantz> @neal_katyal @KamalaHarris Certainly not a success for Susan Page. She obsequious with smarmy Pence. She did not hold him to the rules. He drowned on after his time and interrupted. Misogyny from men is tough to take. Really hard coming from another women. Kamala carried the weight of history abley.
1314067886386769922 2020-10-08 12:59:32 +0800 <delantz> She totally failed. She was not even in her treatment of the candidates. She obsequious with smarmy Pence. Made my skin crawl. @SusanPage @KamalaHarris

1314029151385346053 2020-10-08 10:25:37 +0800 <delantz> Exactly! Why is she risking her health with I person debate to start. Democrats need to grow some and insist on remote debates. And WTH, Susan Page? Can't they find a Democrat to moderate one debate. And no misogynist, make or female. Nothing we can do about Pence on that score.
1314028075995205635 2020-10-08 10:21:21 +0800 <delantz> @MalcolmNance Or he has COVID-19.

You cut Kamala off and she stopped. He even harassed her. Really difficult to see misogyny perpetuated by a women. Turn in your women card.
1314025794016960512 2020-10-08 10:12:17 +0800 <delantz> @FriendEden100 JMJ! He is responsible, due to his negligence for 1000s of needless deaths and you are worried about him setting an example on mask wearing. People can wear masks if the want to live or not. He is killing people because he did not initiate a national pandemic response &amp; PPE
1314024686389321728 2020-10-08 10:07:53 +0800 <delantz> Big mistake, Ari. He lied like a rug continuously and you did not call him on it. If is a quandary why hosts have Trump surrogates on their shows. Since few hosts call them on their lies it is so very upsetting for your usual viewers. Do not think people don't notice, they do.

Also, continued incarcaration of infants, children, and adults with inhumane treatment at the border.
1310262889584844800 2020-09-28 00:59:51 +0800 <delantz> America is and has been a third world country for a long time.

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie. That's what Trump supporters in government do because the truth will is criminal. You lied about his crimes.

1309863291573821440 2020-09-26 22:31:59 +0800 <delantz> @tribelaw And that is also a lie.
1309712006006546432 2020-09-26 12:30:50 +0800 <delantz> This tells the entire story.
1309711786443042816 2020-09-26 12:29:57 +0800 <delantz> @K_JeanPierre Black people deserve better as all people of color deserves better. All Americans deserve better than Trump. Unfortunately, white people people elected him and will re-elect him if they can. Racism is a clear and present danger.

For me I will vote and work to get others to vote. That is all I've got as the hope for change to equal justice and everything that ALL Americans deserve.

1308924453288439808 2020-09-24 08:21:22 +0800 <delantz> And he said get rid of the ballots and there won't be a transition. Putin's playbook, I guess. President as long as he chooses. Is this called a coup?
1308855345092194305 2020-09-24 03:46:46 +0800 <delantz> @jelani9 Yeah! America is racist to it's core.

1308773523788197894 2020-09-23 22:21:38 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 Time to remember that 50‰ of the population has an IQ under 100. Now we know who they are.
1308750391228522497 2020-09-23 20:49:43 +0800 <delantz> @MollyJongFast WTF? Are you on drugs too? Now Democrats are anti-Catholic? You just rattle away like what you say makes sense and people give a shit.
1308749233239937025 2020-09-23 20:45:07 +0800 <delantz> There is no rational explanation for the American people's reasoning on national health care. My only explanation is there is a genetic flaw rampant in our population. Health care is not the only national issue that we get wrong but it probably is the one with the biggest impact.

Yes, the majority of white men are voting for Trump. That says everything we need to know about the majority of white men. Leave women out of it, Mr. Misogynist.

1302906828385185793 2020-09-07 17:49:29 +0800 <delantz> @AmySab1 He purports to be pro-life. In spite of the abortions for which he has paid.
1302811113810096130 2020-09-07 11:29:09 +0800 <delantz> Or Anthony Scarramucci. He was also great at that job, lying faster and louder than all the rest. Now he is all over Twitter, all squeaky clean, like he never was the Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief.
1302762554679123968 2020-09-07 08:16:11 +0800 <delantz> Their integrity and credibility was lost when they agreed to work for this POSPOTUS. Their silence is confirmation.

1302565232720539650 2020-09-06 19:12:06 +0800 <delantz> @jentaub And she is a lying "christian". In fact, she was one of the Chief Liars for the Liar-In-Chief. Dispicable human.
1302562857754619904 2020-09-06 19:02:40 +0800 <delantz> Their integrity and credibility was lost when they agreed to work for this POSPOTUS. Their silence is confirmation.
1302560421749030912 2020-09-06 18:52:59 +0800 <delantz> @StevenBeschloss Yes, they did. And millions will again.
1302560177908928512 2020-09-06 18:52:01 +0800 <delantz> @JoyAnnReid Yes! GOP is NO CHOICE. That's it.
1302559043802677248 2020-09-06 18:47:31 +0800 <delantz> He no longer has to hide it in plain site.
1302557592057597952 2020-09-06 18:41:44 +0800 <delantz> @Scaramucci Yeah, sort of like I look down on people that worked for this POSPOTUS. People that aspired to and became the Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief, like you, Anthony Scarramucci?
1302556368163844098 2020-09-06 18:36:53 +0800 <delantz> Not my head. I didn't vote for the sucker. His head and his supporters heads.

1302555723327447046 2020-09-06 18:34:19 +0800 <delantz> He no longer has to pretend. He has desensitized thd masses enough that now he gets to be racist all the time in the daylight.
1302555161106112517 2020-09-06 18:32:05 +0800 <delantz> Their credibility and integrity were lost the minute they agreed to work for the Russian asset in the WH. Their silence is confirmation.
1302553772963422210 2020-09-06 18:26:34 +0800 <delantz> @B52Malmet The sound of silence....

1302336518460067843 2020-09-06 04:03:16 +0800 <delantz> And, my God, he is reproducing.
1302334930454638592 2020-09-06 03:56:58 +0800 <delantz> He has been carrying Trump's water from the get. He does not honor his rank or the organization that awarded him that rank.
1302329251593515008 2020-09-06 03:34:24 +0800 <delantz> How do you spell hubris? IGNORANCE.  https://t.co/WasF50ld4i
1302320135626092550 2020-09-06 02:58:10 +0800 <delantz> Racism rules in Trump's world. Fine christian women. God is so proud.
1302318039950454785 2020-09-06 02:49:51 +0800 <delantz> @Lawrence Don't hlld your breath. He has carried Trump's water, FAITHFULLY.
1302317221104893952 2020-09-06 02:46:36 +0800 <delantz> @JoyVBehar Mary Trump's father did, I believe.

1302289980895633409 2020-09-06 00:58:21 +0800 <delantz> You both carried water for Trump. He has NOT spoken out in support of the military. You gave up your integrity and credibility when your were Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief.
1302286177009983489 2020-09-06 00:43:14 +0800 <delantz> @TiffanyDCross Frau Trump is just like her husband, a Birther ad a Liar.
1302285516155400198 2020-09-06 00:40:37 +0800 <delantz> AKA Frau Trump, the Birther Queen.
1302283314368114689 2020-09-06 00:31:52 +0800 <delantz> @tokitaeII Because he doesn't.
1302283166376288258 2020-09-06 00:31:16 +0800 <delantz> @Manny_Funes @realDonaldTrump His supporters already knew that and they don't care
1302263405256957955 2020-09-05 23:12:45 +0800 <delantz> His daddy was a draft dodger and a bigot, too.
1302263121927577600 2020-09-05 23:11:37 +0800 <delantz> Frau Trump, the Birther Queen clearly did not write this piece.
1302260867447185415 2020-09-05 23:02:40 +0800 <delantz> He is the man.

1302258839987712002 2020-09-05 22:54:36 +0800 <delantz> I can't answer that question, but I would suggest, this is what a racist would.
1302256349938479109 2020-09-05 22:44:43 +0800 <delantz> Clearly, this was not written by Frau Trump, the Birther Queen.
1302255342240165888 2020-09-05 22:40:42 +0800 <delantz> Frau Trump, the Birther Queen. She is definitely not Trump"s first lady.

1301993286362476544 2020-09-05 05:19:23 +0800 <delantz> @lonestarmoocher Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case case
1301882874606444545 2020-09-04 22:00:39 +0800 <delantz> Stupid question. The 40% are worthy of much scorn lacking completely in socially redeeming value.
1301881809450401794 2020-09-04 21:56:25 +0800 <delantz> @AdamParkhomenko I don't think they necessarily believe him. They share his ideals like racism or they just don't care what he does or says. The more offensive the better.
1301789801654280192 2020-09-04 15:50:49 +0800 <delantz> @MalcolmNance Liar for the Liar-In-Chief.
1301781687190171648 2020-09-04 15:18:34 +0800 <delantz> At yet he reigns.
1301778704515780609 2020-09-04 15:06:43 +0800 <delantz> And you were the Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief. I revile you and all that have done that job. You are all complicit and culpable. Your shit still stinks.
1301777676751962114 2020-09-04 15:02:38 +0800 <delantz> @RadioFreeTom There is tape.

1301772870012395521 2020-09-04 14:43:32 +0800 <delantz> Those words were felonious. Barr does not have "immunity" so why hasn't he been arrested?

1301765477979451392 2020-09-04 14:14:10 +0800 <delantz> That will never do.
1301764389930897409 2020-09-04 14:09:50 +0800 <delantz> He is culpable and complicit.
1301760349872422912 2020-09-04 13:53:47 +0800 <delantz> @kimhurdman @davidfrum Racists or morons, mostly both.
1301757321660436483 2020-09-04 13:41:45 +0800 <delantz> He's on tape.
1301756794105032704 2020-09-04 13:39:39 +0800 <delantz> The Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief. Just like Sean Spicer, Scarramucci, &amp; the current one. They are complicit &amp;  culpable. Scarramucci has the nerve to have resurfaced on Twitter &amp; @msnbc @JoyAnnReid like his shit doesn't stink. For 10 days yelled louder &amp; faster then the rest.
1301694722331652096 2020-09-04 09:33:00 +0800 <delantz> @thejollycrank No
1301659428282748929 2020-09-04 07:12:46 +0800 <delantz> So did Bill Barr. Why hasn't he been arrested?
1301658676751527936 2020-09-04 07:09:46 +0800 <delantz> The media seems to be have forgotten this and only mention shot of paintball shooters. Oops.  https://t.co/ErCdhphyAA
1301658161011589125 2020-09-04 07:07:43 +0800 <delantz> One protester was shot with a long rifle dead. Why not say so instead mention paintball shooters
1301657201384198145 2020-09-04 07:03:55 +0800 <delantz> @nikadubrovsky @davidgraeber I'm so sorry for your losses. 🙏💔💐

1301540885503516672 2020-09-03 23:21:43 +0800 <delantz> Trump he will de fund Medicare and Social Security and people over 65 yrs need to hear that loud and clear.
1301439372932210688 2020-09-03 16:38:20 +0800 <delantz> Washington State has voted by mail for 20 years. This is all BS.
1301438008529281024 2020-09-03 16:32:55 +0800 <delantz> Trump voters in jail for voter fraud? Don't tease the me.
1301437382693023745 2020-09-03 16:30:26 +0800 <delantz> And eliminating Social Security Medicare, and Medicare. Wake up America. Instead going on and on about soup cans the media cover this. @maddow @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @TheBeatWithAri
1301436168895041537 2020-09-03 16:25:36 +0800 <delantz> @matthewjdowd @kimhurdman This flies right over my head.

1301371121992740864 2020-09-03 12:07:08 +0800 <delantz> @BarbMcQuade He is political hack that committed a felony today urging Trump voters to commit voter fraud by urging them to vote twice, a felony.

1301368285607337984 2020-09-03 11:55:52 +0800 <delantz> He also broke the law when suggested Trump supporter to commit a felony by voting twice. Indict and arrest him. That will keep him busy well passed the election.
1301335319862636544 2020-09-03 09:44:52 +0800 <delantz> Great if all Trump voters go to jail and are felons.
1301333788513849344 2020-09-03 09:38:47 +0800 <delantz> And bears don't necessarily shit in the woods.
1301333075087880193 2020-09-03 09:35:57 +0800 <delantz> Bill Barr committed that felony as well. Arrest him.
1301332738985738240 2020-09-03 09:34:37 +0800 <delantz> Bill Barr suggested the people should vote twice, once by mail and once in person. That is a felony and he can be indicted. He has committed a felony. Who has cajones to do their job.
1301332161908232197 2020-09-03 09:32:19 +0800 <delantz> @maddow @JoyAnnReid @msnbc I hope all the Trump voters vote twice. They will all go to jail for the felony.
1301328394148147200 2020-09-03 09:17:21 +0800 <delantz> Encouraging voter fraud. They will do anything to re-elect Trump
1301328009605992448 2020-09-03 09:15:49 +0800 <delantz> Stunningly beautiful.
1301327234171465728 2020-09-03 09:12:44 +0800 <delantz> When the US courts finishes with Trump I hope the World Court will take over

1301324279183597568 2020-09-03 09:01:00 +0800 <delantz> @Theresaroets729 Here, here.
1301324128553586688 2020-09-03 09:00:24 +0800 <delantz> How will we ever trust the CDC?
1301303182883090433 2020-09-03 07:37:10 +0800 <delantz> How will we ever trust the CDC, DOJ, CIA, HLS, and FBI again?
1301302623757242368 2020-09-03 07:34:57 +0800 <delantz> @HunterJCullen Or morons.
1301302508963291137 2020-09-03 07:34:29 +0800 <delantz> More lives lost to aid in his re-election. Mostly costly election campaign ever.
1301201148783800323 2020-09-03 00:51:43 +0800 <delantz> @TinaDuryea Seriously?
1301151297115049985 2020-09-02 21:33:38 +0800 <delantz> There's a pre-nup.
1301144182120001536 2020-09-02 21:05:21 +0800 <delantz> Of course he did.
1301139022157238272 2020-09-02 20:44:51 +0800 <delantz> Why should he? You didn't save yourself from the humiliation of being the Chief Liar for the Liar-In-Chief? You have no shame.
1301137355588288512 2020-09-02 20:38:14 +0800 <delantz> @RobinFulghum1 I'm sorry❤🙏💐

1300913588618420224 2020-09-02 05:49:03 +0800 <delantz> One of those just flew to Kenosha.
1300913365351501824 2020-09-02 05:48:10 +0800 <delantz> This is terrifying. Democracy has died when we are exercising our 1st Ammendment right and get murdered by a Republican and 80% of Republicans agree. Murdered, as in shot dead, in the streets
1300898554400051200 2020-09-02 04:49:19 +0800 <delantz> @MalcolmNance @maddow @JoyAnnReid
1300897872309747714 2020-09-02 04:46:36 +0800 <delantz> Wake up, white people. These were white on white murders with Trump, and 80% of the Republicans in Kenosha supporting it. So, anyone that opposes Trump can be shot dead with Trumps and a majority if Republicans blessings. The dictator will maintain power by killing his opponents.

1300892389620379648 2020-09-02 04:24:49 +0800 <delantz> @Mocraig13 No shit!
1300868644004536320 2020-09-02 02:50:28 +0800 <delantz> @Yamiche No doubt. He he justifying murder. The victims were white men, to my knowledge. Wake up white Americans. If there is only safety or justice for some, there is no safety or justice for anyone. Smell the bloody coffee.
1300867297842667522 2020-09-02 02:45:07 +0800 <delantz> Please, lock him up? He is delusional, or a devious, evil liar. If adults believe this BS, they are beyond repair. That is exceedingly sad as terrifying.
1300861782341201922 2020-09-02 02:23:12 +0800 <delantz> @bryanbehar He is delusional or a good story teller.
1300861431957450752 2020-09-02 02:21:48 +0800 <delantz> @freddyatton The Lying B*tches. Did I say that? Yep!
