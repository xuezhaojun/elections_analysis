1342167117697843200 2020-12-25 01:55:51 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  the actions of swamp creatures.
1342164733236023296 2020-12-25 01:46:23 +0800 <braschen1> What about old Al Sharpton he has not paid his taxes and the world knows about that, why is he above the the Law Ari? @AriFleischer

1342085361489608705 2020-12-24 20:30:59 +0800 <braschen1> @SpeakerPelosi Nancy, what about all the crap you have hidden in that bill? The people do not want 5000 page bill, that is devious and borders on criminal.
1342081915805966339 2020-12-24 20:17:18 +0800 <braschen1> Ted Cruz is a good man, I think he is trust worthy.
1341890766352904195 2020-12-24 07:37:44 +0800 <braschen1> The House of Representatives gets $480 per week, how's that sound to you.
1341889563980165121 2020-12-24 07:32:57 +0800 <braschen1> They should they have seen the evidence,  even before that it was common knowledge that there was massive election fraud.
1341889111653801984 2020-12-24 07:31:09 +0800 <braschen1> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Then support his veto of this lousy bill.
1341887707044323329 2020-12-24 07:25:35 +0800 <braschen1> The House of Representatives gave themselves a raise of $480 per week also.
1341886425776742402 2020-12-24 07:20:29 +0800 <braschen1> The House of Representatives,  gave themselves a raise equale too $480.00 dollars per week.  They gave the tax payers $600 one time. Thats pretty disgusting.  Support President Trump's veto of this bill.
1341882128037011456 2020-12-24 07:03:24 +0800 <braschen1> Support President Trump's Veto. It is a crappy bill and not good for America.
1341881578339885060 2020-12-24 07:01:13 +0800 <braschen1> She is a disgrace

1341746508081848322 2020-12-23 22:04:30 +0800 <braschen1> Pitiful he is a disgrace
1341469910246023169 2020-12-23 03:45:24 +0800 <braschen1> So Walmart is selling the company to Chinese investors,  the new name China Direct. Wow was the price 53 billion or 153 billion, all those shopping dollars going to China Direct.
1341436316903469065 2020-12-23 01:31:55 +0800 <braschen1> He has no chance, none but RINO'S would support him.  I sure would not.
1341435607315341313 2020-12-23 01:29:06 +0800 <braschen1> Game and Fish laws are vigorously enforced, Why are Election laws or Constitutional laws not enforced?
1341404742682087426 2020-12-22 23:26:27 +0800 <braschen1> Yes NY that is shut just keeps getting more of our tax dollars , for the Arts and entertainment one facility.  Bazaar.
1341369062610391040 2020-12-22 21:04:40 +0800 <braschen1> @SpeakerPelosi @cuban_manny Its part of our history,  you should be ashamed.
1341368818338312192 2020-12-22 21:03:42 +0800 <braschen1> So the state disenfranchised the legal voters too cover up the fraudulent votes, seems rather bizarre doesn't it? @RandPaul  @SenTedCruz

We really don't need or deserve politicians like that. If you can't read it before a vote simply inform leadership that you will alway vote no. Perhaps they will stop.
1341154607213522945 2020-12-22 06:52:30 +0800 <braschen1> @senatemajldr I urge my republican senators to vote no on this, it is outrageous,  simply trash.
1341150487391973376 2020-12-22 06:36:08 +0800 <braschen1> @RepRalphNorman What special interests wrote congress didn't,  who gets the Sweetheart deals? The American Public gets shafted.
1341148588135620608 2020-12-22 06:28:35 +0800 <braschen1> What special interests wrote this bill, we know congress did not write it, who is getting the Sweetheart deals while We the People get the shafts.
1341145085723947013 2020-12-22 06:14:40 +0800 <braschen1> They the Republicans better stand up and fight, or lose all the voting members to a new Trump party.
1341143936539254785 2020-12-22 06:10:06 +0800 <braschen1> Then they are foolish sheep, that cannot think for themselves
1341143111892918273 2020-12-22 06:06:49 +0800 <braschen1> .embers of both parties should in a majority vote no on it.
1341142583070740480 2020-12-22 06:04:43 +0800 <braschen1> Vote no, the leaders in the House and Senate need too stop bringing this type of trash to Congress at the last minute too vote on. Every time they do just vote No.
1341142179599794176 2020-12-22 06:03:07 +0800 <braschen1> Vote no on it.
1341141051445284868 2020-12-22 05:58:38 +0800 <braschen1> About time they wake up, now include all the politicians.
1341139572101705734 2020-12-22 05:52:45 +0800 <braschen1> AG Bill Barr does not think it or voter fraud is a big deal.
1341135662771265536 2020-12-22 05:37:13 +0800 <braschen1> Biden won't do it, they own him.
1341108180470927363 2020-12-22 03:48:01 +0800 <braschen1> @careersingov This is total bull, they have not missed a pay check and they work from home
1341092721679843335 2020-12-22 02:46:35 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  @senatemajldr  @SenTedCruz  @RandPaul  https://t.co/DmDSaabOUV
1341092411733397506 2020-12-22 02:45:21 +0800 <braschen1> If the Republicans and Mitch don't fight for President Trump on January 6th for a contested Electoral College, then they can kiss me goodbye and I am sure many other Republicans.  @senatemajldr  @RandPaul  @SenTedCruz  @JohnCornyn  @MarshaBlackburn
1341029784193802241 2020-12-21 22:36:30 +0800 <braschen1> Shameful that is part of our history, good or bad.
1341028848482324480 2020-12-21 22:32:47 +0800 <braschen1> @johncardillo @BoltJoy Exactly Correct
1341025340400021504 2020-12-21 22:18:50 +0800 <braschen1> The benefits packages put it way over that and after the first year they can't hardly be terminated.
1341018858312876032 2020-12-21 21:53:05 +0800 <braschen1> Obama shut down our only lead smelting factory.
1341017488411291648 2020-12-21 21:47:38 +0800 <braschen1> He was tight with Paul Ryan swamp rats too the end.
1341011787865600002 2020-12-21 21:24:59 +0800 <braschen1> @senatemajldr Shove your $600. Lay off every single bureaucrat and politician.

1340754361782251527 2020-12-21 04:22:04 +0800 <braschen1> @JoeBiden @HMLoeschMcK No you need to concede.
1340753122667483137 2020-12-21 04:17:09 +0800 <braschen1> The people are not interested in your lousy $600.00 dollars.
1340750424593362944 2020-12-21 04:06:25 +0800 <braschen1> Sounds about right , he does not seem too take his job seriously.
1340749914482102272 2020-12-21 04:04:24 +0800 <braschen1> He deserves to get the whole ching bang thrown at him, 20 years hard time.
1340745124838518792 2020-12-21 03:45:22 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  although I would not get my hopes up that SCOTUS will hear it or even gives a shit, about our Constitutional laws.
1340742947059486720 2020-12-21 03:36:43 +0800 <braschen1> It's Fraudulent,  no doubts.  @RandPaul  @MarshaBlackburn  @SenTedCruz
1340738069914398730 2020-12-21 03:17:20 +0800 <braschen1> @JonathanTurley Barr was a do nothing AG and he ignored blatant Election Fraud and lawlessness.
1340687829974827014 2020-12-20 23:57:42 +0800 <braschen1> Thats the only truthful way forward for America.  Jo Biden should Concede
1340664105024315393 2020-12-20 22:23:25 +0800 <braschen1> About time the same should go for his entire administration.
1340663821011185664 2020-12-20 22:22:17 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  they care not for the people we are just necessary too keep feathering their own beds. Stop voting for those that care not, they are easy to spot.
1340658667092324355 2020-12-20 22:01:49 +0800 <braschen1> @JackPosobiec @Joell88304719 I had no use for the Beatles their way of life the examples they set or most of their music.  Sorry call me bad taste if you must.
1340656010806095873 2020-12-20 21:51:15 +0800 <braschen1> Massive Election Fraud in Nevada,  for sure, among other states.
1340650020031361024 2020-12-20 21:27:27 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  guess what many in Congress and many in SCOTUS just don't care.
1340300882731294720 2020-12-19 22:20:06 +0800 <braschen1> Communist controlled Canadian cops

1340289879650000896 2020-12-19 21:36:23 +0800 <braschen1> Look for more fraud.
1340102135669792770 2020-12-19 09:10:21 +0800 <braschen1> @Jim_Jordan @paphotog American want our elections to be honest and people who commit election fraud too be held accountable.  We also want the country open for business.
1340101267201376258 2020-12-19 09:06:54 +0800 <braschen1> She says she understands there are fraudulent ballots, but count them anyway this is not an investigation.  This woman is part of the fraud cover up.
1340097988438462464 2020-12-19 08:53:52 +0800 <braschen1> LoL, most of NY wealth is relocating to Florida.

1340086510989832192 2020-12-19 08:08:16 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  @SenTedCruz  @RandPaul
1340053758106083331 2020-12-19 05:58:07 +0800 <braschen1> This is pretty solid information that President Trump has evidence of foreign interference in our 2020 Elections.  Perhaps this will trigger hie EO. @tedcruz  @RandPaul  @MarshaBlackburn  @SenTomCotton

1340048293972357121 2020-12-19 05:36:24 +0800 <braschen1> This is just another travesty of Justice in the State of Georgia,  people breaking State and Federal Election law are not being prosecuted? Now the DOJ must step in and prosecute federally.  @realDonaldTrump  @FBI
1340033675422031874 2020-12-19 04:38:19 +0800 <braschen1> @GovChristie No thanks, you're a big time loser.
1340028100390899713 2020-12-19 04:16:10 +0800 <braschen1> They need too do a random audit and forensic check of the voting machines and software at this time in several major counties Fulton for sure.

1339937666629070848 2020-12-18 22:16:49 +0800 <braschen1> Throw out the illegal vote, pretty simple.
1339937340257648643 2020-12-18 22:15:31 +0800 <braschen1> They know there was foreign intervention in our elections,  and they won't just stop now.
1339931896944484352 2020-12-18 21:53:53 +0800 <braschen1> You Brits, need too just Walk away tell European Union to go fly a kite. You have your own country too run.
1339929192495001601 2020-12-18 21:43:08 +0800 <braschen1> Time for Patriots too hold a protest right outside their door. They allowed election fraud and the cover up of it.
1339926880976318464 2020-12-18 21:33:57 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, that is unacceptable and heads need to roll over that.

1339644736051830787 2020-12-18 02:52:49 +0800 <braschen1> What about your Senators,  are they going to challenge the contested electors
1339642365385076739 2020-12-18 02:43:23 +0800 <braschen1> Send the State Police in to enforce the Subpoenas.
1339641665431228417 2020-12-18 02:40:37 +0800 <braschen1> Correct and that is shameful, you can remove yourself from those that are cussing, but you are stuck with a corrupt government.
1339641257950400515 2020-12-18 02:38:59 +0800 <braschen1> If true and I think it probably is, the Supreme Court has been rendered useless,  by the Chief Justice Roberts,  and the others excluding the 2 Constitutionalist are cowards.
1339639361411964928 2020-12-18 02:31:27 +0800 <braschen1> Time too hold the fraudsters and those who funded them responsible.
1339578393403289600 2020-12-17 22:29:11 +0800 <braschen1> The Election results are bogus,  not to be believed.
1339575289077231617 2020-12-17 22:16:51 +0800 <braschen1> Unacceptable
1339575183699546114 2020-12-17 22:16:26 +0800 <braschen1> Unacceptable,  fire her and the lot of them.
1339574996843319296 2020-12-17 22:15:42 +0800 <braschen1> This cannot stand, they the bureaucrats in the agency must now be terminated for willful dereliction of duty. Fire all if the report is not complete as required.

1339189114747424770 2020-12-16 20:42:20 +0800 <braschen1> No I don't doubt this. He is certainly swampy
1339188754452520961 2020-12-16 20:40:54 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you and them.
1338998813659459585 2020-12-16 08:06:09 +0800 <braschen1> This is outrageous Justice Roberts must resign he cannot tell Junior Justices how to vote. If he thinks there would be riots if Biden loses wait till he see if Biden wins.

1338915479440723968 2020-12-16 02:35:00 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1338914816270983174 2020-12-16 02:32:22 +0800 <braschen1> Why would the judge allow this? What do they have too hide if there was no substantial fraud?

1338634206738608128 2020-12-15 07:57:20 +0800 <braschen1> This evidence does not matter too our Justice Department or law enforcement agencies, the courts don't care. Only the People and the President really care, as we are not part of the corrupt government bureaucratic cable.
1338631541853999105 2020-12-15 07:46:44 +0800 <braschen1> He just resigned effect Dec 23rd
1338630857968525317 2020-12-15 07:44:01 +0800 <braschen1> It a letter of Resignation,  I would bet President Trump was happy to receive it. This guy has done little to terminate the 2 tiered Justice system in this country.

1338273195036643328 2020-12-14 08:02:48 +0800 <braschen1> Of course there was massive election fraud,  and not just in those 4 or 6 contested swing States, look at CALIFORNIA
1338263351164624897 2020-12-14 07:23:41 +0800 <braschen1> Good for her, others perhaps will now come forward and speak the truth.

Unconstitutional plain and simple.  Read it you might be a wakened
1338112192051286018 2020-12-13 21:23:02 +0800 <braschen1> The entire election was fraudulent i wold bet every state has significant fraud,  heck CA probably went Red for Trump.
1338108043783974914 2020-12-13 21:06:33 +0800 <braschen1> True, unfortunately our country now has a 2 tiered Justice System.
1337848662580400131 2020-12-13 03:55:51 +0800 <braschen1> No they are not interested,  fraud in our elections are just fine with them and SCOTUS, or so it appears.

1337556753299419138 2020-12-12 08:35:55 +0800 <braschen1> Under this Corruption in our Justice System,  no one does pathetic
1337554910582333447 2020-12-12 08:28:35 +0800 <braschen1> This should have been revealed too the people before the election.
1337553565972393984 2020-12-12 08:23:15 +0800 <braschen1> @KansasCityJoe @hornetgate @NickAdamsinUSA It doesn't,  but the Constitution clearly has election laws that are to be followed by the states, those 4 states choose too disregard those Constitutional laws, thereby disenfranchised every voter in every state that follows the Constitutional laws.
1337549280597389319 2020-12-12 08:06:13 +0800 <braschen1> They of corse are wrong every voter in Texas has standing we were disenfranchised by the unconstitutional acts of those 4 states
1337548438192467968 2020-12-12 08:02:52 +0800 <braschen1> @RoscoeBDavis1 How did The new Justice vote on this?
1337547901027889154 2020-12-12 08:00:44 +0800 <braschen1> Every citizen that voted and every state outside of these 4 unconstitutional states has standing, there unlawful acts have disenfranchised the voter as well as the other States electors. Pretty simple. Therefore fraudulent elections if Biden is inaugurated he is Fraudulent Pres.
1337545620278677505 2020-12-12 07:51:40 +0800 <braschen1> I agree, Patriots,  it is now up to us to keep law and order, they have let our Constitution be scrapped
1337544285181386752 2020-12-12 07:46:22 +0800 <braschen1> It is they just denied Texas suit

1337208974320558081 2020-12-11 09:33:58 +0800 <braschen1> The Constitution is the law across America, those 4 state going outside the Constitution has impacted the will of the people in the 46 states that followed the election laws within the Constitution.  The Constitution is our basis of law or it is nothing?
1337172192426070016 2020-12-11 07:07:48 +0800 <braschen1> Me also
1337168223305871360 2020-12-11 06:52:02 +0800 <braschen1> Can't say the same for that other Texas Senator whats his name Cornyn or some such thing.
1337167370834612226 2020-12-11 06:48:39 +0800 <braschen1> That is a pitiful excuse for lawlessness. Our Constitution matters or it doesn't,  which will it be.
1337105698057035779 2020-12-11 02:43:35 +0800 <braschen1> @varanid_54 @Barnes_Law @Scotus Fools Speak

1337011122784841729 2020-12-10 20:27:46 +0800 <braschen1> This guy is not too be trusted Evil.
1336813227683041282 2020-12-10 07:21:24 +0800 <braschen1> Its in Front of the world to watch.
1336811582035275780 2020-12-10 07:14:52 +0800 <braschen1> I doubt it, this would mean they are exercising good common sense.  That unlikely
1336802599736139778 2020-12-10 06:39:11 +0800 <braschen1> @Acosta @AlofsLisa You Sir are just a Democrat lap dog, and I am doing a disservice too good dogs everywhere.
1336801984050049025 2020-12-10 06:36:44 +0800 <braschen1> And it is equally past the time that the people of California Stop  vote for and electing these Democrats that inact unconstitution law and harm the population.
1336799705913839621 2020-12-10 06:27:41 +0800 <braschen1> @USAO_DE @DoooggieMom Too funny truth is your agency should be dismantled,  start over with good solid non-DC people.
1336799367764828162 2020-12-10 06:26:20 +0800 <braschen1> This law maker is a disgrace to the State of Michigan,  who votes for trash like her.
1336797606790516737 2020-12-10 06:19:20 +0800 <braschen1> @SenFeinstein You had a spy on staff for 20 years, you have never done anything in the best interest of our country. Lies
1336733095890849793 2020-12-10 02:03:00 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  their fraudulent and unconstitutional actions have disenfranchised the Voters in many of the States that are bringing this Suit. Follow the Constitution.
1336686913663733761 2020-12-09 22:59:29 +0800 <braschen1> Pat Toomey needs too resign.  Pennsylvania Cheated like crazy and needs to be held accountable.  @SenToomey  @realDonaldTrump
1336686252012294151 2020-12-09 22:56:51 +0800 <braschen1> @Forecast432hz You just keep asking questions,  where's the Meat?
1336679622960959488 2020-12-09 22:30:31 +0800 <braschen1> The Constitution if upheld does not establish the right of those States to decide through fraudulent activity (a little or a lot) the will of the people in the remaining lawful states election.
1336678906120777728 2020-12-09 22:27:40 +0800 <braschen1> @PavlakJason @Elisa_freedom Oh well
1336678360521580544 2020-12-09 22:25:30 +0800 <braschen1> This Politicians political career is our, hope he got rich.
1336674428558725120 2020-12-09 22:09:52 +0800 <braschen1> The only way that will happen is too cut off the supply of money too those corrupt politicians
1336674142674882562 2020-12-09 22:08:44 +0800 <braschen1> I bet they the Supreme Court,  leaves it in the hands of the States.
1336672966692790274 2020-12-09 22:04:04 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you Ted.
1336669484808069125 2020-12-09 21:50:13 +0800 <braschen1> Yes and all because the SCOTUS would not do their job and uphold the Constitution.
1336661812444590081 2020-12-09 21:19:44 +0800 <braschen1> He is sleeping with the enemy,  No not the Media.
1336660585681973248 2020-12-09 21:14:52 +0800 <braschen1> He will leave it in the hands of the State legislators, Pass the buck. If he does this State should do as the please regarding Constitutional Law, even Secede.
1336659983807770625 2020-12-09 21:12:28 +0800 <braschen1> Judges are quick to say its up to the State, Instead of upholding our Constitution and laws. What will they say when states start to Secede ?
1336655966838861827 2020-12-09 20:56:31 +0800 <braschen1> Its not the Fault of SCOTUS, but it is their job responsibility,  if they don't hold up our Constitution against Rouge states, the The People must.
1336655115978207237 2020-12-09 20:53:08 +0800 <braschen1> Well the Supreme Court is there to hold up our Constitution,  not just let Rouge States follow the Constitution only when it pleases them.
1336495654483398656 2020-12-09 10:19:29 +0800 <braschen1> @SenSchumer Fools Speak

1336484317506236416 2020-12-09 09:34:26 +0800 <braschen1> Satellite should resign,  he has been compromised by Chinese Spy, and probably farted out loud again.
1336479886236639233 2020-12-09 09:16:50 +0800 <braschen1> @richard_kranz @gregkellyusa Oh well
1336474655662673924 2020-12-09 08:56:03 +0800 <braschen1> No the bigger case will be heard From Texas and Louisiana.
1336470825273335809 2020-12-09 08:40:49 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you Governor that is a good move, more beef producing state should be looking to do this as well. @GovAbbott
1336466328862027777 2020-12-09 08:22:57 +0800 <braschen1> He was played and is Scum
1336465795182956544 2020-12-09 08:20:50 +0800 <braschen1> @AnubisinNYC @Rockmedia @janewells FOOLS SPEAK
1336465192037789697 2020-12-09 08:18:26 +0800 <braschen1> Good Judge

1336460684591325187 2020-12-09 08:00:32 +0800 <braschen1> Thank you so much for your service.
1336413502110633989 2020-12-09 04:53:02 +0800 <braschen1> President Trump easily wins Georgia if only the Legal ballots are counted.
1336404890353078273 2020-12-09 04:18:49 +0800 <braschen1> The judge is Scum, imo
1336404501838880768 2020-12-09 04:17:17 +0800 <braschen1> No matter, nothing happens too them, they are not held accountable.
1336402822607335427 2020-12-09 04:10:36 +0800 <braschen1> @va_shiva @archer6282 I did not think there were any Republicans in the state of MASSACHUSETTS
1336402052772220930 2020-12-09 04:07:33 +0800 <braschen1> I agree,  he is trying too legislate from the bench.
1336092337676689409 2020-12-08 07:36:51 +0800 <braschen1> She is an activists liberal Judge.
1336091899136978949 2020-12-08 07:35:06 +0800 <braschen1> Probably Rand Paul, or possibly this new Lady that was just elected from Colorado,  can't recall her name Republican.
1336089553153757193 2020-12-08 07:25:47 +0800 <braschen1> #StopTheSteaI  Audit the Signatures  @GaSecofState
1336088471069478916 2020-12-08 07:21:29 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1336086338840502273 2020-12-08 07:13:01 +0800 <braschen1> Not without President Trump,  the Swamp Rats will run wild, and most Americans are too busy to care.
1336084149627727872 2020-12-08 07:04:19 +0800 <braschen1> Disgusting this is American History.  Fools
1336077589673291776 2020-12-08 06:38:15 +0800 <braschen1> I just wish he was more insistent on getting to the bottom of the election fraud.  I like him.
1336076202403094532 2020-12-08 06:32:44 +0800 <braschen1> Well,  we really need to hurry that knowledge a long
1335965282087690242 2020-12-07 23:11:58 +0800 <braschen1> @arelab13 @BigAL_LEWIS New York residents should empeach both Governor Como and Mayor Deblaiso
1335964054536511490 2020-12-07 23:07:06 +0800 <braschen1> The people of Georgia need to come together and bring a class action suit against the state election board and @GaSecofState for election fraud and certification of fraud. You are being lied too and disenfranchised as are the rest of the voters in the US.
1335962422855823360 2020-12-07 23:00:37 +0800 <braschen1> The same has happened in the USA there is widespread evidence and our AG and Justice Department won't do anything about it. Bill Barr should resign Today or do his job.
1335742520706396166 2020-12-07 08:26:48 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1335734468653572096 2020-12-07 07:54:48 +0800 <braschen1> I agree
1335733606229159937 2020-12-07 07:51:23 +0800 <braschen1> @jimsterdotcom @SecPompeo Fools Speak
1335732462937395207 2020-12-07 07:46:50 +0800 <braschen1> He just can't help himself,  the lies just come out.
1335731604824727554 2020-12-07 07:43:25 +0800 <braschen1> Not really you need an ID to buy cigarettes.
1335730482617737216 2020-12-07 07:38:58 +0800 <braschen1> This cover up of federal election fraud is just amazing very little Media coverage and our Law enforcement agencies seem to be out to lunch not even questioning the people seen on these videos. Unprecedented. At some point the heads of these agencies must be held accountable.
1335724935793283075 2020-12-07 07:16:55 +0800 <braschen1> This is disgusting,  the Democrats who have authored this treasonous Election Fraud must be held accountable.  They are breaking federal laws.
1335721840875085827 2020-12-07 07:04:38 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1335719067123130368 2020-12-07 06:53:36 +0800 <braschen1> Like Nazi's

1335622151727173635 2020-12-07 00:28:30 +0800 <braschen1> @MaxineR2911 It was posted jokingly,  I am well aware of what Barr said, and also what his department is doing,  which is not as much as they should be doing.  He should also be reassuring the voters that we will have free and fair Elections the laws will be enforced.
1335617767995813889 2020-12-07 00:11:05 +0800 <braschen1> Thank you Sir.
1335614252292431873 2020-12-06 23:57:06 +0800 <braschen1> @alicetweet No, not until the big Democrat steal has been rectified,  and people are prosecuted.  The Media is lost, they are the Enemy of the People.  #StopTheSteaI
1335611783667740674 2020-12-06 23:47:18 +0800 <braschen1> Man the State of Georgia election process is a huge mess, powerful people should lose their job by the dozens.  Then lay the massive fraud at their feet it is disgusting.  New election.

1335599073827708929 2020-12-06 22:56:48 +0800 <braschen1> Thats our new Justice Department,  I personally won't stand for it, they must start upholding our Constitutional Laws and Rights.
1335598154897641475 2020-12-06 22:53:08 +0800 <braschen1> WI. Must do the right thing for the American people  audit the vote and signature.
1335587040704991233 2020-12-06 22:08:59 +0800 <braschen1> The state is ate up with evidence of Election Fraud and the State Officials at many levels are doing their best to hide and cover it up. They must be held accountable.  The same goes in AZ, MI, WI, NV and PA. @GovKemp
1335580978715258880 2020-12-06 21:44:53 +0800 <braschen1> Sullivan has no good reason to complain his Democrat masters came up with this bogus mail in ballot plan it was never going to work yet they proceeded and this corruption in our Justice system tried to assist.  Now they are upset that it just made the Fraud more obvious.
1335578549286297601 2020-12-06 21:35:14 +0800 <braschen1> Massive Election Fraud.
1335576585777393664 2020-12-06 21:27:26 +0800 <braschen1> The state of Arizona under the current governor is in a state of insurrection,  they are aware of massive election fraud,  but refuse too rectify it through lawful actions, the Officials and Governor chose too Certify false election numbers. The Federal Marshall's are needed.
1335366475847229444 2020-12-06 07:32:32 +0800 <braschen1> Our Justice Department is simply sitting this out, i am disgusted
1335365440906866688 2020-12-06 07:28:25 +0800 <braschen1> Pretty heavy on the Cheese.
1335359495841738758 2020-12-06 07:04:48 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1335359107344297985 2020-12-06 07:03:15 +0800 <braschen1> The Democrats will try to tax them away from us, wait and see
1335358666426503169 2020-12-06 07:01:30 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1335357534165667840 2020-12-06 06:57:00 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  it is not law and that stupid Judge knows better.
1335357053179748352 2020-12-06 06:55:05 +0800 <braschen1> Thats the Law. So yes.
1335354182119940096 2020-12-06 06:43:41 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  you must vote we do not need even 1 more Democrat politician, especially in the Senate.
1335353364406800384 2020-12-06 06:40:26 +0800 <braschen1> @jl_mccabe @reubing @P8R1OT @OANN Yep nothing like CNN
1335351101412020225 2020-12-06 06:31:26 +0800 <braschen1> @pnjaban @bellgel He is enthusiastic,  but I would not call him bat sh_t crazy. He is a Patriot and trying to do the right thing for our country,  the politicians and Agency Heads are doing little to nothing.  Something must be done to save our Republic.
1335350287310204933 2020-12-06 06:28:12 +0800 <braschen1> Yes I do
1335345807713837061 2020-12-06 06:10:24 +0800 <braschen1> No, they should definitely vote Republican
1335338543938416644 2020-12-06 05:41:32 +0800 <braschen1> @GovAbbott
1335338230158422016 2020-12-06 05:40:18 +0800 <braschen1> How can this be, it must not stand.  @GovAbbott  @realDonaldTrump @RoscoeBDavis1
1335318073113522177 2020-12-06 04:20:12 +0800 <braschen1> @SteelhorseQ @4everameric They certainly trying too.
1335316451897602049 2020-12-06 04:13:45 +0800 <braschen1> @KellyFilms @jimdandybuck @prayingmedic No before that, I believe
1335289336678461441 2020-12-06 02:26:00 +0800 <braschen1> Thats ok, our Justice Department just does not care to hear it.
1335264561344229378 2020-12-06 00:47:34 +0800 <braschen1> @JenGriffinFNC You have lost your way, open your eyes and your mind, then report the real news, please
1335261494947287044 2020-12-06 00:35:23 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  its time too put them out of work and politics for good.
1335223258283732992 2020-12-05 22:03:26 +0800 <braschen1> What state
1335213207112323075 2020-12-05 21:23:30 +0800 <braschen1> They have no moral character,  the rules are for the Peons, not the rule makers.
1335210946374098951 2020-12-05 21:14:31 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump @Junga_II @KLoeffler @sendavidperdue @BrianKempGA Exactly Correct  @GovKemp
1335208304218427392 2020-12-05 21:04:01 +0800 <braschen1> The American people know this, but the Republicans are just too timid too shout it from the roof tops, you we Republicans are on the way to losing the Party , if it weren't for President Trump there would be no sizeable Republican party period. Its time for Republicans too fight.
1335202635775881216 2020-12-05 20:41:29 +0800 <braschen1> If I were the president I would appeal this ruling too the next court and all the way too the Supreme Court if necessary. Everyone know this DACA is not lawful and was never a law period. When Obama instituted it he said as much. This federal judge is trying too legislate.
1335017438719729668 2020-12-05 08:25:35 +0800 <braschen1> @J_Philbeck @DavidShafer Thats true,  but not Justice,  a crime is a crime and needs to be prosecuted or more will happen.
1335015600683429894 2020-12-05 08:18:17 +0800 <braschen1> Better hurry some corrupt judge will reverse the decision and cover up the crime.
1335015202518167553 2020-12-05 08:16:42 +0800 <braschen1> Wow he is brilliant
1335012494671228930 2020-12-05 08:05:56 +0800 <braschen1> Pitiful,
1335011049368670210 2020-12-05 08:00:12 +0800 <braschen1> @J_Philbeck @DavidShafer One illegal vote is to many, wouldn't you agree.
1335009750430474248 2020-12-05 07:55:02 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1335006917807267843 2020-12-05 07:43:47 +0800 <braschen1> She and others need to go to prison over these very serious federal election crimes.
1335006120386179072 2020-12-05 07:40:36 +0800 <braschen1> Prosecute
1335005925514616833 2020-12-05 07:39:50 +0800 <braschen1> She needs too be held accountable for her fraudulent election activities,  it is a Federal Crime.
1334997103811158016 2020-12-05 07:04:47 +0800 <braschen1> @MichaelCoudrey @bellgel There are corrupt judges, just go over his head appeal
1334996664973750272 2020-12-05 07:03:02 +0800 <braschen1> Where is our law enforcement agencies?
1334994706393075713 2020-12-05 06:55:15 +0800 <braschen1> @tedlieu @LLinWood You Sir are a terrible person and a worse representative.
1334991814210842630 2020-12-05 06:43:46 +0800 <braschen1> @holybullies @RealVinnieJames @CyrusShares That not the truth
1334991318100140039 2020-12-05 06:41:47 +0800 <braschen1> Urges a signature audit,  is different than Orders.
1334986703942131713 2020-12-05 06:23:27 +0800 <braschen1> She will be the one that the Democrats will sacrifice,  she will go too Prison. RUBY
1334986175849910274 2020-12-05 06:21:21 +0800 <braschen1> @newtgingrich So what
1334982657634144256 2020-12-05 06:07:23 +0800 <braschen1> We all knew it, but the lying Democrats would not admit to it.
1334982407674597376 2020-12-05 06:06:23 +0800 <braschen1> The @GaSecofState needs too be arrested for Federal Election Fraud,  he has known that these unlawful acts/Crimes took place and has been covering for them. He needs too be held accountable.  @SidneyPowell1  @realDonaldTrump  @GovKemp
1334980552252911621 2020-12-05 05:59:01 +0800 <braschen1> He must direct @GaSecofState to do so immediately.
1334974536333336578 2020-12-05 05:35:06 +0800 <braschen1> Why would they not follow the laws that they made. Obviously they want to Cheat the people of these United States,  this is not just about Wisconsin,  their fraudulent election activities effect the the whole country.  People need to go too jail @SidneyPowell1  @SenTedCruz
1334962054839619585 2020-12-05 04:45:30 +0800 <braschen1> @JustinGrayWSB Fools Speak
1334957131997589505 2020-12-05 04:25:57 +0800 <braschen1> There is much widespread election fraud.  The @GaSecofState should do the right thing and order a signature audit of all the ballots and have all machines examined,  now the longer he waits the worse it makes him look His Boss has already called for him to do it @realDonaldTrump
1334955236402802689 2020-12-05 04:18:25 +0800 <braschen1> @DavidWaddell5 @MiriamRoseMc Biden won't be President
1334944489249628160 2020-12-05 03:35:42 +0800 <braschen1> This is how KY ended up with a Democrat as the Governor
1334872570563358723 2020-12-04 22:49:56 +0800 <braschen1> He must insist and instruct his Secretary of State to perform the Signatures Audit at once.
1334871208920293376 2020-12-04 22:44:31 +0800 <braschen1> This guy is definition of a slimy politician,  I would not believe much of what he has to say, She is far more credible than he and she did so under penalty.
1334859895359893506 2020-12-04 21:59:34 +0800 <braschen1> @philchappell @peterjmcdade @realDonaldTrump @OANN It's a big swamp takes some time. But you know that.
1334859497160970242 2020-12-04 21:57:59 +0800 <braschen1> Caught but nothing was done to the bad actors.  Our FBI is used like a political attack dog too go after who ever the Democrats want Railroaded, like General Flynn.
1334858618416599041 2020-12-04 21:54:29 +0800 <braschen1> The locals should never be in charge of their own election. Too much temptation
1334856699950280704 2020-12-04 21:46:52 +0800 <braschen1> @KLoeffler Kelly, What is your opinion on the Election Fraud taking place there in Georgia and Governor Kemp doing as much as he can too hide the truth?
1334855883520696320 2020-12-04 21:43:37 +0800 <braschen1> This is the root of the problem "Too Large " too many bueracrats.
1334851727812685829 2020-12-04 21:27:06 +0800 <braschen1> He should veto it.
1334851394222874626 2020-12-04 21:25:47 +0800 <braschen1> @peterjmcdade @realDonaldTrump @OANN Those agencies are full of bureaucrats they are indeed the basis of the swamp.
1334851014978101250 2020-12-04 21:24:16 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump @OANN What does Bill Barr have to say about this,  it sounds to me like its pretty widespread,  and could have changed the outcome of our elections.  Of course I am no high powered investigator like him.  @SenTedCruz  @TomFitton  @SidneyPowell1
1334564791092916224 2020-12-04 02:26:55 +0800 <braschen1> Yes and this election should be either overturned or every ballot be hand inspected and audited. This voting process/system should not be allowed for the Senate run off election.  The public has no confidence in it. @JennaEllisEsq  @dbongino
1334563684853686273 2020-12-04 02:22:32 +0800 <braschen1> Yep, ask Bill Barr.
1334563363330920453 2020-12-04 02:21:15 +0800 <braschen1> That Representative has forgotten that he actually works for the people. He should be reminded by the people come election day, he is very arrogant.
1334560310401884168 2020-12-04 02:09:07 +0800 <braschen1> They know they will lose.
1334559334924214272 2020-12-04 02:05:15 +0800 <braschen1> Every  one of you are still drawing a paycheck from the American people,  thats outrageous.
1334557367711772676 2020-12-04 01:57:25 +0800 <braschen1> @tedcruz Ted, you need too totally hitch your wagon too We the People fight for our country America.
1334550439686254599 2020-12-04 01:29:54 +0800 <braschen1> Yes you can and that is what needs to be done.  Clearly we must hold the Senate.
1334536712949788673 2020-12-04 00:35:21 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1334536312410484737 2020-12-04 00:33:46 +0800 <braschen1> More government control,  you people need too stand up and say enough is enough.
1334535418960896005 2020-12-04 00:30:13 +0800 <braschen1> This is fantastic show those NY Dictators,  that they work for the American Public.
1334534728343580674 2020-12-04 00:27:28 +0800 <braschen1> I would just say be careful of big DC insiders
1334533734993981440 2020-12-04 00:23:31 +0800 <braschen1> You are correct Sir we should ask the people of Georgia too vote for those candidates running for the Senate.  @johncardillo is also Correct,  if President Trump loses we may never have another fair election.
1334530917306658818 2020-12-04 00:12:19 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1334530715141201920 2020-12-04 00:11:31 +0800 <braschen1> They know that they Cheated
1334530382956552192 2020-12-04 00:10:12 +0800 <braschen1> Don't forget Joe Biden was completely on board also.
1334528065590996994 2020-12-04 00:00:59 +0800 <braschen1> The people must hold their nose and vote these Republicans into the Senate. We cannot afford to lose the Senate.
1334522818231459841 2020-12-03 23:40:08 +0800 <braschen1> @FilterlessKiki @MRSTXFabFace Sounds like Fraud,  but but it Can't be, AG Bill Barr say no widespread evidence of Election Fraud.  For that matter no evidence of the DOJ even investigating Election Fraud.  @BernardKerik  @JennaEllisEsq  @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle
1334495689720668161 2020-12-03 21:52:20 +0800 <braschen1> @Nick_Clamorgan @RedPill381 She will just ignore it.
1334493055689351170 2020-12-03 21:41:52 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, but no widespread election Fraud,  correct Bill Barr
1334489355893821440 2020-12-03 21:27:10 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, but but, There is no Widespread Election Fraud  right AG Bill Barr?
1334487979033829386 2020-12-03 21:21:42 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, but no widespread election Fraud,  ask Bill Barr
1334487313972404226 2020-12-03 21:19:03 +0800 <braschen1> This guy knows they cheated and he knows We know.  I would suggest he not certify the results and his guilt.
1334485071923994626 2020-12-03 21:10:09 +0800 <braschen1> Dictator
1334481629918720006 2020-12-03 20:56:28 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed with true justice in mind (not conviction %) no more specialized treatment for political parties or politicians. They are just elected representatives of We the People.
1334480436337258503 2020-12-03 20:51:44 +0800 <braschen1> No person is perfect,  Lin &amp; Sidney are at the very least giving their time and considerable knowledge and experience,  too stop the abundant election fraud that is taken place all over our country.  They are Patriots certainly not Perfect,  but doing much more than most of us.
1334475581258338312 2020-12-03 20:32:26 +0800 <braschen1> @RandyRRQuaid @chbstone2 I am sure no one from the DOJ or FBI has interviewed him regarding his involvement in the election fraud,  the Ukraine,  China , kick back accusations,  or the Arrest warrant that was issued by Ukraine for his arrest.
1334474536071426049 2020-12-03 20:28:17 +0800 <braschen1> Thanks too the Donald Trump administration.
1334474345184448515 2020-12-03 20:27:31 +0800 <braschen1> @MattBraynard They simply don't care.
1334471397796671489 2020-12-03 20:15:49 +0800 <braschen1> Good for those Globalist,  but you're never going too know if indeed it was/is the Vaccine, don't always believe what you see and very little of what the Media tells you.
1334469419448348672 2020-12-03 20:07:57 +0800 <braschen1> @ShotsRangOut Yet people vote her into office,  thats a shame but it happens all over the country. People are just too busy, too get out and inform the people who vote for them on how they really believe a the trash they vote for.
1334467372418297859 2020-12-03 19:59:49 +0800 <braschen1> I rather go hunting a little fishing a watch my wife ride her horse.  I am over golf. It was fun while it lasted though.
1334465200464990209 2020-12-03 19:51:11 +0800 <braschen1> @supportallred @laurab3 You look great, hope you feel that way.
1334463849748115456 2020-12-03 19:45:49 +0800 <braschen1> You can thank the Obama administration for that and too many Democrat politicians have gone right along with that same theme.  It's disgusting
1334463117942779904 2020-12-03 19:42:55 +0800 <braschen1> @1GrumpyOldGamer Well I gave it up about 10 years ago  played couple time a week always with a cart up in the Maryland,  DC area. I thought it was becoming more expensive and time consuming.  Besides how many hobbies can a guy have.
1334286380025999368 2020-12-03 08:00:37 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1334285572664389639 2020-12-03 07:57:25 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Sir.
1334284791311716352 2020-12-03 07:54:18 +0800 <braschen1> I am a little old, but not scared.
1334284305997193217 2020-12-03 07:52:23 +0800 <braschen1> Not likely
1334282073931124736 2020-12-03 07:43:30 +0800 <braschen1> It is somewhat expensive.
1334278562162085888 2020-12-03 07:29:33 +0800 <braschen1> Are the FBI even aware that there have been allocations of election Fraud?
1334271083265060865 2020-12-03 06:59:50 +0800 <braschen1> @TioBrunoGabriel @ChuckCallesto Oh I think there are plenty of law suits, oh by the way they take place in court not outside. Just saying
1334268871629541377 2020-12-03 06:51:03 +0800 <braschen1> 2% Of the ballots examined were fraudulent,  wow Bill Barr said there was no evidence of widespread election fraud,  this is AZ 2500 miles from GA, seems they did spread the fraudulent activity pretty widely.
1334238556760518657 2020-12-03 04:50:35 +0800 <braschen1> Awesome
1334235348487053317 2020-12-03 04:37:50 +0800 <braschen1> It's time for Joe Biden too concede this fraudulent election.  Perhaps he can stay out of Jail.
1334234441603018752 2020-12-03 04:34:14 +0800 <braschen1> This fraud does not only effect WI voters it disenfranchised voters from every state in our country, this fraud must be prosecuted and those votes thrown out.
1334232124245872640 2020-12-03 04:25:01 +0800 <braschen1> Can they prove it Bill Barr say no evidence of widespread election fraud.
1334231866333859840 2020-12-03 04:24:00 +0800 <braschen1> Who is telling you this, and where is their proof of it please.
1334230657669718017 2020-12-03 04:19:12 +0800 <braschen1> Who says this?
1334230125781667840 2020-12-03 04:17:05 +0800 <braschen1> @Trey_VonDinkis @TrumpWorldPeace @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @GenFlynn Yes but, AG Bill Barr and the Noose investigating agency has seen no widespread election Fraud.
1334225840138235906 2020-12-03 04:00:03 +0800 <braschen1> Can't be Bill Barr said no evidence of widespread election fraud.   Well this isn't widespread but it is enough to alter the outcome.
1334225328085086213 2020-12-03 03:58:01 +0800 <braschen1> Yet no law enforcement agencies care to investigate. Seems weird,  I guess no Noose was reported.
1334222592849420291 2020-12-03 03:47:09 +0800 <braschen1> The people of AZ should be appalled or ashamed for voting for Democrats
1334219438837608449 2020-12-03 03:34:37 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you sir
1334219211162456065 2020-12-03 03:33:43 +0800 <braschen1> @RepTexasMom @MalcolmOutLoud @CoyHamp @realDonaldTrump @SidneyPowell1 Yes but have you seen any action from him or his agency.
1334212720405655552 2020-12-03 03:07:55 +0800 <braschen1> I bet he does.
1334210685912412160 2020-12-03 02:59:50 +0800 <braschen1> @ksorbs @blueyedlvrgirl I wonder if Bill Barr knows this?
1334205768854335489 2020-12-03 02:40:18 +0800 <braschen1> No clue?
1334204918526304258 2020-12-03 02:36:55 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you and him.
1334203945913360386 2020-12-03 02:33:03 +0800 <braschen1> @MalcolmOutLoud @CoyHamp @realDonaldTrump @SidneyPowell1 Old Bill Barr can see no wide spread election fraud.
1334203176917086215 2020-12-03 02:30:00 +0800 <braschen1> They can't it just more evidence of fraudulent actions, Right Bill Barr.
1334202764574994433 2020-12-03 02:28:22 +0800 <braschen1> Communist New York  soon there won't be anyone living there that wants to work or raise a decent family.  Even the Stock Exchange is looking at leaving NYC.
1334190433988206598 2020-12-03 01:39:22 +0800 <braschen1> If you cheated too win did you really win. Those few counties that allowed and approved the fraud not only disenfranchised WI voters but all of America's voters
1334188993207029760 2020-12-03 01:33:38 +0800 <braschen1> Thats exactly why Americans have little confidence in our Justice Department and FBI,  the World is watching also. It's just disgusting.
1334184454198267904 2020-12-03 01:15:36 +0800 <braschen1> I thought since President Trump got this vaccine expedited and approved,  you were not going to allow it in NY. What a hypocrite you are Sir.
1334181042245267456 2020-12-03 01:02:03 +0800 <braschen1> Those counties disenfranchised the whole Nation.  Nation Wide fraud.
1334180678032912393 2020-12-03 01:00:36 +0800 <braschen1> It may not be 50 states but I would bet it's more than 30 states. Some obviously worse than others.
1334179753235001351 2020-12-03 00:56:55 +0800 <braschen1> America knows that, it's just more stalling and double talk from corrupt government agencies.
1334159218648215560 2020-12-02 23:35:19 +0800 <braschen1> @sgremminger @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Yes, it is tell that too the Democrats for the past 4 years, you reap what you sow
1334151733866598401 2020-12-02 23:05:35 +0800 <braschen1> @EmeraldRobinson @dpd176 I guess Bill Barr does not think this is enough of a crime too prosecute.  @FBI
1334149598210908161 2020-12-02 22:57:06 +0800 <braschen1> The People do not believe that the DOJ or FBI will do their job in prosecution of Election Fraud.
1334149167430725632 2020-12-02 22:55:23 +0800 <braschen1> We all know that, Bill Barr hasn't interviewed these witnesses all he has done is make matters worse with his statements that the fraud was not bad enough to overturn the election.  He needs to be reminded his job is to up hold our laws. The crime needs too be prosecuted now.
1334147941087522823 2020-12-02 22:50:31 +0800 <braschen1> Whats not right is the theft of an American election,  by a few Bad actors in GA, PA, MI, AZ, WI, NV, NM, MN, CA.
1334146736726675459 2020-12-02 22:45:43 +0800 <braschen1> That should be enough too get those ballots disqualified.
1334145682446409731 2020-12-02 22:41:32 +0800 <braschen1> @sgremminger @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Not really too many DC agencies have become corrupt,  and act as if they run the government.  This needs too be stopped.
1334139444887220225 2020-12-02 22:16:45 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, that is disgusting and  a big reason the Fraud continues,  no one goes to Prison.
1334138582580260865 2020-12-02 22:13:19 +0800 <braschen1> Donald Trump coat tails
1334137960606945280 2020-12-02 22:10:51 +0800 <braschen1> @RandPaul @abnwarrant Sir, it is not interesting it is Blatant Election Fraud,  and our Justice Department and FBI, say it is not worth pursuing.   I thought our Country was a country of Laws, but apparently only for a few. Sir, it is time for a Special Prosecutor,  our DOJ won't do their job
1334136572787175426 2020-12-02 22:05:20 +0800 <braschen1> The man needs to be identified and questioned.
1334129541846102017 2020-12-02 21:37:24 +0800 <braschen1> It is my opinion that President Trump should appoint a Special Prosecutor this week too investgate, Obamagate,  the Lap tops Biden's &amp; Wieners, with the possibility of including National Election Fraud and Kickback scams by Elected officials state and Federal Our DOJ will do nada
1333815651354497028 2020-12-02 00:50:07 +0800 <braschen1> Alleged election fraud, pitiful.
1333814403528060929 2020-12-02 00:45:09 +0800 <braschen1> They better not say that a fraudulent election is just that, must be overturned.
1333779619816697857 2020-12-01 22:26:56 +0800 <braschen1> They the DOJ &amp; FBI are missing and all of America and the World can see it. They have lost any credibility they had.
1333777985846075393 2020-12-01 22:20:26 +0800 <braschen1> Up too his old tricks, how long will the courts and the people of Georgia put up with these Criminal actions.
1333776093887729673 2020-12-01 22:12:55 +0800 <braschen1> Rand cares
1333772246851198978 2020-12-01 21:57:38 +0800 <braschen1> @CodeMonkeyZ @mimirussom @amartmn The man in the video is Known person,  bring him in for questioning under oath.
1333764379951718400 2020-12-01 21:26:22 +0800 <braschen1> The Government bueracrats are the swamp
1333760949426196480 2020-12-01 21:12:45 +0800 <braschen1> Well all I can say is that is hopeful,  now the MAGA party needs too keep up the good work there and spend a few Bucks to continue too get the word out, we are the Working persons Party.
1333759019140444160 2020-12-01 21:05:04 +0800 <braschen1> Of course  they do, they Cheated too allow Biden a win.
1333758714868850688 2020-12-01 21:03:52 +0800 <braschen1> Thats absolutely what needs too happen
1333482197618188289 2020-12-01 02:45:05 +0800 <braschen1> It happened with the help of Massive election Fraud
1333473745491595266 2020-12-01 02:11:30 +0800 <braschen1> @LLinWood @ForHisGlory52 @BrianKempGA @GaSecofState Perhaps it's time the people across the country who cast their Legal votes, bring a class action suit against these people.  Their fraud (imo) has disenfranchised millions of legal votes.
1333472491398901768 2020-12-01 02:06:31 +0800 <braschen1> @SidneyPowell1  Can the American voters bring a class action suit against Arizona for disenfranchising our legal votes? And is it the least bit winnable? @LLinWood
1333471468248772610 2020-12-01 02:02:27 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud
1333405394245390338 2020-11-30 21:39:54 +0800 <braschen1> This is good News the PA legislators have stood up for the People of America,  this needs to continue in AZ, MI, NV, GA, WI, NM.
1333207533436203009 2020-11-30 08:33:40 +0800 <braschen1> As well he should and someone well outside the DC swamp
1333205163931275267 2020-11-30 08:24:15 +0800 <braschen1> I would agree
1333204999321608192 2020-11-30 08:23:36 +0800 <braschen1> Such nonsense,  its political corruption the county reports too the state election board.
1333200055575207939 2020-11-30 08:03:57 +0800 <braschen1> How can they not preserve the Evidence.  US MARSHALL'S should be sent in too preserve that Evidence.
1333103121241956354 2020-11-30 01:38:46 +0800 <braschen1> @kipCdewonsik Yes it does, sorry to hear that.
1333102679443247105 2020-11-30 01:37:01 +0800 <braschen1> @kipCdewonsik I just lost him last Monday, he was a Great dog, Poncho.
1333053304880951296 2020-11-29 22:20:49 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud
1333052399100043267 2020-11-29 22:17:13 +0800 <braschen1> He should concede now to try and avoid jail.
1333051919942750209 2020-11-29 22:15:19 +0800 <braschen1> Unfortunately they will hide it , delete it, or lose it. Anything too cover up the Democrats fraudulent activity.
1333049345223110656 2020-11-29 22:05:05 +0800 <braschen1> Thats ok they just need too have a change of Heart and keep personal Freedoms first and foremost in every vote they cast. This will take prayers to make happen.
1333045453684928513 2020-11-29 21:49:37 +0800 <braschen1> Thats so sad. In the future the people of Maine need too make better choices on who they elect. Only vote for those that Love our freedoms and liberty.  That leaves out 99% of the Democrats unfortunately.
1333044414852308992 2020-11-29 21:45:29 +0800 <braschen1> @LLinWood @RedDragonFly19 @GaSecofState He needs too be arrested and prosecuted.
1333042758257405952 2020-11-29 21:38:54 +0800 <braschen1> @kipCdewonsik @brad89739161 Why the people of MI ever voted for a Georgia Soros puppet in the first place is amazing.  Vote for our Freedoms always,  they can be stolen so easily,  Don't help politicians take them ever.
1333041845392334849 2020-11-29 21:35:17 +0800 <braschen1> @miken32 @ed_solomon Popular vote counts, even if they are fraudulent? You condone this just because the fraud helped your candidate,  very wrong,  this is a major part of what is wrong with America. People think its ok too cheat if it benefits their ideals God is watching and working it won't stand
1332821141120036865 2020-11-29 06:58:17 +0800 <braschen1> I think Biden should concede now and he may stay out of Prison,  but not Cameltoe.
1332812901292388353 2020-11-29 06:25:32 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, and that is why we still have an America.  If the Democrats succeed in this fraudulent election America will die a slow death.
1332497599732051968 2020-11-28 09:32:39 +0800 <braschen1> There are interstate commerce rules against this type of restrictions
1332363736678592515 2020-11-28 00:40:43 +0800 <braschen1> Who is suspected
1332361350941728768 2020-11-28 00:31:14 +0800 <braschen1> This lady and the guy across from her and possibly the Cop should all be brought in for questioning, there is no excuse for them not being questioned under oath. Our Justice System  is failing up if these people don't answer hard questions about what they/she was doing.  @FBI
1332359618115330059 2020-11-28 00:24:21 +0800 <braschen1> They are a big part of the Democrats Fraudulent and Criminal action plan.
1332328487139553280 2020-11-27 22:20:39 +0800 <braschen1> You Sir are Correct.
1332328251478470657 2020-11-27 22:19:43 +0800 <braschen1> Have faith
1332327122694778882 2020-11-27 22:15:14 +0800 <braschen1> I must disagree,  this country is a great country, can and should/Must run fair elections.  Even 1 fraudulent vote is too many and disenfranchised the voters. We are better that that . Our Constitutional Republic stands because of good and honest people.  Never accept dishonest.
1332322917204566016 2020-11-27 21:58:31 +0800 <braschen1> Good for you, God bless you and your family.
1332320243620966401 2020-11-27 21:47:54 +0800 <braschen1> Foreign Election interference,  with the knowledge and acceptance of many Democrats.  Arrest and try them all in military tribunals.
1332313977917935618 2020-11-27 21:23:00 +0800 <braschen1> It's not over, Biden cheated, Trump Won. Have some faith.
1332132502778077185 2020-11-27 09:21:53 +0800 <braschen1> I hope she does mount a class action suit.
1332131352867639297 2020-11-27 09:17:18 +0800 <braschen1> He does not concede
1332129691549962241 2020-11-27 09:10:42 +0800 <braschen1> Thats true and good people are working to do just that. But proving it and knowing it are 2 very different things, the people know they are trying to steal the elections.
1332129045010649088 2020-11-27 09:08:08 +0800 <braschen1> As any loving father would.  The DOJ&amp; FBI are the true villains in this case and I am sure many others, they should be ashamed and severely disaplend
1332127131439149057 2020-11-27 09:00:32 +0800 <braschen1> I join in your thanks to them fighting for the American people
1332122442840551424 2020-11-27 08:41:54 +0800 <braschen1> That would be foreign election interference,  I believe under an emergency declaration they could be in very big trouble.  Think our President issued an EO, against this type of election interference.
1332118327523766274 2020-11-27 08:25:33 +0800 <braschen1> Tells you a lot about their beliefs
1332078937346879504 2020-11-27 05:49:02 +0800 <braschen1> I don't think that this Warrior Woman is afraid.
1332075374788882434 2020-11-27 05:34:52 +0800 <braschen1> @LoveIsabella72 @JennaEllisEsq Fools Speak
1332075235026276352 2020-11-27 05:34:19 +0800 <braschen1> They are called bureaucrats
1332074571063832576 2020-11-27 05:31:41 +0800 <braschen1> Our Law Enforcement agencies are AOL , maybe they do need too be defended they sure aren't doing the job of enforcing our Election laws.
1332073195382444043 2020-11-27 05:26:13 +0800 <braschen1> The Senate should take action against Judges that abuse their power like Sullivan has, empeach him send a message too those type judges
1331951115181715457 2020-11-26 21:21:06 +0800 <braschen1> The Chief Justice is a disgrace.
1331768827684806656 2020-11-26 09:16:46 +0800 <braschen1> @w_terrence Scumbag
1331766382191587329 2020-11-26 09:07:03 +0800 <braschen1> The PA corrupt Supreme Court will overruled him, and then it must go the the Supreme Court.
1331765537064562691 2020-11-26 09:03:41 +0800 <braschen1> I don't  blame him, our FBI is missing so they won't protect him.
1331761493017292805 2020-11-26 08:47:37 +0800 <braschen1> @AmericanObser11 @JennaEllisEsq Fools Speak
1331760989818261504 2020-11-26 08:45:37 +0800 <braschen1> Name names this needs to be stopped
1331760690810515456 2020-11-26 08:44:26 +0800 <braschen1> And yet he got a billion votes.
1331756043978805248 2020-11-26 08:25:58 +0800 <braschen1> @MAGAPATRIOT_TGM @tcraig57 How do people vote for a guy like that, just amazing.
1331754198166364160 2020-11-26 08:18:38 +0800 <braschen1> If there was a DOJ  they could simply go investigate at the nursing homes,  hospitals  and cemeteries
1331738672023166981 2020-11-26 07:16:56 +0800 <braschen1> Basically only Twiter , Facebok and a few thousand never Trumper don't believe it, Democrats committed massive amounts or Election  Fraud. The Whole World knows it.
1331720661073612800 2020-11-26 06:05:22 +0800 <braschen1> Something needs to be done about Judge Sullivan and other judges like him. He is a disgrace.
1331719488576901126 2020-11-26 06:00:42 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud is a Crime, and election fraud in a federal election is a Federal Crime. Even 1 fraudulent vote, disenfranchised voters across the country.  Cannot be overlooked.
1331718102766194695 2020-11-26 05:55:12 +0800 <braschen1> They must quickly cover up the election crimes they committed.  The people know the truth,  Trump won, by a landslide
1331717547859865606 2020-11-26 05:53:00 +0800 <braschen1> We the People,  know there was massive criminal election fraud, and I believe that these large tech companies assisted in it.
1331716294043983873 2020-11-26 05:48:01 +0800 <braschen1> @RealMattCouch @Nick_Clamorgan Judge Sullivan is a hack and the people know it.
1331712479139913733 2020-11-26 05:32:51 +0800 <braschen1> And it is a crime.
1331705610379911178 2020-11-26 05:05:34 +0800 <braschen1> The Media is indeed the Enemy of the People.
1331705261082480642 2020-11-26 05:04:10 +0800 <braschen1> Good for him
1331704994848968709 2020-11-26 05:03:07 +0800 <braschen1> Criminal intent, election fraud committed by the officials that ran the election. Investigations and arrests must be made.
1331704243330363393 2020-11-26 05:00:08 +0800 <braschen1> The election officials have committed election fraud which is a crime and they should be held accountable,  they should be investigated and prosecuted.
1331694361516666881 2020-11-26 04:20:52 +0800 <braschen1> The Media is in the bag for Biden,  they will not report news that is bad for Biden. The Media is the Enemy of the People.
1331693017053474817 2020-11-26 04:15:31 +0800 <braschen1> Election fraud,  is a crime and must be pursued,  those Election workers and officials must be held responsible,  arrested and prosecuted.  If you committed election fraud you better come forward now and seek a plea deal or be prosecuted.
1331691573432750082 2020-11-26 04:09:47 +0800 <braschen1> They were conveniently lost, it is a criminal conspiracy,  people must be interviewed arrested and prosecuted.
1331580832339914752 2020-11-25 20:49:44 +0800 <braschen1> @carrieksada @farleygirl10666 This needs too be posted daily.  The Governors  should take notice as should all Judges and law enforcement agencies.
1331580049301102593 2020-11-25 20:46:37 +0800 <braschen1> Paul Ryan is the worst of the worst.
1331383118251646976 2020-11-25 07:44:05 +0800 <braschen1> What, she is insane.
1331378480014123009 2020-11-25 07:25:40 +0800 <braschen1> @realTimElkins The FBI should be all over this if in fact they were upholding our laws it seems they are out looking for a noose somewhere.
1331260142411784193 2020-11-24 23:35:26 +0800 <braschen1> Of course they do, anyone who cares too look can see that fraud is everywhere in this election.
1331259809119735810 2020-11-24 23:34:06 +0800 <braschen1> Why is that, it is a requirement,  sounds like the election results are tainted and must be thrown out, New election.
1331255052103782427 2020-11-24 23:15:12 +0800 <braschen1> Thanks as am I
1331239486328541184 2020-11-24 22:13:21 +0800 <braschen1> Let's hope so, but so many judges just want too be legislators from their bench. Keep the faith and say a prayer.
1331227776335175682 2020-11-24 21:26:49 +0800 <braschen1> @JennaEllisEsq @Movanhook Millions of voters across the nation have been disenfranchised,  with all the election fraud that has taken place in various states including non-battleground states.  Any fair minded Judge can see that.
1331220582906671104 2020-11-24 20:58:14 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1331014953629667328 2020-11-24 07:21:08 +0800 <braschen1> President Trump can appoint a Special prosecutor at any time he chooses.
1331010384057282562 2020-11-24 07:02:59 +0800 <braschen1> Good for her.
1331006002951499776 2020-11-24 06:45:34 +0800 <braschen1> @RealSaavedra You're an ass
1330983353261166600 2020-11-24 05:15:34 +0800 <braschen1> Yes
1330980894765703169 2020-11-24 05:05:48 +0800 <braschen1> Well Senator What are you going too do about it,  Our Justice Department is a disgrace.
1330979847317966854 2020-11-24 05:01:38 +0800 <braschen1> Thats part for the corse, if the Democrats take over this country as we know it is lost.
1330979407268356106 2020-11-24 04:59:53 +0800 <braschen1> The Cops don't have masks on either . The cops will do the bidding of these rabid mayors and Governors, against the people watch and see.
1330976845509120004 2020-11-24 04:49:42 +0800 <braschen1> Who do these Governors think they are. The people in their states should stand up and demand they resign are be removed from office.
1330974206117507076 2020-11-24 04:39:13 +0800 <braschen1> Well considering the source,  I don't think many are afraid.
1330951947789197313 2020-11-24 03:10:46 +0800 <braschen1> @kimKBaltimore @GovLarryHogan That fool will never be an acceptable candidate for President.
1330951565524525056 2020-11-24 03:09:15 +0800 <braschen1> I say Never again.
1330948887272681480 2020-11-24 02:58:37 +0800 <braschen1> Of course he is, but we all know there is election fraud aplenty in MI and he wants it covered up.
1330947565622267905 2020-11-24 02:53:22 +0800 <braschen1> Donate too her if you can afford too  she is working for the people.

1330866076494815232 2020-11-23 21:29:33 +0800 <braschen1> I would not vote for Christie, just saying.

1330862738063695873 2020-11-23 21:16:17 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1330861863157030914 2020-11-23 21:12:49 +0800 <braschen1> Yes I intend too.
1330675360976015365 2020-11-23 08:51:43 +0800 <braschen1> @ScottBanks77 @GrimmRoy @BardsFM @chrisphin23 @SidneyPowell1 Fools Speak
1330498171106168833 2020-11-22 21:07:38 +0800 <braschen1> He is a wanted man in the Ukraine,  under indictment.
1330497253744709637 2020-11-22 21:03:59 +0800 <braschen1> We absolutely know that the Democrats have tried too Steal this election through Fraud.
1330300984996880387 2020-11-22 08:04:05 +0800 <braschen1> @LLinWood @WilliamMillen5 @SenLoeffler @sendavidperdue @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA @GaSecofState @Georgia_AG @realDonaldTrump Sir, did a Federal judge in PA just throw out Mayor Rudy's law suit and call it unfounded?
1330300238159081472 2020-11-22 08:01:07 +0800 <braschen1> No I don't
1330188923025362945 2020-11-22 00:38:47 +0800 <braschen1> @Chico_ricothe3 Fools Speak
1330136186791337988 2020-11-21 21:09:14 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct and counting them as new Covid cases in TX.
1330133415291707401 2020-11-21 20:58:13 +0800 <braschen1> Flood of Information About Iran’s Malign Activities Should Prompt More Assertive Policy  https://t.co/lvehnt0jJg
1330120104613392387 2020-11-21 20:05:20 +0800 <braschen1> Well Logan can go too jail with the rest of them.
1330119234286981134 2020-11-21 20:01:52 +0800 <braschen1> @Johnheretohelp No one will vote for Logan on a national scale, just like the guy in MD who gave them a Rain Tax don't recall his name. They are the same types forgettable.
1329908194756489216 2020-11-21 06:03:16 +0800 <braschen1> That would be smart
1329902238396018696 2020-11-21 05:39:36 +0800 <braschen1> Votes for Democrats bring these actions,  sooner or later.
1329882255121117186 2020-11-21 04:20:12 +0800 <braschen1> This is huge, our Justice Department should be all over this, Dominion shutting down and moving,  their people should be interviewed by the FBI ? This is not going away.
1329841573320925186 2020-11-21 01:38:32 +0800 <braschen1> Idiots
1329840745839288325 2020-11-21 01:35:15 +0800 <braschen1> Only the little fish get fried, this is a diversion,  from the mush bigger fish.
1329800011740311559 2020-11-20 22:53:23 +0800 <braschen1> They get closer by the day.
1329798992230813698 2020-11-20 22:49:20 +0800 <braschen1> The entire press Corp is disgusting
1329773253854900233 2020-11-20 21:07:04 +0800 <braschen1> Signatures were not audited many thought too be Fraudulent.
1329482503569219584 2020-11-20 01:51:44 +0800 <braschen1> I knew there was substantial fraud in New Mexico,  the people must demand that they not certify the vote until audited recount is done. #TrumpWon New Mexico
1329467594953400325 2020-11-20 00:52:29 +0800 <braschen1> Perhaps the FBI should question these 3 gentlemen and the Dominion employees there that are being kept from commenting,  by someone.
1329464606838976513 2020-11-20 00:40:37 +0800 <braschen1> Dumb as a rock
1329419630260129792 2020-11-19 21:41:53 +0800 <braschen1> Not very smart of them, wow.
1329419151656456192 2020-11-19 21:39:59 +0800 <braschen1> @YossiGestetner @HuajatollaChic @KarlRove Well @KarlRove is a never Trumper and really does not care if more than half the Country is disenfranchised.
1329203726406602761 2020-11-19 07:23:58 +0800 <braschen1> MAJOR fraud in New York election.
1329201957597302784 2020-11-19 07:16:56 +0800 <braschen1> That Democrats for you, you must do as they instruct or be reprimanded
1329200048891158528 2020-11-19 07:09:21 +0800 <braschen1> Soon the Democrats in America will try to do this same thing.
1329199777003806721 2020-11-19 07:08:16 +0800 <braschen1> LoL, I agree
1329198357651337217 2020-11-19 07:02:38 +0800 <braschen1> He needs too be impeached
1329197449756467205 2020-11-19 06:59:01 +0800 <braschen1> The bureaucracy is out of control in this country needs too be reigned in drastically.
1329193361488666634 2020-11-19 06:42:47 +0800 <braschen1> But you're bombing Joe's friends.
1329188436675338241 2020-11-19 06:23:13 +0800 <braschen1> He and those like him are scum.
1329180588499202049 2020-11-19 05:52:01 +0800 <braschen1> Thats terrible,  the people that fo this sort of thing are just scum. They need to be exposed so the world knows who and what they do.
1329078411139051520 2020-11-18 23:06:00 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  and many in this country are ok with being controlled and  losing their freedom.
1329076470983999489 2020-11-18 22:58:18 +0800 <braschen1> Disgraceful,  threatening these people.
1329073518483435529 2020-11-18 22:46:34 +0800 <braschen1> Continued fraud in Georgia recount
1329073051044962307 2020-11-18 22:44:43 +0800 <braschen1> Their objective has nothing to do with the virus,  they must control the people,  especially now after Trump's landslide victory.
1329071678362710016 2020-11-18 22:39:15 +0800 <braschen1> I totally agree count me in.
1329070307118899201 2020-11-18 22:33:48 +0800 <braschen1> @LeahR77 @common_rick The PA Supreme Court is part of the cover up, they will be overruled,  but the people of PA need too demand they be impeached.  They have knowingly assisted in criminal activity.
1329069673992876032 2020-11-18 22:31:17 +0800 <braschen1> Ignore commonsense assist in the cover up of criminal action.
1329069322984173568 2020-11-18 22:29:54 +0800 <braschen1> They are part of the cover up and deserve impeachment.
1329069128896876544 2020-11-18 22:29:07 +0800 <braschen1> Wilfully ignoring of commonsense and manipulation of the law and their power over it. They deserve impeachment.
1329058286235168771 2020-11-18 21:46:02 +0800 <braschen1> @EmeraldRobinson @jpapp21 Post it.
1329057837318877186 2020-11-18 21:44:15 +0800 <braschen1> @MZHemingway @HuajatollaChic Nothing will happen to him for lying.
1329056800268832768 2020-11-18 21:40:08 +0800 <braschen1> It's all a lie, fraud too control the people,  part of their plan too take away our freedoms.
1329054598913552385 2020-11-18 21:31:23 +0800 <braschen1> That would be another crime.
1329054026319732738 2020-11-18 21:29:07 +0800 <braschen1> They are part of the cover up, the swamp creatures depend on the Justice Department looking the other way. Time for that to stop.
1329053249878564870 2020-11-18 21:26:02 +0800 <braschen1> If they do its committing yet another fraud.
1329053037839740928 2020-11-18 21:25:11 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, we must demand Justice and a change too our Justice system and voting process.
1329050683396460544 2020-11-18 21:15:50 +0800 <braschen1> It is the Fraud,  the Kracken shall overcome it.
1329050010315526144 2020-11-18 21:13:09 +0800 <braschen1> Does Covid spread in Jails?
1328858402680922117 2020-11-18 08:31:46 +0800 <braschen1> Probably all for Biden and other Democrats
1328855325815037957 2020-11-18 08:19:33 +0800 <braschen1> @monabalogna @Bencjacobs Sure you can sue him, go for it. Fool
1328852826051792897 2020-11-18 08:09:37 +0800 <braschen1> @alexis3391 @infoseeker12 @LLinWood Fools Speak
1328852353391484929 2020-11-18 08:07:44 +0800 <braschen1> @alexis3391 @HumphriesPics @LLinWood @SidneyPowell1 @GenFlynn Proof please
1328848990100729856 2020-11-18 07:54:22 +0800 <braschen1> No real law abiding Citizens believe that Joe got that many votes, without fraudulent behavior.
1328848097003380741 2020-11-18 07:50:49 +0800 <braschen1> Yep the people of Georgia deserve better.
1328847780165677056 2020-11-18 07:49:34 +0800 <braschen1> What is this new Banner or whatever at the top of my Twitter feed,  I hate it.
1328835348257009668 2020-11-18 07:00:10 +0800 <braschen1> I am sure he would just like to have fair and legal elections without this type of fraudulent behavior,  wouldn't you?
1328829003373875202 2020-11-18 06:34:57 +0800 <braschen1> Obviously the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is being ridiculous,  vote observers must be close enough to observe how the votes are being counted by being able too see the ballots clearly.  They need to be overruled by the Supreme Court.
1328826071664484357 2020-11-18 06:23:18 +0800 <braschen1> She knows its all BS
1328754361401532418 2020-11-18 01:38:21 +0800 <braschen1> Our Congress is a do nothing bunch of cowards
1328726106665594880 2020-11-17 23:46:05 +0800 <braschen1> I think he should be Prosecuted.
1328725391402541059 2020-11-17 23:43:14 +0800 <braschen1> It appears so.
1328725274796625920 2020-11-17 23:42:46 +0800 <braschen1> @MarshaBlackburn Yes, please do something about it.
1328724344709713921 2020-11-17 23:39:04 +0800 <braschen1> It does not apply to the elite politicians only the (peons) we the people.
1328723818819497984 2020-11-17 23:36:59 +0800 <braschen1> Probably , I would not put it past them
1328723636631560193 2020-11-17 23:36:16 +0800 <braschen1> @MarshaBlackburn Time for Congress to shut them down
1328723190051459072 2020-11-17 23:34:29 +0800 <braschen1> She doesn't believe it, in fact she knows its not true,  and if challenged the truth will come out.
1328719066710880257 2020-11-17 23:18:06 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1328699149819240449 2020-11-17 21:58:58 +0800 <braschen1> @AriFleischer @love_liberty100 Ukraine has issued a warrant for his arrest,  what do they have to say about that?
1328698370597261314 2020-11-17 21:55:52 +0800 <braschen1> Which lawmakers
1328695106837340161 2020-11-17 21:42:54 +0800 <braschen1> They will never vote that in, if they did good chance SCOTUS would say unconstitutional.  We the people need to take elections seriously even small local elections. We Term Limit them.
1328694480673906688 2020-11-17 21:40:24 +0800 <braschen1> Yeah we all believe that. #StopTheSteaI people in VA need to demand an audited hand recount.
1328694151827902464 2020-11-17 21:39:06 +0800 <braschen1> Yes nothing say Fraud like Democrat politicians
1328692159130853377 2020-11-17 21:31:11 +0800 <braschen1> Apparently not, Nancy and accomplices have assured that the money is spread around to the right politicians, so made in the USA means nothing.
1328691667050897410 2020-11-17 21:29:13 +0800 <braschen1> They Cheated and don't want to be caught, everyone knows that most of the world knows it.
1328690759650971648 2020-11-17 21:25:37 +0800 <braschen1> Time for new and honest counters to take over. I say bring in the Military to handle the audit and recount. Exclude the present confused or corrupt recount people.
1328690139556700160 2020-11-17 21:23:09 +0800 <braschen1> Keep the pressure on America demand free and Fair Elections,  we have not received that for many year now. #StopTheSteaI arrest the bad politicians.
1328688631419170817 2020-11-17 21:17:10 +0800 <braschen1> The first thing that needs to be done is prosecute those 936 crimes, the recount with an audit the entire election.  Justice must be done in Our Elections.
1328687750023966725 2020-11-17 21:13:40 +0800 <braschen1> @EdMarkey You people are ridiculous,  first you allow these universities too mandate class requirements that are of little to no value (but must have to obtain degree) these all cost money,  you allow them to overcharge for their services.  Then you say to forgive the debts.  Fools fix it.
1328685958141718528 2020-11-17 21:06:32 +0800 <braschen1> Yep thats pretty sad, but typical politician.
1328685064050323462 2020-11-17 21:02:59 +0800 <braschen1> California as well
1328683564192440320 2020-11-17 20:57:02 +0800 <braschen1> He should be arrested and prosecuted if the allegations of kickbacks and fraud are true. If these politicians don't start getting arrested then the people must take Justice upon our selves.
1328681782917599235 2020-11-17 20:49:57 +0800 <braschen1> It appears we are, the only hope is fair open and honest Elections.
1328502874536620034 2020-11-17 08:59:02 +0800 <braschen1> Where is the DOJ &amp; FBI in this investigation?
1328500536287633408 2020-11-17 08:49:44 +0800 <braschen1> @JudgeJeaninefan I would not doubt it, no one believes anything they have to say.
1328497753052344321 2020-11-17 08:38:41 +0800 <braschen1> Teaching them to make the news
1328497374856097793 2020-11-17 08:37:11 +0800 <braschen1> Pretty obvious,  isn't it. LoL
1328496966859427840 2020-11-17 08:35:33 +0800 <braschen1> The signatures must be verified or the recount is useless.
1328495965246951424 2020-11-17 08:31:35 +0800 <braschen1> @bigd_o_cycler @a_portly_lad @Goal__Diggah Yes and that so much nicer than NYC
1328494318554902528 2020-11-17 08:25:02 +0800 <braschen1> People need too be arrested  for these actions.
1328490496164028418 2020-11-17 08:09:51 +0800 <braschen1> @RichDB214 I would agree
1328489438561898497 2020-11-17 08:05:38 +0800 <braschen1> It's meaningless without a full audit, counting fraudulent votes does nothing.
1328488710921474051 2020-11-17 08:02:45 +0800 <braschen1> Sound like Clark County election results are full of discrepancies and fraudulent behavior.
1328485795087454210 2020-11-17 07:51:10 +0800 <braschen1> The American People won't stand for anything else, we know and they know, who really won the Election.
1328441409477677056 2020-11-17 04:54:47 +0800 <braschen1> Yes he is.
1328441327311335429 2020-11-17 04:54:28 +0800 <braschen1> Unconstitutional
1328438996989480960 2020-11-17 04:45:12 +0800 <braschen1> @SaraCarterDC @crt39437 There are some good judges left.
1328438263372148736 2020-11-17 04:42:17 +0800 <braschen1> She knows its unconstitutional
1328438025114644480 2020-11-17 04:41:21 +0800 <braschen1> Those cops should be ashamed of themselves,  thanks God they are not all like that.
1328436503974866944 2020-11-17 04:35:18 +0800 <braschen1> Not possible without much Fraud
1328436065514897408 2020-11-17 04:33:33 +0800 <braschen1> Correct , it is a district
1328435588068851714 2020-11-17 04:31:39 +0800 <braschen1> @FrankLuntz Fools Speak
1328435138552709120 2020-11-17 04:29:52 +0800 <braschen1> Hell there are no meaningful Public Air Waves anymore.
1328432026530295814 2020-11-17 04:17:30 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1328431503324360704 2020-11-17 04:15:26 +0800 <braschen1> Federal judge has already ruled that these restrictions are unconstitutional
1328428305884864513 2020-11-17 04:02:43 +0800 <braschen1> About time
1328402511032700928 2020-11-17 02:20:13 +0800 <braschen1> Stupid
1328399590048083968 2020-11-17 02:08:37 +0800 <braschen1> @LisaMarieBoothe LoL
1328335958660493312 2020-11-16 21:55:46 +0800 <braschen1> He should not only does America know the elections were Fraudulent,  but the whole World knows it. Those legislators would be commiting suicide if they don't reject the election results.
1328334071567687681 2020-11-16 21:48:16 +0800 <braschen1> Thats small potatoes compared too what our Government is trying to do to a sitting President right now.
1328329840945197056 2020-11-16 21:31:27 +0800 <braschen1> Trust them Yes, but our Justice System  not so much, look what its doing too Lt. General Flynn.  Maybe time too look up the number of your local Militia.  Just saying
1328328402122760193 2020-11-16 21:25:44 +0800 <braschen1> @garyjr61969 @KHerriage Open your eyes and believe what you know to be true. It's okay to not follow blindly.
1328327368650395648 2020-11-16 21:21:38 +0800 <braschen1> @KHerriage This is very telling,  the American people must stand up to this corruption,  call your state representatives and demand they vote too put Donald Trump back in the Presidency for a 2nd term.
1328325231035953157 2020-11-16 21:13:08 +0800 <braschen1> He is Scum
1328323669194575872 2020-11-16 21:06:56 +0800 <braschen1> @chuckwoolery This is so old, just click bait
1328322543862820866 2020-11-16 21:02:28 +0800 <braschen1> Well it's about Time.
1328321972258869248 2020-11-16 21:00:11 +0800 <braschen1> They are both only Self-serving
1328319629866004481 2020-11-16 20:50:53 +0800 <braschen1> @cov_Gretchen Camping World owner does hate Donald Trump and conservatives it would appear.
1328318492823724034 2020-11-16 20:46:22 +0800 <braschen1> @cov_Gretchen Why would Travis tritt trash you?
1328317957987069957 2020-11-16 20:44:14 +0800 <braschen1> Why not he sold our Country too our enemies.
1328316127412441094 2020-11-16 20:36:58 +0800 <braschen1> He is a disgrace too our nation and too the people of the World,  and old bitter man who lies too all and full of deceit.  He should be fired and lose any government pension.  I hope he can live with his lies in his disgraced retirement.
1328314421328875525 2020-11-16 20:30:11 +0800 <braschen1> President Trump is about as official as it gets, Twitter.
1328313718166474753 2020-11-16 20:27:23 +0800 <braschen1> @AnaCabrera All lies
1328094241562763265 2020-11-16 05:55:16 +0800 <braschen1> Wish we could say that for the FBI &amp; DOJ
1328093638065348611 2020-11-16 05:52:52 +0800 <braschen1> @chuckwoolery Unless your in Harris County
1328093360943468544 2020-11-16 05:51:46 +0800 <braschen1> The entire election is corrupted and invalid
1328091361116123141 2020-11-16 05:43:49 +0800 <braschen1> Thats how Democrats roll, anything to defile the Constitution
1328089829930905605 2020-11-16 05:37:44 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1328088381532885002 2020-11-16 05:31:59 +0800 <braschen1> Why would you think they are not giving President Trump a fair count.
1328081691420844032 2020-11-16 05:05:24 +0800 <braschen1> They should not be certified,  they are not verifying the signatures
1328080017729974278 2020-11-16 04:58:45 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1328079593916469249 2020-11-16 04:57:04 +0800 <braschen1> Who would buy it, it's crap, they have no product just payroll.  They will have to give it away.
1328078893102854145 2020-11-16 04:54:17 +0800 <braschen1> Pretty simple,  isn't it.
1328074266034790402 2020-11-16 04:35:54 +0800 <braschen1> @TheDemocrats Fools Speak
1328026022906916871 2020-11-16 01:24:12 +0800 <braschen1> @SandyMikesell @NBC12 Fools Speak
1328025884398399489 2020-11-16 01:23:39 +0800 <braschen1> Very true,  if they even understand why they supported him.
1328010404153454594 2020-11-16 00:22:08 +0800 <braschen1> Tacos in DC, ?
1327970884074745856 2020-11-15 21:45:05 +0800 <braschen1> His whole life is one fraud after another
1327970585754947584 2020-11-15 21:43:54 +0800 <braschen1> Take back our country
1327970383534972928 2020-11-15 21:43:06 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1327966552159891458 2020-11-15 21:27:53 +0800 <braschen1> VA. Demand that your votes be audited.
1327963584148680706 2020-11-15 21:16:05 +0800 <braschen1> Good Question
1327963169575350273 2020-11-15 21:14:26 +0800 <braschen1> Demand the Vote be audited in VA. Put Governor Blackface in his place.
1327959737661534209 2020-11-15 21:00:48 +0800 <braschen1> Wake up Canada,  take too the streets before you totally lose your country.
1327958306447626243 2020-11-15 20:55:07 +0800 <braschen1> I totally agree, the Constitution is valid in all States.
1327957452873150465 2020-11-15 20:51:43 +0800 <braschen1> Its such obvious Fraud.
1327956550284169217 2020-11-15 20:48:08 +0800 <braschen1> You didn't think the Media would release this information before the election,  did you.
1327955606066638849 2020-11-15 20:44:23 +0800 <braschen1> I agree,  does not appear that law abiding people can depend on the DOJ,  or law enforcement to protect them or their property.
1327953133608308736 2020-11-15 20:34:33 +0800 <braschen1> The Media is a total disaster,  they have made themselves unbelievable.
1327949274307506176 2020-11-15 20:19:13 +0800 <braschen1> They are late as usual,  Democrat run city, pure trash and bankrupt

1327947583256469504 2020-11-15 20:12:30 +0800 <braschen1> @laurenboebert Thats why we need national concealed carry laws for those that can legally possess hand gun.
1327946400156557312 2020-11-15 20:07:48 +0800 <braschen1> They won't,  they the Media are the Enemy of the People

1327703826669985802 2020-11-15 04:03:54 +0800 <braschen1> It is the Democrat party and its power people,  know the enemy.
1327703238263640065 2020-11-15 04:01:34 +0800 <braschen1> @towntro How do you think they keep the people of Venezuela in line, most steeple do what they are told even when there is not much to eat.
1327702467841298432 2020-11-15 03:58:30 +0800 <braschen1> @NYGovCuomo Screw you
1327681816116011008 2020-11-15 02:36:26 +0800 <braschen1> First off these Media idiots should know we don't have a democracy,  We Are A Republic, but the truth does not mean much to them. They have started the Brainwashing. Those of us with our eyes open know better than too believe anything they say.
1327677158647541768 2020-11-15 02:17:56 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1327674204288921601 2020-11-15 02:06:11 +0800 <braschen1> Joe won't have a cabinet except for in his kitchen.
1327673820514226176 2020-11-15 02:04:40 +0800 <braschen1> Go for it i personally think its a great idea, but I bet you meet with objections from inside your own party, RINOS
1327614730660319233 2020-11-14 22:09:52 +0800 <braschen1> It is treasonous,  pure and simple.
1327609144803790853 2020-11-14 21:47:40 +0800 <braschen1> So very true this is shameful and reflects terribly on the Georgia Legislators
1327608713058918400 2020-11-14 21:45:57 +0800 <braschen1> The judge that said that is a fool, all of rural Nevada has been disenfranchised by these fraudulent signature results.  How is he even a judge, his name please,  he also said he did not have the time , to ensure Justice.  Shameful.
1327606033431322624 2020-11-14 21:35:18 +0800 <braschen1> CIA, needs too be dismantled,  many thousands fired and some prosecuted.
1327605216037003265 2020-11-14 21:32:03 +0800 <braschen1> So very true.
1327604148469182465 2020-11-14 21:27:49 +0800 <braschen1> @altagracias11 @michellemalkin Gather a few supporters and file suit against the Governor,  these lock downs are unconstitutional
1327602876718395393 2020-11-14 21:22:46 +0800 <braschen1> Then President Trump should fire them both have their clearance removed and have them escorted from the premises.
1327598308697780225 2020-11-14 21:04:37 +0800 <braschen1> I believe they stole the election that gave Obama his 2nd term.
1327597744974950400 2020-11-14 21:02:22 +0800 <braschen1> The American people no matter your party affiliation, must reject the election results and demand verified and audited recounts in any State or jurisdiction that used this Dominion software.  This is an act of War against the American Public.
1327596122198700033 2020-11-14 20:55:55 +0800 <braschen1> About time, this need to be happening all across this Nation,  time for the Judges to stand up for the American people
1327595403634733056 2020-11-14 20:53:04 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1327594323576320007 2020-11-14 20:48:46 +0800 <braschen1> The Democrat party is antiAmerican
1327593904322076675 2020-11-14 20:47:06 +0800 <braschen1> I thought the California Supreme Court put a mussel on this guy, said no more unconstitutional orders?
1327446152267124739 2020-11-14 11:00:00 +0800 <braschen1> Only if it includes and audit with signatures verified. Counting fraudulent ballots does nothing but waste money.
1327437927148826626 2020-11-14 10:27:19 +0800 <braschen1> Yeah well the American people weren't on that call.
1327437548910743552 2020-11-14 10:25:48 +0800 <braschen1> Only to make sure they were Biden votes, the Trump ballots they threw away.  Just saying.
1327432677700620290 2020-11-14 10:06:27 +0800 <braschen1> Then audit the vote and verify the signatures.  What is GA afraid of the truth. Count only legal votes
1327430726392930309 2020-11-14 09:58:42 +0800 <braschen1> It has been the Governors not Covid.
1327427680975908864 2020-11-14 09:46:36 +0800 <braschen1> She needs to be removed from the process by a federal judge.
1327426992493498368 2020-11-14 09:43:52 +0800 <braschen1> Because they committed election fraud,  don't want to be caught.
1327425947608502274 2020-11-14 09:39:42 +0800 <braschen1> @AOC Nancy denied helping the people,  remember
1327424266736898048 2020-11-14 09:33:02 +0800 <braschen1> Good for her, but Biden is not going to be President.  Sorry
1327422076274216960 2020-11-14 09:24:19 +0800 <braschen1> Killed by Israeli agents, thats what's being said
1327420849536831488 2020-11-14 09:19:27 +0800 <braschen1> @AbbyJohnson Where do you live?
1327420600109981696 2020-11-14 09:18:28 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly
1327417205600956419 2020-11-14 09:04:58 +0800 <braschen1> Isn't Doug Collins from GA where another fraud is taking place they refuse to verify signatures on ballots during recount.?
1327416020764659713 2020-11-14 09:00:16 +0800 <braschen1> Yes she is.
1327414923576700929 2020-11-14 08:55:54 +0800 <braschen1> Where is Bill Barr
1327412774767632384 2020-11-14 08:47:22 +0800 <braschen1> @susanville @Mike_Pence Fools Speak
1327409407739785219 2020-11-14 08:33:59 +0800 <braschen1> My thoughts exactly
1327366938453045248 2020-11-14 05:45:14 +0800 <braschen1> Another fraud,  where are the republican state leaders, get involved now before its too late.
1327366630595305477 2020-11-14 05:44:00 +0800 <braschen1> I did too it is much better.
1327366441335730178 2020-11-14 05:43:15 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1327365898555039745 2020-11-14 05:41:06 +0800 <braschen1> Or to Texas
1327365805215002626 2020-11-14 05:40:43 +0800 <braschen1> He is saying noth6about the biggest fraud ever committed against the American people,  I find that hard to believe
1327356577901404160 2020-11-14 05:04:03 +0800 <braschen1> Sir you need too let the observers in closer than 6 feet,  this must happen for the American public too have confidence.  The recount should include an audit and signature comparison. Do this for America,  count only legal votes.
1327354180147818496 2020-11-14 04:54:32 +0800 <braschen1> @BDOH @CplChaskoIV Improbable at best
1327353742723833858 2020-11-14 04:52:47 +0800 <braschen1> All Georgia residents call him now.
1327352244459679744 2020-11-14 04:46:50 +0800 <braschen1> They are certainly not building the confidence of the public in this faux recount
1327350382587219969 2020-11-14 04:39:26 +0800 <braschen1> @RealMattCouch Escort her out of the building have her security clearance removed , and fire her for insubordination.
1327324274034618374 2020-11-14 02:55:42 +0800 <braschen1> Well if your in on the fraud?
1327324146594930689 2020-11-14 02:55:11 +0800 <braschen1> @SecretsBedard @mossback72 @BrentBozell No , their actions are disgraceful,  but election fraud robbed the People and the President of a clear and historical win. He will still win but the fraud us disgusting.
1327323169481428992 2020-11-14 02:51:18 +0800 <braschen1> He should at the minimum lose his job.
1327317976639483905 2020-11-14 02:30:40 +0800 <braschen1> The truth he speaks.
1327317263884709888 2020-11-14 02:27:50 +0800 <braschen1> @IlhanMN Thats the goal of Globalist,  never fall for their trap.
1327317013023363074 2020-11-14 02:26:50 +0800 <braschen1> It is election tampering and is a Crime, his supervisor and his supervisor need to be taken in for questioning  ASAP. This crime is against all the citizens of America.
1327314501717331968 2020-11-14 02:16:52 +0800 <braschen1> This is mire election fraud, the constitution say nothing about excluding pole watchers do to sicknesses
1327311963202990087 2020-11-14 02:06:46 +0800 <braschen1> About time these courts start to stand up to these unconstitutional orders.
1327303448170287105 2020-11-14 01:32:56 +0800 <braschen1> No one
1327303346676506626 2020-11-14 01:32:32 +0800 <braschen1> It needs to be an audit with verification of signatures

1327299406744399872 2020-11-14 01:16:53 +0800 <braschen1> A recount without verified signatures is just a ploy too appear too be doing the right thing. Why won't the Governor of GA do whats right for his people and Americans audit the Vote.
1327297743623233543 2020-11-14 01:10:16 +0800 <braschen1> They must audit the vote and only Legal vote with verified signatures should be counted.  #stopthesteal
1327297112502046726 2020-11-14 01:07:46 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  they had too overplay the Fraud to beat the overwhelming amount of people voting for President Donald Trump,  and Still President Trump.
1327296501148692480 2020-11-14 01:05:20 +0800 <braschen1> China is trying to control the US political system. They are buying politicians
1327295499578306561 2020-11-14 01:01:21 +0800 <braschen1> Twitter is in the tank for Biden, they are bias and corrupt.  Congress needs to remove their 230 protection

1327246923103875086 2020-11-13 21:48:20 +0800 <braschen1> @amandacarpenter Not so, there you are with more faux news
1327245705338085376 2020-11-13 21:43:29 +0800 <braschen1> This is disgusting on behalf of Target, I won't be spending my money there.
1327245295101632512 2020-11-13 21:41:52 +0800 <braschen1> He won't get too , the American people know without a doubt that the Election results showing a Biden win are Fraudulent.  We won't stand for anything but true and fair Elections.  Audit the Vote, in all 50 state if necessary for truth.

1327236974474878978 2020-11-13 21:08:48 +0800 <braschen1> This Covid thing has nothing to do with health, it is all about controlling the people.

1327234362576957441 2020-11-13 20:58:25 +0800 <braschen1> @mcuban Where are your donations going, Sir.
1327233378719068161 2020-11-13 20:54:30 +0800 <braschen1> @RoscoeBDavis1 That is very easy to audit.

1327066404219199490 2020-11-13 09:51:01 +0800 <braschen1> Not just a recount we need audited recount.
1327065940769591297 2020-11-13 09:49:10 +0800 <braschen1> He is going to try to lock down California
1327059864783380482 2020-11-13 09:25:02 +0800 <braschen1> In Texas as well
1327059216675254273 2020-11-13 09:22:27 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1327059116859256832 2020-11-13 09:22:03 +0800 <braschen1> @Diggs2903 @ChuckCallesto It's called Election Fraud
1327052357994102784 2020-11-13 08:55:12 +0800 <braschen1> Let's get them in evidence and properly counted, time is wasting.
1327051828769427456 2020-11-13 08:53:06 +0800 <braschen1> Let's hope so.
1327051484073082881 2020-11-13 08:51:43 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1327051381899808768 2020-11-13 08:51:19 +0800 <braschen1> She needs too be removed from the process,  she is totally biased
1327050800745463808 2020-11-13 08:49:00 +0800 <braschen1> @1776Stonewall These people who commit the crime need to do the time.

1327044084226265088 2020-11-13 08:22:19 +0800 <braschen1> @NYCMayor Lies it's about Control, and it is unconstitutional

1327042484321521666 2020-11-13 08:15:58 +0800 <braschen1> That is a fact
1327041466561155074 2020-11-13 08:11:55 +0800 <braschen1> They will be removed with this type attitude.
1327041044249276416 2020-11-13 08:10:14 +0800 <braschen1> No way
1327040931753758720 2020-11-13 08:09:48 +0800 <braschen1> @JohnCornyn was just reelected in Texas i voted for him but not a big fan, he should understand that many of us think he is on the cusp of being a RINO.
1327040186035924996 2020-11-13 08:06:50 +0800 <braschen1> About time, but they should stop requesting ans start demanding.
1327022804592697344 2020-11-13 06:57:46 +0800 <braschen1> @tedcruz She needs to be removed from the election process before she can do more damage.
1327022210133991424 2020-11-13 06:55:24 +0800 <braschen1> Apparently not.
1326953116240113666 2020-11-13 02:20:51 +0800 <braschen1> Recount and Audit the vote
1326951412295667712 2020-11-13 02:14:04 +0800 <braschen1> @BernardKerik @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump If the evidence is overwhelming then bring it to court and show the world.  Stop talking and do it in court where it counts, right now.
1326950944978989056 2020-11-13 02:12:13 +0800 <braschen1> We could care less
1326950787055034370 2020-11-13 02:11:35 +0800 <braschen1> Of course it is, anyone using a 1/4 of their brain knows that.
1326948767711551488 2020-11-13 02:03:34 +0800 <braschen1> @AgileTator @george_revere @InSideGoDsHed Don't believe anything out of Chicago and or their news media.
1326947948433973248 2020-11-13 02:00:19 +0800 <braschen1> Covid to squash the vote audit/count. Democrats are trying to runout the clock
1326947576575365120 2020-11-13 01:58:50 +0800 <braschen1> The people cannot let them steal these things from our Republic
1326946537851777025 2020-11-13 01:54:42 +0800 <braschen1> This is a massive Crime against the People of the USA and our Constitution.  Why is there no criminal investigation by any Law Enforcement agency.
1326945952322695175 2020-11-13 01:52:23 +0800 <braschen1> Because Twitter is in the bad for Biden, remove their 230 protection.
1326916912895447040 2020-11-12 23:56:59 +0800 <braschen1> It is obvious to all law abiding Citizens that only Legal Votes should be counted.  In all elections if SCOTUS decides anything other than this they are prat of the problem and corrupt.
1326915651374559241 2020-11-12 23:51:58 +0800 <braschen1> They know they just want to destroy the election process entirely.
1326914851487232004 2020-11-12 23:48:48 +0800 <braschen1> Yes it does and it is very evident.
1326914580740775938 2020-11-12 23:47:43 +0800 <braschen1> @KatiePavlich Especially when she has none.
1326914470346694657 2020-11-12 23:47:17 +0800 <braschen1> Their own doing
1326909212413358084 2020-11-12 23:26:23 +0800 <braschen1> @SpeakerPelosi Who cares your both evil losers
1326906879616937995 2020-11-12 23:17:07 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1326905398964662277 2020-11-12 23:11:14 +0800 <braschen1> @1776Stonewall Does this indicate that they may have an agenda.
1326903501935550464 2020-11-12 23:03:42 +0800 <braschen1> Always be aware of those that are appointed,  high likelihood they are Swamp Creatures.
1326889958511161344 2020-11-12 22:09:53 +0800 <braschen1> He only admits it because,  it is so darn obvious too the whole World,  they look like the clowns they are. At least he admitted it.
1326888207074680833 2020-11-12 22:02:55 +0800 <braschen1> He sure showed the Voters of Oklahoma his true colors.
1326887479648145410 2020-11-12 22:00:02 +0800 <braschen1> The corrupt global government can do as they wish.
1326887014164213767 2020-11-12 21:58:11 +0800 <braschen1> No, because Biden won't be President.
1326886536814731264 2020-11-12 21:56:17 +0800 <braschen1> He wrong.
1326885839360700416 2020-11-12 21:53:31 +0800 <braschen1> Thats not the Supreme Courts job they are too interpret the Law in accordance with our Constitution.
1326885500523847681 2020-11-12 21:52:10 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy @MariaBartiromo @TheJusticeDept Sir, where is your Justice Department,  you are still the President appoint a Special prosecutor, America needs Justice.
1326884743489744897 2020-11-12 21:49:09 +0800 <braschen1> @JoshuaHosler @GuyChicago5151 Arizona is too great of a state too allow its reputation too be tainted with fraud, recount and verify the elections only legal votes count.
1326884070220029952 2020-11-12 21:46:29 +0800 <braschen1> Good for him Biden has not won.
1326883516647354371 2020-11-12 21:44:17 +0800 <braschen1> @Marina_Sirtis @realDonaldTrump That should be reason enough for you to never come here.
1326883196257136641 2020-11-12 21:43:00 +0800 <braschen1> Well it would appear he is just another RINO  Romney
1326882999372279808 2020-11-12 21:42:14 +0800 <braschen1> @TheWinterWolf12 @GretchenInOK Sounds like a plan.
1326881608692011008 2020-11-12 21:36:42 +0800 <braschen1> The people of Oklahoma won't stand for a guy like this.

1326868957731696640 2020-11-12 20:46:26 +0800 <braschen1> @Lrihendry @moms4trump1 Any Election worker in any state, that has witnessed Election fraud or irregularities and remains quite is helping the evil in this nation to dismantle this great country. I hope you can live with your corrupt self. Time to step forward for decency and America.

1326580466766532608 2020-11-12 01:40:04 +0800 <braschen1> He won it on election night.
1326577818055086081 2020-11-12 01:29:33 +0800 <braschen1> Good move Law and Order, protect your property.  @GregAbbott_TX
1326573366422147075 2020-11-12 01:11:51 +0800 <braschen1> We need a multi-State ballot audit by hand, we the people cannot Trust Dominion Software counts.
1326571844405760000 2020-11-12 01:05:48 +0800 <braschen1> About time @GregAbbott_TX where is Texas on something like this?
1326568573813264385 2020-11-12 00:52:49 +0800 <braschen1> Thanks God.
1326559000129925123 2020-11-12 00:14:46 +0800 <braschen1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You should urge your father to break up the management of the FBI in his 2nd term.
1326304977250299905 2020-11-11 07:25:22 +0800 <braschen1> I totally agree
1326298836688629763 2020-11-11 07:00:58 +0800 <braschen1> 11 points
1326298738177007620 2020-11-11 07:00:35 +0800 <braschen1> As of 5PM tomorrow Maryland is lockdown

1326291961762902017 2020-11-11 06:33:39 +0800 <braschen1> Not steps backwards,  out and out Fraud.
1326291789314052096 2020-11-11 06:32:58 +0800 <braschen1> She has to resign President Trump won.
1326290402094182401 2020-11-11 06:27:27 +0800 <braschen1> RINO, Governor Hogan of Maryland is locking down the state effective at 5pm tomorrow . He is doing his part too help Biden steal the elections.
1326288600988708864 2020-11-11 06:20:18 +0800 <braschen1> @adpalzcom @Wes_fan Proof that the water marks are real, please.
1326287997793230848 2020-11-11 06:17:54 +0800 <braschen1> This is another State that President Trump won audit the vote, New Mexico
1326287728011481089 2020-11-11 06:16:50 +0800 <braschen1> Yet Trump was stated the loser, such fraud
1326280214096318464 2020-11-11 05:46:58 +0800 <braschen1> Go riddance
1326279854388600846 2020-11-11 05:45:33 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1326278241867489280 2020-11-11 05:39:08 +0800 <braschen1> Recount California Trump probably won it.
1326275476143419401 2020-11-11 05:28:09 +0800 <braschen1> @RepMikeRogers @JoeBiden Forget you.
1326275331620212736 2020-11-11 05:27:34 +0800 <braschen1> Hepl yourself first.
1326274640516427776 2020-11-11 05:24:49 +0800 <braschen1> But Trump lost, something fishy
1326273882219814912 2020-11-11 05:21:49 +0800 <braschen1> If its unconstitutional it is your job.
1326273336545062914 2020-11-11 05:19:39 +0800 <braschen1> Yep
1326272832280666118 2020-11-11 05:17:38 +0800 <braschen1> Recount CALIFORNIA
1326269741871271936 2020-11-11 05:05:22 +0800 <braschen1> This is bid all you fraudsters listen up.
1326268047242440712 2020-11-11 04:58:37 +0800 <braschen1> @CassyWearsHeels Where do they get these people?
1326266676753682434 2020-11-11 04:53:11 +0800 <braschen1> Call
1326263895380652032 2020-11-11 04:42:08 +0800 <braschen1> He so deserves it, fraudulent behavior
1326262592982179844 2020-11-11 04:36:57 +0800 <braschen1> @BernardKerik @FBI Where is the @FBI on this bunch of ballots?
1326262201926213632 2020-11-11 04:35:24 +0800 <braschen1> So what, they won't hold him too account.
1326246049971900423 2020-11-11 03:31:13 +0800 <braschen1> It has been obvious for several years now and Congress does nothing,  to many Politicians get contributions from Big Tec
1326240621233917954 2020-11-11 03:09:39 +0800 <braschen1> Many more too come
1326232323717783557 2020-11-11 02:36:40 +0800 <braschen1> Not many people disputes that there was Election Fraud committed during that time. In my opinion
1326231636393009153 2020-11-11 02:33:56 +0800 <braschen1> There is no glitch, it is election fraud,  plain and simple.  Time to start making arrests , might start at the Software company,  I think its called Dominion but Ask Nancy and Diane.
1326230894131212288 2020-11-11 02:30:59 +0800 <braschen1> Go for it President Trump and the American people can use your expertise and be greatful for it, Sir
1326230132068147207 2020-11-11 02:27:58 +0800 <braschen1> @jjauthor @gatewaypundit Keep up the good work,  it's for America
1326229845307764738 2020-11-11 02:26:49 +0800 <braschen1> PROOF OF FRAUD,  all that ask for proof.
1326229052143833098 2020-11-11 02:23:40 +0800 <braschen1> Magic,  its called Election fraud.
1326228130227490816 2020-11-11 02:20:01 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly
1326224706983309314 2020-11-11 02:06:24 +0800 <braschen1> Then prosecute them.
1326224058850168834 2020-11-11 02:03:50 +0800 <braschen1> They are all in it together.
1326223771619954688 2020-11-11 02:02:41 +0800 <braschen1> Foolish of you he and his people were screaming it all over the place.
1326222928896266242 2020-11-11 01:59:20 +0800 <braschen1> I thought it was illegal too lie too the FBI, oh thats right he can lie too us peons.
1326222066408939520 2020-11-11 01:55:55 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  it just more cover up calling it a glitch.
1326221851555749890 2020-11-11 01:55:04 +0800 <braschen1> I don't recall that.
1326220489111560192 2020-11-11 01:49:39 +0800 <braschen1> &gt;Seems like i do recall that. Humm
1326219149262123013 2020-11-11 01:44:19 +0800 <braschen1> Corrupt Democrats
1326217043163705351 2020-11-11 01:35:57 +0800 <braschen1> Hopefully they won't have the house
1326210013602279431 2020-11-11 01:08:01 +0800 <braschen1> @wingss07 Braschen1 on Parler
1326208819333107713 2020-11-11 01:03:16 +0800 <braschen1> @Stapleton_MT @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Fools Speak
1326208683018227712 2020-11-11 01:02:44 +0800 <braschen1> Yuck
1326207802717728770 2020-11-11 00:59:14 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  but Twitter is falling.
1326207235316461568 2020-11-11 00:56:59 +0800 <braschen1> Such obvious fraud,  do the fraudsters think no one will notice?
1326204683795509248 2020-11-11 00:46:50 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1326204379926589442 2020-11-11 00:45:38 +0800 <braschen1> She is all that is wrong with politicians.
1326203767063240706 2020-11-11 00:43:12 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1326202523145830400 2020-11-11 00:38:15 +0800 <braschen1> If its not it should be
1326202187773603840 2020-11-11 00:36:55 +0800 <braschen1> They will face jail time unless they come forward and make a deal.
1326201790572933121 2020-11-11 00:35:21 +0800 <braschen1> Thats unfair protect Whistleblowers
1326201253244903426 2020-11-11 00:33:13 +0800 <braschen1> Not a glitch, but certainly fraud.
1326200471506329606 2020-11-11 00:30:06 +0800 <braschen1> People need to go too Jail. Not just the peons also the leaders, get some plea deals
1326200096413900802 2020-11-11 00:28:37 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1326199800849698817 2020-11-11 00:27:26 +0800 <braschen1> Now we need property Tax reforms
1326196117034455045 2020-11-11 00:12:48 +0800 <braschen1> Why is Barr doing this?
1326195733196894211 2020-11-11 00:11:16 +0800 <braschen1> He should be prosecuted,  people like him have allowed Election fraud in our country even encourages it.
1326190197864869889 2020-11-10 23:49:17 +0800 <braschen1> He definitely speaks the Truth here.
1326189166879797253 2020-11-10 23:45:11 +0800 <braschen1> They need to make arrests and prosecute,  Prison time is the only thing that might stop the Election Fraud.
1326188197165080579 2020-11-10 23:41:20 +0800 <braschen1> Nor do I the US must demand fair fraud free Elections,  or we are no better than Iran, North Korea.
1326187701612244993 2020-11-10 23:39:22 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1326187506061205505 2020-11-10 23:38:35 +0800 <braschen1> Everyone of those counties needs too be audited, or our Elections are no better than Iran's,  Russia or Syra's.  The USA must have fraud free and fair elections.
1326163190393286662 2020-11-10 22:01:58 +0800 <braschen1> The Democrats are fraudulent from top to bottom.
1326160771395579905 2020-11-10 21:52:21 +0800 <braschen1> Do you condon fraud?
1326160550842290176 2020-11-10 21:51:28 +0800 <braschen1> @PaulaSchultze @MAnayam001 @Quirlygirl @Bubblebathgirl We all can see it.
1326159246157881345 2020-11-10 21:46:17 +0800 <braschen1> Correct and those elites need too be prosecuted and do jail time, enough is enough
1326158660251361281 2020-11-10 21:43:58 +0800 <braschen1> Oh there is no evidence,  you are all crying wolf, says all lying Democrats.
1326158154170830849 2020-11-10 21:41:57 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1326158073308848128 2020-11-10 21:41:38 +0800 <braschen1> Seems a little fishy, don't you think, we need to get too the bottom of this, who directed it, if fraud then Jail time. Our elections need too have integrity not fraud.
1326157513214087168 2020-11-10 21:39:24 +0800 <braschen1> @hmcghee Not Biden, the Democrats stole the elections.
1326156922467315712 2020-11-10 21:37:03 +0800 <braschen1> This could be America under Democrat control.
1326154367045656578 2020-11-10 21:26:54 +0800 <braschen1> Cowards
1325971112480690176 2020-11-10 09:18:43 +0800 <braschen1> She should be throughly questioned by the FBI, lies equal prison time
1325969559791210497 2020-11-10 09:12:33 +0800 <braschen1> I certainly hope so.
1325968475580461056 2020-11-10 09:08:14 +0800 <braschen1> No
1325948348516413440 2020-11-10 07:48:15 +0800 <braschen1> Its just harder to use
1325948192798756864 2020-11-10 07:47:38 +0800 <braschen1> Yes
1325946826961383424 2020-11-10 07:42:13 +0800 <braschen1> The left is corrupt,  they caused the fraud.
1325946418775924738 2020-11-10 07:40:35 +0800 <braschen1> Thank you sir.
1325946253394448385 2020-11-10 07:39:56 +0800 <braschen1> They reap what they sow
1325943045259481088 2020-11-10 07:27:11 +0800 <braschen1> He and his administration are overruling the will of the people through corruption and criminal acts, arrest and prosecute him.
1325935744939069440 2020-11-10 06:58:10 +0800 <braschen1> @GeoffRBennett What a fool, there is evidence
1325933896383533056 2020-11-10 06:50:50 +0800 <braschen1> Fox News has few fans anymore.
1325932281714921473 2020-11-10 06:44:25 +0800 <braschen1> No chance
1325927288693731329 2020-11-10 06:24:34 +0800 <braschen1> More evidence of Fraud
1325927075987992577 2020-11-10 06:23:44 +0800 <braschen1> @SecPompeo Sir, where are those Clinton emails,  you know the ones you were going to release before the election?
1325926798786433025 2020-11-10 06:22:38 +0800 <braschen1> They did it to themselves,  fools
1325925711773913088 2020-11-10 06:18:18 +0800 <braschen1> @DanielNewman @ChanelRion @realDonaldTrump @OANN Never
1325925551144624131 2020-11-10 06:17:40 +0800 <braschen1> Disgusting,  blatant fraud.
1325925172822634497 2020-11-10 06:16:10 +0800 <braschen1> They know the truth,  they know they cheated and there is no ballot integrity on the ballots that came in late or that had the illegal postage time stamps applied.
1325908566197362689 2020-11-10 05:10:11 +0800 <braschen1> @HerbalGoddess @peggyperez @GrannyMenopause @gatewaypundit Me as well
1325905543987417089 2020-11-10 04:58:10 +0800 <braschen1> @SandraSmithFox I won't be watching Fox, your management sucks.
1325901593590501376 2020-11-10 04:42:28 +0800 <braschen1> That is much more realistic and relevant.
1325900796375015431 2020-11-10 04:39:18 +0800 <braschen1> That should be a new law, lol
1325899491480920066 2020-11-10 04:34:07 +0800 <braschen1> That would be great, if she resigned
1325898633783480323 2020-11-10 04:30:42 +0800 <braschen1> Thank you Mr Lin Wood.
1325897872454324227 2020-11-10 04:27:41 +0800 <braschen1> @marklevinshow Where does that put The President in electoral vote total.?
1325897104582193158 2020-11-10 04:24:38 +0800 <braschen1> This is AG Barr's fault he should have moved on Biden just as they would any citizen.
1325896611097178113 2020-11-10 04:22:40 +0800 <braschen1> Happy Birthday
1325895906886119424 2020-11-10 04:19:52 +0800 <braschen1> Glitch not really a software problem,  it was coded
1325893170400518144 2020-11-10 04:09:00 +0800 <braschen1> Good
1325893109922848768 2020-11-10 04:08:45 +0800 <braschen1> Did they cash them?
1325893004306026505 2020-11-10 04:08:20 +0800 <braschen1> If they start getting prosecuted they will come forward for plea deals. @FBI
1325891950671769601 2020-11-10 04:04:09 +0800 <braschen1> @CorporalBen @gatewaypundit I was suspended as well, they made me remove the tweet. No matter I moved to Parler look me up over there same handle
1325575560375005185 2020-11-09 07:06:56 +0800 <braschen1> @Leerose1985 @chbstone2 What are they saying?
1325574827437137920 2020-11-09 07:04:01 +0800 <braschen1> That is for sure, not sure Americans can ever trust the vote that is manipulated by computers
1325514500250931202 2020-11-09 03:04:18 +0800 <braschen1> @Bubblebathgirl What is the DOJ doing with this information?
1325513532012720134 2020-11-09 03:00:27 +0800 <braschen1> Sir, what has his response been?
1325507582170193920 2020-11-09 02:36:48 +0800 <braschen1> @GovAbbott
1325505390025592837 2020-11-09 02:28:06 +0800 <braschen1> Perhaps,  but he is definitely tainted
1325505016178880519 2020-11-09 02:26:37 +0800 <braschen1> It is time for him to move to Parler.
1325504725559734272 2020-11-09 02:25:27 +0800 <braschen1> No way
1325504565249265664 2020-11-09 02:24:49 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please start using Parler as well Twitter is censoring you still.
1325503932911800325 2020-11-09 02:22:18 +0800 <braschen1> They used Hammer &amp; Scorecard it is treason
1325503307729809418 2020-11-09 02:19:49 +0800 <braschen1> He knew they had the Hammer &amp; Scorecard software.
1325503065630371841 2020-11-09 02:18:52 +0800 <braschen1> Willie Brown
1325502944733696002 2020-11-09 02:18:23 +0800 <braschen1> Where is of Justice Department,   @realDonaldTrump @RoscoeBDavis1
1325502649161179136 2020-11-09 02:17:12 +0800 <braschen1> @BernardKerik This has been known since 2017 by the FBI, and also this has been brought to the Attention of the Trump administration,  certainly the DOJ  is now aware. Why has it not been confiscated and or shutdown? @SidneyPowell1  @RandPaul  @SenMikeLee @tedcruz  @GregAbbott_TX
1325429028052996096 2020-11-08 21:24:40 +0800 <braschen1> The Media is the Enemy of the People,  even more evidence of this after your assistance with the the bid steal. You have lost all trust of the people.
1325427681719181313 2020-11-08 21:19:19 +0800 <braschen1> President Trump won California if the votes were hand counted and verified.
1325427410486124544 2020-11-08 21:18:14 +0800 <braschen1> @EvanAKilgore That funny I have heard that same thing from several families
1325426984508387333 2020-11-08 21:16:33 +0800 <braschen1> Yes it truly does, and those denying it are colluding with it.
1325426538909675524 2020-11-08 21:14:46 +0800 <braschen1> @DonaldJTrumpJr But they better not start playing game with the 2A or ammunition.
1325426079092387840 2020-11-08 21:12:57 +0800 <braschen1> @donnacoyle2019 Thats what is being said?
1325424913268805632 2020-11-08 21:08:19 +0800 <braschen1> Canceled
1325424847338528769 2020-11-08 21:08:03 +0800 <braschen1> The country needs too hear these accounts they tell the story, please continue,  the Media has betrayed the people yet again.
1325424291970772993 2020-11-08 21:05:51 +0800 <braschen1> I figured that was coming.  If Tucker and Hannity to a lesser degree weren't so popular they would be gone as well, loot out Jesse Waters.
1325423722103238657 2020-11-08 21:03:35 +0800 <braschen1> Oh I will vote, but doubt I will ever believe the results, our Government has failed us to date. Not just in the elections,  the DOJ,  FBI HAS sat on evidence not acted as they would have if it was you or I and allowed criminal to attempt to steal this election. Disgusting
1325144035548262400 2020-11-08 02:32:12 +0800 <braschen1> @rreactor No he hasn't,  there is blatant and obvious fraud that has taken place, it must be sorted out and the elections verified.
1325143272025624576 2020-11-08 02:29:10 +0800 <braschen1> @FBI if thats of any value
1325142077143998464 2020-11-08 02:24:25 +0800 <braschen1> @BorisJohnson @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You won't even keep your word too your own people, Brexit.  They need to throw you out.
1325141166837260288 2020-11-08 02:20:48 +0800 <braschen1> @MattWhitaker46 @iDaveHasQuesti1 There is no future without  election integrity
1325136264513814530 2020-11-08 02:01:19 +0800 <braschen1> Plain as day and those 3 are know should be arrested at once and prosecuted.
1325136037878910977 2020-11-08 02:00:25 +0800 <braschen1> @mchooyah This has too be investigated by Federal Marshall's,  FBI is not reliable.
1325135437409611783 2020-11-08 01:58:02 +0800 <braschen1> Arrest them and charge them with Election fraud,  prison time.
1325134759874293772 2020-11-08 01:55:21 +0800 <braschen1> Your going to see a lot of MI, PA, NV AZ, VA, WI, poll workers being Charged with Election Fraud felonies, as well.
1325087715008913410 2020-11-07 22:48:24 +0800 <braschen1> Verify every vote, the count cannot be trusted.
1325086766190227456 2020-11-07 22:44:38 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud
1325086400937603074 2020-11-07 22:43:11 +0800 <braschen1> They better get in this fight, the fraud took place in more that just these few disputed states, look at CA, NY NJ and Road Island,  Maryland,  VA.
1325085394225033217 2020-11-07 22:39:11 +0800 <braschen1> @noelinmich @blondjewels @sanuzis @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @RudyGiuliani @GOPChairwoman @LindseyGrahamSC @tedcruz Fools Speak,  it either true or it's not, no matter where it was found.
1325083443949133825 2020-11-07 22:31:26 +0800 <braschen1> If they don't want to do real prison time they better come forward.
1325083226654773248 2020-11-07 22:30:34 +0800 <braschen1> Its one of the arrows in Nancy's quiver.
1325083038611599361 2020-11-07 22:29:49 +0800 <braschen1> Someone needs to go to Jail for contempt
1325082410795618307 2020-11-07 22:27:20 +0800 <braschen1> @HurdOnTheHill If it was legally cast i agree.
1325081820212420608 2020-11-07 22:24:59 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1325081316602339328 2020-11-07 22:22:59 +0800 <braschen1> @DanCrenshawTX Dan she is doing fine she just wants to make sure you're going to fight the good fight, I personally think you will. Stay the course we need to stop the corruption in our elections.
1325080577263996928 2020-11-07 22:20:03 +0800 <braschen1> They are in the bag for the democratic machine.
1325079260420329472 2020-11-07 22:14:49 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  or the American people should never accept the fraudulent results, the house has been flipped and the Senate retained as well, there is huge fraud beyond just Pennsylvania.
1325078481584197635 2020-11-07 22:11:43 +0800 <braschen1> Some have been found in a dumpster,  they are reporting.
1325077853881462784 2020-11-07 22:09:13 +0800 <braschen1> They are still generating vote that will soon be counted for democrat politicians.
1325077419112468480 2020-11-07 22:07:30 +0800 <braschen1> Need them in many more than 4
1325076190126878720 2020-11-07 22:02:37 +0800 <braschen1> Or do hard time in Prison
1325073432195850241 2020-11-07 21:51:39 +0800 <braschen1> @Rifleman4WVU None he won't be President
1325073194584256512 2020-11-07 21:50:42 +0800 <braschen1> Needs to order several other state to do likewise,  including California
1325072888442007555 2020-11-07 21:49:29 +0800 <braschen1> The majority of the states need to be hand counted, the election day results cannot be verified or trusted. The truth is that the republican took the house held the senate and won the Presidency.
1325064684119203840 2020-11-07 21:16:53 +0800 <braschen1> This oder needs to be issued to about 20 more states.
1325053931903471616 2020-11-07 20:34:10 +0800 <braschen1> @C_3C_3 It is one of the arrows in Nancy's quiver.
1325053068040396800 2020-11-07 20:30:44 +0800 <braschen1> As will many, they went to far this time prison time to those who do not come forward with evidence.
1325052102356447233 2020-11-07 20:26:54 +0800 <braschen1> @hodgetwins It's more than glitches, that stole the elections
1325048768341946368 2020-11-07 20:13:39 +0800 <braschen1> No not with out substantial Fraud.
1324844761501650944 2020-11-07 06:43:00 +0800 <braschen1> They must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of our laws, stop the fraud.
1324843041681743881 2020-11-07 06:36:10 +0800 <braschen1> Same is going on in Maryland
1324842717659209729 2020-11-07 06:34:52 +0800 <braschen1> The fraud is always by the lefty
1324842162299817984 2020-11-07 06:32:40 +0800 <braschen1> They must be arrested and prosecuted.
1324841586900017153 2020-11-07 06:30:23 +0800 <braschen1> Is that all, who will be arrested and prosecuted.
1324840637468913664 2020-11-07 06:26:36 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly what are you saying its unclear to me sorry.
1324840105408942087 2020-11-07 06:24:30 +0800 <braschen1> You can kiss this kind of news goodbye under Biden
1324839828672925697 2020-11-07 06:23:24 +0800 <braschen1> Where do you do this contribution?
1324839033432920071 2020-11-07 06:20:14 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1324837094032900099 2020-11-07 06:12:32 +0800 <braschen1> Trump won New Mexico as well. A recount must be demanded.
1324835780678815747 2020-11-07 06:07:19 +0800 <braschen1> Or ever
1324834957496356864 2020-11-07 06:04:02 +0800 <braschen1> If they don't speak up, they will be doing Prison time, better to get a deal and help defeat the fraud than go to prison for covering it up.
1324832583511908358 2020-11-07 05:54:36 +0800 <braschen1> Plain and simple, also the removal of observers is illegal,  those people should be arrested for crimes committed.  That is why the do it no one is ever punished.
1324830695936663554 2020-11-07 05:47:06 +0800 <braschen1> Not just MI, I think California as well some more house seats would be picked up, and possibly A Trump win as well.
1324829944304836610 2020-11-07 05:44:07 +0800 <braschen1> I don't have much faith in at least 4 of the Supreme Court Justices they are totally partisan hacks.
1324823133468184582 2020-11-07 05:17:03 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1324822352031584256 2020-11-07 05:13:57 +0800 <braschen1> Yet he is doing very little.
1324822160062500866 2020-11-07 05:13:11 +0800 <braschen1> We know that the world knows that. Where is Justice?
1324821702082203648 2020-11-07 05:11:22 +0800 <braschen1> @Joe7993 @therealtony25 He is a rino, always was.
1324818757634662405 2020-11-07 04:59:40 +0800 <braschen1> If they arrive on time
1324816579264237573 2020-11-07 04:51:01 +0800 <braschen1> They should their state looks awful corrupt to the country and the World.
1324816325903077377 2020-11-07 04:50:00 +0800 <braschen1> But fully prosecute every other individual that participated,  see that they do Prison time and perhaps it will stop.
1324815791817150467 2020-11-07 04:47:53 +0800 <braschen1> Take a good guess
1324815463696707586 2020-11-07 04:46:35 +0800 <braschen1> I am sure the did , they are know election cheaters, if they don't start doing time for cheating,  it will only get worse.
1324814422230130690 2020-11-07 04:42:26 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1324814210426114050 2020-11-07 04:41:36 +0800 <braschen1> It's  blatantly fraud.
1324813912081137665 2020-11-07 04:40:25 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1324813190291693570 2020-11-07 04:37:33 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  or the country as we have known it is no more.
1324812492430868481 2020-11-07 04:34:46 +0800 <braschen1> Yeah think, it's blatant fraud,  and it is the democratic party.
1324812114045927425 2020-11-07 04:33:16 +0800 <braschen1> If the votes have not been verified who cares what a bunch of politically motivated people Say or Vote, fraud is fraud no matter who calls it otherwise.
1324811488255741953 2020-11-07 04:30:47 +0800 <braschen1> I too agree.
1324811325034422272 2020-11-07 04:30:08 +0800 <braschen1> More blatant Fraud, that the Democrats want to say never happens.
1324809540634857474 2020-11-07 04:23:02 +0800 <braschen1> @Just_Bob_0 @IngrahamAngle Total BS, where have you been.
1324809272732094467 2020-11-07 04:21:59 +0800 <braschen1> Agreed
1324806586058027015 2020-11-07 04:11:18 +0800 <braschen1> Verification of the votes and then a winner. Honest election.
1324806326099333130 2020-11-07 04:10:16 +0800 <braschen1> Sorry Sir with the very Obvious fraud that has been exposed,  we the people do not have to accept the outcome unless it is verified recounts, as we all know President Trump did not lose.
1324805496797319168 2020-11-07 04:06:58 +0800 <braschen1> I agree Mr President declassified everything.
1324804852900388864 2020-11-07 04:04:25 +0800 <braschen1> As well as America
1324804713402040320 2020-11-07 04:03:52 +0800 <braschen1> Finally
1324766569180864515 2020-11-07 01:32:17 +0800 <braschen1> Sure they did, of course.
1324766420517949441 2020-11-07 01:31:42 +0800 <braschen1> It should wind up in a recount and verified votes of at least 20 states including California,  Virginia,  NJ, and all battle ground states
1324765643330211844 2020-11-07 01:28:36 +0800 <braschen1> I won't
1324765580621160448 2020-11-07 01:28:22 +0800 <braschen1> That exactly what was done, no time to change down ballot votes.
1324764788275220481 2020-11-07 01:25:13 +0800 <braschen1> @drdavidsamadi Sir that is the least of your worries,  I am sorry.
1324763858347696129 2020-11-07 01:21:31 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  President Trump just happened to be in office, this is about America's  integrity.
1324763206141808640 2020-11-07 01:18:55 +0800 <braschen1> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Fools Speak
1324762716284899328 2020-11-07 01:16:59 +0800 <braschen1> @ThePackerMan @realDonaldTrump Do you seriously believe that the Democrats did not commit fraud to try and win this election.  You believe that many people legally voted for Joe Biden? Really
1324761272152432640 2020-11-07 01:11:14 +0800 <braschen1> Of course he did.
1324761116329840640 2020-11-07 01:10:37 +0800 <braschen1> @CBSEveningNews Alright stop with the nonsense the world is watching and you're looking very foolish.
1324760725605273600 2020-11-07 01:09:04 +0800 <braschen1> No
1324759897855184898 2020-11-07 01:05:47 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.  The people will rise up.
1324759677125775367 2020-11-07 01:04:54 +0800 <braschen1> @RealMattCouch They knew many Republicans would believe Fox, of course they had to be brought into the Fix.
1324759363060379651 2020-11-07 01:03:39 +0800 <braschen1> We, you should never trust the Media,  they have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they are the Enemy of the People.
1324758978757316613 2020-11-07 01:02:08 +0800 <braschen1> Yes and this may be the beginning signs.
1324758638431490048 2020-11-07 01:00:46 +0800 <braschen1> Sorry but no Government  will want too work with a banana Republic like America is becoming.  The whole World can see the Fraud it as if we are living in ,  Venezuela,  Russia or Nigeria.
1324757569722875905 2020-11-07 00:56:32 +0800 <braschen1> It is called Voter Fraud on a huge scale
1324756465341681664 2020-11-07 00:52:08 +0800 <braschen1> I would rather see the country broken up  than be controlled by Democrats,  they will bring the whole country too rot and disaster.
1324753811244765186 2020-11-07 00:41:35 +0800 <braschen1> Correct yet Congress allowed it, disgusting.
1324753332242698241 2020-11-07 00:39:41 +0800 <braschen1> No not even his supporters believe it. Fraud is obvious,  I will never consider Biden as the winner unless there is a recount with witnesses from all sides.
1324752124501204993 2020-11-07 00:34:53 +0800 <braschen1> This needs to be stopped,  if you can't go vote then you don't deserve representation,  this would of course exclude those that are old or bed ridden a small %
1324711978842148866 2020-11-06 21:55:22 +0800 <braschen1> They don't,  unfortunately they Cheat which the world can easily see, there will be no faith in these elections without a recount.
1324709755437436928 2020-11-06 21:46:32 +0800 <braschen1> Well Sir thats not what is happening,  the whole World can see the Fraud taking place, What are you and the Senate going to do too ensure a honest and legal result? Its already late for your response,  this has been obvious since Late election night or before. The World knows
1324708480750624770 2020-11-06 21:41:28 +0800 <braschen1> @LeonidasOfAZ @13thGenPatriot After this election not many will have any trust in our Government.
1324708031955980295 2020-11-06 21:39:41 +0800 <braschen1> So it seems that our Courts and law enforcement agencies wants to look either.
1324707451929792513 2020-11-06 21:37:23 +0800 <braschen1> Show everything to the people.

1324492798561787910 2020-11-06 07:24:25 +0800 <braschen1> That would be to smart, and they don't really want to catch democrats.
1324485824012906496 2020-11-06 06:56:42 +0800 <braschen1> Thats about it, and its all legit. LOL
1324485470731014144 2020-11-06 06:55:18 +0800 <braschen1> They need to be held accountable for disobedience of the Courts order.
1324484463150145536 2020-11-06 06:51:18 +0800 <braschen1> Some of us are.
1324482146795474947 2020-11-06 06:42:06 +0800 <braschen1> Seems legit
1324481906684166146 2020-11-06 06:41:08 +0800 <braschen1> And the DOJ is absent.
1324481783325405184 2020-11-06 06:40:39 +0800 <braschen1> Also the prettiest,  not that that matters much, just saying.
1324481485773115393 2020-11-06 06:39:28 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly  #CountEveryLegalVote
1324477926058971137 2020-11-06 06:25:19 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  please insist on that Officially.
1324477684311904256 2020-11-06 06:24:22 +0800 <braschen1> Thats true and it is for the best as this country moves forward,  it would benefit all candidates no matter their party.
1324476999616897025 2020-11-06 06:21:38 +0800 <braschen1> I totally agree,  this all needs to stop left or right.  Stop election fraud.  Where is the DOJ
1324476542144126979 2020-11-06 06:19:49 +0800 <braschen1> @Shelby477 @El_Wezeal @tflood47566244 @Jim_Jordan Sure of course,  only Republicans, nice try though
1324476163104845832 2020-11-06 06:18:19 +0800 <braschen1> @tzafinu @ACTBrigitte Well Biden is not mentally capable
1324475721251753984 2020-11-06 06:16:34 +0800 <braschen1> @pnjaban @realDonaldTrump Fox sucks
1324475260209680387 2020-11-06 06:14:44 +0800 <braschen1> This woman needs too be held accountable.
1324474350079270918 2020-11-06 06:11:07 +0800 <braschen1> Is this in fact true? @JohnCornyn @RandPaul @MarshaBlackburn  @senatemajldr  @SenTedCruz  Please give us your comments on this supposed DHS memo
1324472959554199554 2020-11-06 06:05:35 +0800 <braschen1> @tedcruz @SteveScalise
1324472689688514560 2020-11-06 06:04:31 +0800 <braschen1> I will sir, will you put a call into the Justice Department and see if they are interested in these crimes against the American people? Thanks
1324472098832687108 2020-11-06 06:02:10 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  Thank you Senator Cruz, please put a call into the DOJ and see if they have any interest in the crimes being committed,  please.
1324470562182279168 2020-11-06 05:56:04 +0800 <braschen1> @Girlybarb @michellemalkin @ReaganBabe FBI Is absent
1324469443469168642 2020-11-06 05:51:37 +0800 <braschen1> The Justice Department is asleep as is the FBI
1324469048600596480 2020-11-06 05:50:03 +0800 <braschen1> Congress needs too act against Twitter and Facebook for censoring accounts.
1324468264211271681 2020-11-06 05:46:56 +0800 <braschen1> @ezraklein You sir are a fool
1324468027384094722 2020-11-06 05:45:59 +0800 <braschen1> @SenMikeLee Sir should Republican poll watchers be allowed to view what is going on ? Can't see 30 to 50feet away  why do the democrats have watchers much closer.
1324466159161401346 2020-11-06 05:38:34 +0800 <braschen1> @kindafitsteff @crt39437 @POTUS @PressSec @TuckerCarlson @w_terrence @DavidJHarrisJr @TomiLahren You need to demand that your vote be counted it was legally cast, they supplied the sharpie to commit fraud on people.  @DonaldJTrumpJr  @tedcruz
1324465038825054208 2020-11-06 05:34:07 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1324464036508041217 2020-11-06 05:30:08 +0800 <braschen1> @ACTBrigitte Unfortunately he would probably be a bit too old at that time.
1324463757129666560 2020-11-06 05:29:01 +0800 <braschen1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Senator Ted Cruz has voiced his displeasure a few times. @tedcruz
1324444918153138177 2020-11-06 04:14:10 +0800 <braschen1> @ViceChr_Bryant Let's hope so, I have always had much respect for him, but not liking his silence  now.
1324443519805784074 2020-11-06 04:08:36 +0800 <braschen1> @El_Wezeal @tflood47566244 @Jim_Jordan Not if its fraudulent,  Sir.
1324443235406745602 2020-11-06 04:07:28 +0800 <braschen1> @davidmweissman @Jim_Jordan All legal votes, you sir know dam well Joe Biden did not get that many votes legally.
1324442671943921664 2020-11-06 04:05:14 +0800 <braschen1> Sir what are you doing about it, please demand that the DOJ &amp; FBI investigate these blatant crimes against the people of this country.
1324442027984113670 2020-11-06 04:02:41 +0800 <braschen1> I agree.
1324441842092486657 2020-11-06 04:01:56 +0800 <braschen1> @1776Stonewall Obviously they don't have too,  where are the US Marshall's to jail the Sheriff that refuses to follow the Court Order. When will the FBI get involved
1324441236816670721 2020-11-06 03:59:32 +0800 <braschen1> I hope he is not, but I don't see him demanding that the DOJ &amp; FBI get involved and he should.  He is my Senator and our Country is under attack.
1324440327198040065 2020-11-06 03:55:55 +0800 <braschen1> @miles_commodore Sorry but I don't find any of this funny,  our country looks like  a banana Republic
1324439479894089728 2020-11-06 03:52:33 +0800 <braschen1> They are committing a crime by not allowing Republicans to witness and the Must be prosecuted and if found guilty do prison time.  @FBI  @tedcruz
1324435058065838086 2020-11-06 03:34:59 +0800 <braschen1> Correct, and if the Republicans politicians continue to hide and hope this goes away,  they will lose the support of millions of us. They better start demanding answers.  @tedcruz @Jim_Jordan @RandPaul
1324434163110477824 2020-11-06 03:31:25 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  if the people do not act, then our country as we have known it is gone.
1324432719456149513 2020-11-06 03:25:41 +0800 <braschen1> Yes Senator Cruz and where is the DOJ &amp; FBI, why no investigations to obvious criminal voter fraud? @tedcruz  @RandPaul  @senatemajldr
1324432018294349827 2020-11-06 03:22:54 +0800 <braschen1> Very worthless
1324431871770566660 2020-11-06 03:22:19 +0800 <braschen1> This Sir is not Funny, our country is at stake, why is the DOJ &amp; FBI, doing nothing?
1324431595114254338 2020-11-06 03:21:13 +0800 <braschen1> This cannot be allowed to stand if Biden is called the winner it is illegitimate.  Do not comply with the administration regulations.
1324431051658244096 2020-11-06 03:19:04 +0800 <braschen1> @GovSisolak The cheat starts with this guy.
1324429592967479297 2020-11-06 03:13:16 +0800 <braschen1> Where are the US Marshall's?
1324429347298693120 2020-11-06 03:12:17 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  if they steal this one all are illegitimate,  no need to heed their laws or regulations.
1324428216719667200 2020-11-06 03:07:48 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump You need your lawyer on those states like Colorado that have million more votes than registered voters, obviously fraud.
1324409092014804998 2020-11-06 01:51:48 +0800 <braschen1> The people of Pennsylvania need too stand up and Demand free and honest elections.
1324408634705694720 2020-11-06 01:49:59 +0800 <braschen1> @RealJamesWoods They won't face prosecution,  our Justice system is no more
1324408238645923842 2020-11-06 01:48:25 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1324408189077565442 2020-11-06 01:48:13 +0800 <braschen1> Where is the FBI &amp;DOJ
1324407105416237056 2020-11-06 01:43:54 +0800 <braschen1> Their fraud,  but its to late the World can see them cheating.  The Media has damaged themselves badly they better cut their losses and start telling the truth.
1324403888821338112 2020-11-06 01:31:07 +0800 <braschen1> Asleep
1324403824828780544 2020-11-06 01:30:52 +0800 <braschen1> @FMike81 @ligiaelenagv @DetmerSteve @KamVTV Well aren't you a nice guy, even when Trump wins you can still pay more in taxes if you really want too.
1324403293674737665 2020-11-06 01:28:46 +0800 <braschen1> Because our Justice System is on the side of the demorats is that not obvious
1324399954715136002 2020-11-06 01:15:30 +0800 <braschen1> Insane amount of fraud, the votes must be verified.
1324398723179421697 2020-11-06 01:10:36 +0800 <braschen1> Unfortunately I believe they should disqualify the current vote in Colorado,  it is obvious fraud all of The World can see it. Recount and verify every vote in Colorado,  millions voted that are not even registered.  #Coloradovoterfraud
1324397853880602632 2020-11-06 01:07:09 +0800 <braschen1> No way
1324396885029904384 2020-11-06 01:03:18 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1324396525796155392 2020-11-06 01:01:52 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1324396005010395151 2020-11-06 00:59:48 +0800 <braschen1> Fox is part of the election fraud
1324395199758565377 2020-11-06 00:56:36 +0800 <braschen1> The FBI needs to go start questioning these poll workers making counts, lie too the FBI do prison time. Where is the FBI, DOJ
1324394644394958848 2020-11-06 00:54:23 +0800 <braschen1> They are hiding in the same basement as Joe Biden, disgraceful
1324394369319915529 2020-11-06 00:53:18 +0800 <braschen1> The State of Maryland is still counting ballots until the 13th, unAmerican unacceptable. The county of Anne Arundel has not been counted could lean too Republicans.  National Election day in November 3rd Vote need to be cast by then and counted on that day, America has the means
1324393456437989376 2020-11-06 00:49:40 +0800 <braschen1> Well at the very least states like Colorado with obvious over count more votes than registered by more than a million,  must be verified every vote. If not you can never accept the election results,  banana Republic
1324344860627898371 2020-11-05 21:36:34 +0800 <braschen1> @EricTrump The FBI, need to question him and others, lie to them and do time.
1324343894293811201 2020-11-05 21:32:44 +0800 <braschen1> @A10Jim @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi You are if this is allowed too stand
1324342385363591170 2020-11-05 21:26:44 +0800 <braschen1> Sounds like election fraud.  The people of MN need to stand up and demand justice. You're losing your State to Government bueracrats that are above the Law.
1324341804267876352 2020-11-05 21:24:25 +0800 <braschen1> No by the so called FBI , that way if they lie they can be charged with a crime and do prison time.
1324341459106058241 2020-11-05 21:23:03 +0800 <braschen1> It called fraud.
1324340983300055040 2020-11-05 21:21:10 +0800 <braschen1> I don't believe that, it would be too smart and obviously obstruct there cheating.
1324340542705176577 2020-11-05 21:19:25 +0800 <braschen1> Fox is part of the plan to hoodwink the American public.
1324337489402863620 2020-11-05 21:07:17 +0800 <braschen1> Yes they are.
1324337406313639942 2020-11-05 21:06:57 +0800 <braschen1> @DonaldJTrumpJr This is exactly what we knew they would do. These bad actors have to do some serious prison time or it will never stop.
1324336436901011456 2020-11-05 21:03:06 +0800 <braschen1> This is evidence,  where are our so called law enforcement agencies.
1324148560842076165 2020-11-05 08:36:33 +0800 <braschen1> @BreitbartNews @BernardKerik She needs to be prosecuted
1324148332118368257 2020-11-05 08:35:38 +0800 <braschen1> Not watching Fox
1324147850058543105 2020-11-05 08:33:43 +0800 <braschen1> Prosecute those people hold them responsible,  even if you have to sue them in civil court personally
1324147366878978050 2020-11-05 08:31:48 +0800 <braschen1> @DLoesch Why is that wrong,  it is the purpose of poll watchers , there to keep it honest. The Governor is being foolish.
1324145821533802496 2020-11-05 08:25:39 +0800 <braschen1> LoL the FBI investigate democrats.  Yeah right
1324145547272486914 2020-11-05 08:24:34 +0800 <braschen1> Correct,  John Roberts needs to follow our Constitution.
1324144537250500608 2020-11-05 08:20:33 +0800 <braschen1> No it's fraud
1324143672590536704 2020-11-05 08:17:07 +0800 <braschen1> Did he not also take Maine?
1324143453387804673 2020-11-05 08:16:15 +0800 <braschen1> So very true and our politicians on both sides set back and say little, this demand action by congress so that our elections are honest and counted quickly reliably,  Voter ID is a must and up to date voting machines tamper proof. No matter the cost they do not respect tax $ .
1324139748223582208 2020-11-05 08:01:31 +0800 <braschen1> Trump is winning so call the state for President Trump,  NC can not hold up the rest of America just because some bureaucrats don't want to finish counting the legal votes.
1324136844179681281 2020-11-05 07:49:59 +0800 <braschen1> Correct
1324133112272416768 2020-11-05 07:35:09 +0800 <braschen1> If the cheaters are never prosecuted,  they do it again and more join in.
1324132750857805824 2020-11-05 07:33:43 +0800 <braschen1> Democrats really don't care about right or wrong,  just winning by any means.
1324131841759170562 2020-11-05 07:30:06 +0800 <braschen1> Amen
1324131461537107974 2020-11-05 07:28:36 +0800 <braschen1> Should have already been assembled
1324130766935093248 2020-11-05 07:25:50 +0800 <braschen1> @f0realB @E__Strobel @TFredette2 @aricnesbitt @MIGOP The truth,  I guess that maybe foreign to you
1324130018142920704 2020-11-05 07:22:52 +0800 <braschen1> I agree
1324129777004019712 2020-11-05 07:21:54 +0800 <braschen1> North Carolina has said no updates on election until November 12th.  That is disgusting.
1324129321599045634 2020-11-05 07:20:06 +0800 <braschen1> Without fair elections the country is lost.
1324128868446490624 2020-11-05 07:18:18 +0800 <braschen1> Let them refuse under Oath,  lie and do Prison time, the people are tired of cheating politically motivated bureaucrats
1324128145189019648 2020-11-05 07:15:25 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1324128051274387461 2020-11-05 07:15:03 +0800 <braschen1> NC just said they wouldn't update election results until November 12th.
1324123117900488704 2020-11-05 06:55:26 +0800 <braschen1> Let them explain it under Oath,  no lies or prison time.
1324122757093875714 2020-11-05 06:54:00 +0800 <braschen1> It's fraud plain and simple.  Where is the DOJ?
1324122219690270722 2020-11-05 06:51:52 +0800 <braschen1> @devgirl_21 @dallisfl @marklevinshow Fools Speak
1324122069370605569 2020-11-05 06:51:16 +0800 <braschen1> Unfortunately John Roberts does not abide by our Constitution.
1324117676709486592 2020-11-05 06:33:49 +0800 <braschen1> No doubt,  the democrats are going for the big steal, hell Nancy told us so over a week ago.
1324116996183650304 2020-11-05 06:31:07 +0800 <braschen1> @BretBaier I not watch Fox anymore
1324114337934442496 2020-11-05 06:20:33 +0800 <braschen1> @ACTBrigitte What is fraud

1324100408139223043 2020-11-05 05:25:12 +0800 <braschen1> @TomiLahren This cannot be allowed ever again.
1324099039365836806 2020-11-05 05:19:46 +0800 <braschen1> There is fraud that is apparent
1324098319744933893 2020-11-05 05:16:54 +0800 <braschen1> Where did you get that.  https://t.co/rDm8ZvSjJY
1324098116698722306 2020-11-05 05:16:06 +0800 <braschen1> @natnof28 @EricTrump Of course its not correct, look who runs the state.
1324097772979671043 2020-11-05 05:14:44 +0800 <braschen1> Twitter is not allowing this information out
1324096422535405569 2020-11-05 05:09:22 +0800 <braschen1> @houseofmanzan @VaughnHillyard That county shows all counted.
1324095449423351815 2020-11-05 05:05:30 +0800 <braschen1> @VaughnHillyard Which election official exactly ?
1324089007958085632 2020-11-05 04:39:54 +0800 <braschen1> Where is the DOJ or some other honest law enforcement agencies?
1324088692093407232 2020-11-05 04:38:39 +0800 <braschen1> Yet we had no defense in place,  unbelievable.
1324087883356119046 2020-11-05 04:35:26 +0800 <braschen1> Of course they are , the People of WI better stand up and protest this or their votes are worthless.
1324087556921851905 2020-11-05 04:34:08 +0800 <braschen1> They should have already been in place
1324086469301063682 2020-11-05 04:29:49 +0800 <braschen1> Twitter has disabled likes and retweet of @RichardGrenell tweets, @tedcruz
1324085452807221248 2020-11-05 04:25:46 +0800 <braschen1> @GregRubini We need i was going to say the FBI in there, but they would cover up democrat fraud.
1324084973863870470 2020-11-05 04:23:52 +0800 <braschen1> I agree,  who are these people
1324084722893541378 2020-11-05 04:22:52 +0800 <braschen1> They should all now be required too be verified,  the dispel the possibility of fraud, We spend money like its water so verifying each mail in ballot too assure its legal is no big deal.
1324083376123482113 2020-11-05 04:17:31 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1324083279184777216 2020-11-05 04:17:08 +0800 <braschen1> @JoeBiden Every Legal vote.
1324083138130268170 2020-11-05 04:16:35 +0800 <braschen1> We the people do not have too accept the fraudulent results.
1324079884084281345 2020-11-05 04:03:39 +0800 <braschen1> @1776Stonewall Why it was their intended vote, count all legal votes.
1324077506719371270 2020-11-05 03:54:12 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud, the people of WI should not stand for this, they have been bulldozed by politicians and bureaucrats,  that supposedly work for them.
1324076469765767171 2020-11-05 03:50:05 +0800 <braschen1> Its impossible,  and there by warrants the DOJ investigate.
1324076185702322178 2020-11-05 03:48:57 +0800 <braschen1> No
1324075976641445888 2020-11-05 03:48:07 +0800 <braschen1> Fox News was part of the fraudulent plan they called several potential Trump states early to diminish the turn out for Republicans. That is my opinion.
1324075124405030912 2020-11-05 03:44:44 +0800 <braschen1> The fraud by government officials is out of control and our Law enforcement agencies have done nothing. Its time the people put an end to this corruption.  Several State governments are acting as dictators and forsaken the will of their Citizens. Remove them.
1324065499395796993 2020-11-05 03:06:29 +0800 <braschen1> @CharminUltra17 If they do not do jail time , then no future election can be credible.  So the American people should no longer look to the government as legitimate.
1324064979486707713 2020-11-05 03:04:25 +0800 <braschen1> @RichardGrenell GOP lawyers need to be all over this.
1324064531233079298 2020-11-05 03:02:38 +0800 <braschen1> Sound fraudulent,  to me but I am sure that the DOJ and the Supreme Court are  fine with it.
1324064089707077633 2020-11-05 03:00:53 +0800 <braschen1> @ttocs35 @Trey_VonDinkis Bureaucrats I this country are out of control
1324062927280889857 2020-11-05 02:56:16 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump Probably more ballots than registered voters, This is blatant fraud.  Never Concede
1324062297388687363 2020-11-05 02:53:46 +0800 <braschen1> @jamesplake721 @theamericanmom_ @RealRLimbaugh All votes must be verified,  the fraudulent WI election is obvious.  Where is the DOJ
1324036103544967168 2020-11-05 01:09:41 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump @ouchinagirl Sir where is our Justice Department?

1324034589313126401 2020-11-05 01:03:40 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  even a fraudulent President.
1324034335054417921 2020-11-05 01:02:39 +0800 <braschen1> @RichardGrenell What is the President going to do about this blatant fraud,  where is the Justice Department
1324033715924803592 2020-11-05 01:00:11 +0800 <braschen1> @RightWingJewess They called state long before the polls closed those that would depress Trump turn out
1323997818059710470 2020-11-04 22:37:33 +0800 <braschen1> Yes, but this won't continue,  with fraud throughout the government,  the working people will not stand by and lose their Freedom.
1323994108080345088 2020-11-04 22:22:48 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud
1323992630678720513 2020-11-04 22:16:56 +0800 <braschen1> @EmeraldRobinson @adnavnworb It's Fraud,  pure and simple.  The result must be contested,  and each vote verified.
1323991716987342848 2020-11-04 22:13:18 +0800 <braschen1> Fraud
1323991369564782594 2020-11-04 22:11:55 +0800 <braschen1> @TomFitton Had the DOJ done their job and prosecuted those people they have the evidence on, this would not be happening now. The DOJ is at fault,  do your job.
1323990831393574913 2020-11-04 22:09:47 +0800 <braschen1> @marcorubio Votes must be verified,  by contacting the person who cast the vote
1323988865024172037 2020-11-04 22:01:58 +0800 <braschen1> It is obvious Fraud
1323988514300694530 2020-11-04 22:00:34 +0800 <braschen1> Praise God
1323981515248836608 2020-11-04 21:32:46 +0800 <braschen1> Every single ballot must be verified by calling the person who cast it and confirm their vote.
1323977710805389314 2020-11-04 21:17:39 +0800 <braschen1> Yes disgraceful,  but those state have democrats as governors
1323977405892091904 2020-11-04 21:16:26 +0800 <braschen1> They will try to cheat, that what democrats do, President Trump has won reelection,  they won't call it.
1323976255646158848 2020-11-04 21:11:52 +0800 <braschen1> I am hoping so

1322279343553433601 2020-10-31 04:48:56 +0800 <braschen1> Rules matter, or use to.
1322279167442980864 2020-10-31 04:48:14 +0800 <braschen1> How could the Supreme Court allow this? Unless of course they are legislating from the bench.
1322276842582192128 2020-10-31 04:39:00 +0800 <braschen1> Democrat fraud at work,  these scumbags are determined to cheat their way to a win.
1322275513575100416 2020-10-31 04:33:43 +0800 <braschen1> They will wait until the vote is counted in those states then mail in whatever the short fall is, Biden wins. The Supreme Court canceled all the rules.  Trump team better have about a million more votes.

1322142244112080896 2020-10-30 19:44:09 +0800 <braschen1> @marcorubio Senator Rubio, What do you make of Speaker Pelosi's statement  that Joe Biden will be sworn in as President regardless of the final vote count? That is a very threatening statement.  @Jim_Jordan  @CBS_Herridge  @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods
1322140159572365314 2020-10-30 19:35:52 +0800 <braschen1> She does not care about those people, and like Al Green of Texas says , there's nothing They can do about it.
1321963302038089731 2020-10-30 07:53:06 +0800 <braschen1> He is a disgrace
1321959198775758849 2020-10-30 07:36:48 +0800 <braschen1> Good Question

1321954897160556545 2020-10-30 07:19:42 +0800 <braschen1> Joe Biden needs to withdraw from the race for the good of the Country.
1321954388517310464 2020-10-30 07:17:41 +0800 <braschen1> About time, the wolves are killing all the Elk and starting on cattle.

1321950850944782337 2020-10-30 07:03:38 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1321950191642169344 2020-10-30 07:01:00 +0800 <braschen1> This should have been public long ago, before Joe won the nomination.
1321945033264844800 2020-10-30 06:40:31 +0800 <braschen1> And please include California in that.  Amen
1321913824912572421 2020-10-30 04:36:30 +0800 <braschen1> They are The Enemy of the People
1321910298593402880 2020-10-30 04:22:29 +0800 <braschen1> They would be fools not to have made copies before sending.
1321895681578225664 2020-10-30 03:24:24 +0800 <braschen1> Absolutely ridiculous
1321889339652087815 2020-10-30 02:59:12 +0800 <braschen1> No
1321888945400143872 2020-10-30 02:57:38 +0800 <braschen1> Then insist that the DOJ do their job.
1321888438107426821 2020-10-30 02:55:37 +0800 <braschen1> @GovAbbott
1321885384436027394 2020-10-30 02:43:29 +0800 <braschen1> Yes I can't believe she did that too the American people.  I certainly hope she is not another Roberts
1321878617559834627 2020-10-30 02:16:36 +0800 <braschen1> All he has to do is flip California
1321877092963962880 2020-10-30 02:10:32 +0800 <braschen1> Certainly would not be anything by today's standards
1321876334252052480 2020-10-30 02:07:32 +0800 <braschen1> Congress allows Twitter and Facebook,  Google to continue too do these things.

1321812993252970496 2020-10-29 21:55:50 +0800 <braschen1> No doubt,  perhaps it's time to change your hiring process.  Become you know more fair &amp; balanced?
1321812041947062272 2020-10-29 21:52:03 +0800 <braschen1> The Supreme Court is allowing it.

1321599649451593741 2020-10-29 07:48:05 +0800 <braschen1> They should all be fired, there are plenty of good hard working people too take their places.
1321598645284851712 2020-10-29 07:44:05 +0800 <braschen1> Or just about anything they tell you
1321595529076330496 2020-10-29 07:31:42 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  that is how sad our FBI has become.  Needs a complete do over.
1321594036541706241 2020-10-29 07:25:46 +0800 <braschen1> Give'em Hell

1319613223704854530 2020-10-23 20:14:44 +0800 <braschen1> A Biden administration would certainly hamstring the oil industry and drive of all fuel prices thousands of great paying jobs would start disappearing as soon as he took office.
1319610122151362560 2020-10-23 20:02:24 +0800 <braschen1> I am certainly with President Trump and a good economy.

1319425177327964162 2020-10-23 07:47:30 +0800 <braschen1> You really think the DOJ will do anything to harm the Democrat party members?
1319424666377781248 2020-10-23 07:45:28 +0800 <braschen1> He should be, but you are placing a large amount of confidence in a very swampy DOJ.

1319418678711115776 2020-10-23 07:21:41 +0800 <braschen1> Its not just the Biden's who are corrupt and most definitely jail worthy.

1317842905608949760 2020-10-18 23:00:07 +0800 <braschen1> @SharylAttkisson @GPAWALTON The FBI needs to be dismantled. It no longer serves it purpose,  just it's self.
1317805068192808961 2020-10-18 20:29:46 +0800 <braschen1> @ChuckGrassley I am not for the green new deal, but I am not for ethanol in the least, it is another government funded boondoggle,  without the government propping it up it would be history in 1 year or so. Let it die.
1317803994618728448 2020-10-18 20:25:30 +0800 <braschen1> @DanRather @coolthetoad Then you and your other media bud's should start practicing those attributes.

1317574367757410306 2020-10-18 05:13:03 +0800 <braschen1> Yes a bit more important than faux noose in Bubba Wallace garage.
1317570364382248961 2020-10-18 04:57:08 +0800 <braschen1> Has he released any yet?

1317459683972702213 2020-10-17 21:37:20 +0800 <braschen1> That is the way our founding fathers meant this government to be ran by citizens not life long politicians.
1317456314763759617 2020-10-17 21:23:57 +0800 <braschen1> His son did not do it, he did he is corrupt  he made those decisions not his son. He just thought it would never be exposed,  swamp cover up.
1317455862005403650 2020-10-17 21:22:09 +0800 <braschen1> The FBI is in cover up mode again and still.
1317454158178471936 2020-10-17 21:15:23 +0800 <braschen1> Too late for that he is toast and should resign Today

1316484208953618433 2020-10-15 05:01:09 +0800 <braschen1> @dbongino Parler is difficult to use after being on Twitter.
1316483769893875713 2020-10-15 04:59:24 +0800 <braschen1> These tech companies need too be held responsible.

1316014309957275656 2020-10-13 21:53:56 +0800 <braschen1> The corruption started , when the constitution was amended to allow the people to vote for their Senator's,  prior to this disaster,  Senator's were appointed by their State representatives.  And removed by them or the Governor.
1316010763975229443 2020-10-13 21:39:51 +0800 <braschen1> @jsolomonReports Oh Well.  Who cares.
1316010186113507328 2020-10-13 21:37:33 +0800 <braschen1> The only time I want to hear of a General refusing orders from the CIC, is when he tells them too fire on American Citizens protecting the Constitution.

1315639199513686017 2020-10-12 21:03:23 +0800 <braschen1> The truth needs too come out in the open for all to see, Democrats and Republicans knew .

1315438907266404352 2020-10-12 07:47:29 +0800 <braschen1> She should not agree to recuse herself from any case involving Obamacare, ObamaGate, or Democrat voter fraud.
1315437853434884097 2020-10-12 07:43:18 +0800 <braschen1> @SenSchumer Why should she, what about Keegan and Sotomayor,  they are biased towards Obamacare himself.
1315387557060980736 2020-10-12 04:23:26 +0800 <braschen1> @RichardGrenell After President Trump wins and Republicans have the house and Senate,  we must pass Federal election mandatory ID requirements.  All federal elections.

1315269202270453760 2020-10-11 20:33:08 +0800 <braschen1> He is a proven lier
1315053677414158338 2020-10-11 06:16:43 +0800 <braschen1> Looks like Buzzards waiting for something to die, so they can eat with no effort.

1313839933061296128 2020-10-07 21:53:44 +0800 <braschen1> @C_3C_3 No bureaucrats should be paid this kind of money working for our government and on top of that salary look at the benefit package they receive best in the world.   This is outrageous and a fleecing of American Tax payers. @realDonaldTrump  @tedcruz  @TuckerCarlson

1311459098328739840 2020-10-01 08:13:09 +0800 <braschen1> @MarshaBlackburn And what will you do about it? Nothing
1311364694154903553 2020-10-01 01:58:01 +0800 <braschen1> Well look at the FBI, hardly a citizen of this country has any confidence in their abilities to be honest , non-political or Just.
1311277104873574400 2020-09-30 20:09:58 +0800 <braschen1> Chris Wallace is a big mistake,  should never have been allowed to moderate.
1311275476720267265 2020-09-30 20:03:30 +0800 <braschen1> @kilmeade @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Your guy Wallace is a disgrace to honest Media,  if we had one.
1311274953187172353 2020-09-30 20:01:25 +0800 <braschen1> @kilmeade Now what do you think?

1311096557706579969 2020-09-30 08:12:33 +0800 <braschen1> @JamesGRickards They still won't believe you.
1311094991004086273 2020-09-30 08:06:19 +0800 <braschen1> @Father4Change @pesachlattin @AlexanderKaty The same could be said of that fool who is running Canada, but i am not campaigning for or against him, as i cannot vote in Canada.
1311061408000487425 2020-09-30 05:52:52 +0800 <braschen1> @Father4Change @pesachlattin @AlexanderKaty You sir have no dog in the fight, your a Canadian,  please watch after your own country.

1310918851505393664 2020-09-29 20:26:24 +0800 <braschen1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Was she arrested and prosecuted?
1310918140067483648 2020-09-29 20:23:34 +0800 <braschen1> They are old forgotten new, during Obama's rein of destruction
1310917639607406592 2020-09-29 20:21:35 +0800 <braschen1> I agree
1310916320083480576 2020-09-29 20:16:21 +0800 <braschen1> The IG needs to speak plain honest truth about  this, or resign as a dishonest coward.
1310909978614603776 2020-09-29 19:51:09 +0800 <braschen1> @MinneapolisPD Sure you are, it is a Federal crime the do nothing FBI would normally be all over it but the upper management i am sure has given Stand Down notice .
1310909450342014976 2020-09-29 19:49:03 +0800 <braschen1> @1776Stonewall The actual cause of the Civil War.
1310907648888504320 2020-09-29 19:41:53 +0800 <braschen1> @ColSDM He was already cooperative.
1310906801559400449 2020-09-29 19:38:31 +0800 <braschen1> No he's had enough of her.
1310906068873220097 2020-09-29 19:35:36 +0800 <braschen1> So would the American public.
1310905901084282880 2020-09-29 19:34:56 +0800 <braschen1> @NYGovCuomo The Law , the the legislate pass it and then you signed it?
1310693794803789830 2020-09-29 05:32:06 +0800 <braschen1> @esaagar Tough
1310693490452553730 2020-09-29 05:30:54 +0800 <braschen1> @amyklobuchar You wrote the law, he just followed them.
1310644885867892736 2020-09-29 02:17:46 +0800 <braschen1> They probably won't be the FBI has lost its way. Needs to be dismantled and reorganized especially the 7th floor.
1310644231904649219 2020-09-29 02:15:10 +0800 <braschen1> The FBI under the last 2 and current directors is corrupt and useless.
1310642654112346112 2020-09-29 02:08:53 +0800 <braschen1> You mean like when you vote for democrats that are going to raise your Taxes.
1310642207372832770 2020-09-29 02:07:07 +0800 <braschen1> I agree, but nothing will happen and there will be no real investigation.  Most of our Government is corrupt throughout the bueracracites
1310604735624425473 2020-09-28 23:38:13 +0800 <braschen1> Most Billionaires do.
1310603002370240513 2020-09-28 23:31:20 +0800 <braschen1> This illegal practice must be stopped at once, or our elections are just fraudulent untrustworthy
1310602504841945089 2020-09-28 23:29:21 +0800 <braschen1> The DOJ, should first stop this practice Now and prosecute all involved in every state. If nothing is done no one can have confidence in our elections,  period.  @GovAbbott ,@govkristinoem  @realDonaldTrump
1310590238469824514 2020-09-28 22:40:37 +0800 <braschen1> @superbucks2050 @JoeBiden He would not remain President long if elected,  he would be removed and it would be Kamala.
1310589866355425285 2020-09-28 22:39:08 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1310589344252604426 2020-09-28 22:37:03 +0800 <braschen1> @ewarren You have cheated the public your whole working life, indian what a crock. You're a cheater, President Trump abides by our nation's Tax laws, do you.
1310575513572913152 2020-09-28 21:42:06 +0800 <braschen1> No
1310573592703311873 2020-09-28 21:34:28 +0800 <braschen1> One of the most corrupt.
1310573095183413248 2020-09-28 21:32:29 +0800 <braschen1> Fire the corrupt top cop. He is the swamp protection.
1310572650201329666 2020-09-28 21:30:43 +0800 <braschen1> @SpeakerPelosi Let's see yours and Schumer Tax returns for the last 10 years, then have this discussion.
1310354382861545472 2020-09-28 07:03:24 +0800 <braschen1> 1 or 4
1310353289108770817 2020-09-28 06:59:03 +0800 <braschen1> Matters not too me.
1310353173513633794 2020-09-28 06:58:36 +0800 <braschen1> Typical bueracrats
1310351942057709569 2020-09-28 06:53:42 +0800 <braschen1> The rock is just another Court Jester, and not much of an actor.
1310351529778569217 2020-09-28 06:52:04 +0800 <braschen1> @ellllljayy Who Cares

1310248810443141121 2020-09-28 00:03:54 +0800 <braschen1> Seems every where in the world you turn the Turks are looking for War, what are they drinking,  they need to stop think of peace.
1310243359492116485 2020-09-27 23:42:14 +0800 <braschen1> I sure hope so, as you may recall only democrats voted for it, not a single Republican.
1310241112569901057 2020-09-27 23:33:18 +0800 <braschen1> Germany has to pay their share as they agreed to do, only fair.
1310239445375877122 2020-09-27 23:26:41 +0800 <braschen1> I knew the cowards would not do it, they will be big do nothings also, I afraid
1310199709617860608 2020-09-27 20:48:47 +0800 <braschen1> @KurtSchlichter @townhallcom Tried to read it but it just won't open, this is the second time you're articles will not open for me.

1310181988352045057 2020-09-27 19:38:22 +0800 <braschen1> @SenBlumenthal No, The President nominates and the Senate confirms or deny the nominaie.  Get with the program,  how long have you been in Congress and still you don't understand.
1309960780566147072 2020-09-27 04:59:22 +0800 <braschen1> On what grounds would she do that. She would be foolish to agree too any of their wishes.
1309959925846736896 2020-09-27 04:55:58 +0800 <braschen1> @ewarren What a cry baby,  she should have retired when you're prince Obama was in office.
1309910194902781953 2020-09-27 01:38:22 +0800 <braschen1> American tax payers should never have to fund that, it should be on them if they bought it.
1309874556870553600 2020-09-26 23:16:45 +0800 <braschen1> @KerriKupecDOJ Then get some work done have some arrests made.

1309831217714470916 2020-09-26 20:24:32 +0800 <braschen1> They are just going to investigate,  never  prosecute. Arrest someone already or stop all these surades.
1309827696965439488 2020-09-26 20:10:33 +0800 <braschen1> All of them dishonest, corrupt, disgusting people.
1309826486468259840 2020-09-26 20:05:44 +0800 <braschen1> Don't leave out the DOJ they are a corrupt part of this as well.
1309647863249612800 2020-09-26 08:15:57 +0800 <braschen1> And he dam sure ain't No Cowboy.
1309642205108285442 2020-09-26 07:53:28 +0800 <braschen1> No
1309640757339455490 2020-09-26 07:47:43 +0800 <braschen1> The Speaker of the House cannot be relied on to tell the truth to the American public,  this is a crying shame,  she will be replaced after the elections.
1309638393941446656 2020-09-26 07:38:19 +0800 <braschen1> As should the Governor of Texas @GovAbbott
1309638141700169728 2020-09-26 07:37:19 +0800 <braschen1> A Kamala presidency
1309606879459450880 2020-09-26 05:33:06 +0800 <braschen1> There is always another option
1309605158289133568 2020-09-26 05:26:15 +0800 <braschen1> @GovAbbott

1309487069698416640 2020-09-25 21:37:01 +0800 <braschen1> This is proof positive for all doubters,  the FBI and DC district Court are corrupt.  The FBI from top down should be dismantled and done away with at the very least anyones name that appears near this case should be fired and never allowed to hold public office. Corruption
1309267977418805248 2020-09-25 07:06:25 +0800 <braschen1> disgusting the woman should sue the crap out of the city and the police department
1309266880906104833 2020-09-25 07:02:04 +0800 <braschen1> Almost the same agenda
1309265738541281280 2020-09-25 06:57:31 +0800 <braschen1> Democrats and dumb GOP Governors want to control our lives.
1309265108103827457 2020-09-25 06:55:01 +0800 <braschen1> That's some funny sh_t

1308748616673169409 2020-09-23 20:42:40 +0800 <braschen1> President Trump should meet with Lagoa, Barrett seems to green light Government imposed lockdown and has ruled against 1st and 4th amendment.
1308491781387026432 2020-09-23 03:42:05 +0800 <braschen1> That is Election interference and needs to be investigated.
1308489361751707650 2020-09-23 03:32:29 +0800 <braschen1> That guy should have turned his dog out on those punks. Truth is the Justice department should have their way with those disgusting punks.

1308397719279546371 2020-09-22 21:28:19 +0800 <braschen1> @ChuckCallesto They will make up wrongdoing just to get him. They are dirty to the bone, these type of prosecutors should be hounded by federal prosecutors until they are put out of any capacity to manipulate law enforcement on citizens.  They are the worst type of Criminal.
1308392661125128192 2020-09-22 21:08:13 +0800 <braschen1> @RyanAFournier News Media are deceitful,  enemy of the people.
1308391106703482886 2020-09-22 21:02:03 +0800 <braschen1> Justice Roberts needs to do the honorable thing and Resign.
1308389844364734466 2020-09-22 20:57:02 +0800 <braschen1> It is not lawful,  must go before the Supreme Court with 9 Justices
1308389236752744448 2020-09-22 20:54:37 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1308388730995175429 2020-09-22 20:52:36 +0800 <braschen1> @JohnBenCawley1 Must be a big ranch?

1308060200377745409 2020-09-21 23:07:09 +0800 <braschen1> @Barnes_Law Sounds, like Rushing would be a good choice 38 years old be on the court a long time and clerk's for Thomas I believe.
1308057171704381441 2020-09-21 22:55:06 +0800 <braschen1> @Barnes_Law @BlackJackBoGre1 Why look what we got when Bush picked Roberts,  now Bush and Rubio is pushing Lagoa?

1307295665911988224 2020-09-19 20:29:09 +0800 <braschen1> She is being foolish it is not the same circumstance.  If she opens her eyes even she can see that. The people of Alaska should show her their displeasure.
1307153393014706176 2020-09-19 11:03:49 +0800 <braschen1> @MAJMO50 @ColSDM She is a complete fool if she takes that stand, Mitch McConnell should fry her in everyway he can and any other Republican Senator that acts like this. Take away every perk they have for the remainder of their term.

1304763044531245057 2020-09-12 20:45:25 +0800 <braschen1> Too be expected when you have the Obama admin running the thing. They have never done anything right and certainly know nothing of making money in a business environment.

1304587183148462081 2020-09-12 09:06:37 +0800 <braschen1> Nothing accidental about it, and the American people know that. It was intentional and criminal.
1304586287580614656 2020-09-12 09:03:03 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.

1304489275904360448 2020-09-12 02:37:34 +0800 <braschen1> Everyone knows it was no accident.
1304436557068279813 2020-09-11 23:08:05 +0800 <braschen1> Criminal act, plain and simple.
1304404731272531974 2020-09-11 21:01:37 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1304399430540505090 2020-09-11 20:40:33 +0800 <braschen1> Good Question,  they like the pain and suffering,  I guess.
1304398634432241668 2020-09-11 20:37:23 +0800 <braschen1> @Acosta Too bad cry baby.
1304398429330776065 2020-09-11 20:36:34 +0800 <braschen1> @govkristinoem I like Jim Jordan,  but Governor Kristi just owned him.

1304397144812642304 2020-09-11 20:31:28 +0800 <braschen1> Of course they did.
1304397026348630020 2020-09-11 20:31:00 +0800 <braschen1> Every American knows that is a lie, they did it on purpose knowing they could lie and would be above the law. This country has a Two Tier Justice System.  It must change.

1304395856255365120 2020-09-11 20:26:21 +0800 <braschen1> @RichardGrenell Nothing will happen to them, unlike if I did the same,  they would lock me up. This country allows the Bureaucrats to establish a Two Tier Justice System.  This needs  to change.
1304394948222087171 2020-09-11 20:22:44 +0800 <braschen1> @USATRUMPMAN1 #BoycottNFL
1304394637411594245 2020-09-11 20:21:30 +0800 <braschen1> @AlessaAndreadis Ask him to go watch in the basement.
1304101418899509249 2020-09-11 00:56:21 +0800 <braschen1> I certainly won't be watching any sports until they are made to show proper respect to our Flag and Anthem.
1304101054083207176 2020-09-11 00:54:54 +0800 <braschen1> I will be watching for them, thanks
1304093424971386882 2020-09-11 00:24:36 +0800 <braschen1> I have not watched and will not watch until they make the players show due respect to our Flag and anthem

1303463653145010178 2020-09-09 06:42:06 +0800 <braschen1> @RealJamesWoods @ColSDM Perhaps a Law suit is called for to end the harvesting of votes, its not democratic.
1303462566337929218 2020-09-09 06:37:47 +0800 <braschen1> So what are you going to do about this Senator,  my Senator?
1303462184589164544 2020-09-09 06:36:16 +0800 <braschen1> @senatemajldr Just forget it until after the elections,  concentrate on getting Republicans elected in these close races.
1303461804379643904 2020-09-09 06:34:45 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump Vote every last democrat politician out, November 3rd.
1303456845219192833 2020-09-09 06:15:03 +0800 <braschen1> @Harrisjscott @dallasnews how did Lubys
1303450874275155969 2020-09-09 05:51:20 +0800 <braschen1> They still should not.
1303449486920945664 2020-09-09 05:45:49 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump When are you doing a rally in California.
1303448053827993601 2020-09-09 05:40:07 +0800 <braschen1> @AxemanRenegade7 Stay safe Sir.
1303447250224504833 2020-09-09 05:36:55 +0800 <braschen1> @TomFitton Obama and John Brennan are dirty and need to be investigated and prosecuted if the evidence leads too that.
1303446469375131651 2020-09-09 05:33:49 +0800 <braschen1> Of course you did not believe that they would honor their commitments, did you sir.
1303446034543251456 2020-09-09 05:32:06 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump You should go ahead and ask for donations,  the people will donate.
1303346741987741696 2020-09-08 22:57:32 +0800 <braschen1> @M4l4y @realDonaldTrump just followed you
1303346116075945984 2020-09-08 22:55:03 +0800 <braschen1> @Acosta yep
1303043834134376448 2020-09-08 02:53:54 +0800 <braschen1> @Tactical_review No he is just, a misguided soul. Forget that he is an idiot.
1303020282320429056 2020-09-08 01:20:18 +0800 <braschen1> No wonder they want out of that country.
1303017364557094912 2020-09-08 01:08:43 +0800 <braschen1> no way
1303017120272449537 2020-09-08 01:07:45 +0800 <braschen1> I am out on Ivanka, a bit too liberal for me.
1303016231675588608 2020-09-08 01:04:13 +0800 <braschen1> Mine as well.
1303010153277673474 2020-09-08 00:40:03 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct,  as should lying politicians.
1302971729963253760 2020-09-07 22:07:23 +0800 <braschen1> @marklevinshow it runs in the family,  they don't have to play by the same rules as common people,  Right Nancy.
1302968593815089155 2020-09-07 21:54:55 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct
1302966221969776641 2020-09-07 21:45:29 +0800 <braschen1> That suckered punching scumbag needs to be arrested and prosecuted.
1302965400691453953 2020-09-07 21:42:14 +0800 <braschen1> Correct the bueracrats state, local and federal, do not play by the same rules,  ask Nancy Pelosi.
1302964436618149888 2020-09-07 21:38:24 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1302962340011421696 2020-09-07 21:30:04 +0800 <braschen1> @MayorOfLA Sounds like LA needs a couple new power plants.
1302962050038145026 2020-09-07 21:28:55 +0800 <braschen1> @realDonaldTrump no Vaccine

1302754815966093313 2020-09-07 07:45:26 +0800 <braschen1> Unbelievable not even Mittens?
1302686981818904579 2020-09-07 03:15:53 +0800 <braschen1> Time to fully open the state @GovAbbott @realDonaldTrump
1302371039289249793 2020-09-06 06:20:27 +0800 <braschen1> @SenSchumer @SenSanders Both of you are idiots.
1302231484854566913 2020-09-05 21:05:54 +0800 <braschen1> @Akasidney1 yes
1302226330986086400 2020-09-05 20:45:26 +0800 <braschen1> @seanhannity Who cares, no one is watching them but perhaps their parents.
1302223040005255168 2020-09-05 20:32:21 +0800 <braschen1> Why was this ever a policy?
1302222488076681217 2020-09-05 20:30:09 +0800 <braschen1> Bring it on.
1302221992360325120 2020-09-05 20:28:11 +0800 <braschen1> Open the entire country now.
1302218037920235522 2020-09-05 20:12:28 +0800 <braschen1> @RussVought45 @POTUS What happens when the bueracrats don't listen to you, they run the government.
1302216454444589056 2020-09-05 20:06:11 +0800 <braschen1> It's past time for the DOJ to shut down BLM/Antifa,  America has had enough.
1302215835193409537 2020-09-05 20:03:43 +0800 <braschen1> Food Lion needs to rethink their antiAmerican face mask policy.
1302213911639396355 2020-09-05 19:56:05 +0800 <braschen1> @prettypeacejimi Religion, is man made, faulty.
1302043725271576576 2020-09-05 08:39:49 +0800 <braschen1> @SuzyQz777 @NFL Nobody watches them anymore.

1301913229841571840 2020-09-05 00:01:17 +0800 <braschen1> @govkristinoem Who is that pretty gal on the horse carrying the American flag.
1301912662088003584 2020-09-04 23:59:01 +0800 <braschen1> Wow, what a bunch of fools,  don't they have anything productive to do.
1301868742545207297 2020-09-04 21:04:30 +0800 <braschen1> The Politicians and Bueracrats won't get out of the way, they will continue  meddling otherwise the country will see they are a hindrance.
1301863165815394304 2020-09-04 20:42:20 +0800 <braschen1> Yep, my account has been like that from the start, I get from 5 to 15 followers a day, yet I have never been beyond 4300 , I am well below that today and many have followed, Twitter takes them away fast than they follow. It's ok I just keep on trying to help America and Trump.
1301671117204140032 2020-09-04 07:59:12 +0800 <braschen1> @GregAbbott_TX @USAVet5 Sir, it is now September. Open TX. totally.

1301561996412887041 2020-09-04 00:45:36 +0800 <braschen1> @tedwheeler Thats what should happen when Mayors won't protect the citizens of their city all citizens.
1301509275265556483 2020-09-03 21:16:06 +0800 <braschen1> Sounded like that to me, just saying.
1301500670483324928 2020-09-03 20:41:55 +0800 <braschen1> The SS. better pay this man a very serious visit.
1301310493823512577 2020-09-03 08:06:13 +0800 <braschen1> it sure show the hoax.
1301309199926939650 2020-09-03 08:01:05 +0800 <braschen1> @BretBaier Thats totally BS, and you know it. stop the lies.

1301298001428860934 2020-09-03 07:16:35 +0800 <braschen1> Exactly Correct.
1301286536202383361 2020-09-03 06:31:01 +0800 <braschen1> What a laugh he will be tough on President Trump and easy on whats his name, you know that Democrat guy.
1301285299222446083 2020-09-03 06:26:06 +0800 <braschen1> Of course she would say it was a set up, but no one is buying that BS.
1301284858438856706 2020-09-03 06:24:21 +0800 <braschen1> Absentee ballots have to be requested by the legitimate voter.
1301277766554447874 2020-09-03 05:56:10 +0800 <braschen1> @trixs1951 @Franklin_Graham @GraceComChurch I hear you,  to each his own.
1301213212864663552 2020-09-03 01:39:39 +0800 <braschen1> @trixs1951 @Franklin_Graham @GraceComChurch You will be Judged also.
1301211583759233024 2020-09-03 01:33:11 +0800 <braschen1> Yet she and the German government want to drastically increase the Natural Gas they import via pipeline from Russia/Putin. Would be better to invest in NATO, pay your agreed upon amount.
1301180128576372736 2020-09-02 23:28:12 +0800 <braschen1> They did it to themselves
1301171583231373313 2020-09-02 22:54:14 +0800 <braschen1> @cmarinucci Wow, that's what you have to say about this. Sad
1301171309871759363 2020-09-02 22:53:09 +0800 <braschen1> She lies with a smile,  if you vote for her or her Democrat politicians,  you will get what you vote for, liez and dishonesty.
1301167373479743489 2020-09-02 22:37:31 +0800 <braschen1> @DebraFierens @HippoUniversity @TXDeplorable45 hope you're correct
1301158855062286336 2020-09-02 22:03:40 +0800 <braschen1> What

1301156918292090880 2020-09-02 21:55:58 +0800 <braschen1> @SpeakerPelosi Such lies, but hey it's a Democrat.
1300898642547613697 2020-09-02 04:49:40 +0800 <braschen1> @ViceChr_Bryant Makes sense.
1300897869944193024 2020-09-02 04:46:36 +0800 <braschen1> Really, I would have never believed that in Kansas maybe Massachusetts.
1300897468280905728 2020-09-02 04:45:00 +0800 <braschen1> What state would that be ?
1300895936399499266 2020-09-02 04:38:55 +0800 <braschen1> Then there should be prosecutions why aren't they happening?
1300892533862600715 2020-09-02 04:25:24 +0800 <braschen1> Chief Justice Roberts,  should step in and end this and would if he were honorable.
1300890403609161728 2020-09-02 04:16:56 +0800 <braschen1> @KurtSchlichter What of their statements about election day landslide then week later mailed blots show Biden, win?
1300889165089976320 2020-09-02 04:12:00 +0800 <braschen1> It's a good thing she has no say over Federal assets
1300888111841513474 2020-09-02 04:07:49 +0800 <braschen1> MN, has 250,000 White men that are eligible too vote but are unregistered.  @GOPChairwoman we need a big registration push here in MN.
1300867445872357377 2020-09-02 02:45:42 +0800 <braschen1> Mail in ballots, Not absentee ballots,  should be made illegal by Executive Order. the elections are over on November 3rd,  end of story.
1300864231278075907 2020-09-02 02:32:56 +0800 <braschen1> Don't believe the deep state man, Director Wray.
1300832195095953409 2020-09-02 00:25:38 +0800 <braschen1> Thats too bad, NM used to be a grand state.
1300828843318616064 2020-09-02 00:12:19 +0800 <braschen1> The @GOP does not seem to support any of these close races, they could take 6 to 8 in California if they sent some money on them.
1300786534661132288 2020-09-01 21:24:11 +0800 <braschen1> The Governors  should open their States today, Owen the Country NOW.
1300783036775137281 2020-09-01 21:10:18 +0800 <braschen1> @KamalaHarris Mostly lies.
1300782291732570114 2020-09-01 21:07:20 +0800 <braschen1> Thank him for his Service.
1300777112895459328 2020-09-01 20:46:45 +0800 <braschen1> Who and what organizations are funding this lawlessness?
1300776709659205634 2020-09-01 20:45:09 +0800 <braschen1> Yes shameful,  if those Judges are not reprimanded, it is a bad sign for our Freedoms.
1300776259564318720 2020-09-01 20:43:22 +0800 <braschen1> @LeahR77 Jeb Bush will be of little help, but he will open eyes across the country.
1300776021118144513 2020-09-01 20:42:25 +0800 <braschen1> He has opened his eyes, good man and Governor.  @GovAbbott
1300775565188886528 2020-09-01 20:40:36 +0800 <braschen1> Open the State up or suffer the Political consequences Governors.
1300774332684267520 2020-09-01 20:35:42 +0800 <braschen1> @JoeBiden Mr. Biden, why condemn self defense,  it is the law of the land, and totally legal.
1300772812760772612 2020-09-01 20:29:40 +0800 <braschen1> @Acosta Hey Jim, do you think the man is doing this on his own, no way the man can't put together a complete sentence on his own. Of course he is being controlled by others and they are of a very Dark character,  stop pretending, America is watching.
1300588832069480459 2020-09-01 08:18:35 +0800 <braschen1> @ted_rood Wake up Sir.
