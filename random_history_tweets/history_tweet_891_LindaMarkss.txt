1343935700513812481 2020-12-29 23:03:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Superimposing an award over your picture, that you'll never win, is further evidence that #45 has totally lost it.

She'd encourage him to preach unity rather than division.  I see her as complicit at this point.  Complicit and useless.
1343287892983107587 2020-12-28 04:09:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Can someone explain to me how exactly Bill Gates is going to put transmitters into vaccines?

1343241300309585921 2020-12-28 01:04:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Hey trumpers!  How does it feel to know your benefits are going to run out and your guy is on the golf course enjoying himself?

The person at the counter wasn't wearing a mask.  I was like, oh aren't masks required here?  She said they aren't mandated and "it's not in the constitution".  I thought, wearing seat belts isn't in there either.
1343238851058393089 2020-12-28 00:54:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @marcorubio @cooperandjazz I suppose it isn't $$$ that makes someone "elitist" because LOTS of people in #45's circle have mega bucks.  It must be dignity, class, manners, education, friendships, loyalties.  All the things money can NOT buy and something #45 et al will never, ever have.  You too lil Marco.
1343238220776136707 2020-12-28 00:52:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @marcorubio @cooperandjazz So curious about tis "elite" bubble crap you and others are always talking about.  In your "mind" what constitutes "elite"?  I would have thought most of the people in #45's circle fit that bill.

They aren't interested in you .@FLOTUS because you're trash, married to a murderer, and you have zero class.  Evidently nobody is interested in you.

If the GOP has shown us ANYTHING these last four years, it's that you can't govern!  You just can't.  Like #45 has no compassion, you have no governing skills. You are unpopular as a party.  You LOST the last two popular votes.  Party of trump.

1342141311961473026 2020-12-25 00:13:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Peter_Wehner @angrytwinsmom Exactly.  But wasn't this obvious long before today?  One has to wonder what it is that #45 has on them.  Those that are still hanging on are the worst.  I'm thinking Cruz, Rubio and Graham who #45 insulted personally during the primary.  Sycophants.

I HOPE they have figured that out.  He sucks all the air out of the media cycle and they allow it.  Media is partly to blame for him being elected in 2016.

I'm surprised they had the tenacity to go ahead with impeachment.  Problem is, I suppose, they are powerless with the power they possess.  Will #45, et al, actually pay for their many crimes?  Media plays along too.

We see that his approval rating is rock bottom but he wins by 20 points.  KY ranks low in metrics that typically mean better lives.  What do they like about him?

Who invites 900 people to a party during a pandemic where the administration he works for specifically says no gatherings?  Further evidence that #45 and people around him believe they are truly above the law.

Overall, KY ranks 40th when it comes to issues that matter to people.  Like education, health care, poverty, fiscal stability, overall economy.  Do none of those issues matter?  How did McConnell win by a 20% margin when his favorable rate is so low?

1336035952393850880 2020-12-08 03:52:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Angry_Staffer Australia has several factors in their favor.  They are an island, it's easy to cut down travel.  They trust their government, evidently.  They had the sense to listen to science.  And now they are reaping the awards.  They are "pretty much back to normal".  I'm jealous.
1335954101604151299 2020-12-07 22:27:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I haven't liked .@McConaughey for years.  I couldn't tell you why, I just never liked him.  And his commercial for Lincolns?

1335731487396728832 2020-12-07 07:42:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Dear GOP:  you've allowed someone to ruin your party.  You stood by and didn't say a word.  Now he's trying to ruin our country.  Will you continue to stand by?  Or will you finally speak up?

1335364599466627073 2020-12-06 07:25:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Acosta Many of us would prefer it if the media didn‚Äôt allow him to control the narrative day after day.

1334895146475905025 2020-12-05 00:19:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @2000Schick They should legalize it on the federal level and use the money derived from the sales for Covid relief.  How ironic would that be.

1331992079761813506 2020-11-27 00:03:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @realDerekUtley @NYGovCuomo Well Justice Gorsuch, America is supposed to be secular.  You know the constitution, right?  Or maybe you don't but it specifically says SEPARATION of church and state.  IE: America is SECULAR.  Stop forcing your religion down our throats.
1331990930564538372 2020-11-26 23:59:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Rachel46181146 Same here.  Maybe stretch it out to 3 days.  I'm thinking I'll make turkey tetrazzini this year.  I thought we were getting a 10-12 lb turkey, hubby came home with a 15 lb turkey.  Eeek!!!

The difference will be the guy at the top isn't going to whine, he's going to try and make things better.  I'd like to see the idiot rot in jail.  *That* would be worthwhile.
1331984770063065090 2020-11-26 23:34:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gregggonsalves @gingerjonesNYC I suppose they think that if people are in a house of worship, they deity they are worshipping will keep them safe.  Even if they are crammed together.  Super.  If they get sick, they should ask their gods to save them.

1331981065691553792 2020-11-26 23:20:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @co_rapunzel4 Most ridiculous ruling ever.  When did rules and order disappear?  Did they leave the building with checks and balances?

1331684126697656322 2020-11-26 03:40:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Angry_Staffer One has to wonder if he actually thinks the last four years have been "great".  If that's his true belief, he needs meds, hospitalization, a lobotomy or all the above and more.
1331683750799945731 2020-11-26 03:38:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Angry_Staffer That's hilarious!  I guess she didn't like all the criticisms she got after saying she really didn't give a fuck about any of this.  She really *is* transparent.  She wore a coat that told everyone how she felt.

1331682379820363779 2020-11-26 03:33:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago If nobody is above the law, this should be a done deal.  But #45 has always managed to avoid and evade the law seemingly with little to no consequences.  I'd love to see him testifying in court.  Any court.
1331629650146177029 2020-11-26 00:03:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @politvidchannel I wonder what they thought might happen. They thought that #45 would perhaps be *loyal* to them on some level?  That's hilarious.  He eats people up and spits them out.  These guys are basically nothing in his sphere.

1329825072215977985 2020-11-21 00:32:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jonhartmannjazz Uh, ooops.
1329824902648639489 2020-11-21 00:32:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GrandmaMO I'm surprised there hasn't been an International investigation into how they've endangered the lives of so many underage children.
1329824386120093697 2020-11-21 00:30:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jonhartmannjazz The punishment Sisyphus was dealt would suffice.
1329824131219599361 2020-11-21 00:29:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jonhartmannjazz You and me both!
1329823878361866240 2020-11-21 00:28:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @joelockhart Well said.  It would set a precedence that a president can do anything without impunity.  Worse yet are the scores of republicans who allowed him to subvert our democracy.  What happens to them?
1329820685871493122 2020-11-21 00:15:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If #45 doesn't resign and there's no pardon, should he be tried for Federal crimes?
1329815339367079941 2020-11-20 23:54:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RhutaBhayga2 @kim @benjaminwittes Many people, including Dems, said he was an "institutionalist".  But, he also said he didn't have a legacy to protect so which is he?  A chameleon?
1329814086247395329 2020-11-20 23:49:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @itsJeffTiedrich @hillofkansas In his case, they would have marched him out before he even could put his shit in a box.

1329813076099670016 2020-11-20 23:45:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago Coulda, woulda, shoulda but who's going to enforce this?  Who is actually going to arrest the guy?  If this were you or me, we'd be toast.
1329812731239731201 2020-11-20 23:43:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Alex_Verbeek @u2_randy What a bunch of idiots.  Sure, let's just count where we're ahead and skip the rest.  They don't see the ignorance inherent in this?
1329811464853598209 2020-11-20 23:38:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ReesusP @skipz @IvankaTrump Oy.  FFS.  Just shut up Vanka.  Close your mouth and put your hands on your lap.
1329806997785554944 2020-11-20 23:21:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @IvankaTrump Your father is guilty as hell Vanka.  GUILTY. You should be well acquainted with "politics, publicity and rage".  Your daddy leads the pack.

1329647690578325504 2020-11-20 12:48:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @whyknotmeagain2 @MittRomney I bet he voted for #45.

1329512184691494912 2020-11-20 03:49:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @docforpets99 I got put in twitmo for saying "maybe" something might happen to someone with a chicken bone.  Maybe.
1329511827651387394 2020-11-20 03:48:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RogerSchaeffer3 Ha!  Sugar toothers.
1329511540794527744 2020-11-20 03:47:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TheRealGoodDay Of course the medical staff will treat them.  That's the Hippocratic Oath they take unlike the deniers who take the Hypocritical Oath.
1329502326135123969 2020-11-20 03:10:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Virus deniers, non-mask wearers and anti-vaxxers should deny medical care if they get the virus, right?
1329441350425718795 2020-11-19 23:08:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FreezyWriter That's what I think.  We don't have to hear him lie and in terms of the virus, he has nothing to add and hasn't been to a virus meeting in five months.  I'd say he stopped caring, but truth is, he never cared.
1329439566915399681 2020-11-19 23:01:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is it just me or is anyone else happy that #45 hasn't said one word or answered one question since he LOST the election?
1329160834271105025 2020-11-19 04:33:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @13vixen I think she's great and probably lucky at this point.  #45's extremely transparent when it comes to his petty and vindictive personality, about his taxes?  Not so much.
1329160263963205633 2020-11-19 04:31:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @manchildastnt @JBPritzker I know!!!  I'm in the northern burbs and people are pretty good about mask wearing and every store has a *masks up* sign.  I see people wearing masks while walking outside, riding bikes.  But we were also hit hard at the start so maybe people are learning?  Take care of yourself!
1329159768133558275 2020-11-19 04:29:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I think there are anti vaxxers out there for many reasons.  I'm not anti vax but I don't trust anything that might come from #45's administration.
1329159294307209220 2020-11-19 04:27:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ASlavitt @ginnygail1 We should have done this months ago.  If we had national leadership that actually believed in and understood science maybe we wouldn't have to do this.  I'm totally fine with the restrictions.  Let's get this done so we don't have to do it next year too.
1329158499973083140 2020-11-19 04:24:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Interesting.  Illinois just instituted new restrictions due to Covid.  #45 never tweeted "Liberate Illinois".  But he did say that about Michigan.  Why is that?  Misogyny?

1328017442514362369 2020-11-16 00:50:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I thought #45 vowed to leave the country and said we would never hear from him again if he lost.  Now he's talking about running for office in 2024?  He lost the popular vote twice!  Another lie from the liar.

1327640256859033600 2020-11-14 23:51:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> So #45 didn't stick around in DC for his march?  He put golfing *over* the million expected to show up?  He must have known it would be a bust.

1327380932169494534 2020-11-14 06:40:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I don't get the whole "pancake thing" and the maga march, but I like it!
1327380247189336067 2020-11-14 06:38:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WDCreports Why pancakes?
1327378945990402056 2020-11-14 06:32:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff Sorry, big mistake.
1327378669392814080 2020-11-14 06:31:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago He is clearly delusional.  But as freaky as that is, the people around him who support this delusion.  That's the most frightening part.  Don't his kids care about him, his mental health?
1327378237077524481 2020-11-14 06:30:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago He better suffer some consequences for his many, many illegal activities.  He can not get off scott free.
1327374551710359555 2020-11-14 06:15:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BeschlossDC @ewindham3 NY should withhold Federal funds.  Regardless, he's not going to be in any position come April to deny anyone anything.  Hopefully.
1327365077629104133 2020-11-14 05:37:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Transition46 @davidpsdem I'd work with .@JustinTrudeau any day of the week.  üòâüá®üá¶
1327364761470857216 2020-11-14 05:36:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jaketapper @bhight3 Based on what #45 said in 2016, #BidenHarris won by a landslide.  Right .@realDonaldTrump ?  You LOST the POPULAR vote again!  Loser!
1327364296339304448 2020-11-14 05:34:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> What's with his hair?  Losing aged him?

1327272036901785601 2020-11-13 23:28:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FredPecora Well, yeah Marco.
1327271380921016331 2020-11-13 23:25:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @becksthfc @BlackCheesebur1 Uh, what the what is this?
1327270958638436355 2020-11-13 23:23:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ricklevenson Or put a pair of dice together!
1327270307183386624 2020-11-13 23:21:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @stuartpstevens @ghost_fdr @PressSec Nobody is there to stop this behavior. Sure it might be a law but who is going to enforce it?  Why is there an emoluments clause in the constitution if it's not going to be enforced?  We're LAWLESS and we have been going in that direction for the last 4 years and we're there now.
1327268992357175296 2020-11-13 23:16:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Will #45 be on the golf course this weekend or in DC directing the maga march?
1327268721103163393 2020-11-13 23:14:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LinkedHD @ceanothus101 Let's hope that's true.
1327268643932135424 2020-11-13 23:14:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @educated_educ8r @melpriceHB yes.  Let's take this seriously.
1327268394618458113 2020-11-13 23:13:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ColleenPathe @ReportsDaNews Will he be on the golf course.
1327268033547685889 2020-11-13 23:12:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CrystalResists The country has never been closed down. Parts of it were closed but a large swath of the country was in denial.  If the guy at the top took it seriously from the beginning maybe we wouldn't be in this position.  Right now I know five people who have had the virus. They're all ok.
1327267298927894533 2020-11-13 23:09:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gwlaw @nancylevine @ProfSchooner @GovExec @GWLawGovCon Sadly it doesn't appear that the GOP or #45 gives two craps about this.   Not two craps.
1327266832911392773 2020-11-13 23:07:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @politvidchannel Ha!  "I really don't care, do you"?  And, "it is what it is".
1327264713454063617 2020-11-13 22:59:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MollyJongFast @dhfull50 Idiot.
1327264255951970304 2020-11-13 22:57:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @pakulalula @JeanineForBiden Yeah, no.
1327262090269237248 2020-11-13 22:48:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @glennkirschner2 @Diana_Chumley Highly doubt this is her decision to make.  It's coming from the top.
1327105616620511237 2020-11-13 12:26:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Something nice:  Since #45 is sulking and not talking, we don't have to see him on any of the media outlets.
1327093758266109952 2020-11-13 11:39:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AllanMargolin @SelMill @SharonCoryell3 @spauley311 @kdqd3 @BarbaraWieczor7 @angie_keathly @jeszymk @bol_deb This is hilarious.
1327039578629345287 2020-11-13 08:04:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @windsorjlj Good one!  Thanks for the laugh!
1327034210905976832 2020-11-13 07:43:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JosephZaccaria2 Where will they sleep?  üòâ
1327019311857283073 2020-11-13 06:43:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GrubenPamela  https://t.co/LAzatf8iyl  No idea who is behind this, but they don't have a permit??
1327018025866956802 2020-11-13 06:38:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Yenmor @GinoKusa Yeah, no idea.  I hope not.  It's probably best if they are ignored and no doubt they'd love some violence.
1327017281961005057 2020-11-13 06:35:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @fakepropaganda1 Well said.  Media outlets aren't advertising it.
1327016276917673985 2020-11-13 06:31:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @louigard We'll see.
1327015902043246593 2020-11-13 06:30:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kamtheleo That's a relief!  Good grief.  I wonder if they'll show up carrying though.
1327013487017603075 2020-11-13 06:20:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kamtheleo HA!!!  The DMV!  So appropriate!  Is open carry allowed in DC?  Will people show up armed to the teeth?
1327013051992780809 2020-11-13 06:19:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SandysFarm53 @PHILLYSKEPTIC Uhhh... ewww!!  But  I hear ya!
1327007244664377352 2020-11-13 05:55:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sdward1 If only!!
1327004652613808131 2020-11-13 05:45:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DeebTammy @Tap8dotcom I don't know what that is, but whoa.
1327004388230131713 2020-11-13 05:44:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hope4OCT Haha!!
1327004008700055558 2020-11-13 05:43:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mawesten321 He manages to suck the air out of every single news cycle.  Enough.  Media has always known he's bad for the country but good for ratings.  It's disgusting at this point.
1327003545216880642 2020-11-13 05:41:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SherryMacDona12 @GallegoMd You could not pay me to go.  It's a maga march.  We'll be great again in January when #45 is gone.  üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üá®üá¶
1327003181306540032 2020-11-13 05:39:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @pat1556 He'll put up a picture of the crowd for the pope or maybe when the Cubs won and they had five million people show up.
1327002654459965442 2020-11-13 05:37:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PHILLYSKEPTIC Boy, his hand and his face look like they belong to two different people.
1327002319641321473 2020-11-13 05:36:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Tap8dotcom @DeebTammy Ha!!

1326999480307224578 2020-11-13 05:25:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jcnalpha Is he supposed to speak?  I'm surprised he's not on the golf course.

1326997728006729728 2020-11-13 05:18:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Will a million people show up to the march in DC on Saturday?
1326996055880331264 2020-11-13 05:11:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ResisterForever @Nancabell @realDonaldTrump Yay!
1326905642053984257 2020-11-12 23:12:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @macarthur54 @fras99 *Within* the first month.
1326905466300084229 2020-11-12 23:11:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FarandWidecom Somewhere where there's no virus.  I'll take New Zealand.
1326905357915090945 2020-11-12 23:11:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Overloading hospitals and taxing the medical professionals is exactly what I worried about most when it came to this virus.
1326746620780744705 2020-11-12 12:40:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dad_darius @KamZenolay What's wrong is the idiot in the WH who made wearing a mask a political statement.
1326668737248960512 2020-11-12 07:30:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago We're indeed fortunate there's been no major threat to our country except for Covid which obviously was beyond the idiot's area of expertise.
1326668183403712517 2020-11-12 07:28:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @laurenboebert And yet you call yourself "elect".
1326661537696800768 2020-11-12 07:02:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @KevinMKruse @AngrierWHStaff Seriously?
1326636615494725634 2020-11-12 05:23:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BradleyBlomgren @CathyOConnell12 And at this point, I'm pretty sure Covid has affected everyone even if they didn't contract it.  It's really astounding.  Just astounding.

1326634070567251971 2020-11-12 05:13:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Chooglin1 Aside from North Korea, I can't think of a bigger cult.  That's a scary thought.
1326633317253468162 2020-11-12 05:10:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @OnstottRachel Is that like when we hear "we are all in this together" and you think, yeah, but I don't want to be in *this* with them.
1326633017033560065 2020-11-12 05:08:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CharlesBonapar5 @NRA Definitely explains a good part.

1326623225997045762 2020-11-12 04:29:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I'm wondering: how did 70 million people look around and say, "yeah, let's do this for four more years".  I don't get it.
1326621884859944961 2020-11-12 04:24:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @cholt55 @DeniseRankin18 Maybe they‚Äôre going to ... if I say it Ill probably be put in Twitmo.
1326539098383773698 2020-11-11 22:55:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dave91755807 So transparent.
1326535897806905359 2020-11-11 22:42:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Mocraig13 @rdreynola What'd he do?  Sign an Executive Order?  I thought Congress held the purse strings?
1326535563986546688 2020-11-11 22:41:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Why didn't #45 say "stop counting votes in Alaska"?.
1326534246882828289 2020-11-11 22:36:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PassarelliAllan No clue.  Getting ready to take control of the military?  Getting ready for a coup?  If #45 is involved, it's either illegal, unprecedented or a major screw up.
1326532873587986432 2020-11-11 22:30:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TalbertSwan @DeeinMaryland "Just count the votes that put us in power".
1326532307445035008 2020-11-11 22:28:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LouGarza86 I'd ask you what the crime was but that might put you back in twitmo.

1326529318093279237 2020-11-11 22:16:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillKristol @candik2 Tell us .@BillKristol , what exactly does #45 have on them that's turned them into traitors?
1326526128677384195 2020-11-11 22:04:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @blueheartedly What else could possibly explain it?  Oh wait, they all hate the same people, maybe that's it.
1326525879414099968 2020-11-11 22:03:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FrankSowa1 @TimH3401 Now?  Just now?  We've been vulnerable since the idiot came into "office".
1326385727689662465 2020-11-11 12:46:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CSMetissier @KirchmannLinda @mmpadellan It's hard to believe, how does someone do that with those abysmal job ratings?
1326385383815438341 2020-11-11 12:44:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ProjectLincoln @dimbiddy She'd probably lose her job if she signed it.  The whole thing is pathetic.  Poor little #45 and his ego.  His poor, deflated ego.
1326380707317501964 2020-11-11 12:26:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chipfranklin @ringsforfun There's something not right.  They are way too complicit.
1326377829743865865 2020-11-11 12:14:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> WTF?  Is there going to be a coup?  How much danger are we in?
1326269935782416384 2020-11-11 05:06:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Who is doing the major stroking of poor little #45's ego?

1326257835785789445 2020-11-11 04:18:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I dunno, I think .@JoeLieberman is being way too politically correct here.
1326257617631633408 2020-11-11 04:17:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff @DannyMayes How about the worst administration from top to bottom without a doubt.
1326185633623265282 2020-11-10 23:31:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @nytimes @fxmct71 If similar comments are being made by democrats, I'd like to see them.  Seems like the dangerous vitriol is coming from the right.

1326182989093613570 2020-11-10 23:20:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hopey_70 @gimli0413 Well yeah, they look like assholes.  I'm sure they are "very nice people" but maybe they should have kept their firearms inside.

1326182140204240897 2020-11-10 23:17:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jimsciutto @pacdits They have no spines.  What exactly does #45 have on them?  Whatever it is, it must be good because they refuse to speak honestly.
1326030636877045762 2020-11-10 13:15:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @clairecmc @davidpsdem That's one of the most reckless statements I've heard.  Oh sure, let's just humor the grown man who is unable to accept the fact that he lost this election.  Are we humoring him while he decimates national security?  Totally ridiculous statement.
1326000018151583744 2020-11-10 11:13:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Dknight10k .@MSNBC except when .@mitchellreports and .@chucktodd are on.  Then I switch to .@CNN unless .@CLewandowski_  is on or .@RickSantorum,  blech.

1325951003955503105 2020-11-10 07:58:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @morganprice I live in Illinois and we never had mac and cheese.  Interesting.  I see it in the South a lot.

1325940166272425984 2020-11-10 07:15:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NancyLeeGrahn @kmarsh625 Maybe it's a rouse so they can say later on, "see how unbiased we are?".
1325938671741243397 2020-11-10 07:09:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I'm matchmaking: .@AriMelber and .@JuanitaTolliver.  What do you think .@MSNBC?
1325937651615223809 2020-11-10 07:05:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @fdflannagan Great word: putrid.  They are indeed.
1325899944327344129 2020-11-10 04:35:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FlagKnitter Mitch said he was bipartisan?  hahahahahahahaha!!!!  That's hilarious!!!  We aren't all trumpers mitch.  We see what we see and we hear what we hear.

1325899287730016258 2020-11-10 04:33:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RobVarsity3 Do we get to hear a Democrat's point of view?  I had to turn the volume off, I presume it was a bunch of hypocrisy and lies.
1325897039289479170 2020-11-10 04:24:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I'm not sure who I hate more, McConnell or #45.

1325573145584160770 2020-11-09 06:57:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ossoff What do we need to do?  We're ready.  I'm ready in Illinois.  Let's do this.
1325571187225845761 2020-11-09 06:49:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MichelleObama @Bray_NYC Can they be reached?  That's the problem and question.
1325554314987888641 2020-11-09 05:42:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AdjunctDespot I'm not a dog person but even I have to admit these are handsome dogs and I'm glad they are coming to our WH.  I wish it were two beautiful cats, but.. it's all good.
1325537473779396609 2020-11-09 04:35:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @phil_rosenthal @kevtibs No kidding.  I turned on the food channel.  Tennis channel next.  Who really thought those winning games signaled something.
1325497541081919496 2020-11-09 01:56:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Rest in peace Alex Trebek.  You fought the good fight.  You will be missed.
1325483507796291590 2020-11-09 01:01:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ConsueloBurrito Just like #45 has no idea who QAnon is.
1325482612199198722 2020-11-09 00:57:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @yepmeamalie @TheButterNutty We need those two senators to go blue in Georgia!  If we don't get them and it's in McConnell's hands, we're screwed.  Conversely, EO's seem to solve a multitude of problems.
1325481444647563269 2020-11-09 00:52:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hummingbrrrd77 It's just amazing to me.  You would think disrespecting every group of people that aren't rich, white, straight christian men would be enough.  You'd think kids in cages and NO plan for Covid would be enough.  I guess those issues aren't worth fighting for.
1325480592591507456 2020-11-09 00:49:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sharonsedgwick Ha!!!  A for real laugh out loud moment!  Thanks!
1325479074597376000 2020-11-09 00:43:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @guboya Totally agree that often it's a single issue.  Sadly many times that means voting against their own best financial interests which the rest of us have to pay for their choice.
1325478459867602944 2020-11-09 00:41:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MaroonedUSA @GurbachDavid Great reply!
1325477783234031618 2020-11-09 00:38:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Bertina56941901 This could be a really crappy November for #45.
1325477520586797058 2020-11-09 00:37:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TheButterNutty Yeah, maybe.  If that's what happened, I hope the numbers change.  We'll see.
1325476956419334145 2020-11-09 00:35:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Redphilly So, he hates the same people they hate and they love him for that.  Yep.  What else can explain it?
1325476746704064514 2020-11-09 00:34:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gwndlynsmtg @donnamellon1 We're going to need deprogramming on a national level.
1325476534472372226 2020-11-09 00:33:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SL_Azkikr I did too!  Agree with what you said!
1325476386300104704 2020-11-09 00:32:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hummingbrrrd77 It's astounding that someone looks at the last 4 years and thinks, sure let's do it again.  And that's on so many levels.  I would have thought women, in this case WW because WOC have their act together, I'd have thought they'd think about kids in cages &amp; the virus &amp; say enough.
1325475400219287552 2020-11-09 00:28:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @clayrocs I only care that they are spending our money to make something so hideous.
1325475243696271361 2020-11-09 00:28:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @zinnderson @Kats_GA Or when they reach the age of 65 and get their social security check.  It's sad.
1325474979224412160 2020-11-09 00:27:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TWLadyGrey I think that sums it up.
1325474731873677312 2020-11-09 00:26:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @careangel614 @swnsasy That certainly says a lot.
1325471563194437632 2020-11-09 00:13:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bulmasan Unbelievable.  Unreal.  What would it take to get them to reevaluate their politics?  Evidently living in places that are pretty much on the bottom of the list when it comes to metrics that make a state great plays a role.  Specifically education where KY is 45th.
1325470451167080448 2020-11-09 00:09:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @skiBum1138 That's the number that's being reported.  I don't want to believe it but I believe it.  wow.  Just, wow.
1325469995841761280 2020-11-09 00:07:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Cheeeekie Unbelievable.
1325469759941586945 2020-11-09 00:06:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BonnieBlueBell1 Hahaha!!
1325469704442540032 2020-11-09 00:06:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @skiBum1138 White women.
1325469259011678211 2020-11-09 00:04:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Can anyone explain why 55% of WW voted for #45?  This was up from 2016.  "The last four years have been amazing,  let's do four more"?  wow.
1325468826897670144 2020-11-09 00:02:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @7205CMoore Yeah, nope.
1325468728918732801 2020-11-09 00:02:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @trish_trapnell Is she really?

1325465213416726528 2020-11-08 23:48:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ethasthree Exactly!   That's why I wonder if she'll go through the mechanics this year.  Definitely prefer someone without any negativity do the decorating this year.  But, I "really don't care".
1325464029897306113 2020-11-08 23:43:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Given what Melania said recently about decorating the WH for Christmas, do you think she's going to decorate this year?
1325463497329831937 2020-11-08 23:41:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @shanasspring The majority hates him but wow, 70 million think he's the answer.  wow.
1325460881505808390 2020-11-08 23:31:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Wasn't #45 saying the election was fraudulent even before anyone voted?
1325460311101632512 2020-11-08 23:28:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure you thought it was the Four Seasons Hotel! Hahaha.  Your team couldn't even get that right.  doofus.
1325459977448943619 2020-11-08 23:27:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @realDonaldTrump Every one of your RECENT tweets has a disclaimer.  See, nobody, even your beloved method of castigating people, declaring how everyone hurts you, even Twitter is basically calling you a liar.  You lost.  AND you LOST THE POPULAR VOTE AGAIN.  BYE BYE.

1325280737118056448 2020-11-08 11:35:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jennyrachelpal I heard it was Corey Lewandowski.  I wonder if it was done on purpose.  üòâ

1325272424095633409 2020-11-08 11:02:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RickFreedland @MSNBC You're right, SC will never elect a Dem and they voted for Linds again, so there's that.

1325178843255205893 2020-11-08 04:50:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ms_INDEPEND I hear ya.  I was supposed to go to Japan in April to see my son.  He probably won't be here for the holidays because if he comes here he most likely wouldn't be able to go back to Japan.
1325166765341515776 2020-11-08 04:02:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ms_INDEPEND Maybe we can travel again.  It'd be nice to go to Canada.
1325166581794496517 2020-11-08 04:01:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LaurenceTobias1 @PanacheUS And #45 has never said one word for the huge loss of life.  He's completely devoid of human emotion.
1325166275153125376 2020-11-08 04:00:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Irishgeek1268 I think if it had happened on Tuesday I might have cried but it was prolonged and the counting kept going on and on.  I definitely won't have to wake up at four am to check the EC vote this morning!  yay!
1325165425882116096 2020-11-08 03:57:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LiberalNerd1 I'm being sarcastic.  #45 and other GOP'ers said it would magically end after the election.  Agree we should celebrate!  And go Georgia!  Our next opportunity.

1325163039377797121 2020-11-08 03:47:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GeorgesTennis That's what GOP and #45 have been saying.  After the election, covid will magically disappear. üòâ
1325159798506057728 2020-11-08 03:34:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Does this mean the corona virus is going to end around the world?

1325115661178327043 2020-11-08 00:39:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Suck it up .@RickSantorum .  By the way .@CNN, many of us change the channel when you put him on air.
1325115179831529472 2020-11-08 00:37:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @realDonaldTrump Buh bye.  Thoughts and prayers.
1325101999432499207 2020-11-07 23:45:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DogginTrump Joe is only anti #45 because he threatened to tell everyone about his affair with Mika.  If and when the right conservative comes along, Joe will be right there.  He‚Äôs the same Joe he‚Äôs always been.

1325091797450821632 2020-11-07 23:04:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dawndaledoxidoc "thoughts and prayers" should be sufficient, right?
1325091026139295755 2020-11-07 23:01:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TerribleT220 I discovered using .@Twitter to complain about something gets you much better results than if you placed a call.

1325081554784169984 2020-11-07 22:23:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dawndaledoxidoc Rick Santorum on #CNN means people aren't watching .@CNN because liberals/progressives hate Rick Santorum.  I have no idea why they keep trotting him out.  Between Rick and Corey Lewandowski, .@CNN has zero credibility.
1325080783158202370 2020-11-07 22:20:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @willedit4food Well that explains it!
1325079934121947136 2020-11-07 22:17:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @martycomroe It's gotta be something like that!
1325079013770072065 2020-11-07 22:13:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I know we have to be patient while the counting continues but why is Nevada so slow?  Less than 2 million people voted there, what's the problem?

1324856617473613829 2020-11-07 07:30:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ya know, if this was an election where the winner was the one with the most votes, it would be over.
1324834184041537542 2020-11-07 06:00:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @radleybalko Some states weren't allowed to count mail in or absentee votes early.  And some states were overwhelmed with the amount of mail in and absentee ballots.
1324833035708207106 2020-11-07 05:56:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Citizen4Biden @Elsie_Mandel Well yes, but James Carville also said this would be over by 10:00 pm on Election night!  He's confident that Biden will win and it looks that way but I'll never quite look at him the same way and I really like him.
1324818373981704192 2020-11-07 04:58:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is there any chance, any chance at all, that this election will be called today?
1324770050935574530 2020-11-07 01:46:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If, and when #45 concedes, will he tweet it or appear live?
1324751636770758656 2020-11-07 00:32:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@MSNBC Of course #45 isn't in his office, it's only 11:30 am.  Will he golf today?
1324733202406252545 2020-11-06 23:19:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Free_Media_Hub It just needs some butter.  I had many potato chip sandwiches in my youth!

1324727904861888514 2020-11-06 22:58:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DonaldJTrumpJr Does anyone really believe that the men in the trump family have brains?  Or decency?  Or dignity or values or integrity?  Yeah, nope.
1324717412529381382 2020-11-06 22:16:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @realDonaldTrump You were up six hours ago sending tweets?  Like dude, you should rest because you're nightmares are just beginning.  Miserable POS.

1324409232251342851 2020-11-06 01:52:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> These are AP‚Äôs numbers.  They called AZ on Tuesday night.  https://t.co/H4G9OV9tXX
1324401828054839296 2020-11-06 01:22:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Anyone else feeling like "just let me know when it's over"?.  Time for the tennis/food channel.
1324392732190822412 2020-11-06 00:46:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Supergirleileen @sqeptiq @tech_mtw In terms of metrics, Maryland is at the top of the list when it comes to opportunity, healthcare, education, etc. whereas KY is at the bottom in almost all of those metrics.

1324381917614137345 2020-11-06 00:03:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RJTO65 @tech_mtw And they have no friends or relatives who tell them there‚Äôs a better life out there?
1324374706527571968 2020-11-05 23:35:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@AP Called Arizona on Tuesday night for Biden.  Their site still shows AZ as being blue.  What do they know that other outlets don't know?  Why the discrepancy?
1324374397499645954 2020-11-05 23:33:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @siscokiid @SteveKornacki *Mute* has been my friend these last few days.

1324373388505325570 2020-11-05 23:29:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Schumann786 @GOP That would be well placed.  I hope they all rot in jail or hell, whichever comes first.

1324372639771774978 2020-11-05 23:26:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Schumann786 He seriously needs to be brought up on charges once this is over.  Only a dictator or authoritarian would say let's stop counting the votes in a supposedly fair election.
1324372180612898820 2020-11-05 23:25:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @vonniedecember @tech_mtw Well said!!

1324371198206185487 2020-11-05 23:21:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @digitalsmgital Oh, I think the exact opposite.  I think people in the poorer states vote primarily for social issues.  They consistently vote against their own best financial interests.  Like Kentucky for example.  They rank on the bottom of the list for most aspects that make lives better.
1324370584793456643 2020-11-05 23:18:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ArdmoreJohn @kc_martin12 If it's a hoax, somehow the entire world is playing along.
1324370170492706816 2020-11-05 23:17:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BernFoster1 @shadylady1976 @SteveKornacki Definitely a matter of "let's kill some time".  I figured last night nothing was going to happen so I shut it all down and watched .@SchittsCreek and  #TheGreatBritishBakeOff
1324369570346524672 2020-11-05 23:14:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @The_Inukshuk @tech_mtw Evidently

1324368926487306241 2020-11-05 23:12:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @shadylady1976 @SteveKornacki Exactly!!!
1324368764910116866 2020-11-05 23:11:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @lvlalachi @onedarlinperson How does one know if their ballot has been disregarded?
1324367827697045513 2020-11-05 23:07:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Anyone else tired of hearing .@SteveKornacki go through the various outcomes of this election?
1324366871303495682 2020-11-05 23:04:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @tech_mtw How does a state that ranks on the bottom in nearly every aspect that makes for a better life keep voting for this schmuck who obviously hasn't made their lives better.  How does that happen?
1324366142270541827 2020-11-05 23:01:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gigimac211 Only thing I can come up with is that he hates the same people they hate and they love him for that.  What else can explain it?  He has NO plan, and he lies whenever he opens his mouth.  It's ludicrous.
1324364201327026179 2020-11-05 22:53:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GeorgeTakei I've always liked .@SteveKornacki , this time around?  Not so much.
1324363495685689344 2020-11-05 22:50:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@realDonaldTrump Hey schmuck.  You LOST the POPULAR VOTE AGAIN!
1324363301950803969 2020-11-05 22:49:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @votevets @WildGrizzlyBea2 Agree.  Let's stop the count because right now, Biden leads.
1324362751251275776 2020-11-05 22:47:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> America, what the what?  Millions voted for a guy who has NO PLAN during a pandemic that has killed a quarter of a million people and made millions sick?  You want four more years of this?  WTAF.  Why?
1324359841490571266 2020-11-05 22:36:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WajahatAli @Mandari25733571 Unbelievable.  The only reason I can come up with is that they hate the same people he hates and they love him for that.  Scary stuff since it involves such a huge swath of people.
1324197434692698112 2020-11-05 11:50:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @funder Like puking, you?
1324197373732659201 2020-11-05 11:50:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TrueBlueResists @MrDenorris So let's award him and vote for him!!   It's astounding.  He has NO plan!!  Where's the health care plan?  Where's the plan for infrastructure?  Where's the middle income tax cut or the $200 senior drug discount cards?
1324196283951833089 2020-11-05 11:46:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WhiteTrashGal @TimNoEgo That about sums it up for me.  Although I won't believe he's won until he's won and I'll probably never trust another pollster again.
1324191885162913794 2020-11-05 11:28:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @wm_tharp @AP @JoeBiden AP called it for Biden last night.  What info did they have then that they don't have now?  Weird.
1324186883849682950 2020-11-05 11:08:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@AP has .@JoeBiden at 264 EC votes.  They've given him AZ, again.  ?
1324184632829554689 2020-11-05 10:59:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Weinsteinlaw @robbiegj11 And her husband is Jewish!  There was so much other *drama* I forgot how historic this is .  And hopefully, it's going to happen.
1324184013658083329 2020-11-05 10:57:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff @MadVet2000 It's certainly succinct.
1324183752222908416 2020-11-05 10:56:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TimFullerton @Pissed_Woman Ha!!!  They have never ever cared about optics!  It's fitting and appropriate on so many levels!
1324183168329699329 2020-11-05 10:54:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @808_native @badwebsites Me too.  I'm trying to ignore it but that's not going to happen.
1324182769187082241 2020-11-05 10:52:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TimNoEgo Yeah yeah, just like James Carville said the election would be over by 10:00 last night and Biden would be a clear winner.  pft.
1324180462055657474 2020-11-05 10:43:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @808_native @badwebsites The whole thing is making me nervous particularly since they called AZ for Biden last night.  Seriously.  Pollsters need to get new day jobs.
1324178957642715136 2020-11-05 10:37:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @badwebsites AP gave it to him last night!  Now they are waiting to count thousands of votes.  MSNBC still saying it's too close to call.  What the what?
1324004800585965569 2020-11-04 23:05:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> The BEST thing about today: We're done with political ads!
1324004576312365056 2020-11-04 23:04:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Seriously, how does #45 claim victory when Biden has more of the popular vote and is leading in the EC?  This is FAKE NEWS!
1324004020411863040 2020-11-04 23:02:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @joelockhart @MSNBC Let me just add:  ARGGGGGGG!
1324003877134442496 2020-11-04 23:01:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @delsuite @joelockhart @MSNBC Me too!
1324003783769206786 2020-11-04 23:01:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @djrothkopf @WriteStephC Well past time to ditch the EC that awards land and not people.  The one with the MOST votes should win, just like every other election in every other city, county, state and nation.
1324003157429624835 2020-11-04 22:58:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @joelockhart @MSNBC Thanks Joe!  Wasn't that a done deal last night?  Why is .@MSNBC holding back?
1324002936817655808 2020-11-04 22:57:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MaryLTrump @m_tmmelle Evidently they don't care!  It's astounding.
1324002533401133057 2020-11-04 22:56:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Why does the AP show Biden with 238 EC votes and the idiot with 213, but .@MSNBC showing 224 for Biden?
1324002253338980355 2020-11-04 22:55:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mmpadellan I'm never going to forgive the pollsters.  They should all lose their jobs.  How do you go from a 17% lead in Wisconsin, for example, to this tight of a race?
1324000555048599552 2020-11-04 22:48:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BLaw Good because given the current state of affairs in America, we're going to need to be ripped to the tits.
1323999940427845634 2020-11-04 22:45:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @funder Like crap, you?
1323999749092057088 2020-11-04 22:45:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@MSNBC .@SRuhle Didn't people vote for #45 because he hates the same people they hate and they love him for that?
1323999523597856769 2020-11-04 22:44:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mjs_DC @Ellesun What the hell is wrong with people in America?  How in the hell is this "status-quo" ok with people?  We're just in for more of the same with McConnell as Senate Majority leader.  Really makes me wonder.  Agree Roe V. Wade is just the beginning.
1323998419694870528 2020-11-04 22:39:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Didn't Mitch-the-bitch-McConnell already say nothing would pass the Senate if Biden is elected?  Thanks guys, you could have set the table but you chose not to.  Thanks Iowa and Maine.
1323997594830442497 2020-11-04 22:36:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @anacarolinita2 Somehow voting for the economy would be easier to swallow.  We suck.
1323997247688814592 2020-11-04 22:35:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> America I thought the choice was simple: decency, honesty, integrity, truth and science but evidently people still are going with cheating, lying, denying science a rampant virus and more of the same in the Senate.  wow. Hugely disappointed in my country.
1323996714303475714 2020-11-04 22:33:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> How does #45 claim he won when Biden has more EC votes?
1323989795387920384 2020-11-04 22:05:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Fuck the polls AND the pollsters!
1323845705061064705 2020-11-04 12:33:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bitchhatestrump @PalmerReport I was hoping for a landslide!  But any win is better than any loss.  I just want to see a W in the column.

1323838279402299394 2020-11-04 12:03:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> It's not over yet but, wow.  I thought we were better than this.
1323838149336965122 2020-11-04 12:03:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CannabisBizNews One of the few bright spots so far.

1323825676454105088 2020-11-04 11:13:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @4thinkerbell It's making me nauseous.  I had to turn the sound down.

1323824673273139200 2020-11-04 11:09:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MrFilmkritik @blampaton Who knows???!!??  Is it the water?  Maybe it's the 43rd in education?  C'mon Kentuckians!  You deserve so much better.
1323824177334390794 2020-11-04 11:07:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #MSNBC2020  My freak out level is at about 100% right now.  It's not going to happen again, is it?
1323819859671687169 2020-11-04 10:50:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @makesmesmile49 I'm feeling queasy too!  dammit.
1323815002650890242 2020-11-04 10:31:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> GOP holds the Senate and we can forget anything happening even if #BidenHarris2020 win.

1323810784548425729 2020-11-04 10:14:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff I'm still freaked out.  It looks doable.
1323810391827320835 2020-11-04 10:12:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff I'm starting to freak out.  .@SteveKornacki isn't making me feel particularly good.

1323752937454272512 2020-11-04 06:24:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PragueloverR @CNN My first major reason was Corey Lewandowski.  I freaked when they put .@NicolleDWallace on but I've come to really like her.  I know with all the anti/never trumpers, however,  once the right conservative comes along, they'll all jump ship.  It's nice, but it's temporary.
1323752272996769793 2020-11-04 06:21:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @meri315 @CNN Me too!  As soon as Andrea Mitchell comes on I switch to .@CNN and stay there for two hours.  But Rick Santorum??!!??  ick.

1323450826891894784 2020-11-03 10:24:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @grimbola1 I think that too at times but then I think there's a real momentum and millions of people are voting.  I thought a country that elected PBO twice would never elect #45 once.  Now I think a country that elected him once would never do it again.  But who knows??!!  Argggggg.

1323391064473018370 2020-11-03 06:26:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mmastela Yes, yes it was.  I think she meant "fuck your christmas" but not "my christmas".
1323389397010731010 2020-11-03 06:19:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I guess the war on Christmas is over because I'm already seeing holiday commercials.

1322990777866268686 2020-11-02 03:55:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dhershiser @NY_runaway I saw a fair amount of that in No. Wisconsin.  I was thinking, "wow, what's he done for you, your counties still haven't recovered from the first recession".  Then I came home and saw #BidenHarris signs all over the place.  SO relieved!
1322986946201817090 2020-11-02 03:40:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Cubs too!!!
1322934802148925443 2020-11-02 00:13:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RogerSchaeffer3 @MarkRuffalo Ah.  I see the exact opposite.  I know that was why he chose her as well as her conservative leanings on other multiple issues.  I think they sacrificed the Senate to push her through and overturning RvW has been their goal since it was enacted.  But, I'm sure we'll see!
1322930522138550272 2020-11-01 23:56:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TexasTribune @InSpiteOfTrump So of course #45 came out and condemned the action, right?  Any true leader would come out and do that, right?  He probably PAID them to do it.  Miserable piece of human excrement.  Please, let's get rid of this POS.
1322671164632801281 2020-11-01 06:45:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LisaSeaman8 We have designated hours here.  3-7 this year and it's 5:45.  So far zero kids.

The key is to get stuff you don't like.  So far, zero kids here.  As an aside, thanks for keeping the kids safe!
1322654437639364609 2020-11-01 05:39:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Sungirl8 I had a bowl outside with candy but saw a squirrel trying to hit it up so i brought it inside.

1322191830688157698 2020-10-30 23:01:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @M_JClayton Well you know what they say, "When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a bible".  They can't seem to remember we aren't a Christian caliphate and there's way too many guns here.
1322189337233154056 2020-10-30 22:51:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chipfranklin Biden is going to win, right?

1322187634425401346 2020-10-30 22:44:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @The1OnlyRichie @IvankaTrump Vapid, spoiled, delusional, privileged, overrated, faux Jew, fake hair, fake face, fake teeth, extremely poor taste in clothes and zero ability to rein in her sick demented father.  Can't wait to see you go Vanka.  Straight.  To.  Jail.

1321843192879370241 2020-10-29 23:55:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> How did the GDP grow at 33%?  What part of our economy is firing on all cylinders these days?
1321842625666781186 2020-10-29 23:53:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GeorgeTakei I tweet lots of times to people with blue checks after their names and I rarely get a tweet back.  üòï

1321532628978307076 2020-10-29 03:21:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Has there ever been anyone in the WH who whines as much as #45?
1321465673860698115 2020-10-28 22:55:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SharonGibson3 And bottom line: I really don't care.  It's a perfect representation of the ineptitude inherent in everything he touches.  His rally, his people, his responsibility.
1321463278527254528 2020-10-28 22:46:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bchevrier1 I've been around for lots of elections and this is the first and only time I've ever seen or heard that we need armed people there because the "police would be overwhelmed".  Overwhelmed with what?  If the right would stfu, stay home and not intimidate people it would all be ok.
1321462289929785344 2020-10-28 22:42:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @brainrumble It's like northern Wisconsin.  I always say it's the northwoods but the politics are deep south.  I think up there they don't want to be told what to do.  All we have to do is look at the uptick in cases there.  "Oh sure, let's open the bars".
1321461335834722307 2020-10-28 22:38:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RogerSchaeffer3 @martycomroe Most were fine but some were taken to hospitals.  It's the lack of preparation.  How could they not know people would need to be picked up?  Totally sums up the ineptitude inherent in this "administration".
1321458597268754433 2020-10-28 22:27:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @brainrumble I live in a nice, quiet suburb, northern IL.   I don't doubt people here have guns, they just aren't walking down the streets with AR-47's.  When a local grocery store opened here, they had a sign "no guns".  People protested against that.  It was ridiculous.
1321457885923168259 2020-10-28 22:24:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bchevrier1 I think if you need a gun to protect yourself from the government, forget it.  They have nukes.  If you're arming yourself because you're worried about your neighbor, then move.  We have way too many guns in this country.  No other country had a run on guns when covid hit.
1321457470175383555 2020-10-28 22:23:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LkMoller13 He's going to stiff them like he's stiffed everyone else in his wretched life.
1321457018398527490 2020-10-28 22:21:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Firehorsegirly I haven't heard any Biden supporters threatening to hit the streets if he loses.  All the violent rhetoric comes from the right.  If #45 wins again, I'd consider moving to another country.  Between the guns, and the ignorance, this country is going downhill fast.  Stay Safe!!!
1321453526531428354 2020-10-28 22:07:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> WTF is wrong with us?  Who needs a gun to vote?  Or buy food?  Or go to Walmart?  We suck.
1321453075601784834 2020-10-28 22:05:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @martycomroe Ha!!!  Right on.
1321452842356527104 2020-10-28 22:04:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MamaRoseFlowers @PastoReeves Between the cold weather and the virus, maybe some supporters will be picked off - one way or the other.
1321452212887920641 2020-10-28 22:02:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 offered to pay court costs if people were arrested at his rallies for roughing up protestors, will he offer to pay the hospital bills for people left at his rally in freezing weather?  How many went to hospitals?
1321449309498462210 2020-10-28 21:50:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HIHKatharine @Davidsm72 I have to chuckle.  I'm not going to laugh hysterically but it does make me chuckle.  Nobody made them go to the rally.  #45 is an asshole.  He has super spreader rallies and then he leaves people in the cold. Really, I have no sympathy.  None.
1321447413987581952 2020-10-28 21:43:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ericswalwell @inezsneks Nobody forced any of them to go.  I have zero sympathy.  This is how much he cares about his supporters.  First he has them gather for a super spreader event and then he leaves them there.  "It is what it is".  "Thoughts and prayers".  Suck it up idiots.
1321445209281122304 2020-10-28 21:34:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DrDenaGrayson @adgs8 @CNN @JHoganGidley What a dweeb.  "I didn't read it", "I'm not looking at the document", "I didn't write the document".  "I'm telling you what it says".  "Yeah, but I don't trust that you're actually reading what it says".  F`uking gop.
1321270168484483079 2020-10-28 09:58:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @pawman62 I know!  I hear "we're all in this together" and I think, uh..

1321160054863761410 2020-10-28 02:41:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @raybilcliff I'm hoping that number is closer to 35%, but even that is too high.
1321159595184762882 2020-10-28 02:39:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FreezyWriter I have to believe at least *some* of them want a change and are sick and tired of what we have going on right now.

1321128021718372352 2020-10-28 00:34:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ReasonablePer11 I think part of the reason they get away with their cheating is that for the last 12 years, GOP has obstructed just about everything the Dems have tried.  How many bipartisan bills are sitting on McConnell's desk?
1321127526962548737 2020-10-28 00:32:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dancindoti @StevijoPayne Absolutely agree on the EC.  It awards land and not people.  I'm not sure we could go through another candidate winning the popular vote and losing the EC.
1321127071184244737 2020-10-28 00:30:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago He must look terrible underneath his makeup because it's getting thicker and more orange.

1320915041936416768 2020-10-27 10:27:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @acupoker I like how you think!
1320914022892527616 2020-10-27 10:23:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TheRealUSGrant Yeah, that's what I think.  The Dems tend to try and do "the right thing".  They capitulate.  I don't know what they could have really done the last 12 years but I always wanted more.  I wanted to see passion and anger from them.
1320910559185915906 2020-10-27 10:09:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FlippyFlambers Succinctly said.
1320910390147141632 2020-10-27 10:09:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @McCsmith I pretty much agree with everything you said.  Two hurdles: winning the Presidency and taking back the Senate.  And then it's time to really legislate.
1320907114018164737 2020-10-27 09:56:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DerKonigMartin Good point.  The pendulum swings both ways.

1320903189223378944 2020-10-27 09:40:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is it mean and vindictive to think if the Democrats win BIG this election, they should stick it to the GOP like the GOP has done to them for the last 12 years?

1320505448882200576 2020-10-26 07:20:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ddale8 The problem in Wisconsin is that even though the Governor has tried to implement guidelines the Supreme Court continues to overrule the Governor.  In rural areas, people haven't taken it seriously since the beginning.  Sure, let's open bars!  No masks, no social distancing.

1319720689528721410 2020-10-24 03:21:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @justsomeguy2u Same here.  I suppose I'm leading a semi-normal mini-life.
1319720503171493889 2020-10-24 03:21:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Beanz4Blue I hope you're on the mend!!!
1319720050392256512 2020-10-24 03:19:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @baz05397170 You did manage to control it for months though.  They say this is the third surge here.  I haven't been to a restaurant since March.  I always wear a mask when I go out.  I don't see this ending here for at least another year.

1319715637439188992 2020-10-24 03:01:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Nixon68 @branka_jovic @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly Have you ever asked her what #45 has done for her personally?  I talk about this same thing all the time with my older sister.  How can people still support him, we ask.  Only thing we come up with is he hates the same people they hate and they love him for that.

1319711639852208128 2020-10-24 02:45:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hallebangg @lalwahoo @factsb4feels45 @bremonke @branka_jovic @se_vallejos @Brasilmagic @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly My guess is they probably would not support a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy.  I think that's evident by #45's nomination for the SCOTUS.  Also hilarious that they are using that as a reference for not wearing a mask.
1319710813536571393 2020-10-24 02:42:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @waiting_4_11_3 I thought they were free?
1319698422065188865 2020-10-24 01:53:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @basementvegan One of the early ones.  I hope you're feeling lots better!
1319697800309952520 2020-10-24 01:50:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @glennkirschner2 How can any person from any disenfranchised group of people vote for this buffoon?  He insulted the country of India last night.  I sincerely hope the over 3 million people living here from India are not voting for #45.

1319675897750978560 2020-10-24 00:23:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff @Aprylsmithts He actually said it was "gone".  Like, gone gone?
1319673690213240834 2020-10-24 00:15:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PhillyTechGuy @branka_jovic @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly They endanger other women when they vote for candidates who don't believe women can make their own choices.  They endangered us in 2016 when they voted for someone who was an obvious misogynist, xenophobic, racist, slob who encourages people to respond w/violence.
1319672760331870208 2020-10-24 00:11:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sayandlisten Any idea where that was in Wisconsin?  People haven't taken the virus seriously once you get out of the big cities.
1319672564659216387 2020-10-24 00:10:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gigimac211 I'm sure they saw your disgust!  Well done.
1319653526285451264 2020-10-23 22:54:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Numbers28 @MB3252 I'm not even sure he behaved himself.  I want to know how much more he talked than Biden.  He made stupid faces and acted like a petulant little brat.  You're not being harsh at all.
1319652524190781440 2020-10-23 22:50:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Brasilmagic @branka_jovic @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly GOP is willing to sacrifice the Senate for this confirmation.  She's that extreme.

1319651319267950592 2020-10-23 22:46:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @maryma9966 I guess.  That's sad.
1319651077155921922 2020-10-23 22:45:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @branka_jovic @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly So, they have no respect for themselves?  They can't make decisions on their own and need a man to do it for them?  Totally agree that they are actively endangering the rest of us.  I couldn't believe over 50% of WW voted for this rag.  Their husbands/S.O.'s told them to do it?
1319650307211546624 2020-10-23 22:42:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I sincerely hope this is true.  #45 is NOT your friend.  He does NOT care about you or your family.
1319650107483213824 2020-10-23 22:41:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Sigmundine2 @JimCassidy48 That looks like a whole lot of overkill.
1319649729270194178 2020-10-23 22:39:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Why do women like and then vote for #45?

1319646226661412868 2020-10-23 22:25:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @shellpartduex @Endgame2021 Santorum said that Biden got into the gutter last night but #45 didn't???
1319645063438368768 2020-10-23 22:21:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 = Accordion hands.  The bigger the lie, the more he waves those tiny little paws.
1319644493151408130 2020-10-23 22:18:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NancyLeeGrahn @PattyArquette @megynkelly Amazing how many people #45 has trashed publically who run back to stand with him.

1319489553095417857 2020-10-23 12:03:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LarissaNoon @squeekyleaks I was thinking, ok, they are carrying babies in by the scruff of their necks, like cats moving kittens?  Ok fine, but what about the bigger kids?  How do they get here?  You can learn a lot on twitter. üê∫üê∫üê∫

1319468542257991680 2020-10-23 10:39:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FreezyWriter That's really the perfect word for him "asshole".  He really is.
1319468091315769345 2020-10-23 10:38:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 knows only about 32% of Americans have 401Ks, right?  About 55% own stock.  Neither are the economy.
1319467280196112384 2020-10-23 10:34:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 keeps making faces and has his little accordion hands moving.  I'm not sure he's looking any better than he did the first time around.
1319465977789153284 2020-10-23 10:29:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Shut him down for crying out loud.
1319465396550946818 2020-10-23 10:27:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DemWrite @SLori1960 Seriously that should be shoved down his throat every time he brings that up.  Joe is too nice.
1319465128404844544 2020-10-23 10:26:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @matthewamiller @AnitaWade104 And they always have other kids to play with!
1319464506020462592 2020-10-23 10:23:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @cheryllausch He heard me!  He asked!
1319464322276483073 2020-10-23 10:23:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @thinojosa If you look at his shoulders they are twice as wide as Bidens.
1319463969417998338 2020-10-23 10:21:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Why doesn't .@JoeBiden say they couldn't do everything they wanted because of the obstructionist Republicans?  They never had full control like #45 did for two years.
1319462599889702913 2020-10-23 10:16:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Stop already .@kwelkernbc .  You are letting #45 control the time.  Who is the moderator here?
1319462336323854337 2020-10-23 10:15:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @KamZenolay He might be!  üê∫  (A wolf not a coyote, but close).
1319461175818702851 2020-10-23 10:10:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JacquiVotesBlue @maurmadden Ha!!  No, no, it's fine.  I won't say a word.  üòâüéÉüòâ
1319460857856839680 2020-10-23 10:09:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ok, I learned something.  Coyotes are people who bring people across the border.  Not actual coyotes which we have in our neighborhood.
1319460400178528256 2020-10-23 10:07:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @riotwomennn @stshinn @debates Yeah.  #45 is making faces, interrupting, lying and always taking more time.  Trying to make his points with his accordion hands.
1319459654045454338 2020-10-23 10:04:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 didn't really say Coyotes brought kids into the US did he?  Coyotes?
1319458668455383047 2020-10-23 10:00:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @eddies0715 I never did!  But it's perfect.  Those tiny little hands moving in and out drive me crazy.
1319455231894261760 2020-10-23 09:46:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> FFS.  Turn off his mic.
1319453548653039617 2020-10-23 09:40:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> My sister came up with something brilliant.  New name for #45.  "Accordion hands".
1319452882970791936 2020-10-23 09:37:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Shut him down &gt;@kwelkernbc .  FFS.  He looks like a petulant little kid.  He's not being controlled whatsoever.
1319451566538166272 2020-10-23 09:32:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Take control .@kwelkernbc .  #45 is talking twice as much as Biden.
1319449694079246337 2020-10-23 09:24:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Seems like #45 is monopolizing time.  C'mon .@kwelkernbc  you can do better with time.
1319350683263508481 2020-10-23 02:51:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@MSNBC .@KatyTur I don't know what to say in response to Rick Gates.  I just have nothing to say.
1319348909341331456 2020-10-23 02:44:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JaniceClaire14 Yes!  That would be a good one to bring up.  There are so many.

1319347503230308352 2020-10-23 02:38:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RobertaSwinson @HntrBdnsCrckPpe You can't argue with these guys.  They will never change or concede that maybe you have a point.  I'm not a proponent of the bible nor have I read it but I'm pretty sure it says somewhere, let the person who has no faults be the first one to throw a stone.  Or something similar.
1319303549923348480 2020-10-22 23:44:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CatSkeptic @CarlyFiorina Agree it's better they came around but wow, they didn't see this before?  It's not like he's suddenly a different person.
1319302946065100805 2020-10-22 23:41:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mylittlecorne11 I think if Joe went after Ivanka, #45 would flip out.  But Joe probably has too much integrity to do that.  I'd love to see it however.
1319301013149536257 2020-10-22 23:34:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I get what .@CarlyFiorina is saying but she didn't know what a loser he was 4 years ago?  Seems like she voted for #45 in 2016.  I'm glad she came around, but a bit late to the party Carly.
1319300049483026432 2020-10-22 23:30:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MGScott9 That's pretty much what I think.  They are in the government helping to make policy.
1319298602003550209 2020-10-22 23:24:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @snarkgrapefruit Better than putting it in the dishwasher which my husband did the first time I used it.
1319297962468610048 2020-10-22 23:22:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> We knew when #45 brought up Amy Coney Barrett for the SCOTUS, we all knew she'd get the vote.  There was no doubt.
1319297277949845504 2020-10-22 23:19:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TheTrueAmerica5 Once he's gone, we can REALLY party!! #FBRParty  https://t.co/X8PVc1UxGS

1319295878491000832 2020-10-22 23:13:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SethAbramson @focused4USA Did he really have it?
1319294751284318208 2020-10-22 23:09:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SoCalLisaC I absolutely think they need some sort of legislation on nepotism.  And if what he's done isn't in violation of the Emoluments Clause, what is?  Either enforce this stuff or take it off the books.
1319293105145692166 2020-10-22 23:02:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If #45 attacks Hunter Biden, should Joe Biden go after #45's kids?  Ivanka, Eric, Jr. should all be fair game, right?
1319282384869621761 2020-10-22 22:20:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @lrkap That's hilarious!  "wealthy liberal hypocrites".  Uh, what does he think he is, and other members of his administration?  Betsy DeVos?  Ben Carson?  Steve Mnunchin?  Elaine Chao?  He didn't drain the swamp, he filled it up.
1319280274899824649 2020-10-22 22:11:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chrislhayes @OmRJ9 McConnell won't bring anything to the floor for a vote if he retains control and Biden wins.  It will be four years of another stalemate.  Why in the hell does he keep getting elected?  What's he actually done for the people of KY because he hasn't done jack for the country.
1319279324709568512 2020-10-22 22:07:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CricketCrick1 @aguadog @SRuhle Hello beauty.
1319277985002704896 2020-10-22 22:02:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Somehow, it just seems too convenient to be blaming Iran for interfering in our election.  And then saying it hurts #45!  So tonight, that's all we'll hear.  Poor #45, nobody likes him and everyone is trying to hurt him.  Notice how it's taken over the media cycle.
1319277310265020417 2020-10-22 21:59:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MollyJongFast @aguadog @SRuhle 100%!!!!  I know we should hear both sides but we shouldn't have to listen to someone lying.
1319276528769744896 2020-10-22 21:56:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Pickalina1984 @MikeEspyMS @cindyhydesmith I wondered about that too.  Border with other states in America?  What a doofus.
1319274196233576448 2020-10-22 21:47:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Who is this dweeb you have on your show today .@SRuhle? He needs to have his mic muted.  This bozo bucket is trying to convince people that we are better off than we were four years ago????  Oye.  It's not an I shaped recovery you doofus.
1319267713802407936 2020-10-22 21:21:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MysterySolvent He's flashing white power sign?  Liddle Marco has moved on from bible quotes to white power signs?  Are they in the WH?

1319265211552010242 2020-10-22 21:11:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Roshan_Rinaldi @Tina12312 Why?  What's the purpose of this?  .@seanhannity you're a disgusting, despicable person.
1319121149830246401 2020-10-22 11:39:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Can you imagine the face on #45 if .@JoeBiden brings up the "questionable" activities of Ivanka?  He'd go ballistic.
1319119372959494145 2020-10-22 11:32:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Dear .@11thHour :  Brian, by the time your show comes on, we've seen videos of #45 all day long.  Do us all a favor and just select a couple.  Not an hours worth.  Thanks!  Love the show aside from that part.
1319107714736324609 2020-10-22 10:46:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> This is some frightening, scary, unbelievable stuff. üîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩ
1319102034927300611 2020-10-22 10:23:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ducey55 @Timothy00001960 @Lawrence Food channel!
1319097907769937920 2020-10-22 10:07:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ducey55 @Timothy00001960 I'm not sure how any of it's going to work.  If #45 can be obnoxious and interrupt, he will.  meh.  Mute button will be my friend.
1319096593656807424 2020-10-22 10:01:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ducey55 @Timothy00001960 I'm sure I'll be using the mute button which is exactly what .@Lawrence just said.  Simultaneous.  Just like simultaneous muting will be happening across America.

1319094409342930944 2020-10-22 09:53:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NotToday0299 He's trying to kill off Seniors!  And they're his favorite people?  What does he do to the ones who aren't his favorites?
1319094062666964993 2020-10-22 09:51:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FarandWidecom I've been to 14 and the airports of 3 more.
1319047851767463937 2020-10-22 06:48:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Ducey55 @Timothy00001960 I believe it will be muted whenever they have their two minutes.  Just muting it once would be counter productive wouldn‚Äôt it?
1319043761381527558 2020-10-22 06:31:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HumanityForward @GlobalEcho_ Hey .@AndrewYang !  You have tons of cash.  How about putting some towards the Democrats running for the Senate in tight races?
1319043218344939520 2020-10-22 06:29:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @berg25_sheldon @KeithOlbermann @TomJumboGrumbo 10 million dogs, eh.  The two have absolutely nothing to do with each other.  Agree with others who have said this is a rather disturbing tweet.
1319040170352660484 2020-10-22 06:17:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff WTAF is this piece of absolute crap?  The Senate is too busy ramming through a Supreme Court Justice.  Can not wait to see this administration flushed down the toilet where they belong.
1319036853492867076 2020-10-22 06:04:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SharonGibson3 @realDonaldTrump That would be truly worth seeing.
1319035971313217537 2020-10-22 06:00:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kathiepunt8691 Well, the people of KY deserve better, they just have to believe it.  And honestly, if they can't do it for themselves, they should do it for the rest of the country.  I don't get it but KY ranks 45th in education so maybe that's the reason.
1319034722597613568 2020-10-22 05:55:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CAlong2016 Thanks!
1319034195855933441 2020-10-22 05:53:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @swimmerbr78 Oh ffs.  Is .@kayleighmcenany really that dumb or does she just think everyone else is as dumb as #45 cultists?
1319033824186159104 2020-10-22 05:52:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Just the reality that the Senate is going to ram through a SCOTUS Justice BEFORE voting on a stimulus bill is all you need to know about the GOP/McConnell.
1319026529217773572 2020-10-22 05:23:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @politvidchannel @lindagoodliffe Uh why would you?
1319025588724707328 2020-10-22 05:19:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NikkiHaley Hey, Nikki.  I doubt you read these replies but the MAJORITY of them think you are full of it and your candidate is the ABSOLUTE WORST person to ever live in the WH.  You are delusional toots, absolutely delusional.  I thought you were smarter than this but evidently not.
1319024937802366977 2020-10-22 05:17:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Hey .@realDonaldTrump did you know people are going to watch the debate tomorrow because they know and hope you're going to flip out when your mic is silenced.  People just want to see you lose it again on national television.  #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1319023553979781120 2020-10-22 05:11:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TyMurphy19 I try SO hard to not eat after dinner but if I did, it would be pretzels all the way.  Unless there was a bag of BBQ chips.
1319022620566802433 2020-10-22 05:07:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff Is that why he left the interview?
1318970621024493573 2020-10-22 01:41:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Conch_Out Yeah I never(almost never ) watch #45.  I did watch the last one and I was disgusted by #45‚Äôs behavior so I might watch but turn the sound off
1318954174042771457 2020-10-22 00:35:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @tsconza @vegix Emphasis on "anti".
1318953476911714306 2020-10-22 00:33:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @acowan25 Last time, Biden had to shout to be heard because #45 never shut up.
1318953237991575552 2020-10-22 00:32:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RobVarsity3 That's what I usually do.  Seems like people will just watch to see if there's some drama or melt down from #45.  I have to believe most people already made up their mind and/or have voted.
1318952239768227842 2020-10-22 00:28:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @nyoungjl Glorious revenge!
1318951688733077509 2020-10-22 00:26:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MacinEwa @Twitter Rather annoying.
1318950708708888576 2020-10-22 00:22:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is ..@twitter having issues with the "retweet" option?
1318950001284964353 2020-10-22 00:19:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ChrisitnaG @flybry55 Brilliant idea!  I just mute the guy after I hurl various insults.
1318949757247684609 2020-10-22 00:18:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @KevinMulhall I relate.
1318948613192548354 2020-10-22 00:13:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @StevenBeschloss @Liberty2Bfree Time for some investigations into crimes against humanity which this surely is.
1318947862294781952 2020-10-22 00:10:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Will you watch the debate tomorrow night?
1318947544727228416 2020-10-22 00:09:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bridget_joy_ Already voted and put my ballot in the box.  done.
1318942773794529280 2020-10-21 23:50:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @pamgriffa Uh, where's the evidence?
1318942649051713537 2020-10-21 23:50:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JakeSherman @Dgreene11B Let's hope that's true.
1318941664317263873 2020-10-21 23:46:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ramjac1967 @PappyParki Do you have a relative named "Tobin"?  Real question.  I know someone named Tobin Fraley.
1318929313044025346 2020-10-21 22:57:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Elsie_Mandel @NatashaBertrand @rob0349 @JoeBiden I'm not sure the country could survive another 4 years of this chaos.  I know I couldn't.
1318918548689924096 2020-10-21 22:14:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JimiHendrix6is9 @mitchellreports Exactly!  During the 2016 election, she could never bring herself to say anything positive about HRC.  I would have thought she might mention the historical impact but she said nothing.
1318917310510452736 2020-10-21 22:09:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NatashaBertrand @rob0349 Just another reason why .@JoeBiden must win in November.  He can sign off on EO's and reverse this crap.
1318917053152169985 2020-10-21 22:08:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Why does it always seem like .@mitchellreports always has disparaging news for Democrats?
1318908742843486208 2020-10-21 21:35:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ReallyAmerican1 @WolfgangUtten There's no real way to sugar coat this.  #45 is a disgusting, delusional, deplorable person.  He couldn't find his way out of a paper bag let alone lead us out of the multiple crises we face.
1318904213699780608 2020-10-21 21:17:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @collison_edna Yes there is and they are called republicans and like the policy or not, Meghan is still a conservative republican and aside from this policy, she agrees and supports most of the other stuff the GOP does.
1318680369986740225 2020-10-21 06:27:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @politvidchannel Gee .@LindseyGrahamSC .  I know how republicans can win.  Put up a GOOD candidate with policies that help EVERYONE.  But yes, your party won't win until that happens.
1318679692585652225 2020-10-21 06:25:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RyanShead You aren't going to do squat for any of these states .@RealDonaldTrump
1318593881785700359 2020-10-21 00:44:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @cmclymer @MamaBear64 Also, thinking the little green light means "go".
1318593625933156354 2020-10-21 00:43:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NashvilleDeeDee @2020Flush @KingCujo @stevesimeonidis @CityofMiami Thank you!!!  Is the Miami PD to be trusted though? üòâ
1318593123006763008 2020-10-21 00:41:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @richimedhurst @TuxcedoCat Yeah, I'm not so sure.  If #45 loses, maybe he'll resign and Pency will pardon him but if NY prosecutes him, he's on his own.  If he doesn't resign and he is brought up on Federal charges Biden already said there would be no pardon.  We'll see.
1318592203309125633 2020-10-21 00:37:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @2020Flush @KingCujo @stevesimeonidis @CityofMiami Any update on this?
1318590876063551488 2020-10-21 00:32:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FairplayDesigns @AliAdair22 @ArgusC Yeah, but unfortunately there are a hell of a lot.
1318590637013336071 2020-10-21 00:31:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> It's interesting to see the commentators on tv, both men and women, who haven't had haircuts.
1318590231730323457 2020-10-21 00:29:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BulldogBen @yiannisxeno @YoorFired @YorkerTexan @ZenWarrior @Zulu1950 @WarlockWoods @ZACKHAMMER7 @xmarxthespot001 Nicely done!  choooo choooo!
1318589232177434624 2020-10-21 00:25:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JodyAlford17 @disqualify_gop @harrisonjaime This is the perfect race for .@MikeBloomberg .@AndrewYang and .@TomSteyer to infuse with some cash.  Perfect race.
1318578739702280195 2020-10-20 23:44:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @richardmarx I'm not sure he ever had it.
1318577826661097472 2020-10-20 23:40:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ECMcLaughlin @hivelady2018 The "simulation" continued or the "stimulation" continued?
1318577310279368706 2020-10-20 23:38:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @richardmarx @jenscorpio83 Those tiny little hands that he waves around for emphasis.  I can't wait to see those little paws in an orange suit behind bars.
1318575062283321350 2020-10-20 23:29:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JamesSurowiecki @Des_de_mona_ You can open up whatever you want but that doesn't mean people will go.
1318574554265100289 2020-10-20 23:27:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kylegriffin1 @mccompass40 Definitely hope WW have figured out that #45 is not their friend.  He doesn't care about them, their kids or their family.  Unfortunately over 50% of WW voted for him in 2016.  Calling strong, intelligent women "nasty" can't be helping him unless of course you like that talk.
1318571217444536321 2020-10-20 23:14:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @daverpvb @MamaSouth Only the best.
1318570733413466113 2020-10-20 23:12:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bridgetsimonds0 The entire family suffers from delusions!  Eric, you can't be serious.  You just can't be.  Your father is a bully, he uses profanity and calls people names.  I'm reminded of the phrase "you can have your own opinion but not your own facts".  Get with the program .@EricTrump
1318568116692144128 2020-10-20 23:01:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss>  https://t.co/I5ihkBirIL  Isn't it time?
1318561908459474950 2020-10-20 22:37:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @last1yoususpect @louisvirtel She said it more or less, not necessarily in that order.
1318559453638176775 2020-10-20 22:27:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MichelleResists I think one of the groups he's turned off the most are women.  I never understood how WW could vote for him in 2016 over 50% of the time.  Calling strong intelligent women "nasty" isn't helping him.  We'll see but I am hoping, maybe against all hope, that WW have figured it out.
1318558538030002176 2020-10-20 22:23:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BUZZNET I love seeing this stuff but I don't want to go through 50 pictures to see how they ended up.
1318558269888233472 2020-10-20 22:22:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jomareewade @lfkraus @B52Malmet @DarkMoneyDt @ScarletAvengers @DemocracyStorm @KidCasteel @TrinityResists @SallyDeal4 @TheSWPrincess @LunaLuvgood2020 It's only fair if #45 gets everything he wants all the time.  And even then he'd find something to whine about.
1318555706782633985 2020-10-20 22:12:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CNNSotu @CrankyCrone1 I if rank and file GOP'ers are in line with .@MichaelSteele .  The effectively pushed him out of his RNC Chairman position after he had raised huge amounts of money for them.  Will his endorsement mean that much?
1318554472105283584 2020-10-20 22:07:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> We got our mail in ballots two weeks ago and yesterday I dropped off three ballots at the local polling place.  "D" all the way down the ticket.  I shouldn't have to listen to any more political ads.  üòâ
1318549680951799810 2020-10-20 21:48:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @louisvirtel Oh ffs.  "My father LOVES gay people and he always has and he's not doing it for politics".  Yeah, right.  Suggest Tiff take a look at some of the legislation he has pushed through or signed as an EO.
1318328780163862529 2020-10-20 07:10:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @snapdaily05 @mojojaxville He just seems too robust.  Unless it's all steroids?  It somehow doesn't add up but who knows and *that* part is even worse!!  We have no clue.  We have no idea who is telling the truth and who isn't!
1318328445571682304 2020-10-20 07:09:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @wmcoale @Faith_Salie Indeed it does!
1318328345017372672 2020-10-20 07:09:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @therealpeterm @occupybergennj Yeah, he doesn't know.
1318327927818342401 2020-10-20 07:07:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> You didn't know what that little green light meant?  Uh, .@JeffreyToobin , it didn't mean "go".
1318300301787615234 2020-10-20 05:17:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DonteNeil @LeighMelone Most likely an emphasis on the latter.
1318296069277626368 2020-10-20 05:00:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ivery5000 @mojojaxville This makes sense.  It just seems like he's way too chipper way too soon.
1318295346238324736 2020-10-20 04:57:57 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LeighMelone Exactly!  And now he's prancing around saying "it's no big deal".
1318294850790395905 2020-10-20 04:55:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MollyBloom10 @mojojaxville I thought he said he wasn't on any drugs at least a week ago.  But we'll never know.
1318291415185657860 2020-10-20 04:42:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @elsa6bean @counselorSusanr Crashing hard seems appropriate.
1318290670889717760 2020-10-20 04:39:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LeftHandOfCat @Berlidge Ha!!!!  I had to read that twice.  Good one.
1318287954817785858 2020-10-20 04:28:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @pennyrucker1 I know!  Right???
1318287757853315072 2020-10-20 04:27:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sharonedge And this is a huge problem!  We only know that we don't know and that we can't trust anyone.
1318286058380021760 2020-10-20 04:21:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Did #45 *really* have Covid?
1317931880210104320 2020-10-19 04:53:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HeshimuK @petehasabeard Not even a gnats eyelash!!!!  Love it!!!
1317921804388794369 2020-10-19 04:13:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Supermom1242 @mom20886 There's so much where we could continue to grow as a country.  So much ground to cover when it comes to bringing ur country in line with other industrialized nations.  We don't have someone right now who has that vision.  He only wants to enrich himself &amp; stay out of jail.
1317908264164728835 2020-10-19 03:19:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mom20886 Yah I do!
1317907507382202376 2020-10-19 03:16:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mom20886 If he actually "made America great again" why is he still saying it after 4 years?  Sounds like he lied about that too.
1317903718596136961 2020-10-19 03:01:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Everything is expendable with #45.  He goes to a rally in some city and says he'll never be back if he loses that city.  He says he'll leave America if he loses.  I thought he LOVED America so much?
1317853918903308294 2020-10-18 23:43:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @oldsargepap @JaneVoter2018 He'd be so embarrassed at the loss, he'd have to leave the country he supposedly loves and wants to make great.  He has no plan, so leaving would be no loss for the rest of us.  But I'm not alone in hoping he won't be able to leave because he'll be in jail where he belongs.
1317851897173344256 2020-10-18 23:35:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TrueFactsStated @Nancabell That's a big motorcade.  Who is in all those cars?

1316846197282344961 2020-10-16 04:59:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TrackingSatoshi I tend to agree with this.  At first I thought it was people who were dependent on social services but now it seems to be everyone.
1316831527242813443 2020-10-16 04:01:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Interesting that #45 keeps having rallies in places where the Corona virus numbers are rising.  He's trying to kill off his followers?

1316755891874598913 2020-10-15 23:00:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Davisonbob No surprise.  At the beginning of this, two counties in Northern Wisconsin asked snowbirds to wait to come back because they just don't have the beds in intensive care to take care of hundreds of people.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did something similar again.
1316754918888345600 2020-10-15 22:56:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @starkey_re There were places in Northern Wisconsin that never closed down.  The local bar had people elbow to elbow right from the start and as recent as a few weeks ago.  Ready to think of WI as the "you can't make me" state.
1316749030496579584 2020-10-15 22:33:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I love Wisconsin but there's a huge swath of people who aren't taking Covid Virus seriously.  Do you really need to sit elbow to elbow in a bar?  Really?

1316392731829243904 2020-10-14 22:57:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> This hearing is a waste of time.  Yes, it offers Dems an opportunity to tell America they are going to lose their health care and women are going to lose their right to choose but beyond that, meh.  She's going to be on the SCOTUS regardless of what she says.  It's a done deal.

1316388371581882369 2020-10-14 22:40:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Amy Coney Barrett doesn't know that a president can't delay an election?  Really?  oy.
1316387857695756291 2020-10-14 22:38:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @thomaskaine5 @Lnewman16Lee The people of KY have a chance to set this right.  But will they?  After 30+ years of Mitch, you'd think they were tired of this crap, but are they.  We'll see.
1316387382028103685 2020-10-14 22:36:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JeffFlake @Firestorm1776 Yes, but that's the thing, your party ISN'T better than this.  This is who your party is.  It's disgusting and even you know that.   There is NO GOP.  It's now the party of trump.

1316145481240715266 2020-10-14 06:35:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @isaac_capt Can we assume by the early voting, it's primarily Democratic?
1316145081850695680 2020-10-14 06:33:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RealCaptainTony Ha!  Good one.  I'm sure even Keanu Reeves would approve.

1316130604963037185 2020-10-14 05:36:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @homeatlast9 Given voting has already started in 40 states, will it make a difference?
1316114194270498823 2020-10-14 04:30:50 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AriesSunGoddess Good catch.  I thought maybe it was the same dress as yesterday because it was her lucky dress.
1316090340076650496 2020-10-14 02:56:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @justsomeguy2u I like Obama for that position.    What's the actual procedure to do that however?  If they need 3/4 of Congress or the Senate to approve that, it might still be a very long shot.
1316089867475005440 2020-10-14 02:54:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @whec65 I live in a fairly enlightened community so I don't encounter it with neighbors or friends.  I was in Northern Wisconsin a few weeks ago w/lots of signs for #45.  Came home and saw a load of Biden/Harris signs.  I was like, whew, I'm home.

1316087357364482052 2020-10-14 02:44:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @whec65 One might think their constituents would be on the phones with them.  Unfortunately their people at home might still be thinking the ACA and Obamacare are two different things.
1316086591153213441 2020-10-14 02:41:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Storm92771136 Good point.  I'm not sure that's going to save her, but I never thought of that.  We'll have to see if any others vote no to save themselves.
1316086206346792963 2020-10-14 02:39:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sobotka_paul That's what I think.  They are willing to sacrifice the Senate to jam this nomination through.  She'll give them everything they've always wanted.

1316031284154638337 2020-10-13 23:01:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> GOP has been frothing at the mouth with the prospect of installing someone in the SCOTUS who will overturn Roe V: Wade and the ACA specifically.  They are willing to sacrifice the Senate to do it.  No covid relief, no infrastructure, just more conservative judges.

1315760707707768832 2020-10-13 05:06:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jilevin @cursinggourmet @SenateGOP They are salivating over the opportunity to overturn Roe V: Wade and the ACA specifically.  They are evidently willing to sacrifice the Senate to make it happen.

1315725249883901952 2020-10-13 02:45:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @the_ericyates Speculation is speculation.  Stick to the facts.  GOP has stacked the court.  McConnell wouldn't allow PBO to nominate Garland or other Federal court judges.  He LAUGHED ABOUT IT.  Facts, not supposition.  Do you think PBO didn't want to nominate 194 judges?  Really?
1315724192155918336 2020-10-13 02:41:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @amyklobuchar The GOP is salivating over the prospect of putting someone on the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe V: Wade and the ACA specifically.  They are willing to sacrifice the Senate to make it happen.

1315719743597404161 2020-10-13 02:23:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JoyAnnReid @pmweisser I thought it was hilarious that .@JoeBiden was asked if he would be "packing the courts".  Are there any federal judgeships left to fill?  Will the Dems, if they take control, will they expand the SCOTUS to 11 or 13 members?  They seem to play softball, unfortunately.
1315718447779786753 2020-10-13 02:18:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AmoneyResists GOP does not know how to govern.  They are experts at obstructing however.  And changing the rules.
1315717940294176768 2020-10-13 02:16:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @the_ericyates Unfortunately, Dems tend to play soft ball.  They tend to capitulate.  I wish they'd play the same game as the republicans.  We'll see what kind of mischief the gop comes up with when Dems have control.  So yeah, wait.
1315717312855580673 2020-10-13 02:13:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DWUhlfelderLaw Nobody MAKES people go to the rally.  They should sign a waiver that says if they get sick with Covid, they waive all rights to medical care.  If the Mayor says don't come, they shouldn't be allowed to go.

1315644752893816832 2020-10-12 21:25:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ecgarcia6314 Nobody has ever said this is "unconstitutional" or "unlawful".  It lacks integrity and goes against everything the gop said with respect to Garland.  I imagine if the tables were turned you'd be just as angry if the Dems were ramming through a nominee.  Integrity.  Fairness.

McConnell wouldn't let PBO appoint federal judges and laughed about it.  There's something called integrity and the gop lacks it.  Unfortunately, the dems play fair and the gop doesn't.
1315641525443977216 2020-10-12 21:12:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Obviously Eric doesn't remember Merrick Garland, packing the courts, an impeached president a rampant pandemic or the absolute hypocrisy of the GOP. üîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩ

1315638883145723904 2020-10-12 21:02:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ecgarcia6314 Figure that out yourself maga.
1315455218604216321 2020-10-12 08:52:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @yogi35898 @AngrierWHStaff @VileEpiphany I feel like the UP is untapped uncharted territory.  I lived my entire life in Illinois and never knew there were mountains in Michigan.

I love the remoteness of the UP however so its a loss but Ill stay home for now in my bubble.
1315422266759540737 2020-10-12 06:41:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bridgetsimonds0 Yes, every now and then I run across someone who has blocked me.  Like you, I think, wtf did I do?  But then, life goes on.
1315421861388394499 2020-10-12 06:39:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff @VileEpiphany I think they should hit up every state actually.  I doubt either candidate has been to the UP of Michigan or the northwoods of Wisconsin.  Those rural areas are largely forgotten and suffer the most.

If you‚Äôre a Dem in a red state you feel like your vote doesn‚Äôt matter.  W/the popular vote, every vote matters.  If GOP wants to win maybe they need candidates that appeal to everyone.

1314290292669976583 2020-10-09 03:43:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @christina_bobb @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The idiot doesn't need anyone to harm him, or make him look like an imbecile, he does that all on his own.  About time somebody talked about removing him from office.  He's DANGEROUS.  Name calling is so 1st grade.  Hopefully you don't teach that kind of behavior to your kids.
1314264627757355010 2020-10-09 02:01:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bblock29 @kskm126_susan He should be tried too as an accessory to the crime.  He instigated this.  What an absolute POS he is.

1314026043305529352 2020-10-08 10:13:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #VPDebate did Pence really say #45 believed in separation of powers?  That's hilarious!!!
1314005008761921536 2020-10-08 08:49:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @666k9s Me too!  I think she's going to be a superstar.
1313989637283762176 2020-10-08 07:48:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ecthompsonmd I know!  Right?  I really hope the good people of WI are going to vote Democrat because the GOP has done nothing for them.  It's a beautiful state but parts of it need to come into the 21st century.

1313985971004866562 2020-10-08 07:34:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Oh yeah Scott Walker, if the Covid response is so great, what the hell is wrong with Wisconsin?  Could it be the Supreme court of WI overturning the mask mandate the Governor put in place?  Maybe mixed messaging?  Maybe the "you can't make me" mentality of Wisconsin?

1313949122563641358 2020-10-08 05:07:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @thomaskaine5 @TeamBiden2 Already did.  I'm taking it to a drop off location tomorrow.

1313859362323075072 2020-10-07 23:10:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> How long before we start hearing about the "war on christmas"?

Are you that out of touch?  You do realize not EVERY woman in America is a christian right?  Can't you say something original?  Do you think quoting a book of fiction works?
1313857226344464385 2020-10-07 23:02:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @4a_of I'm still holding out for Jarvanka.

1313666214359638016 2020-10-07 10:23:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff Even with the 666 on his forehead.
1313666100182372353 2020-10-07 10:22:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff It's a big deal that the Joint Chiefs are in quarantine, right?
1313661907614806017 2020-10-07 10:06:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is there any possibility we will have a clear winner on November 3rd?
1313661415211896833 2020-10-07 10:04:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Teri_Kanefield @alissagal8 We should NOT have to go through this to vote!  It should be easy.  Your sentiment however, is hopeful and appreciated.
1313660841888276481 2020-10-07 10:02:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @shaithis I didn't know that. Interesting.

1313656504025862144 2020-10-07 09:44:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Let's say there's no decision election night and #45 sends it to the courts.  On January 20th, if we still have no winner does Nancy Pelosi become President?
1313654631994658816 2020-10-07 09:37:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PalmerReport We need the United Nations to come in and investigate this.

1313501436723040264 2020-10-06 23:28:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @essenviews @Sseals07 I have NO idea!!! WTAF???  What's even more concerning is that his family doesn't seem to care.  If that were my husband/father, I'd be getting him some intensive care.
1313500564483911682 2020-10-06 23:25:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Heeee Hawww!  My mail in ballot is in the mail and I'm going to vote FOR .@JoeBiden and every democrat down ballot.  Hurrah.
1313499779880701952 2020-10-06 23:22:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RhutaBhayga2 @lbridges1212 There's a tweet for every season.  One has to wonder if he realizes he's being a complete hypocrite.  And if he knows, he probably doesn't care.
1313498784035475456 2020-10-06 23:18:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CupkakeSpark But he also walked up those flights of stairs.  So maybe that was why he was out of breath?  Having said that, I'm not sure how someone recovers that quickly.  He should be sicker.  (fingers crossed).
1313496256937893890 2020-10-06 23:08:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JohnRMoffitt Maybe he's next.
1313495390151421954 2020-10-06 23:04:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Does #45 really have Covid?
1313325116030320640 2020-10-06 11:48:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I think there's an hour available for "Claudia Conway".  She seems to be the most credible journalist out there.
1313324705387028480 2020-10-06 11:46:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> What #45 has done successfully is suck the air out of every other story.  He's controlling the narrative, like he always does.
1313289634974228482 2020-10-06 09:27:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SweetFnLucifer @CalmGenius53 Oh boy.  That's quite a visual.
1313286322237460480 2020-10-06 09:13:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Beulahmo @bejaha I wonder what it was!
1313278869252775936 2020-10-06 08:44:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @petehasabeard @Lilliancphmco Interesting.  And evidently, he is on drugs.  Good catch.

1313276767872970752 2020-10-06 08:35:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @EZernichow @GiuliaCesare2 @MSNBC @CNN And .@CNN has on Rick Santorum!!!  And Corey Lewandowski!!!  I watch them during the day when Andrea Mitchell and Chuck-Deer-Caught-In-The-Headlights-Todd is on.

1313250403878920192 2020-10-06 06:51:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @just_cd @Surfcityslicker @MSNBC Right.  Deathly ill.
1313250203907035142 2020-10-06 06:50:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MLottawa342 @CNN We‚Äôre actually in the suburbs.  So those rules don‚Äôt apply.  We do know of an 85 y.o. Woman who went to Wisconsin from Illinois early on and her neighbor called the local police and told them she didn‚Äôt quarantine.  They picked her up at the local Save More!
1313241792117190663 2020-10-06 06:16:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DoeKaty @GiuliaCesare2 @MSNBC Exactly.
1313240980393545728 2020-10-06 06:13:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HappyHermit2020 @MSNBC This will probably be the only time in his life he's on time for something.
1313240781961007116 2020-10-06 06:12:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MORDE110 @MSNBC Exactly.  And he controls the media yet again.  That part really annoys me.  They allow it to happen.  Show us the arrival on the 10:00 news and call it a day.
1313240385553141766 2020-10-06 06:11:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HappyHermit2020 @MSNBC Exactly.
1313239949437739008 2020-10-06 06:09:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LCattheBeach @MSNBC Yeah me either.   I'll switch to the tennis channel or the food channel.
1313238623467319300 2020-10-06 06:04:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Dear .@MSNBC You're going to televise #45 leaving the hospital and going back to the WH, right?  He's controlling you yet again.  Shiny apple, you fall for it every single time.
1313234950204854272 2020-10-06 05:49:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Rschooley @UniteBlueMN I sincerely hope it's not plastered on every single media outlet.  Wouldn't it be nice if there was no coverage?  Why cover this scam and give it credibility?
1313230431043686401 2020-10-06 05:31:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is #45 going to quarantine once he gets back to the WH for ten days?
1313229957028552705 2020-10-06 05:29:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MLottawa342 @CNN I often stop at the Target in SP on my way north.
1313229834030637065 2020-10-06 05:29:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MLottawa342 @CNN That's exactly what I figured would happen.  The hospitals in Oneida for example probably couldn't handle 20 intensive care patients let alone 200.  Interesting about Triggs.  Maybe during the summer there are more tourists in Minocqua.  I was happy to see it but the bars? nope.
1313221740638724102 2020-10-06 04:57:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DannyAShea @ps9714 @glangendorf01 100%!
1313221288807329792 2020-10-06 04:55:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MLottawa342 @CNN I saw masks at the local Triggs in Minocqua.  I'd say maybe 95% of the people had them on.  In our small little town the bars were open, the restaurants were open and nobody was wearing a mask.  I'm supposed to go back next week but now I'm not sure.
1313180616817553414 2020-10-06 02:13:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RuthsFiance @ps9714 Oh good one!  I missed that fascist on my list.
1313180457287266305 2020-10-06 02:13:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ps9714 @glangendorf01 I may be a cruel and heartless person, but I'm holding out for Ivanka and Jared.  Then Jr and Eric.  Then the rest of the kids.
1313180010128322561 2020-10-06 02:11:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Did Mark Meadows have an Alexander-I-Am-In-Charge-Here-Haig moment?
1313176193148039170 2020-10-06 01:56:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CharlesMBlow @jovibon7 Peace and light to his spirit.
1313175840419647490 2020-10-06 01:54:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Gee, .@CNN.  Do you think maybe #45's rallies are part of the problem in #Wisconsin?  And by the way, I spent lots of time in WI this summer/autumn and by and large people were not wearing masks and not taking the virus seriously.  I'd have to add this was in rural WI.
1313149085940154369 2020-10-06 00:08:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @duty2warn @MichelleHillie7 None of them care.
1313131020741423104 2020-10-05 22:56:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AdrienneC123 @jankybrain Good point!
1313130663705563136 2020-10-05 22:55:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jankybrain That makes sense.
1313130492624097283 2020-10-05 22:54:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LittleBlkDres If it's worse than we're being told, how is he able to tweet, take a ride, sit at a desk and sign a fake something or other and be released probably today?  Why do you think it's worse?  I'm not arguing w/you, I'm just curious why you think that.
1313128637273640962 2020-10-05 22:47:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @wernerkeil @TekStol @GOP I thought it was real because there didn't seem to be a way that #45 would not go to three rallies willingly.  But now I'm not so sure.  Maybe the other Senators really have it but I'm not convinced #45 has it.  That's sort of consistent w/his lying all the time about everything.
1313121846200541189 2020-10-05 22:20:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @KwikWarren @holmes_62 Everything he touches withers and dies.  Now it's Walter Reed.
1313118862657847297 2020-10-05 22:08:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Do you think #45 really has Covid?  Is this all just a stunt?
1313115175856242689 2020-10-05 21:53:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Lnewman16Lee Thoughts and prayers little dude, thoughts and prayers.
1313114132053360645 2020-10-05 21:49:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kurteichenwald @DaikonForTurnip WTF is wrong with the hospital personnel?  Isn't a hospital designated a "QUIET ZONE"?  Get the local cops to clear the area.  It's stupid stuff.  Nobody can JUST SAY NO to the idiot.  He had the area cleared quickly enough when he wanted to hold up a bible for a photo op.
1313113380891381760 2020-10-05 21:46:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @girlsreallyrule @crazyycatlady1 He doesn't know how to uncap his tweets.
1313110687737098243 2020-10-05 21:35:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dbongino The tragedy of #45's administration is that we even are talking about this stuff.  None of this is "fake" news.  Don't be an asshole.  We all saw this.  All of us.
1312935502144835585 2020-10-05 09:59:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @rushmc @MerileeParis @CNN This might be a level past crazy.
1312933150637649920 2020-10-05 09:50:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Rosie @findmeupnorth11 Absurd and amazingly irresponsible.  Is he really sick?  Is he mentally inable of making good decisions?  Why did they let someone in "quarantine" get into a car with other people?  Something ain't right.
1312930895322591233 2020-10-05 09:41:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AnonaMoose58 I think people thought that four years ago.
1312930531722645506 2020-10-05 09:40:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MerileeParis @CNN It's totally nuts.  It makes no sense but that does sound like standard #45.
1312897444456411139 2020-10-05 07:28:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Based on #45's joy ride, does he really have the virus or is he incapable of making sound decisions?
1312895102260576257 2020-10-05 07:19:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Craig_A_Spencer @Barbafarout This is so irresponsible.  Who would have approved such a move?  Is he or isn't he in "quarantine"?  He's contaminated, why is he riding in a vehicle with people?  Who signed off on this one?
1312894345763328001 2020-10-05 07:16:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @NancyStitt11 I think if you really think about it, the nasty one in this race is and has always been #45.  You support a misogynistic, racist, bigoted, xenophobic, but sure tell me how mean Biden has been.  Get a life.
1312882777763741697 2020-10-05 06:30:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Does this point to a scam?  Is he really sick?  How could he break protocol like that? üîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩüîΩ

1312880071204536321 2020-10-05 06:19:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> What kind of a poor sap makes people drive him around knowing he is contaminated with a virus just so he can wave to people?  Can't anyone ever say NO TO HIM?  Ever? #SecretService
1312867385230135296 2020-10-05 05:29:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @2000Schick He's bad in a different way I think.  Members of Congress aren't afraid of him the way they are scared of #45.  Would he turn America into a Christian caliphate if he could?  Hell yes.
1312866466262388736 2020-10-05 05:25:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Jperk70 @CliffYaffe @Scaramucci @beanveron Surely you aren't saying #45 has been kind and gentle?  Surely you hear him call people names and make fun of them.  Is that how you teach your kids to behave or is that how you behave?  Who are these elites you speak of?  Like the billionaires and millionaires in #45's circle?

Have you ever heard Joe Biden call #45 a name or call anyone a derogatory name?  Ever?  Have you ever seen him make fun of anyone?  That‚Äôs hilarious.  Thanks for the laugh.
1312836916656705540 2020-10-05 03:28:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MysterySolvent I definitely laughed at this picture.  What a bunch of characters this administration has spawned.

1312783235789791232 2020-10-04 23:54:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Do you still think that #45 is the "leader of the free world"?
1312781160121085954 2020-10-04 23:46:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PoCoAustinPa @hillofkansas He would but if we are to believe his docs, they are all saying he's doing well and if he continues to improve he'll be released tomorrow so doubt he can use this as an excuse.
1312779684942413825 2020-10-04 23:40:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Karoli @DA4Pups I bet he claims to be pro-life.

1312776346406395907 2020-10-04 23:27:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @IvankaTrump You're kidding right?  If he wasn't in the hospital he'd be on the golf course where he's been almost 300 times in 4 years.  I used to feel sorry for you, but now?  You're as bad as the rest of the family.  You should look divine in orange.  toots.

1312510353356406785 2020-10-04 05:50:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AngrierWHStaff It'd be a good sign that they really are on board if Meadows put his mask up over his nose.  But, yeah.  Not.
1312509673497526272 2020-10-04 05:47:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chipfranklin Because Mother said "not so fast".
1312508998839496705 2020-10-04 05:45:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chipfranklin At the very least, anyone who was infected because of his negligence should be given the same amount of care he's being given.  And then they should sue him.
1312506985472950272 2020-10-04 05:37:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @marwilliamson @harleyandmackie This guy needs to be arrested.  WTAF is wrong with people.
1312506506491752448 2020-10-04 05:35:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Between the actual news, the commercials about sick kids and abused animals, I'm just about ready to read a book.
1312506227306360832 2020-10-04 05:34:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CheryClshore It's entirely possible Trudeau didn't politicize the mask the way #45 did.  Also, quite possible Canadians trust their government whereas in America we don't.  It's ridiculous, dangerous and is the reason we can't go anywhere.  Nobody wants us.
1312464313324429312 2020-10-04 02:47:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @koan4u @ButterflyLove_8 It hasn't been safe for the last four years.

1312463281806741505 2020-10-04 02:43:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SenatorChrisSly @sweeettweetie @SethAbramson Yikes!!!
1312462726443143168 2020-10-04 02:41:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> There's a certain irony here. #45 is getting top notch care that we'd never get.  We're paying for that care at the very time he's pushing through a SCOTUS justice that wants to take our health care away and he's being treated for a virus he said was a hoax. Now it's the plague.
1312460743598456833 2020-10-04 02:33:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> So now it's a PLAGUE but before #45 became contaminated it was just a hoax or the flu.
1312458129381093377 2020-10-04 02:22:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kathrynresister yeah, no.  maybe.  sometimes.
1312456396261081088 2020-10-04 02:16:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MrJonCryer @kahluaandrum I really have to wonder, what were they thinking?  Evidently getting a Supreme Court Justice who agrees with them is worth more to them than their own lives or the lives of the kids who were there.  Big, big shame on them.
1312417675897974790 2020-10-03 23:42:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Would any of us get a team like the one #45 has?  The team WE are paying for because he has a virus he said for months was a hoax.
1312410802310217728 2020-10-03 23:14:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @morethanmySLE @dbble5 It's amazing to me that as recent as this week they were having super spreader events.  Did they think the virus would skip them?  It's just amazing stupidity.  Thank you for everything you do Peter!
1312410137123000321 2020-10-03 23:12:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DeeReilly19 @lesleyabravanel I hope the good people of Florida will do us all a favor and vote Rick Scott out at the first opportunity.  You can do it!
1312409663888031745 2020-10-03 23:10:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJawetz @Mrsdaig @VP He's pro zygote.  I think over the last four years we've been able to witness that the GOP only cares about controlling women.  They are hardly pro life.
1312409273163538434 2020-10-03 23:08:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BadASSSery @JanineBliss Was he really the head of the task force?  What did he ever do or say?  Agree that he should be in quarantine and maybe others in the line of succession should also quarantine.  What a mess but that's what you get when the GOP is "in control".
1312408414702710785 2020-10-03 23:05:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @lesleyabravanel @DeeReilly19 Must be time to vote into the Senate again, or maybe he can be governor again.  Good grief!  People of Florida, wake up!  Get out of the sun!

People made the choice to NOT wear a mask.  I suppose what is most amazing is that this many people are that stupid.  Maybe they'll all be infected.
1312236526433165313 2020-10-03 11:42:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DrIanWeissman @RodneyClaeys 3 million minks are farmed every year.  I didn't know that many people were still wearing fur!

1312221596556374016 2020-10-03 10:43:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AGabstonHowell Plus, I was mostly curious to see how people would respond.
1312221346684956675 2020-10-03 10:42:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AGabstonHowell I think you have to take the question at face value: "will you pray ... "  If I was responding to the question I'd probably say "hell no" which many people said.  I cringe when I hear people say "thoughts and prayers" so perhaps the question grew from that.
1312199890345160704 2020-10-03 09:16:48 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @stingmiller He seemed slimer somehow.  The physique seemed off.
1312198550739013632 2020-10-03 09:11:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AGabstonHowell The better question is how do you perceive it?
1312197889641213953 2020-10-03 09:08:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Was that really #45 they took to Walter Reed or was it a body double?
1312174396061052928 2020-10-03 07:35:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @metroadlib I thought he was kind of old school, tightly wound but over the last couple of years, I've really come to appreciate his wisdom and perspective.  Definitely don't hate him.

1312152489572016128 2020-10-03 06:08:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> It sure is taking him a long time to pack up his phone and leave.

1311712555790983168 2020-10-02 01:00:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> He probably does!  ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
1311692095573446657 2020-10-01 23:39:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MariaCuomoCole @Trumpgot2go @KingJames I love how athletes are speaking out and offering help.  We need more of this.

1311687371864375297 2020-10-01 23:20:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @johnpavlovitz The violence and threat of violence seems to be coming mostly from the party that's supposedly "Pro Life" and "Pro Family Values".  How did they get so corrupted?  Was it just percolating waiting for the right guy (#45) to appear and give them credibility?
1311686239884660744 2020-10-01 23:15:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MADELWELL I just muted it.  I'm pretty sure it isn't real.  And if it is real, wow.  Not worth the bandwidth like I said.
1311685808546607105 2020-10-01 23:14:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MADELWELL She can't because there isn't any proof.  If Biden or HRC were guilty of any crime there'd be an investigation or they would have already been found guilty.  Look at her timeline, she has something there that says the proud boys aren't real.  That speaks volumes.  Delusional.

1311375490079494144 2020-10-01 02:40:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is there anyone alive who actually thinks #45 is spiritual or religious?
1311367936230281217 2020-10-01 02:10:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PerkinsJanie @BillKristol We all would have loved a time out for the idiot.
1311364835783962627 2020-10-01 01:58:35 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillKristol @PerkinsJanie It seemed to me that Chris Wallace's questions to Biden were slightly hostile and he felt like he had to be "kind" to #45.  He even giggled at one point while asking a question.  He was an abject failure.
1311363293915815941 2020-10-01 01:52:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @johnpavlovitz @JMPeck69 @realDonaldTrump I wonder if that "stand by" remark was actually supposed to be "stand down" and #45 being as dumb as a rock thought he was saying something positive instead of something that seals the deal for people who say he's a racist slug.

1311316593033572353 2020-09-30 22:46:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HC_Richardson @ArmChairGrandma Seriously, I hope so.  Given WW voted for #45 over 50% of the time in 2016, I'm HOPING they have learned that he does NOT care about them, their kids, or their family.  I'll believe it when I see it and I damn well better see it in 2020 or we are collectively screwed.

1311311100697366528 2020-09-30 22:25:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is there anyone on #45's team who hasn't partaken of the kool aid?  Do they all wear tin foil hats?
1311139984355864576 2020-09-30 11:05:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @michaelharriot @MrRaulJenkins I would have paid $5 to hear that!
1311136667013648390 2020-09-30 10:51:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Notice how #45 could never quite come up with a plan on anything?  He could only attack.  He could only speculate.   He has NO plan.  None.
1311134928424271874 2020-09-30 10:45:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@FoxNewsSunday You did a piss poor job Chris Wallace.

1311115475833835521 2020-09-30 09:27:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ok .@FoxNewsSunday turn off his microphone.  #45 can't shut his mouth.  Honestly, maybe moderator needs that option.
1311112018334752768 2020-09-30 09:13:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Trump_Detester @Suzee5335 Thank you for feeling our pain!  And it's painful.
1311111555212365826 2020-09-30 09:12:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ok, get mad now .@JoeBiden .  Speak up, don't let the guy walk all over you.  Don't let him speak over you.
1311110876192215040 2020-09-30 09:09:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Look into the camera .@JoeBiden .  Talk to us not whomever is on the side you are looking at.

1311110290847805440 2020-09-30 09:07:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Yeah, I had to mute him after three words.

1310804310217850882 2020-09-29 12:51:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Randalsnyder3 @AnnieGabstonH Totally agree.  We all stand to lose with a court that will take us back 100 years.  They've been salivating over this for years.
1310793016811180032 2020-09-29 12:06:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AnnieGabstonH They‚Äôre hoping to overturn Roe v: Wade and it seems like they‚Äôre willing to risk everything, even the Senate to get that.
1310785497891995649 2020-09-29 11:36:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @johnpavlovitz This will be a lost year for all of us.  The kids will talk to their kids about it like our parents or grandparents talked about the depression.

1310353841708244994 2020-09-28 07:01:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Rosie @maurmadden This confirms what we already knew:  he's a cheat and avoids paying taxes.  It's always fake news with him.  Everyone lies but him.  Everyone is a crook but him.  The narrative never changes.
1310353202769006592 2020-09-28 06:58:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ddanpereira I think we are exactly who we appear to be.  One third of us wants to kill off another one third of us while one third watches.  I didn't come up with this on my own however.

1310316654845362178 2020-09-28 04:33:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @matthewjdowd @cynajane Media also does not know how to deal with a pathological liar. In 2016, Morning Joe had #45 on every single day.  They didn't talk policy, they just schmoozed and Mika giggled a lot.  It was truly pathetic.  Really wish Media would stick to *reporting* news and not *making* news.

1309866765787242496 2020-09-26 22:45:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BettyBowers @LindstromCheryl See that's the thing.  I'm fairly sure that there's a whole swath of people in this country who DON'T think this is a secular republic.  They want it to be a Christian caliphate.  We have christianity shoved down our throats on a daily basis.  Daily basis.

1309537996140666881 2020-09-26 00:59:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Darinstrauss Totally agree but they don‚Äôt need to focus on it hour after hour.  Same with #45 saying he won‚Äôt consent to a peaceful transition.  We talked about that for two days.  He‚Äôs the one who controls the narrative.  I think the media can do better.
1309531497372807170 2020-09-26 00:33:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 is doing what he does best: controlling the narrative.  Why, for example, does the media continue to talk about his "baseless claims" of voter fraud?  If it's baseless, stop talking about it.  Easy peasy.

They've put doubt into our minds. I don't trust the CDC, the FDA, anyone on #45's administration, the election, the post office.  Are we officially lawless?
1308970261094506496 2020-09-24 11:23:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TechUnderworld Shit.  I just don't see how someone who loves America can do this to the country.  I'm also not sure he's smart enough to have come up with this plan but he's basically dismantling the United States.
1308958198246842368 2020-09-24 10:35:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @bryanbehar @wynandehague None of them have ever said anything against #45, have they?  Are we so sure America isn't a military junta?  A satellite of Russia perhaps?  Moscow West?  I just don't see any of them saying anything to allay anyone's fears.

1308953615349026818 2020-09-24 10:17:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @brat2381 @kosgirl56 And you think this immoral scum is going to oversee a peaceful transition of power?  Has he ever said he intended to go peacefully?  You believe him, really .@SenatorRomney?
1308939434579103745 2020-09-24 09:20:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JNic1000 That's hopeful, but if he's really an asset, will there be a Biden administration?  Will there be a Truth Commission?
1308938064497082375 2020-09-24 09:15:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @patch1000 Ok, so if that's true, are we in so deep we're already toast?  Is there any hope?  Are the borders going to be closed to us even more than they are now?  Can we get out?
1308936738988060673 2020-09-24 09:10:12 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BCOOL333 Same here.  When I last checked I thought, wow, I lost a bunch.  Not sure of the exact number but it seemed pretty big.
1308936361513189376 2020-09-24 09:08:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillKristol @G_Paknowsbest Is there any chance at all that anyone, anyone whatsoever on the republican side is willing to step up and say, wait, this isn't right or good for the USA or democracy?  These were your people .@BillKristol
1308936036668637190 2020-09-24 09:07:24 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Are we or aren't we a satellite of Russia?  Is #45 or isn't he a Russian asset.
1308935825128853510 2020-09-24 09:06:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SDK21597925 So, if he wins, no matter whether or not ballots were mailed in or done in person, then the process is legitimate.  If he loses, then the process is not legitimate.  Ok, I see.

1308844033834393601 2020-09-24 03:01:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RepAdamSchiff @nicole_bertrand Is there something that limits executive power, enforces the emoluments clause and doesn't allow nepotism?  There should be a limit on the number of "acting" officials.  Also, where's the enforcement of checks and balances? Enforcing the laws?  Because right now, we're lawless.

1308449954709540865 2020-09-23 00:55:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @morethanmySLE I totally get why he‚Äôs going to vote for #45‚Äôs nominee.  He‚Äôd vote for any nominee because they are going to be anti choice.  Those are his religious beliefs and probably the beliefs of his constituents.  A Pro-choice nominee would probably NOT get the nod from him. Meh.

1308408414922592262 2020-09-22 22:10:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @rshep350 smart move.
1308408082507223051 2020-09-22 22:09:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @EveryKoala Before I go through 100 pictures, did they actually *make* an announcement?
1308407344951427072 2020-09-22 22:06:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @kylegriffin1 @Berlidge Ok, I'll take that one.   1.  Let's kill off people dependent on social services 2.  Let's cause as much chaos as we can. 3.  Incompetence at the highest level. 4.  Putin told him to do it. 5.  He doesn't really care about us.
1308406760835817474 2020-09-22 22:04:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> The idiot is on, I switched the channel to tennis.
1308406409609052163 2020-09-22 22:02:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> No surprise that Romney is going to vote thumbs up for #45's nominee.
1308244010033647616 2020-09-22 11:17:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mog7546 @davehunter25 Oh, I see.  Eric is traveling too much during the election to testify but the senate isn't too busy during an election to and other crises to confirm a supreme court justice.
1308214909017239553 2020-09-22 09:21:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillKristol @seagal_lori He's devoid of human emotions so that answers your question.  And, he doesn't care about anyone but himself.  And, maybe someone who is a few nuggets short of a six pack might say it.
1308213150152613895 2020-09-22 09:14:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mah50s @cranky_yankee Help us to understand how a guy like McConnell keeps getting elected.  If he was just *another Senator* people wouldn't be freaking out about his reelection.  What he does affects all of us and the only people who can change that are the people of Kentucky.
1308210923996352512 2020-09-22 09:06:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ProjectLincoln I'm sure this plays right into Putin's playbook.
1308201601128161285 2020-09-22 08:29:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Time for the Democrats with BIG BUCKS to pour some money into the states that are on the cusp.
1308200789060575232 2020-09-22 08:25:47 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Given whomever #45 nominates for SCOTUS, they will be anti-choice.  Can .@MittRomney vote against that person?
1308179747994828802 2020-09-22 07:02:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JoeBiden @LiReHirsch Really glad to see you are in Wisconsin.  Keep going north.  There's a huge swath of land that is probably never visited by a Democrat.  Rhinelander, Wausau, Mosinee, the UP in Michigan.  All those areas have been hit by the virus and never recovered from the last recession.
1308177962144071687 2020-09-22 06:55:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SethAbramson @IrishLass2157 I 100% believe that's true.  Looking ahead, when the time comes, and it might be different for people, will we be able to leave the country?
1308145869108191233 2020-09-22 04:47:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CaslerNoel @expobear1 @realDonaldTrump Seriously, wtaf.  How could he be such a hypocrite?  Have they no self respect?  They lie, they cheat, they change the rules to suit their own agenda.  Honestly, what options do the Democrats have in this debacle?
1308137702617948161 2020-09-22 04:15:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @EricBoehlert Congress does not seem to care about what the American people want: some gun control, health care, social security, the right to choose, LGBTQ rights, the list sort of goes on and on.  Why do people elect people who consistently go against their own best interests?
1308076549514592256 2020-09-22 00:12:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> The election has started.  There should be NO Supreme Court Justice nominated at this time, just like PBO‚Äôs nominee was denied.  But it‚Äôs#45‚Äôs show and obviously he does whatever the fuck he wants with ZERO consequences.
1308073410405314561 2020-09-21 23:59:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @laurasessions10 I thought he was double digits ahead of her?
1308046036594839553 2020-09-21 22:10:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PrincessBravato @TheOnly313Girl I think it means the administration can do whatever they want in NY because they are anarchists.  Actually, no idea.
1308045759565230082 2020-09-21 22:09:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MGScott9 If they veto it, I'll be pleasantly shocked but #45 is already threatening people if they vote against him.  So there's that.
1308045090582147072 2020-09-21 22:07:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RepJeffries @DevilisRepublcn Yeah, I think we're all waiting for that "hitting back hard" part.  Would love to believe it, I'm just not seeing it.
1308044896893317125 2020-09-21 22:06:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @robsevy @courageousgirl2 What was his breaking point?  As an aside, sure took him long enough.
1308044504843378689 2020-09-21 22:04:46 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I'd be shocked if any republican senator chooses to veto a SCOTUS nominee.

The problem is the Senate.  If we can keep the House, take the Senate and win the Presidency, we'll be able to turn back much of the damage they've done.  IF.  If.  if.
1308040613808439297 2020-09-21 21:49:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Whateva691 @dfrntdrmmr Anyone who ever thought that this administration cared about our kids, our health, our safety or our livelihood just has not been paying attention.  They don't give TWO CRAPS ABOUT US.

1307745007026286597 2020-09-21 02:14:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @GOPChairwoman Unfortunately.@JoeBiden isn‚Äôt president, yet.  Why does your party hate America so much?  What era are you taking us back to?  And you?!?  You‚Äôre a woman.  Have you no self respect?  #45 is a misogynist pig.  Shame on you.

1307709233392242690 2020-09-20 23:52:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WalshFreedom @jaw792 Joe, if you are reading this - maybe you are but probably not - are there large numbers of other people who hold your same core beliefs that are also speaking up and not voting for #45?
1307706880723161088 2020-09-20 23:43:11 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DorothyTweet1 @Twitter I think there's more of us than "them".  They tend to be really loud and definitely the guy at the top has brought out the worst of the worst.  I just hope we aren't already in the rabbit hole.
1307706232178868224 2020-09-20 23:40:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @lindagoodliffe @PBMiller63 @JoeNBC @rebellegrrl Particularly since those were private conversations.  It probably went something like this: "Yes comrade, whatever you say.  You're really in charge Vlad".
1307705226116333572 2020-09-20 23:36:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Has anyone ever heard that the Democrats want to tear down Mt. Rushmore?
1307704537646534657 2020-09-20 23:33:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DorothyTweet1 @Twitter Yes.  But are we *really* better than this?  Lately, I'm not so sure.
1307704062746537986 2020-09-20 23:31:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PBMiller63 @JoeNBC @rebellegrrl Yeah, the whole thing bothered me.  I always felt like Mika had Stockholm Syndrome.  They all made the emails a much bigger deal then it really was and absolutely no mention of that now.  The media let us down in 2016.  Is that going to happen again?
1307703408049172480 2020-09-20 23:29:23 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @13vixen @funder @GOPChairwoman I'm not sure the IRS can arbitrarily release someone's taxes.  Definitely not an expert on the subject.  I assume there'd have to be some subpoena?  Or something?  Anyone?
1307702863431376896 2020-09-20 23:27:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Iggy_Sue @13vixen @funder @GOPChairwoman So obviously when he lied multiple times about releasing his taxes, that's ok with you. That's the real issue here.  He lied. Hopefully after this debacle we'll limit executive powers, deal w/nepotism, emoluments &amp; rules of candidacy.  We've viewed corruption first hand now.
1307698686856761344 2020-09-20 23:10:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @13vixen @Iggy_Sue @funder @GOPChairwoman And therein lies the problem.  They want it both ways ALL THE TIME.  PBO couldn't nominate a SCOTUS but the idiot can.  They have zero credibility.  zero.
1307698199377915904 2020-09-20 23:08:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JoeNBC @rebellegrrl Joe, it's great that you are hyper critical of #45 now but four years ago?  You had him on EVERY SINGLE DAY during the election.  You schmoozed with him, Mika giggled with him and when he threatened to tell everyone about your relationship, you turned on him.  Hard to trust you.

1307695746213441537 2020-09-20 22:58:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Hohenlohe65 I'm on an Apple.

1307694372809584640 2020-09-20 22:53:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Bannon said they were going to deconstruct, destroy and dismantle our government and by jiggity, that's just what they've done.  Enjoy.
1307694062741475329 2020-09-20 22:52:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PeggyBrava @ablnk Same here except for the PC part.

1307692430096044032 2020-09-20 22:45:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PeggyBrava @ablnk Same here.  It's down at the bottom of the page.  It's been like this for a while.  Maybe .@Jack doesn't want us to use emojis.

1307691274779136002 2020-09-20 22:41:10 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ElPresidenTroll Obvious sarcasm.  üòâ
1307690554537508864 2020-09-20 22:38:18 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PeterJoseph73 Highly doubtful.  But I do hope we see him being hauled off to jail.
1307689107213217792 2020-09-20 22:32:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #45 has been in office for 4 years and is still saying MAGA?  So obviously he lied about that too.

1307686559899152385 2020-09-20 22:22:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PensAndPatron Totally dumb.  So, what are they doing?
1307683428842844164 2020-09-20 22:09:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @chipfranklin We've gotta do something that's for sure.  Obviously, the GOP has no sense of morality or fairness.  They've been hypocritical since day one.

1307380110778077184 2020-09-20 02:04:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BurnettCynthia @JoyAnnReid @AmyMcGrathKY Same in Wisconsin which also has a large rural population.
1307362350505308160 2020-09-20 00:54:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @nprpolitics @homebrewerjoe GOP doesn‚Äôt give two craps about what RBG said or what her granddaughter said.  This election has already begun.  They should wait until after the election like they forced the democrats, but that would require decency and I‚Äôm fairly certain that‚Äôs not part of the equation.
1307324986949074945 2020-09-19 22:25:40 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @lib_monster @BillySchnaebitz yeah I sort of think their constituents would like that they vote for the nominee.  If they are republicans, and a republican is nominating someone, wouldn't they want to vote yes?  I'm not clear on that whole thing.
1307322994059083776 2020-09-19 22:17:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> March tonight 8:00 pm at the Supreme Court.  Amazingly, .@mitchellreports just put that out on .@amjoyshow .
1307322584611074049 2020-09-19 22:16:07 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillySchnaebitz What's the red tape?  What ways can Dems slow it?
1307322361667092482 2020-09-19 22:15:14 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PerlmanGerry @Nancy_Woke Saying is one thing, doing is another.
1307321636551614465 2020-09-19 22:12:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillySchnaebitz It only helps if they do what they said they'd do.  Linds has also been on record for saying no nomination should take place in the last year of a president's tenure.  So does that help?  Maybe .
1307321329528512512 2020-09-19 22:11:08 +0800 <LindaMarkss> The Election has already started.  There should not be a nomination for SCOTUS at this time.  Easy peasy.
1307320629339844611 2020-09-19 22:08:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Do you actually think any GOP Senator will vote against #45's nomination for SCOTUS?
1307317791230394370 2020-09-19 21:57:04 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @nytimes How does he differentiate between the two?
1307317485935505411 2020-09-19 21:55:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @tltwarriior No.  Not in a million years.
1307317121156751363 2020-09-19 21:54:25 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @danielsgoldman @LiReHirsch That still wouldn't give them a majority.  It would only be fair if they waited until AFTER the election.  But given past history, that's unlikely.
1307163229068627970 2020-09-19 11:42:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Staceballs @DeeTorr99184152 I don't want to see any of them appointed.

1307154125193449472 2020-09-19 11:06:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @HillaryClinton @D_Ericson She was right about a lot of stuff.  In retrospect, those emails seem pretty insignificant.
1307145569836642305 2020-09-19 10:32:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PatinkinMandy @PaulaInTulsaOK That was my thought too.  A juxtaposition I would never have expected.
1307145008877916161 2020-09-19 10:30:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Coconutflyer @patois42 @waltshaub I say that to my sister all the time:  it's grassroots.  One person talks to one person who talks to one other person and so it goes.  I really hope what you're saying is true and is true across state lines.  I believe we can get the popular vote but the EC worries me.
1307143690910142465 2020-09-19 10:25:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AymanM @ledarga22 They're all going to eat the words they spewed out with Garland but it's not going to matter, is it.  The only chance of it not happening is if Republican senators have the guts to do the right thing.  So far, that's been a no-show.
1307142179748491265 2020-09-19 10:19:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @guarana4me @JillWineBanks @senatemajldr Yes.  The worst.  But it's had to pick just one.  Add Barr, Miller, Pence, the list goes on.
1307141754173485057 2020-09-19 10:17:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JillWineBanks Why would they go against #45?  Do they think if they approve the nomination they won't win their reelection? Would they do it because they don't want to be seen as hypocrites?  I just don't see them having the courage.  Do you?
1307138881842810880 2020-09-19 10:06:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @votevets @JLustwerk @LindseyGrahamSC Riiiiiiiiiiighttttttttt.  If you believe that, I have a bridge.
1307138528514580480 2020-09-19 10:04:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @flyingfannie @fahyhallowell Who knows, maybe #45 will have pushed through his nominee by then and they'll take away health care.  What could go wrong?
1307138102507470850 2020-09-19 10:03:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sophieelsworth Come on over to the states.  There are lots of *pubs* that would like the business.  Of course if we had a national response maybe we'd be in much better shape and not have less than 5% of the world's population but 25% of all the cases.  Want to trade?
1307121935030120449 2020-09-19 08:58:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DrGJackBrown That means going against their dear leader.  Will they really do that?  That'd be an interesting move.  But I'll believe that when I see that.
1307121164049936384 2020-09-19 08:55:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Laurajane25 #45 was impeached.  He's under multiple investigations.  He's a Russian agent.  He's lied 20K times.  He's got an election in 50 days.  But sure, let's allow him to put ANOTHER Justice on the Supreme Court.  They'd never allow a Dem to do it but since it's him, anything goes.
1307118943207907329 2020-09-19 08:46:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @justdojustice Well that's positive!  Is there a plan B?
1307118319733035009 2020-09-19 08:44:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @IKnowYouAreBut3 @tkofman And Susan Collins will clutch her pearls.
1307117085588426754 2020-09-19 08:39:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @manalivehouston Yeah that's my thought too but even at 11, they still wouldn't have a majority.
1307115875863060480 2020-09-19 08:34:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> What can the Democrats do to block #45 from putting someone else on the SCOTUS?
1307113713883807746 2020-09-19 08:26:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @JackieNew182 He had to know something was happening.  He couldn't keep something like that under the radar.  That's why he threw out those names.
1307113076181929985 2020-09-19 08:23:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MarisaMillerCA @chickilopiccolo @AmyMcGrathKY Really wish some of the guys with the BIG BUCKS would put some money towards this race.  Kicking McConnell out would be amazing.
1307112646362255360 2020-09-19 08:21:54 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Is this why #45 was tossing around potential nominees for the SCOTUS just a few days ago?  Ted Cruz??
1307112308116729857 2020-09-19 08:20:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MysterySolvent Terrible way to start out the Jewish New Year.
1307109488873353217 2020-09-19 08:09:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Can 2020 get any worse?  Peace and light to your spirit Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  You will be missed.
1307073675087278082 2020-09-19 05:47:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @perlmutations Given EVERYTHING that #45 has done and said about the Hispanic community, it's amazing there's anyone that would vote for him.
1307072055494479874 2020-09-19 05:40:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jpierni @ConfedofLunches When you think of it, "one third of the country wants to kill off one third of the country while one third watches".  I saw that somewhere and I believe it to be true.
1307071279237865473 2020-09-19 05:37:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @charliekirk11 @kimKBaltimore I don't think anyone believes that "strong conservatives" give two craps about ANY disenfranchised group of people.  That's really fake news.

1307041574690398208 2020-09-19 03:39:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RealSethPittman WTAF?   I used to give dirty looks, (hard to do with a mask on), at people who weren't wearing a mask.  But now I figure people are so crazed, if I do that, someone might assault me.  Crazy times.
1307041098561454091 2020-09-19 03:37:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #TheTruthAboutIvanka with a headline like this, #45 is going to ban .@twitter next.  On the other hand, he needs twitter more than twitter needs him.
1307040557705900032 2020-09-19 03:35:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @LincolnsBible I wish it had been more in depth actually.  Maybe more factual?  I want to know about those licenses/trademarks for voting machines and caskets (?),  I want to know where the $100 million went for a global women's fund her daddy included in our national budget.

1306946490313699330 2020-09-18 21:21:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WI_Resistance Mosinee! That's hilarious.  It's basically in the middle of nowhere and it has an airport!  North Central Wisconsin airport.  There's not much else there so it's a perfect fit for the idiot.

1306405418411925509 2020-09-17 09:31:38 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @rawbanana88 I agree but... he's never been off the grid for ten days, two weeks.  And, I would think that if he gets it, he's going to be sick, so sick he can't golf or have a political rally disguised as a news conference.  But agree we don't really know.  About that or other stuff.
1306404341952270337 2020-09-17 09:27:21 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RobAdamsFL You would think, but I thought that a few month ago.

For me, I could leave the country 3 months at a time but my husband has a job and my daughter has a job, so they can't live abroad.  Once he retires, I'll push for spending at least some of the time somewhere else.
1306403377593622533 2020-09-17 09:23:31 +0800 <LindaMarkss> What the what?  How is it that #45 keeps managing to avoid the virus?

1306357911770333184 2020-09-17 06:22:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @TomJChicago When he asked why Biden didn't do something about mandating masks nationally, is this an example of his delusion?  Is he forgetting that Biden isn't President and can't mandate anything nationally?  What's that all about?

1305600173951909893 2020-09-15 04:11:53 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BJuanittab39 That's so much vomit it makes me want to vomit.
1305598439296839680 2020-09-15 04:04:59 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Kimmy629 It's coming from your microwave?

1305559546954383360 2020-09-15 01:30:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CrystalMaracle Canadians are incredibly friendly and patriotic.  My guess is whomever said that has not been to Canada.

1305547675266420736 2020-09-15 00:43:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Let me count the ways.  Let‚Äôs start with checks and balances.  Then we can move on to ruining our relationships with countries that used to be our allies.  Then there‚Äôs nepotism and the emoluments clause.  And then there‚Äôs..

1305275426474991616 2020-09-14 06:41:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ok #45, you had 4 years and clearly America isn't so great.  In fact, you're still saying it, so even you know it hasn't happened.
1305269108326445057 2020-09-14 06:16:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @dividejen @ResistBigly That's great because I was in Oneida and Vilas county and there aren't many Biden/Harris signs there.  It might be the #northwoods but the politics are deep south.
1305267378016727040 2020-09-14 06:09:28 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @fred_guttenberg @GOPChairwoman @JoeBiden Uh, what exactly does a private citizen do to affect the outcome of a national pandemic?  What access does he actually have to administer something on a national level?  You're cray cray Ronna.
1305240121516716034 2020-09-14 04:21:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Love seeing all the military responding to this tweet!  My brother fought in Viet Nam and was a medic with zero medical training.   He came home early because our father was dying and he was the sole male in the family.  Really tough times.  Thanks to all for their service.

1305150277465628674 2020-09-13 22:24:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I'm not hearing Democrats or Democratic leaders calling for riots in the street.  It ALL seems to be coming from #45 and his cultists.

1305144709044670464 2020-09-13 22:02:01 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Election night: Biden wins.  #45 supporters  hit the streets.  What does #45 do?

1304810486312185859 2020-09-12 23:53:56 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @ChebaChick @USATODAY Just traveled through Wisconsin from South to North and back again.  Far too many signs up for #45 particularly in the rural areas.  I just gotta ask, what has this administration actually done for you?  Not much.

1304607589033017344 2020-09-12 10:27:42 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @sfpelosi @FreshPhunky One of those moments when Melania's coat probably says "I really don't care" and who knows why #45 didn't say "under god".  My guess is he forgot the words.

1304251570109009924 2020-09-11 10:53:00 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If #45 is still saying MAGA, he had 4 years to make that happen.  Evidently it didn't.
1304251078486167554 2020-09-11 10:51:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @PattyArquette Ok, so #45 is one idiot, but based on what he lied about, you would think people would take Covid more seriously but we *are* talking about trumpeters.
1304249172200247297 2020-09-11 10:43:29 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MysterySolvent His intelligence hole.
1304241183770775552 2020-09-11 10:11:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Saying #BidenTheRapist is like me saying I could beat .@serenawilliams (my favorite tennis player).
1304182542531268610 2020-09-11 06:18:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @isolated_matt @Zylie Me too!
1304169390217326593 2020-09-11 05:26:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> #TrumpPressConference Ironic that he said he didn't want to create panic by telling us how dangerous Covid is but had no problem freaking everyone out lying about caravans of immigrants coming to the US &amp; telling suburbanites that if Biden wins they can kiss the suburbs goodbye.
1304042257528610816 2020-09-10 21:01:16 +0800 <LindaMarkss> During the 2016 election, I always thought that .@morningmika had Stockholm Syndrome.  They had #45 on every single day to schmooze and giggle.  They, particularly Joe, are at least partially responsible (along with most of the media) for electing the idiot.  So there's that.
1304038999967793153 2020-09-10 20:48:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @gregolear @trguillen151 What did Pency actually do as the head of the covid team?  He rarely talked at the press conferences about covid.  Maybe Mother told him to be quiet?  But yeah, they all knew.  Hell, I knew in January!

1304036883601780736 2020-09-10 20:39:55 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Does it matter to any of #45's cultists that he lied about the virus?
1303876418363940867 2020-09-10 10:02:17 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @twendi66 @KingKathy11 A couple of observations: One day, you'll look back and wish you were 40 again. And:  *These* are the good old days.  Happy Birthday!!!
1303822528155090944 2020-09-10 06:28:09 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MSNBC He‚Äôs an idiot.

1303401857776263171 2020-09-09 02:36:33 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @skiBum1138 I feel like there's already been a coup here.  I said that almost four years ago.
1303401107457298435 2020-09-09 02:33:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @mmpadellan @revmagdalen @ABC @CBS @nbc @CNN @MSNBC @washingtonpost WTAF?  We have really and truly become lawless.  Congratulations #45, you made this happen.  And, FFS media, report on this.  Make this a REALLY BIG DEAL.  This kind of behavior should not go unpunished.
1303400542509686785 2020-09-09 02:31:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DonaldJTrumpJr An idiot like your father is ruining our country.  He also couldn't find his way out of a paper bag.  Let THAT sink in you incompetent, PRIVILEGED wart hog.
1303398125340684291 2020-09-09 02:21:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WalserWes That sounds very reasonable.  Something sorely missing these days.
1303397645910761475 2020-09-09 02:19:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @txmedic37 Nobody showed up armed at protests during the Viet Nam war.  Nobody showed up during the Democratic Convention in 1968 with long rifles or automatic weapons.  There were no guns at the Women‚Äôs Marches.  This is new.
1303391795422863363 2020-09-09 01:56:34 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Does anyone else find it alarming that people show up at protests heavily armed?  Is this what America has become?
1303391509430050819 2020-09-09 01:55:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Raytown_12 @uflo5 @realDonaldTrump Let them go there and live then.  They can take my trumper neighbor with them.
1303391173927751680 2020-09-09 01:54:06 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @davidssilverman Navy Pier has had such a history of being in use, not being in use, being in use and not being in use.  My brother went to college classes at Navy Pier years ago.  It is sad that it's not open because they had some great programs there aside from all the touristy stuff.
1303390545302220801 2020-09-09 01:51:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @CNNPolitics @KarrieK817 They just can't do anything right.  Everything they touch withers and dies.  What a bunch of incompetent imbeciles.
1303389898012004352 2020-09-09 01:49:02 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @uflo5 @realDonaldTrump WTAF?  These people need their own state.  Let them live somewhere else.  And then take away any federal funds from them.  Let them generate their own state income.

1303063150959439872 2020-09-08 04:10:39 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @jenmendez_ @McJacqueline2 I'd like to see her go out more often, particularly to toss-up states.
1303062618912051206 2020-09-08 04:08:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Aside from the crimes he can be tried for in NYC, what other crimes can #45 be tried for?
1303061944308584449 2020-09-08 04:05:51 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Whateva691 He most likely looks at numbers vs: looking at the  percentage of total population

1303034698977943553 2020-09-08 02:17:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MysterySolvent @MyP_Chicago I have no idea why .@MSNBC airs this garbage.  Their viewers don't want to see it.  It's stupid.
1303033052835258368 2020-09-08 02:11:03 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @WalshFreedom @OKBlu_ Yeah he is.
1303012071060242432 2020-09-08 00:47:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @davidfrum We all heard him diss .@SenJohnMcCain .  It's not such a stretch to believe he would say everything he's accused of saying.  More of "you didn't hear what you heard and you didn't see what you saw".  Luckily we all don't have the mentality of the standard supporter of #45.

Any chance you can get them farther north?  I'm north of Rhinelander and see lots of signs for #45 and only a few for Biden/Harris.  Evidently there was a boat parade up here on Saturday.  Sadly nobody sank.  Go Wisconsin!

1302629474064891904 2020-09-06 23:27:22 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Hey .@realDonaldTrump where's that plan you talked about to replace the ACA?  Huh?

Shouldn't you be paying attention to the covid pandemic, unemployment, housing issues and other issues that actually affect people?  Worst fuckin`g person to inhabit our WH.

1302321177046716417 2020-09-06 03:02:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @DonLew87 @62WalterP He allegedly killed two people and wounded one other.  He went armed, crossed state lines and disobeyed the curfew.  He acted as police, jury, judge and executioner.  Seems really obvious to me.  No sympathy for this guy.

Just because he loves the pomp and circumstance of the military, like tanks, and planes, and medals, and uniforms, it doesn't mean he respects the foot soldier.  Even YOU should know that.

1301893184658853889 2020-09-04 22:41:37 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If you believe that #45 loves the troops, I have a bridge to sell you.
1301892731623661568 2020-09-04 22:39:49 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MollyJongFast @just_type_f He DOES NOT love the troops. He loves the pomp and circumstance, soldiers marching in time, tanks, fast planes, medals, uniforms, he loves that but the foot soldier?  The man or woman in the trenches?  Not so much.  He's said this over and over.  There's no doubt.
1301889471189835776 2020-09-04 22:26:52 +0800 <LindaMarkss> .@MSNBC Interesting or maybe not so much, but nobody in #45's administration seems to know much about anything.  Or, "it's not my job".

1301702127639834626 2020-09-04 10:02:26 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @SenTedCruz He called your wife ugly and said your father was colleagues with Lee Harvey Oswald.  And what do you do?  You support him!  Have you no self respect?  Guess not.

1301638271387271169 2020-09-04 05:48:41 +0800 <LindaMarkss> I laughed when .@KristinCav said she was divorcing .@JayCutlerBears because he "was lazy".  I thought, yeah, that's what I thought when he was qb for the #chicagobears.  And now he's dating Tomi Lahren?  hahahahahaha!!!!
1301599146286239744 2020-09-04 03:13:13 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RojoRurba002 Well Im pretty sure the salon isn‚Äôt hot wired into media outlets so someone had to leak it, right?

1301534656047841286 2020-09-03 22:56:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Yeah, Nancy should have worn a mask.  At my salon, everyone wears a mask.  On the other hand, this is minor shit.  What #45 does is far, far worse.  Let's focus on the real stuff.

1301350314243772420 2020-09-03 10:44:27 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @rational03 @MarieAnneVC @realDonaldTrump I think it will be one of those times where long after it should have been evident, people will say, "hey, he's a Russian asset".
1301349634858774528 2020-09-03 10:41:45 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @RepSwalwell There are no checks and balances.  I believe it's called "lawlessness".

1301345752250224640 2020-09-03 10:26:19 +0800 <LindaMarkss> If you drive from South to North in WISCONSIN, you'll see lots of towns with Native American names.  Ironic to hear that the people in Wauwatosa want to keep it "white".
1301343029983408130 2020-09-03 10:15:30 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @Clc143 Now that's real embarrassing Wisconsin.  Particularly since the name Wauwatosa is hardly "white".

1301174313068961793 2020-09-02 23:05:05 +0800 <LindaMarkss> There were ten investigations into Benghazi.  Where are the investigations into how #45 blew the response to Covid?
1301173853054533632 2020-09-02 23:03:15 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Definitely think it's time for .@JoeBiden and .@KamalaHarris to take their campaign to battleground states.

There's no follow up, they don't support each other and they're probably all afraid if they say or do the wrong thing, they won't be allowed back.  It's a conundrum.
1300959460471566341 2020-09-02 08:51:20 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @garym27 I think mother likes it when he lies.  She can punish him or, maybe she thinks it makes him look like edgy.  Either way, she gets to reign him in.  Heee haw..
1300926339898380289 2020-09-02 06:39:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AnnLittlemouse By the way Ann, Bill Kristol is a conservative republican.  He always has been and he will always be one. And even he knows #45 is bat shit crazy.  And actually, he's not the only one.  Sure they'll all jump ship when the *right* conservative comes along, but for now?  They know.
1300925838569934850 2020-09-02 06:37:44 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @AnnLittlemouse Here's the thing Ann.  You claim to be a child of god and a follower of Christianity, and then you say you like to offend people.  There's a disconnect.  A child of god would bring people into the light, and you just want to be a jerk.  So it's hard to take you seriously.
1300921025018953730 2020-09-02 06:18:36 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @FallFromTheSun @BillKristol IKR?  What if the media asked him something like, oh I don't know, but maybe how about "tell us more about those anarchists on the plane that kept multiplying" and they kept asking him that and asking him that until he gave an answer?  What if that was all they asked him?
1300920110237003779 2020-09-02 06:14:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @MiaFarrow @sundanz63 Oh that's an easy one.  She has it so she can explain the big words and important stuff to pop.

1300913251199455235 2020-09-02 05:47:43 +0800 <LindaMarkss> When all this crap is behind us, we need to limit Executive powers and get rid of nepotism in the White House.  And maybe find Checks and Balances because they seem to be AWOL.

He never condemns Putin, ever.  Are Democrats, and whatever honest Republicans aware?  Do they care?  What can they do?
1300864887661441032 2020-09-02 02:35:32 +0800 <LindaMarkss> Ok #45.  Prove the claim you are making about "thugs on planes".  Media?  Press him on this.  Don't stop asking until he tells you what he's talking about.  Grow some spines.

1300864492004311041 2020-09-02 02:33:58 +0800 <LindaMarkss> @BillKristol WTAF is he talking about?  Media should pound him on this.  "Show us the proof", "Tell us who you are talking about", "What plane was it", "Where was the plane going".  "Have you lost your mind?".
