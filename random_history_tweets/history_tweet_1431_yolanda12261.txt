1342085215498469377 2020-12-24 20:30:24 +0800 <yolanda12261> @DerenicByrd If enough cops police themselves, abusers will have to shape up &amp; stop being worse than criminals or they’ll have to deal with cop shortages out in the field &amp; street justice without enough cops to have their backs. It’s time to get rid of the gestapo police once &amp; for all.
1342082982476206082 2020-12-24 20:21:32 +0800 <yolanda12261> @DerenicByrd Bravo!!!  Finally a cop with 🏀 🏀 to make  cops behave like decent humans &amp; not gestapo killers.

I come from a family of 4 boys and three girls, plus one adopted sister (she had no siblings and a widowed working mom so she grew up with us for a while). That’s so weird, too. Lol

That’s why I said it was 10% were non maskers.  In reality, one non masker can infect hundreds. Probability &amp; statistics versus reality.

Why haven’t those in charge of US security removed the openly plotting tyrant from office &amp; transferred him to traitor’s prison? His treasonous behavior is far from what would be tolerated by any US citizen.

1338243911718989826 2020-12-14 06:06:26 +0800 <yolanda12261> @SuckerCarlson He’s continuing with the plan designed for trump’s fan base to send him another few million $ to keep up the facade of throwing out millions of Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ballots so trump can take back his throne. He knows it’s useless but is shamelessly counting on their ignorance.
1338241787480199171 2020-12-14 05:58:00 +0800 <yolanda12261> @newtgingrich You know he’s not making it difficult for republicans to win but making it easier for democrats to vote.  The same R voter suppression was used Texas, forcing up to 4.5 million voters to use 1 drop box as far as 50 miles away.  Be assured, R voter suppression will be addressed.

I get covid &amp; have no symptoms. My roommate doesn’t wear a mask when they’re in our home, where they’re exposed to it. They get a severe case of it and die. I am a murderer by my neglect.

It occurs after getting covid, w/the body’s defenses down. The patient’s lungs get full of mucus, which they can’t cough out, &amp; it festers &amp; turns into pneumonia.  That, not “wearing a mask”. Covid came from an unmasked ruthless killer

I’m completely tone deaf &amp; used to have people look at me when I sang at church - not in the choir, just singing from my seat; it wasn’t a good look but a”shut up lady” look 🤣🤣🤣
1328201937712537600 2020-11-16 13:03:13 +0800 <yolanda12261> @HeidiKooten @IsabellaRaine1 @_SJPeace_ My dad wasn’t a teacher by profession but he was an excellent teacher. Many people have it in them and can be very good at it. I’ll bet they were that way, as you probably were, too. Teaching is about how you feel when sharing your knowledge, not so much the profession itself.

I was tough but many kids became engineers, doctors and researchers and would come speak to my students when in town. I like to think I taught them to aim high and work toward their goals as well as taught them math &amp; physics. I really miss teaching snifff

I come from a long line of teachers &amp; principals: my mom, my great uncle, 2 great aunts, an aunt, four siblings &amp; cousins &amp; their kids plus my nephew. Another nephew, when younger, didn’t realize we all had jobs since we were always “going to school”🤣

At least one kid made my day every single day of my 35 year career. There’s nothing like watching a kid that usually needs help understanding concepts that figures it out for themselves for the 1st time.

He’s not running a campaign but a terrorist gang which will continue for 3 months if we defeat him or the rest of our lives if he steals it. It’ll be worse than hitler’s third reich &amp; 3rd world cartels. Nobody can save us then.

Who knows what happened in both primaries but I’m betting they had a hand in them, too. He’ll never be my president.  The GOP should be pissed he ended the careers of so many republicans.

I hope he can pull some of that same stuff outta his ass when they start dropping like flies. Well, they can go through the whole course of the disease - just for experience.

Remember, the fact that our law doesn’t have to have a good reason to investigate will not nullify the facts that were uncovered &amp; reported in the senate intelligence report.

Knowing he paid taxes to Panama explains why the old republican farts bragged they’d move to Panama if trump lost. They must have a trumptown down there. Remember again, don’t drink the kool aide.

1310704492493582349 2020-09-29 06:14:37 +0800 <yolanda12261> @_cingraham @ddale8 I believe trump is getting advice from fellow dictator/banker putin in russia, where election interference is the norm.

1308331581275168768 2020-09-22 17:05:31 +0800 <yolanda12261> @AthenaBusSvs @krtmd @oliverdarcy The difference is that her family probably felt honored 2 be entrusted with such an important message 4 americans,. Nothing my parents could have said about anything would have been taken as an insult. I knew what I meant 2 them &amp; what others meant to them took nothing from that.
1308329743150792704 2020-09-22 16:58:13 +0800 <yolanda12261> @whiskysherman @AthenaBusSvs @krtmd @oliverdarcy Having seen the lying gop cowards that’ve gone back on their words spoken loudly &amp; proudly four years ago 2 deny Obama a nominee 9 months before an election, it’s no wonder she couldn’t rest knowing what would happen with her seat so she spoke up. Know these lying cowards?
1308317239951515648 2020-09-22 16:08:32 +0800 <yolanda12261> @DouglasMoser @Zenonlite @MollyJongFast @kanyewest They’re doing what Trump does - accusing everyone of the cheating they’re guilty of. Remember trump wiping the floors with all these idiots he’s got with their heads so far up his ass he can’t sit down, like teddy Cruz and joe rubio. Now they want to ride in his trashy parade.
1308313878762106880 2020-09-22 15:55:10 +0800 <yolanda12261> @FacesOfCOVID @Cleavon_MD Thank you for your service. May you rest in peace.
1308313510556827649 2020-09-22 15:53:42 +0800 <yolanda12261> @TuckerCarlson That’s trump’s thing, he accuses others of doing exactly what he’s guilty of doing. So transparent! Lmao his whole party would be better off if he’d keep his fish mouth shut, but that’s like asking the narcissist to stop breathing.
1308312556319068162 2020-09-22 15:49:55 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush This is you. And I’ve better things to do than listen to the rankings of a lunatic. Get help as soon as you can.  https://t.co/DAVydttGrd
1308311661124624385 2020-09-22 15:46:21 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush Btw, white is a mutation in a gene where it loses the ability to produce melanin. It’s not better, just mutated. That’s all supremacists have going for them.
1308311411508965376 2020-09-22 15:45:22 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush It’s the act of killing being compared. Many ppl can watch a black unarmed man be shot 2 death &amp; not be phased by it but will raise Cain if an animal is treated the same way. Neither murder is wrong, but the total disregard of human life is a defect &amp; appalling.
1308310162910838784 2020-09-22 15:40:24 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush He probably didn’t realize he was under arrest and walked by five cops that could have stopped him before he opened his car door. Would it be better if a white man was shot in the back instead of stopped before he walked 25 feet? Stop flip flopping like a slimy bottom dweller.

Their success is what u really fear. Everyone can succeed, y’all may just have to work harder like poc.
1308306389027020800 2020-09-22 15:25:24 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush Well, if soulless taliban executioners want 2 be loved &amp; appreciated by Americans, they stop murdering unarmed Americans. Similarly, if cops want 2 be loved &amp; appreciated by black ppl &amp; poc, they stop killing unarmed black &amp; poc. It’s been tolerated &amp; encouraged, 4 far too long.

1308225132322844678 2020-09-22 10:02:31 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush Like I said before, if BLM can’t make killer cops sworn 2 protect them stop killing them, how can they stop the thousands (your #) of non-cop killers who have an agenda like any black or white murderer - all their own &amp; for different reasons. They gotta start somewhere.

You fell for your little dictator not letting witnesses testify because he knows he’s guilty but counts on your sheepishness not to ever believe the truth when it comes to his dishonest grifting. That’s why there’s no proof.

I’m thinking you probably didn’t look into his background to see if an addiction existed. As to why ppl donated to the fund, that’s really noyb, just like it’s nomb that trump’s been stealing
1308163858922713089 2020-09-22 05:59:03 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush directly involved with funds. But I’d try a less aggressive accusatory approach when you talk to them.

If those sworn to protect and serve cannot be trusted not to kill innocent, unarmed black men with as much vigor as taliban executioners, how successful would you imagine it would be to reach the masses of millions.

What’s on web shows double standard w/cops apologizing 2 white perps, releasing &amp; rewarding them. ie.Jacob Blake
1307917820064399362 2020-09-21 13:41:22 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush I disagree w/police brutality, but like karens coming undone w/the stress of being told to wear a mask to prevent further spreading of covid in private businesses, perhaps black people fear, with great reason, the deadly threat untouchable murdering armed cops pose to their lives
1307915369538039809 2020-09-21 13:31:38 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush BLM is about police brutality directed toward black people more often than other groups (in the US). Do I understand correctly that you’re saying that since black people kill other blacks people, then it’s ok for cops to kill them, even if they’re innocent and unarmed?
1307914342864650240 2020-09-21 13:27:33 +0800 <yolanda12261> @mrsagebush So, where are those numbers from because the only data I found was from an excellent research done in Germany where there are quite a few black people and way many more white people than in the US.

That’s why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. That being said, do u justify highly armed, cackle trolling, soul less taliban-like cops killing innocent, unarmed black people? Respect goes 2 ways.
