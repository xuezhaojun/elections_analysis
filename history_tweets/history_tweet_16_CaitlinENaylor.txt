1318477575900024833 2020-10-20 17:02:04 +0800 <CaitlinENaylor> I've found I engage with the lecture content much better now the lecturers build in time throughout to have discussions about the material, and we have a chance to explore these thoughts with the lecturer and hear there responses to our discussions.

We have discussions with different groups, get to engage directly with the lecturer, and get to explore our own ideas.
