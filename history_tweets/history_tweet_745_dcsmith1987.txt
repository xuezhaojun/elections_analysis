1330372812863922177 2020-11-22 12:49:30 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ReactBae Whites on the right resent whites on the left for grovelling and debasing themselves to other groups at the expense of our identity and throw us under the bus as the new blood libel racial scapegoat for all the world‚Äôs problems
1330372302626807809 2020-11-22 12:47:28 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ReactBae I think it‚Äôs because the Antifa tie themselves to other groups by proclaiming themselves to be their self-appointed ethnomasochist white saviors and terrorizing the streets on ‚Äútheir behalf‚Äù

1308122641312739331 2020-09-22 03:15:16 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @CeruleanBlwave @DelmarBenson6 @MarkSimoneNY Do you seriously not realize our economy is an important part of our quality of life including our healthcare structure? Also, Trump was pushing treatments with proven efficacy like hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and IV UV therapy and Democrats and the media shut that down, as well

1308065508495851520 2020-09-21 23:28:14 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @61JZ @JesseKellyDC It has never been done to the extent of China and Russia. No other country‚Äôs tech is controlled by a ruling political party like in China, where companied have to funnel all data collections to CCP servers. Russia has an entire agency devoted to online social media agitation

He is to blame for scores of elderly contracting the virus and condemning them to a lonely death in isolation away from loved ones

Even the people in Wuhan are going without face muzzles and having mass raves and gatherings right now. Oh, and why are people suddenly exempt from getting Covid as long as they are at a mass unmasked BLM rally?

It is leftists who are openly pushing for looting, rioting, burning, and harrassment. And no one is shooting poor little innocent blacks. Every single shooting has been a suspect refusing to comply and endangering officers

They have also repeatedly refused Trump‚Äôs offers of help

Princeton just released a study that 91% of riots have been linked to BLM. There are many documented organizations involved in providing bail and legal aid for these people.

A Catholic loyal to the leadership of the sitting Pope obeys whatever that Pope states about interpretation or current issues. Pope Francis pushes for gay rights and open borders and immigration therefore she must comply with him as sitting Pope

Cuties was most definitely not one of those films. If it had any sort of higher intent, it was the most low brow, poorly executed of any I have seen

There was no actual transcendental moral message in the film, the bulk was just lingering shots of adolescent private parts filmed in the most titillating manner possible. Basically a pedophile‚Äôs gaze of girls tangled and giggling, spanking each other, etc

I think the supposed ‚Äúmessage‚Äù against child sexualization was only given the vaguest obligatory lip service and the bulk was indulgent, unnecessary lingering shots of private areas and giggling adolescents tangled together and spanking each other

1304985637246971904 2020-09-13 11:29:56 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray You‚Äôre not listening and I think you‚Äôve been in some kind of limited half-Libertarian echo chamber not to realize what so many of your cohorts are pushing for and the ideological basis for it
1304984655192633347 2020-09-13 11:26:01 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray You are arguing for the government to formalize and legitimize the drug and prostitution industries to be taxed and regulated
1304984356231012352 2020-09-13 11:24:50 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray Then I guess you don‚Äôt know that illegal drug and human trafficking explode in nations where they are decriminalized. Look at what has become of the cities like SF. And to think that age limit laws shield children from the destructive effects of the drug industry is just naive
1304983319663251456 2020-09-13 11:20:43 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray So you want the government out of the economy, yet you want to regulate the prostitution and drug industries ü§î and just because they ‚Äúaren‚Äôt going to stop‚Äù
1304982797703094272 2020-09-13 11:18:39 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray The maybe you should reconsider what you identify as
1304982553225506821 2020-09-13 11:17:40 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray Why arrest pedophiles and not drug dealers who contribute to the destruction of lives, murders, and the ruination of communities and families? What exactly is the basis for this judgement as per Libertarian sensibilities? Why does one iniquity get a free pass and not the other?
1304980929887297582 2020-09-13 11:11:13 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray Dude, look at your own Libertarian movement wanting the decriminalization of prostitution and drugs among other things. You‚Äôre the one turning a blind eye to what the group you are claiming to support is all about
1304980519952822273 2020-09-13 11:09:35 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray You aren‚Äôt even addressing the question. I see I‚Äôve hit a nerve. You can‚Äôt justify deregulation and total freedom of economy under libertarian values on one hand and then turn around and say that same standard doesn‚Äôt apply in the social sector

By what standards do you pick and choose what you want to allow and criminalize if government should be minimal and not interfere in the self-indulgent whims of the populace?

1304976371001757697 2020-09-13 10:53:06 +0800 <dcsmith1987> @ghoobla @stillgray By not wanting to grant the goverment power to regulate and punish things that are inherently anathema to a civilized humane society (like pedophilia or prostitution), libertarians become complicit in the destruction and harm

Gun ownership in those areas is nearly exclusively in the hands of criminals, a smaller population
