1333077295142227969 2020-11-29 23:56:09 +0800 <AVitterso> @s_meffy Or just angle your camera so you get away with it. I wore shorts for my viva haha
1332986905730949120 2020-11-29 17:56:58 +0800 <AVitterso> @s_meffy At least you donâ€™t have to worry about the latter..!
1329426888268328968 2020-11-19 22:10:44 +0800 <AVitterso> @sirileknes Slightly disappointed that it wasnt pessimistic dairy calves..
1329394652345229319 2020-11-19 20:02:38 +0800 <AVitterso> @sirileknes What did you search for to get that result?? ðŸ˜‚
1329109983414415365 2020-11-19 01:11:28 +0800 <AVitterso> @IASPpain Just FYI the online form for answering " Why is this topic particularly timely and cutting edge?" is set to MINIMUM 150 words instead of MAXIMUM 150, so you might get some creative responses..!
1326798092180590598 2020-11-12 16:04:50 +0800 <AVitterso> @sirileknes Have you come across @AttentionLab work on mood fluctuations in human ultra (or ultra human) runners?    https://t.co/3TYfPWg6ms
1317108260550356998 2020-10-16 22:20:54 +0800 <AVitterso> @sirileknes You dont take up much of the screen, that is for sure! But the audio and slides worked well.   Thanks! Everything has gone well so far. Just catching up on talks etc. whilst the rest of Spain is in siesta mode.
1317089408114446336 2020-10-16 21:05:59 +0800 <AVitterso> @sirileknes Just realised that some of the talks are recorded, which is great for those of us who have spent the last few Fridays in a kayak, hiking mountains, moving countries (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§-&gt;ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸-&gt;ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´), and/or looking after a partner recovering from shoulder surgery.  https://t.co/BNsNLDzKqm
1307961743826661377 2020-09-21 16:35:55 +0800 <AVitterso> Our study also challenges the theory that sensorimotor conflict might underlie pathological pain when there is no  clear tissue pathology.
1307961094644871168 2020-09-21 16:33:20 +0800 <AVitterso> In contrast, they provide some evidence that there is a greater propensity for sensorimotor realignment in CRPS, consistent with more flexible representations of the body and peripersonal space (as we have previously shown).   https://t.co/gLvzZJkLzH
1307960358120894465 2020-09-21 16:30:24 +0800 <AVitterso> Our findings suggest that strategic control and sensorimotor realignment were not impaired for people with CRPS.
1307959800148393984 2020-09-21 16:28:11 +0800 <AVitterso> However, people with CRPS made greater pointing errors when using their affected hand than their non-affected hand. No such difference was seen in controls.
1307959537706688512 2020-09-21 16:27:09 +0800 <AVitterso> All participants made large pointing errors after the prism goggles were removed, indicative of sensorimotor realignment. The magnitude of this realigment did not differ betwen people with CRPS and pain-free controls.
1307958818597490688 2020-09-21 16:24:17 +0800 <AVitterso> There was no sig. difference between people with CRPS and pain-free controls in the number of trials needed correct for the prismatic shift (i.e. strategic recalibration).
1307958425289142272 2020-09-21 16:22:43 +0800 <AVitterso> We examined adaptation to goggles that created a lateral prismatic shift in vision (i.e. prism adaptation) in people with CRPS.
