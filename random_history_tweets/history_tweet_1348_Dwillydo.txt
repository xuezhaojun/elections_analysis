1344065861846528006 2020-12-30 07:40:47 +0800 <Dwillydo> @philymac @JoeBilby1 @MalcolmNance I think the Brit sailors had morale issues -- "Booze, Buggery, and Brutality."  Also, the factors you mentioned, from fighting seriously inferior foes, had resulted in a great degree of arrogance among British captains.  Finally, the USN frigates were BIG and heavily gunned.
1344064559989010435 2020-12-30 07:35:37 +0800 <Dwillydo> @JoeBilby1 @MalcolmNance "NJ history?"  That must be a typo, considering that Old Ironsides (oldest active-duty ship in the USN) was built and now berthed in Boston, Massachusetts.  (A good book about Constitution and sister ships is "Six Frigates." Can't remember the author's name.)
1344062194040922113 2020-12-30 07:26:13 +0800 <Dwillydo> @seanhannity Yeah. That's what Trump said.  Maybe you should check the DJ, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ for the past month and a half.  But of course, you have all the "alternative facts" you need to feed your sucker audience.
1344061715877650432 2020-12-30 07:24:19 +0800 <Dwillydo> @Helen504 I don't know how any society can endure when so many of its members have no concept of empathy or even the most minimal shared sacrifice.  (And it's a hell of a notion to call wearing a goddammed mask a "sacrifice" of any degree.)
1344019068135858178 2020-12-30 04:34:51 +0800 <Dwillydo> @girlsreallyrule LBJ said:  “If you can convince the lowest white man that he’s better than the best black man, he won’t notice that you’re picking his pockets. Hell, give him someone to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.”  I really can’t think of any better explanation.

1343967371036405762 2020-12-30 01:09:25 +0800 <Dwillydo> @NikkiHaley So can we safely expect that you and your party will be acting to eliminate Social(ist) Security, Medicare, public transportation (including public roads), police and fire departments, and public schools?  What else comes under "socialism" in your dimly lit perception?
1343966535648489480 2020-12-30 01:06:06 +0800 <Dwillydo> @kurteichenwald "We the people" are the opening words to the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, which lists six goals that document was intended to accomplish (including the most ignored: "promote the general Welfare").

I'm not saying a Trump "Reichstag Fire," as an excuse to enact some version of martial law, is probable. I am saying that it is possible, and what we've seen from GOP officials since the election supports that fear.  They are fascists.  https://t.co/jwmbfnliTo
1343000380452581376 2020-12-27 09:06:57 +0800 <Dwillydo> @robertkmurphy1 I've spent a few hours on Twitter today (something I am not proud of).  This is without a doubt the stupidest thing I've read all day. (and that includes Trump, Hannity, Donny Junior, etc.)  Bye now.
1342999851450118152 2020-12-27 09:04:50 +0800 <Dwillydo> @JamesSurowiecki Do you really think the GOP couldn't steamroll the Dems by accusing them of "treason" for opposing measures "taken to protect the American people"?  Yes, it sounds farfetched -- but so does so much of the past four years. (Actually, longer: Think Merrick Garland.)
1342999208702439424 2020-12-27 09:02:17 +0800 <Dwillydo> @JamesSurowiecki "Law is that which is boldly asserted and plausibly maintained." Aaron Burr.  I'm not saying it's likely, but what if there just happened to be an attack on the Homeland, on the scale of 9/11?  President and govs have considerable power to "call out the militia," i.e., Nat Guard.
1342997179833712641 2020-12-27 08:54:14 +0800 <Dwillydo> To declare martial law would need a good excuse.  Since November 2016 I've been predicting a Trump version of the Reichstag Fire.  I was starting to think it's too late. But now I'm rethinking that.  Perhaps a fake "terrorist attack" orchestrated by a former spy initials "VP"?

What's especially disheartening is that 74 million Americans voted for fascism, although many of them probably did not recognize it because few Democratic politicians and fewer media had the courage to point out that "unpleasant" fact.  https://t.co/PTLuecQaMe

1342927122638254080 2020-12-27 04:15:51 +0800 <Dwillydo> Does this scare you?  A much larger percentage of Americans approve of Trump than Germans ever approved of Hitler.  In the1933 election, "despite waging a campaign of terror against their opponents, the [Nazis] only tallied 43.9 percent of the vote."   https://t.co/FQVWo8fxt6  https://t.co/9eqsnE2UuI

Since November 2016 I've been predicting a Trump version of the Reichstag Fire.  I was starting to think it's too late. But now I'm rethinking that.  Perhaps a camouflaged "terrorist attack" orchestrated by Trump's Russian ally?

1340658907325362176 2020-12-20 22:02:46 +0800 <Dwillydo> @dnvolz Trump will move to Russia.  Why not? Javanka and The Boys can tend to his "business empire," he can go ahead with Trump Towers Moscow, he'll be immune from extradition, and he can continue his assault on America with full GOP support.  He's paid his dues, so he'll be welcomed.

Front-runner among the worst states for income, education, health care, opiate use, and so many other factors.  But the reason KY is the worst is that despite all that, they re-elected Ultimate Asshole McConnell.

1337886521475600384 2020-12-13 06:26:18 +0800 <Dwillydo> @AshaRangappa_ In 1923, Adolph Hitler was convicted of treason and sentenced to prison. Ten years later he was chancellor of Germany.  Never underestimate the ability of a ruthless and focused minority party to overcome a much larger, liberal-minded, and diverse (aka, fragmented) majority.
1337885541770129408 2020-12-13 06:22:24 +0800 <Dwillydo> @ASFried This would be greatly amusing -- until you consider that these guys' objection to the GOP is, apparently, that they have not supported an actual violent insurrection against the USA.  Because that is, really, about the only thing the "mainstream" GOP has not done.  So far.

1337572232965599240 2020-12-12 09:37:25 +0800 <Dwillydo> @GFano2 The same as the rest of the year, which is to marvel at the hypocrisy of people who profess to follow the teaching of Jesus Christ, while utterly ignoring his teaching, e.g., the Sermon on the Mount.  Me: If there is a God, the only thing we know for sure is, he can't be trusted.

Trump is of course the gold standard, but Republicans in general prove the validity of this statement every election.

1337302877891649537 2020-12-11 15:47:06 +0800 <Dwillydo> @kurteichenwald I’ve been saying this for years. And folks should not think that Trump’s defeat ends the threat:  In 1923 Adolph Hitler was convicted of treason and sent to prison.  Ten years later he was chancellor of Germany.

But a more compelling reason to shut down this account is that tweets like this (are least) implicit incitements to violence.

Or, you could continue to add fuel to the brush pile and wait for someone to toss a match -- at which point we know you will shrug and say, "Who? Me?"

1336738195589959682 2020-12-10 02:23:15 +0800 <Dwillydo> @realDonaldTrump Is a "so-called bookie" something like a "so-called president"?
1336541945091551233 2020-12-09 13:23:26 +0800 <Dwillydo> @ASFried It's because the Constitution, like the Bible, is not meant to be read, let alone followed.

1336432381167865859 2020-12-09 06:08:04 +0800 <Dwillydo> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are nothing but a wannabe Adolph Hitler, without the rhetorical skills -- or the principles.

1335696742998794241 2020-12-07 05:24:54 +0800 <Dwillydo> Unless Democrats take the offensive by, above all, NOT shrugging off every criminal attempt by the AFP to subvert elections, it will soon be over for "America" -- as an ideal, rather than a mere trademark.
1335696742143188992 2020-12-07 05:24:54 +0800 <Dwillydo> I've been saying this since the 2016 election, but what has happened during the past month should leave no doubt.  V.I.

1335696740834570243 2020-12-07 05:24:53 +0800 <Dwillydo> Why the hell is it that it is perfectly acceptable for Repubs to call Dems "communists," but Democrats don't have the balls to call Repubs what they truly are?

1335632475473793026 2020-12-07 01:09:31 +0800 <Dwillydo> Has it occurred to anyone that the most important person in the United States right now is Gen. Mark Milley?

Democrats have problems, largely due to their commitment to democracy, which means they cannot help but be frequently fragmented.  Republicans, however, are fascists. If you don’t get that, we’re in huge trouble.  Just read the definitions.  https://t.co/7kaI3GfTYo
1335608363854553089 2020-12-06 23:33:43 +0800 <Dwillydo> Absolutely. Here’s hoping that Biden’s presidency isn’t just a speed bump on the road to full blown autocracy.  Because it’s clear that other than a handful of outliers, Republicans won’t stand in the way.

1334183982460772353 2020-12-03 01:13:44 +0800 <Dwillydo> @BlondeinKevlar I'm assuming it involves children. I'm also assuming you don't have kids around that age.  That makes it really hard to handle. But it is definitely a motivator.  Of course the public has no idea, and if you tried to tell them they'd tune you out.  Hang in there.

1334179362191642625 2020-12-03 00:55:22 +0800 <Dwillydo> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump It's important to know that in 1923, after a failed coup attempt, Hitler was convicted of treason and sent to prison.  But his party continued to feed on lies and discontent. Ten years later, he was elected (with 40% of the vote.)  If that sounds familiar, it should.

A very brief history lesson:  In 1923, Adolph Hitler was convicted of treason and sentenced to 5 years in prison. He served 9 months.  Ten years later he was elected chancellor of Germany.  You know the rest.

1330269261089140739 2020-11-22 05:58:01 +0800 <Dwillydo> Nothing Trump does or doesn't do bothers me. What bothers me is that nearly half of American voters think this is not only acceptable, but commendable.  Let's face it: We are soooooo fucked. (And by "we" I mean "you." I'm old, white, male, childless, and "financially secure.")

1329955909330726914 2020-11-21 09:12:52 +0800 <Dwillydo> She's right, you know.  Obama, with the best of intentions, blew it by thinking the fascist Republicans had even a modicum of concern for the well-being of the nation.   It looks as if Biden, with all the benefit of hindsight, is about to go down the same path.

1329911308695822337 2020-11-21 06:15:39 +0800 <Dwillydo> This is what I'm talking about. This is beyond "ordinary fallibility," which is something all of us have suffered from. It's gross negligence -- or worse -- and should be severely sanctioned.   https://t.co/X2ikA8wUCJ
1329907892087042048 2020-11-21 06:02:04 +0800 <Dwillydo> Damn right.

(Although I don't get how votes not counted can result in more votes for Trump, unless someone DID count them.)  Kayleigh McInanity.

1329061480629678082 2020-11-18 21:58:44 +0800 <Dwillydo> @realDonaldTrump Right. And the Nazis won World War Two.  Oh, wait -- is that where we're going?
1329060901924769794 2020-11-18 21:56:26 +0800 <Dwillydo> @llcoolj Because to Republicans, the right to life begins at conception -- and ends at birth.
1328817658830221316 2020-11-18 05:49:52 +0800 <Dwillydo> I'm sure that Trump's reaction -- and worse, that of his millions of minions -- would be, "What kind of loser does this?"
1328816686351454208 2020-11-18 05:46:00 +0800 <Dwillydo> Only in America.  Could these two thieves be in the United States Senate instead of jail.  Remember: In the waning days of the Roman Empire, to show his contempt for the rule of law, Emperor Caligula named his horse as a senator.  The Roman Senate -- SPQR -- rolled over.

Wait! I know! It’s because you’re a fucking hypocrite. Just like LeningradLindsey and the rest of  your gang of GOP traitors.
1328703000639102978 2020-11-17 22:14:16 +0800 <Dwillydo> I normally try to avoid whataboutism, but can you imagine the reaction from Fox and Republicans - including LeningradLindsey - if, say, Warren or Schumer was accused of doing something like this?
1328661890562727936 2020-11-17 19:30:54 +0800 <Dwillydo> @JoeNBC Yes, but let’s not forget: Only the little people pay taxes.  The “president” surely does not.

1328307784769802241 2020-11-16 20:03:49 +0800 <Dwillydo> This is true. Media should not legitimize treason -  even “soft” treason.
1328174343407407104 2020-11-16 11:13:34 +0800 <Dwillydo> I've said for many years, a true conservative is someone who fights their own wars, pays their own bills, and respects other people's civil rights as much as they cherish their own. Republicans are not conservatives.

1327352648341700608 2020-11-14 04:48:27 +0800 <Dwillydo> @NarangVipin @kurteichenwald The short answer is no. The longer answer is that they are fascists, and as such adhere to the Leadership Principle. Like this:  https://t.co/Bn60xibsbj
1327333616947486725 2020-11-14 03:32:49 +0800 <Dwillydo> Just google "citizenship test." I'll say it loud and clear: Anyone who cannot pass this test should not be allowed to vote for anyone for any public office.  (I'd say it should apply to candidates, but that might be illegal. If it is, we should change that law too.)
1327331852756070404 2020-11-14 03:25:48 +0800 <Dwillydo> @MollyJongFast Seriously, rather than make voting mandatory as some suggest, we should require people to qualify.  How about requiring voters to pass the same test we require of immigrants seeking citizenship?  This shit really isn't funny, when you consider the power of such ignorance.
1327329404343656449 2020-11-14 03:16:05 +0800 <Dwillydo> @realDonaldTrump Hey, "Sir." Maybe if you had at least TRIED to do something to prevent the deaths of a quarter-million Americans, you might have got enough votes that you would not now be a LOSER!

1326645187003736065 2020-11-12 05:57:15 +0800 <Dwillydo> As of 11/11, Biden is up by more than 5 million votes.  Takes huge brass balls to claim fraud in that case -- but that's Republifascists for you.

Maybe you're right. One thing I don't get why the NRA doesn't fight the ban on full autos.  Can it be the gun manufacturers have no financial interest in that?

As much as you can from anyone you can. But hey, like slavery to rednecks, it's your heritage as a Trump.  https://t.co/LNKbhQjYnR

Physical ability or disability doesn't matter.  BUT HYPOCRISY ALWAYS MATTERS!  Why? Because hypocrisy is the rope that hypocrites use to strangle other human beings, while pretending to be morally superior to them and us.

1314636526576431105 2020-10-10 02:39:07 +0800 <Dwillydo> @MysterySolvent A shit sandwich.
1314634010522529795 2020-10-10 02:29:07 +0800 <Dwillydo> @imillhiser It matters a lot. I've heard guys who never made $50,000 a year ranting about the "death tax." Because of that they voted GOP.  As for "court packing," how about instead calling it what it is:  "Court balancing."  Language matters. Read Orwell.
1314632301071011841 2020-10-10 02:22:19 +0800 <Dwillydo> @fred_guttenberg It's common knowledge that Repubs are better than Dems at labels: "Death tax", "partial birth abortion," etc.  Now Dems seem to have adopted "court packing," which reeks of -- well, reekiness.  How about instead calling it what it is:  "Court balancing."  And overdue since 2016.

1314510593416728576 2020-10-09 18:18:42 +0800 <Dwillydo> Do you suppose they’ll claim they were following the orders of their commander-in-chief, who said, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”
1314344669736828928 2020-10-09 07:19:23 +0800 <Dwillydo> @TeaPainUSA Now where in the world would they get the idea that they should "LIBERATE MICHIGAN"?

The layers build up and erase any detail, and the new layers don't adhere so they crack and peel.  That's what Trump looks like.

1313631914234908672 2020-10-07 08:07:09 +0800 <Dwillydo> @ASFried Funny that Bill doesn't permit replies from just any old Mainer.  Because I would like to know how he arrived at the conclusion that this is a "dirty trick," when Collins has voted with Trump 94%. And Dem party is clearly identified; in fact, he posted it. I expected better.
1313615104907390978 2020-10-07 07:00:21 +0800 <Dwillydo> And if you figure it's all worth it because your 401k has been steadily rising -- well, take a deeeep breath.

1312493414798123008 2020-10-04 04:43:09 +0800 <Dwillydo> Just saw this in the NYT:  "Joe Biden had a negative coronavirus test and planned to proceed with events. But President Trump’s hospitalization injected volatility into the race."  "injected volatility?" Holy Shit, Times.

1310577721999798272 2020-09-28 21:50:52 +0800 <Dwillydo> “Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.”   This oft-repeated quotation is carved over the entrance of the national headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service in Washington, D.C. It is attributed, correctly, to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.
1310577046083563520 2020-09-28 21:48:11 +0800 <Dwillydo> @micfrd Of course, you assume (or choose to pretend) that Trump complied with the tax laws, rather than violating them. If someone has nothing to hide, why are they hiding something? GIGO.
1310572952459587587 2020-09-28 21:31:55 +0800 <Dwillydo> @jdwickie Or, more realistically, telling their lawyer to tell the FBI they're ready to cut a deal.

1308531325184417794 2020-09-23 06:19:13 +0800 <Dwillydo> @Trump_Detester Good question, but under the law the answer is, I believe, yes. Question for you: How does that work in Canada?
1308530950620487685 2020-09-23 06:17:44 +0800 <Dwillydo> @DaveMunrosCat True trivia. In Maine, USA, many years ago now(which is in fact for many of us your jealous neighbor), a driver was convicted of "obstructing government administration" for doing just that. The Maine Supreme Court overturned the conviction, saying warning people is not a crime.

1308505730518077441 2020-09-23 04:37:31 +0800 <Dwillydo> @alixabeth I think the American Fascist Party (AFP) is literally accurate.

As a jurist in the fine tradition of Roland Freisler, you know  that the "Rule of Law" is simply a mask you put on when you feel required to justify your actions.  But when you have The Power you can dispense with the pretense that anything else matters.  Sig Heil!
1308501050035507202 2020-09-23 04:18:55 +0800 <Dwillydo> Everyone in the USA should be required to read this. Whether they want to or not, whether they choose to believe it or not. The "anarchist city" designations are another manifestation of Trump admin's pure fascism.

From the Maine Supreme Court today regarding GOP's campaign for a "people's veto" of ranked-choice voting, which voters already approved twice.

1301730004775194624 2020-09-04 11:53:12 +0800 <Dwillydo> @JuddPDeere45 @PressSec Yes, I'm sure you are right. Because everyone knows it would be completely out of character for Trump to mock anyone who actually served their country, including a Medal of Honor winner (McCain), a Muslim officer who was KIA, and "my generals," McMaster, Mattis, and Kelly.
1301728706881351680 2020-09-04 11:48:03 +0800 <Dwillydo> @RudyGiuliani So what do you say about a guy who can't even read a fracking Teleprompter?  "Where's Rudy?"  https://t.co/vi8ewkxwiY

Closing in on 200,000 dead Americans because Donald Trump has his head up his ass, and "Judge Jeanine" is blathering about Pelosi's hair.  Hey, why not throw in a little Benghazi and Her Emails while you're on the Great Distraction Tour?
1301682350485573632 2020-09-04 08:43:51 +0800 <Dwillydo> @Alyssafarah @realDonaldTrump You're right! Donald Trump is the greatest commander in chief this country has ever seen, with the possible exception of George Washington, although some say Trump is better and who are we to argue with them.  And he signed the vets' bill that Obama signed first -- WHAT COURAGE!

The real question is, what does this say about those continue to stand by him?  I can't see a reason other than that they are fascists, consumed by resentment for anyone smarter or happier than they are.  https://t.co/Kxop5Roo9S

Know what depends on what is the key to good grades.  So Barr is actually demonstrating his wisdom: Whether voting twice is illegal "depends." And I think we all know what in Barr's mind it depends on.

1301211197811949568 2020-09-03 01:31:39 +0800 <Dwillydo> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SBAgov So the federal government is "lending" my hard-earned tax dollars to people who were too lazy to earn and save on their own.  And the "White House" brags about buying votes with my money.  But it's Democrats who are socialist.  Right.
1301209046117220360 2020-09-03 01:23:06 +0800 <Dwillydo> Just asking, but if someone were to shoot a prominent politician whom the shooter believed was trying to destroy the country, could the person claim self-defense?  I mean, if it works for Rittenhouse, why not anyone?

1300603045630349312 2020-09-01 09:15:04 +0800 <Dwillydo> The big question now is the extent to which the “mainstream media” will allow Trump to define the issues.  Will ”law &amp; order” be made to seem more important than     more deaths and evictions and lost jobs?  Or will a plan to, e.g., address income inequality be just too boring?
