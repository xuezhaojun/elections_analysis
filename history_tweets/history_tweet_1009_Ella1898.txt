1343906684423593985 2020-12-29 21:08:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @TonyH091963 All fits. Know which side I'm on.🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1343905347388452865 2020-12-29 21:02:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @Anna_Soubry Yes, a never ending extension then collapse would suite you I'm sure. At least businesses now know where they stand and can get on with any changes necessary.
1343904606129168385 2020-12-29 21:00:01 +0800 <Ella1898> @RabHutchison Nigel of course. A total no brainer  That Blair is even being considered for a Knighthood is an insult to the nation and especially for the families of those who lost their sons and daughters in the Iraq war.
1343903616197865472 2020-12-29 20:56:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitBetrayed Ooh, surprise, surprise.
1343903259560448006 2020-12-29 20:54:40 +0800 <Ella1898> @NicolaSturgeon Mrs. Sturgeon, you talk as if Scotland is a separate entity when as you know, of course, it is part of the UK and the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU. Whipping up anti England and Scottish Nationalism only serves to create bad feeling and division. Is that what you want?
1343567066146734080 2020-12-28 22:38:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @JoSwindleson You were going to be our next PM I recall.  That didn't work out to well either did it?
1343566581943726081 2020-12-28 22:36:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @DaveLloyd1234 Lobotomy, perhaps?
1343565593220419584 2020-12-28 22:32:54 +0800 <Ella1898> @irnbrudreaming To be fair sure not all scots hate the English just Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP mob.  Let's not tar them all with the same brush.

1343196983268433920 2020-12-27 22:08:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @kwilliam111 @MetroUK Believe the UK tax payers contributes about 1.5 billion in Foreign Aid so there should be no need for begging ads.
1343195772460920835 2020-12-27 22:03:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @kwilliam111 @MetroUK Don't know what there is to be proud about?  People like Stacey Dooley are just trying to help and raise awareness to try and raise money.  Why should they be castigated for that just because they are white?

1341814510689071106 2020-12-24 02:34:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @Peston Tony Blair must rate as one of the most hated men in the Britain. With his appalling record don't think anyone is interested in what he has to say.

1341738714201018369 2020-12-23 21:33:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @Startinglifeag1 If there is one thing I have learned during these past 4 years of Brexit it's not to believe everything you read or hear on the news or trust politicians. It is laughable how gullible some people are.
1341737519411572741 2020-12-23 21:28:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @adrian_sleeman @FlyingSte Think there was some unnecessary panic buying.  People are like a load of spooked sheep at the merest suggestion of shortages.
1341737014471909377 2020-12-23 21:26:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @FlyingSte As a remoaner you have obviously bought in to all this scare mongering.  As for the lefty, EU loving BBC wouldn't believe a word they say.  Roll on 31st December.
1341736159735635973 2020-12-23 21:23:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @FlyingSte The shelves emptied because of panic buying not because of Macron closing the border.
1341735415477391362 2020-12-23 21:20:25 +0800 <Ella1898> @SodknowsMikey @PoliticsPollss must be a matter of opinion then.
1341734909476544514 2020-12-23 21:18:25 +0800 <Ella1898> @Startinglifeag1 Think it's inappropriate and unprofessional for nurses to air  their political views in the workplace.  People are in hospital to get well not to be lectured on Brexit.

1341730644083286017 2020-12-23 21:01:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitDuck That was inevitable although, of course, it's nothing to do with Brexit.

1341023434155974664 2020-12-21 22:11:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidJonesMP Just another delaying tactic.  It has been quite clear for some time that the EU have no intention of negotiating any deal favourable to the UK and Boris needs to have the courage to walk away now.  With every delay people are losing more and more faith in him.

1339200890255847438 2020-12-16 21:29:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @AndrewBowie_MP Probably thinks makes him look important.  Really is the most b o r i n g man in Parliament.

No matter how you portray things you can't change history. What would people say if a white actress played the part of Rosa Parkes, for instance?
1338882900654166017 2020-12-16 00:25:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @Rob_Kimbell @MartinTwigs68 Incredible, isn't it what can be done when countries negotiate in good faith.  We have Liz Truss to thank for working tirelessly to achieve all this.
1338882404564541440 2020-12-16 00:23:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @boblister_poole @Tessacan61 The EU have shown themselves for what they really are and are no friends of ours.  No deal would be the best outcome to be entirely free of them.

She deserves some recognition for all her hard work.  Well done Liz.👏👏👏

1338561014284099584 2020-12-15 03:06:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @LorX0X And Brits don't give a fig what you think.

1338552805385072640 2020-12-15 02:33:52 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitBassist Beats me why anyone pays attention to these pathetic snowflakes who see offense in everything and lack any sense of humour. Need to keep a sense of proportion in all things.
1338194519678971907 2020-12-14 02:50:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidJoBrexit If this is true, and it may well be, don't know why politicians try to dupe the public as there are many who will see right through their chicanery. It would be an insult to all those who voted in good faith for the Conservative Party.
1338192054694924290 2020-12-14 02:40:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @JumboSmith2 Have no expectations whatsoever of the EU compromising  or dropping any of their unreasonable demands.  Today was the deadline, now it's next week. Time to do as promised and walk away.

1338118867059691520 2020-12-13 21:49:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @jjcwow @brexitisus As Scotland is part of the UK Nicola Sturgeon does not have the power to do that.  Seems to be a fanatical hatred of England that spurs her on to oppose anything in our joint interests.

That's his choice but he will have to accept the consequences.

Your actions just antagonise the public.     Climate change is important but you need to find more persuasive means instead of fanatical bullying and intimidation.
1337786295435845632 2020-12-12 23:48:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @GowTolson Wouldn't like to second guess on either score.  Believe nothing until it happens

1337448254301155331 2020-12-12 01:24:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @ActionBrexit Agree 100%.  She has been working tirelessly securing trade deals all over the world without a mention.  Liz Truss deserves some recognition and praise for all her hard work.

As you say Angela Merkel and Macron were calling the shots. Believe the UK had very little say or influence. A clean break would be the best thing ever.
1337443263087857667 2020-12-12 01:04:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @GrahamJ18821678 Fanatical is the right word.  Ardent remainers will never accept leaving the EU and blame every problem on Brexit no doubt cheered on the by BBC and MSM. They would rather see our country go down the pan than accept leaving on our own terms
1337441385612517377 2020-12-12 00:57:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @patsy_murrell The EU have not treated the UK with respect.  They have been impossible to negotiate with from day one when they sneered at and ridiculed our then PM.  Further talks would be pointless.  Boris needs to walk away now.
1337440414157185025 2020-12-12 00:53:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @sarahwollaston How he is remembered depends pretty much on whether you voted to remain or leave the UE.
1337038280043409410 2020-12-10 22:15:41 +0800 <Ella1898> @RogerHelmerMEP With Brexit we have learned never to be sure or trust anything until it happens.  We were fooled by Theresa May for some time. Hope Boris is genuine.  He is finished if he lets us down.
1337037401043181568 2020-12-10 22:12:12 +0800 <Ella1898> @OhBrokenBritain @christi73224817 @10DowningStreet It's really make or break for Boris.  He can be a Brexit hero (to Leavers) setting Britain free or he can be remembered badly as a failure and hand Labour the next election on a plate.

1337031022576345100 2020-12-10 21:46:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidLammy Not hard to imagine the mess we would be in now if Labour had won the last election.  Under extremely difficult and unforeseen circumstances (Covid 19) think Boris is doing a fairly good job.
1336754073446600710 2020-12-10 03:26:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @JayneDWales No sense of proportion.
1336753417558118403 2020-12-10 03:23:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @UK_4_Democracy Hope he realises this. He can walk away and be a Brexit hero or give in to EU demands and destroy the Conservative Party and hand the next election to Labour.

1336307388052287488 2020-12-08 21:51:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @profsked Hope so because there are no signs of the EU dropping their ridiculous demands that would make Brexit a BRINO. Leaving is about becoming a free and sovereign country again and nothing less will do.

1336303893953847299 2020-12-08 21:37:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @taracartergmc How right we were, indeed.👏  The UK led the way and others will follow.  Just hope it's not spoiled by agreeing to any of the EU's ridiculous demands on trade.

She made you feel far less likely to trust the words of any politician ever again.  She feigned belief in Brexit when in reality she was a resigned leaver.

How can you call yourself a decent human being if you support violent rapists and murderers remaining in our country? Do they ever think about the victims of these criminals or future victims if allowed to remain?

No deal is far better than a bad deal for the UK.
1335213848891101185 2020-12-05 21:26:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @CorbynistaEdith Overjoyed.
1335213539506745344 2020-12-05 21:24:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @richardjon123 @johnredwood The UK left the EU on 3st1January 2020. It's the trade deal they are trying to negotiate but if we were to agree to any of the EU's terms it would be as good as not having left at all.  Sovereignty, fishing and control of our laws are red lines not to be crossed for most leavers.
1335212010267693056 2020-12-05 21:18:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulaBrexiteer Maybe just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Give people a bit of power and it's almost always abused.

1334935909595279362 2020-12-05 03:01:37 +0800 <Ella1898> Hope Boris is aware that if he does the Conservative Party is finished.
1334845323001401345 2020-12-04 21:01:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @emilyhewertson What a sad situation that there are those who wish our country to fail rather than prosper under our own steam.☹️
1334844080560410625 2020-12-04 20:56:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitHome Walking away is the only solution and the only way to be entirely free of the EU but sadly don't think Boris has the stomach for it.

1334840333096652806 2020-12-04 20:41:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @squeezyjohn @DavidLammy My point is about maintaining some sort of standards in Parliament and setting a good example. Can't imagine Jacob Rees-Mogg responding any other way than with respect and good manners if the situation was reversed.
1334531119115628547 2020-12-04 00:13:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @liambyrnemp Q. Do you ever give a passing thought to the victims of these violent criminals who could quite easily go on to commit further crimes.  They forfeited any right to live here when they committed the crime. Think you are out of touch with the views of the British public.
1334529486419849226 2020-12-04 00:06:38 +0800 <Ella1898> @MigrationWatch Tax payers cash would be better spent patrolling our own shores.  The French are happy to take the money and do nothing.

The vaccine may have been tested by volunteers but there could be adverse effects further down the line. No one should be coerced into having the vaccine for any reason or refused medical treatment.

1334162489215504386 2020-12-02 23:48:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidLammy Whether Jacob Rees-Mogg is right or wrong, to call a fellow MP a 'liar' is extremely rude and disrespectful and says more about your character than his.
1334160654765346817 2020-12-02 23:41:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @libdemdaisy Another reason for decent people to never vote for toxic Labour.
1334160375424626688 2020-12-02 23:39:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @libdemdaisy No decent right thinking person would want these people, who have committed serious crimes, to remain in our country.  Would it make a difference if they were white, I wonder, or is all about colour.

1332355270341779458 2020-11-28 00:07:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paulbaldy1 As a woman sometimes feel a bit sorry for men, never knowing if you they doing the right thing or not. Think majority of women appreciate good manners so carry on being polite.  If a woman is 'offended' that's her problem.
1332353963988021249 2020-11-28 00:01:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @BarrySheerman Well, that would be a convenient excuse for yet further delay wouldn't it?

1331950134758936576 2020-11-26 21:17:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @BBCNews Only just noticed? If the BBC want to save themselves they should start by broadcasting the news in an unbiased fashion and stop constantly pushing woke diversity upon the public who pay their wages.
1331949186401640448 2020-11-26 21:13:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @christopherhope Quite right too.

1331947647079428097 2020-11-26 21:07:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @Robt_O Mmmmm, probably widely criticised within the walls of the BBC and metropolitan elite but doubt the public are consulted for their opinion.  My guess is it's a very popular move on Rishi Sunak's part but should have gone further.

1331677379908014080 2020-11-26 03:13:23 +0800 <Ella1898> Giving away our fish and sovereignty would be a step to far and seen as a betrayal by many who voted Conservative.
1331676265720459266 2020-11-26 03:08:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @Peston @RishiSunak Problem is does the aid get to the world's poorest and the rate we are going there will be some of the world's poorest here in the UK.  Not opposed to Foreign Aid but feel it should be reduced and monitored to prevent fraud.

1331224981381013507 2020-11-24 21:15:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @Reprobate24 My concern is that when this virus is under control and life returns to something like normal, GP's will fight to keep with telephone appointments rather than face to face resulting in more serious illness going undiagnosed. Not good😞
1330954516125151237 2020-11-24 03:20:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @MrHarryCole That's one thing he is right about.  It's quite inappropriate and unfair when many are struggling to survive.
1330953985356869635 2020-11-24 03:18:52 +0800 <Ella1898> @PeterR2808 @MetroUK Agree but you can be sure there will be plenty of hand wringing, lefty/ Liberals pleading her case.  She was too young to know what she was doing etc, etc. and no doubt case funded by the British tax payer.😡
1330951558692007938 2020-11-24 03:09:14 +0800 <Ella1898> @brilantbk Just block them straight away.  You can't have a sensible debate with people like that.
1330874283413938179 2020-11-23 22:02:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @2tweetaboutit @MailOnline The death of individuality and humour at the hands of the 'woke' brigade.

1330873413813104640 2020-11-23 21:58:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @ukmedicx Depends on the definition of sexual harassment. In the woke environment we now live in probably a wolf whistle would be classed as sexual harassment.

The word racist is bandied about far to freely nowadays without any evidence to support it. What evidence do you have that Priti Patel is racist and she hasn't been sacked.  Perhaps you are the ignorant one.

1330523513787199492 2020-11-22 22:48:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @MichelleDewbs It is ridiculous and you would think they would use some discretion and common sense.  It's an easy job for Police but call them to say your house had been burgled and nothing would be done.

1330520142195908610 2020-11-22 22:34:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @PoliticsPollss @JayneDWales Do wish the Archbishop of Canterbury would stick to religion and not interfere in politics.  Plenty of money spent on foreign aid is given to countries that no longer need it or to corrupt governments or useless projects. There are plenty of needy causes in our own country.
1330518492609732610 2020-11-22 22:28:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @cuibono2016 @imranahmadkhan Depends what your definition of bullying is nowadays. Believe she raised her voice and swore at a Civil Servant for not getting on with the job.  Maybe a little unprofessional but hardly bullying and we are all human.
1330517262361571333 2020-11-22 22:23:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @imranahmadkhan Priti Patel is obviously a strong, driven, determined woman and a true Conservative.  Would imagine it is more a case of delicate Civil Servants not liking being told what to do especially be a woman.  There is no way she should lose her job or be moved because of it.

1330151468146581504 2020-11-21 22:09:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @_SaveOurStatues Utterly weak and pathetic giving in to these permanently offended snowflakes.  Most people would be offended by vandalising the memorial to those who fought for their country that we could live in a free country.😡
1330150540622368776 2020-11-21 22:06:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @brown12008 Good idea.  They certainly need some motivation to do a better job.

1330148807271649289 2020-11-21 21:59:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitBanter52 @RuckGeoff Double standards.  Truth is, civil servants think 'they' run the country, not the Government.  No doubt bitterly resented a strong woman telling them what to do and wanted to get rid of her.
1330147269761495047 2020-11-21 21:53:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulaBrexiteer @GowTolson Good for you.  Someone needs to keep an eye on it.  I can't watch it - get too annoyed.😡
1330146981776416771 2020-11-21 21:52:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @GowTolson No. What's the point of watching biased news.  People want a broadcaster that just states the news as it is without leftie 'woke opinions woven in. Don't watch it unless you want to feel annoyed.
1329807777590546439 2020-11-20 23:24:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitBanter52 @paulafr68963440 Very true.  Intelligence and common sense don't always go together.

1329802003174789121 2020-11-20 23:01:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @flufficat @Hermesparcels Hermes are utterly abysmal. They never deliver and make excuses like unable to deliver to address, customer requested return to sender or package damaged. Even complaining to CEO makes no difference.  Resorted to finding out carrier before ordering from anyone online.  DON'T USE.
1329800822063046659 2020-11-20 22:56:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @flufficat Probably don't like her and don't want to carry out her orders.  Civil Servants appear to believe they are in charge not the Government.

1329798538151268353 2020-11-20 22:47:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @0_politics2 And antisemitism.
1329798405175074821 2020-11-20 22:47:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @Keir_Starmer And not a good move allowing Jeremy Corbyn back into the Labour Party.  Just looks like a slapped wrist for appearances sake then back he comes.

1329794854927339523 2020-11-20 22:32:54 +0800 <Ella1898> @Lesqueenb @Keir_Starmer Hope you are right.
1329794479302320131 2020-11-20 22:31:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulaBrexiteer I had noticed a few people saying their accounts had been shut down and having to start again.  Bit alarming really as you feel people with the 'wrong' opinions are being silenced. Perhaps a sign of things to come.😡
1329780776557273092 2020-11-20 21:36:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @thetruebluechef Sadly, can't think of any country that hasn't been ruined by politicians.
1329779930159308800 2020-11-20 21:33:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulaBrexiteer Are you saying that twitter are closing down accounts just because someone reports it.  Don't they have to have a good reason?
1329779172835815428 2020-11-20 21:30:35 +0800 <Ella1898> What would the BBC know about high standards?
1329778892928815106 2020-11-20 21:29:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales BBC become more vile every day.  Never listen to their news or anything vaguely political. Hope people refuse to pay for a licence to listen to their bias, woke, propaganda.
1329506282064277508 2020-11-20 03:26:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales @SHIRLEYPARNELL Conspiracy theories out of control.

1329500206543605763 2020-11-20 03:02:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @0_politics2 @Joyceeee77 Hard to understand how the BBC can justify these salaries when they intend to pursue over 75's for licence fee.  Not to mention their bias news coverage you have to pay for if you want to watch tv.  DEFUND THE BBC.

1329401293836857344 2020-11-19 20:29:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales @bbcquestiontime All of them would annoy me and not the slightest bit interested in anything they have to say and that's why don't watch it any more.

1329399187763568642 2020-11-19 20:20:40 +0800 <Ella1898> @Lesqueenb @Keir_Starmer True, but the way the present Government is going makes it more and more likely the next Government could be a Labour one.  We will have to see what happens with Brexit because any betrayal will be the final straw.

1329395456988876802 2020-11-19 20:05:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @BBCNews Here we go again.  'someone' may be offended.  Every little bit of originality and joy is slowly but surely being squeezed out of British life just in case a minority of people 'may be offended'.  BBC telling us what we can and cannot listen to is unacceptable.
1329392576097607683 2020-11-19 19:54:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @markadayofdays @AnthJB4 Likewise. There are some truly awful people on twitter (abusive people instantly blocked) but there are far more nice, decent folk with sensible, interesting views and always good to connect with likeminded folk.

1329131732235325442 2020-11-19 02:37:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @BorisJohnson A lot of people think you are averting you attention away from more important things like getting Brexit done as promised AND no backing down. Please don't let us down Boris or it will be the end of the Conservative Party for a very long time.
1329129489071222797 2020-11-19 02:28:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @sense_reason @Bill_63 @Nigel_Farage People arriving in boats illegally look well fed, well dressed and all appear to have smart phones.  We are told they pay people trafficers thousands to get here.  Not the sort of people that put you in mind of a refugee.
1328772601225900039 2020-11-18 02:50:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @Bill_63 @Nigel_Farage There are refugees and there are economic migrants and certainly don't feel any sympathy for the latter, arriving here illegally from a safe country where free to apply for asylum.  Save your sympathy for our own rough sleepers who do not have the luxury of hotel bed.
1328765291862630401 2020-11-18 02:21:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @montie Charity begins at home and in the current climate there are plenty of our own poor people struggling that need help.

1328359852473786369 2020-11-16 23:30:43 +0800 <Ella1898> Too true.
1328359253904678912 2020-11-16 23:28:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @DonnaDlm71 No.  Never watched it.

1328358044904861698 2020-11-16 23:23:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @WendyPuerto Agree.  Think we need as much up to date, accurate  information as possible about the vaccine in order to make an informed decision.
1328356171292479488 2020-11-16 23:16:05 +0800 <Ella1898> Good advice, Nigel.
1328355787773718529 2020-11-16 23:14:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @addicted2newz Would any really sane person behave in such a way?  They should not be allowed to get away with vandalism and should be arrested.  They do not help their cause in any way, in fact quite the reverse.
1328354788149432322 2020-11-16 23:10:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @JeremyCordite Hope this is the case but with Brexit believe nothing until it has actually happened.
1328049708871331842 2020-11-16 02:58:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @my_suhr_guitar Just another instance of attack on freedom of speech.  Big Pharmaceutical Corporations make a lot of money out of selling their products so they have a vested interest in silencing dissenters.

1328044129776001031 2020-11-16 02:36:09 +0800 <Ella1898> @PoliticsPollss We have far too many unskilled people coming to the UK usually without any means of personal support but well educated, skilled people with the skills we are short of should be welcomed.

1327979543479660565 2020-11-15 22:19:30 +0800 <Ella1898> Blatant bullying.

1327975239364567040 2020-11-15 22:02:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @PhilStringer7 No doubt a 'hate crime' to say it though.
1327974678636482561 2020-11-15 22:00:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @OhBrokenBritain Wish he would say something to give us more confidence that there isn't going to be a sell out.  Hope he knows it will be curtains for Conservatives if he does.

1327627699846860800 2020-11-14 23:01:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @johnredwood Another thing Mr. Redwood.  If there is a sell out on Brexit confidently predict the next Government will be a Labour Government.
1327626130803879937 2020-11-14 22:55:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @johnredwood @tomorrow44444 Agree, Mr. Redwood, but a lot of people who gave the Conservatives their vote are feeling increasingly uneasy.  It appears clear that the EU have no intention of abandoning their unacceptable demands so why waste any more time and Leave on WTO.
1327624831592960000 2020-11-14 22:50:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @OhBrokenBritain @BorisJohnson We should call their bluff and not give in to bully boy tactics which appears to be the hallmark of the EU.  The UK needs to be completely free and unfettered from the far reaching poisonous tentacles of the EU.
1327624064559681537 2020-11-14 22:46:57 +0800 <Ella1898> Good point.

Always voted Conservative but a sell out on Brexit would be the last time they would get my vote.  Would never vote Labour myself but if a proper Brexit isn't  delivered Labour will be the next Government with or without dodgy postal votes.

1327322632832884737 2020-11-14 02:49:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @drdavidbull We desperately need an alternative to the major parties.  People are losing faith in Conservative Party especially with Brexit which is still dragging on with talks of ever further extensions on trade deal.

He has a right to his opinions and it is wrong that his career should be jeopardised just because some people do not like what he has to say.  No free speech, no democracy.

1326882473628868609 2020-11-12 21:40:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @SteveLaws_ Immigration is a complete and utter shambles and it appears just about anyone can arrive unchallenged.  Doubt if the majority have any skills to improve the nations.  We have more than enough unskilled workers, taxi drivers and delivery drivers, thanks.
1326880196801204224 2020-11-12 21:31:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @Katieraydee Why don't these do gooders campaign for our own under privileged people like veterans sleeping rough? These people came here illegally and expect to be fed and housed at no expense or effort to themselves. Where else in the world could this happen but here in the UK. 😡
1326604367223529473 2020-11-12 03:15:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @sandieshoes Some of these news readers and journalists are out of control and not fit for purpose. They convey their own personal opinions rather than the news as it is.
1326599838679650308 2020-11-12 02:57:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales @boblea21 It's the lefty morons who encourage them to come here with the expectation of everything being free.

1326518874762829826 2020-11-11 21:35:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @minky2013 Definitely not.  Why waste one moment of your precious time.
1326515903303921664 2020-11-11 21:23:31 +0800 <Ella1898> @TrippyPip For some people it is always someone else's fault when things go wrong.  What happened to personal responsibility?
1326515226695569408 2020-11-11 21:20:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @ukmedicx Macron is growing on me.  He has the courage to speak the truth.
1326514165842841601 2020-11-11 21:16:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @PhilipH21343285 Why on earth does anybody watch Sky News?  Like all the news channels they are completely biased and often rude and ignorant with it.  Why upset yourself.
1326513280249114630 2020-11-11 21:13:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @oflynnsocial So many things are poisoned now by woke politics, football, National Trust, even supermarkets.  There's no end to the stupidity.
1326511326743715841 2020-11-11 21:05:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @MrKenge @Lesqueenb @WendyPuerto @Article1066 Absolutely right.  Voting to decide who is going to represent the majority for our country for 4 years is one of of the most important events and therefore every possible step should be taken to prevent fraud.  Limited postal voting and ID cards for a start.
1326508349542817794 2020-11-11 20:53:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @acgrayling We fought two World wars in order to be free of dominance of another country.  The EU is outdated and will eventually fail.
1326507702550491137 2020-11-11 20:50:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @indymeansindy It's become a real minefield but sometimes it's necessary to give an accurate description of a person.  What term is it 'safe' to use nowadays without causing someone offence?
1326236122809315332 2020-11-11 02:51:46 +0800 <Ella1898> @Lesqueenb @WendyPuerto @Article1066 Nothing would surprise me.  That's the reason people should take a pen and not use pencils supplied at voting booth.
1326232232474906624 2020-11-11 02:36:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @DanielJHannan If the situation was reversed Democrats would be rioting in the streets screaming fraud.  There is some doubt over voter fraud and Trump has a right for it to be investigated.

1326143039002324992 2020-11-10 20:41:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @TheEnglishRebel That would be no better than never leaving in the first place. and totally unacceptable.  Walking away is the only way.
1326142046768336897 2020-11-10 20:37:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @malandergeorge Why on earth would Boris Johnson waste his valuable time to go on a programme for the sole purpose of being verbally abused?
1326140534784712709 2020-11-10 20:31:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @The_Fogeys Mr. grey and 'lovely peas, Norma'.😅
1326138360252014592 2020-11-10 20:23:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @hrrysgreysuit Love it.  And so true.
1326137483625684992 2020-11-10 20:19:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @hugh_pimple @AnneHalladey That's so he can come to the UK to lecture us on Brexit and remind us that we will be at the back of the queue when it comes to trading with US.
1325884044014391299 2020-11-10 03:32:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @bethvaughan15 @REP57910897 Very distasteful,  Spoiled the occasion somewhat, along with Tony Blair.

1325882381753065480 2020-11-10 03:26:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @BBCPolitics Doubt the majority of the British public give a toss about what Jo Biden thinks.  The UK must be a free and independent country, free of the EU and not a lapdog and at the beck and call of America.
1325880895446904832 2020-11-10 03:20:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @Lrihendry Definitely. 👍🖐️🙋
1325879889266937869 2020-11-10 03:16:13 +0800 <Ella1898> Absolutely right.
1325878854578278400 2020-11-10 03:12:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @AnnaBritannia @SeanAKehoe @TOMMORBRITISH1 Think it's a matter of fairness and transparency of the voting that people are concerned about.
1325877835005894656 2020-11-10 03:08:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @TheEnglishRebel Right!  No way America would join an outfit like the EU and have them making decisions for them.  Should keep his nose out of UK affairs.
1325450541468684293 2020-11-08 22:50:09 +0800 <Ella1898> @SusanEacock Democrat supporting Americans would probably vote for anyone just to get rid of Trump but you would have thought they could have come up with someone more appealing than Biden.
1325448798961807362 2020-11-08 22:43:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @MattHancock @JoeBiden 🤣👎
1325448584179949569 2020-11-08 22:42:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @naughtynoonoo48 Fixed before it started.
1325448425568133121 2020-11-08 22:41:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrookBayPirate Think postal voting should end for all apart from elderly/infirm, disabled or those with a valid reason for not being able to attend a voting station and all postal voting should be verified otherwise wide open to abuse.
1325445604869361666 2020-11-08 22:30:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @PhilipH21343285 Maybe that was the plan all along.
1325445238949875713 2020-11-08 22:29:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @jjcwow Fail to see what it has to do with Biden. would have thought America has more than enough of it's own problems.
1325444432011866114 2020-11-08 22:25:52 +0800 <Ella1898> @andreina1962 @naughtynoonoo48 @OlzAsbo @Publandlordyork @cjcheesecake @boblister_poole @Fairy_Woodland @karen23229032 Why do twitter do that.  Sometimes it's hard do know what it's ok to say and what  is not ok.  My guess is things will only get worse.  Followed.
1325443660348067843 2020-11-08 22:22:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @SusanEacock @mitsyarty Kate always looks beautifully groomed and dressed for the occasion.  William made the perfect choice for his wife.
1325443215558914054 2020-11-08 22:21:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @FlowerP79667758 Rather spoiled the occasion with Khan and Blair in attendance.
1325147965489471489 2020-11-08 02:47:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @0_politics2 @mitsyarty Sympathies  Difficult when a close member of your family has opposing views.  Sure you have a ready answer for him though.
1325147092373827584 2020-11-08 02:44:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @MaureenDalby @pritipatel True.
1325144095795408896 2020-11-08 02:32:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @confidencenac Just a figurehead and a puppet.
1325143728143601664 2020-11-08 02:30:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @LaylaMoran Democracy when it suites.
1325143214983143424 2020-11-08 02:28:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidLammy Breath-taking hypocrisy and lack of self awareness is almost laughable.  You showed little respect for the electorate over Brexit.
1325089906109116416 2020-11-07 22:57:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @chapman020 It's alarming and quite unfathomable to many people. We no longer have a news channel to report impartial, unbiased news and that is a very dangerous thing.
1325088932397244418 2020-11-07 22:53:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @toryboypierce @Keir_Starmer @realDonaldTrump Do these people ever really look honestly at themselves. Amazing lack of self awareness. Democracy and the wishes of the people meant nothing to Starmer when intent on derailing Brexit.
1325088180400496641 2020-11-07 22:50:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @MaureenDalby @pritipatel With so much going on it's easy for them to bury bad news.  No doubt they are still here housed and fed by us the tax payers with little chance of ever been returned from whence they came.
1325087592124133383 2020-11-07 22:47:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @kathy_kathys2 See your tweet.
1324700464236154882 2020-11-06 21:09:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @confidencenac @Fran66200939 Yep, we already know the answer. What a farce.
1324700113583906817 2020-11-06 21:08:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @Tessacan61 @johndmtb Think you are right.  Trump was never going to win even before the first vote was cast. All part of the NWO. Sad to think that America was once a held up as a beacon of democracy and the land of the free. The world is changing fast and sadly not in a good way.
1324697179840225280 2020-11-06 20:56:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @HHepplewhite Hard to believe there are no observers at these counting offices which should be mandatory to ensure fairness otherwise wide open to abuse. If Biden wins, which looks likely, will anyone truly believe Biden won fair and square?
1324695094809821184 2020-11-06 20:48:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @BBCWorld What evidence do the BBC have that there is NO evidence of voting fraud?  The BBC's bias is obvious.
1324694558685433857 2020-11-06 20:46:09 +0800 <Ella1898> @GowTolson Now if it was the other way round and Biden cried fraud, no doubt it would be believed immediately. Amazing bias and hypocrisy is what we have come to expect from the BBC.
1324693167384502275 2020-11-06 20:40:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @HHepplewhite If Biden is finally declared the winner, which looks likely, the stench of cheating, fraud and corruption is always going to follow him around.  There are dark forces at work and Trump was never going to win.
1324692268373204994 2020-11-06 20:37:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @SuffolkRoyal @RuleBrexitannia @Littledene39 Yes, these presenters are very full of themselves and like to make it all about themselves and their personal views.  Is there anywhere nowadays where you can hear straightforward, unbiased news.  I doubt it.
1324691543475867649 2020-11-06 20:34:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @RuleBrexitannia Impartiality from the BBC went out the window long ago.  Personally no longer listen to news or anything political on any channel but the insult is that we are expected to pay a licence fee to the BBC.  The BBC must be defunded then people at least can choose.
1324690647731871748 2020-11-06 20:30:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @stoney632 @BBCNews The BBC are a disgrace and don't care how the US election effects the UK.  No one should be forced to pay a licence fee to hear biased propaganda.  Defund the BBC.
1324688031316692995 2020-11-06 20:20:12 +0800 <Ella1898> @Wessex_Nick @Boo41817405 Morning Nick
1324437622631137281 2020-11-06 03:45:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @GregNorberg @HHepplewhite sounds like the equivalent of Labour in the UK.
1324436459332448257 2020-11-06 03:40:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitHome Since when was Ann Soubry in any position to demand Brexit be delayed?  We have lost count of the number of delays and should just leave as it' obvious negotiations are going nowhere.
1324431045446557697 2020-11-06 03:19:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @GrahamJ18821678 Maybe because what happens politically in America can effect the rest of the world especially the UK and people are rightly angry that there is plenty of evidence to suggest fraudulent voting in favour of Biden.
1324425516519198725 2020-11-06 02:57:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @Sozzinski @C53758546Mandy There are dark forces at work throughout Europe.  Biden was always going to win regardless.  All part of the NWO. So yes, very worrying and depressing especially for the younger generation who will have to live with it.
1324424079298973697 2020-11-06 02:51:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @JST9 Postal voting is wide open to fraud and in my opinion only the elderly, sick or disabled should be allowed to use postal voting.  There are usually voting stations near almost everyone so why use postal voting?
1324423134313959424 2020-11-06 02:47:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @Boo41817405 Always happy to follow a fellow patriotic Brexiteer.
1324071399468736512 2020-11-05 03:29:56 +0800 <Ella1898> Begs the question!
1324071025496231938 2020-11-05 03:28:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @SeanAKehoe Because the are all lefties and hate Trump.  The BBC bias is now a well known fact.  Not interested in anything they have to say politically.  As for Laura Kuenssberg, switch off as soon as se eyes on her.
1324069987619930115 2020-11-05 03:24:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @kazbahellis Sort of thing you might expect from China or North Korea.

1323951008788189184 2020-11-04 19:31:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @MSANNCOOPER @Majeh19 I had a similar call from someone claiming to be from HMRC saying if I didn't ring the number they gave action would be taken against me. Is there no end to these scams?  Sadly some elderly and vulnerable people may believe it to be genuine and feel intimidated by such a call.
1323950194027827200 2020-11-04 19:28:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @40_John_Doe @jf_hanley Because they hate Trump and want the Democrats to win.  If it was the other way round no doubt it would be a different story.
1323949094843359233 2020-11-04 19:23:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @Ricky_K67 @MouldsSylvia No more than a handful have been returned from whence they came.  Sadly, all empty words, nothing happens.

1323944102241718272 2020-11-04 19:04:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @AnnaBritannia It's a political thing in an attempt to destabilise the Government by causing as much disruption as possible.  Teachers are not putting the best interests of the children first.
1323942585208086528 2020-11-04 18:58:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @CrueltyFreeElli @mikemcg65624002 Just ignore these ignorant people that scream 'racist' and 'far right' at every opportunity and everything they don't agree with.  We must stand up to them and not be beaten by them. Wear your poppy with pride. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1323941151863431168 2020-11-04 18:52:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidLammy That won't be the Democrats then.
1323348236023771137 2020-11-03 03:36:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @LadBonnie Why is bigamy allowed in this country?  Can white people have more than one spouse now?
1323346812913278981 2020-11-03 03:30:41 +0800 <Ella1898> @markinneswilli Wonder how long Bunter Boulton would last in North Korea?

1323343362502676495 2020-11-03 03:16:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @Arwenstar @ecmagenda The polls were wrong last time round so who knows?
1323342930552201222 2020-11-03 03:15:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @kazbahellis Always thought there was something shifty about him.  Caused more damage to this country than anyone.
1323342515567775745 2020-11-03 03:13:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @SocialM85897394 Perhaps Tony Blair should be the first person to have the vaccine and we can see how it goes.
1323338994260811776 2020-11-03 02:59:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @LittleDi70 @LadBonnie Are there any real Londoners left?
1323338576726294531 2020-11-03 02:57:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @TelBabe Not surprised and there is no need for it.  Just causes problems with temporary low stocks in certain items.

1323261641316835328 2020-11-02 21:52:14 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulaBrexiteer Love your tweets Paula.  Really going for it this morning, good to get it out of your system.👍

1323259808896684032 2020-11-02 21:44:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @JeremyCordite No doubt it will go on, although what it is meant to achieve I don't know.  Nothing positive as far as I can see, just an annoyance.

1323257651615191041 2020-11-02 21:36:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @ukmedicx Nothing to do with him at all. Would have thought America has enough of it's own problems to sort out and very much doubt Biden is the man to do that.

1321076785505882114 2020-10-27 21:10:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @confidencenac That we have told the EU where to get off to and we are leaving without a 'deal'.  That would make my day.

1319635873319866369 2020-10-23 21:44:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @YorkshireLady3 Why is it that a lot of these people who complain about not been able to feed their kids are grossly overweight?
1319635093271564290 2020-10-23 21:41:38 +0800 <Ella1898> @citygirlnomore Compare that to take-aways, burgers and chips, ready meals and imagine there is a huge difference in price.
1319634600885452800 2020-10-23 21:39:41 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitHome @votes_17 Wish they would walk away save us doing it.
1319634179773136897 2020-10-23 21:38:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales @p13tobler Find it hard to believe there are any starving children in the UK. There is generous benefit system for those in need. More like the parents are not good money managers.
1319632772919590913 2020-10-23 21:32:25 +0800 <Ella1898> @andersleijersta @Gunderthswain Not sure what the definition of poverty is these days but know of a few people on benefits that live very comfortably.  The benefit system was set up as a safety net for the poor not to be used as a long term life style choice.
1319631915360595968 2020-10-23 21:29:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @AvonandsomerRob It's all about self promotion and virtue signalling.  If he is that bothered he could easily make a generous contribution.  Action speaks louder than words.
1319631034934349824 2020-10-23 21:25:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @G16Sam @LynneKettlebor1 @RuleBrexitannia It's a scandal that anyone can receive more in benefits than someone working full time.  Sure some people might say 'why bother'.
1319629608204062720 2020-10-23 21:19:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @StewartPinner1 It can be done and bet it will taste delicious. Way cheaper and much more nutritious than take-aways, ready meals and burgers and you actually know what's in it, free of additives/preservatives and just requiring a bit of time and effort.
1319627813222219777 2020-10-23 21:12:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @RuleBrexitannia Guess that's what they want a generation dependent on  Government from birth to grave ending up like Venezuela. That's after they have destroyed our culture, traditions and monarchy. Conservatives may not be up to scratch right now but the alternative doesn't bear thinking about.
1319626212000616448 2020-10-23 21:06:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @PilmoorMark @johndmtb Good for you.  Life's to short and the virus is not going to go away.  We have to get on with life and just take sensible precautions.
1319348024758382592 2020-10-23 02:40:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @johnredwood If they do The Conservative Party will be finished.  Many Labour voters loaned their vote to give the Government their huge majority and it would be an unforgivable betrayal of their trust.
1319341869571186693 2020-10-23 02:16:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @professor_mor @RuleBrexitannia @mcgheeianmcghee @0_politics2 A lot of home made dishes can be made quite cheaply plus they are usually far more tasty and nourishing than ready meals, chips, burgers etc.  There are some parents who need to look at their priorities in life .
1319283999823392770 2020-10-22 22:26:31 +0800 <Ella1898> @jjcwow Definitely walk away.  Think it was clear long ago that the EU would be uncooperative to the bitter end.  Not sure Boris has the balls to do so even though he has said he won't back down on certain issues like fishing.
1319283279841742850 2020-10-22 22:23:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @RuleBrexitannia @ChrisM1820 A fair few I bet.  Not forgetting the large screen tv, ipads etc. Not sure what the definition of poverty is nowadays??
1319282641489674241 2020-10-22 22:21:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @taracartergmc Hardly a good example of a poor starving family. 😅
1319281355184717825 2020-10-22 22:16:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @taracartergmc Sadly, there are some who believe they are entitled to everything for free and this is encouraged by the Labour Party for their own cynical ends.  Except nothing is for free. it's paid for by the hard working tax payer.
1319275803788521475 2020-10-22 21:53:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @SusanHarris80 Probably never happen but agree it should.
1319275092245835777 2020-10-22 21:51:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @JustineClaire65 It's not an unreasonable question at all to most of us but Labour use the less well off as a political pawn encouraging state dependency.
1319227014134583302 2020-10-22 18:40:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @RoamingWoodsman @_Gillespie_ Hit the nail on the head.
1319226088418136064 2020-10-22 18:36:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @RichardBurgon Nothing's for free.  Paid for by the tax payer.  Parents should learn to manage their money better.
1319224933176774657 2020-10-22 18:31:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @LynneKettlebor1 @AllisonDowden71 @Nigel_Farage Labour have always encouraged state dependency and are good at spending other people's money.
1318907963826982913 2020-10-21 21:32:17 +0800 <Ella1898> @Mal_DuBois State dependence is something Labour has promoted and encouraged. People should only have children they can afford to keep and not expect the tax payer to foot the bill.
1318905721740759040 2020-10-21 21:23:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @andreinawie @StaceyDooley Another crap programme to add to the rest of them.

1318904907597053952 2020-10-21 21:20:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @_Gillespie_ Yet if your house was been robbed or you were being assaulted the Police would be nowhere to be seen.
1318904396835672065 2020-10-21 21:18:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @chapman020 Feel pretty much the same.  The Conservatives have turned out to be a disappointment but there is currently no viable alternative.  We need a new party that truly represents the people.
1318614250278060034 2020-10-21 02:05:10 +0800 <Ella1898> @Cheeseo76847269 Can't understand why women make complains of a sexual nature years after the event and doesn't seem fair that a woman can remain anonymous yet the accused man can be ruined by the allegations even when proved untrue.

Is it any wonder the EU have never taken our negotiations seriously when people like Blackford keep telling them we don't really want to leave the EU. Traitorous.
1318525334690713600 2020-10-20 20:11:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @GaryLineker Another non event.

1318255518775975936 2020-10-20 02:19:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @Carti_Mandua Without a doubt and that has been a big part of their downfall.

1318252433445916674 2020-10-20 02:07:26 +0800 <Ella1898> @JoePorterUK Sour grapes because she made such a mess of it.

1318178497844678657 2020-10-19 21:13:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @Jimmymack010 to maintain a conspiracy that involves thousands of people would not be possible.  Believe Covid exists but perhaps Government has overreacted?
1318177325356355585 2020-10-19 21:08:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @JustinWelby Archbishop or Politician.  You can't be both.

1318173991857721344 2020-10-19 20:55:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @Iromg No one cares and it is not their place to comment on politics.  They ought to get their own house in order instead of getting involved in politics.

1317478912574849024 2020-10-17 22:53:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @tonycarmelo15 Very true, So sad to see what politicians have done to our country without consent of the British public.
1317477579599810561 2020-10-17 22:48:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @emerald1910 Hi Edmund, judging by the number of tweets you have received take heart in there a lot of lovely, kind, caring people out there.  Hope you soon feel better.

Said from OpenReach and there was a fault on internet and it could be fixed remotely by logging on to my laptop and tapping in their code which would have allowed them access to my laptop. luckily realised what they were up to and put the phone down.
1313806992750841856 2020-10-07 19:42:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @Blackburnjack Took a long time to figure that one out.

1312743606583730179 2020-10-04 21:17:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @addicted2newz It really is particularly obvious that Jon Sopel hates Donald Trump. The days of newsreaders simply relaying the news in an unbiased way are long gone.

Will never shop at Sainsbury's again and hope others do the same.  They would deserve the loss of custom.

1312004552577646594 2020-10-02 20:20:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @carolsummers1st @SadiqKhan What a weird statement from Khan. Not sure what the Government can do to prevent BAME people from getting the virus?

1312001659845910528 2020-10-02 20:09:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @linmagic Unless we can have a free trade deal without strings attached then yes.
1312001218919759872 2020-10-02 20:07:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @jjcwow Agree, nothing, and hope after we have come this far he does not sell us down the river. If he does that will be the end of Conservatives.
1311738999078297602 2020-10-02 02:45:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @SimonLeggett5 Don't be bullied by these morons.  Immediately block.
1311738157109514243 2020-10-02 02:42:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @Saturn90 Absolutely not.  Nobody could have predicted the Covid pandemic. The Government has made a lot of mistakes but there is nothing to say Labour would have done any better.  You have to remember the core values of each Party.  Covid won't go on forever.
1311736851703771136 2020-10-02 02:36:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulMer53 They are not fleeing war zones but have the money to pay traffickers to get them from a safe country to the UK illegally seemingly with the expectation of comfortable accommodation and everything free.  Must be so disappointing.
1311734905018163201 2020-10-02 02:29:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @MikeBates04 Awakening?  More like brain dead.

1311684842686423041 2020-10-01 23:10:11 +0800 <Ella1898> @DaisyAdeleleo They have been doing it for years.
1311684290485334017 2020-10-01 23:07:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @darrengrimes_ For a couple that wanted privacy they seem to be in the news an awful lot spouting a lot of useless nonsense and serving no good purpose to anyone.

1311683057829793792 2020-10-01 23:03:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales Dogs are good listeners and always agree with you.🤣
1311682484443197441 2020-10-01 23:00:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @Jay_Beecher Well, maybe being unfairly attacked on BBCQT sparked his interest in politics.
1311680574797623296 2020-10-01 22:53:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @AJ_1066 Yes, as it appears to be the only way to be truly free of the EU.  We have come this far and it would be a travesty if Government now start making unreasonable concessions in favour of the EU.  I.e. fishing.
1311678711125676033 2020-10-01 22:45:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @toryboypierce @jeremycorbyn Both wrong, I guess, but neither exactly crime of the century.
1311678378215342080 2020-10-01 22:44:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @Article1066 Yep, kept quiet for a reason and people who knew were hoodwinked into believing it was just for trade.
1311678011025108993 2020-10-01 22:43:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @teresadg0 Better off.  They are seething because they probably believed deep down we would never actually leave.
1311677732300951558 2020-10-01 22:41:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @dlcsk30 Followed. please follow back.
1311677333405929487 2020-10-01 22:40:20 +0800 <Ella1898> @MayorofLondon @RoyalMail Another meaningless, reactive empty gesture and post boxes were always traditionally painted red for a reason -  presumably so they could be easily seen from a distance.

1311673725994102787 2020-10-01 22:26:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @1Fubar Are you sure this is a real policeman?
1311673001012850690 2020-10-01 22:23:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @heather_venter @MailOnline These two get more irritating by the day.  Why do they think they have such great influence on what people think?  They become more irrelevant by the day.
1311672486023626755 2020-10-01 22:21:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @Oxford100 @NicolaSturgeon Good idea as long as they actually stayed there.

1311269132051120129 2020-09-30 19:38:17 +0800 <Ella1898> @MikeP39369411 @paulafr68963440 That's reassuring to hear if true.
1311268792706781186 2020-09-30 19:36:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @simon4124 @HelenMP4 Same here. Impossible to have any reasonable debate to why waste your time?
1311267477154865153 2020-09-30 19:31:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @Dorns84 @ForeverBrexit Must be bad.
1311265982753710081 2020-09-30 19:25:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @DMMosullivan Sanctimonious and hypocritical.  If he is so concerned about children dying in Africa he could donate some of his fortune.  Actions speak louder than words and words are cheap.
1311264308593078272 2020-09-30 19:19:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @HelenMP4 @simon4124 Helen, why should you come off twitter?  If people are abusive block immediately.  Sure there are plenty of people on twitter that share your views.
1311263705498357761 2020-09-30 19:16:44 +0800 <Ella1898> @simon4124 Well, this seems to be the theme in most advertising now.  It's a gross over representation and does not reflect reality.
1311262654493794311 2020-09-30 19:12:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @ClassicalObser1 @linmagic 0
1311262546549239809 2020-09-30 19:12:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @linmagic @thespacepirate This is ridiculous and in my opinion just adds fuel to the fire of racial tension.  All folks being equal cannot see any reason why any one group of people should be honoured just for being BAME.
1311261857433485312 2020-09-30 19:09:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitHome Sounds like capitulation to me and not at all surprised.
1311261275356364800 2020-09-30 19:07:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @paulafr68963440 Only recently Boris was talking of increasing our green spaces.  Not much chance of that if every available piece of land is to be built on our once green and pleasant land.
1311260461611061248 2020-09-30 19:03:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @RichardBurgon Ridiculous to blame the PM for tens of thousands of deaths.  The Government is dealing with an unprecedented situation and very much doubt Labour could do any better. If you have all the right answers sure we would all love to hear it.
1310927626681413638 2020-09-29 21:01:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales Think you are probably right.  There are dark forces at work   and Remainers will use any trick in the book to damage the Government.

1310924477069504514 2020-09-29 20:48:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @PoliticsPollss What I can't understand is how the Government can afford this when not far down the line there is bound to be a recession.
1310923268048793600 2020-09-29 20:43:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @GaryLineker @realDonaldTrump Any news on your on your immigrant 'guest' yet Mr. Lineker?

1310572228489228288 2020-09-28 21:29:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @PRodgersN @Paula55855 @exRAF_Al @metpoliceuk Many retired policemen must be sad and angry when they see what  is happening with the Police Force today.   The Force has become politicised and people have lost trust and respect. Time for Cressida Dick to retire and make way for a fairer apolitical Commissioner.
1310569196745617409 2020-09-28 21:17:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @ghost_wales If not Nigel there is no one else to vote for.
1310567511184809985 2020-09-28 21:10:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @teresadg0 @AllisonDowden71 Funny how they dredge up all the dirt when it gets near an election.  As for the BBC's negative broadcasting, it's just about what you would expect.
1310566855845838848 2020-09-28 21:07:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @LouLouLa10 @HeatherPreston1 @MailOnline Reality show is just about her level but how sad that Harry has such little strength of character not to get dragged along with it all.  Think the British have little love or respect for him now.
1310564132794449920 2020-09-28 20:56:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @toryboypierce Couldn't possibly get more tacky.  They should be stripped of their titles.
1310283784286359554 2020-09-28 02:22:52 +0800 <Ella1898> @WendyPuerto @MarkPensarn Problem is it's insidious and by the time things get really serious it's too late to do anything about it.
1310281082001072128 2020-09-28 02:12:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @samanthasrants 👏 good.
1310280039804657670 2020-09-28 02:07:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @PrimalPolitical Charles Moore is obviously the right choice.
1310279128147427329 2020-09-28 02:04:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @afneil Would block him anyway, Andrew.  He's really boring.😞
1310278169044422657 2020-09-28 02:00:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @RosamundUrwin Obviously it's the right choice.  If the BBC haven't got the message by now that the public are sick of leftie bias news  and wokeness then they never will.  If the BBC don't make radical changes in a hurry they may well not survive.
1310184600505901056 2020-09-27 19:48:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @MarcCorbishley Now, that's a real pudding.  Yum.
1310183349001089025 2020-09-27 19:43:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @Murky__Meg @HeatherPreston1 It's sad and an embarrassment for the Royal Family that Harry is becoming a bit of a laughing stock being portrayed as an obedient henpecked husband.
1310181147259867136 2020-09-27 19:35:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @MaureenDalby Idle threats usually and why does any one person think they are so important that anyone should care less.
1310180780006682624 2020-09-27 19:33:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @MattHancock Surprised at the amount of money being splashed around when there is probably a recession around the corner.  Most people or their families can afford to buy a tablet if they think they would be used.
1310179790197063686 2020-09-27 19:29:38 +0800 <Ella1898> @jaycee1001 Just imagine the backlash and furore if that had been a BLM or ExR protestor. We now have political, selective policing.😡
1310177604541050885 2020-09-27 19:20:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @darkfarces The Guardian, say no more.

1310174619450699776 2020-09-27 19:09:05 +0800 <Ella1898> @MayorofLondon BLM and ExR protests were not acceptable either when the Police just meekly stood and watched.  Neither is the horrendous knife crime in London on your watch.  Selective policing is not acceptable.
1310173352221454337 2020-09-27 19:04:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @teresadg0 Wow, and on a Sunday as well.  Just about stirring at 8 am.

1309869678865657858 2020-09-26 22:57:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @AvonandsomerRob And why does Philip Schofield thing anyone is interested in his mental health problems?  He should do himself and his family and shut up.

1309867716921229321 2020-09-26 22:49:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @ninnyd101 Snowflakes, maybe? but not fair to compare them to past generations. Different upbringing, different world, and feel some sympathy starting Uni only have to shut themselves away in their room to study most of the time. Can't be good for their mental health.
1309863559657127938 2020-09-26 22:33:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @Aldeanuk @privvv_colee Wrong colour!
1309509808727490561 2020-09-25 23:07:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @NikkiStix55 Nothing to be proud of and that negative, biased behaviour is learnt from adults.  Not doing your daughter any favours here.
1309508460329996289 2020-09-25 23:02:01 +0800 <Ella1898> @PoliticsPollss Khan's total inadequacy as Mayor of London.  London has never been in such an appalling state as it is now.
1309507422210453509 2020-09-25 22:57:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @MSANNCOOPER It's a thought reluctant to entertain but something not right.   Wouldn't be surprised if it had all been agreed with the French as it all seems very organised this end with coaches laid on and accommodation provided.

1309500564926009345 2020-09-25 22:30:38 +0800 <Ella1898> @websterssay It's just taken for granted now that just about everyone has a smartphone and computer.  There are plenty of elderly people who have neither nor want them.
1309499741126963200 2020-09-25 22:27:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 There certainly seems to be one rule for us and one rule for them which just promotes racial unrest.

1309498392561713152 2020-09-25 22:22:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @WendyPuerto @toryboypierce Read that Tesco were starting rationing again.

1309194144242438146 2020-09-25 02:13:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @COLRICHARDKEMP Nothing could be more unpatriotic than refusing to support our armed forces who are sometimes called upon to risk their lives for their country.  Surprising anyone wants to join the armed forces anymore in this country for the thanks and support they get.
1309192299197403147 2020-09-25 02:05:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @lienomail But according to Keir Starmer Labour are patriotic.

1309074066020630531 2020-09-24 18:15:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @CatharineHoey Great response and one I think a lot of people would agree with.
1309073568786001921 2020-09-24 18:13:54 +0800 <Ella1898> @Steve1Sandwich You are not invisible.  Followed. You could try following more people and getting more followers.
1309072698006478848 2020-09-24 18:10:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @Keir_Starmer Complain, whinge, criticise.  Any useful suggestions?
1309072138419286016 2020-09-24 18:08:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @RichardBurgon Don't think any country has eliminated the virus and it is so easy to criticise when you do not bear the responsibility.  Why can't Labour do something useful and make some positive suggestions instead of constantly carping.  It's not helpful.
1308755320676720642 2020-09-23 21:09:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @JamesRobvincent Definitely.  Should never have been allowed in the first place.
1308754712037126146 2020-09-23 21:06:53 +0800 <Ella1898> @piersmorgan On this occasion you are absolutely right and Prince Harry should be well aware that it is inappropriate for someone in his position.  Makes you wonder how much more trouble and embarrassment for the Royal Family he and Meghan are going to create
1308471702293282818 2020-09-23 02:22:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @askeyJ_56 @Joyceeee77 @BorisJohnson Yeah, me too.
1308470634184400904 2020-09-23 02:18:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @naughttynoo Make sure you keep your doors locked.
1308470233192181761 2020-09-23 02:16:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @HHepplewhite @mssassysally Despicable, they couldn't care less about the human rights of our own soldiers. Pretending to be patriotic just to gain support.  The British people are not that stupid.
1308469109529751555 2020-09-23 02:12:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @markadayofdays @HeatherPreston1 Boris getting a lot of criticism but who would want his job right now? No matter what he does he will be criticised.  However maybe lock downs and restrictions should be debated and agreed in Parliament if not already. True, thought of Labour being in power is truly terrifying.
1308465894339862528 2020-09-23 01:59:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @LadBonnie @MouldsSylvia There will be more stories like this  in the near future.
1308463741542060032 2020-09-23 01:50:40 +0800 <Ella1898> @MaureenDalby @MouldsSylvia @pritipatel Think the majority of people are dismayed and angered by what is happening day after day. It's a national emergency and requires immediate action.
1308462709252460545 2020-09-23 01:46:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @VMaledew @Mimi190447 Problem is Victor, there is no party to replace them.  We need a new party that actually represents the British people.
1308370280612532225 2020-09-22 19:39:17 +0800 <Ella1898> @brexitblog_info Must be the most boring individual in Westminster.🤣

1308366678082940929 2020-09-22 19:24:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidBlakeman13 Think she has done enough damage already.  Boris should relieve her of her post forthwith.
1308107316223504387 2020-09-22 02:14:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @WayneMo18011749 No sympathy as the BBC have brought it upon themselves.  Defund the BBC.
1308106090236858374 2020-09-22 02:09:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @Sir_Loin67 It's what you would expect from Theresa the appeaser.
1308105790155370496 2020-09-22 02:08:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @Majeh19 @InvictaRegina Thought that was a Labour thing?
1308057063419981825 2020-09-21 22:54:41 +0800 <Ella1898> @bestofbritish2 The cure could well be far worse than the disease if we have another full lockdown. Economy trashed, people dying from other serious diseases for lack of medical care, increase in mental illness, suicides, domestic violence, increase in crime and social unrest. The list goes on.
1308055243041763328 2020-09-21 22:47:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @TheGrandDayOut @LeaveEUOfficial @Nigel_Farage @EmmanuelMacron Well, we hope so, but believe nothing until it happens.  All politicians appear to be innately devious and we still need Nigel to remind the Government of their promises.
1308049974329040901 2020-09-21 22:26:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @kangaroobees @petemorristwit Zoe Ball is the most irritating person to watch (for 2 minutes).  Their pay is way out of proportion to what they contribute and paid for by some of the poorest and most vulnerable people.  Even the new Director General of BBC has admitted it is 'not a good look'.
1308048076716769282 2020-09-21 22:18:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @jdlflower @Iromg It appears Khan thinks he can do anything  he likes in London.  High time Boris put him in his place.
1308044949334749187 2020-09-21 22:06:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @BoerboelUK @1keydonkey @pritipatel They are just having a laugh at our expense.  The Government should toughen up and refuse to accept them.
1308044361209442305 2020-09-21 22:04:12 +0800 <Ella1898> @jaycee1001 The truth is they don't really know, so shouldn't make such wild predictions.  Doesn't help the public have any confidence in what they say.
1307750068099969024 2020-09-21 02:34:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @MahyarTousi Compare that to their response to anti vax protest.  Unfair and selective policing being employed which will create a lot of anger.  Same rules should apply to everyone.
1307747753829830657 2020-09-21 02:25:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @TMBRKS @CarlWillDurham But not to oppose merely for the sake of opposing.
1307742918665547776 2020-09-21 02:06:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @TPointUK Do kids learn history at school nowadays or has it all been airbrushed to suit left wing agenda?
1307742313108602884 2020-09-21 02:03:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @ecmagenda @debatenothate2 @KentVera But where will you go?  Much of the western world is in turmoil.
1307741942155943937 2020-09-21 02:02:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @debatenothate2 @MouldsSylvia Think millions of people feel the same.  It's so bad some elderly people are saying they are glad they have lived most of their lives as don't recognise our one peaceful country any more.  How sad is that?😪
1307689033359937544 2020-09-20 22:32:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @Linsuealex @NormanBrennan @BorisJohnson It is a sad state of affairs to feel that way.  Western countries have been ruined by politicians making bad decisions with no reference to the people. True, it is the young generation who will suffer the most.
1307686453116383232 2020-09-20 22:22:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @looking4ans Yes, you never know quite what to expect but expect it to be bad news of some kind.
1307686127990722560 2020-09-20 22:20:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @CarlWillDurham All Starmer is good at is constant criticism and opposing anything and everything the Government comes up with just for the sake of opposing.  Labour make no useful contribution whatsoever.
1307681323788763136 2020-09-20 22:01:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @SadiqKhan Deluded. 🤣🤣🤣

1307678129444528131 2020-09-20 21:48:56 +0800 <Ella1898> @oflynnsocial It's wrong that the Police are not treating everyone equally.  All political.

1307675080990830596 2020-09-20 21:36:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @PatriotActive66 Love her, and agree wholehearted.
1307673781947727873 2020-09-20 21:31:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @petemorristwit £1.7m is an obscene amount of money for simply sitting on your backside enjoying talking about football, which millions of ordinary blokes would be happy to do at a fraction of the cost.

1307336069206208513 2020-09-19 23:09:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 Khan should not have the power to remove or replace our statues or change street names.  It is a blatant attempt to destroy British culture and heritage.  Unfit to be Mayor of London.  Sooner he is removed the better.

1307333068743729153 2020-09-19 22:57:47 +0800 <Ella1898> @sarahrutherfor2 Think it's a matter of containing the virus rather than stopping it.
1307332444723576832 2020-09-19 22:55:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @DailyMailUK That's if she can get past the dodgy lawyers who side with illegal immigration.
1306964458569375747 2020-09-18 22:33:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @Mal_DuBois But they can afford to pay traffickers several thousand pounds to get them to the UK.  These out  of touch Judges are a scourge.
1306963590826598400 2020-09-18 22:29:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @DebraBe16141698 Have a nice spot of lunch first with good wine (subsidised, of course, at tax payers expense) then have a kip.  Most of them probably haven't a clue what has been discussed.  Should not have the power to override the elected Government.

1306957124413673475 2020-09-18 22:03:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @MaherRonan Remember the days when policemen had to be well built and at least 6ft tall?

1306949922034515969 2020-09-18 21:35:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @TelBabe Think it is wrong that Khan has the power to remove or replace our statues.  The Government should intervene and preferably Khan should be removed not the statues.

1306574131232727041 2020-09-17 20:42:02 +0800 <Ella1898> @Arthurpeaky1 @BeddoeRoger @BBC And the way the BBC is going there will be more cancelling the licence fee.  Probably be targeting the over 75's more aggressively now to pay the fee.  Despicable!

1306570610840043520 2020-09-17 20:28:03 +0800 <Ella1898> @GaryLineker @AlexScott No objections to Alex Scott but replacing someone for the sake of 'diversity' when they are very popular and doing a great job is wrong.
1306569935896940545 2020-09-17 20:25:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 Know what you are saying Paula and agree entirely.

1306198764525363201 2020-09-16 19:50:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @MarianneSansum Good, and hope over 75's will rebel and refuse to pay.  Disgrace to demand licence fee from over 75's, some of whom will struggle to find the money, while paying vast salaries to some of their presenters. Defund the BBC.

1306192564735938563 2020-09-16 19:25:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @SteveLaws19 @SeaCucumber51 True. Economic migrants should not be allowed to come here unless they have accommodation and a skilled job lined up.

1305568961744994304 2020-09-15 02:07:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @AnnaBritannia @talkRADIO Perhaps he ought to go down to Dover and see for himself.

1305567777466593288 2020-09-15 02:03:09 +0800 <Ella1898> @derbyfile @myerschrismyer1 Nothing could have been more dishonourable and 'shabby' than those MP's who reneged on their promise to implement Brexit. They have short memories when it suits them.
1305566768002367496 2020-09-15 01:59:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @PippaP22 @PaulStonehous15 They are only 'broken' when it suits their agenda,
1305566310206787594 2020-09-15 01:57:19 +0800 <Ella1898> @brexitblog_info Me too.  We didn't vote to be half in and half out.
1305496832236285954 2020-09-14 21:21:14 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrettEverest @Oggyoioioi What happens when there are no longer any hotels left to accommodate immigrants?

1305493672457383936 2020-09-14 21:08:41 +0800 <Ella1898> @FingerWrites Would be worth celebrating if Shaun Bailey ousted the awful Khan man who wants to get rid of our statues.
1305492544722219008 2020-09-14 21:04:12 +0800 <Ella1898> @TPeryer It's a personal choice but I have always had one each year with no adverse effects.
1305492083751481344 2020-09-14 21:02:22 +0800 <Ella1898> @TelBabe You would have to be inebriated to watch those either of those two.
1305490423809544197 2020-09-14 20:55:46 +0800 <Ella1898> @InvictaRegina Probably left wing and BAME.
1305490032430645249 2020-09-14 20:54:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @jools_collop Yes.  Seen your tweet.
1305489916395171840 2020-09-14 20:53:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @HookyGolfer Appears to be something going on.  Why do they do that?
1305489622659719168 2020-09-14 20:52:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @jaycee1001 Don't think many surgeries open at weekends.  Ours certainly doesn't.  GP's only appear to work office hours now.  Not good.😞
1305488458421600257 2020-09-14 20:47:57 +0800 <Ella1898> @DaveAtherton20 @BBCNews Absolutely not.  Just feel strong sense of annoyance whenever either of them pop up to regale us with their opinions. Doubt they have many admirers and their criticism of Brexit just makes a lot of people support it more.
1305487166009675776 2020-09-14 20:42:49 +0800 <Ella1898> @pie_sees People in sport should stick to sport or become a politician.  The two really don't mix.

These men, especially Blair. did immeasurable  damage to the UK during their time in office and doubt many people care a jot what their opinions are.

1305112419853914113 2020-09-13 19:53:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulLeMay16 Really hope Shaun Bailey continues to increase in popularity and that he wins.  Khan needs to go.  Worse Mayor ever.

1305109716377522177 2020-09-13 19:42:58 +0800 <Ella1898> @KoolKat1025 @UKLeaveNow Think we know already.
1305109382385086464 2020-09-13 19:41:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @MorwynAgrona Keep quiet if I were you.  They will be looking for places for all the immigrants that have arrived recently too live.
1305108782993743873 2020-09-13 19:39:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @Keir_Starmer @SadiqKhan That remark is so laughable.🤣  Khan is the worse Mayor ever.  As for an inspiration you obviously don't set your sights very high.
1305107690717409282 2020-09-13 19:34:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @campbellclaret @BorisJohnson Is that the best you can do?  Your rather childish, cheap jibes reflect more on you than anyone else.
1304803524446949376 2020-09-12 23:26:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @brown12008 It is a difficult question with no ideal answer and you are right we have far more reliable detection methods now and some crimes are vile enough to wish someone dead but would  not vote for capital punishment.
1304800574882361347 2020-09-12 23:14:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @jackiedaitken @darrengrimes_ Sure you are right.  Just need the right people for the job, I guess.
1304799464268455936 2020-09-12 23:10:08 +0800 <Ella1898> @brown12008 Personally could never condone taking another person's life.  There is always the possibility that the accused could in fact be innocent (sure mistakes have been made  in the past) and whoever kills the accused in effect is a murderer.
1304793490883309570 2020-09-12 22:46:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 Maybe all this well timed trouble has been whipped up deliberately by left wing politically motivated groups to cause unrest amongst the BAME population with the aim of destabilizing the Government and seemingly encouraged by MSM.
1304410217954922496 2020-09-11 21:23:25 +0800 <Ella1898> @jackiedaitken @darrengrimes_ Good for you,  I don't oppose it but was just thinking how unpopular they would be with some more confrontational, aggressive types.  Rather like traffic wardens!
1304409426707783680 2020-09-11 21:20:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @MartinDaubney Water cannon's get my vote.  Imagine the majority of The public are sick if their pathetic antics.
1304407233040650240 2020-09-11 21:11:33 +0800 <Ella1898> @SaltyDuchess @chrisjackson193 From the beginning the EU were un-cooperative and treated, our then PM, with a degree of contempt and ridicule and were wrong to negotiate with anyone other than our elected Government.  Sooner we are completely free the better.

1304401055371931649 2020-09-11 20:47:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @Kevin_Maguire Far from patriotic, quite the reverse.  Majority of these people are illegal immigrants leaving France, a safe country, where they are free to claim asylum. British values are being thoroughly abused. But of course you do know this.
1304399657259462657 2020-09-11 20:41:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @GowTolson Yes, God help us indeed.  She did enough damage while she was PM.

1304115875579072516 2020-09-11 01:53:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @JakeHepple1 Why is it called a Catholic school if it is not teaching the Catholic religion and would an Islam school teach Catholicism? It's up to parents to object.

All the things you hold dear I'm sure are shared by majority of people and we must fight back.  Disappointed in this Government myself but any of the alternatives are unthinkable

GP's are failing in their duty to provide a service to the public yet still being paid over 100K a year.  Bet if you were willing to pay as a private patient you could get an appointment within a few days.
1302588222929874945 2020-09-06 20:43:27 +0800 <Ella1898> @VictoryDay_Hope It is a disgrace and insulting to British people paying their taxes to fund the Health Service.  Government are stoking up a lot of resentment amongst the public.
1302587233657118721 2020-09-06 20:39:32 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 If we are seeing the beginning of race wars we have spineless politicians, MSM and groups like BLM to thank.
1302586843842703361 2020-09-06 20:37:59 +0800 <Ella1898> @johnredwood It really is that simple.  Perhaps they are still clinging to the hope Britain will do U-turn and rejoin.
1302239933176766464 2020-09-05 21:39:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @kakiOwakagirl @brown12008 Whatever. The point is they were not allowed to be used.  Someone may have got wet.🙄

1302238705671966720 2020-09-05 21:34:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @afneil @HD2onPBdotcom @spectator Good for the Spectator.  Thinking of subscribing.
1302237524006440960 2020-09-05 21:29:54 +0800 <Ella1898> @solus_7 @PamL_54 @brown12008 That does not surprise me.  No doubt against someone's human rights.  Water cannons are used quite successfully in other western countries and with all the trouble brewing right now the Police appear inept at keeping order. Will the Government allow mob rule to take hold?
1302236719115370499 2020-09-05 21:26:42 +0800 <Ella1898> @brown12008 Think Boris bought one but Theresa May sold it off.  One of the many mistakes she made while in office.
1302230459045289984 2020-09-05 21:01:50 +0800 <Ella1898> @Mike_Fabricant @Keir_Starmer No surprise that someone like Dawn Butler supports  the disruption and chaos caused by the the crazy ExR mob.  Unfit to be an MP.

1301863393620447234 2020-09-04 20:43:15 +0800 <Ella1898> @ParveenAtwal3 Just wonder where all this money is coming from to pay for hotels yet alone airlines especially at a time when half the country is still being paid by Government to stay at home and business are going bust.🤔
1301862385800679430 2020-09-04 20:39:14 +0800 <Ella1898> @JimmyMackem @DavidLammy @GaryLineker Me and millions of others seeing the same thing, I think and who knows what the true figures are?
1301857885157289984 2020-09-04 20:21:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @IVAdam @DavidLammy @GaryLineker We all know there has always been immigration but not on the grand scale of the past 25years or so.  And best not believe everything you read.
1301857188848242688 2020-09-04 20:18:35 +0800 <Ella1898> @JimmyMackem @DavidLammy @GaryLineker Yes, we know there has always been some immigration but nothing like on the grand scale over the past 25 years or so.  Our country has changed beyond recognition over that time.
1301856613133942784 2020-09-04 20:16:18 +0800 <Ella1898> @Snappersnap @DavidLammy @GaryLineker No, it will be one of these many highly skilled doctors or engineers we hear arrive here on boats, no doubt!
1301855308424400897 2020-09-04 20:11:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @Sposcer @OliverCooper @jdminiatures Yes, it seems to me the Police 'choose' the easy targets.  The Police seem afraid to challenge groups like ExR or BLM but if things continue something will have to give.
1301853984781631489 2020-09-04 20:05:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @PaulStonehous15 @warningshout @uk_sf_writer Indeed, not.

1301851988209139716 2020-09-04 19:57:55 +0800 <Ella1898> @warningshout @uk_sf_writer @PaulStonehous15 The arrangement was all in favour of the EU and they still have the nerve to think although we have left the EU the situation should continue.😡
1301849677906751490 2020-09-04 19:48:45 +0800 <Ella1898> @Prisoner0071 Well said, Karen.  It's my guess you voice the opinions of the majority of Brits.  I favour water cannons to remove them.
1301849166319161344 2020-09-04 19:46:43 +0800 <Ella1898> @XRebellionUK @xrlegalsupport What you are doing is illegal. The majority of the public have zero sympathy for your 'cause'.  Disrupting the lives of other citizens should certainly be an offence and you will achieve nothing with your protests. Time the Law and Police took firmer action.
1301846998170193921 2020-09-04 19:38:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @Lakesman5 Lay another plate for Christmas dinner.
1301845766672191488 2020-09-04 19:33:12 +0800 <Ella1898> @AdvertMan999 Of course the UK could refuse to take any more migrants.  There is little the EU could do about it.
1301845480318664704 2020-09-04 19:32:04 +0800 <Ella1898> @scottboxley @jdminiatures @errjustsaying @robertsessford1 @Metro_Sport The sincere and brave amongst them will not drop to their knee.
1301845080144261121 2020-09-04 19:30:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @chapman020 @BornLondoner And gone from bad to worse.  Maybe things will go full circle but it would have to get a whole lot worse before that would happen.  The rot is well and truly set in.
1301591754005786626 2020-09-04 02:43:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @chapman020 No prizes for guessing.
1301584626880843776 2020-09-04 02:15:31 +0800 <Ella1898> @OliverCooper @jdminiatures The Police are at fault for not removing these people, who are a public nuisance, straight away.
1301582932843339776 2020-09-04 02:08:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @DavidLammy @GaryLineker No doubt vetted and handpicked 'refugee' and sorry to say Britain was a much better and safer place before mass immigration. Britain is losing it's true identity and culture and traditions are being slowly but surely eroded away.
1301482127398240257 2020-09-03 19:28:14 +0800 <Ella1898> @mjs121272 @rachaelvenables @LBC Water cannons would be such a good deterrent (with dye) but don't think we have any in UK now.  Used effectively in other western countries.  No doubt here it would be considered cruel or against someone's human rights. 😡
1301481219239161857 2020-09-03 19:24:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @rachaelvenables @LBC These idiots are creating an obstruction and should have been removed as soon as they arrived.  They will just keep pushing the boundaries as long as we have this useless softly, softly approach to policing.
1301480465875038208 2020-09-03 19:21:38 +0800 <Ella1898> @BrexitHome Think the reverse is true and It's Brussels who are being peevishly obstinate.  They got used the the appeaser May approach.
1301479116907184132 2020-09-03 19:16:16 +0800 <Ella1898> @DebraBe16141698 @jaycee1001 They hope to elicit sympathy.  As we all know, the majority are young black men probably all unskilled ready to claim benefits.
1301478384464269313 2020-09-03 19:13:21 +0800 <Ella1898> @hugh_pimple Love the new word - fakeugee🤣 If Lineker does take in a so called 'refugee' you can bet they will have been vetted and hand picked.
1301477912118521857 2020-09-03 19:11:29 +0800 <Ella1898> @jaycee1001 Publicity is what they are after, so yes, it would be best to ignore them and the Police should take a much firmer stand against their disruption of life for others.
1301476696449785856 2020-09-03 19:06:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @annemar96038452 @jojobeebee1 @GrahamMarlbrou1 Yeah, something like that.
1301474141091102723 2020-09-03 18:56:30 +0800 <Ella1898> @jojobeebee1 @GrahamMarlbrou1 Think it might take more than a vaccine - an operation perhaps?
1301472915054100481 2020-09-03 18:51:37 +0800 <Ella1898> @AS332L Now, that is funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1301472650167046144 2020-09-03 18:50:34 +0800 <Ella1898> @LTHlondon Why do they think what they have to say is going to be special or 'inspirational'?  Just a way of making a quick buck while remaining very much in the public eye.
1301470960185487362 2020-09-03 18:43:51 +0800 <Ella1898> @tesssummers98 Believe it was actually over 400 yesterday.  Just how many more can we take?  No doubt all will be claiming benefits.
1301470516839149570 2020-09-03 18:42:06 +0800 <Ella1898> @Paula55855 Good luck🙏

1301148970899701761 2020-09-02 21:24:23 +0800 <Ella1898> @p13tobler Not a dicky bird, but that's no surprise. A huge step forward for the UK but far too positive a news item for the UK for MSM to comment on.  Wonder of the BBC will report on it???
1301147339437076484 2020-09-02 21:17:54 +0800 <Ella1898> @williamRN7 @grumpyhalfling Had flu vaccination many times with no ill effect to date but new vaccination for Covid is a different matter.  Don't think it can have been tested enough yet to be safe.
1301146458503237632 2020-09-02 21:14:24 +0800 <Ella1898> @driverjohn @RobertJFBarnes1 It is a serious problem and doesn't bode well for the future with so much trouble bubbling away in the country. Sadly, the Police have been emasculated by weak leaders and the PC, woke brigade.
1301143392659922944 2020-09-02 21:02:13 +0800 <Ella1898> @mariacaulfield This is good news for a change.  👍
1301142749840904196 2020-09-02 20:59:40 +0800 <Ella1898> @DaisyAdeleleo And Believe he was wearing a tie.  Something must be afoot!
1301142369027403778 2020-09-02 20:58:09 +0800 <Ella1898> @DaisyAdeleleo @errjustsaying A Tory at the BBC!  That is a surprise.  Time will tell I guess.  Nothing the BBC can do will change my negative views about them.  Defund the BBC.
1301140509742772231 2020-09-02 20:50:46 +0800 <Ella1898> @kazbahellis @capitalistphere Think many GP's will see this pandemic as an opportunity to keep patients at arms length wherever possible.  Would imagine it has been a lot easier for them. Telephone appointments are ok for minor problems but more serious illnesses could well be missed.
1301139179150151681 2020-09-02 20:45:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @NatalieElphicke Discussing seems to be as far as it gets.  Action is required.
1301138585077379073 2020-09-02 20:43:07 +0800 <Ella1898> @driverjohn @RobertJFBarnes1 They are but sadly the Police no longer appear capable of retaining law and order.
1300853543717531650 2020-09-02 01:50:28 +0800 <Ella1898> @InayaFolarin @AllisonDowden71 Agree.  It is a nonsense. Just another manufactured phrase devised to cause more disharmony between black and white.
1300849098824744964 2020-09-02 01:32:48 +0800 <Ella1898> @politicalite @Sunpoches Hope it's true but believe it when it happens.

1300768281016643584 2020-09-01 20:11:39 +0800 <Ella1898> @karentaylorx A few may be afraid of getting the virus but my guess is many have gotten used to the luxury of 'working from home'. If people can go to the beach, attend raves, join demonstrations and generally get out and about they should return to work if they still have a job to return to.
1300765096642314241 2020-09-01 19:59:00 +0800 <Ella1898> @JuliaHB1 All this so called cultural appropriation is a load of nonsense. Who really cares what people do with their hair.  It's a personal choice.
1300764158712066048 2020-09-01 19:55:17 +0800 <Ella1898> @StandUp4Brexit @Sunpoches Been saying the same thing for months.  Time to walk way.
1300763736475660288 2020-09-01 19:53:36 +0800 <Ella1898> @JeremyVineOn5 Flogging a dead horse with the EU so it's best to walk away now.
