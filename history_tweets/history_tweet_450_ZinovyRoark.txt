Biden is a dolt and all Harris can do is laugh before answering any serious question. Both are children.
1339055870450294786 2020-12-16 11:52:52 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays If a large segment of the American public ignors it, then the country they will live in may never become the country we all hope for and have faith in; it will become buried in the dung heap of history. The cheating will be a millstone around the necks of these people.
1338912293346799627 2020-12-16 02:22:21 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays The adjucated ballots, not valid votes, were already in the system being held back by the 'algorithm'. The 'algorithm' detected 'oh, oh, Trump landslide', then was programmed to gate in enough to negate the outcome. Who triggered the gate? All this over an open internet no less.
1338907515858325504 2020-12-16 02:03:22 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays An internal traitor, a government bureaucrat, an agency? The timing allowed many adjucated ballots to proceed into the tally. All criminals leave a foot/finger print somewhere. Evil has many faces; it uses banalty to hide them. Those remote servers seized in Germany may be a key.

It is @29 &amp; will lose 1-2 house seats per 2020 census. Single party rule ruined the Empire State.

1338308230871724032 2020-12-14 10:22:01 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays Most effective way to bypass the media's info lockdown was to file the case with all its details.

1336885953110175745 2020-12-10 12:10:24 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> One would think these votes will be invalidated. How can any election certification be vaild without unqualifying these ballots.
1336853200301940737 2020-12-10 10:00:15 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays Those three judges are useless. The Republic is in danger and they choose partisanship and activism over common sense? The amount of evidence coming forth is staggering. The statistical improbablities alone are compelling.

1332009507283603457 2020-11-27 01:13:08 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays New York is not much better. Upstate is beautiful and the people r mostly sane. But New York City politically and fiscally ruins the entire state. The whole state is now a shadow of the Empire State. Single party rule has ruined a once thriving and industrious culture.
1332001846492205056 2020-11-27 00:42:42 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> If the Georgia ballots were legal, why would destroy, or hide, the exculpatory evidence? Corruption requires coverup. Honesty fears nothing.

1329497144558977026 2020-11-20 02:49:54 +0800 <ZinovyRoark> @Likeshesays There are many citizens who do not understand that we are a 'Republic' using democratic principles to self-govern. A Republic based in Law and not a mob of factions. We need more honest civic education at the elementary level, but good luck with that.

Many people fall prey to depression now and the media types know this. The American soul is in a dark night when a corrupt, dirty old man, and a champion narcissist becomes president.
