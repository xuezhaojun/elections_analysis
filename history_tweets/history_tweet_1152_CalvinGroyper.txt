1325192626505572355 2020-11-08 05:45:17 +0800 <CalvinGroyper> "No matter who is president, Jesus is King." This is true, but do not be deceived. He will put His enemies under His feet just as He did the Sodomites, Babylonians, Assyrians and Israelites. We have a choice: Repent and be spared like Nineveh, or be judged like Jerusalem.
1324254966731558912 2020-11-05 15:39:22 +0800 <CalvinGroyper> Some make a baseless argument that the scriptures were translated incorrectly, but that‚Äôs simply not true.

If they can‚Äôt achieve that, why should you believe they‚Äôd be good at other important things that a mate and mother should be good at? Not to say they have to be super models, just not obese.
1324074424736256000 2020-11-05 03:41:57 +0800 <CalvinGroyper> @LutherGroyper Same dude. Being single has its plus sides too. Extra cash, less responsibility, freedom, more opportunities to serve God doing mission trips or serving locally. Obviously having a wife and kids would be awesome, but what‚Äôs the point if she‚Äôs gross?
