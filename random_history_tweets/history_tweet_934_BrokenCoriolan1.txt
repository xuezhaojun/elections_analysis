1333060017780494337 2020-11-29 22:47:29 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Un believable, how much BS the #mediamob can shovel to cover a failed election system. Friken Brazil can hold an election with more security and validity than the world's only superpower.  We should be embarrassed, then we should fix it by putting proggies against a wall.
1333032415388790794 2020-11-29 20:57:49 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Eewww! 🤮🤮 Please, no! I'm sure that kamela's 'glass ceiling' was a mirror. But visual proof of how she "worked her way up" Cannot. Be. Unseen.
1333031036645621760 2020-11-29 20:52:20 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> This is a perfect illustration.  Libs are sloppy, lazy, and stupid by nature. That's how you get libs in the first place. That's why they need socialism. Stop these shitbags from stealing our nation. #stopthesteal
1333028414496731136 2020-11-29 20:41:55 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> They take your mile inch by inch. "just a little bit more, it will work this time." socialism, wokeism, progressivism. This creeping infection has to be stopped NOW. #HoldTheLine  We are at war NOW #FightBack
1332918925701509121 2020-11-29 13:26:50 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> A point, if we are not fighting the battle we are indeed, not at war. Are we going to fight? #lyingprogressives &amp; #degeneratewokes have declared war on America. It's time to return fire!
1332917949078720513 2020-11-29 13:22:58 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Fascist socialists must subvert an honest movement to gain traction among the ignorant. this is why wokes are degenerates. #degeneratewokes

On the back of middle class
1332878829988188161 2020-11-29 10:47:31 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Because poor people support and carry the revolt against tyranny. The stamp tax hurt the poor, was designed to limit communication. Lib's takeaway from the revolution; if you intend to stomp on the neck of libery, disarm the minutemen first.
1332876883524939776 2020-11-29 10:39:47 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> This is why libs fear truth.

1329427861694922752 2020-11-19 22:14:36 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Absolutely! Libs want free college for all because they know the average 18 year old is not informed enough to defend against proggie indoctrination they will experience in higher education.
1329425736894095360 2020-11-19 22:06:09 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Never Concede! Do not lay down for these two faced progressives. You wouldn't let them steal your purse or your car without a fight. Don't let them steal our nation.

1328476847869358080 2020-11-17 07:15:37 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @Peoples_Pundit Because both R's and D's lie constantly. The issue is that D's are insane, rape reason and logic with their woke BS, defy logic by refusing to disavow socialists, violate decency by supporting antifa Fascists, and strangle science by cherry picking facts.

1326391270676238336 2020-11-11 13:08:16 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> I never voted for a republican because I believed the republican. I vote for Republicans because I do believe the democrats.

You are a perfect example of the broken progressive mind. If you choose to block me please let me know. So I don't think twitter censored your BS by mistake.
1324901326929620992 2020-11-07 10:27:46 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> This is 1/2 step from making people wear a #scarletletter. You two-faced piece of shit. Put me on your list.  I hope you are screaming when yiu die.
1324895885570928641 2020-11-07 10:06:09 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> You'd better make sure your children are people I won't have to sh@@t. One of your little stoned, proggies nose miners steals from me, retroactive abortion will be a thing.
1324795029110493186 2020-11-07 03:25:23 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> This "reparations" BS is the stupidest most corrupt most malignant meme that woke proggies ever shit out. You CAN fix stupid, high velocity metal works every time.  Ilhan omar gets reparations over my dead body!
1324794081763946500 2020-11-07 03:21:37 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> If reparations are for slavery then only descendants of slaves get reparations? Should Somali refugees get reparations? Shoud descendants of immigrants post 1865 have to pay reparations? /3
1324793221143130112 2020-11-07 03:18:12 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Reparations for what, for whom, from whom??? Who are you gong to tax to pay reparations? Should illegal aliens be taxed for black people? Do all people of color get reparations for some reason? /2
1324791480611966978 2020-11-07 03:11:17 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Honest, smart, progressive, pick 2. It's impossible to be all 3

1324790845506088960 2020-11-07 03:08:45 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @peterdaou Trump = TV. Again. Some network will pimp for him because making lib cucks cry is worth $Billions.
1324766277680820224 2020-11-07 01:31:08 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Not 100%. Clinton foundation, Nancy pelosi's son in law and hunter biden are really good at collecting over seas $$
1324765239787753473 2020-11-07 01:27:00 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Not true. That is the second to last question. The last is; will True Americans accept RULE by an illegitimate government of socialists who have vowed to shit on the constitution? History says NO, 1776! W A R !
1324762696470835200 2020-11-07 01:16:54 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @peterdaou Huh. I feel exactly the opposite way for exactly the same reasons. Politically she wouldn't have been as bad as what we are about to face. But I just couldn't vote for a reprehensible, opportunist, eurotrash wannabe.
1324758717443661824 2020-11-07 01:01:05 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @actshually I understand this point exactly. No American owes loyalty to a biden presidency after all the shenanigans committed by dems at polling stations.
1324757980420599809 2020-11-07 00:58:10 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @actshually Heh. You're gorgeous even with the filter. (meaning no offense, objective assessment.)
1324755530066264064 2020-11-07 00:48:25 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> So hard to wait. Wishing there was something I could do to pull for Burgess Owen's. Stand Strong sir! 4th district is going to put you to work! We need yiu.
1324032795828654080 2020-11-05 00:56:32 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Why does the CDC wait till the day before the election to declare it safe for people WITH covid to vote in person? The mail in ballot BS was Never Necessary.   https://t.co/fKVdzO4s6v
1324031711257059329 2020-11-05 00:52:13 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> How is a 100,000 100% blue vote in mail ballots any thing but a ballot dump? 0% of repubs mailed ballots? How stupid do they think we are? How lazy and stupid are dems trying to sell that BS?
1324030304315609088 2020-11-05 00:46:38 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> I am incredibly proud of my black and latino neighbors for REJECTING the white proggi narrative of systemic racism. These people can stand strong and reason for themselves.

1324011245377265665 2020-11-04 23:30:54 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @MarkSleboda1 Heh. Americans would mop UN "troops" why would you send them. Here to die like mayflies? Whatevs, I'm game!
1324006776581185536 2020-11-04 23:13:09 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @peterdaou Maybe, countless, but not really any Americans. And that's why trump will win another 4 years and none of these "crimes against humanity" matter at all. Cry more lib.
1324002077933096966 2020-11-04 22:54:28 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Are you kidding me? It is socially illegal to fire or disagree with a female person of color! You advocate for suicide too?
1323902710437982208 2020-11-04 16:19:37 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> FUCX NO! That liberal pit of despair gets $0.00 from my taxes until they learn to vote for better people!

1323880344689364992 2020-11-04 14:50:45 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Q: if a citizen makes a mistake and can't file their ballot by the rules do they deserve to be disenfranchised? A: YES! If a person is too fxing stupid to read and follow simple rules they don't meet minimum qualifications for citizenship.
1323877244352163841 2020-11-04 14:38:26 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> What is happening in the Utah 4th race? Havnt been able to find an update in two hours. What's the holdup???
1323866916939685888 2020-11-04 13:57:23 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @peterdaou I fully agree neither should have beeb or should be allowed to run for any public office! See, we have left-right unity!

1323864850250915841 2020-11-04 13:49:11 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Philly poling places were a ghost town today. Biden 'were encouraged by what we see in Philly.' Translation; we got the vote stopped in Philly and were replacing ballots as fast as possible
1323861473085386757 2020-11-04 13:35:45 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> How long are Americans going to tolerate this BS?

1323845405478563841 2020-11-04 12:31:55 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Pensilvenia won't count existing absentee ballots tonight??? After all the BS at the Philly polling stations today this stinks like a rat! Get lawyers on sit now! #stopthesteal

1323833244744249344 2020-11-04 11:43:35 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> I can't wait to see live coverage of police opening fire on these antifa shitbags. America has a long history of shooting socialists. Let's maintain our traditional values!
1323829393869828096 2020-11-04 11:28:17 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @nypost I can't stand the thought that America is going to have to listen to this piece of shit run her ignorant mouth for another 2 years.
1323753071466307584 2020-11-04 06:25:01 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> What can be done to prevent this BS after trump wins?

1323696838537474048 2020-11-04 02:41:34 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Why are we against abortion? Shouldn't we want to abort as many potential progressives as possible? Abort now keeps me from facing charges when I'm forced to protect my family in 15 years.

If your stupid opinions about the 50% LDS population keep you from going to  Utah 100% of Utahns will be fine with that. Anywhere else and you'd have made a mask comment just as tired and ignorent.
1323454439013822465 2020-11-03 10:38:21 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> @boriquagato As far as I can see the Spanish riots don't include looting and distuction of proper.  Justified patriots of any nation are not interesting to limp dick liberals because they can't identify.

1322686936327155712 2020-11-01 07:48:34 +0800 <BrokenCoriolan1> Understand that the 2nd Amendment is the lynch pin of the bill of rights. All rights recognized by the constitution depend on a citizens ability to defend them. Any government that seeks to infringe is your enemy.
