1339568137843265536 2020-12-17 21:48:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenRonJohnson A blatant lie  Your July 6th visit to Moscow is only one aspect of your unctuous deference of Putin - You and half your party are IN LEAGUE with Russia  You are going down - We aren't going to forget OR relent
1339411045652152322 2020-12-17 11:24:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @shossy2 @AviFlyGirl 15, then zero ...
1339410840819134465 2020-12-17 11:23:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> He is a massive POS  The degradation of the @GOP continues
1339382437722222593 2020-12-17 09:30:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Media?  ... be better, for the sake of the nation and the world
1339382436711473152 2020-12-17 09:30:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> ... and I believe that they do, then their whole theory fails apart  Once you ask them for those details; HOW does this alleged election fraud actually happen, there is little information offered beyond shaking a handful of ballots from behind 1000 TV cameras, screaming 'FRAUD'!
1339382435654483969 2020-12-17 09:30:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> So, I don't understand why the media and talking heads refuse to delve deeper into their claims and go through the entire fraud process, in order to show the impossible nature of the claim?   If other states maintained the same security measures as that used in Oregon ...
1339382434706587648 2020-12-17 09:30:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And the system would try to check the checkbox, but would find a check already applied  The ballot would NOT be accepted, and the discrepancy investigated  A flood of imitation ballots would be tossed - only the FIRST one counts  It's generally IMPOSSIBLE to stuff that ballot box
1339382433636995076 2020-12-17 09:30:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That code is a QR scan code with a unique number that is invisibly tied to the name and address  The system counts each ballot,  and ticks the checkbox for 'voted' for that name, address and QR code  IF someone copied THAT ballot and tried to send it in, it would be scanned in -
1339382431657328640 2020-12-17 09:30:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP claims that the election was rigged, purportedly through the use of duplicate mail in or absentee ballots  Yet, they have NOT been pressed as to HOW that fraud occurs by using those ballots  My state uses 100% mail in ballots, and each ballot has a name, address and code
1339371974309507073 2020-12-17 08:48:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Amy_Siskind Turned crazy?   We ain't been off the Crazy Train in 4 years

1339367218862202883 2020-12-17 08:30:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @lawcrimenews Who are the victims of money laundering?   The government is the victim  Justice is the victim  The parties, however, are happy as punch (til they are arrested)
1339353519594192896 2020-12-17 07:35:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> WTF?
1339343016457170944 2020-12-17 06:53:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The 'communism and socialism' meme is shared by most all Republicans and many 'conservative' Democrats   Ask them to define the terms, and they will likely change the subject  They have too much invested in the false narratives, which they use to gain favor in their own circles
1339314851437445120 2020-12-17 05:01:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And he should

1339253963116310528 2020-12-17 01:00:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Sounds like he needs another Moscow junket to find 'evidence of irregularities'  Yes,  @SenRonJohnson   You will find the evidence you seek; at the bottom of the icy Volga River, just down the road from Pootie's pad  All you have to do is dive for it  Pretend it's more rubles

1339059197128835073 2020-12-16 12:06:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Isellmpls Let's make this abundantly clear - It's not Joe Biden's responsibility to prosecute Donald Ahole Trump  These kinds of subtle misrepresentations slide under the radar, and become myth  Joe will be plenty busy with fixing the other broken shit

1338843914736861184 2020-12-15 21:50:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CherylMorrisW @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden People have to recognize:  Presidents don't prosecute anybody  They aren't involved in the direct prosecution of any citizen - That's the DoJs job,  and a firewall should exist, and has traditionally existed in American society  I'm sure Biden/Harris will allow justice to happen
1338754649378025472 2020-12-15 15:55:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @rolandsmartin Then Barr MUST reveal what he knows, or he's just as culpable as Trump  I honestly believe @thejointstaff @FBI and @CIA are closely monitoring events and groups  Gen Milley and these other professionals aren't going to let these heathens steal it  Suckers and Losers won't abide

1338688963318407168 2020-12-15 11:34:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Is this part of a Trumpist plan to disrupt the government for nefarious ends?   Let Putin and his mischief in the door?
1338687213148622849 2020-12-15 11:27:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Good point
1338680218618228738 2020-12-15 11:00:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Dr_Anonymous33 Yeah ... I can see that ... Tolkien creates a rich world with lots of tiny parts .... interest either builds, or not  I have a few half read books ... Haha ...
1338661136875458562 2020-12-15 09:44:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Dr_Anonymous33 I approached Narnia after LOTR  The ever present moral narrative certainly had a theological bent, more so than Tolkien, but it was nice escape (I am atheist)  I really enjoyed the book with Shift, which might be the last book - It's been awhile since I've perused that series
1338658780721004544 2020-12-15 09:34:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kayleighmcenany Russia was real .... The evidence still exists  Prosecutors will continue to prosecute cases based on evidence, and nobody will be around to 'fix it'  You made a poor decision to accept this job - It's nobody else's fault but your own
1338657312240664578 2020-12-15 09:29:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenRonJohnson @JoeBiden #RusskiRon  Kinda cold in Moscow right now - I advise you wait until July 4th to go kiss Putin's ass in GUM's window  We are gonna pound you guys until you realize your new, lowly status as unamericans  EVERY oligarch ruble will be discovered, RusskiRon ... bet on it
1338655793357320192 2020-12-15 09:23:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I'm sure I am not the only one who believes Trump set it up to happen, just like Pootie Poot required  Removing the cop on the beat and NOT replacing them is rather damning, don't you think?  He isn't done selling out the United States of America, and you can be sure of that
1338653624189140992 2020-12-15 09:14:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Republicans are assholes, period  Is there a SINGLE intent or act they proclaim that isn't somehow corrupt or amoral?

1338463528542326785 2020-12-14 20:39:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Both @KLoeffler and @Perduesenate , and @senatemajldr and the rest of the @GOP senate have REFUSED to protect America's infrastructure when they refused to debate that legislation  They deserve to get fired for that
1338365301180694529 2020-12-14 14:08:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @PamKeithFL Didn't the entire @GOP stand down against the Russian threat?  Didn't they remove the policemen on the beat and let Russia run riot through our infrastructure?  @senatemajldr McConnell knew what was at stake when he refused to consider the legislation waiting on his desk

1337948545756745729 2020-12-13 10:32:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Look what Putin and some pasty Incel gamer who calls himself 'Q' did to the @GOP  With NeverTrumpers jumping the gunwales on the left and Trumpers leaping over the right, the good ship GOP is now a ghost ship, floating adrift in a sea of nonsense  Good riddance to bad rubbish
1337946070827974657 2020-12-13 10:22:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @fiercefreckled I presume she will be preoccupied with pounding rocks into sand, and I'm pretty firm on that point  I don't see any of the Trump crime troupe members moving into future political office  They live a mobster life, doing mobster stuff like criming and doing time in the pokey...

1337861117675094017 2020-12-13 04:45:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It depends on the nature of the amicus brief  An attempt to usurp the voting rights of an entire state and discard the intent of american voters in another state qualifies as a significant act worthy of close and zealous scrutiny

1337854777795866624 2020-12-13 04:20:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AndrewCMcCarthy @FoxNews Yes  Imagine what could happen when Democrats introduce REAL evidence of REAL election fraud in other states  Could we use legal discovery to recount McConnell's and Graham's actual votes?   Imagine that for a moment
1337838577472815105 2020-12-13 03:15:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> They received those foreign monies knowingly, which is a fcuking crime  You don't get to donate the crime away
1337826785182900224 2020-12-13 02:28:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realDonaldTrump BTW, The Proud Boys are an extremely small population, only a few thousand  The U.S. Military is full of 'suckers and losers' who number in the hundreds of thousands, and they won't stand for this
1337824396497494016 2020-12-13 02:19:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is going to be McConnell's ultimate weakness  The stain of Trump cannot be removed without removing McConnell  He will lock in the status quo and try to wait it out, and that is unacceptable to a great nation cleansing itself of a political cancer  Dump the insurrectionists
1337822241623445506 2020-12-13 02:10:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It is interesting to note how flexible and constitutionally agile the @GOP can be when it comes to degrading a Democratic governor's state power
1337819973905862656 2020-12-13 02:01:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's important to remember   In EVERY society exists a large group of regular families who want only peace and safety for their own communities, and NEVER engage in war for profit  Every society also harbors a population segment that despises humanity and tries to snuff it out
1337795444387106816 2020-12-13 00:24:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kayleighmcenany You get to wear THAT badge for the rest of your life  Sometimes we make bad choices - You've made a billion of them
1337631237809135617 2020-12-12 13:31:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> In a way, I am really OK with all those GOP AGs and congresspersons signing off on the Paxton case  AND, it seems they pissed off @SteveSchmidtSES and the rest of @ProjectLincoln   Big mistake  It's a target rich environment
1337628960306331649 2020-12-12 13:22:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Again, watch out what you ask for  Those 'suckers and losers' in the Military are itching to usurp that radiant orange blob straight outta the White House  I don't think we can rule out the military quite yet, not until the orange arse is fully vacated  They don't like him

1337621020077817857 2020-12-12 12:51:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr You asshole  It's a democratic hoax, don't you recall?  15, then zero, remember?  Drink the freekin bleach, right?

1337426069083750408 2020-12-11 23:56:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KlasfeldReports I ask ANYBODY to explain the precise mechanism by which this fraud is perpetrated  HOW are votes 'manufactured' ?  Photocopying somebody else's mail in ballot?  THAT won't work - Election systems flag out multiple votes and DON"T allow more than one voted ballot  Explain, anyone
1337416395416502272 2020-12-11 23:18:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> So, the @SenateGOP is going to sit on their hands and REFUSE to conduct the people's business?  They were HIRED to do a JOB; You don't want to do your job, then get the fuck OUT  Georgia can stop this facade - The GOP operate out of self interest, not the public interest

1337129788280983553 2020-12-11 04:19:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AuthorKimberley @TheEliasRework This helps explain why cases are skyrocketing as they are: The actual rate of contagion is higher than expected, which implies that there is more risk in sharing closed spaces with small numbers of people than is known  I am concerned about my workplace; They use the 6 foot rule

Please explain WHERE the fraud is occuring
1337038649142099971 2020-12-10 22:17:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MaxBoot @PostOpinions They have yet to provide ANY explanation as to HOW mail in ballots are prone to fraud  IF you copy someone's ballot, and vote that ballot, the state will tick off the 'voted' checkbox for that person at that address with that ballot serial number

1331232663454109697 2020-11-24 21:46:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Kushner  GONE!  Ivanka  GONE!  Eric  GONE!  Whipperschnapper   GONE!  Pompeo  GONE!  Miller  GONE!  Grenell  GONE!  Wolf   GONE!  Now, let's clean up the rest by replacing those dishonest Trumpists in Georgia;  Perdue and Loeffler  McConnell won't clean up the Trump mess; WE will
1331112195367682048 2020-11-24 13:47:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Um ... I didn't know this ...  Hmmmm
1331090090471243776 2020-11-24 12:19:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Democrats needs to create a message strategy that combines a path forward on many fronts,  including the pandemic response and patching up our foriegn affairs disaster  NOTHING can be fixed with McConnell in power; Not a damned thing  We cannot fix what's broken with a GOP senate
1331088293841178626 2020-11-24 12:12:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @cali_rn @DearAuntCrabby So sorry
1331086984245252096 2020-11-24 12:07:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JohnBrennan You rock  Thanks
1331077795091341315 2020-11-24 11:30:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @GeorgePapa19 The messaging is as scattered as a psychotic buffoon's thought patterns
1331076132028911617 2020-11-24 11:24:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Supporting Trump is the death of your integrity  Every Trump supporting congressperson is tainted and sullied ... their willingness to sell out OUR democracy to an ignorant, crime stained demagogue should be ruinous   #ETTD, mofo
1331071440242675715 2020-11-24 11:05:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I guess he's pretty angry - He's breaking all the good china....  Hey Donnie Two Scoops?   How much is Vladdie paying you to sell out your country?
1331063031342612484 2020-11-24 10:32:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @OlgaGartola I think he loses the privilege  My guess ... a convicted felon shouldn't get that privilege
1331050935150288896 2020-11-24 09:44:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha ... hilarious
1330988957891379202 2020-11-24 05:37:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Michigan certified
1330928588506365956 2020-11-24 01:37:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Wait ... he's a good boy  Let's trade the dog for Stephen Miller ...
1330923934301052928 2020-11-24 01:19:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> True that,  @GOP

1330692675163418624 2020-11-23 10:00:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @oneunderscore__ @buddhist68 Hey,  remember Bokononism?  "All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies" - Bokonon
1330687785989115904 2020-11-23 09:41:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @bennyjohnson Um ...  Wha ?  Nevermind
1330660201100316674 2020-11-23 07:51:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Yea verily
1330659694164148224 2020-11-23 07:49:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> These are people that work their asses off to keep US safe; literally dying to keep US safe  They deserve our sincerest respect and concern, not the back of our hand  The insinuations implied by Trump and his toadies; that doctors somehow make buck on covid patients, is an insult
1330657423841849345 2020-11-23 07:40:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Fascinating
1330655258620542976 2020-11-23 07:31:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KeithDB80 @StephenGlahn I hate when my statement is like 8 characters too long - gotta chop something ..  Haha
1330639829978161153 2020-11-23 06:30:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> You know?   Every previous election (except Bush-Gore) was easy   Count the ballots  Count the electoral votes  If you get 270 or more, you win the presidency  Not once did the entire party push a cockamamie tale of 'millions of votes' without evidence
1330633959848361984 2020-11-23 06:07:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RandyBishopUSA @CNNPolitics Hmmm ... I'll play  What did Trump do that makes him the greatest leader in history?   Which actions count for his greatness?
1330605001903751168 2020-11-23 04:12:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KeithDB80 @StephenGlahn That ain't all of it   Also in conspiracy with Hugo Chavez, who's been dead for 7 years   Ok, carry on ...
1330599004825034752 2020-11-23 03:48:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @john_sipher Intrigues straight out of the annals of Maxwell Smart
1330598122901229568 2020-11-23 03:44:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @h0agh @davenewworld_2 I got a problem with this  Not knowing anything about what preceded this, I would call this assault by the homeowner  Dude was walking away ... The adolescent insults reveal much about the personalities of these goombas ....
1330595735117578240 2020-11-23 03:35:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom The Russian Grand Plan to disrupt democracies through pliant, fascist satraps  Trump AND the @GOP are Putin's pliant toadies here in the United States  That evidence still exists ... Hmmmm whatever should they do with that ?  Mewonders
1330594518186409986 2020-11-23 03:30:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> What an awful day that was  An early part of what molded my political sentiments along the way - I was glued to the TV for a week, eventually watching Oswald get shot live ... THAT was a big jolt of WTF  RIP JFK, MLK and RFK
1330592130188730368 2020-11-23 03:20:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Detrumpification is a thing  In short; remove EVERY Trump appointee from EVERY agency, EVERY office, EVERY department  Wave byebye  Reverse every absurd EO  End the ridiculous 'Tariff War'  Reestablish NATO and realign with our traditional allies  #TrumpCrimesCommission   A start
1330565827649630209 2020-11-23 01:36:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Well said, sir
1330540681102831618 2020-11-22 23:56:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @tedcruz WTF?  Fucking republicans; induced mass psychosis  BTW, my son and I will be enjoying Thanksgiving with ALL the trimmings; We INSIST that my two daughters NOT come to this house, and they insist on NOT coming, because they care about the health of EVERYONE  You're a foolish man
1330538570101256193 2020-11-22 23:48:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @eliehonig He's already estranged the top law firms in the nation; both his insane claims AND his notorious 'inability to pay' have pushed most sane lawyers AWAY  I understand Bill Barr might be looking for work
1330537715620663296 2020-11-22 23:44:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CNNPolitics Um ... He's attempting to destroy democracy for EVERYONE, not just Democrats .... This effort affects ALL voting citizens, REP, DEM or IND  He's lashing out at EVERYONE ... the entire country, to punish the nation for having the audacity to vote against him  He'll burn it down
1330342369019842561 2020-11-22 10:48:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JoeNBC @senatemajldr ?  He asked you a question

1330339370113540096 2020-11-22 10:36:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Just the fascist fantasies of a extremely troubled and misguided person  I hope the Leavenworth Infirmary offers psychiatric care

1330335935486070785 2020-11-22 10:22:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ACoupleOkooks Quite a bit of mumbo jumbo and inarticulate speech patterns going down, there  Translator?   On second thought, nevermind
1330335174211620866 2020-11-22 10:19:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson If anybody wonders WHY Trump removed the upper echelon DoD members last week  Wagging the Dog is one of the many tools in the aspiring dictator's toolbox  I guess the professional leadership thought it a bad idea,  so now they are gone and Trump's toadies are in formation  Oh boy
1330332910075842560 2020-11-22 10:10:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> "No Evidence" is their brand now
1330329003958255616 2020-11-22 09:55:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @nahaltoosi No ... our nation, our WORLD, doesn't need this chaos  You're crazy if you believe this

1330305857125494785 2020-11-22 08:23:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @4everNeverTrump Jewish conservatives in Brooklyn tend to be insular and focused on their neighborhoods  It's a shame they don't see the danger they bring to their community; the link of outbreaks to 'community church activities' is an unfortunate fact that has led to widespread contagion events
1330304442248417281 2020-11-22 08:17:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @sharkyrae @BenediktAmrhein Extremely demanding of proof  Not demanding of believers, except that they stop trying to control OUR free lives with their theological precepts  Leave THEIR rules in THEIR church   This is the essence of the First Amendment Separation of Church and State
1330302813772124160 2020-11-22 08:11:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @tonyschwartz Bottom up - New Deal economics has proven successful over the decades - liberal/moderate Republicans were part of that history, too  The socialist cudgel needn't be brandished when we speak of moderately Keynesian policies,  like those of the New Deal platform  Demand side works
1330300246291853320 2020-11-22 08:01:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @tonyschwartz It's gonna be kinda weird when they go after the 'socialists', 'cause tossing that hackneyed firebomb around the room is always a unifying theme  Tell you what, #NeverTrumpers   Accept the New Deal as the correct deal; strengthen SSI, extend Medicare public option  Poof, unity!

Stop taking about 'Covid covid covid,  covid covid covid'  It's after the election,  remember you said they would stop talking about it?   Today they said "Trump killed 2000 people today,  again"  They didn't stop,  did they ...

You won't suffer any consequences, I swear  You're smarter than those silly globalists and scientists who make you feel badly  BTW,  Darwin was sly dog, wasn't he?
1330265347837014016 2020-11-22 05:42:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Hell,  my vote is BETTER than their fcuking vote  Why?, because they can go fcuk themselves ... that's why
1330264744163487744 2020-11-22 05:40:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @shearm @realDonaldTrump How does a president 'lock in policies'?  If one president can do something,  then another president can undo it, right?  What stops him?

1329999053912850433 2020-11-21 12:04:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Exactly - I made a similar argument a few days ago  Defer impeachment to the voters   Then defer the vote to Trump ...  Fcuk that!

1329863275496960001 2020-11-21 03:04:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ASlavitt Looks like North Dakovid is winning!   (the @GOP interpretation)
1329861003924832256 2020-11-21 02:55:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I just to use the 'latrine' imagery  Did you sit on the toilet and TRUMP today?   I must have eaten something unwholesome, because I've been stuck in the bathroom trumping all morning!   Sorry about the scatological focus, but Trump IS a POS, so it's apt

1329854864143257600 2020-11-21 02:31:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's important to note  EVERYTHING that Trump and the @GOP have broken or revealed through their perfidy MUST be fixed  It WON'T be fixed if the Senate isn't wrested away from McConnell  The 2 Georgia senate races are key to fixing our broken nation; only Georgia voters can do it

1328430128699883520 2020-11-17 04:09:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Eiggam5955 I got the shot in the arm  It left a permanent circle for some people
1328422896415371264 2020-11-17 03:41:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> He's abandoned the Kurds, the South Koreans, the Iraqis and the Afghanis - ALL which benefit Putin directly, and ceded the battlefield to both Chairman Kim and Erdogan ...  NOT in US interest in any way,  but definitely in Putin's interest
1328421931461185536 2020-11-17 03:37:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This obsequious deference to a lifelong adversary needs to be further investigated  The @GOP  was on the receiving end of Russian payoffs thru the Lev Parnas/Rudy Giuliani/Firtash/Putin FRAUD GUARANTEE pipeline  @senatemajldr himself was also involved in promoting their interests
1328421930081288192 2020-11-17 03:37:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> My spidey senses tell me:   Trump's reason to suddenly shift our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan is simple: Final payback to Putin, who's goal has always been the weakening of America's standing in the world  Thanks to help from the @GOP , he's delivered in SPADES!  421M$ payment?
1328418242096861184 2020-11-17 03:22:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JimStaples1 The 25th Amendment is executed by the president's cabinet, not congress, and this cabinet are useless sycophants  Congress COULD impeach Trump ............  Yeah ... right
1328416992546603008 2020-11-17 03:17:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The faster we mass-block Ivanka ... the faster life gets back to normal  It's not the only thing fcuking up society today, but it's one thing
1328416371617669120 2020-11-17 03:15:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And what if those state secrets involve evidence against one specific wannabe dictator ?  Nah ... I'll pass
1328415530189955074 2020-11-17 03:11:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mhdksafa Yes, but I'll stop for some people if they don't eventually acknowledge the courtesy  I think doorman is my natural station
1328375145061249028 2020-11-17 00:31:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @undercovernerd5 @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris THIS  Part of the Detrumpification process  Cancel ALL mineral leases offered to @GOP  and Trump Family mobsters and restore affected public lands  Let's restore the full breadth of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts  The Voting Rights Act needs to be fixed as well
1328373825529016333 2020-11-17 00:26:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Jim_Jordan You got it all wrong  We want GOOD people - intelligent people - to take proper precautions for themselves, their families and their communities  You? .... We want you to BREATHE DEEPLY  At your maskless rallies, church and school gym  B R E A T H E    D E E P L Y,  ahole !
1328368006624202752 2020-11-17 00:03:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @H2OEcologist Many of our local restaurants rightly opened street seating, and we have taken advantage of those seating arrangements .... Outside at 10' apart was OK before the last uptick, according to me  I am now getting take out only .... We need to hunker down better
1328366024740253696 2020-11-16 23:55:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Umpteenth benefit of a Trump election loss  Bye bye Betsy DeVos  The CNP lost !
1328111252749447169 2020-11-16 07:02:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ResisterForever Preet ... Glenn ... Yates ... so many actual patriots who are also highly qualified, unsullied by corruption, and .... sane...  For a change
1328045127126773760 2020-11-16 02:40:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Two months of this yet to go  I should be thankful
1328044871798583296 2020-11-16 02:39:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BeschlossDC Thank you, Mr. Beschloss, for helping to keep us sane and centered.  The truth SHALL set us free.
1328042355652395008 2020-11-16 02:29:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @shillman1 Well, they'll need masks - The Sooner, the better
1328031982882680834 2020-11-16 01:47:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ktumulty @realDonaldTrump Way late to the game
1328031267615477760 2020-11-16 01:45:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @1980Dorothy  https://t.co/I5S5Xa4NvZ
1328019409202421760 2020-11-16 00:57:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mhdksafa No more socialist then we've been for over 80 years  We call it Progressivism,  and it's been THE prominent political feature of American society ever since  It's only operated within a regulated capitalist marketplace,  so the usage of the term 'socialism' is a misnomer, at best
1328007151789305856 2020-11-16 00:09:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @holdavision I've been asking if Eric Prince is standing by the Rubicon, ready to cross  No kidding ... this is a more dangerous moment than most people understand - it's akin to an interregnum, where court intrigues become bolder and a new 'strongman' tries to usurp the reins of government
1328003562190766080 2020-11-15 23:54:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> There are so many 'greatest hits' moments to draw from ... Maybe someone will sort them by subject area,  like 'Dictator Worship', and 'Needless Death'
1327967067530698754 2020-11-15 21:29:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JennaEllisEsq Oh STFU  Time to ride off into the sunset, whatever your name is
1327701987446509569 2020-11-15 03:56:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Be still my heart
1327701679333138434 2020-11-15 03:55:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Fair
1327699891519254528 2020-11-15 03:48:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @titodinzey @FoxNews @OANN Trump will be in prison  Case closed
1327699612828725248 2020-11-15 03:47:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @roper_93 I read the Park Service number was 11,666 ... It might have changed since then,  but far less than 100,000 ... don't let false media provide the numbers  I want proof of life for each one
1327698398015676419 2020-11-15 03:42:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mtgreenee Breath deeply at all times  Thanks
1327697862126231552 2020-11-15 03:40:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The maskless buffoons can go to hell
1327695618572095488 2020-11-15 03:31:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> We're gonna wash that Trump right outta our hair ♫
1327693814539067392 2020-11-15 03:24:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/tSjCCBmfmN
1327682010941325312 2020-11-15 02:37:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @glennkirschner2 The high road means true justice when it's deserved   Trump's actions were an affront to the core of our democracy,  and every illegal act should be fully exposed ... there's no free fcukin lunch
1327651195456868352 2020-11-15 00:34:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP are a threat to this Democratic Republic  The vote is sacred - Republican opinions are not
1327645153545179137 2020-11-15 00:10:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CathyJoeGPT @AWeissmann_ Like EVERY court case that Barr got involved in; What actually happened in each case?  Justice is coming
1327643344931942400 2020-11-15 00:03:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AWeissmann_ @CathyJoeGPT I keep thinking about the transcripts of the Trump-Putin summits  US citizens have a right to know what was said in their name
1327370632086970368 2020-11-14 05:59:54 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I've been singing Milley's praises for months now  Why?   As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he is the final backstop for saving our democracy against a military takeover  He is an honorable general who respects democracy  Thank you @thejointstaff !  Much respect!
1327368940532559872 2020-11-14 05:53:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> He'll sneak out before Inauguration Day and fly to his dacha on the Volga ...
1327366712564408320 2020-11-14 05:44:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Good work
1327329842807730176 2020-11-14 03:17:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @alfranken So,  he's more or less like his voters?
1327286367085232128 2020-11-14 00:25:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @XanderXjork I don't hate anybody  I intensely dislike their policies ...  Hate is what someone feels inside themselves, and it's poison for the self and humanity  Stop hating and start changing  Easy to say,  right?
1327285628195594241 2020-11-14 00:22:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Replacing Perez is smart  Jaime might have a better chance of unifying the democratic coalition
1327285145284472834 2020-11-14 00:20:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Our world under @GOP control is a dystopian hellscape   Republicans are detrimental to society and the citizens within  The sooner they are out of power, the better our world will be ...
1327116501308952576 2020-11-13 13:10:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Vengeance, belated
1327106504516722691 2020-11-13 12:30:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> There we go ... the dam has broken ...
1327106135266975745 2020-11-13 12:28:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I just noticed the Trump Trump editing error ... I'm lame ... Haha  I won't ask for an edit button... nope ... it's useless to ask  @jack ?
1327105191175327744 2020-11-13 12:25:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @cheryllynmartin I don't have a one  How boring I am ...
1327104916993708034 2020-11-13 12:24:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ddale8 Bout time  Thanks
1327100838607605760 2020-11-13 12:07:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KazePlays_JC Would you pay a million dollars for a Trump University Degree?   Oh hell yeah!  ... sign me UP!   Cosign on a Trump loan?   Breathe deeply in the Oval Office for 24 hours?   Help Trump create fake photos of Biden taking a Trillion dollars from a Chinese Trillionaire?  Sure ....
1327085471587991552 2020-11-13 11:06:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Kinda weird watching the last Jeopardy episodes...  Poor Alex is the Dead Man Walking ... Truly sad to know this is it for him ... I'll miss Alex
1327051780920807425 2020-11-13 08:52:54 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I'm a Milley fan  If anyone is going to stop the maniac,  it will be the @thejointstaff
1327013687396233216 2020-11-13 06:21:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @johnthomas_4 @mcuban @BookofJonah I live in Portland Oregon  We are stacked to the rafters with homeless people  I can assure you, however, that most of the homeless aren't actually born in Portland or Oregon - many are from Red States  Is Middle America ready to take their homeless back to their own states?
1326993967930462208 2020-11-13 05:03:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mcuban @BookofJonah You are speaking to the little people who are impacted to a greater degree from inconsiderate conservative policies, including food insecurity  We need more than just food,  Mark ... I respect you,  but this seems like such simple math,  right?   It isn't
1326968900408340480 2020-11-13 03:23:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @eliehonig @donwinslow True that  One might say that Gerald Ford's most historic moment was his pardon of Nixon  Or getting shot by Squeaky Fromme
1326967759956131840 2020-11-13 03:19:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KeithOlbermann I love Jeopardy and have for many years  ANY media channel that brings him or his sick family to my attention will be exiled forever

1326940157484781568 2020-11-13 01:29:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I hope Corey finds time to visit Loeffler and Perdue soon   Spend hours together, blabbing and kissing and hugging  Be sharing
1326939408486952961 2020-11-13 01:26:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Go ahead - it's a free country  I've yet to eat anything Chik-Fil-A, ever

1326929490228862976 2020-11-13 00:46:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> THREAD
1326928091214610432 2020-11-13 00:41:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Hey,  remember when we impeached the president,  but the president's party said they shouldn't impeach him because that was for voters to decide  Then, when we had the next election, they pretended that we didn't vote against him, and that our ballots didn't count  Good times
1326926358946045954 2020-11-13 00:34:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BillyBaldwin Too bad they closed Alcatraz  It seems he would be eligible for the Capone Cell
1326925828664406018 2020-11-13 00:32:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @OpinionThorny @SteadyasweDodo You are right, imho
1326894861597831169 2020-11-12 22:29:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson He has a date with justice as well
1326882726071291906 2020-11-12 21:41:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Again with this idea that Trump will be anywhere BUT a courtroom or a jail cell  Individual 1 deserves justice  The American people deserves justice  He'll be 'titular head' of his D Block cell
1326879559917080576 2020-11-12 21:28:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Am I the only one who still believes, in fact DEMANDS that Donald Trump Trump brought to justice for his crimes  He won't be running for office from the Graybar Hotel
1326714144523915265 2020-11-12 10:31:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Mobster operations tend to be insular by nature  The Trump White House is more like Satriale's Pork Store than the Home of Modern Democracy
1326710065361924097 2020-11-12 10:15:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Sierra0505 @RickFreedland I expect to see him frogmarched by SDNY detectives
1326688368902643713 2020-11-12 08:48:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Excellent argument  I think the judiciary isn't quite as corrupt or accommodating as Trump and the @GOP wish them to be
1326687725315977216 2020-11-12 08:46:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @laurenboebert @realDonaldTrump Actually, never  He's an idiot and always lies  Lies don't win, they lose
1326650410073878530 2020-11-12 06:18:00 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @neal_katyal When a lawyer decides to represent an asshole like Trump,  their course into hell is already bought and (un)paid for

1326569732783316993 2020-11-12 00:57:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Ordinary1World Trump says lots of stupid things  SDNY will have something to say about future plans of the Trump crime family
1326556469823590401 2020-11-12 00:04:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HowardKurtz I want to exercise my constitutional right to obey to whatever Whoopi Goldberg says
1326527848870338561 2020-11-11 22:10:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Imagine that  What day is it? ... oh, Wednesday ... 6 a.m....   It's lying time again
1326526638419451904 2020-11-11 22:06:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @StevenBeschloss Not a fait accompli  The real fight will be in SCOTUS, who will NOT cancel the results and who will NOT install him as President
1326387289711374348 2020-11-11 12:52:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JohnWDean @ChloePolitiCat He's flailing and swinging his fists, but he isn't landing any blows  He's turned the @GOP into a gooey mess ... This is craziness beyond measure, and I don't see them surviving this for very long
1326375569689255936 2020-11-11 12:05:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mrddmia @realDonaldTrump Mail in ballots are completely legal  You do realize you will need extraordinary evidence; I should say you will need extraordinary provenance of extraordinary evidence, because Trumpists are a bunch of unbelievable liars who would degrade themselves by offering fake 'proof'
1326332808537673729 2020-11-11 09:15:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @toddstarnes @realDonaldTrump How was integrity lost at the ballot box?   Insinuations about mail in ballot malfeasance are unsubstantiated, and proven damned near impossible  One ballot with one name and one address  Once it's registered as 'voted', another ballot with that same name CANNOT count as voted

1326149241610227713 2020-11-10 21:06:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> They are going to file a flurry of frivolous lawsuits, using a panel of inept lawyers who question their service to this maniac  They are going to lose, but then they are going to file appeal after appeal  Trump is again flooding the judiciary zone with bullshit, as always
1326147485358718976 2020-11-10 20:59:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mechteldehuning @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @DecisionDeskHQ @POTUS NOTE: Ivanka Trump obtained a patent in China for 'voting machines' ....

1325801547486261248 2020-11-09 22:04:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DLeonhardt What's the possibility that, instead of Biden love, it was dislike of Trump that drove that vote?  Was it love of Biden, dislike of Trump, or both?  What percentage each?
1325781863797985281 2020-11-09 20:46:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Omega_Manx I appreciate when Joe honestly reports facts  But the @JoeNBC who attacks Progressives, literally pissing on the grave of FDR, can go straight to hell  EVERY progressive policy of the past enjoys high support TODAY  He's been red baiting for days now - FCUK you, former @GOP hack
1325776908848492544 2020-11-09 20:27:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Follow @brett_mcgurk for the military perspective in all this mess
1325640176081620993 2020-11-09 11:23:41 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @51PercentofUS Quisling  It applies MORE to accomplices   Vichy carries a similar meaning
1325639649734262784 2020-11-09 11:21:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is fascinating  Why would people register in record numbers then not vote?
1325634263220281344 2020-11-09 11:00:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Um ... what?   WTF is going on in Kentucky?
1325633018468261889 2020-11-09 10:55:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> He's going to drag this shit out for as long as possible  Give us some fucking PEACE, will ya?
1325581320269963264 2020-11-09 07:29:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Aye
1325501528296206337 2020-11-09 02:12:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DeanBrowningPA We'll be freeing those families on the border; We will detrumpify like Germany had to denazify after WWII  Close the holes that allowed mobster Trump to fill his pockets on our dime   Restore our alliances with our true friends, and break off Trump's love affair with dictators
1325500044699553793 2020-11-09 02:06:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @cary_zeitlin @david_darmofal @thenailpolisher That's an excellent point  FDR and Truman had to fight these claims  JFK and LBJ as well, yet they DID repel these fallacious insinuations  Each of those programs were enacted in a regulated capitalist economy, and the public did NOT own the means of production at any time
1325471486547689472 2020-11-09 00:13:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This stance by McConnell could negatively impact the GOP Senate races in Georgia  His intransigence and inability to produce for the American People will become a rallying cry for Democrats  Loefler is now exposed (again) for her stock trades; Daddy Trump won't bail her out again
1325469859505819649 2020-11-09 00:06:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That's a good start  I'm not sure about the risk of building out a transit network in the Age of CoVID; It's taking a hit right now in the Northwest  We do need to restore many bridges and roadways  Before Trump, we were headed to a strong green economy, which was stifled for oil
1325466050985484288 2020-11-08 23:51:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I  missed the "Conditional Concessions" class in my Constitutional Law School  (NOTE: I did not go to law school and I am not a lawyer)
1325465344320839682 2020-11-08 23:48:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @david_darmofal @thenailpolisher How do those swing districts feel about Social Security?  Medicare?  Clean Water Act?  Clean Air Act?  Roads, Bridges, Tunnels, Police and Fire Departments?  This isn't Marxist Socialism  But you are conflating it with Marxist Socialism, aren't you  You're playing word games
1325463522134781952 2020-11-08 23:41:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Donny Two Scoops has lost his personal DoJ lawyers  Paging Roy Cohn ...

1325437958925688832 2020-11-08 22:00:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Oh lookie  Republicans want to fix those pesky voting machines  OK ... Something we can agree on
1325437132958097410 2020-11-08 21:56:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RWPUSA @JoeBiden Yeah ... I get LOTS of emails, and I weed through them to verify their connection to legitimate campaign sites  Don't click on ANYTHING until you can prove it's legit
1325434096894406656 2020-11-08 21:44:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Remember when Trump and the @GOP removed sanctions from Russia?  Good times ...  Seems like so long ago  I wonder what will become of those sanctions once Biden takes office?  Who would remove those sanctions and why ?  Inquiring minds, etc etc
1325431281132335104 2020-11-08 21:33:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is WAY WAY off topic  But I didn't want any Danny Elfman fans to miss his first rock music release in 34 years in all this hubbub  It's bizarre, quirky and has a complexity you would expect from Danny the film score composer  Epic twists and turns   https://t.co/jSM9mYTm8a

1325273802104733696 2020-11-08 11:07:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> You look like brothers
1325262312727433216 2020-11-08 10:22:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CarreraRoz This is the angle which must be confronted in the Georgia Senate races  Ossoff has a chance, but Reverend Warnock was up against two Rs who's total percentage was significantly higher than his vote  I think we are tied now, right?  What happens if we split?   VP breaks the tie!
1325238562543972357 2020-11-08 08:47:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Sometimes you win with a minority  Sometimes you don't

1325216949484150784 2020-11-08 07:21:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Talk about the democratic party 'rift' all you want  The giant chasm between the NeverTrumpers and the Trumpists is the deeper, more significant break  The @GOP now has shorn off the most pragmatic leaders in the old coalition, and are left with badly damaged Trumpist buffoons

1325188782828613634 2020-11-08 05:30:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @angry__saint Each one of these very popular initiatives came from Progressive philosophy  Each policy was enacted in a market based, regulated capitalist system  The public has NEVER owned the means of production  New Deal Progressivism isn't marxist socialism; that's a red baited caricature
1325187420413784064 2020-11-08 05:24:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @angry__saint The 'socialist problem' needs to be dealt with  Social Security Insurance and Medicare are the most popular programs in the U.S. government - this is progressive policy in action  The Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Water Act,  the Clean Air Act;  Progressive
1325185406208409600 2020-11-08 05:16:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BillKristol Never anybody like Trump  Never a mobster   Never a traitor   Never a weak egotistical narcissist  Maybe a psychological profile should be a requirement for candidates?  And tax returns?
1325184044921806849 2020-11-08 05:11:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MelissaJPeltier @BillKristol @RVAT2020 @ForTheRuleOfLaw @BulwarkOnline And the split seems pretty much insurmountable right now  The NeverTrumpers are despised by Trumpists, and likewise  Which Trumpster is going to come back to earth first?  Any second thoughts about supporting the mobster dictator and promoting pure Russian propaganda in America?
1325181697571266561 2020-11-08 05:01:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> We found it! @GOP
1325181077464363009 2020-11-08 04:59:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Yeah .... Congratulations Captain Kelly and Gibby   Congratulations Arizona!
1325172246281793536 2020-11-08 04:24:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's kinda funny how the Trumpettes are blaming voting machine chicanery for their grievous loss   They ignored electronic vote manipulation for decades - but NOW it's a problem?   Yeah, it's a problem, so let's fix it after Biden takes office, k?  #FuckYouKeepCounting
1325170613233750016 2020-11-08 04:17:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom I drink maybe one drink per month on average  I think maybe 2 will be in order tonight  Old Fashioned with Bulleit Rye has been my go to for quite a while- So Be It!
1325169838910701569 2020-11-08 04:14:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Wow  He decided to do this to himself  He thought he could hide his criminality behind a wall of bullshit and capitalize on his office  He ruined his family - his whole house of bullshit is crashing down  A fateful choice
1325167866635669504 2020-11-08 04:06:54 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Hope to hear from you more as time goes by
1325157279591641088 2020-11-08 03:24:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And what of those tools who tried to foist Russian propaganda upon the American people?  Those who worked with them to create false narratives using Russian created deza?  Just WTF did Mueller find about their communications together?   What did over 100 Trump aides say to them?
1325156324976418821 2020-11-08 03:21:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Exactly
1325156080167522305 2020-11-08 03:20:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @14storiesCA @AOC @ProjectLincoln I think we need to unify these themes we agree with automatically  The Voting Rights Act must be restored, as well as the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts  SSI must be protected and strengthened  The rich MUST pay their fair share of taxes - Donald's $750 tax bill is shameful

1325128065253433345 2020-11-08 01:28:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The campaign going forward will be to restore what's been lost and erect new barriers to the perfidy Trump revealed to be possible WITHIN our current system  He opened a lot of holes in the processes we have used for decades.    We aren't ready for the NEXT Trump
1325127214443032577 2020-11-08 01:25:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Can a lame duck president be impeached?  Asking for a friend
1325123915459473410 2020-11-08 01:12:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit Bottom line  You screwed up  The steps you took, the choices YOU made, made it possible for nearly 9 in 10 mail in ballots to belong to Biden  Hell, even those 'Suckers and Losers' voted against you 4 to 1  Your ignorance has led to your demise as a public figure  It's your fault

To what end?  I see no benefit to Trump in this, so Occam's Razor applies
1325071224259571715 2020-11-07 21:42:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AOC Not the hill Progressives should die on, @AOC   We need a COALITION to bring down a dictator, so let's celebrate our collective success in doing just that  Plan for the post Trump era and now start CONVINCING the moderates on both sides to adopt the sane New Deal policies we need

1324911781882441728 2020-11-07 11:09:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> No more Mike Pompeo  Yay
1324911565250781186 2020-11-07 11:08:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KnowWhatEyeMeme I think more like Rudy Colludy at the wheel of a banged up White Bronco,  with Trump babbling in the back seat,  careening away at 20 mph
1324910044786294785 2020-11-07 11:02:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @POLITICOMag @gtconway3d This is spot on   Perfectly describes the boneheaded illogic of their rhetoric and how each wound was self inflicted  The @GOP is in serious trouble,  finally  Trumpism is the albatross around their fat necks
1324903790332375041 2020-11-07 10:37:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> A reminder  The transcripts of the dialogue between Putin and Trump at his pusillanimous "summits" belong to the American people  The files hidden on the super secret server related to those discussions belongs to the American people  The shredders are already working overtime

1324894267643359234 2020-11-07 09:59:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @NormOrnstein @CaptMarkKelly @GabbyGiffords I gave most to Captain Kelly and Gabby throughout this campaign season  I was a space shuttle technician, and watched the Kelly Brothers 'grow up' in the STS astronaut world.   I'm so pleased for Arizona and the Kellys !  Congratulations!
1324889735219720193 2020-11-07 09:41:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> If I were Biden, I would demand he NOT appear  Fcuk that pimply ass whacko   If Trump is a big enough asshole, he might be awarded with quick DoJ action on his many transgressions next January

1324749676176834561 2020-11-07 00:25:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @john_sipher You and I are living in a New Deal world ... social security and Medicare have been rightly legislated and enacted through the constitutional process  It's not freekin socialism
1324749290103738368 2020-11-07 00:23:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @john_sipher Let's not misrepresent American Progressivism with stalinist socialism or Marxism communism  Do you believe that Medicare is a commie-socialist plot?  The social security and an 8 hour workday represent a threat to democracy?   Then let's stop mischaracterizing what is being said
1324748233130692618 2020-11-07 00:19:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Danap56 @SteveSchmidtSES @ProjectLincoln I've been asking about his whereabouts the last few months  Is he and his army just beyond the banks of the Rubicon?
1324712857448009730 2020-11-06 21:58:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That's exactly the correct term  Trump needs a pitiless reckoning in the world
1324712454174040064 2020-11-06 21:57:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha
1324710541777006592 2020-11-06 21:49:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I like this idea
1324571234860847105 2020-11-06 12:36:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP really suck at governance  They suck even worse at democracy

1324535815863627776 2020-11-06 10:15:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson Well,  the more letters used indicates the seriousness of the message ...  I think he means it!
1324518456146866178 2020-11-06 09:06:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> They don't, and that's yet one more problem revealed in our 'perfect democracy'
1324518092936896512 2020-11-06 09:04:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenJohnBarrasso @realDonaldTrump Yeah  Fcuk democracy  Fcuk the constitution  GOD SAVE THE KING, you say?   Go to hell  You can visit that scumbag mobster in Leavenworth
1324517124560150528 2020-11-06 09:01:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KnowWhatEyeMeme @thejointstaff That would be troubling
1324514598897119232 2020-11-06 08:51:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @thejointstaff   Eyes open ... Milley is a decent and honest man, and that's what we need right now  Let's see what emerges from the shadows in this time of potential danger ... The U.S. military is the ultimate and final protector of democracy, if all else fails  Esper did right
1324503858123431936 2020-11-06 08:08:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Brasilmagic I don't think we need to worry about this, imho   He's not going to be in any position to campaign
1324503453968732162 2020-11-06 08:06:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I don't support any violence, against police or anybody else  Change the system, yes, but eschew violence in the process  If you choose to violate the law, you will be punished accordingly  Replacing one violence with another is NOT a solution
1324500887939657728 2020-11-06 07:56:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom In a typical political donor in the age of Bernie  No more than $20 to anyone,  but more of those to more candidates of MY choosing  Some won, Mark Kelly  Some lost, Amy McGrath, Jaime Harrison and Sara Gideon...

1324498061234589696 2020-11-06 07:45:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @gpommen Screw that  It's SingSing for his pimply ass
1324495675938103296 2020-11-06 07:35:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Exactly  DIG into the statements and demand evidence  Don't let him finagle this
1324493021258248192 2020-11-06 07:25:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Not only that, but the @FBI, the @CIA , and @thejointstaff need to keep a close eye on the republic - this is a moment of great peril  Bannon wants to behead Fauci and Wray - He's out on bond and needs to be taken seriously,  given the circumstances  Please - WATCH,  and act
1324468455798571008 2020-11-06 05:47:41 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @WalshFreedom @KimKimbowman @JoeWalsh   Do what I do  Keep digging into WHY  WHY is he a traitor?   What crime was committed?  Names, dates and locations,  please  Have you brought your 'evidence' to a prosecuting attorney?   Why not?   Keep digging ... it doesn't take long to find the problem

1324397626024894464 2020-11-06 01:06:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Yeah ... Evidence talks and bullshit walks  When they call it for Biden, we should tweet a the hashtag  #YoureFired in unison  All of us, like we're all screaming at his orange ass in his phony ass TV 'boardroom'
1324390257714843648 2020-11-06 00:36:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @myawesomelife4 Are Bill Barr's thugs in the building?

1324344461267144705 2020-11-05 21:34:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @hannahfduncann Oh STFU  What a bunch of hogwash  "We're just little angels ... TRUST ME"  For the record, we don't trust a single word from your mouths - Not a single syllable...  You've earned the disdain, so go to hell  Biden supporters = Decent Americans, EOS
1324343489564307457 2020-11-05 21:31:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> IMHO  Even the most extreme right leaning supreme court justice is NOT going to stop counting ballots  Bush v. Gore stopped a RECOUNT, not the initial ballot count  Counting votes is the essence of democracy ... They aren't going to deny democracy on behalf of the orange buffoon

1324163027541766146 2020-11-05 09:34:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> True  The Bush-Gore fiasco was related to the recount, not the initial ballot count, which nobody agreed were illegitimate in any way

1324150685902860288 2020-11-05 08:44:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @danielsgoldman Exactly  I noticed that some of the states actually counted the mail in first,  and delayed the same day counting, so it kinda foiled that scheme, at least partially  Frankly, I don't think their supreme court picks are going to let him stop counting the ballots; his goose&gt;cooked
1324114758669279232 2020-11-05 06:22:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Stopping the vote count is anti-American, anti-democratic, and the Supreme Court is not going to let you do it....  Even your hand picked floozies won't do it

1323688213559480320 2020-11-04 02:07:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @No1Hollyfreedom They all have to go  Trumpism will only exist at the Leavenworth Federal lockup after this

1323682585969479680 2020-11-04 01:44:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Think of the coming #BlueWave2020 as a thorough housecleaning ...  A tsunami to wash out the extremist, undemocratic aholes that have gained control of our government   So many Trump voters have seen the light - the only question is, how humiliating will the loss be for the @GOP?
1323671247750750209 2020-11-04 00:59:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @WhiskeyMD247365 @NBCNews Make up your own poll!  It's funny and easy!   Take any poll, then grab a crayon and cross out the numbers  Then, add any numbers that make you feel better  There,  you've 'unskewed' those pesky, silly polls showing Democrats shellacking the @GOP   See?  ... Better now?
1323670533834113024 2020-11-04 00:57:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Once this tragic play comes to an end, we need to make sure the American people remember who supported this nonsense  Who promoted it   Who broke our traditions  Who denied democracy  Who denied justice  Who hid the corruption and graft  Who placed children in concentration camps

1321257234064695296 2020-10-28 09:07:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger That's a valid opinion ... I still believe an immediate corrective is on order ... The @GOP committed massive theft of these judgeships against the people who voted for our congresspersons, not the Democratic party  @senatemajldr stole those seats from the electorate ... US!
1321254432785444865 2020-10-28 08:56:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is unfathomable  A lawless mobster  VOTE ! ... for the rule of law
1321240720074633216 2020-10-28 08:01:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @atrupar He's 100% pure idiot,  guaranteed
1321237649655554053 2020-10-28 07:49:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Bring it home, America  7 days ...
1321237339906166788 2020-10-28 07:48:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP sucks
1321236055023063044 2020-10-28 07:43:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The American people have signaled that Kavanaugh should be impeached for lying during his confirmation hearings
1321234408419037184 2020-10-28 07:36:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha... this pic has many uses
1321233680438857732 2020-10-28 07:33:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Can Melania and her chain migrated parents be deported when Donald goes to prison?
1321232791959425024 2020-10-28 07:30:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Where is Barr?  Mixing the Jim Jones KoolAid?
1321232310566617090 2020-10-28 07:28:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JasonMillerinDC Where's your psychiatrist?
1321232133407604737 2020-10-28 07:27:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DavidCornDC @FBI  @CIA @thejointstaff   Please protect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris against this bad man and his sick followers
1321230460014465029 2020-10-28 07:21:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kylegriffin1 I wonder how the judge feels about defendants entering his courtroom with semi-automatic weapons?   Allowed?   Permissible?   Open carry to the banc?   Fcuking hypocrite
1321229400034213888 2020-10-28 07:16:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You mean like this Obama crowd?  https://t.co/2BXJ6mCtzL

1321205742817275904 2020-10-28 05:42:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> You deserve success,  Mr. Vindman  THANK YOU for your true patriotism,  sir
1321205726950367233 2020-10-28 05:42:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> You deserve success,  Mr. Vindman  THANK YOU for your true patriotism,  sir
1321204891440848900 2020-10-28 05:39:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Bloomberg didn't pull his ads  What's wrong with Donnie Two Scoops?   The bullshit isn't flying anymore?
1321204201867730944 2020-10-28 05:36:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ResistsAj @MollyJongFast Who cares?   Leavenworth is a poor base for a political campaign
1321203781455982592 2020-10-28 05:35:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @donwinslow Pennsylvania not a tossup ?  Wisconsin not a tossup ?  Michigan?   Poor Donnie Two Scoops  Losing every which way he looks
1321203366899425281 2020-10-28 05:33:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SOCALRE4U @orgainkorgain Suckass bastards making the call
1321112078250377216 2020-10-27 23:30:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Trump and his Trumpist Party have bared the great weaknesses we didn't even realize existed in our constitutional government   Maybe the Senate Majority Leader needs to have some sort of constitutional limits to the amount of time he waits to consider court appointees?   A start
1321067451681886208 2020-10-27 20:33:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BrainHackedByXY @CREWcrew Click
1320961067535765504 2020-10-27 13:30:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That's what I'm thinking  2018 was poorly modeled and biased towards republicans' - the real numbers were better than expected  It's all hands on deck, now  One.Fcuking.Week
1320960402608574464 2020-10-27 13:27:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @donwinslow @Scaramucci Scaramucci has been on the straight and narrow for quite a while ...   Kinda weird (his being strongly for, then strongly against Trump) but he seems sincere and his comments are on point ...
1320923718936350721 2020-10-27 11:02:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @samwatson711 @donwinslow @senatemajldr @AmyMcGrathKY @GreenfieldIowa I want to point out that a number of very low post count tweeters are discouraging others from giving to Amy  This is a tell; since when does one Democrat tell another Democrat to NOT donate to a Democrat in a tight race?  Remember 2018?  I'll give to Amy
1320920937861124097 2020-10-27 10:51:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Ok .. I'm in
1320920587057942534 2020-10-27 10:49:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @NormOrnstein @joncoopertweets @JamilSmith @ParkerMolloy @AdamSerwer Excellent description
1320919302724308993 2020-10-27 10:44:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Obviously, having a Senate Majority Leader without a sense of democratic justice could block the intent of the majority  He can sit on over a hundred judge appointees AND a supreme court justice - shouldn't be have performed his constitutional responsibility in a timely manner?
1320918554435354624 2020-10-27 10:41:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @washingtonpost You guys still don't get it  #RudyColludy was sent to Eastern Europe with the EXPRESS INTENT of gathering disinformation to use in the U.S. Election.   He wasn't duped into receiving disinfo - that was the goal  What's hilarious?   Rudy had all this time, and THIS is all has?
1320917409482612737 2020-10-27 10:37:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That's a fine list ... I'm down
1320916699898667009 2020-10-27 10:34:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarshaBlackburn We'll pack the court and you'll pack your bags  I hear Moscow is really nice on the Fourth of July - get your tickets early and SAVE$!
1320916267344269312 2020-10-27 10:32:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Indeed
1320916199396560897 2020-10-27 10:32:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Those judges were appointed according to the will of the citizens who voted for those congresspersons; those judges with the CITIZEN'S judges  They didn't deny the Democratic party; they denied fellow citizens the due process they are entitled to according to the US Constitution
1320916197706207233 2020-10-27 10:32:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> When citizens vote for senators and representatives,  they do so with the intent of having those congresspeople do THEIR bidding - to reflect THEIR values  One person, the Senate majority leader, refused to perform his duty in 2016 when he blocked Merrick Garland and &gt;100 judges
1320913532012109824 2020-10-27 10:21:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CoryGardner @Hickenlooper Damn we hope so
1320907868577636353 2020-10-27 09:59:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Elections have consequences
1320907775887740929 2020-10-27 09:58:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Every Trumpist must lose their office
1320907624603418624 2020-10-27 09:58:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Enigmaticjones Which one?   Haha
1320904048934092806 2020-10-27 09:44:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @alicetweet @LindseyGrahamSC Hmmm ... I didn't know about you  Click
1320887937266012162 2020-10-27 08:39:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> More gaslighting
1320887684781481984 2020-10-27 08:38:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I get the feeling we aren't doing democracy the right way ...  This minority bias is shocking
1320886352372785152 2020-10-27 08:33:41 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Schlock Rocket sounds right
1320885722539266051 2020-10-27 08:31:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The governor is getting 'Zelenskied'  He's getting 'Ukrained' ...
1320881502863958025 2020-10-27 08:14:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CharlesPPierce @NicolleDWallace She began the Trump era in opposition to him ... I guess she adjusted her concept of goodness
1320881050382458883 2020-10-27 08:12:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MSkotnicki @donwinslow @matthewjdowd Well, we push back on that shit right outta the gate  They would like if we accepted that nonsense, but that's pretty mockable stuff  I love America by defending its institutions and democratic traditions, and by refusing to accept leaders/policies that support authoritarianism
1320834303849279489 2020-10-27 05:06:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson So, I guess they aren't going to endorse Bat Boy from Outer Space this year?
1320833453546524678 2020-10-27 05:03:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ByronYork Yeah  He's hiding in his basement,  right?   So his basement just be somewhere on the campaign trail ...
1320832611351146496 2020-10-27 05:00:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Hope012015 Maybe they are running a coven behind those marbled walls  Maybe her oath must be administered in tongues, with 'Little Flame-y' floating above,  smiling ...
1320831386803208194 2020-10-27 04:55:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BrendaLeeNY @LauraDiBella15 @DevinCow But we need the cows   We need the cows to shove through the water lines, to expand them, .... so we can have stronger showers
1320796616329175040 2020-10-27 02:37:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Every Republican who has supported this idiotic wannabe dictator has to own that support...  Hopefully NO Trumpist will survive beyond 2024
1320795876835643393 2020-10-27 02:34:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Not unlike poor Lindsey's complaints
1320785385899917312 2020-10-27 01:52:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Started with six
1320759268849655811 2020-10-27 00:08:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper Strangely enough;  Steve Hackett, former guitarist for Genesis, had a show at a local venue, and they had a PA that literally blew out my hearing for a week  The bass pedal went off like a fcuking bomb  Other than that, probably the Who and Zep
1320695716667445249 2020-10-26 19:56:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MollyJongFast I believe he mentioned that act early on, but instead, they were apparently using the idea of the DPA to intervene on existing orders; states that had ordered PPE had their orders redirected to the White House based on their interpretation of the DPA  It's a misreading of the act
1320692470565400577 2020-10-26 19:43:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @gepehill1 @OwensEfrem I didn't start lifting weights until age 58  It's a good approach for avoiding body-wasting disorders and re-establishing proper metabolic balance in your system  Add Intermittent Fasting and a walking regime, and you have Guido's very successful fitness restoration program
1320690521631682561 2020-10-26 19:35:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @donwinslow @matthewjdowd BTW  Democrats don't have a socialist agenda  Democrats have a NEW DEAL agenda, like they've had for 80+ years
1320482235414421504 2020-10-26 05:47:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @EasyMode243 @WHNSC 9 days, then January 21st
1320481452371435521 2020-10-26 05:44:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Ky_Gill28 @JtheWraith Oh,  and I'm from the best worst place in the world, Portland, OR  I had to dodge the anarchists, them Portland Moms and Dads,  and then navigate through many, many fires just to send that money ....  Whew...
1320480688660008981 2020-10-26 05:41:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Ky_Gill28 @JtheWraith Hi, I am Guido, and I've been feeding that kitty for months now - I am guilty as fcuk  And ... I'm a dark and shadowy figure ... grrrrr
1320444842095247360 2020-10-26 03:19:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Will the @GOP acknowledge the actual cause of this crime?   I greatly doubt they want to acknowledge or reveal their own culpability  Easier to blame some nameless target of your hatred instead of being honest brokers of truth
1320443447124385800 2020-10-26 03:13:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is dangerous ignorance, or a mindless conceit of his natural authoritarian impulses  Either way, he has no business being leader of a great democracy
1320435855283113990 2020-10-26 02:43:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CharlesPPierce Well, they certainly won't be solving it by election day  Or by Biden's Inauguration Day,  January 21th, 2021
1320431673855672320 2020-10-26 02:26:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This self dealing was NEVER supposed to happen  And hence why respected justice figures like @glennkirschner2 are pushing for a #TrumpCrimesCommission   They've done so much damage already- it STOPS in January  VOTE  !
1320430513232949248 2020-10-26 02:22:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr The courtroom janitor has more experience

1320424504162578433 2020-10-26 01:58:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenateGOP @HouseGOP   It's like there is a giant anchor dragging you down  Like a ten ton albatross around your collective necks  Hmmm ... I wonder what is is ??? !!!!
1320423747183017984 2020-10-26 01:55:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BadBradRSR Cool hand Luke  Portions of the script still permeates our culture
1320422918975754240 2020-10-26 01:52:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Rbrbndgrl @JimSwiftDC I think Jim is presenting this as a tongue in cheek reference  He's part of RVAT
1320422198327169025 2020-10-26 01:49:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> He's actually projecting, as usual  It's what HE would do if he were in that position, because he's an amoral ahole with a mobster mentality
1320413065460903937 2020-10-26 01:13:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @itsa_talia My momma grew up in Flatbush and Greenpoint (when it was still grungy tenements)  Brooklyn is a melting pot if there ever was a melting pot
1320412475364265984 2020-10-26 01:10:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Mocraig13 It's a demonization game they've been playing for decades  What's worse, instead of pushing back, Democrats hid in the 'safety' of adopting conservative emblems instead of defending New Deal policies, which is the real target of this rhetoric  The New Deal isn't 'radical leftism'
1320410289443983362 2020-10-26 01:01:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TimRyan @MikeDeWine ?  Isn't this your responsibility?
1320409777294331905 2020-10-26 00:59:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CaslonRichard Do you wear pants when you go out walking ?  Does your shirt have 2 arm holes ?  Do you ever use the brakes when driving your car ?
1320404035535470592 2020-10-26 00:37:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And do recall - It was as if those corporations were already lined up and ready to go  SOMEBODY planned this before the election
1320384105452810246 2020-10-25 23:17:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Hell yes, @glennkirschner2   The court MUST represent the will of the people UNMANIPULATED by a narrow sect  Whether reevaluating the earlier appointees or adjusting the numbers of justices on the panel; The American people deserve a court that honestly reflects their true values
1320382616500056064 2020-10-25 23:12:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RedTRaccoon Love you @foofighters

1320369825277947905 2020-10-25 22:21:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I always do the wrong thing  Wrong Thing Guido is my nickname
1320367293940092928 2020-10-25 22:11:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Goss30Goss It's a pretty safe statement
1320367163312570369 2020-10-25 22:10:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> AND the @GOP  The political wilderness awaits you, @SenateGOP   Trumpism has doomed you to political hell ... and it's so deserved  How many generations have passed since the Whigs were a thing?   Yeah, like that ....
1320363502989606919 2020-10-25 21:56:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HKrassenstein Hey @HKrassenstein   I see you attracted a bevy of trolls and bots right out of the gate on this  You are definitely doing right,  because they hate good people and only support assholes like Trump  Block the bots ... 9 days to go
1320362606046158848 2020-10-25 21:52:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP should feel a little stinging around the posterior area as well
1320362220749021184 2020-10-25 21:50:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> What I hate most about Twitter's new retweet option?   One extra keystroke every time  If time is money, that change is costing us
1320361569482608640 2020-10-25 21:48:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Which is why you'll be leaving the seat of power - you don't deserve to lead a great nation  The people deserve better than you,  @MarkMeadows
1320358579514343430 2020-10-25 21:36:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> That made me laugh for some reason
1320354215705927682 2020-10-25 21:19:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Not this Democrat  Don't trust conservatives with the keys to the election kingdom - MOST have ZERO respect for democracy
1320353439579279363 2020-10-25 21:16:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @neal_katyal Wow ... looks like ole Huck committed a crime, there  Probably a felony in them thar parts ...  And here I thought religious fanatics were moral people  Boy, was I wrong ...
1320352731240935424 2020-10-25 21:13:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ProjectLincoln  @RadioFreeTom  @TheRickWilson  @JRubinBlogger   Ok, fellow anti-Trumpers ... After the election we'll have to ask ourselves;  "Can working American families actually afford a $1,000,000 medical bill?"  I think you should reconsider M4A as a real, viable option
1320350983474548736 2020-10-25 21:06:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Pence should be treated like he's plutonium ... like he's radioactive   Please stay the fcuk away from me, Mister Vice President, sir
1320348640230203396 2020-10-25 20:57:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @politvidchannel Yeah, actually, it's time to put that arcane construct of patrician dominance out to pasture   One citizen - one vote  Count the votes - whoever has the most votes wins  Nothing more is necessary
1320344593959890944 2020-10-25 20:40:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @lagranderusty @OliviaTroye Worse yet, Trump and Kushner STOLE the PPE from those who DID act responsibly and ordered PPE materials  Like Goodfellas, they hijacked those truckloads of PPE, but under the color of authority   They redistributed that material to their kissass favorites; like a mob boss would
1320342327743946754 2020-10-25 20:31:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Wobbledance1 @HKrassenstein The epitome of Yeehaw  https://t.co/htsaWSUlG9
1320138726027165697 2020-10-25 07:02:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The tale of Don Siegelman relates a tragic miscarriage of justice that is yet to be made right

1320051442648969218 2020-10-25 01:16:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom I don't agree about Zep  TOTALLY agree about GnR  Slash is perfunctory  I cannot listen to Axl
1320017227492409346 2020-10-24 23:00:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RBReich $750 goes pretty far in GOP world
1319982264772558849 2020-10-24 20:41:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> 52 million voters have already voted, mostly Democrats  Some states have crossed the 50% point  With another 10 days to go, the opportunities to intimidate voters are quickly diminishing  They'll have plenty of GOP voters to mess with, however ... and slow down, and incite fear
1319982263988228096 2020-10-24 20:41:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> By election day, most Democrats will have already voted, and the only voters in line left to intimidate are traditional GOP voters who only vote on election day  Efforts to intimidate Democrats may find few Democrats to intimidate  They would have to flood the zone, every day
1319982263203819521 2020-10-24 20:41:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I am fascinated with the GOPs idea of swarming polling places with intimidation teams on election day, hassling and interfering with voters to .... I actually don't know WTF they think this will accomplish, but here is a twist  MANY Democrats are voting early; By a huge margin
1319861026897252352 2020-10-24 12:39:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> When I feel concern and anxiety about our next big electoral battle ahead, I take comfort in knowing that democrats did far better in the 2018 election than polls had indicated then  The #BlueWave was rolling big in 2018, and it's gonna be just as shocking and surprising in 2020
1319854702549454849 2020-10-24 12:14:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> What is a Trump Rally?   "A place where Trump tries to kill his own voters" - Guido
1319835803946811392 2020-10-24 10:59:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JenniferNassour Same question from Trump about fallen soldiers  'What's in it for them? '  Conservatives are pretty shallow in these parts ...

Then again, Trump covered them with that $750
1319341674104061953 2020-10-23 02:15:41 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SensualGemss @senatemajldr Not a problem  Well have 11-13 court members in 4 years  Cheaters never prosper

1319260142580293634 2020-10-22 20:51:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Nancy Pelosi thought Trump would 'rise to the occasion'  I appreciate her optimistic hopefulness on a human level  However, Trump has lived as a criminal for decades ... Given power,  his essential nature would drive him to use that power to forward his worst criminal compulsions

This effort to create/conjure false evidence began two years ago, when Trump directed both #RudyColludy and Barr to search for Biden 'evidence'  He failed in Ukraine  He struck pyrite in Moscow  Not gold, because it's all falling apart on him

1317255463495413770 2020-10-17 08:05:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Mocraig13 Also, we need to IMMEDIATELY start knocking down this pandemic with reasonable controls; like those promoted by real medical scientists  I think the restoration and improvement of our democracy is critical to our long term existence, and certainly our happiness  Trump broke it
1317253546899886080 2020-10-17 07:58:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Mocraig13 No  I think we need to purge our system of the sins of Trump and the Trumpist Republicans who aided and abetted his crimes, and TRY,  perhaps beyond hope, to restore the reasons to believe in American democracy   It's going to take much work - let's start with racial justice

1317132569343918080 2020-10-16 23:57:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ida_skibenes @benshapiro How long before @MarshaBlackburn claims the 'mean woman' attacked the president with baseball bats and punji sticks?   Questions are SO hard!
1317132081215033344 2020-10-16 23:55:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @benshapiro Congratulations to @benshapiro for being Putin's Dingleberry Attendant

1317083153442480128 2020-10-16 20:41:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @lt4agreements He's full of shit  I would ask:  "What exactly makes the American leftists 'totalitarian' ?  What are the characteristics of totalitarianism which are embraced by the left?  Give us examples of how specific members of 'the left' have advocated totalitarian measures"  Facts matter
1316959654472273921 2020-10-16 12:30:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @jimsciutto Trump wanted Giuliani to gather Russian disinformation, and Barr too  It was the entire reason

1316807515863158786 2020-10-16 02:25:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> EXACTLY the right answer
1316802902183247874 2020-10-16 02:07:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Did @realDonaldTrump conspire with the armed white supremacist gangs in Michigan to kidnap and murder the governor of Michigan?  It's seems he's disappointed she is still the governor of Michigan  Somebody should look into that ...
1316801325448003591 2020-10-16 02:01:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SarahPalinUSA Btw - this Hunter 'information' fell apart within hours of @GOP PIMPING it on conservative media  CLEARLY generated by a nefarious 3rd party (Russians)  Can you see the hill of Russian bullshit you want to die on from your porch?
1316800392467021824 2020-10-16 01:57:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SarahPalinUSA Don't you need long, public rallies to air your personal grievances?  Is Donald doing it wrong?
1316799033239887879 2020-10-16 01:52:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @FrankFigliuzzi1 @GOP This should have had a question mark  " Fox News was involved in the plot to generate this DEZA propaganda ? "
1316798264616931328 2020-10-16 01:49:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @FrankFigliuzzi1 It's like they were prepared to catapult this bullshit BEFORE it was even revealed  Fox News was involved in the plot to generate this DEZA propaganda   Did they conspire with Trump, #RudyColludy, the @GOP AND Putin's GRU before the fact?
1316793007635488768 2020-10-16 01:28:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenRickScott Russian generated disinformation isn't protected by the U.S. Constitution, is it?   Private parties aren't required by constitution or statute to disseminate Russia GRU generated DEZA, are they?  ARE THEY, SENATOR?  Take your Dezinformatsiya to the Supreme Court, and try it there
1316786240981790721 2020-10-16 01:01:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarshaBlackburn Oooo - is she getting 'attacked' again?   What is it this time?   Billy clubs to the shoulders and neck?   Cat O'Nine tails?  ... was it a Cat O'Nine?   Or,  do people disagree with her, you, and the entire conservative movement, who has led the nation SO FAR ASTRAY?

1316779535765995520 2020-10-16 00:34:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ElieNYC I for one believe that adding justices to the court, if done as described in ther U.S. Constitution, is perfectly legitimate and worthy of our consideration  Don't buy the 'court packing' bs - it's perfectly constitutional to add justices to the court

1316625536068792320 2020-10-15 14:22:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I think that, at long last, the @GOP have bitten off more than they could chew  They've screwed the pooch   They've crossed the line  They've made a deal with the devil  And,  the people EVERYWHERE are getting sick of it  Their embrace of Trump is suicidal and unstoppable  Aw

He's yet to produce a forged document worthy of anybody's attention  Less than 3 weeks to go, and Rudy's final effort stinks like another skunk

GO #BlueWave2020 !
1316602699400515589 2020-10-15 12:51:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha #RudyColludy   The hapless bonehead of a lawyer who can't seem to create believable forgeries  He's a D-List con-man... and nothing more  Pretty soon he'll be a con-vict

1316531450930499585 2020-10-15 08:08:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> There is a major logical error in Republican thinking regarding placing the election in the hands of SCOTUS  There is absolutely NO guarantee that even the most conservative justice would be willing to throw their reputation into doubt on behalf of a mobster if the loss is huge

1316429480248963074 2020-10-15 01:23:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @GregMolidor I honestly don't need debates,  and haven't watched in decades  Why?   I would NEVER vote for a Republican, ever  I held my nose to vote for Dukakis in 88, for instance, but I would never vote for Bush, so it's a moot point

1316404271508750336 2020-10-14 23:43:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's a bullshit argument promoted by right wingers for decades  The U.S. Constitution is a living document, designed to change with the times  Democrats and Progressives need to stake out a wider footprint in the body politic  Establish a strong policy program and PROMOTE IT!

Day and escort him out?”

1315698147621036033 2020-10-13 00:57:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HoltonSharp I live where the Multnomah tribe once hunted and fished  When I think of how much I love this land, I remind myself that others loved it for over ten thousand years
1315691638887510016 2020-10-13 00:31:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @clairecmc It's the essence of why those justices are illegitimate   That,  and the fact that Republican senators also received LESS votes than the Democratic Senators ...  3 justice chosen by minority extremists?   You betcha

1314278733155573762 2020-10-09 02:57:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @paulkrugman Paul?   Betsy DeVos was involved (and helped bankroll)  the earlier RW protests ...  Is it possible the Secretary of Education is bankrolling the attempted coup of a state government?    https://t.co/E3MqGJDFfd
1314276053762932736 2020-10-09 02:46:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarshaBlackburn I see how this works  1. Elect president that ignores common sense and causes massive viral infection in populated areas  2. Blame mayors and residents for escaping crowded conditions in cities during a pandemic THE PRESIDENT CAUSED  @MarshaBlackburn ?  We will never let you lie
1314271622367502336 2020-10-09 02:29:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HKrassenstein Also ask ourselves; Is it proper for a member of the president's cabinet to participate in the overthrow of a state government?
1314266695935066113 2020-10-09 02:09:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HKrassenstein If we asked ourselves the question,  'could the same groups of individuals who participated in the earlier protests awry the Michigan State Capital also be involved in this plot? '  What? Some other set of RW whackos is involved?    Not any from the earlier action?   Not a chance
1314264377403609088 2020-10-09 02:00:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HKrassenstein Snopes has an extensive rundown on these connections, here:    https://t.co/E3MqGJDFfd

1314247948549656576 2020-10-09 00:55:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HKrassenstein Mrs.   It should be recalled that nefarious dark money groups,  including the DeVos family,  PAID the groups in Michigan to stage their 'protests'  We need to know if they are also bankrolling these state coup participants

1314041798638133248 2020-10-08 11:15:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @PaulVSpellman This is false - nobody is disrespecting the OFFICE  They disrespect what is the WORST President in U.S. history   I'm not sure what you call letting citizens die through ignorance and deception, but it's not to be respected in any way  The Kurds, NATO, Tariffs, Border Camps,  etc

1314004577230835712 2020-10-08 08:47:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> What's another name for 'Voting Advocates'?  Oh yeah ... Citizens
1313997090607910912 2020-10-08 08:18:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> A neverending torrent of badness from the @GOP   A person could get dizzy watching this maelstrom of deception and malevolent intent spin like a fucking tornado  - 24 hours a fucking day -7 days a week
1313995898674794496 2020-10-08 08:13:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @grace_panetta Any attempt to deceive voters is 'fraud and corruption', whether in government or not, or whether it is considered a crime or not
1313994958597091328 2020-10-08 08:09:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @grace_panetta Wrong answer  You imply that; because the group is an 'outside group', that they cannot commit fraud or corruption  Completely false - Private parties can also defraud voters by knowingly providing false voter information, especially if working under contract for a government
1313961325618487303 2020-10-08 05:56:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realrevwindham Cool

1313930942076071937 2020-10-08 03:55:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I had to do just that this morning,  but when I went to remove it, twitter wouldn't let me - forced me into a new captcha and AGAIN entered phone number  Every time I tried to remove it,  twitter access died again  So, this is a new policy?   After I post this, I'm removing it
1313930936321486852 2020-10-08 03:55:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Imagine if you always removed your real phone number after you're reactivated your twitter account, just to make sure you cannot be tracked by evil people  Imagine if @jack decided to share your personal information with bad actors  He could do that by forcing you to include cell
1313922744862617600 2020-10-08 03:22:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> So ... has twitter changed its phone number policy?   Won't let me delete it now - not pleased

1313301917045579776 2020-10-06 10:15:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Goss30Goss @HCTrudo @BernieSanders Bernie says he's a socialist, but American Progressivism enacted Social Security, Medicare, the 8 hour workday, and the 40 hour work week  Are you a socialist when you accept an unemployment check?  When Granny uses Medicare?   We PAY for this stuff for a reason; it ain't free
1313299820413693952 2020-10-06 10:07:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Imagine a president who attempts to minimize the protections against a widespread global pandemic  What kind of DICK president would do such a thing just as things were getting REALLY bad in the midwestern heartland  These are mostly Republican voters   https://t.co/6Y8lORy7Ck

1312410847885451266 2020-10-03 23:15:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @StevenBeschloss @Watchdogsniffer I feel bad for Amy Coney Barrett's kids, whom MOM decided didn't need masks .... She wants to be a Supreme Court Justice
1312409530827853824 2020-10-03 23:09:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The whole @GOP should go into quarantine
1312230401302241281 2020-10-03 11:18:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Yeah ... where's Laura Ingraham's medical expertise when you need it
1312217759456034818 2020-10-03 10:27:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Amy_Siskind My take on this:   Amy Coney Barrett's children are not wearing masks, and that is HER fault  And she wants to be a supreme court justice ....

1312212520929648646 2020-10-03 10:06:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> My goodness  A most righteous condemnation
1312209354980945921 2020-10-03 09:54:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @matthewjdowd It's why you left the party  Now if we can just convince you guys that Keynesian economics and New Deal policies work best for a great nation, then we can unite into a huge movement forward to the future  BTW, we are horribly late for Infrastructure Week ... We need that
1312204428934479872 2020-10-03 09:34:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AriBerman All true
1312192433795473408 2020-10-03 08:47:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I'm calling it  Trump is out   He's sensitive to this pathogen and panicking as the symptoms escalate  If he survives, he may suffer extended symptoms for months to come  There is no way he is going to continue the campaign if he suffers the worst symptoms  He will be out
1312191215358500864 2020-10-03 08:42:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It really seems like the @GOP are paying a price for their wrongheaded, anti-science stance  I'm trying to keep my humanity intact, but I don't think a 'We told you so' or two would be out of order
1312187787198697472 2020-10-03 08:28:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Reminder: There is no guarantee that the so-called Covid Cocktail will work in every case  It seems like he might be susceptible to the worst symptoms, given this rapid escalation   This candidate may not survive this medical emergency
1312186580719693824 2020-10-03 08:23:54 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Wow ... That bird is coming home to roost  Will the @GOP Kakists fall ill like dominoes ?
1312185329110052864 2020-10-03 08:18:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> A fair statement
1312184594968440834 2020-10-03 08:16:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @B52Malmet No
1312182527021342720 2020-10-03 08:07:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA The hypocrisy is striking
1312182358133465088 2020-10-03 08:07:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I understand that we want the President of the United States of America and his family to be healthy and safe, and I do  I also understand that 210,000 innocent persons are now dead because an ignorant man became President of the United States of America and failed to protect us

1312012843022245897 2020-10-02 20:53:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LynnR3dh3ad @JillWineBanks It's not a hoax - there is no pool of sympathy for this president  He could just back out of the debates without faking CoVID or destroying his campaign, which is what this will do ...  Doesn't smell like a hoax from where I sit
1312012005495242752 2020-10-02 20:50:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @matthewjdowd Lack of concern = Republican badge of honor
1312011581727952899 2020-10-02 20:48:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I do think the Trump Administration should now wear masks imprinted with images of fried eggs
1312009240991596544 2020-10-02 20:39:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MollyJongFast There is always a tweet
1312008844529164288 2020-10-02 20:37:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @gtconway3d Even the Hicks story is a Regression to the Tail event, spreading like a wildfire or CoVID itself - They couldn't contain it  Fascinating
1312007305509048326 2020-10-02 20:31:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DeanObeidallah Screw that  Life is tough, and it never stops
1312005871942025218 2020-10-02 20:25:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @jimsciutto That cuts against the desire of right wingers to hate everybody
1312004955046256640 2020-10-02 20:22:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I greatly doubt Trump, who is so reactive to his own instincts, could plan a successful 'fake' event of this nature  The succession of news items are consistent with a real contagion event, so in my mind the event is the news, and not the statements of political operatives
1312004954169634816 2020-10-02 20:22:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> 3rd, the protocols can compel chain of succession provisions of the constitution beyond the control of the campaign, which is a significant risk at this point  Lastly, the Hicks diagnosis seems legit, and so the pattern was are seeing now would be consistent as a reaction to that
1312004953255243776 2020-10-02 20:22:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is why I don't believe this story is a hoax  Most importantly, there is no real pool of sympathy for these miscreants beyond the current 38% that already kiss his ass on a regular basis - Can't be for sympathy  2nd, it destroys his campaign strategy to hold big rallies
1312000478444617728 2020-10-02 20:04:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @glennkirschner2 I think it's clear that Hicks was infected, and given her constant proximity with the upper echelon, it's credible to believe that some of them will have contracted this disorder  It doesn't smell like a hoax to me
1311999619849613313 2020-10-02 20:00:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @madninnie2 The Snopes rating is based on the idea that Trump was referring to the Democratic reaction to his policies as a hoax, not the existence of the virus  The problem is, those comments had the effect of planting the hoax meme in the right wing worldview  The effect is the same
1311969964224471041 2020-10-02 18:03:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @benshapiro Oh FFS  Your moment has passed, useless fcuk - A cancer on the American Body Politic  Kiss the Giant Orange Ass yourself

1311825576655753216 2020-10-02 08:29:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The Republican party and their extremist right wing militia buddies are an insult to the memories and honor of those brave ANTI-FASCIST soldiers who gave all for Democracy  The @GOP would sell out Democracy for a tax cut or a judgeship

1311091978428321792 2020-09-30 07:54:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CosmicJt23 @ThatEricAlper Case in point:  as soon as I heard This is a Call,  I immediately wanted to get my hands on a guitar and learn the bridge ... I'm a guitarist and I was blown away at the creativity of his constructions  My respect for Grohl is absolute - THAT is how you write rock songs
1311090027204546561 2020-09-30 07:46:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CosmicJt23 @ThatEricAlper That was the first song I heard,  and yeah, it holds a special place in my musical soul ...  The second track was also a strong piece ... an awesome one-two punch on a rock album ...
1311088030346743808 2020-09-30 07:38:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CosmicJt23 @ThatEricAlper The whole album is his ...  Extraordinary ... that album changed my life
1311086228276613120 2020-09-30 07:31:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Oh noes!  The devil SOCIALISM is stalking the land, brutalizing Americans with streets, highways, libraries, public schools, SSI, Medicare, 8 hour workday,  40 work week ...   Oh the fcuking HORROR!  It's awful how socialism DESTROYED America, isn't it?
1311069655918718976 2020-09-30 06:25:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @pdazzleliscious My earliest memory   Watching the Nixon-Kennedy debates as a 3.5 year old

1311044282376052736 2020-09-30 04:44:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> One of 205,000 American tragedies, courtesy of the @GOP and their infatuation with Trumputin, The Village Idiot
1311042973233160192 2020-09-30 04:39:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @john_sipher Preach it, @john_sipher   Fraudulent claims like this are desperate and born of pure cynicism   John McCain was highly respected by Democrats, even as a Republican, and yet they abuse him now  A perfect example of how the American RW destroyed the remaining integrity of the @GOP
1311016475734417408 2020-09-30 02:54:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @NRCC @SpanbergerVA07 So Saudi-backed is a deal breaker?

1310817249326821378 2020-09-29 13:42:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Kat_Don @danielsgoldman So yeah ... there is no reason a good person WOULDN'T be cleared as long as they aren't traitorous mobster fcukups like the Trump Kushner Crime Family  Every one of them would have normally failed this process, yet they all have them?   That ain't right
1310816334737883136 2020-09-29 13:39:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Kat_Don @danielsgoldman I have applied for clearances, and have received interim clearances to perform the work while waiting months for the clearance to go through  If I wasn't cleared, I would be walked out at the time of denial

1310777486070837248 2020-09-29 11:04:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RuthResistor @GOP Then again, if a person and a party is willing to help 200,000 of their fellow citizens to an early grave, it's hard to imagine they give one holy fcuk about a few 10000  The Kurdish abandonment is a dark mark on our history, and will not be forgotten  Read @brett_mcgurk page
1310776239376879616 2020-09-29 10:59:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RuthResistor I think this is the WORST transgression committed by these treasonous fcuks; Even worse than the family separations at the @GOP concentration camps, because Kurd families were cut loose in an active battlefield  Both our own soldiers AND Kurd families were betrayed by Trump

ANY politician who played this game should get shitcanned

1310736233392267265 2020-09-29 08:20:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RuthResistor We all knew some kind of deal was made  The worst part is the horror and shame it brought to both the brass and the rank and file to abandon such a dedicated ally ... like that  To cast them aside so they could be massacred  Trump is the WORST general,  ever
1310734066639990785 2020-09-29 08:12:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Because Billionaires and the @GOP have destroyed any sense of tax fairness in the nation

It's time for the home, ole buddy ... you've done your job (poorly), so it's a good time to exit  Do that pidgin fishing you always wanted to do

1310707175669428224 2020-09-29 06:25:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Once we regain control of our government from the amoral mobsters who secretly and maliciously subvert our voting systems, perhaps we can make voting systems AND election laws universal across the land?

1310200697489559553 2020-09-27 20:52:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA @JoeBiden Conservatives have been playing this game for decades, and Democrats have been running scared from the word instead of pointing out the essential fallacy of the assertion (That Democrats are Marxian socialists)  Democrats have NEVER promoted the classic socialist model
1310198901178159106 2020-09-27 20:45:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA @JoeBiden So when conservatives condemn American progressives as 'socialists', it is a purposeful conflation used to demonize, when the reality is; American Progressivism is Keynesian, and has ALWAYS existed within a capitalist framework, and enacted legislatively per constitutional norms
1310197619876978689 2020-09-27 20:40:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA @JoeBiden A word about that word  The term Socialism has different connotations that are not subtle - They mean quite different things when we speak of 'American Socialism' versus 'classic socialism'  The rhetorical trick is to purposely refer to one as the other - to conflate and confuse
1310196695532216320 2020-09-27 20:36:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA @JoeBiden Ask them to define ANYTHING they claim  EVERY statement from his mouth is suspect and should inspire tougher questioning  Manipulative SOBs like Trump and the @GOP need to have their comments 'aired out' in public  DEMAND proof of every claim  Mail in ballots are fraud? PROVE IT!

Motions to delay debate - the filibuster is one example - are common in all legislative assemblies  That's not authoritarian - it's parliamentarian

1310026646804545536 2020-09-27 09:21:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Every reason to add justices in order to CORRECT the minority terror that lurks in our government  This would be way different than FDRs failed effort - it's justified as a reaction to subterfuge and vote manipulation  The SCOTUS must reflect the mores and values of the majority

1309997480214364166 2020-09-27 07:25:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @donwinslow I don't know a single Bernie supporter who agrees with this ... not a one
1309958669774123009 2020-09-27 04:50:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @klkc2009 I've been using 5:2 Intermittent Fasting for over 7 years - I've lost 100# and never gained it back  Check my pinned tweet, and good luck
1309939140826263552 2020-09-27 03:33:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @politvidchannel MSM  When administration officials offer these paltry, slimmed down comments, feel free to ask for further details  WHAT exactly is Biden going to do that will make it unrecognizable?
1309899181482323971 2020-09-27 00:54:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mmpadellan Add McSally...  I support all 4 of those Democrats with Bernie-style donations
1309898675804495872 2020-09-27 00:52:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @McFaul @Twitter I am offended by this tweet  Oh wait ... wrong thread  Ambassador?... there is no reason to worry about hurt feelings on this ... most tweeters have a NO DM policy ... it's quite common and you are just as free to adopt it as anyone else,  more so given your actual stature
1309851207255470080 2020-09-26 21:43:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger Saying that; I'm thankful that your stance on Trump is clear as a bell ... thanks for your strong efforts to fight this menace,  @JRubinBlogger
1309850719952936960 2020-09-26 21:42:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger The 'socialist' term is so hackneyed and distorted, and purposely made so  The intentional conflation of 'this socialism' with 'THAT socialism' has been ongoing for over five decades, as a club to beat down Democrats  You've been a part of that  Joe is 'socialist', like this  https://t.co/PNpQnYBziN
1309847681552904192 2020-09-26 21:29:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @politico Only Democrats, @politico ?  Isn't the Politico business organization concerned about a putative dictator overthrowing our constitutional government?  Only Democrats care about that,  and not you?  BTW; 160 million angry Americans descending on Washington DC is power unimaginable
1309846251899432961 2020-09-26 21:24:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Maybe they can catch a meeting with the Trump Family, in a backroom at the BadaBing club
1309840551936585728 2020-09-26 21:01:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @funder @TLangley99 @GOP Dead Floridian republicans, while regrettable, would have only themselves to blame, and we all have to admit that dead republicans can't vote  The @GOP has a weird deathwish lately, and it's destroying their own base  Oh well ....
1309839767131967488 2020-09-26 20:58:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @funder @TLangley99 Most Democrats aren't stupid enough to take the bait  @GOP members will fill those infected spaces, and share their breath, shoulder to shoulder, face to face, and in complete disregard for the reality of this pandemic  It only takes a few days or weeks to catch this, then die
1309838523504050176 2020-09-26 20:53:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TrueFactsStated Hooray ... That's great news   It just so happened I was looking someone who was NOT Mike Pence !  Destiny fulfilled, thanks to Kamala Harris ... and thanks to Donald Trump for steering us in the right direction
1309632093245251584 2020-09-26 07:13:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @donwinslow They were PRIMARY ballots

1309630109343645696 2020-09-26 07:05:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @django22 They are denying YOUR vote   This is a matter for your state supreme court, eventually
1309629622326231042 2020-09-26 07:03:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MasterOfMoxie BTW   It's been shown that those ballots were for the Primary,  which is long past  The story fell apart almost immediately
1309629128027504640 2020-09-26 07:01:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ida_skibenes Continue to be the inspiration you have always been

1309574227779960832 2020-09-26 03:23:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @EWErickson Yeah ... I've seen those kids with Spina Bifida sneaking out of their mother's wombs and hanging out at gin joints and opium dens, just getting PLASTERED!  I think they were smoking big fat cigars ....  .  o  O (  Once again, Right Wing Aholes making utter fools of themselves )
1309511588609536000 2020-09-25 23:14:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha ... I'm down  Whine away, senator
1309511404819329024 2020-09-25 23:13:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Ordinary1World And fuck you Trump voters, who put Tribalism before country and constitution
1309508725900603393 2020-09-25 23:03:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JoanieReb Nobody would be obligated to actually vote for him,  so yeah,  grab that discount coupon and vote for Biden
1309481810418528263 2020-09-25 21:16:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Longwood01 I rarely exceed $15 per donation  I do send to at least 4 different candidates per month, and that's what I can afford   If ALL of us sent $5 per month, they would be awash in funds
1309481685059211265 2020-09-25 21:15:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Longwood01 The worse thing is;  once I started getting unbidden requests from every Democrat in the world, I also started getting SPAM texts  My number was suddenly out there when it had been spam free before
1309477426741739520 2020-09-25 20:58:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Calling Alexandr Torshin  Calling Alexandr Torshin  Useful idiot on line 1
1309475278427582465 2020-09-25 20:50:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's my understanding that Trump secretly traveled to the Yugoslavic region in the 90s and negotiated a peace deal  He would have photographic evidence, but he hadn't invented the camera yet
1309474320205320197 2020-09-25 20:46:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AnnieGabstonH Many of those on the 'left' aren't actually radical  Demanding a decent working wage is not radical   Expecting reasonable costs for college and medical care is not radical  A clean environment, public infrastructure, medical care and social security are NOT radical ideas
1309471956870164480 2020-09-25 20:36:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's important to note that Meadow's had this opportunity to provide such evidence, and did not  Why ? ... HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY !  Argument from ignorance
1309326685037187072 2020-09-25 10:59:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TeaPainUSA I was hoping for zero, but oh well ...  By my count, Trump is batting zero in just about every field, including medical science, military competence, democratic government and foreign affairs, to name a few  Too bad he bats 1,000 for CoVID and unnecessary death  He's good at that
1309323081735786496 2020-09-25 10:45:23 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Pattihatestrump You would think the Trumpeteers would WANT to get CoVID, just so they can be first in line to get the Trump Vaccine!   EMBRACE the #TrumpVirus righties!     Get a shot of Trump medicine, right in your Trump- loving arse!   . o O ( I'm talking about the vaccine, you guys! )
1309288595425951744 2020-09-25 08:28:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Note how gleefully @SenRonJohnson tells his constituents they are in line for some SOCIALIST COMMUNIST payouts directly from taxpayer pockets !  I am guessing taxpayers from New York, California, New Jersey, Washington State are MORE than thrilled to give this traitor their money
1309283908144435201 2020-09-25 08:09:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RebelincO @lsaldanamd @thehill You can't lie or misrepresent when signing a contract  You can get sued  I'm guessing we're all the better off if we just block your completely WRONG ass and never read another, single word of bullshit from you ever again
1309245063826874368 2020-09-25 05:35:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @thekjohnston So is non-violence, apparently  MLK and Ghandi were very clear about how violence can distract from the goals they seek, and it would be very decent if members of our movement would embrace it
1309201821215277057 2020-09-25 02:43:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @marklevinshow Counting ballots isn't the same as voting, numbskull  No ballots accepted after close of polling places  No mail in or absentee ballots accepted after close of polls  IOW, you're full of shiat  Of course they are going to count all the ballots they DID receive before polls closed
1309200028716605440 2020-09-25 02:36:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LadyJayPersists Haha ....  I discovered 'Navy Coffee' when I accidentally cleaned a fellow tech's coffee cup,  which had a disgusting layer of darkness all around the inside ...  It was his prized coffee patina... washed down the sink
1309165833831297025 2020-09-25 00:20:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The scattered thoughts of a pathological liar
1309165375137832960 2020-09-25 00:18:43 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SRuhle @RepMattGaetz Isn't he always incorrect?
1309164672134909953 2020-09-25 00:15:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mjhegar Take this story to your next advertisement   Show the tattoos  Explain what they cover  Tell them how you got them  Then ask if John Cornyn has an battlefield wounds ...  Unless he stabbed himself with a pencil, the answer is decidedly NO - He did NOT serve in the military
1309148290714185728 2020-09-24 23:10:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senrobportman Bothsiderism is a Russian Deza strategy  And here you are, a Republican,  using those same tactics as Putin's GRU  It's all the rage in conservative circles - Lying like Putin  FYI- Biden NEVER alluded to not abiding with the election results - EVER  We got your number
1309147220709715969 2020-09-24 23:06:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kylegriffin1 Let's talk on January 21, 2021, @GOP
1309146490091180037 2020-09-24 23:03:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @neeratanden I didn't know he was an authoritarian  I did know he was an asshole
1309131301488820233 2020-09-24 22:03:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr Your role in this and Russian payoffs to the @GOP will be the stuff of history textbooks for years to come
1309110502736441344 2020-09-24 20:40:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @prayforchange20 @pademsunite She doesnt have voting machines - only a Chinese patent
1309019922220056576 2020-09-24 14:40:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Wisdom  Don't fall for the fear tactics - Push back immediately and don't stop  His words aren't supernatural edicts - He's actually quite full of shit, and needs to be called out for it  My Brooklyn aunts and uncles would destroy these buffoons in a New York second!
1309017192655130624 2020-09-24 14:29:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"  Insulting our NATO allies fulfilled that goal  The @GOP is helping them
1309017191464030215 2020-09-24 14:29:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> ... Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements –
1309017190176296960 2020-09-24 14:29:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> "Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". ...
1309015538421686274 2020-09-24 14:23:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is wisdom  It has been the stated goal to infiltrate US systems of ALL types to cause disruption and chaos ... It's been planned since the mid 90's  This was the textbook:  https://t.co/zo52tcTgFB
1309011306490605577 2020-09-24 14:06:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Someone should ask him exactly how that all works, and what evidence he has that shows it is happening  MAKE him explain it ... walk him through it to 'see the fraud'  He has no fucking clue WTF he is talking about - He CAN'T explain it, yet no media will press him to defend it
1308965786334109697 2020-09-24 11:05:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom Yup
1308965445702045696 2020-09-24 11:04:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I totally agree  This takes impeachable conduct to the next level  The @GOP can't run away from this  If @senatemajldr were a wise man, he would march to Nancy's office and draw up the impeachment documents immediately  Call Chief Justice Roberts while you're at it;  let him know
1308963523184267264 2020-09-24 10:56:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AntonLavash @ResistsAj @BruceDuck2 @Maelvampyre @BillKristol Trump hates the generals  He hates the soldiers, unless they're his paid henchmen  I do believe they are drawing up plans and discussing strategies and scenarios, like they always do ... Trump is not beloved by the brass
1308962803512872961 2020-09-24 10:53:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> #BlueWave , mofo
1308958797797285891 2020-09-24 10:37:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Kangaroo Courts, now,  @mattgaetz ?  How creative  Imagine freedom loving Republicans interfering with a public gesture by a private person with private funds  Conservatism is a lie
1308957181123817472 2020-09-24 10:31:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JohnJHarwood There is nothing manly about that ahole - He's a fraud, and not very bright about it  He's made his bed ... He'll get to sleep in it soon
1308955804305776640 2020-09-24 10:25:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Smilan317 I have relatives in Ozarkian Missouri ... I worry about them,  considering most are RWers  Hopefully they choose wisely
1308954762092535808 2020-09-24 10:21:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> OMG   I would be kicking serious ass on Jeopardy tonight  Maybe one day

1308948806424170498 2020-09-24 09:58:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @QuestionMoreAus @MikeDelMoro Really?  Please describe the date, time and location where this was said by ANY Clinton  It would be helpful if you linked to some documented evidence, like a transcript  And when I said ANY Clinton, I mean Hillary, Bill, or ANY of millions of Clintons around the world  Got that?
1308945601246134274 2020-09-24 09:45:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KnowWhatEyeMeme Haha ... Point made  He made his bed
1308944782966824963 2020-09-24 09:42:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Oh hell  A traitorous Putinist incest has taken over our government  THIS is the Deep State being installed  EVERYTHING is a lie  There is no Deep State, but they're gonna install one !
1308943172261814273 2020-09-24 09:35:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Pattihatestrump Maddow is kicking some ass right now, too
1308942906367983616 2020-09-24 09:34:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Why isn't @senatemajldr himself calling for the impeachment of this heathen, undemocratic dullard?  The proverbial albatross is yours to wear, Senator, if you wish that giant anchor dragging you down  Call Nancy, and add Barr to that agenda as well
1308941530783272966 2020-09-24 09:29:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BruceDuck2 @Maelvampyre @BillKristol I believe the joint chiefs will defend the constitution  IF Trump intends to stage a coup against the US Government, then we may not have any other backstop  Sad times we live in ...   I trust Milley
1308939932971401216 2020-09-24 09:22:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KnowWhatEyeMeme You can wear a mask, or you can wear a ventilator  Your choice
1308939114180476928 2020-09-24 09:19:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Well there's one
1308933932771991552 2020-09-24 08:59:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @soledadobrien So they know their clientele are despicable boors  It's his 'people'  Sheeesh ... The extreme cynicism one must indulge to invite the worst by appealing to the worst
1308933282231394304 2020-09-24 08:56:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I know that many liberals and progressives reject any interference by our military, but;  If Trump and the @GOP are willing to abide a right wing coup against our democracy, then we have already reached the point where it's necessary to consider it
1308931448770981890 2020-09-24 08:49:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarianneSmith7 @CathyJoeGPT ACTUAL protesters should ALWAYS point out arsonists in their midst, for the express purpose of making sure BLM is NOT blamed  To not stop arson is to invite chaos .... Arson is extremely dangerous for innocent people and should NOT be tolerated in any way, form or fashion by us
1308930907923980293 2020-09-24 08:47:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarianneSmith7 @CathyJoeGPT You saw this?  Did anybody object?  Were police nearby?  Did protesters inform the police so these incendiaries could be stopped and brought to justice?  I've been protesting most of my adult life, and frankly, I have never believed that committing violence or arson is legitimate
1308930245802840065 2020-09-24 08:44:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DanielleCandela @SenRonJohnson Once Dictator Trump is deposed, the nation will again be free to seek actual justice  That justice might include records of money transfers between Putin cronies and @GOP members  To think this Senator is willing to sell his soul for THIS foul president ... THIS disgusting pig
1308929389233537024 2020-09-24 08:40:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SenRonJohnson Your ass is grass, traitor
1308929112405229568 2020-09-24 08:39:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is the norm for Bernie Voters ...

We are going to stop you  Your support of this criminal will ruin you, and you know it
1308927455541911552 2020-09-24 08:33:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ProjectLincoln The bullshit about mail In ballots being fraudulent needs to be taken down in detail: Explain the process, describe how each ballot is associated with ONE voter, and that the voter gets ONE vote; not many; not several!  ONE voter = One and only one ballot  It's not rocket science
1308926548590854147 2020-09-24 08:29:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is DEFINITELY a subject area for any debates  Biden needs to HAMMER Trump on his crazy statements and assertions ... Ask Trump to explain his comments in detail, and don't let him slide away into Tangentland
1308913704570937344 2020-09-24 07:38:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger I've been thinking we need to know what he and Putin spoke about during their 'summits'  Where are the transcripts?   Why are they hidden?
1308851404681998339 2020-09-24 03:31:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr You are so full of shit  There is ONE PARTY who is destroying America's security,  and it's not Sen Schumer's party  Tell me true,  @senatemajldr  - What was the content of the discussions between Mobster Trump and Dictator Putin?   He destroyed the notes?  Those were OUR notes
1308818045721223168 2020-09-24 01:18:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Not a big McCaskill fan, but she is spot on here
1308786721228648448 2020-09-23 23:14:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Cary_Elwes Exactly what was needed,  Cary   Thanks

1308785936830836741 2020-09-23 23:10:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Another golden Klasfeld courtroom thread...  They are about to start
1308785351377313793 2020-09-23 23:08:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> This is absurd  They are going to completely subvert the process and deny even their own party members their own vote?   @GOP members are all good with this?   The president is going to vote for you, Republicans?   You don't mind?
1308770751621689352 2020-09-23 22:10:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Gee ... I wonder if Hunter used TRUMP ESCORTS INC. ?  Trump, like his ancestors, was a pimp, until that business went belly up
1308762104539656194 2020-09-23 21:36:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I didn't need this one
1308665685984247809 2020-09-23 15:13:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @jaketapper @Earthtenant Well, the good thing is, Republicans are just as likely to forget the secrecy envelope as Democrats  I think it's a wash or pretty damned near
1308588418998267905 2020-09-23 10:06:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill BTW, I have given literally thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates through the 2016-2018-2020 cycles, and continue to support them now; I did learn from Bernie that little dollars from lots of little people makes for large campaign chests; surprisingly large  Trump must go
1308586441069326336 2020-09-23 09:58:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill Bernie has been working DIRECTLY with Biden and other Democrats to help craft a platform, and has certainly supported the candidates,  entreating his supporters to support the ticket  I have strong disagreements with conservative Democrats, but I know who to vote for
1308585656180903936 2020-09-23 09:55:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill I want to be clear that I believe you were targeted, because I definitely believe that Russia GRU is trying to wedge Democrat against Democrat,  using internal rifts to their advantage - they are STILL doing it now, WORSE  NOBODY should be threatened in any way, that's automatic
1308583734686306304 2020-09-23 09:47:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill I WOULD attribute this nasty behavior to those who openly flaunt at already - Right Wing adherents who trade in such threats regularly  Pacifists generally don't issue physical threats, so it would be really out of character for progressives to engage in threatening language
1308582603050512385 2020-09-23 09:42:59 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill I would ask what percentage of these vile creatures were actually bona fide Bernie supporters, and what percentage were botnet objects?   I do not believe that those 30,000+ individuals-families and couples that I joined at Moda Center to listen to Bernie would EVER do this stuff
1308581074864275456 2020-09-23 09:36:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @allisongill I'm a lifelong progressive New Deal Democrat  I'm a Bernie supporter, and a Hillary-Obama-Kerry-Gore-Clinton-Dukakis-Mondale-Carter voter  I believe I represent the norm for Bernie supporters, who are primarily Democrats, and I've never told ANYBODY to vote for 3rd party or Trump
1308569091880361985 2020-09-23 08:49:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr Complete projection   You wrongly accuse Democrats of EVERYTHING you and Trump do yourselves  You aren't getting away with it,  because we're aren't EVER going to stop seeking the truth
1308543898612977665 2020-09-23 07:09:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DianaLashua No  We will have crazy fcuks acting like criminals ... and they will be arrested  IMHO
1308543127041392640 2020-09-23 07:06:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Mr. President   Tell us in great detail how they are hoaxing the ballots  How exactly are they doing that?   Please explain
1308503202342469632 2020-09-23 04:27:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr That's just another lie  EVERYTHING is different - the situation AND your behavior are all different
1308432934831976448 2020-09-22 23:48:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ida_skibenes BTW ... Obamacare was first known as Romneycare   Romney created it for Massachusetts, and Obama liked it, molded it into a consensus and got it passed
1308387864862838784 2020-09-22 20:49:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DTWAGE2020 @TRHLofficial Haha  Using the same math, Trump received 31.492414%  That's less than 32.9%, amirite?  Liars... all a bunch of liars
1308386589366607872 2020-09-22 20:44:06 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TRHLofficial It's a rigged game you are playing  It's NOT a democracy if 60% of the people have to bow down to 40%  Fcuk your republic - it maintains minority rule for the benefit of the minority,  and it does NO good for regular working families  America SHOULD be a democracy,  period!
1308384475638763521 2020-09-22 20:35:42 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger This would explain Newt's attack on Kamala Harris's Catholicism today
1308381840340705280 2020-09-22 20:25:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ChuckGrassley @ChuckGrassley   Trump received less votes than Clinton  The combined Senate GOP also received LESS votes than the combined Senate Democrats  You DID NOT have a mandate to turn our great nation inside out and alter the essential nature of our democracy  This is despicable
1308199823711956992 2020-09-22 08:21:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @renato_mariotti @renato_mariotti ?  Will it be too late to continue the investigation after Inauguration Day?  Justice MUST be sought when it becomes possible to conduct a proper investigation
1308198375662088194 2020-09-22 08:16:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @safopus I have a baptismal ring from my first day of life, some 64 years old ... I don't own much old stuff,  otherwise
1308196450103296001 2020-09-22 08:08:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I think it's fair to say that, over the last decades, the SCOTUS has been purposely slanted AGAINST the opinions of the majority of citizens, and FOR a powerful minority  As opposed to FDR's failed gambit, adding justices would, in this case, better represent majority opinions
1308186651038900224 2020-09-22 07:29:37 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AdamParkhomenko I'm surprised she didn't know about FDR attempting to add court members  She should have known about that   https://t.co/EQyms7Qd2L
1308142814077698048 2020-09-22 04:35:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LauraERamos You guys  Trump voting Bernie supporters are an extremely rare animal - they barely exist  You want to freak yourself out?   Think about the conservative Democrats who are actually VOTING FOR TRUMP  I wonder why tweeters walking around with Billy Clubs aren't bashing RW democrats
1308141151485005824 2020-09-22 04:28:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Sometime during the spring, I started getting text messages from numerous democratic campaigns, requesting donations  At about the same time, I also started getting spam texts ...  I assumed the worst, and still do
1308135610658353152 2020-09-22 04:06:48 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DavidJHouck I engage and force them to accept the fact that they are full of shit and everybody knows it
1308126442425733120 2020-09-22 03:30:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I've been seeing quite a few tweets STOP donating to @AmyMcGrathKY  because she was a few points shy of McConnell's  Folks?  ... that isn't how this works - if someone is telling you to stop supporting Amy, then they are nefarious aholes who might be disrupters  @AmyMcGrathKY
1308086794747957248 2020-09-22 00:52:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> If your want the government to keep killing citizens by the hundreds of thousands ...  Then by all means vote for the @GOP
1308086375648878592 2020-09-22 00:51:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Get these fcukups out of here
1308086163131883520 2020-09-22 00:50:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Haha ...
1308081976914538503 2020-09-22 00:33:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger I would prefer they hold off,  but I'm not holding my breath  I voted for reason, but I expect we'll have to add SCOTUS justices  They pull this shit and expect us to suffer the results?  .. well FU @GOP - you have justified the addition of court members through your skullduggery
1308062269411008512 2020-09-21 23:15:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper Beatles,  of course
1308024841635651584 2020-09-21 20:46:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RadioFreeTom @Morning_Joe I am the Mayor of Simpleton !
1307853758454407168 2020-09-21 09:26:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> A blast from the past, @senatemajldr
1307852923364208642 2020-09-21 09:23:30 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @thekjohnston I always remind them of that one HACK named Ronald Reagan, a former actor who became President   Then I tell them to fcuk off, and they do
1307806097269338112 2020-09-21 06:17:26 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper Abbey Road   Dark Side of the Moon   Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars   Boom!
1307755295045607424 2020-09-21 02:55:33 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Isn't it amazing?   Nearly every White House appointee is NOT an expert in their field  They are instead pliable lackeys who's primary strength is their ability to shield a mobster tyrant from justice  Justice is only delayed
1307679678774145031 2020-09-20 21:55:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> When we vote for our local, state and federal leaders, we do so with the understanding that THEY will work to preserve our democracy AND constitution  At no time did our vote imply that we wanted a fascist, totalitarian state  ALL those who violated our national trust MUST GO!
1307678199728361472 2020-09-20 21:49:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LuvMacyIsabella @CarylHill11 Oh, I'm with you  I've (again) shut down all news media and coming here only rarely....
1307677428651667458 2020-09-20 21:46:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DrDenaGrayson @DragonflyMama7 @CaptMarkKelly I'm a big fan of Captain Kelly,  and a regular contributor  I have 4 on my regular list;  Kelly, McGrath, Harrison and Gideon  GO Dems!
1307507635537600512 2020-09-20 10:31:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr I've been speaking of this  There is no popular mandate for this administration to overturn our national character and throw the whole government to fucking nazis  3,000,000 LESS votes, and yet he rules like a fucking king
1307343358377881600 2020-09-19 23:38:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> And still going strong
1307115348446019584 2020-09-19 08:32:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The doom and gloom is so heavy to bear tonight   All channels to be shut down  One thing to note:   Trump lost the popular vote by 3000000 voters, so he didn't have a popular mandate - the @GOP did not have a mandate to change everything   Yet he's ruled like a King and his court
1307101839129706496 2020-09-19 07:38:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Acosta Oh fuck ... RIP Brave Soul...  She hung on as long as she could ... May her family find solace
1307037487051812864 2020-09-19 03:23:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper I guess we should think of Johann Sebastian Bach as a musician, given that he was perhaps the world's greatest Pipe Organist AND one of it's greatest composers  So yeah, bring ole JS Bach back
1307035249763848195 2020-09-19 03:14:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> BTW   Let's see the money before giving that ahole praise   Promises are useless in Trumpworld - SHOW ME THE MONEY, or you're full of shit
1307011525899464706 2020-09-19 01:40:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Robin_Blue19 Um ... Willis DIED in that movie?   I never finished it - it was too plodding for me
1307010036309266433 2020-09-19 01:34:10 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Another so-called 'general' who Trump also despises?   When you are the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe, and you kicked fascist ass up and down the European theater, then Trump is gonna hate you
1307005922259034112 2020-09-19 01:17:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @gtconway3d Oblivion is the name of the new federal lockup?   Cool
1306979099244601346 2020-09-18 23:31:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The @GOP are assholes   Trump and Kushner are the assholiest of the assholes
1306978110101807106 2020-09-18 23:27:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr ?  Sounds like a plan ... a recipe for success  Once we clear the benches of all the unqualified numbskulls you planted there
1306977578524188673 2020-09-18 23:25:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> ALWAYS read Adam's threads
1306977046552174594 2020-09-18 23:23:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Trump, the @GOP and Putin  ALL working together ...
1306809618878791683 2020-09-18 12:17:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @OnesOther @itchy_bonez @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Oh c'mon; the awful  consequences of democratic socialism!  College degree, good health care, educated citizens creating a vibrant economy from the bottom up ...   Such awful stuff  You haven't actually noted any specific bad things that DS caused  You're just blowing smoke  Bye
1306785135824646144 2020-09-18 10:40:29 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @OnesOther @itchy_bonez @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden I agree with all that,  with one difference  Regulated Capitalism is absolutely necessary; Implementing SEC regulations to  stabilize the market was a critical change for the modern era  What constitutes a 'fair tax' is debatable; I think community college and health care is fair
1306777926948581379 2020-09-18 10:11:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden What constitutional and national security threat?   Explain
1306776870021627910 2020-09-18 10:07:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper Never was a GnR fan  That voice ... omg ... I can tolerate some unique singing styles, but squeaky screechy has never been a strong suit for me  I've never gotten over that voice, to this day
1306775297501454337 2020-09-18 10:01:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @OnesOther @itchy_bonez @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Did you walk on a sidewalk?   Go to school?   Use a library? ... a tunnel or bridge or freeway?   America has been PROGRESSIVE for over a century, yet it's not 'socialism' - the means of production have always been in private hands, and the stock market still creates billionaires
1306773258172211200 2020-09-18 09:53:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @OnesOther @itchy_bonez @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Then we can BUILD THAT WALL!   You will be walled into your own property and a toll booth installed in front of your gate and driveway  NO FREE ACCESS anymore  No pay tax or toll?  NO use road or sidewalk, or bridge or tunnel or ANY other thing you aren't paying for  Capiche?
1306771575589363713 2020-09-18 09:46:36 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @OnesOther @itchy_bonez @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden I would do this  I would place EVERY tax you ever paid into an account  Then, I would tally up a bill for EVERY thing you ever received from us FOR FREE, and pay that bill from that account, and you can keep the rest - no free ride,  dude...  We aren't done yet
1306769212224933888 2020-09-18 09:37:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Blah blah blah ...  Lots of words and claims and assertions that are pure anecdote and speculation - without one single fact to support your contention   "... promote the general welfare ..."  If citizens want a good and just society, they can legislate and pass laws to do that
1306747560728473601 2020-09-18 08:11:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Ok ... I'll bite  Explain how American Progressivism is 'destroying' the Bill of Rights - just saying the words isn't proof  BTW,  Americans have never implemented REAL socialism ...   The New Deal is Keynesian Capitalism; the stock market still racked up trillions in profits
1306703530904809473 2020-09-18 05:16:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden I'm pure American, and I have no reason to leave  I'm loyal to my country AND my constitution, and I'll fight for it!   Also, do note that Scandinavia was last attacked by Nazi Germany  Nazis are YOUR friends, not mine, so; When are you moving to Russia?
1306700446707273729 2020-09-18 05:03:58 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LaSchuler2 @Huizi0 @HawleyMO @JoeBiden Yeah ... just look at Denmark and Norway ... DESTROYED by socialism!   How can they ever survive this awful tragedy?   Oh, wait ....  Um... nevermind
1306686762694012929 2020-09-18 04:09:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ARascallion I'll be blocking yer arse in a moment,  but before I do  Provide documentary evidence that shows, in writing, or a legit media source, that each of those groups actually support Biden  Show evidence  Words are cheap:  Put up, or shut up and sit down  We're done here  Click
1306659897296076801 2020-09-18 02:22:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realTuckFrumper Hey Charlie?   Aren't you supposed to be mowing grandma's lawn?

Trying taking a flying fcuk at a rolling donut, and then tell THEM what you learned   Don't tell me, cause I'm blocking your arse

1306322984706080769 2020-09-17 04:04:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JasonSCampbell Imagine all the energy and resources required to chase down every single Trump supporter; Who's got that in these times of woe and want?  Go after the children, too?  FCUK that, you chase them down; They're YOUR KIDS!!  BTW,  Stop bothering us, I'm ok with never seeing you again

1306249971784540166 2020-09-16 23:13:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @crownme1289 There is no good reason to be in any consensual relationship that doesn't bring you a reasonable level of happiness  No relationship is perfect, and disagreements won't disappear, but learning to resolve them for mutual happiness takes dedicated effort from both, and a safe place
1306231600519155712 2020-09-16 22:00:56 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Lots of info on this thread  6 feet is not enough

1306033824057364480 2020-09-16 08:55:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ProjectLincoln Gross mismanagement of a political campaign  If they were businessmen, they would be filing bankruptcy  Imagine that
1305983742809223168 2020-09-16 05:36:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @glennkirschner2 Let's not let @senatemajldr off the hook, here  He could cobble together a bipartisan caucus and reach across the aisle to end this NOW  If he had ounce of integrity, McConnell would join with Pelosi and impeach, once and for all  This is still his watch in the US Senate
1305982257430056961 2020-09-16 05:30:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @glennkirschner2 Trump doesn't want principled public servants - he wants lickspittles and lackeys  The more criminal you are, the better the fit
1305973877638459394 2020-09-16 04:56:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BenMastaitis @ProjectLincoln Sheldon Adelson had cut him off some time ago ... he didn't like how his money was being spent on lavish perqs for campaign members,  I believe

1305948519501500416 2020-09-16 03:16:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SueEdelman I had a fever nightmare that I stood next to a passing train that stopped next to me and suddenly unloaded a boxcar full of ... ping pong balls... directly on top of me  Millions of them  I have never been so terrified, before or since  Weird, huh?

1305700478462779392 2020-09-15 10:50:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @WalshFreedom @MicheleScott12 I have a feeling that all the NeverTrumpers are going to resuscitate conservativism in some form, whether a new party or a new @GOP  Today is not representative of the future state ....
1305695172689240064 2020-09-15 10:29:22 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LindaMarkss I scream 'FCUK YOU GET THAT SONOVABITCH OFF MY TV SCREEN!!!'  It usually ends with me cursing whatever channel had the audacity to put that face in my home
1305681937185435648 2020-09-15 09:36:46 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The conservative world, QED  Are we done with the conservative view of global climate change and the prominence of fossil fuel interests in the implementation of energy policy?  The cost to the citizens of the world is far too great

1305642999364251648 2020-09-15 07:02:03 +0800 <TrajanGregory> I want to point out to the petroleum-friendly democrats among us that the price we pay on OUR end far exceeds the petty cost of offending petroleum barons   The losses are astronomical is comparison,  and in OUR face,  fcuking up OUR lives and OUR planet...  You aren't helping

1305531437228068864 2020-09-14 23:38:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @benwikler ?  You do realize others will pay to listen to the recording of this event?   It would yield even more donations for @WisDems   Consider this

1305202061823193088 2020-09-14 01:49:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realDonaldTrump Trump begging brown people to vote for him holds a certain, self satisfying irony ....  Trump wouldn't actually 'touch' a Cuban, but what do they know?

The fact that they support the greatest LIAR in world history shows they aren't to be trusted with the truth, period  Show proof, or it's another lie !

1304595913923604481 2020-09-12 09:41:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @northclarctica It's ok to share some sort of evidence that the 'groping video' was faked  A Snopes link will usually do, as they do cover many fake videos  Showing evidence that their assertions are false is absolutely fair; If you're willing to present false evidence, then expect a response

1303737648356360192 2020-09-10 00:50:52 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DawgsWillHunt @DanteAtkins Ok,  let's play  How many 'leftists' are not voting for Biden  Please give us accurate numbers and the source for that data  You obviously know that 'many' leftists are going to refuse to vote for Biden - Let's see what you know  Show us
1303736723302543360 2020-09-10 00:47:11 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DawgsWillHunt @DanteAtkins Our opposition is the Republican party and those who support them  Flailing away at 'leftists' seems a bit off target ...  The absolutely MINUSCULE numbers of misguided 'leftists' provides a very small target for your angst

1303021126524649472 2020-09-08 01:23:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mattgaetz Coordinating your disinformation with Putin's GRU in our national election is shameful and makes you and anybody else who uses it a traitor ...  The @GOP is done - The new Whigs on the block  Welcome to the Political Wilderness
1303012658652655621 2020-09-08 00:50:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @realDonaldTrump You aren't getting high marks   You're just getting high
1303011697142018048 2020-09-08 00:46:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @BillKristol IN CONCERT with Russia GRU ....
1303011431021858817 2020-09-08 00:45:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump This doesn't erase what we know to be fact  There is nothing too low for you, is there ?
1303011038405693440 2020-09-08 00:43:34 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ProjectLincoln Surprising ? ... Hardly  Check Trump's personal accounts .... Yeah - There it is
1302749255459729408 2020-09-07 07:23:21 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @HamillHimself More like hacking

1302677074310647809 2020-09-07 02:36:31 +0800 <TrajanGregory> An interesting tidbit   https://t.co/4L3dxioOc0

1302671722643030016 2020-09-07 02:15:15 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Pattihatestrump Well that's good to hear ....   We'll be dropping off our ballots at a Blue Ballot Box at a local library branch .... We can also drop them off a the registrar's office, if necessary, but Oregon had this mail in ballot thing solved years ago ...
1302670306222338048 2020-09-07 02:09:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ImJohnEli They also need insight - the payments are offered in bad faith  I know people need the money, and I hope they get it (They wont), but that's beside the point - The GOP is a malevolent player in our nation and money or trinkets isn't going to change that fact
1302669256375414784 2020-09-07 02:05:27 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Pattihatestrump What is your situation going to be, Patti?  Are you moving out of state? ... That might complicate your voting plans  Does Arizona have dedicated ballot drop boxes in town?  How does Arizona deal with absentee/mail in ballots?  I live in Oregon and everybody is mail in
1302668299935690752 2020-09-07 02:01:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ImJohnEli So, they are gonna act like Democrats to win?  I'm guessing that isn't going to work

1302528819023106056 2020-09-06 16:47:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @McFaul Somebody point me to the law book that outlines the crime of 'serious subversion of a democratically elected official'

1302444851158425600 2020-09-06 11:13:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ZoeBoston2 You are fcuking gorgeous!   It's hard to beat depression, but I do know you can find a path to general happiness, which is all we can hope for in a harsh world  Try switching off the news media and giving yourself some space away from the stresses of today - it's not your fault
1302441168416858114 2020-09-06 10:59:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @RichardGrenell WTF are you?    12 years old?   Get these children OUT of our White House!   November 3rd looms large ...

1302420855918440449 2020-09-06 09:38:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson Sounds like the classic missing drain plug ... scaled up by the trump idiot factor
1302412028544315392 2020-09-06 09:03:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @benjaminwittes It's a quirky, light hearted fable, directed with love by @robreiner   Don't miss it
1302403804676026371 2020-09-06 08:30:39 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Exactly ... it's as if Trump and Russia GRU are operating in tandem.... as if they were in coordination ...  Because they are?
1302402268440883200 2020-09-06 08:24:32 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @sandypriester @DWUhlfelderLaw @rainmann251 Exactly what I was thinking  This clip, however, is from Portland OR one month ago
1302265754390155264 2020-09-05 23:22:05 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Don't forget - These were dedicated Americans AND Allies, working together to defeat fascism  This is what decent nations do  They don't embrace fascist dictators and fascist tactics

1302263569971470336 2020-09-05 23:13:24 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The truth is: We would probably do better to KEEP him on the golf course, and away from everything else
1302262779789762560 2020-09-05 23:10:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> How awesome is this? very

1302260421433335810 2020-09-05 23:00:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SweetSavory10 Clickbait  They keep changing the ads on the webpage every time you hit the button, so they can rack up ad revenues  Hence the name 'clickbait'  Block this crap

1302255101327761413 2020-09-05 22:39:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's a heavy load to bear  Unburden your souls, @GOP   STOP propping up this ignorant sleaze, and dishonoring your own legacies ... There will be no easy ending for you  If you knew he was committing crimes and refused to do anything to stop it - You will have to answer for that
1302247648481570816 2020-09-05 22:10:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Look, buddy  We all know the truth ... This is still America and we WILL get the truth; about you, about Trump, about EVERY @GOP sycophant who let this crime boss run rampant in our precious democracy  You've made a big mistake, and the black mark on your honor will never go away

1301988188219555840 2020-09-05 04:59:08 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @FPWellman @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump Quite the opposite of Trump, who lied about his feet, that moment

1301909215758282752 2020-09-04 23:45:19 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @AhmedBaba_ @WHDueDiligence More like UNflipping the script  Mad King Donald's claim that the current unrest will occur if Biden is elected is plainly ridiculous and fallacious  Biden sets the record straight ... It's what he needs to do
1301901083237777409 2020-09-04 23:13:01 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @kathrynw5 FCUK his supporters - They are lost  We've heard him saying this stuff ourselves  He has shown disrespect to a number of Gold Star Families ... The statements about McCain were widely available and we all heard what Trump said FROM HIS MOUTH  This is completely on brand for him
1301872804715929600 2020-09-04 21:20:38 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The stench of dishonor and criminality surrounds and permeates the entire @GOP   This is a party that needs to dissipate into thin air,  and go the way of the Whigs and Know Nothings - total political extinction  Lindsey was right: Trump has destroyed them
1301711359575379969 2020-09-04 10:39:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Pride in the military is the life's blood of many conservatives, marking the proudest, most significant part of their own history  This is going up leave a mark
1301710091113041928 2020-09-04 10:34:04 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @mmpadellan This administration is beyond absurd ... this crazy fcuk has no business being at the levers of power  Who the FCUK thinks this like this?      Is this from his father?   Did ALL his male ancestors reject military honor?  Is POTUS subject to military justice under UCMJ as CIC?

1301659448264388608 2020-09-04 07:12:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson I suspect Democracy will require their assistance ...  People don't like to hear it, but our military might be the last remaining backstop to the Mad King   Getting so tired of Trump's nonsense ...
1301656518945693696 2020-09-04 07:01:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @gtconway3d He is an evil coward  I'm still heartbroken for the fate of the Kurds ... I still cannot believe someone so ignorant, callous and inconsiderate could become our president ...  There is much to fix in America - this should never happen again

1301595138221699072 2020-09-04 02:57:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @CNN Yes ... he 'appeared' to commit election fraud  He 'appeared' on a street in America and 'appeared' on your camera and your CNN studio,  then he 'appeared' on our tv screens, saying words  Did you falsify his words?   Then he not only 'appeared' to say it, but ACTUALLY said it
1301562013064114176 2020-09-04 00:45:40 +0800 <TrajanGregory> My recommendation  STOP listening to conservatives for health issues  They don't know WTF they speak of and cannot be trusted with medical information
1301561553838198784 2020-09-04 00:43:50 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Brett McGurk is a highly competent military expert who knows what lurks behind the fake facades... a dishonorable CiC who does NOT garner respect by the rank and file or the leadership  Follow Brett for sanity
1301560306976481280 2020-09-04 00:38:53 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @karebear0517 Absolutely yes  Cancel culture?  ... fuck that : freedom of choice  The marketplace is bigger than mere assets - it's about ideas  I vote your shitty idea down by not rewarding you for it  Don't like it?  ... tough titty  Be better or lose

1301504908311494658 2020-09-03 20:58:45 +0800 <TrajanGregory> All true  "She accused Trump of betraying conservative values by undermining the rule of law and national security, lying, dividing Americans along racial lines, and failing the country in his response to the coronavirus pandemic."
1301501727548387329 2020-09-03 20:46:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> To this day, I think of Trump cutting the Kurds loose, and profound anger rises up  Abandoning our allies after they made the contributions WE requested of them, and to do so without a thought to their safety  This just makes me seethe: How dare he?  He lost the military that day
1301499744498282502 2020-09-03 20:38:14 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @TheRickWilson It's as if some in the Twitter organization feel a need to assist the president's campaign  And the rubles keep flowing in ...
1301499116652883970 2020-09-03 20:35:44 +0800 <TrajanGregory> It's important to note,  as @maddow described last night, that the president's campaign rhetoric matches and correlates with Putin's IRA deza   Putin and Trump, working together, to promote a false story ...  Hand in hand ...  Our president is a fcuking traitor

1301012251860594688 2020-09-02 12:21:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @NWPinPDX I'm in the NW 23rd area  We have not seen a single protester, two or more policemen  in a group, or far right counterprotesters  We go to work, shop at TJs or Freddies, eat an occasional slice at Escape, and stay home.  It's been rather tranquil and fire-free on this side of town
1300956066155384833 2020-09-02 08:37:51 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Sam6869 @MollyMcKew @JohnBerman My son is watching some Anime toons - I'll have to catch the replay  Thanks
1300955244650663937 2020-09-02 08:34:35 +0800 <TrajanGregory> The Red Eye to Moscow  Today's @GOP
1300954197601386496 2020-09-02 08:30:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MollyMcKew @JohnBerman Which CNN show ?
1300953563254800384 2020-09-02 08:27:54 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @jadedcreative Sculpt - Paint - Draw  Go to an arts supply store and spend some money   Dust off that piano and get it tuned ...   I got ideas
1300952633100783616 2020-09-02 08:24:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @JRubinBlogger Haha
1300952338203508736 2020-09-02 08:23:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @senatemajldr Some serious damage control, eh?  The 180,000 horses have already left the barn  If you run REALLY fast ... er ... nevermind  BTW - Is that a Hoax Proof mask? .... You know those Democrats, dreaming up hoaxes is the dark shadows  Now go drink your bleach, like the Chosen One said
1300951058043342848 2020-09-02 08:17:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @barbvas So sorry for you and your family  May you find peace in the sweet memories of days past
1300943605456973824 2020-09-02 07:48:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @SaraGideon
1300943066291818496 2020-09-02 07:46:12 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @joshscampbell Wow, you're lucky  There was a massacre here in Bowling Green ... A stone's throw from the Revolutionary War Airport  You want Antifa?  I got yer Antifa right here!  https://t.co/nttjSjfiCw
1300939816025034753 2020-09-02 07:33:17 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump The dislocation, hardship and homelessness this will cause with be profound ... perhaps the worse depression of our history  These people don't think beyond their fucking bank accounts  If seniors have no money, they won't spend money, and stores won't book revenues OR profits
1300933713321054208 2020-09-02 07:09:02 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @KathleenHBeach We have leaders in the military who are not going to let Putin win ... They won't let Trump, a dangerous, fully-fledged ANTI-Democracy advocate; they won't let him deny the election and try to keep power  It's my personal opinion that the Joint Chiefs will intervene
1300912771463172096 2020-09-02 05:45:49 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @tedcruz This PolitiFact article has something to say about your tweet, Rafael...  we can all read it, then read your tweet, then laugh like hell, because you're nothing but a Putin Ass Licker, like the rest of the @GOP    https://t.co/9hk1mHkExi
1300887505256890368 2020-09-02 04:05:25 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Boy they are heaping the crazy in tall stacks these days
1300880722715000832 2020-09-02 03:38:28 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @McPhoto55 You've paid into that fund your entire work-life ... you should get what you put into it, at least
1300868054713155590 2020-09-02 02:48:07 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ChuckCallesto Who's going to break it to him?
1300854632952987649 2020-09-02 01:54:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MollyJongFast It is a bit cool and gray ... but will be a glorious afternoon
1300853732792389632 2020-09-02 01:51:13 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @MojackMarine @ThatEricAlper Sweet piece....
1300834496715997186 2020-09-02 00:34:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @Brasilmagic McMaster has been present in media  Kelly and Mattis rarely talk in public
1300808420182732800 2020-09-01 22:51:09 +0800 <TrajanGregory> MORE Adam Klasfeld- MORE courtroom drama
1300767949821681664 2020-09-01 20:10:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> No, your honor  Not just irreparable harm - QUINTESSENTIAL irreparable harm  "Is there any other kind?"  @robreiner
1300767306956435458 2020-09-01 20:07:47 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ida_skibenes Very nice !  Reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest in the states - Cool, green and wet
1300758784982224896 2020-09-01 19:33:55 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @ThatEricAlper Oingo Boingo - Dia De Las Muertas  Full of monsters and ghouls ... I miss that shirt, which I am quite sure my wife intentionally tossed out
1300757623331942405 2020-09-01 19:29:18 +0800 <TrajanGregory> @amandacarpenter @MrWednesday11 You are so right  The projection is so pervasive and 'in front' - It's become pathological  He does the same with the mobster comments; He's projecting his own long standing association with that world - It's how he thinks and it's how he talks  He can't escape his evil worldview
1300649903454994433 2020-09-01 12:21:16 +0800 <TrajanGregory> More Dark Arts by the Ghouls of Pennsylvania Avenue
1300594207376072705 2020-09-01 08:39:57 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Wow ... Fascinating story from Portland ...
1300588517148389377 2020-09-01 08:17:20 +0800 <TrajanGregory> Like Trump and like Kushner and like Mitchie and like Lindsey and like McCarthy - Scott Atlas is NOT a doctor and Scott Atlas is NOT an epidemiological scientist  NONE OF THEM have the scientific authority to make the call on the proper course of action to deal with this pandemic
