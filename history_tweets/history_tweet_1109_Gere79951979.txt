1343735741747240966 2020-12-29 09:49:00 +0800 <Gere79951979> @JulieBrexitdone @MichaelYeadon3 Only  you can make that decision for your Mother.  Do your research &amp; be informed.
1343721631370375169 2020-12-29 08:52:56 +0800 <Gere79951979> @NIAMHBL Exactly &amp; none of us were given the chance to open fully.  Thought it was lousy opening Hospitality for a couple of weeks at Xmas &amp; closing them down quickly.  Cost more than was made.
1343712041421438978 2020-12-29 08:14:50 +0800 <Gere79951979> I have never seen anyone wipe the pump handles at the petrol stations, but if you go for a meal, hairdresser, gyms etc, the seats &amp; tables all have to be sterilized after use.
1343646197454667777 2020-12-29 03:53:11 +0800 <Gere79951979> @NIAMHBL Had a quiet one too.  Missed the crack, but was great to spend time with the grown up kids (they will always be kids).  Santa came too.
1343630149074485256 2020-12-29 02:49:25 +0800 <Gere79951979> @SibhHean @Allycon3 Yes Siobhàn, you are right there.  People that have worked for years to build their business.  All to stop the HSE getting overwhelmed, because those in charge havent a clue what they are doing.
1343628316343992320 2020-12-29 02:42:08 +0800 <Gere79951979> @NIAMHBL Hope you had a good Xmas Niamh

1343572539877052418 2020-12-28 23:00:30 +0800 <Gere79951979> Hospitality has been more or less closed for the past 9 months.  If you have been working &amp; getting paid through the pandemic, you are not in a position to lecture anyone on anything to do with lockdowns, masks &amp; vaccines.
1343571484275572736 2020-12-28 22:56:18 +0800 <Gere79951979> @MichealMartinTD @CMOIreland @LeoVaradkar Are we or are we not in level 5 lockdown.  Is it just the Hospitality industry &amp; hairdressers that are not allowed to make a living.  Everyone else seems to be able to work &amp; open their business.

1341504145065455619 2020-12-23 06:01:26 +0800 <Gere79951979> @mmcgrathtd Afraid you need to provide economical support quickly.  Where is the light at the end of the tunnel.  Waiting 9 months for that.  Xmas enjoyable? you are having a laugh.

1341462303447818241 2020-12-23 03:15:10 +0800 <Gere79951979> @NIAMHBL Same here, except it is on the angry side. @MichealMartinTD @CMOIreland need to admit they do not know what they are doing.  Going around in circles.

1341380164362641408 2020-12-22 21:48:47 +0800 <Gere79951979> Well said Thomas.  Enough is enough now at this stage.  The only ones calling for a lockdown is the ones that it does not affect.  All in this together my a**

1341311714109902850 2020-12-22 17:16:47 +0800 <Gere79951979> There is no evidence that lockdowns have reduced mortality from Covid-19. Research is now revealing the devastation that lockdowns are causing. In these draconian lockdown policies, we have  seen the biggest infringement on civil liberties in democratic countries during peacetime
1341311033630191619 2020-12-22 17:14:05 +0800 <Gere79951979> For decades, it has been acknowledged by the world’s premier health authorities that amid a pandemic, the functioning of society should be maintained, and human rights upheld

1331038397159321601 2020-11-24 08:54:18 +0800 <Gere79951979> Shitty little grant coming from the councils to keep the pubs closed for Xmas, so people will think we are grand.  We still haven't got the CRSS from the Revenue that was promised last September.

Keep to the pubs own town/city at the same time until they sort this out.  People will get pissed off if they cannot travel if main road is blocked. Gov will have to sort it out.

1330896666375954432 2020-11-23 23:31:06 +0800 <Gere79951979> @Ckpainters69 Working on it Colin.  They will open restaurants, but not traditional pubs, which seems to be called wet pubs now a days, by #NPHET who have a vested interest in keeping them closed.
1330895677824655361 2020-11-23 23:27:11 +0800 <Gere79951979> @redlad27 @MichealMartinTD @DonnellyStephen @SimonHarrisTD @CMOIreland @LeoVaradkar @VFIpubs If you bring them to court it would cost a fortune.  If they bring you to court, it is up to them to prove they were right.  Considering infections from pubs were 0.28%, good luck to them with that.
1330893564096679938 2020-11-23 23:18:47 +0800 <Gere79951979> Has the government brought any pub in Ireland to court yet for breaking the rules.  No they have not.  Why?  Because they have not a leg to stand on.  Open your pubs.  You will be threatened but there is not anything they can do.
1330675645085589506 2020-11-23 08:52:51 +0800 <Gere79951979> @JimIreland12 We have becoming a Muslim country.  Face masks, no alcohol. No enjoyment (unless you are a man).  Look at #NPHET @MichealMartinTD All men making the decisions.  Yep, it happened faster than we thought.

1330594656250437632 2020-11-23 03:31:01 +0800 <Gere79951979> @JimIreland12 That is like the sickness bug they have in the hospitals every year.  Have you seen the dirt &amp; grubbiness of some of the hospitals, mainly because no money is been put into them, so where is the money going.
1330525005134917632 2020-11-22 22:54:15 +0800 <Gere79951979> @Maximil86429959 @irishinmanches1 @gerrywebster Exactly, always trying to be teachers pets.  Funny how they only ever copy the bad things.

1327984440103067650 2020-11-15 22:38:57 +0800 <Gere79951979> @robertburke84 Bet they didnt arrest anyone from BLM
1327982828219473920 2020-11-15 22:32:33 +0800 <Gere79951979> I agree with you, I am just trying to highlight this as best I can.  There is a new health group, led by Dr Jim MC Daid &amp; Professor Jack Lambert calling for #NPHET to be disbanded as they are fixated on Covid only.
1327971329912475649 2020-11-15 21:46:52 +0800 <Gere79951979> @bam57581565 @agentofhonesty @hedleyfarquhar @stufy21 @conoroc1979 Your better off as there is nothing there to see except a load of ass licking.
1327970887392505858 2020-11-15 21:45:06 +0800 <Gere79951979> That is more or less what they have said.  Disrespectful on all accounts.
1327970371031736320 2020-11-15 21:43:03 +0800 <Gere79951979> And taxes are certainly going to rise.  They are bad enough as it is, no one will be able to afford to buy a home or have kids if this continues.
1327969839521148928 2020-11-15 21:40:56 +0800 <Gere79951979> You are correct Gerard.  There is so many highly educated people that had to leave the country to find employment as they were not in the golden set.
1327969523157377025 2020-11-15 21:39:41 +0800 <Gere79951979> I would think that that is the only option for most people to get things back to normal.  Of course there will be situations where you have to get tested like hospital visits, but otherwise no one should bother.
1327968980066295810 2020-11-15 21:37:31 +0800 <Gere79951979> That is true Gerard.  When you see a government giving themselves a rise each year &amp; yet tell the pensioners they cannot have there measley €5 rise, you know there is something rotten in the state of Ireland. Thanks
1327968579757748224 2020-11-15 21:35:56 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thank you so much Pat &amp; everyone out there.  This means so much to us all.
1327944301762981891 2020-11-15 19:59:28 +0800 <Gere79951979> @reggaecrisp1 Thanks for your support Chris, &amp; you are absolutely correct.
1327943016196280320 2020-11-15 19:54:21 +0800 <Gere79951979> That is correct.  Have been researching both sides.  Even the scientific side that are not allowed a voice.  Legals in family who are helping, but at the moment their hands are tied.  Waiting in the long grass for now
1327941351464427521 2020-11-15 19:47:44 +0800 <Gere79951979> That is a fair point to make.  People do not realise that taxes will have to rise to pay for their blunders.  At this stage I would not be surprised if they put a tax on going from one county to another.
1327940371729567744 2020-11-15 19:43:51 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks Troy.  I am afraid at the moment we haven't the money to do it, but it is something that is coming down the line.  It is not even about the money, it is the playing on our mental health that is the main problem.
1327939705321697283 2020-11-15 19:41:12 +0800 <Gere79951979> Well said Niamh.  We got nothing from them in financial packages since September &amp; that only paid a bit of rent &amp; mortgages. CRSS not up &amp; running yet.  They have treated us disgraceful.  @MichealMartinTD
1327798376755302401 2020-11-15 10:19:36 +0800 <Gere79951979> Well said Lorcan.  We have been closed to save lives??, but for us publicans we might as well be dead with the lives we have are been forced to live.  It is not living.  I think we have done our bit for society.  Time to move forward.
1327796252411629568 2020-11-15 10:11:10 +0800 <Gere79951979> They have more or less said that.  The government &amp; NPHET  have had long enough to sort this out, but seems incapable of doing so.  In my opinion, I dont think they are too interested as it suits them just fine the way things are.
1327788490633965570 2020-11-15 09:40:19 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks.  It is a very sad situation.  The rules make no sense at all.
1327787879582593026 2020-11-15 09:37:54 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks Laura for your support.  I think the Government &amp; NPHET should be made to declare any interests they have or any profit they or their families have made out of anything related to this so called virus
1327787028759580672 2020-11-15 09:34:31 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thank you &amp; every one very much for all your support.  You have all shown me that I am not alone.  I hope others out there who are in the same situation can take comfort in that.
1327781475131994113 2020-11-15 09:12:27 +0800 <Gere79951979> The media are gutless
1327779687679078400 2020-11-15 09:05:21 +0800 <Gere79951979> It is the smugness of their faces that really gets to us.  The media also should be very ashamed of themselves.
1327779136128114688 2020-11-15 09:03:09 +0800 <Gere79951979> My children are all grown up &amp; working away from home.  I haven't seen them in months &amp; I really really miss them.  I need my customers more than they need me to be honest.  Thank you for your support.  I and others appreciate it
1327778351172493312 2020-11-15 09:00:02 +0800 <Gere79951979> Exactly Karen.  They are running around like headless chickens (turkeys are for Christmas).  They need to make hard decisions that includes all sections of society in a fair &amp; just manner, not just us pubs.  Thanks for your support.
1327777359450271749 2020-11-15 08:56:06 +0800 <Gere79951979> That is why sent my tweet.  I cannot sit back any longer.  I love my pub &amp; the customers that come in to it.  It is like not been allowed to see your family.
1327776693625507840 2020-11-15 08:53:27 +0800 <Gere79951979> Exactly, Esther.  They are trying to divide us all so we will do as we are told.
1327776205534339074 2020-11-15 08:51:30 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks for your support.
1327776072142876673 2020-11-15 08:50:59 +0800 <Gere79951979> We know NPHET is running the country.  The government is so afraid to make a decision that it is easier to let NPHET make them for now &amp; then blame it all on NPHET when it collapses.  I am sure they will be well looked after.
1327772339354951681 2020-11-15 08:36:09 +0800 <Gere79951979> Imagine Esther those with a big mortgage/rent, be it a pub, hotel, restaurant, gym, hairdressers, etc &amp; also the employees.  There is a large section of society that have been cut off.  We all need help.  Thank you so much for your support.
1327768603731648518 2020-11-15 08:21:18 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks Andy.  I think most people have enough of this nonsense.  People need to man up &amp; fight, not just for their own rights, but for everyone else as well. That is what I am trying to do here.  I am so grateful to everyone that is retweeting.
1327766865301663744 2020-11-15 08:14:24 +0800 <Gere79951979> I fully agree with you Lucy.  This I hope is just the start.  It has been a very hard year on the sector but on our mental health more than anything else.  Thank you for your support.
1327765044332027905 2020-11-15 08:07:09 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thank you Andy for your help.  We are desperate here.  Our rights have been taken away from us. Governments should not be allowed independent advisors. They always have agendas. That is what civil servants are for.
1327762693114236934 2020-11-15 07:57:49 +0800 <Gere79951979> @Sabdublindr Thanks Sabrina.  Chin up.  I know it is not just publicans that are affected. There is a vast amount of trades attached to each other in the hospitality sector.  Lets all fight this together.
1327759324467372035 2020-11-15 07:44:26 +0800 <Gere79951979> I have been told that if it went to court, the Judge would tell me I was right, but would have to err on the side of caution because of the virus. They will not go against the government at this time.  Thanks again for your help.
1327758605798567941 2020-11-15 07:41:34 +0800 <Gere79951979> Thanks for your support Karen.  We do know that the tests cannot pick up the Covid virus, but this government will not listen to any other experts opinion.  In a democracy there always has to be at least 2 sides.  Thanks again.
1327755164435042305 2020-11-15 07:27:54 +0800 <Gere79951979> Unfortunately we would be breaking the law as it stands if we open.  Yes, we have a constitutional right to work, but as you know sections of society still believe in the virus so we would have little support.  Thanks a million for your support
1327754383782768640 2020-11-15 07:24:48 +0800 <Gere79951979> Publicans really need to stick together on this.  It will not do any of us any good to fight among ourselves.  Thank you for your help
1327752653837914114 2020-11-15 07:17:55 +0800 <Gere79951979> @SaraHaboubi1 Unfortunately while that is correct, we also hold a license &amp; that is how they are trying to control us.  The guards can come in &amp; shut us down.  The legal fight I am told is for another day. Thanks for your help.
1327749374005424128 2020-11-15 07:04:53 +0800 <Gere79951979> @ih8evrybdy @RichardOClear1 Publicans are normally docile people &amp; prefer the quiet life with no fuss, but for the sake of all our mental health I am not going to let this lie.  I have had enough.  Thanks for your support.
1327747785815453698 2020-11-15 06:58:35 +0800 <Gere79951979> @RichardOClear1 @ih8evrybdy Hi Richard.  Their hands are tied legal wise for the moment, but I am told that that will change.  They do need to get the pubs together though &amp; fight this on the streets.
1327747278434603008 2020-11-15 06:56:34 +0800 <Gere79951979> @CabbagePickler I do not thing they would be welcome in any pub at this stage, but they are lucky enough to have their own bar. They are so thick skinned at this stage, it is like speaking to a brick wall.
1327746210984325120 2020-11-15 06:52:19 +0800 <Gere79951979> @ih8evrybdy Thanks.  All we want to do is make a living, but a lot of us have not been open since March.  They are affecting our mental health especially with this will we, wont we attitude &amp; the smirks really get to me
1327744420830179330 2020-11-15 06:45:12 +0800 <Gere79951979> I am a Publican.  All I want to do is work. #Fiannafail #finegael #NPHET are ruining all Publicans lives/their ental health with the disrespect they have shown us &amp; our trade.  They have divide us from the rest of society.  Please retweet. Thank you.
1327686283926392833 2020-11-15 02:54:11 +0800 <Gere79951979> @TraceyOMahony81 @foinseach Thanks Tracey for all the time/work you are putting into this.  You are always giving us great advice. It is a relief to know that there is someone out there trying to get to the truth.
1327645433494171653 2020-11-15 00:11:52 +0800 <Gere79951979> @MichealMartinTD @CMOIreland This is what they done years ago to different sections of society.  If you were a single parent, poor, had a handicap. They know they will have to answer for their actions down the line.

Closed since early October, CRSS scheme have not paid out yet. Top of the class for anyone that can guess how the publicans are paying bills

1327581539052498945 2020-11-14 19:57:58 +0800 <Gere79951979> Science is being suppressed for political and financial gain. Covid-19 has unleashed state corruption on a grand scale, and it is harmful to public health.  So this is why no opposition view is allowed.  All Politicians/media are to blame for the cover up.

1327239127834779648 2020-11-13 21:17:21 +0800 <Gere79951979> Listening to @MichealMartinTD on News at 1, Publicans do not be under any illusion that the pubs will be open for Christmas.  He stated that they have concern for the spread of the virus in that sector. Closed for 8 months, imagine, still concerned. Madness.
