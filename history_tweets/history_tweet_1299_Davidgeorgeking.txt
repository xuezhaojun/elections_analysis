1343968966734184449 2020-12-30 01:15:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We still do!
1343968008595759105 2020-12-30 01:11:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> What a strange question. If I tell you the year you will know my age because this is how we measure our lives, by birthdays plus years lived!
1343300309951672321 2020-12-28 04:58:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You lot will have us digging ditches with a spade and ploughing the fields with horse and single plough next - Didn't anyone ever teach you you can't go back in time only forward!
1342874206753746948 2020-12-27 00:45:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Fake!
1342873663717175296 2020-12-27 00:43:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> His Christianity is 'like Teressa May's - All for show. Like cheap champaign - All fizz and no flavour. True Christianity is the full-bodied new wine.
1342856296526180353 2020-12-26 23:34:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> how right you are!
1342430765221556225 2020-12-25 19:23:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This (persecution and condemnation) are always levelled at anyone who dares to suggest there is another kinder, better, more equal and righteous was to organise the structure of power and the distribution of wealth. Thus will it always be - but we must keep trying to bring change
1340749862166519810 2020-12-21 04:04:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> more like 'Sinking-Ship!'
1340749127597117440 2020-12-21 04:01:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Grinch!
1340739696746504196 2020-12-21 03:23:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That is all very well and good - but after a reinstall, My Grammarly is (among other issues) playing up - It won't work with Microsoft OneDrive - it's not checking any of my Word (or other) saved documents 'For Technical reasons!' what? It did before the reinstall!
1340269781866430465 2020-12-19 20:16:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There are a lot of people in the UK who are 'Seasonal Christians' they talk as though they have a sort of Christian Religion at Christmas &amp; perhaps easter but never mention Christianity (or practice any of the faith) at any other time. Being British doesn't make one a Christian
1339875599968468992 2020-12-18 18:10:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just saw this thread from yesterday - Is there any news about the trike? I never understand why anyone would steal from others especially something that is clearly a specialised piece of equipment. I hope it is (or has been) found and restored to Tali
1339287861472989187 2020-12-17 03:14:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am sure this isn't a one-age-group-issue. Like every sweeping statement, yours is wrong. (and rather agist)
1339259910622687232 2020-12-17 01:23:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Do you use wood pellets in the cat litter tray - Heres how we do it. We put enough woodchip in the tray for the cat to cover, we use a slotted scoop to remove solids, we flush these. Then ditch or compost the wet (spent) woodchip. Cuts the cost and its cleaner no smells either.
1339219691592683521 2020-12-16 22:43:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I detest window cleaning!
1338924593776635913 2020-12-16 03:11:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I left home at 15 and a half - to join the Royal Navy.
1338481968015683585 2020-12-14 21:52:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am amazed that it has taken this long for people to come to this conclusion. Tories were Pirates from their creation and have been asset-stripping Britain for centuries.
1338231973605728264 2020-12-14 05:19:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I was there when we monitored the (Russian) fishing boats they were fishing for intelligence. I was in the RN 1970. This government has caused deaths of refugees by preventing them from coming to Britain, no turning on foreign fishermen who bought the right to fish British waters
1338230429455953920 2020-12-14 05:12:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> These pictures have been showing up on Twitter for years - Yemen isn't just inching toward famine it arrived and many have already died! Sadly!
1338229944065908740 2020-12-14 05:10:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> True - but this is different - Tories are negotiating with a gun in both bloody hands!
1338229231634051075 2020-12-14 05:08:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Absolutely - My most recent foster son is staying on after 18 - for as long as he wants!  Fostercarer putting his money where his mouth is!
1338203321241391111 2020-12-14 03:25:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't use (or even own) a mobile phone!
1338202630393384966 2020-12-14 03:22:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> When this happens at home we always tell the person to try to get to the loo quicker in future - I don't know "peeing (Peaing) on the floor at your age?"
1338200802712809473 2020-12-14 03:15:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I felt exactly the same thing, Andrew!
1338200396536360960 2020-12-14 03:13:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It isn't (yet) another political Party - so there is no reason for Labour MPs to avoid joining this initiative. Whether any current Labour MPs are brave enough to join is another question.
1338199685513797635 2020-12-14 03:10:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No! but it has made me more determined to be a better Socialist and anti-Tory campaigner!
1338168418659430406 2020-12-14 01:06:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Check out "Jeremy Corbyn's Project for Peace and Justice: LIVE LAUNCH"  https://t.co/eG4GsDEDuo @EventbriteUK I just joined!
1338165844392763395 2020-12-14 00:56:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I will be signing up to this project. Isn't it typical of this country that a lot of comments have been negative - I have high hopes for the future!
1338087993115086850 2020-12-13 19:46:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Still fighting to oust the Tories.
1337734063256432640 2020-12-12 20:20:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Democracy?
1337714237049884672 2020-12-12 19:01:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Oh yes!
1337378773507993601 2020-12-11 20:48:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Still rightwinging it!
1337377762189991937 2020-12-11 20:44:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Money doesn't buy happiness but it paves the way to climb the ladder of success!

1337089286475309056 2020-12-11 01:38:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No child should ever be homeless, hungry, unsafe or without proper support. I do not blame Local Authorities or agencies for failures in child care. I blame the Tory Party. They have not listened to professionals in the field. This isn't the only profession that has been ignored
1337006777347567619 2020-12-10 20:10:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The TORY PARTY still trying to convince us that 'Trickle-down' works when what they are demonstrating is how efficient their 'Dyson Effect' is (Sucking the last dregs from the poor!)
1335679757430759430 2020-12-07 04:17:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> you won't get any antagonism from me. I wholeheartedly agree with you!
1335321556042592261 2020-12-06 04:34:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The International Community must surely condemn this arson attempt, this vandalism of a worldwide treasure like this?
1335320587149959168 2020-12-06 04:30:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Post-truth era The post-Labour era!  Oh for a time when Britain moves into the Post Tory Epoch!
1335319743482486784 2020-12-06 04:26:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> As in a lot of situations, his solution is worse than the original problem.
1335318565008924673 2020-12-06 04:22:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The dish containing the nicest food!
1335317732544405504 2020-12-06 04:18:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My neighbour has honorary second ownership of one of my cats. Midnight goes into his house to curl up with their cat for part of most days, they usually share a meal together too. it's a good thing my neighbours love him as much as we do!
1334242620525207555 2020-12-03 05:06:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I would add this: We are a nation that is led by Lias &amp; far too many people are forced to lie to get the help they need to live.
1334241634251386882 2020-12-03 05:02:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @wrenasaurus Breakfast.  Dinner. Supper.   Why not First-meal, second-meal &amp; third-meal?
1334240695507423232 2020-12-03 04:59:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've learned that healthy relationships promote a healthy mind and this helps to promote a healthy body. I have also learned that unhealthy relationships (Toxic relationships) undermine self-confidence and erode positive attitudes in me. I chose healthy relationships every time
1334236655100841993 2020-12-03 04:43:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My grandson is wearing two school jumpers at school - it isn't the perfect solution he's still chilly but he isn't freezing!
1334105993572179968 2020-12-02 20:03:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Keir_Starmer Appeaser, not opposer!
1334105337398517769 2020-12-02 20:01:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've had this discussion many times. The real problem is this: People believe Socialism doesn't work - they were told this by other people who believed (because they were told) that socialism doesn't work - none of them ever stop to ask: Is there a conspiracy theory at work here?
1334103954704244742 2020-12-02 19:55:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I'm safe! No 5G. I don't think we have 3G yet for goodness sake!
1333873129899388934 2020-12-02 04:38:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is just wrong on every level!
1333872597323436036 2020-12-02 04:36:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Right again - As usual
1333743587083874304 2020-12-01 20:03:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Both - two wrongs don't make a right (for either of them). Utterly inconsiderate behaviour from both of them - what were the people around them thinking? Did no one intervene?
1333724878172790784 2020-12-01 18:49:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Coin in the slot TV rental.
1333364313147527168 2020-11-30 18:56:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I went to the car showroom in 2013 to buy a car, the salesman told me my car would be ready for delivery in three days. We're now in 2020 &amp; the salesman has just told me I won't be getting my car because the company has gone bust. But that's ok cos it is just like I have a car!
1332795318627430400 2020-11-29 05:15:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @SamWalker_780 I'm not sure which conspiracy theory you are talking about. I reckon many (if not all) conspiracy theories have a grain of truth at their centre.
1332786469321252864 2020-11-29 04:40:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> A @jeremycorbyn government!
1332782960156815361 2020-11-29 04:26:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If I was a Scrappy I wouldn't want at any cost or free - The deepest ocean would reject it!
1332779087497203717 2020-11-29 04:11:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Shriz100 A featherweight when compared to @jeremycorbyn
1332776033993547777 2020-11-29 03:59:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Starmer is a supporter of Israel so Palestine is the enemy to him - @LFI should be outlawed. Israel is an apartheid state committing genocide on Palestine! Starmer supports genocide! #Im4Palestine.
1332730975957217280 2020-11-29 01:00:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am signing this, whatever their nationality. As Foster Carers we must say this at least once every week. It seems like a lot of so-called 'professionals' don't know this fact! Our charges keep running out of childhood and miss out on so many things they should be entitled to.
1332725802098700288 2020-11-29 00:39:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've always been good at DIY, out of work I wanted to start DIY4U business, DSS the wouldn't allow me to earn &amp; claim benefits. I knew a bloke my age that did successfully as I wanted to do without telling the DSS. I'm Christian my DIY4U business failed because I wouldn't lie.
1332666337425039360 2020-11-28 20:43:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It's not real!
1332407336703565825 2020-11-28 03:33:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have no confidence in him that's for sure!
1332384109444927488 2020-11-28 02:01:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Haven't you realised how stupid it was to work so hard to undermine and prevent @jeremycorbyn from becoming Prime Minister and replace him with your inept and biennial form of politics yet. If Jeremy had been allowed he would have implemented the 'Real Greem Revolution!'
1332358613688590337 2020-11-28 00:20:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My first job, in the Royal Navy, 1972 I was paid the  £3 a week. True we were in training but from 3 quid, we had to buy our own shaving gear, soap, shampoo, sweets, treats &amp; smokes if we smoked. 3 quid just didn't cover it! I had previously earned £30 part-time on the farm
1332064917730496523 2020-11-27 04:53:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> SCAM ALERT - Please be careful when looking at your emails especially if you get one that looks like it's from the DVLA. There is a scam going about that initially looks authentic. IT ISN'T! The SCAMMER's been reported to the DVLA &amp; the Lancaster crime desk. I hope he's arrested
1332063560332140548 2020-11-27 04:47:55 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The trouble is this - we have about 4 or 5 new parties and Socialist groups that have been started in recent months, but what I don't see is a coordinated effort to unite - get together - cooperate etc - more factions won't help - I follow a few of these groups - get it together!
1332062655750819845 2020-11-27 04:44:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I live only a short distance from the station where that was filmed. Carnforth in Lancashire.
1332062269434458116 2020-11-27 04:42:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Is it? I could retweet from here without writing anything -
1332061994875301890 2020-11-27 04:41:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Starmer is a socialite - Lite in every way actually!
1331931255324241922 2020-11-26 20:02:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Corona is a real virus - but it has been used by both government and BIG business to harvest a whopping harvest of 'other people's money from all of us around the world. It hs also temporally hidden a multitude of other sins like deforestation of HS2 route ancient forests.
1331688390123720707 2020-11-26 03:57:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No contest! he wins hands-down
1331687724231823361 2020-11-26 03:54:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Where did that come from? Was Jacks giant building a patio? Unbelievable!
1331673270475776002 2020-11-26 02:57:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If a group of people who were supposed to be your colleagues had treated you as Starmer and the right of Labour has treated @jeremycorbyn you would take them to court. Don't try to say otherwise. We all have a right to defend our reputation.
1331562798271311873 2020-11-25 19:38:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> 'So' at the beginning of a statement or when answering a question.
1331561865361682433 2020-11-25 19:34:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Israeli soldiers breaking international law yet again. #WhileTheWorldLooksOn
1331558420005130240 2020-11-25 19:20:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He even betrayed himself by making out he was something (a socialist) that he wasn't.
1331557115819925504 2020-11-25 19:15:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I think it's called "A backhanded compliment!"
1331295601674362887 2020-11-25 01:56:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yes - Starmer is 'Establishment' A Knight of the realm - for goodness sake. So yes his actions (I won't say policies - he has none) are chosen to cause the most division possible IMHO
1331294633737981952 2020-11-25 01:52:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Divide and conquer is the watchword of the political establishment at this time - Practically every decision and policy produced, whether connected to Brexit, Covid or anything else you care to mention is based on causing division, pitting one against another.
1331293678267142144 2020-11-25 01:48:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree - I am of the same opinion as Jeremy Corbyn that “the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media...” #StandStrongJeremy  Pls copy and paste and tweet
1331290908747321344 2020-11-25 01:37:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There is nothing 'BIG' about shooting a beautiful animal - (That don't impress us much) Why not try fighting it with your bare hands?  Impress anti-hunting wildlife lovers - fight them without a rifle!
1331289461662085126 2020-11-25 01:31:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Sadly we don’t always know the depths of someone’s depression until it is too late. May I please have even 1 follower copy and re-post? I am trying to demonstrate that someone is listening  I'm Listening!   I try to respond to anyone who has MH issues especially if suicidal.
1331287029947265026 2020-11-25 01:22:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Labour Broad-Church Myth is demonstrably proved to be a lie by the last 5 years. In the 1940s the Labour Party boasted over 40% of its MP were from the working-class. Today the figure is less than 2% @jeremycorbyn was only trying to help Labour recover its level playing field
1331284617958223872 2020-11-25 01:12:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I never really worry about people following me back. I follow anyone who seems interesting and Tweets well-thought-out Tweets and lighthearted quips - I unfollow people who abuse, troll and keep repeating the same tweets or Anti-Left or Anti-Corbyn tweets.
1331275452367974400 2020-11-25 00:36:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> She may have started her political career a leftist or leftish MP but she hasn't continued in her leftist commitment - IMHO
1331264149121347585 2020-11-24 23:51:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You could have left the 'Chameleon' he changes his political colour more often than the chameleon.
1331263579258032128 2020-11-24 23:49:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> She is the #Blairess of new Labour
1331202096478220288 2020-11-24 19:44:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Do you really have to shampoo Bananas?
1331193941471924226 2020-11-24 19:12:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I hate this idolatrous worship of All-Things-American that so many Britishers have fallen into over the past number of years. You do know that most of the wars that have happened in the world were instigated or perpetrated by America and her 'adoration committee'. Perpetual War!
1331186764128661504 2020-11-24 18:43:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn should (and would be) still the leader of Labour - If I had my way.
1331186220404273152 2020-11-24 18:41:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You only have to look at the Police/CPS results of two cases (Out of hundreds of accusations of AS) being progressed toward prosecution.
1330957627313020931 2020-11-24 03:33:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Any fine meted out should be paid by the Tory Party or Boris Johnson's personal account!
1330945759408218112 2020-11-24 02:46:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> #AllIWant4Christmas
1330945461679779846 2020-11-24 02:45:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Is there anyone who 'Doesn't need these things?' The Tory Party seem to think living on the streets or in a motel or B&amp;B is a lifestyle choice - Have they ever even seen the state of some of these so-called 'Emergency Housing provisions?'
1330944704574353412 2020-11-24 02:41:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Why would @jeremycorbyn do that? He has always been honest, why would he lie just to be given back the whip - especially when the whip is more angel delight than whipped cream!
1330927100728111104 2020-11-24 01:32:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I used to wear them every winter - I worked on a farm most years from about 10 or 11 years old - the balaclava kept my ears warm that the short back and sides created!
1330913290017497090 2020-11-24 00:37:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The problem with 'Mandatory things' is that it has Tory in it! 🤪🤣😲
1330909248465874947 2020-11-24 00:21:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> 3, Be honest with yourself. If you feel bad, tell someone, if you feel good, share your positivity (it'll help)  4. Don't let anyone tell you you're weak or to pull yourself together etc. Anyone who says stuff like this has no understanding (or compassion) 5. Take a break often!
1330909246691692546 2020-11-24 00:21:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Hi Nadeem, I've had depression &amp; anxiety for 20 years+.I've found a few things that have helped me to more than cope with my MH issues.  1, Helping others. as we give to others we improve our own positivity.  2, Being completely open with people Especially close ones. 3, 1/2
1330855010150871044 2020-11-23 20:45:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We will have a very much reduced number having Christmas with us this year. we will be inviting our Autistic Son to spend Christmas with us. He can't spend Christmas alone.
1330853920294514690 2020-11-23 20:41:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just watched this - I recommend everyone does the same - 100% for @jeremycorbyn and blasts #KermitStarmer out of the court!  https://t.co/9X7o7IgB83
1330841744955609089 2020-11-23 19:52:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Personal pride in my appearence!
1330606238015610884 2020-11-23 04:17:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Main Stream Media Lies have become the Norm!
1330604397093679108 2020-11-23 04:09:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Genuine to the core! Corbyn - #WeSupportCorbyn
1330601728119627776 2020-11-23 03:59:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The number of working-class MPs in labour 1947 -over 40% - The Number of working-class MP in Labour 2020 - less than 2%. See the problem?  See the reason #WeSupportCorbyn
1330599197268176897 2020-11-23 03:49:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yes - #WeSupportCorbyn keep supporting.
1330599007714938884 2020-11-23 03:48:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just read this on Facebook - #WeSupportCorbyn  https://t.co/cakzVIMB8M
1330595046144569346 2020-11-23 03:32:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Good to hear/See @jon_thickett on Socialist tv tonight.
1330587922232438789 2020-11-23 03:04:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> In general, I agree with this article. But I feel I should Clarify the limitations placed on a labour leader (Corbyn) to intervene in this situation. He wasn't able to act alone or influence the NCC because Labour had &amp; has a procedural process via the NCC #StarmerTakeNote re: JC
1330581367697137664 2020-11-23 02:38:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I think it is wonderful that after all the accusations, propaganda, libellous &amp; defamatory comments levelled at #WeSupportCorbyn. After all the attempts to discredit him, remove him from office (2 leadership wins) there is still not one piece of evidence that Jeremy did wrong!
1330576777664729088 2020-11-23 02:19:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> #WeSupportCorbyn #WeSupportJeremyCorbyn - I have supported Jeremy Corbyn since he was first nominated to be the leader of the Labour Party. I Still believe he would win a third time if he allowed himself to be nominated to lead the party in a leadership challenge! #GoJeremyCorbyn
1330566201051930626 2020-11-23 01:37:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Go to the supermarket. Kettles are cheap as chips &amp; come with a guarantee. A couple of years ago our kettle stopped working, I took it back to Morrisons they replaced it without asking to see the guarantee even though, I told them I didn't know if it was still under guarantee
1330564174427148288 2020-11-23 01:29:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Bath - Path - daft -  I tend to say "Barth, Parth and darft!  I get told off by my foster kids If I slip into my southern accent.
1330560348215250945 2020-11-23 01:14:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Never seen any of it!
1330559614279151616 2020-11-23 01:11:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> After agreeing with this tweet I was involved in an #ArguTweetsession with someone who said they supported @jeremycorbyn I had to block them - I was accused of being a racism apologist, I have no idea why? they got blocked!
1330556967081930754 2020-11-23 01:01:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Racism Apologist?  Blocked - you are no Corbyn Supporter!
1330556220885839875 2020-11-23 00:58:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Even if we make drastic changes to our established political and economic systems it will take 3 or 4 generations to reverse this trend - Victorian Britain ended many years ago but we still have pockets of Victorian taboos and traditions hanging around in our society. EG Funerals
1330554228717260805 2020-11-23 00:50:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This didn't give him unrestricted power &amp; authority in the Labour Party. You need to do some research into Labour Party structure/authority. Ian McNichol (an Anti-Corbyn NEC appointee) was part of the witch hunt that started the AS accusations in the party. I was expelled by him.
1330552472688062467 2020-11-23 00:43:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You said  "Jeremy Corbyn was accused of allowing AS to fester in his organisation, so of course it wouldn’t be bought up before that 😂 my god"  Allowing AS to feater? He didn't he did all he had the authority to do. McNichol prevented him from further action.  His organisation?
1330500411372036102 2020-11-22 21:16:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Extra protection! wise!
1330499762399932434 2020-11-22 21:13:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Antisemitism &amp; racism in the Labour party is actually lower than in any of the other political parties in the UK. while @jeremycorbyn was in office he obeyed Labour Rules by 'Not interfering in Disciplinary Matters'. @IanMcNichol intentionally prevented AS from being dealt with
1330499760478965765 2020-11-22 21:13:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have no idea who's (WHICH) side you are on? - In fact, I don't think you know - who's which you are on - @jeremycorbyn 'Personally' was never accused of antisemitism or racism. He has campaigned for equal rights (anti-racism laws etc) throughout his political career.
1330489031633870850 2020-11-22 20:31:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No!  @jeremycorbyn had never been accused of anything racist or antisemitic before he came to office. when considering his political career spans more than half his lifetime, I find it very disturbing that people haven't noticed this fact!
1330488315909431297 2020-11-22 20:28:28 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Reminiscent of JS Lowery. - Impressive!
1330486751916404736 2020-11-22 20:22:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> She's a Tory! So yes she is that ignorant!
1330486183424651264 2020-11-22 20:20:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The biggest understatement of 2020!
1330258332968423425 2020-11-22 05:14:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Birds-of-a-feather flock together!  whether on the right or to the right day is day, and night is night  Kermit Starmer thinks she's right  cos he's a bully too!
1330257474520223747 2020-11-22 05:11:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree, there was also a massive amount of Christian involvement in the Socialist Movement -especially in Wales, I don't know whether the Union Movement would have been as powerful, as early as it was if not for the Methodist Christians that supported it!
1330139966362542081 2020-11-21 21:24:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We asked for Socialism and got a Socialite!
1330138376784277507 2020-11-21 21:17:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If (Like New Zealand) had slammed shut the borders and closed the ports/airports, isolated and quarantined people entering/leaving the UK during the first few weeks of the pandemic, the British people would have been protected from COVID-19, the death toll would've been far lower
1330136988343824393 2020-11-21 21:12:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've had similar ideas.  We need a Socialist written, 'What 21st Century Socialists Believe - What Socialists Fight For!' book. - And a series of talks/lectures about how Socialism has developed over the past 100 years. I believe very few people know what TRUE socialism is!
1329857083051831303 2020-11-21 02:40:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am not even sure that I've ever heard it. I am not sure I've ever heard 'of it' until this last week. I bet there are a lot of people who will search for and listen to see if they get offended by it! So the BBC have popularised a song perhaps hundreds of people didn't know ?
1329855640307634176 2020-11-21 02:34:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> As far as the Conservatives are concerned "Anything goes!" as long as it makes them money and they don't get caught!
1329766998599983106 2020-11-20 20:42:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You don't seem to have any self-awareness when you make such a comment.
1329533117477113857 2020-11-20 05:12:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Hear - Hear!
1329532810433077254 2020-11-20 05:11:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Brown and Long-Baily are both wrong, in this - @jeremycorbyn did nothing wrong. On the other hand, @Keir_Starmer has broken Labour Party Rules AGAIN
1329478056361259009 2020-11-20 01:34:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I would still call them plimsoles - I come from Buckinghamshire.
1329476012778938368 2020-11-20 01:25:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> For someone who is supposed to be a Law-abiding citizen and a QC. One has to wonder why he can't follow Labour Party rules ??????????????????????????????????
1329384449117724672 2020-11-19 19:22:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @RLong_Bailey is wrong! @jeremycorbyn literally has nothing to apologise for he, did nothing wrong. On the other hand, @Keir_Starmer should be apologising to Jeremy Corbyn for (Yet Again) wrongly accusing him.  They only hear what they want to hear and disregard the rest!
1329382698922729473 2020-11-19 19:15:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Definitely @Keir_Starmer - @Tony_Blair is History!
1329152944189693952 2020-11-19 04:02:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Ask the baker to pay him in bread, cakes, pies etc - I worked for a local bakery years ago he paid me minimum wage for 30 hours per week and as much unsold produce as I could use. We virtually lived on bakery produce for 4 years. Lovely!
1329150048253468672 2020-11-19 03:50:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Scary Spice?
1329131392182181890 2020-11-19 02:36:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He may not want to but he going to, the way he's behaving - Come, the revolution and the 21st century United National Democratic Socialist Party! with @jeremycorbyn as Leader.
1329120342820917256 2020-11-19 01:52:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn didn't speak to the reporters but I wasn't referring to him speaking on that occasion. If you read my inserted piece I was comparing my experience to the experience @Keir_Starmer has caused for Jeremy over the past 20 days or so, Jeremy must be so disappointed
1329118782967730177 2020-11-19 01:46:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> the Labour Party (UK): Motion of No Confidence in Keir Starmer - Sign the Petition!  https://t.co/LgLx87ZKkb via @UKChange I have signed!
1329111652705460226 2020-11-19 01:18:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The right &amp; centre of the Labour Party has been behaving like that for over 5 years. @jeremycorbyn his team and his loyal supporters/members have faced continuous assault and insult since Jeremy was first nominated to become Leader of the Labour Party. It's still happening today!
1329110887685386240 2020-11-19 01:15:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn's whole life demonstrates he is not nor has he ever been Antisemitic.  MSM and the establishment concocted this slur to undermine and overthrow his leadership.  If MSM etc could prove he is AS they wouldn't be still continuing the onslaught of attacks on him &amp; us!
1329109834566955010 2020-11-19 01:10:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No! @jeremycorbyn is an Anti-Racist in every sense.
1329109363487813632 2020-11-19 01:09:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Calling all unions affiliated to the Labour Party. Please withdraw your allegiance &amp; your financial commitments with the Labour Party Forthwith. The Labour Party no longer speaks for the workers of the UK. Labour under @Keir_Starmer speaks for Israel &amp; @BoardofDeputies direct him
1329107536658780172 2020-11-19 01:01:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Thousands of Labour Party members have been asking that question about people like you @margarethodge. How is it possible for you to remain a Labour MP while treating 500,000+ loyal Labour members &amp; thousands of Corbyn supporters with such utter contempt @LFI &amp; enemies of us!
1329105173239750656 2020-11-19 00:52:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Becoming like them (in their heartless ways) would result in being like them.  @jeremycorbyn and Socialists who hold to true Democratic Socialism do not want to become like other politicians, political parties or such cruel people.  We are better than that #WeAreCorbyn
1329104053616455680 2020-11-19 00:47:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Everyone who supports @jeremycorbyn  https://t.co/ja5NtcFxVQ
1329092135782477826 2020-11-19 00:00:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Keir_Starmer is using this attack on @jeremycorbyn to deflect us/the house from his utterly useless opposition of the Tories &amp; his subservience to the  @BoardofDeputies &amp; @_LFI. No MP should be allowed to have divided loyalties like this! it shows their lack of loyalty to voters
1329089699219005441 2020-11-18 23:50:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Do you mean flip/flop like @Keir_Starmer&amp; his "I support @jeremycorbyn but have a knife ready to stab him in the back. I support Corbyn but have suspended him. I reinstate Jeremy but won't restore the whip to him &amp; I support JC but will prevent him running again as a Labour MP?"
1329088094805524483 2020-11-18 23:44:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My son attended a special school, he has autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia, ADHD and was Educational Resistant during childhood/teens. He scored low on an IQ test as a teenager. Now nearly 40-years-old &amp; knows more about politics than most other people I know. He voted 4 @jeremycorbyn
1329077062691213319 2020-11-18 23:00:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> #StarmerStirring up descent in the ranks. He's not a Leader he's #Sheepal
1329036858869899264 2020-11-18 20:20:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Always threatening never does it though (more's the pity)
1329034920656855047 2020-11-18 20:13:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I appreciate your comment! Thanks!
1329029613914370051 2020-11-18 19:52:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Keir_Starmer is obsessed with destroying JC because he is jealous of the devotion he can see inside &amp; outside of the Labour Party to @jeremycorbyne. Starmer is behaving like a petulant child who wants to 'have it all his way.' Starmer is not a leader. he's just #Sheepal
1329027265829679110 2020-11-18 19:42:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Again you've failed to see/understand the underlying issue, either you're so submerged in the @LFI &amp; the @BoardofDeputies that you can not make the correct distinction between Anti-semitism and Anti-Israeli wrongdoing in &amp; against Palestine. or you just hate @jeremycorbyn?
1329025526607048704 2020-11-18 19:35:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I hold you responsible for the upheaval within Labour, your actions, your response to @jeremycorbyn's original statement, and his subsequent statement concerning the ERHC report have been and continue to be misleading and are prone to buying into a past conspiratorial legacy
1329022351820861440 2020-11-18 19:23:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The BoD isn't the Jewish Community - it represents a very small percentage of Jews in the UK.  It is largely due to the actions of Labour Party members and some Labour MPs that Jews belonging to certain minority groups do not trust the disciplinary process within Labour.
1329019965169668096 2020-11-18 19:13:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't believe the level of Antisemitism in Labour warrants the Leader of the party neglecting his every other duty - A good leader delegates - Labour already has a team dedicated to this task.
1328804065090920449 2020-11-18 04:55:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Labour should be about @jeremycorbyn And it should be about every other member, MP and supporter (and potential members of the party. Seriously this is one of the main problems Labour faces. This leadership like the previous New Labour Leadership forgot that LABOUR IS THE MEMBERS
1328802133207101440 2020-11-18 04:48:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Starmer broke Labour rules when he suspended  @jeremycorbyn I hope Jeremy asks the Labour disciplinary department to look at suspending  @Keir_Starmer. Jeremy was goaded (for years) by members and non-members to suspend members and officials but he refused to overstep this line!
1328801658479009795 2020-11-18 04:46:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Johnson has cut a swath of destruction the length of our beautiful country and now tries to put a bandaid on it to placate us - I'm not buying it! (this Green Economic Recovery) is yet another stolen &amp; watered-down (@jeremycorbyn) policy.
1328788746964262912 2020-11-18 03:54:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Starmer broke Labour rules when he suspended @jeremycorbyn - I hope Jeremy asks the Labour disciplinary department to look at suspending @Keir_Starmer.

1328740571410800641 2020-11-18 00:43:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We played under hedges, in shallow dry ditches &amp; a hollow tree that had fallen down. I built my first bike from parts collected on a reduce site &amp; made loads of go-carts from pram wheels &amp; scrap wood. My friends &amp; I played torch (flashlight) football after dark &amp; scooter football
1328740569758183425 2020-11-18 00:43:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I was raised in a village council house. We had next to no money, no central heating, a black &amp; white TV with 2 then 3 channels (but more programs than we get today, with a hundred channels) we played in farmers fields, straw bales became fortresses &amp; hideouts, we climbed trees.
1328737317738123264 2020-11-18 00:30:37 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> And stop them throwing cutlery in the bin, hiding plates with food in a drawer. One of my sons once had a collection of a hundred empty, unwashed milk bottles under his bed. I nearly had a fit when I found them - I think the milkman had a celebration when we returned them
1328444398691102721 2020-11-17 05:06:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The people need to wake up, rise up and take it back from those who have stolen it (piece by piece) from us - I am referring to the 1% - the Government and Tax avoiders/dodgers. They have stolen so much it's time for us to take it back "#CommonersRevolt
1328442017542758401 2020-11-17 04:57:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn should be PM.
1328441871933317120 2020-11-17 04:56:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> When you have children you should put things like this out of reach - the same goes for sharing your home with a pet! I hope the ink isn't toxic?
1328439918536896514 2020-11-17 04:48:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree - I have said this a number of times myself. People need to know what we are in danger of losing!

1328420043496058883 2020-11-17 03:29:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Wow!
1328410652323536917 2020-11-17 02:52:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Well said!  We have the right to criticise any nation that oppresses its citizens. Isreal must stop stealing land, demolishing houses, uprooting olive trees &amp; crops or oppressing the Palestinians where they live. The land belonged to Palestinians before Britain gave it to Israel.
1328356992604377088 2020-11-16 23:19:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This 'CONCERN' affects 'How Many?' A tiny percentage of the '1%' - For The Few - Not The Many. Isn't right - We should always be - For The Many - Not The Few!  Spock (Star Trek) The Needs of the Many OUTWEIGH the Needs of the Few!
1328354982765195269 2020-11-16 23:11:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I find it quite remarkable that anyone does watch this crap!
1328354798186409987 2020-11-16 23:10:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Could you ask the food bank for a delivery, explain the problem you have with carrying, hopefully, there will be someone coming your way as they leave the food bank for the day.
1328029883784699905 2020-11-16 01:39:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I hope everyone by now has heard that the level of suicides among all groups has risen at an unprecedented rate in the last few months - even among children, preteens and teenagers. This so-called 'Government' is adding pressure to everyone's anxiety levels. @ToriesMustGo ASAP
1328027055506731008 2020-11-16 01:28:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @SyHawkes For anyone who is claiming a benefit or seeking employment, a smartphone is a requirement. Even homeless people need one so they can contact support, job centres night shelters etc and be contacted by officials.
1328022629677228034 2020-11-16 01:10:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Good Idea!
1328020015233331202 2020-11-16 01:00:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Auto-refresh makes me so angry at times, I see a tweet I want to respond to, I need to check something before I respond, I come back to Twitter and it has refreshed the Tweet is somewhere (Any number of Tweets away) and I can't find the tweet! 😬😠
1327994219114455041 2020-11-15 23:17:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't know why it flowered during 2019 but in 2020 nothing surprises me. I saw two flowers on my Bramley Apple tree whiIe I was picking apples this year. If there are no insects to pollinate the flower &amp;/or other pear trees = no fruit. You could plant another pear tree.
1327956918548172800 2020-11-15 20:49:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I bought my son a Wicks cylinder vacuum cleaner - he has had it now for about 6 years, it still works fine. It cost much less than other brands (other brands are available). Previously he broke a vacuum per year on average.
1327955257645821956 2020-11-15 20:43:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The advice I was given was 'Exercise' -  I find that if I am sitting for long periods (driving especially) changing my (Seat and/or sitting) position is also helpful.
1327574318197379072 2020-11-14 19:29:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I'd say there is more than one thing wrong with our country.  1, our government. 2, our electoral system. 3, our news media  4, our benefits and wage system 5, we allow tax dodging ( But) 6, we levy fines on homeless people.  7, we charge VAT tax equally on all but the few!
1327572441397334016 2020-11-14 19:21:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yea! @Keir_Starmer was recruited to play Premiership Socker (football) but the first and every time he was put in the first team to play for the premiership team he came out onto the pitch dressed as a Rugby (football-player) shouting he was going to play Rugby style football.
1327570282752716801 2020-11-14 19:13:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I find it deeply troubling that you make an accusation that your 'lefty following' is racist? (a very sweeping statement) then only give one example to support your assertion. I would also like to understand which LEFT you are referring to? The UK left is not the same as USA left
1327293993139531778 2020-11-14 00:55:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Members (and supporters) have every right to know the truth concerning whether their vote was accepted, counted and or disallowed.
1327293268380545024 2020-11-14 00:52:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> How can this be considered Democratic? It can't!
1327292606548746240 2020-11-14 00:49:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Tell her from me she is absolutely correct - @Keir_Starmer is a Tory - Tory. @Tony_Blair was at least a bit Labour when he developed his Education, Education, Education slogan and his Every Child Matters policy! I don't see any policies from Statmer. Not one!
1327209196669050881 2020-11-13 19:18:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am not sure @Keir_Starmer even read the report if he read it he either didn't understand what he read or has wholly ignored the relevant part. Missing, ignoring or choosing to not acknowledge parts of a report is a common issue as far as I can see.
1326896610597548038 2020-11-12 22:36:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Bloody papers drive me crazy with posts/Tweets like this. I click on the link than spend ten minutes trying to find the article, getting past the popups and wrestling with cookies and adds but end up still having no idea what the 'ITEM' is?
1326843807447445504 2020-11-12 19:06:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Stop. take stock. reboot and start-over!
1326842941638385664 2020-11-12 19:03:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have thought privately for some time that the left of the Labour Party has been proverbially 'flogging a dead horse'. Over the 5 years that @jeremycorbyn has been 'the key focus' I have been acutely aware of every attempt to discredit him and the left-wing. Time for a new start
1326569391291502593 2020-11-12 00:56:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Hi, Sophia, you have a very pretty smile. I bet people know you are smiling even if they can't see your face. I bet you are a giggler too - You smile with your eyes as well!
1326568344758181893 2020-11-12 00:51:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I would like @jeremycorbyn to refrain from apologising - he did nothing he needs to apologise for.
1326567823246757888 2020-11-12 00:49:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't eat chicken - haven't for some years! It gives me gas. sorry about the -----------------
1326491096608813056 2020-11-11 19:44:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The picture was the evidence, their behaviour was what caused the outcry. They pointed guns! the photographer just pointed a camera!
1326490097697566721 2020-11-11 19:40:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Like a good-o-boy, never doin' no harm, I sure do! Y'all!
1326264562665058304 2020-11-11 04:44:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Help by the Beetles?
1326199732667101184 2020-11-11 00:27:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't think it has much to do with one's class (middle or working) it is more a case of Empathic and Kind Socialists or something other than real socialist.
1325784446067466240 2020-11-09 20:56:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I did - it wasn't a nice thought though! 🐏ish🐏ish
1325776655281950723 2020-11-09 20:26:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Wow. Racism - unadulterated racism!
1325757914842324992 2020-11-09 19:11:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I find it incredible that seemingly intelligent people fail to see that 'Independence' for individual, institution or nation is a fallacy, an illusion. I've spent years educating my foster children this, they understand that independence needs counterbalanced with interdependence
1325442126830850049 2020-11-08 22:16:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That is utterly ridiculous - how do they expect to implement this ruling? have they bugged every office,   meeting hall and Labour members home? Maybe they have?
1325440982326915072 2020-11-08 22:12:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It took 2 stylists to achieve that look - they just couldn't agree!
1325147335270133766 2020-11-08 02:45:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> More (private fireworks parties) here in Bolton-le-sands than ever before, all flipping week and two weekends - We usually have a big public display but not this year because of COVID-19 - I hate fireworks - they make me so jumpy. I'm not sure which is worse. Usual or this?
1325145302278557696 2020-11-08 02:37:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My sentiments entirely!
1325144758445088768 2020-11-08 02:35:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We should be calling Boris Trump 2!
1325112241755217922 2020-11-08 00:25:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I see it!
1325045431869575168 2020-11-07 20:00:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Trump doesn't even speak American peoperly!
1325040574265761792 2020-11-07 19:41:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If you told me it was raining, I'd need to go outside and get wet before I'd believe you!
1324681599137570821 2020-11-06 19:54:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Report, Block &amp; move on. Block their Phone number &amp; filter your calls. You can do this either by using the BT call blocker or using an answer phone for all calls.  Who is this person, Jon Cousins?
1324672127669276673 2020-11-06 19:17:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Socialism never took hold in the USA because the whole population (including would-be socialists) have been so conditioned by the right to think that Socialism is Communism &amp; the version of Communism the USSR &amp; China had is the one and only form socialism can take. Brainwashed!
1324669262452183040 2020-11-06 19:05:37 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> looked at your Tweet &amp; saw that you said 'Religion'. Why do people insist on using the word religion as though 'all religions' are the same? They're not. no one can say all Christian's or Churches are the same. When Socialism began in Britain it was popularised among Christians
1324669260908662785 2020-11-06 19:05:37 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I was shocked when I read that you think that Christianity &amp; socialism are incompatible, but then I thought (what do you know about Christianity &amp; what type of Christians do you know?) If you know "Christians" that behave as Teressa May (UK Ex-PM) did, it's not surprising. I just
1324442242665381896 2020-11-06 04:03:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Money, money, money it's a Tory world, they've got all the money it's a Tory world. They sell, we buy, they live we die. But, Nothing else matters in a Tory world.
1324440614587539462 2020-11-06 03:57:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It upsets my long term acquired PTSD every year. I was never in a war zone. I was a gunner in the Navy during peacetime but suffer from depression and anxiety. My Foster daughter is feeling very jumpy and the cats are shut-in our bedroom with all the blinds closed. I hate 5th nov
1324439659628400643 2020-11-06 03:53:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He is a liar!
1324439441075851267 2020-11-06 03:52:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Fascist!
1324439151085846529 2020-11-06 03:51:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Trump is a fascist this is how fascists behave -
1324333231517433857 2020-11-05 20:50:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Thanks!
1324333085463371776 2020-11-05 20:49:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> When I need things like this I usually look first at Facebook Marketplace people often have bits leftover from kitchen installations that are matches of near matches to the broken piece - I have also found by searching 'used kitchen doors/draw fronts' on google.
1324331246202327043 2020-11-05 20:42:28 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just received this reply to my Tweet about this - I hope it helps - There are agencies like 'Step Change' who assist people with advice and practical help. It's a free service. You can get details online.
1324330401586991106 2020-11-05 20:39:07 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I thought so I hoped someone would Tweet this Info - I hope the lady I was replying to can see your tweet!
1324330077446963201 2020-11-05 20:37:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Scriptures tell Christians to 'refrain from this kind of public display'  Matthew 6:5 when you pray so not be like the hypocrites who stand in the synagogue (Church) and make a public display of themselves - but go into a private place to pray. this repeated elsewhere too.
1324328485071052802 2020-11-05 20:31:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I didn't put the sound on to listen to what she was saying It's the bloke walking behind her that's scary.  Just watch him - totally unaffected! 🤪😨😱
1324326239910375426 2020-11-05 20:22:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've never had debt but - Is there some system available for 'debt consolidation' I thought there was a way of a small claims court to sort it so the debtor only has to pay a set amount and the repayment is distributed like shares to each company owed money?
1324320321432932352 2020-11-05 19:59:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There are so many types of screw heads today that I have a draw full of drill driver heads. I have; hex head, star head, square head, crosshead, and slot head. I have heads with a hole in the middle; hex, star, square &amp; cross and slot with a central slot. They drive me crazy!
1324085751244558336 2020-11-05 04:26:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I consider this Tweet totally heartless and in really bad taste - thousands of people and families have lost loved ones to COVID-19 - You may be next - Just saying!
1323951949595762691 2020-11-04 19:35:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I won't make that promise Ed, I'll always talk about @jeremycorbyn and the missed opportunities of 2017 and 19. I have seen a lot of remarkable things in my lifetime and a few stupid ones - saying yes to Brexit and Boris have so far, been the pinnacle of utter foolhardy stupidity
1323949436670775296 2020-11-04 19:25:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I completely agree with you Tom, we live in a radical time soft options and middle of the road just won't cut it for times like these. Isn't it sad that so much money, effort, and passion are put into the war machine but people seem to think we need to go to the political centre?
1323711360828645382 2020-11-04 03:39:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yes - reinstated as leader of the party! Lol
1323709521915760645 2020-11-04 03:31:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> What do you give an Elephant with diarrhoea - plenty of room.
1323708150537687046 2020-11-04 03:26:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Thanks John!
1323694579405721601 2020-11-04 02:32:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Tories culled the old-folks and nobody complained. then they culled the nurses  the reaction was the same they culled the sick and disabled  the poor and homeless too you better look out children  they're coming after you! 😢
1323591955088052224 2020-11-03 19:44:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He said exactly what the report said!  #StreirCarmer steering \Labour into the Doldrums - sailing ships that that got stuck there would become like the Marie Celeste - A ghost ship - #GhostShipLabour
1323359873954914307 2020-11-03 04:22:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> HS2 has just destroyed a nature reserve at a Little Known place called Calvert, near Steeple-Claydon in Buckinghamshire. This nature reserve was built on an old Land-Fill Site by local people, thousands of birds (some of them rare) &amp; other wildlife have lost their habitat.
1323357980209876992 2020-11-03 04:15:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It only takes a few lessons to learn most things. But it nearly always takes many more lessons to unlearn things. It's like bad habits &amp; stupidity.
1323347948076490754 2020-11-03 03:35:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> When Churchill gave his well-known speech "We will fight them on the beaches" etc. He wasn't talking about fighting a failed, useless, bigotted and lying Tory Government. but I believe we need to follow his instructions if we want our country to survive. #BorisHasFailedTheNation
1323343795291914245 2020-11-03 03:18:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I'm not anti-semitic. My Christian faith is founded on the Prophets, Priests &amp; Kings of the historic Israeli People &amp; Christ, the Apostles, Teachers &amp; Pastors (most of them Jews.)  However, Zionist Israel is committing war crimes daily against Palestine. #IsupportPalistine
1323012827439837185 2020-11-02 05:23:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> How do you know an elephant has been in the fridge?   There are ootprints in the butter.
1323005955471278082 2020-11-02 04:56:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You are so right - have you seen the elephants who dig out one of their babies who gets stuck in the water hole? https://t.co/wYEnFlxuOe The Empathy shown here puts humans to shame!
1323003647865823237 2020-11-02 04:47:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Elephants and all kinds of cats.
1323000748670623747 2020-11-02 04:35:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My sister quite often puts a similar post on Facebook -
1322998731906666497 2020-11-02 04:27:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> So now you are defending 'rent-a-thug' in France!
1322998079755374595 2020-11-02 04:24:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There was a massive problem with AS in the party - Read the ERHC report 'properly' and you'd see that the previous NEC was at the heart of the attacks against @jeremycorbyn and his followers. It always felt like they were jealous of his following and how much we (Still) love him!
1322998076840288257 2020-11-02 04:24:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Factionalism is central to the Anti-Semitism issue. People keep blaming the wrong man for the AS issue. McNichol (at best) dragged his feet at worst created the overemphasis of AS in the Party. As soon as McNichol was ousted things began to change but MSM continued to say
1322991370089410560 2020-11-02 03:58:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree!
1322986769923690496 2020-11-02 03:40:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I really admire @johnbercow1 for his honesty!
1322985950948040707 2020-11-02 03:36:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've said often that Nigel Farage and the UKIP party were a Fake Political Party created by the Tories to Farage is a Tory on Steroids!
1322985354606059520 2020-11-02 03:34:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Fortunately. most have recovered - one is still very poorly, but the last report said she is improving (she is quite frail and elderly)
1322983744463085568 2020-11-02 03:27:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The number of cases of COVID-19 sounds a lot but when you realise there are 65+ million people in the UK the likelihood of knowing anyone who has had it personally becomes a lot less likely than it first appears.
1322982980168699907 2020-11-02 03:24:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Me too - a few.
1322982681974657025 2020-11-02 03:23:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Who is this random bloke they keep getting to express a view on stuff?  He seems to spend an inordinate amount of time yabbering about politics on British Television.
1322980077181804544 2020-11-02 03:13:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> And me!  Israel is committing genocide of the Palestinian People while the whole profoundly useless national governments of our world look on as spectators &amp; behave as though it is a reenactment of a video game.  #ZionismIsEvil #ApartheidIsrael #IStandWithJeremyCorbyn #Palestine
1322977533038571521 2020-11-02 03:03:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have no idea how anyone can think it is right to deny JC the right to have his say What happened to @jeremycorbyn's right to use his 'freedom of speech' (the same freedom of speech he has spent his life fighting for!
1322976743662243841 2020-11-02 03:00:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There is no 'Left' in Labour anymore - @Keir_Starmer has effectively shafted them (us) @jeremycorbyn has every right to speak his mind, he is entitled to the same 'Freedom of Speach' as you or I, or anyone else - deny him and you deny all of the free world.
1322975468560228356 2020-11-02 02:55:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Start to?  @Keir_Starmer hasn't had a moment of control of Labour since 'Taking' office.  Even when @jeremycorbyn was leader these same people caused so much disruption within the party that they made a massive contribution to Labours defeat in November 2019. Trouble makers all!
1322974264564322304 2020-11-02 02:50:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I love this Hasan - you are so right though - If I see 'of' written one more time when the writer means 'off' I think I'll scream.
1322973096547143681 2020-11-02 02:45:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Andria - We the people appoint MPs they are supposed to work for us. If we effectively employ them to be our representatives in the House of Commons. (Whether we voted for them individually or not) Surely we have EVERY RIGHT to ask them to step down if they fail to represent us!
1322970351878443008 2020-11-02 02:34:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Since when did the police (in any country) need to wear 'Bomb-squad' attire to arrest a pokemon?
1322969455081697280 2020-11-02 02:31:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Carriecakes80 Carrie, We foster. I can't go into details on open Twitter but we've faced similar issues with young people we care for. I'm happy to chat with you via DM if you want. We have had to find a way with school, education authority, social workers &amp; virtual head &amp; Two County Councils
1322958656070209536 2020-11-02 01:48:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> was called lazy and inattentive during my school days but I wasn't I had a poor start with schooling because the Headteacher in my primary and junior school hated me (I don't know why) she ridiculed me in front of the other children &amp; encouraged the children to repeat her words.
1322958654371409924 2020-11-02 01:48:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It is inexcusable that schools are labelling children and young people as skivers and similar - However, it is not really all that surprising that schools do this - they have always thought like this and the Tory Party have revived this attitude in Britain over recent years. I
1322956244215336962 2020-11-02 01:38:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He did nothing wrong. He virtually repeated what the author of the report said in the report. @Keir_Starmer has distorted what @jeremycorbyn said or what the author wrote. It is remarkable how supposed intelligent ppl can fail to understand both written and spoken words.
1322954944438292480 2020-11-02 01:33:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> How can the truth ever be hurtful?  @jeremycorbyn has proved himself to be honest and full of integrity - Rayner is obfuscating - trying to hedge her bets by saying Jeremy is right but being unkind - we all know what she is like!
1322946630702768129 2020-11-02 01:00:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Aye!
1322941033609601024 2020-11-02 00:38:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I still love it!
1322940858199642114 2020-11-02 00:37:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Petition: Hold a public inquiry into Government contracts granted during Covid-19  https://t.co/BSz6T9TPf2  It's a very important inquiry.
1322901931862491137 2020-11-01 22:02:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I like to (it's a family tradition from my side of our family) put them up Christmas Eve and take them down on 2nd of January. But for the last few years, we've put them up about the second week of December
1322895040285429766 2020-11-01 21:35:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It was one from the Keir Starmer special 'Non-Existent Unwritten Rules Book.' I have learned of the existence of secret rule books in a number of Churches, Businesses, Political Parties they refuse to acknowledge they exist until you fall foul of them.
1322646632912048131 2020-11-01 05:08:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We do that because @Keir_Starmer has suspended our hero - Quite normal behaviour IMHO
1322645179904466946 2020-11-01 05:02:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I hated Maggie but at least she had a manifesto and didn't do u-turns every week - I didn't agree with what she did but everyone knew the direction of travel - with Johnson it's like riding a horror roll-a-coster that has an inherent mechanical fault that is prone to killing.
1322642102484959232 2020-11-01 04:50:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> we should refer to it as Islamophobia!  #InvestigatetheToryParty
1322630201654808577 2020-11-01 04:03:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> They believed the lie!  (you know the 1, socialism will destroy the economy)  Have you seen the mess that the 'experts in capitalism' have made of it?  Don't bother trying to say COVID-19 caused the collapse.  Put the blame where it belongs - at Johnsons (Cameron's) feet &amp; BREXIT
1322610760137220099 2020-11-01 02:45:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn's suspension was/is politically motivated - @Keir_Starmer should be ashamed of himself. #ReinstateJeremyCorbyn NOW!
1322609543264849922 2020-11-01 02:41:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> 'Stagnant' as my brother once mistakenly called it!
1322607662748606468 2020-11-01 02:33:34 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Choice is actually very simple - Switch the light 'ON' or switch it 'OFF'.   'Lock-down' or no 'Lock-down'  Partial lockdown is a misnomer -  Local Lockdowns haven't worked.  Numbers of infections and deaths have continued to go up - so switch on a #NationalLockdown2
1322594916627787776 2020-11-01 01:42:55 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The @jeremycorbyn suspension is/was politically motivated and illegal - @Keir_Starmer will rue the day he decided to do this - Jeremy will be reinstated &amp; will watch Starmer reduced to an anathema. Right (side of history) and the truth will prevail!
1322591365243588610 2020-11-01 01:28:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You are completely mistaken - Starmer uses @jeremycorbyn to get what he wanted!
1322587141424242688 2020-11-01 01:12:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> As usual, it'll all end in tiers!
1322586100993589249 2020-11-01 01:07:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Here is a rant I posted on Facebook.  https://t.co/kuT52E2kQm
1322573856142479361 2020-11-01 00:19:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Keir_Starmer never truly backed @jeremycorbyn he did as many politicians have done in the past. He used Jeremy's popularity to climb the political ladder to get himself elected to party leadership. He had me fooled for a while there. But no more. Starmer is a turncoat!
1322572246737686530 2020-11-01 00:12:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The answer is simple - set up another go-fund-me to raise money for any action Jeremy needs to bring against Labour for his reinstatement.  It is quite obvious that people want to donate to help him!
1322526949844099073 2020-10-31 21:12:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is rubbish.  It has been obvious that people were breaching the rules and a second wave was coming for ages!
1322526344954187776 2020-10-31 21:10:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I honestly can't understand how anyone can say this (or even think it) this man is the most useless cretin that has ever resided in London (let alone number 10 Downing Street. He makes the Cray Twins look innocent!
1322509327010246658 2020-10-31 20:02:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't think it is possible to 'Set people like this straight!" My mum voted Tory because she knew a wonderful Christian man who was a local Conservative Councillor. What she never understood was 'he was wonderful because of his faith. not because of his politics!"
1322503322176278531 2020-10-31 19:38:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I think this is a brilliant idea - If you text ‘SHOUT’ to 85258 when you are in a dark place or suicidal, a trained crisis volunteer will text you back. This is great. It’s completely free. Please RT you never know who might need this support
1322502638911557632 2020-10-31 19:36:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn has the support of hundreds of thousands of people in the UK &amp; even elsewhere in the world. He has become a focal point for people who want Democratic Socialism &amp; all the promises it brings. If Jeremy needs additional funds to fight he'll get them. From us with love
1322284059939250178 2020-10-31 05:07:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> #SteirCarmer is a forensic nobody
1322283306235404290 2020-10-31 05:04:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I heard a photographer told @jeremycorbyn about his suspension.  There is no acceptable excuse available to @Keir_Starmer. It was utterly disgusting of him to suspend JC and not personally phoning him was downright cowardly.  Yet again Jeremy proves he's the better man!
1322281837406900225 2020-10-31 04:58:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've told this story on here before but: when I started having Mental Health issues about 22 years ago my Evangelical Christian Church didn't even put me on their prayer list or visit me. In fact, it took them more than 18 months to come and see me. I was not very impressed!
1322280654789349379 2020-10-31 04:54:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am not so sure you are right and anyway people can leave in a few weeks if they want - After their vote has been counted!
1322279917137072129 2020-10-31 04:51:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> People leaving the Labour party over the suspension of @jeremycorbyn are playing straight into @Keir_Starmer's hands - The NEC elections are about to vote in a left-leaning NEC - Hence the suspension of JC
1322279324142182408 2020-10-31 04:48:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have come to hate the term 'forensic' when applied to #BoreStarmer he is a yes-man to the Johnson regime!
1322275302467317763 2020-10-31 04:32:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Labour Party: Reinstate Jeremy Corbyn - Sign the Petition!  https://t.co/ZXTfkWNjYs via @UKChange This is the second petition I've signed in the last half hour! can you please sign it too?
1322273051908722689 2020-10-31 04:23:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I feel sick just hearing this complete hypocrisy - 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
1322271274706571265 2020-10-31 04:16:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> With the government in crisis, this is no time for the Labour Party to turn on itself. We call for the immediate reinstatement of Jeremy Corbyn. #WeAreCorbyn Sign the petition:  https://t.co/HFwJPxxG5a I signed this. I'd very much appreciate it if you would too!
1322256283253280775 2020-10-31 03:17:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I believe we have to start with 'Educating the nation' on 'What Socialism IS &amp; What it is NOT.' We need to help people understand that many countries (including our own) have dabbled with socialism, some have had a form of socialism but none have had 'Real democratic Socialism'
1322252145241018369 2020-10-31 03:00:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Because @Keir_Starmer is seeking to undermine the Leftie win of the NEC elections which look set to win a majority. If this happens the right-wing will face resistance at every turn.
1322222093291933696 2020-10-31 01:01:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I reckon @Keir_Starmer has pulled a fast-one by suspending @jeremycorbyn he knows the Left Wing of the party is about to gain the upper hand in the NEC elections. If hundreds of Lefties leave the party the right might win - I hope people will wait until after they have voted!
1322147899552223232 2020-10-30 20:06:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> When a leader stands up &amp; declares war then less than 12 hours later makes a statement like: "I don't want a civil war" we should ask ourselves if he is a suitable person to lead. (Party or Nation) @Keir_Starmer is weak &amp; overly influenced by his affiliation with the Israeli's
1322146486956756992 2020-10-30 20:01:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> In a way, I have been fortunate - I was expelled from Labour years ago so I am not presented with this dilemma. If however, I was still a member (with voting rights) I'd stay at least until the current round of internal voting is over and @jeremycorbyn's situation is resolved!
1322139859138629632 2020-10-30 19:34:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Its the reason why I've stayed on the outside of the Labour Party while fighting from @jeremycorbyn's corner. I joined Labour for a short time but was expelled for allegedly saying something 'Anti-Semitic'. McNichol didn't even inform me which Tweet was the offending one.
1322137981260619784 2020-10-30 19:27:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That's the nature of the beast (cat), my cats do similar things to my neighbours, my cats have even made friends with their cat.
1321881582588825601 2020-10-30 02:28:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just read a tweet by @SKinnock (I hope that's the right (wing) one!) He said exactly the same thing in the second sentence!  They are sounding more Tory by the minute!
1321878399623770112 2020-10-30 02:15:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Another reason for me to love my wife! Butternut-squash and Butterbean pie - My wife made for our tea tonight - It was absolutely lovely.  https://t.co/hgK2FN1JjL
1321877933296918533 2020-10-30 02:13:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We need one - a @HateEverythingTory Hashtag!
1321861939392356352 2020-10-30 01:10:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I suspect most people who claim to hate socialism are afraid that if they find out they might agree with it and become as unpopular as us Lol
1321860428520169474 2020-10-30 01:04:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have been saying for some years - @jeremycorbyn is a better Christian than me and he doesn't even claim to be one!
1321848350015131654 2020-10-30 00:16:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I think this man needs to get a grip!  I was having a very strange nightmare a few nights ago (I have 3 or 3 a week) when my wife (being kind) tried to wake me I told her to "Piss off." I love my wife &amp; would never normally do that, I was 'in the dream' she didn't even notice!
1321846161054044161 2020-10-30 00:07:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have a list of wrongdoings, evils &amp; criminal offences committed by the Conservative Party. Islamophobia is the one most people are aware of.  I believe we should be talking about the cull of thousands of British Citizens after cheating themselves into power &amp; during COVID-19.
1321843708774461442 2020-10-29 23:57:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I know current members of the Labour Party will not be able to agree with this tweet, but @Keir_Starmer should be removed from office and prosecuted for treason. He is actively siding with a foreign (Israel) power and indirectly supporting the genocide of the Palestinian People.
1321841215155961856 2020-10-29 23:47:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am struggling to understand why @jeremycorbyn is staying in the Labour Party after the way he has been treated over the past 5 years culminating in today's suspension &amp; removal of the whip. I admire his determination to fight this decision by 'The Great Pretender' @Keir_Starmer
1321798806653046786 2020-10-29 20:59:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> that challenged the statements of others, often the worst abusive comments have come from people who hold positions within political parties. I've been attacked by Conservative MPs, UKIP Leaders, RightW party members/ officials &amp; right-leaning Labour MPs/members. Dredge the swamp
1321798805432504320 2020-10-29 20:59:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> to know that there have been many (probably tens of thousand) complaints of racism, anti-Palestinian, abusive comments about people of faith and/or religion, political abuse of individuals that disagree politically. I have been abused on quite a few occasions for expressing views
1321787802112196608 2020-10-29 20:15:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @Keir_Starmer is 'Pro-Zionist-Israel.  (as a result)  He is Anti-Palestinian!   IMHO this makes him 'Just as Bad' as people who are antisemites.  Anti-Semitism = hate &amp; persecution of the Jews Anti-Palestinian = Hate &amp; persecution of Palestinians.  Both are equally wrong.
1321554619819008003 2020-10-29 04:49:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yes!
1321553992024031234 2020-10-29 04:46:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @SyHawkes @WMerciaPolice Why is this tweet unavailable to me?
1321553068014608389 2020-10-29 04:42:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't believe it is possible to unite one purpose like that - unity of a nation is almost impossible to achieve with so many disputes, disagreements and injustices. The Tory government hasn't helped in this because they set our rules for regular people that they then break!
1321523125478182913 2020-10-29 02:44:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Growing Soya is in part what is causing the environmental disaster!
1321496453269901312 2020-10-29 00:58:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The hail stopped my work project (rebuilding my garage-roof-veg-garden) this afternoon the hail was literally bouncing half a metre up after it hit the roof. It really hurt my head as I dashed to tidy up my tools! 😬😬😬😲😲😲
1321493525662412801 2020-10-29 00:46:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My son travels 40 miles (one way) to do his care job - he receives nothing for his fuel etc. He does this journey about 4 or 5 times in 7 days that's an average of 360 miles per week. it takes over an hour to do this journey.
1321418518630404097 2020-10-28 19:48:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Divided &amp; haemorrhaging Leftist Labour Members. I find it really troubling that the Right and centre of the party got away with undermining @jeremycorbyn's leadership, lost us the last two elections and are now forcing so many to leave the party. @Keir_Starmer can't unite labour
1321405955234500608 2020-10-28 18:58:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> In my area, it isn't the full bins that cause a trip risk, but the emptied ones the recycling teams empty the bins &amp; then leave them scattered liberally wherever they see fit.  It's the same with recycling boxes.  I often have to collect up bits of recycling they've dropped too.
1321404759245492225 2020-10-28 18:53:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We bought a memory foam mattress topper from MemoryFoamWarehouse  https://t.co/COwULbXzuS Based in Wakefield. It was much cheaper than a mattress and it revived our old mattress which had very little padding - They sell mattresses to we recommend their service too.
1321402877802405891 2020-10-28 18:46:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Dan: surely the priority is to stop kids dying on the pelican crossing.  George: No the priority is to close down the cheap second-hand market building so people will be forced to buy goods in the supermarket where they have to pay full VAT.
1321187608077193224 2020-10-28 04:30:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Bless their generosity but O how things have changed in my lifetime.
1321185830229188608 2020-10-28 04:23:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Petition: End child food poverty – no child should be going hungry  https://t.co/DARYl9Kw47  When I was a child in the1950s, 60s &amp; early 70s I sometimes went a bit hungry, but we have kids in Tory Britain that are suffering from malnutrition - That's a something I never expected.
1321161693947416576 2020-10-28 02:47:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That brought tears to my eyes - I haven't laughed like that in a while!
1321160619144433664 2020-10-28 02:43:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Poverty isn't a fault in the people who are poor. It is a fault in the system, the government and the greedy rich and selfish tax-dodging wealthy.
1321159162823204865 2020-10-28 02:37:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Here is another good reason to get rid of the Tory Parties Hostile Environment -  Listen to this!  https://t.co/irTrxYxXfO
1321124959213813765 2020-10-28 00:21:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> 10 points for following 10 points for sitting 10 points for eye-contact  nil points for jumping!
1321053985206390784 2020-10-27 19:39:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am really pleased to see you on Twitter this morning, I was really concerned the other day by one of your Tweets. You said you were "Going for a long walk". I won't ask if you are OK because you clearly aren't. If you want to talk about anything privately DM me. I won't preach!
1320787324482031617 2020-10-27 02:00:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Because animals have legal rights to be fed and apparently Humans don't!
1320778563101073410 2020-10-27 01:25:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> A few years ago we (Foster Parents) arrived at the Family centre with three children we were caring for contact with their birth family - on entry, we were informed that the family centre had to cut costs so had scrapped the orange squash and biscuit they provided to every child!
1320670911998107648 2020-10-26 18:17:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Tory methodology: They get informed about a 'need' for more money to be spent on an issue faced by the poor. Tories 'pay a friend' millions to research the issue.  Poor Hopeful!  Tories read the report.  Poor wait!  Tories cut funding for the highlighted 'need' (no money left!
1320667517971537922 2020-10-26 18:04:07 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> What a horrible, detestable and abhorrent woman she is!
1320468753201745922 2020-10-26 04:54:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I reckon a lot of MPs claim the cost of food on their expenses. They buy and claim for groceries while away from home then eat (on expenses) takeaways &amp; restaurants then take the 'Groceries' home at the weekend for their families. Another con we're paying for! Cheating Tory scum!
1320466823083626504 2020-10-26 04:46:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> With what shall they feed them. The Tories have created the conditions that have made it nearly impossible to survive in this country. I'm among the caring people who pick up the pieces of families so deprived of the means feed their own children. Free meals cost next to nothing
1320464248456290308 2020-10-26 04:36:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Surely that is nobody else's business but their own. We already have a government that is planning to look at claimants bank accounts to see how they spend their benefits.  I am the grandfather of kids who live with their mum my son gives everything he can afford + some he can't
1320458593469108224 2020-10-26 04:13:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> we need to fight for Human Rights (Every Humans Rights!) That would encapsulate women's rights too!
1320457715077054464 2020-10-26 04:10:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Oh, how I wish! I have it in both ears. Its constant hissing whistle is at-best a distraction at worst it is so annoying I could scream with frustration (sometimes do). I've tried all sorts to stop the incessant swish-swish, phut-phut &amp; I often miss hear what people say to me too
1320455992933556231 2020-10-26 04:03:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No - I detest the program!
1320455855939166209 2020-10-26 04:03:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Thanks for the heads-up!
1320455318409760770 2020-10-26 04:00:55 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You are a star! (I rarely say that about anyone!) I am still spitting bricks that the Tories have done this to UK kids though!
1320454083233357830 2020-10-26 03:56:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My goodness me! I thought the UK was going to drop off the bottom - I'd like to see one of these showing a comparison with the EU rather than individual EU countries.
1320452886887911425 2020-10-26 03:51:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Trump - "No dearest the X goes in the box next to my name!"
1320450296485732360 2020-10-26 03:40:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> mentioned washing up liquid, washing powder, soap to clean up after meals (kids are messy). I find these so-called experts exasperating. Has any of them ever been poor with a couple of kids? I very much doubt it. I have and it's a full-time job just feeding them. @FEEDALLUKKIDS
1320450295256797185 2020-10-26 03:40:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The cost of this .33p meal is still rising. Even if we say one family dinner = £5 per day, comes to £35 per week. Children (and adults) need more than one meal a day. Even on the cheapest diet, it's going to cost bout £15 per day £105 per week on food &amp; cooking. We haven't even
1320450293520343040 2020-10-26 03:40:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Also what if you have a family of four kids? (and don't anyone bother telling me "If you can't afford to feed them, you shouldn't have them!" You can't send them back!) .33p X by 4 = £1.32 + your own food x2 if you are a couple .66p=£1.98 + electric/Gas + bus fair to supermarket.
1320444859539476487 2020-10-26 03:19:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Yes!
1320444731701211136 2020-10-26 03:18:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I suppose you (or Ralph) thinks this is funny?  Personally, I think it is a tragedy.  800-year-old trees - destroyed for a vanity project that no one except the wealthy will be able to afford!  HS2 should be stopped!
1320441383497420800 2020-10-26 03:05:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have just spent 10 minutes reading a load of Tweets about Sy Hawkes Rose. I read his tweet from earlier &amp; am concerned about his safety. This long chain of Tweets seemed more interested in the Troll than Sy. So I am asking my followers - Has anyone heard if Sy is OK.
1320433982643806208 2020-10-26 02:36:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Many people make such claims. to my knowledge, no one has proved it and got their children to eat stew.
1320433403599196162 2020-10-26 02:33:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Nobody thought it would be the end of democracy, but when the Conservative party came to office this was their aim.
1320422202718801922 2020-10-26 01:49:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> COVID-19 – Is being used by Government to push through Legislation, complete HS2, Brexit, Relax Planning Rules, Access Private Bank Accounts of Benefit Claimants. The Tory Government is out of control.  Never Trust A Tory!
1320422201414352899 2020-10-26 01:49:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> HS2 – Destroying Ancient Forests Brexit – Paved over paradise to put up a (Lorry) parking lot.  Planning Laws – Tories propose a free-for-all of Build, Build, Build.  Government propose to Check Claimants Bank – How You Spend Your Money?
1320419404606296064 2020-10-26 01:38:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is so unacceptable - worse than any proposal that has ever been suggested before. I have never heard of any government in the world who has proposed this.
1320418552134946816 2020-10-26 01:34:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> They paved over paradise and put up a parking lot!
1320416480589172736 2020-10-26 01:26:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> HS2 is not needed HS2 is not wanted HS2 is the wrong solution to the issue of movement of people in the UK. HS2 is destroying ancient forest habitats.  HS2 is not going to be used by ordinary people.  HS2 is VANITY for the wealthy.  Stop HS2!
1320412368183136257 2020-10-26 01:10:15 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Let's get this trending.  Empty Plates!
1320410957160583168 2020-10-26 01:04:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I only just came on Twitter. I only just saw your tweet. I hope and pray you haven't done what you implied in this tweet. Trolls are evil.  They should be ignored and blocked.  I know it's hard but you are worth so much more than these troll idiots.  If you are OK? Talk to me! I
1320407362155536389 2020-10-26 00:50:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This needs to go nationwide. Every Tory MPs house, ever Conservative (Anti) Social club and Office. And every other MPs house that voted to take the food from children's mouths - Make SHAME A TORY TYPE! Should be MandaTORY!
1320054892711600129 2020-10-25 01:29:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> UK Parliament: End taxpayer-subsidized meals for MPs - Sign the Petition!  https://t.co/mCTEMVhl94 via @UKChange  I have said for years that it's immoral for MPs to get subsidised meals while there is one child in Britain hungry now the Tories have taken food out of kids mouths!🤢
1319926992872083456 2020-10-24 17:01:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Just block and report them - don't allow them to influence your thinking. I don't allow them on my feed! Are you able to get counselling? I really hope so.  I have been fortunate because my Prostate Cancer has opened the 'counselling door' for me and it is helping me a lot.
1319925094840401920 2020-10-24 16:54:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> They don't mind using these services themselves, do they? but that's different isn't it?
1319924677955981312 2020-10-24 16:52:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> One aisle for Halloween and the next aisle for Christmas - Commercialism Rampant!
1319924257300860928 2020-10-24 16:50:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> They paved over paradise and put up a parking lot!
1318993453544558595 2020-10-22 03:11:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I sometimes went hungry as a child because my mum depended on benefits and free school meals for us children but that was in the 1960s and 1970s. I do not believe it is acceptable in the 21 century for kids to face governmental neglect. Think - If a parent starved their children?
1318991491251961858 2020-10-22 03:04:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If you were nearer to me I'd have you do some work for me. Sadly you are too far away.
1318990956306325509 2020-10-22 03:02:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> MPs have subsidised meals and alcohol in the House of Commons, while working, but can't allocate money for free school meals for hungry school children? I just don't believe it! Pure selfishness!
1318941636680966144 2020-10-21 23:46:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Without Tory rule, the other two wouldn't have happened.
1318856470289666048 2020-10-21 18:07:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My heart is literally beating out of my chest with worry for this young lassie. Those who know me on Twitter will understand why. I will be praying for her safe return. She needs to be home and safe.
1317880961716129795 2020-10-19 01:31:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I would - NewZealand!
1317553484431020038 2020-10-18 03:50:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This woman is wonderful!  Just think we could have had a PM like her with @jeremycorbyn  How I wish we did!
1317552159404314624 2020-10-18 03:44:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> How do you get Pikachu onto a bus - Pokemon. Poke -him-on!
1317422630245457920 2020-10-17 19:10:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Number one!  Himself!
1316821744037101568 2020-10-16 03:22:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is a brilliant explanation of Mental Health sufferers reality. Please watch and retweet.
1316696802595405824 2020-10-15 19:05:55 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> does anyone have a copy of the advert for this job?
1316469778371018754 2020-10-15 04:03:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> A horror story clown.
1316428128311562246 2020-10-15 01:18:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Do you have any preexisting health conditions like asthma? If so they have to give you a free one - I work with children and young people so I am doubly entitled to one. If you work with the elderly they do too.
1316106201118187522 2020-10-14 03:59:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I often joke, "my name is David King but you may call me Sire, or Your Highness!"
1316104449337757707 2020-10-14 03:52:07 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Listen to music - watch something silly on the telly or have a hot shower/bath. I recommend Faulty Towers or The Good Life on Youtube.
1316092818205609984 2020-10-14 03:05:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am worried about the state of the mental health of Siblings, Parents &amp; Grand Parents when their beloved brothers &amp; sisters, children/grandchildren, catch CoronaVirus &amp; die. As a grandparent would be devastated if I lost one of my kin to COVID-19 as I'm sure others have been.
1316087014249435136 2020-10-14 02:42:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> However do they know when it was born - did they ask it? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1316053479971074050 2020-10-14 00:29:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> How is it that he thought thy had control in the first place? Anyone with any understanding of the political situation in the UK could see the Tories were steering the ship at full steam toward the twin rocks of COVID-19 and fantasy Island Brexit.
1316052013248118784 2020-10-14 00:23:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree it is far too late for @Keir_Starmer to start claiming he is opposed the Government. He let that Ship sail along with thousands of lives and the left-wing of the Labour Party.
1316051093554688000 2020-10-14 00:20:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Too late!  That Ship Sailed!
1316050800733454337 2020-10-14 00:18:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The government isn't sentient either!
1316045695288254464 2020-10-13 23:58:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> After the defeat (the way @jeremycorbyn was steamrollered by the anti-socialism wing was utterly unforgivable) of Labour at the last election, I am finding it hard to find anything positive in politics. Even the wins seem like baby steps after the dream manifestos of 2017 &amp;2019.
1316044173808668672 2020-10-13 23:52:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I ticked yes, but I never had any faith in @BorisJohnson. In fact, I have no faith in the Tories or the house of commons. I'm 63 years old and the HOC has screwed me over throughout my life @jeremycorbyn was my one and only political hero &amp; the media &amp; the HOC screwed him too.
1315992604862021635 2020-10-13 20:27:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You can't fix child poverty with one hand in the pot  Donations to the poor should be for the poor!
1315665756194058240 2020-10-12 22:48:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Left unused - most have never been used.
1315660782110158849 2020-10-12 22:29:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It made me think of the song🎶 "Tiers of a clown"🎶 With Jonson as the clown.
1315643343997726721 2020-10-12 21:19:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It isn't retraining the PM &amp; MPs need it's some sort of training to do the job they are already failing to do right. Anyone in any other profession would be dismissed if they demonstrated such utter contempt and incompetence. If I was caught lying like Johnson does I'd be sacked.
1315642043239223298 2020-10-12 21:14:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Contact and trace personnel have been told not to track and or trace cases connected to schools. (Does this include college and universities)  Schools are probably the highest risk group after the care and medical staff and patients.
1315322141399830528 2020-10-12 00:03:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Neither, they are both pathetic!
1315261148313378816 2020-10-11 20:01:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have so many other commitments/responsibilities that writing about this issue has to wait for my retirement. I may find the time and emotional strength to write a blog or maybe a book! I think anything I write will be broader than just this one issue though. Injustice is rife!
1315227674709839872 2020-10-11 17:48:08 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Tory Government never had control of anything - they were faking it from day one (10 years ago)
1315226648254377985 2020-10-11 17:44:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree, but to get too deeply into the reasons why I think the church misunderstands the idea that Christians can experience depression and anxiety would take a major book-length explanation to suffice to say they are very suspicious of MH issues and avoid people with them.
1315022242779222018 2020-10-11 04:11:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My work (see my profile) doesn't help my situation either (female-dominated work) and I've always made friends with women more easily. I always say this is as a result of being raised in a mostly female home 5 sisters and mum with just one brother. I'd be happy to chat about MHI.
1315022241202044929 2020-10-11 04:11:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have a similar problem, I have lost a lot of friends (Church Friends) because of my Depression and Anxiety. They just don't understand how a committed Christian can have Mental Health Problems. I often feel very lonely for a friend - my only true friend died about 5 years ago.
1315011674697498624 2020-10-11 03:29:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is a bloody disgrace!
1314155690227834880 2020-10-08 18:48:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> No amount of money would entice me to vote Tory!
1313800313921572864 2020-10-07 19:16:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is yet another sign that our empire is crumbling, falling into the abyss, going the way of all the mighty empires of history. When a country states. "We care nothing for the children, the elderly, the sick or the homeless." The End Is Near, and Now Is at Hand! We foster too!
1313798235786444802 2020-10-07 19:08:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> "There are none so blind as they who will not see!"  The truth is that there is only one thing that kept the Tories in power.  Votes! What caused people to vote for the Tories?  Tory and right-wing propaganda.  Delivered by the whole establishment.
1313081697798414336 2020-10-05 19:40:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He may not come from a 'privileged background.'  but he has (in my opinion) forgotten the rock from whence he was hewed and the hole from where he was dug! His title and the esteem with which he (and others) hold him/self is misplaced and undeserved. He has become 'Establishment'
1313080230857371648 2020-10-05 19:34:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If I may, I'll add - The Tories under Boris Johnson are 'one massive glitch in the matrix.' We have been in the Twilight Zone for 10+ years!
1312783556972892161 2020-10-04 23:56:04 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just signed this petition and sent a strongly worded email to my MP (David Morris - Conservative) I will tweet his reply if I receive one.
1312485957971570688 2020-10-04 04:13:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> So Twitter why did you allow people to abuse @jeremycorbyn for 4 years with little or no reactions, banns, or post removals. Jeremy is a decent bloke and Trump is a champion village idiot.
1312441052016472065 2020-10-04 01:15:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Please could any 2 of my followers just copy and repost? This pandemic is especially hard for people with depression.  Samaritans 116 123  Just two. Any two. Say done.  I have Depression and Anxiety!   DONE!
1312406825963335680 2020-10-03 22:59:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> bees!
1312349734443548672 2020-10-03 19:12:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> once in power, some (many) people will say anything to keep their power. It's addictive!
1312323408848392193 2020-10-03 17:27:37 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> An echo of a drum beating. The sound of an empty stomach growling or an old man breaking wind.  The reverberation of a riotous mob.  And the clamour of fools debating foolishness.
1311758782825889792 2020-10-02 04:03:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking>  https://t.co/nekpseLw4A
1311758353555746817 2020-10-02 04:02:17 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Sorry to disappoint you but it's not a hummingbird - it's a hummingbird moth
1311757206765875200 2020-10-02 03:57:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> 1958 - Davey Crocket. I cried all the way through the first 15 minutes and we got evicted from the 'Chandos Cinema in Buckingham. But I was only about 18 months old, it was my mum that wanted to see the film.
1311607370670366721 2020-10-01 18:02:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Rotting corpses
1311303252084957187 2020-09-30 21:53:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Before we 'believe' ANYTHING. We need first to 'understand.' COVID-19 Rules in the UK are Incomprehensible, Inconsistent, unintelligible and contradictory. Nobody can live by such rules. Even calling them 'Rules' is a sick joke!
1311250423265792010 2020-09-30 18:23:57 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Working Class is no longer represented in the UK. We must first redefine what Working Class means then look beyond political ideology to find the answer to the problems faced by 'working people!' We need to have equal rights to life, health, wage, food, votes &amp; human rights.
1311014205198401538 2020-09-30 02:45:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The comment "I want it gone!" or worse "I want Gone!" in for sale columns is one that makes me want to scream, "I worked damned hard to learn how to speak and write good English and 'So-called' educated people do this to our language!
1311011990672945152 2020-09-30 02:36:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He is quite duplistic in what he stands for.  1. He stands for @Keir_Starmer  2. He stands for Israel.  I'm not sure which comes first, it's a bit like the chicken and the egg puzzle!
1310531472479092737 2020-09-28 18:47:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That theme runs through the Bible - In the New Testament there are a couple of parables that clearly tell how G-d views the rich (especially the rich rulers who abuse the regular citizens)
1310287155793719301 2020-09-28 02:36:16 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> number 1 it looks 'easy to maintain' and could be made to run on green energy. It looks to have plenty of space for a veg garden and a workshop for me to fettle in.  I'd choose number 4 if I was younger but I'm getting near to retiring at 63, so it'd be number 1.
1310284700666167299 2020-09-28 02:26:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> If you told me the sky was blue and the grass was green I'd have to go outside to check for myself!
1310283043303837696 2020-09-28 02:19:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I just wish Her Royal Highness had a 'Dishonours List' too she could include about ten people each year to be exiled from public life. People like Tony Blair, Keir Starmer, Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson, Domoneq Cummings, Teresa May and Boris Johnson for starters.
1310192066954133508 2020-09-27 20:18:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is but one of the injustices that are easily identified being allowed/committed by our so-called  'Government.'  They have failed to provide for so many in our country. COVID, Brexit, HS2, Job losses, homelessness and so much more, so badly handled!
1310186203522707457 2020-09-27 19:55:07 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> for Fantasy Island!
1310181422372708352 2020-09-27 19:36:07 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've signed the petition calling for the government to scrap plans to expand police stop and search powers. Will you add your name? https://t.co/iwYDOSux3F
1309887209198231555 2020-09-27 00:07:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This Tory Government deliberately does this to everything they set up - every policy. They have created (recreated) the historic 'Class System.' Welcome to Victorian England 21C.
1309566713592262666 2020-09-26 02:53:29 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My all-time favourite sitcom -
1309498806556389377 2020-09-25 22:23:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't know how you can possibly know this. Whenever anyone talks about Labour winning new votes the speaker never gives any information about who they have interviewed, surveyed or even mean by their speculative claim. To me, they sound like guesswork. Where is their evidence
1309497382728536064 2020-09-25 22:17:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We (The Left) weren't sabotaged by the left er were sabotaged by the Right Wing that has infiltrated the Labour Party and undermined the brilliant Leadership team and @jeremycorbyn
1309446355404967938 2020-09-25 18:55:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is the second such involvement of a religious group (Sect) in Governmental structures I've read about this week.
1309221112589561856 2020-09-25 04:00:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> maybe this will help?  https://t.co/oCPrkWnyYQ
1309216863805677571 2020-09-25 03:43:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't have a smartphone &amp; will not buy a 'Crap Apple' we must have had 15 or 16 of them in this house in 13 years. (various foster kids) cost us a fortune in purchase &amp; repair. none of them worked right and broke too easily. Designed to Smash easily' should be their add slogan.
1309215118228631554 2020-09-25 03:36:22 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I agree, Art, people who panic buy once will do it again!
1309079599075262464 2020-09-24 18:37:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I can't - I don't even own a 'smart-phone!' I've no use for one and it's an avoidable expense.
1309077334205628419 2020-09-24 18:28:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> They are either totally incompetent or they are doing this intentionally. Even complete imbeciles get things right occasionally the Tories never get things right!
1309076081090199553 2020-09-24 18:23:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've tried to talk to both types. It's so damned frustrating! The main problem seems to be that (outside of the Socialist camp) there is absolutely no understanding of what 'Socialism' is! We need a free online '21st C Socialism course' to educate the masses.
1309074473518354434 2020-09-24 18:17:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I know.  I know I'm biased, but my son is 38 and the loveliest and kindest man. He is very clever too, he has been asked by his church during the DOVID-19 crisis to assist non-techy people to learn how to video-chat online. He runs group sessions to di this. Dyslexia! no problem!
1309072178927800330 2020-09-24 18:08:23 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The man is a fool!  My son was on a date with a 'very nice' young lady. All was going well until 'out of the blue' she said (I quote) "Sorry, you're too dyslexic for me!" with that she stood up and walked out of the restaurant, leaving my son very embarrassed and paying for two.
1308845497688485888 2020-09-24 03:07:38 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You Just HAVE to watch this!  Plank Of The Week with Mike Graham (22nd September 2020)  https://t.co/kqeGo2tS6y via @FacebookWatch
1308824847183740928 2020-09-24 01:45:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I did say 'I suggest' I never claimed it was a fact! Lol
1308822962825560064 2020-09-24 01:38:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I suggest it may be they wear glasses and need to see where they are going and can't when they have a mask covering their nose. This is a serious issue for people who already have problems seeing due to age-related degeneration of their vision. Maybe have some compassion to them
1308815082760089605 2020-09-24 01:06:46 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I have had the heating on about five or six times since the 7th of September. My foster Daughter asked for it to be put on this afternoon she's feeling cold, I hope she isn't coming down with something.
1308777323399966721 2020-09-23 22:36:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Are they talking about @BorisJohnson? Boris Johnson the biggest black hole for lives of ordinary people, taxpayers money and all the things we hold dear!
1308500247526637568 2020-09-23 04:15:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @jeremycorbyn Jeremy should challenge him -
1308451791164538881 2020-09-23 01:03:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> So: Socialism Now! Will @BorisJohnson do more of it? It's amazing isn't it Tories have already implemented many of your policies and @Keir_Starmer seems to be against them. Politics is a strange fish to catch sometimes.
1307694890424438784 2020-09-20 22:55:32 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Sorry to hear of your loss!
1307405930812801029 2020-09-20 03:47:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> My mum used to pick up cigarette packets to mend her shoes, as she walked the 10 miles (round trip) to the nearest town (in all weathers) to get our weekly shopping, (for her and 7 kids) pushing a pram often with two children in it &amp; about 100kgs of food etc.
1307352969218789379 2020-09-20 00:16:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Who in the Government is connected to the Plymouth Brethren sect? This sounds like another case of 'people claiming to be Christians' getting tangled up in right-wing politics. A lot of Nazis claimed to be Christians.  I am not against Christians in politics but what's happening
1306909697493041157 2020-09-18 18:55:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I don't care what other people say. I believe it is disgusting, foolish &amp; wholly unacceptable. It's not humorous, it's horrendous. Anyone engaging in such acts should be prosecuted for provoking acts of violence. I'm not a violent man, but I'd make an exception with these 'Men?'
1306904785396928512 2020-09-18 18:35:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> While virtually the whole of Lancashire is under threat of a second 'Lock-Down!' this is the Headline?
1306903656877391872 2020-09-18 18:31:27 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There is no GOVERNMENT it's just an illusion!   In those days everyone did what they thought was right in their opinion, disobedience &amp; lawlessness were rife &amp; even those who were appointed to govern pursued their own pleasure &amp; financial profit ahead of their duty.  Judges 17:6!
1306888250636763138 2020-09-18 17:30:14 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I wouldn't give this man the time of day let-alone 10K to ask a question. He promised the earth and gave nothing to our school saving appeal. @labourskerton @SkertonJanet Skerton
1306670241125105665 2020-09-18 03:03:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There are 65,000,000 people in the UK. even if we all only want or need one test that's a hell of a lot of tests, some people will need a number of rests due to the nature of their job or health condition. So yes I expected the demand to be high!
1306556417218883586 2020-09-17 19:31:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Heading my list is @jeremycorbyn. followed by a number of Labour Left MPs and sadly ex-MPs followed by just about anyone randomly selected from any left-leaning member of the public. I believe we currently have the most unsuitable person in the office of PM in UK history.
1306230896836648961 2020-09-16 21:58:09 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> There are very few devils, daemons in hell they all hold office in governments around the world.
1306228813018419205 2020-09-16 21:49:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The slushy machine probably did as much good as an 'anti-bacterial' hand sanitizer does against a 'virus!'
1306186493891928064 2020-09-16 19:01:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I'm a 63-year-old man. I came to computing &amp; technology fairly late in life, yet even I know to 'back up' important documents on an external hard drive or cloud. Was the loss of these files was intentional? Maybe.  was the loss due to carelessness?  Yes!  They couldn't care less!
1305576250505822208 2020-09-15 02:36:49 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> A doodad or a doodah, a thingamajig, a watzit, or an ikisnargler.
1305565219758931968 2020-09-15 01:52:59 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It was always a toss-up between Dwain Eddy and Hank Marvin for me - I loved José Feliciano too!
1305443249327411206 2020-09-14 17:48:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> cut the bottom off, recycle as a tin can. the tube can be recycled as cardboard, and the lid recycled as plastic. I think companies making and using packaging that can't be or are difficult to recycle should be charged a 'sanction' per item (2p) until they change their packaging.
1305235720961953792 2020-09-14 04:03:40 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Twitter folk are lovely! I hope you are OK!
1305231022100041737 2020-09-14 03:45:00 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> A cardboard box usually works a treat!
1305228472298725378 2020-09-14 03:34:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> "Collective punishment!" It was first done by the British Forces in Palestine between 1936 and 1939 the Israeli army carries on and expanded the idea ever since they established 'Israel?' in 1948.
1305227469964881920 2020-09-14 03:30:53 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Absolutely Disgusting! I'm just reading "Ten Myths About Israel, by Ilan Pappe on Kindle. He said. "During the great Arab uprising 1936-1939 Pro-Zionist British forces demolished 2,000 homes as collective punishment." Israel is copying Britain when they do this sort of thing.
1305225072362360834 2020-09-14 03:21:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We don't have a government We have a Misrulement a Mismanagement and a Misgovernment.
1305221622006272001 2020-09-14 03:07:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Why are we still calling this rabble a government?
1305221251967979520 2020-09-14 03:06:10 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @BorisJohnson Johnson is rapidly becoming a serious contender for the worst national leader in the world!
1305220578006138883 2020-09-14 03:03:30 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> why are you having a go at @jeremycorbyn he isn't the leader of the Labour Party anymore and he isn't the leader of the opposition either. @Keir_Starmer has made it clear by his actions that he wants the Labour Left gone! I remember when he wanted a 'Broad Church Party' he lied!
1305218579718172674 2020-09-14 02:55:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> turning our democracy into a dictatorship
1305212198571180041 2020-09-14 02:30:12 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Give it to someone who had sour grapes?
1305111826687025152 2020-09-13 19:51:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> At the same time this 'Government?' has proposed placing 'Life means Life! sentences on 18-year-old murderers. arguing that 18-year-olds should serve 'life with no parole' if they commit murder. At 18-y-o the human brain isn't fully mature. (Johnson's brain is defective!')
1305110146008395776 2020-09-13 19:44:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> These (So-called) wildfires are the result of humanities callous disregard for and exploitation of the beautiful world which God created for all his creatures to share and enjoy. God has not abandoned us, we abandoned him and his guidance!
1305108295477342209 2020-09-13 19:37:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> GRACE = God's Riches At Christ's Expense!
1304718609093193728 2020-09-12 17:48:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He has never been 'In Control' - if anyone wants proof just look at his life history etc.
1304470712908951553 2020-09-12 01:23:48 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> As many people as possible should start working from home - oh wait - COVID-19!
1304113371298570240 2020-09-11 01:43:51 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Deadly?
1304112889532473345 2020-09-11 01:41:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You'll be shooting birds who sh1t on your windows before long because nobody is controlling their behaviour!
1304110016815915009 2020-09-11 01:30:31 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I really do not understand why people discriminate against Autistic Spectrum Children - (I don't understand discrimination) when our sons were children they often made friends with these kids they are often the best at 'being faithful friends' - That's what my lads told me anyway
1304101564102082560 2020-09-11 00:56:56 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> He has too much self-confidence in my opinion (over Confidence)
1304098789184221186 2020-09-11 00:45:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Since the world developed parliament?
1304010870285127681 2020-09-10 18:56:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Lack of accountability. It is a serious concern of mine that Government, Lords, MP, Councilors, diplomats and civil servants must be held accountable for their decisions and actions. Like the rest of us are.
1304009863798886400 2020-09-10 18:52:33 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Highly likely in our region (NorthWest England)
1304009397748760579 2020-09-10 18:50:42 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It should be against the rules for MPs to create and/or join groups that divide their allegiance to the public they swear to serve. I believe MPs should dedicate to their duties as an MP. No Second Jobs, no Friends of Xx country etc.
1304008159376412672 2020-09-10 18:45:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Successive British Governments have lied to the British People with regard to the EU. Anything these govts thought the people wouldn't like they blamed the EU.
1303788019741331457 2020-09-10 04:11:01 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> @LFI should be illegal - these people are betraying and condemning Palestine to Israeli genocide.
1303787457343782912 2020-09-10 04:08:47 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The Tories are now culling children and teenagers!
1303774760434835456 2020-09-10 03:18:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Should that be 'Ruin Britannia?' The Tories are trying very hard to destroy her!
1303772054936842252 2020-09-10 03:07:35 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I seem to remember him making a commitment to break international law (or was that one of the other Tory numpties?
1303771324410728449 2020-09-10 03:04:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> It isn't real, it's a soap opera.
1303770948722622465 2020-09-10 03:03:11 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I would like him to leave the UK. He is a Yobbo in a suit!
1303770319711350784 2020-09-10 03:00:41 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> how did she not? My experience of hearing Carole suggested she was speaking truth into all sorts of other issues of the day (during @jeremycorbyn leadership) I don't think I heard her speak against him, or for any other political party.
1303769498097516545 2020-09-10 02:57:25 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I am a remainer and I don't understand your logic! @Keir_Starmer backtracking on his promise is utterly abhorrent to me. We need politicians of all persuasions to speak the truth, live by their promises and stop the constant backstabbing. I am still .100% behind @jeremycorbyn
1303767841427066880 2020-09-10 02:50:50 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Serco is in it for the money - I put the blame squarely in the lap of the people/person who is to blame - Boris (cuffuffle) Johnson and his unruly rabble.
1303625120293023744 2020-09-09 17:23:43 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Meantime this same government is telling us that we must obey the laws they set for us on COVID-19 social distancing? Anybody else questioning their right or efficacy applying their 'rule of law' on us? It's like a parent telling their kid 'Say no to drugs' while snorting coke!
1303046847196540928 2020-09-08 03:05:52 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The only Tory worth listening to.
1303043546618961921 2020-09-08 02:52:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> This is really good news!
1302985750976307200 2020-09-07 23:03:05 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> We need an online school of socialism teaching the 'History of Socialism', How socialism has developed, how &amp; why attempts at socialism have been unsuccessful (Top-down rather than grassroots-led) &amp; how 21st Century socialism would give a firm basis for business/commerce.
1302912832007274498 2020-09-07 18:13:20 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The outbreak in France is proof, if proof was needed, that it's too soon for schools to reopen anywhere! COVID-19 is deadly, why is that so hard for capitalists to understand?  The operation was a success but the patient died!
1302655198159134723 2020-09-07 01:09:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> now that's just so weird! I was just singing Casie Jones theme tune to my 8-year-old grandson because he was wearing a cap that looked like an American Train Engineers cap. Are you able to see into my house too?
1302615296923107333 2020-09-06 22:31:02 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> why do we still call this shambolic rabble 'The Government?' they are incapable of such a complexed operation.
1302553435431211009 2020-09-06 18:25:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> or a table tennis ball. The trick is to become your kittens best playmate. We did this with our two 8-year-old cats &amp; they still play like kittens, eat from my fingertips and sit on command. The other choice is to get an adult cat that has already been treated as described above.
1302553433799524352 2020-09-06 18:25:13 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You have two choices. Get a kitten and spend as much time as you can playing with it, stroking it, allowing it to explore your house and sitting on your lap, you can teach it things like eating 'Dreamies' from your fingertips, sit and fetch and chasing a piece of screwed up paper
1302548319709933570 2020-09-06 18:04:54 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The top of the pay chart people make the rules - this is why @jeremycorbyn was and still is correct in believing that we need a Truly Socialist 'from the grassroots up' system of government. The will of the many determining the wealth of the few!
1302267270199160833 2020-09-05 23:28:06 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> and you think capitalism is saving the world! Utter madness - Neoliberal capitalism is killing millions worldwide every year.  It is also creating a group of people who own %99.9 of the world's wealth. Socialism is for the many, not that% .01.  Greedy bastards!
1302265922820997128 2020-09-05 23:22:45 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Research it for yourself! you will be amazed
1302265726410133504 2020-09-05 23:21:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That describes neoliberalism.
1302265495463354370 2020-09-05 23:21:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> That's not socialism! That aptly describes capitalism!
1302264553464565760 2020-09-05 23:17:19 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Perhaps reading the whole thread would help you not jump to the conclusion that I (or the left) actually want 'Free stuff' I think everyone acknowledges that nothing is actually free - the right want everything to be paid for by the likes of us. The Left and working people!
1302213287115919365 2020-09-05 19:53:36 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Prosperity for all
1302198533865570304 2020-09-05 18:54:58 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> You have demonstrated over years passed, that you are reliable and honest. You have clear evidence that you had COVID-19 and are still experiencing the after-effects.  A bloke makes unfounded accusations?  If people believe him over you - they are behaving totally irrationally
1301923914487083013 2020-09-05 00:43:44 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Idiots all!
1301921825220370433 2020-09-05 00:35:26 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> The right want free stuff too! the difference is they just want the free stuff for themselves - we Lefties want free stuff for everyone!
1301603786528567302 2020-09-04 03:31:39 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I've often wondered if humans adding weight to the moon have changed its orbit?  We have put lots of material (rockets, probes, satellites) into space, has this made the world lighter and changes its orbit.
1301568742888005632 2020-09-04 01:12:24 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> does anyone know how many trees have been felled? I want someone to find out how many trees have been cut down &amp; how many ancient forests have been destroyed so this unneeded, pointless HS2 white elephant can be built?
1301566463430594562 2020-09-04 01:03:21 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I can't say I've noticed his doing anything outstanding!
1301562676896825344 2020-09-04 00:48:18 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Clearly not so good with words, spelling or English though! It took me a while to understand his WWW.
1301562002008088578 2020-09-04 00:45:37 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> Has anyone got any idea what is going on in the world (or even the UK) in recent weeks I have been deflected and redirected so many times I have totally lost track of what is going on? I heard JRM played Rule Britannia in the HOC but otherwise - Nothing!
1301483089353465858 2020-09-03 19:32:03 +0800 <Davidgeorgeking> I heard a while ago that a new petitions committee should have been set up by Johnson's Government - I haven't heard whether it was actually formed - if this is the case then petitions are just stockpiling in a locked room of a dark cellar on an uninhabited planet in outer space
