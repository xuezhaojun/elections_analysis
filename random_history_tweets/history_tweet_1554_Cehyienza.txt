1343573283019530240 2020-12-28 23:03:27 +0800 <Cehyienza> @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr will it require a lawsuit like the families of immigrants had to to have adult disabled dependents (whom essentially in IRS eyes is considered children)  to be made eligible for the stimulus. Disbaled non dependent adults are receiving it! FIX THIS!

Also adult disbaled non dependent recieved it as well.

1343393284102615041 2020-12-28 11:08:12 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Jennuhlyn25 @CEOGIVEBACK Or as what some saud happened to them by jamal he didn't out any money in came back said he couldn't do tranfer then layer when the guy had $1000 his his account jamal was still connected and took that ,$100. With so many direct oahment options available there's no need for bank
1343392697470480384 2020-12-28 11:05:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Jennuhlyn25 @CEOGIVEBACK My guess is there gonna log in to the account and make mobile check deposits for fake bogus checks then transfers part of funds to them selfs and leave a part to make it look like they helped but then a couple weeks later bank finds the fake check and takes full amount from u

1343384040401903617 2020-12-28 10:31:28 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MirandinaRajada @bethswindow @RepKatiePorter He won't even get the money adult dependents dont get stimulus even if disbaled adult dependents its bull shit and honestly we should join together and file a law suit especially for disbaled adult dependents as there in IRS eyes the equivalent as children
1343382047012732928 2020-12-28 10:23:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> @viiicctoriaaaa @tenacityskin Thanks hun a few I only ask as a few times I wanted to tag my hubby of close friends and to ask questions etc and Twitter wouldn't let me comment on some posts much appricated.
1343381806909857792 2020-12-28 10:22:36 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CEOGIVEBACK to never provide a credit card to claim a prize and never accept a check payment for giveaway (some of these mimicking scammers are also trying to  do check scams) and to never give out your online banking information or wire money to any one online that you don't know.
1343381481863872512 2020-12-28 10:21:18 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CEOGIVEBACK Then the orginal real accounts followers and giveaway contestants fall victim to this type of mimicking credit card stealing scam you may want to pin a tweet that tell people how you accounce winners and that if they receive a dm from some one claiming to be you to watch - 2/3

1342709352516386817 2020-12-26 13:50:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> Thoughts on the 20-30 min warning from the rv telling people to evacuate. Was there goal property damage? Was it a suicide bombing due to human remains found? Or was it an execution? Was this practice? I wana here your thoughts! #PrayersForNashville  https://t.co/nCdSVyjbuA

1342707693727801344 2020-12-26 13:43:55 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @MaggGran @Cleavon_MD I'm sure we may never know the full extent but hopefully in the coming days those hard at work will be able to identify what happened
1342707047985369088 2020-12-26 13:41:21 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD . or i just had a thought was the warning ment to draw in as many police as possible was the target the police? So many possibilities. I'd love to be a fly on the wall of the police precinct and find right now. Side note terrorists risk level went up to yellow
1342706863377317888 2020-12-26 13:40:37 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD One would think it it was like international terrorism a group would have came forward shortly after and they wouldn't have given a warning...
1342706438230065152 2020-12-26 13:38:55 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD Yeah thats what makes it odd to me they clearly didn't want to harm people but was it practice was it politcally motivation was it to destroy the at&amp;t data collection? Was some one held captive and excused by bomb? Was its a suicide bombing with intent to cause property damage.
1342705125031170050 2020-12-26 13:33:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @MaggGran @Cleavon_MD Maybe suicide via bombing would explain why the warning and maybe there agiant something that something in that area stands for.
1342703459259191297 2020-12-26 13:27:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @MaggGran @Cleavon_MD Some are concerned it was just practice. How ever now they found human remains and my gut tells me some one was in that rv.

1342647419729637376 2020-12-26 09:44:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> But person said only option was to provide my bank online login so they could link accounts and tranfer funds and per my banks terms of service im not allowed to give out that info and with what happened this morning and last week I'm to afraid to so may have just turned down
1342647418651770880 2020-12-26 09:44:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> Today's been a messaged up day. I was almost scammed by some one who created a fake mimicking account and claimed I won a Xbox which the requires you to enter debit card info glad I realized the account user name was slightly different. Then I was offered some help
1342644971912892417 2020-12-26 09:34:41 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BeeUtifulSavage hi ty did this person help you with funds. Are the legit did you recieve funds.

1342638450005032963 2020-12-26 09:08:46 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Liberal_family @Cleavon_MD Thanksfull alot of people followed the warning and evacuated i can only imagine how bad it would have been if no warning was given apears the rv sounded the warning for almost 20 mins then began count down and even said there was a bomb in side it just seems very strange  https://t.co/0UrcxDalyu
1342637873493803008 2020-12-26 09:06:28 +0800 <Cehyienza> @delparkpatron @Section_131 @Cleavon_MD But what would the purpose of this be would that mean there going to do more?
1342597955727966208 2020-12-26 06:27:51 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Section_131 @Cleavon_MD 100% agree but my point is I wonder what the actual target was what was the point and has any one come forward to claim responsibility. Are there going to more attacks etc just glad no one was killed
1342597466319777793 2020-12-26 06:25:54 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MaggGran @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD I seen that as early as it was many people where asleep I can only assume that not all heard the warning but the fact remains if there intent was to hurt people they would play any kind of warning also said warning brought first responders etc to the area faster. Its bizarre
1342589300777500673 2020-12-26 05:53:28 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD If the at&amp;t data collection was the target
1342589217054998528 2020-12-26 05:53:08 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CosmollyH @Cleavon_MD Apears it gave people 20 mins or so and even switched to a count down something property wise in that area was the target. With 20 mins of warning it would have vorught in first responders etc to help any one hurt many people where able to get out prior to explosion some wonder  https://t.co/Pus9PVoFNC
1342586803287560194 2020-12-26 05:43:32 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Cleavon_MD Wait so the rv was playing that message to evacuate not the police!. This is definitely odd to would show indication that the target was not to harm people but rather the property its self why is the question 🤔  #prayersForNashville

1342556445326249984 2020-12-26 03:42:54 +0800 <Cehyienza> We do greatly miss these traditions and are stressed from the financial burden of 2020 and fearful of covid-19 exposer etc fearful of the unknown &amp; that my chronic respiratory failure has been progressing and the damage from inflammation is at its all time high etc etc but 8/?
1342556444185436160 2020-12-26 03:42:54 +0800 <Cehyienza> I miss singing carols together as a family after dinner and I miss pumpkin pie.

1340999647347675137 2020-12-21 20:36:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael Paid over $9 more per an hour so we jumped on it and relocated from helena mt to bozeman.  Our lower rent cost is Likely partly due to location we are literally right next to Yellowstone international airport and at first the noise was an issue but over time one grows accustomed
1340999170404962308 2020-12-21 20:34:51 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael But yeah the minimum wage shits crazy walmart paid my husband 11.40 cents and that was with 10 years of over all seniority. I hear now there paying more due to pandemic. We where blessed when my husband was offered a position that
1340998749636550658 2020-12-21 20:33:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael We where quick to resign our lease no way in hell where we going to attempt to relocate during the pandmic when rents going up. It sucks scince many folks are not paying rent during pandmic some due to rent strike its driving rent prices up as landlords try to compensate the loss
1340998406643146753 2020-12-21 20:31:49 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael We got a 3 bedroom fully remodeled brand new everything inside Manfacture home that is not by any means bueatifull on the out side but gives us a full yard and is secluded on the out skirts of town for less the 800 a month though is going up to 825 jan 1st but still in comparison
1340997801988132866 2020-12-21 20:29:25 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael how ever some get lucky like us find a good deal via rental on a Manfacture home at lower rent. In bozeman studio in 2019 pre covid was 1,100 a month expected to jump to 1,200+ in January
1340997382385725441 2020-12-21 20:27:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @wendyhaymichael There some areas like bozeman MT where average home costs over 500k the lowest paying jobs in town are around 13 an hour. Most people find a home with an 2 hour daily commute where the rent is cheaper.
1340898432395878400 2020-12-21 13:54:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> Excuse typos tired as hell
1340898354176258048 2020-12-21 13:54:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> Fact ao many essential workers make less then 2k per a month working full time.  Even before the pandmeic my husband worked for Walmart made a mear $1400 a month and was with the company 10 years combined (5 years each time)

1340397935607967745 2020-12-20 04:45:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Trump supports Would you be willing to sacrifice your own parents and grandparents to keep your bussiness open?   By saying let's just open up this is what you would be signing on to.   97% survival rate right? 331 million in usa. Over 2 million eldery high risk would die
1340397072734797824 2020-12-20 04:42:20 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump So you would rather over 2 million people die?

1340163301376884736 2020-12-19 13:13:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> Omg priceless as always
1340157086265577473 2020-12-19 12:48:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> Democrats and independents think Trumpublicans "Irredeemable, Deplorable Sadisitc privalged Ignorant Gullible Fuckers"   My OCD tendencies forced me to correct this
1340156079884312577 2020-12-19 12:44:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> I'm an independent and I think Trumplicans are even worse.
1340155833351430150 2020-12-19 12:43:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> Great now there should be zero excuses get them shipped to nursing and hospice centers now. As well as send more for Frontline workers and start vaccination of high risk
1340155203434078209 2020-12-19 12:41:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> @draop_ @armsbyw @DividendLookup @BuckSexton Actually they give out both false up to 20% according to the doctor who decided to follow up with a non rapid test to confirm the rapid one
1340094388995674113 2020-12-19 08:39:34 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD How ever I will be expecting your answer to if you would sacrifice your elderly family members to keep your business open and if your prolife when I return once those are answered we can carry on the discussion
1340094268166217728 2020-12-19 08:39:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD Also not assume I'm ignoring you as I'm not my husband is home so gonna take some time away from the phone to spend with him ill carry on this conversation when I'm back.
1340093762039472128 2020-12-19 08:37:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD Question are you prolife?
1340092689732182016 2020-12-19 08:32:49 +0800 <Cehyienza> Smfh clearly in speaking to a brick wall gonna go ahead and save my breath lord knows I dont have much left as it is. Any one who supports DeSantis is a lost cause. Mass deaths should never be an option.
1340091927119556608 2020-12-19 08:29:47 +0800 <Cehyienza> Are you saying your ok with 2 million grandparents and elderly people being dieing. If that's not profit over people idk wtf is. Would you sacrifice your own mother/father and grand mother /father to keep your business open?  Masks only work when all use them weve all known that.
1340088726744047616 2020-12-19 08:17:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD But shutting it down and not providing for the people during that time what the goverment has done and that leads to the issues we are seeing.   I'd suggest looking into how other country's have handled there shut downs and aid and how there virus is today many are back to normal
1340087759646543872 2020-12-19 08:13:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD Opinion every is not realistic as the mass death would be insane. Lock downs and masking and measures with out a doubt are needed but all those people need to be provided for during that time the same way almost all other civilized country's are doing. 1/2
1340087335803703296 2020-12-19 08:11:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD And that is exactly why our goverment needs to step the fuck up and help the people help the small bussiness etc. That is the issue exactly. The goverment must help the people not these big corporations.
1340084915128287232 2020-12-19 08:01:55 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged @Cleavon_MD Ment to say home work look it up its already happening.
1340084741274365953 2020-12-19 08:01:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> @HLeveraged Google home its already fucking happing look at Yuna Arizona for example yo @Cleavon_MD you wana set this person straight about the strain on hopsital and sacrifice of Frontline workers
1340083458190655488 2020-12-19 07:56:08 +0800 <Cehyienza> I do wish they would wait tell after nursing home patients get theres i just tore in to mile Pence for the same thing! Allow the Frontline and nursing homes to go first! Then elderly and high risk would be next which they fall under
1340083117038551040 2020-12-19 07:54:47 +0800 <Cehyienza> O look another narsccist trying to force use his manipulation and fake/forced empathy to screw people. The GOP is murders
1340081218679816192 2020-12-19 07:47:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> Solom was the wrong word. Sadistic would be more accurate
1340079895859249153 2020-12-19 07:41:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MikeTaylorFord1 @armsbyw @DividendLookup @BuckSexton I know I was being sarcastic lol 😆 but you are not wrong!
1340072157880045570 2020-12-19 07:11:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> @armsbyw @DividendLookup @BuckSexton And fact I currently have a cold and recently got my flu shot ..fact I just got my final results for covid-19 non rapid test which is negitive. Fact I was tested via rapid test 2 days prior to non rapid and it to was negitive.   You may want to learn to look up expert advice.
1340071319505838080 2020-12-19 07:07:54 +0800 <Cehyienza> @armsbyw @DividendLookup @BuckSexton Thats not true there distinctive viruses though the common cold and covid-19 are distant relatives they test will not confuse one for the other. Even experts have stated the same. Are you an expert whats your source?   Here's mine   https://t.co/uTFdcynbYa  https://t.co/jlUKMyK0qU

1340004442184196096 2020-12-19 02:42:09 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Stephen59781950 @Mike_Pence My days are already numbered due to chronic respiratory failure there for I have nothing to loose by taking the vaccine. I can only gain my life back my ability to leave my home my ability to see my family.
1340004037723267072 2020-12-19 02:40:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Stephen59781950 @Mike_Pence How ever I believe each person should decide them selfs if they want the vaccine each person's risks etc are different. My immediate factors from dieing from covid-19 are extremely high and my immediate risk factor from dieing from the vaccine is low.
1340003427976278017 2020-12-19 02:38:07 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Stephen59781950 @Mike_Pence Fuck trump that carrots micro penised Malignant Narcissist big baby will never be my comader in chief. Clearly you didn't not read or comprehend my tweets. Its appalling that they received the vaccine before people in nursing homes did. trump didn't make the vaccine science did.
1339951455441076230 2020-12-18 23:11:36 +0800 <Cehyienza> @RexChapman The audio doesn't match i suspect its added but still cool
1339951118218977280 2020-12-18 23:10:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence I believe if your wanting the peoples trust you and the rest of the administration shouldn't have lied so fucking much over the last 4 years. Zero transparency as usual. What next signed affidavits from the nurses stating it was legit? Lmfao
1339950711157624835 2020-12-18 23:08:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence Now don't get me wrong im all for getting the vaccine as soon as its available for high risk out patient individuals you bet your ass me and my husband will be one of the first people in line.
1339950043286044674 2020-12-18 23:06:00 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence What next the fly will be offered the vaccine before phase 1a designated people?
1339949592385708033 2020-12-18 23:04:12 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence Especially while the trump administration is asking nursing home staff not to vaccinate tell a later date then all sudden thos shipments are delayed for unknown reasons while millions of vaccines sit in pfizer storage with no info on where to ship them.
1339949081309810688 2020-12-18 23:02:10 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence Even if this was all legit I still find it completely appalling that any member of the Trump Administration would take the vaccine before all our Frontline medical workers &amp; all nursing home staff and patients have been inoculated.
1339948100392128513 2020-12-18 22:58:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence Is it actually the vaccine or saline? Why not allow people to see the filling of syringe and actual injection into skin? Why block that view? Did the nurse even injected them? Something here seems off 🤔  he said he didn't feel anything #SUS
1339947333639815168 2020-12-18 22:55:14 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Mike_Pence Why is my gut screaming at me that this is not legit!? Why put the bandaid on first to have an excuse to have there other hand block the view? It is injected super fast even the flu vaccine is injected slower.

1339791804929957889 2020-12-18 12:37:13 +0800 <Cehyienza> I would have been accused as a witch and burned at the stake, sadly the accusations would have probably been right
1339791356445618177 2020-12-18 12:35:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> @ChadLindberg Stuck laying back elevating my foot and thats swollen to ez 5% its normal size. Accidently fell asleep early for a few hours and food slid off the bed and leg hung down gravity + lymph edema = swollen and pain full. Sucks but at least I'm still alive!
1339720762119221248 2020-12-18 07:54:55 +0800 <Cehyienza> My most recent tweet can address this so many people can not see past there own expriances they do not care or even think of those who are going threw worse things then them. Its a combination of selfishness and lack of empathy
1339720315903995904 2020-12-18 07:53:08 +0800 <Cehyienza> I wish more people realized this but its absoutly appalling how many people in America can't seem to see past there own expriances. The world lacks empathy.
1339719962424832000 2020-12-18 07:51:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> Even in your own personal darkest times you must remain humble and thankful as I garrentee there are people going threw and surviving even worse situations i learned this at a very young age.
1339719029351538689 2020-12-18 07:48:02 +0800 <Cehyienza> Don't get me wrong by any means I love bozeman very much but to many it comes across as a privalged city. The housing costs are insane compared to other locations in montana a studio runs 1100+
1339718481747402753 2020-12-18 07:45:51 +0800 <Cehyienza> Food bank in helena MT allows folks to pick up a box weekly 100miles away in bozeman where the cost of living is extremely higher food bank gives a box 1 time a month....wtf is the logic in that.... people are starving. Granted this is the same city who closed there shelter

1339089103627845633 2020-12-16 14:04:56 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump @MailOnline Math jackass! 81,283,485 is larger then 74,223,755. Biden received 7,059,730 more  legal votes then you.   Also its not proper to round up from 74,223,755  to 75 million as with 223,755 you must round down to 74 million as its not over 500,000 threshold  Here ill even do a visual  https://t.co/JO2BvV4D72
1339076468865781760 2020-12-16 13:14:43 +0800 <Cehyienza> The fact that I'm beginning to actually think @realDonaldTrump is delusional. I thought it was just his con to rip off his supporters but even after the electoral college voted (biden won) Trumps lies continue does he actually believe his own lies? #25amendmentnow
1339075368066506752 2020-12-16 13:10:21 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump How many out of what total replicans where polled? What source was the poll from? With out verifying all this info these are just empty words look i can do the same  Poll 100% of democrats believe Donald trumps a narsccist  there's likly far more factual truth in my made up poll
1339073566294196224 2020-12-16 13:03:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> The issue is every one needs to follow the rules. He may have wore his mask but how many around him didn't? That is the issue all people need to do so to save lifes like his and so so many others prayers of healing to his family
1339072284774912001 2020-12-16 12:58:06 +0800 <Cehyienza> To be honest least some ones taking it serious am I shocked that its actually @TomCruise yes I am I honestly would have thought he would assume he's immune this actually made me respect Tom Cruise which is something I have not done in a long time

1338374598610407425 2020-12-14 14:45:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats Montana has a large population of anti mask and anti vaccine individuals even if the other 45% of us in montana are vaccinated the virus will still be running amok and messing with bussiness and killing citizens who decline vaccination.
1338374172704079873 2020-12-14 14:44:03 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats Who are Frontline and vaccinated this week will vaccinate again in 21 days then 10 days after that they will reach peak effectiveness. Then there's the issue id estimat only half of America will opt to have the vaccine
1338373781392248832 2020-12-14 14:42:29 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats I would assume public access would beign but its gonna take alot of vaccine and time even then the vaccine to become fully effective takes a total of 31 days and 2 shots so folks
1338373491163160576 2020-12-14 14:41:20 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats The elderly and high risk will be next to receive vaccination followed by essential infrastructure workers who where made to work during the stay at home. (Which id guess this part will be with in 30-60 days from now) then
1338373121217183744 2020-12-14 14:39:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats Gonna be awhile first 8000 doses of vaccine will arrive in montana tomorrow and will be going to a small part of Frontline health care workers and long term care facilities. Its gonna take multiple shipments to complete get both cover 100% then
1338372499701026816 2020-12-14 14:37:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats O no lol just so many drivers not enough rides. Best he ever did was a ride from helena to great falls and then back to helena which was $300  round trip (with a wait time pay of about 30 mins) plus $100 cash tip. Then another $260 threw out the week. What area are u in?
1338369615773102081 2020-12-14 14:25:56 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats Seems there been alot of changes so the app goes off line at 10pm? No rides there after even if a driver is available to do so? Thats crazy
1338369428476600321 2020-12-14 14:25:12 +0800 <Cehyienza> @BrewcrewBarnes @UberEats When did they start capping he was never capped but just on average its all that was available and that was even doing the bar rides. We moved to bozeman in dec last year so not sure about uber eats in helena.

1338365131164704768 2020-12-14 14:08:07 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Define later?   Will all Frontline health workers, long term living facility &amp; at home health workers &amp; patients, high risk &amp; elderly recieve it before the trump administration?

1338313580169478145 2020-12-14 10:43:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump What about states that sent mail in ballots to all registered voters? Like montana? Where u won?   Why are you only making these fake claims in swing states where your ass lost?   Your a disgrace   #TrumpConjob
1338313135640387584 2020-12-14 10:41:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Vaccines should first go to all Frontline workers not your administration!!!
1338312909114359809 2020-12-14 10:40:36 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Propaganda alert.   "Rushed Mail in ballots"   Well Montana sent mail in ballot to every registered voter.

1338304114275446784 2020-12-14 10:05:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> My last 2 tweets where in response to this
1338303994553196544 2020-12-14 10:05:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> Will this deter me from having the covid-19 vaccine? no way the benifits still out way the risks. However it means I will have the vaccine in my providers office where ill remain for some time to watch for reaction just like any new medicine or any vaccine I take.
1338303993622097921 2020-12-14 10:05:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> All vaccines have the risk of allergic reactions everything in the world has the capability of triggering an anaphylaxis. Also some individuals body is more sustainable to allgery. I my self am actually allergic to heat &amp; to uv sun rays (cholinergic urticaria &amp; solar urticaria)

1338300107943383040 2020-12-14 09:49:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> When you use mildly complex terms and some one you thought of as a friend miss understands you and assumes your saying the complete opposite then what your actually saying then blocks you before you even get the chance to simplify and explain thats there is a misunderstanding.
1338298682593009667 2020-12-14 09:44:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 Thats not what I was saying hun if you have me a moment to finish lol check last tweet. Lol I was getting there twitter 140 limits a pain lol
1338298284188651520 2020-12-14 09:42:29 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 But moral of the story is you know your body best, most folks who have symptoms are able to tell of its something they have already have exprianced in past or something new trust your body, but also don't just assume its not possible when in doubt get checked out :)
1338297675700027392 2020-12-14 09:40:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 I refused to go to the er when the abcess got bad because I had the temp the er said any one with a fever get placed in the viral waiting room (with other covid-19) when I asked what if there high risk and there fever has already been found to be bacterial?
1338297217384292352 2020-12-14 09:38:15 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 We check our Temps 2 times a day. Had a scare on Thanksgiving when my temp jumped up high but even though I had a skin abcess they still checked for covid (again negitive) just the abcess bacteria was causing a temp.
1338296718295662599 2020-12-14 09:36:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 For him to bring it home unknowingly which we fear ive only been in public 4, times for doctors visits scince late February and still they test me to be safe
1338296362568306688 2020-12-14 09:34:51 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 I only have one point of contact daily and thats my husband unfortunately he is an essential employee and my care taker, they test me any time I get sick (even if its just a normal cold) each time I've been negative thankfully but it would be very ez
1338295938230624263 2020-12-14 09:33:10 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 This happened to my mom her close friend was positive and had absoutly no symptoms but mom got real sick.
1338295913752584192 2020-12-14 09:33:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> @zaksgirl2020 Unfortunately many people can have covid with 0 symptoms. If you develop dry cough fever nausea etc I would definitely drop by local urgent care just to be safe. Its very much possible some one u have been in contact has it but no symptoms.

1338066510959452161 2020-12-13 18:21:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @donwinslow Bernard should not have been excuted even members of his jury that orginally found him guilty where fighting to stop his execution look it up absoutly appalling. I believe trump administration executing so many as they know biden has vowed to end the federal death sentace.

But no matter what we always looked forward to was walking around the neighborhood as a family enjoying others light displays
1336875661026201601 2020-12-10 11:29:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DeevonRahming @kare11 @StAnthonyPolice We can not afford lights let alone gifts this year.  But we do enjoy others peoples light displays do I wish we could have a better Christmas? Ofcouse! but we are alive and thankful to have a roof over our heads, and I'd never bash some one else for being better off financially.

1333828645731790849 2020-12-02 01:41:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Zak_Bagans heres a still shot from the video of the alleged creature, it should be noted the person who posted it has not commented or post anything since. My gut says its a prank but some one pointed this out as well see second pic resemblance from same video. Matrixing?  https://t.co/SnAFzywqB0
1333824623662620672 2020-12-02 01:25:46 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Zak_Bagans Check this out left of the women blue hat thoughts? Alien? Costume? Cryptic? Prank? This is at the sight of the monolith after it was removed but top was left behind. I can't help but notice how much it looks like the pictures people have been posting of a flying humanoid bat  https://t.co/ESaT1f07UL
1333804664341417985 2020-12-02 00:06:27 +0800 <Cehyienza> Let's not forget as well that the landlords are also hurting and there for are raising rent where its allowed starting January, we got a 25% increase but our income has no increase we are just gonna have to make due with a decorative Christmas

1333802055115313157 2020-12-01 23:56:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @ChadLindberg Morning anything fun planned for today?
1333516261687390208 2020-12-01 05:00:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> @lenora_philson @ANACnurses Not to mention bacterial infection fever patients being forced to sit with viral patients i just recently ran into this issue and have put off going to ther er for that fact hopping to get in direct with my dermatologist for skin infection
1333514901793357825 2020-12-01 04:55:02 +0800 <Cehyienza> @NickGroff_ On my way there now ty! Hope u have been well hun! - Rachel former right left turn radio
1333514728589561856 2020-12-01 04:54:21 +0800 <Cehyienza> @davenewworld_2 Some one link me to her I have a few choice words to comment
1333513545313513472 2020-12-01 04:49:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> Antibiotics have done little to help the pain is insane ive had enough 😫 😪 😩
1333513544302694401 2020-12-01 04:49:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> I will fight this and even have the urgent care doctors call them and tell them im not a viral patient. Im awaiting dermatologist to return my call for further directions. Meanwhile I'm in severe pain with a very large abcess over my femerol artery that oral and shot
1333513543342116864 2020-12-01 04:49:38 +0800 <Cehyienza> That if I have a fever the office won't let me see her even though she's the one who would treat the skin infection best.   What kind of backwards bull shit is this. Sapose I have to up my anti fever meds. Er said if a fever is present id be placed with viral patients
1333513542385876993 2020-12-01 04:49:38 +0800 <Cehyienza> I have diabetes and chronic lung failure plus obesity and immune issues its well documented scince Thursday that my fever is from bacterial skin infection why put me at risk when its clear my fever is not from viral!! I won't stand for it! Yet I was just told my my dermatologist
1333513541450514432 2020-12-01 04:49:38 +0800 <Cehyienza> This could be an issue, bacterial infection causes fever, if some one goes to the er or doc and have a fever there placed with viral patients but what about those with documented bacterial infection as the cause! I refuse to placed with viral patients 😒

1331312344580857856 2020-11-25 03:02:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Cleavon_MD @GovernorBullock Even worse I've been told countless times by Anti-Maskers they don't give a shit if the high risk and elderly die cuz "we all die some time" "survival of the fittest These type of people's current mindset is more scary then the virus its self. Insanity is what it is.
1331311813502193670 2020-11-25 03:00:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Cleavon_MD @GovernorBullock Does Arizona have a mask mandate state wide thats being inforced? The issue is here over half the people still believe covid-19 is still hoax and the mandates are not inforced here and when they are its by the business refusing services that's it.
1331310729178144768 2020-11-25 02:56:27 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Cleavon_MD @GovernorBullock Here's the local news coverage, from my understanding they have been a god send but the stress on the Healthcare systems is only getting worse ive tweeted and worried to our state officials as a stay at home order is needed now! Its only going to get drastically worse
1331309885707808768 2020-11-25 02:53:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Cleavon_MD Has your administration sought to higher temporary nurses to cover for covid like montana has? It has costed montana alot of money but most allegedly will be reimbursed by fema and what's left over from cares act. Take a look @GovernorBullock tweets theres an article covering it
1331308540166737921 2020-11-25 02:47:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @LawnaGreen @DPWIMM @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Its been reprinted by mutiple different outlets even this one which is on there UK site.  https://t.co/TwBFcOGcut  https://t.co/XyHU4BH7C3

The statement has a domestic /mental abuse vibe to it
1331306632110772224 2020-11-25 02:40:10 +0800 <Cehyienza> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump She was sapose to meet with them yesterday but failed to and sent letter stating some one else would in a week they responded by demanding she due so her self even by phone if video was not capable tomorrow which is Tuesday, today I've not seen any further word yet
1331306226777350144 2020-11-25 02:38:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Actually she only caved after Donald directed her to do so and then he tweeted about it and he only did that to throw her over the sinking ship as the oversight committee has called for her to answer for her failure and now likly her corruption and lies. Granted my paraphrasing.  https://t.co/jYviP8q4x4

1331050987235147776 2020-11-24 09:44:19 +0800 <Cehyienza> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump He essentially just threw her over board by confirming in his tweet that she lied and was politically swayed she need to prosecuted for placing American and national security at risk. Her puppet cut his strings left her to fall flat on her face.  https://t.co/baNUMp8VNP

1331044005145047042 2020-11-24 09:16:35 +0800 <Cehyienza> @pogothecat44 @GovernorBullock People like this are the problem @GovernorBullock why not charge these people with criminal or reckless endangerment? A mask during a pandemic is not political the life of another is worth the moment of temporary discomfort! Are people truly that selfish?
1331029948073529344 2020-11-24 08:20:43 +0800 <Cehyienza> When I say this lady i mean @GSAEmily
1331029869912682496 2020-11-24 08:20:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> They have demanded she meet with them via video or phone conference tomorrow. Its likly the only reason trump has allowed her to begin the process this women failed to due her job placing America national security and lives at risk she must be allowed to walk away from this.
1331027027281940480 2020-11-24 08:09:07 +0800 <Cehyienza> Shes also a blatant lier, she should be fired and procecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  https://t.co/3ZXtRkrHef

1331022075918647296 2020-11-24 07:49:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Gantenbergh @GovernorBullock Also I apologize your tweet did trigger me i don't mean to come across as rude though I've been told at times I do. So sorry if that was the case we all love montana &amp; people here but the lack of respect for one another's life gets frustrating and exhausting. Blessed be
1331020578082283522 2020-11-24 07:43:29 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Gantenbergh @GovernorBullock So I pose the question why is my life not equally as important as yours? I didn't choose to be chronicly ill or high risk, but yet your willing to sacrifice people like me or worse your own grandparents 🤔
1331020226557734914 2020-11-24 07:42:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Gantenbergh @GovernorBullock So your saying the vulnerable and elderly are expendable? As not only would we become even more at risk of contraction and serious illness with high chance of death but the hospitals would be over stressed and our everyday Healthcare we rely on wouldn't be possible?
1331019511630163971 2020-11-24 07:39:15 +0800 <Cehyienza> @SteveRobertsMT @GovernorBullock They really need to make it possible to charge these people with something like criminal or reckless endangerment as bluntly thats exact what it is.
1331019181374857216 2020-11-24 07:37:56 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Rboycarman @GovernorBullock I 100% agree if he fails to act we won't have the chance to get this under control nows the time before the holidays hit and number explode even more
1331018955993931777 2020-11-24 07:37:02 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MTRegularGuy @GovernorBullock This is precisely what I told him just a moment ago on another post sadly its very true he needs to step up shut it down enforce stay at home other wise its gonna be a very deadly winter.
1331018441197686784 2020-11-24 07:35:00 +0800 <Cehyienza> And order and enforce the stay at home to get this spike under control come time when you leave office the chance to due so will be To late will your replacement actually take the pandemic serious or will we become like some other rual states whos govners believe its a hoax?
1331018440308494337 2020-11-24 07:34:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GovernorBullock sorry my frustration is obvious, I understand your doing what you feel is best but you know we need to shut it down. Thanks for sticking by us, I may not be a democrat but I voted for you for senate, cause honestly Dainese is a dick. But I fear of you don't act
1331017039821959169 2020-11-24 07:29:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> And before any one jumps on the well the "vunarable need to stay at home" I have since it started except for a few car rides like a fucking dog, and few urgent doctors visits and I worse a mask dispite having severe breathing problems. #StepUpMontana
1331015916071522311 2020-11-24 07:24:58 +0800 <Cehyienza> Call it like it is the reason is the people who think its fake or refuse to wear a mask and then brag because they refuse. Why are people like me "the vulnerable" expendable? Why not shut it down now its only gonna get worse! But bless those nurses for stepping up!
1331015368165343232 2020-11-24 07:22:47 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GovernorBullock I apologize for the bluntness but this "covid is a hoax shit" is completely out of control with holidays coming if a stay at home is not ordered and inforced for non essential employees then this next 3 weeks or so is gonna be deadly remember that!
1331014855936126978 2020-11-24 07:20:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @mtblackdog @GovernorBullock Where you in the icu did you count how many beds there where and how many patients?
1331014588788215808 2020-11-24 07:19:41 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GovernorBullock Have you seen over half the people who live in montana? They don't even where a fucking mask and there proud of that fact. Only way where gonna get this virus curve to flatten and avoid even more death is for you to use that pair of balls you process hun and shut it down! Now!!!
1330926072133607425 2020-11-24 01:27:57 +0800 <Cehyienza> stay home w/ your own household! Why put your own family &amp; friends, (many of which are grandparents) Strangers along the way, &amp; your household &amp; self at risk? If leads to a death, How would you feel knowing you ould have prevented it by just staying home?
1330883966535049216 2020-11-23 22:40:38 +0800 <Cehyienza> @jo20655160 @CA_Husker_Amy Troll can't even put your pic up lmfao ✌
1330879524309929984 2020-11-23 22:22:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Try looking at the 2020 population, you'll find your statement is false stop using old population data , I find it sad that you can't even do that. Are you illiterate? Is some one typing these tweets for you?

1330566308551819266 2020-11-23 01:38:23 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Simple answer: your lack of legitimate evidence! Just because you say something happened does not make it so. One should not need weeks to locate evidence that means there's non to be found. One should not pay people for false testimony thats not legitimate evidence. #YOUALOSER
1330562572194496512 2020-11-23 01:23:32 +0800 <Cehyienza> States need to act now as we all know not ever one will do there part due to Selfishness &amp; that will then lead to needing a 4-6 week shut down which then all suffer! #ArrestAntiMaskers  #PutYourMaskon #MaskUp #MaskOn #doyourpart #AntiMaskersAreSelfish #JailForAntiMaskers

1328955476118298628 2020-11-18 14:57:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Vidallena_ just seen your reply your response are being hidden on Twitter directly had to use tweetcaster to view. She devolved symptoms the next day and got her positive test results 3 days latter. My immunologist stated she would have been contagious during the contact.

1328950439384068099 2020-11-18 14:37:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @LeeWill85840953 @KristenMeghan Did they have windows open etc caravans now days can mean anything from a jeep to a full rv. Was there superstore rooms?
1328950239294795776 2020-11-18 14:36:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> @LeeWill85840953 @KristenMeghan Where the other family members tested when viral load was highest? Using a non rapid test? If not its quite possible they could have been infected but not symptomatic. Had they had any sign if illness the 2 weeks prior? Did they stay all day in the caravan with him or
1328949033692487680 2020-11-18 14:31:54 +0800 <Cehyienza> @alan_hall @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan Thanks for asking though but assuming some one is assuming is still and assumptions despite it being posed as a question take care Alan be safe.
1328948818268856320 2020-11-18 14:31:03 +0800 <Cehyienza> @alan_hall @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan My immunologist  works directly with mayo clinic and has worked to gain my trust for years. Straight shooter no surgery coating I dodged a bullet considering the common cold lands me in the hopsital. Needless to say lesson learned no one enters my home not even family.
1328947715078807554 2020-11-18 14:26:40 +0800 <Cehyienza> @alan_hall @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan I did not assume I contacted my immunologist and followed her recommendation. She was truly shocked that my non rapid test was negitive. based on what's known of the virus and my level of immosupression and risk factors she fully expected the result to be positive. 1/2
1328945723518439426 2020-11-18 14:18:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CaptnObvious77 @KristenMeghan Are you not aware prior to covid-19 n95 where early purchased by General public. Many severely immosupressed individuals like my self had them stock piled as we use them during cold and flu season to help prevent hospitalization. I never said I used a loose cloth mask.
1328942284654718980 2020-11-18 14:05:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CaptnObvious77 @KristenMeghan Do you know what the long-term effects of having a thymectomy during adolescent ( very rare at the age I had it removed, 1% rare) not only does it result is immocompression but also long term autoimmunies that require strong immosupression therapy. Why not ask vs assume?
1328934398025232386 2020-11-18 13:33:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @samanthajferris @ChadLindberg Haha amazing 👏
1328902396890603522 2020-11-18 11:26:35 +0800 <Cehyienza> @_Mercian @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan Not necessarily considering how common many autoimmune dieses are across the world, not to mention all the other common medical conditions that either comprise the immune system or require suppression. Then factor in age related decline. Not logical by any means buy carry on

1328890328074444800 2020-11-18 10:38:38 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Dr_RohenKapur @KristenMeghan Are you aware of the long term effects on the immune system due to thymectomy in adolescent? Ome would also know the immune system is not only compermised it tends to result in co-autoimmune disorders which unfortunately result in use of strong immosupression. #bubblegirl
1328887936662716416 2020-11-18 10:29:08 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Zednik11 @KristenMeghan Why do you assume my immune system or my family's immune system works adequately? Between my thymectomy as a child (yes one of the 1%) and strong immosupression therapy now,  its why I had surgical masks stocked up pre-covid19 as I use them during flu and cold season.
1328886640685711362 2020-11-18 10:23:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MB9v10proverbs @KristenMeghan  https://t.co/9RPqtm7dCs  Do you live under a rock I know many immocompermised individuals who like my self use masks during flu season as we as very susceptible to severe illness its the reason I had stock pile of surgical masks pre covid19. Why do you assume no one uses them?
1328883371892645889 2020-11-18 10:10:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Su15100307 @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan Why do you assume it was a cloth mask I never said cloth mask did I? 🤔
1328807125326327808 2020-11-18 05:08:01 +0800 <Cehyienza> @jaredspinkhair @KristenMeghan Was yours and there test rapid or non rapid how long after contact where you tested.
1328789706402721792 2020-11-18 03:58:48 +0800 <Cehyienza> @hawkeyejulie @KristenMeghan I ask as I refuse to assume thanks for attempting to do the same
1328789594389659648 2020-11-18 03:58:21 +0800 <Cehyienza> @hawkeyejulie @KristenMeghan How long after your meeting with them where they symptomactic and then positive result? Due you use corticosteroids for asthma? Also what's your blood type is it 0 by chance, I to am from a medical family. Did you touch them at all? Did you wash and or sanitize?
1328788602063523840 2020-11-18 03:54:25 +0800 <Cehyienza> @KekAlmighty Yeah thats dumb as unless your a taxi or uber driver or carpool etc

1328785840072314880 2020-11-18 03:43:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> @hawkeyejulie @KristenMeghan Have you had antibodies test done to see if maybe you already had it non symptomactic, did you have direct face to face contact or touching, how far away exactly where you? Where you with in 1 foot? Was the person symptomactic coughing etc? Are you immosupressed or high risk?
1328785370444562433 2020-11-18 03:41:34 +0800 <Cehyienza> @yarop @KristenMeghan Did she test for antibodies? Is it possible she may have had it non symptomactic way before and there for had some forms of built up immunity? How do u know what precautions she did or didn't use? Was she highly susceptible with composing high risk factors or immosupression?
1328784520401747968 2020-11-18 03:38:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> @KekAlmighty Since you asked a question mine is very strongly suppressed, and I had the closest most direct contact with most susceptibility.  I trust I'm my medical team and there conclusions. Will continue our virus defenses as thus far they are working!
1328783253579259904 2020-11-18 03:33:09 +0800 <Cehyienza> Going further if a person responds with an assumption, I will not reply. People need to learn to use there brains and rather then jump to conclusions based on assumptions why not ask questions, do me a favor practice your critical thinking skills!! #ThinkBeforeYouSpeak
1328780882316935168 2020-11-18 03:23:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan You don't know my medical history or immosupression, nore did I ever say cloth or fabric mask your assuming 🤔 why not ask questions instead
1328773363947376641 2020-11-18 02:53:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @XanderCrews34 @KristenMeghan That's a assumption, you do not know my medical history,  why does one assume that a person has a perfectly normal immune system smh
1328718964034129925 2020-11-17 23:17:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> @KristenMeghan If masks didn't work my family and I would have been infected when we met with my mom who unknown at the time was infected and contagious. We, including docs, thought for sure we would be positive since contact happened for over an hour in very close space with poor ventilation.

But who are you to judge your neighbor?"   "For the Lord is our judge; the Lord is our lawgiver; the Lord is our king; he will save us"  You are not the lord ma'am!
1325494080281829377 2020-11-09 01:43:09 +0800 <Cehyienza> @ConservaMomUSA @JoeBiden And I can not even for a moment believe that there own personal beliefs have actually changed deep down Biden is still Pro-life and Trump is still pro-choice. But for me as long as bidens willing to respect women's rights alls good in my book
1325493578676596736 2020-11-09 01:41:10 +0800 <Cehyienza> @ConservaMomUSA @JoeBiden Are you aware trump switched from pro choice to pro life ONLY as he was preparing his presidential run, Trump was also a democrat. And Biden is a catholic who in past has been very outpsoken for pro-life though he has scince stated he will uphold roe vs wade on his platform

1325283973841317888 2020-11-08 11:48:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> Though startling I didn't find the voice scary it sounded rather motherly #DestinationFear great evidence non the less

1323753080224014336 2020-11-04 06:25:03 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GhostAdventures @Zak_Bagans One attempt to kill resulted in grandpa in a life flight trip to university of Utah and a rather long hopsital and recovery grandpa wouldn't return back after he refused thank God he did or I wouldn't have moved into his room and seen first hand how bad it was
1323752078842368000 2020-11-04 06:21:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GhostAdventures @Zak_Bagans We never returned so I have no clue if the house is still there over 2/3rd of McGill is abandoned the whole town is a hot spot but that damn house traumatized my self my 2 brothers grandpa and mom and dad and...

This is one of the few times I've even spoke of it as just thinking about it triggers the ptsd it caused. We told the landlord keep his deposit and tear the place down.
1323749938577072129 2020-11-04 06:12:34 +0800 <Cehyienza> @GhostAdventures @Zak_Bagans After the 4th blessing the activity became so violent that my brother was slammed across the room by an unseen force he was just a small babe at the time we grabbed the essential and fled we never returned

Biden is a Christian ✝️  and do they not know trump was a democrat and pro-choice? Are they not aware even trumps own party dont want him a vote for trump is a vote for a racist narsccist wannabe dictator. Its a TrumoTrap
1323657682843172864 2020-11-04 00:05:58 +0800 <Cehyienza> Nope not at all

1323626409663721473 2020-11-03 22:01:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CC_Lib01 But I can't buy that there only there for the existing unrest they would have been there days ago. My presumption is they are there to keep the 2 sides from murdering each other before the results and control what ever backlash comes from the looses side
1323626076879249408 2020-11-03 22:00:23 +0800 <Cehyienza> @CC_Lib01 Thats why the people need to ask who deployed them if its the govners id assume its prep for the election looses supporters back lash or there to keep the 2 sides from killing each other, but if trump deployed them the people should be concerned the man is unhinged.
1323625389852303365 2020-11-03 21:57:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> Yep people seem to forget this is and has been trumps America for the last 4 years! How is he gonna make it great agian when he just had 4 years and failed horribly
1323624319549755393 2020-11-03 21:53:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> So we the people need to ask who activated them? If its the govners im sure it to prep for the outlast from loosing side.   If it the president then wtf is doing now?   Have to ask the right questions
1323623986337472512 2020-11-03 21:52:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> Don't believe that for a moment why now why today there's only 1 thing that makes today different? Though I'm not surprised considering the active president has already threatened Violence in the streets should be not win and I really don't think he will.
1323622838545260546 2020-11-03 21:47:31 +0800 <Cehyienza> Fucking aye voter intimidation or prep for far right out lash?

1319670790351065094 2020-10-24 00:03:29 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Bubbitybubbub @TraptTheBand The direct respect for the music and what its gotten me threw prior to Chris Twitter rampage remains and that won't change im sorry if you don't approve who are you to cast judgement when you dont know me at all?
1319669589526024192 2020-10-23 23:58:43 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Bubbitybubbub @TraptTheBand But non of that changes the fact of what the bands music (not Chris him self) has helped me get threw in my life well before he came out as conservative or proud boy etc. In doing so my direct respect of the man him self is gone 💯  and he knows this but

1319464498151878656 2020-10-23 10:23:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> These delusions @realDonaldTrump holds are very disturbing he's either repeated his lies so many times he now believes them or he has serious mental health issues the paranoia delusions etc are concerning and can be inductors of schizophrenia. Honestly #Debates2020
1319459944886726656 2020-10-23 10:05:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> Exactly its criminal! You just hit the nail on the head or should I say fly on the head? Trump is nothing more then a career criminal with a cult following. Sad but true. #Debates2020

I'm open to allow you to make that right by mailing me an autograph from the entire band if your down message me for address ill pay postage.
1319344116690345984 2020-10-23 02:25:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> @TRAPTOFFICIAL Chris I hope you realize, I continue to defend &amp; support Trapts music despite our opposing views &amp; damn it its gotten me into many arguments but I'm not gonna let go of trapts music! I've sacrificed enough in my life and already lost so much to politics.
1319342503019991041 2020-10-23 02:18:59 +0800 <Cehyienza> @TraptTheBand @JoshCal11204029 @TRAPTOFFICIAL Can't you see thats the difference Chris taylor brown maybe a fasict but im a Hispanic disabled women who came fro. Poverty and though I hate his point of views theres enough room in my heart for the love of his and the bands music. Sad he has more restraint then you.
1319341852558938112 2020-10-23 02:16:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> @TraptTheBand @JoshCal11204029 @TRAPTOFFICIAL You sure your not a trump supporter do you not see what your doing is no better then then them hate from either side is still hate, your a sad sad pitiful person. Worse you attempt to judge people who actually agree with your point of views.
1319306089985306625 2020-10-22 23:54:18 +0800 <Cehyienza> In a dream I had yesterday I said   "It takes great measures to move mountains but we much all still retain our freedom to choose"   Its stuck with me and I continue to ponder this statement.
1319169440534069249 2020-10-22 14:51:18 +0800 <Cehyienza> Music help can bridge the politcal division. Example: dispite Chris @TRAPTOFFICIAL support of Trump, he's still very talented &amp; the Trapt as a whole bands music does hold my support has since the very beginning of the thier careers  Music its self not political people are!
1319166760654757888 2020-10-22 14:40:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> @TraptTheBand @JoshCal11204029 @TRAPTOFFICIAL CTB views are his own don't hate the bands music due to an individuals freedom of speech. His views dont change the fact hes massively talented and thier music is not political if they where i wouldn't have listened to every song Attended so many concerts and payed up for VIP  https://t.co/ScH0AWq3TY
1318992905403387904 2020-10-22 03:09:49 +0800 <Cehyienza> @JoshCal11204029 @TRAPTOFFICIAL Flase I've attended many Trapt concerts in larger venues then that. do u realize there's mutiple band members? the political oppions here are chris's himself. lets not blame the whole band or there music for his own oppion. I may not agree w/ chris but the music is still amazing

Did you catch the interview where he stated if he looses he may leave the country, further evidence he only wants elected to dodge those growing about of legal issues

Meanwhile people are being forced to die alone with no one allowed in the room with them other then the medical team. This man is unbelievable. #ConManTrump

1312539604415901699 2020-10-04 07:46:42 +0800 <Cehyienza> In addition what do we expect this is the same man who knew and did nothing, think back to January etc if we would have gone full force like we did in March how many of the deaths would have been saved that same amount is equal to the blood on his hands
1312538463137193984 2020-10-04 07:42:10 +0800 <Cehyienza> Unfortunately he's already shown America he don't care, I think he's literally unable to narcissistics like trump are unable to care and any sign that might be seen as caring is not real its used as a manipulative tactic.

1312511250136354816 2020-10-04 05:54:01 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Brunahild @ceoterrio @HuffPost I wish this life on no one but I agree the 25th amendment needs invoked now trumps on the edge of a cliff sadly I don't think he will make just a nasty gut feeling there down playing his symptoms to much to remain in control time for pence to step up. #25thAmendmentNow
1312511058838388737 2020-10-04 05:53:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Brunahild @ceoterrio @HuffPost And honestly it sounds like this could have lead her into chronic lung failure which can take a awhile to show up on imaging mine presenter with scaring and nodules mine how ever is from auto inflammatory which is kinda why covid is so bad it triggers a lung inflammatory attack
1312509579436068864 2020-10-04 05:47:23 +0800 <Cehyienza> @Brunahild These are the side effects from the low oxygen levels and lung damage i have every one of these symptoms and its due to my chronic lung failure its literally ur body changed well was damaged due to lack of oxygen its horrible and debilitating

1312379701650841605 2020-10-03 21:11:18 +0800 <Cehyienza> @marlibaby @KyleSau62408137 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse The same can be seen when they just assume things are fake news etc these people are also easily misplaced by individuals like trump and they don't realize it as they lack those critical thinking skills seen in individuals with higher intelligence, take solace in knowing this :)
1312379042226556929 2020-10-03 21:08:41 +0800 <Cehyienza> @marlibaby @KyleSau62408137 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse Marlibaby, there's actually studies that show his cult like followers are in fact less intelligent when compared to non trump supports this is seen a lot in the fact they make assumptions with out any factual basic, prime example is how Kylesau assumed you are not intelligent...
1312267300641206272 2020-10-03 13:44:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> Right proper response... unfortunately expires of willful neglect for health and human safety continue
1312265271608971264 2020-10-03 13:36:36 +0800 <Cehyienza> @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump Your satire amuses me. As do the replies u always get

1311989126204252161 2020-10-02 19:19:17 +0800 <Cehyienza> @deblync76 @Sheeple101 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse And due to how many times he's lied about so many other things there has been many asking for a 3party non biased test to just confirm.
1311988589559906306 2020-10-02 19:17:09 +0800 <Cehyienza> @deblync76 @Sheeple101 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse That my point exact &amp; why I believe they have tested positive other wise he must know this will hurt his campaign yes some will sympathize bt many already have shown thats not the case. But considering how many people seem to wonder if maybe he's crying wolf to down play further
1311987220035760128 2020-10-02 19:11:43 +0800 <Cehyienza> @marlibaby @SovernNation @WhiteHouse Apologies my typos my hards are swollen tonight
1311987088569507850 2020-10-02 19:11:12 +0800 <Cehyienza> @marlibaby @SovernNation @WhiteHouse I personally don't think it is as even with sympathy from his supporters there still the same supports most non supporters have pretty much respond to his tweet that it's karma. Its not gonna be good for his campaign to be expected but if he's smart enough to relize such us the❓
1311984238820909056 2020-10-02 18:59:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @timmsinn @MadeintheUSA7 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse I just hope no deaths occur between them or any one they potentially infected over the past xx number of days. And hope he can gain some perspective of what many americas have/are going threw &amp; it helps him to recognize the need for masks and some empathy for the 200k we've lost.
1311983367588519937 2020-10-02 18:56:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> @timmsinn @MadeintheUSA7 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse On which? The virus is not a hoax of course though many people still believe it is. And I personally believe they have been infected (though many folks are questioning if its true or is it a politcal move or a way to even fake there own deaths etc)
1311981942573682689 2020-10-02 18:50:45 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MadeintheUSA7 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse Independent im not granted the privalge to blindly vote along with 1 party. Ive had to spend many hours and long night locating factual info concerning each candidate then cross refferance such to my own views to see which matches up best to be honest...
1311981078781984768 2020-10-02 18:47:19 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MadeintheUSA7 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse I'm far from liberal, I've always had my views fall on both sides actually a bit more conservative plz dont mistaken my dislike of Trump as me being a liberal (Insert photo attached below)   And I've done my research hours upon hours of factual information gathered as a ..  https://t.co/Zv9vwRa5C3
1311978002985570307 2020-10-02 18:35:05 +0800 <Cehyienza> @MadeintheUSA7 @SovernNation @WhiteHouse I believe your debating your self hun, I've just now seen your responses and to assume to attempt to gaslight a person for not responding.. shame on you!  Also go take a look go read and see how many people currently are concerned this could be a political move for sympathy votes
1311977411563548672 2020-10-02 18:32:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I also hope you will notify any one and every one you and your wife have been in contact with the past 2 weeks and pray none of those individuals catches it when a mask could have lessened that worry that concern may this some how help you to become a better person. Blessed be.
1311976974408007680 2020-10-02 18:31:00 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS May you gain perspective to allow you to grow as a person admit your faults and see life is to short for all the time you have spent fueling hate and devision, also will you now endore wearing a mask dont you wish your advisor had done so?
1311976061299617792 2020-10-02 18:27:23 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Also to hopefully recognize the privilege you have to not have to be evicted/starve/or sleep in a tent or go bankrupt while all the while trying to fight the virus and heal like a mass majority of America's citzens are right now espaiclaly the disportionatly amount of poc.
1311974258562588673 2020-10-02 18:20:13 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I do feel its due to your own lack of responsibility however I do wish u both well also I can only hope during this frieghting time of unknown how the virus will symptoms will progress i would only ask you use this time to gain perspective and allow that to transfer into empathy

1311968486487285760 2020-10-02 17:57:17 +0800 <Cehyienza> @SovernNation @WhiteHouse Secondly how can u know that the letters really from his doctor and not typed up other wise.   I do believe its legit but the fact remains many don't and power needs to be transfered to pence during his quarantine
1311968132118966274 2020-10-02 17:55:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @SovernNation @WhiteHouse First of all i do think an independent test is needed just to make sure all legit as its possible this could be a voter sympathy politcal move. That and a ton of his supports still think he's doing just that and not actually positive. Secondly

1308423828616261632 2020-09-22 23:12:04 +0800 <Cehyienza> All I know is I've been on edge scince, not to mention the 14 panic attacks that have occurred between 10pm last night and now coupled with the exhaustion of no sleep. Things like this just don't happen for no reason. What are officials not telling us?

If they come back with a negitive answer.   Then I will be completely stumped.   During my research it does apear events just like this have...
1308420673052778498 2020-09-22 22:59:32 +0800 <Cehyienza> Dopler radar shows clear sky's at the time not even a cloud.  And that definitely was not lightning.   No current report of physical explosion or fire in the area at the time (as in no plane crashes or home dmages)    No known meters or comets in the area at the time.
1308420049288540164 2020-09-22 22:57:03 +0800 <Cehyienza> So fire and police couldn't locate the cause.   Northwesternenergy came and checked the gas line for leak -negative. (No leak) also they stated no known transformer issues  No seismic or volcanic activity (confirmed from last night's data)
1308419348298596353 2020-09-22 22:54:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> Zero sleep. Still no explanation to what caused the explosive event last night. have looked into the possibility last night left with either something happened that went unreported or unreleased by the airport or no explanation at all. Folks over 20 miles away felt or heard it!!

1308280754640617473 2020-09-22 13:43:33 +0800 <Cehyienza> Massive #Explosion type sound large bright flash and forceful shake rocked homes near #bozeman Airport frontage rd &amp; Voegele in #Belgrade #montana to be exact. Police/fire couldn't find a reason. Any one have any idea what it could have been? #Unexplained #Perplexed #PanicAttack

1307518720848265216 2020-09-20 11:15:30 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump In addition not one time did I attack you directly, yet you assumed things about my parents (FYI which was far from the truth) then you assume my intellectual level is low (I.Q. 156!!) then you assume i'ma a liberal. You sir need to learn to ask questions not assume! Good day!
1307517919937454082 2020-09-20 11:12:19 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Now either respect my views or get out of my originally you do you but orginally asked why trump did the interview and I gave you a professional and honest answer narsccist love to hear them selfs speaks thats a fact.
1307517443942658048 2020-09-20 11:10:25 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump If you strip back the politics and look at trump for what he is .. a human and his actions he has taken on this earth. Its clear that he is not fit to be president and actually needs to be treated for mental illness and personality disorder. #trumpNeedsMentalHelp
1307516888973340672 2020-09-20 11:08:13 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump It's gotten to the point that finally many of the more intelligent Republicans have seen the light and formed. #RepublicansAgainstTrump.  Also let's not forget the study which shows mass majority of trump supporters are of low intelligence and there for he's able to manipulate
1307516231868506112 2020-09-20 11:05:36 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump But actually he's done alot wrong, not saying other candidates have not either. Then let look The fact trump idolizes dictators and has made direct indication that he himself sees himself becoming the Dictionar of America. He also tramps over many parts of the constitution.
1307515623094644736 2020-09-20 11:03:11 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Its a mix of fear of change, a bit if Qanon brainwashing, his preexisting fans from his entertainment time and ofcourse there's the fact is been proven a large mass of trump supporter are blind to his faults as the many deflects them left and right. So to them he's done no wrong
1307514983966584832 2020-09-20 11:00:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Why not take a moment to look at things from another's perspective put your self in the shoes of some one who does not respect or support trump I've done the same my self and I see exactly whats happened and why trump supporters follow him blindly
1307514483099668483 2020-09-20 10:58:39 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Also has any one ever taught you its proper to assume? To assume is to not think. I've spent hours upon hours presenting facts trump supports never listen and there for why continue to waste my time? You want facts open your eyes and research!
1307513851915632640 2020-09-20 10:56:09 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Possibility prior to voting. I've done just that but trump as a person has no moral compus and the way people blindly follow him is cult like mentality.
1307513496150536194 2020-09-20 10:54:44 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump To the lesser evil candidate. I also live in a red state whom I love and am proud of thats doing amazing (compared to others) dispite covid-19 thanks to our center left Gov. But I'll never blindly follow any party or any candidate. People but ask questions look at all
1307512293148688384 2020-09-20 10:49:57 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump I've voted republican many times in past but not trump I will not he's a vial man who has no empathy i will not vote for a narsccist and a misogynistic pig. Biden has his issues too yes as does Jo jorgensen and the rest this year like last is gonna come down
1307511617941200896 2020-09-20 10:47:16 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Funny you assume i'ma liberal? I have and will always be independent. I spend hours upon hours research each candidate. I vote for the person not the party. My views are from. Both side. If anything one could say I'm center right actually.

1307441439719092225 2020-09-20 06:08:24 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Trump should be responsible for all the funerals of those who passed for covid-19 stop giving out grants to foreign natitions and take care the US citizen you knew and did nothing!!

1305997854905790465 2020-09-16 06:32:07 +0800 <Cehyienza> 100%,  I also believe #Q is either trump or a member of the trump family or some one trump hired to deflect trumps own quilt of pedophilia! Open your eyes he's said it him self "many of them are on the younger side" #trumpisapedo #savethetmchildrenfromtrump
1305925547797614592 2020-09-16 01:44:48 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DavidKn47482039 @realDonaldTrump @marceyplay If you truly believe that I highly suggest you seek mental health evaluation. Delusions are a symptom of a few different mental illnesses that treatment can help
1305923443251052544 2020-09-16 01:36:26 +0800 <Cehyienza> @DrHowardLevy1 @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha fucking pine cone 🤣

1305586412738101249 2020-09-15 03:17:12 +0800 <Cehyienza> This is so so so true!
1305586190591041536 2020-09-15 03:16:19 +0800 <Cehyienza> @StephenKing Actually a lot of what he is doing is against American laws but yet he preaches law trump is a narsccist hypocrite why do people not see he is trying to be a dictator. He is bending the minds of the unintelligent to see him as a God #TrumpsNoGod #Prison4Trump
1305584382938238977 2020-09-15 03:09:08 +0800 <Cehyienza> Thats because he is a narsccist he him self wants to be a dictator he believes he already is why do you think he keeps making pointless unforcable executive orders. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
1305583836361703424 2020-09-15 03:06:57 +0800 <Cehyienza> @FinFox2 @realDonaldTrump Hunny you answered your own question. They don't have common sense. His supporters are nothing more then cult like fans. The intelligent Republicans know he is trash wants to be usa dictator. They have formed the replicans against trump. And will be voting for biden
1305582806462996480 2020-09-15 03:02:52 +0800 <Cehyienza> @realDonaldTrump Next year you'll be in jail!! How does it feel to know your such a failure?
