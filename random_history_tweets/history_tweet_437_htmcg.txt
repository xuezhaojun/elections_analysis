1344037774844977167 2020-12-30 05:49:11 +0800 <htmcg> #GoodTimes What was his deal, anyway? Almost everyone in DC gets corrupted — some more easily than others. That's why #TermLimitsNow makes so much sense.

1343685781660041217 2020-12-29 06:30:29 +0800 <htmcg> I hope it works.
1343637110348279808 2020-12-29 03:17:05 +0800 <htmcg> They always hate the Republican du jour. They want to annihilate all Republicans. They don't want there to be a Republican Party.
1342981064499855367 2020-12-27 07:50:11 +0800 <htmcg> Congratulations!
1342980608969101316 2020-12-27 07:48:23 +0800 <htmcg> @Re_Folk I am so sorry for your loss.
1342542425491972100 2020-12-26 02:47:12 +0800 <htmcg> Some people are extremely selfish. They manipulate others and disregard the wants of others. They may be narcissists.  High self-worth (knowing you are a person of inestimable value) is different from high self-esteem (thinking you are better than you are and better than others).
1342360582712938502 2020-12-25 14:44:37 +0800 <htmcg> My wife says they do. I made one five years old though, and there was no problem.
1342251630281035777 2020-12-25 07:31:41 +0800 <htmcg> She can't. President Trump can.
1342217687238397953 2020-12-25 05:16:48 +0800 <htmcg> @philthatremains I hope she recovers.
1342216930799845376 2020-12-25 05:13:48 +0800 <htmcg> What *does make sense* about this past election?
1342209119386791940 2020-12-25 04:42:45 +0800 <htmcg> It is strange that some people, perhaps having room for nothing but misery in their lives, wish to visit misery on others whom they envy.  Thank you, Bo, for your compassion.
1342208621325774848 2020-12-25 04:40:47 +0800 <htmcg> The headline is wrong. The story is right. House Minority leader.
1342208431185403904 2020-12-25 04:40:01 +0800 <htmcg> Odd that the headline is wrong. The story headline when you click on it clearly says Minority.

1342174672230752256 2020-12-25 02:25:52 +0800 <htmcg> Chris Cuomo is full of holiday cheer, isn't he?
1342172539175448576 2020-12-25 02:17:24 +0800 <htmcg> @NFG_Liberals I cannot conceive of your grief but I am very sorry for your loss.
1342162270495895554 2020-12-25 01:36:36 +0800 <htmcg> They had a good run until they started meddling in propaganda and politics.
1341781558366187522 2020-12-24 00:23:47 +0800 <htmcg> She is employing misdirection. She talks about the $600, not about all the destructive anti-American provisions of the bill, which *must not* become law.
1341644571852345344 2020-12-23 15:19:27 +0800 <htmcg> I think he means if he is inaugurated. That would be the case.
1341641118526693377 2020-12-23 15:05:43 +0800 <htmcg> I have a better idea. Pass a bill that has one item. Stimulus checks for Americans. Don't let one word of pork into the bill.
1341459628647919624 2020-12-23 03:04:33 +0800 <htmcg> You voted YES to provide the fattest pork platter your party could cook up. Americans need jobs, not pittances.
1341459348569157635 2020-12-23 03:03:26 +0800 <htmcg> For the same reason that every American senator should vote against it — "We have to pass the bill to find out what's in the bill," is evil. Pure evil. Someone knows what's in it, and it's surely not for the good of America or we would know what's in it.
1341427512581238785 2020-12-23 00:56:56 +0800 <htmcg> If every Conservative in Congress voted no on every pork bill, including this one, we would have a true representation of the voters' will.  Or, are there no Conservatives in Congress? Don't fool yourself, $600 is not helpful for people who need a job.
1340101410424320007 2020-12-19 09:07:28 +0800 <htmcg> Let us know when it unrolls.
1340028325054599170 2020-12-19 04:17:03 +0800 <htmcg> I am confident that some were fraudulent votes. I am not as confident that millions were. I think we will learn more, as January 20 approaches.
1339989051122847744 2020-12-19 01:41:00 +0800 <htmcg> Which would be the most ballots ever cast in a general election. It is the highest voter turnout *rate* (not numbers but percent) among eligible citizens since 1900. It's sweet to believe that all those votes came from eligible voters.  But if they didn't, that was fraud.
1339770023276142593 2020-12-18 11:10:39 +0800 <htmcg> It sounds like a life sentence without electronics access is called for.
1339668949584277511 2020-12-18 04:29:02 +0800 <htmcg> Well. I deleted another couple of Tweets. One was woefully out of the context of the thread it was attached to, and the other had woefully bad verb conjugation. So, that's me on Twitter while the world is on fire.
1339660037334163458 2020-12-18 03:53:37 +0800 <htmcg> Does she apologize for lecturing us on unity while cursing us? #JustToBeClear
1339653166674141185 2020-12-18 03:26:19 +0800 <htmcg> Good. Who was in charge of this poll worker and gave the wink and nod to commit fraud? When are they going to prison?
1339652688976486400 2020-12-18 03:24:25 +0800 <htmcg> I hope so. Promises aren't the same as fulfillment. Get a Senator to object to the election and voter fraud and we might have a chance.
1339644343431344128 2020-12-18 02:51:15 +0800 <htmcg> So now rioters are determining the SCOTUS docket. That's nice. It's so comforting to know it.
1339643668995731462 2020-12-18 02:48:34 +0800 <htmcg> Maybe he is a CIA asset, and the FBI knows he is untouchable. #ButProbablyNot
1339642238645776386 2020-12-18 02:42:53 +0800 <htmcg> Hi @HillaryClinton! No strawmen needed here. We don't care how lowlifes talk. We just don't want to be lectured by them on unity while they are cursing our existence. #IHopeYouUnderstand
1339640397484744705 2020-12-18 02:35:34 +0800 <htmcg> @third_and_done @SophistsAwake @BreitbartNews There are not words to describe such atrocities.
1339636520249143296 2020-12-18 02:20:10 +0800 <htmcg> A. I don't need a party to be a patriot. If you bring a viable Patriot Party organization to the next election I will probably support the candidate.  B. When Ms. Harris says "the people have spoken," she means the software has spoken.  We will go with the voices of legal voters.
1339615467976187905 2020-12-18 00:56:31 +0800 <htmcg> Not 81 million legal votes, no.
1339413467439243264 2020-12-17 11:33:50 +0800 <htmcg> I know there is precedent for this.
1339402776649068549 2020-12-17 10:51:21 +0800 <htmcg> Cancer is hard.
1339400050091421696 2020-12-17 10:40:31 +0800 <htmcg> Do you have to be a doctor? #AskingForAFriend
1339380047766040582 2020-12-17 09:21:02 +0800 <htmcg> Let's think about that. If it was the most secure ever, then have we ever had a secure election? Because this was wildly insecure.
1339379497481744385 2020-12-17 09:18:51 +0800 <htmcg> Of 74,223,744 votes in 2020 for President Trump, I have heard no claim that any of them were illegal.  In 2012, Obama got 65,915,795 votes. Trump in 2020 got 8,307,949 more votes than Obama in 2012.  Biden in 2020 got 81,283,485 votes, or 7,059,741 more than Trump.  #WhatSmells?
1339340392106430468 2020-12-17 06:43:27 +0800 <htmcg> My mother always pounded the toughness out of it with a meat hammer — the one with the grid of little pyramids on the striking surface.
1339339829922975746 2020-12-17 06:41:13 +0800 <htmcg> That's only part of the story. If Biden got 80,000,000 legal votes, then it is our turn to step back...  Is there any ******possible way****** that Biden got 80,000,000 legal votes? *That* is what we want to know about.
1339338828755185664 2020-12-17 06:37:15 +0800 <htmcg> Perhaps they were covering for Biden because they are on his side. #JustAGuess
1339298830043508737 2020-12-17 03:58:18 +0800 <htmcg> You don't know? Because (1) President Trump touted it before the FDA approved it for use for COVID-19, so to a liberal, that ***had*** to be wrong, and (2) Nobody is getting big dollars for developing HCQ. We already have it.
1339264332434116609 2020-12-17 01:41:13 +0800 <htmcg> Unless the voter cuts off their finger and then goes to vote a second time.
1339263982285312003 2020-12-17 01:39:50 +0800 <htmcg> Just because there is no danger doesn't mean you're safe!!!!!!!!!!!!
1339256307128397827 2020-12-17 01:09:20 +0800 <htmcg> "Last Christmas," it's not even a contest.
1339252476449583104 2020-12-17 00:54:07 +0800 <htmcg> :-D
1339251043343937537 2020-12-17 00:48:25 +0800 <htmcg> Well, they meant, openly gay and Democrat, obviously.
1338898530338004992 2020-12-16 01:27:39 +0800 <htmcg> I am sorry to hear that some people are behaving rudely on Twitter. Sadly, that is what one frequently finds on Twitter.  I hope they would not abuse you to your face if you met on the street, but society is abandoning kindness and respect, so they might.
1338884018830446594 2020-12-16 00:30:00 +0800 <htmcg> That is why the Democrats made all these changes; they sow disorder and confusion and obscure vote theft.  #TheMoreYouKnow
1338877268760866818 2020-12-16 00:03:10 +0800 <htmcg> The public has been falsely told that the popular vote went to Joe Biden.  Will it be publicly known that software to change their vote was used against them to steal votes from President Trump?  It looks like more Americans voted for President Trump than for Biden.  #TrueTheVote
1338873390686416896 2020-12-15 23:47:46 +0800 <htmcg> I wonder what little Noah's parents did to him that he is so broken?
1338871407615365123 2020-12-15 23:39:53 +0800 <htmcg> :-/
1338635975384326145 2020-12-15 08:04:21 +0800 <htmcg> This is laughable.  He is leaving the establishment because the actions of the anti-establishment president are unacceptable to him. So he joins the other arm of the establishment.  🤣
1338614761219559427 2020-12-15 06:40:03 +0800 <htmcg> Right. That's what makes me so sad for America — cheaters prosper.
1338610672851181569 2020-12-15 06:23:49 +0800 <htmcg> I hope so.
1338607802370170881 2020-12-15 06:12:24 +0800 <htmcg> The Alistair Sim version is on YouTube under the name Scrooge. At least it was last year.

1338534469129662464 2020-12-15 01:21:00 +0800 <htmcg> I don't think that's how we elect in this country.
1337878532664463361 2020-12-13 05:54:33 +0800 <htmcg> A Ph.D. is a doctorate. A person with a Ph.D. is a doctor of philosophy. A person with an M.D. is a doctor of medicine. A person with a J.D. is a doctor of law.
1337612975629357057 2020-12-12 12:19:19 +0800 <htmcg> We *did* win outside the margin of fraud. So they stopped the count in four states and multiplied the fraud.  There is no limit to the number of counterfeit votes cheaters can produce.
1337469652470018050 2020-12-12 02:49:48 +0800 <htmcg> The controversy is that the transgender participants want you to see them as their identifying gender and not as their biological sex, and some people don't want to make that allowance.  Perhaps there should be a transgender sports category — or two, one for each biological type.
1337465387261325317 2020-12-12 02:32:51 +0800 <htmcg> #WhatPoliticsHasTaughtMeThisYear  1. It is impossible to prevent stealing an election. 2. When an election has been stolen, it is impossible to overturn it. 3. Democrats can only win by stealing an election. 4. Republicans don't steal. 5. Democrats will always win by stealing.
1337433856639692801 2020-12-12 00:27:34 +0800 <htmcg> And they always make it more dramatic. How can they dramatize this? Perhaps he received 262 million votes?
1337433618776469504 2020-12-12 00:26:37 +0800 <htmcg> It will not pass.
1337197973831380992 2020-12-11 08:50:15 +0800 <htmcg> Maybe they live under the porch, or in the bushes?
1337175745119072256 2020-12-11 07:21:55 +0800 <htmcg> As usual. I know the public is always getting played by one voice or another. But are not eyewitness reports good for anything?
1337174497322033153 2020-12-11 07:16:58 +0800 <htmcg> Which is what all the lawsuits that have been dismissed have been trying to do.
1337173768486182914 2020-12-11 07:14:04 +0800 <htmcg> It's nice to know what's going to happen before it does.  Instead of throwing out all the votes — of innocent and knave alike, could we throw out the counterfeit votes, the duplicate votes, the suitcase votes, the software-tweaked votes, the deceased votes, and the illegal votes?
1337172625311879169 2020-12-11 07:09:31 +0800 <htmcg> I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so, I hope so.   Did I mention that I hope so?
1337091168291713024 2020-12-11 01:45:51 +0800 <htmcg> I was born in New Orleans. Moved to Norfolk when I was a month old. Moved to Staten Island when I was three years old, etc. Does that count? #ImNotFromAroundHere
1337083735389433856 2020-12-11 01:16:18 +0800 <htmcg> Simplification. Drawing is one form of craftsmanship and painting is another. A good draftsman isn't necessarily a good painter, nor vice versa. Art isn't just about representing what you see but what you wonder or feel. Not all art is good, of course. But new art isn't all bad.
1336884228634578945 2020-12-10 12:03:32 +0800 <htmcg> Isn't that special?
1336799455354511365 2020-12-10 06:26:41 +0800 <htmcg> It's never what you do, it's who you are when you do it. It turns out, President Trump was guilty of winning while Republican, and no one wanted that.  Except for Americans.
1336792899833487361 2020-12-10 06:00:38 +0800 <htmcg> She doesn't have enough pull. She should have waited until she got into the U.S. House before trying such nonsense.
1336792544433332226 2020-12-10 05:59:13 +0800 <htmcg> Make the kind where you go to a grocery store and buy them ready-made. Then put them on a plate.  Or make the toll-house cookie recipe on a package of Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate chips. You can experiment with the amount of flour. Mine turned out too buttery and soft. Makes 36.
1336716350618820609 2020-12-10 00:56:27 +0800 <htmcg> It's hard to see an alternative.

1336713521757827076 2020-12-10 00:45:13 +0800 <htmcg> It is probably why she appointed him.

1336059220823838720 2020-12-08 05:25:15 +0800 <htmcg> Maybe the judge mistakenly thought this was about the 2016 election. After all, there has been fraud in every election controlled by Democrats.
1336054191723343872 2020-12-08 05:05:16 +0800 <htmcg> Do we drive a truckload of completed ballots around the country in America? I wasn't aware! #Wut?

1335996050641924098 2020-12-08 01:14:14 +0800 <htmcg> My father-in-law was a Pearl Harbor Survivor, on the U.S.S. Oglala. He is gone now but served proudly in the Navy for four years.
1335991786309869569 2020-12-08 00:57:18 +0800 <htmcg> It's not that it's hard. It's that they don't want election integrity. #TheMoreYouKnow
1335987129357393920 2020-12-08 00:38:47 +0800 <htmcg> Why we need judges that respect the law.
1335978156696670209 2020-12-08 00:03:08 +0800 <htmcg> It is what defines them as "liberals."
1335977275335073793 2020-12-07 23:59:38 +0800 <htmcg> Hey, @matthewdmarsden, thanks, for the follow!
1335975121203421187 2020-12-07 23:51:04 +0800 <htmcg> As always, the people you know reveal their friendship or their enmity by their actions. Real friends are rare and precious. They do not judge you through their values but let you keep your values. Best hopes for finding real friends.
1335974302391414784 2020-12-07 23:47:49 +0800 <htmcg> I am very sorry for your loss. Most family members of suicides are blind-sided. The troubled person hides their intent from those they love because they don't want to be dissuaded. He knew you would try to save him.  You could not have saved him.
1335010361804791808 2020-12-05 07:57:28 +0800 <htmcg> Remember, the Republican party is part of the establishment.  President Trump was elected to drain the swamp, which means to dismantle the establishment.  GOP establishment types are not eager to be displaced.
1335009704972591109 2020-12-05 07:54:51 +0800 <htmcg> Assuming evidence hasn't already been destroyed. Because I suspect it has.
1334925661987876867 2020-12-05 02:20:54 +0800 <htmcg> It would be good business, as long as they kept loyal users. I am loyal to a free account. For $.01, I close my account.
1334916739046498306 2020-12-05 01:45:26 +0800 <htmcg> I am sorry for your loss.
1334741081490153473 2020-12-04 14:07:26 +0800 <htmcg> That went South fast. Unexpectedly.
1334542156242055168 2020-12-04 00:56:59 +0800 <htmcg> I wouldn't say mediocre. Page (as Ellen Page) has been nominated for many awards and won a few of the lesser-known awards. I enjoyed the artist formerly known as Ellen Page in The Umbrella Academy.  I wonder if Elliot Page claims those accolades or is he starting fresh?
1333893946083319808 2020-12-02 06:01:13 +0800 <htmcg> I think the gasping may occur when someone outside their people tries to define their circumstances. It appears to be OK when an accepted member does it.
1333892860056395778 2020-12-02 05:56:55 +0800 <htmcg> It's who they are. They are motivated only by contempt.
1333594330402000896 2020-12-01 10:10:40 +0800 <htmcg> I am sorry for your loss. I hope that sharing this helps you cope and helps others who may be in a similar situation.
1333585081450049539 2020-12-01 09:33:54 +0800 <htmcg> There is no news about this.
1333528746230509571 2020-12-01 05:50:03 +0800 <htmcg> I don't. But then I'm not a Californian. I'm an Illinoisan, which is even more excruciating.
1333510823629742080 2020-12-01 04:38:50 +0800 <htmcg> The legal dispute won't go away, fortunately.
1333479473459720194 2020-12-01 02:34:15 +0800 <htmcg> About time. But what is he offering, a pork platter or COVID-19 relief?
1333449967395086338 2020-12-01 00:37:01 +0800 <htmcg> I understand your point. I hope it is not true. Hundreds of thousands of votes appearing in the dead of night, predominantly for one candidate, sounds like fraud. If proven, I hope the numbers align for President Trump.
1333449076629704709 2020-12-01 00:33:28 +0800 <htmcg> Anyone can break a foot in a fall. But it is more likely among the aged and infirm.

1332494586971893761 2020-11-28 09:20:40 +0800 <htmcg> The cat licked the ham at our feast but there was no pie to step in.
1332031998840463362 2020-11-27 02:42:31 +0800 <htmcg> Today I am thankful for everything good in life, including my parents, my siblings, my wife, my daughter, my grandson, my friends, and most of all, I am thankful for Jesus Christ and God's infinite love.  #GiveThanks
1332006002779152388 2020-11-27 00:59:13 +0800 <htmcg> Whatever it is, it strikes deep. He ties the law into knots to protect the Progressive camp.
1331986628622114816 2020-11-26 23:42:14 +0800 <htmcg> That is sensible. Cheating is illegal. But if the cheating didn't affect the outcome, the election stands. The cheaters should be prosecuted in any event.  However, it may turn out that the cheating did affect the outcome. If it did, the election results must be voided.
1331817924353519618 2020-11-26 12:31:51 +0800 <htmcg> Thank you for sharing this. I hope anyone who has no food in their home can find a place to get a meal. I am glad you have a better circumstance today.
1331752944165904391 2020-11-26 08:13:39 +0800 <htmcg> A. The Republican Party never really did support President Trump, except for lip service, and B. Who cares what talking heads think?
1331283277571887105 2020-11-25 01:07:22 +0800 <htmcg> Sure. He knows where the bodies (literally or figuratively, you pick) are buried.
1331061510597201926 2020-11-24 10:26:08 +0800 <htmcg> It doesn't matter who believes what. What matters is how many of Biden's votes were invalid. Enough to flip the election to President Trump? #LetUsSee
1331060498452926469 2020-11-24 10:22:07 +0800 <htmcg> You can put it in your sink (or bathtub if it's big) Wednesday night and run a trickle of cold water over it all night. It will be thawed by the morning. It works.
1331021938421010437 2020-11-24 07:48:53 +0800 <htmcg> Money well spent, I expect.
1330979416118349833 2020-11-24 04:59:55 +0800 <htmcg> Yeah. Our phone app had that feature. Never have I used it. I set the thermostat once for an upper temperature to trigger the AC and a lower temperature to trigger the heat. Away we go. I only touch it when the technician comes to maintain our systems.
1330978373838008330 2020-11-24 04:55:47 +0800 <htmcg> For no particular reason, probably.
1330978238533922819 2020-11-24 04:55:15 +0800 <htmcg> What Wi-Fi permitted was the thermostat looking up the outside temperature which they read from the factory network. Now we open the door or look at the weather app on our phones to see what the outside temperature is. Life goes on.
1330977135708823552 2020-11-24 04:50:52 +0800 <htmcg> On another subject. We had a Wi-Fi smart thermostat added about three years ago. 18 months ago we upgraded our Wi-Fi to 5g. Umm... our thermostat won't work with our router. The factory affirms it. So, someone else might hack it, but I can't. It still controls the furnace and AC.
1330926758833631233 2020-11-24 01:30:41 +0800 <htmcg> Now that it is widely known she is working independently, I hope her efforts are wildly productive in court.
1330919526758817795 2020-11-24 01:01:57 +0800 <htmcg> This is a little close, I agree.
1330919315042930702 2020-11-24 01:01:06 +0800 <htmcg> My brother-in-law usually has 50 people in his home for any holiday. Now, however, he is very ill (not a virus) and we are all respecting his need to isolate with his wife so he is protected from any virus.  Our Thanksgiving will be with eight family members whom we see often.
1330237340091113475 2020-11-22 03:51:11 +0800 <htmcg> Your wife has a sensible method. What if the meal for the evening needs ingredients you don't have because they didn't look good to you? You have to go back to the store.
1330201291088392197 2020-11-22 01:27:56 +0800 <htmcg> If only. I'm afraid they would.
1330037965435899906 2020-11-21 14:38:56 +0800 <htmcg> They stole turkeys from grocers? Or did they use state money to buy them?  #DoesNotTrack
1330036527599153158 2020-11-21 14:33:13 +0800 <htmcg> We bought one 30-pack. Because that's how we buy it at Costco. Plus we have some of our last 30-pack left. Should last until after New Year's.
1330034323513368579 2020-11-21 14:24:28 +0800 <htmcg> I find the same. I am conservative and I am generally happy.
1329896435832197121 2020-11-21 05:16:33 +0800 <htmcg> Lawyered up?! Why, whatever for?
1329874069911719938 2020-11-21 03:47:40 +0800 <htmcg> :-)  Toe the line! A compliant population is a happy and safe population!

1329512386185879552 2020-11-20 03:50:28 +0800 <htmcg> My problem is this is only a dream until official bodies act on it. If this doesn't get a SCOTUS decision before January 20, it will be moot. We will have inaugurated an illegitimate president and there will be nothing we can do about it.
1329490939128246272 2020-11-20 02:25:15 +0800 <htmcg> We'll see who doesn't understand.
1329489559298650114 2020-11-20 02:19:46 +0800 <htmcg> It strikes most people as unlikely because who wants to believe that election officials are committing felonies and expecting to get away with it?  If Giuliani and Powell do not have their facts straight here they will never work again.
1329487445780533249 2020-11-20 02:11:22 +0800 <htmcg> The left has been out of control since about 1963. I want Trump to win through the courts, with the simultaneous prosecution of election officials who rigged the system.

1328730787915632640 2020-11-18 00:04:41 +0800 <htmcg> If it can't be verified, it is not a legal vote. That's not so hard, is it? #VotingScience

Did Democrats sue to eliminate signature matching and postal date stamping of envelopes (for ballots, I assume)?  It seems some states did this without waiting for court rulings.
1326374659064033284 2020-11-11 12:02:16 +0800 <htmcg> President Obama did.   https://t.co/lGzrtMWPOR

1326318826045239299 2020-11-11 08:20:24 +0800 <htmcg> And yet, did their favored candidate win or lose? If you think President Trump has won, you are very optimistic.
1326229409632833538 2020-11-11 02:25:06 +0800 <htmcg> This Tweet is disputed.
1326222531028770816 2020-11-11 01:57:46 +0800 <htmcg> Hi @Sarahcpr. Are you saying that the boxes of ballots that came in the dead of night after Election Day had ended are the votes of blacks? You don't mean to accuse blacks of voter fraud, do you? Most blacks voted legally, I believe.
1326216002825281537 2020-11-11 01:31:49 +0800 <htmcg> They pre-arranged it on Facebook. LOL
1326215750814740481 2020-11-11 01:30:49 +0800 <htmcg> There's the hope that the perpetrators will be caught, indicted, tried, and convicted.  There's also the hope that the number of fraudulent ballots, when removed from the valid ballots, will give the race to President Trump. That is a lot to hope for, but hope is good, right?
1326213955812003845 2020-11-11 01:23:41 +0800 <htmcg> They could both be true. However, it is established that there was fraud. I am very interested to know whether the amount of fraud involved gave the race to Biden, or whether Biden would have won fraud-free.

1325956669470363648 2020-11-10 08:21:19 +0800 <htmcg> I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope. And I will believe it after I see it.
1325921840003489797 2020-11-10 06:02:55 +0800 <htmcg> I believe it will be necessary to investigate the software used to count the ballots in the battleground states. Also investigate the data entry operators. Something smells terrible.
1325909643135250436 2020-11-10 05:14:27 +0800 <htmcg> "A flunky." I guess it takes one to know one; amiright @AWeissmann_  ?
1325905773227106304 2020-11-10 04:59:05 +0800 <htmcg> If the intent to defraud is shown in the software coding or the operators of the software, I hope prison time is on the docket.
1325905418967715840 2020-11-10 04:57:40 +0800 <htmcg> And will it add up to a Trump win? Not holding my breath.
1325904962698743816 2020-11-10 04:55:51 +0800 <htmcg> There will only be a meltdown if legal action is taken that gives President Trump the election. Without President Trump winning, nothing "exposed" matters.
1325851088826851328 2020-11-10 01:21:47 +0800 <htmcg> It sounds like a threat, doesn't it? "Nice job you've got there. Sure would be a shame if your employer were to find out you wanted President Trump to contest the election."
1325845805710848000 2020-11-10 01:00:47 +0800 <htmcg> Hi Jake. The premise is that somebody has lost. Let's see what the recounts and the audits show before deciding who has lost.  Your advice on a peaceful transfer of power is supported by our traditions, once the winner is determined, which does not depend on the media, obviously.
1325840523538653185 2020-11-10 00:39:48 +0800 <htmcg> Or, to put it simply, Socialism is the equal distribution of misery.  She really *does* understand!
1325833293246443521 2020-11-10 00:11:04 +0800 <htmcg> Let me guess. These were the first 42,000 votes cast on November 3, am I right? #AskingForAFriend
1325826693735583751 2020-11-09 23:44:51 +0800 <htmcg> In a ballot dump, that is.
1325824471719145473 2020-11-09 23:36:01 +0800 <htmcg> And yes. I hope enough evidence is brought forward to change the outcome. That would be a lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-t of evidence. :-/
1325509994901610497 2020-11-09 02:46:24 +0800 <htmcg> I hope they find that President Trump won the battleground states by large margins. Anything less will not matter.
1325463467906752512 2020-11-08 23:41:31 +0800 <htmcg> Then let her report it on any platform that will allow it to run.
1325463151828234243 2020-11-08 23:40:15 +0800 <htmcg> Please let us know how it all turns out. If you can prove that President Trump received more admissible votes than Biden, make sure it happens in court.
1325462451157159936 2020-11-08 23:37:28 +0800 <htmcg> What remains to be proven is that illegal or inadmissible  votes turned battleground states over to Biden. Please, please, please, please, please prove that.
1324831588744679424 2020-11-07 05:50:39 +0800 <htmcg> Someone? or Many ones? #LetJusticePrevail
1324806420617977859 2020-11-07 04:10:39 +0800 <htmcg> Remember when we thought that politics was between Democrats and Republicans?  We see today that it is between the establishment and the outsider. The establishment is doing everything legal, quasi-legal, and feloniously illegal to put the outsider, President Trump, back outside.
1324805736967393281 2020-11-07 04:07:56 +0800 <htmcg> First, they will have to be taught the meaning of shame. Without accountability, they have never had to feel shame.
1324556537080238083 2020-11-06 11:37:42 +0800 <htmcg> Why is that that the more votes are counted, the closer the results get? Are all new votes automatically for Biden? Do they even look at the ballot to see who it is voted for, or is it just counted for Biden blindly?
1324505165882368000 2020-11-06 08:13:34 +0800 <htmcg> Jonah is projecting, as progressives do.
1324504549051289600 2020-11-06 08:11:07 +0800 <htmcg> Jim is projecting, as progressives do.
1324503581039493121 2020-11-06 08:07:16 +0800 <htmcg> Twitter wanted me to find out more about election security when I just wanted to comment on this. I have seen enough to know that the only security Democrats want is from an examination of their activities.
1324445018657087488 2020-11-06 04:14:34 +0800 <htmcg> I really want you to be right.
1324444897106079744 2020-11-06 04:14:05 +0800 <htmcg> Perhaps they have an agenda.
1324434967582179329 2020-11-06 03:34:37 +0800 <htmcg> I know a man who did that. He feels very blessed.  You could meet your future wife at a church single's group or anywhere else people gather who may have similar values to yours.
1324127880314499072 2020-11-05 07:14:22 +0800 <htmcg> If he wins. I want him to win, but he's 2.3 million votes behind. It's not looking awesome for him.
1324126987397566464 2020-11-05 07:10:49 +0800 <htmcg> Wait until Philadelphia's mail-in votes are counted. I don't know why everyone in Philadelphia mailed in their vote, but it is a predominantly Democrat area.
1324091040031072256 2020-11-05 04:47:59 +0800 <htmcg> By "accidentally" adding a "0" at the end of 15K+ votes. It has been corrected and Michigan is again a toss-up.
1324066664720326656 2020-11-05 03:11:07 +0800 <htmcg> Some are saying it is because WI allows same-day voter registration. But, would the majority of same-day registrations be Democrat? It bears investigation.
1324051835922092036 2020-11-05 02:12:12 +0800 <htmcg> Do you remember all the people who thought voting by mail or dropbox was awesome?  This is what you get. An unknown result, the day after.  Always vote on Election Day and your vote will be counted on Election Day.
1324049932840558592 2020-11-05 02:04:38 +0800 <htmcg> Audit Michigan and Wisconsin. These are cases where we *do* want to see how the sausage is made.
1324026387137744899 2020-11-05 00:31:04 +0800 <htmcg> Surprisingly.
1324023858752561161 2020-11-05 00:21:01 +0800 <htmcg> When you haven't set your bedside clock yet because it takes about 15 minutes to find in the instructions how to set the time, and about 5 minutes to do it and it's just not worth the time...
1324015681713676291 2020-11-04 23:48:32 +0800 <htmcg> Reasonable. But it is crucial to establish the chain of custody. If new votes are”found,” it is quite different than if they were right where they were supposed to be by the time the counting stopped yesterday, and none were added before counting starts again.
1323881302500716544 2020-11-04 14:54:33 +0800 <htmcg> Remember, @Jack, @Twitter is a platform, not a publisher.
1323756224962318338 2020-11-04 06:37:32 +0800 <htmcg> ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ !
1323755435460038658 2020-11-04 06:34:24 +0800 <htmcg> All politics is local.
1323718036780711938 2020-11-04 04:05:48 +0800 <htmcg> I'm sorry you are so distressed about this.  Today or sometime recently you could have and may have voted. That is good. What can you do about corruption in the system? Vote for people who pledge to root it out. Also, write your Representatives and Senators.  Are we good? Pax.
1323714800405356545 2020-11-04 03:52:56 +0800 <htmcg> OK. Elucidate, please.
1323714553063112705 2020-11-04 03:51:57 +0800 <htmcg> Because in 1980, Progressives were not overtly following Alinksy's "Rules for Radicals." Now they fight with no holds barred. Conservatives need to unite to keep what we have and gain back what we have lost.
1323713363747229698 2020-11-04 03:47:13 +0800 <htmcg> It is fine to vote early if you cannot vote on Election Day. I might have done it but I get a feel great by participating today. From the time I got in line at 5:44 until the time I left the building was 30 minutes but I was willing to wait longer.  True, we must #FightVoterFraud
1323710794207559681 2020-11-04 03:37:01 +0800 <htmcg> Wait until the machines go back up. Then vote. Stay in line until whatever time it takes to vote.
1323709565607809024 2020-11-04 03:32:08 +0800 <htmcg> Do you have one for me?  Even those people in spots where the voting machines are down will be able to stay in line and vote when the machines come back on. One reason to vote on Election Day: your vote is counted on Election Day. That is important to me.
1323709100107194375 2020-11-04 03:30:17 +0800 <htmcg> I dream of a peaceful transfer of power from Nancy Pelosi to Kevin McCarthy. #PleasePleasePleasePleasePlease
1323707809469472769 2020-11-04 03:25:09 +0800 <htmcg> And yet, I did make plans and I did vote in person today.
1323707377871446027 2020-11-04 03:23:26 +0800 <htmcg> Somebody voted in her place. That is voter fraud. But how do you catch the person who voted illegally? What's done is done. I hope that President Trump wins by such a large margin that the fraudulent vote is immaterial.
1323706732837769219 2020-11-04 03:20:53 +0800 <htmcg> Stay in line until the voting machines are back up. However, a written ballot is no worse than voting by mail. It must be counted.
1323706425349230594 2020-11-04 03:19:39 +0800 <htmcg> This is much better than not getting to vote at all. But stay in line if you want to vote when the machines are back up.
1323706118980468736 2020-11-04 03:18:26 +0800 <htmcg> Thank you for this public service.
1323705847252439047 2020-11-04 03:17:21 +0800 <htmcg> Sincere thanks. I voted. I did a lot of Tweeting, Retweeting, and Replying. Anyone who knows me can be sure who I voted for.  But you devoted time, talent, organization skills, PR, community service, and helping people register to vote. Stay involved. You made a huge difference.
1323651264018845698 2020-11-03 23:40:28 +0800 <htmcg> I got to my polling place at 5:43. I stood in line behind eight people. Fourteen more stood behind me before the door opened. An election judge I know told me that yesterday there were people voting early until after 9:00 p.m.  Anecdotally, interest in this election seems high.
1323649794687049729 2020-11-03 23:34:37 +0800 <htmcg> It will be a great delight if Illinois turns red, thanks to my vote. I don't foresee it, but I hope for it. I voted red.  In two cases, a Democrat was opposed only by a Libertarian, so I voted for a Libertarian. In two cases, no one opposed a Democrat, so I abstained.
1323648441441001473 2020-11-03 23:29:15 +0800 <htmcg> I did. Thank you for the helpful direction!
1323492239012745216 2020-11-03 13:08:33 +0800 <htmcg> They seem, on one hand, to be confident they will (if you ask a pundit), yet shop owners are boarding up as though the Democrats will be rioting on Wednesday. Why would they riot, if they win?
1323441928449499136 2020-11-03 09:48:38 +0800 <htmcg> Good. I’m showing up.
1323405366701547525 2020-11-03 07:23:21 +0800 <htmcg> They would not have hated it if it had fallen Gore's way or HRC's way. They only hate what gets in the way of their power.
1323404906380800002 2020-11-03 07:21:32 +0800 <htmcg> Best wishes. Get ready for cold and snow, in season.
1323404542453710850 2020-11-03 07:20:05 +0800 <htmcg> Agreed. For one thing, advertising a candidate is illegal in the polling place. For the other, why start a fight? Go in, vote, and get out.
1323378646032240641 2020-11-03 05:37:11 +0800 <htmcg> I live in Illinois; it is not considered a swing state. It is counted D. I will still vote tomorrow a straight Republican ballot, individually by race. If no Republican is running in a race I will write in a Republican. What if Illinois *is now* a swing state? My vote will count!
1323375851220729858 2020-11-03 05:26:04 +0800 <htmcg> "Never Trump" might have made some marginal sense before he was elected in 2016. After he was elected and then inaugurated, the term is pure nonsense. How can you say "never Trump," when the president is specifically and only Trump? What does it mean? It's magical thinking.
1323373292342882305 2020-11-03 05:15:54 +0800 <htmcg> Never again.
1323370885437378560 2020-11-03 05:06:20 +0800 <htmcg> How does polling work, @Acosta, when most Conservatives either decline to take polls or conceal their likely vote when polled, not to mention the pollsters asking more Liberals than Conservatives the questions, due to Conservatives ducking the poll? Are polls on the nose, really?
1323368797349289987 2020-11-03 04:58:02 +0800 <htmcg> Let's confound the establishment and the drive-by media again.
1323338396404715521 2020-11-03 02:57:14 +0800 <htmcg> And so it goes.
1323298924338315264 2020-11-03 00:20:23 +0800 <htmcg> As far as pointless polls go, this one does not even support the editorial bent of the NYT. Richards are only 36% for Biden, but Karens are 40% for Trump. Everyone else falls in-between. The poll is more red than blue. President Trump wins this poll by the numbers.
1323137176683581440 2020-11-02 13:37:40 +0800 <htmcg> This is the real time. That is why it is called Standard Time. If you don't like the change, petition to abolish Daylight Savings Time. Then there will be no change and it will always be the real time.
1322773393184301056 2020-11-01 13:32:07 +0800 <htmcg> We had lights on and a bag of candy at the ready. No one seen on our street. Good eating.
1322580169715032066 2020-11-01 00:44:19 +0800 <htmcg> Propaganda never goes out of style.  Also, don't equate fascism with the right wing. Fascism is a system of control Control is sought after by the left much more than by the right.  #TheMoreYouKnow
1322564746156101637 2020-10-31 23:43:02 +0800 <htmcg> Is the NYT committing a random act of journalism?
1322563894485962755 2020-10-31 23:39:39 +0800 <htmcg> There were only Republican and Democrat states.
1322562953422491648 2020-10-31 23:35:54 +0800 <htmcg> Mr. (if I may assume gender) @Coylerspoiler pretends that President Trump is orchestrating a military coup, as happens in a banana republic. He glosses over who is fomenting unrest: the branch of the DNC loosely known as the media with their incessant display of "social justice."
1322405910464110593 2020-10-31 13:11:52 +0800 <htmcg> If you think the movies were tedious, did you read the books? I did trudge through them, once. Brilliant but mind-numbing.
1322402221942865924 2020-10-31 12:57:13 +0800 <htmcg> Policy is the main thing we *should* vote on, @RadioFreeTom. Do we want a president with a weak demeanor and cowering deference toward those who would destroy America from within?  No, we want a president with the strong policy of America first. Period.
1322317658184974336 2020-10-31 07:21:11 +0800 <htmcg> Yes. Even if a Democrat is running unopposed for something, I will not vote for them this time. The stakes are too high.
1322236836228538368 2020-10-31 02:00:02 +0800 <htmcg> I think I've got it.  "I'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize true and inner knacks of a de-pressure!"  If they *are* words...
1322231409348612098 2020-10-31 01:38:28 +0800 <htmcg> ".... true (unintelligible) under pressure"?
1322229398427308033 2020-10-31 01:30:29 +0800 <htmcg> She just assumed your identity! O.o
1322014635961233409 2020-10-30 11:17:05 +0800 <htmcg> Some will miss you. Be safe and take good care of yourself.  https://t.co/j6qfdSKZoS
1322013912255090689 2020-10-30 11:14:13 +0800 <htmcg> Some people are no longer capable of shame. Be careful around them.
1322007771261317121 2020-10-30 10:49:49 +0800 <htmcg> @miles_commodore If it's just chirping for no apparent reason, it needs a new battery.
1322007591745163264 2020-10-30 10:49:06 +0800 <htmcg> I'm afraid the remedy is to cook better.
1321995507363909633 2020-10-30 10:01:05 +0800 <htmcg> Has anyone else seen on Facebook the “If you vote for Trump you are dead to me forever” talking points manifesto?  Talk about manipulative emotional blackmail.  I’m not susceptible to blackmail. I’ll vote on Election Day for four more years.
1321991999763959808 2020-10-30 09:47:08 +0800 <htmcg> He hurt heir feelings by nominating ACB. They were suppressed by profound grief.
1321988065007730688 2020-10-30 09:31:30 +0800 <htmcg> Correct.
1321937579529437185 2020-10-30 06:10:54 +0800 <htmcg> Awesome!
1321908303690158082 2020-10-30 04:14:34 +0800 <htmcg> They use them in the military at age 17. Training is always a requirement. Either lower the age for civilian gun ownership or raise the age of the military to 21, and *that* is not going to happen.
1321874356721618945 2020-10-30 01:59:40 +0800 <htmcg> I am not making any claims for any religious book of any religion. I am saying that regardless of what the sacred writings of Islam say, slaying nonbelievers today is an extremist behavior, not standard behavior.
1321870988372566018 2020-10-30 01:46:17 +0800 <htmcg> We agree that the Bible does not promote stoning, in context as a whole. Jesus said, to those testing Him regarding a woman taken in adultery: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  I am saying that what is in sacred writ is not always practiced.
1321861541742944261 2020-10-30 01:08:45 +0800 <htmcg> You can take this line of reasoning too far. The Old Testament commands stonings for certain violations of the Mosaic Law, but we don't do that now. You can believe in the principles of a book without practicing all the details.
1321858954939506690 2020-10-30 00:58:28 +0800 <htmcg> A rogue low-level staffer, not a high-ranking official. *Unexpectedly!*
1321858014329131016 2020-10-30 00:54:44 +0800 <htmcg> Not legally. But so many seem to act otherwise.
1321855922147393538 2020-10-30 00:46:25 +0800 <htmcg> Recently, I asked my 10-year-old grandson if he wanted me to make him a glass of barbecue milk or chocolate milk. He chose chocolate milk without hesitation.
1321855509377519623 2020-10-30 00:44:46 +0800 <htmcg> "Surprisingly!"
1321842700287647745 2020-10-29 23:53:53 +0800 <htmcg> People want to think what they want to think. Then they spread their misconceptions as "breaking news." #NotVeryEffective
1321821399649079296 2020-10-29 22:29:14 +0800 <htmcg> @Jack Please remove all death threats from Twitter, even those made by Prime Ministers.
1321661182332313605 2020-10-29 11:52:35 +0800 <htmcg> Arrest him, please. Isn't lying to Congress under oath a crime, anymore?
1321512758920228871 2020-10-29 02:02:48 +0800 <htmcg> I use Google Meet instead, as it doesn't cut me off at 50 minutes.  I would rather be in person, but my daughter was just exposed to COVID-19. I want to be on the side of caution, not carelessness.
1321510444822077440 2020-10-29 01:53:37 +0800 <htmcg> Why do some people think it is their privilege to shame others? That is such a curious personality defect.
1321496293122936835 2020-10-29 00:57:23 +0800 <htmcg> "Not aware" because he has staff to manage the hiring. Plausible deniability is a must-have for any CEO.
1321492295586381825 2020-10-29 00:41:30 +0800 <htmcg> Bless them. Principles over party.
1321492112978956295 2020-10-29 00:40:46 +0800 <htmcg> Here is the real lesson. Twitter is not a platform, it is an editorial board.
1321469499040817153 2020-10-28 23:10:54 +0800 <htmcg> Let it not be so.
1321469426747772930 2020-10-28 23:10:37 +0800 <htmcg> One hopes. Nothing is certain yet.
1321317095813058560 2020-10-28 13:05:19 +0800 <htmcg> Why would he care? He’s not president and it doesn’t look like he ever will be.
1321115173147582465 2020-10-27 23:42:57 +0800 <htmcg> He could be working 12-hour days somewhere inside, going over polls, planning appearances, and covering other logistics candidates have to manage while they're not appearing in public.
1321100566630715397 2020-10-27 22:44:54 +0800 <htmcg> O.o
1320935461930586112 2020-10-27 11:48:50 +0800 <htmcg> But even if they do, no politician wants to remove pre-existing conditions protection. Whom would that serve?
1320854647914070016 2020-10-27 06:27:43 +0800 <htmcg> If they say it, then to a low-information voter, it makes sense. They couldn't say it if it weren't right, amiright?
1320845192518356992 2020-10-27 05:50:08 +0800 <htmcg> It is @Twitter that is misleading. They're projecting.
1320826051312918530 2020-10-27 04:34:05 +0800 <htmcg> Asking a candidate a question about their opponent is a non-question. Of course, the candidate is not going to ay any good about their opponent. What is the news value in a foregone conclusion?
1320250045678182400 2020-10-25 14:25:14 +0800 <htmcg> One went by our house this afternoon. Flags flying, horns sounding, and Trump signs. #Awesome
1320016018295717888 2020-10-24 22:55:18 +0800 <htmcg> OK, Chelsea.  Did he have to remind you that you are a white racist?
1319876166782750720 2020-10-24 13:39:34 +0800 <htmcg> The instructions on the pill bottle will state how it is to be administered. Check with your pharmacist before making changes to those instructions.
1319770236074295297 2020-10-24 06:38:39 +0800 <htmcg> They can make up their own reasons and write them down. A blank book is pretty cool.
1319744443713572867 2020-10-24 04:56:09 +0800 <htmcg> Cindy McCain has not been a supporter of President Trump. I would be more surprised if she supported President Trump than that she supports Joe Biden.
1319740904077479936 2020-10-24 04:42:05 +0800 <htmcg> By what standard did Biden win the debate?
1319740240475672581 2020-10-24 04:39:27 +0800 <htmcg> I asked myself the same question about another prominent Democrat. They put themselves in a connected circle, they are groomed to win, Democrat money is applied liberally, their Republican opponent is smeared (justly or unjustly), and they are on their way.
1319739603889303554 2020-10-24 04:36:55 +0800 <htmcg> Intelligent. I don't always agree with him but I always learn something from him.
1319693226522148873 2020-10-24 01:32:38 +0800 <htmcg> Progress happens. Sailmakers did not become steamfitters. They either learned a trade or they starved. Progress hurts some people (older workers) and helps others (the young).  The worse problem is that AOC thinks wind turbines mean progress. They harm the planet more than oil.
1319692200956076035 2020-10-24 01:28:34 +0800 <htmcg> It's important to remember that many polls are crafted not to reveal public opinion but to mold it.  The questions are written so that there is a preferred answer; that answer is whatever the authors of the poll want. Polls skew mainly left because the left wants Biden to win.
1319673933445070853 2020-10-24 00:15:58 +0800 <htmcg> NewSpeak
1319673532771696641 2020-10-24 00:14:23 +0800 <htmcg> NewSpeak
1319516748740255746 2020-10-23 13:51:22 +0800 <htmcg> They will pretend. After all, they will have hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day.
1319492231577935872 2020-10-23 12:13:57 +0800 <htmcg> Illinois
1319423977278869507 2020-10-23 07:42:44 +0800 <htmcg> I listened to it on Facebook. President Trump didn't storm off. Ms. Stahl was only interested in debating him, not interviewing him, so he said that was enough.
1319420845002002432 2020-10-23 07:30:17 +0800 <htmcg> I see your point. You have the frame of mind that nothing President Trump asserts is true, so he must prove his innocence at every turn. That is the bias she shares with you. As for turning the corner, he may be looking at deaths from COVID-19.  https://t.co/cD3noPZuec
1319417423179747329 2020-10-23 07:16:41 +0800 <htmcg> Not for nothing, but these are the growing numbers of retirees who get paid Social Security calculated from their past contributions to the tax rolls. They paid Social Security to support their elders and now younger generations support them. That's life.
1319385876108054533 2020-10-23 05:11:20 +0800 <htmcg> For 60 Minutes, any verification must come from an unnamed insider cultivated by a CBS investigative reporter. As there was no investigation, nor unnamed insiders, that means there is no possibility for them to verify it.
1319384952564219907 2020-10-23 05:07:40 +0800 <htmcg> Thanks for the heads-up. I won't read it. Idealism is good for the young-uns, but it doesn't work in the adult world.
1319384475269201921 2020-10-23 05:05:46 +0800 <htmcg> But, but, they're *JOURNALISTS*! They ask the questions; no one may question *them*!
1319384046963744769 2020-10-23 05:04:04 +0800 <htmcg> What's to change, though? Too many Republicans on it? "Elections matter." — Barack Hussein Obama
1319339177633263618 2020-10-23 02:05:46 +0800 <htmcg> I was just telling my wife this. I have no connection with any of the Senators to know this for a fact, but it is so obviously true.
1319334195009814529 2020-10-23 01:45:58 +0800 <htmcg> The president shared his "archival footage" with America, that's all.  CBS can edit the interview however they like, but they would be smarter not to show it at all. They should just consider it a learning experience and move on.  #SadTrombone
1319332555687120904 2020-10-23 01:39:27 +0800 <htmcg> CBS should strike back by not airing it. LOL
1319330711787180034 2020-10-23 01:32:08 +0800 <htmcg> I think she means it can't be verified by an unnamed source, because they don't have an unnamed source. They only have the shop owner, Rudy Giuliani, and the FBI. :-D
1319327541350510593 2020-10-23 01:19:32 +0800 <htmcg> They should have been defunded the minute the Republicans took control of the House in 2017. What a wasted opportunity!
1319325075531812866 2020-10-23 01:09:44 +0800 <htmcg> It distracts voters from voting for Biden.
1319315521343492096 2020-10-23 00:31:46 +0800 <htmcg> Most of America ignores NPR and doesn't waste time listening to their twaddle. So it's all good.
1319311050618097674 2020-10-23 00:14:00 +0800 <htmcg> Re: Shakespeare. Drama!
1319294873443438593 2020-10-22 23:09:43 +0800 <htmcg> But that is exactly what the Democrats are hoping. So many more ballots are being sent in by mail this year than ever before.
1319140481289342976 2020-10-22 12:56:13 +0800 <htmcg> These things take time — when a prominent Democrat is guilty.  When a Republican is the subject of the investigation, everybody rushes to judgment.
1319049917483130881 2020-10-22 06:56:21 +0800 <htmcg> So many Americans are voting early that when I go in to vote on Election Day, I will probably not have to stand in line. Awesome!
1319043329015894016 2020-10-22 06:30:10 +0800 <htmcg> That is not crazy. If it is postmarked on Election Day, it should count. Anything postmarked on November 4 or later should be incinerated. Does it take 6 days for a letter to go through the U.S. Post Office? With the increased load, it might.
1319042239805460482 2020-10-22 06:25:51 +0800 <htmcg> Americans are polling in favor of confirming ACB. Instead of fighting the American people, @SenSchumer, why don't you fight the deep state? That should keep you busy.
1319040170063220736 2020-10-22 06:17:37 +0800 <htmcg> That would certainly do it. Except, I don't see Biden winning.
1319039950860570625 2020-10-22 06:16:45 +0800 <htmcg> Yep. Although sometimes I add a comment anyway.
1319039641077547014 2020-10-22 06:15:31 +0800 <htmcg> I think in D.C., investigation and prosecution apply to Republicans, not to Democrats.
1319038841546825733 2020-10-22 06:12:21 +0800 <htmcg> Then get a Republican majority in the House. That will do it.
1319038455855386626 2020-10-22 06:10:49 +0800 <htmcg> I'm not a contractor or related to one, but I understand the practice. It protects them if they have to buy materials on your behalf and you back out of the deal. Only use a contractor that has been recommended by a party you trust; that should relieve your concern.
1318995647480107008 2020-10-22 03:20:42 +0800 <htmcg> But it wasn't to do nothing. It was to curry political favor with his father the Vice President.
1318995246240485380 2020-10-22 03:19:07 +0800 <htmcg> Let us hope. America is the world's last hope for freedom.
1318994856673484801 2020-10-22 03:17:34 +0800 <htmcg> What's a few $10 millions among Democrats? You know crimes are for the unconnected, right?
1318994219164438528 2020-10-22 03:15:02 +0800 <htmcg> Ron Reagan is a Liberal. Do you know of many Liberals who want President Trump to be re-elected?
1318960720969715712 2020-10-22 01:01:55 +0800 <htmcg> If the records show it, then it was declared, right? Is there a problem?
1318959852283170824 2020-10-22 00:58:28 +0800 <htmcg> When experts collide.
1318959711962759168 2020-10-22 00:57:55 +0800 <htmcg> He is an example. I appreciate his courage.
1318717703247495168 2020-10-21 08:56:15 +0800 <htmcg> They can't help it. At least 93% of them consider themselves Team Biden.
1318641066900414464 2020-10-21 03:51:44 +0800 <htmcg> The voters are waking up!
1318624130586071042 2020-10-21 02:44:26 +0800 <htmcg> Trump should bring a PA system and when the podium mic goes mute, he picks up the PA mic and carries on.
1318623282812407809 2020-10-21 02:41:04 +0800 <htmcg> So they do have "some" standards, they would have us believe.
1318616342585610245 2020-10-21 02:13:29 +0800 <htmcg> Prayers for a favorable outcome.
1318614982892920832 2020-10-21 02:08:05 +0800 <htmcg> Keep your hands on the desk and behave. All will be well.
1318545451927429120 2020-10-20 21:31:47 +0800 <htmcg> Suppose he is telling the truth when he said he didn't know the camera was on.  Isn't that something he should have made sure of before he abused himself in a virtual meeting?  #NotSmart
1318526108648833026 2020-10-20 20:14:55 +0800 <htmcg> Another perspective:  Let's not rejoice in ignorant, hateful opinions whatever their source. Let's rejoice in thoughtful, considerate opinions, whatever their source.  Being a celebrity makes you neither wiser nor more foolish. It just grows your audience.  Speak well and kindly.
1318399989312356352 2020-10-20 11:53:46 +0800 <htmcg> Do you have the votes to adjourn the Senate? I don't think so. #PleasePlayAgain
1318321385014501378 2020-10-20 06:41:26 +0800 <htmcg> No, because they sat on the exculpatory evidence it holds during the unnecessary impeachment. But I am glad the repair shop owner made multiple backup copies or we would never have known of its contents.
1318233433978667008 2020-10-20 00:51:56 +0800 <htmcg> I love optimism. However, if the Democrats "find" millions of mailed-in votes after Election Day that happen to put Joe Biden over the top, don't give up hope. You can still enjoy God's blessings even while the nation is being carried off to destruction. Live your best life.
1318215589190635526 2020-10-19 23:41:02 +0800 <htmcg> Socialism is the equal distribution of misery.  It has never been “done right.” It cannot be “done right.” It is against human nature. Leave it alone or it will make you miserable, too.
1318191534198673409 2020-10-19 22:05:27 +0800 <htmcg> I didn't, just because I want my vote counted on Election Day, not days later when they get to it.
1317605474888540160 2020-10-18 07:16:39 +0800 <htmcg> Rest assured, I will not friend request you because I know that a few keystrokes exchanged does not constitute a personal relationship. :-)
1317222492495282181 2020-10-17 05:54:49 +0800 <htmcg> There's no harm in hoping. Some colds are coronaviruses. There has never been a successful vaccine against a coronavirus, to date, although maybe soon? The best prevention is avoidance. Don't get the virus in you and you won't get sick from it.
1317138043447500806 2020-10-17 00:19:15 +0800 <htmcg> No ballot should be counted that was mailed after election day. That would be insane. Ballots that were mailed on election day might fairly be counted, but none after.
1317137535131332608 2020-10-17 00:17:14 +0800 <htmcg> Well, they've told the media to stop covering it, so I guess they *do* think nobody's watching.
1317136907143434240 2020-10-17 00:14:44 +0800 <htmcg> Here's a sci-fi twist. Perhaps he has a mutant power of visiting alternate realities. Everything he says that is completely crazy is just a memory he has from a different world. #NowItMakesSense
1316887539333124097 2020-10-16 07:43:50 +0800 <htmcg> Twitter was overloaded for a while. Not your fault. I hope you feel better soon.
1316887248458158081 2020-10-16 07:42:41 +0800 <htmcg> Couldn't Tweet. The error said Twitter is overloaded.  I wonder why?! 😂
1316854167533649921 2020-10-16 05:31:14 +0800 <htmcg> @jsolomonReports @beaglebabe48 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
1316836859457269760 2020-10-16 04:22:27 +0800 <htmcg> President Trump is re-elected.
1316779437594214401 2020-10-16 00:34:17 +0800 <htmcg> They can get away with it through *misdirection.* Biden didn't pressure them to fire the prosecutor investigating his son. He pressured them to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma (where his son was on the board) or they would not get aid.
1316735301428154369 2020-10-15 21:38:54 +0800 <htmcg> I am also greatly hoping that President Trump is re-elected. Whatever happens in the election, please remember that God is in control. Have faith and live your best life, regardless of the election results.
1316487190701133824 2020-10-15 05:13:00 +0800 <htmcg> This is interesting. Did Twitter censor stories about President Trump's tax returns that the NYT possibly hacked?
1316447881444962304 2020-10-15 02:36:48 +0800 <htmcg> What people don't know: a virus particle has to be carried by something, for instance, a droplet of saliva. It does not launch by itself. A mask is woven tightly enough to block *most* saliva droplets expelled when breathing and talking. So a mask helps protect others from you.
1316240480976470016 2020-10-14 12:52:39 +0800 <htmcg> Socialism is the equal distribution of misery.
1316114603869433857 2020-10-14 04:32:28 +0800 <htmcg> Good. I hope all copies of the book are recalled.
1316114271097454593 2020-10-14 04:31:09 +0800 <htmcg> I thought you were a little generous on that one. Just so she's confirmed without being tarred and feathered, I will be happy.
1316113867928461315 2020-10-14 04:29:32 +0800 <htmcg> And she's right. As much as they would like to, they can't corner a Justice into following their agenda. As ACB stated, the rule of law is her boss.  A law means what it means. If you don't like a law, write a better one in its place. Don't ask the SCOTUS to re-imagine it.
1316112805389631489 2020-10-14 04:25:19 +0800 <htmcg> It didn't use to. The first ACA website cost a lot more than that and it was often out of service. Find a website you like, and find out all about it. Who created it? Who maintains it? You pay designers for time and reputation. $50K may be high or low, depending on many things.
1316110977109233669 2020-10-14 04:18:03 +0800 <htmcg> It just shows that a Ph.D. conveys only prestige, not intelligence.
1316098337792233474 2020-10-14 03:27:50 +0800 <htmcg> @AuthorofAbsurd I did participate for a few months, two years ago. My follower count rose above 10K. Since then, I lose here a few, there a few. Every week I lose more than I gain. I have just over 9K now. I think much of the lost are Twitter suspendees.  What matters is the quality of threads.
1316094005537583106 2020-10-14 03:10:37 +0800 <htmcg> The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. A Constitutional amendment is as valid as the rest of the Constitution. That's why it's so hard to amend the Constitution. Justice Barrett will consider the original intent of the Constitution *with all its amendments.* Trust her.
1316061016459968513 2020-10-14 00:59:32 +0800 <htmcg> O.o
1316060496756432898 2020-10-14 00:57:28 +0800 <htmcg> That is bigotry. These 80-year-olds are too old, but many 90-year-olds are sharp. They just aren't found in Congress. Term limits will help drain the swamp.
1315801440187809794 2020-10-13 07:48:04 +0800 <htmcg> It's the Democrat way not to vote for any bill that isn't packed to bursting with progressive pocket-padding programs.
1315790080754233346 2020-10-13 07:02:56 +0800 <htmcg> Dems win or lose, investigations always turn up insufficient evidence to convict a Democrat but tons of evidence to convict a Republican. Democrats must be really good at covering their tracks.  Republicans must win 2020 anyway.
1315762242957213697 2020-10-13 05:12:19 +0800 <htmcg> They are celebrities, known for their entertainment value. Does it matter that either of them blocks you? Does their opinion matter for anything to you?
1315761297301135366 2020-10-13 05:08:33 +0800 <htmcg> Well, Ginsburg did not think much of the Constitution, so it would be very helpful to undo that legacy.   https://t.co/sDFgWegCU1
1315734459065479170 2020-10-13 03:21:54 +0800 <htmcg> Well, President Trump's personality is as much better than Biden's as his values. But, values are the important part of the election. #KAG2020
1315723290917376000 2020-10-13 02:37:32 +0800 <htmcg> My wife and I are very limited income, and Health Market allowed us major subsidies, so It works for us, so far. But without the subsidies, we couldn't do it.  Can we go back to private insurance, please?
1314812634164854785 2020-10-10 14:18:54 +0800 <htmcg> I have nothing to do with it except to point out that it is not a self-actuating process, in many states. There is a great gulf between should be and is.
1314670763832684545 2020-10-10 04:55:10 +0800 <htmcg> I'm glad to know this. Each state should have a mechanism to promulgate the knowledge of a citizen's death to all departments that deal with living people. Here is a report that tells what each state does for voter registration in case of death.   https://t.co/ynARxdi8w4
1314667517986713600 2020-10-10 04:42:16 +0800 <htmcg> Bureaucracy. You gotta love it, 'cause you can't get rid of it.
1314666891206635528 2020-10-10 04:39:46 +0800 <htmcg> Yes. They evidently wish for voter fraud to occur in spite of their derision every time it is mentioned.
1314666211972706304 2020-10-10 04:37:04 +0800 <htmcg> It's the system. A deceased person can't inform the bureau of elections of their death. So their name stays on the roll unless a living person informs them. Have you ever done that for a deceased person? Nor have I. It's ignorance, not fraud.  Mailing ballots makes it a problem.
1314610264726216710 2020-10-10 00:54:46 +0800 <htmcg> It should have been completed and release months ago.  I'm so sorry to learn that everything turns around getting Harris into the White House. Then all investigations will conclude without sufficient evidence to prosecute.  #KAG2020
1314570946230054914 2020-10-09 22:18:31 +0800 <htmcg> She has been irrational since taking power.
1314319858201493505 2020-10-09 05:40:47 +0800 <htmcg> If only the Democrats thought so. One way to ensure it is to get a Republican majority in the House. I hope for that.
1314269440079527936 2020-10-09 02:20:27 +0800 <htmcg> Is it a mathematics textbook?
1314253183473115141 2020-10-09 01:15:51 +0800 <htmcg> Only if she gets elected. Can we please not do that?!
1314213651004362755 2020-10-08 22:38:45 +0800 <htmcg> Thank him for his service. I am safer because of his work. I hope his world gets better for him. I hope he asks God for help.
1313669811608662022 2020-10-07 10:37:44 +0800 <htmcg> I wonder if there is a problem. I cannot see my followers. Hmm...
1313292513160110080 2020-10-06 09:38:29 +0800 <htmcg> Umm... he has worked every decade since Taxi, in movies and television, and as you surely know, this is the genius actor, Mr. Danny DeVito.
1313206722358542336 2020-10-06 03:57:35 +0800 <htmcg> I am glad he is optimistic. No treatment cures COVID-19 in three days. He may still have symptoms and be contagious for two weeks or more. I am happy he is well enough to leave the hospital.
1313165829542998020 2020-10-06 01:15:05 +0800 <htmcg> @BrandonStraka @ZephTheAnon I understand that your goal is to get the media to report your side fairly.  The media has never been fair. They pander. They present the story that will sell more ads, facts notwithstanding.
1312055002190487552 2020-10-02 23:41:03 +0800 <htmcg> Dismissing a libel lawsuit is so passé. Today justice moves forward.
1312054067993227264 2020-10-02 23:37:21 +0800 <htmcg> It has been clear for four years that some people are corrupted and consumed by hatred. Now they want attention and praise for their depravity. Pathetic.  God's will be done. If President Trump dies, God has a plan for our country — the same as if he lives.
1311772212240748544 2020-10-02 04:57:21 +0800 <htmcg> A hamster pogo stick or a spring whisk. Figure it out.
1311726326710140940 2020-10-02 01:55:01 +0800 <htmcg> Your vote could be the vote that gives President Trump a second term.  Vote at the polls, where you are registered, on Election Day.  #KAG2020TrumpVictory
1311433285021708290 2020-10-01 06:30:35 +0800 <htmcg> I wonder when he came up with the phrase "Stand back and stand by." I imagine that was pre-planned. Part of President Trump's strategy is to say outrageous things for their shock value but to do great things for their patriotic value.
1311316903391113221 2020-09-30 22:48:07 +0800 <htmcg> As President Trump has already publicly denounced white supremacism, why should he repeatedly be required to re-denounce it?  President Trump doesn't cooperate with being boxed into a corner on any topic.  His actions over the last three years and seven months are loud and clear.
1311186604304855040 2020-09-30 14:10:21 +0800 <htmcg> Started watching. Seeing two adults shouting over each other isn't our thing. Turned it off after a couple of minutes of that. I hope Trump won.
1310744770302668807 2020-09-29 08:54:40 +0800 <htmcg> That is soundly incorrect in every detail. Fortunately, the voters will not fall for such blather.
1310734084935737345 2020-09-29 08:12:12 +0800 <htmcg> The fewer the Democrats who participate in the process, the quicker we can get to the confirmation. #ItsAllGood #FillTheSeatNOW
1310733334792802304 2020-09-29 08:09:13 +0800 <htmcg> I suspect their defense will be that someone else disclosed it to them -- that is the crime -- and that once it was disclosed to a public source -- themselves -- it is no crime to publish it.  I hope that theory is tested in court, though.
1310732758709407744 2020-09-29 08:06:56 +0800 <htmcg> @ProudOhioNative The best dinner I've made in a crockpot is chuck roast. You have to cook it at least six hours and it falls apart.
1310652291435958273 2020-09-29 02:47:11 +0800 <htmcg> Who will give the debate questions to Biden campaign, tho?
1310620655369564160 2020-09-29 00:41:29 +0800 <htmcg> For what crime?
1309189386370719745 2020-09-25 01:54:07 +0800 <htmcg> Because he may have thought he was trying to kill home invaders. He called 911 and said someone kicked down the door and shot his girlfriend. He asked for help. The tape was used in court. He may not have know they were police.
1308933160911200257 2020-09-24 08:55:59 +0800 <htmcg> There is audio of his call. #KeepUp   https://t.co/vzS9ZKnH92
1308932711227289602 2020-09-24 08:54:11 +0800 <htmcg> I didn't listen today. I have read this account, which seems to be an even-handed treatment of the case.   https://t.co/zL12UvXcvm
1308870902407364608 2020-09-24 04:48:35 +0800 <htmcg> Charge him.
1308815292022304768 2020-09-24 01:07:36 +0800 <htmcg> To whom will it make a difference? No Trump-voting Republican expected an endorsement from Ms. McCain.   The only interest Democrats have in Ms. McCain is to use her against Republicans.
1308813069309693952 2020-09-24 00:58:46 +0800 <htmcg> Thank you, @SenTedCruz   While we're at it, historically, all partisan resolutions are Democrat and vice versa. Therefore, be it resolved that all resolutions sponsored by Democrats be blocked, without question, as a matter of course.
1308791280340733952 2020-09-23 23:32:12 +0800 <htmcg> Dr. Fauci says a Coronavirus vaccine may not be ready in time for the election. No kidding. There has never in history been an effective vaccine for *any* coronavirus. Why would this one coronavirus be susceptible to a vaccine when none others have been?
1308142056808816642 2020-09-22 04:32:25 +0800 <htmcg> I don't even think about muting. It's either follow, unfollow, or in some cases, block.
1308141287200247816 2020-09-22 04:29:21 +0800 <htmcg> Were the Emmys on?
1308140935302336515 2020-09-22 04:27:57 +0800 <htmcg> Why do you assume he is disappointed? The apple didn't fall far from the tree.
1308079496663367680 2020-09-22 00:23:49 +0800 <htmcg> Thank you. I hope she has calmed down. I'm glad I don't know what it is to suffer rage based on my gender.
1308078476449193990 2020-09-22 00:19:46 +0800 <htmcg> I'm glad you replied here. I am blocked from seeing the original tweet, so I looked at the account — a person whom I had never heard of, seen, or known — and I was blocked by her. So I was able to block her back. I would never have known, if not for your reply. A public service!
1308074275014934529 2020-09-22 00:03:04 +0800 <htmcg> I've only heard the first line of that poem. It's great. Poor Justice Ginsberg wanted to wait until 2025 to have a new justice installed? I'm afraid that would be too long. Bless her heart for trying, though.
1307343786272591872 2020-09-19 23:40:22 +0800 <htmcg> Times change. A four-to-four court is not helpful if the election is contested.
1307343099526610945 2020-09-19 23:37:38 +0800 <htmcg> Why is anything she says being reported now, almost four years after she became an asterisk in the history books?
1307097014887501824 2020-09-19 07:19:47 +0800 <htmcg> It is crucial that enough people vote GOP in person so that if every ballot sent in by mail were for Biden, Trump would still win by a large enough margin that the mailed-in ballots won't make up the difference. That's how urgent it is for every Republican to vote on November 3.
1307008635726442496 2020-09-19 01:28:36 +0800 <htmcg> Those two features, and the subsidies for us oldies. Those, of course, are anathema to the young and healthy, and I understand, but it's the same principle used in underwriting any group insurance plan — the healthy pay for the sick.
1306994589249818627 2020-09-19 00:32:47 +0800 <htmcg> Can we get there from here? An article I saw last week notes that even Republicans have stopped insisting on rescinding Obamacare because it is the status quo and the populace is not asking for it to be undone.
1306977195328442370 2020-09-18 23:23:40 +0800 <htmcg> @nedryun The main reason he deserves credit is that it is his administration that made it possible.
1306976074413363203 2020-09-18 23:19:13 +0800 <htmcg> The problem is, we are almost there. I lost employer-sponsored coverage due to retirement. I had to go to the Marketplace. Due to my age, coverage for me and my wife would have been over $2,700 monthly. Our income allowed us to receive subsidies. Taxpayer provided. Public aid.
1306952367770947591 2020-09-18 21:45:01 +0800 <htmcg> Cognitive decline is expected after a certain age but it is not useful in a presidential candidate. I hope he steps down and everyone admits Ms. Harris is the Democrat candidate. :-/
1306950090356076544 2020-09-18 21:35:58 +0800 <htmcg> When has our side rioted? Since the Boston Tea Party, I mean?
1306949823187292165 2020-09-18 21:34:54 +0800 <htmcg> She is an expert on lawlessness.
1306949508320952320 2020-09-18 21:33:39 +0800 <htmcg> I reject the assumption. The riots are being funded to sway the election left. After the election, what good are they? There is nothing left to sway.
1306786097700233217 2020-09-18 10:44:19 +0800 <htmcg> How would you recommend bringing together patriots and anarchists? Wouldn't that require somebody to change their minds? I don't see either side budging. That's not the fault of President Trump.
1306784013277896709 2020-09-18 10:36:02 +0800 <htmcg> Unexpectedly.
1306783675334434817 2020-09-18 10:34:41 +0800 <htmcg> You do you.
1306782825060892672 2020-09-18 10:31:19 +0800 <htmcg> I don't care about the details of his faith and I don't care what he thinks about the details of my faith. He is no religious authority to me.  I care that he is emptying the swamp and promoting peace on earth.
1306695930809323520 2020-09-18 04:46:01 +0800 <htmcg> An unfollow tracker has informed me that the majority of people who have unfollowed me are now following 0 people or are suspended. O.o  #MysteriesOfTwitter
1305997228054581248 2020-09-16 06:29:38 +0800 <htmcg> Would he have been detained if he had done it on the sidewalk in front of her home? That isn't prosecuted in San Francisco, I understand.
1305996610816610305 2020-09-16 06:27:10 +0800 <htmcg> I am sorry for your loss.
1305992668674170880 2020-09-16 06:11:31 +0800 <htmcg> @ProudOhioNative Talk to your employer. If they can't support you, you are not safe in that job anyway. Best wishes.
1305938277313081344 2020-09-16 02:35:23 +0800 <htmcg> He must be so pleased! How does one sign up for that treatment? I never want to hear her on TV again.
1305610658675863553 2020-09-15 04:53:32 +0800 <htmcg> From 1987. If true, I wonder why this was not filed earlier. If true, I hope the violated person can find peace and a good judgment is made.  https://t.co/bJKbNRIkPZ
1305567149747044354 2020-09-15 02:00:39 +0800 <htmcg> It may be company policy. The cash register keeps track of purchases. Doing it by hand does not.
1304894534476857348 2020-09-13 05:27:55 +0800 <htmcg> Very useful for opening difficult jar lids. It forms a lever.
1304485802492166144 2020-09-12 02:23:46 +0800 <htmcg> HaHa. Years ago, I was freelancing and full-time (burning the candle at both ends) and my energy was failing. I zoned out in a meeting led by the president of the company. My career there started going south after that. #BePresent
1304170332203421697 2020-09-11 05:30:12 +0800 <htmcg> Destruction of government records, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice are three charges I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm not a prosecutor. I hope the appropriate authority brings charges.
1304136236693704708 2020-09-11 03:14:43 +0800 <htmcg> I've lost over 10% of the followers I had at my peak over a year ago. That loss began when I stopped jumping on follow trains and also took a hiatus from Twitter. I would think the longer on Twitter, the more followers but clearly, that is not the case. #ByeWhatsYourHurry?
1304131580919779334 2020-09-11 02:56:13 +0800 <htmcg> I wanted to "correct" to lede... and then I saw this...   https://t.co/HoXBQlsZV9
1304129972962033666 2020-09-11 02:49:49 +0800 <htmcg> Probably. But if you only voted for one of the bills they pack with poison pill socialist agenda items, they would have to approve it. However, don't do that.
1303734290409230342 2020-09-10 00:37:31 +0800 <htmcg> People are finally thinking. I expect other states to follow.  Why do you want a dementia sufferer in the White House? Are you expecting Ms. Harris will be the president?
1303471569172418560 2020-09-09 07:13:34 +0800 <htmcg> He confuses even himself.
1303344105871810560 2020-09-08 22:47:04 +0800 <htmcg> That is awful.
1303336196781768706 2020-09-08 22:15:38 +0800 <htmcg> My 10-year-old grandson is intelligent but fearful of COVID-19. He is more comfortable doing school by computer than he would be in a classroom. Not that he likes school, in the first place, but he is doing his best. He was *never* very excited to go to school.
1302031485382406149 2020-09-05 07:51:11 +0800 <htmcg> I am very sorry to hear this happened to you. I hope they are done with that harassment.
1301601333405978637 2020-09-04 03:21:55 +0800 <htmcg> Yes. Downstate Illinois.
1301559550529744897 2020-09-04 00:35:53 +0800 <htmcg> It would not work. They have no way of knowing if your vote was received until they count it, which may occur after the polls close.
1301217046949179393 2020-09-03 01:54:54 +0800 <htmcg> If it bleeds, it ledes is always the motto of the media — unless it would also make President Trump look good, in which it is ignored.
1301197130833559559 2020-09-03 00:35:45 +0800 <htmcg> The first step is admitting you have a problem. I've heard.
1301192946855931910 2020-09-03 00:19:08 +0800 <htmcg> Don't get me started on Picadilly Circus.
1301192625408614400 2020-09-03 00:17:51 +0800 <htmcg> Then he would be expelled from the school. Because they want professors to discriminate.
1301192349322825728 2020-09-03 00:16:45 +0800 <htmcg> Sadly, I would not be surprised if the school administration was behind this protocol.
1301191209944256515 2020-09-03 00:12:14 +0800 <htmcg> Crying is not the problem. Powerlessness is the problem. Do you have to live in California? Move to a free state and commute when you have a project.
1301189714838462469 2020-09-03 00:06:17 +0800 <htmcg> There's no demand for it and it would raise the price of the product. Fold the top of the bag after you use it. Is your cereal really going stale?
1300846056524132352 2020-09-02 01:20:43 +0800 <htmcg> Many policies don't cover rioting or war damage. Good luck putting businesses up in place of these cinders and ashes.
