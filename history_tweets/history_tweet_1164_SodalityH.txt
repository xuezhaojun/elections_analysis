1320893084851408896 2020-10-27 09:00:27 +0800 <SodalityH> The formula of reception which Fr. Coster's Sodality Book gave ‚Äî the formula still in use to-day ‚Äî the pledge "never to say or do anything against Mary and never to permit others to do anything against her honour" a protest against the blasphemies of the heretics of the time.  https://t.co/zpLnEctpN3
1320891662365806593 2020-10-27 08:54:47 +0800 <SodalityH> Father Coster composed other works of piety or controversy for the Sodalities of Our Lady of Antwerp and of Arras.

1319367534404128773 2020-10-23 03:58:27 +0800 <SodalityH> In 1681, on the Feast of All Saints, the canonical erection of the Sodality of Fribourg took place. This Sodality was especially edifying in the loving and grateful devotion, one might say, which it practised towards its founder, St. Peter Canisius.  https://t.co/aEhB0UmFQK
1319366574671876102 2020-10-23 03:54:38 +0800 <SodalityH> In Germany, the Sodality was in very truth the bulwark of the Faith. To it Treves and W√ºrzburg owe their triumph. All Bavaria rallied to its standard; more than thirty thousand men gave their names and saved the faith of their country. Exterminatrix of heresies, pray for us!  https://t.co/t3KOLh6Fn8
