In your others category include the oh so honest Donna Brazile and Kememer Jaun Williams. Not sure though too much damage done!

1325996349041434624 2020-11-10 10:59:00 +0800 <deplrablepeach> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs their goal! They want to dishearten us to the point we won‚Äôt vote! Always vote even if we know they will cheat. Make them resort to Evil! Then it‚Äôs on their hands. #FightBackForAmerica

1325988832957837314 2020-11-10 10:29:08 +0800 <deplrablepeach> @valshower @DailyCaller It‚Äôs called censorship! We have brains. We can discern. We can actually come up with intelligent questions unlike the WH press corps! And there was no vetting of Biden Harris by the arrogant media!
1325979239578013700 2020-11-10 09:51:00 +0800 <deplrablepeach> @seanmdav @dianamee Exactly! When they talk about compromise they mean they want us to come over to their side!

1325638019668389890 2020-11-09 11:15:07 +0800 <deplrablepeach> @BreitbartNews First of all Biden is Not the President elect. The media doesn‚Äôt pick the President. The election is corrupt and is being contested. And second this is another reason to #HatetheNats  #FightBackAmerica

1325193671734595585 2020-11-08 05:49:26 +0800 <deplrablepeach> @MittRomney First of all Joe Biden is NOT a man of good character and Jill knows it because they‚Äôve been cashing in on selling out America. But Mitt I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs okay with you because your character is not what I thought it was. I‚Äôm ashamed I ever voted for you!
