1321296401305866240 2020-10-28 11:43:05 +0800 <catsme0ww> @pnut your feeling on Chad being a Trump backer? With all that has happened with James and so much more - to know he is donating? Sorry to interrupt the game. Just got an election in a couple days.

1321279712635879424 2020-10-28 10:36:46 +0800 <catsme0ww> ..and most blissful times, because they were, and there I was happy. Not even the fact that my money could have gone towards my son‚Äôs education, love for the outdoors and travel, but instead you put money over being genuine and now my money some how ended up in Trump‚Äôs pocket.
1321279711532777475 2020-10-28 10:36:46 +0800 <catsme0ww> Oh and the money that you donated was from an extremely loyal and devoted fanbase and I gotta say it hurts bad and I feel guilty and foolish right now for the small fortune I‚Äôve spent seeing you decade after decade‚Äînot for the reason that are some of the those being the best
1321279710282862592 2020-10-28 10:36:45 +0800 <catsme0ww> well allllll those things are in this one person! The total embodiment! But he  really isn‚Äôt THAT bad now is he?‚Äù It for real feels like a kind of mind **** ... seems uncertain?! Oh VERY uncertain
1321279708999331840 2020-10-28 10:36:45 +0800 <catsme0ww> Actually I‚Äôm not sure really and sadly am more numb because many I held dear or in high regard have shown to be okay with the bottom feeders. Like, ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs I described the boogie man, well worse actually, alllll the things and I told you were bad and evil
1321279707619483649 2020-10-28 10:36:45 +0800 <catsme0ww> not just as artist but as humans... you guys chose to call us family... that‚Äôs how it lasted so long, we feel we have bonds with you but reality it is how well do we even know you? We don‚Äôt. At least I don‚Äôt ... üíî
1321279704565981185 2020-10-28 10:36:44 +0800 <catsme0ww> Chad Sexton, I still respect your amazing musical talent, wish you wellness and happiness, and am forever grateful for your part in what has been an the amazing phenomenon of what is @311 but you‚Äôve really not been real with the fans who have supported you...
1321272768072192002 2020-10-28 10:09:10 +0800 <catsme0ww> @NYGovCuomo THIS. Thank you and please! He still mocks this horrible virus that was devastating to frontline workers who lack the ability and time to access good healthcare. As a single mom, with a chronic illness, who happens to be a frontline worker for a medical dispensary - Please vote!
1321270994649128960 2020-10-28 10:02:07 +0800 <catsme0ww> Vote. Vote. Vote.

1321267841568563200 2020-10-28 09:49:36 +0800 <catsme0ww> @ParkerEmory @pnut Parker, I just found out and yeah, my heart dropped. I‚Äôm confused more than anything. Everything that ‚Äúis‚Äù 311 is not what that man stands for and the vile things he has done - sorry, but check your privilege Chad. We are hurting and DYING out here üíî
