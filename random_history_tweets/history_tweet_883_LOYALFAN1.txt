1320781292523454464 2020-10-27 01:36:13 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Yes, Just take a look at what's happening. The numbers are rising. More people are losing their lives. Who is lying here? This is extremely dangerous as people let their guard down. We have holidays coming soon and need to be extremely careful. Listen to the medical experts. 😷😷
1320779669969489921 2020-10-27 01:29:46 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Happy you have had a great life &amp; beat Covid. The families that lost loved ones are not happy. The people in the hospitals are not happy. Those who lost jobs, healthcare, homes, cars, trucks too. When you take the ACA away many may die &amp; live without medication or care &amp; hunger.
1320777409864617989 2020-10-27 01:20:48 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Why hate has divided our country. We need to heal from 4 years of name calling &amp; degrading great people. Heartbreaking to see such mean statements. Never has a President spread hate like this at events. We are better then this! Talk about Covid-19. Stimulus pkg. Please vote 4 Joe
1320774391106576384 2020-10-27 01:08:48 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Unbelievable. Desperation at its worse. What an example for the children of our country. Name calling, bullying. Vice President Biden wants to save our country. Lives before money. He won't take away your medical insurance or the Stimulus package. He will not delay a vaccine. SAD

1320738162034049027 2020-10-26 22:44:50 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> We need kindness and inspiration. South Carolina is a beautiful state. Sen. Lindsey Graham has changed his mind on several issues. We need honesty. Jaime Harrison will bring hope and change. Hate just doesn't work. Carpe Diem. Inspiration!!!
1320736361352204289 2020-10-26 22:37:41 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Happy New Week #JoyTrain. Thank you for spreading hope , joy, love and inspiration. Priceless gifts. ⭐️
1320735608323645442 2020-10-26 22:34:41 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Have a wonderful new week dear friend. Stay well.😷I want to thank you for sharing such important information.
1320732447357706241 2020-10-26 22:22:08 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Thank you Jim Kolbe. I miss John McCain. He was a true Hero who loved serving this country. Carpe Diem. Stay well.
1320725261600645120 2020-10-26 21:53:34 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Please listen to our greatest experts. This has been their life's work on the world's behalf. Pass this along. Hopefully we will have a safe vaccine soon.
1320724399486586886 2020-10-26 21:50:09 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Friends, please share and stay safe. There will be other Thanksgivings. Send a loved one a fruit basket, pie or one of their favorite treats. You can always have it dropped off at their home. We all want to spend the holidays together but not at the cost of a life Gift cards work
1320722424665657345 2020-10-26 21:42:18 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Thank you for providing us all with honesty. With true facts we can much better prepare. We have been mislead and the lives lost are never coming back. I hope everyone orders your book and listens to your expert advice. You are so appreciated Prof Peter Hotez MD Phd. Namaste'.
1320719169411756033 2020-10-26 21:29:22 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Thank you Senator Murphy. Every life lost leaves behind broken hearted loved ones. They were great people from all walks of life. Dealing with the truth from our best experts was better then pretending the pandemic would just vanish. We need a mask mandate. 😷&amp; the Stimulus pkg.
1320716340089495552 2020-10-26 21:18:07 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> This pandemic was hidden from the people &amp; still is. Heartbreaking that the cases are rising daily. Hospitals are filling up. Medical personal are exhausted. Does anyone believe we have rounded the curve? Covid is just vanishing without a vaccine or masks Please listen to Science
1320714436223619073 2020-10-26 21:10:33 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> This could possible spread more cases. More lives lost.
1320714012842168320 2020-10-26 21:08:52 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Of course! Biden will put the best and most brilliant team in the White House. We need leaders not people who cover up a deadly virus when there is no known vaccine.
1320713299558846468 2020-10-26 21:06:02 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> People need the Stimulus package passed. Rents are due, food in short supply. Medication, food, rent or a pumpkin? Hard to just expect folks who worked all their lives to decide what will be on their Thanksgiving table this year. Please try to do better. How very sad.💔🎃💔🎃💔
1320710781462302720 2020-10-26 20:56:02 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Thank you Senator Murphy for your outstanding dedication. You are appreciated more then you know. I cannot imagine how fearful &amp; concerned those who may lose their healthcare feel right now. Lost jobs, rent &amp; mortgage payments. Food, medication, &amp; Covid cases rising. Rest up. TY

1319887328484204544 2020-10-24 14:23:56 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> I understand your point &amp; know there are some bad folks. What if we continue to judge people by the color of their skin, religion, race &amp; how great they look? I have friends that are extremely brilliant &amp; many disabled &amp; have the same I.Q. There are homeless people were once fine
1319883482907238401 2020-10-24 14:08:39 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Great always to hear from you my friend. I get tons of feedback on this subject. Kids will feel this is normal. My work has seen many children die from suicide &amp; overdosing from bullying. Beautiful loving children. Hateful names are lasting &amp; painful. Teachers &amp; parents are sad💔
1319880854072680448 2020-10-24 13:58:12 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Hate has no place in a world suffering from loss of lives, jobs, homes fighting a pandemic with no present cure. Our country needs a leader not a bully. What must the children think? We teach them not to call people names. Be kind especially since folks &amp; children are hurting now

1319870234577207296 2020-10-24 13:16:00 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> That comment was so horrible. He has no idea of their I.Q. They were loving parents hoping to find a better life. Among them I am sure were very talented &amp; exceptional people with fine skills. We need to stop assuming that only the rich have the most brilliant minds. Thank you💔
1319867904351965184 2020-10-24 13:06:45 +0800 <LOYALFAN1> Heartbreaking. 💔 Hopefully together we can help these innocent and precious children. A picture is worth a thousand words. Thank you!
