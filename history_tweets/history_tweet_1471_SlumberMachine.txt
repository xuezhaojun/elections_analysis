You will awaken soon, we will be here for you when you do.

Still truth even if the meme is poor.

The guy exposed himself as being some gatekeeper awhile ago. His opinion is worthless now.  You might as well quote Alex Jones or Jerome Corsi too, they are also gatekeepers.

1341475600419016704 2020-12-23 04:08:01 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @TobinWarner1 @McdunkinSmash @DackStevon There are hundreds of proofs showing it’s 100% connected to Trump.
1341472433203625984 2020-12-23 03:55:26 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @AwakeSaxon @DackStevon Self defeating? Did you see what happened in Oregon yesterday? Have you seen the people rising up?  We have more people aware of the truth now than ever before.
1341471476755546113 2020-12-23 03:51:38 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @TobinWarner1 @McdunkinSmash @DackStevon The pinnacle of stupidity is for the first time in history having the executive branch communicate directly with the people and you don’t even read it.
1341469504266674176 2020-12-23 03:43:47 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @DackStevon Devon, ask yourself this. Even if it’s a psyop to placate, don’t you think exposing people to the learned elders(censored), bill cooper, mossad/cia tactics, and real history is worth it? But this is all new to you, cause you never really investigated it, did you?
1341467356933939201 2020-12-23 03:35:15 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @TobinWarner1 @McdunkinSmash @DackStevon I agree, voting wont do shit, I’ve said the elections have been fraud for decades and nobody listened to me. Also I never said anything about Barr, you should not make assumptions.
1341466479649165312 2020-12-23 03:31:46 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @DackStevon Nah, I think things will get crazy by Jan 6-20th, just hedging my bet a little by giving a couple extra months.

You took the black pill and stayed there, not continuing to learn and grow in your understanding of reality.  You guys remind me of myself five years ago, wanting to run away and hide instead of stay and fight.
1341455372507201537 2020-12-23 02:47:38 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @McdunkinSmash @DackStevon I fully understand why you would think that, but those that actually study what is going on will be right. I will expect you to admit being wrong also.
1341435719353430017 2020-12-23 01:29:32 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @DackStevon I will fully admit my error if nothing Q related happens by 3/31/21. I expect the same from you.

1302735482078392320 2020-09-07 06:28:37 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @ClintMichael11 I can understand wearing a mask in a private business that requires it (although misguided and I’m against it, they can run their store how they want), but people that wear masks outside or in their car are insane.
1302462786253930497 2020-09-06 12:25:01 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @stillgray They’re getting paid, just stay away and let them collect their money, they’ll be gone when the money stops flowing.

1302268137094569984 2020-09-05 23:31:33 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @BeComfy More media garbage.  It didn’t come from the Trump admin, but rather DHS, and as we’ve seen over the last few years, there are plenty of traitors and marxists left in different gov agencies (fbi comes to mind).  Never believe what the media says without your own research.
1302235747529887744 2020-09-05 21:22:51 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @realDonaldTrump Thank you president Trump.  The only systemic racism in America is affirmative action and critical race theory.

The only reason the post office is broke is due to congress insane bill that required them to fund pensions far in advance. This was a planned attack on the president and post office.

1300590481743650816 2020-09-01 08:25:09 +0800 <SlumberMachine> @igorbobic So glad to have a president that isn’t blinded by hate, like you.
