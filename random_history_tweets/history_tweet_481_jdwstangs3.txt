1328769499689054210 2020-11-18 02:38:30 +0800 <jdwstangs3> Except he is NOT the President Elect. Congress has officially stated this fact.
1328768379990192137 2020-11-18 02:34:03 +0800 <jdwstangs3> Congress has officially said there is no President Elect and I think it unwise to congratulate a fraud. The evidence is overwhelming against Joe and the Democrats.

1328164650198986752 2020-11-16 10:35:03 +0800 <jdwstangs3> Trump will be President 4 more years but you want Biden to take it fast enough to prevent all the FRAUD from being exposed. Joe lost.

Virus is real concern and 1 death is too many but there is a lot going on and Trump has been relentlessly attacked/not given credit when due.

I keep repeating that and its a fact. Also, most of deaths were result of Democrat Governor policies such as requiring nursing homes to take positive patients
