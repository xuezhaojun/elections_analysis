When someone says every expert I instantly call BS because anyone in stem knows there is always that 10% who are standouts

1329191299552055299 2020-11-19 06:34:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @br0wn3y3sss @Mellie_S1 @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot And you tax cucks will pay for my healthcare and wellfare and lawyers if I get caught since that's what biden campigned on. If you want to pay for that then who am I to complain. Not me and not the millions who will pour in illegally to get free stuff and pay zero taxes
1329190925193654274 2020-11-19 06:33:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @br0wn3y3sss @Mellie_S1 @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot You realise that's not free right? You realise you get taxed out the ass and because there's no competition that they just make it insanely expensive right? How the ACA took $65 deductables and made them $780.   Not that I can complain. I'll go illegal and work under the table...
1329190219610992642 2020-11-19 06:30:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot The atlantic, the news with the Anonymous source that said trump called shoulders looser and asked why we didn't back the Nazis that was then refuted by 22 eye witnesses who were confirmed there that day.   Great source I'm sure.
1329189747458236419 2020-11-19 06:28:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot And? Does it make the found votes less real? Go to the GA elections Twitter where they tweeted about it then baby genius

GA not even releasing any numbers till the whole thing is finished so CNN literally doesn't have a damn clue.  https://t.co/vhWZlHOo6F
1329188448524234752 2020-11-19 06:23:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot It's called google. Crowder and Tim pool both made videos on this. Likely it was covered on newsmax or OAN. Fox is cucked and useless but otherwise you can scan my TL. I retweeted most of it.
1329187740437581825 2020-11-19 06:20:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot Um it has they've found 3 sets of votes on flash drives that were primarily for trump uncounted and 2 bookings errors that's given trump a few thousand more votes more than the uncounted. So far the GA audits going very well.
1329187352330313728 2020-11-19 06:18:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @lumitrac @RudyGiuliani Nah fam just honest mistakes that always swing one way. Not a concerted effort to rig an election, at all. Just innocent whoopsies 5 times in 1 state amounting to almost 10k votes uncounted RN. That's unpresidented.
1329186776708214784 2020-11-19 06:16:37 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot The videos not only are here on the web, they're on this very app idiot. You can attempt to kick up a fuss and tell me reality isn't what I saw with my own 2 eyes and heard with my own 2 ears but I'm afraid I have too much grey matter for that.
1329186362717769734 2020-11-19 06:14:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot Nope. Most of the bad press he has gotten has been selectively edited to remove context. From his comment about rapist mexicans to nazis being fine people. All lies, proven con job editing.
1329185265966059523 2020-11-19 06:10:37 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @thyri @Project_Veritas In many countries where turn out is mandatory the best turn out they get is like 95% but in a lot of these states the turn out is even higher. The reason you never usually get over 95% is because of dead people still on the roles. Also shows why so many zombies voted.

Trump didn't lie.
1329182963746136064 2020-11-19 06:01:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mellie_S1 @br0wn3y3sss @dontfaulkup28 @robcharmm @RedEaglePatriot He's lied about more than he's ever lied. 😌

Maybe escape the fake news once in awhile and you'll get the truth.

1328904630672240641 2020-11-18 11:35:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @LordCybot Why after certify then audit? Will the audit change the certification? I don't get it?

1328903230475149313 2020-11-18 11:29:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I'm confused. What I read was they would certify after a comprehensive audit earlier....
1328902756418117632 2020-11-18 11:28:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Ok so there is an audit which is basically a recount to see what happened? I have no idea. I know the counting process, not the after process
1328901179921883139 2020-11-18 11:21:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @JackPosobiec The worst part is criminally few people realize this guareentees a civil war. When elections can't be trusted then there is only 1 thing people can and will do.
1328899867448647680 2020-11-18 11:16:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Bro CNN is about to go bankrupt since AT&amp;T wants to sell you. Might want to get in the unemployment line fredo

I'm waiting to see where the spinning coin falls. You saw a heads in the spin and assume you've won. My stance is the correct one.
1328812259951472641 2020-11-18 05:28:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @CallMeSirGodamt Yes I am callous and arrogant because I deal with idiots all day who dislike trump and either can't explain why OR when shown they're wrong on what they believe can't admit they're being lied to and accept it.

In NV they're throwing out 156k votes due to irregularies  In GA 3k votes found on "forgotten" flash drive  NH found 7k votes were incorrectly counted.  More daily coming out

A drawing of bill in hillarys dress, and a ton of other things. Biden hung with him and flew to his island. Trump, when he found Epstein's BS, banned him from all his retreats.

The local gov of portland had an antifa running as mayor and almost won. Should tell ya how those weird people think.

1327995347742945287 2020-11-15 23:22:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 Also not that trump is suppressed somehow. In Portland he definitely was. It was and is outside of the presidents power sadly. In general tho they lie about him all the time.
1327995085758361600 2020-11-15 23:21:16 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 The portland thing has nothing to do with trump. The only thing trump can do is send in national guard when requested which they refused (till biden "won") .   My conclusions aren't based off left being bad. A lot of the people I listen to are ex-left wing.
1327994004294803460 2020-11-15 23:16:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 #PortlandRiots there a whole hashtag of evidence
1327993823906193411 2020-11-15 23:16:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 Yeah they refusing the charge them and letting police and people get attacked. It's disgusting. "Right wing" proud boys got arrested for starting a riot for defending themselves. Guess whose charges stuck?
1327993393272811528 2020-11-15 23:14:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 "claim"...? I didn't get that from trump my guy, I literally watched antifa attack and hurt people on video by @MrAndyNgo reporting and reposting. They tried to burn the mayor alive and no one even got arrested.

They still say he hasn't said a thing about white supremacists tho he has 62 times now. His supporters are called white supremacists like proud boys specifically which is ran by a black dude, and even more
1327981037142544385 2020-11-15 22:25:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 This isn't left or right either. Obama governed just like bush. They both made wars, obama expanded the patriot act, he expanded detentions to citizens. The Dems and reps till Trump were 2 parties playing a theatre and trump was the glitch. Since then he's been fighting both side
1327979285467041794 2020-11-15 22:18:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> See? No orange. Nothing happened. Just "peaceful protests". No extremism by the far left commies in Portland. Don't believe your eyes. They don't track left wing extremism but the most extreme cases that they can't ignore.  https://t.co/46Nb3M6vhI
1327978260907651077 2020-11-15 22:14:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 They don't tabulate all left wing violence. If you check the heat map for far left violence in 2020 for example portland and kenosha are completely empty when there have been nearly a year of terrorism. They group things into right wing extremism that's not even right wing.
1327975729775202306 2020-11-15 22:04:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 The news are liars and democrat operatives. I don't trust a thing they say. You should notice ingsoc when you see it.

1327972029232947201 2020-11-15 21:49:38 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Because no one measures the far lefts violence. Name 5 far right attacks this year. I could name 5 far left in 1 night in a portland riot.

1327806739509460993 2020-11-15 10:52:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @kaitlin_des @cousinitNJ @_Andreas_Hudson Try using wikipedia as a source in any academic writing and see what happens. They're liers and hacks, period. I heard them from their own mouths that they're anarchists and wore red and black which is AnCom
1327805410158415872 2020-11-15 10:47:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lol I've had covid and go has 70 year old trump. It's not all that bad. Have we heard about massive death spikes from Biden's mega spreader idiot bregade weeping at his stolen election? No. Deaths are stagnant.  https://t.co/nsJn73Jdy5
1327803301253902338 2020-11-15 10:39:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @kaitlin_des @cousinitNJ @_Andreas_Hudson Yeah I'll take new news from the guys on the ground like andy who literally interviewed them and they flatly said they were AnCOM, which is leftist, over the same people who claim the proud boys, a group led by a black man, are a white supremacists group.
1327801778297946114 2020-11-15 10:33:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Idk you guys get mad at the sight of a knee. Are you all crybabies? We know the answer. Go back to defending pedos.  https://t.co/G5zM0HJ9o3
1327800774198390784 2020-11-15 10:29:08 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @spookysee They're antiamerican commie scum. They burn the flag, rip down the statues, and assualt our citizens. What part of that even remotely comes into contact with your drool monkey statement
1327800239500054528 2020-11-15 10:27:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Nah because they killed commies as well which antifa are. Surprise! Capitalist countries hate socialized economic governments!
1327799672799260672 2020-11-15 10:24:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Ceo4zpromotions That's literally every communist regime as well my dood. Ofc hitler and stalin were both far left so...
1327799325703905282 2020-11-15 10:23:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Um ur scales a little wonky there. The left has run a car through a crowd of police and shot 5 people killing 4. Also James Fields was shot at and panicked like anyone would and hit the gas, it wasn't intentional. The left with the cops tho, totally intentional.
1327798733749141504 2020-11-15 10:21:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VaughnKindaFish @_Andreas_Hudson Ancoms are total statist pieces of shit. They're double sided dildoing themselves at the idea of a biden win and tons of new censorship laws and more gibs.
1327798243858628608 2020-11-15 10:19:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @kaitlin_des @cousinitNJ @_Andreas_Hudson Boogaloo is not far right. They're anachists. Mostly AnCOM. They came out to support and looted with BLM. Your fact check is BS. Go watch the videos. Stop trying to get your data from corrupt shitholes.
1327797809156743168 2020-11-15 10:17:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @HPokelover @_Andreas_Hudson Kidnapping violates the NAP. That flag was black and red, that's AnCOM

1327787884712140800 2020-11-15 09:37:55 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Maybe it's just me but I think the army getting the server story glows. FBI is an enemy of the people and wants to subvert us into going full conspiritard. Just my opinion.

Technically no. The way dev works you have to make it multistagal so it will have to hit stage 1 and go into a lot of trials and stuff which takes months then back to stage 2, repeat, stage 3, repeat, stage 4, release. The bonds cutting made it 5 years to 1

Boards from different areas contribute the to overall acceptance of a drug fit for distribution. OWS was a multinational effort to that effect.
1327616401029345288 2020-11-14 22:16:30 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @realDonaldTrump It's literal treason. Make their heads roll. We will fight for you!

Said he got it year(s) ahead of time.  Even laid it out in more detail in another post stating he cut up the red tape that slows the companies down. If not mistaken that was the goal.

Also some did some don't: welcome to being the president. The president isn't a king, he's the commander and chief of the armed forces. The states all have the absolute power to adhire to or ignore federal advice. The most he can legally do is make guidelines

I know the team cut a LOT of the beauricratic red tape that holds back companies from doing things quickly like this which involves no money but the distribution and stuff does involve US money. I imagine there is a pay if it works.

Everyone lock down. 15 days to flatten the curve, then a 4-6 phase reopening checklist. He did ask the mayor's and govs to follow the science. Como called him a fear monger and then stuffed sick people into nursing homes

Dood miss me with that. They were violent communist rioters who literally murdered several people. The president can set out a guideline for states to follow for safety but he can NOT force the states, same as he couldn't force them to stop antifa  https://t.co/99efqykuYT

The whole "white supremeist" thing is and has been an out and out lie and doctored clips.

Don't involve the gov. Don't even consider giving them power to force the bosses to pay more. If you want more then negotiate and get it or walk out. It should be a free contract between citizens.

Half the people falsely arrested by the steele BS are still in prison even tho they did nothing. Their life's are ruined. He didn't deny funds to states he didn't like, he was denying funds to states allowing BLM and antifa to run around burning and killing freely

Breaks 2nd and I think 12th? Amendments. He likely could have done some weird power grab somewhere and forced everyone but he doesn't want power. He's just wanting to make america better.

If you want it then threaten to quit and use leverage and complain. Don't ask gov to do it by force for you. When has giving them power ever resulted in something good?

He has no power over the states. The same way he couldn't send feds after antifa. The best he can do is ask the gov and mayor... And he got a vaccine years ahead of time. Guess that doesn't count when you have TDS and a blinding hate for no reason

1327415971838107649 2020-11-14 09:00:04 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I can name policies and practices. No new wars, limited engagement. USMCA, tax cuts, border security, pulling troops from the ME, project warpspeed so we have a vaccine, new money to nasa to go to mars! 7 peace deals with ME countries and Israel, America first production policy+

No! It's the government not taking money. Idk about you but I've never gotten a tax benefit like healthcare or wellfare. Why do I care a business keeps more of its own money? I don't want the gov taking my money either.

Who pays you? A rich guy or your nabor? The rich guy usually. Wealth flows downward as it only can. A rich man starts at nothing and risks a lot money and stuff on building a business and when he makes it he hires people who can help. They make the business more

You get it under control by getting sick. That's how the vaccines work as well. U get enough virus that the body learns how to fight it. I don't understand how you expect to get it "under control"

If the death toll is steady or declining but the cases are getting higher miss "I am microbiology 4 reels" you'd know that likely means a mutation that's crippled the virus and made it far more harmless or was nvr a big deal

1327110562237599750 2020-11-13 12:46:29 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> So a @nytimes writer can encourage Dems to commit felony voter fraud in the #Georgia #runoffelections and post pics of heads on pikes but Bannon gets kicked because he said rhetorically people should have heads on pikes... Ok...
1327110044652085260 2020-11-13 12:44:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @jimwilbur @Rasmussen_Poll @RSBNetwork @FoxNews I'd say 4 major "glitches" by dominion which is chaired and ran by 95% democrat lobbyist and donors which flipped republican votes to Dems is pretty concrete along with the videos and pics of PA and WI watchers being ejected
1327109447605424128 2020-11-13 12:42:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Rasmussen_Poll @FoxNews Ras: the media has polls that say only 13% of the population thinks the vote was rigged. You've been historically more accurate, with @trafalgar_group; care to work your magic and get the real %?

Facts that everyone says are lies when they aren't. The media still says trump says nazis where fine people when there is video evidence that's a lie
1327095796995682304 2020-11-13 11:47:48 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MatthewClouti19 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump But people are believi ng trump is the devil because the same people (news) who said iraq was good and anyone who said they had nothing to do with it should be censored, said you couldn't read wikileaks or you would be arrested (untrue), and of course 4 years of slander to trump
1327095258530844674 2020-11-13 11:45:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MatthewClouti19 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump And biden is seen as the good guy even tho he and obama started 2 new wars, bombed villages, droned press who were unarmed, sent money to terrorists to promise not to build weapons(they did), issued the indefinite detention provision, re-instated the patriot act, etc
1327094730304479233 2020-11-13 11:43:34 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MatthewClouti19 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump And so he never wants to abuse that power, he never went back to war: to did some controlled bombing but no troop engagement, even now he's withdrawing the troops, and in covid he is blamed for failing but only because he didn't abuse his power to overturn the states rights
1327094262014603264 2020-11-13 11:41:42 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MatthewClouti19 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Of course we can. Explain this then: Trump is called a fascistic dictator. He has never overstepped his power to harm a citizen, he wanted antifa arrested; he could have issued the insurection act yet he didn't, he wants states to open up but the lock downs are effective pop ctrl

When you count those sick with covid usually they report the "recovery rate" which is like 95% I believe? Across all ages.   As an example say you have a virus that was 100% fatal but 99% were immune to it then the recovery rate is 0%

If 150k votes showed up for trump 100% at 3am and they kicked out dem watchers and boarded up the windows you'd be screeching to the heavens and you know it
1327066577376784385 2020-11-13 09:51:42 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Trump tried to with several law suits but they basically told him no so now he has to sue after the fact. The judges in these dem states are corrupt AF.
1327066148639223809 2020-11-13 09:50:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @eican @RepMattGaetz The death total is kind of stagnant. Instead of following the little red dot, start looking for the laser pointer.

Illegal.

Dominion has now been found in 5 areas to have swing massive amounts of votes to biden. This "glitch" has caused a lot of chaos.

If the news is so democratic theb why're they touting biden as president elect? They don't get to choose. The things trump is doing, including not concedeing arent against the rules. They're part of the process. My thought is they want you to think it was

The heads support Biden. The CNNs and MSNBCs still support the standpoint trump said nazis were fine people and mexicans were rapists and stuff when it's probably false....

1326389507713884160 2020-11-11 13:01:16 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @EuropeLaughing @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Also there have been no election results. 1 news agency called it for biden. There is a canvasing and certification phase as well as a recount phase before those 2. None of those have happened. RCP still has no candidate at 270. Several haven't even finished counting like AZ.
1326388889792241664 2020-11-11 12:58:49 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @GhostPants8 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Team maga is alive and well. We been having victory parties. It's been fun. Just went to a rally the other day.
1326388674024632321 2020-11-11 12:57:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> He just filled the suits yesterday. That takes time. Also memos? He's presenting evidence to the courts and there is ample evidence.

Dude you just have a few hundred people filling out just the president (as we saw in several States at 27% of all ballots which it's usually 3%) and then load them into USPS boxes and drive them into the building. The watchers were kicked out so no one could see

1326383472181645318 2020-11-11 12:37:17 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> You don't vote out fascists dummy. I lived in the east, we know what that looks like. My president is amazing and nothing you say will change that. Middle eastern peace, no wars, economic growth and growth in family income for the lowest classes.

Half of them say it's ok to kick out vote watchers without knowing what they are and what they do and have no interest in learning why kicking them out is massively corrupt and bad.

I personally think this was rigged to hell, would take a full audit to convince me otherwise but Dems are blocking it and that looks sus AF. To a biden supporter they see it as legit and hand wave away

Spent 4 years calling this one rigged.   For someone without facts biden is losing a lot of votes lately. He just lost PA and GA last night from RCP.  https://t.co/dGWxK81EN5

Funny how the party of ACAB, BLM, "judges falsely imprison millions of innocent people" suddenly think judges are God's and don't have bias.

I encourage this. If it turns around your salt will be glorious. RCP recalled PA and GA. Biden is losing votes like crazy as more "glitches" get discovered. Fully those "glitches" only shift votes one way.

1326374190648266752 2020-11-11 12:00:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> ...there were MASSIVE amount of ballots that ONLY entered in the president, hundreds of thousands so far. That happens naturally but only 3% as the high bar. This was more like 27%
1326374189150990341 2020-11-11 12:00:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> ... more than they expected. Like in PA it was a 900k lead with 16% left to report. If you have to hand fill out literally hundreds of thousands of ballots (would take a group effort) it saves you a LOT of time just to enter in the president column which is what we see...
1326372399445659648 2020-11-11 11:53:17 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @brigadoonblunt @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump I'd out do you any day of the week on half sleep with a hangover.

I'm against fracking! No I'll keep it!   Trump is a great president who kept his promises and helped us grow as a nation and kept his focus on the citizen and not the rich.

The "real news" was literally having people crying and calling biden president elect, he's not even president elect. Only 1 news agency has called it for biden, AP. RCP still has it uncalled because we have recounts all over.

Lots of people think it was 100% legit.

All they needed to do then was "find" enough ballots over the days AFTER the 3rd when they knew what trump's lead was to surpass it

He was 900k behind with 16% remaining at that time.

1325944541090897923 2020-11-10 07:33:08 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @BionicFonzie Biden is getting his advice in the middle east from Dick Chaney... He already said he has plans to re-enter the middle east and syria.   Trump has 7 peace deals and zero wars. Also lies... Let's not go on that I'd be here all day naming joe's lies.
1325944067126071298 2020-11-10 07:31:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @BionicFonzie Meanwhile biden personally lead the senate in ripping apart Supreme justice Clarence Thomas calling him a "rape ape", didn't want segregation to end because he didn't want his kids in a "racial jungle", and refered to black teens as predators.   Trump never did that.  https://t.co/ctFn3iyMhB

You know biden is already planning to re-enter the middle east and syria and start new wars right? Hope you're not a boy because the US has a draft. Ofc with the TPP signed and lockdowns coming with a tax hike I see lots of companies offshoring now so...

1325880886383013890 2020-11-10 03:20:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @HopsCausingThis Ofc ur likely brainwashed by the news and you think a lot of things are true that aren't even remotely true... Sadly lots of people coming to the realization too late
1325880692866228231 2020-11-10 03:19:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @HopsCausingThis Why? You a fan of 30 year wars and basically giving china you businesses because masks off and bidens already put that out that that's his plan.  Trump was a president who kept us out of war, brought our jobs home, and made sure we didn't get used.

Ask NYC gov who pushed covid patience into nursing homes when they had plenty of hospital rooms or Palosi who told people to go party in China Town when trump was warning about covid.

That's not the continent. Your conpairing the entire US to a city/region of australia. Not the same. Idk what the nation's dead toll is. Not my main issue.

We had politicians who loaded covid patients into nursing homes full of old people when the hospitals weren't even remotely at capacity. Stupid sh*t like that caused the spikes. This was a anti trump, pro lockdown dem btw.

Not that it matters much the CMR for covid is only 0.007% so it's not even that deadly to the vast majority of people.

Then said interference isn't fraud... That's wrong.   It's a super structure vs a substructure. You're missing the trees for the forrest.
1325693323567312896 2020-11-09 14:54:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @KhanKrumGaming @realDonaldTrump Yeah when ur looking at years in prison "I said I threw out thousands of trump's ballots" is your only goto. He should be investigated and waterboarded just to be sure lol

So if you said fraud is interference then it's factually the case.   Your statement is like saying ice is water but water isn't ice. It doesn't logically flow.

That stuff while it maybe there is fine but it's like food rations, amazing while they last till you're starving.

Dood I'm spitting truth here, not spinning my own fantasy lol. He may very well lose... But not yet 🤷‍♀️
1325617953342185477 2020-11-09 09:55:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @tanya120284 That's pretty sad. I had a lot of fun learning civics in my classes in japan and they expected you to at least know the local gov.

1325616603875119104 2020-11-09 09:50:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> How the hell can a society function if it's citizens aren't taught the functions and history of government? Civics is an important class
1325616014336339968 2020-11-09 09:47:41 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Punishedayylma1 College? I took civics in the east in early classes when I was a young teen. I think 14 I took civics?
1325615685540728839 2020-11-09 09:46:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @logandials Yeah but I'm not a citizen, I'm still on my visa so I've not had to take the test but I did take general civics but was mostly about immigration officials and officers. What I know is the self study I've done this year trying to figure out this election.
1325615058462892032 2020-11-09 09:43:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TumzWabz Lots of people like that. Lots of people think biden won. Idk it's weird people don't understand their own election systems
1325614824932470784 2020-11-09 09:42:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TumzWabz Lol nah FR wasn't dragging u cuz ur question was more about Twitter than the election. Example: the other day literally got into it with a girl who thought the ballot watchers were trump fans trying to intimidate the counters. They didn't even know what the watchers are.

Trump's still fighting in court and several States post certification will be doing mandatory recounts because the margin was too small. Biden hasn't won no matter how loudly the lamestream media croaks in its leftist swamp.
1325612062819672064 2020-11-09 09:31:59 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @kylekuzma Trump. He's not lost yet. Duh.

1325422507998982144 2020-11-08 20:58:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The real reason is to save face. According to either tim or LHM the reps can now redistrict her and basically make it impossible for her to win again. Idk that's the hot take I heard.

1325409927742058496 2020-11-08 20:08:46 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Biscuithammer0 @nehemiah171 @Styx666Official For example PA locked the doors and disallowed watchers in for 20 hours. This is illegal. When it gets to a judge it's very likely they could strip biden of over 600k votes counted illegally. That would flip PA. GA same. MI glitches in 47 counties. Etc.
1325408373651746817 2020-11-08 20:02:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Biscuithammer0 @nehemiah171 @Styx666Official Courts and recounts aren't debate. I don't expect a thing said here or to the news to flip a damn thing. Like I said it's too soon to call, I'm cautioning you about counting your eggs before they hatch. There is lots of things about to happen and it might change things, might not
1325407814601289728 2020-11-08 20:00:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Real_Serpico U think the riots are over? They're still going and they are going to get worse. If trump is forced out without a recount then things will explode. Likely will anyway but trump is far more likely to put down the riots if pushed.
1325406832312152064 2020-11-08 19:56:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Biscuithammer0 @nehemiah171 @Styx666Official No one is shrieking or crying. You're going "HAHA the games over!" and we're saying "um bro the refs and couches are arguing about something. Maybe wait to see what happens" and ur like "But the fans said that team won!"   Sorry the fans, media, etc don't decide this. We wait.

If you think the games done then fine go eat drink and be merry. Dance in the street. Don't cry if things flip. I'll be there with a smile knocking on your door being like "told ya so"

Courts certify the election and no one else.

1325403606254751744 2020-11-08 19:43:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Real_Serpico Idk about them but if you vote to give the nuclear codes to someone with very obvious dementia then... Idk not the brightest. Like if Trump had dementia then I'd be like "jesus please don't vote for him! I don't want him nuking japan thinking it's 1935!"
1325402859287011329 2020-11-08 19:40:41 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @ArchivedGoodies @Styx666Official State charges so he can't. Has to be federal charges. I was hoping he could long before now.

Lots of shady shit, even antitrumpers are calling it rigged

Everyone needs to sit back and watch the fireworks. We just hit half time, not the end of the game.

Lol bruh if you think antifa burning cities down was bad... That was like a few thousand pissed off soy faced college punks. The right isn't that and now they're pissed.

They counter bad ballots and argue against counters on ballots. They're part of the counting process and legally HAVE to be within 6 ft by federal law because they have to be able to read the damn ballot.
1325269372433293312 2020-11-08 10:50:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Give it a month lol they got till Dec and then SCOTUS is forced to do something

It's illegal. It's fraudulent. Rudy is moving to spoil up to 600k ballots that watchers were not permitted to see. Maybe even 900k. That's just in PA.

Have fun with that. Trump would never do this to save face. You have no idea about his character.

1325218071091556352 2020-11-08 07:26:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @anches @DrewThompson40 Means the house won't pass anything that requires anything more than simple majority so basically budget bills which will get rejected in the senate XD... Still tho I'm betting my money on trump being in the lead :-)
1325215332118704130 2020-11-08 07:15:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @anches @DrewThompson40 Sure bud. See ya in a few months. Even IF he loses we won the senate and took 7 seats in the house. We won big. Biden will be completely powerless.
1325215001993338881 2020-11-08 07:14:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MysteryMach66 Lol the news declared it and that's worthless. It's not over yet as I've said on repeat. The courts decide the winner and there's lots of evidence of rigging.  https://t.co/xBkRmV67qQ
1325214396025622528 2020-11-08 07:11:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @anches @DrewThompson40 Funny because trump is still filling suit and already biden is on track to lose 600k votes in PA. Trump still winning :-) not over till the legislature stamps it. The news doesn't choose the winner.     https://t.co/xBkRmVnIPq

1325210483465486336 2020-11-08 06:56:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Punished_Rex Of course. They're losers and the hate winners. Even in "victory" they're losers. I think they're still so mad because they know this is all fake and will be stripped away.

1325206348632453120 2020-11-08 06:39:49 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The fake news doesn't decide elections, courts do. You can cry, screech, bitch, and complain but end of the day the courts will decide if the Dems BS will be allowed to stand. I don't believe it will.

Nah fam 800k leads disappearing overnight and 90° shifts on counting are normal. They kicked out watchers, that's illegal. Those ballots will be invalidated.  https://t.co/ZaffidLpzM
1325202628058492929 2020-11-08 06:25:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @ProKingSushi Never happened. Retweeted a video of multiple people and one had a guy saying white power. When informed he deleted it. The news praises blacks saying black power so unless you condemn that I ignore your hypocrite stance.
1325200894766542848 2020-11-08 06:18:09 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @ProKingSushi Trump is literally none of those things. You're a moron and a puppet. Keep bleeting you damn sheep lol

Kicking out watchers is illegal. Accepting votes after the 3rd is illegal. Biden will lose a lot of those votes and GA. U bout to get trump 2020ed

1325185248150216704 2020-11-08 05:15:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @SBractancia @realDonaldTrump ID? Most states don't even ID you. They just ask you name. Florida is amoung the most secure because we have ID laws but we are the minority on that.
1325183205033578496 2020-11-08 05:07:51 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @PunishedR @ChillyOfTheBite Idk much of any warhammer lore. I know u had space marines and like corrupted ones who are chaos. Aliens. People with big pillgram hats, goblins. Think that's it
1325182375437824002 2020-11-08 05:04:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @SBractancia @realDonaldTrump You went "DUH" like I'm stupid so whatever but what you said is only true in some states. Others killed those rules. PA changed it so you didn't even need a signature and extended the date to get votes which is illegal and unconstitutional
1325181596987744257 2020-11-08 05:01:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @SGTSchaltz @Zidan_Lianciel Trump's not done yet. Not till we get drug out kicking and screaming and have tried everything legally possible!
1325179013879525377 2020-11-08 04:51:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> When the courts get done I'm looking forward to you shitting yourself now that that knots all worked out LOL

He was never suppose to win. They thought he was a joke but he won
1325169612724592641 2020-11-08 04:13:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Daemonkisame @KhanKrumGaming @TeeExTee Well my theory and I in no way am saying this is the case so no ban me. Obama governed a lot like bush and even tho he was anti war in his speeches he started a few, the reps are anti state power but never fought the patriot act. Imo politics might be a lot more like pro wrestlin
1325167894443880450 2020-11-08 04:07:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Daemonkisame @KhanKrumGaming @TeeExTee Honestly idk. It's more fishy imo that the republican's got more down ballot support than the party head. Makes no sense. I have a conspiracy theory as to why this is but Twitter likes to ban people pushing theories...
1325167105503850496 2020-11-08 04:03:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Daemonkisame @KhanKrumGaming @TeeExTee The day of votes were all counted on the day of the election so the Dems knew exactly what the ratio they needed to win so all they had to do was "find" the votes. This is why elections happen in a day so you can't cheat. Thankfully it's made it super obvious.
1325166580746084352 2020-11-08 04:01:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Daemonkisame @KhanKrumGaming @TeeExTee Then after the day of election with only 16% of the count remaining he got literally 9 of 10 votes to make the difference. That sound anything like reality? I just want this thing honest and RN it's not even remotely honest.
1325166233742815232 2020-11-08 04:00:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Daemonkisame @KhanKrumGaming @TeeExTee Idc if biden wins. I don't want it but if it happens it happens but frankly this whole thing is sus AF. Day of election trump was up big and then the tide slowly turned and the ratio completely flipped from 6:4 to 4:6 in georgia and from 8:3 in PA to 1:9. Trump was 800k ahead
1325165521885523970 2020-11-08 03:57:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @The_KeJo Last 2 words kill me. I was thinking parrot

And the observer is a stander outside the room watching the process from afar but with no power? Idk america election rules

Grab ur ass and get your soda ready because the real fight begins Monday and already looking like biden going to lose a million ballots in PA and about 30k in MI and thousands in GA from kicking out watchers.  https://t.co/ZG6QNlHGgn

1325142865840918530 2020-11-08 02:27:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MSFT__Incel @NationalistTV Yeah I'm in the Philippines so it would be pretty rough to do anything in another country.

That's my understanding and everything I've read was that he was suing to stop the count during election day (because the republican's ballot watchers were kicked out and denied entry which is illegal and shady AF)

Hardly the only thing we've seen but interesting. The "glitch" giving thousands of trump's votes to biden was way more interesting

As for red it wasn't proof, it was showing what the argument is and where our issues are. He lists the issues fairly well.

They're being stuffed in by several people and it's been reported all over not to mention like the watchers not being allowed within 100ft of the counters and them telling them they were done and then snuck in to keep counting.
1324898699642892291 2020-11-07 10:17:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @paritybydesign @Breaking911 @USPS Holy... You know how it's taken almost a week to count ballots? It's because they have a massive room FULL of ballots. They get them on the 4-5, dump them into big room with over a million uncounted and due to improper marks they're literally inseperable frm legit received on 3rd
1324897850791235584 2020-11-07 10:13:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @AxelBlazen Yeah and it will. That's why I'm stuck in Manila RN again

I'll say it once more so you will understand and if you still come back I'm considering you a liar. They postdated them specifically so they could bypass the court order and count them illegally. That's why it's a big deal.

The GOP and trump set a legal motion to stop any ballots after the 3rd, that's why they were changing the postmark dear, to sneak shit in. Otherwise it wouldn't be a big issue in the first place. Actually inform yourself.
1324890148832735233 2020-11-07 09:43:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @AxelBlazen Trump is the most lied about president in US history.

1324889383737159680 2020-11-07 09:40:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> If the president is so racist why hasn't he bombed any brown people for years like all his former peer? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😑

1324855301384916996 2020-11-07 07:24:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Because he is being audited as he's said on repeat and its very risky to release you financials on your private form while that happens. What does it matter anyway. Biden has way more illegal money from his son and Russia and China. Yes I know the news says it's false. It's not.
1324854859577831429 2020-11-07 07:23:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger It is how the vast majority get in. They're breaking the law, do you think they fill out a questionnaire on the way in to document their crime? They are lying to you.... As an immigrant with a visa I can tell you exactly how stupid that is. It's the stupidest way to stay here.
1324854164887932928 2020-11-07 07:20:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Yes more slowly because the transfer rate is down 87%. Do you even math?

1324852945377218563 2020-11-07 07:15:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Yes I did. They go on to blame trump's enforcement policy. The housing policy was obama's.
1324852681161232389 2020-11-07 07:14:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Literally the theme of the video. The "fine people on both sides" steven plays. Every news outlet literally cut out the part limediately before that where he explicitly states "I don't mean the neo Nazis and white supremeists" and played the last part OOC.
1324852224384733187 2020-11-07 07:12:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger No you haven't because you still repeat the BS. So you're either a Fking lier or a dumbass who didn't know better. One is a bad look because youre a liar PoS, the other because you didn't bother to even research. Take your pick.
1324851906079039492 2020-11-07 07:11:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger He said it even tho several outlets said he did so it must be true. Biden never lies!  https://t.co/gTpaoyr5Z1

Kamala and biden said they would grant medicare and legal assistance to "non documented citizens" and expand wellfare systems to them. I literally gain more by becoming illegal. Not even kidding.
1324851170519719937 2020-11-07 07:08:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Fk do you know any immigrants? We Fking hate illegals more than anyone. They jump in illegally, steal from the system, and every year they just make them citizens outright while we do it the legal and correct way.
1324850778574651394 2020-11-07 07:06:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Yeah ending racism by siding with neo segregation in the name of wokeness. Weird way to end something by bringing it back... Weird flex but ok...
1324850348759142404 2020-11-07 07:05:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Again and? So someone enforces you (without your permission) so that magically makes you evil? Spencer enforced biden. I don't hold that against biden. He can't control that. What has trump ever done to actually give duke an ounce of power. Nothing.
1324849782653898754 2020-11-07 07:02:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Ok and? That's 1 guy. Like I said the far left is literally trying to restart segregation and what has David duke even done? Spencer is at least active and on the ground.
1324849464167833602 2020-11-07 07:01:41 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Dude when you're a rich property magnate your income taxes are the least you pay. Your hard assets and property taxes are your hard taxes. He likely barely has a notable income since his entire worth is tied into hard assets.
1324848861828046849 2020-11-07 06:59:17 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger You wonder why I just resorted to trolling your dumbass yesterday? Because you immediately get emotional and can't have a conversation without being a smug soy filled prick
1324848530628947971 2020-11-07 06:57:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Then why is immigration down 87% since the 400 miles of wall has been built and since when has boarder enforcement been a bad thing. Cross into mexico illegally, you'll find they don't treat it as a whoopsy daisy and let you keep going.
1324848064528527360 2020-11-07 06:56:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Most of the guys I hang around are jocks lol I was really big friends with a lot of the sports guys. They were hardly nerdy incels.
1324847747938328580 2020-11-07 06:54:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger And? I retweet stupid ass people 2, doesn't mean I want to enforce their msg. I RT you yesterday and it's clear I really disagree with you because you literally don't understand shit you're talking about.
1324847433013170180 2020-11-07 06:53:37 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger IDGAF about the news bro. I've literally watched trump and listened to what he said and turned around and read that shyt where they literally take him out of context or completely twist his words.
1324847053026037760 2020-11-07 06:52:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger IDGAF about msm BS. Go watch that video, listen to the man fucking speak. He never said a bad thing without a caviat. Even the drug dealers and rapists from mexico... He was specifically talking about criminal aliens running from the Mexican police!
1324846580529246210 2020-11-07 06:50:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Nope... Well honestly I likely could vote just not legally yet. Honestly I gain more not becoming a citizen and just overstaying my visa and working under the table tbh.
1324846203033522177 2020-11-07 06:48:43 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Lastly he seeperated children? You mean the obama era edict that transfered over into his presidency that he ended? They never seem to mention him ending the cages and building a housing center that actually takes care of the kids.  https://t.co/CSYixoJXFG
1324845162846191616 2020-11-07 06:44:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger He's released his financial release forms that are about 200 pages of hard assets and cash transactions. They're way more detailed than a tax form. Noticed you skipped answering if you pay more taxes than you owe. Noted.
1324844781751672834 2020-11-07 06:43:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Also you want a taste, go to richard spencer's Twitter, the neo Nazis, he's been a hardcore biden boy from the drop.
1324844491086417921 2020-11-07 06:41:55 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger He doesn't pay his taxes: he literally overpaid 10 million dollars. Do you purposely pay more taxes than you owe for the lolz? Then why do you expect him to? Because he has more? Then take it up with biden, his team has written the tax code trump used the last 50 years.
1324844061057044487 2020-11-07 06:40:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Biden is literally enforced by the Nazis and KKK bro. The left are bringing back segregation to bring "racial justice" and even california recently tried to get rid of equal protections in its state charter.  https://t.co/L9rWVSm60f
1324843547619713025 2020-11-07 06:38:10 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger His actions resulted in the death toll only being 10% of the estimated dead. I'd say that's a damn good job.
1324843391130193925 2020-11-07 06:37:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Pandemic: the last one was in 1918. You try to handle something no living human has done. Biden spent a ton of time saying he would do better and never outlined a way. Fauci even said he likely saved millions with his actions. The estimate was like 2 million dead, 200K died but
1324842886706434050 2020-11-07 06:35:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger He's not kept his promises? Yes he has or he has to the best of his ability. Not seen a thing he has failed at doing or starting imo.
1324842654442672129 2020-11-07 06:34:37 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger That's character defects. You think all men don't talk like that. Most guys I hang around say sht like that all the time and brag about how women like them. Grabbing a private is literally 2nd base. Have you never gotten laid?
1324842092724686849 2020-11-07 06:32:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Racist: he literally has more supporters in the minorities including myself than any president in 80 years. Thought it was 60 but it was since the 1960s. He's outright called out racism and disavowed over 60 times.    https://t.co/qKIsnxPmmp
1324841376635408389 2020-11-07 06:29:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger I will address your stupidity 1 section at a time. He's a sexual predator. No he's not. He was accused of it my many women. So was biden. People lie. Until it's in a court and proven with evidence then no one can claim that on either side.
1324840942180978692 2020-11-07 06:27:49 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Yeah... That's the implication.
1324840868348633088 2020-11-07 06:27:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Literally most of that is BS and the only one you got right was he divided this country... Like every president because the US and a multiparty system. Surprise!

1324840094293962752 2020-11-07 06:24:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Yeah like that fascist @Timcast and @joerogan... Dood the left has lost its dam mind lol
1324839786750857222 2020-11-07 06:23:14 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @PunishedR @Sethro80 @Steve79710920 Useless endeavor. These numbskulls would poo poo a burning barrel of ballots with Palosi dancing beside it. They don't even realize every election past this is never going to be trusted.
1324838557270347780 2020-11-07 06:18:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> They had to make sure to get the ratio right so biden would just barely win. Deep purple counties in PA went 125% biden. That's right, the county somehow grew 1/4 of its pop in 2 years.
1324837914849742849 2020-11-07 06:15:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Bloovolcano ? I don't understand the second sentence
1324835531000262663 2020-11-07 06:06:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Also be my president? I'm not even a citizen. I'm an immigrant. Idc so much if Biden wins. If he does what he said you all will be giving me "free" healthcare and lawyers and wellfare programs. Not really free tho since you're going to be taxed at like 70%.
1324834919911219201 2020-11-07 06:03:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @biddymonger Why do you hate him? I've literally never found a single person with a legit reason other than his attitude. Also we shall see. Votes not in and even then they going to recount and challenge votes and biden not that far ahead.
1324834452103667712 2020-11-07 06:02:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Literally all of us did lol magic ballots.
1324834207252795398 2020-11-07 06:01:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> This was at 99% last night now it's 98%?  https://t.co/XTdapeJBjR

1324583578802528257 2020-11-06 13:25:09 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @gabriel_gabdiel Idk could happen but then it would literally put the election in infinite limbo
1324583100286857219 2020-11-06 13:23:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Maybe or maybe not. Who knows. Maddow hasn't screamed yet.
1324582320607760384 2020-11-06 13:20:09 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy His approval rate (before the election this year) was higher than when he was elected. I even went on to add "when he was elected it was 45, now it is 47" which is higher than before obama's second term.
1324581825898029056 2020-11-06 13:18:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @killpidone I never claed that. That was a tweet I shared. I've not even looked at the sauce lol no one will know if it's valid or not till the votes get audited. I don't see how anyone can verify it one way or the other till then.
1324580909018943488 2020-11-06 13:14:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee You've literally debated me for hours while we just been dunking on you while you screech "it's not trueeeeee that's a tweet!"
1324580546979241984 2020-11-06 13:13:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy God you're stupid. Learn to read smooth brain.
1324580259157725184 2020-11-06 13:11:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Recounts in all swing states basically where they will examine the ballots
1324579667207200768 2020-11-06 13:09:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Call it a hunch.
1324579356480573441 2020-11-06 13:08:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee We don't trust tech for a reason. When the audits come in tho it going to be very reveiling
1324578986442264576 2020-11-06 13:06:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy In fact his approval was higher than obama before his second term during his incumbent election
1324578775640715264 2020-11-06 13:06:04 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy His approval was higher than when he was elected bro. He was 45 on day 1, 47 before the election. Also he got the highest minority voters than any republican in 60 years. The outperformed like crazy this year.
1324577549050138627 2020-11-06 13:01:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee We shall see when they audit the vote.
1324577275900272640 2020-11-06 13:00:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy Not typical in incumbent races. Even biden said what he did was rare AF.
1324577009104752641 2020-11-06 12:59:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee When scotus rules and they examine the ballots and kick out thousands of dead people who voted it's going to be hella funny
1324576593273081856 2020-11-06 12:57:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy Sure bud. Like I said it's 100% legit. 90° angles in states that were heavily trump in 2016. Sure.
1324575879469694977 2020-11-06 12:54:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy It's all legit. Biden just seems to jump at night in heavy trump areas for no reason.  https://t.co/ODS6V1LK7S

1324572643849363456 2020-11-06 12:41:42 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy It not from 2020, they're all just wearing masks in the video because it was stylish in 2018. Fk you're stupid.

1324571116623536130 2020-11-06 12:35:38 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee @BrexitFoxy Funny how you call it a lie when you have zero evidence. I call it censoring because it is and it's blatant. Show me one democrat that's been hit with that. I won't wait because I literally don't have forever to wait for the literal zero answer.
1324570602032816129 2020-11-06 12:33:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Didn't answer my question. Does looking into a room change a single vote?
1324569992512364549 2020-11-06 12:31:10 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @BrexitFoxy @dainaaee Yeah saw them tossing and destroying ballots right in front of the news camera lol was like wtf

1324563630784958464 2020-11-06 12:05:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> What has trump done that's authoritarian? Please enlighten the class because he's the first president in 30 years to not start a war and has created peace in the middle east. Not seen him ever cut away a single right.

1324549660887945216 2020-11-06 11:10:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Yes fam. PA literally lives off fracking and Biden said on repeat he wants to end it. PA is voting in droves for the man who will end their chief industry. Sure pal. If true americans are stupider than I ever imagined.

1324547811980070912 2020-11-06 11:03:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Tf do the lines have to do with the lawsuit? The lawsuit was to let the watchers back in. One the first day, when trump was ahead, it was normal; after the dumps they started boarding up the windows and denying the watchers to come in. That's why the suit was filed.
1324547324392165378 2020-11-06 11:01:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @xysnes64yx @xPunishedGutsx The other is my own discord and it's a ghost town lol
1324547079562240002 2020-11-06 11:00:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @xysnes64yx @xPunishedGutsx I don't really do discord fam. No offense. I'm in like 3 and 1 of them I am constantly getting hounded for never coming online lol
1324546638359207937 2020-11-06 10:58:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Um no the one he filed and won. Try reading the news.  https://t.co/WGxzxDkBuH
1324545796310732800 2020-11-06 10:55:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Lol the watchers themselves said this and trump had to sue the state because it was true and after the injection they wouldn't even let the watchers back in. If you believe vertical lines are normal then you're completely disengaged
1324544562120052736 2020-11-06 10:50:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Yeah because this is normal. Not weird at all for counters to say they're stopping for the night and then minutes later (after the watchers were gone) magically found 100k votes all for biden. Funny how that works.  https://t.co/XcKUCFF84E
1324543847855235073 2020-11-06 10:47:16 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Literally just scroll my TL. Not doing the leg work for you to ignore facts and waste my time. Been through that dance too often. It's literally all over Twitter so I have issues believing you've completely not seen it.
1324543076614967296 2020-11-06 10:44:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lmao wtf... We need election reform... This shyt is unacceptable @PurePoliceCams
1324542453504946176 2020-11-06 10:41:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee Because people don't question a small lead. Also check the veritas drops. Literal republican ballot harvester getting dem down ballot votes except her 1 republican backer to "make the ballot look legit"
1324541353347436544 2020-11-06 10:37:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee We shall see. Even if not a recount will likely kick out hundreds to thousands of fake ballots. 👌
1324540204615667713 2020-11-06 10:32:48 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Why do all these biden ballots seem to drop so late at night? 🤔
1324539247953649664 2020-11-06 10:29:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @dainaaee This last drop was the only one he's fallen below 70% which he only needs 59% overall
1324537728449601542 2020-11-06 10:22:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> #Arizona Biden lead shrinks again. Down to 46,257

1324535441773780992 2020-11-06 10:13:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Yeah stupid Dems be pulling up on the gas station one day and be like "wtf why is gas $22 a gallon?!"  Then someone goes "oh biden shut down the oil like he campaigned on"   Only then they realize lol

Gtfoh with that pandering BS

1324532858082439168 2020-11-06 10:03:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Doubt anything will come of this but... Trump's been scaling he are in the NY vote. He was at like 37% last night, now he's within spitting distance. @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/NUSS6YsN0Q
1324528929890308098 2020-11-06 09:48:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I will say this and @Timcast should talk about this.

I could get free healthcare, food, even lawyers paid for by the US sucke- citizen and just work under the table.

1324523740923891714 2020-11-06 09:27:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I heard about this on @scrowder, apparently it's called vote "curation". Also don't like it. Seems likely to be corrupted. Idk why poll watchers don't also undersee this (tho not like they can get within 200ft of the counters RN anyway)
1324522719053025281 2020-11-06 09:23:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @DocStrangelove2 Wtf is it with big cities being so democrat and why is it the opposite for asians? The bigger our collective the more authoritarian we get lol

The only 2 that have declared for biden is Fox which redacted the call after a backlash and AP which refuses to recall their call. No other map has AZ filled for biden. 3 more drops and every drop is 60%+ trump so far.
1324520960028864512 2020-11-06 09:16:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> AZ news. New drop. Trump grows again shrinking Biden's lead from 76K to 56,361

They are counting votes that come in after election day and yes that's sus AF and prone to cheating. "OMG we need 3000 more ballots to beat that guy! Let's extend our date 3 days and go raid nursing homes!"  Or just make up fake ballots

The "tin foil hat" you mean the videos VIDEOS we have of rep poll watchers being kicked out, 100k of 1 side votes showing up at 4am in 3 states, wallpapered glass etc. If it was on our side I'd call it shady AF also

Definitely shady shit in WI and MI. This won't be settled by a simple vote tho 100%. Gonna be in court and recounts. Too many videos showing 154 yo ppl voting for biden and Ryan dawson recently showed ballot burning.

1323971344300736512 2020-11-04 20:52:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Extremely. Votes in NC and GA remaining are all hard R areas. Not only will the gap not close it should widen. PA at 70% with 800k lead for trump. To even narrow the gap every last vote would have to be biden.

1321980470951878656 2020-10-30 09:01:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Trump's been telling his people to vote in person at every speech. Guess who just lost thousands of votes? Likely biden 🤣

1321650892555358208 2020-10-29 11:11:42 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @QuarantinedCoof lol you gotta see this
1321650351032967168 2020-10-29 11:09:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Dems attempt to cheat by forcing an unproven and risky and fraudulent latent method to vote is backfiring in the most spectacular way. The Dems only have themselves to blame. Trump said to allow voting in person, the medical professionals said it was fine, the govs forced it.
1321649478013718528 2020-10-29 11:06:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @EricHolder Funny how the story changes when they kneecap you at the end. Went from "trump can't delay the election! We even voted in the civil war" to "we can't vote in person, someone might get a cough! Ignore fauci saying it's fine!" To "holy shit we can't cheat like we planned! Vote!"
1321647543554637824 2020-10-29 10:58:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> We tried to change the rules months before the election and the big bad court said it was illegal! It's not our fault. It's the bad old republicans!! 🥺😭😭😭😭
1321646722603515904 2020-10-29 10:55:08 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Still find it funny the "illusion" persists that trump will steal the election when Dems are forcing wide spread changes months before the election that are high risk of fraud.   The one trying to steal something is the ones trying to change the rules before the game.
1321643978148712448 2020-10-29 10:44:14 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TheBabylonBee How many undead? Is Trump courting the zombie vote this year?

1321289995215425538 2020-10-28 11:17:37 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Most "mega corporations" you see are actually small business owners. Most franchise off of a corp and eat profits and losses all the same.

He never said federal land till after he was being grilled on it. He wants zero emissions by 2025 which means no cars, no planes, no boats etc.   Basically welcome to the dark ages. #debates

The chart just is common sense stuff that if wages increase prices increase while above wage jobs remain stagnant. The price increase is due to hyper inflation by the fed printing money like crazy instead of using the standard

You don't break in the door and then ask for tea. You go to a US embassy and apply for asylum and when accepted get taken into the USA. Do you have any idea how any of this works?
1319321730243006470 2020-10-23 00:56:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @qwer121212 @Pipo60230616 @melissa_bianco6 @fuckhead25 @Styx666Official @JoeBiden They do it because a lot of the people who cross the border are criminals trying to escape mexican police. They dont want children in the same holding as possible murderers and rapists. The leftists cheered obama doing this under his rule but it became "children in cages" 4 trump

Immigration is not a right. They want in then they file in like we did.
1319320205999353858 2020-10-23 00:50:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @WowOfficial_ @fuckhead25 @Styx666Official @JoeBiden Lol maybe read the rest of my posts before spouting BS. I'm an immigrant, I came from a 3rd world country, and I came in during the trump era. Just because I knock on your door and request entry doesn't mean if you refuse to answer or take too long I can kick your door open.

1319032946943287304 2020-10-22 05:48:55 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Zero chances of that. My family paid the proper fees, learned the language, took the proper steps, went to the classes we were required to, signed the documentants we needed to. When you enter legally you dont get treated like a criminal because youre not breaking the law
1319031763092623362 2020-10-22 05:44:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Imagine unironically simping for bank robbers because they just want money like workers all over the country get everyday. Thats Free-border advocates. There is a legal way to get in and migrants like myself are the example.

I see trump having to fight his own party, the dems, the news is completely and deliberately biased against him, big tech is censoring him with a smile, billionaires are supporting commie anarchists. Just seems the powerful all share vision
1318989090700886016 2020-10-22 02:54:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 @JoeBiden The plan of the politicians. The back and forth is all fake. The dems and republicans fight in public but kiss each other behind the blinds. I'd say some people have issues but they end up blacklisted and voted out, unsupported. Just my feeling on things.
1318986714254397441 2020-10-22 02:45:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 @JoeBiden I've seen nothing of trump thats toxic. I don't see trump as a cure. He only has 8 years and he is literally the only outsider and it takes so much money he is like a firework: Glorious but temporary. Honestly I see his run even if given 8 years as a temporary relief.
1318986056088387592 2020-10-22 02:42:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 @JoeBiden Yes that doesn't subtract any tho from my initial point; they're illegal immigrants. Its not a great thing but if they weren't attempting to break the law then it wouldn't happen, correct?
1318983778916798464 2020-10-22 02:33:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 @JoeBiden not to sound callus but as a legal migrant maybe they shouldn't try to break into the country illegally and they wouldnt be separated from their kids? Its messy but border security is important. The policy that separates kids was obama/biden anyway  https://t.co/BxTnn7cPEX

1318972147176525824 2020-10-22 01:47:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Wrongspeak1984 @JoeBiden record low unemployment, peace deals across the world, energy independence, national security, taking out human trafficking, hes not a politician (they're all corrupt), putting citizens above other nations, Hes not a commie. Likely more those were off my head.

1318959944943734785 2020-10-22 00:58:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> imo trump should do the final debate and everytime he is asked a question then just say "I answered that" then spend the rest of his time bodying biden on corruption and scandal and lack of response

I could care less of his history. If he kicked a puppy to death last year his statement "The sky is blue" is no less true.  If hes lying now then hmu

When and if he starts posting BS and I don't believe anyone, including the novel poster, at a hat drop then I'll stop watching but so far hes been pretty accurate and relaying the facts.
1318747201036820481 2020-10-21 10:53:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @glarfed @nickposting lol dood I'm 20 and I've yet to even get heated at anyone here. Lame memes and boring comebacks aside its been more of a chore than a trial.

I could care less about his history or that novel, no body got time for that.   I see his tweet "Antifa rip down statue" *posts video of antifa ripping down statue* I fail to see how that deboonks his report

Also @50cent you're rich, your TR would likely be like 80%. Thats the commie party!

Like if I had 12 followers then naming 7 as my alts would be like "Oh Maya is a fake and not well liked because 80% of her followers are alts" but I am close to 1600... Why would I still waste time simulating 7 other personalities?

Ran a group of trolls called top of the barrel or barrel for short. He got outted as a pedo and they threw him out and in losing his discord he "lost everything" and now pretends to X himself for attention. @FNGR101
1317208360282968072 2020-10-17 04:58:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> It just occurred to me that Trump is a Florida Man and now 2020 makes a lot more sense.

No they had full auto weapons and cannons that citizens could buy with the #2A, so when they say "should a citizen own a nuke?" Washington would say 👍

1316969863483633664 2020-10-16 13:10:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Hope trump rips up 230 and replaces it with something solid AND then goes after the news. The lies and BS can not persist. The job of news is to inform, not push agendas.

I am XXX name, send legal ID to prove I am me, get a check.  Now it is only given if you're "important", usually a news agency emailing Twitter saying "this is our girl, give her a checkmark"  Milo lost his check because he was RW.

1315388851171422208 2020-10-12 04:28:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @NewsM101 Good job meme!
1315387379885076481 2020-10-12 04:22:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> .@shaunking story is like if Trump went and got a spray tan and then claimed to be an oompa loompa and a bunch of idiots believed it and started giving him money.
1315386273788379136 2020-10-12 04:18:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @xPunishedGutsx True. Tim is mixed race, Shaun's parents are both white.
1315385806194835456 2020-10-12 04:16:29 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @shaunking Shaun you're white and you defrauded a black only contest to steal their money. Do a 23 and me and prove me wrong. You've done more to harm blacks than anyone.
1315382308975771649 2020-10-12 04:02:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> It's only 3 million slaves my dude.... Ok. I guess I'm the weird one for hating slavery and thinking even 1 slave is too many.
1315381872680005632 2020-10-12 04:00:51 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @postcapitalistT That's literally capitalism bro. It's not a hard concept. It's weirdos and gov flunkies who make it into some weird ass 3D mind game chess.
1315381280893091840 2020-10-12 03:58:30 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> You.... You realize I mean real slaves right? Not like "omg he makes 7 an hour! That's like slavery bro!"... Right? I mean literal get in a cage, we own your a$$, slavery.  https://t.co/MX5XXm6oGV
1315380510969876481 2020-10-12 03:55:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @postcapitalistT No I'm not. He damn near tripled MHI in 3 years. That's something no president has accomplished in 2 terms or even close. According to many FMFs the US would have been in a second great depression RN but instead the market is booming.
1315379791474749440 2020-10-12 03:52:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Will it? You know in capitialism you make a better product or the same product but cheaper and you outpreform and kill the old business. It's like financial evolution. The weak dies to it's stronger competition.  A business opened in the USA has zero terrifs and open innovation
1315378410525388800 2020-10-12 03:47:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @xPunishedGutsx Is that real or fake trump?
1315376814135545856 2020-10-12 03:40:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @postcapitalistT @albrecht1968 I can actually answer this fairly easily. China has the worlds highest slave population on earth. They use those to make stuff so china can sell those at insanely low cost. A US made phone paying actual wages would be insanely expensive.
1315375219192684544 2020-10-12 03:34:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @OGPhantom2 Honestly idk if it's TDS. He's not mentioned trump so much. Think it's just a brainwashed person who's been fed the "communism is awesome!" Stuff and never really looked into it. A lot of my classmates in uni also are pro commie. It's hard to not go off on them.
1315374603976417280 2020-10-12 03:31:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @hamsternaut67 @DickMolesterson The lack of warski is odd
1315371256452128770 2020-10-12 03:18:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Fun fact: Trump says if he gets re-elected he wants to get rid of income taxes. You would literally own the full value of your labor for once. Taxes are ownership.
1315370736110927875 2020-10-12 03:16:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Then let them suffer terriffs. Let them suffer taxes on exporting. The US is the largest (I believe) buyers market for free capitol so they lose out by being hindered.
1315370389497933824 2020-10-12 03:15:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> It creates the environment for employment and jobs. That's why trump got the labor market and participation to record lows. He unchained the regulatory and tax chains off these companies so hiring and producing in the US wasn't a major loss.
1315369843437297664 2020-10-12 03:13:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> They've already done that and been doing that. That's why the US doesn't have anything "made in the USA" till recently. The markets we're completely open with 0% terriffs. The new structure reduces taxes for american companies hiring american and outsourced labor is terrifed
1315369141197582336 2020-10-12 03:10:16 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Not sure but... I think if I remember 12 were discussing a complete move. 9 pulled back, 3 completed the move.   ...think GE, ford, and..... Last one escapes me
1315368150179950593 2020-10-12 03:06:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Move to the lowest bidder? Tax wise? They already do that. That's why they're here. The "tax loopholes" politicians cry about are deals they put into place and don't remove. The corps own these people. The US is a tax haven.
1315367756749996032 2020-10-12 03:04:46 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> It's ironic when you say trump did nothing and ask how I fail to see anything...  You realize like 9 corps were on track to leave before he was elected and he told them they're be terrifed 35% and they stayed, the AMCT has caused a LOT of auto parts and manufacturing to return
1315365962603024387 2020-10-12 02:57:38 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @JackPierceBooks @xPunishedGutsx  https://t.co/9Z8amheDFf
1315364753577975810 2020-10-12 02:52:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Have I once in our small exchange defending US outsourcing? That's why I support Trump because the politicians are bought and paid for by slave labor china and he's trying to limit and/or stop that.   I support completely free market capitalism in its purist form.
1315363120328568834 2020-10-12 02:46:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @postcapitalistT It's not capitalism when the government has control of the businesses fool. That's communism.   "But muh workers owning the means of production" I hear you cry, that's a lie. That's how they get drool monkeys like you to let them in.
1315361270049112065 2020-10-12 02:38:59 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> How about you prove china isn't communist before you invoke the "but muh name fallacy"  How you think china dumps resources like steel and jewels for next to nothing? Because slave commie labor and control of resources.  How about you actually research for once.

1315329223847018504 2020-10-12 00:31:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I expect if trump wins he will pull the insurrection act and legit start going after all these fks, even the ones in power(congress), tho if not then I fully support the people doing what needs to be done.
1315327302314668033 2020-10-12 00:24:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lol we did it all wrong @xPunishedGutsx

1315326064114139136 2020-10-12 00:19:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> China is experiencing a damon RN. Already starting to ration. I been waiting because anyone who knows anything about commies knows what happens during a food shortage.
1315324506567827457 2020-10-12 00:12:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Communism doesn't mean businesses don't exist, it means the businesses are owned by the government. So they control the places you work, they can (and do) force you to work, and they control how much you make and can arrest you or worse if you're unable to work.
1315323441348849664 2020-10-12 00:08:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @postcapitalistT @RedDragonCro @xPunishedGutsx ...yes... That's why the controlling party is the Chinese communist party aka the CCP

1314552173800247297 2020-10-09 21:03:56 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> If the politicians think these riots were bad, if the police think these few hundred people are impossible to control: steal the election and watch the dam from hell break open and the snarling hounds of hell pour out. It will be a full on CW.

You realize if they defund the police there will be less officers and the few who remain will care less? They want the police dismantled so imagine no police response.

1313643452270170112 2020-10-07 08:52:59 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Is there a place to house @jack so he can quit destroying it? If they stopped being censorious the extremes would check each other. With the right (not even far right) being banned it leaves only the far left and the nutbags. Look at any muslim nation to see what happens then.

Otherwise the statement is like saying I want force conscription because I "venerate" the troops. If they Venerate traditional gender roles its ok
1312780714702594053 2020-10-04 23:44:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Its_CCHogan @tatpics1 I wrap my bf up. I don't let him go do danger stuff and if he did I'd definitely be upset and voice it. I'm talking about veneration and social core manipulation btw not legal subjugation. If you value someone you want to keep them safe and the world's dangerous.
1312778552085946369 2020-10-04 23:36:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @tatpics1 @Its_CCHogan The feminist brain cancer of muh misogyny always confused me. Most men love women and want them taken care of. When a modern man wants his woman to stay at home ats because he treasures her and wants her safe, meanwhile they think it's like they want them in a prison.

The sheet masks are not designed for respiration of pathogens. Only the blocking of your own germs. That's why my mask has a filter to breath through with a filter.
1312545882743603200 2020-10-04 08:11:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Socialistic medicine is single payer. Medical care is expensive. How do you think communistic countries control the cost? They don't treat you if you're too badly sick. They let u die. That's how socialism works. Try history.

It claims white traits are all positive and says all races should segregate. That's why you have "black only spaces" on campus. It's a very well crafted way to set whites apart from other races.  https://t.co/okjBdCtMEp

1311464564303654912 2020-10-01 08:34:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I think you have a lot bigger issues like your DA refusing to charge anyone and cutting them loose just so they can Burn Loot and Murder again. Trump supports law enforcement, Biden called you all the enemy of the people. You're lack of support just shows your lack of IQ.

1311452561061277696 2020-10-01 07:47:10 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lol not saying you should. Just saying a lot of people think Spencer and the fashy guys endorsing Biden is a joke or a smear. It's not, the left are literally causing segregation and racial isolation. The 2 agree on that XD
1311451982419292161 2020-10-01 07:44:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @HoltTheOne @JoeyScarantino @Breaking911 Hell follow @MrAndyNgo and SEE this group that barely exist cause damage and chaos every night. You know video? Evidence? That stuff your side never looks for?
1311451628956872706 2020-10-01 07:43:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @HoltTheOne @JoeyScarantino @Breaking911 Typical idiot left wing thinking "muh fictional stories". For a group that barely exists: 112 days of extended riots, 42 deaths attributed to their actions, 329 cases of vehicular damage, 84 cases of property damage, 419 arrests across the US, and 6 BILLION dollars of dmg.
1311450365691191296 2020-10-01 07:38:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Not to mention they're pro segregation and have these "black only spaces" and all that. The left are doing exactly what the white nationalist want.
1311450364261007360 2020-10-01 07:38:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Doesn't matter if you reject an endorsement. It's not a gift, it's a statement that you agree with them. It's no wonder Spencer agrees with the radical left and biden. Do you even know what critical race theory is? That being on time and holding a job are white attributes n

I didn't know you could sue an idea.   By your logic trump could have said "White supremacy is an idea not an organization" and it's be fine lol
1311302339081445376 2020-09-30 21:50:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lol he was just a "stupid bastard" right joe?

Wtf do u think the right wing supports?   Also even the NYT article says he OVERPAID, you're arguing he didn't pay enough.

1311280563022475264 2020-09-30 20:23:43 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @LSDriftFox @CryptoSave @realDonaldTrump If you want to prove me wrong on that then when you go to pay taxes this year then go and declare no dependants, infact overpay on purpose. It's all fun and games till it's your wallet. I at least come from a place of honesty.
1311280111732183041 2020-09-30 20:21:55 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @LSDriftFox @CryptoSave @realDonaldTrump Exactly. Pull YOURSELF up by YOUR bootstraps. The average american doesn't get benefitted one bit by tax based programs. You work, make money, and take care of yourself. Take the most boisterous "Tax the rich 99%", give them 100 mil, and watch how fast they retract.

1311172065496449024 2020-09-30 13:12:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> That follows with national poling like last week. @Rasmussen_Poll has trump favored by 60% by Latinos.

1311127003924324353 2020-09-30 10:13:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Dear Biden,  White supremacy is an idea as well. Guess we cant blame white supremacists.

It's an example, an allusion to the same effect. Anyone can make sht up and start spreading it as fact.
1311003425128157185 2020-09-30 02:02:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> 4/ Fact that literally no one can put shyt up to back their claims should speak volumes. Read the SS you posted anyway, I never said I'd block you for asking, I said I'd block people for parroting. If they're just there to make accusation without proof then I don't have to readit
1311003423534280704 2020-09-30 02:02:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> 3/ Literally anything more than whatever you post. If ppl think I'm a guy idc and I don't reeee at them.

1310943425659908096 2020-09-29 22:04:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @apoc_sorc Oh and new policy as of yesterday back your sht up or get blocked. Idc if you follow me or whatever. I'll give you time to take your mouth off your E-Celeb masters dk to ask for evidence but if you're just going to accuse me of sht without it then you're just a waste of time.

1310798400627994624 2020-09-29 12:27:46 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Sex with lots of people is gross. It spreads diseases and it's generally sick. Male or female. If you move away then you can lose the stigma but if you do it then you will get the stigma. I clean trash and serve drinks. I could sell my body but that means selling my self respect

Its a sense of humor for the dark stuff I guess, who knows. I post and laugh at pics of commies getting run over. Around here we laugh at the worst.
1310785445773541378 2020-09-29 11:36:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @SOTBanana It just is. If you dont find it funny then I guess you cant get it. its like trying to explain a joke. If you didnt laugh then the added detail isnt going to make it funny. It just is.

1310782057065230336 2020-09-29 11:22:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> idk Boogie or frank (and the post was a copy and paste of a post Boogie made concerning frank pointing a shoot gun at a monitor pic)  As for my opinion I think its a hilarious sh*tshow

1310780195834535938 2020-09-29 11:15:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> So I thought about ignoring this Boogie But I think its important to talk about it.  This is NOT ok.  I can take a joke for sure.  But death threats are against the law and this qualifies as one.  Kids don't get yourself in trouble for a "joke" like this.   It's not worth it.  https://t.co/xl7nSROZV1

1310360657024352256 2020-09-28 07:28:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei Yep I mean on historical events effects and morality we don't disagree at all, we only disagree on the initial spark or to be more specific its the implementation of policy matters that caused the spark which I feel we kind of agree on somewhat.
1310360079380525059 2020-09-28 07:26:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei True and sorry for the delay. Had a former debate flare up lol someone I didn't agree with on anything. The issue is the scare didn't come from no where and there was a building resentment from the north and a push for that action combined with lincoln's moderateness that flared
1310356318859874304 2020-09-28 07:11:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> You've not even proved he paid nothing. You're taking an assertion that he pays nothing and dictating it as fact even though the taxes maddow of MSNBC read out showed he paid millions. Sauce below.  https://t.co/YReWFNDgZ8
1310354013670354944 2020-09-28 07:01:56 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Who knows? Honestly IDGAF about his taxes. I'm basically a super capitalist. Think taxes suck. My main concern is if he's bringing jobs and stuff to the US and if he's keeping the businesses from abusing outsourcing and using the US as a tax haven. He's doing that.
1310353331722747904 2020-09-28 06:59:14 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I'm watching this press conference and tbh getting the feeling you didn't. The story isn't that he paid 0, it was that he paid 750 or something a year and he didn't bounce back and forth: he address this strongly and said no, it was fake news and lies. Still not heard commie rmk
1310352790544240640 2020-09-28 06:57:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 I'm almost at the end and not heard him say this yet
1310352683497213953 2020-09-28 06:56:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The president addressed this in his press conference and even the reporter asking said they (The NYT) weren't releasing the numbers or sources so basically it's hearsay so far.

1310343600866078721 2020-09-28 06:20:34 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei On the federalization of laws and stuff like that we primarily agree but the issue I saw and see is the 21c view on a very new USA that functioned very differently. The reason they fought had to do with slavery indeed but it was that breach beyond the power.
1310343174338961410 2020-09-28 06:18:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei Ok so now that you agree on that then consider everyone during the civil war era understood that to be the role of gov. That the abolition of slavery via legislative action by the executive and fed were, to them, an extreme overreach.
1310342734540988418 2020-09-28 06:17:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 Maddow literally read is 1040s on air and said he paid like 53 million in taxes in 2016 or 15. Also would like the source. Everytime he's ever said commies he would always say "well he's not but the people and the far left that control him are." And on that he's not wrong
1310338122241044481 2020-09-28 05:58:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Them out and install people who would do the right thing. It was not up to NY and Cali to decide what Florida should be allowed to do. That's common now but back then it was against the entire framework. That's why you can be in a weed legal state and catch federal charges.
1310333747112239104 2020-09-28 05:41:24 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei Like let me break this down. If lincoln never did the slavery thing then there would be no war on drugs, abortion, etc. States would control by their own local electorate what they would and would not allow. This over reach is why federal restriction on ownership exist.
1310332378171097088 2020-09-28 05:35:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei @SnacksThanks Yes and you just got the nail on the head. FORCEFULLY. They weren't afraid slavery would be ended, they feared an over-reach and the federalization of property and restriction over the states. Back then the gov making laws that over ruled the states individual law was unheard of
1310330507683528704 2020-09-28 05:28:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei Yes that was illegal due to an overreach and restriction without due process or recompense. That was a massive issue. That wasn't just about slavery but also land and federal power.
1310329878454050816 2020-09-28 05:26:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei @SnacksThanks ... to just slavery is insanity. There were years of issues well documented between the northern and southern states that were causing fractures that eventually exploded. It's like looking at a huge accident on the highway and blaming a pebble.
1310329529366245376 2020-09-28 05:24:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei @SnacksThanks No I've never said they didn't like or endorse slavery. The democrat party had most of it's issues centered around pro slavery amendments at the time, this is history I wouldn't dispute it, however, to ignore the vast ground of issues that were causing problems to boil it down...
1310328972316520448 2020-09-28 05:22:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei @SnacksThanks You're correct here however see former tweet that disputes the reason for secession. The battle was even started when large chunks of land were federalized. That's what sparked it.
1310328547886522368 2020-09-28 05:20:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Alt_ius_plebei It doesn't matter because of the national numbers. Those were still elites. It was mainly caused by the federalization of land, the suppression of ownership without due process or recompense, and the injunctive overreach of then President Lincoln. Slavery was a part tho.

1310257679965716480 2020-09-28 00:39:08 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I never said Biden is a commie. Learn to read.
1310257399987449856 2020-09-28 00:38:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @AdamJKingston No. It's not because I support trump, it's because I don't think he's the Fking devil dude. If someone said biden said that I'd hard doubt that as well. That statement is so ridiculously super villain levels of evil it takes the most TDS people to believe it.
1310254957879156742 2020-09-28 00:28:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lmao  #1 not trump #2 so ridiculously over the top you'd have to be a drool monkey to believe it.

1310253802163826690 2020-09-28 00:23:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> 3
1310252667239763968 2020-09-28 00:19:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Also I don't think anyone left or right would think of trump and insecure in the same sentence.
1310252229534785537 2020-09-28 00:17:29 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lemme see that recording bucko. Link me the sauce.
1310251903511441409 2020-09-28 00:16:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The rich? The cares act went to businesses, not just the insanely rich. The tax cuts were mainly focused around the center, not the top. I doubt anyone can or has numerated the benefits as that would be insanely difficult.
1310251060364062720 2020-09-28 00:12:50 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @ArchivedGoodies Yeah tho honestly I disagree with trump naming them WS. That was a group of pro american patriots who the media labeled WS. I think he's more wise to that now tho than he was when he was just running for president
1310250440450215941 2020-09-28 00:10:22 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Yes the US has a mixed economy. This is known. Trump's moves are far more capitalistic and nationalistic which is why they work. A pure capitalistic system wouldn't care about outsourcing and trump does. He cares more about the US citizens than billionaires.
1310249722423046144 2020-09-28 00:07:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 @AdamJKingston How many of those people are dead? I said no death, not no sickness. I have covid, or had it, I was in the hospital (I was forced to go) and I feel fine now. I felt like crap for about a week and got over it
1310249096721043456 2020-09-28 00:05:02 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 I don't brain let, I'm a biology student  and as such I have some level of actual understanding in this. AKA I can and do have an expert opinion here
1310248766448910338 2020-09-28 00:03:43 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Nah fam you're commies up north. 1 foot in the door doesn't mean you're outside.
1310248566808403971 2020-09-28 00:02:56 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> You live in Canada. No wonder your "conservative" views are insanely left. You're not even voter so honestly idc what you think about Trump. 2 peace prize nominations, valor awards from kosovo, bringing back 1m jobs and factories in 3 years. I think trump knows what he's doing.
1310247830959710208 2020-09-28 00:00:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @AdamJKingston @MichaelRyan72  https://t.co/81InnNbfFz
1310247434010779648 2020-09-27 23:58:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 Yes the trump admins directions saved millions. I agree. The issue is not that however, it's smart determent. Keep away from the old and infirmed and voila no death. Would be about the same numbers you'd see with flu.
1310246745343918080 2020-09-27 23:55:41 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72  https://t.co/3ajfvr4pOp
1310246017174966272 2020-09-27 23:52:48 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I said his party is commies. AoC, Illian Omar, Bernie, etc. They're commies bro. They're avowed commies. They literally have memberships in groups. They control biden. Biden can barely string together a sentence.
1310245388809433089 2020-09-27 23:50:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Np people have been dragging his a** for months for not naming antifa. Even in your article he didn't do that specifically till early this month. The riots have been going on for almost 4 months now
1310245048127074305 2020-09-27 23:48:57 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Covid is not an issue. You are being lied to by the left. No one with decent health will die from covid. It has less that 1% mortality in anyone below 60 and only 6% mortality within groups with NO comorbidity
1310244384005210113 2020-09-27 23:46:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MikeKraEYEam @PpollingNumbers GoP? Homie... Antifa... They are literal commies. They state it proudly. They are leftists and marxists. You can't "no u" this 1
1310244068429971458 2020-09-27 23:45:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MichaelRyan72 Lol Biden is not a good man and his party is literally commies and you're an idiot if you think otherwise  https://t.co/UpCM3A40X3
1310243654624108547 2020-09-27 23:43:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I stand corrected tho you still need to correct yourself in your statement trump's not condemned any violence on the right side. He has, now and when he first ran. This is well known.
1310242946332020736 2020-09-27 23:40:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Name all the locations he has held rallys. I can wait a minute and I can bet it won't take the full character limit. He didn't even want to go to kenosha. He only did because trump went and him refusing to made his polls drop and people started getting mad at him.
1310242430319460355 2020-09-27 23:38:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Trump has denounced the violence and even named white supremacists, has biden named antifa? No? Just nebulous violence? The same violence from the same group he literally fundraised for? The same org BLM that gets it's money from ActBlue which is part of the DNC?
1310241706629980160 2020-09-27 23:35:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @MikeKraEYEam @PpollingNumbers Or alternatively  https://t.co/el0ogMtoRX

1310241079363469314 2020-09-27 23:33:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Oh November gonna be funny AF
1310240886844846080 2020-09-27 23:32:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Guess you missed the old clip circling around now where Biden called the troops idiots, or maybe missed the news his son has taken money from a believe 3 foreign nations, and his administration literally put together russiagate to attempt a coup? Patriot? No you're a traitor. 🇺🇸
1310240273616662528 2020-09-27 23:29:58 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Ya boi biden hasn't left his basement, has backed violent riots, and has an amazingly terrible track record.  Trump's group has massive enthusiasm, trump's done a LOT for the country, kept most of his promises before even his second term, and people love him (they chant it)
1310239502808444929 2020-09-27 23:26:55 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @PpollingNumbers These polls are worthless. People all over the world (who can't even vote in the US) can vote on the poll lol still 66/25 oooof
1310238469914947590 2020-09-27 23:22:48 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Vapecob @OrwellNGoode I wouldn't say it was cool or real. The guy wasn't a CC scientist, he was the head of an observatory so not his field and not mine since I study biology but we had a 6 hour back and forth not really getting anywhere. I got him to admit critical shortage of oil was BS at least
1310237224407982082 2020-09-27 23:17:51 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The one thing I wonder is which would be more fair to TheStrokedOutJokah? @OpticDecay is older than @ItsStillRealBro I think and has more health issues but optic is a giant.

1310088718976344064 2020-09-27 13:27:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Gyro and helicopters are the absolute worst thing for flight tho. There are I think 8 tilts of critical failure and are bad for like wind turbulence. The sleek aircraft design with VTOL is much more acceptable.

1309123285792235522 2020-09-24 21:31:28 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Lol it was an abuse of power when the Democrats used the nuclear option to make it a simple majority to appoint. It's an abuse of power when they say they will stack the court. Impeaching without a criminal charge is an abuse of power.  Appointing a judge while your @POTUS is not

Ofc peaceful protestors don't get arrested, it's the violent ones that do. The money he helped raise will get these cop killers out of prison.
1308978018862485504 2020-09-24 11:54:13 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @JoeBiden You realize the money you and kamala helped raise via #ActBlue for #BLACKLivesMatter will be used to pay the bail for these cop killers. Just a little thought, not that idiots would bother with those annoying little facts.

The commies want the mayor to resign because his successor is an antifa member and a fellow commie. Wheeler isn't, he's weak.

1307011367195475970 2020-09-19 01:39:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> These terrorists seem to like setting things on fire. Makes you wonder how many, if not all, of the #ClimateChange fires were manmade when literally hundreds of arsonist commies have been arrested so far.
1306952835964100608 2020-09-18 21:46:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I am a FMC so you'd have to back that up.

It's not like we are stupid enough to not see @Twitter is already an arm of the #Democrats.   If I support Kyle they ban me for glorifying violence but thousands on here celebrate dead #Police. The fix is in. We know.

I think people like brad eat the fake news BS on CNN and MSNBC and stuff and believe it.

1304255740786413568 2020-09-11 11:09:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Yeah twitter is pro pedo. You have to be super careful about that. I run with pedo hunter communities. Seen a lot of friends fall. Big F for her tho. Also LGBT might not ALL be pedo inclusive but it IS becoming that you it needs to be fought.

1304181964111597569 2020-09-11 06:16:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Brad here can't make a valid point against the claims I made so hes literally just responding to everyone BUT me and addressing my bf who went to sleep about an hour ago XD

They love blacks out screaming BLM while they kill people, especially trump supporters, and burn down cities. They hate society and America. Mark my words They will do something profoundly stupid on 9/11 I feel it in my bones
1304174528822685699 2020-09-11 05:46:52 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @BradEllisPiano Its not looking good bud. I am a tiny 1K user and I am ratio you with every tweet. Maybe you should bring more crybaby from your camp.

1304167277118578688 2020-09-11 05:18:03 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> The idiot lexicon grows. Now bigotsplaining and thugsplaining are a thing LOL
1304166675080712193 2020-09-11 05:15:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Here is a little insight for people too stupid to realize... trump hated McCain, most replublicans disliked him, AND his own electorate as well. You can dislike someone in military without hating every vet. Amazing I know.
1304166182816276482 2020-09-11 05:13:42 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> &gt;"This is a lie" (In same tweet) "But it did happen"
1304165952981028864 2020-09-11 05:12:48 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> "our own eyes and ears" ok link video or recording of him saying these things. REALLY BTFO me because literally no one I know has heard these recording and I am sure we would all love to hear.
1304165626735452167 2020-09-11 05:11:30 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Now that I'm done dunking on the spergs you brough to the dance. He signed adjustments into it that increased funding decreased wait times, and expanded choice. You've done nothing to take away from my point thus far.
1304164856669626375 2020-09-11 05:08:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> LOL that was tame. Give me some time and I'll make you really regret getting into this.
1304164099048312835 2020-09-11 05:05:26 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> So its likely the same trash that is attempting to normalize pedophilia and cross dressing 9 year olds strip teasing for weirdos. In that case I really dont care.

By chasing them instead of talking you force them higher and RN you're the monster you see in others.

1302083788760023040 2020-09-05 11:19:01 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> War and violence almost always backfires. In my study of history I can not even think of a war that didn't cause untold amounts of backlash.   When you take away reason and debate even if you feel the person is unsaveable you literally take away all reason for them to step back
1302080801954312195 2020-09-05 11:07:09 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Until they commit acts or terror then they're not terrorists. If you carpet bomb a lot of muslims in a suspected ISIS camp do you think the surviros go "I'll never be ISIS" or  "death to america!"?   Extremism breeds extremism and violence bring violence. Use reason.
1302077018926972929 2020-09-05 10:52:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @CoppIsaiah Like if you took his example and maybe a kid is out irl shtposting and waving an isis flag to spook some mericans or maybe a new recruit like the idiots in the UK who joined isis.

How do you know you're not punching an edgy larper or someone lied to and can be talked out by bearing truth? You don't, you deem them subhuman and want them hurt
1302072340696702979 2020-09-05 10:33:32 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> According to my 8 points I am a capitalism fascist but I'm not a Nazi or disregard truth or logic.   That aside again that's what a Nazi would say about a new. You've selected a group of people and without knowing a thing more dehumanised and deemed worthy to die. How're u diff?
1302071080891428864 2020-09-05 10:28:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @They_Live_1988 Yeah super long lol
1302065597312892928 2020-09-05 10:06:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> So you think a Nazi will openly deny truth even if presented it. You know a Nazi would say exactly what you say about them but about the Jews. That they're bad faith and actively deceive. You're openly sharing their most radical ideals. you just paint that ideal on them instead.
1302064708804112384 2020-09-05 10:03:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Mi__General Trust me I know. I'm almost at #ANCAP levels but not all the way on board. I am very pro NAP. I think the soft power of capitalism paired with extremely small gov is ideal.
1302063964759748615 2020-09-05 10:00:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Hey @TwitterSupport why is it if I support Kyle Rittenhouse who clearly defended himself which is easily found via videos on your site and NOT found guilty yet a bannable actions but I see lots of people praising the Portland shooter and their accounts are untouched?
1302062741675532290 2020-09-05 09:55:23 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I know people who are not yet breaking the laws AKA advocating violence or actively causing it are not so far gone they can't be brought back through discussion which is a point you've still not touched. Are your ideas and reason so weak you can't argue? Is your truth so lacking?
1302061027635400705 2020-09-05 09:48:34 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 Oh that's not the NZ guy. I was like 10 when that happened. I don't know him no.
1302059260382269440 2020-09-05 09:41:33 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 Idk it was banned throughout the world. I never read it but I heard of the event. I never heard he was a Nazi.
1302058985839824898 2020-09-05 09:40:27 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TonkaSaud @VictorLicata1 They literally sell the organs. CCP is doing living dissection and selling the body parts of less desirables.
1302058642150232069 2020-09-05 09:39:06 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TonkaSaud @VictorLicata1  https://t.co/81utjWxptt
1302058197323337728 2020-09-05 09:37:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 The NZ shooting? They banned it everywhere. I have no idea what that guys motives were. I know he said subscribe to pewdiepie so I doubt much of what he said was serious.
1302057738319601664 2020-09-05 09:35:30 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @TonkaSaud @VictorLicata1 Yep look it up. It was a big issue in the Philippines and Japan wanted to ban it
1302056804151631872 2020-09-05 09:31:47 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 @TonkaSaud In Foxx 10 a building so plagued by it's workers jumping to kill themselves that they had to build multilevel netting to keep their slaves from commiting not alive
1302056036451454976 2020-09-05 09:28:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @JesseTheBody14 @_Lunar_Lunacy_ @Ronald_Soye_lll @DashingChrisBey  https://t.co/7NqYJBsOQw
1302054975376437248 2020-09-05 09:24:31 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Not capitalism. That's just war mongering. Trump for example wants to end wars. Capitalism promote trade. You trade good for good and it acts as a soft power. It actively demote war.
1302054325359751168 2020-09-05 09:21:56 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 I'm not US so we don't get the same media and tbh half the time your media is lying and saying people like patriot prayer is a "white nationalist" group. I'm sure that came as a surprise to their PoC members
1302053923008786432 2020-09-05 09:20:20 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> V- wants to be able to open jars
1302053665289756672 2020-09-05 09:19:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> I've not heard of any mass attacks like that but who knows. Most nazis whore real don't care about jews, they just want to be away from them and other races.    As for the 2nd they say they're commies, want commie stuff. They're commies imo.
1302052802655596544 2020-09-05 09:15:53 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @SpookyWebtrash I could use that core but not those arms/legs
1302052607993819136 2020-09-05 09:15:07 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Capitalism actively kills no one. Everyone is their own arbiter. This is not the same in communism OR socialism (Nazism) as the state is your arbiter.
1302052008019603456 2020-09-05 09:12:44 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Exactly. They aren't a threat. RN commies are because they're killing and burning down people and causing mass chaos. I want THOSE ones arrested. Klled if necessary but I try to reach idiots to show them they're wrong on here rather than treat them as unsaveable.
1302051356358963200 2020-09-05 09:10:08 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Communism 100m dead Nazism 11m (Both contested) Either case both are stupid, dangerous, and unworkable BUT the people who think on these can be fixed.
1302050495197048844 2020-09-05 09:06:43 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Still doesn't address my point. Putting battery acid into your mouth is stupid, eating lead paint is stupid. The differing levels of stupid don't justify kicking a toddler in the face when your can educate them. Even literal commies and Nazis can reform before they get violent
1302049666125778945 2020-09-05 09:03:25 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> You're going to be a super muscle girl?
1302049355487162368 2020-09-05 09:02:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @messiah_of_kek @xPunishedGutsx He's being a pansy. If he gets sick he gets super melodramatic
1302049176390336512 2020-09-05 09:01:29 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> None of this counters my point. Both are stupid, violent, dangerous even but if they cause no harm why not spell it out why they are dumb and show them the light like God would have us rather than cast them to the demons? Violence begets violence. Words and ideas can sway.
1302047222234853376 2020-09-05 08:53:43 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> So do commies but I don't want them hurt or murdered unless they actively push for that OR do it. We have laws and police and stuff. We are not mindless apes with no sense of reserve. Once you can deem an idea worthy of violence then how long till your ideas become bad?
1302046361542627329 2020-09-05 08:50:18 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 @xPunishedGutsx I know that nathan guy. He's the one that punched that moldy headed commie right?  https://t.co/Kw3hDPMc20
1302044420313882625 2020-09-05 08:42:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> 100m was not enough. At 200m true communism will be achieved!
1302044112930115586 2020-09-05 08:41:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> If they actively advocated violence tho that's illegal and they should be arrested. Same for commies, same for pedos. If pedos want to advocate ppl should peacefully counter protest them and if 1 harms a kid beat them to stop them and get the police.
1302044111416045570 2020-09-05 08:41:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Bad example because I'm part of a pedo hunter community but that aside violent action, no. Peaceful resistance yes.   The 2 examples are not the same. Pedos want an action that causes harm. I broke through your list and showed none was harmful.i
1302042281168564224 2020-09-05 08:34:05 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Yeah I prefer my historical sites turned and r@ped and turned into productive stuff rather than a mass of shanties
1302041671014776832 2020-09-05 08:31:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Them. I'd try to get them to see they're insanely stupid and explain why they're being insanely stupid and failing that I'd call them a name and walk away. If they got violent or threaten I'd then want action against them3
1302041669097926656 2020-09-05 08:31:39 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Wear nazi symbol And an ethnostate is the most active thing they advocate and they want a white only land. Every race has a homeland except white so why is white having a home alone so bad?  That aside nothing you mentioned is specific violence. If I saw a commie I wouldn't hit2
1302041666954592258 2020-09-05 08:31:38 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Full disclosure: I want all commie yeeted.   That aside from what I want, on an adult level as a member of a society we have to be humans and not animals. Ideas must fight ideas, speech fight speech. You advocate violence against the following:  Ppl to venerate a dead person1
1302039113672122370 2020-09-05 08:21:30 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @VictorLicata1 Yeah autocorrect. Took like 20 min to scroll down to find where we left off lol.

1302037521728184329 2020-09-05 08:15:10 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @QuackSensei Idk seems like a very UwU time lolol
1302037023931461632 2020-09-05 08:13:11 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Tf? What's milk carton has to do with racism?
1302036369632616449 2020-09-05 08:10:35 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @lovetomyloops Lol it was a special time when I was a small user, only had like 68 followers at the time.
1302035805196648450 2020-09-05 08:08:21 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @The_KeJo @VictorLicata1 @xPunishedGutsx Lol well I didn't mind the debate but it was 2am so I passed out lol
1301945597587591168 2020-09-05 02:09:54 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Just to a grouper QandA. No one there had a Nazi flag. The guys were all super nice and we'll dressed and polite.
1301945183748186113 2020-09-05 02:08:15 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> 99% of the time they're trolls trying to get reactionary fools pissed off.
1301944786153340940 2020-09-05 02:06:40 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @Spike_Spiegel97 @VictorLicata1 @xPunishedGutsx That's a mega sad thing. I hate that so much.
1301944667270000641 2020-09-05 02:06:12 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Explain what a Nazi is. In detail. What does it take to be a Nazi. I've been called a Nazi and I'm not even white.
1301943863456739328 2020-09-05 02:03:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Everytime you see "nazis" at these things they have brand new flags and they still have cresses in them and the media is conveniently right there. You might want to actually pay attention to who is holding the strings.
1301943398543372289 2020-09-05 02:01:09 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> No. Not against citizens. Even with these antifa commies I consider terrorists I'd rather they be arrested and put in jail or shipped to Cuba like other terrorists. That's how you do things in america. You're not the judge jury and executioner no more than POTUS can be.
1301942676699439106 2020-09-05 01:58:17 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Who should tell him the Nazis doesn't exist after world war 2? Should I?
1301940669708201985 2020-09-05 01:50:19 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Their line is in your name. That's like me wearing a swaztika and saying "oh I'm not a Nazi"
1301940277993787393 2020-09-05 01:48:45 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> No just in a party full of them me "punch a Nazi"

1301939987244634112 2020-09-05 01:47:36 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Crass racism? You mean the completely dominated sports industry? The affirmative action that gets PoC jobs who maybe lacking from a white job applicant? The college's that discriminate and accept and deny based off race? Or the 19 whites shot by police vs the 9 blacks? So racist

1300639771056721920 2020-09-01 11:41:00 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> @American4Love @BGOnTheScene @donwinslow Jacob Blake was a pedophile who raped a 14 year old girl, the same girl he was assaulting when the cops rolled in. Fk off pedo defender.
1300639514419802113 2020-09-01 11:39:59 +0800 <FuroridaNoMaya> Fk off with the peaceful protest BS. Literally EVERYONE knows BLM and antifa are terrorists now. A murder followed by dancing in the park and a speech laughing about it made it clear to all but the stupidest people.

She was some lefty who wanted to spy and went in with her bf blessing and they just used her. She went on to write an article I believe. I think she had red hair or blonde?
