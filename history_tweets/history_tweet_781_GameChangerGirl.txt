Trudeau isn’t hard enough to lead He had feelings getting in the way of the logic most males have  Thatcher was rational and didn’t allow feelings to take control and interfere with her reasoning   Women are ruled by feelings. Men by logic

1303664026904416257 2020-09-09 19:58:19 +0800 <GameChangerGirl> @PrimalPolitical Boris got himself a really bad deal starting his tenure with this Covid issue. It’d be the same for any leader though. They can’t do the right thing as it’s catch22. He hasn’t had a chance to do what he does yet. Hard to judge him so far  Oh and there’s no DM
