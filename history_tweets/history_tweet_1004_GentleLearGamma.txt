1341418530370183168 2020-12-23 00:21:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @chiquitodorado Cool. Well, one small tip: when making scrambled eggs, it's better to crack the eggs directly into the pot/pan and then scramble them. Whisking or beating them in a bowl beforehand dilutes them and it causes the eggs to lose flavor. Make sure that the pan is nonstick.

1340340819694395394 2020-12-20 00:58:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_ThomasGWhite_ Like if you cut up 19 apples into peices and put them together a different way, you'd still have 19 full apples. The other method is theoretical and imaginary. It should never be used in real life equations or used to solve problems.
1340340260534939651 2020-12-20 00:56:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_ThomasGWhite_ That confuses me. That goes against basic math. If that's true, then what's the point of having mathmatical rules or even physics

1340334189384781826 2020-12-20 00:32:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman @WickedForces21 Mr. Windman. It is an old anime, but I highly reccomend the anime Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) if  you have not seen it. It draws very interesting parrelels to our current world and what were to happen if we water down human nature. Plus there's psychic powers. 10/10
1340333201269673985 2020-12-20 00:28:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RekietaMedia This is the new normal. we need to accept this and embrace our new mask culture. We can never go back, unless there's some sort of mass rebellion. But humans are too simple minded to do that. Right? üëÄ

But you can be prejudiced against people based on religion or other factors not named skin color. It's like my prejudice against nihilistic post-modernists who believe that 1+1 = 69

Instead of a vaccine that uses mRNA that can cause serious side effects or even death in 21% of those who receive it? F^CK THE FDA
1340133836974395395 2020-12-19 11:16:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD @hivethebastard Same.

They ARE NOT allowed to do so, by the constitution. And yet we do nothing about it. Because they know we can't do anything about it without risking innocent lives.
1339434157315940354 2020-12-17 12:56:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Honestly, even if he was, (most likely) I still enjoy celebrating Christmas in the winter season. It's a tradition at this point, and people do not seem to mind. I certainly don't. So if it isn't broke, why fix it? Just say he was born when he was born, and still keep tradition.
1339433436201816066 2020-12-17 12:53:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanielMadison78 @cIemmie He chose the edgelord path because the other option is a lie.
1339432555817422849 2020-12-17 12:49:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanielMadison78 @cIemmie A woman's correct pronoun is she. A man's is he. This is first grade shit.
1339432233619365888 2020-12-17 12:48:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @golvio @cIemmie They already have rights. They deserve respect, but they need to act like they can handle criticism and facts of life. Elon is a push over and a fucking nightmare of a human being.
1339431662061547520 2020-12-17 12:46:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cIemmie The pronoun game is absolutely cringe(especially the tumblr made up ones). And Elon Musk being a hypocrite is nothing new. I already don't like the whole catgirl thing and bullshit he spews. So this is just par for the course.

1339428673720627201 2020-12-17 12:34:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FED_BUNDY @lporiginalg Nope. People can say dudette if they want, and they can accept it, but the "official" term is dudine. Kinda why no one uses it. üòÇ
1339409294006120453 2020-12-17 11:17:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lost_Pause_ This is what happens when companies don't allow freedom of speech. Comply or get out. Soon it will be comply or die. I'm not joking. If you give a damn about this, might want to call out twitch on their bullsh^t while we think they're still listening.
1339407053815734272 2020-12-17 11:08:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DesertHermitTC @Lost_Pause_ Your sentence pains me. Unironically means seriously (hence that word is stupid) and "Literally" already gets your point accross.

1339391590058618884 2020-12-17 10:06:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpicyKeo @hpmckringleber1 @DanielH3nz @TheHinduDindu People become more closeminded as they get older. Having kids opens that mind again due to the nature of kids and a parent's connection. "Kids say the darndest things". Yeah, but they reward you with a new sense of wo der and excitement that is limited with being single.
1339391246780018689 2020-12-17 10:05:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpicyKeo @hpmckringleber1 @DanielH3nz @TheHinduDindu You guys are still fighting about this?  Oof. Both being single and in a relationship with children have benefits. Being single resonates with financial freedom and freedom of choice with little collaboration. Having a family and children rewards one with the joys of parenthood.

1339127425909858306 2020-12-16 16:37:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @michaelsen158 I don't think so. Voter ID seems simple to impliment. And those who hack and create fake IDs can try and then take forever replicating them. While they do that, we can vote honestly and have freedom of choice.

They weren't on the right side, but they still fought like hell for their beliefs and died like true soldiers. Anyone who gives his life with his courage and will on the line deserves recognition.

So I wouldn't say that his ideas were the worst for the country at that time. Yes, slavery is wrong and terrible. But I don't think it is fair to judge morals of that era with how we think about that stuff now.

The test is super inaccurate with a 97% false positive rate, and even if you are sick, the likelihood that it actually was the bio weapon from china is about 1/10.  The liklihood that it was "SARS-COV2" or "Covid-19" is 0/infinity.

1338700144171212802 2020-12-15 12:19:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AEGENigma This happens occasionally. My guess is that it may have something to due with the prostate or the urinary tract. Ever since I recovered from a UTI, it happens more frequently than before. It does hurt, and it may be a good thing to talk to your doctor about if it persists.

1338362115770507265 2020-12-14 13:56:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mrsja3ger I will never understand the whole cosmic shit.  So you're a different alignment in birth time and the stars  or whatever.  WHO CARES.
1338361512101081089 2020-12-14 13:53:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Garett824 I actually like Shinon a lot. Yes,  he is a racist asshole. But I like asshole characters for the most part, but he actually cares about rolf and his student's success.
1338356344307462146 2020-12-14 13:33:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DialD4Death @Nux_Taku That's awful
1338355884951539713 2020-12-14 13:31:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PepeMatter @AddVibes Or the opposite way around, since his colon wistled the chinese national anthem.
1338355100113367041 2020-12-14 13:28:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Every damn day. I get the feeling it's going to be a long and perilous 5 years.

1338344359863967746 2020-12-14 12:45:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @maliemoe432 I know that pain. I work in a retail job where if I speak up or refuse to wear my mask I may get fired. (I try to not wear it when I can.) I want to get a different job, but it may be the same thing. Sadly, there's not much a single man like me can do. I feel powerless, bro.
1338309117430083585 2020-12-14 10:25:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lrihendry Already had it, got over it in a week. It's not that bad unless you have extreme health conditions to begin with. Plus we have a cure for the damn thing so I see it as a non-issue.

1338293422109696005 2020-12-14 09:23:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 He does. He also has the morals of a demon that needs to be purged with holy water.
1338292005810675712 2020-12-14 09:17:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 I've always cared about policy/individual ideas and commitment to the people over party affiliation. The two party system (we have it, don't pretend we don't) is a sham and a lie, just so people can fight about stupid shit and not take action for the people who need it.
1338220561210732554 2020-12-14 04:33:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @h_nyoro @poochy_lily Lovely! üòç

1338219918739824641 2020-12-14 04:31:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing No. Its the fault of the CCP, Bill gates, the marxist revolution AND Sephiroth.

1338028069848801280 2020-12-13 15:48:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ I just found out that covid 19 doesn't exist. You're right. I just wanted to let you know cause I am another who will fight for freedom from global tyranny.

1338008371102945288 2020-12-13 14:30:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Houkago_Jimtime It incouraged people to stay home and not embrace the outside world like real thinking adults.

1338005969779953666 2020-12-13 14:20:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Emerald_mp3 The funny thing is, "insane" is actually a legal term, not a psychological one.
1338005514962284544 2020-12-13 14:19:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman Ok, so I asked him today, and he is not 100% pro vax. He says it depends on the specific vaccine, and if it is proven to have no side effects, he might take it.  He's along my lines - sorta in the middle. I'm just going to die before I willingly take the covid vaccine
1338005080948215808 2020-12-13 14:17:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ Being forced to comply and having no Avenue to fight back. Also being unable to stand with someone against this powerful oppression the nwo has created.  Note: I started to believe in the nwo only a few weeks ago.

1338003959060029441 2020-12-13 14:12:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @goukuzaruu You know, Shanna is my favorite of all Elibe pegasus knights. One quote made it so(paraphrased): "You're too tense. Eat well, sleep well, laugh well. Isn't that all there is to success in life?" Best way to start living your life. More to it than this, but this core is key.

1338002920315514880 2020-12-13 14:08:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AndrewAnalytics Silver is key. If you go for only the gold, you turn out as pale as rusted tin, in the end.
1338002487253602304 2020-12-13 14:07:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Vonpure Only the older generation and people like myself and Yoshikage Kira.
1338002188002598912 2020-12-13 14:05:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChristophPolka @SydneyLWatson You don't need to do that. Have some confidence, do what you love, and the people who love you will come to you. Even then, putting yourself out there means you need to brace the wind blowing against you and face life's issues head on. Don't give up. üëç
1338000849273020417 2020-12-13 14:00:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheRealLinkKing I voted FE 12 because it is the most challenging gameplay wise with a twist of AI manipulation. Not skill overload like fates or stat inflation BS.  Plus, the rewards for getting through higher difficulty actually MEAN something! Story is less important, but FE 4 is winning.
1337999788973977604 2020-12-13 13:56:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 Not a no, good enough for me.

1337920351486021632 2020-12-13 08:40:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman I don't know. He says he normally trusts vaccines, but this one concerns him. I personally used to be pro-vax myself, until 4 months ago.
1337858921457995781 2020-12-13 04:36:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman @RekietaMedia He saw the buls palsy thing online and said it's quite suspicious. I don't know about taking it.

Doesn't matter how much tax money is wasted or if police aren't dealing with real crimes that could lead to real death. Just obey and everything is fine, or are you a bIgOT!?!?11?
1337463574206296067 2020-12-12 02:25:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 There. Just subbed
1337461592619880449 2020-12-12 02:17:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Pfft
1337438788667191298 2020-12-12 00:47:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrwellNGoode Believe it or not I've seen stupider
1337438356075122694 2020-12-12 00:45:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc The one that's in the trash bin
1337437957733703680 2020-12-12 00:43:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Oh man. They're doing the thing. Well, animals are animals I guess. (I have no funny joke for this)
1337435735373336583 2020-12-12 00:35:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MajorPatriot @AddVibes K.  Oh. Should I get popcorn
1337400944011644928 2020-12-11 22:16:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Mlickles Game awards are a goddamn joke
1337400623684349953 2020-12-11 22:15:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @govkristinoem GEEEE. I wonder WHYYYYYYYYYYY. Oh well. MoRE mAskS!!!1!1!1
1337398705545240576 2020-12-11 22:07:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JMG_PartyBean Not bad at all!   Never thought I'd be jones'n for a jojo not named Jolyne
1337292093883117571 2020-12-11 15:04:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LittleGerman12 @SydneyLWatson @WatchChad No, because we are still dividing ourselves, open to attack from another unified power. It isn't even the beat option strategically.
1337291717557559296 2020-12-11 15:02:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Andrea37681961 @russmerne I know this because I have read scientific studies that prove no causation between vaccines and autism
1337271786761752577 2020-12-11 13:43:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I don't even know the answer to this one. Still trying to find out, too
1337270126371069953 2020-12-11 13:36:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Blasco60890163 @androidA20K @kyuotto @moeko_peach why IS Gura so popular? I'm not big into Vtubers but I'm really curious now. If someone broke the record in 3 weeks to a million subs, there's something there that's impressive beyond a doubt
1337268551149817856 2020-12-11 13:30:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @chuchumcgoo Yes, it is funny. Why? Because it's a game that's over 20 years old and it's the darth vador daddy of video game spoilers. Everyone knows it. Jokes and humor can be made about anything and everything. So quit whining.
1337267132317495296 2020-12-11 13:25:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MikeyCowboysP1 @Samsora_ The only thing I'm mad about is the music cease and desist. The rest is either not that bad or something I don't care for. Now the free melee thing is shitty. That is... yuck.
1337266854130282496 2020-12-11 13:23:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Rylade475 @Samsora_ YUFFIE SPIRIT YESSSSSS

1337265902513958917 2020-12-11 13:20:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman @LAVIDAPRADA I forget who this one was, but she was my favorite back in the day  https://t.co/QMEnYtmG9N
1337265533952139264 2020-12-11 13:18:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Alice_Alucard New eyeballs, who dis?
1337265266070327300 2020-12-11 13:17:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman It can persist for years. It's rarely permanent, but this nearly proves that this experimental vaccine is bent on modifying DNA. HCQ and zinc all the way, baby!
1337255953658486784 2020-12-11 12:40:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PhishCaek @DendyReadman Lovely! Not enough Panty love out there....  Wait no, not what I meant! Get your head out of the gutter, guys!
1337255665836888064 2020-12-11 12:39:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DaTacoLord @ryntai Among us was made in 2018.
1337255281739395074 2020-12-11 12:37:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Phil_Cebu599 @MissZi_Zi My apologies. I just care about the world and don't want to see it fall to ruin because of some 600 greedy assholes.

1337249232747720704 2020-12-11 12:13:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Phil_Cebu599 @MissZi_Zi I know. But the fall of free-thinking countries that are not 3rd world will impact you as well.
1337244662302695426 2020-12-11 11:55:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Phil_Cebu599 @MissZi_Zi Because PEOPLE WANT TO CONTROL HOW WE THINK. How do you not realize this yet?
1337243033570570242 2020-12-11 11:49:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fe_paint @Gregster1998 Yes. On the outside his muscles are the only good part. His face is ugly and he is intellectually scarred and has little intelligence at all. HOWEVER. His heart and moral struggle makes him a great character worth caring for. As they say, beauty on the inside is what counts.
1337241969525989377 2020-12-11 11:45:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SydneyLWatson @WatchChad Sydney, for once I disagree with you. Do this, and it gives them leverage and power. United we are strong, and can tackle this issue. Divided, we are weak.
1337239968675221504 2020-12-11 11:37:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fe_paint @Gregster1998 That's the opposite of a himbo
1337238606268739585 2020-12-11 11:31:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mana_chan__ @MasterEnex Quick! Someone draw lewd stuff about this! Wait, nevermind. I'm late to the crowd. (But I ship it though)
1337235208559599617 2020-12-11 11:18:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @lero_ray @_cdlum @OpaluVA The extra (yellow) stamina meter boost went down a tad, too!
1337235063717695493 2020-12-11 11:17:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Eeeee55423005 @_cdlum @FemboyDullahan @OpaluVA See, the stamina was yellow. Implying he got an extra ring of stamina from sleeping in a water-down bed or from a food effect. Therefore, it is 1/8 of stamina lost. Meaning he has another seven to go - 1 to go places with Zelda, and the rest for some fun.
1337233874141786112 2020-12-11 11:12:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Alice_Alucard I don't get it. Wait... is this like a robot bunny girl or something?  Probably gonna try to take over humanity if it is
1337232564176756740 2020-12-11 11:07:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @insomniacSXUL Doesn't matter. Adapt and overcome.
1337231547997560832 2020-12-11 11:03:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 It deserved only like.... 1 at most. These awards are mostly for the benefit of game journalists.
1337222627438551043 2020-12-11 10:28:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FOXudon0083 @CatNameIsShadow I want that pizza
1337222528226439169 2020-12-11 10:27:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatNameIsShadow R word.... realism? Kidding. I think I know what word it is...
1337221103261978626 2020-12-11 10:22:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Your son is overrated.
1337220515681988609 2020-12-11 10:19:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Merryweatherey @Lost_Pause_ Game awards are just a sham for jounalists to make themselves happy. Its not for us.
1337220100844376064 2020-12-11 10:18:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheHinduDindu This has ruined my evening.
1337219679862091777 2020-12-11 10:16:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WeTheInevitable @AddVibes Do not be happy for his death. But the punishment for his crime and the fact that none shall be harmed by his hand no longer.
1337217591618777088 2020-12-11 10:08:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TomoeTheNeko Ok the tail is one thing but those socks are 100% awesome

1337216645119561735 2020-12-11 10:04:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CodeMonkeyZ @AddVibes I don't like my governor.  He's ass. Communist Andy Bullshit.

1337214460583419906 2020-12-11 09:55:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jasonheavyb51 That made me chuckle.
1337213137842561026 2020-12-11 09:50:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bhawksfanJAmes @veryfatverysad1 @0Samael @GarbyJooman3 I brought something like this up is because to believe shitty, horrible people like that step mother do not exist is naiive. People can be extremely petty and horrific, that was my whole point. I'm not saying that death threats for loli art is equal to this travesty.
1337212577638735872 2020-12-11 09:48:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bhawksfanJAmes @veryfatverysad1 @0Samael @GarbyJooman3 I will say that I am not comparing it to that. It was the loli thing. However, that too, is horrible and I condemn it with all of my soul. The same to this woman in the email picture. I am not making light of these events by comparing it to something lesser.
1337211491272044544 2020-12-11 09:43:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung I can be spoiled. Complain to me pls
1337211054548463616 2020-12-11 09:42:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Sounds fun
1337210554046427138 2020-12-11 09:40:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LLlama73418750 *He's a man

1337204718888751104 2020-12-11 09:17:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @0Samael @GarbyJooman3 There are people who send death threats to people over fictional drawings. I think this peice of trash exists.
1337203798461321217 2020-12-11 09:13:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus In a fight? Yes. In boobie size? Yes. In a keijo fight? No.
1337201503413669889 2020-12-11 09:04:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 I don't understand the point behind the circle thing here. Could you please break this down for me?
1337200571305091074 2020-12-11 09:00:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @The_Lucbomber They need to wait until march 31 2021 before they actually remove him from the roster

1337199013049880576 2020-12-11 08:54:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus I like her more than Tifa, even though I consider Tifa to be the superior characrer
1337197388470112258 2020-12-11 08:47:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @squidtoond @CrownGamer901 Not yet. He will still be there, but only until march 31, 2021
1337197131086630912 2020-12-11 08:46:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Boomer &gt; Zoomer
1337196819458220032 2020-12-11 08:45:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> As a fan of Final Fantasy, Sephiroth is cool. Not as good as a villain as Kefka or Kuja, but He's a solid pick for a villian to be in smash.
1337190046743617540 2020-12-11 08:18:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ItsukaSiscon @LegalLoliLover1 There are terrible folks with awful veiws on both ends. There's even some debate that the Nazi party were far left, simply because the Nazi party was socialist.
1337189390880296960 2020-12-11 08:16:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SydneyLWatson With what little masculinity I do have, I don't want to get rid of it.
1337188699646386177 2020-12-11 08:13:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tamafries @poochy_lily @JLoTheCholo @spamsatrocity I know you drew it (fantastic work! ‚ù§) but I'm thinking that in-universe it was Ignatz who painted it.
1337186162407071745 2020-12-11 08:03:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Kek.
1337185641973641219 2020-12-11 08:01:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeteLavaDigger Dammit Pete! You're starting to convert me!
1337166520443604994 2020-12-11 06:45:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ You are far braver than I am.
1337166300318224396 2020-12-11 06:44:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus Personally I'd rather be tortured in one of the new concentration camps then fuck any of these (or any male character for that matter, with one exception). However, If I HAD to choose, I'd say garon. At least he can't bind me up with magic  or crush me with appendages.
1337144484648394759 2020-12-11 05:17:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zacmac4297 @TerryforTexas She isn't stupid. She is evil. Those who follow her are stupid
1337143457215881216 2020-12-11 05:13:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sterlinginks @PetiteNicoco EVIL. Those who follow this shit blindly are stupid. The woman herself is evil.
1337142650701541383 2020-12-11 05:10:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheKimersonShow I would just LOVE to see people scream and cry
1337142501589852160 2020-12-11 05:09:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JonComms Dang now I want one! Wait... *looks at calender* üòØ
1337142013716819974 2020-12-11 05:07:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Alice_Alucard I've never liked the idea that a community "belongs" to a set number of people. But if you don't like the stuff, then what are you even there for? Just go do something else
1337141715476631552 2020-12-11 05:06:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TaskLacka The best girl from that show not named Rin is this busty woman.
1337127913645371407 2020-12-11 04:11:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala I love Lysithea. But there are at least 40 characters who deserve a place among the glorious smash roster more than her.
1337127397104214018 2020-12-11 04:09:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PEXYVERSE @Alice_Alucard I'm on the naughty list because I went against the will of the government and the experts. But I am on the nice list too - I stuck to my beliefs and the core values of those who wish for freedom from tyranny.
1337125339428950016 2020-12-11 04:01:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @nlebo_hentai @LabEcchi While the animation itself is well done, that looks extremely painful. Actually 30% of all h^ntai looks painful. Maybe I should just give up
1337124921919594496 2020-12-11 03:59:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman Apologies.

1337123494044323841 2020-12-11 03:54:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LoliChampion The only thing I see wrong with Kyuotto is her attempts at threatening for legal action when she did (or paid for) the tracing of another's work. Believe not what is said, but what is done.
1337122725194854402 2020-12-11 03:51:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tripleafrog_ It's funny because Nintendo isn't as bad as bill gates
1337122390027984910 2020-12-11 03:49:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheSMonroeShow I'm taller than her HAHA!!
1337122067829956608 2020-12-11 03:48:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> God.  Why are people so gullible?
1337121610315272196 2020-12-11 03:46:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Same. I'm never going on instagram. It just sucks too much donkey dick
1337121281733513217 2020-12-11 03:45:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing @PoorlyAgedStuff Damn right. Vic is innocent and there's no proof. Most photo shopped and those against him were terrible terrible people.
1337120518944813062 2020-12-11 03:42:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus I don't. But I gotta stay if I want to commission artists without paying a fortune for fees like on patreon
1337120278145544193 2020-12-11 03:41:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 Yes. Most of them are combined with anxiety or fear of the end of the world
1337119078654341122 2020-12-11 03:36:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @forestminish 1. Ellie from the last of us (dunno why) 2. Hollow Knight (because it's popular) 3. Spyro the Dragon
1337118244847620096 2020-12-11 03:33:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I DO NOW THEY'RE SO CUTE
1337118175146745861 2020-12-11 03:33:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung Yeah... the controls are basically Melee Fox in a game where you want to be jiggly puff
1337117894010867726 2020-12-11 03:32:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeftyUnwoke I know this is off topic, but I saw your profile was of the guy from Angel's Egg. Love that movie, probably one of my favorites in animation.
1337078260216307715 2020-12-11 00:54:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FunnyB0neMan @guguungubane @AshyPrime I don't care that it's stolen. Its not intellectual property
1337076508729487364 2020-12-11 00:47:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Blun_Z And I cannot stand to see you being a poor sap.
1337076357155741697 2020-12-11 00:46:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeftyUnwoke People have a desire to be unique because it gives them purpose. When you find a label that sounds unique and makes you stand out in any way, you latch on to it because your desire to be unique clouds the true nature of your purpose. Basically, you want attention.

The only other two that come to mind are:  The Ghost Stories ENG Dub Konosuba (Still need to see the movie.)

Sometimes differences can be good. We can learn from other cultures, experience different foods, architecture, art, music and dance. But those too, can bring us together.

1336213658611933185 2020-12-08 15:38:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Ocarina of Time link is the best link Lore wise.  Wind waker/phantom hourglass is the best link personality wise. The strongest link is Either Breath of the wild or Link to the past Link. As for character development, it's BotW link hands down.
1336208075544535040 2020-12-08 15:16:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EorzeanPaladin @revolverwing No, It's Lyn from Fire Emblem.
1336205826193809408 2020-12-08 15:07:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NotYourGinger1 Dodge? I have no clue what you mean by that. and I've heard that the, uh "happy time" is not very happy unless you do it with the person you love. And honestly I'd probably just be down to cuddle more than anything.
1336192527456743425 2020-12-08 14:14:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I can't take this joke, so I'm going to have to agree to disagree on this one. Thank you for the explanation.
1336181113119780865 2020-12-08 13:29:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone ? Why is this bad
1336180757329481729 2020-12-08 13:28:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ubercryptid Almonds are better. Try roasting them and having it with oatmeal and blackberries for a good heart breakfast
1336180449698320386 2020-12-08 13:26:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ThatAlex5 It's a soft version of language to describe anyone who works with or around sexual themes or actions. Including artists, animators and porn stars. Everyone needs to be included, I guess.
1336179470047318017 2020-12-08 13:23:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NotYourGinger1 @AdonMadeon I would say I am, but I don't want to risk getting gonorrhea. As long as there is a contract that you can sign that will certify consent and proof of no STDs, I may be willing.
1336178817308700672 2020-12-08 13:20:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @darrend57308120 @OrwellNGoode The task I have is finding the holy grail. No "sex workee" would ever want to do that with me.  Well, except maybe the nun cosplayers.
1336178313434439680 2020-12-08 13:18:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ Frustrating, slightly lonely, but somehow enlightening. I'm learning more and more every day.
1336177303009828864 2020-12-08 13:14:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Honestly your drawing of rosalina gives me more life than I care to admit. No wonder these are popular!
1336175958739603456 2020-12-08 13:09:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheGuilleMan @Gez1313 I'm scared to like NSFW material because people who follow me will see it and I will be seen as nothing more than a stupid perverted weeb with no real value.  But my girl shanoa deserves some love, so I'm liking this one.
1336174881189322758 2020-12-08 13:04:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Do you know where one could find this silhouette?
1336174389835026432 2020-12-08 13:02:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @arcaydes For the uh... stat boosts.  And merging, if you know what I mean.
1336172896616652800 2020-12-08 12:56:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @crossroads_josh I'll believe it when I see it. I've seen the evidence. Lets hope we can see the proof.  Also in court.
1336172002902765568 2020-12-08 12:53:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ConnorEatsPants Congrats. I hope you find fulfillment in your relationship
1336171551423668224 2020-12-08 12:51:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @thechewieone @tridisart It won't end until you MAKE IT END.  Sorry. Just had to get that off my chest
1336171416992043010 2020-12-08 12:51:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman It is an attack on the very language we speak.  The more that people realize this and fight back, the less it happens. This is more than just pure stupidity.
1336161283658436608 2020-12-08 12:10:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Switchpoint Maybe she wears normal clothes for a while?
1336160215805333505 2020-12-08 12:06:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MardFunkNSFW Good job, Mard!
1336152516472549376 2020-12-08 11:35:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @draegwolf @giugabs @SEGAHARDlight But silver ia a cheap ass so I'd go with shadow
1336152301048909825 2020-12-08 11:35:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SEGAHARDlight Blaze and Shadow. Is this even a contest?
1336151283720478720 2020-12-08 11:31:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrwellNGoode Disgusting. Absolutely abhorrent. People want this, though.  Everyone who clamors for the virtual reality or next new fad without taking into account humanity, will clammor for this as their savior.
1336145112376766464 2020-12-08 11:06:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @giugabs May I save this as a walpaper
1336144594896089088 2020-12-08 11:04:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Starthedeity @MajorCreef I don't watch naruto at all. I tried to get into it but it was too much for me. However, people can like what they like. And I will say that this much detication to a cannon pairing is very impressive, even if it isn't perfect.
1336143886016802816 2020-12-08 11:01:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZuccaXerfantes You Identify as a coexisting entity. Or something. I dunno this shit is so stupid you could make it up as you go along and no one would notice the difference.
1336143498945441792 2020-12-08 11:00:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @stevepuma @TheCriticalDri2 Apparently it's now "gender neutral" but it is only that way because it refers to multiple people. And these freaks hate gendered language. So it's an assult on normal people and the language we use. Spanish conjugations must give these fuckers an aneurysm.
1336143049869717505 2020-12-08 10:58:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MarcoStefan6 @TheCriticalDri2 And there you have it. Can't pick and choose pronouns cause you'll have to pick the rest of the sentence too.
1336142048420900866 2020-12-08 10:54:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @justifaizy Who?
1336141682652418050 2020-12-08 10:52:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung My grandmother bought me the DLC because she didn't know it was dlc. She just thought it looked cool. Here I am with torna, struggling to get past the tutorial level, having not olayed Xenoblade Chronicles 2
1336141050260361217 2020-12-08 10:50:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @instrukcje Crying.  Damn.
1336139155227766784 2020-12-08 10:42:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GalaxyKhy And getting raped or tortured? You do you,  crazy- boo.
1336138578775191554 2020-12-08 10:40:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD @ThiccWithaQ Unfortunately they're super crazy. Lets hope they get ran over by a bus or something.
1336138208791449602 2020-12-08 10:39:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KittyShooter1 @BK_girl483 It's a rediculous accessory. It blocks the mouth and nose visually which inpares visual feedback and it causes bacterial build up to fester so you can easily get bacterial pneumonia.
1336137657617932288 2020-12-08 10:36:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blueeyesgraysky @OrwellNGoode Nah. It means you have a clear mind and can remember what simpletons cannot. Not everything new is good.
1336137267073708036 2020-12-08 10:35:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NintendoFanGirl No. Not unless I'm at work.
1336137177353302016 2020-12-08 10:35:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda @NintendoFanGirl Imagine him breathing the snot and bacteria through his mouth after the build up
1336136903062642691 2020-12-08 10:33:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pinestrawwookie @cottonarchist Eh. Not entirely
1336135633362968576 2020-12-08 10:28:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @makkusuoko If Lysithea were in my house, she'd eat her damn vegetables
1336135415405957121 2020-12-08 10:28:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TrailsOfAstra W
1336133160908828672 2020-12-08 10:19:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kittenhotel1 I can't tell what I'm looking at. All I know is its a cat. Shame on whoever thinks its ok to hurt animals. This little fella didn't do anything. He (or she) is in good hands now.
1336132529611550721 2020-12-08 10:16:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DankSeeker228 But... HE DOES LITERALLY NOTHINF
1336132231086174213 2020-12-08 10:15:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jamorbital @LabEcchi I'm going to be hated for retweeting this.
1336131675558993920 2020-12-08 10:13:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Highena2 It's a simple joke. I don't plan to keep it forever. My point is that "folx" is stupid and should be taken as an assult on language.
1336131204672876546 2020-12-08 10:11:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealDannyBenson A lot of people do. For a good reason.
1336110795621535744 2020-12-08 08:50:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 Fatigue. Depression. Realization that your life is scripted by larger powers that no one wants to unite and rebel against. Possibly burn out. I've been there.
1336108598955548672 2020-12-08 08:41:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Highena2 You're cringe.
1336105815338573825 2020-12-08 08:30:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I don't like the genre. Giant robots is not my thing. It gives me anxiety.
1336105392934416386 2020-12-08 08:28:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I'm kinda glad I left FEH before it turned into Mecha-emblem
1336095673138212866 2020-12-08 07:50:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jamie_thompkins @CackleOnceADay @kirstiealley They don't. They shouldn't. The US constitution bars any act against religious freedom, as the government "shall not infringe" upon these God-given rights. Basically, forcing a vaccine beyond someone's religious freedom is unconstitutional.
1336094528634281989 2020-12-08 07:45:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Yup.
1336094376418795522 2020-12-08 07:44:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Me, IRL
1336093951133163520 2020-12-08 07:43:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Oligarchs have too much power. I'm not an economic expert. I do want people to have every opportunity they can to provide. I just don't want society to collapse with a single state of power controling how everyone obtains wealth.
1336092938435239937 2020-12-08 07:39:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealDannyBenson I loved that book. Yeah, it's a product of its time. But it has a good message and a compelling story. Just because it uses "n^gger" too many times doesn't make the book bad or hurtful.
1336092318986866695 2020-12-08 07:36:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Capitalism allows for a free market and consumers to make their own choices and obtain their own opportunities. The problem comes down to shitty people running corporations or in high office positions of government making it worse for the poor/working class.
1335999680447180802 2020-12-08 01:28:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GiuseppeF0 Aww... does telling the truth hurt you little child?
1335984723332648967 2020-12-08 00:29:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UglokDecafnator @TMannu6 By that logic none of us need to obey the law.
1335984386265722887 2020-12-08 00:27:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LandarConqueror @TMannu6 Bitcoin too. I still don't understand half of how bitcoin works
1335984099606065154 2020-12-08 00:26:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @call_me_senpai @meme_expired @TMannu6 Everything is wrong with public schools. Economics? Skills for life? Actual fair world history? Nah. Gotta teach that critical r@ce theory.
1335983656695902208 2020-12-08 00:24:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tronnyverse @TMannu6 Sadly I don't either. I never really took the time to find that one out.
1335981268471787521 2020-12-08 00:15:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sheepdoge1 @LegalLoliLover1 Aye. That was my job....
1335878803340595204 2020-12-07 17:28:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ Back to the 'rona. There are people who have had grandparents and family members die to what china has unleased and the poor management and ethics of the doctors nationwide. I honestly don't know what to tell the people who are suffering, because I almost was in that spot myself.
1335877880539197441 2020-12-07 17:24:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ There's a ton of stupidity going around. Masks, people testing "positive" for some virus... fools saying there is no evidence of voter fraud. But I think what really takes the cake is Twitch banning the "blind playthrough" tag because it's offensive to real blind people.
1335876139592675328 2020-12-07 17:17:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sinto_yuu @KRawatXP2003 No. Its truth.
1335850539599486976 2020-12-07 15:36:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KRawatXP2003 If a law goes against the well being and will of the people, it is your sovergn duty to break that law.
1335850123264450560 2020-12-07 15:34:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @B1ucas @huntgbunt Spoken like a pitiable man with no knowledge of business or corporate   operations. He may have been an influential member of the "community", but to nintendo and any other corporation, he was a consumer with some fans. That's it. His influence carries no weight to them.
1335847885599109121 2020-12-07 15:25:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealDannyBenson Also essential to the world's pollen count.  No bumble bees? No flowers.
1335847478172782594 2020-12-07 15:23:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Hey, Eleanora is pretty!  And she's  a good mom!
1335846841506799616 2020-12-07 15:21:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung @Roytheboi5 You wake up when you choose to. Explore ideas. Think. Don't let go of hope.
1335846335510159360 2020-12-07 15:19:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FireSisterBee I disagree. The Christmas spirit ia about giving, love, and cherishing what you have. A little faith and support for your loved  ones goes a long way. 2020 is a year. A time. The events that happened are only terrible because china is asshole.
1335843888284766209 2020-12-07 15:09:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Shofie_Maverwyn @arvalis Oh. Well shit. He deserves his deserts then
1335811396995571712 2020-12-07 13:00:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @krychick @MartindaleJb Ok what about a girlfriend?
1335809395620515843 2020-12-07 12:52:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing If you want the destruction of america, be prepared to fight me
1335806107969785856 2020-12-07 12:39:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing You better be joking. The fuck 2.0 I can understand. Meme account. You?
1335805049700835338 2020-12-07 12:35:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily I think the responsibility lies in the high up executives.
1335803730608988161 2020-12-07 12:30:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mcorso20 Both of them are just.... ouch.
1335803296553037827 2020-12-07 12:28:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PaeanoaKingi_ @ActualAero And its back to its original rigging
1335802075993739265 2020-12-07 12:23:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ActualAero Good
1335801288731324424 2020-12-07 12:20:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @B1ucas @huntgbunt Nintendo doesn't need to care about one single consumer, nomatter how popular he was. This was a shitty thing to do, but it is not black and white.
1335800339908456449 2020-12-07 12:16:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MarioMasta64 @KodaKazar @huntgbunt It's the nature of copyright.
1335800009321836544 2020-12-07 12:15:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WolfenWingsShop @ElevenZM @huntgbunt Sadly true. While corporation can be pro consumer, the main purpose it to make money and generate capital while distributing products/services. That's the whole point of ANY business.
1335795323982241792 2020-12-07 11:56:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @christina_bobb But... the bull moose party....  Nah. I think that one can wait another 30 years
1335794402766311426 2020-12-07 11:52:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DawnMDix @RealDannyBenson You were able to tie in something that took me 7 months to figure out, with no help from my former microeconomics professor. Thank you
1335793287232434176 2020-12-07 11:48:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Corea_JoseD  https://t.co/Pc1IJojnK0
1335792929940647936 2020-12-07 11:47:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing 1 - I didn't know that.  2- Was this for a limited time? if it was still ongoing, Nintendo is in the wrong 100%.
1335792184562507776 2020-12-07 11:44:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Velvet_Amnesia @SilentVelocity_  I don't know if this is applicable to you, but I thought it would be kind to tag you. üòÅ
1335791577160151040 2020-12-07 11:41:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing I mean its profiting off of the "legacy" of a dead man that people can't stop mourning over. It's natural for a few months, or even half a year - especially for family members or friends. For those specifically, it can be much longer. But these people didn't "know" him. Silly.
1335790557461942274 2020-12-07 11:37:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Silverjojo08 @RubysBubys @Gregster1998 I never found a use for him because the core students and 1 teacher are just so good. I find him to be a waste of time and resources. When you're into the time skip and you haven't trained him, he's even more of a liability.
1335775978551906304 2020-12-07 10:39:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RubysBubys @Gregster1998 Wait. Does Cyril not count?
1335775627501297666 2020-12-07 10:38:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AvaWritesAlot I voted Johan because I can imagine Sean Schemmel screaming, "JOHAN!" I'm sorry I just can't not imagine it each and every time I see his name
1335775223048712192 2020-12-07 10:36:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nidesuoniisan @mashxtowin @LegalLoliLover1 Same. I'll just avoid the artist
1335771695714590721 2020-12-07 10:22:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mashxtowin @Nidesuoniisan @LegalLoliLover1 Oh. Most of the time I'm just like "I don't want this because it makes me super depressed".
1335770339255734272 2020-12-07 10:17:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Velvet Crowe, because I don't know crap about design. ACTUALLY WAIT JOTARO KUJO!!  https://t.co/cSYzrVRWmT

1335705615004561409 2020-12-07 06:00:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @voltimer_ This is wrong. In the japanese voicework of the first cutscene, Micaiah's JP voice actress said "Yune". That's straight from the source material.

She's a very obscure character, but one of the cuter ones when it comes to the franchise's theives. Maybe do a theif character poll? With Niles, Sothe, Lara, and Cath maybe? Just a small thought.

1335679879677820929 2020-12-07 04:17:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Willanator93 Honestly, seeing all lewd would get boring. If you can balance it with the other options, it would be really entertaining and fun, at least from a consumer perspective. Variety is the spice of life, as they say!
1335678498963329025 2020-12-07 04:12:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skuddbutt @drowsy_art I think it has to do with the level of lewd thoughts and "experience".

1335641199613501441 2020-12-07 01:44:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RubysBubys Eirika is cuter than Celica, but Celica is hotter than Eirika. Roy is smarter than both
1335633668279300097 2020-12-07 01:14:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Endgame I have not seen once. But I have seen the Room 2 times. Endgame is an average movie at best. The only thing it has going for it is the culmination of several movies that tell a compelling cohesive story that can only be concluded with endgame.
1335505467246776320 2020-12-06 16:44:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> People who wish to reduce humanity to nothing more than bags of flesh that exist only to complete biological processes. These people are like Zephiel. They see nothing whole in humanity, and wish to eradicate it. Physically or spiritually.  Are you like Roy, or like Zephiel?  https://t.co/bzVUsHYTN7
1335504082866462721 2020-12-06 16:39:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Fire Emblem the Binding Blade is my 4th Favorite Fire Emblem Game. The dichotomy of Roy and Zephiel is a display of the symbolic struggle between humanity's good and evil. There exist people like Zephiel in our world today, whether you believe it or not. Evil people. (1/2)

There are indeed people who scream and yell the second they see anything they don't like, treat it as oppression or danger, and hope the masses fall for it. It's a mad world we live in.

But it makes no sense whatsoever for a villian of any capacity to wear a mask for a "disease" that has a 99.98% survival rate. Sorry.

As for actual reading material, I'd suggest the comics. I've not read them all so.... I dunno
1335297739152908288 2020-12-06 02:59:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LadyRedHawk2 @ArCielHymnos They should probably keep that new covid vaccine on standby for the pedos who fail rehabilitation/therapy.

If you want to un-live them, do so when they present a direct threat to your children.

1334757079920353282 2020-12-04 15:11:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ILoveRaphtalia Can you tell me what a pogchamp is? I'll just start hitting random protagonists if I don't get a clear, defined answer.
1334756687631290370 2020-12-04 15:09:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fearsWRLD I disagree. I just don't get what a pogchamp is.

1334734124561653767 2020-12-04 13:39:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MrMichaelBurkes @AddVibes I'd say that's false. There's more evidence of climate change/global warming than the fraud. But there is TONS of Fraud evidence.  But with both, I can do nothing about it
1334722061596495873 2020-12-04 12:51:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc You know what I'll take it. Based on the other replies I'm close!

Therefore, it will be ignored by any court that believes in the first amendment of the US Constitution.

While it isn't that grave for you to interact with people all day,  you should talk to others face to face and bulster your communication skills. This is important socially,  psychologically, and survival-ly...(?)

1334026585494728705 2020-12-02 14:48:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CuboneBoneClub I think the idea is to be so polite that you avoid any danger created from a toxic environment. It happens when people complain about stuff and then cop out with "art is good". I actually enjoyed the art here.
1334025757736185856 2020-12-02 14:45:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @eyetweetkinda @koko4ki Honestly... with this info, calling black women and men chocolate is a compliment. Some folks like to know they have "caramel skin tones" so why is it different? This stuff sounds sexy and appealing. Do people not want to be appealing or sexy? I don't get it. Good info.
1334024650968485888 2020-12-02 14:40:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KarenStrassman No clue what this is! I hope it has an interesting premise!

1334018320207646720 2020-12-02 14:15:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @decaying_husk @hard2kill13 Well, I was referring more to wishing someone happiness or good cheer in their own celebrations. Like... it says there a muslim cannot wish someone merry christmas, even if he or she does not say "merry christmas".  I do not care what the Koran says. That should not be a sin.

1334006086056235008 2020-12-02 13:26:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Creiz @Signor_Girasole You can't just invent new pronouns. That's not how english works. And you can't own pronouns either. "Mine are they/them". Ok, then why did "they" not use it when they were referring to themself?  If this is the case, you would need to replace all pronouns - not just 3rd person.
1334004399966969856 2020-12-02 13:20:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Signor_Girasole @Creiz I've never even heard of neogender. Sounds stupid. I'm sticking with Solgender, where my male identity only comes out in the daytime. But I have a sun lamp in my room so I can be male all day and all night.

1333978602917015552 2020-12-02 11:37:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentVelocity_ One more question. You say that this account is for sonic characters. If one were to, say, commission you or give enough money on patreon to influence what you would draw, would it be possible to draw a combination of sonic characters and non-sonic characters?
1333975186882760704 2020-12-02 11:24:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ThePerkule It is very well drawn. Despite it being funny, you do have a lot of skill and talent!  I wish you all the beat in your artistic career! ^_^
1333973748035297280 2020-12-02 11:18:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentVelocity_ I'm sorry to ask, but is your avatar juat a mix of Miranda and Falco?

1333968004242092033 2020-12-02 10:55:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ryntai 776 (max goal) in increments of 30 and 69. When you reach 776, you need to draw the 3 least popular FE 5 characters from CYL 4. The rest milestones can be whatever. Sorry, I just don't have any other ideas

But they don't want to be seen as abnormal in their special little world of gender identity bullshit, so they take a chemistry term and put gender on it and use it as a label to separate us and demean us for being normal.
1333875662927654922 2020-12-02 04:48:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NbMelia94 @SydneyLWatson It means "normal male" or "normal female".

1333869331005009923 2020-12-02 04:23:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @krdiana1 @SydneyLWatson It's an eleborate scheme to destroy western civilization through androgyny. I don't use the term because the more it's used, the more these crazy asshats win.
1333868370605780992 2020-12-02 04:19:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SydneyLWatson Exactly. Thank you for being a voice of reason, Sydney.
1333847907523567619 2020-12-02 02:58:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung Marty is a coward, worthless in battle without tons of investment, and only serves to capture people in the first 3 chapters. By the time you get him back, you have other ways to do so and with better accuracy.  And those units are paragons of strength and virtue. So, NO.
1333845833675051012 2020-12-02 02:50:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung No
1333845752553091076 2020-12-02 02:49:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MystletainnNavi No, because it requires rigging, good luck, or tons of investment that most players don't have time for. But if you really want to use the cowardly POS then go ahead.
1333839932905971714 2020-12-02 02:26:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @3days3nights @AddVibes What if you wanted to ignore evidence before the supreme court, but god said, "I won, By a lot!"
1333838911467122693 2020-12-02 02:22:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt I think so? If it's the breakfast in bed one, it's super cute.  You always make the best pitridi art.

Because different artstyles encourage different competition and prices based on quality and value. Then again, art is treated as a commodity, so it's rough to make it consumer friendly.

And replacing them regularly is what you should do; every 20-25 minutes. The bacteria reaches effective levels after 30 minutes of use. It's better to just not wear them and not breathe in the shit your body is trying to expel.
1333760031561539585 2020-12-01 21:09:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kjzorp3827 @CytoSlate Close enough. Another way to say it would be, "I love it when employees treat us with respect, unlike the higher-ups." Because being formal is not always being nice.

Something as important and scary as this could be a serious shock to people, psychologically. So any excuse to not have to change or deal with large scale problems is taken as fact to keep the stress of reality at bay. That's the answer.
1333639752113926146 2020-12-01 13:11:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus "Padoru" is basically an anime meme thing. It started out as a FATE thing, where a girl sang some lyrics, and the end of it all was "padoru padoru!" And the character burst through a wall,  in the form you see in my avatar. It has spawned simple fanart from countless fandoms.
1333636706696916993 2020-12-01 12:59:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Going outside your comfort zone is always good as you come back making your comfort zone just a little bit bigger!  Also beware.... it is Padoru season. OwO

The character "Yoshi" was modeled after it. Heck, the only reason people had that photo opportunity was because the creature heard someone say "Taxes".  The moon landing was real.

Jokes aside I think something that would be interesting apart from going outside of your comfort zone, is to draw a more background-oriented theme piece. Something with less of a character focus, you know?

1333590935935082496 2020-12-01 09:57:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealNoseyParker Interesting video. These people are mentally ill and should not run positions of power. But this guy's idea of it being demons is a reach, and so is his view on trump being.... one of them.  But for the most part I see what you're going for.  It is a problem, but not large scale.

1333458410394832900 2020-12-01 01:10:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Mar212006 @SydneyLWatson I'm a man and I'm freaking pissed.  How is it that kind,  well meaning women are not as pissed as I am?  This is rediculous.
1333456606391054337 2020-12-01 01:03:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Pokemon are great. Especially Sandile. However, I must ask the question: Do beans have emotions?
1333456054684950534 2020-12-01 01:01:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Ok that's some amusing dialogue. XD
1333455124933595141 2020-12-01 00:57:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ For Covid 19. I'm pretty sure the virus exists.  But. The testing is flawed,  the reaction to it is stupid, and for some reason I need to be tested to go back to work even though I have no symptoms. Apparently there's paperwork to prove the testing, but I never heard of that.
1333312497089204225 2020-11-30 15:30:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman That really sucks.  If the deadline is after December 10th I may be able to help you.  I could send around 40 USD to help if you like, via PayPal

1333311027291828224 2020-11-30 15:24:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ryntai For Fire Emblem I suggest Lachesis (Eldigan's Sister).  For non Fire emblem I suggest Primrose Azelhart from Octopath Traveler, or Hanato Kobato from Kobato.

1333300703759097856 2020-11-30 14:43:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing I prefer the Phoenix Wright theme, personally. XD
1333300528198135809 2020-11-30 14:43:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LightningCayo @JasonIsMissing Because when you open your eyes and see for yourself... the world becomes clear.  I wish everyone would do the same.

1333299371274870784 2020-11-30 14:38:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LGovment @maggmountains Probably had a case of hypochondria. This whole covid thing is letting mental illnesses like this go unchecked. It's an irrational fear of death and disease turned up to 11 thanks to the media and fake doctors who do nothing to solve the problem.
1333298096776863744 2020-11-30 14:33:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @michaelsen158 Or worse. Blackmail.
1333297913485815808 2020-11-30 14:32:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic I didn't meet many people this year. But you have been a boon to me, my friend.

1333284149562576896 2020-11-30 13:38:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @2Bafz @TMannu6 Ok but what about fake tsunderes?  Or the best male tsundere ever, Inuyasha?
1333283955995533312 2020-11-30 13:37:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @0to_d @TMannu6 And the other way around, my friend!
1333283547591938049 2020-11-30 13:35:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AshyPrime @TMannu6 The more I look at Uzaki, the more I see the reasoning. She does look younger than her age. But guess what? She isn't. She's a woman and it's mostly the style playing tricks on my eyes. We can't have nice things....ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1333277065009795073 2020-11-30 13:09:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Saiykik Alright. Although.... I don't think I get the balloons.  I'll look out for them in the future!
1333257614550065158 2020-11-30 11:52:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @riskedbiscuit It's about skill. Not teirs.
1333253303468224513 2020-11-30 11:35:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shineori Bold of you to assume that a pandemic is a good excuse. It is an explanation. But eh. People can do what they want, I suppose. no harm done
1333251827257761799 2020-11-30 11:29:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Errrrrick1 @Saiykik I agree. The lineart and lines are quite bold (and deep?).  every dark outline seems defined along with your style. Sorry to reply to Erick about this, but he said it better than I could have. He got me to think about the line work.
1333250998274560000 2020-11-30 11:26:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Saiykik Ok so you do have a neat style. But there are a few other styles that seem similar to yours, that I've seen on this site and other art creation sites like pixiv.  I don't think this means your art is bad. I'm probably too dumb to notice in the first place. Maybe a unique "tic"?
1333250348945993728 2020-11-30 11:23:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Saiykik I actually don't know. I want to help, but I need to look into what art you have.  Sorry if this sounds dumb
1333244308263153665 2020-11-30 10:59:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kermit_fat_cat Me. I'm a dumbass who thinks women are all out to get me lol

1333242428879417345 2020-11-30 10:52:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TrailsOfAstra This was the furry fandom for me. I realized that none of them, even the friends I made, were reasonable enough to respect me.  That's only part of why I'm a "former furry".
1333233291428818946 2020-11-30 10:16:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Maybe she likes cheesecake?

1333158096286453763 2020-11-30 05:17:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrangeJuce_ I'm sorry to hear that.
1333157648338984960 2020-11-30 05:15:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg My points still stand. Also, "top scientists" estimated that we would reach over 200,000 deaths by june. Guess what? It took until late august to reach that number. And that's with willful negligence by stupid governors like Andrew Cumo and other breaches of medical ethics.
1333156655845019649 2020-11-30 05:11:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theprinceofiris @Gregster1998 Yup. Sure looks excited to me
1333156065593135105 2020-11-30 05:09:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg What's basic is your understanding of how viruses work. Masks don't work. Read the recent Danish study on masks and Covid19(84). Read the paper written by Dennis Rancourt. Hell, just learn about basic physics, and use your  brain. We tried flattening the curve, and to no avail.
1333155319351009280 2020-11-30 05:06:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ShellySundell @kirstiealley I want to live life but idiots make it difficult. I'm not afraid of some disease - just concerned for my mother who is struggling with it currently.  I do need to join a church group or any group of some sort, but I'm not going to be forced to wear a stupid muzzle for "safety".
1333154523095986182 2020-11-30 05:03:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JxS_Colours @DeathLordPopo @kensaikik It's called understanding when a word is overblown beyond all rational thought. Me saying "nigga" is not going to injure or cause a black man to have a heart attack. It's not worth caring about because it is not important. Just stop using racism as an excuse and move on. Easy.
1333153850237325318 2020-11-30 05:00:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg That child's death, as poor, sad, and unfortunate as it is, is not my responsibility. Guess what? Diseases don't go away without action. Proper treatment is what works, and we need to keep pushing for honest medical care. Not lying doctors who say masks and lockdowns work.
1333153150505799680 2020-11-30 04:57:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg @Kim85780313 The wrong treatment can lead to premature death. It is overblown to say that "children can be effected by this deadly disease too" yeah. They can, but the media acts like children are dropping like flies - that is false. Children are the least susceptible to this shit. 1/2
1333152606017949705 2020-11-30 04:55:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @alvin_or @WaifuAlert I know. I'm just terrified of that shit happening to me. And NTR doujins existing isn't helping my anxiety either.
1333150346898780163 2020-11-30 04:46:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Vallurite Same. I need some sort of schedule to get back into
1333118133838753796 2020-11-30 02:38:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @alvin_or @WaifuAlert I have dated 0 women. But women have the power to end a man's livelihood with false rape claims or worse. See the Johnny Depp case in England. It's best to just not get involved with real women because they will fuck you over the second you are not useful to them.
1333116987929743366 2020-11-30 02:33:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg @Kim85780313 I read the article. It's sad. But it didn't say what treatment she received. IT seems like an unfortunate case being cherry-picked and overblown to cause fear. This child should not have had to die. True. But to say that we must sacrifice everyone's freedom for it is ludicrous.
1333115975638675463 2020-11-30 02:29:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deannaveg @Kim85780313 With what?
1333115855429922816 2020-11-30 02:29:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JxS_Colours @DeathLordPopo @kensaikik Cool beans. We all know the racial implications. I just choose not to care about that and focus on things that matter. If someone doesn't want me to say it around them, I'll do it. There's a difference between not saying something and forcing me not to say it.
1333114685667893258 2020-11-30 02:24:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirstiealley 1 - A friend.

1333093190157602817 2020-11-30 00:59:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kleeies I feel that. Want to be friends? My last "friend" blocked me for no explained reason after I sent him a lot of good art I had saved up. With sources, of course.
1333092758639284224 2020-11-30 00:57:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> This. If a law does not exist to better the lives of the people, it is harmful and should be denied by every able citizen.

Last I checked, saying that only people of certain skin colors can say certain things is racist. I'm Caucasian. Freedom of speech means I can say anything I want, as long as it doesn't violate another's inalienable rights. Black people can say "cracker". Equality. ‚úåÔ∏è

1333090052994441219 2020-11-30 00:46:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ In a way, you are very correct. The world cannot be prepared without a clear mind.

But here's the thing: the focus should be on treatment and relief - not on stopping the spread. We have ample treatment for this shit. It's just not profitable to doctors. Mask mandates are not going to solve this problem.

But luckily we were able to clean the wound and use standard first aid. It was also less than a centimeter deep so... probably not as bad as what you went through

I don't even know what it is, probably because I'm 25 and a stupid American. Looking it up now...  Ok so it's a running and tag-like sport. Sounds fun for anyone looking to be rough and tumble.

1332881171072606211 2020-11-29 10:56:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ Told to quit believing in conspiracy theories. I don't believe in all of them, but they hold more merrit each day. As such, I am in a position to only fend for myself. But I want to help others so no one I care for has to suffer. It is painful and I don't know how to help.
1332880577318563843 2020-11-29 10:54:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCoronaCure_ On one hand, I never EVER want to submit my free will to another. Even at the cost of my life. And I am ashamed to know some friends and family who would gladly trade it for "safety". I try to convince people for their own good, but I am ignored and (cont.)

1332838762536181761 2020-11-29 08:08:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda Rivali and Mipha. Mipha because...  my dream of a zora GF is limited.  Rivali is an asshole and for a damn good reason. The other two are cool.  But Daruk isn't too special and Urbosa is the worst out of all the champions.

1332765257987715075 2020-11-29 03:16:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @B4and0nA Try shoving it in your ass next.

1332764650262421504 2020-11-29 03:13:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeitungEvolved And why should I care about graphics? It's not everything. Piss off
1332764256333406211 2020-11-29 03:12:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus He is strong. Good character too. But I fail to find all of bleach worth it past the 2nd arc, since most of the show retreads the same idea and becomes stale.
1332763831475572740 2020-11-29 03:10:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @not_noose Finally you're saying something good! Not intelligent, but good!

Equal opportunity is good. "Equity" is bad, and leads to equal auffering without freedom of choice. Segregation is the same thing as equality of outcome.
1332762019624333313 2020-11-29 03:03:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 I don't care. Not reading any of them

Big tech companies are a problem, but abolishing the thing that allows people like me to have a voice will only deal damage to the people in the long run.
1332732436459958275 2020-11-29 01:05:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ImNekki @Willanator93 Congratulations on 1K followers! And you can add me to that number, because any artist brave enough to draw someone like brunya is S teir in my book. Hope you had a great November! (^_^)

The court ignored the evidence and proof against the lady who abused Depp and framed him as the perpetrator, when he had all the bruses and had suffered. Courts can easily say no to facts.
1332727727250608133 2020-11-29 00:47:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Cirno091 @MrRandem Apparently it is good because "we do it naturally". Yeah, we feel more comfortable around those like us, but that is all the more reason to be around thise who are different. Skin color is (one of) the least impactful factors on who you are as a person. Segregation is dumb.
1332726263367299077 2020-11-29 00:41:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ludraman_ I hate having a hot Asian wife  *prays*

There are people who married or are related to those of different ethnicities.  Do we take them away from eachother? Seperation based on some small factor we cannot control is extremely stupid.
1332581970396798984 2020-11-28 15:07:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Shit. I misspelled tongue.
1332581037042511874 2020-11-28 15:04:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I haven't been to the dentist in about 8 months. That also means I haven't had the dental assistant put her fingers in my mouth and floss the teeth that are a pain to reach. On one hand, I enjoy the freedom. On the other, I miss the gloved fingers upon my tounge.

Besides, white vs black doesn't account for the other races. And how much money would be needed to keep certain areas seperate and equal for a population of over 300 million? Besides, the issue isn't race here. It's marxism.

There was one doujin where a heroine got amputated and then the villians pulled the bones from her stubs and banged those. After that she was k1lled by a gun through her V and had a bomb stuffed in her belly as an example to the other heroes.

The first map is designed so that you learn how to play without being hand-held.  So if people look up guides, it means they can't teach themselves how to adapt to challenges.  Nevertheless, this is a good thing and I applaud it. Thanks.
1332542663158099968 2020-11-28 12:31:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Um... cool! Soft skin is a trait of beauty
1332541416535445505 2020-11-28 12:26:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MacHAttack17 @GrimTwinDD Adam is a great actor. But this whole sequel trillogy is just TONS of missed potential and agenda bs.  Kinda wish we could see the outline George Lucas gave disney before he sold starwars.

1332503144983629824 2020-11-28 09:54:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 @potiongorilla I was buying things for my mom while I went grocery shopping, and I needed to know what brand and size to get.
1332498812171120643 2020-11-28 09:37:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jesse_Hoyt7 @catturd2 Was ready for that on november 5th.

1332497844029284353 2020-11-28 09:33:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Shellbe71822534 The point is to eliminate normal humans. It's a human crime.
1332496336957083649 2020-11-28 09:27:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AbeiV @BardsFM @AwakenedOutlaw I'm sorry what the hell is "transhumanism"? First I've ever heard that term.  It sounds like something straight from the mental asylum.
1332495456874733570 2020-11-28 09:24:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirstiealley I thought black friday was canceled. Hm.
1332493575800709121 2020-11-28 09:16:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gregcool1 What's annoying is that the court could just ignore evidence and claim it wasn't good enough.  It's what happened to Johnny Depp
1332492219232751617 2020-11-28 09:11:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @russell_sim Sadly, as smart as sydney is, she doesn't seem to believe this one yet. She isn't stupid. Far from it.  I just wish more people would realize that the free will of humanity is not something you should fuck with.
1332490943136751616 2020-11-28 09:06:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VersaDile Looks like someone hasn't played Bowser's inside story.
1332490804112318467 2020-11-28 09:05:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone ITS SO CUTE AAAHHH
1332490678241292288 2020-11-28 09:05:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS I think the anime went too hard on the plot poison. The more deaths you add into your story, the less inpactful they become. When done well, a death is a reason tonpush forward or a moment to mourn the loss of a beloved character. When done cheaply, it's just boring.
1332489868895793152 2020-11-28 09:01:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @potiongorilla @CrownGamer901 Dammit  https://t.co/vpV3e4XgBd
1332489138994556929 2020-11-28 08:59:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS But if you want one that's happy go lucky with some light heartstring drama, "Kobato." Is a good show, and it was made under studio madhouse, the same one that made One punch man.
1332488792213696514 2020-11-28 08:57:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS I know it may not be popular, but the one show I will always reccomend is Shinsekai Yori (from the new world) for its suspenseful story, good characters, and thought provoking narrative.
1332488052204253185 2020-11-28 08:54:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rin_asobi I bought groceries.
1332463486627098624 2020-11-28 07:17:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Most of the plots are simple and easy to follow. I'd rather have a simple, fun plot than a complex one that makes me rewatch the same scene just to understand what I'm watching.
1332463103896858625 2020-11-28 07:15:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WAPFLondon @KenDBerryMD That I didn't know. Probably explains how I get irritable when I don't eat after 5 hours
1332462078607691776 2020-11-28 07:11:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus It's a fantastic film.  Personally, I like Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service more. But most ghibli films are wonderous and filled with adventure, love, and passion.
1332461655020744704 2020-11-28 07:09:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Grca1337 People also choose things that don't exist.  I, however, am Sol Gender.
1332456135102697475 2020-11-28 06:47:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC Good. Looks like you're ready to fight and die to protect the fatherland.
1332433211050356743 2020-11-28 05:16:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TaskLacka This has to be your bwst drawing of her so far! Great work! Maybe someday she'll prove her usefulness.
1332430391014285314 2020-11-28 05:05:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @That_mist_ake Normalization, or celebration? Laws and common acceptance normalize things, sweetie. Oh. And having a mental illness is hardly something to be prideful over.  Just use the LGB. Then you'll be fine and dandy.
1332429829401174018 2020-11-28 05:03:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OdynnMoonFox @Alfi3_E @GrueGoblin And? If it doesn't hurt you, what's the problem? It's just a little parade. And no one is out to hurt people.
1332429315754090499 2020-11-28 05:01:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FromKalen This frightens me.  It also reminds me of that one movie, "Teeth".  Where a girl's uterus was home to an alien creature that ate anything that came through her vaginal walls. But yeah I hate this image.
1332427682693394437 2020-11-28 04:54:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OdynnMoonFox @Alfi3_E @GrueGoblin Then let them do it again. I see no harm in it.
1332427580142743556 2020-11-28 04:54:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @That_mist_ake @Alfi3_E @GrueGoblin Personally I don't think you need one for either sexuality. But if one has it, why not another?
1332421343820832770 2020-11-28 04:29:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dostatochno I thank you for that. That is a good sentiment to have. Sadly, I have lost hope and sympathy for the mentally deranged.
1332417297177341952 2020-11-28 04:13:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ribb_it Maybe.  I didn't recognize that: my bad.
1332417148728258564 2020-11-28 04:12:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dostatochno Ah. My bad. I thought you were another one of those folks who believes in moon gender
1332416928468639745 2020-11-28 04:12:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Alfi3_E @GrueGoblin Yes. Why not?
1332416778627133442 2020-11-28 04:11:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @beardalaxy @OwlFamiliar If that is the case then you are bisexual. You are being turned on or attracted to what your mind is displaying that "gender" to be, whatever it is. Case in point: if you are attracted to 2 sexes, you are attracted to both genders.
1332416199716646913 2020-11-28 04:09:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DaranDark @OwlFamiliar Straight and trying to find your sexuality. Duh. This is literally gay or straight with extra steps.
1332415546743250946 2020-11-28 04:06:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TAwakeChristian To answer the question here, it is against freedom of speech, and it hurts me because it gives me a migraine from sheer stupidity.
1332414962552229888 2020-11-28 04:04:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dostatochno And its stupid. You used gender in quotes. You are lost
1332414691516289025 2020-11-28 04:03:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_Alex_Longbard_ @OwlFamiliar "Cis" when refering to human beings and "identity" is a lie and I am saddened to see another fool fall victim to it. There are 2 genders: male and female. All else is either a mental condition or mental gymnastics.

1332400390441230338 2020-11-28 03:06:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @chris_moyler @kksheld @zev_dr It does help. It is a zinc ionophore and zinc is extremely helpful. This drug simply blocks the virus proteins from latching on to cells.
1332399600699846656 2020-11-28 03:03:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kastner_Jaime @kksheld What was the dosage?  And is it possible to get it outside of a doctor's prescription?
1332399049459249160 2020-11-28 03:01:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WhoisNAL That's why we must destroy it. Now, before we all fall and humanity is extinguished.
1332397488137965569 2020-11-28 02:54:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kim85780313 Kim, I understand the virus is not that dangerous. But what does the testing have to do with it? There are STDs that you need to be tested for because there are no verifiable symptoms. I'm asking becauseI can't figure out the logic to this argument.

1332395460179488775 2020-11-28 02:46:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @maliemoe432 At the very least I have awoken to this fact. I question things a lot more than 5 years ago, and I find myself smarter and more confident for it.
1332394378485264385 2020-11-28 02:42:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RekietaMedia Its sad. Death threats should not be taken lightly, and yet, here we are, doing just that. It's because of these spineless, unthinking sjw types that we need to water down something as alarming as a death threat down to a meme.
1332392945329319936 2020-11-28 02:36:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KozukiDOden Yes. Dragon Quest 5, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask, Final Fantasy 9, The legend of spyro: dawn of the dragon, Octopath Traveler, and Sword of mana. The last one made me cry because the ending was stupid
1332366997468962816 2020-11-28 00:53:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman That sucks, man. Hope you get it soon!

1332353838297341955 2020-11-28 00:01:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BattleUnicycle @Woke_GF That is your fundamental flaw. Hatred of humanity is something that is strong enough to k^ll and butcher the lives of millions. Love? Compassion? Free will?  None of that will flourish under your idea of hatred. So i say again: grow a damn spine and let people live their lives.
1332227119838081025 2020-11-27 15:37:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Woke_GF Oh nooooooes. So many people!  Grow a spine, and live life.

1332224454668259329 2020-11-27 15:27:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Overrated stat but ok.  You have fun
1332223578583031809 2020-11-27 15:23:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rakeemspoon @custardloaf Excuses.
1332223322466213888 2020-11-27 15:22:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @markyjoe1990 Not necessarily. It is important to look for yourself and see things with your own eyes. It can be used as a cop out, but there's nothing wrong with doing your own research. I mean, don't you want to know things? I saw is better than I heard.
1332207627896545281 2020-11-27 14:20:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Why are you obsessed over boots?

Something very few games have to fill out their core identity and the tools that drive its gameplay, story, and atmosphere.
1332180271647625216 2020-11-27 12:31:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Clawnyan Dragon Quest 5. As much as several RPGs tend to do for me.. this one was so different, while being universal in every way. But something about it gripped my heart and just wouldn't let go. I can say the same for FF9 and Even Castlevania OoE, but DQ5 is too special for me.
1332146268605444097 2020-11-27 10:16:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nakios_ @skye_magus I tried. It ended in me yelling at my dad, and Me being super tired.

1332136586759299073 2020-11-27 09:38:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SheepEddie @Canning_Box Some people apparently sent death threats to this woman for posting that.  It's rediculous what morons like that will do
1332134466098180096 2020-11-27 09:29:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PatriotMarine4 @IceAgeFarmer Then tell the creator to shove it. Suicide isn't the answer, that much I agree with. But my life is my life, and God cannot do shit against me.

1331879209980088320 2020-11-26 16:35:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gohan15243 @Spicy_Bolitas @castcuraga Yeah but in Crimson flower you side with someone who denies your existance and also kills thousands of innocent lives. Checkmate

1331854601272897537 2020-11-26 14:57:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EukayBrie You don't need to follow me. Come what may, I will try my best to never give up and never give in. If it means to fight my own family to preserve the freedom of myself and hundreds of american citizens, I will, because I must. I pray it does not come to that.
1331853206222200833 2020-11-26 14:52:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TMannu6 Apparently because it would be a drawing of something underage it automatically makes it "equal to" the under age depiction. Bullshit.
1331848556907520000 2020-11-26 14:33:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 Sadly I can't have people over. My mother is dreadfully sick, and my grandmother will catch it. But hey, we're still getting broccoli casserole!
1331848034645397505 2020-11-26 14:31:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TroySmalley5 @SydneyLWatson Its just like the spanish language intended: 2, and only 2
1331847442233438208 2020-11-26 14:29:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Wakko is the best because Dot got botched in the new rendition of the show.  Or... crappy reboot.
1331846899490566147 2020-11-26 14:27:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @castcuraga Golden deer/Verdant wind. Blue lions was the best route,  while not my favorite. Crimson flower was worse than Silver Snow
1331846595277705216 2020-11-26 14:25:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirstiealley I don't understand. Is the dog going to bite me, or is the dog going to bite itself? The reason we have rules in english is so people can understand what is being said.
1331845958842396672 2020-11-26 14:23:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Good point
1331845745985654784 2020-11-26 14:22:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ryntai Why not both?
1331845630130524161 2020-11-26 14:21:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman Never thought about that.
1331845410802049024 2020-11-26 14:21:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD I am thankful that my family is alive and we are still standing. I am also thankful for making friends during this stupid quarentine thing.  And I'm thankful for finding Botan's number 1 fan! (You)
1331844488172539905 2020-11-26 14:17:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing Doesn't matter which side you are on: He is a meme, fellas.

1331459551527374850 2020-11-25 12:47:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Propagandile I've never seen sandile before, and I assume it's a pokemon.  WHY IS IT SO CUTE!?
1331455714754252806 2020-11-25 12:32:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing It's a bad game that shits on the original. If you didn't see this coming, you're blind.
1331455481362190336 2020-11-25 12:31:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MajorPatriot @AddVibes I think nothing will change and we are in a stalemate.
1331454278880391174 2020-11-25 12:26:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mituyota_76 @Vallurite Lovely!
1331453987741175809 2020-11-25 12:25:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ffruitgoddess It's also correct.
1331453139053142016 2020-11-25 12:22:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Whoyagottatweet @jamm3rlives @WolfieSmith5 Bullshit

1331451472769331201 2020-11-25 12:15:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @2Hathorn Never seen it.  Is it to be confused with the fireman hentai thing?
1331451094136926208 2020-11-25 12:14:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus Hm... gonna look into this

1331450769372049408 2020-11-25 12:12:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus Map is a stupid term. Just say pedophile. Same thing.
1331427485897158656 2020-11-25 10:40:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman DEAR GOD NO
1331427397883879427 2020-11-25 10:40:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sadyeehawman @metalcapwings Wrong. IT's anime chess on maps that have variety.
1331427250105946112 2020-11-25 10:39:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SEyLogic @metalcapwings I wish the lilina puzzle thing was done better, like in FE 1/11. I honestly wish that placement puzzle were used in more games, but the point is: This is probably the 2nd worst map in FE 6.
1331426888867311618 2020-11-25 10:38:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @metalcapwings People say chapter 14 (bet, comments below/above me lol) but it's literally a test of your skills with class utility, recource management, and not fucking up with the wyvern lords. the manaketes have low movement range anyway, and 25 turns is generous for a desert map.
1331426507982573568 2020-11-25 10:36:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GiggukAZ That's neat, but I'll eat the crust on it if I want. I'm not weak.

1331423839851569153 2020-11-25 10:25:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @not_noose Before I unfollow you, do you want to explain the blasphemy that just came off your keyboard/keypad?
1331377464212418565 2020-11-25 07:21:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @chuggaaconroy The lockdowns are getting to them.
1331371503615668235 2020-11-25 06:57:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 But at least you have friends to navigate it with

1331370715174621191 2020-11-25 06:54:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JonneyDunn @stillgray Nope. They just want you to think that so you comply with them completely of your own free will. Then you will never have free will again.

1331311860122062851 2020-11-25 03:00:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @azureol The year has been very taxing. Next year may be very different. But it all depends on you, and how you take in the world around you.

1331110579583541248 2020-11-24 13:41:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jump_Jump_69 Why do I hear her voice as an old chain smoker?
1331103731602034692 2020-11-24 13:13:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Melee is a good game and if people want to play it, no copyright law in the universe is going to stop them!    Did I get that right?
1331103110266310656 2020-11-24 13:11:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @John__Melody @ryntai Stealing this image. It's hilarious

1331101889967091712 2020-11-24 13:06:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung I shudder to think this is something people want in modern day america. This is absolutely disgusting.

1331100721832472578 2020-11-24 13:01:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda He's talking about my ex.  She left me for Daruk, and now this guy has her....
1331100351458652164 2020-11-24 13:00:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cryptidkani The bunny girl is what keeps me going in hard times. I appreciate the care in your works. Whoever commissioned this should be proud, as should you! Good work,  and bless you!

1330931028651880449 2020-11-24 01:47:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZeldaDungeon Time loop, despair, and strength of will.

There are next to no side effects with this drug when considering it for treatment. It is highly effective, and there is no reason to not have it available for common use by those in need. Zinc helps too.
1330789054665928710 2020-11-23 16:23:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @richardwdean @Thomas_Binder But how do we know that the papaya being a fruit did not cause an irregularity in the test? It's meant for humans and animals, so the fruit probably yeilded a positive result as a default, right? Or, did so when it could not detect human or animal DNA. Just want to know, thanks.
1330785941255057412 2020-11-23 16:11:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pinestrawwookie You are right. I've shared with a friend. Will share with family soon

And for children whose bodies are not fully developed? That's probably even worse. Children are actually the least likely to become fatally ill from this thing anyway.
1330776075157331969 2020-11-23 15:31:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung Looks good!

1330773769808437248 2020-11-23 15:22:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TobiahsJames I don't hate a lot of things jokingly. But that kid's parents are a joke and I actually hate them.  That kid isn't amazing. He's a result of child abuse and I condemn any who follows suit on their own children.
1330772303760797696 2020-11-23 15:16:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse The only thing that makes him not super annoying is the light brands ability to always deal 10 damage at range.

1330715725233872897 2020-11-23 11:32:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask I think it makes you look serious, more than anything.

1330711348536369154 2020-11-23 11:14:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VictorG27981593 I see what you're going for. And it is good to understand what tools can be used for good and evil and adjust their designs accordingly. But at the end of the day, destroying the value of the human race is much worse than a few weapons that can also be used to save lives.

You need to adapt to a culture to live in and understand the communities that thrive within it. Same with language. If culture cannot be appropriated or used in some way, then 80% of the world would be SOL

There's a difference between having the ability to work for everything you will ever need and want, and being given everything you need. Social safety nets are fine in moderation.
1330352702837182464 2020-11-22 11:29:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheEmeraldJaco1 "The bastards" being competitive melee players who do charity streams that don't go to actual charities and nonprofit organizations worth a damn.
1330352412842930178 2020-11-22 11:28:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheEmeraldJaco1 If people want to play melee they can. But people who act like it's the best game ever are just purely irritating and annoying. I'm almost glad Nintendo shut down slippi. The bastards donate to organizations bent on furthering ideologies that can kill millions of people.
1330343550354137088 2020-11-22 10:53:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TENROU_ROYAL_Q @FahriiCat @SomberFlare That is completely false. Artists work for their income. Artists should not be garenteed a basic income. If artists want a garenteed income not based of of skill and quality of the items they make, then work a 9-5 job with a salary.
1330342943694221319 2020-11-22 10:50:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FahriiCat @Vallurite Art is a commodity item. It will naturally be expensive. But with trends and competition keeping the market saturated. Most artists have no choice but to lower prices. Keep your dayjob. If you want to keep low prices, don't make art your only income unless you can work fast.

1330012804624101376 2020-11-21 12:58:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mcorso20 I'm going to be real with you. I love people. I can despise, condemn, and refuse any who I see as "unworthy". But hatred is a beast of unrivaled suffering and pain. Once you hate humanity, there's no going back. Once that happens, you will need to be taken out to preserve good.
1330009818380242945 2020-11-21 12:47:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cain_nate Damn.  Tucker appeared to be a good man, with interest in the wellbeing of the american people. But to hear directly from this woman that he was rude and very condescending just... it almost hurts.  Goodbye,  Mr. Carlson. Also yeah the voting stuff was interesting to hear too.
1330006699080560647 2020-11-21 12:34:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I looked this up. Yes, this is the case. Regardless of parents being able to "opt out", it still sickens me that these idiots believe children of 5 years of age, who may or may not want to eat glue, are anywhere near capable of understanding the complexity of sex.  https://t.co/YcSckAO7Qg
1330004664549580801 2020-11-21 12:26:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman There are times where I find myself in fear of sex due to STD's. Other times I'm reminded of how it is the purest form of intimacy with whom you love. Sex isn't great; it is powerful and should not be abused lest one becomes consumed by its grip.
1330002373184516096 2020-11-21 12:17:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pinestrawwookie Exactly. My mother supposedly has it, but she also has viral pneumonia. On top of that she has chronic bronchitis. The doctor told her to lay on her stomach and get plenty of rest.  Any.. uh.. medical advice?  Ugh. Doctors by me are all scams. My mother is in pain and I am angry.

Asking for my dumbass father
1330000189063622656 2020-11-21 12:08:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bu_qet @MarcusTriton It's true. They get government funding from covid deaths as relief for "national emergency". So even if it's the flu and the patient kills himself, it's a covid death. Sorry, but thems the brakes.

1329950312657002496 2020-11-21 08:50:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> In the onset of a tyrannical government, you give these fuckers and inch, and they'll take a mile. In fact, they'll take every mile they can, until you, the free people, are left with only the green mile.

1329944568490504193 2020-11-21 08:27:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus I think it has to do with the lockdown order and being stuck at home for weeks on end. You don't want to run out of something you use daily. The thing is, this isn't a full lockdown. You can go places you want to go.

1329926762134908931 2020-11-21 07:17:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @maliemoe432 I am terrified.  Ever since learning about the WEF's plans I have a constant heavy heart knowing I can't do jack shit. Constant terror, depression and thoughts of hopelessness.  So yes, it sucks.
1329926046817411072 2020-11-21 07:14:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IceAgeFarmer This frightens the fuck out of me. How the fuck can I do anything to stop this or save my loved ones?  If I can't do anything then I'll be back to contemplating sucide. That hurts. I don't want to give up. But shit like this makes it look like an option.

The vilages in FE 4 hold some of the strictest rush requirements in FE, and Dew isn't reliable enough to steal money unless I warp him to castles sigurd has already cleared.

1329632507596300289 2020-11-20 11:47:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lucina211 I find dew to be good in his join chapter for taking money. But all else... he sucks. Brigid should be higher, and jamke sadly is correctly placed. He's one of the best archers in the series. His problem? It's FE 4

1329570678362828800 2020-11-20 07:42:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS I find tons of artists through rule 34 and Pixiv.  R34 is bad about plagiarizing and re-posting art. But I think the worst part about R34 are the comments....
1329569910746451969 2020-11-20 07:39:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Yes.  It was sad, indeed.  And I'm glad you like the best monk in anime

1329530875965546496 2020-11-20 05:03:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @labella_ely This is great and all, but I don't see the laundry.

1329527971590369285 2020-11-20 04:52:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kierenalden @OrwellNGoode I speak from experience when I say that reality is often your best friend and your greatest hurdle. Do you want to live a life of daisies and rainbows, and get stuck later on where sorrow is all you know? Or do you want to persevere now, and be a herald of strength later?
1329527129902604292 2020-11-20 04:49:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic That's funny.  Ans yes, I have heard of the conference. I'm more concerned about the global shut down and how the world will be in a state of nihilism and pain. Fucking lost sleep over it

1329524794992304130 2020-11-20 04:39:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @chrisbacon84 @Cryptovice1 So it is an amount of digital gold. Alright. Does it have applications or is it made just to be bought and sold?
1329522594589061121 2020-11-20 04:31:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @XplosiveBearArt @Kekeflipnote I felt this. I'm no artist, but I can sympathize with this.
1329517898184974339 2020-11-20 04:12:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @reazoniam This is what I'm concerned about. The value of the dollar is only as much as we want it to be. But how do we know bitcoin is different? What exactly IS a "bitcoin", and why is it valuable? is it useful for processing software? I'm ignorant about this, but these are important Q's.
1329517234956488706 2020-11-20 04:09:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Cryptovice1 I have questions. Lots. How is bitcoin different than cash or tangable assets/funds? If it's completely digital, then how do we know people can't produce it en-mass and then sell it for high prices, like gold? Why was it created, and why do we want to get rid of physical money?
1329515432173330433 2020-11-20 04:02:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kierenalden @HerculeanStren1 @OrwellNGoode This also goes for mental ability or "identity" issues. If it is destructive, then don't beat around the bush. Reality is harsh, but overcoming such harshness makes us stronger.

1329493667845971970 2020-11-20 02:36:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 This is great news!  My only question is if all of this will prevent imminent disaster.  Will Trump in office with less corruption be enough to protect our citizens from global tyranny?

1329485245851332611 2020-11-20 02:02:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LilithLovett My depression and anxiety has spiked significantly in the past 16 hours. I try to sleep, but I constantly wake up, from dreams about lines and boarders. I also don't feel well physically, so all I can do is try to sleep. I blame the government.

1329185015884881921 2020-11-19 06:09:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RickS8107 @catturd2 Because people will think this is fake science, or other studies have already disproven this new one. They want to cling to any defense against this virus they can, because masks not working would make everyone feel vulnerable and terrified. Fear is one hell of a drug.
1329184150339936258 2020-11-19 06:06:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @iamkimoda @catturd2 Precisely this. If it's going towards you, when it's had air pressure and currents to slow it down or redirect the contaminants, and it still doesn't work, how is it supposed to work the other way around, when there's more force behind it?

1329167469651570699 2020-11-19 04:59:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse With BATH, you can pull this off with ease and a brave lance. Maybe a slim weapon
1329167301397143554 2020-11-19 04:59:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Roytheboi5 Which one? They're all weeb games
1329167173936435208 2020-11-19 04:58:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I mean sonic is hot. He's probably some dude high on acid in a blue animal costume, but I think it'll be fine. Just place a chilli dog on a plate, and have a large cardboard box on standby
1329166770524065794 2020-11-19 04:57:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Wat.  There's a Goth Hooters!? üëÄüíú

1329136264692576256 2020-11-19 02:55:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jude_crew Gave me so much brain damage, I actually think training meg is worth it
1329136078582931456 2020-11-19 02:55:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Who is jude and why does it remind me of the Beatles?
1329135921246171137 2020-11-19 02:54:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Dunno. I don't have the app so I don't get fleets

1329090262501527562 2020-11-18 23:53:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @wurt_ @andrewbostom Same thing.
1329086329842397194 2020-11-18 23:37:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BelmontSeo @Forseti_Silesse Just trying to be informative juat in case.
1329002124060057601 2020-11-18 18:02:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KenEbert3 @catturd2 That's bullshit
1328999729443823619 2020-11-18 17:53:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Dirtdigger1988 @catturd2 Right. Oh, it's airborne. Don't wear a mask.  Ok do wear one. *7 months of research later: Ok folks, turns out this thing isn't airborne, but you still need to wear masks even though there is no verifiable evidence that they prevent viral infection of any kind. Fuck the CDC
1328998251299794944 2020-11-18 17:47:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PowerIsPeople @best88net Blackmail works. Sadly no one is ever punsihed for it. The punishment for blackmail needs to be life imprisonment or worse.
1328996807679111169 2020-11-18 17:41:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @glacierwaltz_ Are we talking looks or intelligence?
1328996589025841154 2020-11-18 17:40:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FellGod_ Centaurs are not real and do not have rights. You are a demented fool and I am not talking with you any longer.
1328977646424879110 2020-11-18 16:25:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jared_ungar @GiggukAZ This is inaccurate. British do not have guns.
1328977211664240640 2020-11-18 16:23:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FellGod_ I have no issues with centaurs.  I have issues with you being a fucking moron, and not understanding how words work.
1328974782851936256 2020-11-18 16:14:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FellGod_ Thanks for proving my point.
1328973814177406976 2020-11-18 16:10:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> He doesn't care. He knows it's not dangerous. He just wants to hurt the people in the lower class.
1328973151305420803 2020-11-18 16:07:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @butcha_u Sweet cat! ^_^

1328968110519558148 2020-11-18 15:47:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_deeKei Yup. I don't like change!
1328967802645065731 2020-11-18 15:46:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Not bad.
1328967757724069892 2020-11-18 15:46:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HyperOranges @NowaPLS Wtf
1328966562393546755 2020-11-18 15:41:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Stoned_Simian @CrownGamer901 They are, actually.
1328966154732380164 2020-11-18 15:39:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WuYinShenTong No man has standards that low. Degenerate males with no shame? Sure.
1328964738626281474 2020-11-18 15:34:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RicerBikeComrad Good joke. Now make one based off of fact.
1328963471053090816 2020-11-18 15:29:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse This actually comes from the manga adaptation of fire emblem. There's the characters Tina, Al, and Gant.
1328923012318552065 2020-11-18 12:48:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tsukai_Hikushi @Lost_Pause_ I understand how you feel, and I myself struggle with that. But there's no reason to give up on human relationships. It will only lead to sorrow. This feels like a good solution to loneliness, but it only has physical comforts. This will lead to more problems in the future.
1328913167758528512 2020-11-18 12:09:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 White, blue, and orange
1328911125161840640 2020-11-18 12:01:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FindlayNate Damn right. He's a good man.
1328898136329379840 2020-11-18 11:09:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 üòÖ Well, that's very sweet. Sadly, I don't feel the same way about you. But I hope we can remain good friends.

1328888820905992198 2020-11-18 10:32:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap Welll.... alright then!
1328888713049419776 2020-11-18 10:32:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Posting this because reasons. I do want as many to reply as possible, to get a feel for how I need to present myself in the future. Also I'd like some honest feedback. If you have some time, feel free to reply. Thank you!  https://t.co/G7GxURc260

1328887299808124929 2020-11-18 10:26:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I hate to be rude, but you look better without all that make up. The bunny is also very adorable!
1328883208700768256 2020-11-18 10:10:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lib3rty_Prime @TheHinduDindu It can go higher.
1328882977137446929 2020-11-18 10:09:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FellGod_ God you're pathetic.

1328881282433101824 2020-11-18 10:02:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @maggmountains No. I would love for it to be, but it seems too good to be true. Probably right wing propaganda.
1328881012995141632 2020-11-18 10:01:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NMFreed The mummy: demastered
1328880358863958017 2020-11-18 09:59:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PushDustIn No. He's done enough and deserves a long rest.
1328880042722660352 2020-11-18 09:57:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @7striker2 @K1773 @VincentRutel @TeffyTheOtaku There's that, but I think it's important to note that not everyone has this fantasy. I know how to cook and would love to cook for my wife and family. (If I had one)
1328879562718064643 2020-11-18 09:55:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IHaveMyHat @ScottUSMCRet @ahahospitals Ah. So lying to the public is ok when it benefits the corporation? Then how do we know when these fuckers aren't lying?
1328876575547416576 2020-11-18 09:43:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tsukai_Hikushi @Lost_Pause_ The thing that's wrong with this is that it encourages alternatives to human relationships. That should be exceptionally frightening.
1328876357124845571 2020-11-18 09:43:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @K1773 @VincentRutel @TeffyTheOtaku It goes back to the female fantasy: Taming the bad boy, be it an anime villian, foreigner, or vampire. It's no fun trying to tame or attract someone who's already stable.
1328873673516781568 2020-11-18 09:32:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @astral_balmung Your gametes are always preforming mitosis. It would make no difference if you're interacting with a 13 year old fictional character or not. That's why I found it funny.
1328871459138179073 2020-11-18 09:23:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @meganeight @illdiscourse And how do we know this is accurate?
1328870587561865232 2020-11-18 09:20:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kei_Lori Happy birthday!
1328870376475127808 2020-11-18 09:19:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanbyDraws What the fudge is "validating yourself"
1328869883296305160 2020-11-18 09:17:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Paricyte That's the most cursed thing I've seen. And I've seen hentai where a demon baby eats the mom after crawling back in.
1328869336661024768 2020-11-18 09:15:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @punishedsound @LizardWizard___ @SolemnWord @PTSDGuts2 Yeah. Femboys are fucking garbage from a narrative standpoint.
1328868806056431619 2020-11-18 09:13:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Wizard_Predicts @AddVibes I doubt it. No one has done shit so far.
1328868513801498625 2020-11-18 09:11:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 Huh. Well, good thing you're kicking its ass then!
1328867585652383745 2020-11-18 09:08:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ArcherBias It's funny
1328863969407283200 2020-11-18 08:53:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 I don't know. I haven't played it myself. But if someone did, that's kinda funny.  It's a game so I'm not gonna hold strong language against it.
1328863486563258370 2020-11-18 08:51:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @nickcnyc07 @catturd2 That would be great, but I don't think trump and his legal team has the evidence and fortitude to win out supreme court battles.
1328849484865040385 2020-11-18 07:56:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ultra_Always I agree. All talk, no action. Legal battles take time, but if the evidence is this overwhelming, then why are we taking this long to enforce the law?
1328848506275160065 2020-11-18 07:52:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 Well.  I guess that means we throw in the towel!
1328848033132449794 2020-11-18 07:50:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @goukuzaruu That makes it even less credible.
1328847813141270531 2020-11-18 07:49:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeevedLatias Thank you! (I've played through it 10 times, lol)
1328847685294694400 2020-11-18 07:49:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dataspacs I was horny and wanted someone to draw my creative vision.
1328847436966670338 2020-11-18 07:48:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mcorso20 No one cares about "legal" stages. This isn't a court case, silly. It's a game.
1328845568400105473 2020-11-18 07:40:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman I don't even know what a "reclaimed slur" is supposed to be.  And yeah, this is absolute trash. I suck at writing and I can tell you how and why this is all wrong. Just.... oof
1328842949019525132 2020-11-18 07:30:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rakeemspoon Sorry. I prayed for an enjoyable timeline because the rest of my day has been shit. I'll pray for something tame tomorrow.
1328842680596623360 2020-11-18 07:29:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @goukuzaruu Official sources: Fire Emblem Wiki, and that one serenes forest page that hasn't been updated in over 8 years
1328842393861369856 2020-11-18 07:28:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman Oof. Not sure I even want to read this crap
1328841866826162177 2020-11-18 07:26:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 It's a fun time!
1328836749804654597 2020-11-18 07:05:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 Um... Here!  Never been a mutual before so I don't know what to do.
1328785667288129536 2020-11-18 03:42:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kuki_tan I don't even know what fleet is
1328778695662854145 2020-11-18 03:15:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mrEkli Um.. that's uh..   ok then.
1328778388656578561 2020-11-18 03:13:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @woke_warrior @OrwellNGoode George carlin said it best: "White people aren't really white at all. We're different mixtures of pink, yellow,  satton and beige. Is pink not a color?" POC is just that: a tool.
1328775914742812673 2020-11-18 03:04:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrwellNGoode Either we are all "People of Color" or none of us are. That's how it is.

1328768061386727424 2020-11-18 02:32:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SmartConsrvtive @BibsyjeanBarb @JuliansRum Yup. If you're breathing back in bacteria that your body expelled, then of course it's not good for you.
1328764477966323713 2020-11-18 02:18:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD @KrayzAlex92 I know. Most don't have their heads on straight.
1328764080627310592 2020-11-18 02:16:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VtheGreatSage I wish this would return in a mode or maybe implement a mixed mode. 1 kart vs double carts or something. With a large cast of characters, there's no excuse - I can think of a wealth of modes to implement and I've never played any Mario karts beyond DD, 64, and 8.
1328762844071014401 2020-11-18 02:12:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 I may be barking up the wrong tree here, but I never liked the 2 party system. Yeah, we don't have one, technically, but the two parties are so popular, it may as well be. If it had any chance of success, I'd put the Bull Moose party back into the running.
1328762116061466631 2020-11-18 02:09:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Noah is a fun fella to use. His defense is freaking fun to stuff stat boosters into

1328750549798424579 2020-11-18 01:23:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD It used to be all good fun. But now it's trash. If disney didn't fuck up the story, maybe it wouldn't be so shit. It's not like Disney is even capable of good writing at this point
1328750258504011776 2020-11-18 01:22:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> The individual is the greatest minority.

1328746266675748865 2020-11-18 01:06:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FLYTRAPXX You could just draw Marin or Din... you know, the better girls from the franchise. Or ALTTP Zelda. She's always neat
1328745892942389251 2020-11-18 01:04:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @90SZAIN Yes. But what made it even worse was no friends to support me when I struggled with my studies

1328742358637228035 2020-11-18 00:50:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 Good. Lockdowns don't do shit. Masks don't do shit. Treatment, effective medicine, and freedom to choose a healthy lifestyle is what works. I wish I could snap my fingers and just get treatment for my loved ones but no. Reality is too harsh for that shit to work.

1328622062928338944 2020-11-17 16:52:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic You cannot know how to do good without first knowing how to do evil. Makes perfect sense.

1328585244673515529 2020-11-17 14:26:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @juliko25 Apologies are never good enough. Because when we apologize for anything, we get shat on for it. Hypocrisy runs deep.
1328584395108868102 2020-11-17 14:22:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GothicNerdChick I already followed her for it. The amount of kool aid drinkers in here is hilarious.
1328583077841547264 2020-11-17 14:17:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SelenaBestWaifu People like you being extremely petty for something like this is exactly why good people voted for Trump in the first place. Well, that and some other issues. If you don't like it, then fine. Just quit complaining about it.
1328582172748472320 2020-11-17 14:14:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell I hate you
1328581987418968064 2020-11-17 14:13:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Welp. I'm saddened now.  I don't know if I should continue watching the show. T_T
1328579639967625222 2020-11-17 14:04:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Y_R_UHere @BepDelta @wwarrior_1 Control. Power. Through what little means they have.
1328579017063215114 2020-11-17 14:01:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman @BepDelta Oh no please tell me that didn't happen with the recent episodes. I still haven't seen episode 6 yet
1328578106446262272 2020-11-17 13:57:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Staceyraye412 @cjtruth That is absolutely terrifying. Why the fuck is no one doing anything about that?
1328558747912990720 2020-11-17 12:41:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse But that makes no sense
1328547919696437248 2020-11-17 11:58:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Falchion_Z Bartre sucks and so does California
1328541386489163776 2020-11-17 11:32:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Bunnies are nice
1328535073256304641 2020-11-17 11:06:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ScratchyDerose I want to know the date. When was this comic strip published?
1328533115732713472 2020-11-17 10:59:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> People are sick.
1328521970271592448 2020-11-17 10:14:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dci1640 Always has been.  Well.. Not that I can find evidence but you know
1328517326317162498 2020-11-17 09:56:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NightBlader @Gregster1998 Ahh... the good days of avgn.  Back when he had passion for his work.
1328516939203883010 2020-11-17 09:54:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato As am I
1328516611914018816 2020-11-17 09:53:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MakotoFromTokyo Good riddance then
1328510347326722048 2020-11-17 09:28:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiquidChillin You did. Congrats
1328508772390727680 2020-11-17 09:22:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenep123 @catturd2 Us obnoxious aholes need to stick together. Figuratively
1328507958347624449 2020-11-17 09:19:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MakotoFromTokyo Cool. But did you cuddle?
1328507854324703236 2020-11-17 09:18:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @brianycus @MakotoFromTokyo @ChrysaliaSama The act of two mammalian species mating to reproduce offspring. Same with humans. Only difference is "forplay" and consent
1328505472819879936 2020-11-17 09:09:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jack30948 @ArcherBias It's kinnda the same thing
1328504401661730817 2020-11-17 09:05:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 01010011100010010100001100101000100010110010011110111010110000010100101011001100
1328491545528590342 2020-11-17 08:14:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AEGENigma You have to be the most pathetic, ignorant, and mentally challenged individual on planet earth to choose the women.  You can do so much good with 10 million. And we're not even talking about buying the opportunity for several women better than those two. Good you have someone.
1328490654465462279 2020-11-17 08:10:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_EldritchBitch @FEStruggleSus I see no issues.
1328490271391232000 2020-11-17 08:08:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @costtaconcordia No. I'm tired of your ilk. Just because you think something is funny or would fit better doesn't mean it should. Different words have different meanings for a reason.
1328486729628708865 2020-11-17 07:54:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BelaenCarolyn @catturd2 No. And you're right, it was an odd response. Just... most of the artists I follow tend to do work that is erotic in nature.  You can follow whoever you like. Just be careful, because some people love to use this platform to shame others' livelihoods.
1328475329523019776 2020-11-17 07:09:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mike11903952 I agree with that. I yelled at my dad for wearing one IN OUR HOUSE DURING QUARANTINE. I hate these fucking facecondoms.
1328474889565724679 2020-11-17 07:07:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rinofcike @fkacza_ No. She's crazy
1328474744920879110 2020-11-17 07:07:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TenguMan_Zeon @fkacza_ If it isn't obvious, these people have the mental capacity of 17 toothpicks. It's about Trump getting out. Nothing else matters. Not policy, not the country. And if He wins, all of those toothpicks will snap right in two.  And it will be hilarious.
1328473540606169091 2020-11-17 07:02:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus How is this struggle? This is correct.  Honestly just let roy have all 3: Cecilia, Lilina, and Shanna. The rest are boring or have better partner options anyway.
1328472807752216578 2020-11-17 06:59:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mike11903952 I don't get what you're trying to say
1328472269648236546 2020-11-17 06:57:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @thien3000 There's already tons of data showing they don't work. No rtc study proves they do.
1328471869599739905 2020-11-17 06:55:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CharlieDowntown @MattWalshBlog I wore 2 masks at work for about 30 minutes. I started experiencing shortness of breath after anout 20 minutes. You're incredibly stupid.
1328470670653743105 2020-11-17 06:51:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jananie1490 @Jeff6104 @MattWalshBlog If this is true, who is going to pay for the mass manufacturing of hazmat suits? Who will pay for distribution?
1328469776763641863 2020-11-17 06:47:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BelaenCarolyn @catturd2 Don't follow me, or any of the degenerate artists I follow.
1328468340130582533 2020-11-17 06:41:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rakeemspoon I'm more of a rosalina guy but sure, go ahead, bud
1328463827407659010 2020-11-17 06:23:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Makushla4 @hchang316 @AbbVieUS @KFF It's absolutely rediculous. We have plenty of treatment options available and we're not using them because it isn't expensive enough. If these stupid doctors gave a shit and would do their damn jobs, maybe we'd be over with this pandemic fuckery by now!
1328454711406718976 2020-11-17 05:47:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc No, but I agree anyway
1328425627444260869 2020-11-17 03:52:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DineshDSouza @DanBensonMusic That was a man?  Oof
1328423692007772160 2020-11-17 03:44:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HydrocityAct2 That's fine.
1328423274104188929 2020-11-17 03:42:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HydrocityAct2 @Gregster1998 I agree. But it should still be open to criticism.
1328422841881145344 2020-11-17 03:41:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HydrocityAct2 @Gregster1998 Just because it works, doesn't mean its good.
1328406560687665167 2020-11-17 02:36:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic It may be facts, but something seems off. I dunno
1328402716180312068 2020-11-17 02:21:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LrmMedia @Shawnamac_ @juliesmith472 @CourtneyWilding Yup. It's shameful that people don't understand that a wave of disease has nothing to do with human error.
1328349123968458758 2020-11-16 22:48:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JOHNpce2all @kirstiealley There are still counties and cities under lockdown? Who's stupid enough to do that?
1328348009101406208 2020-11-16 22:43:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mougango IF you look at the official sources, you see it's all twitter and press.  He may have won, he may not. We still need to wait and see.
1328346984739201024 2020-11-16 22:39:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Mpuchane @spectatorindex And we know this, how?
1328331634597384200 2020-11-16 21:38:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirstiealley We starwars Episode 2 up in here. But no Yoda to guide usüò¢.  Much to learn, we still have.
1328218238837264387 2020-11-16 14:07:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Avartrius @peachieteas Yes. Just like in Romeo and Juliet. I know what is supposed to be the point, but it fails because it's a cheesy tactic that has little pay off.  It's not new or interesting. It's just cheesy and most players are tired of it.
1328215927243083776 2020-11-16 13:58:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @glacierwaltz_ You really don't get it.  I'm sad
1328205663391150080 2020-11-16 13:18:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @moderatevoterr I'd like to have access too. I'm keeping my options open
1328197055223881728 2020-11-16 12:43:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PamLongCO @Nina96352969 I don't get it
1328190143661023232 2020-11-16 12:16:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HomeAlonRoyal @GPrime85 @jc_stephan The first two I agree with. But letting the horny consume you is as bad as giving it up alltogether.
1328189766173646848 2020-11-16 12:14:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MakoSimp @surfboardmonky @HamonBeat Oh hell no please. Jojo is fun and all, but this doesn't describe the fanbase at all. This is a person who has failed to educate himself on the problems plaguing japan as a nation.
1328188674991853569 2020-11-16 12:10:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Two really good characters from FE 6. One is the best unit in the game and the other is a meme who had a sticker in smash brows brawl
1328187993992155139 2020-11-16 12:07:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Born2b_WILDe I've actually never heard of this. I'll look into it. Maybe there's something I can learn.
1328172572308074498 2020-11-16 11:06:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 In other words.... just heroes things? XD

1328150504841605123 2020-11-16 09:38:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 So am I, who fears.
1328147758675582977 2020-11-16 09:27:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PJiggles_ Cursed
1328147237252321281 2020-11-16 09:25:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ConnorEatsPants Never met a man named Connor who wasn't petty as fuck
1328144965902462976 2020-11-16 09:16:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @captjamestkink @pika_silver @end_spire Ah... DLC. That explains the garbage.
1328086674233053187 2020-11-16 05:25:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Xplodmonky @Gregster1998 I love these two
1328083086827982848 2020-11-16 05:10:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing @FavDockOfShame I actually do
1328082689174474756 2020-11-16 05:09:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nina96352969 @Wizard_Predicts If that happened, I would give them a list of the people to probe, offer up myself as a sacrifice to ensure peace, and just let them go to town
1328082320562282501 2020-11-16 05:07:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Cheeseburger for me.  The other option is frightening
1328055286020575235 2020-11-16 03:20:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pika_silver @end_spire I've never seen this dialogue before, and it obviously looks like an edit. I don't believe you
1328052899100979200 2020-11-16 03:10:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask Indeed
1328052645920186368 2020-11-16 03:09:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda I like the one on the far right the most because having a zelda design similar to that would be interesting
1328052314268184578 2020-11-16 03:08:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SecretNarc @Bbycheese Ok
1328051878064742400 2020-11-16 03:06:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @peachieteas I prefer erika's route because I hate Ephraim and Lyons pathetic speech in Ephraim's chapter 18 is so confusing it makes the Fate timeline look like a children's tale.
1328039708744691718 2020-11-16 02:18:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RukaGang20 @sky_jack01 I second this notion.
1328029920610701314 2020-11-16 01:39:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> So, I'm looking to play FE 4 (Genealogy of the Holy War) again. Any pairing suggestions? I'm looking for stupid/interesting ones. Optimal pairings (like Tailtiu X Lewyn or Lex X Ayra) will be thrown out the window.
1328028129684824067 2020-11-16 01:32:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @peachieteas I can see that. Sorry for flooding your mentions.
1328027295186096131 2020-11-16 01:29:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GigawattPulsar WTF is this bullshit? Not everything is racist. Dumbasses I swear.
1328026864846311427 2020-11-16 01:27:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AyuuniiArt My recommended [beginner] orders, with and w/out availability: 3 Houses, Awakening, Shadow Dragon, Sacred Stones, Shadows of Valentia, and then your choice. Shadow Dragon, Path of Radiance, Blazing Sword, Sacred Stones, 3 Houses, Awakening, then your choice.
1328025859702345728 2020-11-16 01:23:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 A warm Breeze
1328025723714547713 2020-11-16 01:23:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AnabelShiro @peachieteas Trying to pull a Shakespere without understanding why it was effective is how you get a narrative to fall flat on its face.  This ruined the narrative, the story, and the immersion for many fans.

1328021167437983746 2020-11-16 01:04:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AnabelShiro @peachieteas What do you mean, "when"? The very beginning of the game!
1328020825858039809 2020-11-16 01:03:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @silviathepony @Boppyhugs_ right

1328018711232589824 2020-11-16 00:55:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @end_spire That's an edit. I dare you to prove it isn't

1327871184348860416 2020-11-15 15:08:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TehMuteGamer That isn't a woman. That's a beast that seeks the attention of eveything it deems worthy.  When it is actually the least worthy out of the other hellcreatures.
1327870236092198912 2020-11-15 15:05:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @undeadscribe @DendyReadman I have yet to find one smart person who takes this woman seriously.  Oh, there's an issue?  Sure, putting more wahmen on it will solve the problem!  This isn't a flex tape commercial. It's not as easy as 123
1327868798918152194 2020-11-15 14:59:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tracey103172 @my3monkees @Wyn1745 I agree.  Yeah, these people have every right to a peaceful march/protest.  But given the situation these days, it's best to not get your children involved.

1327865753161396225 2020-11-15 14:47:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato He does look handsome.  But FE 7 is a klusterfuck so Eh
1327865428052414464 2020-11-15 14:46:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 The first season was alright. It's the later ones that are... devoid of vision. Lots of plot holes, one would say. But if you like it in spite of any flaws, then you're stronger than me. I commend you for enjoying something I couldn't.
1327849065778966529 2020-11-15 13:41:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpringSteps You got a point
1327847292670500865 2020-11-15 13:33:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CodeMonkeyZ @AddVibes I misunderstood the question and chose "no and yes"
1327846932652371968 2020-11-15 13:32:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PamabamaMia @elenochle I know. She looks like what you'd tell your kids is living in the closet at night
1327845046079664128 2020-11-15 13:25:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_DCode__ Not getting shannan is why I quit FEH
1327844635486646275 2020-11-15 13:23:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 I personally hate the show. It tries to do several things at once and it just... it ruins several characters for me. Plus Korra is bland and unremarkable. But that's just me. Watch it if you like

1327823056589479937 2020-11-15 11:57:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse Sleep staff him

1327820058391932928 2020-11-15 11:45:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Oopsies10 No, they would.  She's a fucking murderer and a war loving dictator. She is the villian and I will never accept this bitch.
1327819604333309954 2020-11-15 11:43:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @duskfleurcos @FutureVisionYT Means the same thing.
1327819331951087617 2020-11-15 11:42:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FutureVisionYT The moment I wanted to see Edlegard burn.
1327819067995148289 2020-11-15 11:41:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @infactanoose For once... we agree. Anyone who thinks Sacae is good from a gameplay standpoint should be ostracized.  Sorry, but tougher enemies and bullshit bosses aren't fun.
1327817143912689665 2020-11-15 11:34:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone If we're talking about Last airbender, then yes, hell yes. I would bet the lives of my entire family when I say that it is one of the greatest animated shows ever created. It tackles mature themes with universal understanding and every character grows. 10/10. Have fun, Goose. :)
1327816367853203458 2020-11-15 11:31:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 @Goosaphone Last I heard, Greg here was on episode 6. By episode 42, He will be used to Inuyasha and Kagome shouting at eachother 12 times per episode from 50 meters away.
1327815825441640448 2020-11-15 11:28:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt There's that, But I would say that you're better known for Pit X Viridi than kid icarus pr0n
1327791668905512960 2020-11-15 09:52:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Sounds like one hell of a time
1327791165060608001 2020-11-15 09:50:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gatorinthe603 @InfidelAngela Here and there, yes. There are bad people from every walk of life and every ethnicity. It shouldn't matter if there is a black person among them or not.
1327790396051689472 2020-11-15 09:47:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gaudemateria @InfidelAngela No, i think they need to be repelled and neutralized.

1327786024785817600 2020-11-15 09:30:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD I hope you're alright. Same to whomever you live with.
1327758949328752640 2020-11-15 07:42:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic I wish there was a way to do this without ending lives, but sooner or later there won't be any other option. T_T
1327757443691139072 2020-11-15 07:36:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Meru from Monster Mozume?  Also, quick question: Do you think Botan would look bad in BotW Link's outfit?
1327754735491964928 2020-11-15 07:26:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kaiden_zavier @TheSurvivor2077 ..... nani
1327754583918178304 2020-11-15 07:25:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xanafraud @xxxtactician1 I know. He went mad, and wanted his wife back, he'd go after his own country to make it happen.
1327749346180427776 2020-11-15 07:04:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Wait What!? This happened?  I don't remember this.  Well... makes sense because I haven't used Pelleas in years
1327749016243875840 2020-11-15 07:03:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @flugie93 I want to hold her hand

If we were more focused on early stage recovery and allowing citizens to have options for medicine and not just one vaccine (as we should in a capitalist economy) then this wouldn't be an issue.
1327747345610665986 2020-11-15 06:56:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @louisskundt @UnboundSmith @ChefGruel @msanonymousme Well said

1327737961857867777 2020-11-15 06:19:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xxxtactician1 From someone who is extremely desperate for love, I can empathize with Orson, if nothing else.
1327736040476585986 2020-11-15 06:11:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Rompepollo Sorry I just remembered. I feel like when you go through the game and you rescue all the cats, they're like this:  https://t.co/NaoDOtQNfM

1327722985411719168 2020-11-15 05:20:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @peachieteas Fire Emblem Echoes (SOV) Ruining the plot of the game when you start it.  That annoyed me.  It would have infuriated me if I hadn't played gaiden before.
1327714374505652224 2020-11-15 04:45:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xxxtactician1 That's Hicks, right? Big Daddy Hicks? Pls

1327698098437623808 2020-11-15 03:41:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WorstEvieMainNA @Ct1YoFP Its a play on words for a popular indian dish that has a key ingredient of goat milk
1327664286441861131 2020-11-15 01:26:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FtLaudGolfer @catturd2 Oregon, and California
1327541119186587649 2020-11-14 17:17:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fuppfuc69 It looks like a cross between Tom Nook(animal crossing), Arin Hanson(game grumps), and Edelgard(Fire Emblem 3H).
1327539823113080833 2020-11-14 17:12:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus The reason we know this is correct is that hundreds, even thousands of Americans have gone into poverty back when the first lockdown happened. My boss's friend had to shut down her business that she opened on January 2nd. The cure must never be worse than the disease.

1327488980858904576 2020-11-14 13:50:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ct1YoFP Nope. The best
1327488894875684864 2020-11-14 13:49:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ct1YoFP Goat milk is great. If you have Freyja on your side, you can open an indian restaurant and make all kinds of dishes.  No, really. Goat milk is used in lots of currys, chutneys and the ever-popular chicken-tiki-naesala. (Chicken tika masala)
1327488272436760582 2020-11-14 13:47:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkreaperToky Honestly, I don't care what it is. I just care you try your best.

1327487160568717312 2020-11-14 13:42:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone I agree. At the very least, it shows respect for the people who fight and die for your right to live freely and have the freedoms you do.  I get there's some message to not doing so, but there are far better ways to do it than disrespecting our veterans and founding fathers.
1327486653804531712 2020-11-14 13:40:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc I'm amazed I have more than 5.

1327470197960290305 2020-11-14 12:35:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Imagine thinking that Ayra X Holyn/chakrbjfkdjhr being encouraged means it's not incest.

We should focus on recovery and trying to let everyone have access to multiple kind of cures and treatments.

1327429795085512705 2020-11-14 09:55:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheSurvivor2077 Then you are lost. I'm serious when I say: You will never be worth more than the boot that steps on you. Pathetic.

1327354031321346048 2020-11-14 04:53:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> 100% the truth. This is what a smart person looks like, people!

1327259998133555200 2020-11-13 22:40:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BeeInTheBreeze @catturd2 You think biden or anyone else in office could have the power to do differently.  My god, you're delusional.  Plus, it's around 20,000. Not 200,000. Added an extra zero by mistake.
1327258988497543168 2020-11-13 22:36:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus Same. I need to finish/successfully start my 9 day run of Majora's mask.  But for real,  that wouldn't be good.
1327258675589894147 2020-11-13 22:35:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap Chef Alton Brown has a good mushroom stroganoff.  I'm sure you can find stuff online if your search hard enough.
1327258237419270144 2020-11-13 22:33:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap Eat eggs for breakfast often. Eggs and spinach are both good sources of zinc, which is important for your body's health. Cut tomatoes from your diet, too. Same with unnatural sugars. You probably won't see this, but it's important stuff.
1327256898266075136 2020-11-13 22:27:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jennacon I don't either. I'm just trying to figure things out.

It's sick. But at least he's asking questions like a normal perosn. I respect him for that, at least.

1327132865092591616 2020-11-13 14:15:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> It is centered around a horny protagonist who uses his power of being horny to give energy to the girls that he befriends so they can fight the underworld or something like that. The main girl of the show has long red hair and is flat chested. First ep starts in the rain. Help
1327132596703211520 2020-11-13 14:14:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Ok. I am trying to find out the name of an ecchi anime that has action scenes.  AND NO IT IS NOT HighSchool DXD I just want to find out what this anime is and the main character and girl both go to school.

1327106440302108672 2020-11-13 12:30:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MaiOw0 @TerjeCS @TraaaashPanda So every country should ban the prospect of free speech to please the people who are so easily offended and cannot move on with their lives? Gee. I wonder how that would work.... hm...

1327099929442054145 2020-11-13 12:04:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @infactanoose Not sure anymore. Sometimes my intellect goes in circles to the point where my logic becomes dangerous and stupid when I try to be well informed and articulate.  Thanks
1327099483117801472 2020-11-13 12:02:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m Well... let's just say you don't want to see some of my YouTube comments from 4/3 years ago.
1327098838184833024 2020-11-13 11:59:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m Oof. Well, I got a strike from twatter once and i deleted my other account because of it.  Now I'm here mostly for the art.  And thank you.   I try to be as level headed as possible.
1327098567060824067 2020-11-13 11:58:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DendyReadman Thank you!
1327089356235018241 2020-11-13 11:22:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m I wish I had enough confidence to make such a decision. Technically, a life starts at sperm. But millions of men worldwide ejaculate without means of repoduction. And we don't charge them with murder. It should be based on what the situation calls for. That's what I think.
1327083317322276864 2020-11-13 10:58:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m Furthermore, regardless of what people think, aborting a baby is taking its life prematurely. We need to use this method extremely carefully. Otherwise its just murder.
1327082486095110144 2020-11-13 10:54:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m No. I am in support of *limited* abortion. It should not be used as a tool for birth control for selfish women. Just because I think it can be used to help women who may give birth to a dead baby or cause her death, doesn't mean I support selfish cunts who use it as a cop out.
1327066457289728000 2020-11-13 09:51:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZuttoKiller @mugendaiyo @poochy_lily You got me there.  Now go rob a bank too you little shite
1327053575009296385 2020-11-13 09:00:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC No. As innocent as you were, some of your opinions are absolute trash

1327021241350369280 2020-11-13 06:51:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ckglander @DC_Draino @cain_nate No it shouldn't. It's not as black and white as you say. Maybe you should think more about why it is implemented and not being so short sighted to say "it's murder". Yeah, it's sad when you deconstruct a baby for personal gain. But sometimes it has necessity.
1327020050595844096 2020-11-13 06:46:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @legamunt Ok, this makes even less sense I don't understand what the hell I'm looking at
1327019875865399298 2020-11-13 06:46:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m I 100% agree
1327019611112484864 2020-11-13 06:45:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC I'm actually happy. YouTube rewind of the last couple years have been absolute shit.  I'm glad I don't have to watch cringy abominations (dumbass folks) use terrible music to try and relate to an audiance it knows nothing about. TLDR: Ding Dong, your opinion is wrong
1326979420192706560 2020-11-13 04:05:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime @SYG64 Ok but what about the back and hands? No one ever talks about hands.  Especially when the index finger is pressing the roof of the mouth as you---  *is bonked for being too horny*
1326978794532564992 2020-11-13 04:02:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ProsafiaGaming I don't know what you're on about. The second model is amazing

1326976318811090948 2020-11-13 03:53:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @legamunt I... I need context, my friend.
1326975893449957381 2020-11-13 03:51:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Dark hair automatically looks more natural on you. (Probably my personal bias showing but what are ya gonna do)
1326975647818911745 2020-11-13 03:50:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @infactanoose Oh yeah? Good thing I like hands!  I'm a real life Yoshikage Kira! Take that, Mr. Noose Gilmore!

It smells awful, can damage the drain pipe, and can lead to clogging and excess bacteria in the shower that can, in turn,  lead to increased chances of getting athletes foot or other infections.  Don't do this.
1326973265605234688 2020-11-13 03:40:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZiggyFreed0m I didn't know that. If this is the plan for abortion nationwide (medical exceptions and life and death) I think I can agree with it. Sorry for typing a long thread like this. I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents from what I knew.
1326972629719408641 2020-11-13 03:38:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate We can ban it for people who abuse the process to get out of responsibility. But banning this as a solution to other events outside of our control isn't something I agree with. I don't know everything about abortion or its history, but I want things to be fair and manageable. 9/9
1326971912354934797 2020-11-13 03:35:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate I'm not saying that these instances cannot be solved by other means.(adoption, financial services, therapy for miscarrying, ect.) I don't blame people for these things because not all life can be controlled. And for some, abortion is a tool that is neccessary for them. 8/?
1326970941654577159 2020-11-13 03:31:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate And verified/proven cases of rape causing a pregnancy that was not concented by the mother should also be allowed. Obviously, this should be taken care of as early as possible. Late trimester abortions for this matter is an excuse, and not a solution. 7/?
1326970477659779076 2020-11-13 03:29:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate And it isn't always the fault of the mother. Yet Another thing to consider is rape. I understand that men are victims to rape as well as women. I also understand that rape can be lied about, which makes the case of an unwanted pregnancy via rape less common. It still exists. 6/?
1326969748727488515 2020-11-13 03:26:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate A mom's life is as important as a child's. Some may say otherwise, but when you think about it, saying that it is God's will that a mother dies just because she wants to be a happy mother with a healthy child... I can't believe that. In this case, it should be up to the mom. 5/?
1326969059741741067 2020-11-13 03:24:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate That alone is important to think about, but there exists the possibility of the Mother's life also being endangered by a birth. It exists, and as sad as it is, sometimes mistakes are made before people realize the severe detrimental effects of them in this respect. 4/?
1326968100210827281 2020-11-13 03:20:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate There are hundreds of birth cases where babies are born dead. And there are times where, even before birth, there is notice that a child will be born with a defect that CANNOT be fixed with modern medicine and technology.  That is a sad state that must be considered. 3/?
1326967136523345931 2020-11-13 03:16:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate That alone is deplorable and reeks of irresponsibility.  I condemn anyone who thinks abortion is a "tagback", or a get out of jail freecard for lack of responsibility and consideration for healthy life choices. However, that doesn't mean that abortion is black and white. 2/?
1326966494765453312 2020-11-13 03:14:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate Let me clarify what I mean. There are undoubtedly women out there who abort their child due to concerns of finances and regret,  nomatter the actual numbers. Doing so means that you had sex or got pregnant without weighing the real world consequences of such actions. 1/?
1326965944028180481 2020-11-13 03:11:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DC_Draino @cain_nate For me, it's almost the opposite. I know masks do next to nothing in terms of life and death - hundreds of studies prove this. But abortion is a slightly more complex issue. Banning it won't solve all the problems. I think it should be legal and allowed. But we MUST have limits.

The game would need to be reworked from the ground up, and its dungeons would need to be redesigned.  The joy cons are not as accurate and would ruin the precise actions needed from the player.

1326723297623552002 2020-11-12 11:07:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rakeemspoon Toph is a fantastic character.

1326593548171481088 2020-11-12 02:32:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InactiveWindman Wait. The current electoral or the hypothetical one with trump on top? Because I'm afraid all of this evidence will be for nought
1326593158663335937 2020-11-12 02:30:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS You win some, you lose some.  Not saying which this is because I want to avoid horny jail
1326592756307943427 2020-11-12 02:28:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 Damn right
1326592596022583298 2020-11-12 02:28:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Bitnerd_ Good. Exercise and fresh air are good for people.  Teach him to be healthy from a young age!
1326592195361705985 2020-11-12 02:26:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Spaghetti alla puttanesca was made using *common ingredients and not necessarily ones that were proven to be fantastic together. It was literally a prostitute who threw cheap ingredients together and made it work. I think it started in Naples.  Not to be confused with nipples.
1326591684617138177 2020-11-12 02:24:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse I can explain at least 1 perspective, if you like.
1326591412855517185 2020-11-12 02:23:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato Forgive me, but... The fuck is wrong with you?
1326590522551578632 2020-11-12 02:20:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OkLoluwu If it's not harming anyone, there's no problem, right?
1326396581558542336 2020-11-11 13:29:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @lporiginalg Ok but what about ethnorocks?  You know? The freaking rocks that have ethnicities like us?  What about them?   I'm sorry, I'm getting tired.

1326395834532040704 2020-11-11 13:26:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MortonCandy @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump How do you know that these things were not just slapped on there to combat allegations?  People lie. People can type and print lies. So how can we verify this accuracy?   This is how people argue there is no evidence of irregularities.
1326395201871622145 2020-11-11 13:23:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jayblackisfunny Are you sure you're not a Jay Black man? Eh? Ehh??    I'll see myself out.
1326394661494267906 2020-11-11 13:21:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @alonsovalenciav @BrianAngelle @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump I disagree. While yes, it isn't helpful in securing election results, but it lets people know what citizens in certain areas value.  Then you use that to work out polices that benefit those people, in a fair, regulated way.
1326393579258974211 2020-11-11 13:17:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @2termstrump @newsmax I voted for the guy, but mostly because his opponent was fishy.  She's a marine but not a biologist? And yet she's fishy.  That ain't right.
1326393046049689600 2020-11-11 13:15:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Blun_Z I only know of flame insignia. Apparently it has good waifus
1326391670615715847 2020-11-11 13:09:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus @thebradfordfile Yup. It's scary. Then again, I suppose I'm the scary one, having an anime profile.  I mean... it's far scarier than actual war.  Or so they tell me.
1326391107522064384 2020-11-11 13:07:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BrentDyer Brent, as much as I agree with you on this stuff, those sunglasses are lacking.  If you styled your hair differently, then it could be pretty nice, but I don't think those glasses have what it takes to pull off the look.
1326390033700544513 2020-11-11 13:03:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ymirakichi @zassyu2_ero Well done!
1326389411496472579 2020-11-11 13:00:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skye_magus @thebradfordfile That's.... wow. I follow several dumbasses on this site, but mostly for art.  But this is a whole level of stupid
1326389039092609025 2020-11-11 12:59:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Merchant_Salt I know! If they wanna live happy, they can, but a nation of them wouldn't last because* of the inability to reproduce
1326386683781275648 2020-11-11 12:50:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime *fictional children. Not literal. Need I explain further?

1326359158204100615 2020-11-11 11:00:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PJiggles_ This is sadly true
1326358812484399110 2020-11-11 10:59:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nyarlethrotep @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku Hm.... true....  yeah.... however, I don't care! I'm probably going to forget this fella anyways so it doesn't matter to me. Most of the people I see on this site I forget within hours.  But I guess that's more social media than the people themselves. Yeah. Good day to you.
1326357300181950464 2020-11-11 10:53:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ebinkuu I never knew I needed this until now...
1326357113896128514 2020-11-11 10:52:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Blun_Z If you do, take your bad opinions with you.  It's only like 1 or 2... and mythra, but yeah. I do hope you stick around though.
1326356737105006593 2020-11-11 10:51:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCyanYoh Then read up on economics.
1326356623548444672 2020-11-11 10:50:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @itanimeirl I don't know. As long as there's organization and it doesn't keep the person from a responsible life, then it's 100% ok!  Anyone who says otherwise is a dumbass.
1326355725652779008 2020-11-11 10:47:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nortuet I'm not into men, but many men and women are. So keep it open for them. I can just ignore it.
1326355411654635521 2020-11-11 10:45:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nortuet Yup
1326355234743005184 2020-11-11 10:45:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Quickalas Ok, cool.
1326354919339798529 2020-11-11 10:43:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nyarlethrotep @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku No, the problem isn't me. It's the people who say truths are lies with no evidence. He posted nothing to back it up and didn't confront me about it in a DM. Besides. He is a brainwashed libral anyway.
1326354529579888640 2020-11-11 10:42:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @butcha_u Is that your cat? 0w0

1326351415623774208 2020-11-11 10:29:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nyarlethrotep @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku Because I realized that he wasn't worth it. Believing lies with no mind of his own is a sad venture. I blocked him after giving him a chance to message me. He didn't. Oh well.
1326347432582664193 2020-11-11 10:14:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 RIP Tucker
1326344607802806272 2020-11-11 10:02:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @amdowdican I'm happy that some people outside of america can see through the lies. thank you for the hope.
1326342993071263745 2020-11-11 09:56:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 XD Yeah, that sounds kinda silly. But it doesn't change the fact that there's voter fraud and people are lying through their teeth. Edlegard did it. Why not every biden supporter?
1326342215954821122 2020-11-11 09:53:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kymmafox Looks fantastic!
1326341267433861120 2020-11-11 09:49:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MrMusic92587 @FXdestination The mortality rate is who survives, right? Just making sure, because I get the feeling some people have the idea backwards.
1326340998570577920 2020-11-11 09:48:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Flamingoii1 I don't get why you say a flu shot doesn't work. The CCP virus, sure. Not taking that vaccine ever. Not to be rude, but when you say that flu shots don't work, then you sound like one of those anti-vaxers.
1326339702362939392 2020-11-11 09:43:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 I'm gonna sound dumb. What is "recanting"?
1326298095026581504 2020-11-11 06:58:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RoyalUltimax @ProsafiaGaming The original is absolutely better, but yeah I can see why. Sometimes games that express stress and terror aren't for everyone.
1326297665328517120 2020-11-11 06:56:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ProsafiaGaming Spyro, enter the dragonfly.  Oh, and All starwars shovelware.
1326296794205188102 2020-11-11 06:52:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeevedLatias Pineapple pizza isn't horrible. It's just different. In combination with canadian bacon and some cilantro makes a surprisingly decent combo.
1326296415501504512 2020-11-11 06:51:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeclercCrimea I don't know. Probably because other countries' legal systems have attempted to fuck over japanese tradition and artistic freedom with less than what we're arguing about and thinking that they deserve vengance inacted upon them for sheer idiocy, thus leading to full defense.
1326289689406550016 2020-11-11 06:24:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ttFPark @Karbuitt I hate horny police. I myself am one of them, but I will defend people's rights to draw shit until the end of time.
1326289249331769345 2020-11-11 06:22:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt Because art as an expressive medium is harmful, apparently.
1326289112299679750 2020-11-11 06:22:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Devil Lysithea sounds really fun.
1326288079192285184 2020-11-11 06:18:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Guys he's got a point
1326287898187091970 2020-11-11 06:17:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeclercCrimea Because creative expression is important and should not be punished via police or jailtime when our tax money should go towards actual problems that can be solved. You're acting like quote retweeting my statements is going to make more of an impact on my beliefs.
1326286551333081088 2020-11-11 06:12:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 If you go on and on about suicide then it's an issue. As someone who has attempted suicide 8 times in his life, I know what it's like. But acting like psychological illness or depression does not play a part in this is absolutely rancid.
1326286171182407680 2020-11-11 06:10:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Acuriousbun @CyberTheblade For... what?
1326283525310582787 2020-11-11 06:00:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HavenlyButts @LabEcchi Oof
1326283012372393985 2020-11-11 05:58:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 These people are mentally ill. That's what's happening.
1326280063810154496 2020-11-11 05:46:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deduesday1 Because newsflash: It isn't real. You people are so demented that it's tough to take you seriously. Pedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent children. Lolicon may fall into that category, but it isn't the same thing. Why? It doesn't effect or harm real people. End of story.
1326269655489589250 2020-11-11 05:05:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OkLoluwu I am not defending pedophilia. I am defending lolita and lolicon.  There is a difference between fiction and reality. If you can make that distinction, you are fine. If you cannot, then you should seek help. It's that simple. Acting on it is a whole different thing.
1326268667491979270 2020-11-11 05:01:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeclercCrimea @ArcherBias Then how do you explain the countless deaths caused by video game violence?  You know, the statistic that doesn't exist?  Because killing someone in a game means the exact same thing as killing someone in real life. Its the same thing here. And your refusal to accept it hurts.
1326267994863972367 2020-11-11 04:58:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Dewott1 Um... that is not what a lolicon is. I feel saddened that you are saying that people who like lolis are the same as those who assult people without provocation.
1326257254061010944 2020-11-11 04:15:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask Oh, nice! I hope you have fun!!
1326257050276532229 2020-11-11 04:14:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PBF77725 Or something a moron would say.  Seriously, does no one know what pedophilia actually is?
1326256887793414145 2020-11-11 04:14:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Dewott1 @ArcherBias Right. But in the case of animation and drawn fiction, it's still better than actual pedophilia.
1326256710911201282 2020-11-11 04:13:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ArcherBias MAP is a pedophile. Same thing, just nicer wording.  Lolicons are not the same as pedos. Am I a lolicon? No, but I don't have an issue with Lolis. Does that make me a sexual predator?  Hm....  So please think about what you're saying before spouting random crap. I won't fuck off.
1326256150787055616 2020-11-11 04:11:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CyberTheblade @Nux_Taku No nonsense.  Just DM me, and we can compare statistics, data, sources, and come to an agreement.  Sound good?
1326241716156948481 2020-11-11 03:14:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CyberTheblade @Nux_Taku My dad is positive and I'm too busy helping him recover to get infected directly. And obviously you're going to catch shit if someone coughs directly into your mouth. Use real arguments next time, buddy.  Or better yet, dm me with your "evidence" and I'll prove you wrong.

1326237413832863745 2020-11-11 02:56:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku Oh. And a wave when concerning viral transmission has nothing to do with human error. It's all seasonal.

1326236844359626753 2020-11-11 02:54:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku I've stopped listening to fox for months. Most of what I say comes from over 50 hours of research and logical reasoning. Tracking is a control tool. Masks don't work. If countries implemented mask mandates because they do not work, then therin lies the stuoudeat plight of 2020.

There's hundreds of verifiable evidence to suggest that the virus is not as big of an issue as idiots like you claim. Masks don't work for viral infections. There is evidence of voter fraud. HCQ was tested with biased outcomes. Motherfucker I could go on.
1326234926379905030 2020-11-11 02:47:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CyberTheblade @Nux_Taku You misquoted trump 4 times. Try again, you ignoramus.  Oh, and the virus is weaker than the flu to people who don't have underlying health conditions. I've done my research and you've parroted the left like it's the gospel.
1326234258449502208 2020-11-11 02:44:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MasksworkMofo @Nux_Taku Yeah. Dr. Anthony Fauchi.  Most people get trump's quotes wrong because of paraphrasing and misleading data. 2021 is gonna be worse because morons will never accept reality or verifiable data.
1326233720936951809 2020-11-11 02:42:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MontaleAnthony @Nux_Taku Yup. Dumbasses can't even remember the 2000 election.  Or what the CDC states or what doctors say and then pedal back on because they're "wrong".  Jeez. Tons of fucking idiots here. Nux included. At least he has the decency to have his trolling apply to both sides.
1326233217167486976 2020-11-11 02:40:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CyberTheblade @Nux_Taku Don't need to continue. You're a fucking moron and you have no clue what you're talking about.

1326030739259977728 2020-11-10 13:15:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @recordalbumdude TLDR: The story doesn't suck. There are multiple stories juggled together with a world that feels alive and characters that are lovable despite the generic setbacks. The gameplay is fantastic and the music was wrongfully robbed a spot as best sound track of 2018 via game awards.
1326029876814618624 2020-11-10 13:12:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @recordalbumdude The characters can be cheesy. The gameplay is fun and deep, with a system that makes random encounters decisive and interesting. And the Sound track is fantastic. One of the best out there. Yeah, some tracks are generic fantasy, but it's good enough that you love it anyway.
1326029248566611968 2020-11-10 13:09:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @recordalbumdude @Nintendeal The stories' plots, I mean. But the characters and how the syory is executed comes off as heartfelt and full of passion. Yes, there's not that much interaction between characters outside of the individual stories, but it doesn't nees that as a focus.
1326028693404323840 2020-11-10 13:07:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @recordalbumdude @Nintendeal This will take a bit to explain.  Firstly, I would reccomend you watch KingK's video on octopath for a short summary.  But here's my take on it: The story is satisfyingly average, with gameplay that is simple yet deep.  The stories follow the 8 characters, and most are generic.
1326027527488475136 2020-11-10 13:02:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cjtruth @AddVibes I love it! I just hope we don't advance technology too far that we start to live in a virtual matrix just like the movie. It frightens me to think that people could live fake lives and never know true happiness or passion. It's why I hate VR.
1326026819716456450 2020-11-10 13:00:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JMG_PartyBean FINALLY. Stupid orcs get what they freakin' DESERVE. Ahem.  Sorry... got a bit off track there.  Nice one.

1326023252662218752 2020-11-10 12:45:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WindIsBestMagic @Jack30948 @Swift_Saturn It's reccomend you brush your teeth afterwards.  And the damage isn't too noticable unless you eat like 3 or 4 large bags in about 3 weeks? Maybe four?  But yeah.  Don't eat too much salt and Vinegar. Not very good for ya, mah boi.
1326022731108929536 2020-11-10 12:43:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Swift_Saturn Ayyyy.  Oh, and side note, there is, to my knowledge, a spicy barbecue kimchi recipe (I think with bacon?) That is super good to try if you like both BBQ and asian food.
1326022208385404929 2020-11-10 12:41:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WindIsBestMagic @Jack30948 @Swift_Saturn You don't eat a full bag in a single sitting unless its super small.  But yes, if you eat too much, it actually starts to damage your tounge and the gum lining. Same with the roof.  I love salt and Vinegar, but it needs to be handled responsibility.
1326021678351196161 2020-11-10 12:39:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Swift_Saturn Nope. BBQ is best reserved for actual cooking/grilling/smoking delicacies. Salt and Vinegar chips must stay.

Tucker is knowledgeable, but not a 100% source for accurate news. He is entertainment more than a reporter, but that does not mean he is a liar or a sell out. I don't like fox news that much, but tucker has a good head on his shoulders.

1325972150923223040 2020-11-10 09:22:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @arttie77 @catturd2 And BECAUSE it should be a choice (it should, we have the freedom to choose our method of safety) is exactly why we need alternatives like HCQ or gin and tonic. So everyone who this vaccine won't work for has a way to protect themeselves.  Very simple stuff.
1325966604874682369 2020-11-10 09:00:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @3days3nights @AddVibes No, it should be a crime. Period. Hate has nothing to do with actual legal interference.  Intent does not equal hate.

1325918240317583360 2020-11-10 05:48:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gamer_fungus @HaloCEofficial Same. I used to love rainbows because of all the colors and it being a true symbol of beauty in the world.  Now? It's shoehorned into every major corporation and "movement" like its going out of style. It's annoying and that initial impression of beauty is ruined with propaganda.

But not the aerosols. Aerosols can get through masks because water molecules smaller than .125 microns can carry virons at .03 microns. Those go through masks and contaminate people. 1/2

1325520854990647296 2020-11-09 03:29:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lost_Pause_ Ashley deserves to know, too. Like it or not, being honest with her is important. Especially if you want to keep a healthy and strong relationship. But yes, apart from that, no one needs to know what you searched for as long as it's not dangerous.
1325520257784700935 2020-11-09 03:27:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PlatinumUnit @theomegayato I agree. But I think her innocence makes it so she never ever used it before the timeskip

It should go without saying that personality is a major factor in choosing a partner. But if you've already made that distinction and your partner is healthy, then you can have the war over appeal.  This is mostly for fictional characters.

1325464700864376833 2020-11-08 23:46:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UnLockii With art commissions it's difficult when you factor other artists as competitors. The value and demand of your art should determine the price. However, the difficulty with that is that the quality only goes upward as drawing is a process of constant improvement.
1325463485321531393 2020-11-08 23:41:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PoorlyAgedStuff It still has aged well. AP has freedon, not power.

1325445026147692545 2020-11-08 22:28:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ylissean_Prince I made this account a month ago because I removed my year old account out of distain for Twitter's stupid policies. As for the anime avatar, that is irrelevant. I have informed opinions because I do research and think critically. Try your best to do the same.
1325444096723480577 2020-11-08 22:24:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_deeKei @UltimaShadowX The reason is because Japanese people are smart. They care about the environment and care about making good choices - it's partly why they choose job stability over having families. But that's another discussion. Anyway, looking at evidence with a critical eye is important.

1325323061239963648 2020-11-08 14:23:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @InfernoOmni Oh boo hoo. Let people have their fun. Some of us have lives to live. Oh,  and the electricity you use? Yeah someone has to leave their home to go and work at facilities that provide services to your home. Lockdowns don't work because they cripple the people.
1325322327207374848 2020-11-08 14:20:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tridisart Your Felicia art was always one of my favorites. :)
1325309596613881857 2020-11-08 13:30:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I'm tired of politics (90% drained from it because 2020 is shit).  What's everyone's favorite dessert? Mine is Carrot Cake!
1325309049735421955 2020-11-08 13:27:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen I didn't look into the replies where the malice waited to strike.  Like if you don't get it, that's fine. If you don't understand and don't find it appealing or attractive, that's fine. But don't act like others are the scum of the earth for liking it.
1325308516492587008 2020-11-08 13:25:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen Ok nevermind. I read the other replies by him/her.... Stupid
1325308327686004738 2020-11-08 13:25:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen ?  There's no malice in this. Who crawled into your pants?

1325298988543782912 2020-11-08 12:47:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VialNite Shoot I dug in too deep
1325298896181092352 2020-11-08 12:47:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VialNite Velouria is the best doggy I've ever seen and I want her to bite me without that restrictive muzzle of cloth.  Her ears are so.... I mean this art is fantastic!! No, really it is!  I just wanted the clout I swear
1325298302951231488 2020-11-08 12:45:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Iron_Mouse He would. Because all Vtubers are on the path to depravity
1325293428008251393 2020-11-08 12:25:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Monunga_ So having integrity and a heart means I'm a coward? I'd fight you right now. Come on, bitch. Bring it.
1325292794299232256 2020-11-08 12:23:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @epichexmania @ThiccWithaQ No. Ryona is literally getting beat up or abused.  In most hentai I've read it's mostly about being forced and assulted.  Which isn't sexy. It's just terrible.
1325291842364186624 2020-11-08 12:19:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shmentai_ May I send you the sauce of the 3rd worst hentai I've ever seen? and no, not a direct link

I mean there was one hentai where a woman's legs and arms were amputated and then g@ngr^ped and then a gun was put in her b^^^y and then the trigger was pulled.  After seeing that one.... I don't think many can scar me apart from ntr

1325269626859753472 2020-11-08 10:51:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 There's pushing yourself to overcome challenges and become stronger, wiser, more skilled, and confident.   Then there's masochism which, in this case, only exists to further pain and suffering. Oh well. I will pay you VIA paypal to use Kagero
1325266684731666432 2020-11-08 10:39:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I can actually think of several reasons not to. Like... it being Revelations

1325265984219967488 2020-11-08 10:36:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Didn't you hear? With biden as president, the Covid is gone! Come on, man!
1325265845313040385 2020-11-08 10:36:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GiggukAZ This is hilarious. Not factual, but hilarious! And no, he can't beat Goku. He can't even finish a sentance without stuttering.
1325265594720145409 2020-11-08 10:35:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ashterissk I apologize for being rude, but why are you saying "they"? Was nomad nb?
1325265343129022468 2020-11-08 10:34:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Good!  Always good to have alternatives! Without them, Patreon could be as unfair as it wants. I may support you in the next year or so when I'm living on my own

1325238786360561664 2020-11-08 08:48:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Anna_Snackz Did you know this is specifically why this person did a cartwheel? Also, he's still president until the election is litigated, and until janurary.

1325211131967795204 2020-11-08 06:58:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Cstorm1166 @Actually_Tina Either they like that trump is gone because he exposed corruption, OR, they don't know what marxism is and they just want to be hip and cool. A Shame.

This whole thing is like bush and gore all over again. The best part? We probably won't know the true victor until 60 days from now.
1325209917968486400 2020-11-08 06:54:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RiseFallNick Strangely, this is my most recently saved picture. Kinda funny.  https://t.co/AJswe0mP5d
1325192309747691521 2020-11-08 05:44:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @killeraxekagero No. It's the worst Fire Emblem game, period. Stfu
1325187627381821440 2020-11-08 05:25:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Yup. Just like 2000. Interesting, even.
1325186809819754496 2020-11-08 05:22:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GodotIsW8ing4U @TheHinduDindu And marx's Utopian philosophy led to millions of deaths. Revolutionary my ass.
1325186597873209344 2020-11-08 05:21:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheHinduDindu This is not Irony, you moron. Say serious or jokingly(not serious). Ironically means there's irony involved. I see no irony here. Only terror and hatred for the fortunate and hard working.
1325185884715675648 2020-11-08 05:18:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheHinduDindu Ah. So you support the ideology that spawned widespread corruption which inevitably led to the deaths of over 100 million people worldwide? Cool.
1325184886991323137 2020-11-08 05:14:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Willanator93 Can you explain to me What exactly "hololive" is? I don't get it
1325184517305479168 2020-11-08 05:13:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cryptidkani Our news sources said that too, but this is similar to the 2000 election, where gore was declared the winner, but bush actually won. There are serious inaccuracies with some of the machines used in this election, so a true winner has yet to be decided. Same with this:  https://t.co/GlzygTDAPk
1325179763493904384 2020-11-08 04:54:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BlackGallade Just one person died, right
1325179656232951809 2020-11-08 04:53:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cryptidkani Eh. Not there yet, but in time we shall see

1325176349028454403 2020-11-08 04:40:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BlackGallade Who's nomad
1325164432415186947 2020-11-08 03:53:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FavDockOfShame @Gregster1998 Projected winner. Not actual winner.
1325162130149085184 2020-11-08 03:44:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Booooom.  Explosions are cool
1325161808852787200 2020-11-08 03:42:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing We'll see. Has the senate and supreme court verified the news media's claims?
1325151308995817472 2020-11-08 03:01:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I like to see Trump supporters cry, it's my daily medicine, my weekly energy, my monthly inspiration, my annual motivation. Their loss is the only reason I am still alive, I was born to love, to enjoy their failure. Now that I copied and pasted that, it's not as fun as I thought.
1325150821894467589 2020-11-08 02:59:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheCyanYoh Really? On whose account? the news media? Or the courts and senate?
1325149678795681794 2020-11-08 02:54:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cheeso_art @LabEcchi This looks great (from what I'm seeing) and your art is fantastic! Good going for the commissioner and whoever else goes to those sites.  (I have no clue what the non-patreon ones are)
1325149172455051264 2020-11-08 02:52:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tai_Moya @NoponDigi Sadly my uncle is one of them... and my friend.... and.... all but 2 of my coworkers...
1325147792117964800 2020-11-08 02:47:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sunnydrip Congrats!
1325146762835681282 2020-11-08 02:43:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @serpentinesisi I will. You don't have to listen to what I say, you know.
1325145417722417153 2020-11-08 02:37:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Herrly5 @AddVibes @MajorPatriot Freedom of the press for sure, but not "power" of the press.
1325145285488750594 2020-11-08 02:37:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JohnCaden64 Me too. You should hope for the best for your child, as should all of us.
1325144673636282368 2020-11-08 02:34:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @moderateone1 @Doll_lifeDan @Breaking911 You never did for the "pink tax" or the "wage gap" so how do we know you'll take responsibility for your own problems?
1325141166367543297 2020-11-08 02:20:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LuminaryHikari afaik?  Hm. Well, as far as I know, there are still some recounts and fraud claims to look into, so we may not know until December. And yes, if after all this, biden is declared the winner, I will 100% accept it.
1325140571019759616 2020-11-08 02:18:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jame_Sperry @Gregster1998 Well, if "later" is for the rest of the year (Donald is still the standing president until janurary) then this is accurate. Plus, I have not seen any official calls on the election from anywhere apart from the news media.
1325140072405012485 2020-11-08 02:16:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NoponDigi Maybe because the media said biden won (if he actually did and we find out once the votes have been tallied that's fine) and there's no official declaration from the courts or the senate
1325139446518386689 2020-11-08 02:13:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LuminaryHikari I suppose, but was there any official word from the court or senate?
1325136266233602050 2020-11-08 02:01:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeteLavaDigger @CatriaThicc Yes! You should draw sakura more often! Orochi too, if you like.
1325135762929537024 2020-11-08 01:59:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shanemadej But who called the election?
1325133280782454784 2020-11-08 01:49:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I'm a little upset that joe won, but I'll get over it. If we got through "fascist" trump for 4 years, we can handle 4 years of biden, and harris.
1325132660205899777 2020-11-08 01:47:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I get the feeling you avoided political talk because I didn't hate trump
1325132375970484224 2020-11-08 01:45:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Bitnerd_ Oof
1325132146206367746 2020-11-08 01:44:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I thought you didn't like politics? Hmmmm

1325108504731004930 2020-11-08 00:11:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @videojames_ I already threw a baby away. My brother and sister's  bodies were used as a sacrifice to make sure I survived birth.
1325107990735810560 2020-11-08 00:08:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Congratulations!
1325097478396456960 2020-11-07 23:27:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @moonahoshinova Thank you.  I want to love and be loved. We all do. But I don't think you are the person who will love me in spite of my flaws. You are sincere, but sincerity is not enough. You need trust and compassion...  forgive me.  And have a nice weekend

1325088994246451209 2020-11-07 22:53:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hheybeautifull Thank you for telling me. Could have done without the stupid part,  though. T_T
1325086196616355841 2020-11-07 22:42:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JuliansRum Oof. That's a scary thought.
1325085762040303620 2020-11-07 22:40:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tridisart What do you mean, "eh"? This is great!

We don't know if he has it, and even more suspicious, is after being in contact with him for several months because I live with him, I'm not experiencing any symptoms at all. HMM.
1324942598956605441 2020-11-07 13:11:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ConstitutionLo8 I see this argument thrown out here time and time again. But I don't get why... It doesn't make sense to me. Could someone explain why this is claim to this argument? You have to get tested for other diseases too.
1324942061548810241 2020-11-07 13:09:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @paulsperry_ @AddVibes I got tested today. No results until the weekend passes, even though the hospital staff said they could give me a fast test, and a fast test would be more appropriate for someone like me with 0 symptoms.
1324940669522235393 2020-11-07 13:04:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ffruitgoddess It's good that you don't have to live in an abusive environment.
1324940371173011456 2020-11-07 13:02:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @STFJESUS @VeritasVital @AddVibes As much as I want to agree with you, I can't. Several of my online friends and people I know are for Biden over trump. My own uncle voted for Biden because he hates trump's character.  Or at least, the character that msm tells him belongs to trump. I wish I could love my family.
1324939836151750656 2020-11-07 13:00:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KymberS0 @RedheadAndRight @dvillella @BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump By what measure? Cases in which 99% survive? Deaths that are inflated due to misreporting and willful negligence? Or by the measure of fear telling you that your loved ones shouldn't have to die? It's tough. My own father has it. But I'm not letting it control my life.
1324938329020899328 2020-11-07 12:54:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @oxley_wayne I would love to follow what you're saying, but the lack of punctuation makes it difficult. I agree we're facing voter fraud  in this election.  I just couldn't make out half of what you said here. I'll read it again.
1324937815390621696 2020-11-07 12:52:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @oxley_wayne @3days3nights @AddVibes I see. Well, thank you for the information. I know it isn't election week, so... yeah.
1324936732371013637 2020-11-07 12:48:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TessaTea2 @JuliansRum Yup. Just like the matrix, too.
1324936648505905152 2020-11-07 12:48:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @realleafsfan @JuliansRum It's because they don't want to cope with something that could alter their worldview completely, forcing them to adapt under immense psychological stress.  Cognitive Dissonance is one hell of a drug.  I know from experience.
1324936255575117825 2020-11-07 12:46:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mistytx2020 @JuliansRum What an idiot

1324935402466242560 2020-11-07 12:43:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VeritasVital @AddVibes I love seeing Trump supporters CRY. Something something... fuck I can't do this copypasta from memory. I guess that's it, then. Trump wins, folks.
1324930163096883201 2020-11-07 12:22:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DailySydsnap @Sydsnap Who is in the background? I'm having trouble seeing the poster because someone wvwn grearer is distracting me.
1324929536958619649 2020-11-07 12:19:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @3days3nights @AddVibes Hang on... the election isn't over though?  I don't understand. Am I missing something?  Because as far as I know, we still need to count the remaining [legal] votes and verify who won.
1324928800254267393 2020-11-07 12:16:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Dotted_Clouds Is that a reacharound?  Oh boi.... JAGEN GET THE RED PAINT
1324928454605811712 2020-11-07 12:15:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Saberteensie Didn't expect you to react calmly.  I respect that.  Most would just scream at me for sarcasm. You're not bad.
1324927206913679360 2020-11-07 12:10:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS You keep going at the oace that works for you! These times are tough worldwide, so we understand if you take more than  a nanosecond on your fabulous art!
1324926531215503360 2020-11-07 12:07:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @levithecoolguy1 Some lute wannabe in a blue mountain background. ;)  Also, I have no clue who you are.  But you seem great!
1324924252299145216 2020-11-07 11:58:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Saberteensie @h3h3productions Solve crying with actual election fraud.  Something punishable with years in federal prison. Yeah, do that. Dumbass
1324923258798542849 2020-11-07 11:54:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hheybeautifull Ok but how do we know that these illegal votes are not being counted?
1324922749073154049 2020-11-07 11:52:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @romig_ben @h3h3productions Ok this explanation makes sense
1324921155745099781 2020-11-07 11:46:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Me too. Half of it is elections, some of it is danger, md the rest is either memes or sexy art. I came here and stay for the art. The rest is... it's causing me more stress than I thought.
1324920718497353728 2020-11-07 11:44:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Red_XIV @kidaerosus @RealJamesWoods Oh. My bad.
1324920234113970177 2020-11-07 11:42:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @catturd2 Sorry. I need to take care of my family first.
1324920057911271424 2020-11-07 11:42:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato I would put more people if I could, but these are the ones that *always make me smile.  Even in the end.

1324918754522882053 2020-11-07 11:37:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS No clue what ntr has to do with your ps4 and spider man disks, but I hope you can find it soon.  It may not have been stolen, even though that's the first thing we think happened.  :/
1324917109030268929 2020-11-07 11:30:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @paddywop918 @Nina96352969 @JackPosobiec @Wizard_Predicts Someone told me that the "constitutional republic" thing is just an excuse to not have to abolish the electoral college. A republic is a form of democracy, but it is not a democratic state, if I have that right.
1324916619051749377 2020-11-07 11:28:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @deweyeye2020 @RPCVforTrump @Nina96352969 @JackPosobiec @Wizard_Predicts And cultural marxists

1324911986744954881 2020-11-07 11:10:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Um. Alright
1324911803307089921 2020-11-07 11:09:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Oh. I never cared for it to begin with so... I guess it's a win for me?

1324878323512643585 2020-11-07 08:56:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @thebradfordfile @AddVibes Not 100%, but it is a factor that needs to be considered.
1324876170270306311 2020-11-07 08:47:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jake_LastName As long as she don't die and it makes sense I'm down.  And as long as it doesn't ruin Alm X Celica
1324875340762714112 2020-11-07 08:44:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ComanderFalco @BitchAssBowie That's fair.  Wait a second, nonono, hold up
1324860423691177984 2020-11-07 07:45:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @boss_puppet @NowaPLS That is very accurate. My issue is I get attatched to lots of stuff, so I have to tell myself over and over that "it's just fiction. It isn't real." I have an anxiety disorder and suffer from depression a lot, so if I have a bad day and I read NTR, It's like I'm reinforcing it.
1324859186778435585 2020-11-07 07:40:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Some people like it. I can count the number of NTR I enjoy on one hand; all are doujinshi. If you like NTR, that's fine. Your kink is not mine, I'll  just stay away. The problem I have is that if the plot is super illogical/weak, it leads to depressive fits and anger. 3/3
1324858542030004225 2020-11-07 07:37:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS If the art is fantastic and has great focus on the sexual scenes or bodies, then of course it is high quality and worth it, In my eyes. I personally don't mind NTR in a language I don't speak, because then I can focus on the art instead of story. I'm an emotional perosn. 2/3
1324857994421669888 2020-11-07 07:35:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Personally, I dispise NTR. The writing is often poor and focuses on weak main characters or kidnapping/blackmail to create the depressed tension.  Why would you want to see the woman you love get raped by some random guy (or group) whose only quality is "big dick"?  1/3
1324856171690438657 2020-11-07 07:28:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS If it is an implied relationship and it's with another character, then that is simply cheating. It focuses on emotionally depressing a character or the reader through immoral tactics or uncontrollable situations. Mostly the writing is terrible and the mc does nothing.
1324855569673588736 2020-11-07 07:25:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS NTR is as follows: A character or person sees his/her love interest fucking another person, or has knowledge of cheating.  NTR focuses on "cucking" or stealing relationships away througj cheating and can involve blackmail and forced watching of cheating acts. 1/2
1324796877779382273 2020-11-07 03:32:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AddVibes Wait then what about him taking a break
1324796262642843654 2020-11-07 03:30:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FakeMikeMiseph @pbAstronaut @biggestjoel Then names will be illegal. This is stupid
1324796088872783874 2020-11-07 03:29:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SG___96 @biggestjoel @9_volt_ Oh noooooo
1324795572805619715 2020-11-07 03:27:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheHinduDindu That is absolutely false. Ever heard of don't judge a book by its cover?  Jeez

1324794592462573569 2020-11-07 03:23:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus Ah. A Canadian who doesn't live in america is trying to give his opinion on the electoral process. Interesting. Is he right? Probably, yeah.

1324757018499076101 2020-11-07 00:54:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @20PercentDash Yikes.
1324756877109088257 2020-11-07 00:53:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Rude_Astrology The only thing I can add to this conversation is that Cancer's symbol in astrology is 69.
1324755068562931712 2020-11-07 00:46:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @crockejo @breakfixbreak @EpochTimes Because it's apparently a fair trade and the IRS will lock you up. Don't mind the government's massive spending problem or the tax spending on issues we can't pay back in a decade.  Whoops
1324753248029413379 2020-11-07 00:39:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JerryisANerd It's good sheet

1324617361903726592 2020-11-06 15:39:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BlackDragonFata Um... what's wrong with cosplay? It's the same thing as Halloween, but with accurate creativity with outfits and materials to replicate characters people love.  I really don't see the issue.
1324615474345349120 2020-11-06 15:31:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TKamalas @MiamiAngel @newsbreakApp Sadly, this is true. Children develop much better under a mother and a father. There are ways for gay couples to raise children well, and they deserve happiness as much as anyone else who is willing to work for it. But not all same sex parents have a child's development at heart.
1324613477000974336 2020-11-06 15:23:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @classicallycozy It depends if there was actual malice behind it. That's for the court to settle. But still, freedom of speech, sadly.
1324612896614174720 2020-11-06 15:21:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Christopher_L70 It is an interesting process, but the extent of my knowledge goes up to the electoral college and why it's needed.
1324611952891625473 2020-11-06 15:17:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime I don't hate matthis at all. I just love other characters more. XD
1324611207723130880 2020-11-06 15:14:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @20PercentDash I hate to interrupt,  but I read stuff like this or watch videos on political policy, and I sometimes absorb it like a sponge. I understand the data, the reasoning, the logic and I even learn more about the world.  But I can't argue a point/apply this knowledge to save my life.
1324610084224307202 2020-11-06 15:10:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealJamesWoods Ok that's hilarious.
1324609334379237377 2020-11-06 15:07:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @N1ghts1der Thank you
1324609257598308352 2020-11-06 15:07:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrazyRedPillGuy @TPilled Hey, Red? I never looked into the whole Russian thing because I didn't believe it to begin with, but I do believe some actual conspiracy theories. Does that make me crazy?  And no, it's not the moon landing or flat earth - those are verifiable
1324608156224421888 2020-11-06 15:02:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TaskForceAEGIS @RealJamesWoods I have no clue. I really don't know, and at this point, I don't really care. I mean I do care, but I care about my family more, and right now, I have a stupid virus to fight off.
1324606847219863552 2020-11-06 14:57:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @N1ghts1der It did. It was a remix of FE 4's theme.
1324606522194907136 2020-11-06 14:56:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Hudsona_776 @ErrorFailz Huh.  Good thing I don't care about supernatural
1324606116534374400 2020-11-06 14:54:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Good luck! I have more important things to do (plus my dad has the rona) and I want to take care of my family first, as selfish as that sounds.
1324605711259717632 2020-11-06 14:53:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @N1ghts1der Oh shit you're right. It's eliwood. Well, I guess that's what I get for not playong FE 7 in 3 years.
1324577293759557637 2020-11-06 13:00:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 As much as I understand your sentiment, I think it's a little dangerous to do everything the president says. I'm fine with making my own decisions, and questioning authority if need be.  However, if the president simply says to look, then I'll check it out at the very least.
1324574632956014597 2020-11-06 12:49:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Nice work! I usually don't comment on nsfw stuff, but now that my family and I have the Big bad virus, I don't fear the reaper.  I like mirko's smirk in the first panel. üëç
1324573970813882370 2020-11-06 12:46:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone This seems to be Vika. Aka, the best Bird LAguz. (I ship her and Ulki for the memes)  You look fantastic!  Really nice job on the hair too!
1324567824099086336 2020-11-06 12:22:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Yes, we will self quarentine after testing, even if it's negative. I'm going to be buying some gin and tonic, and hopefully we can make it through. I'm worried about my mother, but even more: I'm fucking LIVID at pharmaceutical companies. Lives are more important than money.
1324567242676314113 2020-11-06 12:20:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Life fucking sucks.  I'll cut to the chase - My father was tested positive for Covid-19. Dunno if it's the flu and a false positive or what, but I'm going to my damndest to make sure he recovers. Same with my mother.  I've probably got it, but I'll be fine.  1/2
1324523892350816262 2020-11-06 09:27:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @INKYVIVI I read "corn pottage" as... well... Swap the first letters.
1324523320902062081 2020-11-06 09:25:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic The one thing I find hilarous about all this, is that some people think that biden got more votes than any other president.  I mean they're not wrong, but a bunch of those votes aren't even legal. It's a crying shame how single minded some of these twatter folks are.      :(
1324522572441149442 2020-11-06 09:22:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrangeKyle91 Oh, look. Someone who doesn't know how the electoral college works! Wow.  Where the fuck did you learn history? XD
1324521962241216514 2020-11-06 09:20:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Falchion_Z My opinion of him is as follows: He's a jokey character and I like his personality.  Wait. HE'S A GUY!?
1324521723283341313 2020-11-06 09:19:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AskrsTro Do I need to post one character or one thing, or...? I'm confused. An explanation and then the letter would be wonderful! Thanks.
1324521476192669697 2020-11-06 09:18:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic I thought trump was?  He apologized to Hilary and everything. XD

1324519515707887616 2020-11-06 09:10:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse If you're going Sacae, Using Cecilia + roy support, Rutger with any support, and Barth/BATH are good investements because sacae has one of the most annoying bosses in FE history.
1324519119782379520 2020-11-06 09:09:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS That sucks. I think your commissioners and fans will understand. Good luck!

1324518658673094656 2020-11-06 09:07:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NobodyGamer0100 @NowaPLS Because australia wants to use safety as a cover up for authoritarian government control. No better than Communist countries.
1324518338144411648 2020-11-06 09:05:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FacuMBW @NowaPLS It's "for the children". Pff. My ass.
1324517987962019841 2020-11-06 09:04:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda New Nintendo 3DS. Not bad, but gonna miss the backwards compatibility
1324451279851180034 2020-11-06 04:39:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 Accurate!  The only issue is that I like other characters more than him.
1324447665208348674 2020-11-06 04:25:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sizzlingspirit Thank you, Sizzling

1324445508480438273 2020-11-06 04:16:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 I don't even hate matthis. War and conscription can mess some people up. If matthis's character is a result of any kind of macedonian strict training and council, then his behavior  is obviously warranted. Besides. How's a red unit supposed to know what blue paint looks like?
1324444590917722112 2020-11-06 04:12:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ayewhatusay @TheRightMelissa @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump You're right. I should. I shouldn't lool at photographic and video evidence or anything like that because it's all lies. Harris 2020! Woo! Go communism!
1324429190049996800 2020-11-06 03:11:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Johnlmao44 @ThiccWithaQ That's fine.
1324427943372820486 2020-11-06 03:06:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Margikrap It's all fine.
1324427457517203462 2020-11-06 03:04:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tsu_wariwap @GrimTwinDD Congratulations! It looks beautiful!
1324416468520472576 2020-11-06 02:21:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Johnlmao44 @ThiccWithaQ It is. Very good quality. But the NTR is garbage.
1324416350283063296 2020-11-06 02:20:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SansNoCapo @ThiccWithaQ Another good man/woman down.

1324415934367412224 2020-11-06 02:18:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @20PercentDash I agree. Nothing suspicious here. Also I like Rarity more than RD.  Is that bad?
1324414639883603969 2020-11-06 02:13:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HoggcastM @RealJamesWoods The ballot counters aren't supposed to wear clothing or otherwise that recognizes either canidate
1324414184520634370 2020-11-06 02:12:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SchetterR @RealJamesWoods The love for our country and its Citizens is pushed aside in favor of the hatred of trump.
1324413763773222920 2020-11-06 02:10:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VBermoothes @RealJamesWoods That's literally what the 2nd amendment is for. If you try to take the guns away, boom! Second ammendment in practice!

1324411805767241728 2020-11-06 02:02:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pastooliotheguy Nope. But hey, roy would be a better president than biden.. I mean Harris ever could!
1324411439914897408 2020-11-06 02:01:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Your mom.
1324411136687689729 2020-11-06 01:59:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Mine too

1324407107047854082 2020-11-06 01:43:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MaryGraceHuffm1 Thank you, Mary.
1324406529114673152 2020-11-06 01:41:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BeNxthing @p3achsalt Hm. Interesting
1324405889600806915 2020-11-06 01:39:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Marlahrd @jennfranconews But all the votes need to be counted.

1324399664288980995 2020-11-06 01:14:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @barnacle_bish Funny. But awash with dissonance.

1324398459198316547 2020-11-06 01:09:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mariespinner @C_3C_3 If it's so obvious, why do people belive that biden is winning?  Probably because it's all mail in votes... when the CDC said if you have covid you can go out and vote in person.  We shouldn't do mail in votes again.
1324397870473240576 2020-11-06 01:07:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 No, thank you, bybeli

1324397412333608961 2020-11-06 01:05:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jestelle_p @_StephanieMyers @OANN I agree. Very shady

1324396604556775425 2020-11-06 01:02:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cklear12 @RealJamesWoods She is, but she is not a homophobe. She simply hates homosexuals.

1324394346347638784 2020-11-06 00:53:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NicholasRanki18 @Den_the_M I would like to see proof of this mass scale cheating. So far I only know of 1 or 2 fraudulent attempts. I don't care who wins. I just want to know the truth.

1324385569439420419 2020-11-06 00:18:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sleepylemur @yourmomistaken @GifZelda The only reason I said that was to get on people's nerves. Chrono Trigger is 10/10
1324385278480580608 2020-11-06 00:17:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shanamarie_d @Darth_Pingu I'd be willing to marry, but the problem is you can leave whether or not trump wins.
1324384822614175746 2020-11-06 00:15:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Darth_Pingu I want mine to be female so I have even the slightest chance at finding true love. Thanks.
1324381527438970881 2020-11-06 00:02:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @yourmomistaken @sleepylemur @GifZelda Eh. Chrono trigger is overrated

1324374897548763136 2020-11-05 23:35:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TaskLacka I appreciate your commitment to what YOU want to do. It's your art, and you deserve to make the final say on who/what you draw. Pelicans saying megumin over and over swayed you this time, but I think there's a silver lining: The trio of 80's style Konosuba gals is complete.
1324373638565502977 2020-11-05 23:30:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @arktoons @SYG64 This is FANTASTIC!!  I don't know if someone commissioned you or what, but this made my morning a hell of a lot better! Thank you for your dedication to your craft, and I wish you a great day
1324365428387467266 2020-11-05 22:58:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @carolinaaaisher @Aotibs Proving his point, I see.
1324363952529223682 2020-11-05 22:52:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MatttGFX @Gregster1998 Ok, as serious as the vote thing can be, this is hilarious. XD

1324361708127899649 2020-11-05 22:43:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Burritos are good,  so I don't blame you.
1324361224872710149 2020-11-05 22:41:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Gee. It's like illnesses besides Sars-cov2 exist!  But yeah. Glad you're ok.

That should include retweets and likes. But still. Don't be afraid to think critically and challenge what's being shown or fed to you. Kinda what america is for.

1324216891699810304 2020-11-05 13:08:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tikisgrace @AdamKampen @7thPlatoon You have plenty of fanfics and hentai to go off of. If the official cannon states they're friends, then that is how it is.
1324213898938036224 2020-11-05 12:56:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @6two2forty @yranaheim Who proved it, and when?
1324211123550326784 2020-11-05 12:45:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shoe0nhead This makes no fucking sense. If a party would willingly throw you under a bus and treat you like lesser citizens, then why the fuck do you support it?
1324208101315280896 2020-11-05 12:33:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealJamesWoods I have no clue who he is, so i voted champ. Sorry

Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups
1324166381676486656 2020-11-05 09:47:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JavierSchimizzi @ErikaHarlacher It is. It has democratic policies, but it is, by and large, a constitutional republic. Voting is important, but you need to understand our system has various checks and balances that need to be respected. When they are tossed aside, it becomes easy to corrupt our country.
1324162448564408320 2020-11-05 09:31:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Hazamatoxin The mail in ballots tallied overnight do not add up and does not make sense with how the electoral college works. It's not my fault or the president's fault you don't understand.
1324159970414338051 2020-11-05 09:21:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GailKuhn1 Me too. Some of the excuses they come up with are beyond disgusting.
1324159358800928768 2020-11-05 09:19:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xxasidxx @RealJamesWoods None for third party candidates either.
1324156204327800835 2020-11-05 09:06:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RubysBubys I mean he's right.
1324155996424589316 2020-11-05 09:06:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Terracathero Had no clue what this was either until now. Thank you!!
1324149466308530177 2020-11-05 08:40:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Arden because they're cute together. Please use arden...
1324148771459051522 2020-11-05 08:37:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_ThomasGWhite_ Apparently sharpies DO work. I have a source that a socialist gave me.  https://t.co/EgSmZVQ5oZ
1324138715271307267 2020-11-05 07:57:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD I mean.... some people migrated here from Tumblr, so it's to be expected. I try not to do that myself but.... there are days...
1324078888658546697 2020-11-05 03:59:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KirbyAlan What do you mean?
1324078036405411842 2020-11-05 03:56:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mrdeplorable That sounds interesting. May I have some of that info, too?

1324070257984737287 2020-11-05 03:25:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bigikefan7000 At least this is a meme

1324041433288974339 2020-11-05 01:30:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ReactBae @stclairashley Nope. Thankfully when I vited I was given a standard Bic pen.
1324038017116524545 2020-11-05 01:17:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala I was moreso wondering what it is like to live there. But that's good to know!

1324027124815187968 2020-11-05 00:34:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @videojames_ Relatable.
1323999027231395847 2020-11-04 22:42:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 @RealJamesWoods I wish that were true. There are plenty of people on this site that I've seen who think trump stopped the vote counting first and he declared victory.
1323996075322232841 2020-11-04 22:30:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask That's great! You tell that virus who's boss! :D
1323924941448847361 2020-11-04 17:47:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jake_blasterr I respect you wanting to enlighten the rest of us who have no clue about the electoral college, but if biden is ahead in the electoral votes as shown here, how is it that trump will win?  And shouldn't we count the votes anyway? I'm trying to wrap my head around this.
1323923242621480962 2020-11-04 17:41:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Mike55029284 Mike I just want to ask, how is it we are sure he has won? The votes have not all been counted yet. I get he stopped the votes out of suspicion for voter fraud in PA, but how does that prove he won? I just don't get it.  Please and Thank you
1323907496612868097 2020-11-04 16:38:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @oibal60 @RealJamesWoods I don't know what to think of it,  honestly.
1323903456575447040 2020-11-04 16:22:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tridisart I get what you're going for, and we should keep counting. But some places have stopped under a 2am excuse and that's not right.
1323892722558709760 2020-11-04 15:39:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bomac_macbo @nypost I don't know man.  Best to forget and move on

1323881695205117954 2020-11-04 14:56:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hudo_shin @LabEcchi This is the good stuff. And it's getting me through this terrible night.
1323861949445275649 2020-11-04 13:37:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FEStruggleSus So... he's complaining then. Nice. I looooove it when people complain. News flash. Lyn had bouncy babas in FE 7.
1323851060415520777 2020-11-04 12:54:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Everyone's talking about FEH stuff and wanting to get the new alts, but that's gambling for babies! DQ V has all you need with gambling with a 100 coin slot machine that can keep you invested for hours! The best part is,  you WILL get that king metal sword.
1323850432297508864 2020-11-04 12:51:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC Quit... what now?
1323850255155286016 2020-11-04 12:51:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OhDot_ I was kinda joking, but you did it anyway.  That's dedication to comedy.  Thank you very much for making my evening. Cheers!
1323844813272322050 2020-11-04 12:29:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WaifuSection @LabEcchi True. Focus on what brings us together,  not what divides us.
1323842151990632448 2020-11-04 12:18:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JerryisANerd Why don't you quit telling me what to do? I'd rather bang a woman who loves me than some hoe.
1323830907527172098 2020-11-04 11:34:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @keaganahah @nypost You mean good! This disease is about as effective as a paperclip on your nipple to stop your wife's lactation.  Ok that's a strange analogy...
1323830223448715266 2020-11-04 11:31:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 He sounds like Takahiro Sakurai, but I could easily be mistaken.
1323827821618335748 2020-11-04 11:22:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 Hold up... WHO VOICES ZIHARK
1323827156154273798 2020-11-04 11:19:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_RobynH_ That's because he isn't entirely responsible for those deaths, bud. If anything it's on the states themselves, because the states have the most power over crowd control with this "pandemic". Plus biden has various symptoms of dementia,  so there's that...
1323825860575744000 2020-11-04 11:14:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SimpingRin Um... but wasn't trump the first president voted into office in support of same sex marriage?
1323825246768521217 2020-11-04 11:11:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ATerribleFayte @Blun_Z It was proven that the biden car endangered the trump supporting driver,  which caused the incident. It was not intent on the trump driver's part. Watch the video footage, bud.
1323824795620966400 2020-11-04 11:10:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ItsMaxHP A shot at what, max?
1323819242576379909 2020-11-04 10:47:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Judging by the results, I am very dissapointed in my vote. I should have voted for Jo Jorgensen.  We could have had a stand user in the White House. Dang.
1323818110009380865 2020-11-04 10:43:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt If it's lewd then how come It's the one thing I want to do with a potential gf more than sex?  Ok maybe second to cuddling but I mean...
1323817216521969665 2020-11-04 10:39:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Speaking of doodoo.... I saw this cursed Botan *offbrand* and it... scared me.
1323816183834025984 2020-11-04 10:35:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @marybear25 @seanmdav @catturd2 I dunno. Might want to wait until all the votes are in.
1323814596281585666 2020-11-04 10:29:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kansarai @EpochTimes Being a mom and a marine, while commendable, does not automatically make her fit for government office.
1323814111088644096 2020-11-04 10:27:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @peckerperson Bruh do you know what the bourgeoisie are?
1323813579716501505 2020-11-04 10:25:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OhDot_ I'll take a pidgeon.  I'm desperate enough.
1323813448485134337 2020-11-04 10:24:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @brass_monke @YaBoiKryzon But the biden rap video...
1323811998652575745 2020-11-04 10:19:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I would, but you point a kinfe at me and say, "you sure about that?"  I like Cordelia. But I think her character flaws logically set her behind characters like maribelle, lissa and cherche.
1323804639452606466 2020-11-04 09:49:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PapOneNine79 I have to agree. Tucker, imo, is probably the most level headed guy over there at fox. All mainstream news outlets are biased, though.  It's tough.
1323772454582575104 2020-11-04 07:42:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrwellNGoode I cannot even understand what the hell this is...
1323770142392725505 2020-11-04 07:32:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @StormyRise Never give up. You got this.
1323768560708145152 2020-11-04 07:26:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Grca1337 You know what? You're a real trooper. Thanks
1323768309871972353 2020-11-04 07:25:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic @wait_what_memes I was honestly super pissed at some jobsites amd my PC for not cooperating when I'm trying to get a new job. Sorry for being a pouty puss.
1323767834657361920 2020-11-04 07:23:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Good. I've been stressed out for like 6 hours today
1323748610685706245 2020-11-04 06:07:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic @wait_what_memes What gets me everytime is how people continue to have hope when we are all destined to fail and die in the end. It's worthless and technology was a mistake
1323748023642501121 2020-11-04 06:04:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tharealkingpin @8randonRobinson @Amit_s_K @MrMichaelBurkes See, none of us have rights. FDR proved that. So will biden if elected. We're all subject to the state and a flimsy slip of 200+ year old paper isn't gonna protect the American people from shit.
1323747503901151234 2020-11-04 06:02:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MrMichaelBurkes @DanBensonMusic Good. MAybe you can drive home and await the inevitable demise of the state when everything tumbles to hell.  Because that's gonna happen nomatter what and the world is cruel and families hating eachother over stupid voting choices that THEY CREATED is stupid.
1323746027472642049 2020-11-04 05:57:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Humanity sucks
1323745820148142085 2020-11-04 05:56:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD It is kind of annoying. I've already voted and it's just... give it a rest. everryone knows how important it is
1323715546978856960 2020-11-04 03:55:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Forseti_Silesse As stupid as that sounds, I think it's kinda funny. Thanks for the laugh
1323713472484548609 2020-11-04 03:47:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Merryweatherey Honestly with the amount of stress I'm already under with this election, I think this is a great choice.  Thank you, Merry. Bless you.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
1323712657237618696 2020-11-04 03:44:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jmanw29 @LabEcchi My favorite is Starfire (assuming I can't pick blackfire), but I see the appeal of raven
1323705017229021185 2020-11-04 03:14:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Plun_Yu @DynamoSuperX There were a few others like Avatar the last airbender, Justice league, Foster's Home, Adventure time and even some of the much older ones that were exceptionally well written and animated. But yes, Regular show was fantastic.
1323699311444713473 2020-11-04 02:51:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> It would be genius if this whole election divide thing was orchestrated just to show america the power of Flex Seal products. #VOTE

1323622365595652096 2020-11-03 21:45:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hyenasandgin @poochy_lily And we're not talking physical strength. It's about strength of heart. And the calm soul to remain unwavering in your honest convictions.
1323621449106677761 2020-11-03 21:41:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JohnCaden64 @mountain_goats Good on ya. Don't care whi you voted for, I just pray people don't ambush eachother this week.
1323528198009835520 2020-11-03 15:31:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 No one cares.
1323526194223075329 2020-11-03 15:23:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ben63779996 What does it mean to be openly gay? Would you say someone is openly black?
1323525745931669504 2020-11-03 15:21:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @seawarrior1972 @samanthamarika1 @OcrazioCornPop People are blind and think they can twist this word to mean hatred because "words can have more than 1 definition" or "language changes over time". None of those fools understand what control is.
1323525024075177984 2020-11-03 15:18:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LINKMarine2000 @on1ytrama @Complex No one cares about anyone. That's how we got into this fucking mess
1323524281989550081 2020-11-03 15:15:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Robin89960532 @VonnieOpn @RealJamesWoods Never inderestimate a person's need to not have to consider what is the truth and what is a lie. It's hard for people.
1323521042950868992 2020-11-03 15:03:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ObsidianWasp And you're still being fed manipulative lies. And no, the main point of the race thing isn't what I'm talking about.
1323520395698384897 2020-11-03 15:00:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ObsidianWasp No, because those were important messages. Currently, the message to not be racist isn't doing much but repeating something that you are tought anyway. It's redundant at this point. So, it comes off as not genuine.
1323519426000572417 2020-11-03 14:56:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EricaMills And it's a choice to be gay. You'r point?
1323519001180491782 2020-11-03 14:54:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SadYacht Morgan Freeman said it best.
1323501382868045824 2020-11-03 13:44:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ColoredTrees The heck is an RPG in this context?
1323501093154922496 2020-11-03 13:43:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @unbiasedfreedom Can i save this picture? I find it hilarious
1323500810341437440 2020-11-03 13:42:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tjstukes84 @Mememarkets1 @GallowayMitch @ejayjones49 @Cernovich Because the analogies alone are not enough. You need proof and strength of heart.
1323499294066937856 2020-11-03 13:36:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Ok as much as I want to agree, wasn't this a cake thing? It doesn't seem real.
1323494657460940800 2020-11-03 13:18:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jetopyon You're cute.  Or else what, though?
1323494298223075328 2020-11-03 13:16:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> They're all about to listen to the newest announcement from the nearby school:  The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.  The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity...
1323493639033675778 2020-11-03 13:14:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Dark green hair and her... um... chimichangas.
1323493429486211072 2020-11-03 13:13:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> He has dark wings and he's sexy. Kind of exemplifies the female fantasy of wanting to tame a damgerous man. I mean come on! He looks soooo cool!
1323493011494457347 2020-11-03 13:11:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> To stop him from siding with the furries.  Because he himself is a dreaded mix of furry and normie.
1323492645285597185 2020-11-03 13:10:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Mother and daughter.
1323492501664256001 2020-11-03 13:09:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> The pooooower of love! Ok, Huey Lewis reference aside, I think the power is that of siren-like chior singing.  I mean with those long golden locks, who wouldn't have a choir at your command?
1323491693560287232 2020-11-03 13:06:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> It's Sigrun's restraining order because I called her Mom(my) once. It says I'm not allowed to come within 500 meters of her for the next 3 years.
1323491066016837632 2020-11-03 13:03:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> One is ugly, one is copying Ulysses S. Grant, and the other looks like he's from the rocky horror picture show. And last I checked, no one likes any of those qualities.
1323490414779867137 2020-11-03 13:01:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> My grandma and her cookies are in there and I have to get there before a bandit burns it to the ground. Because you know... can't have Flame Insignia without bandits.
1323489970099757057 2020-11-03 12:59:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I'm going to say 10. She duel wields, and anyone who duel wields is automatically important as f^ck. Look at Kirito.
1323489610731790336 2020-11-03 12:58:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> The hair is a sacrifice and she doesn't want to hand it over because it's her daughter's hair.
1323489106379329537 2020-11-03 12:56:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> He's in smash bros and he's apparently more bland than saltless crackers.
1323488817169506304 2020-11-03 12:54:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> He's wearing green and green is not a creative color. (Kudos if anyone gets that reference)
1323488642527088641 2020-11-03 12:54:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> His name is Brent Worthington. He is a Scholar of the light and wants to end the war of the Senate and furries because lights are fabulous.
1323488071514468352 2020-11-03 12:52:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> Ike and friends are so swol and magnificent, that everyone has a radiant glow and it's FE about that glow and how senators try to stop it.  Also furries. (My answers will be jokes, I hope that's ok)
1323487342997524480 2020-11-03 12:49:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gothcrows @robbiedaymond Everyone knows your vote doesn't count. (Kek)

1323486513271898112 2020-11-03 12:45:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Good job, man. It takes a lot of willpower and dedication to become someone from being in the slums.  I'm fortunate to not have gone through such an ordeal, but I understand because I know family who have. Let's hope we can all do better and aim higher.
1323485777624530944 2020-11-03 12:42:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask Lol yeah. The internet loves megumin for some reason. I prefer YunYun, darkness and Wiz myself, but she has an explosive effect on people. Good luck!
1323485184059125760 2020-11-03 12:40:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cordeliasept @ErrorFailz Finn got with all the gals except ayra and brigid
1323485047471722496 2020-11-03 12:39:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Fury and Finn isn't a bad pairing if you want to give the brave lance a ton of kills and pass it on to Fee
1323484704373379073 2020-11-03 12:38:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap That's gross. I don't want to do that. Even with my best friends. Debating and discussing hentai? Sure. But yanking to it together is... gross. That's me time, and maaaybe my partner.
1323459855173275648 2020-11-03 10:59:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EdwardWLocherIV @BarMan_RLM @Jorgensen4POTUS The fuck... if that's true, why the hell do we not know about that? I don't... I can't even fathom how that would escape the history books. I'm so scared of a man I've looked up to might be close to a dictator...
1323457436796309505 2020-11-03 10:50:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Brute6969 Not possible, stfu

1323421792493514755 2020-11-03 08:28:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lovedaresyou2 As a teacher, can you answer a question for me? Was abraham Lincoln a terrible person? I'm scared to know the truth, if he was in fact one of our worst presidents.

1323418509121064962 2020-11-03 08:15:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @femaleredhead I don't like it either, but some of my favorite artists are on here and there's not much choice if I want to communicate for commissions and feedback
1323417005903532032 2020-11-03 08:09:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RICHEY099 @Nux_Taku They've always been powerful. I would explain how but feminists would hate me.
1323415238692229122 2020-11-03 08:02:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Yup. It's nice they can, but economic compromises have been rampant ever since the mid 1920's directly as a result of female taxation and the lack of women who have enough money to pay back what is owed for the social services aimed at women and for women's rights.

1323413792739524611 2020-11-03 07:56:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> This is absolutely subjective, but you forget that the man who crafted the symphonic melodies of dragon quest is award-worthy. On the other hand, Sugiyama is a peice of sh^t. So.... eh.
1323413321333301248 2020-11-03 07:54:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bee_mvtt @meloscav Words can have multiple meanings, but not artificially. It's an agenda, and it's flung around so much that even the "new" meaning loses any credibility. Plus it would mean fear of humans but that already exists. I'm not falling for that bs.
1323411072515297280 2020-11-03 07:46:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 The composer is a piece of crap, but he does make good music. I'll give credit where credit is due,  but that doesn't mean I like the f^cker.

1323292073521516544 2020-11-02 23:53:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @contxtsonic This better be a joke. You can't cancel something that would have no impact on anyone reasonable even with a semi-deadly virus.

1323289134090362881 2020-11-02 23:41:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChikoritaCheez Not remotely. He has 2 kids, understands the value of integrity and kindness, and is a pet owner.  Last game I played was DQ 5 last night, haha
1323287556180660230 2020-11-02 23:35:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @azelofvelthomer It does. There's an old gaiden let's play by "Kelsper" who got the lance. If you want to see it for yourself.
1323286713666576384 2020-11-02 23:31:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @meloscav No it isn't. It's fake. Phobia means extreme or irrational fear. Not hatred. This isn't debatable.

1323108763474272256 2020-11-02 11:44:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Not ejaculating for a month is honestly not too bad, but 2 months or more is overkill. It is as unhealthy as doing it every single day for years.  As the saying goes:  All things in moderation. Once a week in this case is actually a good pace.

1323101345751142400 2020-11-02 11:15:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gelisita_ Are those radishes, unions, or eggplants in the taco?
1323101028003315712 2020-11-02 11:14:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TadCooper15 Or my brothers or sisters who died before birth.

1323099832165289984 2020-11-02 11:09:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @robel_mimi @RobertDubois_82 There's a difference between a common good and a commodity. I don't know what that difference is but.... yeah

1323086739913740291 2020-11-02 10:17:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @marioan92616703 I don't see how that pertains to my question, but alrighty. I'll be waiting in a bomb shelter... with 5 year's worth supply of ravioli and a woman to help keep me company.  What? What if all of america destroys itself and there's no one left?

Honestly, most of my history classes focused on the civil war/reconstruction-present day.  Apart from Washington - John Quincy Adams, I don't know much about the presidencies of those before lincoln. I can't even remember who came before MArtin van buren.

1323070592606679046 2020-11-02 09:13:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen I.... I didn't need to see this
1323070145699500032 2020-11-02 09:11:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @azelofvelthomer There's actually a couple ways to do this. 1 - Tell the rng goddess to bow before you. Then Silque, genny, or Tatiana will probably hit twice. 2 - Kill zombies and get the Luna lance (0.0258% chance to drop) and have the healer hold it - her hitrate will be fixed at 100%.

1323055793453912065 2020-11-02 08:14:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @America26304770 Technicly, HCQ only stops the proteins of the virus from attaching to cells. Zinc helps keep your cells strong and fights off the disease that way, once the virus is sitting there doing nothing. Well, that's all I know. mostly. but yes, it is cheaper.

1323040210184228864 2020-11-02 07:12:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ferdivains I was wrong about the lie thing, but the thing that irritates me the most is how edelgard is treated as a hero when the closest thing to relate her to is Stalin. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
1323038683512115202 2020-11-02 07:06:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BrokenRagnell Everyone will be because those fools aren't good enough for eachother. That accusation will mean nothing.

1323025351530975232 2020-11-02 06:13:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shoe0nhead More "ok" than you.
1323024954263171073 2020-11-02 06:11:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 IF the story addressed these criticisms, you wouldn't need to lay out all of this. the writing is poor and does not convey the story through the means where people who may be biased against her can understand all of this easily.
1323024263343935488 2020-11-02 06:08:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 She never committed Genocide - she incited a war on a grand scale that caused the death of thousands, possibly millions.
1323023361723801600 2020-11-02 06:05:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 The system doesn't work, not because of crests. but because of the nobility abusing those crests.

It was a joke, so I'll admit I was wrong with insulting intellegence. And I don't like soren and ike. I just know it is the closest thing to cannon based on the information.
1323022013561262082 2020-11-02 06:00:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 suuuure. Quit lying. You KNOW her actions caused the death of thousands. She's a hypocrite and a terrible lying bitch. She stepped down because her life was going to end soon, not because she valued the people.
1323021266945757188 2020-11-02 05:57:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NazcaDopants @Schmae212 We know rhea is more true than edelgard because we see sothis and have proof of rheas claims.
1323020651301605377 2020-11-02 05:54:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 This whole thread is a lie and I will continue to hate edelgard.
1323018595610316802 2020-11-02 05:46:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WoodsEyebrows @DonaldJTrumpJr So you like that? cool.
1323018266248445955 2020-11-02 05:45:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @contesa442 @UTakeDrugsDanny @BobLMorrison @DonaldJTrumpJr I thought most of them were capitalist with a focus on social safety nets. Or was that just denmark? I can't remember. Probably some of them, I suppose
1323017937217867777 2020-11-02 05:43:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JeanneG36440243 @DonaldJTrumpJr Where is your proof that lady specifically, and the others there are ALL trump supporters? It's likely that maybe one person in there is, but all of them? nah.
1323017281874657280 2020-11-02 05:41:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bicycleman0402 @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump did not say these things. How is it directly his fault? It's like saying that I am responsible for my friend's actions because I told him "I don't care what you do"
1323016408863854598 2020-11-02 05:37:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DonaldJTrumpJr @DanBensonMusic Wow. I would think that people have more respect than that, officer or not. This is uh... this shouldn't be acceptable.
1323015416579563526 2020-11-02 05:33:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LukasHesketh Oh. Well... that changes almost everything
1323015183556595712 2020-11-02 05:32:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @agreedboar @ClementJ64 Sorry. Just trying to help. Glad to see you're doing well
1323011620226899971 2020-11-02 05:18:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @itsnashflynn You still made it!  Drop or no drop, you still had an accomplishment. Don't focus on the negative. This is an example of how no matter how rough shit gets in life, you can always pick up your pieces and carry on.  Plus, you still have SOME cake left! I'd eat it, tbh.
1323011075017682946 2020-11-02 05:16:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpadesEnder @art271200 You can block the specific words
1323010894981419008 2020-11-02 05:15:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpadesEnder You make it sound like 2020 is harder to survive than other years.  2021 and the years to come will only get harder as collective cognitive ability declines. But yes, I agree to these nnn terms.
1323010499664072704 2020-11-02 05:14:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kagusaki Happy birthday
1323010305774047234 2020-11-02 05:13:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LukasHesketh The comparison is important because you say that dimitri is unfit to be a king, when edelgard is even more unfit. The thing is, Did dimitri commit these atrocities out of retaliation under stress, or did he do so willingly? This is about insanity, not "being king".
1323009613382488066 2020-11-02 05:10:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 Alright. My bad. It's hard to tell if people are joking nowadays, nomatter how obvious it seems. I'll leave folks alone
1323008845103456256 2020-11-02 05:07:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CEO_of_Vore Following back is near pointless. It's just like paying for a subscription service to a magazine you're never going to read. Plus, what kind of a life do you have to beg someone to follow you? Social media isn't everything, bud.
1323008164246265868 2020-11-02 05:05:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Good luck with that, grim.
1323008005953212425 2020-11-02 05:04:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Schmae212 Soren and Ike is more cannon than any pairing Ike could possibly have. It's anything but official cannon. Asexual reproduction is impossible with humans so that means Priam is mist/boyd's descendant. Anyone who answered the bottom choice is simply ignorant and uneducated.
1323007317311475713 2020-11-02 05:01:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @agreedboar @ClementJ64 The chances of you ending up in an ICU (especially if you're under the age of 30) with viral contraction is rare, and even more rare is the chance you would die from this disease. Just take some vitimin D and in one week you'll be better off than 70% of americans.
1323006610705436672 2020-11-02 04:58:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NayrmanBSC sure pal. Anything to get rid of the orange man...

1323004978026393603 2020-11-02 04:52:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LukasHesketh Brutal killing... hm... more brutal than say... edelgard's conquest to control an entire continent because she hates social hierarchies? More brutal than rhea and a fake goddess who weaves lies in the common... wait no... Byleth is living proof of the opposite...
1322997947739623425 2020-11-02 04:24:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LukasHesketh Just because she thinks it is best, doesn't mean it is. And what past is it you're talking about? Dimitri didn't order several thousands killed. He's a difficult, complex character. And I don't care what the game wants me to think - edelgard IS the villian, end of story.
1322966239090774017 2020-11-02 02:18:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Annihal8tr @sky_jack01 Try and break my record of 12 minutes
1322966132798726145 2020-11-02 02:18:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Xaenos @sky_jack01 It's honestly a good thing to try if you're struggling with addiction to adult content.
1322965965433393153 2020-11-02 02:17:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BKHei_ @sky_jack01 Sex appeal is powerful. Just like actual sex. There's a reason it sells, and a reason it can hold power over others. Find healthy relationships and work hard towards communication, trust, and compassion.  Btw I've failed nnn
1322965481746276352 2020-11-02 02:15:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PopuIarCats So cute!!  Might want to get out of that cup sooner or later
1322964211442606082 2020-11-02 02:10:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vw_wagner As a last point, the more attention you bring to drawn characters being "harmed", the less attention is brought to real children and minors in real distress. This is even proven to be a consequence as per the tax money of police when they are not focused on real threats.
1322963125281447939 2020-11-02 02:06:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vw_wagner With fictitious characters (not based on real kids), they are mostly drawings or pixelated animation that has no bearing on real life, if you are smart enough to discern fiction from reality. There is no correlation between drawn sexualized minors and real child rape/molestation.
1322962398936969222 2020-11-02 02:03:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vw_wagner @volcanik @thedelitesite I'm bringing that argument up because it is effectively the same principle here. If a real child is involved in sexual acts, it is despicable and horrible beyond words. Real Children should not take part in sexual activity. I'm pretty sure we agree on that. 1/2
1322961314919174145 2020-11-02 01:58:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @leviborne @EpochTimesChina @EpochTimes It started in a bat. Then some idiots decided to take it and modify it in a lab (I think it was in wuhan?). THEN it was released on the world back in november, and it spread after that...
1322960524481540097 2020-11-02 01:55:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ByModerator @EpochTimesChina @EpochTimes Yes, but sometimes the science is tough to find.  Unless you've lost all common sense
1322960133878648832 2020-11-02 01:54:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @overhaulck @GrimTwinDD She really is. Hakusho is one of my favorite anime, and I love it more than Jojo's Bizarre adventure.
1322958457587290112 2020-11-02 01:47:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BumShin2_ I don't know who the other one is, but Kurama is fantastic
1322957771961212928 2020-11-02 01:44:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vw_wagner @volcanik @thedelitesite On what basis am I an idiot? I'm separating reality from fiction. Please don't make me pull out the age old "video games/movies cause violence" thing. I'd really hope we're all past that.
1322957238982594560 2020-11-02 01:42:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RottynC Gameplay wise, it is generally Palla &gt; Catria &gt;&gt;&gt; Est Personality: Est &gt; Catria = Palla Backstory/Development: Catria &gt; Est &gt; Palla So overall.... Catria &gt; Palla &gt; Est
1322955687148793862 2020-11-02 01:36:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AnrdewK @TweetWordz Probably anti.  Trump would be a "he"
1322955124067753997 2020-11-02 01:34:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LukasHesketh @DamanArch @NadgeyFelicia The difference is that Dimitri learns to change and work through his hardships, and he is more interested in killing edelgard than killing everyone. At a certain point he's too far gone to care, and it's about bringing him back from the brink of despair and anger.
1322954534457585665 2020-11-02 01:31:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BeastBoom24 @NadgeyFelicia it's not just about war crimes. it's about the disregard for thousands of innocent lives for some stupid ideal that is only partially justified, and she forces everyone to do it. She is not a war criminal - she is a tyrannical dictator. Just like Stalin.
1322954010526179330 2020-11-02 01:29:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DamanArch @NadgeyFelicia People just disregard the horrible atrocities she committed because "her backstory" or "rhea is bad too". It's basically just diluting criticism. When the end includes millions of innocents dead, the means do not justify every other positive. Plus there's the Sothis dilemma.
1322952769700007936 2020-11-02 01:24:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KingRegulus2002 @TheRoseWarrior @ryntai The entirety of 3 houses consists of lots of recycled maps, so this argument could be placed for each and every route in the game.
1322952271358054401 2020-11-02 01:22:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NadgeyFelicia She's a dictator and her actions make about as much sense as drowning your cat to keep it from fearing water. Her battle dialogue with dimitri about "why don't you stop resisting?" is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard in a video game. Those are the main ones for me.
1322951259134058505 2020-11-02 01:18:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell Est, Elise, Ewan, Rolf, Cynthia, Patty, Pan/Parne, Marcia, Sylvia, Hilda (3H), Annette, and Alois.
1322949751122395139 2020-11-02 01:12:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone more like it's natural and holding that stuff in is as unhealthy as doing it every day.
1322949518409797632 2020-11-02 01:11:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheRealFierciLL Yes. But more to the point, people who hate gays do exist. There's a big difference between using fake language to your advantage, and actually understanding what you're talking about. I've tried to explain this many times to people who know nothing about psychology.
1322917913033117697 2020-11-01 23:06:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SN__Ivan @Goosaphone 70% of Americans are vitimin D deficient. Studies show that those deficient in vitimin D are 50% more likely to contract the virus, and even less likely to recover quickly. It's obvious, but people are stupid and don't know shit. Also blood type O apparently helps too.
1322915597869604874 2020-11-01 22:57:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AmoreSykes @Cyx_Sense @David29752828 @thedelitesite I love my mother and father, but that doesn't mean I want to fuck my mother and father. Love is more than just who you want to have sex with. You're a fucking moron.
1322914908548272129 2020-11-01 22:54:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheRealFierciLL @David29752828 You would spite people that don't exist? Neat.
1322914637327773703 2020-11-01 22:53:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BradinW @dienowwww @s0u7h9ark @lsince1977 @thedelitesite It was made to spread awareness. But it was made poorly and the consequences of the actions in the film aren't even severe. The film is legally ch!ld p0rn0graphy and nearly destroys its own message with the actions portrayed therin.  Plus the 600+ kids that auditioned...
1322913504647667714 2020-11-01 22:48:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vw_wagner @volcanik @thedelitesite If it is animated and is done well, that is fine. But if it involves real life children like that film did, (over 600) then it is disgusting and reprehensible.

1322696994448691202 2020-11-01 08:28:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sissie34486430 If it really is a pandemic, we would wear hazmat suits and there would be over 500 million deaths worldwide. That's what the prediction was for the end of the year. We aren't even at 300k for US alone. And even those numbers aren't 100% accurate.
1322695750585851905 2020-11-01 08:23:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WDoyleKit Isn't the 6% of the deaths from covid alone? Isn't there a whole nother 40% or so that died from conditions caused by covid? And no, not motorcycle accidents or attempted suicide.

A magnum opus is not just a peak - it is a testimate of your will to succeed.  You don't have to give up because this is your peak. You can move forward and do better - you may find new hights to soar to.

1322688918014332929 2020-11-01 07:56:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kaiverta @GrimTwinDD Yup. Don't you want to cooperate with your consumers? It's different than the basis of a retail environment where instead of product to seller to buyer, it's dorectly product to buyer. This makes it even more important to discuss pricing.
1322688222393225217 2020-11-01 07:53:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Criss_Chi @RealJamesWoods I read animal farm, but I never actually read 1984. Probably should at some point
1322687752874446849 2020-11-01 07:51:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tgrah69 After some careful consideration, I think the "issue" with this is a complete "whitewash" of characters, down to pale skin, blue eyes and blonde hair. It's like "blackwashing" white characters, which no one talks about. So if that is fine, why not this? They're fictional too.
1322687117022081027 2020-11-01 07:49:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SufficientPerc1 @RealJamesWoods I got my sources from other areas, but this sums up nearly everything perfectly. I think people need to so more research instead of reading 1 or 2 articles that have loose claims and then hold on to that as the explanation for masks working.

1322650141732573184 2020-11-01 05:22:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackWolf15 @VIZMedia @Crunchyroll @FUNimation @hulu It's a fun show, but the plot is frustrating because... holes.
1322649863281147909 2020-11-01 05:21:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Wicked89251604 @VIZMedia @Crunchyroll @FUNimation @hulu It wasn't meant to, from what i saw. It was more a refresher episode for people who haven't seen the original in years or an introduction for those who never saw the show. I think it worked well enough, but if the current plot wasn so washy.... I'd like yashahime show more.
1322649342008852486 2020-11-01 05:19:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bleach_girl913 @VIZMedia @Crunchyroll @FUNimation @hulu Finish the original show and final act. It's fantastic
1322648753967431682 2020-11-01 05:16:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @flamingopunch @Willanator93 I thought for a second he was going to show me how 1 is equal to 2.

1322647238468902912 2020-11-01 05:10:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FoxGodShrine @GrimTwinDD My favorite is Nosferatu(1922 silent film) but the best one I've seen is the Shining.

1322646672774696960 2020-11-01 05:08:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt I think we all k ow what's in Viridi's flask.  It may have something to do with pit being exhausted.  Or maybe I'm just perverted and am overlooking this. Great work!
1322645892671963136 2020-11-01 05:05:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen Why is it bad? I don't see anything wrong with this.
1322640321793134595 2020-11-01 04:43:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 I don't see any laws being broken.
1322600513330991107 2020-11-01 02:05:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Take your time. Yeesh. I know artists want to be precise and on time with illistration themes, but the only people who care are people who don't have lives to begin with. If this artwork is released in time with christmas, I'd still be happy. Cheers!
1322598775530074113 2020-11-01 01:58:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm I don't live in montreal. And if you get arrested for throwing a halloween party, not for any noise or drug/alchohol use, then that is absolutely disgusting.  It shouldn't be illegal to have fun and enjoy social time with friends and family.
1322596450082148357 2020-11-01 01:49:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm I cannot throw a party because I have no friends. But if people wish to do so, they can. It's not up to you if others have fun and live their lives. Not up to me, either.  We should, however, stay as safe as can be, and have a great Halloween.
1322595700094455812 2020-11-01 01:46:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I just found out that Sean Connery passed away today at age 90. From James Bond, to Indiana Jones, to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen... he starred in a lot of Cinematic classics. I love the man; I wish him the best in the afterlife, and my prayers go out to his family. RIP
1322594415475630080 2020-11-01 01:40:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Don_McFluffles Suuuure. Risk. Like the same risk of dying from a car crash, or suffering from literally any other illness that exists. Ryn is probably a nice person, but I don't agree with her on this.
1322593287681773574 2020-11-01 01:36:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Why don't you go to the class, tell everyone in there to mond their own goddamn business, and let me be? Is that too much to ask?
1322424394065563653 2020-10-31 14:25:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RiseFallNick One of my favorite movies
1322424281062625281 2020-10-31 14:24:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen Cool. You have fun. Now if you don't mind I'm going to go do some stuff.
1322423487072526337 2020-10-31 14:21:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @felloutofatree Yeah but shoelaces aren't based off of lies.
1322346866189676549 2020-10-31 09:17:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 They should have them. Like everyone else. I hate steve being in smash, but I'm not complaining about this shit anymore so I don't care.

1322344467328847873 2020-10-31 09:07:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ryntai Good. It's his business, not yours about mask wearing.
1322344154706436096 2020-10-31 09:06:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 No. That's my personal information. Bye

1322060757731823616 2020-10-30 14:20:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MinaCreamu Go ahead! Better late than never! No, really. If I can enjoy a horror movie around Christmas time,  people can enjoy your fantastic art a few days after Halloween. Even if it's a week it'll be fine. Just do what you love!
1322059750121578496 2020-10-30 14:16:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask Recovering and trying to get through a tough disease is what matters. As long as your team isn't in a life or death situation, they're gonna be fine for another week or so. Or however long it takes for you to get better. And believe it or not, staying hydrated is important! üëç
1322058923017461760 2020-10-30 14:13:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing Petra would probably be the best fit for the artstyle, imo. But any other FE gals that come to mind are not very popular so it won't matter.  I will say that Minerva might look nice.
1322058243280089088 2020-10-30 14:10:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rin_asobi Gotta stay hydrated
1322058109150498816 2020-10-30 14:09:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GGreaperalt Sort of. But you're  not that smart so I get it.

1321896795069435904 2020-10-30 03:28:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone MArth is a great protagonist. If you don't think so, you haven't played Shadow Dragon. Shadow Dragon marth is poggers. (I hope I used poggers right)
1321895265830318081 2020-10-30 03:22:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GGreaperalt @HornyAnimosity @is_xeo @ConnorEatsPants @elonmusk You're saying that even in a place filled with sarcasm, I have no right or privilege to be serious or have intellectual conversation? Stfu dude and go back to your mums basement
1321894799155318786 2020-10-30 03:20:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Yes. You also get 2 return rings in each generation. so 4 in total. (return brings you straight to the home castle.)
1321894524462006275 2020-10-30 03:19:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @incorrectkiseki I don't get it
1321718822789877760 2020-10-29 15:41:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HornyAnimosity @is_xeo @ConnorEatsPants @elonmusk Very funny. But still a serious thing to understand
1321698509213650944 2020-10-29 14:20:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @is_xeo @ConnorEatsPants @elonmusk Indeed. Which is why we shouldn't try to create abominations of nature beyond our control, or robots that distance us from the very thing that makes himanity worth it. So do some serious contemplation on the subject before you just accept whatever your hormones tell you to.
1321697968098058240 2020-10-29 14:18:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ConnorEatsPants For speaking the hard truth, you've earned a follower.
1321697021762379776 2020-10-29 14:15:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @elonmusk @LabEcchi No.
1321696067927289856 2020-10-29 14:11:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz In each chapter, your home castle is the one you start in. You need to be at your home/starting castle to promote. In chapter 1 and 2,  this is Evans castle. This sounds tedius, but you do get items and staves that let you get to castles instantly so promoting isn't a hastle.
1321695141908959232 2020-10-29 14:07:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @valkyrie_niko @gardnerverse @Polyle1 @hiryouman Well of course. They're from hell.

1321625297775693824 2020-10-29 09:30:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Sadly, you can only promote characters from first teir to 2nd. And you may only do so once a character reaches level 20. To do this, you must select promote or class change from the home castle near the start of the map.
1321616817274658821 2020-10-29 08:56:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Sweet! Did you give him Jamke's Killer bow? Or is that going to a promoted arden?
1321616183599222786 2020-10-29 08:53:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> I know the FE 1 Switch localization hype has died down, but I just remembered this existed.  Whoever wrote this gem of a parody, I (and many other FE fans) thank you.   https://t.co/WgvaY3aqB7
1321615093960970246 2020-10-29 08:49:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ErrorFailz Oof. I always forget this guy because he's generic and never really does anything meaningful for my army. It's sad because he's actually quite good!  .... When promoted.

1321553241860120577 2020-10-29 04:43:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Kink shaming is wrong.  Wait is that what this is?

1321550034165551104 2020-10-29 04:30:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Falchion_Z @spamuhell When I saw Velvet's design for the first time I thought, "this goth gal is the protagonist!? Sign me up!" But now I realize I don't have enough money to get this game on anything but PC, and even then It will take months to afford a pc capable of running pc games.
1321549541771010048 2020-10-29 04:28:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell It's difficult cor me to pick a favorite,  because mine comes from a visual novel and most will say those don't count as games. Even then, it's tough to narrow down who I love the most and why. I obviously like shanoa from castlevania, but the why is... not very compelling.
1321324631647756289 2020-10-28 13:35:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nowicanowi @ChainOfLinks571 I agree. I don't like the two party system. If we go to a second civil war over this crap then I'm bringing back the bull moose party.

1321320918942175232 2020-10-28 13:20:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen I mean most do go eventually.... hm....  Oh, I know! Iggy!  Because Polnaref wasn't annoying - he was one of the 2 best characters in the part. Like, he gave up a woman who might love him to protect her from the pain and suffering/danger of living with a stand user!

1321141309135093760 2020-10-28 01:26:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Ok?
1321138958080815110 2020-10-28 01:17:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @super_fight_ @InsiderFood I agree. However, the person who eats this needs to either share it or take it slowly. Once in a lifetime treat? Sure. Just be sure to balance your intake of different foods regularly. Even in moderation, sugar in this quantity is extremely unhealthy.
1321137783247982592 2020-10-28 01:12:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 They don't play "completely different". It's still classic Fire Emblem at the core of things. Reclassing and gaidens improve player choice and replay ability. You're exaggerating. And Less kris is good, unless they're gonna give kris a better personality. Don't need remakes.
1321137162461601794 2020-10-28 01:10:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sunstrid3r_ @CrownGamer901 Fair Warning about Yashahime.... the plot itself is silly and raises more questions with each episode. Other than that it's fun!
1321136908689354755 2020-10-28 01:09:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 Yes it is. IMO, it's up there with DBZ, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece.  A fun, colorful cast of characters, a good story, decent plot involving romance sub-plots, and if you include the final act, it's all 200-ish episodes. Can be binged in a week if you have the time.
1321080525466095617 2020-10-27 21:25:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TSC55524538 @OstieMama @croweadam @drdavidsamadi Pics or it didn't happen.  But for real if this is true then I don't need to wear a face diaper at work.
1321079227379232771 2020-10-27 21:20:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Pumpkin because a succubus will probably make the rounds with other artistic influence. I'd say go for Pumpkin - it seems like the more unique choice of the two
1321078932356108289 2020-10-27 21:18:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @justifaizy never thought I would need this. 100% agree
1320988551174066176 2020-10-27 15:19:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen This is why Mario X Daisy, Luigi X Rosalina, and Wario X Pauline are the best ships.  Huh? Waluigi? Yeah his ship is the PT 109. It sank back in WW2
1320986773816778753 2020-10-27 15:12:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rakeemspoon Sounds like something most of us need nowadays. Go for it, if you want!
1320986057542979586 2020-10-27 15:09:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen Yeah... just let kids be kids.
1320985293047144450 2020-10-27 15:06:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Nah. I still use any unit I want because I like having fun and flexibility in my strategy RPG.  So f^ck LTC runs I do what I want
1320982669388324869 2020-10-27 14:56:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Glad you're safe and sound.
1320981948127432705 2020-10-27 14:53:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Connomore, yes. But Dayan? Bro. The dude has a talk with 2 other characters about religion. Plus he has inatant S rank bows so you know he's good. But yes, he is one of the most forgettable men of the GBA FE's.
1320981457553285120 2020-10-27 14:51:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily *looks
1320981401869701120 2020-10-27 14:51:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Is it bad that I don't notice it loos bad?
1320981164790849536 2020-10-27 14:50:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell @ChainOfLinks571 I enjoy a good thigh squeeze, but not to that extent. I hate headaches as it is, so suffocation is at the bottom of my list.
1320980823840051201 2020-10-27 14:49:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Who the hell are in the 2nd option?
1320980409157562368 2020-10-27 14:47:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic They're putting pollutants in the water to turn the frogs gay! XD  It would be interesting to say the least.
1320979181677797376 2020-10-27 14:42:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato Wtf did you do? (If it was following me, that's fair. I'm not the nicest guy you're gonna meet let's be honest here.)
1320978842132111360 2020-10-27 14:41:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Number 6 is rediculous, apart from extended supports and voice acting. A remake of a remake of a remake is beyond silly.
1320867199628808193 2020-10-27 07:17:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Adz77118931 Absolutely. I consider it the best game on the Nintendo 64 console, and many consider it to be a masterpiece.
1320866578427191296 2020-10-27 07:15:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda Mine was a Journey Concert
1320858380098064384 2020-10-27 06:42:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CrownGamer901 Maybe now,?
1320858228666830854 2020-10-27 06:41:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimmelsDaThird Cause reasons
1320857848436428801 2020-10-27 06:40:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala I have no choice but to agree
1320857653204189184 2020-10-27 06:39:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 I was just talking to a friend about Elice, marth's sister. She gets almost 0 fan art outside of niche japanese artists and as a lover of elice its very sad.
1320836450288652288 2020-10-27 05:15:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AstralStrife Then how do you explain universal healthcare?  Ok that was a bad joke
1320835824624242698 2020-10-27 05:12:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BlackGallade I've never seen spiderverse. But even then I think frozen needs to gtfo
1320835576577359873 2020-10-27 05:11:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Bismix4 Things happen. I once opened a bag of ghirardelli dark chocolate.  There was one fully sealed wrapper with NO chocolate in it!  Factories aren't perfect.
1320835042009059334 2020-10-27 05:09:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm You are 100% right. It's ok to be afraid. It's not ok to cower forever in the shadow of your fears.
1320834410304950280 2020-10-27 05:07:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc I get it!  Vegeta, in the distance: Shut up, Nappa.
1320834177550483457 2020-10-27 05:06:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Good luck
1320799548021854213 2020-10-27 02:48:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tridisart @Willanator93 This looks insanely beautiful!!  Before I saw your art, I never considered just how pretty Elincia is. Thank you for showing me the light.
1320793483729379334 2020-10-27 02:24:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Brenzicure @tommietomm #Tummietomm ? No?
1320788960424136705 2020-10-27 02:06:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NestleBloxBen Frozen. Why? Because you need to let it go.
1320788847341539328 2020-10-27 02:06:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen oof
1320788684090810373 2020-10-27 02:05:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm I still don't get it
1320787408212951042 2020-10-27 02:00:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 oof
1320786058888597506 2020-10-27 01:55:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KPlorable @erinebal29 @Phreadys That's really sad if it's true. And my supervisor told me I'm a degenerate for using Bing. HA!
1320785367809826818 2020-10-27 01:52:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen um...  there are other ways to get a healthy dose of sodium, you know. ü§ó
1320785107410735105 2020-10-27 01:51:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @violette_galaxy This looks fantastic!!   The hard work really payed off, and I really like how authentic Deirdre's robe looks
1320784477174583300 2020-10-27 01:48:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kenzakisen You're not wrong! He can spit fire too, so that makes him even hotter!
1320603170918273030 2020-10-26 13:48:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mugendaiyo Well that's freaking petty
1320602021708374016 2020-10-26 13:43:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AvaWritesAlot @DarkAdvent01 His past is a tough one. He travelled the world with his best friend, but sadly died trying to convey the message to his comrades: Time Stop. And ever since he died miles away from his family, he was reincarnated into a loptyr mage.
1320601578383003654 2020-10-26 13:42:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS I only know 3 for the same reasons. And hey, that's pretty good!
1320601360014974976 2020-10-26 13:41:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LilithLitheArt Nintendo's shady limited time business practice.
1320600788411076608 2020-10-26 13:38:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @startingarcher @DarkAdvent01 No. If the guy likes tomboys let him. Best of both worlds. It's like having a friend, but it's actually a woman.  Nothing wrong with it.
1320600415180890112 2020-10-26 13:37:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 I'm at 11
1320566286045294592 2020-10-26 11:21:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NadgeyFelicia If it was by force, then why go on twitter about it before reporting it to authorities? I can only assume it was via your request to do so.
1320564133524365312 2020-10-26 11:13:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 @aphelionns Another word for being embarrassed about sexual topics. It's pointless, IMO.
1320563724026060801 2020-10-26 11:11:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell @ChainOfLinks571 I feel the same way. We need to stick together

1320532879538085890 2020-10-26 09:09:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @robertdoran63 Could you direct me with a link to the web page? I tried finding it on my own and I couldn't. Apparently I could only find halloween regulations.
1320530679751430144 2020-10-26 09:00:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Greg19711 @RealJamesWoods Gross.

1320529355773280257 2020-10-26 08:55:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ekrrrLuOK5BACZI But the laptop isn't good enough evidence in court of law. Only computers are worth it.
1320528748593242113 2020-10-26 08:52:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vavafle_ @DarkAdvent01 Good. She deserved it after choosing Edelgard
1320528503356432386 2020-10-26 08:51:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Huh. Never thought about that one before. Teaching someone what's wrong in an attempt to better his/her life might be effective.
1320527978581970945 2020-10-26 08:49:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Nicely done!
1320527781474803715 2020-10-26 08:48:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Well... that sucks. Looks like I need to be biden my time
1320527285276057600 2020-10-26 08:46:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato Ok but that's a regular muffin. I don't see where the semen comes in.  Hah.
1320526828231102464 2020-10-26 08:45:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Me included. Just don't act like you know everything like you usually do and we'll be fine
1320526527008808961 2020-10-26 08:43:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato ?
1320477370210525186 2020-10-26 05:28:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato Yep. It's not good.
1320477205005258759 2020-10-26 05:27:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 I don't get it.
1320453246515879941 2020-10-26 03:52:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nicker47659174 So If I play among us on a streaming platform that makes me more qualified to govern a city-state? And, it also automatically makes me a better person? Wow! Guess I betted do that, then!  You better do some serious thinking about how you see the world, bud.
1320426436495376385 2020-10-26 02:06:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Crimson_Mayhem_ You have a point

1320425339068289025 2020-10-26 02:01:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @theomegayato High in zinc, iron, and good for your brain!  And if you fry one and put it on a chicken/cheese croissant, it's to die for!
1320424711541661697 2020-10-26 01:59:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealCandaceO @DanBensonMusic Good luck with the child.   I don't know how else to be supportive
1320424424449941504 2020-10-26 01:58:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WolfeyGlick @Goosaphone Not that diff--- I have beaten Castlevania 3 on the NES and I can't get past the 3rd Gym in Pokemon saphire!
1320423967048564743 2020-10-26 01:56:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JMG_PartyBean @LabEcchi Ok, so it's just a sitting position, or rather, being stationary/inactive by sitting.
1320423666195275779 2020-10-26 01:55:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JMG_PartyBean @LabEcchi Sedentary? Gonna look that one up.  üôè I just don't know what the word means.
1320423384325521413 2020-10-26 01:54:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AddVibes This is true, but it so happens that the souls I meet are mostly evil.
1320423075599536137 2020-10-26 01:52:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @alexbruesewitz @DanBensonMusic @realDonaldTrump @DukeNext "President Trump has done more for black America than any President since  Lincoln."  I'm sorry, but what data backs this up?  Trump has done a good job as president. (proving me wrong back in 2016) However, comparing him to Lincoln seems a bit of a stretch.

1320421259625353217 2020-10-26 01:45:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap I don't mean to be rude, but can you make some american-style food?  It's not a bad way to tide the craving over
1320420849791492099 2020-10-26 01:43:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ I wish I knew something about him.
1320420497671266305 2020-10-26 01:42:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ oof. Looks like Ferryn or Erynis/Fury.
1320420091314528257 2020-10-26 01:40:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Sydsnap If she still talks to you after this, she still loves you. And people who truly love you will help you in hard times. Keep your chin up and keep working hard!  Don't take that out of context
1320419563448815618 2020-10-26 01:38:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @__Espeon You know nothing about economics.
1320419338554384386 2020-10-26 01:37:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku I can ignore everything you say now that I know you are a troll.
1320419050590244864 2020-10-26 01:36:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Swift_Saturn @DarkAdvent01 That is a fair statement. But you forget awakening has a system that is only revisited in one other game and it dominates any good strategic planning or use of resources.   So if you can't get awakening, try starting with 3 houses, as it is easily accessable. SD and SS too.
1320418494295478272 2020-10-26 01:34:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_deeKei You got this! Go big or go home, as they say.
1320418379891695618 2020-10-26 01:34:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 All the more reason to write it.
1320418162568007680 2020-10-26 01:33:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 You wouldn't. You didn't lie about being cat called. Being cat called isn't the worst thing to happen to someone either.
1320248341469462529 2020-10-25 14:18:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Who is this from?

1320242491174563842 2020-10-25 13:55:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JonComms See, this would be great. Even though I'd only exist in a ball for most of my life, I get to interact with others.
1320241045796458496 2020-10-25 13:49:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IntroSpecktive This is both funny and wrong. I love it
1320240722335965184 2020-10-25 13:48:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD It's not. It's more full of James Woods than anything.  It depresses me a little.
1320239984381747200 2020-10-25 13:45:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Purple? I guess.  Sometimes you say good stuff and have good things to share but every once in a while it's just.... what in the world are you on about?  Overall good in faith and at heart.
1320239283492560897 2020-10-25 13:42:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkThrowback That's not how all police work and you know it.
1320239133768417280 2020-10-25 13:41:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Thanks for the head's up.
1320238754834075648 2020-10-25 13:40:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OfehrmediaPress @RealJamesWoods Eh.  I wouldn't say it is 100% the voter's fault. Media and those who are twisted have a lot of power. Succumbing to such power is sometimes a coping mechanism because you don't want to deal with the stress of fighting back.  The truth can be too harsh for some.

1320236119951368192 2020-10-25 13:29:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 I know that feeling. Either It's burn out of the highest calibur, or there's not enough incentive to keep going. When you think about it, there's no real end goal in heroes. There's nothing to strive for or come back to in a manner of goals.  It's just about the prizes.
1320235609756151809 2020-10-25 13:27:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @stan_chowder Funny. Now tell me when I should laugh.

He has good base speed to double most enemies in act 1, he gets bases of increased defense and strength, and any statistical increase of speed helps improve that threshold for most of the game. Low move? Please. You have warp with infinate range. Don't make me laugh.

It's one of the best options for him in the og gaiden, really. You'd think that mage or cav works, but he's crap. Myrm and Soldier are your only options for 'ol BIRD.

I've never beaten a pokemon game, and the only one I've played is either the pinball spin off, red on a game boy at my cousin's house over 16 years ago, and saphire about 4 years ago.

1319847046363348992 2020-10-24 11:43:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Yeah my sleep schedule is messed up too. My best advice is to read for 20 minutes before bed every night and go to bed at a reasonable hour. like 9PM-11PM. and when I say read, I don't mean read fanfiction on your phone or read tweets on a laptop/tablet. I mean get a paper book.

I'll be dressing up as a jp sniper with a smart-ass retort for everything under the sun.  Either that or going as myself. Because according to the women I work with, I'm as scary as it gets!

1319844481613615105 2020-10-24 11:33:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Talk to your teacher. See what your class policy is on late assignments. If there is light leeway, talk to your professor and try to work out a solution.  If not, turn it in on time. You can polish a turd, but you can't polish nothing. Same with turning in assignments.

1319693911493935111 2020-10-24 01:35:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 For me, it's a toss up between mario 64 and sunshine. Galaxy and oddesy are too good. I'd day 64, simply because there's no other context. Does this mean not existing? Does this mean wiping it from the world from this moment forward? I dunno. But Oddesy and Galaxy stay. 100%
1319692970078228482 2020-10-24 01:31:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 @PrecedeEmblem Because the game was intended to punish poor decision making. The rewinding eliminates challenge because the skill system doesn't exist and it's a bare-bones FE game.

1319526008656187392 2020-10-23 14:28:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blaklamb Meep-Meep mother f^cker
1319525401761296384 2020-10-23 14:25:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dhabbal I mean I don't want to die, but my life isn't worth living if it's going to be spent inside for years. So I kinda get where she's coming from.
1319524999087247360 2020-10-23 14:24:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @missquinzel4 I don't know what it is and I'm just trying to figure out if the road runner was caught. All jokes aside though I think that kids missing regardless of who's responsible is a tragedy.
1319524376933531649 2020-10-23 14:21:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealJamesWoods I suppose my IQ is around 15 then. I thought so at first, but then I thought... "that's not possible. The kid would be dead, not in our country."
1319524049727459329 2020-10-23 14:20:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dhabbal I don't get it
1319522855827218432 2020-10-23 14:15:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VirtualRyo What's next? Completely merge with with your computer bacause you're afraid of real life? Stop talking while your brain still works.
1319521241716396033 2020-10-23 14:09:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LilyPichu Whatever
1319520096491048961 2020-10-23 14:04:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ElMelloiNY @ChazAriaLLC From how his hair looks in some of his videos,  I wouldn't be surprised. XD
1319519741527134208 2020-10-23 14:03:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC Ok, cool. I guess it has marth be useful so...  yeah. I still like Shadow dragon more because writing and customization
1319519282062151681 2020-10-23 14:01:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EliSantiagoNY @RealJamesWoods Yes. Sadly I can't afford my own home right now, so I'm stuck with my family's lights.
1319518363073368066 2020-10-23 13:57:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @0rangeDark @RealJamesWoods Thanks. I will be mindful of this in the future
1319517860562145280 2020-10-23 13:55:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChazAriaLLC And after all the hope I put into you.... you betray us...  Seriously though have you PLAYED FE1!?
1319482303685496832 2020-10-23 11:34:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SinHurtsUs @RealJamesWoods @JoeBiden The sad thing is 70% of the people on social media platforms who support BLM are doing so because the idea is appealing for equality.  I bet you my whole paycheck that most don't know what marxism is.
1319481899644059648 2020-10-23 11:32:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ronben0511 He said he would transition to other green alternatives. Oil is numbered. But how much this will impact current jobs: that is the issue.
1319481512081973248 2020-10-23 11:31:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RealJamesWoods I am going to sound ignorant. But is fracking bad?
1319481092781625345 2020-10-23 11:29:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blaklamb Hey, some people are saying trump's taxes are an issue, but I don't think so. Otherwise the IRS would be all over his ass.
1319478446133739523 2020-10-23 11:19:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @julies2121 @Nux_Taku Gender and color of the moderator doesn't mean crap.
1319477885170782209 2020-10-23 11:16:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeevedLatias @ChainOfLinks571 Ew. Well ok... Good for the sisters then.
1319477711488897026 2020-10-23 11:16:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ryntai I'm sorry to hear that. I had to put my first cat to sleep (his name was elvis) due to a tumor in his stomach. I know how you feel, and if you need help, we're here for ya.
1319469374865088513 2020-10-23 10:43:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeevedLatias @ChainOfLinks571 I don't get it
1319467299431219202 2020-10-23 10:34:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JkScruf I'm sorry... the f^ck is this?
1319466535799431173 2020-10-23 10:31:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 @SeverusIpps_ Still better than putting Reese's Pieces, Skittles, and M&amp;M's in the same bowl.
1319466053609705473 2020-10-23 10:29:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Anatomy of the human body is natural. It is only loooood if tue sins of yesteryear are not clensed.
1319459216386609153 2020-10-23 10:02:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 I don't get it
1319459101265592320 2020-10-23 10:02:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Same here. But it could be worse. Appreciate what you have. And strive to improve so you can live better and do better.
1319458017578987522 2020-10-23 09:58:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Ok now I get it. Rip Chuggs. Mah boi
1319457412458422272 2020-10-23 09:55:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 Mostly a joke. It's done very well. But I still dislike the whole "follow up" crap.
1319457231419691008 2020-10-23 09:54:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 @ShitMattheo I love shadow dragon to death amd the killing characters for gaidens didn't matter much to me. Plus I think He has a decent point here... But hey at least it's out there for people who want it and haven't experienced the OG FE 1.
1319456647094456320 2020-10-23 09:52:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Chugga L?
1319455599206289410 2020-10-23 09:48:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dylanjw10 Samson is the better unit but arran has better weapons. It depends on the kind of team you have and how you want to play the game.
1319455126340489217 2020-10-23 09:46:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 I hate "follow up". Bad translation.
1319454761637318656 2020-10-23 09:45:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 This makes ZERO goddamn sense. Plus, CtAp is about as necessary as breathing when you go places or interact with others. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
1319454270887002112 2020-10-23 09:43:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 @CatriaThicc   Catria is amazing, but we must remember the true queen: bEST.
1319453977642213376 2020-10-23 09:41:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe You... uh.... fuck  You are a man of culture. Please forgive me
1319316634545180672 2020-10-23 00:36:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BitnerdGX Sweet!
1319314587670487040 2020-10-23 00:28:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe Same. It would be less weird if I had IRL friends...
1319314075868868626 2020-10-23 00:26:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @videojames_ I'm laughing at this more than I should be
1319313788030550016 2020-10-23 00:24:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IntroSpecktive I love a good burger, not gonna lie.  Sorry!
1319312615894560770 2020-10-23 00:20:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @eiriseth The FE 4 manga is a treat
1319312104818675717 2020-10-23 00:18:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 interesting
1319312000913125379 2020-10-23 00:17:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Froakiebloke @ThePontusAnd @theprinceofiris Fun fact: Pachyderm means elephant.
1319310983618285569 2020-10-23 00:13:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UnLockii Marthipan, please
1319310465319784448 2020-10-23 00:11:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Please don't do this
1319309694041731074 2020-10-23 00:08:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 This is nice. But why is it not part of the nintendo NES online thing?
1319309236933955585 2020-10-23 00:06:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HailOfYune @SYG64 Honestly I followed that guide losely back when I had only beaten shadow dragon 4 or 5 times
1319153433375657984 2020-10-22 13:47:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Baller2184 @Annakhait I'm sorry, but I am taking that image. It's hilarious

1319151429010022400 2020-10-22 13:39:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @perry658 No one did except corporate media. That's it.
1319150316676435969 2020-10-22 13:35:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Oh my.  If you can't afford it, that's ok. Please be responsible with your money.  Good luck!
1319149920092364800 2020-10-22 13:33:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bridgetdonegal @Kenny_Sowellfan Welp. I'm done with my life, then. Mom, dad... It's been a good run!
1319149109748600832 2020-10-22 13:30:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Ok but it's hilarious
1319148827883044872 2020-10-22 13:29:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 O-ok
1319148709985292288 2020-10-22 13:28:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 That's an oof. And I don't even know what a fucc boi is.
1319095656003342336 2020-10-22 09:58:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KomradeSnoipah2 Prove that capitalism is more evil than Marxism.
1319093862091182080 2020-10-22 09:50:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt 9/10
1319092926178316289 2020-10-22 09:47:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MrMichaelBurkes @DanBensonMusic I already voted. Who? I'll keep that to myself. But I don't like Biden's tax policy.
1319092510501801991 2020-10-22 09:45:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EricEDurnan Human vs technology is a struggle mankind often forgets. Because behind the technology is an evil heart waiting to attack.
1319091857712943104 2020-10-22 09:43:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @justifaizy @DarkAdvent01 I don't understand
1319091646777249792 2020-10-22 09:42:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HillelArt @PJiggles_ No, it's a ploy. But nice try
1319091183549894656 2020-10-22 09:40:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EricEDurnan Hasn't China desired to rule the world for centuries?
1319090575405088769 2020-10-22 09:37:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kenny_Sowellfan My question is this: Wtf is critical race theory?
1319088896970526720 2020-10-22 09:31:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I forgot!
1319088540538572800 2020-10-22 09:29:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GameXplain @Gregster1998 Cool. Now tell me something I'd care about
1319087846138007552 2020-10-22 09:27:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HailOfYune @SYG64 He's playing it wrong. Godin is not absolute garbage. Why? You can grind him up in chapter 1
1319087584077877248 2020-10-22 09:26:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Falchion_Z Well palla is only good for her stats. Everything else about her is overrated.
1319086466966892551 2020-10-22 09:21:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NadgeyFelicia Why are you bored?
1319086117195534336 2020-10-22 09:20:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Pan and Salem, mostly because the rest are crap.
1319082023865208832 2020-10-22 09:03:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm What the hell does that mean?
1318977376244686853 2020-10-22 02:08:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EpochTimes Not only that, it almost fucks over artists who do terribly with quote tweets
1318976690538782721 2020-10-22 02:05:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EthlynThighs776 From shadow dragon, I would have to say my most hated map is chapter 20. Camus is cool, but screw the generic cronies bro. Ambush spawns suck
1318975922691657729 2020-10-22 02:02:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe Good luck.  And if it's over, I hope you do well.   And fo study next time!
1318963257227489282 2020-10-22 01:12:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MatttGFX @DarkAdvent01 Oh shut up
1318955864947101696 2020-10-22 00:42:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DeetvarSilesia I've never had caldo. Now I want to try it.
1318952971816886274 2020-10-22 00:31:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ Most likely gaiden silque.  Or... silk.
1318952685866045443 2020-10-22 00:29:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MinaCreamu Annette is my favourite of the blue lions and I'm glad to see you draw her! Great work!

1318782720290508801 2020-10-21 13:14:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD @kinkymation I mean... they were show-offy.  And for something as minute as candy, no less. But all in good fun!
1318782060811735040 2020-10-21 13:11:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD Oh, and this isn't about goku, but I followed you because your bio had me at "Botan".
1318781818729005056 2020-10-21 13:11:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GrimTwinDD I don't hate him,  but I don't love him either. He's a bad father but he cares for most people.  Bright side is he eats a lot like me!  Vageeta is better. Change my mind.
1318773662674288640 2020-10-21 12:38:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NowaPLS Badass character designs? Either that or Horror anime would be my theme choice.
1318772832843800582 2020-10-21 12:35:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GifZelda Snoopdog's old friend
1318769577233362949 2020-10-21 12:22:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe For being awesome? You don't need to apologize for that.  But all flattery aside, I hope you're doing ok. My DMs are open if you want to vent.
1318769199590871041 2020-10-21 12:20:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 That is disgusting
1318769049745166336 2020-10-21 12:20:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws Happy birthday! (?) I don't know if it is or not but I wish you a good one.  And I have no clue what beidou means so yeah...
1318768603760644098 2020-10-21 12:18:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 I like me a good milkshake. But uh... I think we have more important matters on our hands.
1318768226931740672 2020-10-21 12:17:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JCampbe49540378 Eh.  I really don't know about that. I'd like to believe most people are sound and do research to come to their own conclusions, but I really don't know. Idiocracy is a movie that is slowly becoming the way of the future.  Thanks, VR.
1318767698302636033 2020-10-21 12:14:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @revell_buddy I hope utah stays as is for a while.
1318766740482949127 2020-10-21 12:11:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MarkHMeyer Is it even possible to read such information? The government keeps tons of stuff from people anyways.
1318765336452280321 2020-10-21 12:05:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic I voted too.  Early, and in person. I mean If masks keep us safe, why not vote in person? I see no reason not to. As for who I voted for... that's a secret for now.
1318764542017634304 2020-10-21 12:02:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 Well, here's the thing. There are people who will deny the truth so much that it's impossible to talk with them. Like the flat earthers or the doofuses who think we faked the moon landing.
1318764219303677954 2020-10-21 12:01:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 I'm going to get rid of ike
1318763798656880640 2020-10-21 11:59:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SlashClaw14 @Umutsol02 The update made me verify I wasn't a bot. RIP

1318761873437851648 2020-10-21 11:51:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LadyLiberTea @blaklamb Ah
1318612524552589312 2020-10-21 01:58:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc @Sherwood_Red Yes? What does that have to do with this? The dairy isle doesn't match up with the other image
1318612374820167680 2020-10-21 01:57:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rainbowfirebird @DarkAdvent01 And those who try to do it better without any knowledge of human nature or willingness to treat others with respect will meet the same faults as hitler, mao, and stalin
1318612030618800131 2020-10-21 01:56:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 @Roytheboi5 Yup. But history is also important. It's because people don't know accurate history worldwide that we have some of the cultural problems we see right now
1318611017186873350 2020-10-21 01:52:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JaceCear @Shauna_c_jones Do some research on what "nazi" stood for.

1318606904260689926 2020-10-21 01:35:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rainbowfirebird @DarkAdvent01 And without history you will repeat the doom and destruction of the past.
1318606649184129024 2020-10-21 01:34:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic Self hating jews? That's the 3rd time I've heard that. I don;t know if it's important enough to research., Same with antisemite
1318606343620775937 2020-10-21 01:33:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 @Roytheboi5 Math is the only one I really dislike. All of these are super important, and most people in today's society don't have any basic knowledge of either subject.
1318605934906822656 2020-10-21 01:32:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RevangerRed It's also hard to provide for one's family in a lockdown. Don't talk shit.
1318586256859844609 2020-10-21 00:13:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ArtgameXP Happy birthday!
1318585679253819398 2020-10-21 00:11:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm When did you stop being cool? To me, you never stopped being cool
1318584880507355143 2020-10-21 00:08:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EchoofDarkness It has more like 3 issues. It's a stupid, more dark joke, but it doesn't condone horrible actions. It's funny because it fits the stereotype of gheb.  If it happened for real, I'd be purely disgusted. But this is fictitious and not worth complaining about. Let people laugh.
1318584039989743619 2020-10-21 00:05:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone It's meant as a joke. Because gheb is an awful piece of shit. Just because this shit is out there doesn't mean it is condoned.
1318583605241761795 2020-10-21 00:03:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc You like dragon ball.  I don't think this is that deep so it's fine. People like stuff.
1318582803576049664 2020-10-21 00:00:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @plutojumpz I don't care what the point is. Cases don't matter more than deaths. Since this is a virus that is 99% survivable, deaths are a better measure of safety vs risk than pure case numbers.
1318582489309450240 2020-10-20 23:58:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JWebster49 @ig_mewx I said treatment. Not cure. Zinc helps cells stay strong and there are things out there that can act as a zinc ionophore or even block the proteins that this virus has. Sars-cov2 isn't bad because it's stronger than the flu. It's bad because it targets more fragile organs.
1318581535113662466 2020-10-20 23:55:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TyBrennan6 Which country?
1318581212097794048 2020-10-20 23:53:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TyBrennan6 Stop what? I'm trying to be optimistic
1318426977150304256 2020-10-20 13:41:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rin_asobi This made my night a lot better. Thank you, Rin!
1318424330636791808 2020-10-20 13:30:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @nomadicgoose See, some optimism is welcomed and encouraged!
1318423978281717760 2020-10-20 13:29:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xincmars It constantly mutates and adapts just like the common cold. That's also why a vaccine would be both less effective and costly. A vaccine would help, but it wouldn't be a cure all.
1318423652673650688 2020-10-20 13:27:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jestikii @IntroSpecktive Lockdowns postpone the inevitable. You would need to be locked down for at least 6 more years to get it to "near purgable" levels. And that is country wide mandatory lockdown with extreme measures to prevent the average citizen from being out and about.
1318423021854597121 2020-10-20 13:25:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ig_mewx Funny, but not 100%. Viruses have infinite health. But it isn't hopeless. Yeah, a vaccine would be nice, but you know, we do have other treatments available that are much more cost efficient. Like gin and tonic for the adults. (With zinc in the tonic)
1318422348522020864 2020-10-20 13:22:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AdamOsom69 @IntroSpecktive We'll be fine.
1318422285527764992 2020-10-20 13:22:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @light_phos @IntroSpecktive Don't let the cure be worse than the disease.
1318422183560073216 2020-10-20 13:21:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CapsEatsTraps @IntroSpecktive How many of these are deaths, and how many deaths are of children?
1318422001497874433 2020-10-20 13:21:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @69ScottFan @IntroSpecktive We would be in it forever regardless of what happens.
1318421883998658560 2020-10-20 13:20:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @googlytin @IntroSpecktive Do you know why 3rd or 2nd waves happen, or why viruses like influenza are seasonal?
1318421564954652677 2020-10-20 13:19:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sonicopi_ @IntroSpecktive Viruses and diseases don't go away. Vaccines and other medical treatments/cures can only counteract them.  Remember the black plague? It is extremely rare to get it today, but it is still possible. This virus will be around forever, but we have what we need to fight it right now.
1318420908206399488 2020-10-20 13:16:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DudeCole110 If I may, I can dm you and shed a small ammount of light on the subject. I too, was once in the confused state you seem to be, and I wish to help. But in the meantime, have a good day.
1318420231958761473 2020-10-20 13:14:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IntroSpecktive @DarkAdvent01 It's called seasonal.  You know, the thing all other viruses are about? It's not about human error. It's about the change in temperature, moisture in the air, and other conditions that aid virus travel. Viruses don't go away. Learn to live with it inspite of fear.
1318411096722690048 2020-10-20 12:37:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @peachieteas Sigurd
1318402016411004928 2020-10-20 12:01:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Hideki_Naganuma @DarkAdvent01 It costs respect and communication. But otherwise it is free.
1318400993336459267 2020-10-20 11:57:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Leigh_ATL_SAV @perMahogany @RileyTimbrook @icecube Honestly I never even knew planned parenthood existed until last year. I keep meaning to do research on it, but I'm not a father, nor have I dated. So I really have few reasons to look into it.
1318398768878915585 2020-10-20 11:48:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LRPerry4 @ChrisJayLV @vmaclive @icecube China has existed far longer than america.  I want to believe america is better, but you know... apparently a country being around longer means it's better
1318397718134489088 2020-10-20 11:44:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @idalyssg @DanBensonMusic @realDonaldTrump Thank you for voting. For whom does not matter. But thank you
1318396919501279233 2020-10-20 11:41:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hitsukuya @Klaius Is she optional too?
1318396257384222720 2020-10-20 11:38:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Colintelli Hmm... so If I start fearing women,  I might find myself a partner and won't have to be lonely forever!
1318395289938649090 2020-10-20 11:35:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JohnCaden64 Yeah FF 14 has issues. Minor ones, but issues nonetheless
1318394005994995713 2020-10-20 11:30:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @aesurah @cam_strach @TaylorRMarshall I was reading a visual novel that talked about this kind of thing, but with manga. Basically, even if it isn't helpful academically or physically, you can still have somethingromto bond with other kids or other people with. Social skills are valuable too.
1318391468189470720 2020-10-20 11:19:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @VirtuaJoshua Your pet will destroy it
1318391169345257472 2020-10-20 11:18:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tridisart Thank you for enlightening me.
1318355573528723457 2020-10-20 08:57:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Aaron_Margolin @poochy_lily Seems pretty cringy
1318355404385038337 2020-10-20 08:56:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing I followed you because It's more exposure to decent art that I wouldn't find otherwise. 2 heads better than 1. Also you're not too corrupt so there's that going for ya.  Cheers!
1318342586415927296 2020-10-20 08:05:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blaklamb Who is the guy on the right? I assume the left guy is Zuccerberg
1318341982075424768 2020-10-20 08:03:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @forestminish @GifZelda WALUIGI. I mean thicc zelda is nice but WALUIGI WITH HIS OWN RHYTHM PLATFORMER
1318341615468019713 2020-10-20 08:01:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm It is funny tho
1318335567034257408 2020-10-20 07:37:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @junpeip3bigcock @brandon_doi Indeed I did. You have a good day.
1318334249246822401 2020-10-20 07:32:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Ok now THIS is fantastic! I'd take another flu shot if she's giving them.
1318328451707904001 2020-10-20 07:09:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jimmcnary @EpochTimes No, actually.
1318327367677452293 2020-10-20 07:05:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jazz_inmypants Ohhh I get it. Still a win. I'd take incest over loneliness for life.
1318318590177705984 2020-10-20 06:30:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MinaCreamu I can't afford this right now, but I'll spread the word. Your art is great!
1318318210530291712 2020-10-20 06:28:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @junpeip3bigcock @brandon_doi Gracias
1318318024911474692 2020-10-20 06:28:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kwebbelkop Batman, because he has moral depth to him that most others don't. I do like Zatanna and Booster gold, simply because one is extremely unique and creative, and the other is a freaking philanderer who learns the value of trust, loyalty, and fighting for what you believe in.
1318295466317053952 2020-10-20 04:58:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PerfectLegend @Gregster1998 Jack. The samurai trapped in the future is one od my favorite characters and is in a show that WAS my childhood.
1318294127214284809 2020-10-20 04:53:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @moosemery @alexisisawitch @SolEternal1 @ReJolted The mainstream media and cdc is also lying. Odd. But hey that's fine.  What's nore important is being able to provide for myself and my family
1318292663842557962 2020-10-20 04:47:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt I don't get it.  Oh well. Soldier on gurl!

1318274509959462914 2020-10-20 03:35:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Things will get better. You just have to try.  I believe in you. You will miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
1318274136381247489 2020-10-20 03:33:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JoshAndHisJokes @SavedYouAClickV Because kotaku is trash
1318273279690493953 2020-10-20 03:30:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Squidmedaddy @Hideki_Naganuma K. It's hard to joke around these days
1318272697189732352 2020-10-20 03:27:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Follow backs don't mean anything. It's just like sub for sub. If I subscribe to a magazine service and don't read it, why would I pay for that subscription
1318272349179990017 2020-10-20 03:26:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JerryisANerd @somethinghe I chose all of it.
1318271472738181121 2020-10-20 03:23:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Squidmedaddy @Hideki_Naganuma No.
1318270436598292483 2020-10-20 03:18:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Squidmedaddy @Hideki_Naganuma If you and your partner want that, and can decide on a way to devide attention and trust and responsibility equally, more power to you. But know that if she spends more time with another and you get jealous, then that  is your fault.
1318268629344002049 2020-10-20 03:11:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @lilronin46 @Hideki_Naganuma I wish I could
1318268575908548608 2020-10-20 03:11:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Squidmedaddy @Hideki_Naganuma But that's cheating
1318268471281618944 2020-10-20 03:11:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @brandon_doi Whomst is this
1318268195703300097 2020-10-20 03:10:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @moosemery @alexisisawitch @SolEternal1 @ReJolted Cool. I don't care. Pigs flying doesn't matter.
1318267920439541763 2020-10-20 03:08:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @einei_ike Lesbians hate men by nature and are extremely selfish.
1318265306578624517 2020-10-20 02:58:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SethEverman No. I don't know who you are, but I probably won't. Have a good Birthday.
1318264775227396096 2020-10-20 02:56:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MotherFoxxer Not answering this in a comment. Please DM me.
1318263486795927552 2020-10-20 02:51:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LordLiteskin Cool. If you want to talk about this more with me, I am open to DMs or anything else. The last thing I want to do is flood Tommy's mentions with this BLM stuff. Have a good day.
1318262718579810307 2020-10-20 02:48:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Yes, it happens. That is bad. But not so often to where black people need to live in fear of being killed by cops. I respect you as an artist, Tommy. So I won't talk about this anymore if you wish. But I'm no more racist than you, or anyone else who wants justice for brutality.
1318261645341282304 2020-10-20 02:44:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LordLiteskin @tommietomm If it matters less, then that isn't equality. It isn't a technicality. Saying, "...but some people's lives matter a little less than Caucasian people..." is a racist statement. There are racist acts in every country, and it is horrible. Being racist won't solve these problems.
1318260948529041410 2020-10-20 02:41:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Ok, your statement contradicts itself, first of all. You are fighting for equality. You say that all lives matter is not a statement of equality. ??? The word "all" in this statement encompasses everyone. How much more equal can you get?
1318259443319132160 2020-10-20 02:35:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Same.
1318259131107708928 2020-10-20 02:34:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WhyIsTheKaito Good. Corporations thrive off of capitalism, individualism, and competition. BLM thrives off of group ideology, a failed experiment of an economic notion, and a bunch of people who are too childish to understand that the real world is not going to hold your hand.
1318258146641575936 2020-10-20 02:30:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm It's not funny. It's true. All lives, including those of black people, matter. I really don't see the point in bashing the truth? I mean it's understood that "all lives" includes black people. If you have an issue with that statement, you are the problem. Sorry Tommy.
1318257694650884096 2020-10-20 02:28:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Bilyola @tommietomm Probably common sense. Marxism is awful and has resulted in millions of deaths due to it being super easy to take advantage of people. It will never work because there is no way people will collectively do only what they "need". Human nature goes against Marxist ideology.
1318244002639060993 2020-10-20 01:33:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeteGre25535642 @tiraDom78 @petsit16 @thebradfordfile Yup. My life sucks.  But I have hope that with enough effort and good will from those around me and above me, that I have every opportunity to make my life better.

1318239701594198016 2020-10-20 01:16:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe Same. The World is weird and the people are weirder.

1318217605384122369 2020-10-19 23:49:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 They don't. If they do, they are fools. FE is my favorite video game franchise, but even then I still think that mario, zelda, amd pokemon have had more of an impact on gaming.  Same with dragon quest, which has 1 rep. There's nothing we can do about the characters in the roster.

1318042021387505671 2020-10-19 12:11:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MythrilMagician @OnTheDownLoTho Ok but why does it matter
1318036745951248384 2020-10-19 11:50:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Suzaku is a POS and deserves the ded penalty.

1318035472183140352 2020-10-19 11:45:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rickles955 Could you please send me proof of this debunking? I'd like to see it for myself. Thank you.
1318031211562872832 2020-10-19 11:28:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @shelllllbeeee What constitutional rights were infringed on? Specifically with the pandemic, because I want to be knowledgeable.
1318001106753097730 2020-10-19 09:28:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @_ThomasGWhite_ I'm following you because  yuske is awesome and you are smart.

1317986897864609792 2020-10-19 08:32:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gyochuwaifu I took apart a surgical disposable mask and saw that the only layer of concrete protection was a reinforced cotton cloth. I'm sorry, this is supposed to save me from a biological weapon? I wish we had a cure already.
1317986252466081792 2020-10-19 08:29:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe It's fine. XD
1317985652089212930 2020-10-19 08:27:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe I must warn you, however. A lot of my retweets will be art, anime tatas, or political things.  I would prefer that we do not talk about politics, because apparently that makes people mad at eachother. But you like Silque so you are a person of culture. See ya round!
1317985010809524224 2020-10-19 08:24:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gyochuwaifu Could you please explain this? It's confusing. I work shifts that require me to wear one, and there was one shift where I wore 2. After 30 minutes of wearing the 2 masks, I was breathing hevily and I had to take both off. But they're harmless... right?
1317983525581238272 2020-10-19 08:18:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe Oh my god it actually worked. Ok, so, to clarify a few things: I do suffer from depression. I always joke about how it would be easy to make friends like back in first grade or earlier where you found one common interest and went for it. And yes, I will still be a friend.
1317981967648948224 2020-10-19 08:12:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Wait why did I comment this here?  I'm so sorry, this was meant for a different tweet and somehow yours was loaded instead.  I apologize.
1317981291929808896 2020-10-19 08:10:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @somethinghe Me too!  Hey, since we have this in common, may we be friends?
1317980720481140737 2020-10-19 08:07:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blaklamb @chuckwoolery I don't get it. If biden is on the left side of this chart, then why does he have the highed percentage if the people are on Trump's side?

1317975643871715330 2020-10-19 07:47:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jadesnap The worst one? That's tough. My brain says Subaki, my heart says Camilla, and my peepee says peri.

1317940277609451527 2020-10-19 05:27:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Hey. I don't like Trump either, but what has he done to bring suffering to the country? I'm not trying to be mean here, I just want to know where you're coming from.

1317937476917465097 2020-10-19 05:15:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Cultured. You are very cultured.

1317823575315927042 2020-10-18 21:43:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @man_cave_logic I thought this was an original price gauge, without any demand. I thought it was pricing trump shirts higher intentionally to get people to buy the biden shirts. I know that is what supply and demand is, but... I'm having a hard time explaining my misunderstanding.
1317822870001750018 2020-10-18 21:40:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GodBlessUSofA @ccpvirus20201 @Phreadys I get supply and demand. But... oh. Ok I thought these prices were originally set higher for trump on purpose to keep people from buying it. Well I'm a dumbo. Sorry

1317647523738169345 2020-10-18 10:03:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @qtalien1 @walmartbagg Why do these idiots think it is hypocritical,  when plagerism is literally theft of another's work without permission?
1317647243286138882 2020-10-18 10:02:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Niniwanwan1 @walmartbagg Damn right.
1317646211835482112 2020-10-18 09:58:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @no1worries1 @videojames_ Then how will people communicate if things need to progress, or change course? It is a living action, sexual intercourse. And to not be able to communicate effectively will lead to a loss of love or a loss of purpose.
1317644962188693504 2020-10-18 09:53:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @parvxneh @QueerHeadass @videojames_ Huh? Why is that bad?  Would "the lady" be better? Or "the little girl"? I see nothing wrong with refering to a woman as a woman.
1317644417361207296 2020-10-18 09:51:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @videojames_ You got me. Followed
1317642946422898689 2020-10-18 09:45:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @notvrime @Winterwolf181 They can change naturally. However, when you change a word's meaning on purpose to suit your agenda, that is manipulation of the deepest sort and is horrendous.
1317638206033219585 2020-10-18 09:26:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @notvrime @Winterwolf181 Gay-haters? Prejudiced? People who hate gays? There are tons of ways to phrase it without controling the terms used for decades to describe forms of mental illness.  And as for entitlement, I'm not entitled. I just know more and am using common sense amd deductive reasoning.
1317637726485778437 2020-10-18 09:24:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily Cool! Thank you for answering.

1317636003545440262 2020-10-18 09:17:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily @Gregster1998 I wanted to be sure because: A) I can imagine her and Naesala eating strawberries together B) Do you have plans of drawing the other herons in the future, or have you already done so?  Just curious.
1317635222599536640 2020-10-18 09:14:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @poochy_lily @Gregster1998 This is very well drawn! Is that Leanne?
1317634929627402241 2020-10-18 09:13:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ccpvirus20201 @Phreadys That isn't a poll. That is price discrimination... or price gauging... I can't remember what that is.  But it is illegal and wrong to coerce people into buying the "correct" shirt through unfair pricing. Manipulative crap like this makes my blood boil.
1317634045270986753 2020-10-18 09:10:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nolendo64 Shitty people can be correct.
1317633412488925185 2020-10-18 09:07:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Noon_time0 @xxxtactician1 Eh. No one really cares. But thanks
1317633126315819010 2020-10-18 09:06:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LuminaryHikari I was going off of other sites and other released salaries that idiots like to dox themselves.  I was assuming that authors who write for this website receive similar salaries. I was wrong, and I apologize for rushing to conclusions.
1317632435601969154 2020-10-18 09:03:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WillYomiko @Ppadzilla1 @JMG_PartyBean I get where the food comes from, but where does the 0na^0le come from?  And yes, I am nervous to type that word.
1317631537500835840 2020-10-18 09:00:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xxxtactician1 But that's just how I see it. Sorry for raining on your parade.
1317631414670557184 2020-10-18 08:59:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xxxtactician1 @rexmon01 Yeah well it doesn't make sense, because irony and jokes are not the same thing. Context sure, but it's rediculous because it confuses actual irony.
1317616649743306753 2020-10-18 08:01:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ArcherBias @SYG64 FastAsFuck I mean it's the only thing he has to forge, honestly.

1317602629774606340 2020-10-18 07:05:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Cool! (If I had a dollar for every time someone mentioned the graveyard shift episode for this film I'd still be poor) It's actually free to watch on Youtube, so if you have a couple of hours to spare, you can give it a go!
1317597412333072384 2020-10-18 06:44:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @toonstop @Hideki_Naganuma Haven't found mine yet because I am inadequate and women only care for the 666 rule. A man with values and  caring soul means nothing....  "Come and tear out my soul, witch. I welcome you, as it will be my only embrace with meaning!"
1317596364327538689 2020-10-18 06:40:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @erinforpres It's sad, and people with compromised immune systems fall into this category too. But I'll bet you if many of your family members got the flu or Sars-Cov1, the same thing would happen. The problem is medical facilities block proper treatment for money.
1317595368360714243 2020-10-18 06:36:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PretentiousPoof @TheHinduDindu Here's the thing. They do mayter, like everyone else in the world. But now it is terrible to say everyone matters equally? The organization is just as bad and equality is ripe for misery if taken to the extreme.
1317594301627584519 2020-10-18 06:32:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @animosley @ConquerAnger The funny thing is, race/skin color isn't even an important factor whem catagorizing people. Beliefs, intellegence, skills, ability, compassion levels, and income are all more important than skin color

1317591599401095169 2020-10-18 06:21:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Okkefak Ok, I just skimmed the post below the image. Yeah, he's a freaking ass. Hypocrisy.  I will block him and spread the word.  However, my point still stands. CP is illegal, but drawings should not be referred to as such unless they depict or involve actual real life children.
1317590172230426630 2020-10-18 06:15:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Tanookicatoon @CJemerald101 The problem is people don't know that "white people" aren't really white. Mixtures of several kinds of light toned colors like pink, beige, satton, ect. It's a general thing to avoid longer conversations with national origins. Just like with "black" and "brown".
1317589307406864384 2020-10-18 06:12:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Okkefak Ages?  I'm sorry, what else has he done that is reprehensible?  If there's other stuff that he has done I would like to see it and make a more informed decision. Right now I can only go off of the loose "childpregnation" that you have posted here. I know nothing about this dude.
1317588695558557696 2020-10-18 06:09:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Okkefak Art is art. She isn't a real child, and unless this is some kind of hypocrisy that was spouted by Traveler before, I don't really give a damn. Flayn isn't real, and while it may be vile, as long as no real children get hurt, there's no harm done. Fight real pedophilia. Good day.

Honestly any female character can be a waifu as long as someone loves/likes the character enough. Catria has been my "waifu" since 2014, amd that was 3 years before heroes released.

1317300767620038657 2020-10-17 11:05:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Mine is Nosferatu. The 1922 silent film.  I like that it can be both suspenseful and light hearted due to how times have changed. It's still a great film by today's standards. You can even get a majority of the story without the dialogue, and visual storytelling just... slaps.

1317294381238464512 2020-10-17 10:40:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ebinkuu This is amazing!  Lara gives me life, but every other character here is pristinely detailed! Very well done!
1317293886037962757 2020-10-17 10:38:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Drewsef3 @Karbuitt Nah. It's just natural water, bro
1317293306095767552 2020-10-17 10:36:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GMA1776 I hope this is real
1317291383716302849 2020-10-17 10:28:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fruitgamer02 Very well done, and far too wholesome for my tear-filled eyes to handle! &lt;3
1317264980144754688 2020-10-17 08:43:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Edlegard.  I mean... her boss quote against Dimitri made me quit the game for a week.  Crimson flower is very rushed, too.
1317264380313165824 2020-10-17 08:41:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rexmon01 @ChainOfLinks571 It's the best because it has Garret, Igrene, and the meme 100% hitrate miss
1317263751830274048 2020-10-17 08:38:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @maou_fuu Lovely!    (^_^)
1317262389662916610 2020-10-17 08:33:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HAVOKBLANCO @dariusthedonn @AllHailNaj_ XD
1317262148511346689 2020-10-17 08:32:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @wildtommie @tommietomm Fantastic!
1317261930168504322 2020-10-17 08:31:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HAVOKBLANCO @dariusthedonn @AllHailNaj_ Been out of style since august
1317261568749559810 2020-10-17 08:30:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SolEternal1 S-someone who gets it!?  But for real I don't want to spend the rest of my life isolated and alone. I'd rather get this stupid virus and get it over with.
1317261211176701952 2020-10-17 08:28:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @argray7 Don't you know that a pandemic isn't an excuse to live your life?
1317260785165500416 2020-10-17 08:26:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SpiffyDC @SYG64 Wait are her legs bent at the knees or is it some sort of vampire sorcery? Because my eyes tell me they're not there.
1317260131223150593 2020-10-17 08:24:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PaviseFE Someone willing to say "no".
1317256941698154496 2020-10-17 08:11:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @danielsmain @Tortokhod Same
1317251910982864904 2020-10-17 07:51:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 I hated my online classes too. I needed a physical teacher so I could ask questions. For my brain to absorb knowledge, I need to understand the subject material. And emails with unspecified wait times per response can be nerve wracking if you already don't do well socially.
1317249727612805122 2020-10-17 07:43:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 *must resist...urge to... unfollow..!*
1317234294222442496 2020-10-17 06:41:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Me!  Uh, I think
1317234006350495746 2020-10-17 06:40:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @magisbac @Nico_mancer @DCWarriors_ @PrimeVideo Ok I think I know what you are. Good luck in real life.
1317233758928539649 2020-10-17 06:39:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jeannin55385803 @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse Eh. I'd rather not
1317216127513133056 2020-10-17 05:29:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @magisbac @Nico_mancer @DCWarriors_ @PrimeVideo Did you know that if you use a word repeatedly without coherent thought, it begins to lose meaning?  Bigot is now a buzzword that shows you hate whoever you can't agree with. It's just like "lmfao". Please take care.
1317214909084717057 2020-10-17 05:24:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @magisbac @Nico_mancer @DCWarriors_ @PrimeVideo Unwavering. Sorry, stupid phone keypad.
1317214184510312450 2020-10-17 05:21:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jeannin55385803 @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse No.  It can happen. Anyone can get the virus. I'm saying you have the same chance as people who religiously wear masks. There's no difference in viral transmission.
1317213858860322816 2020-10-17 05:20:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Godparticle77 Hey man. I don't know you, but I want to say thank you. In a world full of crazies it is important to have sane people.
1317213292306288654 2020-10-17 05:18:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LEEEDELEEDELEE @ReedCoffman202 @PrimeVideo Because intersex is a biological deformity. You don't need to talk about it. It's between your close relatives and friends if the matter involves you.
1317212926684680193 2020-10-17 05:16:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nico_mancer @DCWarriors_ @magisbac @PrimeVideo So being unwaverin gbn in an opinionated mindset is bad? Hm.  Interesting...
1317211896270016514 2020-10-17 05:12:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AllDayAnimee Yes
1317211766951235584 2020-10-17 05:12:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jeannin55385803 @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse Science says otherwise, bud.
1317211155807469572 2020-10-17 05:09:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PamSimson @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse Yep. What if a bubble (aresol and salivation) carried it? Well, what happens whenbthe bubble pops when it hits the chain link fence?
1317210885115564038 2020-10-17 05:08:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jpolus @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse But what if my nose itches
1317210314052599808 2020-10-17 05:06:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jeannin55385803 @EpochTimes @ChrisChristie @WhiteHouse According to the CDC, roughly 85% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are attributed to people who always or regularly wear masks.
1317210045227171841 2020-10-17 05:05:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TropicalMaku Yuffie is better than Tifa.
1317209716381147136 2020-10-17 05:04:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Grca1337 Then you are part of the problem.
1317209092721692673 2020-10-17 05:01:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrangeKyle91 Congratulations!
1317208879793643522 2020-10-17 05:00:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Red because I want to marry someone real.
1317184795567423491 2020-10-17 03:25:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Oh?
1317163914526863363 2020-10-17 02:02:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Winterwolf181 Uhh no it doesn't. Phobia means extreme or irrational fear. Not hate. It has never ever meant hatred, and you are clinging to a lie just because people use it incorrectly, constantly. It is purposely deceptive.  I hope you do some light research on your own, and have a good day.
1317163100244684806 2020-10-17 01:58:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Winterwolf181 "Homophobic". Fear of humans. Well, there already exists a term for it - anthrophobia.  So I guess you used a word that means little to nothing.  Sorry for the misunderstanding.
1317162267604094982 2020-10-17 01:55:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Winterwolf181 I saw it. Yeah that's not nice.  So... explain to me how mangs is "afraid of humans".
1317161695375167489 2020-10-17 01:53:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DarkAdvent01 Uh... no.  Saias is cool. But Ced is better in every single way.
1317161383633559554 2020-10-17 01:52:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc *her
1317161322056908803 2020-10-17 01:51:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kabrikitty Somewhat true, but I don't like either of these two.
1317161200707403787 2020-10-17 01:51:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime @kabrikitty *biased
1317160432780644352 2020-10-17 01:48:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Winterwolf181 Yeah.... no. You're botching the meaning on that. I hate mangs, I think he's a peice of garbage. If he hates gays, then sure, whatever. But you need to understand basic psychology before throwing twisted words you see online around.
1317159349891047425 2020-10-17 01:43:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Oof
1316978361802121216 2020-10-16 13:44:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChainOfLinks571 Ew...
1316977872943390720 2020-10-16 13:42:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Cosmicfab @ChainOfLinks571 Good for you. Wait, this doesn't make any sense. If it takes only a single set of artwork of a character to make you realize you might be gay, then you're either feeling something else, going through a phase, or not gay.  If I am wrong, please let me know.
1316976146072932352 2020-10-16 13:35:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OGmaneater I really don't want to be in this thread, but I just have to say this. If you want to make your own fan art or fanfiction of imaginary ships ans stuff that isn't cannon, that's fine. But don't act like it is fact or the best thing since sliced bread.  Have a good day.
1316975022280409089 2020-10-16 13:31:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Thanks
1316973559298785281 2020-10-16 13:25:39 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Hilda, hands down. Or, no hands. Get it?
1316972912109379584 2020-10-16 13:23:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SYG64 @Winterwolf181 I mean.... while he's a piece of shit, he's actually not wrong.
1316972734790930432 2020-10-16 13:22:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Winterwolf181 He's only confirmed to be 3 of those.  Yeah, he's a shitty person, but don't stretch the truth just because the person is terrible.
1316972388907651073 2020-10-16 13:21:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc the hell? Oh, it's fine. I just want to know what that is
1316629857967788034 2020-10-15 14:39:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @dat_jayden @TwistedRabbits Well... It may be too late
1316629724794441728 2020-10-15 14:39:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @twinkbackup @TwistedRabbits She is, actually! Wish they did more with this character design
1316629514236067840 2020-10-15 14:38:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @420_fazeit People gotta ruin everything.
1316628952354557952 2020-10-15 14:36:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GhostyWeirdo @Nnemdilim @TwistedRabbits Because internet morons need to have some kind of "representation" to feel better. Make your own damn character if you gotta ruin existing ones.
1316627955473416193 2020-10-15 14:32:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OrmilleF Something scary. ie., not Lyn. (Don't block me pls it's a joke)  Ok maybe a werewolf? I don't see too many of those Lycan fellas.
1316625905809338368 2020-10-15 14:24:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Distant_Phantom @Lost_Pause_ Well, to be fair, communism is more of an economic affair and not many are expertly knowledgeable in both economics AND anime.
1316625127359078400 2020-10-15 14:21:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Raven62182005 @tommietomm Uhhh... I wouldn't go that far with the marriage/support mechanic.  However, being h0rny is understandable when the lady (or guy whatever you're into) is drawn impeccably well.
1316624664911917056 2020-10-15 14:19:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm This is incredible!!  She's perfect!  May I use this as my phone walpaper?  I will be sure to credit you if I get cought by my boss or my family.
1316624269347094528 2020-10-15 14:17:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UltimaShadowX Maybe they want to? Who knows, maybe there's not enough of an incentive for these folks to play as demons or orcs or whatever.  Freedom of choice means you do pretty much whatever. No skin off my nose, and I dunno why it's off yours. Hope you have a good day/night.
1316623485041618945 2020-10-15 14:14:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ I don't know what's going on, but yeah. If one is mean to you, you may not be 100% correct by being that way back, but if people have a complete issue with you doing  it only and not the others then that's quite petty.
1316227837695844352 2020-10-14 12:02:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @skchkko I don't know what it is. But Yes!! ^_^
1316226865925890048 2020-10-14 11:58:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SwiftBuizel @DarkAdvent01 I don't get it
1316226491630354432 2020-10-14 11:57:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @keevendood @Plun_Yu Of course. Disease is inevitable if you have a poor immune system.
1316226077979631616 2020-10-14 11:55:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JasonIsMissing Kakyoin is my spirit animal
1316225176946782209 2020-10-14 11:51:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @sky_jack01 That's a good point.
1316222955051941889 2020-10-14 11:43:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZipperQR I mean... it looks like all she added was red wine, octopus, and one of those flaming hot doritos.
1316221675617366018 2020-10-14 11:37:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Ah, ok. Amd I'm sorry if I annoy you with any advice I give, or try to. I genuinely want to help.
1316221092353183744 2020-10-14 11:35:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Overstessed probably. Sometimes when I get angry, those feelings come up, but my rage is mostly centered around what frustrates me at the moment. Like my nose when it runs. But yeah hatred for all things living is a sign you need to see someone. Mental health is no joke
1316170066338213888 2020-10-14 08:12:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc I question things like that too. Nightly is a problem, and you need to resolve that. Do your own research and reach your own conclusions.  If you need outside opinions to help,  that is fine too. But dwelling on things you cannot change is never going to help.
1316168590018654208 2020-10-14 08:06:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Trust, like respect, is earned. But you can't treat everyone like they cannot be trusted. Hell, you have to give some level of trust to your employer if he/she is to pay you for your work. The fact you don't trust people is evidence that you need to start.
1316166432921714688 2020-10-14 07:58:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Maveryck151 @MarcelByrd3 @Lost_Pause_ Two dimensional, 3rd wall.
1316166021804429312 2020-10-14 07:56:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lowceeblow @Lost_Pause_ This is wrong. Fiction has a small yet negligible effect on your perspective of reality. Anything fictitious has 0 rights.  Use that noggin of yours.
1316165005805527040 2020-10-14 07:52:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LilyMJL That is what makes them horrible people.
1316164344057602049 2020-10-14 07:50:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Life is difficult. But through perseverance, hard work, trust in friends, family, common sense, and a little bit of patience, the world can be as cold or warm as you wish. Moping about life being unfair will not change it, nomatter how many catrias love you.
1316163468958068739 2020-10-14 07:46:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ARadcliff_5 @Nux_Taku @elonmusk Only one if those are true. Everyone knows urine is stored in the testis
1316162040315219968 2020-10-14 07:40:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ I'd take like... several other FE gals before palla, and several real life women who can work with me toward a shared happiness with bounds of success. But Palla is cool too, I guess.
1316161395562631168 2020-10-14 07:38:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bijuu484 Doing that is a sure way to ruin humanity. Nothing you experience will be real. Nothing you love will be real. You will be living a false hapiness that will tempt you and future generations into slavery of the digital mind. And we will not have humans. We will only have puppets.
1316160812885708800 2020-10-14 07:36:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JohnCaden64 I had no clue.  Well, good luck!
1316159752607539203 2020-10-14 07:31:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PastelleAutumn @saammyylicious @GiggukAZ And?  That doesn't change anything   I think. I really don't care that much tbh
1316159345550389248 2020-10-14 07:30:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @aytrixii Neon green and pink.  It doesn't matter.
1315833638152527872 2020-10-13 09:56:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm They both look fantastic!  Great improvements all around
1315820195391385600 2020-10-13 09:02:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime I don't care about subs. Can we please end this conversation?
1315818807366242310 2020-10-13 08:57:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime Whatever.
1315817884782940162 2020-10-13 08:53:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime Can you tell how *determined I am to win our little debate?  Anyway, it doesn't matter because sub runs are boring
1315816799699640320 2020-10-13 08:49:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @stefan_johnsen @Skatrgurrl @jimsciutto @brianstelter It's a republic
1315815262680121344 2020-10-13 08:42:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime Tristan is on a horse. *mic drop*
1315814918986268672 2020-10-13 08:41:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @miss_el574 @beckbrian7 @occamsrazor45 As they should. Being gay doesn't matter worth crap when it comes to how you plan to implement policies and serve the american people.
1315814139978186758 2020-10-13 08:38:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime Look dude. I don't give a damn about fucking hawke. I don't give a damn about daisy. I don't care AT ALL for optimal play if it means limiting my fucking choices. So do yourself a favor and do something productive instead of bitching at me for being wrong about optimal play.
1315811096532594696 2020-10-13 08:26:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonieTime Hawke doesn't care about stolen gold. Gen 2 isn't so hard that you need that much, especially in a sub run. Check mate, loser.
1315809659744382976 2020-10-13 08:20:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Son_Gohan_69 Imma do it now
1315808893549907968 2020-10-13 08:17:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mildmild1311 Beautiful!

1315806769403363334 2020-10-13 08:09:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Holly_Girl_Rcks Jeanne. Because Daisy is, factually, the most useless sub in the game
1315805951648292864 2020-10-13 08:06:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @wlwilluz Society if you want to be a cure for the greater depression you have to spell out the supports of your child units in the ground
1315795772017913857 2020-10-13 07:25:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MonMusuFluff Yeah.  Although, I do get why Yoshi hates water in sunshine.  Isle Delphino has a water tax.
1315791939854372865 2020-10-13 07:10:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @rycalochka It's an upgrade.  Thanks for coming to my ted talk

1315790781479882754 2020-10-13 07:05:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ArcherBias @BossSubway The hell is Dioga?
1315756071001174017 2020-10-13 04:47:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @byBeli_02 Because the amount of dedication to something silly shows 1 of two things:  You enjoy little jokes and want to make others laugh. Or You have too much time on your hands like most of us and it's relatable.

1315749733932118018 2020-10-13 04:22:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nux_Taku Define true equality. On what grounds, and how do you measure what is equal?

1315615947198259201 2020-10-12 19:30:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nexx_Mowarek I read somewhere that due to how viruses are seasonal, it is a similar reason for why viruses don't care about distance. But I'm too tired to talk about this stuff. I'm calling it a night. Bye and don't let the capitalist bedbugs bite
1315615353226100738 2020-10-12 19:28:37 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zoelovescake @Nega_3000 No mask can stop all aerosols, this has been tested and proven scientifically with n95 masks. The virus in question was influenza, which is, on average, 15 micons larger than covid 19. If a large virus cannot be stopped with a mask, how can a smaller one be?
1315599286348939264 2020-10-12 18:24:47 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @n8crafter Like Hydroxychloroquine and zinc.  Yeah, that one is out there with no significant side effects. A vaccine will take years to develop. And even then, the virus will be around forever. But hey. Socialism means that everyone has to get the vaccine for free.
1315598625133780992 2020-10-12 18:22:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zoelovescake @Nega_3000 Doesn't matter. The virus is smaller than all the aresol particles.

1315588412208902144 2020-10-12 17:41:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Give in to communism. That's how you win.
1315588046390132736 2020-10-12 17:40:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @digitalhats @n8crafter @kirbysuberstar Well I mean... If I want to actually date someone, or be with friends and have interactions that I can see, how long do I have to wait for it to be sanitary and safe? I'm not waiting another year.
1315585910029901825 2020-10-12 17:31:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ABS4UAE @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump Ok but real socialism when
1315585668719013891 2020-10-12 17:30:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UncleMarcHoee @kirbysuberstar Ok but could you throw some feet, too? The mask does a lot, but hands ain't one.  Wish they covered the eyes tho
1315585244096073728 2020-10-12 17:28:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @jamestk789 @SaraCarterDC Obama was the best! He brought us closer to working socialism with obamacare. Too bad people didn't control it.
1315584886032474113 2020-10-12 17:27:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SethWeiss7 @SaraCarterDC Ok but socialism is close with... I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
1315584433173467136 2020-10-12 17:25:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ZGUnlimited You used a period after "no". That means you're mean to use punctuation.  Apparently.  I hate people sometimes.
1315583998115143681 2020-10-12 17:24:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zoelovescake @kirbysuberstar People hate him?  Why do they hate him? Isn't hatred a cause of contempt in the motherland?
1315583709962211328 2020-10-12 17:22:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @n8crafter @kirbysuberstar You got a point. But I don't understand. How long do we need to wear them, then?  It's been forever since I've been out with friends. Others have been stuck at home.
1315580600301039616 2020-10-12 17:10:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheEpicDept Nah. He should have wished for the return of communism.  That shit is due for a re-run.

1315579689889607681 2020-10-12 17:06:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zoelovescake @kirbysuberstar How do we know he is not lying for money, power, or any other corrupt purpose?
1315579006448807937 2020-10-12 17:04:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nega_3000 Finally, once it is back into your own respitory system, or out in the open, it is up to the virus to leap through the moisture in the air and find a host. Minimum infective doseage is not high, so you don't need more than a few virus particles to touch your eyes or breath in.
1315578505808302080 2020-10-12 17:02:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nega_3000 When the virons and contagions are out in the open, do they sit there?  No. Any force created by breathing in or out will force the virus to move. Eventually it will latch on to an aresol particle and pass through. (It is proven that masks do not stop all aerosols). [Cont]
1315577947483443200 2020-10-12 16:59:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nega_3000 When a force is in motion, it has to be stopped. Droplets, right? Well, dropplets and aerosols are comprised of water molecules. Those evaporate over time, letting the virons latch onto aresols in the air that get past the tiny threads. (Cont)
1315577337044504576 2020-10-12 16:57:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cathars4fun Then why do people still get the flu and die from it?
1315577051114541057 2020-10-12 16:56:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @n8crafter @kirbysuberstar You are restricting movement and gatherings. First ammendment.  https://t.co/ODkP3Q742h
1315576320773050368 2020-10-12 16:53:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BreezyGuitar Well, it is sad that you have lost coworkers, friends, and potential family members. But that is not my responsibility.
1315576086802112512 2020-10-12 16:52:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zoelovescake @kirbysuberstar Show me the scientists who said they do work to impede viral transmission. I am curious to see these randomized control trials.
1315575728084332544 2020-10-12 16:51:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nexx_Mowarek @kirbysuberstar Well, what happens to those respritory dropplets over time? Cought by a mask or not, what happens to them? Hint: Saliva and aerosols contain water molecules.
1315557502029893632 2020-10-12 15:38:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @saammyylicious @GiggukAZ Loli, because traps are deceit and lies.
1315557001146126336 2020-10-12 15:36:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @zimeimeizi @Bud_Doggin @gaddzook I like the enthusiasm, but uh... I think Lincoln, Polk, Roosevelt, and Regan were probably better.
1315555798970441728 2020-10-12 15:31:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Vex_Core @kirbysuberstar I have done my research. Straight from the cdc. Who also said that the virus apparently isn't airborne... after 7 months of studying this virus, you change the rules on that verdict only now?  Hm.  I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
1315555278360895489 2020-10-12 15:29:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cathars4fun Unfortunate. But he was right. Several studies show they are not needed in terms of viruses, especially influenza. Think about it. If it worked, then why haven't we been using them for flu seasons for the past 20 years?
1315554463269228544 2020-10-12 15:26:40 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @blurredashley @davidmweissman More like 140k but yeah you do that

1315551674862309376 2020-10-12 15:15:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @schnumms @rzhallman @722Stan @davidmweissman Like how he shut down international flights when there were only 5 confirmed cases in the US? Pretty fast reaction if you ask me.
1315551227925716992 2020-10-12 15:13:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cathars4fun No, they change them out every 20 minutes or so. Bacteriabuilld up starts being significant after 30 minutes. It's not healthy to breathe that shit back in, bro.
1315549505748717568 2020-10-12 15:06:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cathars4fun I'll make it, bud. Voting in person is the best way to avoid voter fraud. And I don't attend political rallies in the first place, so I don't really want to go to one now.  Oh, and have you thought about how wearing a mask for over 5 hours has an impact on your personal health?
1315548990536998912 2020-10-12 15:04:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nexx_Mowarek @kirbysuberstar Viruses don't care about distances or cotton fibers. Did you fail physics class, or are you just forgetting newton's third law?  And coughs and sneezes, while nice to not get from others, mostly has bearing on the speed at which a virus travels. The rest is cellular culture.
1315548257859317761 2020-10-12 15:02:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BreezyGuitar Something constitutional. My rights as a citizen are important because I am free to make my own decisions about how to save lives. I would be inclined to wear it if this whole thing wasn't based on lies, anyway.
1315547726541664256 2020-10-12 14:59:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UncleMarcHoee @kirbysuberstar Then you may as well give up life immediately.
1315547555279908866 2020-10-12 14:59:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Vex_Core @kirbysuberstar Not a good enough argument. Japan has been doing it so that means it works. Uhuh.  Did you have to wear one when we had the worst recorded flu season in the past 50 years back in 2018? You know... when more people died in america due to that than people dying of this virus now?
1315546428958224384 2020-10-12 14:54:44 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirbysuberstar Barely makes a difference.
1315512582124580866 2020-10-12 12:40:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UnLockii I don't because lots of idiots use and run it, but yeah it also has hilarious shit like this.  Plus I see really cool people like you! It's not all bad. :)
1315512083279216641 2020-10-12 12:38:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @cathars4fun Who cares about masks?  There are more important things in life than some silly virus.
1315510289878704128 2020-10-12 12:31:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kirbysuberstar Mask mandates are unconstitutional. And wearing a mask scientifically doesn't do jack. Virus culture and basic physics also would like a word with you.
1315508778356404224 2020-10-12 12:25:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Blukirbs216 Ew.  Yeah not into... that.  Good for them I guess? Maybe try with a wyvern instead of a peg?
1315508118302883841 2020-10-12 12:22:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LoliPropagandaB Interesting. Haven't had pocky in a long time...

1315506216324526080 2020-10-12 12:14:57 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc It is tough. It is difficult to deal with depression, especially if you don't have good insurance to afford medication or a psychiatrist.  I know it may seem dumb, but if you have the chance,  try cleaning your room.  Start from there, and think about what you accomplished.
1315505474129846274 2020-10-12 12:12:00 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm There are plenty of women with short hair who are amazing.  I love longer hair, I can't help it! &gt;_&lt;

In the end it doesn't matter too much. What matters is you put your heart into your work and don't go off the deep end like those Pit x palutena shippers.

1315147757770899456 2020-10-11 12:30:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KeithMontalbo I don't know how to feel about that one. But he should learn to be responsible and at least give credit.  Or not act like an asshole.
1315107665316663297 2020-10-11 09:51:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KeithMontalbo This needs context. What is this fella using the art for? If it is a simple profile or just sharing it with a friend, all that is needed is a simple source or citation to the artist. But if it is actually theft for money or mass reposting... uh hell no.
1315105897652400128 2020-10-11 09:44:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bijuu484 You mean the sluts with no shame.

1315101144285356032 2020-10-11 09:25:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MirageCXVI Prejudice against homosexuality and those who practice it exist. Yes. But "homophobia" would mean fear of humans, which already has a term. It's a false construction of language to control how people think. Phobia means irrational/extreme fear. Not hatred. Good day.
1315065649828450307 2020-10-11 07:04:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod Good day. And yes, I was being a little cunt. I admit my faults.
1315065401378734080 2020-10-11 07:03:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt That would be nice, but I don't see any Viridi x Floor Icecream.  It's odd. But you do what you like, I'll see what's in store.  ;)
1315064919436464128 2020-10-11 07:01:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod I'm not sure, actually.
1315064626082611205 2020-10-11 07:00:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod @meta_dash Doesn't matter. You act like it's a make it or break it deal. (Heh) In reality, the game is generous and well balanced around this aspect. You always have things to find and fills the need of discovery vs exploration. There is only so much you can do with rupees as rewards.
1315063989051760642 2020-10-11 06:57:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod @meta_dash Well you are. Quit whining
1315062772066115584 2020-10-11 06:52:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SokolovARTis @seanhannity That is a very clever use of the word witch.
1315061931485671424 2020-10-11 06:49:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Merryweatherey @aptx9522 Don't know who that is but she scares the hell out of me. Good job! I hope this never happens.
1315060654022242306 2020-10-11 06:44:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @undomesticanid Comedic for sure, but... wow I need actual people to socialize with or I start being depressed or have suicidal thoughts.  It ain't easy being queasy.
1315060139704094729 2020-10-11 06:42:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Robert? I guess? But hey unique names are cool. But you are cool despite your name.
1315059739286548481 2020-10-11 06:40:49 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @char93820720 Well lesbians are horrified of men anyways.
1315059359039324161 2020-10-11 06:39:18 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @MirageCXVI Well, your statement makes little sense too. While what this dude said is stupid beyond belief, it was not "homophobic" because that doesn't exist.
1315052413812903939 2020-10-11 06:11:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc It's fine, bro. I signed onto this site because I lost my old one.
1315051946739404800 2020-10-11 06:09:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc You have made that Abundantly clear.  But if you simp too hard you'll pass out before she notices.
1315049527129313283 2020-10-11 06:00:14 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @YumeOkamii Fun fact: If you care about being someone's crush, YOU need to improve and find meaning in your life. So kindly f^ck off
1315049044255879171 2020-10-11 05:58:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod @meta_dash Then you are a fool for not managing your supply. The game is very forgiving and you can find whatever you need with a little effort and ingenuity. Calling this bullshit is proof you can't think for yourself. It has some flaws, but none are so horrible to swear the system off.
1314799645747539973 2020-10-10 13:27:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Don't say that.
1314798045549264896 2020-10-10 13:20:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Bratzas @Ace_Archsage Of course an edelgard enthusiast would support blm. You are part of the problem you unthinking Marxist. Take a good damn look in the mirror and tell me you want the whole of society to suffer.
1314797707870035969 2020-10-10 13:19:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WeissBestgirl1 @Ace_Archsage And she is a hoe. Without any thinking skills. She is a dictator and is a terrible human being. If she hates crests so much, why does she use that hero's relic? HYPOCRITE BITHC
1314797441351323648 2020-10-10 13:18:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Elemiel @Ace_Archsage It would be terrible because Edleguard is terrible and deserves nothing short of a gruesome end.
1314797159561277443 2020-10-10 13:17:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Water_Scone12 Liar. You are a liar and a marxist totalitarian supporter. Edleguard is a problem and needs to be silenced. She deserved to get what was coming to her.  She uses childhood logic and acts like being a victim excuses starting a war against the wrong people. Fuck off
1314796639471783939 2020-10-10 13:15:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ace_Archsage Oh shut up. Edleguard is a dictator and a hypocrite with no logic or sense needed to rule justly. I'm glad the bitch got what was coming to her. I DARE you to back up why she is anywhere close to claude you liar.
1314795899302948864 2020-10-10 13:12:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UnkleMike2 @Katheri00900440 @covfefewarrior @catturd2 But it is a mandate and not a law. How is it unconstitutional?
1314795401485201408 2020-10-10 13:10:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean Ok. I getcha. At least I hope I do. You're smarter than all the fools on this bird, that's for sure. Have a good  day.
1314794845077204992 2020-10-10 13:08:13 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pistolgal @nypost Left *nor right.
1314793474353508352 2020-10-10 13:02:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Faucius Oh please
1314793131116761089 2020-10-10 13:01:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean Sorry I'm too tired to think logically.
1314793034844909568 2020-10-10 13:01:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean Then you just need to murder all men who persist after you tell them no once. Make it excusable by law until men learn that you can't hurt women. Oh wait. Savages won't care.
1314792031701610499 2020-10-10 12:57:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JayMo0326 @amuse @DailyCaller @KeithOlbermann They don't care about that.
1314791694370508802 2020-10-10 12:55:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean I was trying to prove a point by assuming all women enjoy false accusations. But hey if you aren't one of them that's one in a million. Fake numbers are fine to give, and it is a good temporary fix.
1314791012838055938 2020-10-10 12:52:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ChiefKeef Not unless you tell her she is useless
1314789555040550922 2020-10-10 12:47:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean How about self-defense? Pepper spray or concealed arms? If a man threatens to kill you, you defend yourself, get assistance or call authorities. Since everyone is now tought to believe women nomatter what, you can get away with everything.
1314788634655154177 2020-10-10 12:43:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Megandeth Still. Give me 90% of your money. You should have some, right? Job or no job?
1314787023010639872 2020-10-10 12:37:08 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tinadiane87 I mean it is the fault of terrible men that lesbians exist.
1314786639089106944 2020-10-10 12:35:36 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @bree_sargee97 @6lacKorean @mellyposaa @L0_rich Those aren't men. Those are savages.
1314786371479969792 2020-10-10 12:34:33 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @actuallyafairy @6lacKorean And that right there is the issue. Assuming it is all men leads to all men hating you.  I already don't appreciate the scandalous nature of women who can lie their way into a fake r^pe allegation, so why the hell should you deserve anything when you show no respect to any man?
1314785545537626112 2020-10-10 12:31:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @L0_rich When I read "how many bodies do you have" I thought that was like a death count.  Please tell me this guy is not a murderer.
1314780242276421634 2020-10-10 12:10:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @IAmMeBoi @RyanAFournier Huh.  That is very profound. I bet 60 dollars it wasn't from a teacher who has tought in the past 10 years.
1314779406674653184 2020-10-10 12:06:52 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Michell08172418 @RyanAFournier Ok how do we know it isn't photoshopped?
1314770856837603328 2020-10-10 11:32:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @KirbyMastah @meta_dash It's because you got over 500 korok seeds. You played it wrong
1314770628298276866 2020-10-10 11:31:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LiterallyGod @meta_dash You have Dew as a pfp. Fire emblem has weapon durability. How can you not handle it?
1314769253439074306 2020-10-10 11:26:31 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Thraciaa776 @OceanOfStars3 @meta_dash The castle is the best part tho
1314765840177418240 2020-10-10 11:12:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @burantsu Yup. Never played minecraft ever.  Didn't see the fun in it. Sorry.
1314757686387507200 2020-10-10 10:40:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gunntwitt @EpochTimes @SpeakerPelosi It's due to government control, not the virus itself.
1314754355950768128 2020-10-10 10:27:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Echo_StL @CriminalTweetss Ok there's being a lolicon, then there's this garbage. Wtf.
1314662425707282433 2020-10-10 04:22:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @YeetThatMeat Well... bugs and people doing stuff and then the natural circle of life, just with more bugs and eggs
1314660694625837058 2020-10-10 04:15:09 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @hriata02 @YeetThatMeat @nidhogg_hooded @NineIX_9 @Nux_Taku I didn't search for it, but I was browsing pixiv and... I think I found something just as bad. &gt;_&lt; gughlpth
1314660156874031106 2020-10-10 04:13:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Nani? FE 2?
1314406838218219521 2020-10-09 11:26:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @vorokii @Nux_Taku Honestly the drugs is the worst part
1314406573586907136 2020-10-09 11:25:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ShuraPrince Likely there for lols. The sweet wholesome stuff is better. Especially when the sweet wholesome is stuffed. If ya know what I mean. ;)
1314406256141053952 2020-10-09 11:24:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @RadioactiveRiv1 Wrong meme image bro
1314406062741741569 2020-10-09 11:23:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @celestricity Not as weird as what I did to my cousin's clothes  Ok that's a joke please don't flag me
1314405818834604033 2020-10-09 11:22:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @nidhogg_hooded @Nux_Taku There's an infestation tag? Um... is that like... centipedes and roaches in the uh... heart shaped boks?
1314396306849357825 2020-10-09 10:44:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala Hey, she'll be more popular in challenge runs. I guarantee it!
1314395876622770176 2020-10-09 10:42:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @burn_loot Sorry, but on what grounds is Michelle Obama not a woman?  I've been seeing this but I don't get it.
1314395512729149442 2020-10-09 10:41:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TerryTheBuneary Don't know what the november one is but I got that.
1314393555868299264 2020-10-09 10:33:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm Cool! You look nice, btw! Have a nice day/night
1314393288376553487 2020-10-09 10:32:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GarregM I think I'm fine. just gonna be a bit more hornie and less religious
1314393164946509825 2020-10-09 10:32:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 Beyo.  Not bad!
1314392828236247042 2020-10-09 10:30:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TaskLacka Me too!
1314367734449397760 2020-10-09 08:51:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @JackaryDraws This is really well done! Never knew I wanted Falltena until now!  Praise to you for drawing this and to @TailtiuIsAQueen
1314366419769982976 2020-10-09 08:45:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @StarTour_ Lovely!! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó‚úåÔ∏è
1314230368208326657 2020-10-08 23:45:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @spamuhell Wow. Someone is a party pooper.
1314229617490907139 2020-10-08 23:42:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GM_3826 @LeonMandala Didn't need to because it wasn't the source of all problems. Any hierarchy demands there be structure.  Just because there are a few in the nobility that are corrupt, doesn't mean nobility itself is the problem. Think about why we have a hierarchy in the first place.
1314228981948977160 2020-10-08 23:39:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @gayandsad3 @LeonMandala I see you don't understand the concept of dictatorships
1314228630592069632 2020-10-08 23:38:17 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LeonMandala And a better one
1314227730901274625 2020-10-08 23:34:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @britelitefuture @EpochTimes @GavinNewsom Voters learning is a rare sight.
1314226887095398401 2020-10-08 23:31:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Darkslifer27 @TheFallenStarLT @Nux_Taku ok. I will. It's unfortunate that people are dead, but only around half of those died from Covid or Covid related causes.  Death toll is inflated, and Some morons decided it would be cool to put covid patients into nursing homes where the elderly are at the highest risk.
1314225589331595269 2020-10-08 23:26:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Gregster1998 @stardream61016 I didn't know. Thanks for showing me
1314084350531702786 2020-10-08 14:04:58 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @NWOmustdie Erik, I agree with you. But just to repeat a talking point I've read, what about New Zealand having no new covid cases for 100 days and only 2 deaths?
1314082520053538816 2020-10-08 13:57:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @BHuggy_10 @Zillalady Boom. Basic physics and virus culture.  I like you, Brian. Have a good day.
1314081859903651841 2020-10-08 13:55:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EyestoSee9 @Zillalady @govkristinoem @ABC Actually distance won't stop a virus from spreading, peroid. As long as there's moisture in the air for virons to travel, they can reach hosts. It's the reason social distancing doesn't work and why viruses are seasonal.
1314081153150857217 2020-10-08 13:52:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @scarbsteve @mikefowkes4 @ShannonHoime @govkristinoem @ABC Except the death rate is inflate by at least 25%.  People have lied about the deaths.  Do some research.
1314080302197878785 2020-10-08 13:48:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheSMonroeShow Bottom out? I don't know what that means.
1314079924223913985 2020-10-08 13:47:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @makerviewr @TheSMonroeShow Yup. Din and Orielle come to mind for npcs being "waifus".
1314079552130482176 2020-10-08 13:45:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @pinkmathcat @TheSMonroeShow Telma as well.  And Din, amd Medli, and Midna, and Urbosa, and...
1314079098700996608 2020-10-08 13:44:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ebicentre @TheSMonroeShow Guess he forgot medli, Din, Oreille, Zelda, Paya, Midna, Marin, Nayru, Naboru, Urbosa, Sidon, Ruto, and Linkle exist.
1314077936597823488 2020-10-08 13:39:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @UltimaShadowX @Gregster1998 @TheSMonroeShow It has caused no one real trauma. Say you are exaggerating. Please.
1314077756901203968 2020-10-08 13:38:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @EpochTimes Yup. Vitamin D, Hydroxychloroquine, and Zinc.
1314077392177115136 2020-10-08 13:37:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Terrence_STR Pence won, and kamala had some points of interest. But I have to say. The fly kept things fun. I think it was Pence's hair product.
1314076569653182464 2020-10-08 13:34:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @justicein2020 @cadenbrackett Her name actually means "horrible" in Finnish.
1314075574596403202 2020-10-08 13:30:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @TheFallenStarLT @Nux_Taku Doomed of a virus that has a 99.86% survival rate on average. Hm. Doesn't seem like doom. Doom would be closer to 60 or 50%
1314062861921071105 2020-10-08 12:39:35 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Fiaherart Good luck to all!
1314060641448136704 2020-10-08 12:30:45 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @stardream61016 @Gregster1998 Mega man 5, because a house divided against itself cannot stand?
1314058951303012353 2020-10-08 12:24:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Karbuitt I would buy option B, but only if I get some floor ice cream with it as a bonus!  What? You said my point of view was Pit.
1314058486448369668 2020-10-08 12:22:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Goosaphone Oof. I hope you're doing well
1314057662758293505 2020-10-08 12:18:55 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Pallatena_ Sigurd, Python, and Catria.
1314057375071055874 2020-10-08 12:17:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @AvaWritesAlot I would say Faye too, but that's because I can't think of that much else.. ooh! Lyre crom FE 10, Macellan from 11/12, Boey, and Garret.
1314056792821960705 2020-10-08 12:15:28 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ValiGraumann @Nux_Taku Politics exists to display and impliment ideas to solve problems that need solving. But when people become corrupt, that bodes more problems than solutions.
1313889153067741185 2020-10-08 01:09:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mitsuchiis it is a nice pattern! Well done

1313886073400045568 2020-10-08 00:57:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SxnisterReaper Ok. I didn't know - I thought all this time that virtual meant that it was a pure AI
1313732711597699072 2020-10-07 14:47:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CHIZMAGA @DanBensonMusic Proof?
1313726297709981697 2020-10-07 14:22:11 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ls7jones @DanBensonMusic @MillerStream Please don't.  She's still a woman.
1313710069603807238 2020-10-07 13:17:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SxnisterReaper @Nux_Taku I do have a question. Some people act like mel is an actual person. Is she actually a set of programming, the AI/virtual streamer thing? Or is she an actual person pretending to be virtual with a voice modulator and using the avatar as a cover up?

Cancer is real and not everything is a play for power/destruction. People die from cancer. My grandfather also died from cancer. Give me reasonable proof that this is true.
1313586826758819840 2020-10-07 05:07:59 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @xendies Artistic expression. Not everything is going to blend well with the exact same style/colors. If someone can draw black princess peach, someone can make a black/brown character have a lighter skin tone. Quit complaining.

1313585137196687363 2020-10-07 05:01:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Orly_licious @bennyjohnson How many voters were polled?

1313515197114585090 2020-10-07 00:23:21 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Heath44 Yeah, most are dumb. IT should be the opposite, really - since japan doesn't take half of the bullshit being spewed.  Wait I think I messed up in what I said here. Screw it
1313514206738685952 2020-10-07 00:19:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FatherUpUSA @havameow You got a point
1313514045211922433 2020-10-07 00:18:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @tommietomm I tried watching it but I got bored

1313467904621453314 2020-10-06 21:15:26 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @HaroldIrving13 What the hell is that supposed to mean?  That's bull.  In other words, no I haven't heard.
1313467571400777730 2020-10-06 21:14:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @havameow @FatherUpUSA Yup.  That's what this dude thinks anyways. Nevermind the fact that slavery was and still is (in some places) a worldwide phenomenon. Blacks were also not the only slaves in pre-civil war time. Whites were also slaves. Every race has been enslaved in human history.
1313466966615699458 2020-10-06 21:11:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Jam_ba7 @SJPFISH Yes.  Actually, everyone should stick together, minority or not.  Because the people who do this shit don't care if you're a minority or have issues.
1313466681398906880 2020-10-06 21:10:34 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Txrangergal4 @SJPFISH While I agree, the table was rented.
1313465052553515008 2020-10-06 21:04:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DanBensonMusic That's great to hear! Er, read. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you can get back on your feet!  (I don't know all your circumstances so I dunno if you have a job. Sorry)
1313463285275127809 2020-10-06 20:57:04 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @OnTheDownLoTho This is funny!  It seemed like it was a baby shower?  But yeah.... sucks to be that guy. Unless.... if Crash is cannon in that universe... then so is Coco.  üòè
1313462087725789184 2020-10-06 20:52:19 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Fiaherart Uh, cool! I hope you find many ways to improve your style! Also congratulations!
1313461481372037120 2020-10-06 20:49:54 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @FatherRotten @thedelitesite My supervisor said "what idiot doesn't use netflix?" It seems like he doesn't know about the ped0 stuff. 140 IQ my ass
1313460732151902208 2020-10-06 20:46:56 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ProjektMelody Wait how are you able to post a tweet? Aren't you a set of robotic AI?
1313460206295232513 2020-10-06 20:44:50 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @strawberryener1 @matchamaIIow @mang0kitty alright. whatever
1313459864623034368 2020-10-06 20:43:29 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DailyBee3 Cute article, but you used "conversation-phobes". That's a very stupid term and shows the level of intelligence of your writing staff.
1313455580254797826 2020-10-06 20:26:27 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @mariuszsaint @Artia_Hololive WTF is this and why does it make no sense
1313333938304286720 2020-10-06 12:23:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Kimkun06 Something about this is just... satisfying. Aesthetically
1313331808336056322 2020-10-06 12:14:38 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @matchamaIIow @mang0kitty I'm going to ignore this. Yes, therapists are good at helping with good life advice, but acting like no one else can give you advice or question your actions?  That's not right. Whatever
1313331369611800578 2020-10-06 12:12:53 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @fennecwounds @mang0kitty Wat
1313330655430938624 2020-10-06 12:10:03 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CDawgVA Depressing. Like the rest of my life.

1313204122267643909 2020-10-06 03:47:15 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LackaTask @Ratt_Ratthew @Twitter That's how it's been for the past 3 years
1312605454762205184 2020-10-04 12:08:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kuki_tan Never mind. Just donated a few minutes ago. I hope you and your family recover swiftly. Good luck and God bless.
1312601692391735296 2020-10-04 11:53:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @kuki_tan I'm very sorry to hear this. I would love to donate and help you out.  I would commission you because I have a simple idea for one I've been playing with for a while now, but I would rather see you recovering from such a hardship. Is it possible to donate with paypal?
1312600798598246409 2020-10-04 11:49:51 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Teno_zx @Lost_Pause_ *fairer sex

1312600205032861696 2020-10-04 11:47:30 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ginryu_Gallo @Lost_Pause_ Plus... chicks with d^cks is a birth defect. It's almost sad, really.
1312599999210041344 2020-10-04 11:46:41 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Lost_Pause_ If that happens I riot.
1312599669420314626 2020-10-04 11:45:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DavidCh98454410 I'm a mix between 1 and 3.
1312599390520041472 2020-10-04 11:44:16 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LionessTakura Those labels are there mostly to keep people from suing the companies.  However, it does not make it any less true. Basic physics, my friends. Basic physics and viral science.
1312599000101662721 2020-10-04 11:42:43 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @WillSmi64435132 Could you please link me some scientific evidence, either through a randomized control trial or a higher level of standard, that explains how masks "work"?
1312598611142770689 2020-10-04 11:41:10 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @banned_2 Huh. never, uh... never seen that one before. Well. I knew the exception to wearing masks for over 20 minutes were surgeons, but even then they change theirs out frequently and only wear it a max of 2 hours. This is very interesting information.
1312597912271163393 2020-10-04 11:38:23 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LovesickMadisen You mean people who can think for themselves. Apparently, you lack understanding of viral science and basic physics.
1312597566203273217 2020-10-04 11:37:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Nodnarb68057224 Awesome! I do have one question though. Should I brush my teeth since I have to wear a mask at work?
1312596832598601728 2020-10-04 11:34:06 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ukn96 @JasonFalls @loucityfc Because people are too afraid to be wrong and admit that "experts" can be wrong or misleading. It's fear. completely driven by fear and not logic. The only reason I wear one is so I don't get fired from my current job.
1312596355995643904 2020-10-04 11:32:12 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @DTyra11 Teeth I'm not too sure. Since I have to wear one for work, I've been brushing my teeth less and less because it blocks the smell of bad breath. I mean, if it can block a virus that's 3 times smaller than the gaps in the fabric, then it can block bad breath!   But ye u right
1312595632654348288 2020-10-04 11:29:20 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @GayHaIIoween @JasonFalls @loucityfc Do some research about the material and get back on that.
1312430231341465602 2020-10-04 00:32:05 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @lindseytnamez Well, it's the same character, so it doesn't matter
1312429884795387904 2020-10-04 00:30:42 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @CatriaThicc Congrats!
1312429713491660805 2020-10-04 00:30:02 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @PeteLavaDigger Yup. She only gets a female amiibo because male corrin is... lacking. I mean most people consider female corrin to be the diffinitive one anyway
1312251534894403584 2020-10-03 12:42:01 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @Ariaizz @thepennyhoarder I kinda want to move to Utah.  Mormons are there, sure, but at least it ain't "commonwealth".
1312251308318040064 2020-10-03 12:41:07 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @8212Ridge @KY_Dadof3 Twitter will give you brain damage to last you 2 lifetimes if you're on there for at least a week. My tip: Follow a few artists, you're bound to have a better experience. Now whether or not you like art, that's another story.
1312250879865741312 2020-10-03 12:39:24 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @ConnieD36983725 @dancingdelilah @88JWR882 @thepennyhoarder Cases. Not deaths. Let me know when the deaths top 5,000, in a state with roughly 4.4 million people. And yes, I live in this state and it sickens me to wear a face-diaper.
1312086890980532226 2020-10-03 01:47:46 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Don't mean to bother you, but I bought the volume(2)! I look forward to supporting you in the future!

1312056843347386375 2020-10-02 23:48:22 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @costtaconcordia I hate to say I am one of those.
1312056602934079489 2020-10-02 23:47:25 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @LoliPropagandaB I'm very sorry to hear that. I hope you can build back those friendships, as I too, am trying to do. I know how it feels.
1311896141592702976 2020-10-02 13:09:48 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Ok, cool.
1311874430612770825 2020-10-02 11:43:32 +0800 <GentleLearGamma> @SilentTandem Congrats! I'd buy it, but I still live with my folks and it... uh... wouldn't be very convenient for them to see me buying this.  Still,  great work, and I look forward to seeing what you're doing for October.
