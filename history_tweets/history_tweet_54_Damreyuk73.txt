1344024134158872581 2020-12-30 04:54:59 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @virginmedia broadband down again in BD5 area üôÑ I never had a problem when I was with @talktalk. Just a shame talktalk  couldn't offer me same speed at my new address otherwise I'd never have opted for this overpriced rubbish üôÅ
1343980251932729345 2020-12-30 02:00:36 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc @Bradford_TandA Thanks, I have already reported it, but it's becoming so regular on this street that I feel more publicity is needed to make people aware and hopefully cause the culprits to desist
1343515934754009088 2020-12-28 19:15:34 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Fly tippers strike again at the top of Silverdale Road @bradfordmdc surely it's time to install a camera. What's wrong with these people? No thought for the environment @Bradford_TandA #bd5 #Bradford #flytipping  https://t.co/AMcGEh03Ay
1343515213950234624 2020-12-28 19:12:42 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Fly tippers strike again at the top of Silverdale Road @bradfordmdc surely it's time to install a camera. What's wrong with these people? No thought for the environment @Bradford_TandA #bd5 #Bradford #flytipping
1341503935631286274 2020-12-23 06:00:36 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Just want to say thank you to @bradfordmdc for cleaning the back of Silverdale Road. I picked up some litter at the weekend, but this evening, it looks spotless. The street cleaners must have been today. I hope the residents will show some respect for the area now :)
1341389391399411712 2020-12-22 22:25:27 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @AldiUK Unfortunately, I no longer have the receipt. I generally don't keep them for perishable items.
1341364067651432448 2020-12-22 20:44:49 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB I sent details. to @LidlGB as requested. Seems they are just ignoring it now
1341363373372559363 2020-12-22 20:42:04 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @AldiUK Just start away from the ham...  https://t.co/kRzj9CN28a
1341356158867660800 2020-12-22 20:13:24 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @Bradford_TandA Yes, more peace for humans and animals
1341355997466685442 2020-12-22 20:12:45 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Went to make a ham sandwich with ham from @AldiUK only opened yesterday. It's been in the fridge since then, and it's gone grey at the edges. I'll not be buying again! I'll get my ham from @LidlGB  https://t.co/ygbq9moiVZ
1340974404625424391 2020-12-21 18:56:26 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc Thank you. I wish people in Bradford would be more responsible. Maybe it needs more press coverage again. @Bradford_TandA  https://t.co/VZ68rPlxMQ
1340215778222759936 2020-12-19 16:41:56 +0800 <Damreyuk73> #flytipping once again in #westbowling #bd5 #Silverdaleroad How can people think this is acceptable? It's an absolute disgrace. I hope @bradfordmdc take strong action against the perpetrators!  https://t.co/5SyalpZg8p
1339570178141634564 2020-12-17 21:56:33 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB I still haven't had a reply from @LidlGB about this
1338816116173500424 2020-12-15 20:00:10 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB I sent a DM to @LidlGB with full details, but have received no further reply
1337511422209781765 2020-12-12 05:35:47 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @DVLAgovuk Well a lad on my street gets car after car and drives them all without tax and /or MOT. I report it to @DVLAgovuk and @WestYorksPolice but still he continues to drive the vehicles. It makes a mockery out of the rest of us tax payers.
1337153229302456321 2020-12-11 05:52:27 +0800 <Damreyuk73> How is it that young lads can regularly drive untaxed cars with no mot on roads of @bradfordmdc without the @DVLAgovuk or @WestYorksPolice being able to do anything?
1336747137590300674 2020-12-10 02:58:47 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why doesnt @DVLAgovuk take stronger action against drivers who repeatedly drive untaxed cars? @bradfordmdc has a massive problem. Especially in BD5. Cars without tax and mot driven at speed on our streets.  @WYP_RPU please improve our safety and end this mockery
1336576015473266688 2020-12-09 15:38:49 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @ChargeYourCar app is absolutely useless. Once again I've connected my car and I can't connect via the app. It keeps saying no connection when there clearly is. I emailed the company last week and no reply!
1335884174599876608 2020-12-07 17:49:41 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why is that out of every box of Bella Caff√® pods from @LidlGB there's nearly always one or two which are faulty? They just spray all over the machine
1332487594463154178 2020-11-28 08:52:53 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc another reason to take action against residents who leave rubbish in their gardens. Officer been many times to one and still not sorted:  https://t.co/PZh6c1urHl
1332403746442240007 2020-11-28 03:19:42 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why isn't @bradfordmdc more committed to the environment? Idling cars, bonfires, fireworks, gardens full of rubbish! This city is a city of filth
1332018889098731520 2020-11-27 01:50:25 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc @Imran_HussainMP If only. It's across BD5
1332018667865972736 2020-11-27 01:49:32 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why is @bradfordmdc so hesitant to take action regarding idling vehicles, burning of noxious substances, and residents who refuse again and again to remove rubbish from their gardens? This city is becoming an environmental disaster and a massive garbage dump.Leeds is much cleaner
1330922249721884679 2020-11-24 01:12:46 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @Imran_HussainMP @bradfordmdc. Yet again, extremely loud fireworks in BD5 tonight. Why isn't anything being done?!
1330211244876369924 2020-11-22 02:07:29 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB have you stopped doing the granola squares in your bakery? I tried one a few weeks ago - best granola slice I've ever had. There's no trace of them in the store ever since :-(
1329925846317092873 2020-11-21 07:13:25 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @WestYorkshireCA @cllrjudithblake @SHinchcliffe That picture is so unrealistic for Bradford. Where's all the rubbish, the discarded food waste, rats and flashes from noisy bangers going off? ü§î
1329915819233566725 2020-11-21 06:33:34 +0800 <Damreyuk73> And another (at 22:30)
1329906784971214849 2020-11-21 05:57:40 +0800 <Damreyuk73> And another. Absolutely unacceptable at 10pm
1329897554562199552 2020-11-21 05:20:59 +0800 <Damreyuk73> It's nice that @bradfordmdc protects its staff from the smoke. It's a shame it allows its residents to be subject to noxious smoke from gardens, fireworks at loud as bombs going off every night and gardens so full of rubbish that rats are all around
1329896907523690500 2020-11-21 05:18:25 +0800 <Damreyuk73> And another
1329894344325738499 2020-11-21 05:08:14 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Massive loud bang again tonight
1329827477385072643 2020-11-21 00:42:32 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @Imran_HussainMP @bradfordmdc I am absolutely sick and tired of hearing extremely loud explosions in BD5 almost every night. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's fed up with this constant use of fireworks. Can't anything be done? It's been raised before as an issue in Bradford
1329497512626024449 2020-11-20 02:51:22 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Good to see @Imran_HussainMP has expressed concerns over this pollution. What is @bradfordmdc doing about local residents and landlords who regularly burn carpets etc in gardens causing noxious fumes?
1329192983632240640 2020-11-19 06:41:17 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Will @asda Bradford ever install free electric car chargers as @Tesco and @AldiUK have? I prefer to shop at Asda but the chargers are swaying me to Tesco and Aldi. Well done Tesco and Aldi. Come on Asda, do your bit :)
1327563392886956032 2020-11-14 18:45:52 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why do the @DailyMailUK papers in @Morrisons Mayo Ave, Bradford not have weekend supplements in them today? This is the only reason my dad wants the paper. I had to leave the store and go to the petrol station to get one. Lazy staff?
1326556595384438793 2020-11-12 00:05:13 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc Do you mean it's not available or it's now available?
1326123993888399360 2020-11-10 19:26:12 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc please could you send out clear public information to inform residents about the acceptable ways to dispose of different rubbish, and not to leave parked cars running on public streets? This would improve the state of this deprived and dirty city
1325167672821116931 2020-11-08 04:06:08 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @viva_jenna @Bradford_TandA Looks like parliament will have to debate the potential ban now   https://t.co/dgQLwVtde9

1325166058039255042 2020-11-08 03:59:43 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Stop selling them altogether
1325165922957582338 2020-11-08 03:59:11 +0800 <Damreyuk73> It's about time our society banned the sale of these dangerous fireworks. We all want safety and peace!
1325165568492621825 2020-11-08 03:57:46 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Definitely! Ban these stupid fireworks now!
1325164863459520513 2020-11-08 03:54:58 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc @RSPCA_Frontline @CatsProtection @GOVUK another reason to #banfireworks these people are sick. It's about time our society ended this nonsense!
1325126547662102529 2020-11-08 01:22:43 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Fireworks yet again tonight as loud as explosives. When will this end? Why does society tolerate such antisocial behaviour?
1325123597799665664 2020-11-08 01:10:59 +0800 <Damreyuk73> I hope they're shut down for good. Fireworks are a public menace. There are still bangers going off every night and they sound more like explosives. Why does society in the 21st century tolerate such antisocial behaviour? Give us some peace!
1325122830107877376 2020-11-08 01:07:56 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB Well it happens most weeks, so something has been seriously wrong. The papers are being sold not as advertised
1325059112439324673 2020-11-07 20:54:45 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB How does it happen anyway?
1325052008726999045 2020-11-07 20:26:31 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB Hi, this happens almost every Saturday. The store is in Shelf, Halifax Road, Bradford
1325031728931606529 2020-11-07 19:05:56 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Why yet again do the @DailyMailUK papers @LidlGB not have the weekend supplement in them? This is the only reason my dad wants the paper. This happens nearly every week meaning I have to go to another shop for it. So frustrating!
1324806053624745986 2020-11-07 04:09:11 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc I wish you'd just ban the sale of them altogether. BD5 has sounded like a war zone every night for weeks. Last night was absolutely horrendous. Now tonight is like bonfire night part 2. Most of us just want peace!
1323725782657732610 2020-11-04 04:36:34 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @Bradford_TandA I wish @bradfordmdc would do something about the constant loud fireworks going off into late hours every night. It sounds like a war zone. Can't we have some peace? Stop the sale of these offensive public nuisances
1318671944498188288 2020-10-21 05:54:25 +0800 <Damreyuk73> My @Samsung not so smart TV says I need to download "Samsung Smart View 2.0" to get screen mirroring from my phone, but the app doesn't appear in the Play Store. Other screen apps don't recognise the TV
1317393463500034048 2020-10-17 17:14:12 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Yet again the @DailyMailUK papers have no weekend inserts in @LidlGB!
1317232564172656641 2020-10-17 06:34:50 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB So the scratch card is a con then really. It expires in 7 days, which is when I'll next be in Lidl using the other voucher. Why were the vouchers I activated yesterday de-activated when I was in store today as well. Did any other @LidlGB find their activated coupons de-activated?
1317034478888472581 2020-10-16 17:27:43 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LidlGB plus app is useless. Activated coupons last night, and after shopping today, I've noticed they weren't active. Another customer was pointing this out at the till. Now my new scratchcard isn't activating!  https://t.co/oV75gt4roY
1317013115683409920 2020-10-16 16:02:50 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @eonenergyuk Not as advertised in your booklet. It's a shame I'm tied in for 12 months  https://t.co/BJYb2kE3xa
1317012595057041408 2020-10-16 16:00:46 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @eonenergyuk Hi, thanks for your reply. I've since learned that these smart meters update gas information every 30 minutes. Hardly real time that. This means you can't actually see what a gas appliance is using there and then. It's only historical data. Pretty poor really.
1317011453770145792 2020-10-16 15:56:14 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @pollyhanah @jen_freeman @kezwalsh_env @Novavax @NovavaxMedia Ah, thanks for that. My local clinic weren't aware of that. They just said it's not working and will do soon üôÑ
1316033687591546881 2020-10-13 23:10:56 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @kezwalsh_env @Novavax Any joy with your diary yet? Mine still isn't working and there's been no response from @Novavax @NovavaxMedia
1316029825799258117 2020-10-13 22:55:35 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @pollyhanah @jen_freeman @kezwalsh_env @Novavax Has your diary started to work yet? Mine hasn't. Still no response from @Novavax @NovavaxMedia about problems with the diary app. It's a little concerning ü§î
1316029470122274817 2020-10-13 22:54:10 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @jen_freeman @pollyhanah @kezwalsh_env @Novavax Looks like I'm not getting the alerts now either. Still no response from @Novavax
1315380940277940227 2020-10-12 03:57:09 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @pollyhanah @kezwalsh_env @Novavax Oh OK. Thanks. Glad it's not just me. I am receiving alerts to complete the diary, but there's nothing to complete when I open it up. Hopefully they'll get it sorted soon
1315380904349532162 2020-10-12 03:57:00 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @kezwalsh_env @Novavax Oh OK. Thanks. Glad it's not just me. I am receiving alerts to complete the diary, but there's nothing to complete when I open it up. Hopefully they'll get it sorted soon
1315012904828235777 2020-10-11 03:34:42 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @Novavax I started the novavax trial yesterday and was asked to download the app for recording diary information. However, there are no forms to complete except the introduction. Is this normal?
1314653735101116417 2020-10-10 03:47:30 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Had a not-so-smart meter fitted by @eonenergyuk. They're supposed to give real time use yeah? The gas only updates every so often and says what was being used at that time. Nice one #eon #smartmeter
1314139854792515584 2020-10-08 17:45:31 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @bradfordmdc @Bradford_TandA @NazShahBfd I've reported this countless times. Officers have visited and made threats of possible fines etc, but the problem persists. Some residents take no notice. There's food waste, sofas, furniture parts, carpet, fridge, bed etc.
1314114188751646720 2020-10-08 16:03:32 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Here was the article  https://t.co/BBaSmie9R3
1314113933171658752 2020-10-08 16:02:31 +0800 <Damreyuk73> It seems @bradfordmdc have forgotten about their pledge in the @Bradford_TandA to those in #Bradford who want a clean neighbourhood. @NazShahBfd would do well to have a walk along the back of my street or other streets in BD5 where residents dump carpets, fridges, furniture etc
1314109124649590785 2020-10-08 15:43:24 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Sorry, I meant William
1314108199264542721 2020-10-08 15:39:44 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Good to hear Prince Harry speaking from the idyllic Kensington Gardens about the #EarthshotPrize. I wish he'd walk in the streets of #Bradford and see the garbage I have to look at every day left in residents' gardens which @bradfordmdc will not tackle. Surely cleanup starts here
1313454267462758401 2020-10-06 20:21:14 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @DVLAgovuk aren't interested in chasing car tax dodgers. Reported to them and they haven't taken any action. Meanwhile, the criminal continues to drive dangerously where there are children. @WestYorksPolice weren't interested either
1312798350924804097 2020-10-05 00:54:52 +0800 <Damreyuk73> Whatever happened to the zero tolerance to garden waste promoted by @bradfordmdc? As reported by @Bradford_TandA in 2015? Many areas of Bradford are looking like waste dumps and are a breeding ground for vermin! This needs tackling!  https://t.co/8SQMCNi1Hx
1308136756156477440 2020-09-22 04:11:21 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @HastingsDirect Thanks. Just replied using the link you gave me
1308133379850883073 2020-09-22 03:57:56 +0800 <Damreyuk73> The guy on the phone never said anything about the charge. What is more, when the renewal quote came to me by email, it didn't even have the cost of the insurance in it  https://t.co/UttGGzFkbB
1308131127685771268 2020-09-22 03:48:59 +0800 <Damreyuk73> My car insurance @HastingsDirect runs out tomorrow. I called them to say I've just sold my car so don't want to renew. I've just received an email which says they've charged my a ¬£45 cancellation fee! Daylight robbery @HastingsDirect. Stay away from them!
1306495952207966209 2020-09-17 15:31:23 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @tm_gilman @NHSMidlands @PHE_uk @bradfordmdc No idea. Bit of a useless scam if they don't collect them. It was a test which matched up with the NHS website for registering it...
1306492419433734146 2020-09-17 15:17:20 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @SkyNews "Mr Johnson has urged people to speak with rule breakers before notifying the authorities." Try that up north and risk being stabbed or shot!
1306339952997867520 2020-09-17 05:11:30 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @AngelaRayner Strange that 3 people from @PHE_uk or @bradfordmdc came to my door today giving me a test kit without my requesting one. They said it's because the rate is high in my area. They said they'd be back to collect it at 5. They still haven't turned up. What a waste!
1306338922495172608 2020-09-17 05:07:24 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @DHSCgovuk Strange that 3 people from @PHE_uk or @bradfordmdc came to my door today giving me a test kit without my requesting one.

1303001093337686017 2020-09-08 00:04:03 +0800 <Damreyuk73> @LBCNews I was in the supermarket at the weekend. Unbelievable how many people weren't wearing masks. I'm sure they weren't all genuinely exempt. People are so complacent even in Bradford where there's a local lock down
