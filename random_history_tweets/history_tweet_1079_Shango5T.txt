Western culture is what...I mean right now Christianity is a mainstay in Africa, RAP is in Africa, and numerous other western believes are part of the fabric of Africa. I’m not trying to be difficult; I don’t want to make a mistake when I visit.

1343199724556455937 2020-12-27 22:19:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @wodouble22 No.  The major ingredient to c**ning is westernized Christianity.  In addition to the lack of an education which increases the prospect of c**ning. Candace Owens, Silk and Diamond don’t have two years of college amongst them and they are some of the worst.
1343198081156866049 2020-12-27 22:12:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @ESPNigga @Elsieyalater Good point!! Continental Africans need to start advertising African destinations to the African diaspora.

Russia is crazy rich and they buckled under a partial embargo. Mugabe panicked and made some wrong decisions, but the effects of that embargo wasn’t just limited

1342179760965890054 2020-12-25 02:46:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @ElisMyVoice @RasThaFarEye I agree with you for the most part, but the exception is the word, “Tribe” is an English word. Africans never called their societies tribes.
1342178625873965064 2020-12-25 02:41:35 +0800 <Shango5T> These mf’s were just satanic evil.

1342149231918936065 2020-12-25 00:44:47 +0800 <Shango5T> @Judicaelle_ This is exactly what I keep saying.  Hollywood hires white writers and get African Americans to say the dumb ass lines. Eddie Murphy is powerful enough to push back on this stupidity.
1342148315681615873 2020-12-25 00:41:09 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye Yep...listen to some of the dumbass jokes.  African self-depreciation has to end.
1342147939993579522 2020-12-25 00:39:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni YES...but he was too much of a liability.  Johnny law was breathing down his neck, for the second time, and he had too much dirt on too many powerful people. Even if he pardoned him, he was going to have the proverbial, accident, which would ended his life.
1342146171301752833 2020-12-25 00:32:37 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Yeah...I would say more, but I know I’d get kicked off of Twitter, so I’ll just make my usual statement when I agree with someone: I agree with you wholeheartedly.

1341905597768343552 2020-12-24 08:36:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlackdiasporaV1 First, I agree with you wholeheartedly. Second, the white establishment killing Africans and preserving members of the white establishment - that’s a novelty. NOT!
1341904798161973254 2020-12-24 08:33:29 +0800 <Shango5T> That’s why I’m not going to watch it. I’m sick of Hollywood, and it doesn’t matter the hue of the person, making jokes about Africa or Africans.  We need to boycott this movie and send a message that African self-depreciation movies are no longer tolerated.

1341759355755085825 2020-12-23 22:55:33 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Africans/Black c**n because of self-gratification, fear, ignorance, brainwashing; and they’ve given up on themselves and anyone who looks like them. Except for the ones who seek self-gratification and chaos, I feel sorry for them. I pray they find their way back to their path.

1341566365308739587 2020-12-23 10:08:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni Bruh...they separated over money, not philosophical differences.  If Tariq wanted to, he could’ve been a great spokesperson for the African/Black community, but he chose a different route.
1341565716772892672 2020-12-23 10:06:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni You and I can have a long discussion on how some African Americans and Africans look down on one another. There’s no denying we have a mass load of people suffering from the white establishment’s brainwashing. But it’s about time for us realize we have to break the mental chains.
1341564127525941253 2020-12-23 09:59:47 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly...that nonsense surprised me about him.  The brother was a phenomenal spokesperson, then he lost his mind, and buddied up with crackpot, Yvette Carnell.
1341563555473207297 2020-12-23 09:57:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni True...however, that’s when he was sharing some phenomenal information; before the Divide and Conquer African xenophobia.
1341562996842180609 2020-12-23 09:55:18 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly...it’s just Tariq is not the best spokesman for African history...his FBA, ADOS association disqualifies his as a respectable source.
1341561465778614272 2020-12-23 09:49:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly.
1341561387739303941 2020-12-23 09:48:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni Ok, but Tariq is still a nut and a con man.

1341470656626618369 2020-12-23 03:48:22 +0800 <Shango5T> I personally know numerous Nigerians, some I player soccer with, and I have NEVER heard anyone say Akata.  That nonsense has been blown way out of context.
1341467846434562050 2020-12-23 03:37:12 +0800 <Shango5T> @Beeseewillie Yep...that’s the recipe for a future heart attack.
1341449870545182720 2020-12-23 02:25:46 +0800 <Shango5T> @Ugoufinite I don’t know how I feel about this.  On one hand the white establishment has a history of stealing culture, technology, and history. On the other hand, with technology and a more awoke African diaspora that’s sort of difficult. However, I do like the exposure of African culture.
1341433764170350593 2020-12-23 01:21:46 +0800 <Shango5T> Yes.  And Britain is intrinsically part of Egypt’s social and political fabric. Donald Trump often refers to Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as his "favourite dictator"

In my opinion, the biggest fall for African countries is to try to emulate Arab countries. Oil rich S.Sudan and the right administration can place Sudan on the path to prosperity.
1341078220519723008 2020-12-22 01:48:58 +0800 <Shango5T> @BruceTh39654475 Nothing. Everything is falling into place; Bashir was arrested and he’s going to be transferred to the ICC. N.Sudan is no longer controlled by the military. The country has been taken off of the terrorist state list by the US, and they are reaching out to other African countries
1341068246347370496 2020-12-22 01:09:20 +0800 <Shango5T> @BruceTh39654475 The war in Darfar.  Under Omar al-Bashi, S. Sudanese were treated horribly.  His obsession with being Arab decimated Sudan, not to mention he was corruption. The Janjaweed were a branch of his murderous regime and they raped, murdered and burn people alive, including children.

1341056149735559169 2020-12-22 00:21:16 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...I can envision greatness for that area. But, I want a Nubian State within Sudan. I’d love for Egypt to sell part of the Aswan to Sudan so the entire Nubian land can be reclaimed. Ok, I just wen on a tangent, my bad😂😂😂😂😂
1341054704281894918 2020-12-22 00:15:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter It’s true for some, and false for others. The assassination records by the Europeans and the US shows me some leaders wanted chart their countries own destiny. However, some African leaders have the will and heart of a snow flake and simply want to be a puppet and not a puppeteer

1340824412908609536 2020-12-21 09:00:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @arise_ghana Yep...based on their racist dogma, and without a shred of even pseudo facts, they spread the inane tale that Portuguese travelers built it. I honestly believe the white establishment is obsessed with us.
1340817226212012032 2020-12-21 08:31:52 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree, however, personally I’m sick of African/Black people who act like they grew up in an alternate reality. They see the torture that our ancestors experienced, and it means nothing to them. Some how they’ve concluded it’s easier to join white supremest, instead of fighting

1340703580383289344 2020-12-21 01:00:17 +0800 <Shango5T> @BruceTh39654475 I agree with you, true journalism is a fading profession. However, there are still a few like Bob Woodward, Lesley Stahl and Bill Whitaker.

1340668038782267394 2020-12-20 22:39:03 +0800 <Shango5T> That’s because England and the old apartheid government are still pulling the strings. It funny how Botswana is a neighboring country and they don’t have these problems.

1340589173913362433 2020-12-20 17:25:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @NubiaAmbassador Bruh...the white establishment has always made that one of their talking points. So, you’ve never read about a white person tell an African American  “go back to Africa?”
1340588409623093249 2020-12-20 17:22:38 +0800 <Shango5T> @NubiaAmbassador @jackflapcentral How do you know we were the first...😒.  That’s a false assumption.

Our DNA was bestowed upon us by God and it helps us retain our link to our family and ancestors. It certifies that we don’t need the approval of other Africans to be African.

1340322756970352643 2020-12-19 23:47:01 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter You and I agree on a great deal. Matter of fact, I JOKINGLY believe you’re stealing my thoughts😂😂😂.  But on this subject we differ. These people hate Africans. They may reside on the continent, but their hearts are geared towards the demise of African culture and the people.🙏🏿

1339600472131338240 2020-12-17 23:56:55 +0800 <Shango5T> True...however, unfortunately I think that’s true throughout the world. Very few people are concerned about their world neighbor. In Yemen, children are starving, Cameroon is full of atrocities, and so many more instances; and we all stand by and simply watch.😒
1339595297068969986 2020-12-17 23:36:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @choobop22 @AishaDaughter In my opinion, the western media has done a great job of dividing the African masses.  And it only takes a few loud mouth negative people who buy into their bs to cause discontent.
1339594853550682114 2020-12-17 23:34:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @choobop22 @AishaDaughter It depends on who you meet. You and I have met great people, some are not so lucky, and they feed off of the stereotypes created by the white establishment. Western media have been spreading discontent amongst Continental Africans and the African diaspora for the last 300 years.
1339594093219835908 2020-12-17 23:31:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @choobop22 @AishaDaughter Negative people attract other negative people - mostly. To your point, I love being around continental Africans. My experience has always been extremely pleasant. But a lot of AA have never met an African from the continent, they get their info from the loud mouth negative people
1339590478421843975 2020-12-17 23:17:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @choobop22 @AishaDaughter 😂😂💯✊🏿
1339590303280320512 2020-12-17 23:16:31 +0800 <Shango5T> The entire South African Apartheid government needs to be indicted for crimes against humanity.
1339589241706180608 2020-12-17 23:12:18 +0800 <Shango5T> @choobop22 @AishaDaughter Bruh, we’ve been schooled to believe that it’s us against the world. Most AA don’t realize we have allies. We’ve only been introduced to other African/Blacks who don’t want to associate with AA. I viscerally hate the ADOS cult group, yet there’s a reason why this cult group exist
1339587449199071234 2020-12-17 23:05:10 +0800 <Shango5T> Damn...💯💯💯✊🏿
1339586083479191560 2020-12-17 22:59:45 +0800 <Shango5T> Honestly, most African Americans don’t know anything about Black Colombians. Must AA feel like it’s us against the world. I’m not trying to make excuses, most just don’t know.
1339584250396377088 2020-12-17 22:52:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @SomewhereonEa11 I agree with you...it allows them to hide and still spread their ignorance.
1339583657951055872 2020-12-17 22:50:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter The educational system, movies, and books in the US focus only on the Africans being brought to the US. Most AA believe 90% of the Africans kidnapped were brought to the US, instead of 4%. However, with the Internet the excuse that we weren’t taught in school is no longer viable.
1339581960692240393 2020-12-17 22:43:22 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly!!

1339383405100879872 2020-12-17 09:34:22 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...deny Africans have a history, create opportunities for traitors to cause chaos, and lay the bewilderment and confusion at our feet. We know better, but we act like we don’t.
1339379886536974336 2020-12-17 09:20:24 +0800 <Shango5T> @TriteTrite I agree with you wholeheartedly. That’s how the current power structure wins - Divide and Conquer.  I’m hoping with more knowledge and communication things can change. I think a lot of us are trying to do more. Conversations are always a good stepping stone.
1339377883656167424 2020-12-17 09:12:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @RafiqMustafaa I agree with you wholeheartedly...TP Studios have a lot of potential.  I wish he produced better shows.

1339376378882502656 2020-12-17 09:06:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @RafiqMustafaa I agree with you wholeheartedly...all of it takes money, power, and influence. I think we’re moving in the right direction, but it takes our(African/Black people) support.
1339371035599245312 2020-12-17 08:45:13 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...I think it’s maddening that the world has not taken notice of the atrocities taking place in Yemen.
1339366323743313920 2020-12-17 08:26:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @RafiqMustafaa It’s happening, it’s just happening slowly. We have KweliTV, ONE, Tyler Perry Studios, and a few others. The minute we start boycotting black topics, the white establishment will resort back to their own bs beliefs that no one is interested in African/Black movies or shows.
1339349668694814723 2020-12-17 07:20:19 +0800 <Shango5T> @RafiqMustafaa Actually, African American and Black British actors should work together.  The most successful formula that the white establishment uses on us is, “Divide and Conquer”. African/Black people need to work together and build studios to tell all of our stories.
1339346562699448324 2020-12-17 07:07:59 +0800 <Shango5T> @Vanessa60926573 This is where I disagree...the white establishment is pitting African Americans against the African diaspora. Here’s what I propose, support African/Black directors to tell our stories.  For example: Spike Lee, Jordan Peele, Allen Hughes, Antoine Fuqua:  https://t.co/MxBD11BEif

In the US, the only freedom fighter talked about, at nauseam, is Martin Luther King. Granted, King was great, but damn! Can we include other people who were just as great!?
1339222116487622657 2020-12-16 22:53:28 +0800 <Shango5T> This is sad, we can’t even rely on African/Black leaders to do the right thing.😒

1338245815584886784 2020-12-14 06:14:00 +0800 <Shango5T> That has always been the problem with African leaders, worldwide - they are surrounded with traitors.
1338241622027415554 2020-12-14 05:57:20 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly💯💯💯
1338241435141894146 2020-12-14 05:56:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I’ve noticed most African leaders see leadership as a means to become wealthy...they plan their retirement on day one. That’s why most African leaders become multi-millionaires when they are put in the role of leadership.
1338238492657283072 2020-12-14 05:44:54 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly.
1338233201307901952 2020-12-14 05:23:53 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye @AishaDaughter In all honesty, no.  However, Africans were no different than all the ethnic groups of the world. Everyone during that period of time were embroiled in their own ancient squabble. Unfortunately, Africans, unwittingly, became the target of of the most devilish acts of humanity.
1338230528525340675 2020-12-14 05:13:15 +0800 <Shango5T> Africans want recolonization operate from a standard of inferiority. They believe the lies of the white establishment.

The last comment brought a great deal of clarity. Twitter only allows us a few characters and sometimes our real meaning can get lost. That’s why I asked for clarity.
1337846421647716352 2020-12-13 03:46:57 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Good point. And considering where this traditional legal attire originated; I start to wonder about the depths of influence in other societal practices in those countries.

1337837371195355138 2020-12-13 03:10:59 +0800 <Shango5T> @ksekweyama @AishaDaughter Exactly!  They don’t see that they have bottomed out.  They don’t see that they have become the thing that the white establishment has sought to cultivate - which is a mindless servant.
1337833659404083200 2020-12-13 02:56:14 +0800 <Shango5T> @ksekweyama @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly.

A great deal can be implied from your statement: “You guys always choose to focus on the negatives.” 👈🏿 That’s where the confusion began, because people can only read what you’ve written. Why don’t you clarify your comments😒
1337830720652402688 2020-12-13 02:44:34 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly, and that is the very sad reality. African/Black people have ingested white supremest dogma about ourselves.
1337830222218063872 2020-12-13 02:42:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you. This person is regurgitating the white establishment’s talking points. They never stop and think about the murdered African leaders who didn’t tow the colonialist line, and who wanted a better life for their citizens, or the rigged global economic system.
1337828632111312899 2020-12-13 02:36:16 +0800 <Shango5T> @BruceTh39654475 I agree with you wholeheartedly.

1337820130219323392 2020-12-13 02:02:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @ksekweyama @AishaDaughter Bruh...when I read or hear an African/Black person regurgitate “Manifest Destiny” propaganda, which was created by white supremacy, along with the continued worship of a white God by African/Black people; the future for African/Black people scares the hell out of me.
1337765039294517249 2020-12-12 22:23:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter It amazes me that Africans who make these comments do so without using history, politics, Eurocentric economic policies, or European interference. This type of brainwashing will keep Blacks/Africans subservient. This dude has latched onto a white supremest talking point😒

How about how white males are abusive and irresponsible?  Again, nope. How about how white men love Black women? Nope, won’t see that discussions either.

1337110039614590982 2020-12-11 03:00:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly...African/Black people need to embed their actions in our heads. Any other person, with the exception of a white male, would have been castigated and laughed out of office.

1337104337059926019 2020-12-11 02:38:10 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you💯. Castro and Che Guevara acts were only ancillary. In no way, shape or form should their actions be prioritized over and beyond our acknowledgment of ourselves. It took African activities, organizations, and institutions to be the instruments of our liberation.
1337095544695566342 2020-12-11 02:03:14 +0800 <Shango5T> @Tufohenee @kzshabazz If you worship God, you worship Allah. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam revolves around the same mores and religious concepts ; faith and belief in God; and how we treat our fellow human being. However, institutional religion is different because of the added cultural dogma.
1337088137651220485 2020-12-11 01:33:48 +0800 <Shango5T> @kelvin__kamau @AishaDaughter The period that Che Guevara lived, I’m not surprised that he may have spewed racist rhetoric. However, he literally put his life on the line for Africans, AA, and African Cubans. I’m not a Che apologist; I try to be pragmatic. During his time, his revolutionary stands meant death
1337086077950103553 2020-12-11 01:25:37 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I hadn’t really thought about the quintessential “savior mentality” that may have played a part with Che’s actions. However, I can’t diminish the actions he took in Africa, Cuba, or the US. During his time, his actions were a death sentence by white imperialism.
1337083615230963712 2020-12-11 01:15:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @kzshabazz If you’re serious about African agency then you must accept the fact that all three major religions in the world are rooted from Africa.  And the English definition of “Allah” is simply “God”.

While people applaud Lincoln and Lyndon B. Johnson, I think it’s the epitome of hypocrisy and arrogance to condemn Che

1336887426376212480 2020-12-10 12:16:15 +0800 <Shango5T> @DrTGIF @MalikThaElite Black men have been falsely accused of rape for centuries, only to find out after their death they were innocent. Nate Parker didn’t accept a plea agreement, he went on trial and was found innocent by an ALL WHITE jury, which in America is a miracle, or the man was just innocent.

The issue has always been control and conformity. Ultimately, one has to choose between the institutions of human beings or the faith and belief of God.
1336405579019980802 2020-12-09 04:21:33 +0800 <Shango5T> @JDseanthesnake Atheism is a belief; it’s an absence of belief in the existence of deities. True religion doesn’t deal with physical liberation. It focuses on the soul, and our relationship with God and our fellow human beings. The sprinkled in stupidity comes from human institutions and dogma.
1336388952052412417 2020-12-09 03:15:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @mwaniki_mwangi7 @AishaDaughter Actually the Africans learned English from the white establishment.  People forget only the white elite were educated, the rest of the white establishment had the same education as the Africans.
1336388022431084547 2020-12-09 03:11:48 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter If they’re peddling that nonsense, then all Africans who are Christian, Jewish, or atheist can not be PanAfricanist.
1336382167220424704 2020-12-09 02:48:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter With the so-called Black English, If you want to convey a thought or an argument your audience is limited. Africans have always spoke several languages in order to socialize and do business; speaking English should be status quo.
1336380479172435977 2020-12-09 02:41:49 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I’ve been accused of something similar...people always look for reasons to discount the knowledge and wisdom that you try to share. I tell them they are wrong and simply keep moving.

I’m taking a class on comparative religion and the way the professor described Sufism made my heart jump. I agree with you wholeheartedly...for anyone African/Black person who believes in God, it would behoove they to checkout Sufism.✊🏿

I think the Arab practices are divisive and their mores are racist as hell. Arabs were practicing racism long before Islam.  Muhammad tried to drown it out but when he died they resumed the same evil practices.

Bruh, depending on who was the caliphate, the Moors were not as glorious as you think.
1335440151263195136 2020-12-06 12:25:17 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Ok, but he also blamed Europeans for Arab practices. Bruh, the Europeans learned racist behavior from Arabs, and not the other way around.
1335439450294382592 2020-12-06 12:22:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter This is where I differ from you.  Their practices have to be encapsulated within racism. They do the bidding and will of white supremest.  Who are racist, so you have to put them in the same pot.
1335438634061877248 2020-12-06 12:19:16 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter I’m talking about Arab mores. They have a practice of being racist towards Black people. Now, the fact that some Black people may consider themselves to be an Arab is irrelevant to the fact that Arab culture and mores has shown to be bias and racist towards Black people.
1335437919373438980 2020-12-06 12:16:25 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter It didn’t matter.  She was responding to ridiculous claim by an Arab guy that Arab racism came from Europeans, and that was ridiculous. Did you read the dudes comments, before you decided to question her?
1335437368170606592 2020-12-06 12:14:14 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter You actually believe Black people can not be racist towards other Black people. These people don’t ascribe to the fact that they are Black. Why are you so disjointed, you actually have a phrase for these people, we call them “sellouts”.  Does that phrase ring a bell?
1335436571932286977 2020-12-06 12:11:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Both. There is still slavery in Mauritania, and these people embrace the title of Arab.
1335436107077591040 2020-12-06 12:09:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Clarence Thomas, Candace Owens,  Burgess Owens, Sheriff Clark, I literally can go on and on about Black people who support the white establishment.
1335435271966437376 2020-12-06 12:05:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter You just made her point. Because take out white people and put Arab, and your statement is still true.
1335434605319614465 2020-12-06 12:03:15 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter It still comes down to antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group.
1335434127202541568 2020-12-06 12:01:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter That’s where we differ.  It’s still racism. You simply have puppets supporting the white establishment.
1335433667955597314 2020-12-06 11:59:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter But to your point of clarity, not all these people practice racism. Arabs actually have common practices of racism towards Africans.
1335433374069125121 2020-12-06 11:58:22 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter I’m referring to the white establishment, which happens to include all races who support and continue to perpetuate white supremacy practices and mores.
1335432930383048704 2020-12-06 11:56:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter If we want true clarity, within the discussions of racism, you can’t say white people or use countries to point out racism. We would have to drill down and focus on the individual or institutional racism. That would be true clarity.
1335432114158923777 2020-12-06 11:53:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Bruh, you had an entire war in Sudan, and even to this day Africans are discriminated by Arabs in Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Libya.
1335431686935490561 2020-12-06 11:51:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Well, it was a white Arab blaming Europeans for racism. And she answered correctly that his comments were ridiculous. In all honesty, you have Black Arabs who ride along with white Arabs in discrimination against Africans.
1335430831570030592 2020-12-06 11:48:16 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter That was not the premise of the discussion. And, no they are not the same family. That’s one of the ethnic reasons the EU did not accept Morocco as a member. That’s also why Arabs are discriminated in the US and Europe.
1335429922991575040 2020-12-06 11:44:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Actually, Americans can be racist towards Blacks, because every Black is not American🤦🏿‍♂️
1335429611103133696 2020-12-06 11:43:25 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter So, you want her to say “White Arabs”, but it was a white Arab who tried to blame Europeans for their racism, which is ridiculous.
1335428765346897921 2020-12-06 11:40:03 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter No, it’s an Arab practice that has continued far before the Europeans invaded Africa. Abeed, is a term in Arabic meaning "slaves"
1335426047203020801 2020-12-06 11:29:15 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Arabs are racist towards. You can’t say they’re Middle Eastern, that’s regional. You can’t say they are Muslim, because Islam is a religion. Do you want to just say, “white Arabs”?
1335425325967306753 2020-12-06 11:26:23 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter And you have African Americans who classify themselves as just American, and not black or African.
1335425111260876800 2020-12-06 11:25:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter We talking about Arabs.
1335424953966088192 2020-12-06 11:24:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Arabs are racist...it’s not her that is confusing the issue, it’s you.  So, the current slave trade in Libya is focusing on who? And by whom?  https://t.co/A6ubt3Mu76
1335424181870202882 2020-12-06 11:21:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Their commonly white.
1335424033492529152 2020-12-06 11:21:15 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter No, it started with Arabs.  Arabs were the ones who created the name Kaffir, this term is a derogatory term for Africans in South Africa. They are the ethnic group who displayed the most hate towards Africans and actually started the TransSahara slave trade.
1335422399135748097 2020-12-06 11:14:45 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter Yes they do!  Matter of fact, they praise their fair complexion. And, they speak negatively about dark or black complexion.
1335422066250686465 2020-12-06 11:13:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter No it’s not...Arabs are racist towards Africans. Take a look at every Arab country, the African population are discriminated against, so her narrative is correct.
1335421622371672064 2020-12-06 11:11:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter That’s not what she said. “Blaming anti black racism in the Arab world (Middle East) on white colonizers is actually pathetic” are her exact words. Arabs invaded Africa in 711 A.D., 700 years before Europeans. Bruh, read this:  https://t.co/id9bi72Zq7
1335417500083904512 2020-12-06 10:55:17 +0800 <Shango5T> @_mishamish I have not heard about this...😒

1335371744408969216 2020-12-06 07:53:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter No, she’s not.  I don’t agree with you either.  Why don’t you clarify your point?

1335346300565532687 2020-12-06 06:12:22 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly...if there were mass deaths from Covid in Africa, news reports would spread the information far and wide.  Most AA never believe a liar, which leads me to ask, why do some continue to believe the lies from the white establishment?😒
1335343429052723201 2020-12-06 06:00:57 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly. African Americans are targets of the white establishment lies and propaganda; yet when it comes to Africa and white Jesus they believe every lie spread by the white establishment. Africa is beautiful, but imperfect, just like other continents.✊🏿💯
1335327035233853442 2020-12-06 04:55:49 +0800 <Shango5T> I love this song.  What’s the name of it?
1335326455996305411 2020-12-06 04:53:30 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree wholeheartedly...and he indirectly addressed the ADOS and FBA foolishness. I’m storing this speech and I plan on using his verbiage.  I’m proud to be an AFRICAN✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿💯

1335279389869748227 2020-12-06 01:46:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @kdarknite70 @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I believe instead of looking up, look within. God is never to busy to talk to us, matter of fact, God wants a relationship with us.  The western style of God living in the sky is part of the Greek beliefs of Olympus.
1335268715689074691 2020-12-06 01:04:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly. In March 2008, former French President Jacques Chirac said: “Without Africa, France will slide down into the rank of a third world power”. That also means, if those African countries worked together, they would be amongst the richest in the world.
1335267750630055936 2020-12-06 01:00:14 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯
1335267564583325705 2020-12-06 00:59:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter France’s goal is to make the lives of French citizens lives better, and they have done so by any means necessary.  They includes the sacrifice of African men, women, and children. It past time for Africans to realize this truth.
1335266799735148544 2020-12-06 00:56:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Some African leaders believe leadership is a lottery ticket. They do very few things to make the people they are supposed to serve lives better.
1335266378413182978 2020-12-06 00:54:47 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿👏🏿💯
1335266038498406400 2020-12-06 00:53:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Here’s a question I’d like to pose: would you marry your soulmate who had no affiliation to a religious organization, but still believed, loved, and had faith in God?  Or, would you walk away from the relationship?
1335264278769770499 2020-12-06 00:46:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter That’s sad.  In my opinion, people are being judged on the dogma and practices of organized religion, but not the faith and belief of God. Attachment to a religious title does not bring me closer to God; my faith and belief does.
1335090647833960449 2020-12-05 13:16:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @YsfZak @AishaDaughter That’s exactly what I’m doing - taking a Udemy class.  I also bought a writing book offline, and to Arabic songs to catch onto the fluidity.

1335010775694446603 2020-12-05 07:59:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlogsJay I agree with you.  I started with that idea, but I got a little frustrated because learning a different language that have numerous deviations can be daunting.  But, I’m still struggling along.
1335001421427724289 2020-12-05 07:21:56 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlogsJay Yes, exactly!
1334988856446357513 2020-12-05 06:32:00 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlogsJay @AishaDaughter Ok, cool. I’ll give it a try again. Thanks 👍🏿
1334988320737267718 2020-12-05 06:29:53 +0800 <Shango5T> @gisele4s I think it’s a little bit of everything. Music, how they dress, and the lack of true socialization. We never depended on the Internet to socialize - we did it in person. I think it’s an overall lack of social skills.
1334975974488891400 2020-12-05 05:40:49 +0800 <Shango5T> This is when you know God is not done with you yet.
1334975705231265794 2020-12-05 05:39:45 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlogsJay @AishaDaughter Cool...some people said it’s hard, but maybe it was just them🤷🏿‍♂️.
1334953248164368387 2020-12-05 04:10:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I was told if I immerse myself in the language I’ll learn it faster, which is not true, because there are literally different forms of Arabic😒.  Africans who know Arabic and English are phenomenal, because these have to be two of the hardest languages in the world to learn.🙏🏿

1334715544688336896 2020-12-04 12:25:58 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter The Congo should be the Dubai of Africa, but the West causes chaos by arming militias, propping up puppet government officials, and causing instabilities that the people stay in a constant state of disarray.
1334714449291341824 2020-12-04 12:21:37 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...there’s an economist group that I recently viewed on Twitter that stated, some western countries viability is predicated on Africans remaining poor. One country in particular that was mentioned is France. Which didn’t surprise me.
1334713085190397953 2020-12-04 12:16:11 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter It’s more ethnocentric than racist. Numerous government ideas in the west were birthed from other societies, and some stemmed from Africans.  For example: Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers are architects of numerous government institutions and civil rights.
1334711103276912640 2020-12-04 12:08:19 +0800 <Shango5T> I see your point, yet, there are few ideas regarding government, property, civil rights, and human rights that the west did get right. I’m a true believer that a good idea is good no matter who devised it. For example: Separation of church and state.

1334615226105425921 2020-12-04 05:47:20 +0800 <Shango5T> @TyroneDHarris That logic must stem from the white establishment’s psychosis.
1334610454182768642 2020-12-04 05:28:22 +0800 <Shango5T> This brother was deep!
1334607448397783042 2020-12-04 05:16:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @ThatoHlalele4 Thank you 🙏🏿.  I just subscribed to the channel.
1334603960750120962 2020-12-04 05:02:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @eyetweetkinda @FACTUALOPINION0 Since the invasion and colonization of Africa by Europeans; Europeans have been able to control Africa’s economic future.  Most of which has been fraught with poverty, death, terrorism, and racism.  However, if African countries are tactical, they can begin to take back control.
1334602572066414596 2020-12-04 04:57:03 +0800 <Shango5T> Keep this in mind when someone from the white establishment tries to con you about introducing religion to the Black/African masses.  https://t.co/ok5M6I6H19
1334601588174938113 2020-12-04 04:53:08 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly💯
1334601432088113181 2020-12-04 04:52:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I would say, no. A good way to gauge is to observe the indoctrination process - schools. Most have uniforms that are similar to uniforms in England. Better yet, here’s a picture of Nigeria’s legal attire:🙄  https://t.co/c5i2RhXzuV
1334599650649763841 2020-12-04 04:45:27 +0800 <Shango5T> But no prison time...😧.  If the roles were reversed, you can rest assured that brother would’ve spent decades in a Chinese prison.
1334599007440674816 2020-12-04 04:42:53 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...💯
1334582212428255233 2020-12-04 03:36:09 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...the same strategy continues to be employed - Divide and Conquer. And it’s just not the borders that divide Africans, it’s division of ethnicities and within ethnicities; it’s division of religions, and within religions. It’s division of all sorts
1334560726145511425 2020-12-04 02:10:46 +0800 <Shango5T> Unfortunately, I agree wholeheartedly.  And I call it conformity. Africans, worldwide have concluded that progress equates to being western.
1334559017788698624 2020-12-04 02:03:59 +0800 <Shango5T> Damn...that’s like a big stop 🛑 sign.

1334278648178888706 2020-12-03 07:29:54 +0800 <Shango5T> I don’t have a problem with him getting hot and heavy with his girlfriend. My objection resides with him being in a cotton field, holding a piece of cotton, while he’s smooching with his white girlfriend. The cotton fields were a place of torment for African Americans.

1334258023230025728 2020-12-03 06:07:56 +0800 <Shango5T> That image sickens me. That visual aid assist in brainwashing. The biggest that I have with this carved image, African/Black kids see it and internalize this bs.
1334257415215345666 2020-12-03 06:05:31 +0800 <Shango5T> I would make a joke, but it’ll  probably get me into trouble...😂😂😂.  So I’ll give a serious answer; any man who believes that is not worth the trouble or time of getting to know.  Life is too short, find someone who supports your ambitions, respects you, and makes you laugh.💯
1334223134078234628 2020-12-03 03:49:18 +0800 <Shango5T> Ok...I have a project in mind, and I’d like to work with you. Are you interested?  It involves creating Nubian children’s books.
1334185699692703746 2020-12-03 01:20:33 +0800 <Shango5T> Back at you, Bruh✊🏿💯.  Keep spreading knowledge!

1334181748603805697 2020-12-03 01:04:51 +0800 <Shango5T> Cops are idiots...they can’t recognize a person who is in mental distress.
1334175089554837507 2020-12-03 00:38:23 +0800 <Shango5T> @HatimAlTai2 This is fantastic!!! You should consider writing a book, or do you think it’s possible for you to make a YouTube or Podcast?
1334164656437538817 2020-12-02 23:56:56 +0800 <Shango5T> Anyone who believes Africans can’t solve their own problems are either brainwashed or insane.  The real problem stems from influences and interference from outside of the continent. Like France targeting African leaders who don’t tow the colonialist line.
1334162366699859972 2020-12-02 23:47:50 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿👏🏿
1334162236491902976 2020-12-02 23:47:19 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...however, the manner in which SOME of the food is cooked has to change. Greens can be cooked with smoked turkey legs, as opposed to pork. Eliminate all animal fat. You can also cook greens in vegetable broth, for vegetarians👋🏿

1333935933373210628 2020-12-02 08:48:04 +0800 <Shango5T> That’s the epitome of craziness...
1333928867866742792 2020-12-02 08:19:59 +0800 <Shango5T> @afrikan1884 @AishaDaughter @MrChuckD @vudzijenaj I definitely will register to join the webinar.
1333928494242394117 2020-12-02 08:18:30 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly!!
1333906584490172417 2020-12-02 06:51:27 +0800 <Shango5T> Exactly👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯
1333900598555652101 2020-12-02 06:27:40 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯
1333886948738478084 2020-12-02 05:33:25 +0800 <Shango5T> The natural resources are all located on one continent - Africa.  The population and demand is there. Why haven’t Africans created a true manufacturing sector.  Every industrialized country in the planet has one.
1333886946624540674 2020-12-02 05:33:25 +0800 <Shango5T> Africans need to politically grow up. It amazes me, while Asian countries have the Trans-Pacific Partnership, African countries literally have no trading block, that is not sanctioned by Europeans. That’s demeaning, especially considering the Incredible possibilities.
1333884670212153344 2020-12-02 05:24:22 +0800 <Shango5T> That’s sort of hard to say, because some countries, like Ghana, Botswana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Algeria, and several others, yes, but most, no. You can identify the ones that don’t, because their economic and political base are still rooted in colonialism, for example, Nigeria.
1333870288140955649 2020-12-02 04:27:13 +0800 <Shango5T> Are you referring to African Agency in international government or economics?

With this global economy, Africa has tremendous leverage.

1333820998039334918 2020-12-02 01:11:21 +0800 <Shango5T> Good point...👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯
1333820747207348227 2020-12-02 01:10:21 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...demanding justice should not be a right only for the white establishment, or Europeans.
1333814247336325122 2020-12-02 00:44:32 +0800 <Shango5T> The biggest problem, African countries don’t work together. The entire planet depends on African natural resources. For example, the sand in Africa, not the Sahara sand, is used to build cement. Every country on the planet needs cement. But, African countries don’t work together.
1333605287761240065 2020-12-01 10:54:12 +0800 <Shango5T> @DJGreenVillain I’m glad this brother drew a line in the sand...💯💯💯✊🏿

1333480523780542464 2020-12-01 02:38:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @TheFactTruthful Oh, I apologize🙏🏿. I misunderstood you.

1333432443270017027 2020-11-30 23:27:23 +0800 <Shango5T> @TheFactTruthful Do you really have to be directly from a specific region in Africa in order to support Africans or African history. The British aren’t from Greece or Rome, yet they intellectually and physically support them.
1333431523320733696 2020-11-30 23:23:43 +0800 <Shango5T> In my opinion, most suffer from a deficiency of self-love. Will Smith once stated, “You can not win the war against the world, if you can’t win the war against your own mind”.

1333239125990928384 2020-11-30 10:39:12 +0800 <Shango5T> In my opinion, he was little bit of both. And that’s a totally different conversation.
1333208883440070658 2020-11-30 08:39:02 +0800 <Shango5T> Yeah...you won’t see this when they talk about the continent of Africa.  https://t.co/V5PM5vRcw8
1333208138363891712 2020-11-30 08:36:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @adamhudson5 Yes sir...💯😂

1333206062565093377 2020-11-30 08:27:49 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly.
1333206013055528960 2020-11-30 08:27:37 +0800 <Shango5T> Especially considering Africa has all of the natural resources, but are conforming to the languages of outsiders, such as, English, Arab, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish.
1333202683063316482 2020-11-30 08:14:24 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree wholeheartedly...👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿. That includes sports, academics, politics, jobs, and sooooo much more.
1333200644933554176 2020-11-30 08:06:18 +0800 <Shango5T> Bruh, if you ever get a chance read or listen to the audible book: Hitler’s American Model and The Myth of Race. They truly enlightened me.😒
1333184790506467330 2020-11-30 07:03:18 +0800 <Shango5T> Experience experience experience...there is no substitute for experience. He’s winging punches. I know a lightweight who will put him on his ass.😂😂
1333183623386853377 2020-11-30 06:58:39 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly. And I would add, there are Africans in the diaspora who want to learn different African ethnic languages. However, 99.999% of apps don’t offer African languages, and you can forget about a college or University teaching any - except Arabic.
1333165851298631683 2020-11-30 05:48:02 +0800 <Shango5T> Exactly! In addition, the world justifiably condemns Hitler, but is silent about the countries that inspired and taught the 3rd Reich, which was the United States, England, and France.

1332869726406635520 2020-11-29 10:11:20 +0800 <Shango5T> White South Africans are thee most racist, ignorant, and delusional people on the planet. England allowed that infestation to grow in Africa.
1332869067871543296 2020-11-29 10:08:43 +0800 <Shango5T> So basically the entire existence of human beings were African/Black until very recently.  https://t.co/0HlhFEOl7L
1332857847680471041 2020-11-29 09:24:08 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...and I wish that was different. I wish we celebrated our African culture and history more.

1332759926654062596 2020-11-29 02:55:02 +0800 <Shango5T> Professor says British Empire was worse than Nazis and slams white 'psychosis' | Metro News(This is💯percent true. The white establishment obliterated entire ethnic groups and put Africans, Irish, and Scottish in concentration camps before the Nazis)  https://t.co/WaCWQkQuY7
1332757389817376770 2020-11-29 02:44:57 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly!! Their caste system is defined by hues of color; with white being the top and black being the bottom. However, we need to be intellectually and emotionally astute enough to recognize their white psychosis. This is their mental illness, not ours.
1332755195881807880 2020-11-29 02:36:14 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly!!!
1332751082523652098 2020-11-29 02:19:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye You’re missing the point; these names are NOT us. It’s a persona meant to dehumanize and make us dependent on others. SOME of us have internalized these names; it’s etched into their psyche.  So much so, that they believe the white establishment are Africans saviors.
1332749613036605441 2020-11-29 02:14:03 +0800 <Shango5T> This used to be a vibrant country, and now it’s just another 3rd country in Africa.
1332742141039226885 2020-11-29 01:44:22 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...it’s one thing if the white establishment believes the nonsense, but it becomes fatally damning if we start to believe the dogma ourselves. One cannot even try to fight back, if you’ve already mentally decided you’ve lost.
1332734913204858882 2020-11-29 01:15:38 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly.  And that’s the problem; through one way or another, the white establishment’s narrative of Africans is constantly on repeat. Never mind the fact that 99.9% is false, because no group is perfect. We need to spread OUR narrative. Tell OUR stories.

1332704303941873665 2020-11-28 23:14:01 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni It’s too early in the game to say I told you so; you might want to give it a little bit more time😂😂
1332703685344964609 2020-11-28 23:11:33 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯
1332702979628158979 2020-11-28 23:08:45 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree wholeheartedly...for far to long Africans worldwide have accepted the blanket narrative of the white establishment. Too many believe we were nothing before the invasion of Europeans. We forget that we built civilizations, and the Europeans stole; they didn’t build.
1332701866749284355 2020-11-28 23:04:20 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
1332701617372733441 2020-11-28 23:03:20 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly. And, I believe we’ve lost who we are. We let others tell us who we are. “Names have significance. They have power. They define us. They’re more than a bunch of letters.” What name do we Africans accept? The “N” word, abeed?  We are so much more.
1332500330202935297 2020-11-28 09:43:30 +0800 <Shango5T> This is why the Boars keep killing South Africans...their legal system allows them to murder Africans with impunity.

1332007869856817153 2020-11-27 01:06:38 +0800 <Shango5T> Tariq is an agent for the white establishment. He was uses ghetto-logic to persuade uneducated, emotionally damaged African/Black people.  Real soon, he’ll be asking them to donate to another one of his hustles.
1331770218167885824 2020-11-26 09:22:17 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I think people wanted Obama to  openly say, “this is for black people”. But in the United States, that would be the kiss of death. And for 6 out 8 years, Obama had a Republican Senate and Congress. I think a lot of his social justice activities were for Black people, and others.

Some of the sources of the information comes from Belgians, I’d prefer an unbiased source. Personally, I’m going to wait for the defense to present their case. I need to hear both sides.

1331668851474436098 2020-11-26 02:39:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @savage__diamond I wonder if we can appropriate the phrase, punk-ass bitch for Arab?
1331558360244744192 2020-11-25 19:20:26 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly✊🏿💯✊🏿
1331556921200041984 2020-11-25 19:14:43 +0800 <Shango5T> England and the US left these invading terrorist in charge.
1331446486186528770 2020-11-25 11:55:54 +0800 <Shango5T> The Boars should have been arrested and put in prison. But Mandela made an agreement with England and the US that the vile barbarians would escape punishment and retain their positions, and wealth.
1331357933570056199 2020-11-25 06:04:01 +0800 <Shango5T> @Esqincharge I agree with you wholeheartedly!!
1331356712792698881 2020-11-25 05:59:10 +0800 <Shango5T> The graven image of the white Jesus is one of the greatest hustle of the existence of human beings. The white establishment literally painted a picture of Caesar Borgia, spread the word that this is God, and tortured everyone who disagreed. The greatest brainwashing to date.
1331353703480250370 2020-11-25 05:47:12 +0800 <Shango5T> @1rudeCruzan Personally, I think they were being paid by the alt-right white supremest. Any group that  would name themselves “slave”, there is a serious psychological problem
1331352558812753922 2020-11-25 05:42:40 +0800 <Shango5T> And South Africans received no justice, because the United States and England.

A teacher can broaden the horizons, or dampen the spirit and quest for knowledge for students. I had more of the latter. However, I made up for it when I got older.
1330937354970927106 2020-11-24 02:12:47 +0800 <Shango5T> @TriteTrite @BruceTh39654475 I agree with you, there are a ton of great African hero stories. However, they rarely get any focus. For example, there are great stories about the Nubians, but you never see those stories at the movie theater, and you have to do some leg work to find great books about them.

Heck, there are a lot of adults who don’t know about Memnon. So, I’m writing a script about him. I think he asked, because he’s interested in the story.

So, let’s see where this investigation goes.

1330654127588773896 2020-11-23 07:27:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter So now the ICC is not reputable?😉Then what impartial institutions do you accept?
1330653711102861318 2020-11-23 07:25:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter No, you’ve presented opinionated pieces and an opinionated book. I consider evidence from impartial reputable institutions, professors, eye witnesses. Or people who were present when he given information and he gave the order to murder innocent people.
1330652858992222210 2020-11-23 07:22:18 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Good.  That would mean, if what you’ve stated about Paul Kagame is correct, he should be next. Once the ICC has indicated him, my opinion will immediately change. Even if the ICC states they have evidence against Kagame, again, my opinion will immediately change.
1330652002351804422 2020-11-23 07:18:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter I know it was Belgium.  But France was the super power who stated Africa has too many people, so the death of Rwandans was not a lose. That remark got my attention.
1330651411315568641 2020-11-23 07:16:33 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter An academic conversation includes an investigation and verified documents from a reputable body. Unless we have that data, everything else is speculation or someone’s opinion. To use an analogy; it becomes a hunt for Big Foot. Are we simply looking for articles of opinion?
1330650026515849221 2020-11-23 07:11:03 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter That’s a book.  Where are the charges from the ICC?
1330649802401591304 2020-11-23 07:10:09 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Bruh, this is going nowhere. France lost one of its colonies, and they went on a propaganda blitz in order to discredit Paul Kagame.  I agree that innocent people are killed during wars, and that’s awful.
1330649068343791618 2020-11-23 07:07:14 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter If you hate war, I respect that. I’ve been a soldier and I know how ugly war can be. Singling out one person, unless charged by the ICC or dishonorably discharged, is hypocrisy. If you are anti-war, I respect that.
1330644389853601793 2020-11-23 06:48:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Listen...this conversation is going no where.  You’re entitled to your opinion. We can respectfully agree to disagree.
1330644077705105414 2020-11-23 06:47:24 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Documented...or a written opinion based on someone else’s beliefs. Because IF, it were true, why hasn’t he been arrested, just like all other war criminals, and prosecuted for crimes against humanity?  I’ll tell you why...because it’s propaganda spread by France. That’s why.

1330608656510017537 2020-11-23 04:26:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter That’s supposition...you literally have no evidence to prove that nonsense. I’ll give you that war was brutal and innocent people were caught in the middle, but don’t add falsehoods to it.
1330602410583203842 2020-11-23 04:01:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Words cannot express my heartfelt condolences...🙏🏿

Yet, Africans continue to fight proxy wars for the west.
1330594579444346884 2020-11-23 03:30:43 +0800 <Shango5T> @bigfemto @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter First, you can’t blame Paul Kagame for the barbaric behavior of some troops. War is nasty and brutal. Civilians routinely get caught in the middle of it. The average person pays the price for the desires of the elite.
1330593270141956097 2020-11-23 03:25:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @BeeNubian I agree with you wholeheartedly!!💯

I can never take your comments serious when you cherry-pick.

It’s pretentious to suggest Kagame started the conflict. France ignited the flames.  I don’t applaud the war.  I applaud how he brought Rwanda from a point of despair and poverty to the point it is today.
1330369365624152064 2020-11-22 12:35:48 +0800 <Shango5T> Congratulations 🎈🎉🎊 😃😃
1330368979903406084 2020-11-22 12:34:16 +0800 <Shango5T> This was just ghoulishly evil.
1330368794800304133 2020-11-22 12:33:32 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree wholeheartedly, and I would add builder: build relationships, build communities, and build up people.

1330357660064112645 2020-11-22 11:49:17 +0800 <Shango5T> The injustices of a white jury and the outcome of the white establishment’s justice system.  Which begs the question, why do some African/Black value their word more valued than our own?
1330351269962272777 2020-11-22 11:23:54 +0800 <Shango5T> Just like how Trump can nominate and the Senate will pass an unqualified person.  For the white establishment, and Asian countries; the only qualification necessarily is being white.

1330314404051767297 2020-11-22 08:57:24 +0800 <Shango5T> That makes two of us.  I think that’s why I own so many books.

1330266304478138375 2020-11-22 05:46:16 +0800 <Shango5T> @stillhussling @Cru3Grand Oh, I don’t give a damn about acceptance fro anyone😂😂😂. Begging people to like me is not part of my character🧐. I simply share some historical and biological facts.

The same with conversations about Egypt, they get heated. When I see the conversation is going in circles, I’ll state, “let’s agree to respectfully disagree with one another.”
1330249764772909058 2020-11-22 04:40:33 +0800 <Shango5T> @OlugbengaBlacks @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Yeah, I agree.  Sometimes it’s best to add your two cents and walk away. If we’re both yelling and neither one of us is listening; the conversation is useless.

Personally, I like Paul Kagame, and I’m quite sure you’ve read some negative comments about him. People have gotten angry at me, because I can look him from a detached perspective.

I’m quite sure when you and I leave this planet there will be people who mourn us. However, there probably will be people who may have some negative things to say. Well, at least, they probably will about me😂😂

He helped to kill Gaddafi, which was ghoulish and  eff’ed up. And, I saw an interview which he admitted as much. He said he was trying to help Tony Blair (England), which didn’t surprise me.

But @AishaDaughter and others have direct experiences. Just because their families have those experiences, it still shouldn’t dim your light on Muammar Gaddafi’s achievements.

He had the CIA, MI6, Mossad, and a whole host of agencies gunning for him. That’s probably why he had to make decisions that were a little dicey.

You have some people who love Obama, some hate him, and some are in between. One of my heroes is Malcolm X, but Malcolm was not perfect.  And I’m cool with that, because being seen as perfect puts too much weight on his shoulders.

Muammar Gaddafi actions and the factions ,who control parts of Libya, actions are both grotesque. The one exception, Muammar Gaddafi was in charge for 42 years, and I guarantee you he would tell you himself he made mistakes.
1330228758326939657 2020-11-22 03:17:05 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @laafiaammaa @AishaDaughter @libya644 Bruh, we agree that Muammar Gaddafi death was the act of his enemy. That power vacuum has imperiled Libya, and opened the country up to marauders.  That being stated, that doesn’t mean he didn’t treat other African ethnic groups with the level of human dignity they deserved
1330227875333746689 2020-11-22 03:13:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter I thought you said he was in charge for 42 years?  Why did you change? I acquiesced on the years, there was no need to change. Again, as a leader in charge of a country for 42 years, he did better than MOST African leaders, buuuut he also made grievous errors.
1330226996803235841 2020-11-22 03:10:05 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter If I ever told you Muammar Gaddafi didn’t do great things I would be lying. But for you to deny the facts that he did not treat all Africans with the same type reverence is disingenuous.
1330226480610209794 2020-11-22 03:08:02 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter If I cared to do the research, probably a lot.  And I guarantee those leaders were not perfect leaders or perfect people. 42 years in power is a long time to be perfect in a imperfect world.
1330225819311087618 2020-11-22 03:05:24 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Listen, maybe Muammar Gaddafi was a perfect fit for Libya, but he was not a perfect man. He made political mistakes. He made personal mistakes. To cast him as perfect, I think you’re making a mistake. You can appreciate a leaders, and all their shortcomings. It makes them human.
1330224711964520450 2020-11-22 03:01:00 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter Ok...42 years and no one else wanted to lead?  Everyone wanted to make him President for life?!  So, what type of political system was Libya?
1330223412049047553 2020-11-22 02:55:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion No...you can have your own opinion, but you can’t have your own set of facts. You and her disagree on Muammar Gaddafi. You had a positive experience with him, but her family had a different experience. That’s normal. Both experiences can be true, without negating the other.

1330222057821528065 2020-11-22 02:50:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @laafiaammaa @AishaDaughter @libya644 Come on...gullible. Muammar Gaddafi was in charge for 32 years, and he made no mistakes and he didn’t alienate anyone?  No one?!  He vacillated between being an Arab and being African.  And proving yourself to be Arab meant he had to treat non-Arabs like shit.
1330219877995601931 2020-11-22 02:41:47 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @laafiaammaa @AishaDaughter @libya644 Bruh, you literally had a civil war.  I can see if you simply had a few agitators, but there were thousands, upon thousands.

1330219088837300236 2020-11-22 02:38:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @desert____lion @libya644 @AishaDaughter He was in charge of a country for 32 years...so what type of political system allows a person to remain in power for 32 yrs? His opponents were put in jail, and there was no freedom of the press. Was Gaddafi ever criticized by the press?
1330212026111627270 2020-11-22 02:10:35 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly.  African/Black people have a plethora of fabulous cultural, language, history, folklores, traditions, and so much more. We need to leave the phenotype discussions in the backyard of Europeans.

However, Muammar Gaddafi made mistakes on how he wanted to be seen, who he trusted, and how he treated other indigenous Africans. Granted, it’s easy for me to criticize.  The world was crazy during his time.  It would’ve made me paranoid.😂

I respect other people’s opinions about historical events, but that doesn’t change historical facts. @AishaDaughter comments are based on personal experience and documented events. Muammar Gaddafi was a dictator - prove me wrong 😑.
1330164640056225792 2020-11-21 23:02:18 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly. I don’t believe African/Black people have allies. There are a litany of other ethnicities who run to African/Black people when they run into hard times, but are quick to rebuff us when those hard times pass, and drop us like a bad habit.

1330151092932513795 2020-11-21 22:08:28 +0800 <Shango5T> Britain’s practice of brutality, murder and thievery throughout the world led to the misbegotten beliefs that land and property of indigenous people was theirs to do what they please, so they sold Palestinian land.

1329916106698616832 2020-11-21 06:34:43 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Just based on what I’ve read from some Nubians online, and this is my novice opinion, I think Nubians need an influential leader or leaders. Nubians have the wherewithal, but need a spark. This is just my observation; you guys can tell me to stay in my lane and I’d respect that.

However, I peaked at his profile, and while most Hotep believers are spiritual, there are a few that are part of a fringe group who are extremist. Granted, I did lump all of Hoteps together, that was an error on my part.

1328037950123335685 2020-11-16 02:11:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @NyabinghiD Gotcha...I never factored in corruption.  Nor did I factor in the influence England has on South Africa. Both a very troubling.  To that end, I agree; more time and more work is needed.

Some of these Africans tried to open businesses and offer opportunities to SA

1328020068840714244 2020-11-16 01:00:32 +0800 <Shango5T> 👏🏿👏🏿💯I agree with you wholeheartedly. We need leadership who has the knowledge of African capabilities and are willing to try to rebuild an African society. Africans were able to build, grow, and trade for eons, yet still remain being African - that ability still exist.
1328017728804958210 2020-11-16 00:51:14 +0800 <Shango5T> Europeans frequently revisits the falsehood they were innocent bystanders in the Transatlantic slave trade. While I do agree slavery existed throughout the planet, every person is responsible on how those people are treated. The white establishment actions were ghoulishly evil.

1328004312971292679 2020-11-15 23:57:55 +0800 <Shango5T> @NyabinghiD In addition, you can not compare the era of Jim Crow with the era of post-apartheid. Those two eras are as different as night and day.
1328003558541692930 2020-11-15 23:54:56 +0800 <Shango5T> @NyabinghiD No they didn’t. Reconstruction lasted from (1865-1877) during that time African Americans grew in power, then whites stopped it, and terrorism started. African Americans never occupied the seat of the President, nor control the military. These variables are completely different.
1327840827381600257 2020-11-15 13:08:17 +0800 <Shango5T> Exactly...they rebranded themselves
1327838509965701120 2020-11-15 12:59:05 +0800 <Shango5T> Exactly.  They want to keep lying to African that they are their brothers, and not reveal their true self.

But, African Americans didn’t control the government, and live on a continent full of other Africans.

1327679083359199232 2020-11-15 02:25:35 +0800 <Shango5T> I keep telling Africans in the diaspora that the white establishment are not grievous about slavery nor colonialism. Reparations translate into a feeling on injustice on the victims by the perpetrators.

You even had Africans from other parts of Africa in Rome and Greece. The Greeks visited Ethiopia and Punt quite often. And Nubians fought in for other Kingdoms.

Egypt’s Coptic period—also called Egypt’s Christian period—lasted 500 years, from the fourth century to the ninth century C.E., when the majority of Egypt’s population was Christian.

No other African country has been occupied by so many European or Arab countries ever.

Coptic is an admixture of Indigenous and Greek.  Thus the reason I mention the Greeks and the Hellenistic time period.

The Nile flows through eleven different countries – Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan , Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda; this was the Nile Valley Civilization. Not Greece😂

All of their relationships were African. Your Greek ancestors were not there. The Nile Valley Civilization includes 11 countries, none of them are European or Arab.  https://t.co/cZkqeMiucZ
1327286300219682820 2020-11-14 00:24:48 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly. I noticed SOME Africans want to be Arab because they believe it makes them a better Muslim. The same for Africans who are Christians; they believe embracing being European makes them better Christians. However, for God, none of that is necessary.

Coptic came during the Hellenistic period during the Middle Kingdom. Narmer was during the first kingdom, which the Coptics were not apart of, so why should what Narmer look like matter to you?

Egypt was called Kemet.  The Nubians and the Kushites are the same people.  Let’s be honest , we’re discussing mere semantics.

So far, you’ve discounted the Hebrews, and don’t believe the Greeks - Strabo. Every source, that existed during that time, which describes Taharqa differently than your account you ignore.

Taharqa, also called Tirhaka, (flourished 7th century bce), fourth king (reigned 690–664 bce) of the 25th dynasty.

They tried to assassinate him several times. Taharqa didn’t know the depth of the conspiracy, and the area was not worth the continued investment. He simply moved on.

We both know that source was written by his enemy, and that enemy likely exaggerated. Personally I believe, although he won, Esarhaddon lied A LOT! 😂 As always, history is written by the victor.😒

1326182232927719424 2020-11-10 23:17:38 +0800 <Shango5T> @KSageforHouston Thank you for the compliment of my page. I love my people more than you can imagine. And to honest, I give all African/Black people the benefit of the doubt, until they give me a reason to doubt them. Just give her an opportunity, actions speak louder than words.
1326181374013923328 2020-11-10 23:14:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @KSageforHouston Yeah, but how many of those people join a historically black sorority? This is the same woman who exclusively dated black men, but ended up marrying a white guy, just like Janet Jackson, Serena Williams, Eve, and Viola Davis. And in her biography she stated she was AA.
1326180460318388225 2020-11-10 23:10:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @KSageforHouston In her biography she said she was African American.  I’ve seen her in interviews where she said she was African American.  The only people who keep saying she’s not are SOME black people on Twitter.
1326179042958204928 2020-11-10 23:04:57 +0800 <Shango5T> @KSageforHouston You’re entitled to your opinion. You’re just not entitled to define other people, because that’s a personal choice.

1325916316239237120 2020-11-10 05:40:58 +0800 <Shango5T> @MichaelBensonn Wilder is looking for someone to blame for his loss; maybe he should listen to the experts who say he needs to improve his basics. Everyone on the planet knew he depends on one punch 🥊. The law of averages simply caught up with him. He should get therapy and go back to the gym.
1325914675230420992 2020-11-10 05:34:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye Good point.
1325911797187096577 2020-11-10 05:23:01 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye European American is for the British. But I do get your point.
1325911387357507587 2020-11-10 05:21:23 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye America celebrates St.Patrick Day for Irish Americans.  We have sections of towns for Italian Americans. We have China Town for Chinese Americans. The Indigenous are called Native Americans. We have places for Jewish Americans. And we celebrate Oktoberfest for German Americans.
1325910273623007232 2020-11-10 05:16:58 +0800 <Shango5T> That’s what I call true brainwashing...the white establishment has spread their narrative about Africa and Africans.  I think that’s insulting that Africans have to get European’s validation to be who they are.😒
1325895108844204035 2020-11-10 04:16:42 +0800 <Shango5T> @RasThaFarEye I’m good with the identification of African American, most of us don’t know which ethnicity they are from.  They did the same for Latino, Asian, and Native American.

That being stated, shouldn’t he be training harder and smarter? His lack of basic skills as a fighter have been called out by every reputable boxer. Also, ask him if he is suffering from depression.
1325803216651636741 2020-11-09 22:11:33 +0800 <Shango5T> @Msigi_Emotion @Ndele43 I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Some one should have beat their ass a long time ago.
1325802446187327489 2020-11-09 22:08:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlackCulture_HM You should have brought fighters.

1325800987681042433 2020-11-09 22:02:42 +0800 <Shango5T> @AmsaluJoshua I agree wholeheartedly.  This movie is part of the white supremest propaganda ploy to demean Africans, African culture and African history; while spreading the f’cked up bullshit narrative of the might and greatness of the white man. Just like you, I viscerally hate this movie.
1325798966550818818 2020-11-09 21:54:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @AmsaluJoshua @Power2ThePeopIe I don’t know if that’s true. She went to a historically African American college and joined a historically African American sorority and here is her family. They look African American to me.  https://t.co/PRBSgTaIrq

1325700868549828608 2020-11-09 15:24:52 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence And my point is that she is on par with Stacey Abrams and Michelle Obama, who worked their ass off to get where they are today.  These ladies did not come from a rich family. They came from regular struggling middle class families.

Your entire narrative is exaggerated. She lived the high life...😂😂😂😂. Bruh, you’re hilarious. I literally could make the same argument about Tupac, who went to Juilliard. You’re making up bs.
1325630078475259909 2020-11-09 10:43:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence The only you proved was that you’re willing to spread misinformation.  You do realize she has a biography. I mean, she has classmates from Oakland, and the school was predominantly AA.  https://t.co/U6eytfebW1

1325623838483357696 2020-11-09 10:18:46 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence Sarcasm...😂😂😂.  You do know you can have parents who are professional and still not be elite or rich, right?
1325623476485500928 2020-11-09 10:17:20 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence If the technology existed during their life time they could have one. Anyone can create a Wikipedia page. Matter of fact, you can create one for anyone in your family, right now😂😂.  More than likely, Kamala lived paycheck to paycheck life style; just like most people.

1325620675659390976 2020-11-09 10:06:12 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence I can only rely on the Internet.  Just like you. And considering I know a little bit about Indian culture, the day her mother married her father, was the day she was a probably banished from her family. And in India, even government officials aren’t necessarily rich.
1325619740803559424 2020-11-09 10:02:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence Whatever...don’t expect to spew out falsehoods and have someone challenge the validity of your comments.

The house I grew in looked better and I can tell I didn’t live a privileged life.  https://t.co/HUvbRfy9r0
1325616279282200578 2020-11-09 09:48:44 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence There are levels of poverty and there are levels of living a middle class life.  My father made very good money when I was growing up, but we were far from well off.
1325615866592047104 2020-11-09 09:47:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence Truth. My point is you should tell the truth. You are making so many assumptions. What’s your source. The mother and father divorced, and, basically, a single mother raised two kids. That sounds difficult.
1325610504371527681 2020-11-09 09:25:47 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence I have relatives who are educated and they have great jobs, but they are far far far from privileged. Did she live in extreme poverty - no. That doesn’t mean you’re living a golden life.
1325609794485571585 2020-11-09 09:22:58 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence A home in the poorest part in Compton cost $200,000 dollars. But that’s the cost of living in California. You’re still poor. That doesn’t make you privileged. You’re still very very poor. An apartment in New York can be $2000 per month, and that apartment will be in the ghetto.
1325596136971923456 2020-11-09 08:28:42 +0800 <Shango5T> @Backto_Afrika @Essence Have you ever lived in Oakland, Ca? She did not live a life of privilege. Let’s be a little honest.  Her father was a professor and her mother was a biologist. These professions don’t put you in elite status, maybe middle class. This is the house she grew up in:  https://t.co/fNny6ce9n0

1325580301561700358 2020-11-09 07:25:46 +0800 <Shango5T> @AfroN8V @Power2ThePeopIe That’s when they asked her about a black agenda.  Sorry, but answering that question with an affirmative, yes - is political suicide. People have to remember we are only 13% of the population. I’ve been able to help a lot more Africans by not telegraphing my moves.

1325530836733751296 2020-11-09 04:09:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @AfroN8V @Power2ThePeopIe He disowned her stereotyping of Jamaicans. I watched her interview, she was trying too hard to prove she was Black. That’s because so many people can’t saying she not. We shouldn’t have a litmus test that forces people to embarrass themselves to be accepted.
1325529920848744453 2020-11-09 04:05:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @makeAmosProud @AfroN8V Ok.  I don’t do that.  There are too many Uncle Tom’s who both parents were African, and who fought against African liberation for me go along with that thought process.  Candace Owens comes to mind.
1325529391472979968 2020-11-09 04:03:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @makeAmosProud @AfroN8V However, Barack Obama states he’s African American. The same is true for Kamala Harris. If a person is 1% African, I get your point, but when a person has one parent who is African, and they have a history of being Black, I follow the philosophy, “if it looks like a duck”
1325527844932431878 2020-11-09 03:57:20 +0800 <Shango5T> @AfroN8V @Power2ThePeopIe I try to get information from the horses mouth.  Here are her books:  https://t.co/DdBzNFaDbC

You people are the true superheroes 🦸🏿‍♂️.  However, during the Haitian Revolution, you had some brothers and sisters would fought for Haitian liberation.
1325525040444608517 2020-11-09 03:46:11 +0800 <Shango5T> @makeAmosProud I disagree with you - emphatically. These people fought for the rights, lives, and viability of African Americans. To discount them as AA would be criminal. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. The litmus test on who is African/Black shouldn’t be impulsive or cavalier
1325524279853801481 2020-11-09 03:43:10 +0800 <Shango5T> @AfroN8V @Power2ThePeopIe Good point on Malcolm X.  However, Frederick Douglass did. I’m not saying I don’t have some reservations. Yet, I can only go on her actions. I try not to be a hypocrite and misogynistic. It just seemed disingenuous to celebrate Frederick Douglass and reject Kamala Harris.

And if who we date disqualifies you from being African American, we can start with Frederick Douglass, Harry Belafonte, Sydney Poitier, Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, even Malcolm X.
1325516940480278530 2020-11-09 03:14:00 +0800 <Shango5T> @Power2ThePeopIe My grand father looked white.  He had pale skin, straight hair, green eyes, and he was very Afrocentric. My great grandfather was white. If I eliminate her as an African American, I would have to eliminate myself.
1325515941032177665 2020-11-09 03:10:01 +0800 <Shango5T> @AfroN8V @Power2ThePeopIe I can only go by her actions...she attended a HBCU. Most African Americans avoid HBCU’s in order to go to white institutions. She is a active member of a historically Black sorority. On numerous occasions I have heard her say she is African American. Again, I go by actions.

1325513166709780483 2020-11-09 02:59:00 +0800 <Shango5T> @Power2ThePeopIe She’s mixed, just like 99.9% of the African diaspora.  I consider myself African, from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. However, a DNA test tells me I’m also Scottish, Irish, and Native American. If I didn’t accept her as African American, I’d be a hypocrite.
1325511484005376001 2020-11-09 02:52:19 +0800 <Shango5T> A stable, democratic, Afrocentric Africa is a boast to the economic well being of the world economy. I hope they see it as I do.
1325511033616801798 2020-11-09 02:50:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @DeepHouseNat7 I’m hoping, based on the competition with China, technology, and the young population of Africa, who uses mobile apps for their information, a Biden/Harris Administration will see Africa’s open markets and see the opportunities.

1324797252133675013 2020-11-07 03:34:13 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree wholeheartedly!
1324795293506953226 2020-11-07 03:26:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @adamhudson5 Using a sports analogy, instead of African women and African men being like Lebron James and Anthony Davis, you have a lot of sisters who look at African me like we’re towel boys. It truly amazes me how SOME African women love to join in on the chorus of denigrating African men
1324783210887348225 2020-11-07 02:38:25 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly👏🏿💯💯💯
1324773652529893376 2020-11-07 02:00:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter To hope that one man had the power to change 400 years of systemic white supremacy is tall order for anyone.  Obama did his best. I challenge anyone to do better.
1324773127147192322 2020-11-07 01:58:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly!
1324770252283125760 2020-11-07 01:46:55 +0800 <Shango5T> Yet, I disagree with the concept that neither Trump or Biden will make a difference. Trump openly advocated bombing the Gerd. He openly dismantled the civil rights department in the US. He openly gave radicals the ok. He openly attacks African women - which is unforgivable to me.
1324768490163765249 2020-11-07 01:39:55 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Only Africans will improve African lives. African civilizations were built on the intelligence and wherewithal of Africans. Europeans are the ones who spread the dogma that Africa’s future is determined by them. As Africans, we should pushback on that line of thought.

However, every movie or cartoon that you watch, or every drawing that shows their narrative, it subliminally changes your subconscious mind. That’s why some people believe North Africa was always inhabited by Arabs instead of the historical fact that Arabs invaded it.

Trump has a family and personal history of discrimination and racism. Through tragedy, Biden, in my opinion, has changed. Trump hasn’t changed and he openly disparages Africa/Black women - which is unforgivable.

1324423368440008707 2020-11-06 02:48:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @Kobibornanew What..?😒 Let me take a step back. So, you and I agree that the white establishment is morally corrupt?

You prefer to bitch about Black problems in Twitter and express ideas, as opposed to having any type of strategy, beyond hoping a professed bigot wins.

African/Black people depended of the information given to them by the white establishment - which was a mistake. As always, Blacks trusted a morally corrupt white establishment. We need power

Personally, I’m tired of Black people who have amnesia concerning that bill. 90% of Black people supported that bill because they tired of crack dealers and crackheads. I was 15 during that period of time, and I lived in the hood.🤦🏿‍♂️

I’m more likely to believe Biden than a habitual liar - Trump. That’s my logic.

I’m tired of protesting, sing old spiritual songs, and begging to be seen as a human being. F**that.

1323268218404900864 2020-11-02 22:18:23 +0800 <Shango5T> @MichaelBensonn @BronzeBomber Someone needs to get to Wilder.  Anthony Joshua didn’t make up excuses, he just picked himself back up and got better. Breland saved him from a worse beating. Whoever is patronizing Wilder, they are doing him a disservice. His career is finished if he can’t get his head together.
1323266480906117121 2020-11-02 22:11:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @Grishamfight He’s looking for excuses.  If he can’t mentally handle losing and trying to get better, his career is finished. I hate to say it, but I think Wilder is done.
1323265479532793857 2020-11-02 22:07:30 +0800 <Shango5T> We, as opposed to just me, have a chance to make a better life for our children. That’s what my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents did. We vote to make life better for the next generation. We don’t give up and let our destiny be determined by someone else.
1323264009336954880 2020-11-02 22:01:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlackVoice4u Besides the fact that African/Black have been hung, beaten, tortured, and put in jail just to have the right to vote?! It should make you question why the white establishment is hellbent on STOPPING you. I’m not leaving my future in the hands of white folks! Neither should you.

1322237791888117760 2020-10-31 02:03:50 +0800 <Shango5T> @bluemiiints I agree with you wholeheartedly.  The government used crack and Black people to fund their covert wars. We need to focus helping our people.  We need to demand that non-violent life time sentences be ended. And we need to demand funding and help for people who need it.
1322236801461923840 2020-10-31 01:59:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @bluemiiints @DGUNZ22 We need to demand the ‘94’ crime bill, and all of its funding for it in local states be abolished. Let’s fight to get rid of all the funding and repeal the law. The white establishment gets funding and help for the opioid epidemic; we should get the same funding and help.
1322235719931305984 2020-10-31 01:55:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @bluemiiints Actually, we should have known better. The white establishment has always been racist. The white establishment took a law and used it to destroy African/Black families, which is what they have been doing for 400 years. Why do we still act shocked when they show their true nature?

1322231965878259713 2020-10-31 01:40:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @bluemiiints Let’s be honest, Black people where one of the main supporters of the 94 crime bill. We wanted crack dealers off the street; we were tired of crackheads breaking into our homes, and the increase of violence. We wanted all of it to just go away. We made a mistake.
1322230570580103177 2020-10-31 01:35:08 +0800 <Shango5T> I agree with you wholeheartedly...and to be honest that behavior is not just occurring in Africa.  The entire African diaspora is far more gracious, forgiving, and helpful to everyone one else, except to other African/Black people.
1322216761656303618 2020-10-31 00:40:16 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I couldn’t agree more with you.  Or, as I often phrase it, I agree with you wholeheartedly.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
1322216340866949120 2020-10-31 00:38:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly...we give our leaders power.  Without us they are simply a single voice amongst many. We castigate the white establishment and their savior mentality, yet there are African/Black people who subconsciously want to be lead, as opposed to leading.
1322165278940237825 2020-10-30 21:15:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @Vanessa60926573 Exactly...as the saying goes, “ All your skin folk and your kin folk.”
1321958072781328384 2020-10-30 07:32:20 +0800 <Shango5T> Why doesn’t that surprise me...Nigeria has never stopped being a colony of England.

1321923820580675585 2020-10-30 05:16:13 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter You’re co-worker is right.  There was nothing stopping Sudan from being the jewel of Africa, except leadership and vision. Omar al-Bashir stole billions and wasted more billions on a useless war.  I wish I had the money and opportunity. This is my dream for Sudan.  https://t.co/iv4tjMFnUM
1321918893833756672 2020-10-30 04:56:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you wholeheartedly.  We Africans never knew we were pawns ♟ in a game.  The biggest problem that I currently have is that we’re still playing their games, and still acting like pawns.

1321916748992491522 2020-10-30 04:48:07 +0800 <Shango5T> @AbooIkhlaas @JaKingAce25 The activities of the Europeans and Arabs are well documented. Conflict was a means by which Africans were kidnapped.  Raids were common activities. As is still the occurrence in Libya, African Arabs focus on non-Arab Africans. Try reading a book, or article on present-day Libya.
1321913635099258881 2020-10-30 04:35:45 +0800 <Shango5T> @AbooIkhlaas @JaKingAce25 Time for a little bit of reality. Slave raids were a constant practice for both Europeans and Arabs. Arab is a culture not a race(yes, there are Black Arabs). Slavery was common worldwide 🌎. Arabs started focusing solely on Africans because they weren’t loyal to any ethnic group
1321868100204191744 2020-10-30 01:34:48 +0800 <Shango5T> @JaKingAce25 That begs the question, who really started the focus of African slavery.  Arabs have never been friends of Africans.
1321862209228566528 2020-10-30 01:11:24 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlueGhost40_ They were the white elite before Castro kicked out the US puppet Batista, along with their white privilege.

I don’t know the laws of the state of Pennsylvania on having a person committed, without their consent. In my opinion, there’s a huge gap in the laws for mental health.

1321140525945233411 2020-10-28 01:23:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @JaKingAce25 We need to stop acting like we’re surprised when cops shoot an African/Black person. By now(400 yrs), we should know the nature of the beast.  We need to stop giving these horrible human beings, “Get out of jail free excuses.” If they murder one of us - they go straight to prison
1321138929014374401 2020-10-28 01:17:20 +0800 <Shango5T> @DonPrist @LeWildPepper_ @roskioski @KantoLamin @UcheUchiha @BrothaHassan2 Bruh...this person has to one of three things: One, a white person using an African/Black avatar. Two, a Russian Bot.  Or, three, a sellout who is suffering from mental illness.
1321108174972375042 2020-10-27 23:15:08 +0800 <Shango5T> @DrUmarJohnson You’re surprised that two white cops shot an African/Black man with a knife...?!  Stop deluding yourself. After 400 years you don’t understand the nature of that dynamic. No, I’m not saying it’s right, however, I’m stating African/Black we should know the nature of that beast
1321105884328714240 2020-10-27 23:06:02 +0800 <Shango5T> @donlyversion One is white and the other is African/Black.  When dealing with the police, you have to understand the nature of the beast.

1320777938737004546 2020-10-27 01:22:54 +0800 <Shango5T> @vapemyworld Exactly...! There are 3 qualities loved  by the white establishment. First, in the face of racism, don’t complain. Second, acceptance that white culture is the preferred culture.  Third, being white is something to strive for.

1320471301413314561 2020-10-26 05:04:26 +0800 <Shango5T> @tinaishematope Rihanna invest millions of her own money, not to mention she actively participates in the construction of homes and schools. She collaborates with the UN because it gives her political muscle. Besides, she’s just one of many ladies trying to emulate Mama Afrika.
1320470531456569345 2020-10-26 05:01:22 +0800 <Shango5T> @tinaishematope @MwakioAm Africa has multiple cultures and there are vestiges of African culture practiced throughout the diaspora.  Which includes music, food, art, family, and many other ways. That’s like saying there can only be one image of African strength. Mama Afrika is a symbol for all Africans.
1320466196295286784 2020-10-26 04:44:08 +0800 <Shango5T> @momentus13 Exactly...as most African Americans have stated, FBA and ADOS are puppets for the far-right white supremest.  They did the work the white establishment couldn’t.
1320450450202730496 2020-10-26 03:41:34 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni @barricade450 Exactly!! She’s become an elitist who spews out anti-African male rhetoric.

1320443898586607616 2020-10-26 03:15:32 +0800 <Shango5T> @54Battalion He’s a puppet for France.  France gives him money, prestige, and probably a mistress. France gives him money to pay thugs so they can continue to extort the resources of Cameroon, and kill detractors. He’s an evil piece of 💩!
1320442925319442433 2020-10-26 03:11:40 +0800 <Shango5T> I stand with Ethiopia💯✊🏿!  Enough of having the white establishment and the West manipulating Africans.
1320442471696998413 2020-10-26 03:09:52 +0800 <Shango5T> @MwakioAm @tinaishematope Her deeds are meant to be appreciated and emulated. Being a Mama Afrika simply means you aspire to her greatness for civil rights and activism for Africans, it doesn’t mean replacing her. Malcolm X can’t be replaced, yet we all aspire to show his poise, intelligence and strength.
1320394590361440257 2020-10-25 23:59:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @tinaishematope Ok...however Mirriam Makeba vibe shouldn’t die with her.  It should continue on in other African (Continental and diaspora) women.  However, you’re right; it shouldn’t just be celebrities.  It’s about doing the groundwork.

Or, all your skin folk ain’t your kin folk.  Pictures like these continue to cast Africans as always being in a perpetual state of needing to be saved - which is bs😒.
1320387418516721664 2020-10-25 23:31:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @tinaishematope The title of Mama Afrika has numerous candidates. However, there are some sisters on the continent and in the diaspora who are working that vibe:  https://t.co/hB5huUbbVR  https://t.co/4Mx6l5XZPd

Of which, most of the central, Eastern, and some of Central Africa shares some of the same cultural and religious practices: Mali, Chad, Mauritania, and Niger.  Just to name a few.

1319483852931371008 2020-10-23 11:40:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni The 94 crime bill needs to be replaced. It was a mistake.
1319483556029227009 2020-10-23 11:39:29 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni @Malcolmxxx5 I agree with you wholeheartedly. I’m a supporter of the African masses. I want improvements in our neighborhoods. Trump supports white supremest, and I can’t tolerate that. I’ll support anyone who will help me people.
1319473917778665472 2020-10-23 11:01:11 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree with you wholeheartedly.  When opioids hit white neighborhoods, they quickly offered addicts treatment and sympathy. African American politicians, opted to put AA addicts in prison.  They sold us out.
1319473114380632068 2020-10-23 10:57:59 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni I agree.  The Congressional Black caucus, Black mayors, Black police chiefs represent black communities. They bailed on us. African Americans have amnesia, because we supported that dumbass 94 crime bill. When crack hit our neighborhoods, we panicked.
1319468494371590146 2020-10-23 10:39:38 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni No he didn’t.  That’s why the entire Black Caucus supported the 94 crime bill.  Black people supported the bill, because crackheads were breaking into people’s houses.   https://t.co/Pz0dOyjRhe
1319465477731700737 2020-10-23 10:27:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni Joe Biden did not call AA super predators, Hilary Clinton made that statement🤦🏿‍♂️. The biggest problem, is the amnesia of some African Americans, because African Americans supported the crime bill.  https://t.co/Pz0dOyjRhe

Some cultures used to sacrifice people to the great sea god, which was a shark.  Some cultures used to sacrifice children to the sun god. Awful traditions like this have to change.
1319331719036764161 2020-10-23 01:36:08 +0800 <Shango5T> @Armstrong141 @soledadobrien I agree with you. But in a limited amount of characters it’s not possible to go into how normal loving parents express their love for their children. Fathers hugging and kissing their kids is normal.
1319302353938427907 2020-10-22 23:39:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @JaKingAce25 Bruh...I agree with you 💯!  However, the saddest part is they have been doing the same move for 400 years. The only group who peeped it were the Haitians.

Next time, before you give a angry divisive response, you can’t take back, please think.🤔 💭
1319260783239483394 2020-10-22 20:54:16 +0800 <Shango5T> Bruh...💯💯 percent on point! The white establishment creates fake accounts and spread their narrative in order to cause chaos and division between the African diaspora and continental Africans. ADOS/FBA are accounts that routinely spread divisive rhetoric.
1319123560741408768 2020-10-22 11:48:59 +0800 <Shango5T> God opens the door, but we have to walk through it.
1319118515727728642 2020-10-22 11:28:56 +0800 <Shango5T> @soledadobrien Both of my parents hugged, kissed me, and told me they loved me. The problem with some people today, their minds immediately go to lurid depravity as opposed to innocent loving parents. I literally feel sorry for them; this tells me they grew up in a stale, loveless household.

1319011555074281474 2020-10-22 04:23:55 +0800 <Shango5T> @IbnFuwlani @AishaDaughter I don’t know if it’s growing or people are more vocal nowadays.  I do believe more education is needed. Some AA are in a bubble of me-ism. That’s why PanAfricanism is so important. We need vocal people, such as yourself, who are willing to challenge people.

African Americans don’t hate Africa. Just like other groups who come from other parts of the world, some AA are nationalistic. The nationalistic part don’t represent the majority of AA🤦🏿‍♂️

Take a look at one of the oldest Black/African church: FABC(First African Baptist Church)  https://t.co/wdxYjmOXgJ

Numerous Middle Eastern countries were colonized, but no longer. I believe they can too, and they can prosper. I believe Haiti can and it can be successful.

The biggest problem your organization/cult/ethnicity group have is their belief that ADOS disciples speak for AA - which they don’t. And you people believe you are in a position to apply a litmus test to the AA community - which you don’t.

ADOS received a great deal of pushback from AA, and changed their narrative. African American label accomplishes everything we need. You’re free to call yourself ADOS.

1317206468945379328 2020-10-17 04:51:09 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Good point!  First, the phenotype criteria set by Europeans has to be flushed down the toilet. Second, being African must mean you have an ancestral lineage, prior to colonialism. Being a colonialist is just that - you’re a colonizer.  Third, you must declare you are African.

Just like I can’t respond for Candace Owens or Clarence Thomas.  Some people are beyond my understanding. But, I’m not going to draw a conclusion based on a few outliers.

I’m sorry, but I’ve seen AA supporting the confederate and other pro-white establishment bs; and if I didn’t know better I would think it’s status quo for all AA. My personal experiences lead me.
1316755476672131073 2020-10-15 22:59:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @wonispotts @dijoni Matter of fact, AA fought for Ethiopians during WWII.

ADOS is simply intent on holding onto the slave mantra. It doesn’t matter how much evidence is given to them about the original label created by our ancestors, which is African American, or any other  facts. They embrace being the downtrodden.

For them, at least the few that I spoke to, being a Black Hebrew Israelite is more than just a religion. Maybe you talked to some who have a different philosophy?

Let’s not get overwrought and spread the false narrative that everyone brother and sister from the diaspora use the term.
1316019138079285250 2020-10-13 22:13:07 +0800 <Shango5T> @MohamedAbdulwa When she was single, a African/Black man was the bottom of her list.

I think much of their jealousy stems from the fact that Nigeria could be great, but corruption is rampant in the country; talent and opportunities are stifled.  But, that’s no reason to always project their misery onto AA.

When I look at Nigeria, they are a mirror image of AA. It’s jealousy. And I don’t know how to address people who are jealous. It’s a foreign emotion for me.

Let’s not get it crooked, it was white Europeans who continue placing Cleopatra in the line of white African queens, instead of what she was - which was being part of a invading Greek lineage.

1315478264786321408 2020-10-12 10:23:53 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Exactly...Nubians need to be seen.  Nubians need to be heard. Egyptians used to control all the vises for communication, but with today’s technology Nubians can go around a racist system that constrains their voice. I’d love to work with anyone to make that happen.

Any African with a shred of self-love would have known this is a racist caricature of Africans.  This just proves we have a long way to unraveling the self-hate that exist amongst us Africans.😒

You are free to identify as Black Hebrew Israelite, Black Indigenous, ADOS, DOS, or just American. I choose to align myself with my origin and people. And, one of my ancestors was Haitian.

We’re not reclaiming Egypt, as much as correcting the racist European concepts of African history. Unfortunately, we do have some people who have a scorch the earth approach - which is ignorant and wrong.

We’ve become embroiled in the concept that all Africans must look like W.Africans.

I would add the Indians and Arabs to that list. We need to state by our standards whom we deem worthy of our admiration and celebration

If a person gets off on a technicality, I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I’m talking about people who abuse the system and it can be unequivocally determined to a manipulation of the system
1315023563213213698 2020-10-11 04:17:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @HENRYD8TH First, allegations must be vetted. If it is determined that an allegation has a nefarious beginning. Meaning if revenge, money, or fear of someone finding out about a willing affair is the catalyst of a false allegation, jail is appropriate. Let’s just agree to disagree.✌🏿

It’s daunting to be psychologically attacked through every avenue of one’s society.  Being attacked for your blackness by family, job, entertainment; basically all social avenues, can be crippling.

1314920611093848065 2020-10-10 21:27:58 +0800 <Shango5T> @nxggachakras You’re adding more to the question.  The premise is “FALSELY ACCUSED”. I’m not asking if two people have two different views of a event and they go to court. I’m not asking if a women is drugged. Here’s an example:  https://t.co/9rg6OFIfDh

1314761237507473408 2020-10-10 10:54:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @NileRoss ADOS is an organization which was created in 2019.  Africans built America, and they brought with them their African skillsets. Museums and History books are full of documentation specifically state Africans built the United States. There is NO mention of the cult group - ADOS.

1314584564015169536 2020-10-09 23:12:38 +0800 <Shango5T> @AlMedjay @tapatalk Arabs want Africans to sacrifice being themselves, and they are using God to spread their own brand of racism. Arabs want Africans to be their mini-me. Have you noticed that the Turks are Muslim, but they rebuff be labeled Arab, nor do they emulate being Arab.

1314563780760797186 2020-10-09 21:50:03 +0800 <Shango5T> @KimeeBe That bullshit is his opinion.  Personally, I’m tired of emotionally weak brothers acting like their opinion applies to every African/Black male. Here’s the reality, he wants someone to feed and placate his ego.
1314411071218896896 2020-10-09 11:43:14 +0800 <Shango5T> Exactly!!!  https://t.co/cJg90ozTIw

1314308717345677316 2020-10-09 04:56:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @rpmjrdble Exactly...too many Africans/Black people panicked and simply wanted the crack epidemic to go away, which meant the people had to be taken off the streets. Instead of pointing fingers, AfricanBlack people should have coalesced around the goal of repealing the 94 Crime Bill.

1313486350637821953 2020-10-06 22:28:44 +0800 <Shango5T> There always seem to be a conflict within the African masses: Continental Africans vs. African Americans, Light complexioned Africans vs. Dark complexion Africans, Christian Africans vs. Muslims.

1313482915213381635 2020-10-06 22:15:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @OmowaleAfrika I hate the fact that we are so disjointed that we sabotage ourselves.
1313482661315457024 2020-10-06 22:14:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @JaKingAce25 Yes it is...the exact same one.  That’s why I said this video is staged. This lady is an agent for the white establishment. African Americans could have freed themselves but we had enough of these types of people to make sure we didn’t. Google Denmark Vesey.
1313472100578078721 2020-10-06 21:32:06 +0800 <Shango5T> @JaKingAce25 This video is staged by ADOS disciples. Only religious fanatics and mentally ill African/Blacks look to Trump as though as though he represents them.  If the diaspora doesn’t understand ADOS/FBA disciples don’t represent African Americans by now, I don’t know what else we can do.

Was there a small contingent of Africans in the Americas before Columbus, maybe.  But that doesn’t rebuff the transatlantic slave trade.

I bet if that were their child, they would not have been so readily willing to justify Trayvon’s murder.

Coptics have a very distinct relationship with Egypt, Ethiopia, and Greece. They are diverse, but Coptics are made up of indigenous Egyptians.

There are some African/Black people who are more racist towards African/Black people than any white person could ever be.  That’s why I use the term, White Establishment. White supremacy has many allies.

Haitians in Florida aren’t respected, but that’s due to Florida’s BS propaganda on AIDS. Haitians in Louisiana are respected, especially in New Orleans.

A lot of AA thought, after apartheid, SA would be our African destination but SA gave AA the stiff arm, and it became obvious the white establishment still controlled it.

1311685553679740929 2020-10-01 23:13:00 +0800 <Shango5T> @OsrTheGreat I guarantee that person is an ADOS/FBA disciple.  They spew out lies regularly about Africans and Africa on Twitter.

1311352804435468289 2020-10-01 01:10:46 +0800 <Shango5T> @AllClearly @OmowaleAfrika That crime bill was a disaster, but defunding the police is not the answer. The problem occurred when the communities were not involved in its construction. Only the politicians, police chiefs, mayors, and criminologist were involved.  Zero community leaders.
1311346177594527744 2020-10-01 00:44:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @BrooklynsSon Because defunding the police is stupid🤦🏿‍♂️. The police  need to be restructured and the community needs to be deeply involved in the policing of their communities.

1310956653064454151 2020-09-29 22:56:37 +0800 <Shango5T> @KantoLamin @AishaDaughter African countries are locked into an economic system that does not serve them well.  Zimbabwe left the Common Wealth and Great Britain devastated its economy.  Africa has to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council; it determines embargoes.
1310955030493753355 2020-09-29 22:50:10 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter It’s because of world economics.  Currently, world economics revolves around the United States, England, and the rest of Europe.  Colonialism left Africans in a position where it is forced to continue on with colonial economic practices.  African leaders are too afraid to change.

I think that stems from the fact that most men are taught that the only emotion society allows them to exhibit is anger. I’m not making excuses for the violence against women; I find such acts of violence deplorable.

The white establishment loves them and they are not considered to be a threat; they are considered to be an ally of the white establishment.  African/Black people are seen the same way.  They win no matter who is in office.
1310417760229429248 2020-09-28 11:15:15 +0800 <Shango5T> @Kobibornanew I agree with you on everything!  Now,  how is not voting going to reach those objectives?  We need to create our own political party, or support people who support us.  But sitting on our hands and doing nothing is not the answer.

Outside of that, you’re participating whether you like it or not.  By not voting, you allow the same people who volunteered African/Black people to slavery and Jim Crow laws to win🤦🏿‍♂️

She is African/Black, and more than likely an African/Black person suffering from depression will read her comments and act on them. African children are dying because we lack awareness of depression.

1308060296104284162 2020-09-21 23:07:31 +0800 <Shango5T> @dijoni That’s because white people value white lives; they don’t value African/Black lives.  And they convince African/Black and other cops to devalue African/Black lives.

1308053701634994182 2020-09-21 22:41:19 +0800 <Shango5T> @funshographix Did you know that African children are one the leading demographics to commit suicide due to depression? Often your comments are thought provoking &amp; interesting, but not this one. For people mourning the loss of a loved one due to suicide, this comment is a dagger in their heart.

1306646872224862208 2020-09-18 01:31:05 +0800 <Shango5T> @NubiaVisit Two more questions, do I need to know Arabic?  And what type of Arabic do I need to know? I sort of played around with the language, and with a lot of help I can muddle through it. However, I was told that traditional Arabic is useless, so I stopped learning it.
1306645746117152771 2020-09-18 01:26:36 +0800 <Shango5T> @NubiaVisit Thank you very much💯🙏🏿

1306622806558420994 2020-09-17 23:55:27 +0800 <Shango5T> @Omowale99949437 Agreed.  He needs to learn how to setup his punches, move, and for God sake learn how to throw multiple jabs, while moving. Stop relying on the all sanctified proverbial knockout punch 🥊 🤦🏿‍♂️.
1306620360134201345 2020-09-17 23:45:44 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter For business and socializing, English is important. IMO, we need to learn, and appreciate African languages. Numerous Africans know multiple languages, which allows them to intellectually interact with a global community, more importantly, they value their own African language.

1306587147475079168 2020-09-17 21:33:45 +0800 <Shango5T> @uzochiapa @AishaDaughter I agree with that wholeheartedly. Two perfect examples are Jews and Chinese. Both were disrespected abroad until China became strong for the Chinese; and Israel was formed and became strengthed by Jews. Africa has to be that for the African masses.
1306584782621552642 2020-09-17 21:24:22 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Colonization from Arabs and Europeans changed Africans psychologically to embrace a new norm; African norms where replaced. The first step back to a norm suitable for Africans begins with realizing what we don’t want and what we do want.

She revealed herself by not adding anything of value to the conversation, except vitriol.  And when she mocked the death of an African child, I was done with the conversation and blocked her.
1306462292859641857 2020-09-17 13:17:38 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter I agree with you. I will never understand the need for non African people who celebrate or mock African misery.  Behavior like that is abhorrent. It’s one of the reasons I want to work on African philanthropic projects on the continent and abroad, to help address our needs.

Islam doesn’t tell you to embrace Arabization, only the lessons and practice put forth by God. Arabization comes from a “lack of African agency and Arab imperialism.” Excellent point! Another step for me. Thank you 🙏🏿
1305503687998091270 2020-09-14 21:48:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @xobarwaaqo Africans have governed ourselves for thousands of years. Matter of fact, we had institutions way before Europeans. However, I think it’s very telling that every time a democratic and stable government surfaces, and takes umbrage to Europeans interference, that leader ends up dead
1305498411412656131 2020-09-14 21:27:30 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlackdiasporaV1 Personally, I think the white establishment does that out of fear. First, they need a escape goat, a distraction, for all their villainous world atrocities, and they fear reprisals from a cohesive, stable African power structure.
1305495663849943040 2020-09-14 21:16:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @therealmaric_ @thenexthobbit This may be chauvinistic, however, I love seeing African/Black women being treated like they are love of a man’s life. I’ve met too many women who don’t like to be romantic. Don’t like flowers, picnics, romantic walks, dressing up for dates or being little silly once in a while.
1305493164220964865 2020-09-14 21:06:39 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter This is the biggest dilemma I have with Islam. Islam from a commitment standpoint to God is beautiful. However, most ceremonial practices are too entangled with being Arab.  I love being African. Finding a way around Arabization is a journey.

1304904543583567873 2020-09-13 06:07:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @BullshitSlayer @AishaDaughter @_MustafaBadri Sub-Saharan is another BS name created by the white establishment.  It’s not geographic, because the Sahara includes Sudan, Mali, Chad, Niger, Mauritania, and Western Sahara. All of these countries are culturally similar. Yet, Algerians and Tunisia are heavily French and Turkish.
1304902291674234883 2020-09-13 05:58:44 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter Not to mention Europeans for Europe. 😒

1304873813734293505 2020-09-13 04:05:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @AishaDaughter The white establishment is keen on telling African people what to think and how they should feel.  Personally, they need to stay in their own lane. A friend of mine once stated: “White people act like God was the teacher who left the room, and left them in charge.”
1304870728609783810 2020-09-13 03:53:19 +0800 <Shango5T> @KellyLoudly @Jimdoberman If you take a look at the US, Europeans, and the Middle East; you have to conclude, yes.

1304584703505248257 2020-09-12 08:56:45 +0800 <Shango5T> @lizobuya_izwe That’s ridiculous.  Especially considering the historical wanton behavior of England, France, Belgium, Iran, and every other Arab country. The biggest problem in Africa are irresponsible, negligent, greedy African leaders. African leaders act like governing is a lottery ticket.
1304580575207063553 2020-09-12 08:40:21 +0800 <Shango5T> @lizobuya_izwe Okay, at this point I’m going to ask for specific information and not innuendos.  What atrocities has Obama committed against Black people? B
1304554738990669824 2020-09-12 06:57:41 +0800 <Shango5T> @lizobuya_izwe First, if you mean he ignored Afrikans, I agree with you wholeheartedly. Second, my entire premise doesn’t have anything to with Obama, per se. I’m highlighting how the white establishment vitriol is rooted in jealousy. Obama happens to be the most well known African/Black person
1304532589156368385 2020-09-12 05:29:40 +0800 <Shango5T> @BoazMwenje @KnowThySelFV We have allowed a racist white establishment to define who are Africans/Blacks, and what is our history.  To your point, this bs has to stop.😒

1300856478979350528 2020-09-02 02:02:07 +0800 <Shango5T> @shakkazulu However, the standard image of a terrorist should s what?  A Muslim Arab man.  Dude...I know countless Muslims who were assaulted or killed based on the pretext that they were terrorist.  None of images I’ve shown would’ve been considered as terrorist.🤦🏿‍♂️
1300855307732647937 2020-09-02 01:57:28 +0800 <Shango5T> @shakkazulu That’s because your understanding of English and propaganda spread by the white establishment is sub-par.  Everyone got the historical and cultural point but you.
1300832433105973249 2020-09-02 00:26:35 +0800 <Shango5T> @shakkazulu You’re missing the point, Hollywood always cast the image of a terrorist as an Arab, a crazy African, or a disenfranchised crazed radical, but often times these people are your next door neighbor.

1300794542954819585 2020-09-01 21:56:01 +0800 <Shango5T> I’m not on this earth to take on the mantel of being European.  I was born to be an African.  To be a reminder to the world, I am the symbol of God’s first born.  https://t.co/Fpdzda5Nko
1300791034314739715 2020-09-01 21:42:04 +0800 <Shango5T> @theblackdetour As an African man, I hate when I speak and another African person remakes, “you sound like a white man.” I always respond by saying, “actually I’m no longer brainwashed by the white establishment. My ancestors spoke seven different languages proficiently. Intelligence is African”
1300781434425278466 2020-09-01 21:03:55 +0800 <Shango5T> @BlackdiasporaV1 This is the real white establishment.  The Hollywood version is their way of spreading misinformation.
