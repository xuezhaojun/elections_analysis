1342801945816428545 2020-12-26 19:58:26 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> From 2 Kings 6 (in the bible),... we see God's forces outnumber evil's forces. However, a person needs faith..&amp; needs to be on God's side, it would seem.  https://t.co/Ml0oKTXj5v
1342798796930084865 2020-12-26 19:45:55 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> More interesting reading. All Roman citizens had to serve in Military. (Military is armed). It was their duty &amp; obligation as well as their right (slaves not allowed weapons).  CITIZENS IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE | Facts and Details  https://t.co/wx4L3YzLHm
1342796219890995201 2020-12-26 19:35:41 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> So, we see that even ancient Rome knew that banning weapons...was for those who are being subjugated &amp; ruled by force, not for the free citizens.  That's totally removed from our present debates, so it's telling. Wake up, America!
1342795479575384065 2020-12-26 19:32:44 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> Informative article. Romans banned SLAVES from bearing weapons.  During deep political strife, some allowed authorities to have weapons in areas where weapons were normally restricted for all.   https://t.co/Yca4A3txmM

1328708852406226945 2020-11-17 22:37:31 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @BullPup2A God told thru Moses 10 commandments, including to not kill/murder,...yet sent same people into battle &amp; caused the prophet Samuel to hack a king to death.  Same is not always same.  A difference exists.

1328707199665909760 2020-11-17 22:30:57 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @BullPup2A Before Calvary, Jesus told disciples to buy swords. Then, in garden, urged Peter to not use it. Maybe it was comfort, deterrent?  IF Jesus called angels to help, cross wouldn't have happened.  If disciples or himself got killed prematurely, that would infringe on God's plans.
1328705392306741248 2020-11-17 22:23:46 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @BullPup2A ... Eye for eye was to help victims &amp; tamp down evil urges. Perfection looked to help bad people repent &amp; get right w/God, helping souls. Some refuse all repentance &amp; prefer evil. Shall all others lose their souls because of bratty God-haters? I don't think God desires that.
1328703443649826816 2020-11-17 22:16:01 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @BullPup2A Some things related to specific times, people &amp; places. Same God of bible empowered Samson and Joshua.

1326528879914258433 2020-11-11 22:15:05 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @JackPosobiec @DonaldJTrumpJr The storm...is actually the deep state trying to assist a discreet coup. They're getting crazy because Trump's legally the winner...&amp; maybe they &amp; others could possibly go to jail as Trump drains the swamp.  https://t.co/nfqKt8IEyF
1326527441104474113 2020-11-11 22:09:22 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @DonaldJTrumpJr Absolutely. It's another coup attempt.
1326516994351517696 2020-11-11 21:27:51 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @Cernovich @DonaldJTrumpJr Sir, @ReportGovtCrime  just posted a thread detailing that your father def., Absolutely, legally won the election.... ...&amp; it explains why, ...&amp; why SCOTUS must rule in his favor. It's irrefutable. MAGA!  https://t.co/CEGCZu1HYe
1326514135430008832 2020-11-11 21:16:29 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 ....I'm fact, that would be a reasonable response if they did so...or that military remove them.  Then, Trump, the rightful legal President... would have many more SCOTUS appointments.  Dems can only blame themselves for failed, hair-brained scheme.
1326513595933478913 2020-11-11 21:14:21 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 If SCOTUS violates it's Oath to uphold Constitution, every Justice who does so gets rightly removed from office.  It could all cause a civil war if not so, if Justices freely, brazenly violate their Oaths &amp; Constiution. .....
1326510619630186497 2020-11-11 21:02:31 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 The GOOD News is the USA is not a dictatorship -- no dictatorship by President, SCOTUS OR Congress.  State laws may allow some leeway for emergency powers to decree w/I state legislative action. CONSTITUTION...does NOT allow that for National Elections. SO, Trump gets 2nd term.  https://t.co/ZmgIVL8kgf
1326503964188286977 2020-11-11 20:36:04 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 ...and SCOTUS staying in it's bounds... ...and refusing to usurp powers of Constiution and Congress Is TOTALLY legitimate.  Trump simply seems to be smarter than many Dems think.
1326503272782426113 2020-11-11 20:33:20 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 BTW, abiding by Law and Constitution... ...is Not a loophole.
1326502819650818049 2020-11-11 20:31:32 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @djscene @VanJones68 Trump didn't lose. Notice NO state has certified Joe as winner. SCOTUS must also uphold the Constiution... ...which stipulates state legislatures must do their Election laws.  So, SCOTUS obliged to toss out mass mail-in ballots done w/o due legislative action. There was time.

1326489101433008128 2020-11-11 19:37:01 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump SCOTUS should rule all in favor of Trump, ... refuse to usurp legislative powers, Constiution.... &amp; say Congress &amp; state legislators had PLENTY of time to act to change laws since CoVid19 hit... ...instead of neglecting their duties, hiding inside &amp; pretending to be nonessential.  https://t.co/ZxLHuQk3jh

Generals mutinied vs their Commander in Chief, refusing any consideration of sending troops to stop Dems burning, looting cities although it's totally legal per US Code.

1318409571585712128 2020-10-20 12:31:51 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> I doubt he's a Christian pastor.  Christian pastors should have better qualities, IMO.
1318409109616660482 2020-10-20 12:30:01 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @revwadegriffith (2)...many people who were actually there have said Trump didn't mock soldiers, contrary to anonymous claims.  Bible says let things be established on 2 or more witnesses.  A real pastor would know that.  Slander &amp; false accusation is not like Jesus. Hmm, WHAT denomination?
1318407794333274113 2020-10-20 12:24:47 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @revwadegriffith Falsely insinuating Trump is a bigot w/no evidence is not Christian. As for groper, U must mean Biden:  https://t.co/19hUcH3oSP .  Russian assert?  No evidence, but Clinton's seem more guilty of that. ....
1318406832835186691 2020-10-20 12:20:58 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @revwadegriffith I think you're a fake pastor because you don't seem to love truth.  Maybe you simply are ignorant, in which case you should educate yourself before commenting ignorantly.  Trump as repeatedly denounced white supremacists.  I never heard Biden denounce antifa.

1317119459237179393 2020-10-16 23:05:24 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @QNNTexas Trump should get that video on huge screen at his rallies, with the artist playing it live.  Yeow!  https://t.co/u6w9CiJfRN

You should thank Trump &amp; be glad you weren't in a nursing home when pandemic hit.  You should thank God &amp; pray for sight to see, not let politics blind you.
1317117211337805824 2020-10-16 22:56:28 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @SenSchumer Apparently you can't handle more than an hour w/o lying.  However, Trump's a busy man, been MAGA, working on a cure for CoVid19, campaigning (not in basement by noon). ...

1316549985220153352 2020-10-15 09:22:31 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @adeptDD11 @almostjingo @JoeBiden No, it's not illegal for someone NOT in our govt to lobby, but probably need to register as doing so if for a foreign govt.  They tried to say someone linked to Trump didn't do so, so it would apply vice-versa, too, right?
1316549481702326275 2020-10-15 09:20:31 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @adeptDD11 @almostjingo @JoeBiden I was talking about Hunter.  Of course those in OUR govt should NOT be a foreign lobbyist/rep.

1316402803267469312 2020-10-14 23:37:40 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @adeptDD11 @almostjingo @JoeBiden Probably something about having to register as a foreign lobbyist, for Hunter. For Joe, it'd be something about the Quid Pro Quo, doing favors to get something, selling influence in our govt.

1316400693419401218 2020-10-14 23:29:17 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> ...Yeah, 'cause the elsewhere I mentioned probably influenced more people to vote against Biden and for Trump...than if I'd spent all my time here.  Hooyeah!
1316400102152470528 2020-10-14 23:26:56 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> Just got back on, here, after being booted for a week for saying basically what Rush said on radio the following day.

1312489254291861505 2020-10-04 04:26:37 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> ...Then, also, we likely would've seen WAR.

1301601543167369217 2020-09-04 03:22:45 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @SpeakerPelosi Thank you, Mrs. Pelosi, for exposing the fraud of the CoVid crisis, going maskless &amp; getting your hair done when that was against the Law - bogus laws made up for the masses. You obviously deserve to be above them, &amp; showed it.  Now, we can all go back to some degree of normalcy.  https://t.co/IOq3JRQERR
1301330265210580999 2020-09-03 09:24:47 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @PatriotBe @intheMatrixxx Federal Law applies to everyone, right?  I mean, everyone lives in one state or other, or a district or territory, etc.  Fed law is for all such people, like drug laws.  OOps, well, hmm, why is drug law the only fed law NOT enforced around the country?  Odd.

1301327372034211842 2020-09-03 09:13:17 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @pvtjokerus I've kinda wondered, also, as to whether it would be illegal to take out an antifa nut via rifle &amp; scope....if the perp were about to do deadly assault on a cop.  Legal or illegal?  Just curious.  Some patriotic Americans might like to know, right?  https://t.co/AEvgLHtt2K

1301302047061536768 2020-09-03 07:32:39 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> Patriots must convince, sway people that it's in the interest of all to vote Trump - so it's a massive landslide for Trump.  Civil War is not good for anyone.  It'd ruin our economy.  Trump is the only good path, even if you dislike his personality or demeanor at times.

1301234394997415938 2020-09-03 03:03:50 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> When some people go senile,...they get mean!  Consider how Joe Biden has turned on even other Democrats in an aggressive manner at times.  If elected, he could turn into a Hitler, with a powerful military at his beckon call!  NAZIs (like Goebbels) smiled at times, too, remember?  https://t.co/nTsQo87wR0
1301233491452067841 2020-09-03 03:00:14 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> I agree with the mental expert that Joe is suffering mental deterioration.  It is were mere stuttering, that would not affect his ability to say the right thing when the words come out.  It would simply delay the coming out of proper speech.  This isn't what's been happening.  https://t.co/nkxg5tqQiD

1301231254889734144 2020-09-03 02:51:21 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @TheSun Thank you for your feedback.  In USA, the parties are in conflict this election year, but little is being said about Biden's mental frailty, confusion, etc. - various saddening signs of mental deterioration.  While we directly are affected by our elections, it also touches world.
1301230545322508289 2020-09-03 02:48:32 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @TheSun POLL for OUTSIDE of America! - DNC presidential candidate Joe Biden seems to have early signs of dementia/Alzheimer's.  Since America is a nuclear power, &amp; U.S. President has authority to order nuclear strikes,  global power reach,...SHOULD BIDEN be considered for the Presidency?

1301225340052832257 2020-09-03 02:27:51 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> @Jim_Jordan They simply use words that sounds innocent/okay to describe their manipulative tools in the algorithm which kicks out undesirables (conservatives) as bad.

1301193882672209922 2020-09-03 00:22:51 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> Patriots, be on the alert for Dems printing bogus mail-in ballots...that they may plan on filling out in favor of DNC candidates. Also, they could import them from printshops abroad. (Might have had grammar?😊). They'd need places to store them secretly...&amp; lists of dead voters.
1301192281454772224 2020-09-03 00:16:29 +0800 <ReportGovtCrime> Seems a lot of people thinking alike on this matter, considering the RTs.  Dems have offended America by burning our cities.
