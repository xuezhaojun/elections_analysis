1321145851952201730 2020-10-28 01:44:51 +0800 <karendevine84> @Bill_Maxwell_ Has always been an asshole. Such contempt for anyone he deems beneath him, which would be nearly everyone of course.
1320928503408328704 2020-10-27 11:21:11 +0800 <karendevine84> @DLoesch JFC, I thought you disappeared.

1314339773801259008 2020-10-09 06:59:55 +0800 <karendevine84> @JamesKosur Pence is the one who advocated for sitting during the debate, that was the first red flag. The pinkeye confirmed diagnosis for me, that and his skin being the same color as his hair! He knew and should be ashamed...or prosecuted.

1307206647853584384 2020-09-19 14:35:26 +0800 <karendevine84> @BB_Updates I think Day believes Nicole cuz of how Nicole thanked her for her vote when she won. She assumes that Nicole would be in her debt because of that. Never trust Nicole...she is so annoying.

1306056822391013377 2020-09-16 10:26:26 +0800 <karendevine84> @barbvas I have lost a child as well. Always talk about her, you are still her Mom. If possible, join a grief group, that helps and also some grief counseling. Your child is your child forever. Find the people who will listen. I'm so sorry for you/your family's loss. Hardest thing ever 💔
1305406287392452609 2020-09-14 15:21:26 +0800 <karendevine84> @BearroristJodi Will be the best thing to ever happen to you...good luck.

This 'man' should be fired as a statement of support for all who suffer from this horrible disease. God Bless our boys...💖 may we find some peace amidst our grief, and send hope to all reaching out.

My oldest son 💔 and now I and his younger brother have to go on. Devastating. It is 'takes' like these that keep people, esp young men, from reaching out. I am so pissed off at this idiot. He needs to be fired...now. So so sorry for your loss. 💔💔💔
1304019118740434945 2020-09-10 19:29:20 +0800 <karendevine84> @WaterDean Good, necessary language 😏. Watching from Canada, horrified and sympathetic. Have Boston cousins who are Trumpers...beyond comprehensible at this point. Keep posting, you are the 'real' American. Wishing you strength. 🇨🇦

1303505515012644864 2020-09-09 09:28:27 +0800 <karendevine84> @AdamParkhomenko The fact that a sitting president was accused by more than 30 women of sexual assault should have been a much bigger story in the first place...🙄🙄🙄

1301680054511034376 2020-09-04 08:34:43 +0800 <karendevine84> As a horrified Canadian watching this debacle in the US, especially after calling calling soldiers killed in action losers and suckers, why are the major newspapers not calling for this idiot's resignation?? Unfathomable to me. Wishing all sane Americans nothing but the best ✌
