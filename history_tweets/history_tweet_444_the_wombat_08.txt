1343413075991379969 2020-12-28 12:26:51 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @CodeMonkeyZ @Mike_Pence Trump relying on anyone other than himself is his downfall  Swamp protects swamp
1343412315534680065 2020-12-28 12:23:50 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @JackPosobiec And if that‚Äôs true  And he truly beloved the swamp will do anything other than what they‚Äôve done for decades   Then trump is dumb as hell

1343411430301650944 2020-12-28 12:20:19 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @TimRunsHisMouth And in 2022 voters will confuse voting in those same politicians that locked them down destroyed their business and let their family members die alone  Nothing  Changes  Voters  Never  Learn
1343410680804700161 2020-12-28 12:17:20 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @ThunderB And when voters continue to vote in swamp people and trump says ‚Äúo told you so. I showed you so‚Äù it won‚Äôt change a thing  ‚ÄúI told the kid he‚Äôd shoot his eye out with a BB gun. We got the kid the gun and look what happened‚Äù
1343408494653841410 2020-12-28 12:08:39 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @Shem_Infinite And our votes still won‚Äôt matter
1343408094294855681 2020-12-28 12:07:03 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @ThunderB The problem with all this is that even if people remember ‚Äútrump was right about literally everything‚Äù it won‚Äôt matter and the swamp will have already waited him out and moved on.
1343404482793619457 2020-12-28 11:52:42 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @JesseKellyDC Yup  And now our votes don‚Äôt matter

1337454238419435521 2020-12-12 01:48:33 +0800 <the_wombat_08> @MikayesFiona Right now I think the tx case is focused on those 4 states changing federal election laws mid election and not through their states constitution  The fraud and vote numbers don‚Äôt matter in their case  I would assume they would bring in more evidence if accepted
