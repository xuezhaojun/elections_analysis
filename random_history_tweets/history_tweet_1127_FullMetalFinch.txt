1344066805086613504 2020-12-30 07:44:32 +0800 <FullMetalFinch> @TaraStVirgie @brianstelter I agree. He is entirely predictable when you understand his motivations which I‚Äôve narrowed down to self-preservation and money, his only loves.   I have also found that if you want to predict him, think of the most chaotic, punitive action available. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôll choose.
1344064327876104192 2020-12-30 07:34:41 +0800 <FullMetalFinch> @TaraStVirgie @brianstelter That‚Äôs very plausible. That he made deals to get re-elected is a certainty. We CAUGHT him doing it and impeached him for it. If we knew the extent to which he cheated, we‚Äôd be stunned.   But HE knows, so he‚Äôs completely disoriented.

1343774166441332737 2020-12-29 12:21:42 +0800 <FullMetalFinch> @TaraStVirgie @brianstelter He‚Äôs never had a fucking clue about what to do about anything. He‚Äôs profoundly stupid. The ONLY thing he‚Äôs good at is self-preservation. He has the survival instincts of a diseased street rat and he‚Äôll strike out at anyone to save himself.

The scum he pardons have no incentive to remain silent and can be forced to testify.

This should all have been revealed when he was just a candidate. Instead msm fell all over themselves giving him free airtime and press. They failed us in so many ways.

1311948074957193217 2020-10-02 16:36:10 +0800 <FullMetalFinch> @CyndiSuzy It‚Äôs possible. He also cancelled fund raisers and his upcoming rally. All of that is very unusual for him. Maybe he‚Äôs finding a way to avoid debates and bow out of the race with a pardon from Pence. I‚Äôve been thinking for sometime he might be looking for an exit plan.

He and his staff have been careless, no masks or distancing. It would have been more surprising if he didn‚Äôt get sick. Also, he doesn‚Äôt look well, sweating, strange gait. He looks haunted.
1311941526713294848 2020-10-02 16:10:09 +0800 <FullMetalFinch> @CyndiSuzy That‚Äôs true. If he‚Äôs ever told the truth, I‚Äôm not aware of it.
