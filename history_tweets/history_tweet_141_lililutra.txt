1342910800009289730 2020-12-27 03:10:59 +0800 <lililutra> Despite being late to the @TonyChocolonely party, I’m glad that I finally arrived &amp; look forward to road testing some more flavours! (For market research purposes, obvs!) 😁🍫
1342881470881394691 2020-12-27 01:14:26 +0800 <lililutra> I’d never heard of @TonyChocolonely before yesterday. My thoughtful niece had obviously put effort in to finding my kind of chocolate (ethical &amp; salted caramel) and I have to say it’s absolutely bloody delicious 😋🤩 Thank you @alexbraby10 😍  https://t.co/8UduPpMG4H
1341003549040406530 2020-12-21 20:52:15 +0800 <lililutra> Incredible!

1340651085661401090 2020-12-20 21:31:41 +0800 <lililutra> I’m not one for putting things on animals, but this did amuse me (a bit too much 😬)
1340288038920998915 2020-12-19 21:29:04 +0800 <lililutra> @NikiRust I just find this mysogonistic bullying incredible. Her husband hasn’t even taken office yet &amp; the attempts to publicly ridicule her are astonishing. Is this how these people usual conduct themselves &amp; now it’s public? I hope that this Prof’s organisation has a word. Pitiful.
1340269237215047680 2020-12-19 20:14:21 +0800 <lililutra> @JonBielby Can’t talk about it 🤐

1337407272843173896 2020-12-11 22:41:56 +0800 <lililutra> Just no! The lady here is shutting down the inappropriate comments in a polite way, &amp; he still continues!  All my life, this kind of behaviour has been sold as ‘playful’, ‘banter’, or something to be flattered by.  Firm = aggressive. Not firm = doing nothing to discourage them 🤬
1337385596524908544 2020-12-11 21:15:48 +0800 <lililutra> I didn’t know that there was a new party. Very glossy images, but worth reading the words to see just what agenda is being pushed 😞

1336667879270387717 2020-12-09 21:43:51 +0800 <lililutra> Is the prefix ‘senior government’ some sort of special code for avoiding repercussions?  Don’t worry, he’s only a lawyer 🙄Those choosing to ignore the true impact of these actions should be ashamed of themselves. You’ve just enabled a behaviour that violates people. Well done 😞

1336257149228511232 2020-12-08 18:31:45 +0800 <lililutra> I don’t watch this programme, but if any similar story resonates with you, please contact a relevant organisation. This insidious behaviour leads to a life of misery for many (not just the partner) and once it starts working, they’ll make you think there no way out. But there is.

1314159323099078661 2020-10-08 19:02:53 +0800 <lililutra> Please follow the thread. This insidious behaviour is seen in deed &amp; judgemental rhetoric, both of which are unacceptable &amp; need to stop. If you think it’s a ‘bit of fun’ to intimidate &amp; humiliate women, the problem is you (not what I’m wearing/said/looked over/being there!)

1312667212621262848 2020-10-04 16:13:46 +0800 <lililutra> I’ve learnt more from following @Menopause_Cafe than anywhere else. Despite years of smear tests, contraception, sexual health advice, &amp; gyny procedures, it’s not been mentioned. It’s a defined, imminent life stage for women, more so than childbirth, so why not discussed widely?
