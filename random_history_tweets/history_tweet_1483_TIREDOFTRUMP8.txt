1344006098077020161 2020-12-30 03:43:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumpadict Arnold!
1344006018406211584 2020-12-30 03:42:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump will always be a traitor! He's lazy, even now he just plays golf while the vaccines SIT. He's not addressed the destruction in Nashville. He tried to defund our military. Lies about the Russian cyber attack. Hides money, boy I can't imagine the charges that are coming!
1343981013626712066 2020-12-30 02:03:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So he has the missing $617 MILLION, the hidden Chinese bank account, fails to release his taxes, is conning supporters out of hundreds of millions of dollars right now-they pay as he golfs...and Trumpers think Biden is the criminal-or has the ties to China!
1343980522511478785 2020-12-30 02:01:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you freaking kidding?

1343980116687261696 2020-12-30 02:00:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So we will have the worst record at vaccine’s too! Funny-when all your so called lazy ignorant president does is golf and tweet, who could see that coming?
1343979851699662855 2020-12-30 01:59:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> KayLie just never stops spewing, does she?
1343979564184317952 2020-12-30 01:57:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RCampbellmc58 I’m less interesting than cardboard.
1343977592689467392 2020-12-30 01:50:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lies! You can’t do nothing and expect it to just disappear!
1343976520763768832 2020-12-30 01:45:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course they will!
1343976344674250759 2020-12-30 01:45:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s not simply that he’s spent our money so he can golf-he’s enriched himself by playing at his owned golf courses! He’s so corrupt-just a filthy greedy lazy ignorant lying little man!
1343975944017612800 2020-12-30 01:43:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So funny how Trump wailed like a little baby over Obama golfing!
1343975188191465472 2020-12-30 01:40:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow-imagine them living on even the $2000, let alone $600! Shameful
1343974821269536768 2020-12-30 01:39:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is such a lazy ignorant fool! Still golfing! Sickening!
1343974558345396225 2020-12-30 01:37:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LepapillonBlu That they will actually work for all Americans!
1343969761118597121 2020-12-30 01:18:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!
1343969644873461761 2020-12-30 01:18:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly-what kind of freak does this? Can you imagine what other countries are thinking?
1343969474312105988 2020-12-30 01:17:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How many laws has Trump broken? He’s the most corrupt person on earth!
1343969215762591744 2020-12-30 01:16:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course! Trumps pathetic response has shown no leadership or hope!
1343954926460932097 2020-12-30 00:19:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Gloriabesos I can’t imagine what you are going through! Thoughts, prayers and hugs!
1343950225258508296 2020-12-30 00:01:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a pathetic liar! Who in the world would want a leader like this? He doesn't do anything to help lead us through major crisis right now, all he does is golf, lie, and tweet lies. What an idiot!
1343949755219636225 2020-12-29 23:59:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy, how many years will it take to clean up Trumps mess here and abroad?
1343949219212754945 2020-12-29 23:57:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's a monster! He doesn't care about America, only what he can benefit from!
1343939570182848514 2020-12-29 23:18:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is worse than Benedict Arnold! He's had 26 women, including a 13 year old accuse him of rape or sexual assault! He's photographed for decades with Epstein and Maxwell! He's a disgusting little man who preys on others!
1343939218855362560 2020-12-29 23:17:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is completely insane! Who lies like this? Who spends so much time making stuff up? He could actually work once in a while, couldn't he? Nope, he's way too stupid and lazy!
1343938820484567042 2020-12-29 23:15:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> KayLie!

1338912550008872962 2020-12-16 02:23:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps corruption will take years to completely uncover!
1338911999401615361 2020-12-16 02:21:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Clearly a loser his entire life! On to prison!
1338911591136374785 2020-12-16 02:19:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Every time he opens his mouth or tweets? Such a pathetic weak man that he has to lie about everything!

1332768940553089028 2020-11-29 03:30:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrianReinarz @sosaithi Or in front of the firing squad!
1332541295961796609 2020-11-28 12:26:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can’t they be sanctioned for that?

1332466567456681984 2020-11-28 07:29:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He just accuses hospital workers of stealing PPE and lying about COVID deaths!

1332416730388451334 2020-11-28 04:11:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ok-Trump is very upset #DiaperDonald is trending. What if we all agreed to stop tweeting #DiaperDonald if he agrees to publicly concede the election? Let’s get #DependsDonnie going so that he understands that the end of #DiaperDonald DEPENDS on his concession. #DependsDonnie. Ok?
1332402353945915392 2020-11-28 03:14:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, I can't sedate any longer? Damn, it's hard to keep up with the law these days!

1332186131413295107 2020-11-27 12:54:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ah let’s not forget he said he might even leave the country!

1332155005332320256 2020-11-27 10:51:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Disgrace!
1332148439262638081 2020-11-27 10:25:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are your tax returns Trump? Where is your health care plan Trump? Why are you still silent on Russia paying to kill our military? Who do you owe $421,000,000 to?

1332125229213212672 2020-11-27 08:52:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love how he makes others think they are so beneath him. That’s what real leaders do!
1332124427526549504 2020-11-27 08:49:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a nasty nasty little man Trump is!

1331970170374541313 2020-11-26 22:36:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe and Jill Biden true Americans in the WH again not the scumbag grifters!
1331969759441805313 2020-11-26 22:35:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe and Jill Biden care so much about all of America!
1331756622528606211 2020-11-26 08:28:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KristenM777 Yay

1331748218019999746 2020-11-26 07:54:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ergo-Trump is a traitor!
1331637562868379649 2020-11-26 00:35:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @rxjef77 @eegarim Yes we are!

1331631428816281600 2020-11-26 00:10:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is that why he’s calling to bring firing squads as a form of execution?
1331630425039572999 2020-11-26 00:06:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @WalshFreedom @RuleandRuin @Yascha_Mounk Let’s really hope no—no Republicans ever again with Trumps new push for firing sqauds
1331629517841031170 2020-11-26 00:03:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump literally wants a firing squad-let that sink in!

1331626261475635200 2020-11-25 23:50:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Your speaking out helped saved our great nation! Thank you!
1331624028973445120 2020-11-25 23:41:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So we should just ignore your dishonesty then right @JennaEllisEsq
1331441264491950080 2020-11-25 11:35:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They stole from hardworking honest Americans, and they will be punished for their crimes
1331438482565246976 2020-11-25 11:24:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GOP is pro-Tyson of coursw-sick F-ckers!

1331413832221253634 2020-11-25 09:46:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And Trump until he’s imprisoned in NY!
1331413593221369856 2020-11-25 09:45:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MaryLTrump @johncusack Thank you Mary! Please understand when I use Trump in a bad way-it’s not aimed at you!

1331346849534533633 2020-11-25 05:19:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's so funny how Trump doesn't know the word what the word correlation means! He's such an idiot! As if any other president would stop their day of work to brag about anything, let alone the fact that he's so bad, when he's lost, the stock market has it's highest day!
1331313266472181760 2020-11-25 03:06:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course, Putin is getting what he paid Trump for. Trump has proven he always puts Putin over America and her dear allies! Don't be a Donald!

1331311883358523401 2020-11-25 03:01:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @charliekirk11 Right, because you seem to be unaware, he will be sworn in on January 20th! You'd think you guys would know at least one thing about American politics!
1331310783834300417 2020-11-25 02:56:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's nice to know we won't be the laughing stock of the entire world again!

1331310163299602435 2020-11-25 02:54:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How many of them bragged all over themselves and made it about them? Oh, none? How many are related to Biden? Oh, none? How many of them spewed hatred and division? Oh, none? Jeez...how human can this administration get?
1331309663875379214 2020-11-25 02:52:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh will Randy be the new head of his legal team?
1331309470052462593 2020-11-25 02:51:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you dear friends for not turning on us, like our ugly president turned on you!
1331309264007290885 2020-11-25 02:50:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!!! Okay Trumpers-guess you hate our military now!
1331309163515944965 2020-11-25 02:50:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or his taxes womp womp
1331309042027859968 2020-11-25 02:49:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Cheers to the most corrupt administration in history. May all of our horrific crimes and failures be shown throughout the land and your stay in prison be indefinite!
1331308884007510016 2020-11-25 02:49:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!!! Love how they turn on each other! They follow Trump to a tee!
1331308494994231300 2020-11-25 02:47:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DoyenneSolace Isn't it wonderful! It's almost like we can sleep again! Although a lot and I mean a lot of crazy Trumpers here want to start a war over this!
1331308163090571264 2020-11-25 02:46:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe's amazing message. No doom &amp; gloom. No lies, no yelling, no sneering! No, look at all that I did! America is never about the good of one person over the many. Can't wait til Trumpers are out of their creepy fog. They support an accused rapist, with 24 sexual assault charges!
1331307379510681602 2020-11-25 02:43:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You got that right! Love this response!!!
1331306447779614721 2020-11-25 02:39:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kayleighmcenany Right, because there is no corruption, no lies, no drama. Get used to it sweetie! This is Joe Biden's America!!!
1331306179088297985 2020-11-25 02:38:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How is that possible?
1331306137115824129 2020-11-25 02:38:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What it means America-Biden Best Squad is here!
1331305899533758468 2020-11-25 02:37:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe Biden winning the election and our country getting back to life again!
1331305618318237699 2020-11-25 02:36:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Daniel Dale is still suffering from PTSD...he will be okay again!
1331305336981114887 2020-11-25 02:35:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Humanity and Empathy-lets see, were those words ever used during the Trump administration?
1331305213177835524 2020-11-25 02:34:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love socks with Dogs on them! Also love folks whom dogs trust...
1331305007682097155 2020-11-25 02:33:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like President's who side with America, not Putin!
1331304883492941825 2020-11-25 02:33:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hard work, telling the truth, and serving others. Guess Trump missed that episode of leadership class!
1331304750097240068 2020-11-25 02:32:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'll be so glad when we 1. Have a president who woks, and 2. doesn't take time to interrupt his work schedule to notify us of what he thinks are his accomplishments! The best workers never once brag about their work. Ever notice that? The scabs who barely hang on brag nonstop!  https://t.co/ISJ9lX0uic
1331304393761841156 2020-11-25 02:31:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow invite people of different backgrounds and beliefs, instead of building walls. What a difference!
1331304212261707783 2020-11-25 02:30:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think Barr! His views are quite alarming!
1331303973878423554 2020-11-25 02:29:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like President's who don't take orders from Putin!
1331303607925411840 2020-11-25 02:28:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, Biden won again? Stop!
1331302709320949769 2020-11-25 02:24:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you believe we have competent adults again? Listen to them speak. Amazing! Honor, courage, support! No spewing bitterness and hate. The message is unity for a stronger America!
1331302382446256128 2020-11-25 02:23:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I bet our allies are tearing up seeing competent, sane leadership again! How are my Canadian Friends???
1331301969902907402 2020-11-25 02:21:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They know a virus doesn't have feelings, and won't magically disappear!
1331301676926562304 2020-11-25 02:20:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Simply the best! Better than all the rest!
1331301173631082496 2020-11-25 02:18:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? Biden's picks will tell him what he needs to hear, not what he wants to hear? What a novel idea!

1331300587678412800 2020-11-25 02:16:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez so again today, Biden wins Pennsylvania and Nevada, boring! How long before he wins Georgia yet again?
1331300196995768322 2020-11-25 02:14:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Biden-The election is over.
1331300142415228938 2020-11-25 02:14:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davidmweissman After these knee jerk reactions, it will be nice to take things a little slower for a while. The key difference being, Biden's administration will focus on COVID every day, instead of Trump with anything but...golf, Twitter, McDonalds, Fox News, Putin's bidding, looting, lying...

1331298621120270336 2020-11-25 02:08:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, another Joe Biden win? I almost start to feel sorry for Trumpers...nah!
1331298208887296007 2020-11-25 02:06:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe Biden, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it! What a coward Trump has been only doing Putin's bidding! How pathetic! Listen to an actual leader America!
1331298011666903043 2020-11-25 02:05:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As usual with Trump, it's all hype filled with lies and zero evidence!
1331297717608460289 2020-11-25 02:04:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh yes, yes we do!
1331297538134183944 2020-11-25 02:04:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Trumpers, Trump made 298 Golf Trips during his presidency-most of them 2 day trips! So, that's almost 600 days he spent golfing! I thought he was the president who said he'd almost never take a day off to golf! Really 100 days shy of TWO FREAKING YEARS? Really?
1331296668092919821 2020-11-25 02:00:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BMeiselas I know, it's almost like the French are in on this to sell more booze!!!
1331296546193858567 2020-11-25 02:00:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am really getting tired of all of Biden's winning. It's like too much winning. It's almost like he's won about a million times over Trump, isn't it? Every time I look up, he won again! Biden won again! Biden won!
1331296322083827712 2020-11-25 01:59:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Although of course I am happy....how many times do we have to hear about Biden winning again, and again, and again, and again? It's getting kinda old.
1331295921641025539 2020-11-25 01:57:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, for once I agree with Rush Limbaugh! I hope he really hammers this home!
1331295710776614912 2020-11-25 01:56:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Of course I wish our 46th President luck!
1331295652513521671 2020-11-25 01:56:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Actually North and South Dakota take those prizes! Their cases and deaths per capita are the deadliest! But it's okay, you go on your 4 bullet points about Trump, and praise him when he does nothing but golf and bilk us out of every last dime. How's that open skies looking?
1331294989767356416 2020-11-25 01:53:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Oh, so that's why he's dismantling planes for Open Skies? That's doing Putin's bidding. Why can't you see this? Trump does everything for Putin, he puts Putin over America and our allies EVERY single time! He is America's ENEMY#1
1331294388459360258 2020-11-25 01:51:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is always wrong. Let me repeat, Trump is always wrong.
1331294214555045893 2020-11-25 01:50:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am sure it had a lot to do with all of Trumps golf trips during a crisis! Ha! Or maybe because he's doing Putin's Open Skies bidding! What a loser, traitor, lying lazy pig!
1331293873105211396 2020-11-25 01:49:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes they are so easily controlled!
1331293725155319809 2020-11-25 01:48:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This just shows America who Trump owes the $421,000,000 in debt to! Horrific! @GOP you all sold your souls to Trump and Putin huh? The world is watching and you will all be charged for your crimes!
1331293369126019072 2020-11-25 01:47:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is Putin's man right to the bitter end! This is sickening! He'd do anything for Putin. You Trumpers must not have a brain cell left!
1331293147775819776 2020-11-25 01:46:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I mean really! This is so disgusting! What true American would ever do, or stand for this filthy vicious traitorous behavior?
1331292947724328961 2020-11-25 01:45:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump's only aims in this presidency has been to loot our treasury and give Putin whatever he wants! He's a scumbag traitor!
1331292729423302658 2020-11-25 01:44:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes my comment is the only person that this benefits is Putin! As usual, Trump puts Putins wishes over Americas! He's the biggest traitor in our nations history!
1331292608879075328 2020-11-25 01:44:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes my comment is the only person that this benefits is Putin! As usual, Trump puts Putins wishes over Americas! He's the biggest traitor in our nations history!
1331292552943853580 2020-11-25 01:44:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes my comment is the only person that this benefits is Putin! As usual, Trump puts Putins wishes over Americas! He's the biggest traitor in our nations history!
1331283707110567937 2020-11-25 01:09:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I wish Trumpers would read this out loud &amp; realize how idiotic they sound! A broke crude lazy shyster who can barely form a correct sentence is the only person on the planet who knows more than all of the rest of us combined, and is right about subjects he has no background in!
1331282785710059524 2020-11-25 01:05:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So funny how the only actual  evidence of fraud and tampering has been shown time and time again to be committed by Republicans!
1331282448961900546 2020-11-25 01:04:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick You‘ll really have to find a way to deal with yourself when Biden is President!
1331281965039939587 2020-11-25 01:02:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Stock market record due to reaction to Biden’s transition! All time high! Trump is always wrong!
1331281338691891203 2020-11-25 00:59:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Right because we were under lockdowns due to their complete lack of handling COVID! Did you not see the empty streets in NYC for months? That’s just one example. So a positive affect due to an abject failure is not a success on their part! Really-wake up!
1331268405391990789 2020-11-25 00:08:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @realTuckFrumper Thanks so much for sharing!
1331267386436161538 2020-11-25 00:04:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> President Biden does all the winning!
1331248300574597131 2020-11-24 22:48:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If Trumpers can’t realize hoe Neanderthal this is....well then!
1331094690003816448 2020-11-24 12:37:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RonaldKlain @Transition46 Many of us can finally sleep again!
1331093824555376646 2020-11-24 12:34:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) on Monday said there is no proof of widespread voter fraud that could change President-elect Joe Biden’s lead in the vote counts of key battleground states and urged the nation to “resolve any outstanding questions and move forward.”
1331090552117485568 2020-11-24 12:21:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @justbreatheusa @Poke0904 @ScottMAustin @maddow You are amazing

1331088728023031808 2020-11-24 12:14:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know today has shown us a lot!
1331087709541117959 2020-11-24 12:10:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick This is who you stand for!  Putin’s servant! Right up to the very last, he’s making it easier for Russia to attack...then I truly feel ashamed for them! The ONLY person in the world who gains from this treasonous act by Trump is Putin! He does Putins bidding, not America’s!
1331087374974152704 2020-11-24 12:08:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If Trumpers truly can’t see that even up to the very last, he’s making it easier for Russia to attack...then I truly feel ashamed for them! The ONLY person in the world who gains from this treasonous act by Trump is Putin! Trumps weakening our security  &amp; giving power to Russia!
1331086893212168192 2020-11-24 12:07:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump does keep his promises, to Putin!

1331086667189530624 2020-11-24 12:06:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump only serves Putin’s demands! He’s making us weak and ripe for an attack!
1331086535740039171 2020-11-24 12:05:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If Trumpers truly can’t see that even up to the very last, he’s making it easier for Russia to attack...then I truly feel ashamed for them!

1331080623063232514 2020-11-24 11:42:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Yes and 306 was actually a higher number in my math class
1331080420386091008 2020-11-24 11:41:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you for all of your hard work already Mr President, while Trump golfed, lied, tried to ruin our country and rage tweeted!
1331080027249795072 2020-11-24 11:39:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDickelman I’ll never vote for one Republican again!
1331078309204135938 2020-11-24 11:32:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe they will finally see that Trump has done everything that Putin expected of him!
1331077564471894017 2020-11-24 11:29:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s because Joe Biden that’s us all like the human race that we are!

1331063447719727111 2020-11-24 10:33:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why dies he think he needs anyone else to make him look bad?
1331061040352735232 2020-11-24 10:24:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SweetFnLucifer Preach!
1331058148078182401 2020-11-24 10:12:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is that the future of Donnie &amp; Rudy?

1331051735834476544 2020-11-24 09:47:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ThomasDuryea5 @kylegriffin1 It’s really hard to believe how much wool he’s pulled over their eyes!
1331050378142560256 2020-11-24 09:41:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DrRobDavidson I pray people will start listening to you!
1331049774443794434 2020-11-24 09:39:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At least he will have endless conjugal visits from his Trumpers!
1331048994013929479 2020-11-24 09:36:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kenolin1 Boy it does!
1331048797431099398 2020-11-24 09:35:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Smelcher2 Ahhhhhhhhhh
1331048146911301634 2020-11-24 09:33:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Why do you cuss so much? You obviously never listen to Biden or happen to notice that hes been working non stop since the election, except for Worship on Sundays while Trump golfs!
1331047721822801921 2020-11-24 09:31:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need to get to tell Trump he‘s next!
1331047507808415752 2020-11-24 09:30:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Transition to prison is all that’s left for Trump!
1331046813365891072 2020-11-24 09:27:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Looks like Rudy’s hair dye is all over her lens
1331045539895521283 2020-11-24 09:22:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!
1331044685549277184 2020-11-24 09:19:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Why in the world will he suddenly release his taxes after this huge fraud is revealed? why 35 court cases dismissed without ANY EVIDENCE! Why do you hang onto to this in such desperation?
1331044204550696961 2020-11-24 09:17:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The only idiot who hadn’t declared Joe the winner is the one pathetically leading his followers grasping at these straws of insanity! I wish they could hear themselves.
1331043803634012161 2020-11-24 09:15:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick I’m really sorry-but your genius can barely speak a coherent sentence! Your counting on all of this outlandish rhetoric with zero evidence. You really need to read what he’s said. His IQ is borderline
1331043204184018949 2020-11-24 09:13:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick so what-it’s been recorded on bats and has had to be shipped out to record on acceptable media? I’m really truly sorry-but all this wait and see-just like Trumps taxes is absurd!
1331028893499854853 2020-11-24 08:16:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When will he stop all this wasteful spending of our hard earned dollars?
1331028371212480520 2020-11-24 08:14:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Prosecute her!
1331028101447430145 2020-11-24 08:13:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily yes she’s committed acts of sedition! Jail time!
1331027962595057666 2020-11-24 08:12:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick stay tuned for the Biden Administration
1331009020270764032 2020-11-24 06:57:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Well if they did, then all that evidence would have actually landed in court by now! I think you need to accept the facts. Not keep reading these crazy conspiracy theories!
1331008456468344844 2020-11-24 06:55:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @yes_mam7 @NickB09121299 Happy Birthday Melissa!
1331007111531270145 2020-11-24 06:49:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a waste of time! Trump needs to concede now! He's a lazy, spoiled, incompetent, cheated on 3 wives, stole from a childrens cancer charity, divereted hundreds of thousands of dollars for vets! He lies, he cheats, he steals, not to mention 24 sexual assault charges FROM TEENS!
1331005587295973381 2020-11-24 06:43:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily True patriots will enjoy watching you go to jail you traitor!
1331005337512652803 2020-11-24 06:42:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily You are paid by taxpayers! We voted, and obviously, we didn't vote for the lazy, lying, cheating, fraud who is your boss for a few more measly days. We voted for Biden, do your job you traitor!
1331004796980092937 2020-11-24 06:40:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Right, all from Chavez I suppose!
1330976942774956038 2020-11-24 04:50:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is suuuuuuch a loser!
1330976768682037250 2020-11-24 04:49:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan NO!!! Outgoing president trump doesn't "work", ever!!! Ha !
1330962075661848577 2020-11-24 03:51:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is this woman as racist as she appears?
1330961936238981128 2020-11-24 03:50:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You are a traitor! @MIGOPChair How dare you try to get their certification delayed. You are pathetic!

1330929577544310786 2020-11-24 01:41:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? More time for church, which he never goes to and Biden has never missed! More time for charity, which one the childrens cancer charity his family stole from, or the veterans fund they stole from?
1330911768575545344 2020-11-24 00:31:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you Mr. President for being a President who will care about their entire country. Hard to believe that's a novel idea!

1329819601119703041 2020-11-21 00:11:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RockyMountViews Happy Birthday! Have a wonderful day!
1329784696855736326 2020-11-20 21:52:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> PRISON!
1329784262451716098 2020-11-20 21:50:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @thomaskaine5 Worse!
1329784217048322051 2020-11-20 21:50:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you kidding me? @SenMikeShirkey you shouldn't even be going. You are a disgrace and I can't imagine the shame your family must be feeling!
1329784011502317574 2020-11-20 21:49:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She appears not only to hate Trump, but his supporters as well! Love this!
1329783412299886594 2020-11-20 21:47:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How funny, Scotland is investigating daddy for this!
1329783237426737155 2020-11-20 21:46:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @jumoffit We are so far past that point! It's just that no one will do anything about it!
1329625304432865283 2020-11-20 11:19:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? How about serving the public, isn't that the job description?
1329623628166688769 2020-11-20 11:12:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DBarkhuff Look what they've done! I'll never trust them. They've gone off the rails completely!
1329622114878574592 2020-11-20 11:06:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @THEONLYRNKATE Oh no. You cry, you vent. You feel! It's got to be so awful and painful and I am sending you warm wishes and virtual hugs!
1329621488878673922 2020-11-20 11:04:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LDbuildz You know, I didn't see that coming! Oh wait, Peter Pan! He was always a sly one!!!
1329621217628786695 2020-11-20 11:02:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump still hasn't released his taxes that he promised 5 years ago he'd do. He hasn't released his DNA which could exonerate him of rape. Paid $750 a year in taxes, his entire family is being paid by tax payers. What 12 in his circle with appointments or campaign ties arrested.
1329619938856857600 2020-11-20 10:57:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What will they come up with next, Santa Clause stole all Trumps votes and absconded to the North Pole with them?
1329619685999063040 2020-11-20 10:56:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison
1329619536514048002 2020-11-20 10:56:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So many Trumps going to jail! So many scandals, so much corruption! So much fraud! So much negligence.
1329619011898929154 2020-11-20 10:54:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh there's so much bad news for Trump! He's a traitor, liar, cheater, fraud, and his criminal actions are catching up with him in just days!
1329618751638138882 2020-11-20 10:53:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jenna Ellis can't stand Trump and thinks his supporters are bonkers!
1329618048442126341 2020-11-20 10:50:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You mean fugitives in the Oval Office!
1329617838915653632 2020-11-20 10:49:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, we are just at the start of flu season. Compare flu to COVID...  https://t.co/jCYxn9olBU
1329616055556304896 2020-11-20 10:42:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kprather88 @DrEricDing @DrLaPook @AliNouriPhD Thank you all for continuing to share, and for all of your efforts and hard work!
1329614526287896576 2020-11-20 10:36:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly!
1329614010422005760 2020-11-20 10:34:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hahahahaha when even Tucker won't back you up!
1329613907913224193 2020-11-20 10:33:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Poor Vanky can't she have China make her some pretty prison uniforms?
1329613791143882757 2020-11-20 10:33:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> All these criminals CAUGHT IN THE ACT! Can't wait to watch as another dozen go to jail!
1329613189735194625 2020-11-20 10:31:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha! What a buffoon! Dig deep into these criminal actions!
1329612404452372480 2020-11-20 10:27:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes it literally gets better each day as we watch Trump lose the same election over and over and over and over while he hides in his bitchboy bunker like a frightened little coward.
1329612113866874884 2020-11-20 10:26:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Why would I be nervous, Trump has lost the election so many times, it's hard to keep count! When he is removed from office he will be facing charges from State, Federal and International agencies!
1329610218565734402 2020-11-20 10:19:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's odd, Trumps tweet just 27 minutes ago was only about election numbers. Hasn't attended a COVID task meeting in 6 months. He's not even human anymore !
1329609025642770434 2020-11-20 10:14:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 Seriously, no words to thank you!
1329592292336918528 2020-11-20 09:07:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He certainly is!
1329591545889230848 2020-11-20 09:05:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidCornDC They are such babies!
1329591315282210818 2020-11-20 09:04:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Amy_Siskind You too!
1329590945990455298 2020-11-20 09:02:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How much money do these sick f-cks need? People are starving, being forced out of their homes. Can't pay for medicine.
1329590651701383168 2020-11-20 09:01:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DesignationSix No way to pick just one.
1329589972786143232 2020-11-20 08:58:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is the worst president in U.S. history. Pass it on!
1329589382060384259 2020-11-20 08:56:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay, lets play a game! How many State, Federal, and International criminal investigations will the Trump crime syndicate end up with in total?
1329589016145125378 2020-11-20 08:54:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @THEONLYRNKATE I am so sorry. I know the feelings. Nothing I can say makes much of a difference, except that I wish I could make it better for you. Try to think of a good memory, a favorite place, and I'll wish some peace and calm for you. You are not alone! Someone is thinking of you!
1329587937294639105 2020-11-20 08:50:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @I_Drakakis @benFranklin2018 You can't imagine life here. You really truly can't imagine it. These Trump followers live to hate. Trump has them convinced he's a good Christian, and is the leader chosen by God to save America. You have no idea what we have been through! His followers are literally insane.
1329586812000624640 2020-11-20 08:46:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock up Traitor Trump!
1329583633863208967 2020-11-20 08:33:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @juanmas53 @thereidout @jkin5022 Not! Trump has no cash left!@
1329583578880028674 2020-11-20 08:33:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> LOCK HIM UP !
1329582588693012481 2020-11-20 08:29:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? Then why did we even vote? You people are the most idiotic undemocratic ignorant selfish ghouls!
1329576618944327681 2020-11-20 08:05:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> More like Rudy knows nothing, which matches exactly what his master knows! Two old demented fools!
1329576132493111296 2020-11-20 08:03:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love how every day Biden kicks trumps ass!
1329576008866025477 2020-11-20 08:03:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @educated_educ8r We all do!
1329575894139219969 2020-11-20 08:02:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @indyruth1000 @WDCreports Thanks for the correction!
1329575049867767809 2020-11-20 07:59:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps new favorite word from his own appointed judges: Denied!
1329574934654443520 2020-11-20 07:59:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!
1329574157709807616 2020-11-20 07:55:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> TRUMP &amp; GOP STOP KILLING US !
1329573984309043200 2020-11-20 07:55:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets remember who you Trumpers are cheering for, a man with 24 sexual assault claims against him, including teens from Miss Teen USA, and a 13 year old rape victim!!!!! A man who has numerous photos with PEDO Epstein. Epstein lived at Mar A Lago.
1329573027194007553 2020-11-20 07:51:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davthestudent11 @balleralert Of course we can do better! This is appalling, and I am so ashamed that this happened to you!
1329572659961737220 2020-11-20 07:49:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lindsey will be in jail right along with Trump!
1329572242385235972 2020-11-20 07:48:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy I know one thing Trump does well, LOSE! What a fool! He's making his poor base suffer thinking he can lie his way into a 2nd term. Shameful! His next term will be a prison term!
1329571883747074049 2020-11-20 07:46:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @jentaub Good!
1329571814134181890 2020-11-20 07:46:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course! The only fraud is the fraud we've seen time after time by the GOP!
1329571482389909507 2020-11-20 07:45:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @donnalove0 Me!
1329571034492772352 2020-11-20 07:43:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @jkcarnah Is it really worth you career, the stain of permanent shame on your family and going to jail? Really?
1329570610058579971 2020-11-20 07:41:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What? He's such an idiot! Why do we have to put up with this fool?
1329570223528108033 2020-11-20 07:40:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They can't! They've lost all ability to think for themselves!
1329570026341474305 2020-11-20 07:39:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Words are not enough to express our gratitude for your unwavering courage and honesty. My thoughts were after this election was over, we'd be rejoicing. Trump is a horrific stain on our country, and our democracy. If you can't see the extremely blatant acts of corruption...
1329568991703130116 2020-11-20 07:35:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @andyinTOONT Apparently!
1329513656112046080 2020-11-20 03:55:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 110% The entire world knows it!
1329513021559992322 2020-11-20 03:53:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me either! NEVER not one could ever convince me that this would not happen under their watch again!
1329512879171702794 2020-11-20 03:52:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a dreadful little man! Scared Donnie? Whose in the basement now?
1329512554801065984 2020-11-20 03:51:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The only thing Trump excels at is destruction!
1329512298826911749 2020-11-20 03:50:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amazing, and how many groups like this are speaking out in support of this danger to our nation? Thank you Amnesty International!
1329511605470703616 2020-11-20 03:47:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets hope Dominion sues them!
1329511026233118723 2020-11-20 03:45:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But boy, antifa and BLM are scary, right?
1329510788994920448 2020-11-20 03:44:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Outrageous!
1329509362600194048 2020-11-20 03:38:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> THIS!
1329509163869884422 2020-11-20 03:37:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets see how many ways Jenna Ellis calls Trump a blithering idiot:
1329508595986206722 2020-11-20 03:35:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GovWhitmer
1329508287079997442 2020-11-20 03:34:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wait, how does Hunter Biden's lap top fit into all this?
1329507398004989963 2020-11-20 03:30:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you imagine what our allies are thinking? They are probably wondering if they should even associate with us anymore! Hang in there Canada, we love you!
1329489856708435970 2020-11-20 02:20:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That means they are all against you @GSAEmily
1329489597013823489 2020-11-20 02:19:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nope that’s what little is left of his brain matter oozing out!
1329488725156487178 2020-11-20 02:16:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jenna staring at him like she wants to lick all that scuzzy sweat oozing down his face!
1329487821925724161 2020-11-20 02:12:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Feel real sorry for that lame 12%
1329485367167365121 2020-11-20 02:03:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #NotFromGeorgia
1329482380042784770 2020-11-20 01:51:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are they getting the $130,000 Stormy Daniels rate?
1329481283999772672 2020-11-20 01:46:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MarkHerringVA Good news! Keep people safe from COVID
1329458880905154567 2020-11-20 00:17:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love this! The Chamber of Commerce CEO-Trump should NOT delay the transition to Biden!
1329458529938395136 2020-11-20 00:16:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HelenFeathers23 Absolutely!
1329458351156195328 2020-11-20 00:15:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick I am using dead Americans because they are dead! COVID is not political! That's why we will easily hit 500,000 deaths because you don't understand it's a deadly virus! Wake up! The only thing that is the slightest bit political about it is that Trump does NOTHING about it!
1329452811495550979 2020-11-19 23:53:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, Joe and Kamala are holding meetings, and doing what they can while this sissy is in hiding and tweeting!
1329452355033686018 2020-11-19 23:51:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is so great at losing! I like watching him lose this election over and over and over and over!
1329450759667257348 2020-11-19 23:45:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh Trump will be indicted, on both Federal and State levels. He will be damn lucky if he doesn't end up in court at the Hague as well! His time is coming! Prison is the only term this horrific monster will be serving in the future!
1329450499632992260 2020-11-19 23:44:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick You keep telling yourself that! You think 250,000 FELLOW DEAD AMERICAN'S is what, reason to throw Trump a party? What is the number it would take for you to open your eyes?
1329449249180889091 2020-11-19 23:39:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a lowlife Trump is! Really Trumpers? You are disgusting! You follow a man without a soul. A corrupt racist sexual assaulter.
1329449015260409856 2020-11-19 23:38:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> USA TODAY: Experts say leadership matters!  Joe Biden, who wears face coverings &amp; socially distances while in public, has a dramatically different plan for tackling COVID. He has pledged to put scientists behind the microphone &amp; make coronavirus testing widely available and free.
1329447571664801794 2020-11-19 23:32:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So who is the expert we should have listened to? The idiot who spouted with zero proof that 15 cases would go down to zero, or Dr. Fauci who predicted exactly what has happened, even after Trump knew &amp; hid the truth early on? A Dr. with background in infectious disease, or dumbo?
1329446188127571968 2020-11-19 23:27:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such a brave hero to speak up for American's!
1329446004815486977 2020-11-19 23:26:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump was, is, and always will be a racist!
1329445770764951556 2020-11-19 23:25:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I wonder how much of his "defense fund" contributions are going to a new rug?
1329445016675233795 2020-11-19 23:22:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Also thank Trump and his criminal associates for letting it run rampant!
1329444867014074370 2020-11-19 23:22:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awe, poor Trump team...dropping and losing lawsuits like flies!
1329444772935831553 2020-11-19 23:21:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, they are so cowardly, they live through his ugliness only to hate others!
1329444437710286850 2020-11-19 23:20:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We the American people are saddled with a lazy incompetent ignorant fool who has gone into hiding while we are facing overwhelmed ICU's, and nurses so exhausted and overworked they are going on strike! Trumps America!
1329444025892528133 2020-11-19 23:18:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock her up!
1329443598610337796 2020-11-19 23:17:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Follow the money Mr. Gaetz! Especially the PPE money that the Trump crime syndicate and associates stole!
1329443381303513089 2020-11-19 23:16:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes all of Trumps voter fraud, intimidation, and lies are real!
1329443195206426626 2020-11-19 23:15:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is not only a dangerous pathological liar &amp; sociopath,  he's a big baby whose been in hiding basically for 2 weeks now! He's not been at a COVID task force meeting for 5 months! He's an incompetent lazy pig!
1329442876829405192 2020-11-19 23:14:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick No what's sick and disturbing are the people like you who continue to play this down because instead of relying on science, you rely on a moron. Why didn't it disappear on Nov 4th like he said? Why, I'll tell you why! He lies all the time! He lies about everything. You are a fool
1329442606317772805 2020-11-19 23:13:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick What's wrong with you? 250,000 DEAD AMERICAN BROTHERS &amp; SISTERS. First of all the fatality rate is 2.16%. That doesn't take into account people who will live with major health conditions for the rest of their lives! If the total population got it, then over 7 million would die!
1329441369161601025 2020-11-19 23:08:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow! I hope they get sued for every last dollar!
1329440612865761285 2020-11-19 23:05:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump needs to be arrested! Enough with his election interference! This is madness! He's in hiding, we are going to be facing the most grim, deadly long winter, and he cares nothing about that! NOTHING!
1329440317418901505 2020-11-19 23:04:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock them up !
1329440144047419395 2020-11-19 23:03:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 110% Yes! They all need to face charges! Where is Trump? He's hiding while we are headed into a dark dark winter. We need help! We need relief! We need PPP for health care workers. He needs to RESIGN if all he can do is hide like a baby! #TrumpResignTODAY @realDonaldTrump
1329439559151738884 2020-11-19 23:01:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where is Trump? This is absurd! We are going into a winter of death and despair. He needs to get to work, or get the F-ck out! This is unacceptable. His hiding like a scared child while we are facing the largest crisis in our nations history!
1329425838106959872 2020-11-19 22:06:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock Her Up so relieved to see we are holding criminals accountable!

1329269116738433024 2020-11-19 11:43:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What ignorant morons! Darwin is all I can say at this point!
1329268022423531520 2020-11-19 11:39:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Way to go! America appreciates your hard work!

1329232271203737601 2020-11-19 09:17:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> In her brain apparently
1329232213863518209 2020-11-19 09:17:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily you are a stupid pathetic woman. You are causing DEATH to Americans-sign the letter so adults can get to work!
1329231929124794368 2020-11-19 09:16:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JayDouglasDean @greenhousenyt @Burrite this is beyond appalling
1329231826838319105 2020-11-19 09:15:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Resistors we need to Boycott Tyson!
1329231453171949569 2020-11-19 09:14:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> BREAKING NEWS:Jenna Ellis SLAMS Trump as an "idiot," who was "boorish and arrogant," and a "bully" whose words could not be trusted as factually accurate. She called comments he made about women "disgusting," and suggested he was not a "real Christian!
1329196416586178562 2020-11-19 06:54:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Duh! You can buy a gun from anywhere, there is absolutely no violation of the right to bear arms. We all want COVID to end, but damn it. The ones who have been doing all we can since March, have to put up with this shit!
1329195121980690441 2020-11-19 06:49:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Killer! That's fine, GOP loves to kill people!
1329182867436539918 2020-11-19 06:01:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> WTF? At this point, I hope you all get COVID. That's it. That's the tweet.
1329181330589048835 2020-11-19 05:54:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sure, lets have a state thrown out or not counted in an American election in 2020 because Trump is a demented old fool !
1329181181477269506 2020-11-19 05:54:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jake Tapper saying Trumps ridiculous conspiracy theories about Dominion voting are simply Tin Foil hat nonsense! Trumpers you have got to open your eyes!!!
1329168687107088385 2020-11-19 05:04:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are rampant with COVID and Trump hasn't attended a COVID 19 task meeting in 5 months! If you are dumb enough to think this man gives a fig if you live or die in America-you'd be dead wrong!
1329163229101236233 2020-11-19 04:43:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The honorable and brave @NewYorkStateAG!
1329163043943624706 2020-11-19 04:42:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's like McTrump!
1329162600324734977 2020-11-19 04:40:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well said Cory!
1329162107280105473 2020-11-19 04:38:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote and make sure billionaires like #CrookedKelly don't cause more problems just like Trump! We don't need these arrogant elitists in our Government!
1329153724384751619 2020-11-19 04:05:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pathetic! @dougducey protection and investigation into this! Why has everyone just stopped doing sensible things?
1329153394183966723 2020-11-19 04:03:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CaslerNoel @huntadelia62 @realDonaldTrump Can you imagine being the parents of one of the Miss Teen contestants?
1329150600521584640 2020-11-19 03:52:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's an understatement!
1329150398901477377 2020-11-19 03:52:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But wait, Trump said it would disappear Nov 4th, so I guess you must be fake news. His supporters believe his dumb ass downright stupid hunches over science. How can you be that dumb?
1329149764085145602 2020-11-19 03:49:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @rogertansey Thank you for caring! Hope your condition stays the same!
1329149478448852992 2020-11-19 03:48:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is stupid and lazy. That's why he always fails!
1329149017947770881 2020-11-19 03:46:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily
1329148829480968197 2020-11-19 03:45:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well Resistors, at least we have GA in the bag. Since all Dems are dripping with wealth, about 450,000 of us are moving to GA to vote in the Runoff! We have nothing better to do, thankfully so we have GA in the bag!
1329148136879771648 2020-11-19 03:43:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily You are a horrid person. I hope your entire family is deeply ashamed at the death toll your actions will have on our nation! Your helping strain an already overworked healthcare system. You are disgusting!
1329147848710115332 2020-11-19 03:41:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #CrookedKelly
1329147754396995586 2020-11-19 03:41:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> TRUMP IS A MURDERER!
1329147610372960267 2020-11-19 03:40:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> By blocking the Biden Transition and ignoring communications with them, the MAGA regime’s deliberate effort to create chaos before a real President takes over isn’t just deadly and dangerous, it’s treason and sedition. Oh, but Emily Murphy @GSAEmily and her feelings? DO YOUR JOB.
1329147114333597696 2020-11-19 03:39:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love this investigation of the ENTIRE Trump administration! Folks, CREW has been keeping a great tally of crimes!!!
1329146854496481283 2020-11-19 03:37:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? It's just that simple? If everyone could wear a mask, we could contain this until the vaccine? Who could have guessed?
1329146561360785409 2020-11-19 03:36:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> PPP FRAUD investigate it fully!
1329146381647433728 2020-11-19 03:36:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG these F-cking idiots! Our healthcare workers are going through enough trying to treat us, and you believe ONE ASS-OLE over all of them worldwide? You Trumpers are sick in the head. You need to wake up. Trump lies non stop. These are hero's you are degrading and attacking!
1329146048074412035 2020-11-19 03:34:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When does his investigation start?
1329145758940078082 2020-11-19 03:33:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets hope they do, you know there is NO oversight on the $$$
1329145637233946626 2020-11-19 03:33:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She's going to mangle the vaccine, and cause MASSIVE DEATH @GSAEmily Grow up, you work for the American people whom you are apparently trying to recklessly KILL!
1329145456329445379 2020-11-19 03:32:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily
1329145344475717632 2020-11-19 03:31:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps tweets have always been impotent!
1329145238330482689 2020-11-19 03:31:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sounds like harassment! Hope they file!
1329145088979718146 2020-11-19 03:30:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @InhellJourney Isn't it absurd? I went to 2 POST OFFICES in my area and no masks by the postal employees!!! Except the one who bothered, but had it under her nose...
1329144897996263426 2020-11-19 03:30:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GSAEmily YOUR APPALLING actions are going to cause the death of more innocent American's! Can't wait til we have time to get to all the criminals in this horrific administration! You are a worthless human causing DEATH!
1329144528880754699 2020-11-19 03:28:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Many, like who? What evidence? Many? That's just dumb parroted Trump speak!
1329144220599406594 2020-11-19 03:27:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You sick F-cking Trumpers. Enough with death threats for people doing their jobs! You are so unAmerican! I hope each and every one is investigated and charges result @FBI This is outrageous!
1329141499066544130 2020-11-19 03:16:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Trumpers, we have a virus raging so out of control, that nurses are on strike. Your lazy ignorant do nothing fool assured you dummies that it would disappear on Nov 4th. HE'S A DUMB ASS WEAK LAZY INCOMPETENT LIAR! Glad you like his brand of death!
1329141093351510018 2020-11-19 03:15:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well if any of those amazingly hard working folks need a donation to a legal defense fund, count me in!
1329140506513772547 2020-11-19 03:12:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I agree! All true patriots who soulless Trump stomped into the ground. He will pay!
1329139347476672515 2020-11-19 03:08:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a pathetic little loser! He never thinks of his country. It's always about him.
1329139135911776259 2020-11-19 03:07:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is a monster!
1329138739323473928 2020-11-19 03:05:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> THIS is Trumps America: The death toll is currently at 250,000 - the highest in the world!
1329138064199970816 2020-11-19 03:03:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> JUST IN: Trump is compromised by foreign dictators!
1329137856107909121 2020-11-19 03:02:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha 1 for 27, so much winning!
1329137523910717440 2020-11-19 03:00:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right the Trump crime syndicate steals donations, they don't make donations!
1329137099795214342 2020-11-19 02:59:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But what would he do, if he couldn't fire prominent officials by Tweet?
1329137011136016385 2020-11-19 02:58:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you for recognizing others service and sacrifice during this awful time Mr. President! This is what leadership looks like!
1329136817476673536 2020-11-19 02:58:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So why does Steve Bannon still have a FB account?
1329136677781123080 2020-11-19 02:57:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Either way, they don't stand a chance!
1329136352596783111 2020-11-19 02:56:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #MurphyBreakdown is trending because @GSAEmily WHO WORKS FOR THE AMERICAN CITIZENS is reportedly feeling the pressure of choosing between doing the right thing or doing Trump's bidding. Emily, the choice is easy! Choose democracy! Sign the papers!
1329136239761559560 2020-11-19 02:55:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @okourgiantakis Wow! NC has a mask mandate...I can go to the Post Office, Bank, and tons of other places where not only do the patrons not have masks on, the employees don't. Or if one bothers to have one, it's only around their mouth, or their chin. When they talk, they can't have it on!
1329123121161441280 2020-11-19 02:03:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's the official goal of America!
1329122568801021953 2020-11-19 02:01:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!!! When will Rudy get the he's fired Tweet?
1329122229427318785 2020-11-19 02:00:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Masks help save lives! Cowards are pathetic who refuse to do that! Multi-layer cloth masks block release of exhaled respiratory particles into the environment, along with the microorganisms these particles carry.
1329120570366177293 2020-11-19 01:53:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But come on Trump, I am sure you can find a few thousand vote irregularities that will have ZERO impact on a 6 Million vote lead. Might want to focus on taking 15 COVID cases all the way down to 11 MILLION!
1329120145797750787 2020-11-19 01:51:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, and where is your proof of that? The Republican Governor said he would prosecute anyone who tried to do that. This is beyond pathetic! What crazy corny conspiracy theory is next?
1329119368442220544 2020-11-19 01:48:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Complete and utter selfishness! Imagine not doing such a little thing to help others during a world wide pandemic. These are nothing but pathetic cowards who lack the courage to put on a mask!
1329114415862525959 2020-11-19 01:29:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Really? As if life isn’t hard enough knowing that 1.2 Americans died every minute yesterday? Trump is a lying worthless lazy incompetent man. Why in the world can’t you see that? He’s tweeting and nothing else...
1329113946473836544 2020-11-19 01:27:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @educated_educ8r Sweet Jesus that means that more than one American is dying each and every minute from COVID-19
1329109510263345153 2020-11-19 01:09:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly what in the world do you expect them to find? They've found next to nothing but a few errors which in the size of this election is actually surprisingly LOW!
1329109294051155973 2020-11-19 01:08:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Voting twice in the same election is illegal.  But Mr. Trump’s suggestion that people should vote twice is one he has discussed privately with aides in recent weeks amid concerns he is depressing turnout among his supporters by raising alarms about the security of mail-in voting.
1329108885106520066 2020-11-19 01:07:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump was, is and will always be a racist POS!

Saving most of his venom for the majority-Black Philadelphia, Giuliani depicted the City of Brotherly Love as a hotbed of corruption &amp; ground zero of the shenanigans that he alleged. “This doesn’t happen in an honest place,” Giuliani fumed.

Trump went golfing Saturday and Sunday for 8 hours and he did nothing yesterday and plans on doing nothing today. Absolutely unforgivable.

Last month the COVID debt was est 16 TRILLION
1328433070781902862 2020-11-17 04:21:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps nothing but a pathetic liar and a coward!
1328432581927440387 2020-11-17 04:19:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shhh the President with a brain and a plan is speaking!
1328431220603105281 2020-11-17 04:14:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think about the Republicans outrage if Biden did anything as insanely dumb as that! Trumpers-you really can't even admit that was about the dumbest most unsafe thing any president has ever done? No, you can't see that through the tinfoil?

1328421269633687552 2020-11-17 03:34:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So ANOTHER LIE or completely baseless claim. Trump you have been soundly and legally defeated. You are a LOSER and you need to accept that and concede, so real leaders can help America out of your disaster!

1328420223515561986 2020-11-17 03:30:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Actually the president is the one who isn't capable of doing his job. Let him go golf again, and tweet. That's all he can do, and I am sure he cheats at golf, and well you know his tweets all get warning labels, so all in all he sucks!

1328385558696124418 2020-11-17 01:12:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Too Funny! Minutes before the hearing! Ha!!! Were they scared of facing criminal charges?
1328385411983478790 2020-11-17 01:12:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why not lock him up? Lets see, I wonder which group of his domestic terrorists will plan to kidnap and execute him first?

1328383381797789698 2020-11-17 01:04:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jesus really? How many people are dying a day and being hospitalized? Great to see a lost cause is this ignorant buffoon of a presidents priority!
1328379286336794627 2020-11-17 00:47:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @educated_educ8r So true, imagine, your money or your life? Sad.
1328376958510575616 2020-11-17 00:38:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess what? Ignorant petty Trump lied and the virus is still here and on the rampage! He needs to get the fuck out of the WH now so actual competent people can help America fight this deadly world wide pandemic! Imagine pulling out of the WHO, that's his dumbass response!
1328376592184250376 2020-11-17 00:37:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He knew and lied-so no. It needs to be pre-meditated murder!
1328376489281286144 2020-11-17 00:36:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @realDonaldTrump you are such a waste of our time. You are so ignorant, selfish and lazy. Get out of there so grown ups can actually do the work you were never able to grow into! You care nothing about any of us. You are pathetic and horrific!
1328376182421790720 2020-11-17 00:35:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, so he's saying just get it, we can treat it. Who cares that you might die, overwhelm the already exhausted health care workers...these people are criminals!
1328376002628775936 2020-11-17 00:34:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you! Finally some spine! I never thought leaders could be such cowards, look at the suffering our nation is going through right now! The 25th Amendment today.

1328374947165691905 2020-11-17 00:30:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd say with the Pandemic Playbook, and an emergency pandemic response team that Trump ignored and destroyed...it's his responsibility! He said it was Obama's for H1N1! He's a lazy incompetent arrogant fool! Who still refuses to offer help to our country!
1328334214203371522 2020-11-16 21:48:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Invoke the 25th TODAY! Not a movie folks! This is real life! This is trumps America where he is so lazy and incompetent and pathetic he does nothing to help any of us!

It's past time for @senatemajldr McConnell and @VP Pence to step in, act like adults and stop this nonsense. It's dangerous.   Americans are exhausted with the constant chaos.

1328105321592745984 2020-11-16 06:39:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now when is DeJoy going to prison?

1328100094831366151 2020-11-16 06:18:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Actually, my concern is for others, I’m alive, but 250,000 of our fellow Americans are not! Almost one American dies every minute from this virus-if that’s so “insigincant to you, then you are simply a pathetic excuse for a human being.

1328077218136907777 2020-11-16 04:47:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What does scientific common sense have to do with fear mongering? By mid week we will be reporting 200,000 cases a day!
1328072951435042816 2020-11-16 04:30:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock her up! This administration is sickening!
1328067583388639235 2020-11-16 04:09:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shame that Trump has brought this upon so many! Wyoming state @GOP Rep. Roy Edwards said COVID was overblown for political reasons &amp; would vanish after the election. On Oct 18, COVID swept through his church infecting many. Oct 31, he was intubated. Nov 2 he died from COVID.
1328067249991725056 2020-11-16 04:08:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mansoortshams Thank you for your service! My dad was a Marine in Vietnam-and unfortunately had to deal with a lot of hatred when he came home, with a cane and shrapnel up and down the right side of his body.

1327992963775991810 2020-11-15 23:12:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So let me get this straight-America is at 11 MILLION cases of COVID now-and the dishonorable Trump is golfing all day again today-just as he dud yesterday? You know how they say the guilty sleep like the dead?
1327991952009203712 2020-11-15 23:08:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick She seems awful-Alicia Garza is an American civil rights activist &amp; writer known for co-founding the international Black Lives Matter movement. She has organized around issues of health, student services &amp; rights, rights for domestic workers, ending police brutality, anti-racism
1327991006390837259 2020-11-15 23:05:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Do you support the proud little boys? I never see you complaining about them.
1327990123250802688 2020-11-15 23:01:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is a pathetic lazy human! This is the only priority and he‘d rather tweet, golf, and incite domestic terrorism!
1327989018441768960 2020-11-15 22:57:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Prosecute Trump
1327988945674776578 2020-11-15 22:56:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KickBrainTumors Yes, I know someone who passed away from it.

1327988530476363778 2020-11-15 22:55:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Comparison America-one is a lazy, selfish, igmorant, lying, cheating fool whose never done an honest days work in his life! Biden has been working non stop and led by example during his entire campaign to make Americans safe again!
1327987932943233024 2020-11-15 22:52:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Who exactly is this mysterious ANTIFA? Are you so racist that you hate the Black Lives Matter movement?
1327984684098330625 2020-11-15 22:39:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Trumps lies as the leader of our nation have significant consequences. If his statements were true, didn’t incite violence, and hate-then there would be no issue. Dangerous violent speech is not protected!

1327978432958001154 2020-11-15 22:15:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Prison for life is the only term he will be serving!
1327978146956779526 2020-11-15 22:13:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He needs to be imprisoned for life for his crimes against humanity!

1327973637337587713 2020-11-15 21:56:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JodiDoering My heart goes out to you! No words can express how much you are truly appreciated by those of us who get it!

1327803134031392768 2020-11-15 10:38:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Odd that they’d actually leave out who started it! Oh thats right...they provoke, lie, blame others...
1327802295774572544 2020-11-15 10:35:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’d say there goes a bunch of sorry as Trumpers!

1327797656450699265 2020-11-15 10:16:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Trump is a rapist with ZERO redeeming qualities!
1327793702534864896 2020-11-15 10:01:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course we all know Trumps a HUGE PEDO!
1327792947031642113 2020-11-15 09:58:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @klkc2009 Ha! Watching TV and tweeting!

1327792174566674437 2020-11-15 09:54:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe he will hire the Quality Inn law firm.
1327791242374164482 2020-11-15 09:51:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s why Trump being the genius that he has decided to put him in charge and fire everyone else!
1327790872323305472 2020-11-15 09:49:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Come on, he knows better-look at how he held his rallies! He believes in science. It’s why he and Obama left Trump not only a pandemic playbook but also a pandemic response team that Trump very ignorantly and recklessly disbanded.
1327790353211158549 2020-11-15 09:47:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Three you’d be wrong! Clinton‘s behavior was bad! Unfortunately it paved the way for the most corrupt lying cheating con man in history to be elected!

1327788245015465984 2020-11-15 09:39:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just so surprised! You mean trumps not focusing on a pandemic? What is that 10 months in a row?
1327788123561078784 2020-11-15 09:38:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh don’t worry-we will never forget!
1327784606335184896 2020-11-15 09:24:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> CLAIM: The US Army raided the Frankfurt office of the Spanish election software company Scytl to seize servers that had evidence of voting irregularities in the  US  election.  False-The  Army &amp; Scytl told AP the claim isn’t  true. Scytl doesn’t have offices or servers in Germany

1327781885628604417 2020-11-15 09:14:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, where was it prophesied that a sexual assaulter PEDO, unfaithful husband, lying cheat would serve two terms as a president?
1327780596966432769 2020-11-15 09:08:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How much of a Liar is @mtgreenee And more importantly what is this majorly wussy weird ass in room work out that she’s doing?
1327778955710099456 2020-11-15 09:02:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As if there’s a horrific waste of brain space could ever tell anything that resembled the truth!
1327777356904353793 2020-11-15 08:56:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He knew, he lied! Trump needs to be charged with Pre-meditated murder
1327777114414788608 2020-11-15 08:55:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OK that’s how I ‘d love to go out! Hope you had a lot of fun playing golf today you fucking moron @reaDonaldjTrump

1327773917222723584 2020-11-15 08:42:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She’s actually more blatantly racist than Trump! What a sick pig!
1327773206342721542 2020-11-15 08:39:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joansths1 @Irishladylisa @krazyheartss @BillyCorben @AmandiOnAir If only someone could actually answer that question!
1327771889406775296 2020-11-15 08:34:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As Alex said-Holy Fuck what a racist pig!
1327770915451658241 2020-11-15 08:30:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump LOSES again! What a loser!
1327769879534039045 2020-11-15 08:26:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RockyMountViews WTF? They actually think that Trump cares about one other human being on the planet other than himself?
1327766658707038213 2020-11-15 08:13:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The Trump losses just keep growing and growing and growing and growing!
1327766393358577669 2020-11-15 08:12:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Traitors!
1327765768763813888 2020-11-15 08:10:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The only term Trump is serving in 2021 is a PRISON TERM!
1327764710343708679 2020-11-15 08:05:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mcuban @johnlegend @jonshonric @andraydomise I think that Joe and Kamala will protect us and fight for us, not their own selfish interests
1327764470207229953 2020-11-15 08:04:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks to Trump-will our allies stand by us in times of trouble? . "What many Europeans learned from Trump especially is that the American president can claim their foreign policy agenda, no matter what the American people say. CNN
1327740680786030594 2020-11-15 06:30:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kurteichenwald Nope
1327726394433007616 2020-11-15 05:33:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> In 1991, Trump Plaza was fined $200,000 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for moving African American and female employees from craps tables in order to accommodate high roller Robert LiButti, a mob figure and alleged John Gotti associate
1327725997312118788 2020-11-15 05:32:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps fraud started in the 70’s-still going strong today! In 1973 was accused by the Justice Dept of violating the Fair Housing Act! Black "testers" sent to more than 1/2 a dozen buildings &amp; were denied apartments, while  a  white “tester” would then be offered an apartment!
1327725016516063234 2020-11-15 05:28:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps nothing but a lying  chesting fraud! Trump University litigation-November 2016, Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle the litigation-FRAUD!
1327724568082079744 2020-11-15 05:26:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps worthless!  His legal cases include contract disputes, defamation claims, allegations of sexual harassment. His companies have been involved in  OVER  100 tax disputes, &amp; NY State  Dept  of Taxation has obtained tax liens against Trump properties for nonpayment of taxes.
1327723376740327426 2020-11-15 05:21:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> President Trump's Twitter habit puts him keystrokes away from breaking laws  https://t.co/WG2L2CKrtn via @usatoday

1327691946345762816 2020-11-15 03:16:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Worthless pig! Don’t forget that Trump was also fined $2 million dollars for diverting money from a VETERANS Fundraiser to his campaign!

1327690479086030853 2020-11-15 03:10:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If only we had some sound  advise we could have followed! USA Today South Dakota welcomed 100,000’s of visitors this summer, declined to cancel the state fair &amp; still doesn't require masks. Now hospitals are filling up &amp; their COVID-19 death rate is among the worst in the world.

1327481755104911360 2020-11-14 13:21:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What about people’s (and I mean idiot Trumpers) freedoms to not wear a mask so that they can continue to kill others?  This is so unpatriotic

1327443487667707904 2020-11-14 10:49:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I ran over a squirrel today, which means which means, based on our great Constitution, I win the State of Pennsylvania!" Oh, on second glance it was actually the toupee fomerly known as the overpriced $70,000 we all know it’s a wig, easily and commonly mistaken for a squirrel 🐿

1327431318217613313 2020-11-14 10:01:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Simply the best! Better than all the rest!
1327430964470026240 2020-11-14 09:59:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump‘s desperation is REALLY showing! These people are such a joke!
1327428881855418368 2020-11-14 09:51:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick All of the sudden you are on abortion-when we are discussing COVID? You are a sad pathetic person. When this Trump haze of hate is finally lifted from your eyes and you see him for what he is-you’ll be really ashamed of all of this!
1327428243113259008 2020-11-14 09:48:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s rich-just lying to the foolish Trump base to keep them agitated while she actually wears a mask! What a lying shameful hypocrite she is!

1327425075923066880 2020-11-14 09:36:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Yes like the end of your tweet where insane dems promote fear...no actually, we promote science. It’s a deadly virus. Trump is a deadly idiot by ignoring science. He said it would disappear on Nob. 4th-how’s that for your brilliant leader? He lies, he’s stupid as a box of rocks!
1327424380369047552 2020-11-14 09:33:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy Trump really dumbs them down, doesn’t he?
1327423440022892544 2020-11-14 09:29:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick yes you did!  You said it was not serious for over 99% of the population! You downplayed this several times-I can retweet all if you prefer!
1327421821688410113 2020-11-14 09:23:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Trump has done nothing to contain this virus! 15 cases to almost 11 Million is worse than nothing
1327420649124585473 2020-11-14 09:18:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps dire rejection!

1327412718865936391 2020-11-14 08:47:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps a criminal and the investigations are going to be numerous!
1327412291508334592 2020-11-14 08:45:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes but how ashamed are you when he calls it Kung Flu? Such a graceful, tactful man....
1327411420271620096 2020-11-14 08:41:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why do we have to pick one?

1327409795868004353 2020-11-14 08:35:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s always worse and worse with Trump
1327409689676685313 2020-11-14 08:35:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why ask if you can self pardon yourself if you aren’t guilty?
1327409537268264960 2020-11-14 08:34:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are Trumps tax returns he promised in 2015?
1327409297924427776 2020-11-14 08:33:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No I like Presidents who aren’t idiots, who believe in science, who would lead us from 15 COVID cases to zero, not 10.6 million. Who dint have three wives that he cheated on ALL three, that graciously concedes a LOST election, instead of having a childish 9 day meltdown!

1327395714834591754 2020-11-14 07:39:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like Presidents who don’t call a serious virus a ridiculous racist name like Kung Flu!

1327316970539249667 2020-11-14 02:26:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PoliticsUncens1 As long as the proceeds went to COVID victim families!
1327316409509146624 2020-11-14 02:24:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did you get the impression he’d actually maybe take a day out of his busy week of meltdowns to do his job?
1327315186357821440 2020-11-14 02:19:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Tin foil hat!
1327314724434944001 2020-11-14 02:17:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Says the loser!
1327314237585289218 2020-11-14 02:15:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great! Trumpers if you are really this stupid, and think there are no HUGE RED WARNING FLAG  national security issues right now-how do you even dress yourselves without assistance
1327313513602289665 2020-11-14 02:12:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What idiots! Stop wasting time in the middle of a pandemic! Can Trump and his supporters actually focus on what matters?
1327313170134945796 2020-11-14 02:11:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @thomaskaine5 Pretty much the same. We have a leader who doesn’t believe in science and he’s convinced 72 million others to follow his stupidity!
1327312933106356227 2020-11-14 02:10:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AJDelgado13 More like Duuuuuuhhhhhhlusional! Ha
1327312675752308741 2020-11-14 02:09:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So what’s being done about rapid teating, tracing and surveillance
1327312432436535296 2020-11-14 02:08:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump finally realizes the Biden victory cannot be overcome! Sorry game, he’s a really slow learner!
1327311631089602562 2020-11-14 02:05:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes-if you commits fraud, perjury, or any other crimes for Trump-they are real crimes!
1327311357679722501 2020-11-14 02:04:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What idiot children we have running this country!
1327311149826760706 2020-11-14 02:03:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks Trump-just such a new joy you provide us with every day! Shame the corruption is so bad that the only person who would act and respond to the daily intelligence briefings-Biden...has stopped getting them. Love to all the Trumpers who have completely destroyed our country!
1327310263314489347 2020-11-14 02:00:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess it really should be called the Trump virus!
1327310164844797952 2020-11-14 01:59:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If he can‘t act like an adult, then he’s unfit to lead! Invoke the 25th!
1327276313523216385 2020-11-13 23:45:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As well he should be!
1327251510691057664 2020-11-13 22:06:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @nps_rrt Oh I just can't imagine how difficult this is. I have been hugless, wear my mask, follow all the rules to help you all, and to help our country! But what you are doing is so above and beyond!
1327248687052058624 2020-11-13 21:55:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Says the criminal!
1327248315361136642 2020-11-13 21:53:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are greedy and spineless! What a horrid combination!
1327248070493532160 2020-11-13 21:52:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets remember to give a huge thank you to our health care workers for making it through another week! These people should be cherished, and loved by all!
1327247740288561157 2020-11-13 21:51:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't worry, we won't forget their traitorous acts!
1327247334942633988 2020-11-13 21:49:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amazing that Trumpers think this is a leader! He's so pathetic!
1327245085143142401 2020-11-13 21:41:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha! #TrumpRun!
1327245018248130560 2020-11-13 21:40:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love watching him lose and then lose again!
1327244509575569408 2020-11-13 21:38:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'll say this again, thank you for your service then, and your continued service now. You are a true hero, and words can never say how grateful this nation is for your courage and sacrifice!
1327244289479471106 2020-11-13 21:37:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sad that the Commander in Chief can send over 50 tweets yesterday, but none addressing this loss!
1327243957424689154 2020-11-13 21:36:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump has proven over and over again that he doesn't care about our nation! He's a disgrace! Invoke the 25th TODAY!
1327243648837308416 2020-11-13 21:35:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When? This is outrageous!
1327242663943401473 2020-11-13 21:31:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, that's why a 13 year old accused them both of rape!
1327242330672418822 2020-11-13 21:30:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We've known that all along! He is out of money because he has no common sense, no intelligence, and he is going to be not only arrested, but will be in prison for life!
1327242091030835200 2020-11-13 21:29:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @seanhannity You are horrific and I hope you are sued! 150,000 NEW CASES A DAY and you are mocking this? You are a murderer!
1327241862726422530 2020-11-13 21:28:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because they are one in the same! It's so much fun to see Russia own the conservs.

1327241148419739654 2020-11-13 21:25:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What does Trump pay attention to? America? No! Himself? That's it folks!
1327240730625134593 2020-11-13 21:23:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @fromMA Yes, Trump is a loser! Happy Friday!

1327239236995706884 2020-11-13 21:17:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There is someone crazy, lazy, greedy, corrupt and UNFIT in the Whitehouse! 25th Amendment TODAY!
1327239101297422338 2020-11-13 21:17:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @okourgiantakis He has been for the last 4 years!
1327238967809466369 2020-11-13 21:16:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then why all the lies from Trump? Oh, that's right! Just like COVID disappeared on Nov 4th! What an idiot!
1327234058775130113 2020-11-13 20:57:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And another state Trump lost!
1327231895185334274 2020-11-13 20:48:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Of course I’m seriously not embarrassed! I didn’t vote for the lying, corrupt, 3 times that we know of guy cheating on his wives in the WH!

1327008633109032960 2020-11-13 06:01:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha! They are so desperate, it's sad really. Waste time on this nonsense while we have 150,000 NEW COVID CASES A DAY and almost 2000 DEAD AMERICANS from it a day!
1327008304976048128 2020-11-13 06:00:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1327007976348151809 2020-11-13 05:58:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love NY!
1327007918399643650 2020-11-13 05:58:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How many women have accused that disgusting vile man of rape or sexual assault? How many photos is he in with Epstein, how long did Epstein stay at Mar A Lago?
1327007573032185862 2020-11-13 05:57:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Testing, tracing, quarantine while it was still under 100 cases! Not saying it will magically disappear one day like your genius did!
1327006760708804610 2020-11-13 05:54:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TheRickyDavila Such good news!

1327005618289438720 2020-11-13 05:49:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT TODAY!
1327005392912715778 2020-11-13 05:48:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How Patriotic Buffoon Trump is! No statement, but how much he hates this person, or faux news, or is firing this person...invoke the 25TH!
1327005182094413829 2020-11-13 05:47:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> While American's are ashamed and dismayed that this fool is still in the White House, doing nothing nothing but tweeting and belittling, and attacking Fox News! While Biden gathers his hero's &amp; works every single day!
1327004843995770908 2020-11-13 05:46:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> GO NY!
1327004745488355328 2020-11-13 05:46:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, Trump said repeatedly &amp; wildly inaccurately many times over that this virus would magically disappear. He's a stupid little man and he's gambled with our lives, and WE LOST! When we could have had a handle on this, he took 15 cases to 10.5 MILLION CASES! Almost 250,000 deaths
1327003419488481280 2020-11-13 05:40:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TomArnold @mcuban We have to both, or everything will get worse for everyone!

1327003085563179015 2020-11-13 05:39:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And the Loser Trump story just gets more desperate!
1327002785909497861 2020-11-13 05:38:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yep that's a leader we should all be proud of America! He's all about doing the work, isn't he?
1327002583584694272 2020-11-13 05:37:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, glad they still get paid...
1327002455515795462 2020-11-13 05:36:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, I thought we were standing by and staying tuned for the major upset for Trumpers to show they won? It looks like all are abandoning the Trumptanic!!!!
1327002290918731776 2020-11-13 05:36:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess this didn't age well you buffoon! So grateful for the President taking 15 cases all the way down to 10.5 MILLION! Only in Trumps America!
1327002080272375810 2020-11-13 05:35:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh like Daddy's finally going to jail?  https://t.co/99FZbSdtoS
1327001642907131909 2020-11-13 05:33:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I saw the con as soon as I first saw the Don!
1327001061983449088 2020-11-13 05:31:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then who is getting charged with lying on a sworn affidavit?
1327000660601139200 2020-11-13 05:29:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BenDover2k @joncoopertweets Can you imagine him congratulating the person who gets the wrong answer, and incorrectly telling the person who got it right, that sorry that's not the correct answer...he who doth have no intelligence shall not host Jeopardy!
1327000389628153856 2020-11-13 05:28:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KatMeanJean When I found out at age 9 that they lied about Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy, all that seemed like a fairy tail as well.
1326999710058622977 2020-11-13 05:25:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You would think that, wouldn't you?
1326999386157674496 2020-11-13 05:24:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick So you really believe that there is a plot to have hidden that around the world from the public?
1326988035435716608 2020-11-13 04:39:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @educated_educ8r Congratulations to both of you!  https://t.co/hBLf1Z3Q0U
1326987794246496256 2020-11-13 04:38:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick FACT: Studies show hydroxychloroquine does not have benefits in treating COVID19-A a treatment for malaria, &amp; lupus, has been under study as possible treatment, but data shows that this drug doesn't reduce deaths among hospitalised patients, or help people w/moderate disease
1326984752826609665 2020-11-13 04:26:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick No! What's sad is this dipshit you think is a leader SITTING ON HIS ass and doing nothing for anyone but himself right now!
1326984528079032327 2020-11-13 04:25:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @travisakers @MickelCran Really? OMG!!!
1326983881489309699 2020-11-13 04:23:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Stay tuned for what? 2000 DEATHS A DAY OF INNOCENT AMERICAN citizens because Trump can't do his job?
1326983771795714049 2020-11-13 04:22:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Which drug (hydroxychloroquine) the one that Trump touted over and over to work that all doctors and scientists of any reputation said didn't work?
1326938124614832129 2020-11-13 01:21:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @lindsaywise @RonJohnsonWI This is even dumber than how Trump feels about intelligence!
1326937437176782848 2020-11-13 01:18:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Perdue is a racist! Vote with your heart America! ENOUGH!
1326936797159567361 2020-11-13 01:16:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> GO GOP! Yay!

1326935846155657220 2020-11-13 01:12:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @darinnstacy @NickB09121299 Probably not. Too much truly horrific things have happened in our nation because of it.
1326935399986581504 2020-11-13 01:10:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kayleighmcenany so now FOX won't even hire you because your lord and douchebag master has given them the boot. Hope you enjoy OAN!
1326935255807369217 2020-11-13 01:09:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's cause they have that nasty #TrumpStink
1326935161846554627 2020-11-13 01:09:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RutherfordRocks I did too! It felt amazing!
1326935087439556608 2020-11-13 01:09:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hear that Trumpers? No more Tucker?? No more Hannity? OMG! What will you do?
1326934656386818049 2020-11-13 01:07:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @donaldjTrump @TeamTrump @kayleighmcenany @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS has sent a team into the US because you are worthless, lazy, pathetic killers! GROW up and serve your nation NOW!
1326933704447582209 2020-11-13 01:03:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Clowns!
1326933445717667844 2020-11-13 01:02:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As Utah COVID-19 hospitalizations rise, nurses from NYC come to help-so they like the blue states now? I am sick of this!
1326932771323990018 2020-11-13 01:00:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MsJayeBee @kurteichenwald Oh that's so heartbreaking. I am so sorry for your loss.
1326932586048917504 2020-11-13 00:59:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Twitter please shut down Trumps account! It's damaging America!
1326932363209748480 2020-11-13 00:58:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FoxNews surprised, shocked, outraged? Or too chicken shit and corrupt to give a F-ck?
1326932056903913472 2020-11-13 00:57:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag Nancy was alone in a hair salon (no other customers) with her mask around her neck after having her hair washed and wet and they made a much bigger deal of that! I'd say this is pretty freaking serious here!
1326931713470164995 2020-11-13 00:55:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MarkJoh23464885 @RuthieKetchup @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN @Twitter Oh yes, I have unfollowed him, but I look at his tweets a few times a day and report them as soon as I can !
1326931061268471810 2020-11-13 00:53:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why is this lunatic not behind bars? Oh yeah this is Trumps America!
1326930701657251843 2020-11-13 00:51:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> F-cking biggest chickens on the face of the Earth! People are dying because these traitors can't serve the people? They are a disgrace and we must work tirelessly to make sure NONE of them ever serve in any public office again!
1326930140492914689 2020-11-13 00:49:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great, see how much he cares? Needless deaths, needless poverty. Heartless and wicked cruelty and corruption. MAGA-really?
1326929896153690126 2020-11-13 00:48:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag @WayChic @awelab1956 Too bad Trump did nothing but debase him and mock him!
1326929701294714880 2020-11-13 00:47:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Murderer in Chief-laziness, greed, hypocrisy, and ignorance have led almost 250,000 American's to their death! I hope you are all proud of your murderous complicit filthy behavior!
1326929228013707277 2020-11-13 00:45:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh you better watch it! Your lord and master no longer allows Fox as news! Didn't you get that Tweet?
1326928958844235777 2020-11-13 00:44:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has Steve Bannon been arrested yet for calling for the beheading of Wray &amp; Facui? Asking for about 77 Million VERY concerned Americans!
1326928816674136066 2020-11-13 00:44:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Corruption runs rampant in this administration! Open your eyes Trumpers!
1326928607520940033 2020-11-13 00:43:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nothing had to be this bad! We have someone with the IQ and temperment of a 3 year old spoiled child in the White House not because of a higher calling for public service, but for greed, power, and corruption!
1326927546206842887 2020-11-13 00:39:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LynnView @JRJ2010 @PaulyVisual @ccmshields1 @KDKA It's just Twitter!!! Hugs! Enjoy your day!
1326927446390738944 2020-11-13 00:38:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awe golly jeez, he turned on them? Just like he does everyone who disagrees with him. That's a shocker! Trumpers you are next! When you are no longer worth anything to him-maybe you'll finally see his true nature!
1326926891224272896 2020-11-13 00:36:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @OpinionThorny Isn't it sad that this little fool made us ashamed to hang our American flags? I have been hanging mine since Saturday when at least the media announced Biden's win! Felt good to be proud of that flag and not associating it with Trump!
1326908794954248195 2020-11-12 23:24:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awe Trump 2016 supporters F-CK YOUR FEELINGS. What lovely humans! Sure the grandkids love these family albums!
1326908178337067009 2020-11-12 23:22:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh I always loved Baio's crafts! His crocheted doilies are absolutely fabulouuuuuuus!
1326907273650827266 2020-11-12 23:18:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Obviously, because they've never entered your life yet!
1326907169703424001 2020-11-12 23:18:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The long cold, bleak, deadliest #TrumpWinter of death, despair, poverty, and hopelessness. This is Trumps America! A do nothing, ignorant president glorifies his little self we while starve, lose our homes, and die.
1326906463202267136 2020-11-12 23:15:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joansths1 @s_vickman Oh, I don't think we necessarily have to chose one, do we?
1326906374425636869 2020-11-12 23:15:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's got to be a scholar of Trump University right there folks! Aren't you embarrassed?
1326906194401910789 2020-11-12 23:14:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AMEN!
1326905852926828545 2020-11-12 23:13:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sad that right now, we are standing there looking and waiting and hoping someone would pick us for their team...
1326904936303636484 2020-11-12 23:09:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 25th Amendment TODAY, right this minute NOW!
1326904542450094083 2020-11-12 23:07:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @xxdr_zombiexx Yes, why be honest with our clients &amp; customers? Why act with grace and dignity &amp; humanity? What's the point? Get mine, and screw everyone else, right? That's the Trump way! I mean he even told me in NC to vote twice! Now, I can just run over someone in FL &amp; call them a protestor
1326904116300423179 2020-11-12 23:06:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right now he's letting his litigation Peter Out!
1326903589311303680 2020-11-12 23:04:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TalbertSwan I am so sorry for your loss. Your family is my thoughts.  https://t.co/33jV9DCUtn

1326902648054964230 2020-11-12 23:00:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's because he's an idiot? Why do we even report stupid stuff like this? Who cares? I want a man who stands up for the truth for our nation! Not a whiny president who lies and has meltdowns. We are a world wide embarrassment!
1326902326309900288 2020-11-12 22:59:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Here is a link to all the states certifications, and dates for certification if they have not certified yet!  https://t.co/W3Tv6NlwCF

1326899380402737153 2020-11-12 22:47:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @murray_nyc @thehill Exactly! He's a cruel corrupt and unfeeling monster! He threatens, demeans, and antagonizes his people! The media all treat him with kid gloves. It's a shame what they have helped to perpetuate.
1326898402161008642 2020-11-12 22:43:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because they are decent, hardworking, caring, compassionate, intelligent, uplifting, and give me hope that we can get our nation back, and get the pandemic that dweedledumbest has botched finally going in the right way, or as he would put it, rounding the corner!
1326897834759770114 2020-11-12 22:41:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then please get the 25th amendment invoked before we all die!
1326897649736355840 2020-11-12 22:40:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG will you shut up? You are obviously violating this act. You are about as dumb as a rock. You are such a poor example for your children. How do you sleep at night?

1326890786005331974 2020-11-12 22:13:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Should we report the ONE ballot drop off location in Harris Co for 80 square miles and 4.7 Million residents?

1326685314157580289 2020-11-12 08:36:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DearAuntCrabby Can't we make it Thanksgiving instead? Heck even Veterans Day perhaps?
1326593768892542976 2020-11-12 02:32:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a buffoon! Apple doesn't fall far from the ignorant tree-daddy told us TWICE to vote twice in NC!

1326591942830985217 2020-11-12 02:25:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too go TaskFarce! Look,it's the red wave of death!
1326591792465268738 2020-11-12 02:25:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JennieLouLeeder @Biggan4Congress Absolutely case by case!
1326591513384652800 2020-11-12 02:23:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joshuafett75 Very sad-boils down to one incompetent person that leads by a piss poor example!
1326591163755851777 2020-11-12 02:22:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Purdue and Loeffler
1326590951196921859 2020-11-12 02:21:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow, they actually wiped their gooches and taints with the Trump ballots! Wonder why he didn't video that! And the $1,000,000 goes to....
1326590681129897990 2020-11-12 02:20:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I always hate it when dishonest folks not only hide Trump ballots, but actually  wipe their gooches and taints with ballots!
1326590341345124352 2020-11-12 02:19:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Yes, I am sure y'all will come up with 5 Million votes. Good luck with that!
1326590125963415552 2020-11-12 02:18:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Seems kinda ironic that his own party is calling for his resignation and then he decides to recount.
1326587171814379520 2020-11-12 02:06:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love that, now Trump gets to lose GA twice! Or, I guess that would be George as the GOP idiots called it!
1326586409835253762 2020-11-12 02:03:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy, look at that DIVERSE gang!
1326586249562509313 2020-11-12 02:03:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd be worried about the Bar Association!
1326585991847702530 2020-11-12 02:02:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay go COVID!
1326585773076918273 2020-11-12 02:01:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @jennybizh How could re-counting make up Biden's substantial lead?
1326585547268251657 2020-11-12 02:00:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a Trumper thinks when someone won't even do their job because of their bias! It would be funny if physicians worked this way when deciding to save a life or not, I suppose?
1326585397531570177 2020-11-12 01:59:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick OH and BTW-Even if Trump somehow pulls GA out in the re-count, incase you can't count...that's still nowhere near 270!
1326585189515063296 2020-11-12 01:58:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They simply support all that unethical and criminal behavior! It's quite pathetic.
1326584952750825472 2020-11-12 01:57:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> More lies, how could that be? Trump and his cronies just seem so honest at every turn! Just like that COVID disappearing Nov 4th! Trump ALWAYS GETS EVERYTHING DEAD WRONG and American's die to prove it!
1326584555944468481 2020-11-12 01:56:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There is the red wave thanks to Trump!

1326584073389813760 2020-11-12 01:54:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Mr. Raffensperger, who backed Mr. Trump in the election, was sharply criticized by Trump supporters who have claimed that the election was mismanaged, but offered no evidence to back up that claim. On Monday, Perdue &amp; Loeffler, called on Mr. Raffensperger to resign. Loyalty!
1326550111976001536 2020-11-11 23:39:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @thomaskaine5 Well, imagine how long that would take...
1326549925434253322 2020-11-11 23:38:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Rightfully so, and just imagine having them featured during the RNC...
1326549604326801411 2020-11-11 23:37:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PattyArquette @msleen1970 Me too!
1326549523561291782 2020-11-11 23:37:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 Well, apparently we only have about 71 million idiots to worry about!
1326549411028062208 2020-11-11 23:36:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are just trying to destroy evidence of their crimes! American's won't let that happen!
1326548944168443906 2020-11-11 23:34:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Funny, I remember Trump being in my state of NC and TWICE telling us to vote TWICE! Isn't that a felony? Shouldn't a President know just a smidge about the laws of our Country?
1326548523446272000 2020-11-11 23:33:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has he ever shown any interest in the actual work of being President?
1326547886591537163 2020-11-11 23:30:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @fred_guttenberg @JesseGuttenberg Happy Birthday!
1326547606823030784 2020-11-11 23:29:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DanRather When is the last time Trump spoke about COVID...when he whined it was still just media hype? How can our nation be in such disgrace, and surrounded by death?
1326546771015737348 2020-11-11 23:26:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are so gullible! This happens time and time again. What pathetic excuses for adults! Scary times...when the most ignorant, and corrupt are in charge of our wonderful nation!
1326546519705579520 2020-11-11 23:25:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Amy_Siskind 🤚
1326546469910847491 2020-11-11 23:24:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When is the LAST TIME Trump talked about COVID? Seriously! About a million cases in a week and what has he done about it?
1326546051625443335 2020-11-11 23:23:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Burying the bodies perhaps?
1326545609818402822 2020-11-11 23:21:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He never has proof! We've seen all the voter intimidation and GOP election interference, oh and DeJoy...but somehow they flip ALL of that in the Trumpers minds. It's pretty scary.
1326545351591878658 2020-11-11 23:20:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @fras99 Not having Trump as President!
1326545155495583745 2020-11-11 23:19:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are spoiled and they act like children, not grown ups! Certainly not leaders!
1326544992962146304 2020-11-11 23:19:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I would have thought 2016...but here we are!
1326544804616957958 2020-11-11 23:18:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss What a Commander in Chief, huh? Brave, upstanding, honorable man...
1326543814983524357 2020-11-11 23:14:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump FAIL! #TrumpStink  https://t.co/VJNUECzyZr
1326543714659938306 2020-11-11 23:14:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As if! He breaks actual laws and accuses others of breaking non existent laws! What a buffon! How embarrassing!
1326543374560632832 2020-11-11 23:12:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss Someone must have told him to do it! He never honors anyone but himself!
1326542382662180866 2020-11-11 23:08:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Kind of funny what the Commander in Chiefs tweet priorities were today! He finally tweeted about our nations hero's on Veterans Day-after his normal ridiculous outrageous tweets!
1326533021340676098 2020-11-11 22:31:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FBI are these being investigated as hard as they should be?

1326532373446602753 2020-11-11 22:28:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Biden_Army Great point! Think of what they'd do for $1,000,000.
1326530291587047430 2020-11-11 22:20:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Trump_Detester He has to, we can't take this. You have no idea. The evil and corruption is so overwhelming and all this is going on with absolutely ZERO focus on COVID. That impacts the entire world. It has to stop!

1326528081776013312 2020-11-11 22:11:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Funny how Trump always hires the best people!
1326527440173342720 2020-11-11 22:09:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just a reminder if you aren't sure if Trump is a racist-the only President who he claimed was not born in America was our first black President!
1326524904578183178 2020-11-11 21:59:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Also scrambling not knowing where to put the DEAD AMERICANS!
1326524563145039875 2020-11-11 21:57:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kaitlancollins He's spot on! Trump followers are hungry starving in fact for the lies!
1326524134340366336 2020-11-11 21:56:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Done!
1326524111963770880 2020-11-11 21:56:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump-give it up. Stop trying to divide this country. You lost! Now try to figure out how to act with some grace and dignity! Thank you-America! @realDonaldTrump
1326355263197241347 2020-11-11 10:45:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Well then why would you welcome Trumps interference when he hasn’t even shown you a plan?
1326355080338153472 2020-11-11 10:44:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Trump has provided no plan to replace it-he even said out loud that it’s coming soon-just like his taxes!
1326354136443580416 2020-11-11 10:40:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Mine didn’t go up!

1326353004228980736 2020-11-11 10:36:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Then why is your pathetic leader taking it to the courts? Guess he doesn’t understand it and as President that’s pretty pathetic!
1326352505413001216 2020-11-11 10:34:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Would that be because you’d have no other way to obtain health insurance without it-or just a personal choice to protest it by being on it-yiu make absolutely NO SENSE!
1326352173748416512 2020-11-11 10:32:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Why on earth are you on the ACA plan?
1326352018156494848 2020-11-11 10:32:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Oh-so the plan is actually out there now?
1326349804557963264 2020-11-11 10:23:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick We are staying tuned as the Biden lead continues to grow, fraud is happening ONLY on the part of the GOP, and Trump continues to lose his pathetic legal challenges! Couldn’t even get SCOTUS to back him on ACA-you know why America? Trump is nothing but a LOSER!
1326349211789615104 2020-11-11 10:21:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay America-What do you call a wicked sick F-ck that takes out MULTIPLE full page ads calling for the DEATH by execution of 5 INNOCENT black teenagers?
1326348887964213248 2020-11-11 10:19:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick What would you call it when someone takes out multiple full page ads to have innocent teenagers executed-like going out to buy them pony’s? What would you call it?

1326346149465305089 2020-11-11 10:08:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Which case? The one where Trump tried to have 5 black teenagers MURDERED?
1326345933899100165 2020-11-11 10:08:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like Presidents who will stand up for our soldiers when Putin puts a bounty on their heads! Anything else is ANTI-AMERICAN and treason!
1326345357991809024 2020-11-11 10:05:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Who took out MULTIPLE full page newspaper ads calling for the execution of 5 innocent black teenagers? Who refused to rent apartments to blacks? That would be the racist Donald Trump!
1326344320727867392 2020-11-11 10:01:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Well if you support a rapist racist pedophile-that’s your choice!

I’m not the one who wished his girlfriend/accomplice well-Trump did! I’m not the one with MULTIPLE sexual assault accusations against me-including the BRUTAL RAPE of a 13 year
1326333806580805633 2020-11-11 09:19:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So is she an accessory

1326332145397346304 2020-11-11 09:13:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just thinking out loud about Donny and Epstein “paling around together so much” and the 13 year old that alleged Pedo Donny brutally raped her.

1326189659756654594 2020-11-10 23:47:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump has ZERO respect for our military. Imagine not wanting their votes to count, after all they do for us? Hideous!
1326189016434274305 2020-11-10 23:44:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why-probably simply because it's nicknamed Obamacare, and Trump is such a huge racist! Yes, with him it's that simple!

Imagine having to threat death to win!
1325851144694927362 2020-11-10 01:22:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well that's great! Most people don't have access to this! So they get the best, and won't even acknowledge that we need more contract tracing and a national mask mandate? So we die and our families suffer?

1325147525272244224 2020-11-08 02:46:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He said if Joe was elected he'd leave the country! Can he keep at least one of his promises? PLEEEEAAAASE????
1325146936933052419 2020-11-08 02:43:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @fred_guttenberg There are no words, you are hope, and we love you!
1325146508694597632 2020-11-08 02:42:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AngrierWHStaff We can NEVER even get close to such a dangerous situation again! Runoffs are as important as this election!
1325146266402254850 2020-11-08 02:41:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you for always holding your ground!
1325145323036160000 2020-11-08 02:37:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Really? I thought he was relaxing playing golf at his golf course, while charging us for his pleasure! That's what he enjoys about being President! Idiot!
1325145001215537153 2020-11-08 02:36:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @jkbelk Please I can't even think about that part of it.
1325144855811649537 2020-11-08 02:35:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @atrupar Well said!

1325143080782221315 2020-11-08 02:28:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AuthorKimberley To not have to look at that beast again!
1325143013832658944 2020-11-08 02:28:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Traitor Trump-remove him now, and lets get this virus under control, and therefore our economy, our families, our communities back!
1325142434263703558 2020-11-08 02:25:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @middleageriot Agreed! We also lost so many brave fighters who did not live to see this. I hope they are proud of us!
1325141997431132160 2020-11-08 02:24:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @morethanmySLE You are good! The nightmare is over. The dream is REAL!!!
1325141768401268736 2020-11-08 02:23:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, have you seen one of many Trump gilded properties? Have you seen the millions Trump has let slide through his hands? Have you seen the bill he's left tax payers with. Why am I arguing with an idiot in under pants?
1325141286500900864 2020-11-08 02:21:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Disabled_Vet_US @ProjectLincoln Thank you for your service. You have our love, honor, and respect!
1325141203185102849 2020-11-08 02:20:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need to sell off Trumps remaining assets to start a fund for the 240,000 families who lost loved ones due to his complete and utter failure, his lies, his mocking masks and science, threatening to fire Fauci...the list is endless. They DESERVE justice America!
1325137887285817344 2020-11-08 02:07:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DanRather We are too!
1325137815819096064 2020-11-08 02:07:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GOPChairwoman Votes have won you skank!
1325137360422629376 2020-11-08 02:05:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JasonMillerinDC Just checking to see how scattered y'all are today! You better think about all that corruption and think hard. 75 Million Americans will no longer be silenced. We are standing up AND standing by!
1325129175221608448 2020-11-08 01:33:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know!! She's been put through so much and she's always shown such courage, strength, and character! Love her!!  https://t.co/KD0xCifuUG
1325128852956348418 2020-11-08 01:31:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KyleKulinski How do you know exactly how he is going to govern? Do you want to share his playbook with us?
1325128642901364738 2020-11-08 01:31:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Here we go, focus!
1325128498499891207 2020-11-08 01:30:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Mayor Bottoms making me cry again-stop it!! She's been so brave and couldn't be happier for her and her family!
1325128020235939841 2020-11-08 01:28:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @morethanmySLE Me too!  https://t.co/WfpXjTZrZG
1325127836533972993 2020-11-08 01:27:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @glennkirschner2 The investigations and charges start Monday!
1325126719813148673 2020-11-08 01:23:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is how leaders who are elected to work for the people, actually work for the people, not for themselves! Do you get it now Trumpers?
1325126404015415297 2020-11-08 01:22:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @natsechobbyist So proud of you all!!! Congrats!

1325126029183053824 2020-11-08 01:20:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is what we need to focus on too. DeJoy, Kushner, Jr, Ivanka, THE GOP leaders who profited from knowledge about COVID!
1325125776690196490 2020-11-08 01:19:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, but go get your own legal team, you are of no use for me now!  https://t.co/bitP2DuMEh
1325125254503571456 2020-11-08 01:17:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JayDouglasDean WE DID IT!
1325123874476892161 2020-11-08 01:12:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AmarAmarasingam @PatinkinMandy We did it!!!
1325123270262206469 2020-11-08 01:09:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The answer is NO!
1325122964392726528 2020-11-08 01:08:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type We did it!!! We can sleep better now! Although it might be hard to sleep tonight. Too happy!
1325122583189098501 2020-11-08 01:06:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is this the calmest they've ever behaved? Joe's magic works quickly! I am in awe!
1325122284974084103 2020-11-08 01:05:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DeanObeidallah Thank you for always finding the courage to fight for us!
1325122175775371268 2020-11-08 01:05:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> While lazy Trump who actually is the President right now is playing golf on our tax payer dime. He didn't work on one thing for the nation this last month. He lied, mocked masks, killed people, incited hatred and violence, and committed crimes. He has to pay for that!
1325121808249524225 2020-11-08 01:03:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden And on our tax payer money!
1325121578015797251 2020-11-08 01:02:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @OrangeGuy_YT @JoeBiden Do you need help packing? Do you need a GoFundme account? Whatever you need to get gone, count me in!
1325121128382271493 2020-11-08 01:01:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @smartdissent @JoeBiden Sign me up!
1325120922546659329 2020-11-08 01:00:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @irishrygirl @DanDcgrandview @ReverendWarnock @ossoff And find a place for Jaime Harrison! He needs to be part of this movement NOW!
1325120845388283911 2020-11-08 01:00:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's good to see you again!
1325120606128336898 2020-11-08 00:59:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @itsJeffTiedrich  https://t.co/iPWIpM5bNi
1325120071518347264 2020-11-08 00:56:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @realDonaldTrump You are now America's Biggest Loser, oh was that your show? You are so irrelevant it's really not that important.
1325119752151293958 2020-11-08 00:55:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TrentCapelli Thank you for being there for us! It felt lost and lonely down here!
1325119599743033344 2020-11-08 00:55:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets get 306!
1325119542490755072 2020-11-08 00:54:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan Hugs!  https://t.co/yTfjLYrA1F
1325119105540632577 2020-11-08 00:53:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Breaking the clubs! Hope there are no children near by, can you imagine the profanity?
1325118834672455680 2020-11-08 00:52:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes! Love it! I mean really, Trump has worked so hard this week for America (I mean himself) he needed a break, after his break, while being on break...
1325118611229351937 2020-11-08 00:51:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nah, go ahead and stay put. I like it better that way!
1325118542384160769 2020-11-08 00:50:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes they are!
1325118479389908994 2020-11-08 00:50:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did Joe Biden impart calm on Fox news? I never watch them, but wanted to see their coverage on this and they are calm and dare I say respectful. Is that all it took? Trump was really that much of a bad influence? Wow!
1325116905842241537 2020-11-08 00:44:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pantomath__ I know, we still have work to do, not being a nag, but now we know we were strong, we were powerful and we did this! What an achievement.
1325116738384621568 2020-11-08 00:43:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are so honored to have President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris willing to serve our beloved nation! Bless everyone, and rejoice! Our voices were heard.
1325116500563406848 2020-11-08 00:42:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jillbiden46 Congratulations! You had to fight such meanness, corruption, and quite frankly-evil. We are so honored and welcome you with open arms! Bless you!
1325116213417177088 2020-11-08 00:41:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @bblock29 No, you're crying!
1325116101005627393 2020-11-08 00:41:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 It's surprising since he abandoned them at 8 years old! Ha!
1325115817403568134 2020-11-08 00:40:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jaime we are so ready to support such a compassionate candidate, you are going places in politics! Can't wait to watch your amazing career!
1325115602504134656 2020-11-08 00:39:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @itsJeffTiedrich It was so hard to tell for sure, I almost unfollowed you a few times. Glad for the clarification!!! No more screaming at the TV!
1325114897093550084 2020-11-08 00:36:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Racism LOST suckers!
1325114523506929664 2020-11-08 00:34:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just full of hope and peace
1325114453285892096 2020-11-08 00:34:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> God has defeated evil on Earth today!
1325113751243280386 2020-11-08 00:31:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I watch CNN and Jake Tapper was hardly able to speak!  https://t.co/1NSJtt4HPm
1325113661086715908 2020-11-08 00:31:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LabyrinthWeaver Love you too! What a relief. The hope and positive things that are coming, the help, support, compassion, kindness! Character is Destiny!
1325113443444269057 2020-11-08 00:30:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> WE DID IT!!!
1325113007559626754 2020-11-08 00:28:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good Morning President Biden!
1324940862665723904 2020-11-07 13:04:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously lying that he wasn’t there! My God it’s no longer aboiyt how many lies they tell-irs about do they EVER say anything truthful
1324940380878606341 2020-11-07 13:02:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course they can’t-the irony is in the lyrics and they are so damn dumb-they don’t even know what the song was a protest song written about revolution against institutional racism and police brutality
1324927663102963712 2020-11-07 12:12:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly!
1324926192424771584 2020-11-07 12:06:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What! The get over it folks? Huh?
1324925878346899456 2020-11-07 12:05:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @nixw20 @IAmJohnAles @Meg4Congress Done
1324925692107251719 2020-11-07 12:04:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He will actually likely go to church
1324925019621822464 2020-11-07 12:01:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mjfree  https://t.co/11wEL1xRv6

1324924069192622089 2020-11-07 11:58:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoeBiden Thank you Mr. President!
1324923905581199363 2020-11-07 11:57:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Destinbeach22 @FBI @TheJusticeDept @JamesOKeefeIII @realDonaldTrump So no shot of the plates? Boy that bag looks super heavy and full-maybe the props dept didn’t think that through!
1324922941822423040 2020-11-07 11:53:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mattsheffield Really? Evil for decades? That’s scary to learn!
1324917096417988608 2020-11-07 11:30:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh we know-the deep state got this!
1324916917077946368 2020-11-07 11:29:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ejeancarroll @vincentdonofrio Why not?
1324916684604514304 2020-11-07 11:28:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m telling you America we we’re screwed! This was the Biden Harris plan for us? OMG. The evil-the horror-I guess I’ll have to move to another country! The world must be terrified and find a way to stop this evil. Help us world-this is asking too much!
1324915842405031936 2020-11-07 11:25:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay-so I’ve never watched Fox News a day in my life-people really believe this?
1324915047928377346 2020-11-07 11:22:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @vincentdonofrio Yes! So much evil to root out-Everytime I see one-I think that’s my unfavorite til I see another name and so on. How do Trumpers see these horrid people as our saviors from greed and corruption
1324914614094733312 2020-11-07 11:20:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @PalmerReport I never got my cat nap-What day is it? Did I shower today, or was that yesterday? Call it!
1324913944327286785 2020-11-07 11:17:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> My thoughts too
1324913618551533568 2020-11-07 11:16:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Man-Wendy’s started me at $3.45 an hour in 1989! Guess I got robbed!
1324913019420348418 2020-11-07 11:14:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The end of America’s bowel movement
1324912844601778176 2020-11-07 11:13:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shame so,many voted for this
1324912424856809474 2020-11-07 11:11:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! Film going in, and going through the building to the lunchroom
1324912144303992833 2020-11-07 11:10:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right and she looks very nefarious
1324902563775467520 2020-11-07 10:32:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Anal warts
1324900116491329536 2020-11-07 10:22:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I keep asking that-his brutal description of hanging their heads on either side of the White House as a warning to all who don't obey Trump?
1324899556618891267 2020-11-07 10:20:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mjfree Sleep-what’s that?
1324899126052589577 2020-11-07 10:19:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @macy5875 Good
1324897241342091266 2020-11-07 10:11:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She has no grace or dignity
1324896732719820801 2020-11-07 10:09:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s go Purdue both racistly and chauvinistically mocked Kamala‘s name! He holds public office and demeans our next VP! Nope-he gotta go!
1324895287819857920 2020-11-07 10:03:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow the fraud is just rampant! Parents-don‘t name yiur children after yourself...Don Jr
1324893494255755267 2020-11-07 09:56:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @blinn3580  https://t.co/Mlxx8DYc4G
1324893174301601792 2020-11-07 09:55:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pay per view
1324892852560818176 2020-11-07 09:54:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I knew that’s what they planning! Damn it they tricked me into voting for them.
1324892678094524417 2020-11-07 09:53:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awe it’s always about the love with Trump, isn’t it?
1324890848463622146 2020-11-07 09:46:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You added that music, right? There is no way they are playing that song, is there? No....
1324890456367509505 2020-11-07 09:44:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m not!
1324888436298362880 2020-11-07 09:36:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Everyone really needs to take time to be grateful and appreciative. We think we have it bad-imagine coping with this right now, while a leader who should be protecting their citizens, just makes it worse!
1324887274098667520 2020-11-07 09:31:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Goss30Goss Oh my goodness! Hugs and best wishes for all of you!
1324881652607299590 2020-11-07 09:09:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JayDouglasDean Oh thank her! You must be so proud!
1324878599942524934 2020-11-07 08:57:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag Well I may be tired of him forever-but you are right. I have a major political crush on Jaime Harrison so maybe...
1324878299680690177 2020-11-07 08:56:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MartinaOllivia Thanks!
1324877943252938753 2020-11-07 08:54:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But how much can he take with him to prison
1324877781864505346 2020-11-07 08:54:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you imagine the hair weave shed? Uuuuge piles of that filled with dandruff OMG I just threw up in my mouth! Sorry
1324877339793219584 2020-11-07 08:52:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @shannonrwatts You can’t leave you might miss something
1324875522954891267 2020-11-07 08:45:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So they only “hammered” the mail in ballots?
1324874582747209728 2020-11-07 08:41:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Trump_Detester Are we causing Canadians to be as stupid as we are?
1324874345886445569 2020-11-07 08:40:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thugs on a plane, demon seamen, I’ll be releasing my taxes soon, grab em by the pussy, I’d like to date my daughter she’s hot, selling Puerto Rico, Losers and Suckers, Lock her up, your favorite President, me, mark my words, now I have the tallest building again
1324872806564237312 2020-11-07 08:34:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And a little thing like mocking a world wide pandemic
1324872653086265345 2020-11-07 08:33:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Domestic terrorism
1324872480645844994 2020-11-07 08:33:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @klkc2009 Me too-he’s sitting on next to nothing! It’s got be making that little hamster wheel spin so fast its smoking!
1324872281957396482 2020-11-07 08:32:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s not forget the Republicans holding public positions that called the Biden campaign Joe and the Ho! Meditate on that for a while!
1324871985999044614 2020-11-07 08:31:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @roper_93 Nope he said it would disappear on Nov 4th. That’s why he has all this free time to show the world how dignified and full of grace he is!
1324871623720251393 2020-11-07 08:29:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He has no shame!
1324870609235488769 2020-11-07 08:25:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I sure hope their employers are ready for this post!
1324870006002356224 2020-11-07 08:23:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you post the list-so we all have it to make sure we support whoever is running against them in the future? Asking for 73,000,000 friends!
1324868910668259328 2020-11-07 08:18:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @Jean_Is_fed_up @MSNBC Please@
1324868836575895553 2020-11-07 08:18:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why? His boss said no more COVID after Nov 3
1324868007412293633 2020-11-07 08:15:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> sadly one lie I’d have been okay with him getting right!
1324867776192851968 2020-11-07 08:14:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I initially moved to VA, and my car broke down on the way down and it was 106 that day-not the norm!
1324867057897312256 2020-11-07 08:11:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Last batch was 4 to 1! Love it!
1324866771359293447 2020-11-07 08:10:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TooHipGottaGo Wasn’t like that in Buffalo-I moved to the south from WNY a long time ago-and now I’m cold at 57 degrees! Grew up with double digit negative numbers
1324866314041757696 2020-11-07 08:08:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are they seeking volunteers?
1324865868304703488 2020-11-07 08:06:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> In Trump math or actual math?
1324865782350831616 2020-11-07 08:06:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope he still does, he lifts our spirits and reminds us to unite and heal. It’s uplifting and quite frankly-I’m selfish. I need that today!
1324865197497065474 2020-11-07 08:04:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LiberalNavySeal Think of the sad fact that all this money on both sides could be helping COVID families who may have lost their breadwinner, and will have unsurmountable medical bills. Trump destroys more than he even intends...
1324864400377999360 2020-11-07 08:01:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s not forget our loss souls, and their grieving families! So today America we lost MORE THAN ONE CHERISHED AMERICAN EVERY SINGLE MINUTE today. Our leader is throwing fits over what he has lost....he has no idea what loss is. That’s why he let this happen to us!
1324863461956915206 2020-11-07 07:57:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RiderBabe52 @tellis_kirk @LeonaLioness6 You are amazing
1324863392604184578 2020-11-07 07:57:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I say we all get one and drive to DC
1324863233765806089 2020-11-07 07:56:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can we all get them and drive to DC?
1324862777425616897 2020-11-07 07:54:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The ones that daddy wins, and makes her and hubby part of his administration
1324862429038260224 2020-11-07 07:53:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, what was the zombies motivation in that scene? Maybe!
1324861224866230272 2020-11-07 07:48:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I mean maybe she’s that stupid not know that-but she expects us to be that dumb too-oh that’s right she’s posting this fir the Trumpers. Got it!
1324859483009544193 2020-11-07 07:41:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can we get that on pay per view?
1324858127091724288 2020-11-07 07:36:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @doug_fireside Thanks! And thanks! Too funny!
1324857835113635842 2020-11-07 07:34:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LiberalNavySeal He has a fund too. I donated this morning!
1324857636538494979 2020-11-07 07:34:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is this satire or real? Need to know how to comment on this!
1324856276363452416 2020-11-07 07:28:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Told to hold off on those-or it’s coming soon....
1324855991683502080 2020-11-07 07:27:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are sheep, if sheep had no spines!
1324854534297079814 2020-11-07 07:21:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So why are we not affected? Simple intelligence?
1324853222142562306 2020-11-07 07:16:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Agreed!
1324852704611631104 2020-11-07 07:14:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nope!
1324852356975071236 2020-11-07 07:13:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @howeasyweforget @realDonaldTrump This is brilliant
1324851680333225987 2020-11-07 07:10:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don’t you know it!
1324850949081452544 2020-11-07 07:07:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I mean perfect timing right-seriously THINK about that.
1324850552136699905 2020-11-07 07:06:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We can’t keep him!
1324850447241351169 2020-11-07 07:05:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Will she be in jail though?
1324849960991555584 2020-11-07 07:03:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So just really trying to understand this if I said that Fauci &amp;  Wray should be beheaded  &amp;  I'd put the heads on pikes. I'd put them at the two corners of the White House. As a warning to federal bureaucrats: Either get with the program or you're gone-I’d not be investigated?
1324848506276904961 2020-11-07 06:57:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too
1324848370188505094 2020-11-07 06:57:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He will have intelligent people working on multiple things at once-image!
1324846605258887169 2020-11-07 06:50:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Next to be voted out
1324846089724452865 2020-11-07 06:48:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s not that we are just up in the air-several Republicans in office are declaring fraud and one even just said that half of America will not accept a Biden win. This is so dangerous
1324845543525392384 2020-11-07 06:46:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I seem to recall Trump saying the cases would virtually disappear on Nov 4th
1324845233159417856 2020-11-07 06:44:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So what-we have to go to war with each other?
1324844954552848386 2020-11-07 06:43:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well said!
1324844637513764864 2020-11-07 06:42:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @donwinslow Count me in-just tell me what I can do!
1324844210684596225 2020-11-07 06:40:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Isn’t that illegal?
1324830530848858112 2020-11-07 05:46:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't care, do you? Ha!
1324820399671173121 2020-11-07 05:06:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @johnpavlovitz  https://t.co/QCNAJbdMxP
1324820229168500736 2020-11-07 05:05:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Normalcy-I really miss normalcy!
1324794732346748932 2020-11-07 03:24:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Will Trump be so broke he will have to sell his weave to make ends meat?
1324794038361509888 2020-11-07 03:21:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Mexico doesn't want them! We don't want them? Canada, interested? Pleeeease?
1324793808723259394 2020-11-07 03:20:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Agreed!  https://t.co/LrjHLlIZxU
1324793194354221061 2020-11-07 03:18:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes that's true we are! I for one am not ashamed to admit it!
1324792794414747652 2020-11-07 03:16:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, they are actually committing fraud right now! Also, election interference!
1324792648989888520 2020-11-07 03:15:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Creditors!
1324792591095914497 2020-11-07 03:15:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Probably depends on what type of cut off day they have to stop counting votes postmarked by Nov 3.
1324792436313542659 2020-11-07 03:15:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't bait me like that...you trying to get me kicked off twitter?
1324792337994829824 2020-11-07 03:14:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1324792286459404300 2020-11-07 03:14:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love that on CNN-what day is it? Ha!
1324792235762851840 2020-11-07 03:14:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd say you better simmer down. You are going to lose all three races there buddy! You really want this to be your moment right now while the ENTIRE world is watching a fair election going on? Where is your dignity man?
1324791821457915906 2020-11-07 03:12:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This time we will actually have a President for the people!
1324791274340274176 2020-11-07 03:10:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know it, we all need to get spy glasses that record them. Imagine they'd probably be even WORSE if they thought we weren't recording them....
1324790950196092932 2020-11-07 03:09:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, as if they have been demanding these changes for the last 20 years!
1324790878704144389 2020-11-07 03:08:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets see how many years have you been saying this Geraldo? Because it has nothing simply to do with your candidate losing right now, right?
1324790672390541316 2020-11-07 03:08:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hmmmm just wear a Biden shirt or hat and you'll see the look in their eyes!
1324790563401539587 2020-11-07 03:07:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Its just yet his daily routine of not actually doing what we elected him to do. Must be too mad to golf today!
1324790139852345351 2020-11-07 03:05:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know it! He's actually the one I watched and donated to the most. Upbeat, intelligent, humble. I was hooked and I don't live in SC!
1324789742093959169 2020-11-07 03:04:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If I trusted them not to abuse animals, maybe cleaning cages at the zoo, but I'd still fear for the bears, tigers, tasmanian devils, jackals, vultures, crocs, piranhas, wolves, sharks, poisonous frogs, rattlesnakes, assassin bugs
1324788346997088256 2020-11-07 02:58:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Blow out!
1324788291510718470 2020-11-07 02:58:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davidmweissman You have been amazing!!! We still have a lot of work to do, but lets enjoy this weekend.
1324788163974467587 2020-11-07 02:58:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know, the entire GOP, all his goons I mean his administration are just getting in deeper and deeper. F them, indict them, jail them! Make them pay back all the money they stole!
1324787371301363720 2020-11-07 02:54:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am sorry, what was that, I can't hear you over the blue wave noise!
1324787209552207872 2020-11-07 02:54:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Waste of time, effort, and money. The more they hate, the less the House, Senate and WH will have to work with them!
1324787050600669186 2020-11-07 02:53:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Agreed!!!
1324786998910029824 2020-11-07 02:53:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Way toooo late. We have all their NASTY lying hate filled tweets! That #TrumpStink is way too strong!
1324786785159925761 2020-11-07 02:52:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know! He got us here!
1324785987818500103 2020-11-07 02:49:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'll call OR text from NC! Whatever I am legally allowed to do!
1324785728673533956 2020-11-07 02:48:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nowhere to run or hide. That's the other part of our work reminding the Biden administration that these are crimes, horrific crimes and need to be addressed IMMEDIATELY.
1324785494836785152 2020-11-07 02:47:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine having an articulate world leader! Full sentences, confidence, dignity!
1324785243526746112 2020-11-07 02:46:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag Almost there like 98%, but just waiting for these states to call it like it is and looking forward to a relaxing weekend, before we focus on the Senate runoffs! Also will do anything to help Jaime (even though I am in NC)!
1324785001955758082 2020-11-07 02:45:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The actual difference between strength, courage, honor and conviction vs. a whiny meltingdown rage tweeting lying bully!
1324784787794644992 2020-11-07 02:44:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right only so many FOX news and OAN jobs to go around!
1324784544067821571 2020-11-07 02:43:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly all those losers and suckers ain't likely to vote for your little man.
1324783884249272320 2020-11-07 02:41:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jaime Harrison too please!
1324783751424020480 2020-11-07 02:40:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's going to be a pleasure watching you kiss ass when You when we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency! We will not forget you. Don't worry about that. Glad COVID, social justice, are what you are working on today, not spreading lies for a dumbass!
1324783197134217218 2020-11-07 02:38:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> a bit frenzied-is that like a touch of nuclear war?
1324783113843736586 2020-11-07 02:38:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wouldn't dummy start freaking out if we alleged voter fraud in Texas (where one ballot drop off for 4.7 Million residents) and about an 80 square mile radius...this could get fun!
1324781773272862722 2020-11-07 02:32:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope they sue you and great way to win them over! Remember dummy - Y'all going to be working so hard when we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency! We will not forget you. We will work non stop to make sure you are not re-elected!
1324781349090267141 2020-11-07 02:31:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hopefully you are making some kiss ass statements about the Dems! You know what's funny? Y'all going to be working so hard when we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency! We will not forget you. How in the world you saved your seat is beyond me!
1324781094806409221 2020-11-07 02:30:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know what's funny? Y'all going to be working so hard when we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency! We will not forget you. How in the world you saved your seat is beyond me, but we will work non stop to make sure that never happens again!
1324780328205062148 2020-11-07 02:26:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Absolutely! That's why we get a break long weekend, but remember Harris Co. TX? 80 square miles about 4.7 million voters, and one drop off? Plus, we need to make sure a LOT of the GOP is voted out! Also support our 2 runoffs in GA!
1324779930522189825 2020-11-07 02:25:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> KayLie, who do you think would hire such a shameful hateful lying applicant? Hmmmm?
1324766421553979393 2020-11-07 01:31:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> MSNBC
1324760821113774081 2020-11-07 01:09:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know their bravery is more of what's needed in this country!
1324760689949495296 2020-11-07 01:08:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am sorry what? You mean the Donald Trump that took out multiple full page ads calling for 5 black INNOCENT teenagers EXECUTION for one rape? The man who never ONCE apologized to them (I'm certain he's never apologized to anyone for anything)! You mean that Donald Trump?
1324760273958408193 2020-11-07 01:07:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Agree!
1324759741223100418 2020-11-07 01:05:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No judgement after all you have been through and continued the fight! We love you Joe!
1324759459432960000 2020-11-07 01:04:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Absolutely! Trump is actually belittling them and accusing them of fraud-and how many of them are Republicans? Jee, wonder how they will vote in 2022!
1324759069765283840 2020-11-07 01:02:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you! What true patriots did while MAGAS made threats, tried to kidnap Governors, acted like tiny  little brats. We worked! Imagine that...and we won! That's America!
1324758770984079363 2020-11-07 01:01:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not for long!
1324758714998468608 2020-11-07 01:01:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not for long!
1324758660413853698 2020-11-07 01:00:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What charge is Trump going to jail for first?
1324758569242210304 2020-11-07 01:00:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh we don't plan on letting him forget! I'll be tweeting him lots of daily reminders and cc the FBI, Joe and Kamala!
1324758390036484100 2020-11-07 00:59:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's alright we can boycott their advertisers! We work hard for our country, and our money. Spend it wisely America!
1324758198876807168 2020-11-07 00:59:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sad that Obama had to lie and say he had a conversation with Trump. The man doesn't know the best words, maybe he had a translator?
1324757857875697673 2020-11-07 00:57:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't worry, he's proven he's not that smart and has surrounded himself with inexperienced fools! Compare that to the experience and people who Biden has on his side. This is actually almost too funny.
1324757514727182337 2020-11-07 00:56:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That is such GOOD NEWS! Do you realize what we have done? We have won it all! R's you might want to start being a little less disgusting and hateful now. Rough years ahead! Way rough years ahead!
1324756831042969600 2020-11-07 00:53:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes KayLie surely does, but she's not a good person, so she won't!
1324756633159929857 2020-11-07 00:52:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you for patience world!
1324756578927562752 2020-11-07 00:52:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wait, now he did check into his golf course properties like 387 times though.
1324756404410982404 2020-11-07 00:51:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Every day will get worse! He will have to have a public defender think of the irony!!! Seriously. He's so far in debt and the banks are taking the assets NO ONE will lend him a dime ever again. He's going to have MOUNTAINS of legal fees! It's absolutely brilliant!
1324756040773193734 2020-11-07 00:50:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ABSOLUTELY!
1324755932954460160 2020-11-07 00:50:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This new management will actually Make America Great Again because Trump destroyed it!
1324755476542853120 2020-11-07 00:48:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wait for what? We all have work to do to unite our country again. So, why not focus on that for a change? Too much to ask?
1324754888123928577 2020-11-07 00:45:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't think they will take their money-that's a sure thing...
1324754668677976065 2020-11-07 00:45:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No judgement here!
1324754567880466435 2020-11-07 00:44:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, American's are dead because he's greedy, lazy, ignorant, childish, absurd. He's ruined relations with our allies and put our National Security at risk and divided our nation. NO pardons or immunity and he faces ALL of his crimes!
1324753700980727809 2020-11-07 00:41:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think about that a little while longer if you are black. Read it again. Then read it again!
1324753133621432320 2020-11-07 00:38:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They better stay the Hell away form me!
1324753047990534150 2020-11-07 00:38:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And your whole gang goes with! TO PRISON! Whoo Hooo  https://t.co/sCEHrjE9J6
1324752251748032512 2020-11-07 00:35:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh and report this Tweet!
1324751594404151304 2020-11-07 00:32:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why doesn't he focus on his job? Joe was working on COVID briefings yesterday, and I know he's working today. Remember when Presidents worked? I know it's hard, but lazy ignorant fools who tweet all day and get their hair (in the singular form) did was not the way it used to be!
1324751163552616454 2020-11-07 00:31:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As long as we have a dialogue. That's America. We don't fight &amp; hate. We come up with alternatives that make the best of a bad situation like abortion. No one grows up saying Oh I want to have an abortion. NO ONE. So lets think about fixing that! Is birth control really THAT BAD?
1324750626576863232 2020-11-07 00:28:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I didn't want to retweet this because I try to save any negativity for the corrupt GOP but I've been attacked and called horrific things for supporting Joe, so I am retweeting this one. Hopefully I'll do better-maybe not!!!
1324750291879821317 2020-11-07 00:27:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh Jaime! In so many states you captured our attention of what a bright shining star and youthful leadership looks like! I know Joe will have a place for you to help heal our nation and you'll have a long and productive career ahead of you! We are so proud of you!
1324749899720785928 2020-11-07 00:26:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! So pathetic. I've never felt the threat of death over voting for my candidate-before this election. This is Trumps America. That thought would be laughable in 2012. People would think you lost your mind, but that's the state of 2020.
1324749514142568449 2020-11-07 00:24:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 25th! Just get him out. NOW!
1324748739802763265 2020-11-07 00:21:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How exactly do they "backdate" those ballots? Why would we actually believe anything you say KayLIE?
1324748450081214471 2020-11-07 00:20:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What do you think they are doing right now, playing tic tac toe all night long? These workers are BOTH Republicans and Democrats. STOP! You lost and you'll be voted out next!
1324748130202636288 2020-11-07 00:19:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kaitlancollins I already gave to the Biden Harris fund!
1324747769836412928 2020-11-07 00:17:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sorry, we beat you to it. We called on God to strip the Trump crime family of their positions.
1324747579339493376 2020-11-07 00:16:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FBI more domestic terrorism to investigate, and round up Bannon too, and this is like Jr's 57th attempt to incite violence upon American soil!!!!
1324747087800655874 2020-11-07 00:14:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She has a lot of work to do...the list is long and I'd actually start kissing her ass right now GOP we know about the stock market COVID trades! Think that's going away?
1324746902383009794 2020-11-07 00:14:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, he must have been on a long break, but now he's back!
1324746784300797952 2020-11-07 00:13:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RyannMcEnany @kayleighmcenany Snopes-FALSE! The footage was not digitally altered, but it was stripped from its original context. He was referring to his campaign’s efforts to protect the ballots of voters from what they presented as voter intimidation and false claims of voter fraud.
1324745152783618048 2020-11-07 00:07:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What Democratic infighting are you referring to?
1324744796938928129 2020-11-07 00:05:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump will either be in jail, or trying to defend himself in various jurisdictions on countless charges! Doubtful he or anyone in his crime family will be able to run. Might want to think of a better candidate if you want to even think of a Republican winning in 2024!
1324744444395032578 2020-11-07 00:04:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That sounds a tad illegal, we know about how many lies he's up to, how many offenses is he getting charged with?
1324744183584882690 2020-11-07 00:03:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FBI @NewYorkFBI @FBILosAngeles @fbizzarroneto Seriously, if I did this, I'd be locked up. He's actually out on bail doing this? What's the status here? Asking for about 327 million American's who would appreciate feeling safe in their country!
1324743282635788288 2020-11-06 23:59:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I thought that was the first and only ploy...it surely has not felt like reality since this reality dummy came on board!
1324742185686863874 2020-11-06 23:55:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who will marry Trump now??? Ha!!! Lets see I am looking for a fat, orange racist who whines, melts down, lies, cheats, steals, can't form a coherent sentence, can't dance, believes he's smarter than Drs &amp; scientists, calls our military heros suckers and losers, and drinks bleach
1324741420159217664 2020-11-06 23:52:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Absolutely! Drain that swamp!
1324741310511829001 2020-11-06 23:51:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'll do it!
1324741245223264263 2020-11-06 23:51:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are these so called illegally submitted ballots, are they the ones Jr.'s fake video showed being lit on fire? Were you saying this in 2016?
1324740645718790145 2020-11-06 23:49:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There is no someone, and there is no may...DeJoy WILL PAY!
1324740101755293697 2020-11-06 23:47:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!!!
1324739961862672386 2020-11-06 23:46:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That should not be allowed. He's committed multiple crimes. Just charge him with a few, and then we can do the rest later! He's daring enough to abuse the US Postal Service. Think of what a monster he is!
1324739521632751617 2020-11-06 23:44:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes!
1324739364262391808 2020-11-06 23:44:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lest we forget Trump University.
1324739172222066688 2020-11-06 23:43:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like Presidents who act like grown men!
1324739093578866688 2020-11-06 23:43:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss  https://t.co/RrX8MQN1hX
1324732263121256448 2020-11-06 23:15:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We still have work to do, but at least we can Can you take a breath and maybe just enjoy a nice long weekend! Then back to work for Georgia and let me tell you Mr. Harrison is going places
1324731406916964352 2020-11-06 23:12:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well it sounds like they are pretty damn un-American to me!
1324730502889299968 2020-11-06 23:08:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or maybe work on that COVID relief bill for its citizens! All they’ve been doing this entire presidency is working for the president and that’s actually not their job!
1324728409864458241 2020-11-06 23:00:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good point!
1324728199645986817 2020-11-06 22:59:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boycott Fox News and their advertisers
1324726346845736963 2020-11-06 22:52:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1324725908956160000 2020-11-06 22:50:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 @realDonaldTrump wonder how Fauci and his family are feeling?
1324725555900555264 2020-11-06 22:49:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @BetsyDeVosED The list of corrupt incompetent lying cheating screw everyone and get what they can is sooooo long!
1324724814939041798 2020-11-06 22:46:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He needs to be impeached right now for interfering with the election and just bottom right out the door into his new cell
1324724724350537729 2020-11-06 22:46:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes he’s an example of how we all should act. We are adults, no rants, no nasty names, no lies, no bullying, no laziness-and let’s count how many times he’s not out golfing-or should I say cheating at golf?
1324724010110885890 2020-11-06 22:43:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @B52Malmet I just walked away from my desk yesterday around 1:00-couldn’t function and didn’t want to mess anything up
1324723783438082052 2020-11-06 22:42:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @B52Malmet @Twitter Love and hugs! We did this! We have more work to do-think of the corrupt GOP
1324723305958510601 2020-11-06 22:40:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @B52Malmet Good! I need a catnap then I’ll be good. No sleep for days!
1324723138618400768 2020-11-06 22:39:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But you know what folks Joe has been in politics for 47 years he knows the best people unlike Trump says he does and they will fight any challenge that is pathetically put up by these losers
1324722905259925506 2020-11-06 22:38:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What? They wouldn’t be postmarked by November 3 so what are they talking about it’s too late you can’t just decide to go vote now it’s too late
1324722518448656384 2020-11-06 22:37:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pantomath__ I have a very serious question is that really a Mike Pence outfit?
1324722342581489664 2020-11-06 22:36:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss @B52Malmet I’m exhausted! How are you so on fire this morning?
1324722027597627393 2020-11-06 22:35:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Currently close to 73 million people believe can you count?
1324721503749971976 2020-11-06 22:33:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pantomath__ We did it!
1324721101088432129 2020-11-06 22:31:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are never getting away with it! We should’ve had the best Covid than any country in the world they helped kill almost 1/ quarter of 1 million of our American brothers and sisters and they are not going to ever get away with that! We will vote every single one of them out
1324720757692387330 2020-11-06 22:30:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s funny did we see any of these protesting for George Floyd or Breonna Taylor?
1324720091087470592 2020-11-06 22:27:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe they will pay his defense fees for all the criminal cases that are coming!
1324719514014142466 2020-11-06 22:25:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Bie Bie KayLIE. I’ve been waiting for her to be gone! Her tweets are shameful and so full of lies! Such a phony Christian

1324718856674267136 2020-11-06 22:22:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jason Miller calling for the arrest of the PA Sec of State. Sickening
1324716450951667714 2020-11-06 22:13:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey Kaylie, God is in control!
1324715223027224576 2020-11-06 22:08:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think of Harris County-DeJoy-this election would be staggeringly in favor of Joe without all this interference and resistors must work,to,vote them ALL out!

1324445161984794630 2020-11-06 04:15:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How much money did dummy who had it in the bag blow!

1324444494964629504 2020-11-06 04:12:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> DeJoy too-In massive amounts of cheating if you had those together that’s over 1 million votes folks! They still stand no chance of winning! Yay America we finally found ourselves again
1324443515498188801 2020-11-06 04:08:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Evidence? What’s that they ask? If we say it it must be true!
1324443078552408065 2020-11-06 04:06:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are ready!
1324442973556383749 2020-11-06 04:06:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CREWcrew Are you suing him?
1324442689383923721 2020-11-06 04:05:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @duty2warn I’ve waited long enough I‘m popping that cork shortly
1324442366351155201 2020-11-06 04:04:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @m_gn12 @Amatonterias1 @HillaryClinton Jeez-so sorry you have to do that-but can’t thank you enough!
1324442179645956096 2020-11-06 04:03:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We could’ve never done this without you!
1324441221536907266 2020-11-06 03:59:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @duty2warn Cheers!

1324439810401050624 2020-11-06 03:53:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where is all the hate from my Trumper’s today? I’ve gone all day without vile threats or insults what the fuck
1324439165820379141 2020-11-06 03:51:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> From prison? That might be a little tough logistically speaking but hey DeJoy might put his co to work!
1324438716648181760 2020-11-06 03:49:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good! No sense throwing away the last $14 they have!
1324438524846891009 2020-11-06 03:48:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock him out-oh and lets not forget-Lock him up! Not looking good Don the Con!
1324437706093580297 2020-11-06 03:45:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's chilling! Is tonight the night?
1324437073139535873 2020-11-06 03:42:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What rules are they breaking exactly? Who exactly is breaking what rule? In some states Trumpers want counts to stop, in others they want them to continue. Duh!
1324436671031582721 2020-11-06 03:41:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well when God tells us all that Joe is here to save us, I guess we will have to believe it's his will, wont we?
1324436259708805121 2020-11-06 03:39:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yep-so just suck it up!
1324436001859710978 2020-11-06 03:38:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know, I mean look at the Trump crime family!
1324435954816471040 2020-11-06 03:38:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then I guess Trump &amp; Associates are in for some real serious shit!
1324435876336861186 2020-11-06 03:38:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I guess you'll just never know then will you?
1324435292426743814 2020-11-06 03:35:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpStink
1324433215906603009 2020-11-06 03:27:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nope!
1324432147051065347 2020-11-06 03:23:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, can we tone down that orange some? Look at the contrast-yes folks-he's actually white like her....WTF"?
1324431788765257734 2020-11-06 03:21:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Probably once those 300,000 ballots give/take are found we will learn that is NOT true!
1324431583563128836 2020-11-06 03:21:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Loser! I really wanted to use all caps!
1324427145020669952 2020-11-06 03:03:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We should be proud of them, not nasty to them like the Trumpers! Imagine if they took time to acknowledge how many of them are actually Republicans and may have actually voted for Trump-and they are treating them like shit! What nasty people!
1324426853550034949 2020-11-06 03:02:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AmyAThatcher Same. I couldn't work at all, but got lots of housework done-like tore apart the stove all the crevices! My brain is on such high speed, but I can't concentrate on my clients today. Shame, but it is what it is!
1324426547852419072 2020-11-06 03:01:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Runoffs and 2022! As it is they are on thin thin ice. If they want an ounce of hope for their careers, they better reign this nightmare in. Remember the ones that are acting pathetic &amp; following his footsteps yesterday &amp; today too!
1324419000114257923 2020-11-06 02:31:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> From jail...uh excuse me warden can you let my campaign officials and I use the prison library today?
1324418739534745600 2020-11-06 02:30:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't let up resistors. Work hard for GA-they sure worked hard for us!
1324418562161664000 2020-11-06 02:29:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They lie about every freaking thing they put out there. How can a Trumper look a significant other, son, daughter, neighbor in the eye. Shame!
1324418254148902913 2020-11-06 02:28:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not from prison! Not possible. All of their crimes will be out well before 2024-well at least thousands of them, certainly not all of them! Trump still has not released his taxes or DNA in a rape case for crying out loud!
1324412613640523781 2020-11-06 02:05:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NOPE-the only fraud in this election is the slime in chief.
1324412258009653256 2020-11-06 02:04:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sue sue sue sue sue, don't pay bills, go bankrupt, don't follow science-because you know more about it! Thankfully COVID is over as Trump said it would disappear after Nov 3rd. I think Jr said that more times than daddy, but LETS SUE THEM for every dime they have!
1324411895202328579 2020-11-06 02:02:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not from prison!
1324411788465758209 2020-11-06 02:02:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well HE never pays his bills so...
1324411567077756928 2020-11-06 02:01:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Dknight10k America thanks you!
1324411355915583488 2020-11-06 02:00:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The walk of shame folks! If he had any that is.
1324411183160504322 2020-11-06 02:00:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay! One win we will let him have!
1324410545676701697 2020-11-06 01:57:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> More like Vile Land!!!

1324409969232515072 2020-11-06 01:55:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NEVER not for one of his thousands of crimes! NEVER ever ever ever. NEVER!
1324409345849888771 2020-11-06 01:52:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Poor Trumpers!
1324409038172495872 2020-11-06 01:51:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good Question Twitter! I keep reporting his, Jr. Kaylie's a lot!! Just report them.
1324408839215697920 2020-11-06 01:50:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @taradublinrocks @WahcaMia Doing it reporting all of their tweets
1324408444061974530 2020-11-06 01:49:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not possible! Trump said COVID would virtually disappear after Nov. 3rd. So, doctors, go home! Your work is done!
1324408187982929921 2020-11-06 01:48:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just keep reporting all the thugs and co's lies to Twitter!
1324407750479273984 2020-11-06 01:46:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We feel great Mr President! We feel great! Now invoke the 25th and lets forget this ever happened!
1324407486435233792 2020-11-06 01:45:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Your father and your entire family are are awful and out of touch with reality. We are sick of all of you. America is speaking. Stop whining! There is ZERO evidence of fraud, unless maybe you found it on Hunter's laptop!
1324398307452592128 2020-11-06 01:08:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who cares, whining, lying, division, what else would they have to say? Tired of this BS
1324387294414065666 2020-11-06 00:25:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets hope that's the case. I am very skeptical. I think they enjoy the hatred, division, and negativity.
1324367767173320704 2020-11-05 23:07:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Democrats, we need to show up for Georgia like Black Georgians showed up for the US.   All hands on deck.
1324367490315653121 2020-11-05 23:06:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 25 now
1324366871706116096 2020-11-05 23:04:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Arrest the joy today find a 300,000 votes he had for master Donald and the election is over
1324364989596131328 2020-11-05 22:56:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s all right we will just continue with lots of acting secretary’s
1324363510982258688 2020-11-05 22:50:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OK resistors we have two amazing candidates that need our support in the Georgia runoff! We need to fight for them every step of the way and do just what we did for Biden! Hallelujah!
1324362814027227136 2020-11-05 22:47:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously @Twitter and @Jack
1324361889317638145 2020-11-05 22:44:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @chrisdabear @sandboxpete Be safe!
1324361727849496576 2020-11-05 22:43:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Litter is right! Time to take out the trash
1324361062813208576 2020-11-05 22:40:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Traitor in every sense of the word
1324359247774310405 2020-11-05 22:33:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right-they turned in 12 ballots-NOT the estimated 300,000 that are missing
1324357192271749120 2020-11-05 22:25:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So you mean to tell me that Covid who President Trump said numbers will drop dramatically almost to nothing after November 3 was wrong yet again? Still has no plan still is not focusing on Covid and his only focusing on himself? What a country we live in!
1324356834266882048 2020-11-05 22:24:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like presidents who is tweets you don’t have to report
1324356785210314753 2020-11-05 22:23:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ReportsDaNews Done
1324355879391678470 2020-11-05 22:20:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hazing role models for their children and grandchildren! They are literally fighting to stop democracy
1324355584527912960 2020-11-05 22:19:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s just not true he said coronavirus cases with virtually disappear after November 3!
1324354866685349888 2020-11-05 22:16:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope their children and grandchildren watch the videos of them acting worse than little children!
1324354786418954241 2020-11-05 22:16:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has DeJoy been arrested yet
1324346597359144961 2020-11-05 21:43:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha
1324346117300039681 2020-11-05 21:41:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not possible! Trump assured us that there would be no Covid after November 3!
1324344935701774336 2020-11-05 21:36:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s no big deal! Joe will just put them on as acting, until they ever get their appointment just like Dumbo did
1324344548110323717 2020-11-05 21:35:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why are you talking about poles at this point? The election is over don’t you have better things to do like help us with a corona relief package
1324339779870330880 2020-11-05 21:16:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes and he better be paying for every single last one of them with his own money this time he’s wasted enough of ours!
1324339631446478850 2020-11-05 21:15:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because she’s a gremlin
1324338544471691265 2020-11-05 21:11:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He treated everyone in the world is ever interacted with, then he might have a better chance of winning this election. But he treats virtually everyone with the stain rudeness nastiness and arrogance!
1324338131928309762 2020-11-05 21:09:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey McConnell you might want to consider that Biden can’t put in anyone he wants on an acting basis just like your fool paved the way for! Karma is a beotch
1324337201098969088 2020-11-05 21:06:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They should be ashamed! Imagine when they snap out of this and know their kids can see this video their entire lives to be so proud of their parents!
1324336779986653185 2020-11-05 21:04:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> GA If you track your ballot and it didn’t count go fix it!
1324336371998380033 2020-11-05 21:02:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then he can simply do what Trump did!
1324336265362350081 2020-11-05 21:02:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And where are the 300,000 or so votes that the joy is hiding? When is he going to jail? We need to tweet this every day until he’s in prison! Imagine how excited we all were to vote and now imagine being one of those voters whose ballot has not counted!
1324335384298336256 2020-11-05 20:58:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Perfectly stated!
1324334827886313473 2020-11-05 20:56:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know!
1324334723188051969 2020-11-05 20:56:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha!
1324334579818397701 2020-11-05 20:55:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hopefully he’s long gone
1324334416538357764 2020-11-05 20:55:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davidmweissman @JoeBiden Come on Joe! Let GA have another runoff election too! Now we get Joe to give Jamie Harrison a cabinet position and will be in pretty good shape so far!
1324334240411095040 2020-11-05 20:54:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good morning everyone! Where is Donald J Trump? I think this is the longest he’s been off Twitter since it was in Walter Reed!
1324333400686297094 2020-11-05 20:51:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PissOffTrumpkin Tired 2 days no sleep

1324238094426669057 2020-11-05 14:32:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Even when. The election is over-this cannot be overlooked! Investigators and indictments
1324236635022778368 2020-11-05 14:26:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are the true patriots,those f-up whack jobs outside think that they’re
1324235707062341634 2020-11-05 14:22:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoyAnnReid But they worked so hard and only found like 12 or 13! Lock him up!
1324233450166095873 2020-11-05 14:13:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy they must have been working non stop-what a relief they found all those 12 ballots! DeJoy needs to go to jail RIGHT NOW!

1324228072162426880 2020-11-05 13:52:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump raised them and cast them upon us!

1324225499581874176 2020-11-05 13:42:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AdamParkhomenko Exactly-why are they closing? Remember the peaceful march in NC where they tear gassed CHILDREN?
1324225154008915968 2020-11-05 13:40:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine if they‘d be decent enough, let alone Christian enough to minor them with a vigil. Nope- might make baby boss look bad!
1324224337562509314 2020-11-05 13:37:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is America-really? We can’t even count election ballots?  https://t.co/JlmYFat1LN

1324207649383157760 2020-11-05 12:31:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seek justice-for what? Keep inciting violence!
1324206883184517120 2020-11-05 12:28:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FedUpInTheGOP Ha-let’s make a list
1324205107085496320 2020-11-05 12:21:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need to do so much better America! Jaime Harrison needs to a Biden cabinet member-he’s a future leader!
1324204723696734210 2020-11-05 12:19:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How dumb are they?
1324204164721856513 2020-11-05 12:17:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DievendorfJane @harrisonjaime @JoeBiden Joe will appoint him! Jaime is the future and he and Joe will work well together!
1324201562810580994 2020-11-05 12:07:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay, now,I’m actually imagining how funny that would  be! Meow
1324200679242665984 2020-11-05 12:03:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no. I am so sorry for your loss.
1324200037866496001 2020-11-05 12:01:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDFletcher2 @KimPowellTV Sorry just saw this. They are there now. The poll workers are safe.
1324192896606765060 2020-11-05 11:32:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hope you got his license plate and hope he goes to jail!
1324192464966688768 2020-11-05 11:31:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The World IS watching and criticizes Trump! International election observers rebuke Trump's 'unprecedented attempts to undermine public trust'.  https://t.co/9IYXDJZ9eS
1324189604744933377 2020-11-05 11:19:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Go GA &amp; demand a recount for Purdue!
1324188610430730243 2020-11-05 11:15:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So either he’s an incompetent demented idiot, or he lied yet again! Trumpers-any comment? You can only pick one of the two, so which one is he?
1324188217181147136 2020-11-05 11:14:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love this guy-he‘s so like Trump-the scandals are ridiculous and non stop@
1324186236173639680 2020-11-05 11:06:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Hurting2Ride @spmizner @ACLU Thank you!
1324185577118486530 2020-11-05 11:03:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well Joe-there is some evidence of mail tampering, election interference
1324185022694412288 2020-11-05 11:01:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How? Trump just said at his rally COVID numbers would disappear the day after the election-as in today. So-why y’all bringing this up today? It’s gone!
1324183967852056576 2020-11-05 10:57:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1324181870351966210 2020-11-05 10:48:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s appalling!
1324181538058215427 2020-11-05 10:47:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Recount!
1324180539243450369 2020-11-05 10:43:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Arrest him!
1324180441050611712 2020-11-05 10:43:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or stupidity over intelligence
1324180335257673729 2020-11-05 10:42:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey Trump-PROMISE BROKEN! You promised America FIVE LONG YEARS AGO that you’d release your taxes! Where are they? Hiding in your basement with you?
1324179884650934272 2020-11-05 10:41:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Looks like daddy might be regretting it’s little princess brushing the law non stop!
1324178923937214464 2020-11-05 10:37:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Got it!
1324178721151062019 2020-11-05 10:36:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don’t stop your support for him!
1324178512396378113 2020-11-05 10:35:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BleedingMarine One of them actually tweeted that show was the libs precursor to start conditioning  our minds for the fake COVID-so they could take away our freedom, and force masks! I wish I’d bookmarked it!
1324177960409116673 2020-11-05 10:33:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yep just another day in Trumps America!
1324177690727981056 2020-11-05 10:32:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s almost hard to get used to having hope for each other again!
1324177431914254336 2020-11-05 10:31:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pantomath__ Not a thing!
1324175648684937216 2020-11-05 10:24:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AND COVID was basically going to disappear the day after the election-remember COVID COVID VOVUD COVID CIVID, all they talk about is COVID...
1324174679620407296 2020-11-05 10:20:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course!
1324174392616779777 2020-11-05 10:19:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well said! Let’s preserve our most fundamental right for our future generations!
1324174192485392384 2020-11-05 10:18:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s a rational Trumper right there!
1324174119777259520 2020-11-05 10:18:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sure hope nutjob doesn’t have COVID
1324173487846629379 2020-11-05 10:15:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We do need these people in our country! How insane Trump has made them. The king complains so their little pea brains imitate him. I hope their children are proud of them thinking the Americans right to vote and have it actually counted is wrong!
1324172087355998208 2020-11-05 10:10:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really-can’t imagine what you are you going  through and how thoughtlessly he’s marginalized the difficulties and struggles you face! Grace be with you!
1324105362694410240 2020-11-05 05:44:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> STFU no safety. Go away...your dumbass leader is losing
1324104722836586499 2020-11-05 05:42:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who will he leach off of now?
1324104359840546819 2020-11-05 05:40:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump doesn't know how anything works. Really? We've heard some of the most stupid things ever said by man, let alone a President in the last 4 years!
1324103558241931264 2020-11-05 05:37:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh yeah, we have to remember that too!
1324103285326958595 2020-11-05 05:36:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then the arrests begin!
1324103228737396736 2020-11-05 05:36:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Check that box America!
1324103105391243267 2020-11-05 05:35:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NO ONE BETTER SPEND A FREAKING PENNY ON THAT HAGS BOOK!
1324102938919358464 2020-11-05 05:35:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amen! What a freak!
1324102867523903494 2020-11-05 05:34:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What are you retarded? There are plenty of people inside watching. Give them a break! Freak!
1324102403822682118 2020-11-05 05:33:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love you too! We still have work to do. I tell you, Jaime Harrison has a place in all of this yet! He will do remarkable things with Joe!
1324102228865634304 2020-11-05 05:32:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes it does! Mr. President.
1324102014381494275 2020-11-05 05:31:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A defining moment in our history!
1324101942453436431 2020-11-05 05:31:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Isn't it? A President who actually believes that all American's deserve his time and attention? Calling us the United States of America again? When did nutjob ever do that?
1324101551552679938 2020-11-05 05:29:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @costareports @BresPolitico It's amazing how some strong true Republicans have stood up to Trump! This is what America is about. You are actually ALLOWED to speak up to corruption and lies.
1324100645960507402 2020-11-05 05:26:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Biden_Army How blessed we are to have a dignified, unified leader for our country once again!
1324100493489176576 2020-11-05 05:25:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where did this video come from, Hunter's laptop?
1324100291281756162 2020-11-05 05:24:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, remember when meltdowns, tweetstorms, lying, cheating, stealing, name calling, inciting violence weren't coming from our President? Jesus!
1324099985412075521 2020-11-05 05:23:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kayleighmcenany God hates liars!
1324099913093963780 2020-11-05 05:23:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And won't have meltdowns, won't be nasty to others. Sorry Trumpers you'll all have to start behaving like normal human beings again.
1324099593508892675 2020-11-05 05:21:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am so tired of meltdowns. This is such a stupid election. This poor little baby needs to go and find someplace else to meltdown!
1324099419453751296 2020-11-05 05:21:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @chipfranklin @JoeBiden I'd love to tell you, but I probably won't remember!!!
1324099280739643395 2020-11-05 05:20:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Poor Kayleigh-Joe has more votes than ANY Presidential candidate in this Nation's history! Run your mouth and look like an idiot.
1324098630496722950 2020-11-05 05:18:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, class and dignity. He remembers that the entire world is watching. Cheeto head does not. He's drunk on power and greed.
1324098472803532805 2020-11-05 05:17:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a speech Mr. President Elect! Joe's speaks to every American, not one group. This is not high school, this is not a clique. This is our country! This is ONE NATION FOR ALL.
1324096485051518991 2020-11-05 05:09:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> GA Track your vote! GA Track your vote! Don't be complacent. Stand up and make sure your vote is counted. FIX any issues you have!
1324094491314262021 2020-11-05 05:01:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What idiots! Who does that?
1324093928816214017 2020-11-05 04:59:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes he can!
1324093665749438473 2020-11-05 04:58:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am sure he has a place for you Jaime! We need a leader like you!
1324073028637106176 2020-11-05 03:36:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Damn...no more whining and twitter temper tantrums.
1324072359159046145 2020-11-05 03:33:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Loser will then go to jail, and we move on!
1324072148336607238 2020-11-05 03:32:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Go Joe-More votes than ANY presidential candidate in American History. I like how that sounds. I'll be singing that all day now!
1324071798368075776 2020-11-05 03:31:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HKrassenstein President Biden!
1324070650290577411 2020-11-05 03:26:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey Trump, what do we do now that COVID has completely gone away today? Did you remind the world too? Today is one of many days you said will simply disappear.
1324070387915886593 2020-11-05 03:25:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nice folks aren't they?
1324069935497228299 2020-11-05 03:24:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @nixw20 Hang in there!
1324060926295875590 2020-11-05 02:48:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> My thoughts exactly !
1324060663661158401 2020-11-05 02:47:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Quack quack
1324060388883898369 2020-11-05 02:46:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDeLong62 @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden Yes but a President normalizing life again will go a long way! We have learned shame on us, that being complacent and letting government get like this is not acceptable! I think we drew in a ton of young voters who will also put in more work than we expect!
1324057545212895232 2020-11-05 02:34:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Brilliant!
1324057442964090885 2020-11-05 02:34:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Go GA!!!!
1324057344922263553 2020-11-05 02:34:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDeLong62 @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden Yes we do! We need to turn politics back into the public service it was mean to be.
1324056978222686208 2020-11-05 02:32:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let out a very long sigh of relief.
1324056850720034822 2020-11-05 02:32:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ddale8 OMG you have to stop this cuteness! I can't take it!
1324056627574673409 2020-11-05 02:31:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He needs to pay us back!
1324056431637778434 2020-11-05 02:30:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDeLong62 @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden I know, and I agree.
1324056165957931008 2020-11-05 02:29:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hooray! @JoeBiden has received more votes for president than any other candidate in Flag of United States history!
1324056083984457739 2020-11-05 02:29:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Might come to that! Which half? I need warm!
1324055753376845824 2020-11-05 02:27:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What she said~NOW
1324055685076819973 2020-11-05 02:27:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HamillHimself Oh no!
1324055567606972419 2020-11-05 02:27:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDeLong62 @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden No, Biden is going to win this. Do not lose hope. It's all going his way, be patient. My tiny rural area had DOUBLE the COVID cases yesterday of our highest day EVER. My neighbors go on with life as usual, we have a death every 100 cases, we have about 3 hospitalized every 40!
1324055169462657026 2020-11-05 02:25:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's so embarrassing to be white right now. I just can't understand any of this at all. If your eyes weren't opened after all that happened, then yes-you see black people as animals, not humans. You know what-that actually makes you the animal, not a human!
1324054471505289217 2020-11-05 02:22:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Comply now, or go to jail now. Still going to jail either way, but come on!
1324054343641894914 2020-11-05 02:22:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There is so much irony here, where do I start?
1324054168018059266 2020-11-05 02:21:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag @TrumpsTaxes Of course, the virus is gone! Around the world even. What are they thinking...
1324053845413167108 2020-11-05 02:20:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDeLong62 @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden There were some devastating losses for sure. I hope Biden puts some of those candidates to good use! The world needs those leaders NOW! Jaime Harrison was just the starkest contrast to lying Lindsey...we need our strong young leaders to get in and work hard for us!
1324053404629508096 2020-11-05 02:18:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I was ready at 5:00 am!
1324053270135005185 2020-11-05 02:17:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Track your ballot! Call the ACLU, call the press. Do anything if your ballot has not been counted!
1324053176690135043 2020-11-05 02:17:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dedesonntag @TrumpsTaxes We knew the mail in ballots would be mostly Joe, Donnie said more times than we can count not to vote by mail. No one listens to him but Trumpers, so it's kinda cool that he has to sit and wait like this and just get more and more bad news!
1324052869524398080 2020-11-05 02:16:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Bravo to so many that have done so much for our country. True patriots.
1324052740654436354 2020-11-05 02:15:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @chefrocky413 Hey we are all right there with you! Hope, peace, compassion, change, leadership. I mean who won't be tearing up?
1324052097285918721 2020-11-05 02:13:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am sure once all actual votes are found hiding in USPS and counted, little loser will be adding states to that recount cry like they are on fire!
1324051613238153218 2020-11-05 02:11:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes we do! Unaccaptible any other way !
1324051362951372802 2020-11-05 02:10:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets welcome our 46th President of the United States Joe Biden!
1324051080884400134 2020-11-05 02:09:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DemNevada @MollyBeck Sure...
1324050861321048065 2020-11-05 02:08:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss I know we have so much to deal with, but these people need to be testifying until they are jailed for life. What we have been through, &amp; I only have a distant in-law that died from COVID, not someone close to me (yet) what Trumps mocking did to them &amp; healthcare workers...
1324050222079713289 2020-11-05 02:05:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just keep reporting him!
1324050090798010369 2020-11-05 02:05:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly-why are investigators not in the middle of this?
1324049945528307713 2020-11-05 02:04:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trumpshairypuss Of course! I am really worried when he shifts his focus from trying to win, to trying to drain our treasury dry before he leaves.
1324049769367482369 2020-11-05 02:03:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Please keep investigating him! His behavior is appalling and criminal!
1324049521052127234 2020-11-05 02:03:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @thockman64 @outward_rant It's sobering.
1324049459593043970 2020-11-05 02:02:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh he would never pay that-you and I are going to pay for that.
1324049332761432069 2020-11-05 02:02:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Enjoying this stage of his losing.
1324049171268206593 2020-11-05 02:01:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sure they did!
1324049085008138240 2020-11-05 02:01:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CoreyRForrester Okay, but how many have you chugged today! Ha! Just teasing!
1324048875053817859 2020-11-05 02:00:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine if Trump wins...we will never vote again. That's his big picture.
1324048584761901058 2020-11-05 01:59:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are behind you all the way!
1324048442231017474 2020-11-05 01:58:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mstone1104 So Sorry! Happy Birthday-guess we all have a lot on our minds today! 🎂🎂🎂
1324048221447049219 2020-11-05 01:57:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think DeJoy should be personally sued by anyone whose ballot was lost on his watch!
1324048130636218368 2020-11-05 01:57:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I do too! Ballot tracking needs to be part of the investigation. ACLU.
1324047961572233223 2020-11-05 01:56:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TheRickyDavila We all called it! Relax, Trump may think he can bully and corrupt everyone, we are smarter, stronger, and so much better than he is!
1324047502660771842 2020-11-05 01:54:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We want all the votes sitting in the USPS that DeJoy just ignored a federal judge demanding they be produced and counted...this is insane! What's wrong with our country?
1324047230064615431 2020-11-05 01:53:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Instead of exuding any dignity or grace that you might want to expect from a world leader....he's going off on these rage tweets full of lies! America-what have you done ?
1324046915152084995 2020-11-05 01:52:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why? Isn't this slightly important? It seems odd...
1324046824332759040 2020-11-05 01:52:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did you expect dignity and diplomacy from this shallow little man?
1324046310085922818 2020-11-05 01:50:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or @kayleighmcenany either!
1324046197129121795 2020-11-05 01:49:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mimimagic @jacobbogage Lips are sealed!
1324046102384070658 2020-11-05 01:49:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, imagine living here with them! You have no idea how nasty some of them are. They still think COVID is not real, only affects 98 year olds with no organs left, and is not contagious. They call us names, mock us, threaten us.
1324045773588336640 2020-11-05 01:48:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks for this information! Looking good!
1324045551285972993 2020-11-05 01:47:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy SC!!
1324045443186262017 2020-11-05 01:46:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mimimagic @jacobbogage Couldn't agree more, but actually he needs to be imprisoned for life for what we actually now he has done, let alone what will be revealed.
1324044859313967110 2020-11-05 01:44:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> LOCK IT DOWN AND LOCK HIM UP
1324044741114269702 2020-11-05 01:44:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's so sad.
1324044594674311170 2020-11-05 01:43:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Cleavon_MD Me too. I think we will be reporting all of them today!
1324044287638704128 2020-11-05 01:42:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RonGOPVet4Biden Yes it is! Keep an eye on NC!
1324044037851172870 2020-11-05 01:41:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> BLUE NC don't let us down!!!
1324043909543137280 2020-11-05 01:40:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then detain him NOW! This is not a few misplaced greeting cards folks!
1324043792295419904 2020-11-05 01:40:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who does this "sweep" we need inspectors NOW!
1324043636162613249 2020-11-05 01:39:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets remember he's received MORE VOTES than any candidate in history-even with all this other stuff going on!
1324042599146102787 2020-11-05 01:35:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ACLU-track your ballots! Detain DeJoy and get inspectors in there NOW!
1324042498034065408 2020-11-05 01:35:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He just ignored it. Guess we all do that from now on!
1324042291204497410 2020-11-05 01:34:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nope!
1324042196396494851 2020-11-05 01:33:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What?
1324041885258813440 2020-11-05 01:32:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> For life!
1324041782024425477 2020-11-05 01:32:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why NV saying no new numbers until tomorrow? That seems a little odd. Shouldn't this be just a little bit of a priority?
1324041170528407552 2020-11-05 01:29:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Months!!! Why are we tiptoeing around this?
1324040837341335552 2020-11-05 01:28:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> DETAIN DEJOY NOW
1324040667211927555 2020-11-05 01:27:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> INVESTIGATE NOW
1324040614623748097 2020-11-05 01:27:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Have you interviewed the squirrels yet?
1324040206970953728 2020-11-05 01:25:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As in today?
1324040108283219970 2020-11-05 01:25:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At some point, NOW! This is not a few articles of lost mail. This is HUGE CORRUPTION AND THEIVERY.
1324038099761057802 2020-11-05 01:17:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Stay strong Governor!
1324037854847258630 2020-11-05 01:16:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davidmweissman Of course we accepted you! This man is a conman. It's the way he's lived his entire life. You are not alone.
1324037602622771201 2020-11-05 01:15:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!
1324037310720200707 2020-11-05 01:14:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Weinsteinlaw thank you
1324037271352414209 2020-11-05 01:14:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! Let me be very clear! ONLY ONE administration tried to make it harder for blacks to vote. ONLY ONE! Sure  hope you didn't vote for that one.
1324037073100300292 2020-11-05 01:13:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Inspectors need to get in there NOW! What's the wait-what is going on here? We saw this, he refused a federal judges order!
1324036271237419010 2020-11-05 01:10:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha
1324036142916902913 2020-11-05 01:09:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's been amazing! What an inspiration.
1324035880550567940 2020-11-05 01:08:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Might, what is might? Someone(s) HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES! WTF?
1324035772983480323 2020-11-05 01:08:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> People need to track their ballots! Demand they be found and counted. Laziness and corruption does not enter into our election! Trump keeps saying that-lets make him actually live that!
1324031672426352641 2020-11-05 00:52:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick We can most certainly agree on that!
1324031366485463041 2020-11-05 00:50:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such a petty spiteful little worthless pig. Sorry I am over it!
1324030897532948481 2020-11-05 00:48:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDFletcher2 @people4kam Thank you!!! You have no idea.
1324030253589762048 2020-11-05 00:46:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Track your ballots! Track your ballots!
1324030135553720321 2020-11-05 00:45:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Everyone hates you!
1324029978716082176 2020-11-05 00:45:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I voted blue down the ballot!
1324029849409867776 2020-11-05 00:44:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1324029625975164937 2020-11-05 00:43:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Track your ballots folks!
1324029388401319938 2020-11-05 00:43:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 27% Everyone needs to track their ballot. That's unthinkable!
1324029143223308288 2020-11-05 00:42:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ACLU, civil action lawsuit if your ballot is not tracked and accepted!
1324029065276329984 2020-11-05 00:41:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are they? Everyone should track their ballot and DEMAND it be counted!
1324028821503356933 2020-11-05 00:40:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @nixw20 We are almost there!
1324028738842038272 2020-11-05 00:40:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Phew!
1324028322708398082 2020-11-05 00:38:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love this!
1324028144001626113 2020-11-05 00:38:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Penny_816 @HenryRambow Shhh It's done.
1324028105598603265 2020-11-05 00:37:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not a thing!
1324028068705521667 2020-11-05 00:37:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why don't you like me, I am trying to get your menfolk back to work, get you more water pressure in your dishwashers, and expect you to homeschool and manage your career?
1324027858608685066 2020-11-05 00:36:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why? Why aren't they going in there and getting the job done? You really trust DeJoy after all this? Why? Why are we not standing up to this corruption? It's pathetic!
1324027634976804864 2020-11-05 00:36:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I want all the votes DeJoy is hiding!
1324027463475802112 2020-11-05 00:35:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha ha!
1324027152803729408 2020-11-05 00:34:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @people4kam Ha! I know, but we need to get to the unifying. Now if Trump wins. IDK if I can forgive, but Joe has really got this!
1324026955616952321 2020-11-05 00:33:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, they need to look seriously hard at DeJoy!
1324025273000538112 2020-11-05 00:26:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, we need inspectors in there NOW. What is with the Democrats? This is tampering with the US Mail. Why does no one do anything about these people? Why?
1324025011003416579 2020-11-05 00:25:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FedUpInTheGOP It's so sad. Some people-I get it. They were waiting for this for a very long time. We are in the South. But not my alleged normal friends and family! I had someone say they couldn't even listen to Biden because he just yells all the time. Sleepy Joe....
1324024583666737154 2020-11-05 00:23:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What an idiot!
1324024513022013441 2020-11-05 00:23:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG! You voted for this America! Good luck ever getting any help again!
1324006462700609537 2020-11-04 23:11:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FedUpInTheGOP Well Jaime is going places. He's the next generation in politics. He's going to be a great leader! We all have to support him, and encourage this type of leadership!
1324006175696949253 2020-11-04 23:10:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1324006111469539328 2020-11-04 23:10:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What Geraldo? What was that?
1324005825313181696 2020-11-04 23:09:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @people4kam I think we will all be too exhausted to celebrate! Might just be a long weekend!
1324005664948166656 2020-11-04 23:08:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> EVER
1324005534593355777 2020-11-04 23:08:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is the Trump voter in a nutshell. What are they so angry about? Working so hard forever for nothing so that folks like Trump get rich off their backs? Hmmmmm glad they think Trump will solve that problem.
1324005227901689861 2020-11-04 23:06:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FedUpInTheGOP Ha, but come on! There were a lot of black folks voting. No way any of them were voting for him! Not simply because Jaime was black. He was inspiring! I kept giving to his campaign, and I live in NC! Around the country people were awed by him! IDK.
1324004917183467521 2020-11-04 23:05:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Tronsmash Ha, they scare the F out of me!! OMG. I just never realized there were so many of them. Not all of them look like this, a lot must do a great job of hiding it. I am sickened. If events of this last year couldn't open their hearts-goosebumps just imagining what is in their souls.
1324004538983026688 2020-11-04 23:04:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Track your ballots!!!!!!!! Make sure they are counted.
1324004287047995393 2020-11-04 23:03:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HKrassenstein @feloneouscat Thanks for that Tweet!!! That's like an instant burst of sunshine and hope mingled together!
1324004035926642691 2020-11-04 23:02:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Tronsmash Hey wait, I am white...I voted for equality, protection, and justice for all.
1324003884675850243 2020-11-04 23:01:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ducksinmypool @AngrierWHStaff @DonaldJTrumpJr I think not only counting ballots, but tracking ballots. Trump has done multiple highly unthinkable things. He's had lots of time and help to prepare for this.
1324003700042588161 2020-11-04 23:00:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FedUpInTheGOP I have a dear friend that is intelligent, educated, compassionate, worked hard all her life. Is very giving and posted on FB yesterday that she voted for Trump because God sent him to save America. What do you say to that?
1324002889837256704 2020-11-04 22:57:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ducksinmypool @AngrierWHStaff @DonaldJTrumpJr Post Office sitting on ballots?
1324002775471165442 2020-11-04 22:57:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Also the way he's treated women, treated politicians in our own country, treated our allies. I guess American's like horrid treatment of others by one greedy arrogant SOB?
1324001975869050880 2020-11-04 22:54:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is now called Trumphateland
1324001420014735361 2020-11-04 22:51:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @davidmweissman Bernie had way too many obstacles to overcome. If we can barely get a Democrat elected...how would Bernie win? I am not trying to be mean, but he would not have swayed one Republican voter like Joe has.
1324000940005986305 2020-11-04 22:49:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @funder Better! Still very disappointed in my fellow American's who believe in hate and greed and corruption though.
1324000526091145216 2020-11-04 22:48:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type Mail in ballots still out in NC! We will do this! I think they may announce those shortly.
1323999961957175302 2020-11-04 22:46:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When?????
1323999756746694656 2020-11-04 22:45:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If he wins, we won't even have the right to vote again. Ever.
1323999661695373317 2020-11-04 22:44:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How did Jaime Harrison lose by that much? He was amazing. He held his ground, he was a breath of fresh air. I am so disappointed in NC!
1323999412767567874 2020-11-04 22:43:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @FPWellman @HamillHimself Thank you!!!
1323998988362747904 2020-11-04 22:42:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1323998912705826816 2020-11-04 22:41:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type When President Biden and Vice President Harris are in office, we will heal. It will be a very slow movement, but we will go back to a more normal America. Then, we cannot stop until we have equality and justice for all. That's what America stands for.
1323998555443441665 2020-11-04 22:40:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So sad to be white and knowing how bad this country is. I voted blue down the ballot, I want change, and I want equality, and I want JUSTICE FOR ALL! Trump cannot win. I repeat, Trump cannot win, or we are all lost.
1323998070477082627 2020-11-04 22:38:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine what will actually be revealed when all of his crimes come to light!
1323997840234979330 2020-11-04 22:37:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @wulfe333_stacy @tertree8 It's quite frightening. Imagine what will happen to them if Trump wins.
1323997651722031106 2020-11-04 22:36:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Actually doing our duty to our country is now fraud...and cheating...has Dejoy delivered the 300000 ballots yet?
1323997481903030273 2020-11-04 22:36:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh I am so stealing that idea!
1323997298595123201 2020-11-04 22:35:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I say we all become lying greedy pigs who don't pay bills, rip people off, mock others, just take what we can get! F-it!
1323996962551664641 2020-11-04 22:34:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Fear of Democrats-Sleepy Joe, Joe is too calm...what's to fear? I keep getting called a communist and a diseased liberal and a socialist, even though like you I was a Republican who decided one little piss ant tyrant is not going to destroy us...now I am painted with this brush.
1323996368977989634 2020-11-04 22:31:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @OhNoSheTwitnt Remember, Trump said COVID is over today! We beat it.
1323996272139915264 2020-11-04 22:31:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are the Miami Dade USPS ballots?
1323996198592798722 2020-11-04 22:31:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly!
1323995906635685890 2020-11-04 22:29:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good Morning Everyone! Yay, it's the day after the election so we are COVID FREE TODAY as Trump said! What a relief. Especially because where I live, yesterday we reported 50% more cases than our last highest day ever! So tomorrow NONE! Way to go. Our healthcare workers are done!
1323995527579684866 2020-11-04 22:28:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sad for his family, good thing it affects only the severely old and vulnerable.
1323994945133445121 2020-11-04 22:26:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden You guys are true patriots and hero's for all that you have done for our country! Thank you so much for standing up the way you have.

1323771768218226689 2020-11-04 07:39:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How can you just ignore a federal judge's order?

1323771265803603968 2020-11-04 07:37:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? We just ignore a federal judge's order in America? Then why do we even have them? DeJoy is sicko!
1323771135729799170 2020-11-04 07:36:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I really don't care. Looking forward to the future. I am hoping he just sneaks away like a thief in the night and we can move forward!!!!
1323770946558300164 2020-11-04 07:36:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? This is Trumps America, you just turn down a federal judge's order?

1323684224843632644 2020-11-04 01:51:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Correct a Biden landslide!
1323682969517723654 2020-11-04 01:46:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Funny how one sounds so reasonable, and willing to work with others. The other sounds like a conceited little child-willing to threaten and mock others.
1323682111430234113 2020-11-04 01:43:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HeavenOrHellGod Haven't made up my mind yet. 30 seconds, 30 minutes, 3 hours...
1323681740053979137 2020-11-04 01:41:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @chrislhayes But all the numbers drop tomorrow! It's not real.
1323680901272948738 2020-11-04 01:38:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Every day a scandal, an arrest, a nasty tweet, inciting violence and division. Yes, he's shown us every day what a monster he is. Vote him out! Today is the DAY!
1323679025705951233 2020-11-04 01:30:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Go Hallmark Channel! That's what sleepy Joe would be watching!
1323678852816736260 2020-11-04 01:30:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes it does! I don't know how they can live with the shame and humiliation!
1323678502277754881 2020-11-04 01:28:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I thought this affected virtually no one. All must be nobodies in Trumps eyes.
1323678259826040833 2020-11-04 01:27:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The last living former Republican president, George W. Bush, has said he won’t back Trump. Nor will his brother Jeb Bush
1323677997149364224 2020-11-04 01:26:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ryan Mahoney, who served as the Republican National Committee’s communications director as recently as 2019, tweeted, “Proud to vote country over party Proud to vote for @JoeBiden.”
1323677901284352005 2020-11-04 01:26:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 20 former U.S. Attorneys under Republican presidents going back to Dwight Eisenhower, including Donald Ayer, who served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada under George H.W. Bush – gave Biden their “strongest endorsement  alleging Trump has “politicized the Justice Dept.
1323677599940386821 2020-11-04 01:25:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember who endorsed Biden NOT Trump: 73 former US national security officials in the REPUBLICAN administrations, including former heads of the CIA, FBI &amp; Trump administration officials, endorsed Biden, asserting Trump’s “corrupt behavior renders him unfit to serve as president"
1323677031373119496 2020-11-04 01:22:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Biden has the endorsements of FOUR Republican cabinet secretaries; Obama administration Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and Bush administration Secretary of State Colin Powell and EPA Director Christine Whitman
1323675952069681152 2020-11-04 01:18:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great comment!! ‘Biden 2020: look, at least you can take your eye off him for five minutes’.
1323675602684096518 2020-11-04 01:17:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good!

1323649881039425538 2020-11-03 23:34:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick As of November 1, Rwanda and Senegal, for example, have reported 0.28 and 2.04 Covid deaths per 100,000 people respectively, while the corresponding number for the US is a staggering 70.4. Rwandans are now allowed to travel to Europe, while Americans remain prohibited.

1323648511259398148 2020-11-03 23:29:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MasterOfMoxie @Twitter Really-we've had to face a Tweeting lunatic all this time. It's so funny that his supporters seem to think his job is just to tweet all day. He will be insignificant soon!
1323646898218086401 2020-11-03 23:23:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TheDailyEdge Delish!
1323646646350237696 2020-11-03 23:22:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you Canada! Wish you could make more American's understand that the world see's this shit storm. These Trumpers are so brainwashed. They will argue that COVID is just a scare tactic, no worse than the flu. Even though we have tapes of Trump saying it's much more deadly.
1323645677528879105 2020-11-03 23:18:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> BBC Reports:  Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in most national polls since the start of the year. He has hovered around 50% in recent months and has had a 10-point lead on occasions.
1323644900970274819 2020-11-03 23:15:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Probably hacked.
1323644536585887744 2020-11-03 23:13:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type That's great! Hugs!!
1323644415638970377 2020-11-03 23:13:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right and there will be what zero cases tomorrow after the election? This is affecting every country-except the ones who did what was necessary. I suppose you believe doctors are liars and cheats who just call a death COVID to steal from us? I suppose they also stole PPE?
1323642284152442881 2020-11-03 23:04:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LSD122070 Probably MSNBC, CNN has been way to soft on Trump and his advisors, administration. Once in a while they impress me, but the other times they just let stuff ride...
1323641863010746368 2020-11-03 23:03:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's a virus-do you not see this? I'll take mask shaming over mask mocking during a world wide pandemic any day! Think about it.
1323640596821659650 2020-11-03 22:58:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did they all sign waivers? It's a freaking virus! It's spread world wide! I never knew how many freaking positively ignorant fools we had living amongst us!

1323638000534855680 2020-11-03 22:47:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Cowards! Their silence has been deafening. Just like Trumps silence on the Russian Bounty. Never allow American's to act like this again. Completely undignified. It's an embarrassment!

1321969081717870593 2020-10-30 08:16:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joelockhart Psh-it’s just out testing per capita!
1321938481267048452 2020-10-30 06:14:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GeorgeTakei @beanveron His passing was sad enough, but at this moment in our history it's also regrettable. He would not stop speaking out against injustice, no matter the cost or consequences. We don't see that bravery much...
1321936594044157954 2020-10-30 06:06:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan As much as it stinks...we are in a pretty hot mess right now. Going up and up every day...probably not safe.

1321869956888338432 2020-10-30 01:42:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 It's a matter of belief that it even matters. It's really a shame. No one wants this, but I'd rather suffer a mask in public places than kill someone else! No brainer...
1321858368160600066 2020-10-30 00:56:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no. I wish you the best!! Get well soon!
1321857892778201088 2020-10-30 00:54:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Jessicam6946 My state has a mask mandate. I had to swing by two Post Office's yesterday. People came in without masks, and the one postal employee wearing one had it below her nose. It only covered her mouth. Why is this so difficult! You can teach a 4 year old how to do it...
1321842021406003202 2020-10-29 23:51:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JAkinWalker Prayers for you and your family!

1321832431008309248 2020-10-29 23:13:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But Hunter...really? How many "associates" of Trump, Campaign people, etc. have been arrested or indicted?

1321817791880667138 2020-10-29 22:14:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why won't his followers believe all the brave men and women like yourself who have spoken up?
1321817667779657730 2020-10-29 22:14:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you sir!
1321808741705146375 2020-10-29 21:38:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He is an unhinged lunatic!
1321807735684538373 2020-10-29 21:34:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Isn't that pathetic?
1321807274059436033 2020-10-29 21:33:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you! It's amazing that any patriot would support Trump. His silence on the Russian Bounty is DEAFENING! The world has been listening and waiting just like the rest of us. That's unforgivable!
1321807018592768004 2020-10-29 21:32:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is that evidence hiding in those mysterious documents that disappeared? What about Trumps $25M Chinese Bank account that he removed 17 Million from in 2017? Where are Trumps taxes he promised in 2015? Biden released his!
1321793913422782464 2020-10-29 20:40:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NO, Trump being caught bending rules to help a dictator?
1321793759940665345 2020-10-29 20:39:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But no worries, Trump is getting our manfolk back to work, so we can crochet lace doilies!
1321793500925612034 2020-10-29 20:38:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So play it for her and then re-ask the question!
1321793252798926848 2020-10-29 20:37:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> True to his pathetically genuine uncaring nature!
1321793044929253376 2020-10-29 20:36:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump “has desecrated the values that make America a beacon to the world.” And then some!
1321652156680802305 2020-10-29 11:16:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The footage is coming soon!

1321651583642460160 2020-10-29 11:14:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can’t believe they would do that! No more cookies for me either! Too much of a bad taste in my mouth!

1321636719163330561 2020-10-29 10:15:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The Governor should sue him! Plus, now needs 24 hour protection cause death threats are coming you sick crazy F)cks!
1321636362169290755 2020-10-29 10:13:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Duh-I’m an idiot, sucker. Loser-vote for me, and also, why won’t you like me, Or be fair to me?
1321636155620839424 2020-10-29 10:13:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who in their right mind believes this? Seriously-I know the Trump train only males one stop-Crazyville-but come on! And still-mocking masks as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths surge!
1321635732692340737 2020-10-29 10:11:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So what crazy conspiracy theory are your viewers left with? Sleepy Joe who can’t leave the basement without help is a njnaja assassi who stole the alleged papers from the FBI?

1321633355444719616 2020-10-29 10:02:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So what disinformation Trump is spreading means we suffer until 2022!
1321628173767970818 2020-10-29 09:41:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, if we play it for her, then what will she say? That sounds like someone she'd want her daughter to date?
1321591761689546752 2020-10-29 07:16:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That doesn't sound suspicious, does it?
1321591580583694337 2020-10-29 07:16:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is illegal and outrageous!
1321591472253243392 2020-10-29 07:15:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The person who shovels the #*)* from an elephant cage at the zoo?
1321591279529172993 2020-10-29 07:14:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Here here! Melania wouldn't even say the Pledge of Allegiance on 9/11/2020! What a pig! She refuses to say that, but lives in our White House? Disgusting!
1321590972204146688 2020-10-29 07:13:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They were bullied! 1 is still fighting &amp; has the courage to not give up. If Trump wanted to prove he was innocent, he could release his DNA. You'd want your sister dating a man who says he just grabs em by the pussy? Barges into Miss Teen DRESSING ROOMS-CHILDRENS dressing rooms?
1321590474612813825 2020-10-29 07:11:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh really? Then why is his campaign flat broke and who is he 1.1 BILLION in debt to? Where are the taxes he promised to release in 2015?
1321590264939630593 2020-10-29 07:10:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> To this administration at least.

1321590022450065409 2020-10-29 07:09:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 20 REPUBLICAN former US attorneys endorse Biden!
1321589807643054083 2020-10-29 07:08:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's such a loser! How can any woman stand to vote for him? All that we have done, to get where we are, most of the time, having to work twice as hard as a man to get promoted and NEVER getting anywhere near the same pay! Trumps eyes folks!
1321589251432210432 2020-10-29 07:06:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> See, you give them black folks a hand, but since they don't even want to be successful, what more can we do? Take me, I grew up into elite wealth and never worried where our families meal was coming from. Why can't blacks do better?
1321588979997777921 2020-10-29 07:05:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously! In 2019 and 2020, Trump shelled out $12.95 million in legal bills, according to campaign data filed with the FEC by its final pre-election reporting deadline of Oct. 22. That's more than six times the $1.99 million his opponent Joe Biden has spent.
1321588717337923584 2020-10-29 07:04:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote for 227,000 dead fathers, sisters, best friends, neighbors, doctors, children, police officers, teachers, bus drivers, grandparents, musicians, that Trump killed!
1321588052716855297 2020-10-29 07:02:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> America must be able to keep our word—and with @JoeBiden as president, we will restore America's credibility.
1321587919426080768 2020-10-29 07:01:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Period enough said! 124 days where Trump has proven his loyalty to Putin over American lives.
1321587396199260160 2020-10-29 06:59:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I wonder if any Trumpers will actually listen to people like this coming out in astonishing numbers!

1321584601907761152 2020-10-29 06:48:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are that dumb! Wouldn't want him to date their daughter but want him to be President?
1321583982291673088 2020-10-29 06:45:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You forgot, one does nothing but whine either. It's not Biden! Trump whines, pouts, complains, demeans, lies, spews hate, and pretends COVID has disappeared completely when we are just about 9 MILLION cases now!
1321583485849608193 2020-10-29 06:43:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are so honored that you do this, so the nation can see the serious faults in our National Security thanks to Trump!
1321582758335053830 2020-10-29 06:40:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amen!
1321582136554622976 2020-10-29 06:38:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I rejoice ever day when I remember Trump was taking a mere 15 COVID cases down to Zero, but actually took them down to 8.9 MILLION! 1000 die a day and he pats himself on the back for doing absolutely nothing and still holds super spreaders. He's sick! Vote him out!
1321581376030822401 2020-10-29 06:35:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wait a minute, Trump lied? When, oh that's right...
1321580693776977921 2020-10-29 06:32:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has he made a statement about this? He cares about nothing but himself!
1321580491464712193 2020-10-29 06:31:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I have never heard anything so stupid in my life! What our real leaders in other countries thinking when they hear this stupidity? We are no longer a super power folks!

1321575572556943366 2020-10-29 06:12:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He will also fight tooth and nail to never show us his taxes that he promised in 2015!

1321178787405586440 2020-10-28 03:55:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoeBiden Urgent-you and the FBI need to put a stop to this treason RIGHT NOW! Trump is saying you’ll be assassinated 2 weeks in!  https://t.co/qHzJDsGUym
1321177244744749056 2020-10-28 03:49:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You actually expect the truth from this administration?
1321176899155042304 2020-10-28 03:48:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> These are the facts! Trump can’t cover these up! Why would you ever vote for this man?
1321176590198415365 2020-10-28 03:47:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not to mention, he’s a lying hypocrite! Vote him out!
1321175991293779971 2020-10-28 03:44:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> His image and re-election matter yo Jim kore than saving human lives! Please consider that when you vote! Outrageous and shameful!
1321168603379605512 2020-10-28 03:15:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Littlebugdog1 Certainly appears that way! She looks weak, like she can't wait to sit down!
1321168461331128322 2020-10-28 03:14:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course it is!
1321168394238963712 2020-10-28 03:14:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is the best news! We all fought hard for you, even in other states. Hope more can pitch in-even $5.00!
1321168107994533888 2020-10-28 03:13:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She looks extremely nauseous. It's almost making me sick!
1321166825875513353 2020-10-28 03:08:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't judge me, I am jealous!!
1321166616323858434 2020-10-28 03:07:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He encourages these thugs. He is a President that is supposed to serve all of us, and make sure no harm comes to any of us. He's never cared about COVID and now all these people getting death threats on his behalf. He's a monster. This is lunacy! I can't take it anymore.
1321166311939022851 2020-10-28 03:06:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now she needs security because his credent followers are sending her death threats. Is this America? Did someone move me without telling me? Fauci, Whitmer, Northam, and even Biden getting death threats...
1321165777903366146 2020-10-28 03:04:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trampy is a fraud no matter how you look at it!
1321165671108169729 2020-10-28 03:03:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now she's getting death threats! You freaks out there, this is America. You have to grow up. If your wimpy President can't handle a women journalist asking practical questions, &amp; that makes you think she doesn't deserve her life, then you are more cowardly &amp; pathetic than he is!
1321165184828903426 2020-10-28 03:01:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What? This is America. You freaks are insane. You should be ashamed of yourself. Vote this MFR out now! Will we all need 24 hour security? Look how many people he's caused harm to! Like bodily harm and death! He's got to stop. You have to vote!
1321164879160610818 2020-10-28 03:00:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I would kinda think taking a missle to clean your teeth would be a little overkill...
1321164672725385220 2020-10-28 02:59:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why are we surprised? True leaders don't take credit for things, let alone for things they failed horrifically at! This is insane!
1321153565763751941 2020-10-28 02:15:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's note true. Trump couldn't even define the word!
1321153068122185739 2020-10-28 02:13:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JasonMillerinDC How pathetic you are. That was a true Presidential speech! It was full of words like unite, come together, one nation. How is that dark and divisive?
1321152657525035008 2020-10-28 02:11:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong about everything as usual. Don't listen to him. He doesn't know anything.
1321152488427442176 2020-10-28 02:11:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too! What a difference in the two. The protocols being followed, and encouraged. The leadership, the unity. We are one nation. We are not red or blue, black or white, man or woman, we are Americans first! We are always supposed to help each other, not tear each other apart!
1321149473951830028 2020-10-28 01:59:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I will remember that for the rest of my life. I will never vote Republican again!
1321149370667065345 2020-10-28 01:58:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is pathetic! Prove one fact wrong Trumpers? Defend one of these numbers Trumpers!
1321148636617711619 2020-10-28 01:55:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpLostOurJobs just like he lost over 225,000 lives and took 15 cases all the way down to 8.7 Million. Trump is a lazy loser with no plan!
1321134537393528833 2020-10-28 00:59:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Bye bye: Cory Gardner (CO) Martha McSally (AZ) Susan Collins (ME) Thom Tillis (NC) Lindsey Graham (SC) Steve Daines (MO) John Cornyn (TX) Mitch McConnell (KY) Donald Trump   Hello to our amazing new Democrats taking their place!
1321134338386386952 2020-10-28 00:59:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1321133169853321217 2020-10-28 00:54:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Joe is IN THE LEAD FOLKS!!!
1321133070699868162 2020-10-28 00:54:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Another corrupt Republican! It's almost boring at this point.
1321132670399766528 2020-10-28 00:52:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's not some mysterious ridiculous hunter laptop theory. This is fact. Trump said this was all done before he was elected-so he admits it but lies about the timing!
1321132411955150849 2020-10-28 00:51:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kylegriffin1 Just imagine! The arrogance of this man has led us into being laughed at and pitied around the world.
1321131968793370624 2020-10-28 00:49:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Free America from this vicious tyrant!
1321131845107490818 2020-10-28 00:49:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TheRickWilson @ProjectLincoln Just no words to describe my appreciation for all that you have done and are doing!
1321131672570601476 2020-10-28 00:48:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He is no Commander in Chief. I can't begin to imagine how sickening it must be to serve under him.
1321131394098221056 2020-10-28 00:47:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He most certainly does!
1321131332244770821 2020-10-28 00:47:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you STILL undecided?
1321131199239278593 2020-10-28 00:46:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you LeBron!
1321131141693321216 2020-10-28 00:46:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We will not rest! We will not surrender! We will not lose hope that our country can become what it once was!
1321130975116623872 2020-10-28 00:45:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are Trumps taxes he promised in 2015? Who does Trump owe 1.1 BILLION DOLLARS to?
1321130597302063105 2020-10-28 00:44:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'll never vote a Republican again. I'll never trust them after this. Not for a minute!
1321130049836404738 2020-10-28 00:42:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes that's true! I am not complaining, but this is so important. If Trump wins, we may never vote again in our lifetimes. He will just do away with the election.
1321129852158824448 2020-10-28 00:41:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or one that has over 20 sexual assault allegations, including a rape complaint filed from a 13 year old? Or one that barges into the Miss Teen dressing room? Or one that is so nasty to women all the time? I'll need more time to think...maybe I am undecided? Not enough to go on!
1321127334968254465 2020-10-28 00:31:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Way to go, at least they got their judge. Now they sit back with all their money and laugh while America suffers! Remember that when you vote!
1321127127819964416 2020-10-28 00:30:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpFellShort
1321127064716611584 2020-10-28 00:30:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vacate you little whiny scared of a female reporter cowardly loser!
1321126954964320256 2020-10-28 00:29:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awesome guys! So grateful for all you have done and shared with us!
1321126718908866562 2020-10-28 00:28:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> One week!
1321126685014695937 2020-10-28 00:28:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wish granted!!!
1321126546082586624 2020-10-28 00:28:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ddale8 Kisses!!!
1321126481033125888 2020-10-28 00:27:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes they should!
1321126436485423104 2020-10-28 00:27:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DearAuntCrabby That would be a riot!
1321126286996180993 2020-10-28 00:27:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I wish he had started about 2-3 weeks earlier though. A lot of people had already mailed in ballots...
1321125943516319751 2020-10-28 00:25:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump has no plan! Never did, never will! He's too lazy and incompetent!
1321125845277331461 2020-10-28 00:25:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just compare how one rants nonsense, and the other facts!
1321125601118461954 2020-10-28 00:24:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> New Yorkers, if you experience voter intimidation or misinformation-reach out!!!
1321125366807863296 2020-10-28 00:23:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @NewYorkStateAG You are just more than we could hope for. How you manage to be just about the only one who dares to stand up to him...it's sad.
1321125163543470084 2020-10-28 00:22:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It won't just disappear one day? I thought fairy dust was all we needed to hear from a President. He made that up. He said it would go from 15 cases all the way down to zero. He did such an unfathomably horrific job-15 went all the way down to 8.7 Million! Masks, social distance.
1321124618271395844 2020-10-28 00:20:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick So, COVID is not a virus that spreads? Any Walmart I know of requires masks...and social distancing. These are normal common sense guidelines. Trump isn't having any of it. Why? Why will it go down on Nov 4th? Does he mean around the entire world? He's the bat shit crazy one!
1321124130805174272 2020-10-28 00:18:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's got this! I am so proud, even though I am in NC to see these amazing races! Jaime for SC!
1321123722137358338 2020-10-28 00:16:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You can just see the lies on her face now. She thinks Trump cares one way or another about her? He doesn't respect women! Her career is over! I have no pity for her. She's lied to us so many times-he did pick the perfect liar for the job!
1321123285640294400 2020-10-28 00:15:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hot Zone!
1321123189636927488 2020-10-28 00:14:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine a world if you will, where politics doesn't revolve around a maniac's tweets!
1321123055545044994 2020-10-28 00:14:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How is it not premeditated when he is deliberately holding these super spreaders?
1321122863034867713 2020-10-28 00:13:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpAbandonmentSyndrome
1321122768147066882 2020-10-28 00:13:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay!!! This nightmare is almost over. Imagine when we can focus all our efforts on COVID and caring for one another, not fighting this foolish petulant child and his madness!
1321122308740780042 2020-10-28 00:11:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote!
1321122142172418048 2020-10-28 00:10:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JDHatcher2 @acnewsitics I am in NC, but I did donate!
1321122020323659776 2020-10-28 00:10:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This never should have happened. If you vote only one issue, vote for lives!
1321121580848656387 2020-10-28 00:08:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 130 false or inaccurate statements in 90 minutes. This is the norm for him. It's not the norm for America! Don't let your children learn that this is right! Vote for Biden!
1321121120284758018 2020-10-28 00:06:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @adamcbest @Rob995957 They thought her confirmation was more important than the needs of the American citizens who are suffering. Think about that when you go to vote!
1321120904370376709 2020-10-28 00:05:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NC &amp; TEXAS are for Joe!  https://t.co/s1AYMaDw0l
1321120363296759808 2020-10-28 00:03:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joelockhart @realDonaldTrump Thanks! I did need that!
1321120064473600000 2020-10-28 00:02:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So they won't be counted.
1321119880394002440 2020-10-28 00:01:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you'll notice the masks, being worn outdoors...these are not Trumpers! There is nothing that says masks HAVE to be worn outdoors! Trump is losing NC by a landslide!
1321118059663368192 2020-10-27 23:54:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who does Trump owe 1.1 Billion to?
1321117760915709953 2020-10-27 23:53:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Someone completely devoid of morals.
1320917386648838147 2020-10-27 10:37:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks #maxnewstoday!

1320915869480947713 2020-10-27 10:30:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you really believe That foolish statement-they guess you aren’t getting much of the black female voters-are you?
1320915420564643840 2020-10-27 10:29:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Roe v Wade was fought for &amp;  won almost 50 years ago-and you think almost 50 years later women want less control over their own bodies? Shows you how out of touch these privileged white conservatives are! We always move forward not backward! Whats next-slavery back on the table?
1320913887240298496 2020-10-27 10:23:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG Horrendous criminal even
1320908860299878401 2020-10-27 10:03:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Yoyo01387585 @B52Malmet Hopefully gone fo good
1320908743962480645 2020-10-27 10:02:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> -Jaime you are one of the brightest hopes for our future! Don’t let up for a second!
1320908277853659141 2020-10-27 10:00:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is he wearing black face-just to show his base he’s extra racist? That’s like DEEP BROWN-when he used to be like half white, half orange!
1320907603476623360 2020-10-27 09:58:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @waltshaub Me too! I’ve tweeted some pretty angry shit tonight and I hate that it’s come to this!
1320907434609790977 2020-10-27 09:57:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trickle down effect always protects the hard working citizens
1320906953640583168 2020-10-27 09:55:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And that she basically couldn‘t comment on anything
1320906429415436289 2020-10-27 09:53:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As long as I’m alive, I’ll NEVER vote Republican again!

1320905928452046851 2020-10-27 09:51:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @WhKilroy @delriz4 I was always so proud of him-even though he could barely talk about it. He’s full of shrapnel and has a Purple Heart, but lost so many brothers that are on that wall. He can’t forgive himself
1320905465384050689 2020-10-27 09:49:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Too late-hope this keeps you company -because you LOST
1320905279467409409 2020-10-27 09:48:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay muddy pig face-
1320905076211392518 2020-10-27 09:48:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And allows this to take precedent over a COVID relief package? Someone foolish enough not to see her career will be fought every step of the way!
1320904527919415297 2020-10-27 09:45:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LocolopezNYC @DevinCow @calm Me too!
1320904415671422977 2020-10-27 09:45:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh what will the desperately I kiss Trumps ass even though he doesnt know I exist Barbie say to this?
1320903585840943104 2020-10-27 09:42:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @keith3048 I’ve never ever hated! I’m disappointed in Trump supporters but I still can’t hate them. However I do hate a Trump-this GOP who couldn‘t stand up to him, and this SCOTUS nomination and celebration while we are suffering and dying! I’m pissed! This is NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR
1320898105395548160 2020-10-27 09:20:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's so transparent-like any foolish thing he does. It disgusts me!
1320897829481697281 2020-10-27 09:19:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Willysgurl1 No!!!
1320897283689512964 2020-10-27 09:17:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Looks like a pig rolling around in mud!
1320896997516259329 2020-10-27 09:15:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such a worthless foolish no answer on anything fool!
1320896760647196673 2020-10-27 09:15:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We will, look at the early voting turn out. We are wise, we knew years ago what needed to be done. Hang in there. It's tough, it's exhausting, but in the past, we've had to fight harder for less. So, we can do this now!
1320896493063208961 2020-10-27 09:13:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I did and I will not stop shouting to the rooftops for others to do the same. I convinced the MOST diehard Republican.
1320896350142238721 2020-10-27 09:13:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @saniegh @LyleRugby I am so sorry. Hang in there, I know it's just words, but hopefully we will have a new administration that would rather help than profit from our death and misery in the stock market!
1320895685391224832 2020-10-27 09:10:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh just like Trump begging women to like him? They are manly men, just like their coward too scared to wear a mask supporters! Jeez, didn't we raise any adults in this country?
1320895115343310848 2020-10-27 09:08:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Quack Quack! Funny, that old saying, if it walks like a crooked duck, quacks like a crooked duck, it's a duck...no one seems to remember that now!
1320894871872430082 2020-10-27 09:07:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plastic is as plastic does! Did Jared just drop some plastic skin and these beings popped up?
1320894328345137154 2020-10-27 09:05:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Trump_Detester My best friend moved to Toronto in 7th grade. I visited her about 4 years ago. CN tower for dinner-even though the last week in March it snowed-not nice to this Carolina girl, but always loved Canada and Maple Leaf Candy! Never thought we'd be so different now. Only Trump!
1320893854590083072 2020-10-27 09:03:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sorry, not sorry! I've worn a mask and not hugged a friend since March 11th! Now the mask since March 5, and only one friend since like the first week in March. I cherish the hug, even though she thinks Trump was sent by God to save us all...
1320893504382472193 2020-10-27 09:02:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just sit back and watch honey! Reap what you sow! If Roe V Wade had such support so many years ago-you fools think that now over 70% of American's supporting it makes you look GOOD?
1320892947475406848 2020-10-27 08:59:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kenolin1 @SalzenBart @BarackObama If you have $2 SecureActBlue will take it! Vote these irresponsible arrogant fools out! They are public servants who only work for themselves. Focusing on SCOTUS and not a bill to help millions of Americans? What? Hope they are all arrested!
1320892633108123649 2020-10-27 08:58:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MarshaBlackburn STFU YOU IGNORANT PIG!
1320892531639492610 2020-10-27 08:58:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How is it not in the red, like all his other ventures? That's the real question? Is this fake news too?
1320892405617430528 2020-10-27 08:57:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @robertjdenault I already voted, and even though I am in NC, and apparently have the idiot Presidents consent to vote twice, as much as it pains me, I am smart enough to know that's illegal. So my one vote blue down the ballot has to be enough!
1320892080059723782 2020-10-27 08:56:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote, that's our only power against this downright tyranny. I am getting hateful tonight. I am the most easy going, sweet charitable person, but we can't allow this. It's not American!
1320891863960817665 2020-10-27 08:55:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh Jaime, what a breath of fresh air. What a hardworking, gentle, happy soul. Even in NC, I can't wait to call him Senator Harrison! He's going places!
1320891341035999232 2020-10-27 08:53:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PalmerReport Oh I am pissed tonight! I hope she gets to decide a case when a 12 year old daughter is impregnated by rape by a filthy sweaty old pig who tears her genitals apart! Praise be God!
1320890767070711816 2020-10-27 08:51:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, but lets be adult enough to rub the AmyCoatHangerBarret confirmation into Hillary's Birthday celebration! Republican Swine!
1320890426077925376 2020-10-27 08:49:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BillyBaldwin Oh we will! AmyCoatHangerBarrett will never live this down! Hopefully she will have a case of a 12 yr old attacked and impregnated by a filthy sweaty fat old pig and let her decide that case.
1320890208846532608 2020-10-27 08:49:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, this is a new day. Record numbers of early turn out. We all knew to vote early, and we have won our Democracy back from this insane corrupt cheating lying filthy pig!
1320889903643844610 2020-10-27 08:47:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just 1.4 billion, but nah American's don't deserve a higher minimum wage than $7.25?
1320889748769148930 2020-10-27 08:47:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ann45327756 @TuckFrumpsters Yes, this is for real! A sitting governor is going to send the national guard to certain typically democratic voting polling sites. This is sick-this is not a democracy any more.
1320889464953163776 2020-10-27 08:46:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just send Lesley into the room, he will run like a chicken with it's head cut off!
1320889097720913921 2020-10-27 08:44:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I can't wait until some big sweaty filthy pervert impregnates one of their 12 year old daughters and abortion is illegal!
1320888804518039554 2020-10-27 08:43:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The GOP is bragging about confirming AmyCoathangerBarrett
1320888556198502402 2020-10-27 08:42:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They all will face justice! Imagine the Twitter accounts that will try to be deleted!
1320888405765619713 2020-10-27 08:41:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pathetic coward, just let him know Lesley said she's on the way! He will run with his tail between his legs as far away as his fat will carry him!
1320888168602865671 2020-10-27 08:40:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What, that she wouldn't release the list of names he forced to have abortions?
1320887990802124801 2020-10-27 08:40:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The fight and struggle women went through who were so brave when we were even less thought of during Roe vs. Wade. #AmyCoatHangerBarrett you are a shame on this entire nation.
1320887243045830656 2020-10-27 08:37:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Gender equality? Are you kidding me? This mongoloid treats women as 2nd class citizens he'd like to F%ck if we are 23 or under, including Miss Teen America, including his daughter, or anyone he feels he can just grab by the pussy! That's assault. Anyone w/a daughter disagree?
1320886480986902528 2020-10-27 08:34:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So I can start calling blacks n*ggers? Is that cool with the conserves now? I want to be down with them, no matter who it hurts!
1320886294784987136 2020-10-27 08:33:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Any President other than this freaking idiot would have numbers! He knows no numbers. Testing is up 16% which is still dreadful per capita, however, cases are up 57%! Any fool that believes 1 rambling spittle filled rage soundbite out of this cretant is the biggest fool ever born
1320883541526327297 2020-10-27 08:22:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> where is your ABORTED baby you fucking son of a bitch?
1320883312362196992 2020-10-27 08:21:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow-As impressed by the way she avoided all of the questions and showed us a blank notebook pad
1320883159504924673 2020-10-27 08:21:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes they wiill
1320882795321925632 2020-10-27 08:19:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s awesome! We are standing up to this lazy, corrupt power hungry administration and the GOP-SUNSHINE is on the way folks!
1320882462592016385 2020-10-27 08:18:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s okay-They are all about to hit the unemployment line and I hope they don’t get any relief
1320882381415395330 2020-10-27 08:17:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes it is!
1320882252214083587 2020-10-27 08:17:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KwikWarren @annmgillespie Sweet
1320882160056832001 2020-10-27 08:17:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> God can have them!
1320882058625994753 2020-10-27 08:16:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ✋
1320881467086569473 2020-10-27 08:14:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump praises himself for 8.7 million infected and over 226,000 lost Americans! Hope you Trumpers are happy you sick f@cks! I mean really-how sick are you to be happy about all this death and failure and suffering? What’s wring with you? So scared of a little mask-prove me wrong
1320880871038164993 2020-10-27 08:11:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, we won’t! When you are VP, don’t let us down!
1320880681136902146 2020-10-27 08:11:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Bye Felicia
1320880549184110592 2020-10-27 08:10:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick So why do surgeons performing open heart surgery wear a mask idiot
1320880376475197441 2020-10-27 08:09:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don’t worry the crazy Trumper’s won’t trust the long established American Medical Association either! Ignorant fools-right in front of their faces bit little coward Trump messiah who can’t take an interview from an itty bitty female journalist is who is man!
1320879579226120192 2020-10-27 08:06:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you Greg! What a simple sweet act of decency-Trumpers-You remember when you had decency and kindness too, right?
1320879161863475200 2020-10-27 08:05:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yeah right! We are doing what we told you we would do which is voting in numbers too large to ignore or corrupt.
1320878957030526977 2020-10-27 08:04:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Upper and I idolize a coward who’s afraid of a little tiny reporter
1320878839736766465 2020-10-27 08:03:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or anyone anywhere? I tell you what-Lesley didn’t look all that frightening to me! Did she to you Trumpers? This is the coward you idolize because he stands up to everyone? You fools
1320878024993157122 2020-10-27 08:00:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @delriz4 @WhKilroy I went to the wall with my dad, infantry Marine with severe PTSD. So medicated....saw so much horror. He moved to be near me, and hadn't registered to vote on time due to COVID. His voice won't be heard. He went to Nam without a thought as a teenager. No bone spurs.
1320877630246236169 2020-10-27 07:59:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @battletested5 Oh, Trump will really be hurt if I vote 3rd party. That will show him!
1320877411320369158 2020-10-27 07:58:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not only a charity shut down, STEALING FROM A CHILDRENS CANCER CHARITY AND using funds from a fundraiser for VETS for themselves! Yuck!
1320877195645124613 2020-10-27 07:57:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you believe any of this, then you are a sucker! I mean he's been promising his tax returns since 2015. He's been promising a better health care plan since 2015. Remember folks, how complicated any health care plan has been? You think this fool could deliver?
1320876855541538816 2020-10-27 07:55:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are these for sale?
1320876740328235011 2020-10-27 07:55:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We can't stress this enough. Why are they not seeing any of the million horrific lies and deeds this monster has done? I guess we really are at war with ourselves.
1320876259845513217 2020-10-27 07:53:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @LabyrinthWeaver Love you! You make this slightly bearable. Even though, I am grieving for our poor lost souls and it's quite unbearable.
1320875939291713536 2020-10-27 07:52:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's okay! Democrats have been waiting 4 years to vote. We voted early. They are so stupid yet again, just hurting themselves!
1320875707216658433 2020-10-27 07:51:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He won't get immunity, that's for sure! More deaths than any other war!
1320875416555606018 2020-10-27 07:50:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You think? Pushing this while they could have helped millions upon millions of suffering American's? God help us!
1320875273827614725 2020-10-27 07:49:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Do you have a case of #TrumpAbandonmentSyndrome? Operators are standing by just call 1-800 no one gives a Fu3K! You deserve what you get you hideous greedy monsters. Money over Country-we aren't having it!
1320863367905579008 2020-10-27 07:02:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @morethanmySLE I feel you! If I could vote again, I would. Even though I live in NC and Trump twice told me that I could...I will actually uphold the law!
1320863131221020675 2020-10-27 07:01:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What ever happened to those tax returns?
1320862953663565824 2020-10-27 07:00:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did he actually have it? Seriously, he lies about EVERYTHING!
1320862700650508291 2020-10-27 06:59:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RedTRaccoon @Infantry0300 When our ancestors came here, and founded this great nation, they cared more about each other than wealth! We are a shame.
1320862494236282882 2020-10-27 06:58:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Read it? He can't even spell it!
1320862402372685825 2020-10-27 06:58:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's why doctors wear masks, when they operate-right? Or am I wrong about that too?
1320861613667266566 2020-10-27 06:55:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You are so wrong. If you don't wear a mask, you can be asymptomatic and kill someone by not even knowing you are spreading the virus. It's a virus. Get real!
1320861183658872832 2020-10-27 06:53:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's sickening. It's injustice! It's illegal to intimidate voters. It's horrific that this is where we are thanks to the most stupid person on earth in charge.
1320860669453963267 2020-10-27 06:51:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We will never forgive or forget. They are our public servants. This is treason!
1320860549857632257 2020-10-27 06:51:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you can't see the poison this little coward is, then you need to get a grip! I almost hope he wins so you idiot Trumpers face the most dire future in the entire world!
1320860233711968258 2020-10-27 06:49:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumpers you also fear the AMA? Really?
1320860086265368581 2020-10-27 06:49:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I want a President who isn't batshit shaking in his boots terrified of a female reporter!
1320859817729294336 2020-10-27 06:48:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Like the nun with the wedding ring perhaps?
1320859582533672966 2020-10-27 06:47:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don't know, that's what the hire the little people for $7.25 an hour to do!
1320859359069556736 2020-10-27 06:46:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! Politicians are public servants, NOT CELEBRITIES! How many times has this idiot bragged about ratings or celebrated how low ratings would be for others if he wasn't involved? That has nothing at all to do with being the President of these great United States! Foolish!
1320857420919439360 2020-10-27 06:38:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> To a lot of folks, until Donie says so, no it's not patriotism. Therein lies the problem!
1320857090076876800 2020-10-27 06:37:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As just another citizen, the glimpses I get are appalling. I worry about our National Security over so many things that he's done, or failed to do...or the way he threatens a country in a tweet! Really? Does he use Crayolas as well?
1320855809358704640 2020-10-27 06:32:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Never stop suing them, please! After the election, I'll be donating to you!!! NEVER STOP! Show them what the rest of us know, that actions have consequences and you will be held accountable!
1320855341840609282 2020-10-27 06:30:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, the one true thing that came out of her vapid filthy mouth. At least the people are smart enough to know that and Joevember will be the biggest celebration in our history!
1320855134142787584 2020-10-27 06:29:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Your appalling lies and inaction and misrepresentation are getting you fired you pig!
1320854961006252032 2020-10-27 06:28:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Any American who is ignorant enough to believe that infections will dwindle around the globe on November 4th is the most dangerous fool in the world! Really!
1320854493576241152 2020-10-27 06:27:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ReallyAmerican1 @TeaPainUSA Done!
1320854406766776320 2020-10-27 06:26:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @duty2warn How much can we all chip in and have it run on all the major networks?
1320854276994945024 2020-10-27 06:26:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Real men don't have to beg women to love them. This man has a $12.00 bank account of decency. Don't you forget it!
1320854054801756160 2020-10-27 06:25:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not with that #TrumpStink-its the rotting flesh of over 225,000 bodies! Never!
1320853669701713927 2020-10-27 06:23:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow, guess Trump's mic is muted now!
1320853563476684800 2020-10-27 06:23:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And that vapid horse you rode in on!
1320853409080201218 2020-10-27 06:22:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just the idiots! Apparently we really need free higher education for all!
1320853260639576066 2020-10-27 06:22:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, okay two-faced, but I can't quite give him most corrupt. The most corrupt is the wasn't a politician, greedy businessman that some thought was a good idea.
1320853069232508928 2020-10-27 06:21:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We will never be a world leader again, this is what Trump has done. It will take so much time just to undo the damage, that we won't be the innovators and leaders. We will be stuck cleaning the mess of lost lives, lost businesses, lost economy.
1320852804643229698 2020-10-27 06:20:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Breaking: Trump opened his mouth, lies came out. Same old story, different day!
1320852469082148864 2020-10-27 06:19:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As a conservative, you can't understand the injustice people of color (and women and any minority) have endured. This year in particular, when enough was enough this president never said a word to calm a hurting nation, as any leader has done in the past.
1320852053456027654 2020-10-27 06:17:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> While they focused on that, and not our vulnerable, hurting citizens-we all did a funny thing! We voted with love in our hearts! They will hear the call!
1320851594708209664 2020-10-27 06:15:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Since he's quit, he ain't getting his job back! America come on, what does he have to do? Gut you like a deer? Stop, seriously. Stop. Vote Joe, and we can go back to a normal peaceful happy existence! Plus, Joe will help improve the social injustices so we all have equality!
1320848724655067143 2020-10-27 06:04:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @spartan55 @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Sorry! He and Pence won’t leave NC alone!
1320848614898454531 2020-10-27 06:03:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sorry Trump it’s your brain that’s not developed and never will!
1320848394538147842 2020-10-27 06:02:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wish him a financially devastating loss! Hope he gets sued when the truth comes out! Watch him try to live on $7.25 an hour!
1320848049590149120 2020-10-27 06:01:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s back when she still knew how to tell the truth!
1320847886238842883 2020-10-27 06:00:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump could-and this whey everyone needs to realize!
1320847725995397125 2020-10-27 06:00:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s been premeditated since he admitted what he knew to Woodward!
1320847481467555840 2020-10-27 05:59:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know it! It will be the biggest crash we’ve ever seen. No way out!
1320847357672673280 2020-10-27 05:58:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But it affects virtually nobody! Certainly not our exhausted health care workers and their support staff!
1320847068504694784 2020-10-27 05:57:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, so he’s finally telling the truth! Great-Bidens got this! #DonnieDoLittle can take his ball and go home!
1320846826036174848 2020-10-27 05:56:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> REAL MEN  don’t have to beg women to love them!
1320846655772598279 2020-10-27 05:55:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, as long as our dishwashers have enough water pressure-then less worrying over, that means more time to crochet toilet paper holders!
1320846104515272706 2020-10-27 05:53:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She‘s a brainwashed fruitcake who will say anything they want her to, but at least this time she wasn’t lying!
1320845671524671491 2020-10-27 05:52:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And yeah, if I had a nickel for every lie that came out of Trumps mouth!
1320845446500200453 2020-10-27 05:51:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Face of America, does Trump ever get anything right? He’s so stupid and such a liar nothing that comes out of his mouth means anything to anyone but himself!
1320844520754434048 2020-10-27 05:47:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You money to, but I bet you can guess who he will steal it from!
1320844419629748226 2020-10-27 05:47:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AmyMcGrathKY @KET @barron_ky You don‘t have enough tweets that give a link to donate to you!
1320844012123758593 2020-10-27 05:45:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you imagine the horrors he endured AND refused early release! This freaking shit face no brained win coward in the office has no right to even speak his name ever
1320843648171462656 2020-10-27 05:44:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hope they are sued for every last dime every last asset they earn and let’s see them actually do any type of hard work
1320843361469800448 2020-10-27 05:42:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Dementia much #DonnieDoLittle
1320843148122300418 2020-10-27 05:42:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well-how donnydolittle, how does he compare to Stormy Daniels?
1320842099739283461 2020-10-27 05:37:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am enraged! I am relatively lucky too. I can work from home, I own my business, so I am not likely to lay myself off. I do however, and always have cared about my fellow Americans and anyone suffering around the world. This is unforgivable! Shows their putrid rotting souls!
1320841646993530881 2020-10-27 05:36:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I just thought you were doing Trump!!
1320840688959950850 2020-10-27 05:32:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope they all are sued and lose every dime and asset they have. Maybe then we can tell them, oh it's not a big deal to earn it all back, as long as you aren't lazy!
1320840171848376321 2020-10-27 05:30:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, if they like him, value money over lives of others...I can't feel sorry for them anymore. I am too stunned over the American's we have lost already. My heart has no more room left for these fools!
1320839863197933576 2020-10-27 05:28:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Someone estimated 16 trillion! Think of 225,000 dead. How many were in the ICU? Think of hospitalized patients who survived....think of the folks who needed P/T afterwards. Worst cases probably a good million dollar price tag!
1320839505906143234 2020-10-27 05:27:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There is no such thing! You may have received a ballot application if you were a registered voter. Simple!
1320839147867770880 2020-10-27 05:26:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shame that silence is certainly deafening, isn't it folks?
1320839021896093697 2020-10-27 05:25:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Truly!
1320838605754015755 2020-10-27 05:23:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> America-this is the best advice you'll ever get!
1320838083688964108 2020-10-27 05:21:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't even want to know..."slock rocket" with this administration...yikes!
1320837945931276293 2020-10-27 05:21:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JodySunnyBeach They have no respect for anything...very sad.
1320836984038936580 2020-10-27 05:17:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Catnixidy @TuckFrumpsters Can you even believe this? I think the good news is that most democrats are voting early. I pray for their safety.
1320836677024305154 2020-10-27 05:16:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The entire world laughs at this buffoon-Trump incase you need a definition: a ridiculous but amusing person; a clown!
1320836303047610368 2020-10-27 05:14:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Please drive the hell on out of here! Never come back!
1320836077494718471 2020-10-27 05:13:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Every last one of them will be voted out now, or in 2022!
1320835971005456385 2020-10-27 05:13:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is he in on the plot too Trumpers? POPE Francis is telling CATHOLICS: DO NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP...he is NOT a Christian. What more do you need?
1320835370456678400 2020-10-27 05:11:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I sure hope the media covers this! Abbott releasing National Guard! Express-News reports Democratic “strongholds” will be receiving the Guard units, including San Antonio, Austin, Houston, Dallas, and Fort Worth. Is this the Alamo? This is authoritarian voter intimidation.
1320834736193970176 2020-10-27 05:08:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I can understand what they are feeling. Hopefully Biden will show them what he will accomplish with hard work, compassion, and diplomacy. As long as it's a Biden vote!!!
1320834490625830912 2020-10-27 05:07:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yep, D all the way!!!
1320834293996916736 2020-10-27 05:06:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BadBradRSR Journey! So bummed I've seen them every year for years and had tickets earlier this year, but no show!
1320834124605739009 2020-10-27 05:06:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Obama: You ain't all that tough! Trump you are a downright cowardly wimp! You bully our allies, but cuddle right up to our adversaries. You cherish money over service and will lie about anything to get what you want-which is simply more money. You are pathetic!
1320833799073239040 2020-10-27 05:04:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BadBradRSR Lita Ford
1320833018290864128 2020-10-27 05:01:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not as much as they should! They should all be like Lesley Stahl!
1320824267496394755 2020-10-27 04:26:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If some actually does find out what the hell is the matter with Trump, let me know. I have a freaking mile long list, but if we can narrow it down-great! Or maybe we should be asking what the hell is NOT wrong with Trump? Sources tell me he may not be human.
1320823981570707456 2020-10-27 04:25:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh I disagree, we are rounding the corner!
1320823911664279555 2020-10-27 04:25:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Killed what? Did he commit murder and I missed it after he ran away crying like a little boy who dropped his lolipop?
1320823637197336576 2020-10-27 04:24:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Some hospitals may right now be steeling themselves for making choices between life and death. If our numbers continue, more and more will have to decide who lives and who dies.
1320823388206751751 2020-10-27 04:23:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Unless Joe was doing it, which he's too humane to do...
1320823173663870979 2020-10-27 04:22:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Go Jill! Just another stark contrast between the two choices here folks! One is light and hope. The other, I don't care, do you?
1320822898597240832 2020-10-27 04:21:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shouldn't he be more worried about running his Task Farce? Oh that's right, nothing to do there....
1320822564135096322 2020-10-27 04:20:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where are Meliania's numbers 1-3?
1320822390545391616 2020-10-27 04:19:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Biden will steal your guns, your goats, your garages, your garbage, your garlic, your girdles, your gravy, your gyro's, your guitars, your grease, your grits, your gravity, your grandmother, your grain, your gloves, your glaucoma, your gaskets, your gates, your germs, your glue!
1320821045977382912 2020-10-27 04:14:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He left off rallies! He said he wasn't doing Super Spreaders-ha because we need to be responsible. What is this notion that anything goes when its a worldwide public health crisis?
1320820827659636736 2020-10-27 04:13:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> America is not some random TV Reality show! America, you better get a grip, pull up your pants and handle your business! This man needs to go.
1320796432392179713 2020-10-27 02:36:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Breakin the law breakin the law....
1320796320081367045 2020-10-27 02:35:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Treason! He has to be removed from office immediately. He is not allowed to do this crap!
1320796170323722241 2020-10-27 02:35:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> WTF? Shut Up Man!
1320795925003018246 2020-10-27 02:34:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay, that's making some sense now!
1320793512426819585 2020-10-27 02:24:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #LetsWinThis before he kills us all!
1320761680113094656 2020-10-27 00:18:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Most Americans do as well. Other than our vote, which may not even count, we are powerless. You've seen the months of protests, the outrage. We are getting stomped into the ground here!
1320761394522923011 2020-10-27 00:17:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They may win the battle, but they will lose the war. America will be so discouraged that we may NEVER vote a Republican for anything again!
1320761205158535169 2020-10-27 00:16:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow-look at that! I'd hope OHIO will do the same. Trumps the only candidate who asked America to boycott Goodyear!
1320760821530697728 2020-10-27 00:14:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You aren't fit to lick his shoes. You are a horrific corrupt lying cheat! You are so full of disgust and hate. You are a clown. Joe means business! Joe will pull us out of this mess you made!
1320760516340568065 2020-10-27 00:13:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Black people just don't want to be successful.
1320759975032070146 2020-10-27 00:11:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like President's who dont' tell voters in NC to vote twice, once by mail and once in person.
1320759784656818176 2020-10-27 00:10:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As long as the prosecutors don't forget his name!
1320759098657460229 2020-10-27 00:08:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He never has!
1320759045062610944 2020-10-27 00:07:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That #TrumpStink is in the air!
1320758972937359360 2020-10-27 00:07:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's such a worthless human being. This man needs to not only not be re-elected, but removed on Nov 4th. Impeachment!
1320758571592785921 2020-10-27 00:05:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is not reality folks! This is America. Stand up and fight for it!
1320758087645540353 2020-10-27 00:04:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes! Same in NC. He's got NC hands down!
1320757962646999042 2020-10-27 00:03:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @truthjusticehph @matthewjdowd Thank you!!! You could be the very reason we go back to life as it was BT!
1320757828634759168 2020-10-27 00:02:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think about that difference! Voter suppression will backfire! American's will put up with way more than I ever thought possible, but not that!
1320757608660279300 2020-10-27 00:02:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG what shade is that he has on? Is that deck stain sprayed on? Ask Sherwin Williams!
1320757023773020161 2020-10-26 23:59:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> N-word! Not so long ago.
1320755405212045312 2020-10-26 23:53:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are lazy and the only thing we get out of this job is the money we make from our position!
1320755270310629383 2020-10-26 23:52:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's showed such compassion for the needless deaths by police this year too! LAW &amp; ORDER
1320755087627702279 2020-10-26 23:52:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know it is! I used to live in WNY. We'd go to the Falls &amp; Toronto a lot! Back then, the US side of the Falls was a completely different picture than the Canadian side! As for what is going on here now...I never thought in my wildest dreams. I voted, keeping my fingers crossed!
1320750680198565888 2020-10-26 23:34:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think it’s worse! I think that they enjoy finding ways to profit from this devastating situation! It’s just a game to them!
1320749921616699398 2020-10-26 23:31:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Be careful!
1320749512600637440 2020-10-26 23:29:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So much love in that picture! You must be an amazing mom! Sorry for your loss!
1320749226863808514 2020-10-26 23:28:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amazing!
1320749013126291456 2020-10-26 23:27:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He needs to face up to ,ousting criminal charges behind impeachment!
1320748866371801099 2020-10-26 23:27:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What an idiot statement!
1320748738281955328 2020-10-26 23:26:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sweet! Did you tell him he had that vulgar #TrumpStink
1320748528361263104 2020-10-26 23:26:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay Jaime!
1320748285737553922 2020-10-26 23:25:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Biden landslide! No one wants this racist fool anymore! Go young America!

I am hoping most Americans will do the right thing during this election-that is-if our votes count. Very scary time for us. He’s done things we never thought possible. Now a;l these kidnapping plots-think we are up to 3 Governor’s! Really

They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.”
1320726296306065411 2020-10-26 21:57:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At least he's matured some-Lesley Stahl got attacked but wasn't quite as disgusting! “She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions,” Trump said. “You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”
1320726090151829504 2020-10-26 21:56:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Losers and Suckers: "He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

1320725558960001024 2020-10-26 21:54:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pennyhenny3 Me too. Hang in there! It's sad that we have to fight so hard! COVID alone would be enough to deal with. A competent leader, with effective practices and managing those practices would mean our stress would go down about 80%. No Trump stress, knowing someone cares....
1320724353084985345 2020-10-26 21:49:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He doesn't understand much about success, does he? If the Republicans had the guts to stand up to him, and defend our nation, I might not have voted blue down the ticket. Now, I'll NEVER take the chance on a Republican again!

1320721634437828609 2020-10-26 21:39:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes he will-by an unbelievable margin. When that happens, we will heal, unite, plan, and actually stamp out this virus! We will respect our health care and front line workers.
1320719609138454533 2020-10-26 21:31:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Trump_Detester But....I asked so very nicely!

1320718784584441856 2020-10-26 21:27:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At what point does this insanity get any freaking backlash? Where is the media? They should be skating in anger at this reckless and carelessness!
1320718511703052289 2020-10-26 21:26:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really you can actually shut that shit out of your mouth when we are up to 8.6 million cases you freaking idiot? Pence doesn’t have a clue you don’t have a clue Trump doesn’t have a clue you only want to make money and profit from our suffering
1320718352646606849 2020-10-26 21:26:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’ve heard that testing has gone up 16%, but the case rate has gone up 57% you would think we could elect a president who might have some numbers other than just dumb ass bullshit roll out of his mouth day after day after day!
1320717939864207361 2020-10-26 21:24:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Rise Garden Masacre-The Sequel!

1320717638511796225 2020-10-26 21:23:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s not forget he’s accused those hero’s of stealing PPE, and actually profiting from COVID! Projection-remember what he accuses other of.....
1320717292490149891 2020-10-26 21:21:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plus, he will finally see how much we despise him for being the biggest liar, cheater, and traitor our great nation has ever seen! No pardons, no deals!
1320716869620371458 2020-10-26 21:20:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s also Fighting to stay out of jail for his many crimes. Wait until the real evidence comes out and we see how much profiting he’s made off of our death and suffering!
1320716709502849026 2020-10-26 21:19:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need you a Joe-our President is killing us!
1320716591055675392 2020-10-26 21:19:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How can these people live with themselves? Knowing they might infect somebody who could  die?  They think that they are brave,  but  they are the biggest cowards our nation has ever seen! We are fighting a battle &amp;  they  are too lazy and stupid to fight with us!
1320716013881692160 2020-10-26 21:16:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Something that Trumpy would never understand!
1320572255462674433 2020-10-26 11:45:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We listened and I’m proud that we are voting in numbers too large to be corrupted!
1320571966760407041 2020-10-26 11:44:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SethAbramson If only there weren’t just a few extremely tiny steps to follow....they are that stupid.
1320570992519974913 2020-10-26 11:40:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So does that mean when he said I just grab em by the pussy, he grabs himself?
1320569963476865026 2020-10-26 11:36:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I #BlameTrump

1320569542289068033 2020-10-26 11:34:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember America-at a time when most wait in line  &amp;  wait days for test results-Mark Meadows says he’s tested every day! This administration is as irresponsible as it gets-&amp; they even steal our tests right out from underneath us! If they weren’t so ridiculously reckless....
1320564107414851584 2020-10-26 11:13:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote now-if you don’t NONE of us will ever have the chance again!
1320563927307243520 2020-10-26 11:12:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like Presidents who aren’t scared of women!
1320563795945771009 2020-10-26 11:11:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Laziest Person on earth!
1320563347197145088 2020-10-26 11:10:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Only if he left the country and never practiced law again! Even though that’s not enough...I could learn as Trump says, to live with it.
1320562531673509888 2020-10-26 11:06:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Lo2982 @anwilli @IamChartoo @davidmweissman Also, a lot of Republicans voted for him in 2016, as an experimental chance. Maybe someone who,knew absolutely nothing about politics could effect change. They now have had 4 years to see his true nature. They are sick of it and want nothing more to do with him!
1320560769440821248 2020-10-26 10:59:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @anwilli @IamChartoo @Lo2982 @davidmweissman Well I’m in eastern NC too! Full of Republicans and other than the jacked up pick-up,trucks with the Trump flags flying, he had the others until he messed with the post office. All that’s left in my neck of the woods are the disenfranchised poorer, uneducated ones. So happy

1320559842633916416 2020-10-26 10:56:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But David-most of these are sensible hard working law abiding folks. How are they blind to All the horrific things he’s done? He’s reckless, rude, obnoxious, deceitful, corrupt, incites violence, and is beyond lazy and arrogant!
1320558995707449345 2020-10-26 10:52:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @IamChartoo @Lo2982 @davidmweissman Yep-but NC has seen the light! Everyone I talk to has had enough! We are going to hand the win to President Biden!

1320556687183458309 2020-10-26 10:43:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The only thing that will matter to me is him facing criminal charges!

1320552885038522368 2020-10-26 10:28:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He can’t comprehend anyone not taking advantage of a horrific situation without finding a way to profit from it-outrageous
1320551594694451202 2020-10-26 10:23:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why? Americans need to hear this!

1320549925994856449 2020-10-26 10:16:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shouldn’t a President be able to handle his business?
1320549762215661574 2020-10-26 10:16:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such cowards

1320548810595119106 2020-10-26 10:12:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I can‘t tell you how many times I’ve asked that question.
1320548494604730371 2020-10-26 10:11:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How much do they profit from our death?
1320548303726125061 2020-10-26 10:10:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez-guess your visit to the polls was taken with a grain of salt!

1320547265132613632 2020-10-26 10:06:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Does he steal PPE though? Trump told us that lie a few months ago. Who would ever believe he could be so pathetic? I mean, I always knew he was a terrible human being-but this is truly appalling behavior!
1320546348438048775 2020-10-26 10:02:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The leader of the free world is nothing but a cry baby! He really has an oddball fear of women! Jeez-how can we expect such a pathetic mewling coward to lead our country, and our military?  https://t.co/TLCQMacOw1
1320545594063134720 2020-10-26 09:59:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What kind of President is such a crybaby that he can’t answer tough questions?
1320545267293265921 2020-10-26 09:58:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He must be profiting so much from this! Money is all that matters to him, unless he such a sociopath that he’s enjoying it!
1320543025202974721 2020-10-26 09:49:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @cstaceybr @DeanObeidallah How would we ever begin to pay for that? We will barely be able to,pay for the staggering medical bills that are already here thanks to their appalling lack of action!

1320540513230082048 2020-10-26 09:39:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is he so demented he thinks he’s on the Apprentice again?
1320540331335733250 2020-10-26 09:38:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> One has a heart and a soul, the other? He’s done a great job making Trump happy!

1320539167961550854 2020-10-26 09:34:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s more lazy and incompetent then I gave him credit for! Nasty little man.

1320535627683737600 2020-10-26 09:20:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don’t remember him bringing that up earlier today-let’s see...what was he saying? Oh yes, you are all going to die because we a lazy greedy pigs and we will work less, and profit more off your death and tragedy! How nice!
1320534825749676032 2020-10-26 09:16:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Forward thinkers dint make knee jerk reactions that destroy and kill our people in the name of profit! Can’t wait until yiu are voted out!

1320531895512346625 2020-10-26 09:05:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Chicken in Chief!
1320531497024180225 2020-10-26 09:03:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It also means you are a pathetic coward! It's not fun, COVID sucks &amp; we are all tired of it. You know what? I haven't hugged a friend since March 11, 2020! I wear a mask every time I go out. I am lonely, exhausted, but this is nothing compared to the thought that I killed another
1320530969577857026 2020-10-26 09:01:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So if she (Noonan) and Trump were in a room together...do you see where this is going?
1320530670440091649 2020-10-26 09:00:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It used to be manslaughter. Now it's premeditated murder or murder for profit!
1320530463061147648 2020-10-26 08:59:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He said just go get the papers. Like, that's all we had to do? Americans be so lazy, we can't just go get the papers to find the truth?
1320530070977581058 2020-10-26 08:57:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need you Joe! This is horrific!
1320529249682526210 2020-10-26 08:54:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They shouldn't bother, that putrid #TrumpStink (think 235,000 rotting corpses) will flow through their veins through all eternity!
1320528668528173056 2020-10-26 08:52:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's actually PROUD of the size of rallys you've never seen before, packed in during COVID! His ego being stroked is much more important to him than your own life! Do I need to repeat myself here? What lunatic does this? Madman! CRIMINAL!
1320528153920573441 2020-10-26 08:50:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MeidasTouch @espinaDuran Do you have a link to donate for ads for NC? Time is running out!
1320527626155544577 2020-10-26 08:48:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I guess after attacking Kamala for having fun, is Jaime next for Noonan?
1320526758970593280 2020-10-26 08:44:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ever!
1320526578762342400 2020-10-26 08:44:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's it? America is super in need of some lightheartedness in this torrential Trump downpour. I always see her smile. Sad that even being happy is against the norm these days!
1320526125697740800 2020-10-26 08:42:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Rockstar!!!!!
1320526054533013504 2020-10-26 08:42:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
1320518408673394688 2020-10-26 08:11:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's amazing!!!!
1320518021195177986 2020-10-26 08:10:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AJuttaHBrink1 @howeasyweforget Or paper towels?
1320517979705147392 2020-10-26 08:09:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AJuttaHBrink1 @howeasyweforget I am not as nice, a fish hook perhaps?
1320515823635750912 2020-10-26 08:01:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Freaking idiot is right! He's so pleased with himself to be adulated he doesn't even get that squeezing more of them into together to die is actually not a beautiful thing! MADMAN!!! Run for your lives~!
1320515541224837120 2020-10-26 08:00:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We didn't either! Even for $500,000 I would never turn on my country, especially voters who have been treated with disdain and the terrible injustices they've suffered. Just that you supported him for more than 1/2 a second is pathetic!
1320513489673293824 2020-10-26 07:52:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A little over an hour. I'd have waited weeks. No biggie! It's my civic duty-right?
1320453011236397057 2020-10-26 03:51:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> His strategy is, if we ll die, two things happen: 1.-He has more money than any of us because we are DEAD 2.-If we are all dead-we cant send him to prison for the rest of his life! That’s The Art of The Deal folks!
1320452397915885570 2020-10-26 03:49:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They weren‘t stealing PPE either like he claimed a few months ago!
1320452041106481155 2020-10-26 03:47:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Listen already!
1320451760473997320 2020-10-26 03:46:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> number one reason-he’s not getting real-elected!
1320451583445000193 2020-10-26 03:46:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s sick in the head! He’s a death profiteer
1320451151167442944 2020-10-26 03:44:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s what scientists refer to as the #TrumpStink
1320450886037053442 2020-10-26 03:43:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Buy 1 get 12 free-PRICELESS
1320450546885709830 2020-10-26 03:41:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is this really a true statement? He’s encouraging the silent racists?
1320450184665616390 2020-10-26 03:40:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump death toll
1320450023327440898 2020-10-26 03:39:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> End Trumpism
1320449273062924290 2020-10-26 03:36:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank goodenss for his good crowds-carry on then!
1320449086047342604 2020-10-26 03:36:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Where were you when the cowards just gave up and ran away?
1320448854832173056 2020-10-26 03:35:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Work hard folks- you know master likes to be number one! #TrumpSurrendered
1320448527726743552 2020-10-26 03:33:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think that might affect our national security just a bit? We have just become the prey America!
1320447777890062341 2020-10-26 03:30:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, just 225,000 wounded Americans left behind by this cowardly lazy administration
1320447551871569921 2020-10-26 03:30:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Their only constitution is green on white paper
1320447260220706816 2020-10-26 03:28:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why save lives when there’s money to be made? I just say-more coffin patents!
1320446056228884483 2020-10-26 03:24:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Only the supremacists are on his side. Too afraid of someone who looks or talks “funny”!
1320444818930237443 2020-10-26 03:19:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plus, he will work with all Americans-no matter their right to  their own political beliefs!
1320444379492921349 2020-10-26 03:17:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoeBiden To see compassion and warmth again! How long before Trump Mocks this, and his followers lap it right up?
1320443969499746304 2020-10-26 03:15:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s worse than defeat-they we’re to lazy to even try!
1320443649994461184 2020-10-26 03:14:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are such cowards! It’s this threat of Sleepy Joe crushing them! Trump talks out 7000 sides of his mouth, and they believe every word-hang on it!
1320443072644370435 2020-10-26 03:12:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No that would just mean they are all still heartless, corrupt and still lying about the Coronavirus? How would that be thinkable with 230,00 deaths?
1320442727650283520 2020-10-26 03:10:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just like offshore drilling-the problems stay in that state, while the money leaves!
1320442425039638529 2020-10-26 03:09:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly-imagine a president who will,listen and debate-not call them Nasty names!
1320441951355867137 2020-10-26 03:07:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pig-that’s it!
1320441787207557121 2020-10-26 03:07:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wait, I thought Trump was the least racist person in the room?
1320441457002631168 2020-10-26 03:05:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Success for our enemies-I mean his narrow field of allies! Traitor
1320441317877493766 2020-10-26 03:05:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And that not even the tip -no pun intended of his stupidity iceberg!
1320441097001250816 2020-10-26 03:04:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Time for leadership-period!
1320441016944570369 2020-10-26 03:04:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I always forget Donnie, is it sleepy Joe, or mastemindJoe?
1320440648714145802 2020-10-26 03:02:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Happy days!
1320440456879243266 2020-10-26 03:01:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s going to lose more bigly than any President has ever done before him!
1320439636234297345 2020-10-26 02:58:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Christmas was sooooo much prettier and happier then!

1320437685232799745 2020-10-26 02:50:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Doesn’t every day just get gooder?
1320434570450341888 2020-10-26 02:38:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Death profiteers
1320434371569045504 2020-10-26 02:37:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oui!
1320433964809596928 2020-10-26 02:36:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You pathetic ugly witch!
1320433550638931969 2020-10-26 02:34:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe they realize the path to renewable energy will save our planet for their children and grandchildren, and will create better jobs-who knew?
1320432918901202946 2020-10-26 02:31:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Don’t bother, they no absolutely nothing of duty or obligation! We struggle like they can’t imagine, or even if they could imagine it-they simply don’t care! Let them eat cake!
1320432334257168385 2020-10-26 02:29:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who are these very bad people, the doctors and nurses on the front line?
1320432162668187648 2020-10-26 02:28:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember he also said they were stealing PPE-OUTRAGED
1320432011656503300 2020-10-26 02:28:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ddale8 Hugs, hugs, hugs, hugs, hugs!
1320431820161372171 2020-10-26 02:27:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Please, please, can I sacrifice my life, so Trump and his cronies can make more money? Isn’t that my obligation as an American? Or folks, is that just what HE THINKS YOU OWE HIM?
1320431524894879744 2020-10-26 02:26:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Astonishing beautiful results, the best results really, and I know results! Pence #TaskFarce when you just haven’t killed enough of your fellow countrymen and women yet!
1320431164956545024 2020-10-26 02:24:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about with the best hands? Are those the hands he just grabs em by the pussy with?
1320430846801825794 2020-10-26 02:23:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoeBiden How long before Trump mocks this? Over/under?
1320430662504112131 2020-10-26 02:22:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Imagine what it’s been like all these years not having the most petty, petulant, sleazy, corrupt little man in the White House? Not 15 mind blowing scandals and dozens of nasty tweets by a President each and every day! Enough!
1320430146487226368 2020-10-26 02:20:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At a time like this-got goosebumps!
1320429488669364224 2020-10-26 02:18:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no way-Trump will pardon him immediately! This is the look he likes! Rotted fettered America-makes Putin give him more money!

1320428495848222721 2020-10-26 02:14:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Oh no? No medical Santa’s? What’s next, no more creepy little elves running this country?

1320427549437140992 2020-10-26 02:10:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So ashamed of this administration and it’s cowardice! Mark Meadows saying cant do anything...world leaders giving up like little sissies! No, Americans are fighters and we don't give up. Watch and learn how real leaders do it! Coming soon!
1320425964149575681 2020-10-26 02:04:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are so cowardly-no plan, no mask!
1320405906492956673 2020-10-26 00:44:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about a few S’s: SCAM SCAMS SCANDAL SCANDALIZE SCANDALIZED SCANDALOUS SCANDALOUSLY SCANDALS

1320402420430667777 2020-10-26 00:30:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Glad he made us great again!
1320402253447090176 2020-10-26 00:30:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Money over death! Greed over compassion! Hate over love...
1320401978720178178 2020-10-26 00:28:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love politicians who aren’t terrified of losing!
1320401805935783939 2020-10-26 00:28:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NC is Biden-and damn proud of it!
1320400802121437184 2020-10-26 00:24:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let freedom from this coward ring! America is not cowardly-so show the world our courage and vote them all out! Vote blue down the ballot!
1320400240608972806 2020-10-26 00:22:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We’d like decent, compassionate, dignified, hard working leadership! Vote Blue down the ballot!
1320399979068928000 2020-10-26 00:21:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I bet these weren’t even made in China!
1320399796285353984 2020-10-26 00:20:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> For once, he will have to listen to us!
1320399638986428416 2020-10-26 00:19:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1320399355107594243 2020-10-26 00:18:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s so outraged that Americans are voting-wake up! Why would a President who serves our nation be outraged by this? Do I really have to spell it out?
1320398655313088512 2020-10-26 00:15:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The man is putrid, vile, pathological!
1320398466313408512 2020-10-26 00:15:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nice!
1320397924480765952 2020-10-26 00:12:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Rise up-stop letting this administration try to stomp out our lives, and our liberty!
1320397671920771077 2020-10-26 00:11:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So wait just a minute, you mean that he didn’t establish this 2014 act, and he didn’t pull $17,000,00- out of his Trumps Chinese bank account in 2017? These numbers like years and dates are so confusing-is his dementia really THAT bad?
1320397097103953923 2020-10-26 00:09:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Blame Trump-he’s brought out the worst in them. He’s led them around like little sheep, and now they are paying the price!
1320396632681230343 2020-10-26 00:07:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jaime rocks! Such a down to earth, kind, hard working soul! He’s going to clean out the cobwebs of that old rich whit’s men with no scruples Senate!
1320396112096825345 2020-10-26 00:05:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love NC for being so country over party! I lI’ve here and only the poorest white of the poor, and the jackass money grabbers still support Trump! We are BRIGHT BLUE ALL THE WAY!
1320395406916964352 2020-10-26 00:02:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The quiet part...
1320395225026695168 2020-10-26 00:02:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m still not convinced-I think it’s working
1320395093174530051 2020-10-26 00:01:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At least we know there won’t be a load of nuns standing so closely behind Pence, don’t worry Mother!
1320394886705762305 2020-10-26 00:00:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m still not convinced! The fake one has way too much class showing, not enough ass showing. Very telling!  https://t.co/chGm8rSt5G
1320394518269710343 2020-10-25 23:59:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Make sure they come complete with the wedding ring?!?
1320394354364764161 2020-10-25 23:58:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s the bestest more beautiful operation Task Farce leader!
1320393837056040965 2020-10-25 23:56:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Tragic or the fact that Dr Fauci‘s family has to have security just to be outside1
1320393618574761989 2020-10-25 23:55:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me either? What’s the point? Meadows just announced they can’t fight it! So just follow their example and give up, right? Oh you can’t because you aren’t cowardly, pathteic lazy incompetent human beings?
1320393143095824387 2020-10-25 23:53:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lest we forget just a few short months ago-when he accused them of STEALING PPE! His support is just so damn heartwarming!
1320392868872265728 2020-10-25 23:52:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay-Trumps armageddon will be the best one ever!
1320391046958845954 2020-10-25 23:45:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @johnpavlovitz Thanks needed this!
1320390847620329476 2020-10-25 23:44:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @4laurie2 @KhrissyChoate @jimsciutto Apparently the GOP and his supporters even dumber than he is, because they always praise everything he does. Is this shit for real. Or, am I going to wake up soon? It’s getting harder to tell!
1320390316046811137 2020-10-25 23:42:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio @ProjectLincoln Make sure Barr represents them, so we can foot that bill too!
1320389952446910464 2020-10-25 23:41:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lesson we learned? Maybe Presisdents should have to pass an IQ test? Plus, show their taxes, divest themselves from their business, not hire all their children, not have an 89% turn over ratio from their A list appointments? Just saying...
1320388171922890753 2020-10-25 23:34:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG YES!
1320387986949799937 2020-10-25 23:33:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Country always comes first!
1320387778031636480 2020-10-25 23:32:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s such an economic genius! Love his winning strategies.
1320386981315096577 2020-10-25 23:29:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She’s an obvious plant-I mean she shares Trumps hair stylist! Apparently she has more money though!
1320385203601362945 2020-10-25 23:22:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps a PEDO
1320385123724988416 2020-10-25 23:21:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It was also so very funny when she told all Americans to boycott Goodyear, oh wait...
1320384345035689985 2020-10-25 23:18:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At this point no, because it’s Premeditated now!
1320382730836807680 2020-10-25 23:12:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 121 days-Trump,is such a human disgrace!

1320380598557573123 2020-10-25 23:04:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s coming to NC today!
1320380515124379648 2020-10-25 23:03:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I give a shit about you vs I don’t give a shit about you, yiur family, our great nation. Pence #Taskfarce
1320380079894048768 2020-10-25 23:01:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> lets not forget a few months ago when he accused them of stealing PPE
1320377855428145152 2020-10-25 22:53:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pathetic lazy cowards! Show me one other nation in the world this ridiculous!
1320377392452505603 2020-10-25 22:51:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type His NC neighbors to the North love Jaime!
1320377223136903168 2020-10-25 22:50:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s absolutely criminal
1320376397450313730 2020-10-25 22:47:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He also accused them months ago of stealing PPE! Fun times-want a disgrace!
1320374934502318080 2020-10-25 22:41:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @john_sipher Done!
1320373902477058048 2020-10-25 22:37:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @choo_ek They just make it worse with every ridiculous action, lie, and sheer cowardice! Americans are brave and we could have beaten this virus and saved each other and our economy! we could and should have been who the world looked to in this crisis. all our credibility is lost!
1320373319036796932 2020-10-25 22:35:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are Trumpers so seriously blond that they can’t imagine the sheer Economic devastation this will wreak? How can they be this stupid? It’s the worst strategy in the history!
1320371753684795396 2020-10-25 22:28:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Right his 15 magically went down to 8.5 million! Hell yes I’m angry as any human being with a soul would be!
1320371481969381379 2020-10-25 22:27:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BillKristol Chilling to the bone!
1320370394273075202 2020-10-25 22:23:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why do they even put forth the effort? This filthy lazy administration does nothing 24/7 but speared disinformation about this virus!
1320369647439536128 2020-10-25 22:20:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sick bastards!
1320369493789507584 2020-10-25 22:19:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @djrothkopf @medit8now Happy death day to you-sincerely the White House!
1320369091337736192 2020-10-25 22:18:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes and that leads to effective contact tracing to quarantine and stop the spread. Well we could have had effective contact tracing at some point-but not with our insane daily numbers, and appallingly slow test results. LAZY STUPID MURDERING FILTHY HORRIFIC MONSTERS!
1320368414133800960 2020-10-25 22:15:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, he wouldn‘t claim to be her-she was a nobody because she wasn’t rich!
1320368101070950402 2020-10-25 22:14:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Penny_816 @ddale8 I have to say-you make Me miss my sweet Himalayan!
1320366123624419330 2020-10-25 22:06:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Democrats know all about hard work and accomplishing the goals you set! We are united in our love for this great nation and we will undue the chaos!
1320365320771674112 2020-10-25 22:03:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But what’s his inmate Number going to be?
1320365030488027136 2020-10-25 22:02:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such heart-you can see it in his eyes! Trump has never smiled like that. He just leers 24/7!
1320364581773053954 2020-10-25 22:00:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BCOOL333 Biden is LANDSLIDEN
1320364399736008710 2020-10-25 21:59:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess relying on magic wasn’t their best strategy?
1320364032960987138 2020-10-25 21:58:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love how this administration brings out the racity racist best people!
1320363723366813696 2020-10-25 21:56:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We are humiliating them in Record numbers too impossible to ignore!
1320362283864817666 2020-10-25 21:51:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m still trying to figure out why one of the nuns is wearing a wedding ring?
1320362025416073217 2020-10-25 21:50:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why are they sprinkling it with pixie dust? They’ve known about it all along! Makes COVID magically delicious. It’s better than what Pence’s task farce is doing! Love that the infected beast is coming to my state today. So noble when Kamala actually followed the guidelines!
1320360530742304768 2020-10-25 21:44:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nice-we are too busy making money and cozying up,to dictators to due our Duty to our country. So....Happy Death Day America!
1320360105934770176 2020-10-25 21:42:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KevinMKruse It’s exhausting
1320359971960332288 2020-10-25 21:42:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plus Ohio-they didn’t ask ALL OF AMERICA to boycott Goodyear for not allowing workers to wear MADE IN CHINA MAGA hats!
1320359338838458368 2020-10-25 21:39:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pence so far: heads task force, which turns into tasks farce, which turns into death force! 15 all the way down to 8.5 million
1320358956993306626 2020-10-25 21:38:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think about this folks! Greed over sensible leadership. Lives matter to Biden and Harris more then money and getting elected!
1320358670027444224 2020-10-25 21:36:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And now Pence is still coming to my state today!
1320358064839708673 2020-10-25 21:34:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Enough50513024 @CRose2u @InspiringU2 We did too!
1320233437526171648 2020-10-25 13:19:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s see-resemblance  https://t.co/XABNpg8B3R
1320232145592422401 2020-10-25 13:14:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MysterySolvent The count is up to 5 now
1320230601279012865 2020-10-25 13:07:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Rounding the corner folks! Pence’s #TaskFarce
1320227699382771713 2020-10-25 12:56:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Another one of those blue states who can’t get this under control
1320224019556204546 2020-10-25 12:41:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> All those roads lead to the Village Idiot!
1320223445318291457 2020-10-25 12:39:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh yes folks-he’s actually that dumb, and then some!
1320222488417226752 2020-10-25 12:35:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Head of the Pence‘s #taskfarce
1320221547769090048 2020-10-25 12:32:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s a monster- plain and simple!
1320221210886737920 2020-10-25 12:30:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But wait, Donnie said it would magically disappear-I don’t trust scientists who don't believe in magic
1320219422687154176 2020-10-25 12:23:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Shocking...
1320218367341531136 2020-10-25 12:19:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> it shows what you get when you try suppress us!

1320216514121838595 2020-10-25 12:12:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ShawnInArizona Congrats
1320215991360565248 2020-10-25 12:09:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OMG if you can watch this and still believe that COVID isn’t to be taken seriously -then I wonder if you are capable of dressing yourself without help!
1320214351836549121 2020-10-25 12:03:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Glad that 99% aren’t affected at all!
1320213692957532160 2020-10-25 12:00:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, yes it is!
1320213301272477696 2020-10-25 11:59:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Another excellent job by Pence‘s #taskfarce
1320212600999772160 2020-10-25 11:56:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m so jealous!
1320212124245889024 2020-10-25 11:54:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s a heartwarming sight
1320211429279125517 2020-10-25 11:51:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s essential at running the COVID #taskfarce
1320210570818260992 2020-10-25 11:48:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kumailn @waltshaub It’s such a burden
1320210368300462080 2020-10-25 11:47:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s exactly what it will take-they don’t a S$it about us! Look at our numbers under Pence‘s #taskfarce
1320210048736501761 2020-10-25 11:46:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Under the stellar command of the Pence‘s #taskfarce

1320209005722161155 2020-10-25 11:42:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CharityMain306 @Santucci @ABC @KFaulders @jonkarl @rickklein What task force? Are you telling me we have a COVID task farce?
1320208462723284993 2020-10-25 11:40:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Healthcare workers-VOTE or we ALL die! He says you are making up COVID!
1320208142228246529 2020-10-25 11:38:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about the reckless way he told Americans to boycott Goodyear?
1320207805761134592 2020-10-25 11:37:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @sultanofkhatib @MeidasTouch OHIO-You really want to vote for the fool who could have recklessly cost you jobs when he told us to BOYCOTT Goodyear!
1320207331205042177 2020-10-25 11:35:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And COVIDPence is still campaigning as well!
1320206738281431040 2020-10-25 11:33:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
1320205857523703808 2020-10-25 11:29:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Stop the lying! This gets more horrific by the minute!
1320205247881641985 2020-10-25 11:27:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trumps got the BEST most beautiful numbers-89% turnover ratio of his top A team! It doesn’t count positions have been filled more than once already during his administration.
1320202963281977348 2020-10-25 11:18:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s filed Chapter 11 on our lives!
1320202810928091136 2020-10-25 11:17:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s like COVID is all this lazy corrupt and incompetent administration is willing to give Americans!
1320202557722185728 2020-10-25 11:16:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s like COVID is all this administration is willing to give Americans!
1320201522391732231 2020-10-25 11:12:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Rschooley Agree, but we start with this, Joe won’t let us keep suffering!
1320200207578005510 2020-10-25 11:07:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But this Mfr palms on coming to my state tomorrow?
1320199893911277568 2020-10-25 11:05:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NC doesn’t want him with or without COVID-it’s too late so stay away from us you filthy rotten super spreading pig!
1320199516377780232 2020-10-25 11:04:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OHIO-still on the fence, or even thinking of voting Trump-listen very closely-Trump told Americans to BOYCOTT GOODYEAR!
1320197824458444800 2020-10-25 10:57:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DebbieforFL @grantstern @votedaniella @RubenGallego @BarackObama Feels like America again!
1320196100029095941 2020-10-25 10:50:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RVAT2020 @ratemyskyperoom That’s Trump in a nutshell!
1320195931388678144 2020-10-25 10:50:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay Josh-another NC Biden voter here! Way to go!
1320195455763075072 2020-10-25 10:48:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How are these exhausted health care workers su-posed to have hope-when every single thing he does undermines their efforts?
1320194310063751168 2020-10-25 10:43:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DSmith9130 @ZevShalev @narativ_live You are 100% Cordero, and this man realizes this-even though he plays dumb. His tricks cause knee jerk stock market reactions and insider trading-its all about the dollar to him. He has no soul.
1320193236774887424 2020-10-25 10:39:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wake up America! Since you Trumpers don’t have any compassion over this family tragic loss-maybe the $1,000,000 hospital bill (how many of these are out there and to come), and realize that Trumps killing and bankrupting Americans all for his selfishness, ignorance and greed!
1320192286542778368 2020-10-25 10:35:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @morethanmySLE @joncoopertweets Jaime Harrison!

1320190587300155393 2020-10-25 10:28:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @navywifeproud Hang in there-and you have to vote! I did-and I’m in the same in boat. No one knows who you are voting for. Believe me, the relief you‘ll feel afterward will be so much better than the regret of not voting! Virtual hugs!
1320189716688474112 2020-10-25 10:25:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> My faith in humanity!
1320189595150094337 2020-10-25 10:25:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If Trump even began to comprehend the struggle of blacks, he would have respected John Lewis when asked about him instead of whining that he didn’t come to his inauguration-while that  same dipshit didn’t attend his funeral!

1320045277626175489 2020-10-25 00:51:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd say that seniors haven't fared well &amp; with Trump not caring about stopping COVID will not fare well until he's out of office! At the Villages of all places with another super spreader rally. There is no way on earth to EVER justify that. He puts money and politics over lives.
1320044520730480641 2020-10-25 00:48:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @potus_phony @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Think they said 12 people in the Villages had died from COVID yesterday (probably from Pence being there) and Trump still goes there, and they STILL eat it up!

Under his  proposed rule, the annual J1  visa renewal would require an additional step, applying through US Customs &amp;  Immigration Services. That  could take 5-19 months, &amp;  interrupt doctors' ability to continue working!
1319893667100884992 2020-10-24 14:49:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The simple truth: Love not hate makes America great!

1319836611559948288 2020-10-24 11:02:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s a genius way to keep the virus in check! So since the dumbest thing waver-no testing no cases...now is no reporting no cases?
1319835619439366145 2020-10-24 10:58:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy this sounds pretty suspicious folks! "The RNC appears to be personally enriching Hannity while he dedicates airtime to promoting Trump," said Brett Kappel, campaign finance and government ethics expert at the law firm Harmon Curran.

1319829442722729985 2020-10-24 10:33:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has Trump even acknowledged them? Has he once put on his big boy pants and said-no rally super spreaders? Wear a mask? Did he actually mock someone today inside the Oval Office for wearing a mask?

1319730000715800581 2020-10-24 03:58:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He took 25 cases down to 8.5 Million! His incompetence is criminal!

1319697699256619009 2020-10-24 01:50:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who are the violent ones again? Trump as always speaks out both sides of his mouth, one moment calling Joe Sleepy, and the next acting like his this all powerful vehicle of destruction!

1319663825487089665 2020-10-23 23:35:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just like Kayleigh said he was joking about cutting testing because no tests means no COVID. He said he wasn't joking. The ignorance and incompetence is staggering and heart breaking. America-we need an actual leader. Do you realize the death he has caused and will continue?
1319663306039230464 2020-10-23 23:33:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How incompetent! I used to think highly of him. Trump has turned his brain to mush!

Even when things in the past were brought up, to admit a mistake. It's not like plenty of politicians (like the rest of us  have never made a mistake. The important thing is that we learn from it.
1319661598986874885 2020-10-23 23:26:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They haven't said anything original in 40 years!

1319661013051068416 2020-10-23 23:24:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love he sticks in the "possible" exception. I am sure the innocent Central Park 5 would say he ruined their lives, and how many FULL PAGE ads did he take out calling for any white criminals' executions?
1319660606287450112 2020-10-23 23:23:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Which is the sensible path forward.
1319660443456200704 2020-10-23 23:22:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why because they aren't white? Says the least racist person in the room.
1319660236270149632 2020-10-23 23:21:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So how does that help in any way exactly? That's always his plan-no plan but to insult others.
1319659829800173568 2020-10-23 23:19:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And you know why, because they had to force the issue so donnie wouldn't rant and shout uncontrolled! First time in debate history!
1319659471984119809 2020-10-23 23:18:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ArtAndMusic__ I wish I could have gotten to more voters. Although I know NC is turning blue for Biden, in my little town the Trump flags are all over the jacked up pick-up trucks and it's kinda scary. I've never once thought of my choice of a candidate might be a threat to my life until now!
1319657277025144833 2020-10-23 23:09:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I voted blue down the ballot this week and took with me another lifelong Republican who did the same! We love our country, and want sensible, compassionate, diplomatic leaders who will listen!

1319627643764047872 2020-10-23 21:12:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Come on gang, just stop testing. We do way too much testing, I want my life back. No testing, no cases! I love this pixie dust theory. Most Presidents have used it in the past during a time of national crisis.
1319626511251591168 2020-10-23 21:07:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If Trump wins-he won't hesitate to jail or kill anyone who opposes him.
1319625811100577792 2020-10-23 21:04:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 2016 Judge Gonzalo Curiel who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage &amp; membership in a Latino lawyers association. Paul Ryan, later called such comments “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”
1319625413329641472 2020-10-23 21:03:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump doesn't believe in a successful black man-2011 While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he ALSO argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, &amp; demanded Obama release his university transcripts.
1319625071183495168 2020-10-23 21:01:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 2010-On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.”
1319624886504067073 2020-10-23 21:01:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Racist much?  In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn’t be allowed because “they don’t look like Indians to me.”
1319624743537037312 2020-10-23 21:00:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel &amp;  Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a Black accountant: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. …
1319624348978810881 2020-10-23 20:58:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wonder how long it will take Trump to address this?
1319624136470241280 2020-10-23 20:58:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Central Park Five- “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent 7 to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens.  Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they’re guilty!
1319623880428916736 2020-10-23 20:57:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Donald Trump’s long history of racism! 1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, accused another one of Trump’s businesses of discrimination. “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said.
1319623470200795142 2020-10-23 20:55:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The drug war, a lot going on fast, and again ALL 100 senators voted for it. That he can admit a mistake, shows he's human. Trump thinks he's a God!
1319622122747158529 2020-10-23 20:50:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It sure did!
1319621795075530753 2020-10-23 20:48:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plus, Trump hid the fact that he knew it was airborne. The CDC and the WHO went back and forth on that, because they were not certain, they didn't have the information that he easily could have shared with everyone, not just Woodward on February 7th!
1319620804343156738 2020-10-23 20:44:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I never knew American's could go down that rabbit hole so easily. There is nothing, and I mean nothing in any of these scandals that they see.
1319617871799091205 2020-10-23 20:33:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's it in a nutshell. If you want American's to stop dying hand over fist, vote for Biden. He actually wants us to do the simple things to stop the spread, and stay re-opened!
1319617182586863616 2020-10-23 20:30:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How can Trump lie so much and go unchecked? For months before Joe Biden’s personal intervention, officials from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union had been lobbying the Ukrainian government to replace Shokin for the same reasons. GOP report said no wrongdoing!
1319616133239087107 2020-10-23 20:26:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hunter Biden's position with a Ukrainian energy company did not affect US policy, according to a GOP-led report. How many times does this have to be said? The GOP-led report. Trump's lies are so pathetic.
1319507462165233665 2020-10-23 13:14:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> In all fairness, since it was dark...he couldn’t see her! That whole exchange was random!
1319499546880344064 2020-10-23 12:43:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Tiffany is not even getting an invite!
1319499002904281088 2020-10-23 12:40:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PeterGleick @Mark56744423 I‘m so sorry! Joe will not only look to our scientists, but around the world so that we replicate what works. Life might be changed forever in some respects-but if anyone can get us halfway back to normal, it will be his administration hang in there!
1319497430241599488 2020-10-23 12:34:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’ve heard the accommodations are so good, Trump,has booked a week there! The golfing is outstanding
1319497134006296581 2020-10-23 12:33:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m crying!
1319496559051026432 2020-10-23 12:31:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How can we expect our exhausted health care workers and their support staff to live this as their new daily life? I don’t know how you do it. We are so blessed! These people that won’t follow a few simple rules to give you some relief...not to mention safe lives! selfish
1319494523169460226 2020-10-23 12:23:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How long were these innocent teenagers in jail for?
1319493759873277952 2020-10-23 12:20:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because he so least racist!
1319492570838335488 2020-10-23 12:15:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Even if he’s the only person the room!
1319492216218411008 2020-10-23 12:13:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> In NC 11 undecided voters: 9 said Trump lost the debate and 2 said it was a tie!
1319490662220386305 2020-10-23 12:07:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump has no manners at all-everyone is beneath him. So, he’s never learned to respect others!
1319490289636081664 2020-10-23 12:06:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SteveSchmidtSES @MSNBC @ProjectLincoln Maybe he was in shock when he finally noticed the moderator was black, and it hit him that he might not be the least racist person in the room-it was “dark” as he put it when he was looking out there.
1319443920149975043 2020-10-23 09:01:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Even Fox said so: White House says mask mandate needed in Tennessee |  https://t.co/wj4BgGW6hk › news › local › white-house-says-mask-ma... 4 days ago — NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) —
1319443613647048705 2020-10-23 09:00:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then he lied lied to us over and over again. We heard it with out own ears. He should have told everyone that it was airborne, confirmed it's 5 times deadlier than the flu, and although rare, it can affect children and anyone of any age. Faces of COVID shows the folks we lost
1319443136813408256 2020-10-23 08:58:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @TheHillReport @AriMelber I see what you did there, really good! Whine maybe too?
1319443044886847489 2020-10-23 08:58:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @joetimmer_ @ProjectLincoln @JoeBiden Calmer, I just want some calm.
1319442619001409538 2020-10-23 08:56:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks!!
1319442492585029632 2020-10-23 08:56:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick No, see the point is that this administration is insane! If masks don't work, and its so illegal and unconstitutional, then why is this administration telling TN to have a mask mandate? They are trying to help, while Trump mocks masks. See the difference?
1319442091550932993 2020-10-23 08:54:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick So, you'd happily put your 9 year old daughter in the car and she says daddy I don't like the seatbelt, you'd be good with her going through the windshield?
1319441656106672129 2020-10-23 08:52:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Fauci said that to make sure the health care workers would have enough, and because Trump didn't share that he already knew it was airborne, like we ALL heard with our own ears when he told Woodward that. If he had told Fauci what he knew, like he should have...think about that.
1319441118942138370 2020-10-23 08:50:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick The WH administration per the Associated Press: White House: Tennessee mask mandate 'must be implemented' By JONATHAN MATTISE Associated Press Updated Oct 19, 2020 | Posted on Oct 16, 2020
1319440921361027072 2020-10-23 08:50:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick I don't hate rich people at all. Riches are not what makes anyone superior, especially Trump who was simply born into wealth. It's paper, get over it. Everyone needs to pay their fair share. Folks like us can't pay everyone's share!
1319440200964124672 2020-10-23 08:47:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ChrisMegerian Exactly, who is the one that keeps hiding tax returns, secret Chinese bank accounts...children profit from daddy being in office.
1319439863154868224 2020-10-23 08:45:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick His administration did. So, I have to assume if he thinks its a sheepy Dem thing to do, he would have rage tweeted about it.
1319439456911396870 2020-10-23 08:44:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Well, then I guess it's good that you don't live in a state where the administration is asking a mask mandate be implemented. No one liked wearing seat belts, but we only wear them when we drive, just like masks are only needed in certain situations. What's the big scary deal?
1319439083761008640 2020-10-23 08:42:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am not a billionaire and I don't make over $400,000 yet. I hope to realistically in 24 months. I am getting there, and when I do, if I have a tax hike, I can live with that. I am not greedy. I am tired of billionaires like trump paying either ZERO or $750.
1319438718126665728 2020-10-23 08:41:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So I am wrong in the assumption the administration told TN to do that, and doesn't have the masters blessing? If he's had a problem with it, I surely haven't seen him rage tweeting about it! Whose administration is it?
1319438027920465921 2020-10-23 08:38:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ReesusP I am going to have this playing during the debate!
1319436809852604416 2020-10-23 08:33:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, just another boring story of fraud/corruption.
1319436495325888512 2020-10-23 08:32:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick So, the world is all full of stupid people and the deaths we've had that most days are almost one single American dying every minute from COVID. That's acceptable to you? This is not a democratic disease. This is a world wide pandemic and grown ups treat it that way.
1319436162293968897 2020-10-23 08:31:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So again, why did your WH administration tell TN they need to implement a mask mandate? If it's illegal and unconstitutional, then they are breaking the law!
1319435787616833538 2020-10-23 08:29:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wonder how much they donated to our white supremacist President? “The Base is an antisemitic, white nationalist network that trains members in survivalism and paramilitary skills to prepare them to mount an armed resistance against the government.” The Southern Poverty Law Center
1319435141702451201 2020-10-23 08:27:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ask dummy why he disbanded the pandemic response team! Maybe that's why he got 25M from China? Maybe that's why he never stops lying about COVID? How many deaths were required for that much money?
1319434799300382721 2020-10-23 08:25:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> SMASHING RECORDS~ Poor Trumpy. He's in debt up to his eyeballs, well except that 17 million that's missing from his Chinese bank account.
1319434582006128640 2020-10-23 08:24:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know why? Every decent American wants a real President again. Not a Tweeter, not a screamer, not a they are never fair to me, not a makeup wearer, a real man!
1319434244146561027 2020-10-23 08:23:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick I don't understand your argument. Europe did a good job after they got a handle on it, and now they are spiking again. Which proves what? It's a virus transmitted through the air. It's highly contagious, and it demands a few simple things to slow/stop it. That's it.
1319433885676150786 2020-10-23 08:22:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't know how many times I have to say this-I am a Republican (well not any longer). I am a successful hard working tax paying business owner. I grew up in a factory town. I am not an elitist. My houses are not gilded. If I am able, I help others with time or money. No bubble
1319433255423250433 2020-10-23 08:19:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick so your 16,266 deaths are all young people?
1319433032802160646 2020-10-23 08:18:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Remember your WH administration has told TN to implement a mandatory mask mandate. So, now explain how your WH administration can tell a state to do something that is so illegal and unconstitutional?
1319432630325157889 2020-10-23 08:17:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick What does population have to do with it? It's your testing capacity per person that needs a test! Why don't you understand that is the only thing that matters. Oh, that's right you listen to Trump who doesn't understand it either!
1319432354428030977 2020-10-23 08:16:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Because your idiot let this run rampant, we are going to have a 16 TRILLION &amp; counting economic reckoning!  Taiwan had a plan in place for years, which involved quarantines, contact tracing and wide availability of masks, among other things.
1319431810846162944 2020-10-23 08:13:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick @giard_joan How are 220,000 dead people going to pay their deductibles, co-pays, specialist fees and labs??? I am sure the hospitals are making tons of money that way-dead people always make sure they pay their bills.
1319431559645220869 2020-10-23 08:12:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick I suppose you don't wear a seatbelt either?
1319431246154506243 2020-10-23 08:11:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I was hoping you'd go there, then why did your White House administration tell TN to implement a mandatory mask mandate? Answer that! Who said anything about a 3 month shut down? Your dumbass leader has got us to 8.4M cases!
1319430916289298432 2020-10-23 08:10:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then why are there shortgages? Do you work in the health care industry? Do you really think these people wear gear for 9 hours a day and hold in their bodily functions because we have enough?
1319430749171388422 2020-10-23 08:09:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Population means nothing. It's per capita testing. If only 2 people live here, then you only need 2 tests...Stop with the nursing home BS. If a senior was in a hospital &amp; no longer needed hospitalization and a doctor signed off on their release, what hospital would keep them?
1319427857437855745 2020-10-23 07:58:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just 31 weeks in a row with more jobless claims than any week of the Great Recession! Too bad Trump didn't get off his lazy fat ass and at least attempt to tell the truth about COVID and stop it! 15 down to 8.4 Million is a mf S^itty job!
1319425137331101697 2020-10-23 07:47:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd probably stop lying-yesterday saying we've rounded the corner-The corner into flu season. What an idiot! How could you possibly defend this fool? He's so stupid I don't know how he gets dressed by himself...well he doesn't, that's right. Pry doesn't do his own makeup either.
1319424636342460417 2020-10-23 07:45:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> "We want to help -- to send out our great doctors, our great researchers, our great nurses -- and to share our knowledge and experience with countries that need it," Vice President Chen Chien-jen, a Johns Hopkins-trained epidemiologist, told the American Chamber of Commerce
1319424457044353029 2020-10-23 07:44:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh and just for further embarrasement...Taiwan is in such a strong position now that, after weeks of banning the export of face masks to ensure the domestic supply, the government said Wednesday that it would donate 10 million masks to the United States
1319419894966996995 2020-10-23 07:26:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At a minimum I'd look at the list of 124 action items Taiwan rapidly employed. If he has time to Tweet all day, he can Google that! I'd assist the states any state where Americans live, Red or Blue, we are all American with whatever they needed to stop this virus!
1319419394259378182 2020-10-23 07:24:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I would understand the difference between a large number of tests, and tests per capita. I'd also understand case and death tolls per capita. I'd not say one day it will magically disappear. I never remember another President relying on pixie dust to get us out of something!
1319419099798188034 2020-10-23 07:23:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I would have looked to meet with successful leaders and gather information on what worked/didn't work. I'd let the doctors and scientists hold the COVID news briefs as past presidents have ALWAYS done, not hold them myself.
1319418798550679552 2020-10-23 07:22:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I would have left the Pandemic Response in place. I would have immediately stockpiled PPE. How many times even now have hospital systems said they are in short supply? I would have not mocked masks, nor head super spreader events. I would not pull out from the WHO.
1319415048113094656 2020-10-23 07:07:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This type of corruption?  https://t.co/stTjeChC97
1319414443911020544 2020-10-23 07:04:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick Isn't it the Republicans who  recently concluded their investigation that found no wrongdoing by the Bidens, claims to the contrary have continued to circulate on social media.
1319413724059414528 2020-10-23 07:01:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What I'd say there is proof of is Trump's Chinese bank account.
1319413573093904384 2020-10-23 07:01:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump to Stern: Well I'll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show, &amp; everyone's getting dressed &amp; ready &amp; everything else,-&amp; I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant &amp; therefore I'm inspecting it...I want to make sure that everything is good
1319412319789735936 2020-10-23 06:56:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @skootzkitty @SenKamalaHarris @ChirlCrawford Don't worry! We are voting in numbers way too large to ignore! This monster won't be re-elected.
1319412192303812610 2020-10-23 06:55:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are just so heartless!
1319409986636779522 2020-10-23 06:47:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or the 13 year old that alleged he raped her?
1319409146161221633 2020-10-23 06:43:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jaime is amazing! He's going to be a wonderful refreshing change in that doldrum of dank stale old fish!
1319408943962202112 2020-10-23 06:43:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He literally could have caused the execution of a sitting Governor....or the death of Dr. Fauci....
1319408664088805376 2020-10-23 06:41:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lock them ALL up with no bail, no time off for good behavior! I mean really....
1319408519507021825 2020-10-23 06:41:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Both sides didn't agree, one demanded. The other wants him to be childish and foolish and lose any remaining undecided voters...and decided to not lose this chance!
1319407961027055618 2020-10-23 06:39:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope they move him further away at least! Trump cry baby Me strong man, me no believe in science had to be demanding that! What an idiot! I hope they ask him why they did that!!!!!!!
1319407680675512320 2020-10-23 06:37:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Even without him releasing his tax returns, we've found out some of the most corrupt things our nation has ever seen!
1319406505268027392 2020-10-23 06:33:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 20 MILLION MORE and early voting will produce more votes than Trump got in 2016!
1319405531782676487 2020-10-23 06:29:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But at least he's probably sent 715,000 tweets! That's my POTUS!
1319404986464436224 2020-10-23 06:27:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Abject failure!
1319404940113182721 2020-10-23 06:27:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, we should have followed the protocols, planned from the beginning and a federal response should have been immediate! Other countries with true leadership have faired better from doing what they all expected we'd do! Murder more of us Trump!
1319402612085739525 2020-10-23 06:17:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I've voted, and I am exhausted. I am watching just to get glimpses of how a president is supposed to act with grace, dignity, diplomacy, and compassion. Can I please be the one to hit the mute button on the mic? I don't want to hear Trump speak ever again. It sickens me.
1319401956465610755 2020-10-23 06:15:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Path to ruin....I'd say the road has collapsed and we've been buried under a volcano!
1319401156565733378 2020-10-23 06:12:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And one who pays $188,000 in taxes to an adversary maybe? Who is he helping? America with $750, or China with $188,000?
1319400948897353731 2020-10-23 06:11:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope they interview Keisha Bottoms later! She's so sweet, even when she calls you a man who hates powerful black women, it's still cute!!!
1319400432691826690 2020-10-23 06:09:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you freaking kidding me? Read this-seriously! READ THIS! OMG. Nothing says I am a dictator like I select anyone who works for the government to determine their loyalty to me?
1319399435642822663 2020-10-23 06:05:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pennyhenny3 You'll get a laugh from the video I just posted!
1319398547154980864 2020-10-23 06:01:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, and all the photos of Donnie and Jeffie...together!
1319398356825870336 2020-10-23 06:00:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Will do, I am hoping I can have some downtime from Twitter and enjoy some of the simpler things in life again!
1319395046383325185 2020-10-23 05:47:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So were these text messages actually stored on his laptop? Isn't that why we have phones? To text...where is this from?
1319394748319367172 2020-10-23 05:46:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The shattering records everywhere from early voting show that Biden is winning. Now, that doesn't mean anyone can slack, it's our duty to vote!
1319394369078726656 2020-10-23 05:45:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @osullivanauthor I am going to get your book!
1319394099099820033 2020-10-23 05:44:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Got it! #SippyCupTrump
1319393673604485120 2020-10-23 05:42:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Finish it Jaime! Even though you don't represent me in NC as your neighbor to the North, I'll be so glad when you are Senator Harrison!
1319392762404417536 2020-10-23 05:38:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Do they have the voters permission to film them?
1319392668712042496 2020-10-23 05:38:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When will they ever understand per capita testing? Why do tests still take so long to get processed?
1319390428299481088 2020-10-23 05:29:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So you are on board with Trump's health plan that he's been promising that he said on 60 minutes that he will start working on soon....if ACA is overturned before-then who protects those millions with pre-existing conditions?
1319389450187821058 2020-10-23 05:25:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yay!!!
1319389320311132164 2020-10-23 05:25:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #DelicateDonald #TheWimpyDon
1319387704451358728 2020-10-23 05:18:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think he's actually turned on by it. I think he likes us dying at his hands!
1319384200190058496 2020-10-23 05:04:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's wonderful news! We are all patriots and want our country out of the hands of this madman! Thank you!!!
1319383683212726283 2020-10-23 05:02:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The sad thing is that they really haven't been that tough on him. He gets it way too easy! He just has no idea of the actual responsibilities of a grown man, let alone the President of our great nation.
1319383120030932993 2020-10-23 05:00:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because you are the bomb Jaime! He's scared to hear your refreshing ideas. He's scared his voters will know you mean business!
1319382861041045516 2020-10-23 04:59:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Michael Cohen: Donald Trump family will be in big trouble when the ‘IRS gets their hands on them with all of the tax evasion’
1319382734956040194 2020-10-23 04:58:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It will come about 3 years after they vote down ACA. However, if Trump is this lazy now, imagine how freaking lazy he will be if he gets re-elected!
1319382232210018324 2020-10-23 04:56:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Moonbat13 @AG2Pearl @mmpadellan I don't think they could ever do enough good in my lifetime to convince me to go down that rabbit hole again!
1319382065557737473 2020-10-23 04:56:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Amen!!!
1319381930119471105 2020-10-23 04:55:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpisPathetic Debate Chaos tonight! Lets see, he's had about 17 MAJOR scandals since the last debate. Most are probably felonies....I am really hoping we focus on Amtrak all night!
1319381280325292032 2020-10-23 04:53:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @kirkacevedo @joncoopertweets Is she willing to run for President?
1319381146338267144 2020-10-23 04:52:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sad...what's going to happen when flu season is underway? You really want Trumps America?
1319380068318302208 2020-10-23 04:48:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @power2she @MuellerSheWrote I am so sorry. I do to. I am not only exhausted from that, and COVID, but this man...he outdoes each disaster scandal-I am just on overload. None of us should have to suffer from the man "serving" our great nation!
1319379789506088972 2020-10-23 04:47:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump, release your taxes...we are still waiting.
1319378529478447105 2020-10-23 04:42:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Still need about a million more reasons he won't release his taxes? Seriously! This man is not even corrupt, he's worse than corrupt!
1319360919969931264 2020-10-23 03:32:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great, so his genius plan is wanting to end Obamacare, and "we WILL come up with a plan". Can you imagine? He will never come up with a plan. If he gets re-elected, he will be even LAZIER if thats at all possible!
1319355602401972224 2020-10-23 03:11:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We "will" come up with a plan what after ACA is overturned and millions of American's with pre-existing conditions are screwed? This man NEVER HAS A PLAN! Never will. Do not be fooled America!
1319354297440763909 2020-10-23 03:05:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @IngrahamAngle So what should she have asked him specifically?
1319352015336689664 2020-10-23 02:56:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She's spot on!
1319351748553736197 2020-10-23 02:55:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He is pretty much disrespectful of everyone, lets face it! Well, except Putin...#RussianBountiesOnOurTroops
1319341578415202304 2020-10-23 02:15:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It doesn't matter what they do! We are all so fed up with Trump, we will stand in line for days to vote him out. All of these issues &amp; early voter turnout has been record setting! I like Presidents who aren't owned by China, and Russia!
1319285764899794945 2020-10-22 22:33:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who exactly owns Mar A Lago? Ghislaine Maxwell doesn’t remember where she met Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the woman who says she was recruited from a job at Mar-a-Lago as a teenager to become a Jeffrey Epstein masseuse and eventually a “sex slave.”
1319285381871800323 2020-10-22 22:32:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That #TrumpStink is hard to get off!
1319284362639069185 2020-10-22 22:27:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DuMpTrUmPs2020 @BillOReilly I know, it feels like 12 years right now! NC is on fire voting Democrat. We opened up early voting on the 15th, and I went yesterday and still an hour wait. Not bad compared to other places, but actually glad to see that masked calm voters standing in line-prob voting DEM!!
1319277182808539141 2020-10-22 21:59:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If someone is appointed by Trump, then I think they are incapable of telling the truth! Think about what all the truth's are! They know they are all committing fraud, treason, etc.
1319276760291102720 2020-10-22 21:57:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, it's the truth! I don't even know how it's physically and mentally possible for one person to tell so many lies. How does that work exactly?
1319276374775885825 2020-10-22 21:56:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Mioewing @RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't that be nice! I miss boring.

1319276014879453184 2020-10-22 21:54:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow, if this really isn't brainwashing, then what is?
1319275517317574656 2020-10-22 21:52:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But Hunter's e-mails!
1319121759925424132 2020-10-22 11:41:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ron Perlman hates both of them?
1319121438914338822 2020-10-22 11:40:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you! I voted for Biden today in NC!
1319121214971969542 2020-10-22 11:39:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #SpeakUpVoteBiden voted blue down the ballot today! Took about an hour, 6th day of early voting and lines are still long all day in NC! Amazing turnout!
1319117067354820608 2020-10-22 11:23:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Melania forgets to tick in her shirts-oh I mean she forgets to wear shirts!
1319114045694332929 2020-10-22 11:11:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s so lazy!
1319112920127705089 2020-10-22 11:06:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> FLOTUS-does this untucked shirt make me look fat?  https://t.co/4xTQBpP5Fi
1319112277262557184 2020-10-22 11:04:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are these FLOTUS photos on it?  https://t.co/j5QtZm8m7Q
1319112000899874816 2020-10-22 11:03:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did they find these FLOTUS photos on his laptop?  https://t.co/k2guyRpf2s
1319111523969761281 2020-10-22 11:01:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Do they detail Trumps Chinese back account too?
1319111265973903361 2020-10-22 11:00:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1319111179437068289 2020-10-22 10:59:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can some please help Melania Trump? I don’t think her shirt is tucked in?  https://t.co/PWhSBLgrfI
1319109384966971392 2020-10-22 10:52:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MisterOctoberAZ @John_Hudson @hrw @nahaltoosi Too funny! I love Father Ted!
1319105265900359683 2020-10-22 10:36:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow-I’m just at a loss. Trump is the most anti everything that’s good in the world
1319104380449247239 2020-10-22 10:32:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hmmm would that be an actual President doing his actual job to serve the people of this great United States?
1319099761094438913 2020-10-22 10:14:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So we’re they (the framers) concerned about  how ugly the faux wood panelling Jeep Wagoners would be for drive-up voting? What types of vehicles were they concerned about back in 1788, or was it the Ford GT Specifically?
1319095903978987520 2020-10-22 09:59:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yum
1319094756543205378 2020-10-22 09:54:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚👌🤚🤚🤚
1319093660206727168 2020-10-22 09:50:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has Li’l Trumpy addressed this yet?
1318975368376819712 2020-10-22 02:00:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I‘m not from MD, although I’ve visited an love Baltomire and Annapolis you are showing that you are an “Americans” Republican. Thank you Governor
1318974617269248000 2020-10-22 01:57:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ahhh let’s see so many to chose from, can I get a little hint, please?
1318974482124591111 2020-10-22 01:56:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about just in her are will you shut up man? Although, the more he opens his filthy lying mouth, another Biden Angel gets its wings!
1318974169103716352 2020-10-22 01:55:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So resdy
1318973481791426561 2020-10-22 01:52:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But Trump loves the blacks, oops Central Park Five and all!
1318972056952885248 2020-10-22 01:46:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know and I’m thrilled! Every Republican I know, myself included is voting blue down the ballot to end this unchecked corruption, ignorance, violence, racism-which yay to a very Southern state-sooooo good to see the change! NC Rocks!
1318971654391857155 2020-10-22 01:45:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Amy_Siskind Donated
1318971374032093186 2020-10-22 01:44:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you!
1318970962520440833 2020-10-22 01:42:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s not your choice to cause death in a world wide GLOBAL  pandemic. It’s not your choice to overburden our health care system &amp;  our exhausted doctors, nurses &amp;  their support staff. It’s not your choice to do irreparable harm to our economy. It’s a virus-that is deadly!
1318970054042669056 2020-10-22 01:39:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When are childish people going to realize how bad this is? When people like you, and all other health care workers give up? If Trump supporters are too cowardly to wear a mask to protect others and too selfish to not attend his super spreader events-how long can you do this?
1318959817072005122 2020-10-22 00:58:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too!
1318959404297891840 2020-10-22 00:56:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @pennyhenny3 I just can't imagine what they are going through. They are basically now caring for the majority people that haven't cared enough about them to wear a mask and socially distance. You just get these HUGE outbreaks, and that's why. It's very difficult to understand.
1318958757460774915 2020-10-22 00:54:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #byerudy
1318957942415175681 2020-10-22 00:50:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are so scared of a common man!
1318957697673416704 2020-10-22 00:49:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I thought there was some little story about a hidden 17 Million-ish Chinese bank account with one of our leaders...
1318956856463810565 2020-10-22 00:46:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, I'll never get that image out of my head!
1318956712913702912 2020-10-22 00:46:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump I like Presidents who aren't owned by China!
1318956511494811655 2020-10-22 00:45:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He will be the advocate our emotionally and physically exhausted health care workers, and their support staff need. Losing patients left &amp; right, too many to care for. Worrying about their own lives and families. There are no words to express our gratitude for their sacrifices!
1318955837889667074 2020-10-22 00:42:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets make history! We love you Jaime! You are such a breath of fresh air in that damp dingy old dungeon! Can't wait to call you Senator Harrison!
1318955430551453696 2020-10-22 00:40:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> True and come on, we can do better than that! Lets show that everyone has the same rights! That we are United! That we don't need to hate. That we don't need to be battered upside the head all day with shock and scandal and corruption! Lets start to work for America!
1318954834230378498 2020-10-22 00:38:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! Decent, down to Earth. Nothing extravagant, but lets attack this!
1318954471104405504 2020-10-22 00:37:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you can donate a little, even $3! Lets take back our country folks!
1318954249322156036 2020-10-22 00:36:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes! He's destroyed us for his greed, and he's so terrible with money, he doesn't even have any left! Why can't I wake up from this nightmare. None of this can be real, can it? I'd be no more surprised to see 14,000 penguins on my living room sofa.
1318953712300265472 2020-10-22 00:34:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Everytime they are nasty and racist, America donates. It's really quite simple! We can't stand you! We want our "United" States back and life, liberty, justice for all. Not just the chosen lying thieving old white men!
1318952875943395328 2020-10-22 00:30:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think we should sue him to get a refund of our tax payer dollars (among other things), but this is absurd!
1318952217710333955 2020-10-22 00:28:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @lifesafeast @CreativCulinary Thanks!!
1318951260037500928 2020-10-22 00:24:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Would that be a cocktail recipe by chance? 🤚
1318951053463879683 2020-10-22 00:23:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How does Trump Hemorrhage so much money? Born with a silver spoon, and every privilege. Even with all his lying, cheating, and stealing he's broke!
1318950390625456128 2020-10-22 00:20:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey Hannity-Sleepy Joe was inside on the phone sharing his condolences to a widow who lost her husband to COVID, while a freak is outside stalking him.
1318947979856936962 2020-10-22 00:11:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha! Their sheer blindness is exhausting. How can they continue to support him? It's maddening!
1318947634120458241 2020-10-22 00:09:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well all powerful Sleepy Joe is preventing him from doing this now, since he is not the President. Joe sleeps and Trump  can't do his actual job. That's some scary stuff right there!
1318946960108408832 2020-10-22 00:07:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This makes me so mad. So worried about their judge after all the suffering that we have been through! It's more important to confirm their judge, then help suffering American's? Wow, Trump has taught them all so well. They no longer work or serve us, they only serve themselves.
1318946540879216642 2020-10-22 00:05:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Clarification here! We're not stupid, but his supporters are. That's why he says it. They love the 16 TRILLION and climbing COVID death his failure to plan and act though! Great for the economy!
1318945475672891399 2020-10-22 00:01:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am surprised the difference is that small! Everytime he says something hateful and nasty, we donate to Biden. Come on, who is holding out here....
1318945014161047555 2020-10-21 23:59:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Chinese Trump bank account anyone? Pouty boy has lead us into serious trouble in every way imaginable!
1318944027329372161 2020-10-21 23:55:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 🤚
1318942739833249794 2020-10-21 23:50:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly-he's so great for the economy! The COVID debt is estimated at 15 TRILLION and counting. I don't know about you, but I don't think we have that much pocket change lying around. Wait until we can't borrow for food! Great Depression is NOTHING compared to this!
1318942194804445186 2020-10-21 23:48:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like Presidents who don't pout. Boy, American's must look like a fierce worldwide force to be reckoned with! Our President runs from a reporter with his tail tucked behind his legs! Laughingstock!
1318941610143514626 2020-10-21 23:45:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh those are terrible questions. How dare she?  She must be a diseased liberal, or how about this?  A decent reporter!
1318940942984937473 2020-10-21 23:43:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Epstein is reported to have said: “The girl I was with because she was French asked me, ‘What does white trash mean?’  “Donald Trump told her, ‘That would be me without the money.’”
1318938543771844608 2020-10-21 23:33:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You mean, no Plan Trump? He's pretty happy with his ignorance, really wouldn't change much. 1000 deaths a day, not too shabby! I like President's who don't allow nearly one American to die every minute of every day from COVID!

I'm pretty happy with hospitals at capacity, 221,000 deaths, nearly a death a minute EACH DAY from COVID, &amp; doing nothing to help exhausted health care workers.

1318745184792944642 2020-10-21 10:45:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has Trump not said that he wants to withhold money to Democratic cities?

1318695560875020288 2020-10-21 07:28:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course all major polls show Biden over Trump. Why would there even be a question?

1318688202190917635 2020-10-21 06:59:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump, who do you owe like a BILLION dollars to? Where are your taxes? Why did you steal from a children's cancer charity? Why did your university rip people off? Why did Michael Cohen pay Stormy Daniels from Campaign funds? China coffins anyone-is that why you are letting us die

What does Trump think his job is?
1318686380172693505 2020-10-21 06:51:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you serious? 545 children? Sickening!
1318685911840919552 2020-10-21 06:49:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or maybe why Trump had to settle on the big rip off of Trump University, or why they stole money from a childrens cancer fund, or why a Russian bought a Trump house for double what Trump paid for it, or why his campaign managers have ALL BEEN ARRESTED!

1318682495915798531 2020-10-21 06:36:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am weakity weak President Trump. All these women are so unfair to me! I am so weak, I am a pathetic loser but all my Trumpers think I am so macho. I wine about how mean everyone is to me, while inciting horrific violence on others!
1318681643431923712 2020-10-21 06:32:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez, for everyone saying he's so macho and tough, he whines and is scared of everyone out there!
1318681501253459968 2020-10-21 06:32:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Has that #TrumpStink
1318681136118288385 2020-10-21 06:30:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, it's basically EVERY reporter except Carlson and Hannity! HE IS THE PROBLEM, not everyone else on the face of the earth!
1318680806718689290 2020-10-21 06:29:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @morethanmySLE 👋
1318650614390378496 2020-10-21 04:29:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am. I don't like it, but I do it. I can't imagine if I put someone in the ICU, or the grave. Took at dad away from his children, a wife from her husband. This is a virus. Look at NYC now...you want to tell me it doesn't work? See their numbers and their curve?
1318650348991643651 2020-10-21 04:28:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Loss this from CNN: With just two weeks until Election Day, Republicans are beginning to ponder what comes next after President Trump's reign in Washington ends
1318583655204327426 2020-10-21 00:03:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awesome!!!!!!!!
1318583585285222401 2020-10-21 00:03:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So masking is working, right? Amazing....
1318583234998009856 2020-10-21 00:01:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And let's not forget Trump rallies!
1318582525858557952 2020-10-20 23:59:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really as I am setting the worst example possible that a world leader could set right now. Fine with me! No wonder we are a laughingstock around the world though. Canada, will you ever allow us back in? Ski season is coming...
1318580657807872001 2020-10-20 23:51:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I like President's who aren't supported by the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden's niece! #TrumpOrAmerica really? So, the international terrorists love him, and he incites and inflames domestic terrorism. What a swell guy! I love this America!
1318579479984410624 2020-10-20 23:47:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha! Lying, screaming, and dancing!
1318578831758852097 2020-10-20 23:44:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Barr's legacy! He will never get that #TrumpStink off.
1318578701391581184 2020-10-20 23:43:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You are not allowed to wear anything political into the polls! These people in leadership are acting like children who love to bully, thanks to Trump being their guide. Disgusting!
1318578352396115969 2020-10-20 23:42:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just like he's winning the battle against COVID. He said 15 cases would go down to 8.2 Million, right? Is that what he said?
1318578180261896193 2020-10-20 23:41:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What??? Landslide! We really are voting in numbers TOO HUGE to corrupt! Thank you America!
1318577866628603905 2020-10-20 23:40:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpStink the gift that keeps on giving!
1318577025809059841 2020-10-20 23:37:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How many charges, indictments, convictions in this Trump admin and/or campaign circle do we need to convince his followers that yeah, the corrupt apples don't fall far from the Orange tree???
1318576740420231168 2020-10-20 23:36:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why not now? Why do we have to wait? How many China coffins has she profited from?
1318576485486264320 2020-10-20 23:35:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump, where are your taxes? Who do you owe 1.1 BILLION to? It's been 2 weeks about 2500 times
1318576298470592514 2020-10-20 23:34:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> My country matters to me too! America or Trump!
1318575314746986499 2020-10-20 23:30:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because in the end, the kickbacks and corruption of having Trump as President are worth it!
1318575187122585601 2020-10-20 23:29:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Another lie, imagine that. Do we have more deaths in America or more lies from Trump? The count for each goes up by the minute unfortunately!
1318574904195928064 2020-10-20 23:28:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrustScience
1318574139729448963 2020-10-20 23:25:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We've known that forever know! Instead of saying AMERICA or TRUMP, maybe we should say AMERICA or RUSSIA!
1318571776960581637 2020-10-20 23:16:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Couldn't agree more, and he's brought out the worst in his followers. They are so full of hate and so unreasonable. I am so tired of being called a diseased liberal-whatever that is supposed to mean!
1318569959853797376 2020-10-20 23:09:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I have dreams (when I manage to sleep) that I've been at a function, or a restaurant and I am in the middle of hundreds of people inside no masks, not even mine! It's a dreadful dream for so many reasons. We all miss each other, we miss hugs, we miss things we took for granted.
1318566433786368000 2020-10-20 22:55:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But where is Hunter, and trademarks on coffins, right? Gross! They find profit in our death. Why do think Don wants herd immunity, so they can make a few billion in coffin sales? This is so vile, it's got to be a dream...it can't be real folks!~
1318566042914926597 2020-10-20 22:53:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is the best! "You could literally have 10 monkeys with flamethrowers go after the money, and they wouldn’t have burned through it as stupidly.”
1318565606262788096 2020-10-20 22:51:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Reject Donald Trump Remember him saying what do you have to lose? Look where we are. America has NEVER looked like this.
1318565382614122496 2020-10-20 22:50:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #FoxConn Or should we just say DonConn? Farmers, China, Economy, COVID...not to mention the daily lies, tweets, hatred, violence that he incites! No more!
1318565062236381191 2020-10-20 22:49:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They will never get that #TrumpStink off! They should be worried. No one who is sane wants 4 more days of this, let alone 4 more years.
1318564733428092928 2020-10-20 22:48:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Funny, they aren't the white women at his rally's, right?
1318564582160478209 2020-10-20 22:47:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @H2002Theresa @Cleavon_MD I am so sorry for your loss. You are not alone, and hope is coming for the future from Joe. Virtual Hugs!!!
1318564179972968454 2020-10-20 22:46:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is criminal America! This is OUR money, not his! This is to fight a world wide pandemic, not something the Dems or CNN has made up. He should be arrested immediately. It's the only way to stop the death toll!
1318562691796115457 2020-10-20 22:40:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ericsslater Happy Birthday! You sir are in good company!
1318561848204152832 2020-10-20 22:36:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great a pedophile around children! Or is it 2 pedophiles? Miss Teen USA's saying he purposefully barged in on them changing-TEENAGERS! You really think it stopped there? How many years were these two tied at the hip?
1318561369105616900 2020-10-20 22:35:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Things he's made us all feel!
1318561087529287680 2020-10-20 22:33:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @funder Happy Birthday!
1318560316096118785 2020-10-20 22:30:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> There are no baseless lies that the American people should ever have to accept. Trump has no positive for us. No plan, just rants and spews hatred and lies while he tanks our economy, and sends us to an early grave!
1318559903645126656 2020-10-20 22:29:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @KamalaHarris Happy Birthday Madam Vice President! Your present is literally in the mail and you should see it around Nov 3rd!!!
1318559517718831106 2020-10-20 22:27:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Myself and another registered Republican in NC!
1318559288760127490 2020-10-20 22:26:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's exhausting! I am so over these huge lies, these huge scandals, the focus on nothing important, or urgent. I am really glad Trump has taken time to tweet and go on FOX to discuss Dr. Fauci's pitching arm! These things matter enough for a President to go on and on about now !
1318558412096131073 2020-10-20 22:23:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Going Blue all the way!
1318557171806818310 2020-10-20 22:18:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I will always chose America! America or Trump
1318556728221368320 2020-10-20 22:16:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, lets focus on his pitching arm during a worldwide pandemic because you are still such a pathetic child who WAS NOT asked to throw out the pitch. Jealous little fool who will NOT be re-elected. Can you actually work today? WTF is wrong with you? More important things to do!
1318556143174770693 2020-10-20 22:14:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you serious? After the threats you've repeatedly made? Remember, you aren't going to bail them out because they are a Blue State!
1318555737417785346 2020-10-20 22:12:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously, right now Republican means nothing but corruption and hypocrisy! #AmericaOrTrump #AmericanMurder is what they are all doing to our lives, our  and the economy! 16 TRILLION COVID debt and counting as we still continue to mock masks, and pretend COVID doesn't exist.
1318555103985651713 2020-10-20 22:10:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's because he takes his oath seriously. You take nothing seriously except tweeting, complaining, and TV ratings you moron! You really have the nerve to say Joe will take away God? He goes to church every Sunday. You do it once right before the election. You are demented!
1318380646297993218 2020-10-20 10:36:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How will we ever afford the 16 Trillion and counting of debt we owe due to Trumps mishandling of COVID? He’s great for the economy!
1318375658632957952 2020-10-20 10:17:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about the 15 cases all the way down to 8.1 million Guy?
1318374447510859776 2020-10-20 10:12:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because we know he’s spending ZERO time fighting COVID
1318372014239993858 2020-10-20 10:02:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But where is Hunter?
1318371423790993408 2020-10-20 10:00:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #EndTheChaos
1318367955491672065 2020-10-20 09:46:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez all these photos of Trump and Epstein. Did they live together?
1318366994022961153 2020-10-20 09:42:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s the self proclaimed genius at work!
1318365707797671938 2020-10-20 09:37:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s got a simple, down to Earth calm manner. We can get back to doing the simple kind things we used to. We will be ashamed of the hateful actions, when we are lead with dignity
1318360840261783552 2020-10-20 09:18:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Especially when they are saying his appalling inaction is adding up to $16 Trillion in debt-and counting! China’s economy has just been ranked number one. We will not be able to borrow money for all of our imported food. If we don’t die of COVID-we will die of starvation.
1318357302378926081 2020-10-20 09:04:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well said!
1318355895588442112 2020-10-20 08:58:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hmmm no masks-hugs and kisses! Can it get more ridiculous-we are looking at 16 Trillion in debt from COVID and counting. Do you know what our borrowing capacity is at-about 20 Trillion. When we can’t afford food...and are still not masking... what foolish children they are!
1318352651806015490 2020-10-20 08:45:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You mean this type of wholesome Christian modeling?  https://t.co/s6lHMFsuns
1318352441935646722 2020-10-20 08:44:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No-you absolutely did the right thing! Most reputable companies would have their employees wearing masks! That’s your home! You have every right to do that. You are paying them, not the other way around! This is a worldwide “fake” pandemic just to hurt Trumps election....

1318349215228100615 2020-10-20 08:32:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @linda_E5type @RBReich I’m so sorry-truly! Anxiety is awful-I know. Most people don’t understand it, and think you can simply will it away. I‘m waiting for at least a sigh of relief Nov. 3rd. This overdrive of sick, corrupt, uncaring, and scandals is too much for all of us to be burdened with.
1318342530090618880 2020-10-20 08:05:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @nixw20 It’s exhausting and depressing! Overload of hate, greed, corruption, needless COVID death toll...
1318340121830313984 2020-10-20 07:55:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Good looking group! See a mask?
1318335346162139138 2020-10-20 07:36:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s our Monet for our tests! Causes more needless deaths-How horrific do they have to get before an adult takes over the situation -GOP you deserve every down the ballot Blue you get!
1318333182312316935 2020-10-20 07:28:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RBReich Hopefully not much longer! I’m exhausted but can’t sleep until Joe wins and this waking nightmare ends!
1318332256247861250 2020-10-20 07:24:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or that they don’t have an IT person they use/trust? I’m not rich and I use one person, the same person I’ve alway used! Please!

1318310544730972160 2020-10-20 05:58:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's like he's actually campaigning for Joe, while still making sure his rabid base sends the Fauci family death threats. See how he does that all in once. Now that's multi-tasking!
1318310100151435265 2020-10-20 05:56:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We can hope he'd finally take notice of his conscience, but I won't hold my breath! I'll be glad when they do start investigating and he's in prison for life!

1318289396861489158 2020-10-20 04:34:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How does that 16 TRILLION COVID debt play into that? You folks really don't realize what we are facing due to your best economy ever President, do you? When we can't buy food...we starve.
1318289165457461252 2020-10-20 04:33:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes and I am sure that is not even counting the 16 Trillion in debt Trumps appalling lack of COVID response is creating and counting and counting and counting!
1318288717023465475 2020-10-20 04:31:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you kidding me?
1318288491827089408 2020-10-20 04:30:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Definitely Trump! We can defeat COVID by using common sense.

1318248975212871680 2020-10-20 01:53:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> YES! Dr. Fauci just endorsed Joe Biden America! The GOP is going to freak out now! I love how Trump makes this so easy!
1318248732807319552 2020-10-20 01:52:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you Dr. Fauci! We are all so saddened that your family has endured so much simply by trying to save ours.
1318247710890315777 2020-10-20 01:48:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jeez Joe-when did you put him on the Biden Campaign? Every time he talks or tweets Joe gets votes! What could be better?

1318246282964701185 2020-10-20 01:43:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> My state-NC! Thankfully it’s going to be! All Republicans that I know are so tired of this crap! They are voting blue down the ballot because the entire GOP sided with Trump time after time.
1318244774936182786 2020-10-20 01:37:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They will never get that #TrumpStink off!
1318244203047038976 2020-10-20 01:34:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! This is why a selfish spoiled idiot like Trump is so dangerous! The man who is trying to literally save our lives is getting death threats by Trump supporters. Who in their right mind would want to kill the leading expert in this field? Trump continues to encourage it!
1318242741009133568 2020-10-20 01:28:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Come on America-we can do better! Let Trump be well under 30!
1318242473890713600 2020-10-20 01:27:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> China China China-its so hard to figure out if Trump and the GOP love China more, or Russia? Funny though they love Mexicans so much they demand they pay for a wall to keep them out. Still undecided?

1318241650779578369 2020-10-20 01:24:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> His continual short sided knee jerk reactions, and unwilling to do the work needed to eradicate this virus is going to make the Great Depression look like an afternoon tea party!
1318241234075385856 2020-10-20 01:22:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are those the ones with Ivanka‘s name on them?
1318239194200899586 2020-10-20 01:14:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A Trump supporter said I was just jealous of how rich Trump is. you see, that’s all they care about. I remember an America who would place kindness and humanity over wealth. We will return to a kinder place. Remember when you were gentle and kind to a stranger? Open your heart!
1318235937021845506 2020-10-20 01:01:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Great one! Trumpers-any thoughts?

1318227540490805253 2020-10-20 00:28:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Such a sign of Trump doing a great job!
1318227296835207170 2020-10-20 00:27:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Trumpers, if your God loving, honest, drain the corrupt swamp President was actually any of those things-WHY does he fight to the death to HIDE his taxes from you? ALL other presidents have provided theirs! Really-why isn’t this the least bit suspicious to you?

1318226451951484933 2020-10-20 00:24:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Every state is blown away by increased numbers of voters! The landslide is happening, and it’s great to watch. I’m so sick of this monster! I vote blue down the ballot tomorrow, with another lifelong Republican who is doing the same!
1318224512421421056 2020-10-20 00:16:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why aren’t world leaders denouncing Trump? We will spread to them too you know?

1318222044526497794 2020-10-20 00:06:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You knew his entire family is getting death threats and you continue to say things like this! You are a horrid monster. Why a single decent human being would vote for you is beyond comprehension-not to mention the 16 TRILLION your inaction to COVID is costing us.

1317861591346515969 2020-10-19 00:14:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Plus how many millions more when we absorb 16 TRILLION in debt due to Trumps mishandling of COVID?

1317857855161143308 2020-10-18 23:59:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mikercarpenter @PalmerReport They are mounting up more than a staggering 16 TRILLION in COVID DEBT!
1317857480425328640 2020-10-18 23:58:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really? Then look for the 16 trillion in debt thanks to the EPIC Trump f-up of no plan, mocking masks, holding super spreader events will do to those who just want a job.

1317849169118318592 2020-10-18 23:25:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course-it’s what a virus does! A virus doesn’t care how stupid you are. It does what it always does! Grow up-deal with it with common sense. It sucks to wear a mask-but you are a coward if you just want to kill others!
1317845678903754753 2020-10-18 23:11:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, because they don’t have an IT person/firm that they’d regularly use!

How many billions in unpaid medical bills too by 220,000 DEAD? Will hospitals have to close permanently? What a horrific ignorant fool!
1317840171610550272 2020-10-18 22:49:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> slight correction-Anyone who associates with Trump sh;I’ll be investigated! oh that’s right...

1317837721709256709 2020-10-18 22:39:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now his appalling lack of action and planning and/or caring for that matter is costing us 16 Trillion Dollars! He's great for the economy though!
1317836835511558145 2020-10-18 22:36:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You think Trump is great for the economy? His appalling lack of response to COVID is costing us 16 TRILLION. Who is going to pay all the hospital bills? Who is going to put business lost back together? Other countries DO NOT have these staggering costs-our dollar will plummet
1317677323995344898 2020-10-18 12:02:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ps took way to long! Too many Americans have dies, lost their jobs, or their business. Too much corruption and bigotry-so you won’t be re-elected either

1317640391689121792 2020-10-18 09:35:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @risucci_rick ACLU Recap: The court essentially held that the more Trump employs crude language, ALL CAPS, and multiple exclamation points in his tweets, the more obvious it is that he is not conveying the truth, and the harder it is to sue him for defamation.

1317636973654396931 2020-10-18 09:21:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Sheepdog1787 Yes and it’s not nearly as bad as his. he has no dignit, compassion, or humanity in his soul. I’ve never hated anyone in my life, and could never imagine hating another human being. He’s a monster that looks only to enrich himself, and divide our beloved nation.
1317636244277501952 2020-10-18 09:18:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @therealDavidLuv @EricG1247 Not much longer!
1317635949392809984 2020-10-18 09:17:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd Funny-I’ve not been rude to you once, only talking about the difference of public situations that are completely night and day regarding Trump and Biden, and you keep attacking me. I have no ill will towards you, but Trump has said and done horrific things and he always will!
1317635318334386176 2020-10-18 09:15:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd Oh and the Miss Teens as in CHILDREN that said Trump often barged into their dressing room KNOWING they’d be changing clothing. But hey, you go on about Biden in public in perfectly normal situations. I’m sure these poor teenagers who Trump ogled naked is better!
1317633931475357701 2020-10-18 09:09:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd @JoeBiden So you are outraged over 25 woman that have accused a Trump of sexual assault-including a 13 year old?  You are outraged about his actual words that he just grabs any woman by the pussy because he can get away with it? That’s ADMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT
1317633258893512704 2020-10-18 09:07:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Sheepdog1787 I’d y calling all democrats stupid losers is pretty hateful.
1317633042450685954 2020-10-18 09:06:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd @JoeBiden It’s easy to Google the papers. Trumps direct FILTHY WORDS: he added, "I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab ‘em by the pussy. You can do anything
1317632564442599424 2020-10-18 09:04:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s a virus folks-it’s contagious. Trumps stupidity doesn’t mean it’s gone-pushing for 90,000 in a stadium is absurd!
1317631964824862721 2020-10-18 09:01:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd @JoeBiden Because it’s all in public and perfectly normal. If it was not mislabeled it would be fine! BTW-the very first “girl” is a married woman! How many 13 year olds have legally filed rape allegations against Biden, like they have with Trump? How many pics of a Biden w/Epstein? ZERO
1317630777664983040 2020-10-18 08:57:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #BidenCares that his lovely wife Jill doesn’t have disgusting photos like this of her-unlike Trumps Non-American (2nd Non-American) born wife’s does!  https://t.co/QMzd6mwPti
1317629821397196800 2020-10-18 08:53:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Sheepdog1787 Funny because there is no hateful rhetoric in the Democratic Party’s election like what you just said for anyone who has views that aren’t yours!
1317629432346120194 2020-10-18 08:51:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrokenWrd @JoeBiden Funny, I never heard Biden say out loud I just grab em by the pussy! Finally enough, I don’t have actual naked pictures of Jill Biden like I do of birther I don’t care, do you FLOTUS

1317617888468021256 2020-10-18 08:05:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They should be ashamed of themselves

1317489182894399489 2020-10-17 23:34:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> the computer was dropped off at a repair shop in April 2019 -over a year and a half ago and was left apparently without signing ANY FORM or even providing a name. In fact, the shop owner declared that because he is legally blind, he could not identify the person who brought it in
1317488682757218308 2020-10-17 23:32:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no, not the slightest bit fishy:  The story of how a legally blind Wilmington Trump supporter HAPPENED to acquire salacious videos of Hunter Biden

1317308245661372416 2020-10-17 11:35:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They probably wouldn’t stand on a train track with a speeding train headed for the, and just leave it up to God...
1317295536035299328 2020-10-17 10:45:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The staggering hospital bills-how are those going to be paid? If they aren’t, how many will have to close?

1316009428664147969 2020-10-13 21:34:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, and remember Trump, you knew it was deadly and airborne way earlier than they did. Too bad you didn't tell them what you knew! Then, they could have made the accurate calls early on! You lied and people died. End of story!

1315013351186010112 2020-10-11 03:36:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NO WAY! He's going to lose the election anyway, he needs to prosecuted and charged for ALL OF HIS CRIMES!

1314730820326879238 2020-10-10 08:53:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The FBI said there is no organization known as Antifa but recently warNed about the terrorist threat posed by right-wing extremist groups. The Whitmer kidnapping plot proves that the FBI was absolutely correct!

1314643160761593857 2020-10-10 03:05:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Because he wanted to make sure all his rich buddies got secret insider trading information, and he wants to be re-elected. That's it all about corruption with this monster!
1314622278827737089 2020-10-10 01:42:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nice and respectful!

1314561479237144577 2020-10-09 21:40:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow, he's really learning from the Dictators Playbook! This is America-isn't it? This is absurd! The folks who defend him are NUTS! He turns on EVERYONE! Just you wait until it's your turn.
1314560257377656833 2020-10-09 21:36:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He is complicit! He told people to take Michigan back!
1314380647226576896 2020-10-09 09:42:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump and Barr-never seem to know anything relevant! Incompetent or ignorant? But they are experts at the crazy left wing Antifa! Surprised they haven’t blamed them yet!

1314308982102798337 2020-10-09 04:57:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a pathetic old hack! Tired of his appalling behavior and excuses.
1314308536185298954 2020-10-09 04:55:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Her speech was very moving. She had dignity, grace, and continually voiced how we should unite, not divide. Too bad we don't have a President that would grow up and act like this! Too bad for America as he chokes our Democracy.
1314307234302697472 2020-10-09 04:50:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know, I remember an America not too long ago, where if we had a news story that the FBI arrested 6 people in an attempt to kidnap a Governor...it would be HUGE. Scandals are day and night with Trump in office. He's got to go, and then go to jail for the rest of his life!
1314304086108450817 2020-10-09 04:38:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> On Miss Universe Alicia Machado, "She was the worst we ever had, the worst, the absolute worst, she was impossible. She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem." He was probably just pissed she stole his cheeseburgers!
1314303805224292358 2020-10-09 04:37:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe this is my favorite Trump on women regarding Heidi Klum "Sadly, she’s no longer a 10." Trump, you never were a 10 in physique or IQ. Your berating wonderful, beautiful, older, talented, stunning women is pathetic! You are a filthy pig!
1314303288372875264 2020-10-09 04:34:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Cher "cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career."
1314303194147819520 2020-10-09 04:34:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> OrangeGoofyFace on Kristen Stewart, "Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen — but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider."
1314302853335392262 2020-10-09 04:33:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Mr. Perfect himself on Angelina Jolie- is sort of amazing because everyone thinks she's like this great beauty. And I'm not saying she's an unattractive woman, but she's not a beauty, by any stretch of the imagination. I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she's not
1314302544420708353 2020-10-09 04:31:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Rosie-might be my favorite: Can you imagine the parents of Kelli ... when she said, ‘Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a BIG, FAT PIG named Rosie’? Can you imagine the expression on their face?
1314302300047978497 2020-10-09 04:31:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on actress Nicollette Sheridan, "A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10."
1314302146247118848 2020-10-09 04:30:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Princess Di-She had the height, she had the beauty, she had the skin – the whole thing. … She was crazy, but these are minor details.
1314301941917388800 2020-10-09 04:29:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Barbara Res-construction executive Not her.Trump sent back an employee who was supposed to take lunch orders because she wasn't pretty enough (New York Times)
1314301490341781509 2020-10-09 04:27:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Women voters remember: 'Horseface,’ ‘Lowlife,’ ‘Fat, Ugly’: How the President reveals his thoughts on Women
1314300985565679619 2020-10-09 04:25:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why is he not being arrested as a co-conspirator? He knew EXACTLY what would happen. This comes as no surprise at all to any of us, let alone him!
1314300715544850433 2020-10-09 04:24:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy these Trumpers all look alike, don't they?

1314291737528074243 2020-10-09 03:49:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We want him removed and locked up for his like 4000 crimes and counting! Plus the 212,286 premeditated murders!
1314291275504521217 2020-10-09 03:47:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Does someone have the actual number of indictments and convictions? But he only surrounds himself with the very best (dirty) people!
1314290491555491840 2020-10-09 03:44:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's already done, they backed the wrong horse! They are being voted out EVERYWHERE! Selfish, arrogant bigots! Buh Bye GOP, we sure as Hell will NEVER MISS YOU!
1314289601192890368 2020-10-09 03:40:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's helped raise $150,000 MILLION dollars to ensure people can get free COVID tests and food. What planet are you on? What's the unemployment count today? HOW MANY DEAD AMERICANS? Ruthless, crass, selfish, uncaring behavior like this is something you should be VERY ashamed of!
1314286819136110593 2020-10-09 03:29:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a shame! He says when you catch it you get better. Is that why we lost over 212,000 Americans? Complete and utter disrespect you filthy horrific coward! You RUIN everything you touch.
1314284856243818502 2020-10-09 03:21:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PalmerReport I am so sock of this! Like by the end of the day 10 more scandals...it's exhausting!
1314283573986373632 2020-10-09 03:16:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really: Trump: "Excuse me, excuse me. They didn’t put themselves -- and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. end quote....

1314238280968400901 2020-10-09 00:16:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 5000 boats-election won! Your support has dwindled into the smallest group of uneducated voters, or the horrific GOP that caters to your every wish. That's why everyone is not only voting you out, but voting BLUE down the ballot! We are going to make history!
1314237246602649601 2020-10-09 00:12:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha, we kept telling you-every last one of you would be thrown under the bus! The most disloyal, spoiled, dictator in history! Wait til he chants off with their heads!
1314237006248054786 2020-10-09 00:11:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thanks Trumpers-America is no longer a Democracy! Traitors!

1314236137054105603 2020-10-09 00:08:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He also said that either the military or police gave it to Hope Hicks...not surprising at all!
1314046033857519617 2020-10-08 11:32:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really-after the last debate and the spread? These people should be charged with murder-indoors no mask!

1314021102457434112 2020-10-08 09:53:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Biden NEVER called Trump a xenophobe for his travel ban! He tweeted: We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus.

1313868525044457473 2020-10-07 23:47:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump just keeps losing: Federal appeals court rules Trump can't block New York subpoena for his tax returns!
1313860085983182848 2020-10-07 23:13:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously
1313837163855908864 2020-10-07 21:42:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The acting director of Homeland Security recently testified that white supremacist extremists in 2018-19 were the most persistent and lethal threat when referring to domestic violent extremists.

1313829040634187776 2020-10-07 21:10:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So tell the over ONE MILLION DEAD around the globe-that this is a hoax. Tell the exhastead doctors, nurses, lab technician, and all the staff that support them tirelessly, around the world, that this is just a hoax. You are too cowardly to do the right thing and help save lives!

1313661746805174273 2020-10-07 10:05:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You are so messed up. Leaders done do 180,knee jerk reactions, and WTF, they are supposed to work by Twitter? You are ridiculous! Leave us alone-we hate you!
1313656521901977601 2020-10-07 09:44:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> HereTrump-how did this supporter of yours die from Covid-not a real macho man like yourself huh?

1313653517270351873 2020-10-07 09:32:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote, Main Street, or Wall Street
1313652489783316481 2020-10-07 09:28:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It will be so nice to have a leader of the “United” States of AMerica again! I’m sick of a nasty worm of a man using race, religion, our party affiliation, and every other way he can think of to divide us. We need unity, we are ALL in this together!

It's hard to believe how awful it's actually been. The voter turnout is already looking amazing! It's maskers, it's for Biden!!!!! Probably blue down the ballot!

1313612612869947393 2020-10-07 06:50:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You really want to vote for more of this? He has such uncontrolled knee jerk reactions. If you haven't figured this out already...you can't have a President who acts like this! He's a public servant and has a duty to ALL Americans, not just his billionaire elites.
1313608681402101767 2020-10-07 06:34:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ready to vote him out yet? What more does he have to do?
1313548897877479424 2020-10-07 02:37:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @dcopaken @GeorgeTakei I can’t imagine what you’ve been through. Keep speaking out, and hopefully you’ll encourage more people to vote. This man has to go. I never would have imagined our country suffering in depth in so many ways that he simply ignores! I hope each day you’ll feel better.

1313358130923872257 2020-10-06 13:59:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump’s contempt for science and the basic welfare of Americans is so profound that, through an enraging combination of incompetence, indifference, and stupidity, he has failed to meet the pitiless demands of a viral pandemic. The New Yorker.
1313357665213591552 2020-10-06 13:57:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The New Yorker Endorses a Biden Presidency!
1313357493091827713 2020-10-06 13:56:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember-an assistant at Fox accused Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is now one of the Trump campaign’s top fund-raising officials, of sexual harassment—and Fox news allegedly paid the assistant close to $4,000,000! Try to find just one person without scandals in his circle! Sickening!
1313302752987090945 2020-10-06 10:19:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes all the conspiracy theorists-why is hydroxychloroquine not shoeing up on the list of medicines Trump took? Jeez-because it 1. Doesn’t work on COVID  &amp; 2. Could do more harm than good. Again like every time he opens his mouth-he’s either DEAD WRONG or LYING!
1313301613260533762 2020-10-06 10:14:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I can’t even believe how STUPID they are!

1313294866084958208 2020-10-06 09:47:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House!
1313292886172143616 2020-10-06 09:39:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> PS, I’m not a liberal-even though I have no deep hatred for them. I’m sick of our country being treated like a cash register for ONE self inflated, under educated, greedy, childish, racist, uncaring, wannabe dictator.
1313292177301278720 2020-10-06 09:37:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’d say you are stupid if you except people who may not have transportation, or time to go to ONE ballot drop off point in the 1704 square miles of Harris Co. TX. You think elderly people, people recovering from cancer, or during treatment have to go in person during COVID?
1313287550946115585 2020-10-06 09:18:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BrennanCenter I don’t live in TX but this is disgusting.  Can I help in some way?

1313284515545124865 2020-10-06 09:06:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And WHOSE son was getting deposed TODAY on criminal allegations?
1313283830204313602 2020-10-06 09:03:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I assume you are referring to the boring non shocking GOP report that does not support the allegation that Hunter Biden personally accepted money from Baturina, however—only that Baturina wired $3.5 million to a Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC

1313255006527803393 2020-10-06 07:09:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @JoeBiden @gregolear Thank you for sharing something funny, lighthearted and thoughtful-we can all use this now!
1313253064229388289 2020-10-06 07:01:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Dangerous advice from some one who SHOULD know better, but will never learn!
1313223666658947081 2020-10-06 05:04:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really! All those 210,000 cry babies, didn't even enjoy COVID and so they died. They must have been lazy and weak! Sorry, I am sorry not trying to offend anyone, but I am so sick of this fool killing us like it's his mantra!
1313200641926365184 2020-10-06 03:33:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yet again, we have to say-please don’t listen to this fool! He’s been wrong at every turn on this virus. Listen to the CDC!

1313187299027554304 2020-10-06 02:40:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Fng children are locked in cages here! Women forced to have involuntary hysterectomies! Trump calls it a beautiful moment when a reporter is shot by police with rubber bullets! Trump calls an army out to intimidate voters, tried to ban Twitter from making notes on his tweets.
1313186414675230720 2020-10-06 02:36:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @benstracy Your point is completely understandable, not only has Trump approved the shooting of a reporter with rubber bullets, calling it a beautiful moment, the WH is a petri dish of COVID with the admin refusing to follow protocol's that protect reporters lives!
1313184190276538368 2020-10-06 02:28:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The non mask wearing petri dish WH...oh and lets not forget how Trump called it beautiful when a reporter was shot by police with rubber bullets. He's literally APPROVING shooting by police of reporters-WAKE UP! He's insane as it gets!
1313180076322811904 2020-10-06 02:11:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or shot with rubber bullets here in the US, with a president praising and enjoying it? Yeah-that’s Trumps America!
1313166788411232261 2020-10-06 01:18:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who do we call if we are intimidated at the polls?

He sets an appallingly foolish example. Can’t imagine what our allies think of us-or scarier what our enemies Do! We look weak and incompetent
1313155507914452997 2020-10-06 00:34:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He doesn’t care. Trump never did, and never will!
1313154872829718528 2020-10-06 00:31:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Was he “allowed” to wear a mask?
1313154735873167360 2020-10-06 00:31:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But wait, what about their rights? Donut this administration support idiots rights who are too cowardly to wear a mask? How can they make it MANDATORY? What say you fool Trumpers and MAGA? You better through your hissy fits over this!
1313153753684598785 2020-10-06 00:27:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are so disorganized and the world is watching this shit show-can’t they get it together? National Security

1313153101138923527 2020-10-06 00:24:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no, that’s just his normal rage. Just look at every day of his tweets! Nothing new to see here!
1313152743213760514 2020-10-06 00:23:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The world is watching the greatest power on Earth being run by ignorance idiots! This is a worldwide virus, not an American politely stunt! We are losing face as know being a nation of fools!
1313151260686725121 2020-10-06 00:17:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s FINALLY make a difference that spares the middle class! We support people who can’t work or need additional assistance, and we support millionaire! We are taxed to death!
1313150454172471302 2020-10-06 00:14:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s why you quarantine for 14 days! If they’d just simply follow the rules for once!
1313150115570421760 2020-10-06 00:12:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a bad example! Pathetic leadership. The wntire world is watching in horror as our childish leaders STILL refuse to follow what all other countries are doing.
1313149325782982663 2020-10-06 00:09:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I disagree. His behavior is appalling. Not staying in the hospital-and taking a joy ride. That shows what a bad example he continues to set simply for a photo op!

1312895471623512066 2020-10-05 07:20:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> HE HAS COVID-you are supposed to stay away from others so you don’t infect them. Secret Service-you need to stop. He’s harming you, he’s harming us. Quarantine this selfish ignorant pathetic excuse for a man.

1312848839913738240 2020-10-05 04:15:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The doctor treating the US President doesn't know if he was given oxygen yesterday? Why, was he out golfing like the President does, instead of working?
1312842028200361984 2020-10-05 03:48:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Democrat’s USE BLACK PEOPLE TO RIOT IN THE STREETS?

1312814165577302021 2020-10-05 01:57:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You did NOTHING but lie, delay, mock!
1312811903765360640 2020-10-05 01:48:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a monster! What a terrible ineffective leader! Willing to KILL to get donations KNOWING he had COVID!
1312810825409867776 2020-10-05 01:44:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let him-remember his will is so much stronger than the measly 210,000 dead Americans.
1312805842186653697 2020-10-05 01:24:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just stop watching it. Boycott their advertising

1312774475461656581 2020-10-04 23:19:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess all the 210,000 lost Americans just were such suckers without the will to live! These people are so EVIL-even after this-has Drump made one compassionate remark about their suffering?
1312773673334575104 2020-10-04 23:16:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He never works on the weekends-he goes to a mega million dollar resort he owns and golfs-why is he suddenly “working” I call FauxIvanka news!
1312772368729886726 2020-10-04 23:11:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is human garbage-such a Nasty racist!

1312759977040379904 2020-10-04 22:22:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course we all want to get back to normal-but we have no control over COVID right now due to an appalling lack of leadership!
1312759584101142528 2020-10-04 22:20:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s going to be the most amazing sweep of a Presidential election in history! Trump needs to apologize to our nation immediately for mocking masks, holding DEADLY super spreader events non-stop &amp; make his administration actually take immediate action to get COVID under control
1312758431040839680 2020-10-04 22:16:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The VOTE is the ONLY way to save our lives, our economy, and our dignity. These are FAILED LEADERS! This is unacceptable! This is not a political disease, it’s a WORLDWIDE DEADLY PANDEMIC.
1312757949253726208 2020-10-04 22:14:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s a fact that these people are nothing short of monsters!

They should walk out and strike until people wear masks. Every single Doctor Nurse, Lab Technician, or any other health care worker, and support staff should WALK OUT until America masks!
1312569146182434817 2020-10-04 09:44:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Racist GOP, can you spot the ONE black person invited to the white super spreader? Hopefully he's as awesome as Rockstar freaking Jamie Harrison and brought his own #plexiglass

1312503527600648193 2020-10-04 05:23:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Complete failure to all Americans on every level. It was his duty to keep us safe. Instead he mocked masks, pushed unreliable treatments, showed disdain for doctors &amp; science in general. UNFIT TO LEAD

1311157525157425153 2020-09-30 12:14:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think he tried... but against a 200% completely undiplomatic bafoon, what can you expect?
1311156500111536128 2020-09-30 12:10:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Duh caste #TrumpsARacist
1311156218132561921 2020-09-30 12:09:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course! Trump looked about 400 years older than Biden, and ranted like a lunatic!
1311155292525211649 2020-09-30 12:05:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At least he served! BOTH of Joes sons served! Honor that!

1311151248247267328 2020-09-30 11:49:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why did the Trumps STEAL from a CHILDRENS cancer foundation? Why does Ivanka have patents on voting machines and coffins?

1311147181915676672 2020-09-30 11:33:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Eaxctly, and I bet when they count the run-off, Trump got in an extra 17 minutes total-which is fine-because it was just more Trump baseless lies, and ranting. Note to Trump-lies and rants do not help you!
1311044243532779521 2020-09-30 04:44:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ask him about this!
1311042373938556928 2020-09-30 04:37:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BetteMidler We will!
1311041080947814402 2020-09-30 04:32:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> See there are the topics-satisfied? Nothing odd, both candidates should be prepared. Simple-no conspiracy

1311033238375346180 2020-09-30 04:00:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, that’s al, it takes. So no cancer, no heart attacks, poor children filling up Children’s Hospitals with cancer must not have faith!
1311030545854468096 2020-09-30 03:50:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How can you demand one of the MOST CRUCIAL topics not be brought up? He’s not a dictator yet...stand up to him. He made COVID political right from the start!

1311028804207497216 2020-09-30 03:43:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan Done! Y‘all are killing me, but I’d rather eat cat food than keep the status quo!
1311027792625250306 2020-09-30 03:39:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s so funny! They know he’s sharp, so know they come up with crazy conspiracy theories about why he will do so well! It’s called standard preparation, and knowledge of policy. Something Trump knows NOTHING about!
1311027488064143362 2020-09-30 03:38:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow when did we get so disgustingly disrespectful of each other...oh yeah right. Thanks Donne!
1311023878471405569 2020-09-30 03:23:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think they are terrified since Trump refuses to even prep? Ranting obvious lies after his record will not serve Trump well, but that's all he knows....
1310980777052692481 2020-09-30 00:32:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DWCook1962 I can't even look at him or listen to his voice any longer. I know Joe will debate on facts and policy, not lunatic fringe ranting and raving, so he's already won.
1310977627398844416 2020-09-30 00:19:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, who doesn't he ridicule? Oh, Putin? Short list, huh?

1310741981342191616 2020-09-29 08:43:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #RacistTrump Donald Trump took out full-page ads in all four major New York newspapers to argue that perpetrators of crimes such as this one “should be forced to suffer” and “be executed
1310739657383120897 2020-09-29 08:34:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you serious? Then tell Trump he shouldn’t have mocked Elizabeth Warren who has American Indian DNA!
1310737718574448641 2020-09-29 08:26:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The Government Accountability Office CONFIRMED that four trips the president had taken to Mar-a-Lago over ONE MONTH in 2017 had cost at least $13.6 million.

1310677153751724033 2020-09-29 04:25:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @DavidDFletcher2 The money this man born of privilege has blown through, when so many go without, and struggle to even be able to do something nice for their children. He can't possibly realize when 20-30% of our hard won income goes to pay taxes...so much that we go without. Sad.
1310671409606201344 2020-09-29 04:03:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> On Supermodel Heidi Klum-"Sadly, she’s no longer a 10." Lets see, because she's not 18-24? Because she's strong and successful in business? Wow! If he isn't a PIG of the worst order, than who is?
1310670030363860994 2020-09-29 03:57:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump in 2006: I'd have no problem" sleeping with 24-year-olds. He was 60 at the time!
1310669884389552128 2020-09-29 03:57:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> On his relationships: You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.
1310669742445858819 2020-09-29 03:56:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Kristen Stewart: "Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen — but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls, you would reconsider."
1310669507741048833 2020-09-29 03:55:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lindsey Lohan in 2004: I've seen a close-up of her chest. And a lot of freckles. Are you into freckles? She's probably deeply troubled, and therefore great in bed. How come the deeply troubled women — deeply, deeply troubled — they're always the best in bed?" SHE WAS 18 in 2004
1310669038557761544 2020-09-29 03:53:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> On Steffi Graf: "You never get to the face because the body's so good."
1310668643731230720 2020-09-29 03:52:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump: "If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and say, 'Rosie, you're fired.'" Wow!
1310668456463826944 2020-09-29 03:51:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> More lovely remarks from Trump on women: Former Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina: "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" Mirror anyone?
1310666616133296128 2020-09-29 03:44:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no they are not! They insist how wonderful he's been to donate his Presidential paycheck...seems like the least he'd owe America!!! No matter the scandal, the lies, the corruption, they think he's a hardworking Christian!
1310664275502026752 2020-09-29 03:34:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What about the 72 Million dollar refund?
1310664079573487617 2020-09-29 03:34:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, isn't that HIGHLY illegal?
1310660171648172032 2020-09-29 03:18:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, why does Trump with no medical degree want to keep giving us COVID updates?

1310650072628105216 2020-09-29 02:38:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But still not his tax returns. We really think we can trust any "fauxnancial" statement he'd release?
1310649051705208832 2020-09-29 02:34:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When is he testifying before Congress about this latest scandal? He has to go. I think he scares me more than Trump!
1310634185908944896 2020-09-29 01:35:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well to be fair, would you go near that dead squirrel for anything less?

You think he's genius to pay zero for 10 years and exactly $750 for two years in a row? No, that's criminal. That means middle America supports BOTH THE RICH AND THE POOR!

1310593021080211458 2020-09-28 22:51:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I think he did, when he said a mask may work better than a vaccine! It's simple, other countries do it. They don't concern themselves with a Trump election. They do it to SAVE LIVES! No world wide conspiracy here folks. Its so simple...mask, social distance, wash hands.
1310592252012572674 2020-09-28 22:48:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you for helping us stand up for the United States. It will be amazing to be one nation again.

1310589613250142211 2020-09-28 22:38:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, jeez, the world just is so unfair to this Elite? Really? You are a pathetic coward who is going to prison. Hopefully you'll finally find some fairness there!
1310589372157353984 2020-09-28 22:37:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Look folks, that's a huge difference. This is a HUGE scandal alone, I know with Trump we get about 5 jawbreakers a day. We need to start picking each one apart, follow the money, follow the law. Send this corrupt greedy monster to jail, and ALL that had a hand in it!
1310589002324611077 2020-09-28 22:35:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lest we forget his 3400 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST since taking office.

1310587682670759941 2020-09-28 22:30:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Get rid of this fake squatter in our White House. Lets get back to sense America! Lets get back to work! Let this LOSER be on his way to jail, and we will work toward solving the thousands of problems this fraud has created!
1310587150728073216 2020-09-28 22:28:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Frobes good read: The fact is that the disruptive nature of the Trump presidency is unhelpful for business, especially small business. Business hates volatility. It's hard to make significant plans and investment without predictability.
1310586191276896256 2020-09-28 22:24:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's why we are all voting blue down the ballot!

1310584186785456134 2020-09-28 22:16:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, it's a WORLDWIDE pandemic. It didn't start with thousands in Italy dying to make Trump look bad. How pathetic!
1310583217813155847 2020-09-28 22:12:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Love the Palmer Report today: "The release of Donald Trump’s tax returns on Sunday night reveals that he’s the world’s worst businessman, he’s flat broke and deeply in debt, and he’s a tax fraudster." Hate to break it to the Trumpers, but this has been beyond OBVIOUS since 1990!
1310582262933708800 2020-09-28 22:08:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Money just flows out of his chubby little fingers like water. Who blows through this much money, being born into millions? He's what 73 and still can't save a dime, but we are expected to live on next to nothing AND STILL PAY OUR TAXES? #TrumpForPrison2020
1310581216308064258 2020-09-28 22:04:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No wonder our economy, healthcare, our lives, and our constitution are in crisis! Serial Bankruptcy artist-turned serial American con artist, turned serial COVID KILLER! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
1310393037365878784 2020-09-28 09:37:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, AS IF DEMS demoted him!
1310392647899639808 2020-09-28 09:35:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A stable genius whose repeatedly lost more money that's been handed to him than millions of hard working American's will make in a lifetime of hard work!
1310389231857152000 2020-09-28 09:21:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This news comes even as the Trump 2020 campaign is unraveling in a variety of ways.

1310387462682927104 2020-09-28 09:14:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh and uses the DOJ to be his personal attorneys against SEXUAL ASSUALT!
1310386082970767366 2020-09-28 09:09:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, that's why the IRS is auditing a DECADE of his foolish tax returns!
1310385613821161475 2020-09-28 09:07:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Looks like you are SO ON POINT after the Trump Tax Debacle!

1310380955648000001 2020-09-28 08:49:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @permasparks @realDonaldTrump I know, and I understand and I feel what you are going through! We all work so hard, and do the right thing, and still end up struggling!
1310380741197549568 2020-09-28 08:48:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> DUMB DONNIE can't save a DOLLAR if his life depended "Don" it! Imagine if YOU were born into MILLIONS over 70 years ago and BLEW IT AND MESSED IT UP AND ENDED UP BROKE EVEN STEALING UNSPEAKABLE AMOUNTS!
1310380432853274624 2020-09-28 08:46:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am so sorry. People think healthcare means you don't pay. Deductibles not only happen annually, they apply separately to a lot of categories. I had health issues, due to an idiot Dr. prescribing a drug I didn't need -almost killed me. I didn't sue, I work, pay taxes, VOTEBLUE!

1310378472469147649 2020-09-28 08:39:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or maybe as long as you never pay taxes and cheat American's you are in? What country are you from? $750 a year? I pay more than that in taxes every month. I barely make $99,000 a year!
1310378090066046976 2020-09-28 08:37:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @permasparks @realDonaldTrump I am so sorry. I know, medical bills are devastating, and not like we chose them! This man is stealing from us in every way he possibly can! Best of luck and best of health to you!

1310377460614205440 2020-09-28 08:35:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am going to owe MILLIONS in taxes, you got my back Putin?
1310376195847053313 2020-09-28 08:30:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, a broke fool is easily corrupted by foreign powers! Imagine, when is the last time you only paid $750 in taxes! 1929?
1310375817495613444 2020-09-28 08:28:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So well said, he avoids his service, his duty, and HIS TAXES!

1310375277307006976 2020-09-28 08:26:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Glad to see you are so proud of a billionaire evading taxes, while the rest of us struggle to live life without gold toilets! IDIOT!

1310374601659232261 2020-09-28 08:23:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets make this Squatter HOMELESS-SHOW him the same concern he's showed us. Only, remember, we haven't squandered BILLIONS
1310374347757047811 2020-09-28 08:22:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Fake taxpayer! Are we really surprised? How do you piss away so much money AND STILL pay not a dime to the IRS? What a M-0FUR!
1310374154705629184 2020-09-28 08:21:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, I've paid like $25K a year, and I barely get by. I've supported myself since I was 17, never had a dollar hand out, let the millions he received from daddy...and I pay my damn taxes every year!
1310372793066958848 2020-09-28 08:16:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> NO ONE messes with the IRS. TRUMP IS GOING TO PRISON!
1310372679401304064 2020-09-28 08:16:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> #TrumpTaxFraud Who uses "questionable measures"? Oh, that's right, Trump, his family and his cronies! You are pathetic mind numb fools if you vote for this corruPt SOB!
1310372422412120065 2020-09-28 08:15:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> REAlly? For one thing, Joe is under ZERO investigation! Trump and his cronies are under MULTIPLE investigations, MULTIPLE INDICTMENTS. $750 in taxes? Are you just oblivious? Telling us he's making money due to business prowess, but telling IRS he only loses money? Pathetic!
1310372017988927489 2020-09-28 08:13:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, the 298 GOLF trips while President to his OWNED properties? The massive influx in investments OVERSEAS while he's currently President? $750! How INSANE are you?

1310370426183446529 2020-09-28 08:07:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey, if a billionaire with 6 bankRuptcies and three WIVES, TWO of which not even born in the great USA, doesn't pay taxes for 10 years, then F:it! I am not paying taxes for the next 10 YEARS either. I'll go to prison when he does!
1310369923588411395 2020-09-28 08:05:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> SHIT, 10 years TAX FREE FOR ALL AMERICANS!

1310247881341796352 2020-09-28 00:00:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump has done more for women than any other President, but continues to use their looks as a way of either explaining why they got the job they got, or as a way of diminishing their capabilities. If you are a woman with any respect for what RBG fought for-vote him out!
1310247384987906050 2020-09-27 23:58:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump in 1992 on Katarina Witt, a German Olympic figure skater, would be considered attractive only “if you like a woman with a bad complexion who is built like a linebacker.”

1310246578272296961 2020-09-27 23:55:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is such a gentleman! Trump called the 1996 Miss Universe beauty pageant winner Alicia Machado: "Disgusting" and "Miss Piggy."
1310245388352475137 2020-09-27 23:50:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on On Kristen Stewart in 2012 "Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen — but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls, you would reconsider."
1310244732996648961 2020-09-27 23:47:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> On Heidi Klum in 2015:  "Sadly, she's no longer a 10." From a fat lardass orange filthy sexist pig!
1310244501844307970 2020-09-27 23:46:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump on Angelina Jolie: I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she's not — I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. I mean I own a lot of different things. I do understand beauty, and she's not."

I've known Paris Hilton from the time she's 12,  and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, 'Who the hell is that?'"
1310243506364002306 2020-09-27 23:42:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> At least 26 women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct since the 1970s. I like Presidents who don't say "I just grab em by the pussy"
1310243094277877765 2020-09-27 23:41:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump associates charged with crimes: Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and George Papadopoulos, Steve Bannon. Obama associates charged with crimes: ZERO
1310242873275801602 2020-09-27 23:40:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Indictments during the Obama Administration: NONE!
1310242501807214593 2020-09-27 23:38:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is a great reason to vote for Trump: Recent administrations with the MOST criminal indictments:   Trump (Republican) — 215
1310241167318155264 2020-09-27 23:33:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's because EVERYONE knows he's so corruptible: ‘Look, you guys gotta get Doug Collins out of this race’… She said, ‘I have $50 million for this project, and I can either spend my $50 million getting new voters and helping the Trump campaign,
1310240786043240452 2020-09-27 23:32:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's a surprise...how much corruption and greed do we have to have shoved down our throats every single day?

1310239794170134528 2020-09-27 23:28:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, and where is he right this minute? GOLFING at one of his MANY owned properties on the Tax Payer Dollar, or should I say what? $15,000 minimum?
1310237694417567757 2020-09-27 23:19:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sadly, it affects more than Florida. People coming and going...so even states that try their best will keep getting new cases and more deaths. More children, more nurses, more fathers, more loved ones LOST for good.

1310234647243227142 2020-09-27 23:07:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When is the world going to step in? American's are suffering needlessly as we die, fear he will overturn a rightful election, and worry about the threat to our National Security.

1310233277433876482 2020-09-27 23:02:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Tweet, golf, watch TV. Never a more hardworking President for these great United States, unless of course you are a "blue" state...wait til we have .53 cents left to our Country from this pig's waste, lies, theft, deceit, corruption. How many of you are playing golf today?
1310232361947271173 2020-09-27 22:58:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MilesTaylorUSA Thank you for all that you have done, and our doing to save our Democracy. It's already been exhaustingly insane. If we don't vote in this election, we may never have an election again. Chilling to the bone. I thought this was America! Look what he's done to us in 3.5 years!
1310231638312398848 2020-09-27 22:55:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> When all is said and done it will be historic! I can't wait for that fool to FAIL more miserably than any candidate in history!

1310229907105083394 2020-09-27 22:48:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 298th VISIST to one of his golf clubs. How much do we pay for him to golf 298 times? Was this before or after church? Does he pray for the lives lost to COVID, the hurt over racial disparity? The unemployed that may be about to become homeless? No, not at all. He golfs.
1310228248169775104 2020-09-27 22:42:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think about this-If you don't vote in this crucial election, you MAY NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO VOTE again! Trump MAY NEVER LEAVE ever. He will take away your right to vote if he is re-elected. Imagine, you may NEVER be able to vote again in this United States of America! NEVER!
1310226925697339392 2020-09-27 22:36:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Boy, that's a real leader for you. I know the answer-NOTHING BUT KILLED INNOCENT AMERICANS! Knew it was airborne, knew it was 5 times deadlier than the flu! LIED, and KILLED that's what he did folks!
1310076428340400128 2020-09-27 12:38:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are you kidding me? So it’s that obvious that it’s fake news?
1310075177397612544 2020-09-27 12:33:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hope he gets sued along with Fox News for wrongful deaths!
1310074326738231296 2020-09-27 12:30:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How much money does this fool waste?
1310067970526380035 2020-09-27 12:05:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Outstanding!
1310067484473659392 2020-09-27 12:03:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And ask him why birther FLOTUS REFUSED to Pledge her Allegiance on fracking 9/11 of all days? Where exactly does her loyalty lie?

1309921379823878144 2020-09-27 02:22:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously? Name TWO times Trump has been inside a church! Oh, here is his lovely non American born First Lady. Who wouldn't even OPEN HER MOUTH to say the Pledge of Allegiance on 9/11.  https://t.co/UaIoc5vhGq
1309921003393478656 2020-09-27 02:21:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am thinking we should be praying for you. I guess being Christain makes you unaware of what a virus does!
1309919712025993216 2020-09-27 02:16:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd prefer any normal human being to be saying F#ck Fascism! What world are we living in? Antifa stands for Antifascist! DUH!
1309917495554461696 2020-09-27 02:07:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's exactly how I've been describing it! It's not just FL, this affects the entire nation and even the entire world. It's beyond disturbing!

1309659396427874304 2020-09-26 09:01:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Guess we will easily kill 400,000 Americans
1309655581536522240 2020-09-26 08:46:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump spreading again?
1309654629349818369 2020-09-26 08:42:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A protest is now an unlawful assembly?
1309589392911142912 2020-09-26 04:23:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How about who is more of a crybaby? Born into unspeakable wealth, but it's always how they pick on Donny and his gold toilets!
1309578278605336577 2020-09-26 03:39:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SenDuckworth So what will you and the military do if he refuses to leave?

1309502740192780289 2020-09-25 22:39:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So who would you rather trust America?
1309502399275503617 2020-09-25 22:37:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why is the truth too much to ask?

1309310359958884353 2020-09-25 09:54:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So no answer to the criticism of the naked women, once you found out one of them laying in bed naked with another woman snuggled right up,next to her is Melania? The Flotus who REFUSED to say the Pledge on 9/11?

1308573146463821824 2020-09-23 09:05:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> so what countries welcome our FAILED response with open arms?
1308572720066695168 2020-09-23 09:03:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, I wonder why a normal civililized human being not wanting to see more than 200,000 dead American's would block such an ignorant fool? Hmm...NO ONE WAS REQUIRED to wear a mask, BUT they had to sign a waiver! Ha, you really want to keep going here? This is pathetic! DEATHS!
1308572046809591808 2020-09-23 09:01:02 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Are peaceful protests inside the Xtreme building? Yes or no, that's all this question needs? That's your President on the eve of 200,000 DEAD American brothers and sisters! But you go!
1308571684098772992 2020-09-23 08:59:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes I can imagine, then maybe one in SEVEN COVID deaths wouldn't be health care workers! They risk everything for selfish fools! I wish they'd all just walk out, go on strike and stop helping us, we aren't worth it! Like that? Don't mask!
1308571244531515404 2020-09-23 08:57:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio Hugs!
1308571196733227009 2020-09-23 08:57:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha Amen! I just grab em by the pussy and Stormy Daniels and the 6 MISS TEEN freaking contestants who spoke out about him barging in on them undressed PEDO TRUMP! True American's are so DISGUSTED BY YOU!

1308570102384799745 2020-09-23 08:53:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio You know, you can't fix stupid!
1308570019736027136 2020-09-23 08:52:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How many did you see without masks? Show the pictures please? I'll wait while the crickets chirp!
1308569888655581189 2020-09-23 08:52:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio Exactly, I guess the Taliban that Trump wanted at Camp David was super normal not terrorists at all?
1308569415630426112 2020-09-23 08:50:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What questions? Super science I outthink everyone to the point of hero's on the front line dying don't matter? What IS YOUR QUESTION? Why Trump keeps having Super Spreader Rallys? Mocks masks? Is that your Question?
1308569126521241600 2020-09-23 08:49:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> IDK, why don't you ask the world? Is this a hoax? What is your point? An AIRBORNE VIRUS-YOU THINK you can out think this? The 28 year old doctor who just died? The hundreds of doctors, fire fighters and police officers? What is your point? They DIDN'T DIE? WHAT is your point? Sic
1308568692616298497 2020-09-23 08:47:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really, then show me footage of the COVID wards which are in a NEGATIVE PRESSURE! You think thats not important?
1308568303011540992 2020-09-23 08:46:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, since Putin controls Trump and Osama Bin Ladens niece endorses Trump WHICH NOT ONE FREAKING FORMER US PRESIDENT DOES, IDK, what was your moronic question again?
1308567844515393536 2020-09-23 08:44:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, Trump callously calls 200,000 lost American lives virtually nobody! Pig!
1308567605385613312 2020-09-23 08:43:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 15% IN AMERICA! How many deaths will follow when Trump gives himself an ApLUS? Lamas are smarter than Trump! #lamasaresmarterthanTrump!
1308567075745673216 2020-09-23 08:41:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, they don't wear masks?
1308566650149654528 2020-09-23 08:39:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why? I didn't start this virus? But I have enough compassion and caring and will ALWAYS err on the side of caution if it could cost a life. You obviously don't care and won't care!
1308566201354854401 2020-09-23 08:37:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So, what is your scientific COVID background? You are a virologist? Please!
1308566031229689856 2020-09-23 08:37:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are heros, you, NOT! Coward who won't wear a mask, won't endorse social distancing....so you promote DEATH to Americans? Wow! Great job! Science be damned! World deaths, who cares? Great job!
1308565802510094337 2020-09-23 08:36:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, because a simple mask mandate, stay 5 feet or more apart and wash your hands works! So, why won't Trump endorse that? So, all the DR's and Nurses what, should just go on strike because NO ONE has COVID? I am good with that! Are you? One in SEVEN healthcare workers DIES!
1308556679320137729 2020-09-23 07:59:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, it only matters to us decent human beings! But thanks for playing! You can't bring yourself to do the littlest, kind, selfless act, can you?
1308555249154752517 2020-09-23 07:54:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Do you see the deaths in other countries compared to ours? Do you read what those leaders did compared to ours?
1308555111799705602 2020-09-23 07:53:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Okay, have you read those orders? Are you aware that you just can't simply keep people in hospitals? Doctors had to sign off on those orders. Yes, I agree! Mistakes were made, Terrible!! So when do you agree Trump made them too?
1308554383492354049 2020-09-23 07:50:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Lets see, TWO whole people....200,000 people...sure Trump! You suck so bad it's beyond pathetic!
1308551926288654337 2020-09-23 07:41:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or 200,000 DEAD American's with a leader who won't promote what the ENTIRE WORLD does? Yes, it stinks. I want life as normal, but you can't ask a virus to treat you normally. So, you don't like, you don't mock masks, you don't hold indoor rallys PERIOD!
1308550971950280707 2020-09-23 07:37:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Absurd, horrific. If you have ever had hope America, vote. This is not acceptable! 400,000 DEAD AMERICAN'S for Trump.
1308550693524066304 2020-09-23 07:36:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, so freaking cute and sweet! Compared to the vile nonsensible yelling of the Trumpians! You guys are awesome!
1308549905749807104 2020-09-23 07:33:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ahhh which business would that be, Chinese voting machines, or coffins? WAKE UP IDIOTS-they'd kill you or let you die for 24 cents a person! Fools!
1308549665932021760 2020-09-23 07:32:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh, but there must be...he's done more for the blacks than ANY President...unless you count the Central Park 5...
1308549454866329602 2020-09-23 07:31:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, when Trump is removed from office, that will be the Best Thing!!! Until then, 2020 kinda lame...
1308549287157149696 2020-09-23 07:30:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh wow, actual condolences, and not jokes and mask mocking or crowded rallies?!? I remember when America was great, Pre-Trump Traitor!
1308548716803096577 2020-09-23 07:28:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So tell me again, why has no former President supported Trump? He's a selfish, corrupt, greedy, incompetent loser, oh yeah, I remember now!
1308548149905162245 2020-09-23 07:26:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no! Trump-and corrupt Co, get your freaking shit together! Too many amazing American's have died because you lied and are beyond incompetent. So sad.
1308547741790990338 2020-09-23 07:24:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You are such a beautiful sight! True American hero and servant. Thank you for your service!

1308547447224967172 2020-09-23 07:23:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really Trump, mess with the USPS? You lost everyone but the nut jobs when you did that! Go ahead, watch polling places, if they have masks on, they are NOT voting for you! #bidenlandslide2020
1308547092042964992 2020-09-23 07:21:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @SenDuckworth OMG such an adorable picture! I am so glad that you don't tire of this horrific tyranny!

1308544918323945472 2020-09-23 07:13:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Thank you Cindy, and even beyond that, what these Trumpers say about your late husband is horrific. My dad was in Vietnam in the Marines, infantry. I know what this war did to people. For Trump to carelessly belittle a hero...words don't even begin to describe it!
1308544581470912512 2020-09-23 07:11:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No because again, I just want a stable government, and decent diplomatic leadership. Surprises, like the 2-3 scandals a day in the current admin? I am sure it will be fine!
1308532316583723011 2020-09-23 06:23:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How did we get like this? Republican or Democrat, I really don't care. We need to help each other. We need to respect each other. We need to be better than this! Jeez!

1308394004795584513 2020-09-22 21:13:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @MarkLevineNYC Donated!
1308393381207461889 2020-09-22 21:11:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s not innocent at all. He’s corrupt, he lies, cheats, steals. He does anything and will step over anyone to get his way. Letting 200,000 Americans die needlessly.
1308390872707485698 2020-09-22 21:01:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So even more Americans needlessly died? When will the corruption and lack of competence of this administration be enough to shame Trump into resigning? How many more deaths will he joke away?
1308270993052438528 2020-09-22 13:04:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It definitely is. It’s going to be a landslide. See they all have masks on-that’s how you know they are voting for Joe!
1308265451072434176 2020-09-22 12:42:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> True hero’s dying of COVID, Trump the true coward still has no plan!

1308218610679246850 2020-09-22 09:36:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So stupid, after he's on tape admitting it's Airborne. Does he think we have no common sense? Does he think we are as dumb as he is?
1308217328673394689 2020-09-22 09:31:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Nope! Instead he insults her! Look who's laughing now...I don't think he's funny. I think he's the greatest traitor a nation has ever seen!
1308217029145645056 2020-09-22 09:30:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You matter, I promise! I worry about my fellow American's every day. This death is an atrocity. I know it's disheartening listening to Trumps indifference, but we will do better, we will be better! Despite him, we are the UNITED States of America!
1308216589435756545 2020-09-22 09:28:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He thinks we are as dumb as he is apparently.
1308215459821555723 2020-09-22 09:24:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Maybe Trump could focus on those issues too? Doubtful.
1308211946504835073 2020-09-22 09:10:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Here is more of his sound science: August 5, 2020 – The United States recorded 1,380 COVID-19 deaths in a day, but Trump said, “This thing’s going away. It will go away like things go away.” Are you kidding me? AUGUST 5 2020
1308211720716984320 2020-09-22 09:09:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes, and so how is this statement on 8/3/2020 helpful? Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that the pandemic was “extraordinarily widespread.” Trump replied that she was “pathetic.”

1308206826421391361 2020-09-22 08:49:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> According to the New York Times, Trump and his administration had known about the Russian bounties for months, and in response, had done nothing to punish or confront Russia.
1308206578097684480 2020-09-22 08:48:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump spends so much time working for Americans, he tweets a horrific manipulated version of a sweet video... including a fake CNN headline that read, “Terrified toddler runs from racist baby. … Racist baby probably a Trump voter.”

1308205234993401857 2020-09-22 08:43:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump tweeted about two Supreme Court rulings in June: One protecting young immigrants from deportation, the Second defending gay and transgender workers — “shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.”
1308204993414139905 2020-09-22 08:42:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Officials in Tulsa urged the Trump campaign to cancel his rally there, warning that it could be a coronavirus “super spreader.” Trump, though, blamed the media for fomenting opposition to his gatherings, “trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies.” Poor Herman Cain.

1308191753053372416 2020-09-22 07:49:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or how about on the SECOND day of PEACEFUL protests for the killing of George Floyd, Trump condemned people across the country who protested the killing of George Floyd, threatening them with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons.”

1307796878147424258 2020-09-21 05:40:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Dance, then cry from joy, then open the champagne
1307793010630037506 2020-09-21 05:25:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s said NUMROUS TIMES THAT HE‘S FOR ABORTION

1307788222802661376 2020-09-21 05:06:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wasn’t violently attacking a law abiding citizen a beautiful thing? What a horrific monster TRUMP is! Who would ever say such a stupid thing? Oh, guess he must be a Democrat-since he continues to SUPPORT VIOLENCE
1307783468944949249 2020-09-21 04:47:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Was that after he called for the EXECUTION of Five INNOCENT teenagers? So he can judge and call for DEATH,  cheat on all of his wives, run a fraudulent university, but he’s a good man? He’s smart and successful? NO
1307782949375533057 2020-09-21 04:45:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And the Russian bounties? Crickets...
1307753916709433346 2020-09-21 02:50:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Who promotes violence: Trump mocks MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi for getting shot with rubber bullet! He's a greedy hate filled vile person!
1307753134870147072 2020-09-21 02:46:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ABC News/Washington Post poll from Minnesota finds Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with a 57% to 41% lead over President Donald Trump among likely voters.

1307748088958857216 2020-09-21 02:26:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If he's so amazing at finances, then where are the tax returns to prove it that he promised 5 YEARS AGO?

1307716175560953856 2020-09-21 00:20:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s so committed to working for Americans, isn’t he? Now he’s golfing. When did he attend church today for the NOT 7500th time in his life? When is he praying for our heartache at losing over200,000 precious Americans?

1306280351883579392 2020-09-17 01:14:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just look at other countries for results on mask wearing. Maybe it's not 100% perfect, but if we just wear a mask, social distance, and wash our hands, it's the best advice we have right now. Why is this so political? Is it because it takes courage to wear a mask?

1305517176229629952 2020-09-14 22:42:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now wait just a minute, Democrats don't just discard heroine needles in parks anymore! Good Grief! Does she even realize how many AMERICANS she's offending? Who says crap like this about AMERICANS?
1305503898958954496 2020-09-14 21:49:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RepsForBiden Shhhhh
1305503393302171648 2020-09-14 21:47:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, then again for the billionth time, when you need surgery, just remember your OR staff can't breath and wont wear masks! Do your hands stop breathing when you put gloves on? Then, they can't wear gloves either! WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC-why are you so small minded?
1305502181295091712 2020-09-14 21:42:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump the WORLD IS WATCHING! You think this is bad? Your lying to American's about the way COVID spreads through the air and that it's 5 times deadlier than the flu-close to 200,000 deaths? Your lies caused people to die! And you hold an INDOOR RALLY yesterday? Criminal!
1305501640640917508 2020-09-14 21:40:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> See Trump-the world is watching! Next needs action on our human rights in respect to your lies about COVID19 and the fact that still almost an American dies each minute daily and you HOLD IN ILLEGAL INDOOR RALLY? World IS watching!
1305312271523033089 2020-09-14 09:07:51 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’ll be donating in the am!
1305310735669563393 2020-09-14 09:01:45 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Swing state!
1305296071254568960 2020-09-14 08:03:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How come he’s not been arrested yet?
1305295698536128512 2020-09-14 08:02:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is dreadful! Shame on this hate! This is America! We are ONE NATION!
1305290660354940929 2020-09-14 07:41:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @HastyEthno @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Thank you!
1305290034715799552 2020-09-14 07:39:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course! I have a brain, a business, and want a future!
1305285767183433731 2020-09-14 07:22:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @threadreaderapp @family_inmate @josie_huang Glad you are safe and got the truth out!
1305284801742635008 2020-09-14 07:18:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AND holding an INDOOR rally tonight! Murderer
1305282814540222464 2020-09-14 07:10:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Think of the hospital bills!
1305277906676056065 2020-09-14 06:51:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Stop the #TrumpDepression
1305248050525462528 2020-09-14 04:52:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What a hog!
1305245629774471168 2020-09-14 04:43:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And neveR will-he says this ALL THE TIME
1305194630795886593 2020-09-14 01:20:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Blue down the ballot! #VoteBidenHarrisToEndThisNightmare
1305194472465207297 2020-09-14 01:19:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @toni9591 @onlytruthhere @MVRaiderFan @essenviews I’d love to have seen it-this is outrageous!
1305194325702213632 2020-09-14 01:19:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Is this true? What possible reason does the USPS have for doing this-more election fraud?
1305193599970283522 2020-09-14 01:16:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too! THNAK YOU!
1305192258065629184 2020-09-14 01:10:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously THINK about this-it’s inhumane
1305186453790568454 2020-09-14 00:47:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Really-if you are on the fence, let him do this one little thing to get your vote! HE WON'T! Joe has released his. When Trump doesn't and continues to hide and lie, then vote for Joe! Hold him accountable America!
1305185847810158593 2020-09-14 00:45:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hey, if it means his followers are too sick to vote, I really don't care at this point! They don't mask, they still say the virus is fake. I simply became numb and stopped caring about them at some point! So Sad-ALL ON TRUMP!
1305185571363532800 2020-09-14 00:44:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> ABSOLUTELY! I have to vote BLUE down the ballot because I am just sickened of the inaction and corruption from the GOP. Everyone I know, like myself who was a Republican is doing the same! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1305184339181940736 2020-09-14 00:39:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> IT'S ALWAYS POINTLESS! None in Trumps administration answer questions. They campaign! It's sickening! Stop even having them on! Focus on a leader who will answer questions! Have Joe or Kamala on!
1305183268053094400 2020-09-14 00:35:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I can't! I wish I could explain who good friends who are compassionate, generous and hardworking think he's been sent from God! He's not done ONE Christian thing EVER!
1305182146617839618 2020-09-14 00:30:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously!!! The way they cram in and chant and scream! What fools!
1305169132636209153 2020-09-13 23:39:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @PatinkinMandy Thank you!!! It's so important that we not lose our Democracy!
1305168576203153408 2020-09-13 23:36:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BryanRobinAR Don't give up-our very country is at stake here! We are stronger than Trump!
1305166724103372802 2020-09-13 23:29:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Spot on!
1305134623656153088 2020-09-13 21:21:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The Yuge American Fraud
1305133464736456706 2020-09-13 21:17:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Actually you moron, Joe cares and shows it repeatedly! You are such a disgrace-you are your own worst enemy when it comes to getting re-elected! It’s a pleasure watching how stupid you are!
1305126367344955393 2020-09-13 20:49:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But how can that be? Trump said they’d be fine!
1305123794042974208 2020-09-13 20:38:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 68% DISTRUST as he continues to mock Biden for wearing a mask! This is life and death and KILLING small business owners! Vote the sadistic ignorant petulant child out of office!
1305123375447146496 2020-09-13 20:37:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awesome!
1305123326533210112 2020-09-13 20:37:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And Trump STILL refuses to wear a mask or encourage people to do so! Ergo-economy gets worse and worse and more innocent Americans die! No mystery to this folks! Wake up America!
1305122787971956736 2020-09-13 20:34:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Sure, because he always makes great decisions!
1305115407062360064 2020-09-13 20:05:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s sickening!
1304989638331895808 2020-09-13 11:45:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow-supporters with masks=intelligence! OUTSTANDING! See what happens when you don’t support the party of ignorance and hate? Brilliant!
1304988528649084940 2020-09-13 11:41:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We love you for who you are, not your politics Jim! But PS, love that you have enough integrity and common sense to not support such a corrupt person!
1304953446391525376 2020-09-13 09:22:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh no you will not put Americans down you filthy traitor!
1304953011668647936 2020-09-13 09:20:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> he will have his or should I say Putin’s Civil War!
1304952797058789377 2020-09-13 09:19:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> You know-don’t even get me started! How did our fellow Americans become uncaring slobs?
1304952404316577792 2020-09-13 09:17:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ha how F#kng stupid they always make it way too easy!
1304951784868384770 2020-09-13 09:15:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @amrabog @atrupar We all are
1304951485940346880 2020-09-13 09:14:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Believe_Psalm24 @atrupar We do, and we do care! No matter if you are a Republican or Democrat, our hearts, prayers and thoughts are with you all!
1304951088488030210 2020-09-13 09:12:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Disgusting! He’s not a king!
1304950845860179968 2020-09-13 09:11:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s how this President is which is entirely UnAmerican! Vote and get our UNITED country back! Stand up to this hateful bully-or never have the chance again until 2024!
1304950314597060609 2020-09-13 09:09:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Panger2020 @atrupar Me too
1304950229855281152 2020-09-13 09:09:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We deserved better! We work hard, we do for others! This is America not dome filthy Trump reality show! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
1304948942967386113 2020-09-13 09:04:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Any Latino voters out there on the fence-see this?
1304948789753581569 2020-09-13 09:03:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @GileadSlinger10 @atrupar No we still need to fight for our rights, our liberty, and our brainwashed fellow Americans!
1304948516549267456 2020-09-13 09:02:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No it’s part of America and as usual his actions are treason!
1304947860023238656 2020-09-13 08:59:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can you please convince other supporters who to this day and what we’ve learned in just the last week still sick to this corrupt horrific human being like glue?
1304946531200630784 2020-09-13 08:54:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Obviously-photos, Epstein stayed at Mar A Lago-what do we need recordings of this too?
1304945190717853696 2020-09-13 08:49:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> North Carolina Attorney General-SERIOUSLY this is the President directing the voters of your state to vote twice-I surely hope you are doing the necessary thing and starting a Trump illegal activity investigation!
1304943940781604870 2020-09-13 08:44:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Re read Lindsey and you’ll understand! Go Jamie-nice to see a real smile on his face instead of a Lindsey’s dead glazed over eyes!
1304943196502458369 2020-09-13 08:41:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Time for change-vote for Jamie!
1304942893933694976 2020-09-13 08:40:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Jamie-you go get em!
1304942574290038785 2020-09-13 08:38:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Vote Jamie to take honesty back! Look at this pathetic Lindsey Graham-he works for his own interest NOT YOU
1304942147704172545 2020-09-13 08:37:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Pathetic leadership
1304941914618245123 2020-09-13 08:36:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> They are the corrupt party of liars and they are OUT
1304941566050684928 2020-09-13 08:34:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No wonder Lindsey is scared! America is turning BLUE!
1304941296260390912 2020-09-13 08:33:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So Trump has not released his Lindsey
1304911658343694336 2020-09-13 06:35:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Watching, there are like 5 masks in the crowd...he said on February 7th it was airborne, his supporters are showing off that they don't need a mask as part of their support...Herman Cain isn't even a lesson to them!
1304886068714582021 2020-09-13 04:54:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously can you not see the contrast? Even on 9/11 Trump can’t be kind-has to divisive! Guess next he will change our name to what he’s created-The Divided States of America! Pathetic!
1304885530799284225 2020-09-13 04:52:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So kind and down to earth! Love it!
1304884474954608640 2020-09-13 04:47:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Webpuppy45 @MollyJongFast Too funny!
1304882467506212872 2020-09-13 04:39:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AMAZING
1304880524947795971 2020-09-13 04:32:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Out5p0ken @realDonaldTrump Lies about lying-brilliant...and so sad that it’s true!
1304878622692569088 2020-09-13 04:24:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s BEGGING you to please wear a face covering if you can’t be 6 feet apart!
1304848023181299718 2020-09-13 02:23:06 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course, it's because the moron in the White House doesn't know the most basic fundamentals about voting!
1304847775692132352 2020-09-13 02:22:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's a felony to entice voters to commit voter fraud, which any 4th grader knows you can't vote twice in the same election. Too bad the actual President doesn't know such a simple fact! It's a felony-protect yourself and DON'T follow his moronic advice!
1304847417427267584 2020-09-13 02:20:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just a reminder do not commit a felony as the moron in chief directed you to do TWICE! We know he has not the fainest understanding of any laws, so watch what he says! Protect yourself!
1304845591621578753 2020-09-13 02:13:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He would actually be a dedicated hero, with no reason to lie. The thing is when the one common denominator that calls everyone else a liar typically means they are the liar. When he was live on the air on 9/11 he mentioned the height of his building, not the friends he lost!
1304759865244561408 2020-09-12 20:32:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well then it’s certainly odd that in every single interview out there, Richard Alles has ZERO knowledge of Trump or his employees helping!
1304749871153504256 2020-09-12 19:53:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Does anyone not get, that if this were a movie-Trump,would be the bad guy?
1304748048208351232 2020-09-12 19:45:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AMEN!
1304747816955375621 2020-09-12 19:44:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We need to be-Trump is threatening our very existence. This is a WORLD WIDE pandemic-it’s not a game. It’s not just in the states! Nobody is toying with their citizens lives like he is. A huge scandal every hour on his watch, it’s exhausting! He has to go!
1304587687408668672 2020-09-12 09:08:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too, on this day-we Shipley have been able to be hatred tweet free form the a President, just one freaking day, to honor the fallen and the hero’s! He just couldn’t pay us that much respect.
1304586794617516042 2020-09-12 09:05:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @tom36388912 @onlytruthhere @MichaelWitschel @realDonaldTrump We love you too Canada! The unrest and corruption we are enduring is exhausting! He can’t even take today of all days off from spewing his hatred!
1304586192307081216 2020-09-12 09:02:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @angieslife Agreed!
1304542154178670593 2020-09-12 06:07:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Then they just need to keep their own money, and he can run the Red states only! That's basically what he's saying. Look at the AMERICANS he's dismissing!
1304541923731009539 2020-09-12 06:06:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I hope ALL OF you blue state voters vote this dangerous corrupt idiot out of the WH!
1304541703349710851 2020-09-12 06:05:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Here are some colors he may want to know as President: Red White &amp; Blue! This is a sham. They pay in like everyone else!
1304541095775395841 2020-09-12 06:03:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course! I think the blue states should just not give money to the Federal Govt then!
1304476920797634561 2020-09-12 01:48:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> AND it was a lie. Basically every day we were inundated with lies and complete hypocrisy!
1304461496198606849 2020-09-12 00:47:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember that voters-he denies aid to states with Democratic Governors. That's appalling and horrific!
1304458007804346369 2020-09-12 00:33:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's exhausting-the rhetoric. Just these small glimpses of the positive America we yearn for are so touching!
1304456179679203329 2020-09-12 00:26:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @BabosoFabuloso @johnpavlovitz It's exhausting. Never really hated anyone. Had people I didn't like, but what I feel for this foolish greedy corrupt lying egomaniac is pure hatred and it grows every time he speaks more lies and spews hatred!
1304454053313884162 2020-09-12 00:17:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember when both parties got along and respected each other? Vote Nov 3rd!
1304453046295035905 2020-09-12 00:13:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Richard Alles: "I was in a supervisory role with the fire department at the time,"  "I was there for several months I have no knowledge of his being down there." In addition, he said "there would be a record" if Trump had sent a crew of at least 100 workers to help out. USATODAY
1304451901379969026 2020-09-12 00:09:03 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And so is it any wonder that NO PRIOR PRESIDENT has endorsed Trump? He lies, he kills, he cheats, he tweets, he has no respect for our military, or our constitution and can't even recite our pledge of allegiance!
1304449579358842882 2020-09-11 23:59:49 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why would America's first lady REFUSE to pledge her allegiance? Seriously folks-wake up! This is disgusting and will not be tolerated!
1304448780603920386 2020-09-11 23:56:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Did he not remember to brag about his building during this?
1304448465699844099 2020-09-11 23:55:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I remember the shock and disbelief that something this terrible could happen on American soil. Hearing Trump say this while watching the same thing-shock and disbelief folks! You seriously need to add things up and vote him out! He's just horrific!
1304447698301583361 2020-09-11 23:52:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> While we were horrified and saddened, he was glad that his building was the tallest again! Defend this Trumpers. Add it to the 1000's of disgusting things he's done and said. WAKE UP! You are following a little tiny loser!
1304447414053601281 2020-09-11 23:51:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Ready for a #realpresident again!
1304447165692022784 2020-09-11 23:50:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> This is why Trump LYING about COVID is MURDERING people! It has to stop! He has to go, so we can be a normal caring country again!
1304446874653470722 2020-09-11 23:49:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Why would our First Lady NOT pledge her allegiance? This is enough folks! If you don't vote them out, you are not American!
1304446601021325313 2020-09-11 23:47:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's not even human. We all watched in terror, he only cared that he now had the tallest building again! Horrid human being! He NEVER cares about lives lost! He only cares about being the big boy and being able to brag during this heartbreaking time for America!
1304445554597003276 2020-09-11 23:43:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> MORE OF TRUMPS AWFUL TRUTH! If you support Trump after you hear this, I just don't even know what to think! He's actually happy!

1304444648388165634 2020-09-11 23:40:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly what all true patriots were thinking! You think this man cares about you, or any Americans? He's incapable of caring! He's just an idiot who loves being a big shot. He was actually HAPPY this happened because he had the tallest building! WAKE UP AMERICA-he's a monster!
1304141256298299393 2020-09-11 03:34:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes this is how real leaders act Trump! They work hard for the people, not against them! They serve the people, not the other way around! They help people, not cheat them! #TrumpKnew

1304135595896254465 2020-09-11 03:12:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How do your supporters defend these foolish and negligent actions? How does Herman Cain support you? Oh, that's right...

He knew it was airborne, he knew it was 5 times deadlier than the flu. He knew it affected children. HOW DARE HE! This is NOT his call. These were just lies to protect him!
1304083533774893056 2020-09-10 23:45:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> One of the worst cover ups in American History folks!

1303370157058863104 2020-09-09 00:30:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I am voting for Joe Biden so we don't have an idiot tweetstorm of lies every day. I want peace and quiet and dignity restored in America. Trump is way too corrupt and immoral to manage that!
1303369260283105281 2020-09-09 00:27:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Of course, he's sinking so fast! He was bad enough before he messed with our Post Office and calls our military losers! Now, he's past the POINT OF NO RETURN!
1303367874250190849 2020-09-09 00:21:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, because that's a huge change from him funneling it out into his enterprises! Ha! What a LOSER!

1303367171809181697 2020-09-09 00:18:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yeah Trump, see how a leader handles a challenge?
1303367049666846720 2020-09-09 00:18:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or, if we judge by allegations-Trump has a rape allegation against him from a TEENAGER! So, he's guilty too, right? So then VP Mike supporting him every day is supporting a rapist? If you say Kamala visiting Blake is doing that!
1303333952917307398 2020-09-08 22:06:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That's Trumpspeak for being successful! He's great at Bankrupting everything he touches!
1303333585072648195 2020-09-08 22:05:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes he knows some very very good numbers well. More Con from the Don! We are not fooled at all. Another day, another Trump lie, or maybe it's an hourly occurrence. Hard to keep track!

1303305456337575938 2020-09-08 20:13:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Stop this insanity! Where  are  the other nations in the world going to step in? This is a deranged lunatic who hates ALL DEMOCRATS, won’t stand up for unfair treatment by police of black people, puts kids in cages, &amp; lets cronies with no experience  in the highest positions!

1303152322923687940 2020-09-08 10:04:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remind me again who is causing the violence?
1303152067545051136 2020-09-08 10:03:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Remember you can’t support both!
1303151039923789824 2020-09-08 09:59:53 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yep courageous leaders! Something Trump knows nothing about!
1303150772239171584 2020-09-08 09:58:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh yes as usual, he’d rather be petty and careless and let people die than to do the honorable thing!

I’m finding almost no one I know, even Republicans voting for him. I’ve lost some friends for good, but most are actually coming around. Messing w/USPS helped!
1303035895088664576 2020-09-08 02:22:21 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not even close Donny boy-you are such a joke!

1302425529258258432 2020-09-06 09:56:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He needs to be arrested for crimes against humanity! Well, plus for all the women he’s assaulted and the money he’s stolen!

1302404210915446785 2020-09-06 08:32:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd say if you think it's "bad" in those Democratic cities, you ain't seen nothing yet! Bye bye Don the Con! You will ROT in prison for the rest of your pathetic unholy life!

1302329369835253760 2020-09-06 03:34:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As one county had to evict 200 families this week-out on the street, fatty is playing with gold golf clubs! Take a look at some of his properties-gold and filthy money is ALL Trump will ever care about-oh and that dead Susie Squirrel thing on the top of his tangerine head!
1302328749455806465 2020-09-06 03:32:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Right, sinking ships-Trump association. Not really news, is it??
1302328396664496135 2020-09-06 03:31:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Awe do the poor yachts of these elite rich assholes go fall and go down? Sorry I am just too fed up with them to care anymore! Thanks Trump for making me an asshole too!
1302327463041695745 2020-09-06 03:27:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I know, I can't wait until all of his gaudy properties are seized, all the ones he's cheated sue him for his last penny and he rots in jail! Enough said.
1302314369238421504 2020-09-06 02:35:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She served so you can golf! No compassio, no comparison!

1302244926319624199 2020-09-05 21:59:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So he has the power to override the Supreme Court? This President doesn’t understand even the basics of politics and law! What a joke! But at least he will conserve his racist base kicking and screaming until the bitter end!
1302243015101210625 2020-09-05 21:51:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It boggles the mind that the most selfish, self centered, corrupt being in history is actually the President of our beloved country! We have the power America! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1302242821454409729 2020-09-05 21:50:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not okay with any thing this administration does! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1302242561478848514 2020-09-05 21:49:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That sounds all bible-ee to me! Love thy neighbor and all! FREAKS! Ignorant selfish hateful freaks are all Trump has left!
1302242222344220673 2020-09-05 21:48:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But wait, hasn't he done more for the blacks than any other President in history? Oh I see, he thinks he's done too much, so to correct that injustice...he's pulling it all back? Ha! What an idiot! This freak never ceases to amaze me.
1302238378180648963 2020-09-05 21:33:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is a HUGE threat to our national security!
1302238042917400576 2020-09-05 21:31:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> neither of them said this either: I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything… grab them by the pussy.” Trump said
1302237828479438848 2020-09-05 21:31:07 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just a reminder of how Trump is an inhuman swine: I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything… grab them by the pussy.” Trump said!
1302233330310578176 2020-09-05 21:13:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m done with a President who has no understanding of true patriotism, courage, and a willingness to work for and with all Americans, not just the elite! A president who doesn’t even know its a felony to vote twice, that you shouldn’t drink bleach, &amp; supports our troops!

1302228580991107077 2020-09-05 20:54:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Yes please stop syphoning off Illinois of our hard earned money to distribute to all the other Trumps in the administration and your cronies! Lifetime jail sentences are coming for each and everyone of you!

1302075344414011392 2020-09-05 10:45:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan Mine too! 100% agreed!
1302074864703078400 2020-09-05 10:43:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I love it he’s got such an ego, that he can’t even stop belittling people while he’s saying he’d never belittle those people! Just keep talking Trump, the ship is going under!
1302073832627408897 2020-09-05 10:39:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ScottFeinberg Remember when America was normal?

1302061768697688064 2020-09-05 09:51:31 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Duckworth, Moulton, McCain! A coward spoiled, and selfish playboy-has no idea what it means to be a patriot. He will not fight for our country, we are living in an unthinkable nightmare! He should resign ASAP!
1302061183193808896 2020-09-05 09:49:11 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @AmberD1116 @Dano73Nita @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your service! We all know that you fight to save us, our ideals, and our freedoms!

1302057355836829702 2020-09-05 09:33:59 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Wow- but I suppose you love Trump! Your decision
1302043255429890049 2020-09-05 08:37:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> What it looks like when a con man can’t figure out how to hold the con together anymore!

1302012103415431173 2020-09-05 06:34:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s very much good at bankrupting things! Just wait until we find out how much money Americans are missin!
1301871277548998660 2020-09-04 21:14:34 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He's very clearly and repeatedly said flippant remarks about Moulton, McCain and Duckworth. All true American hero's without a doubt!
1301870957099917317 2020-09-04 21:13:18 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Flippant remarks about true American hero's Moulton and Duckworth! Trump mocking Joe yesterday for wearing a mask when we are above SIX MILLION cases! This man only mocks, military or not! He can't back peddle when we see it over and over. Stop lying Trump-you should be ashamed!
1301722322659876872 2020-09-04 11:22:41 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio I’m going to try to get some sleep-it’s more difficult by the day, and just about the only peace we have right now. I wish you some peace and quiet too!
1301721773201817600 2020-09-04 11:20:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio I know! There is so much to worry about. It’s truly a very sad time in our history. I have hope for the election. I can’t even think about him staying in office. Are hospitals going to all file for bankruptcy after no one can pay the COVID bill?
1301720032767078401 2020-09-04 11:13:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Guantaio I’m worried about the sick and dying of COVID, racial inequality,  and Russian bounties. But after all this hatred, no mask, Trumps daily ranting-what trauma is this stress creating in our minds? Or, seriously-heart attack, stroke? We can’t live on fight or flight 24/7!
1301717925439721474 2020-09-04 11:05:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Now I’ll never get that song out of my head!
1301714041770045440 2020-09-04 10:49:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No he most certainly does not-he’s called true America hero’s cowards and RT that Tammy Duckworth hates America! He’s scum!
1301713311839522817 2020-09-04 10:46:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hero vs coward: Trump called Rep. Seth Moulton, another Bronze Star awardee who served as a marine in Iraq, a "coward" after he ended his presidential campaign. You even think it’s a stretch that he will call our American hero’s losers? He’s as UnAmerican as it gets!!
1301712783537590275 2020-09-04 10:44:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @RepSwalwell @therealDavidLuv @realDonaldTrump ero vs coward: Trump called Rep.

You even think it’s a stretch that he will call our American hero’s losers? He’s as UnAmerican as it gets!
1301712239737667585 2020-09-04 10:42:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hero-"So while I would put on my old uniform &amp;  go to war all over again to protect the right of Tucker Carlson &amp; Donald Trump to say offensive things on TV &amp; Twitter, I will also spend every moment I can from now until November fighting to elect leaders who would rather do good”
1301711757388414976 2020-09-04 10:40:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Let’s certainly not forgot Trumps RT of Tuckers degrading remarks about an amazing true hero, still serving our great nation, Sen Tammy Duckworth! Her amputees disgust him as well. You are unconscionable if you support Trump, who not only doesn’t support true hero’s, but mocks!

1301709503612755968 2020-09-04 10:31:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> If you have any doubts: True hero: McCain was offered an early release but refused the offer because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners of war. True COWARD who dodges the war says -“He was a war hero because he was captured, I like people who weren’t captured”.
1301708804829188096 2020-09-04 10:28:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just to be clear Trump has no respect for our Military hero’s on McCain his sickeningly stupid comment: "He was a war hero because he was captured," Trump said. "I like people who weren’t captured
1301683026640941065 2020-09-04 08:46:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I’m just so tired of this! He’d only have been sent by God if God thought we were so terrible, he wanted us all dead!

1301643348307046401 2020-09-04 06:08:52 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It would be like a miracle really if our President knew even one law!

1301639806796148736 2020-09-04 05:54:47 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Without hesitation! I’d never support that business for the rest of my life!

1301596405224570880 2020-09-04 03:02:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just the thought of him losing the election and going to prison!
1301596280741822464 2020-09-04 03:01:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> That’s funny-this Republican administration has defunded, destroyed and dismantled America already!
1301595901706854406 2020-09-04 03:00:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Seriously eat this Trump! Stop tweeting over and over about a hair appointment that was just fine!  https://t.co/jHmCY83kiE
1301595217578151940 2020-09-04 02:57:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Read this BS!
1301578119715880965 2020-09-04 01:49:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> None of them have shame, it would mean they'd have some sort of moral compass to begin with.
1301577679104290821 2020-09-04 01:47:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly-NO MASKS or social distancing of the 3 watching the video on the side of the room. You'd think if they were going to act all indignant about it, they'd at least have thought of that. Ignorance runs rampant in this administration!
1301575726437670914 2020-09-04 01:40:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> As the folks sitting right next to each other mask-less watch on at the nerve!!
1301565034435354624 2020-09-04 00:57:40 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I simply can't believe this. I can understand that it can't be easy to be a police officer, but to protect and serve...this is just too much. Trump has to get off of his ass and start working to stop this! It has to stop!
1301559305058095104 2020-09-04 00:34:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How will we have any money left? None of this is acceptable!
1301556425760538624 2020-09-04 00:23:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I kept thinking that as I watched Governor Cuomo's daily briefings!
1301552607278911489 2020-09-04 00:08:17 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Please stop making masks political! At some point health care workers won't be able to do this, and won't be able to take this exhausting physical and mental toll on their lives. WEAR A MASK, SOCIAL DISTANCE, WASH HANDS!
1301272998830276610 2020-09-03 05:37:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, they think it's sad enough if we made $400,000 a year when a lot of folks barely make $40,000 a year. I am sure $400,000 is barely a monthly allowance to them! Can't they just go away?
1301272035927248901 2020-09-03 05:33:24 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Man, I'll pay more taxes for that kind of raise! Really? They are so out of touch that they think that is the average income? Nice!
1301172297945014273 2020-09-02 22:57:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But when Kaylee says it was taken out of context, and Trump said no it wasn't...then what was the next way to spin it? I can't keep up!
1301160564014698497 2020-09-02 22:10:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> She always masks up! Did I read that number correctly? Wow!
1301159988895911937 2020-09-02 22:08:10 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We don't understand it one bit either. They think he is "saving" America! Funny, I sure liked it a lot better before! Nancy having ice cream and getting her hair done is apparently treason now! Compared to all the Trump BS? Help us-we need outside help!
1301158166814654465 2020-09-02 22:00:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @soloyochapin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You rock! I just want him to confirm that no squirrels were harmed in the making of his hair!
1301156416212918272 2020-09-02 21:53:58 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Also, the way he belittles our allies! It's sort of like the opposite of a good President. Belittles our allies! No response on Russian bounties.
1301156115321942016 2020-09-02 21:52:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well said! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1301155796663906306 2020-09-02 21:51:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, although I don't agree with you because I have both Democratic &amp; Republican friends &amp; peers. I don't pick them because of their political beliefs. Yes, I do not agree with very much of what Trump does. We can both enjoy the freedom of our opinions, because that's American!
1301149933777674242 2020-09-02 21:28:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't really think of ones beliefs as a disease. Liberalism, political doctrine that takes protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual to be the central problem of politics.

1301139394133450752 2020-09-02 20:46:20 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly, maybe if there was something, hmmm like a national mask mandate, we'd all know what was required. The situation would not change if you were in a different jurisdiction. BTY when does Trump wear a mask? She gets her hair done and it's treason!

1301134626715566085 2020-09-02 20:27:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump is a male chauvinist, racist, fascist, narcissist with the maturity of a 13 year old, and the IQ of a trout. He's a threat to our freedom, liberty, lives, livelihood and our National Security. What more could you want in a President? #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1301133525798793222 2020-09-02 20:23:01 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Me too! It's exhausting.

1301007798621409281 2020-09-02 12:03:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @ValerieParlo1 It’s completely exhausting but the list of supporters is getting smaller, and we can work on healing when they are out, and we don’t have to wonder what he will do next!
1301006040587268096 2020-09-02 11:56:26 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @trelliage It’s exhausting. Every day there are 40 new and crazy things He does and says. It will be a breath of fresh air when he’s voted out!
1300995778140344320 2020-09-02 11:15:39 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> He’s the leader of gibberish
1300991145586102274 2020-09-02 10:57:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It’s all falling apart and I’m enjoying every minute!

1300987113505280000 2020-09-02 10:41:13 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Trump
1300978627400605701 2020-09-02 10:07:30 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @mmpadellan Yes
1300971909098745859 2020-09-02 09:40:48 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just be careful-if Cory Booker is let in, it will scare all the women folk who need to be protected. Also, don’t put an airport on campus or the invisible ANTIFA plane will try to land there! No trees-you might see shadows!
1300967491464724480 2020-09-02 09:23:15 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> So how is that different when Trump has been recorded saying I just grab em by the pussy?
1300965918483283971 2020-09-02 09:17:00 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And seriously what would a knife do against multiple armed police.
1300963424462143491 2020-09-02 09:07:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Can he ever open his mouth without offending someone? What he says is always so bizarre, inappropriat, and out of touch!

1300955072516567040 2020-09-02 08:33:54 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> 2021, the year we take it back! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1300954478766624769 2020-09-02 08:31:32 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I'd use the word governs very loosely. He rants and threatens.
1300952718643785736 2020-09-02 08:24:33 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Hilarious! He didn't ruin it once, he ruined it TWICE! Laughingstock!

1300938332059439110 2020-09-02 07:27:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Well, when there is about 53 cents left-we can probably do the math.

1300937766218469376 2020-09-02 07:25:08 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Dispel a Trump statement is one of the nicest things anyone has said about a Trump statement!
1300937125609775111 2020-09-02 07:22:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> How is that even possible? Oh, logically maybe Trumps the most corrupt President in history? Is that MAYBE why NO former President has endorsed him?
1300936886161154048 2020-09-02 07:21:38 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Off with their heads!
1300930201350799363 2020-09-02 06:55:04 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> We know you will Joe. You show strength, compassion, and you are not a coward who will run around blaming all others for their own failures!
1300928650901159938 2020-09-02 06:48:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Actually, you do get it! It's the MAGA's that don't get it! #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1300928541446541320 2020-09-02 06:48:29 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> But he was very proud and very much in the place that he was.
1300928206942470144 2020-09-02 06:47:09 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh and speaking of pressing, can you get the taxes he promised and the new health care plan he promised, and payment from Mexico for the wall?
1300927876800434182 2020-09-02 06:45:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> No, not hypocrites at all. Trump is a leader, we are just playing follow the leader! He attacks others all day, he doesn't do his job, just attack attack attack attack!
1300927607349932035 2020-09-02 06:44:46 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Oh that's right, thats when he was being a pitiful rotten human being making fun of a reporter with a disability. He makes fun of just about everyone, except that poor white boy who murdered people with his big ass gun!

1300920859796922368 2020-09-02 06:17:57 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Michael19934286 It's so frustrating. One of my amazing, kind, charitable, supportive friends thinks that God made Trump the President in order to save America. I've never chosen friends based on their politics, but I've just stopped talking to most of them. We have NOTHING in common. VoteJoe!
1300917901613039617 2020-09-02 06:06:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> The entire Trump administration is a "dark shadow" covering the world. It gets darker and larger daily!
1300845443442671616 2020-09-02 01:18:16 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> From those Russian bounties?
1300845101355339778 2020-09-02 01:16:55 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Apparently no actual REAL past Presidents do, since none will endorse him!
1300844483593076736 2020-09-02 01:14:28 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Fabulous job Donnie!
1300833148536868866 2020-09-02 00:29:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Not to mention the trail of arrests...all leading to Trump!
1300831709475332096 2020-09-02 00:23:42 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or as Biden would say, Don't Jump!
1300831182033125376 2020-09-02 00:21:36 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Do we have enough booze and anxiety meds to deal with his speeches leading up to Nov 3rd? They get more upsetting, confusing, and in general bat shit crazy by the minute!
1300830801190432768 2020-09-02 00:20:05 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I don't play, but how sweet and cute! Trump will be sending the Thugs for the planes!
1300830367461421056 2020-09-02 00:18:22 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Just every debate question that Joe answers after Donny, that's a lie. Done, end of story!
1300830118210940931 2020-09-02 00:17:23 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> I sure hope the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and Homeland Security are spending their time on this "investigation" he refers to. Nothing much else to do or see here folks! Trumps America! I need meds! This is just all too much!
1300829319187628033 2020-09-02 00:14:12 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> A lie promoted by our President? Why do we have to put up with this insanity folks? His little band of merry makers were now using "spray paint"...heard those words before he left for WI...guess next he will say they were never even there...
1300826355278450688 2020-09-02 00:02:25 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Spot on-Evil Fuels His Crazy! Can we please not have an absolute bat shit crazy President? This is just getting way out of control here folks! Maybe he should just golf and stop even trying...real folks trying to live and work here...no time for this shit!
1300825224833839106 2020-09-01 23:57:56 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Exactly! "They" have so much power and remain hidden, but mess up that badly? This all has to be some really stupid dream we are waking up from, right? Nov 3, get reality back, get the greasy orange stain out!
1300820771430895617 2020-09-01 23:40:14 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> @Alyssa_Milano Oh sure you Dirty Dem! SOOOO kidding! I imagine you'll get a lot of replies like that!

1300817848185622528 2020-09-01 23:28:37 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or the ones that will never live to be Vets because of the Russian bounties...
1300817396706541571 2020-09-01 23:26:50 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> It's only going to get worse. Every time he opens his mouth, it gets more insane! He is such a belittling oompah loompah!
1300816832576839681 2020-09-01 23:24:35 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Or his taxes, or all the actual PROOF of Obamagate (that is still coming) or the Health Care Plan he already released, oh wait...or anything he's promised to deliver?
1300816512056471552 2020-09-01 23:23:19 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Doesn't it take way more time to make a completely separate trip to get a "head start" on a physical? Really? Maybe if he didn't golf and tweet so much...
1300635927971233792 2020-09-01 11:25:44 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> Please let me wale up and be No 3Rd
1300633339334987780 2020-09-01 11:15:27 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> And the Trump Presidency does? We already feel so much better with the compassionate speeches Joe has made! Nov 3 can’t get her soon enough!

1300610508207382528 2020-09-01 09:44:43 +0800 <TIREDOFTRUMP8> WTF? He’s defending him? He‘s not old enough to vote yet...this is so insane! Has he considered how freaking VIOLENT it is to shoot someone in the head? This kids the victim in Trumps America!
