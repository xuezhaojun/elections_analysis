1342337517559930880 2020-12-25 13:12:58 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> For as in the day of Midian’s defeat, You have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. Every warrior’s boot that tramped in battle, every cloak rolled in blood, will be burned, will be fuel for the fire.  Isaiah 9: 5-6

1341588789488197632 2020-12-23 11:37:47 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Some people tried to save the country from itself. But there were too many that wanted this. Too many that didn't care.

It's all a consequence of our unseriousness in 2016. The world is suffering because of our selfish actions. And we'll forget about this in a flash.

1340348589348950021 2020-12-20 01:29:40 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> After cutting the tree, Ed and Dad carried the tree, I carried the saw and Greg, the youngest, carried the pad. For some reason, I decided to go into dickish older brother mode and mocked Greg for carrying the only thing that wouldn't be able to hurt someone...

Maybe more people should have been similarly extreme.

1334652545839599616 2020-12-04 08:15:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> I think Trump should stick around to make Republicans' lives miserable. Does that make me an accelerationist?

1334577088758738949 2020-12-04 03:15:47 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> "feel" is the operative word. Their inability to deal with their feelings has caused so much pain to other people.
1334570763702202370 2020-12-04 02:50:39 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @lauraintheory The spirit of such words: "Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business."

1331669510152220672 2020-11-26 02:42:07 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @bluecelt Sometimes yes. Mostly to look for dogs. Her lungs are much stronger now. In 2014 we made a fruitless trip to the park in 10° weather because she wanted to see if the there any dogs.  Spoiler alert: there were no dogs out that day
1331664988730257419 2020-11-26 02:24:09 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The Wyndham was one of the newest places in town having been built only three years before, it was a lot of fun walking through the fancy hallways and pretending to stay there. It was a strange hobby but it worked &amp; I miss those days. Fin.
1331664453436399617 2020-11-26 02:22:01 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The only place in Gettysburg that had a lot of space to walk around indoors for free was the many hotels. So she and I became hotel walkers, taking the elevator up to the top floor and walking the Halls and down the stairs.
1331664017211920386 2020-11-26 02:20:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> In the winter of '07-'08, my four year old special needs daughter had lots of energy to burn. I did not want to take her out into the cold for extended periods of time because she had been hospitalized the last few winters with her weaker lungs.
1331663521235542017 2020-11-26 02:18:19 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> So the fiasco at the Wyndham is back on, so I'm going to tell my cute story about the Wyndham:

1331309942985416707 2020-11-25 02:53:19 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Perhaps we can look on Thanksgiving as a Christmas prelude; if we are to understand the truest form of Christmas spirit, generosity &amp; charity, then we have to take stock and inventory in ourselves first and count everything we have to be thankful for. 2/2

1330379991369060352 2020-11-22 13:18:01 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> This is a well-meaning but rather condescending collection of tweets (not just the original post). Tweet after tweet of people turning their interactions with support staff into their personal Hallmark stories. Custodians are people, not magic NPCs to inspire you.

1330192557540831235 2020-11-22 00:53:14 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @NickSabatoMDR Too true. Hence the country's bafflement for how South Dakotans have allowed this to happen to themselves despite having examples on the coasts of the devastating effects of the disease

1329809410005344262 2020-11-20 23:30:44 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> There's a reason I don't talk much at work.
1329808530556284936 2020-11-20 23:27:14 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Middle-aged guy at work brags that he's having Thanksgiving without any precaution. Then an old timer says Americans don't have any sense of shared sacrifice anymore...but then ruins his point by saying BLM disrupted our colorblind society &amp; the civil war wasn't about slavery 😑

1329790766982590465 2020-11-20 22:16:39 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> It's remarkably striking as time went on that Trump picked increasingly evil people for the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh was worse than Gorsuch &amp; Barrett is worse than Kavanaugh.

You tried to control them, now they control you. Even your Kelly Loeffler shared a stage with Marjorie Taylor Greene and took her endorsement (see your pinned tweet).   May Trump's fate be your own.

1326702260655681536 2020-11-12 09:44:02 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Anti-Trump conservatives get reasonably salty when you tell them that Trump has been more successful at conservatism than they have.   I don't know which leader of conservatism they're following but whoever that person is, they're not doing a very good job.
1326678768258256896 2020-11-12 08:10:41 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @GhoulLenny Okay then. Build some sort of conservative movement that dwarfs Donald Trump's and we'll talk.
1326677232337772544 2020-11-12 08:04:35 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @GhoulLenny I don't think it's unreasonable to say that the Conservative Political Action Convention knows quite a little bit about conservatives actually want.
1326674140619825152 2020-11-12 07:52:18 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @GhoulLenny I didn't invite him to CPAC,  I didn't I didn't nominate him to the Republican nomination for president twice.  Conservatives did.
1326671634690928643 2020-11-12 07:42:20 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Anti-Trump conservatives, you have to deal with the fact that Trump has been a lot more successful at conservatism than you have. So what's it going to be? Surrender to him or walk away. You played cute games where you try to have it both ways but you can't anymore.

1326667411920211973 2020-11-12 07:25:33 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Abandoning conservatism or pitching a fruitless effort to save it from itself is a hell of a lot more honorable than making peace with Trumpism.

1326163987503980544 2020-11-10 22:05:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Lovely to check up on an academic I admired to find that he not only defended Trump in writing but also participated in a Trump conference on history just a few months ago. It's amazing how much has been revealed these last five years.

1326004162350428160 2020-11-10 11:30:02 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> It would be nice if the president's own party would stop treating him like a spoiled child

1324729585855041536 2020-11-06 23:05:20 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> From 1960 to 1980 there were 5 different presidents. It was a volatile time of changes. From 1992 to 2016 there were only 3 different presidents. We didn't throw out incumbents. Until now. Trump truly is a loser.

1324007709650391044 2020-11-04 23:16:51 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @GoldenGirlsRu Nope! We made him president and almost gave him a second term. We cannot escape the consequences for those foolish actions

1324002816550207488 2020-11-04 22:57:24 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @JurisDudence Because GOP politics is amazingly messy
1324002165988462593 2020-11-04 22:54:49 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @JurisDudence For Trump.
1324001523525951490 2020-11-04 22:52:16 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Hang him around their necks like a flaming tire.

1323993091926335488 2020-11-04 22:18:46 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @DorMouseSez @ContentedIndie They like Trump more than they want to admit

1323987723431088129 2020-11-04 21:57:26 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @kcbrennanjr Maybe GOP needs to bridge the sub/urban gap

1323902351648894976 2020-11-04 16:18:12 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @AtticusGF Trump voters are liars
1323896510283730944 2020-11-04 15:54:59 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> We knew this could happen and we walked right into it.
1323896179353149442 2020-11-04 15:53:40 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @mark_dow @FlyingMezerkis And we chose this anyway. What does that say about us?

1323891492113567744 2020-11-04 15:35:03 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @jcredfearn Yes, we underestimated the amount of selfish voters
1323890797394145281 2020-11-04 15:32:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Remember, this shmuck was the most honored guest of the March for Life just 9 months ago.
1323889651053142019 2020-11-04 15:27:44 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> We deserve this. We could have ended it tonight but nooooooo
1323886103615647744 2020-11-04 15:13:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @VirNefarius @VitruvianMonkey I think so

1323879890131800064 2020-11-04 14:48:56 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @TxsleuthUSA @djrothkopf Because I want them to realize the damage they have done. They were so ready to move on from Trump and pretend this never happened. Now they can't.

Throwing Kevin Conroy (who is great) into the discussion of the Batman actors is unfair because he didn't have to embody the part, only the voice.

1319459537779294208 2020-10-23 10:04:02 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> So we're about an hour into the debate... How's Trump doing? How's Biden doing? How are you doing?
1319458812777070593 2020-10-23 10:01:09 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @WMNarmer @benshapiro I could not believe it the other day when he said he was voting for Trump. I really thought he was going to keep plausible deniability up until election day
1319458633617473538 2020-10-23 10:00:27 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @BlackPeter79 @RTodKelly Yup.

1319453260198125568 2020-10-23 09:39:06 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> All the people that get paid to say good things about Trump (or just his policies) seem to be saying he's winning.   Everyone else, in world of reality, seems to be saying otherwise

1319385600869490689 2020-10-23 05:10:14 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> TFW the 2016 Libertarian Party VP candidate has more political courage than David French or Mia Love
1319384925250985984 2020-10-23 05:07:33 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @uezelal @SykesCharlie @JVLast I wonder what kind of person is on political Twitter and needs to be told to vote 😊
1319384489076862978 2020-10-23 05:05:49 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @govkristinoem Why are you doing this?

1319335982014005250 2020-10-23 01:53:04 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Jackie Robinson left the Republican Party after he was harassed by Goldwater goons at the 1964 GOP convention.

1319310278962577410 2020-10-23 00:10:56 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> A literal Trump 2020 campaign pitch: Bullying works. Cruelty works.  Our children are watching.

1318285164380901379 2020-10-20 04:17:30 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Way too much talk out there about people playing into Trump's hands.  Trump is easily playing into Biden's hands. That's the real story.

1318255794790477825 2020-10-20 02:20:48 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If Trump loses, who will conservatives blame?
1318247728682536962 2020-10-20 01:48:45 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Is Trump working for the Biden campaign?

1317855979803938817 2020-10-18 23:52:04 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Forgiving your parents for voting for Trump is a good idea but only after he's beaten.

1317850878657892353 2020-10-18 23:31:48 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @avotoasted Twix is wildly underrated
1317830702247923712 2020-10-18 22:11:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> This poll is open until 7PM and it's stayed consistently around 85% vs 15%. I really do believe that there's some recency bias at play here but I also really do believe that this year is objectively crazier. What do you think?
1317817888712044546 2020-10-18 21:20:43 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @AuhsdBond It's the moment in Mass where the priest, Bishop or Pope holds up the blessed unleavened bread (aka the Host) in the air to God and to show the people there. It's the most sacred part of the Mass so the meme is to put something very important or sacred to you in his hands

1317119221558595587 2020-10-16 23:04:27 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @GoldenGirlsRu That's what's wrong with the electoral college

1317116372586037250 2020-10-16 22:53:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @bruce4nv He literally can't commit, even in the two word headline!
1317115113745321986 2020-10-16 22:48:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @bernybelvedere God sent Biden to reverse his reversal  He works in mysterious ways
1317114121075216384 2020-10-16 22:44:11 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @deb6246 Of course not, that would make him pro-Trump.
1317113079386247169 2020-10-16 22:40:03 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> I think Charles just won the tourney  https://t.co/qc4rrsSY1y

1317110562241863680 2020-10-16 22:30:03 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Lcmwriter100 Of course not, none of them were going to win.
1317110424144384000 2020-10-16 22:29:30 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @ArTaggart But he's still against Trump! 😉

1317099061967835138 2020-10-16 21:44:21 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @FlintCruneck Is he pro-Trump or too slippery to be that honest?
1317098760737067008 2020-10-16 21:43:09 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @orangebloood Greg! He might actually be pro-Trump tho

1317096966975881218 2020-10-16 21:36:02 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> 48 names for a anti-anti-Trump bracket tournament. I'd need 16 more, more lefties if I can get em. Any names on here not appropriate? Any one of these too niche or actually pro-Trump?  https://t.co/8rcOBRDEPx

1316930249070989315 2020-10-16 10:33:33 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Trump won't fully denounce white supremacists or q weirdos because he desperately needs their votes. And that's terrible.
1316928324577431552 2020-10-16 10:25:54 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @CalebJHull Was Donald tricked into walking into this trap???
1316926441662152704 2020-10-16 10:18:25 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Today, my household put up the first political yard sign since Bush 2004...I put a "Pennsylvania for Biden/Harris" sign in my yard. I am very proud.

1316469425629954051 2020-10-15 04:02:24 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Jhimmibhob @HotlineJosh The fact that you think she is "good" says it all. You don't oppose Trump nearly as much as you think you do. His influence will live on because of people like you.
1316451643827904513 2020-10-15 02:51:45 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Jhimmibhob @HotlineJosh Why would you assume I oppose that?

1316404508000387073 2020-10-14 23:44:26 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Jhimmibhob @HotlineJosh So you're reaping the rewards without even having the courage to claim them.
1316403762534195200 2020-10-14 23:41:29 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> When you reward evil, you become that evil
1316399385996079104 2020-10-14 23:24:05 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @peterawolf For real. Especially for the townhall, we don't need the candidates together.
1316396354948739074 2020-10-14 23:12:03 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> On a car trip back from Philly, I played a game with my daughter where I gave her common words (or acronyms) and she turned them into her own acronyms. On a lark, I smirked and gave her the acronym MILF. This was her answer:   "Milk is lame, Frank"
1316391155588902914 2020-10-14 22:51:23 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @torriangray You came back...for this?
1316375677562748928 2020-10-14 21:49:53 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @djdunclive Can we tax this particular family over 50%?

1316370768679362560 2020-10-14 21:30:22 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> I think it's unfair to blame NBC for airing The Apprentice, it was a dumb reality show that got ratings. They didn't know that he was gonna run for president &amp; didn't know that the American voters were dumb enough to vote for him. It IS fair to blame them for this townhall.

1315050072128868352 2020-10-11 06:02:24 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Guys, they've already announced this year's recipient. You can stop nominating him

1315041165230649345 2020-10-11 05:27:00 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The conservatwitter freak-out over Biden's non-answer on expanding the court is proof positive he's doing the right thing

1314932768426594305 2020-10-10 22:16:16 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @MooreHomes1 @scottbraddock Because the onus is not on her, it's on the current senate who is going to violate their own rule about confirming SC justices in an election year. If they would but stand down, we wouldn't need to talk about expanding the court

1314728897725059072 2020-10-10 08:46:10 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @JonnyMicro When Frodo falls and Galadriel comes to him in a dream, encourages him and pulls him up for real. When he decides to take her hand, her smile is so genuinely happy, of deep divine joy

1314601020216016898 2020-10-10 00:18:01 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @ebvwilkerson @roddreher There's nothing wrong with signaling virtue. With a vice signaling administration like this, virtue signaling is a good work.

1314597476603777024 2020-10-10 00:03:57 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @NateWatkins @JonahDispatch @AlbertoCairo Trump is both cause and symptom. Blaming him as merely a symptom lets him off the hook. Blaming him as the whole cause lets the GOP off the hook.  Blame both.

1314565146031816713 2020-10-09 21:55:28 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Biden's genius in refusing to answer the court-packing question throws the ball back into the Republican's court (pun not intended) where it belongs. They are the ones who are threatening the legitimacy of the courts
1314558647121448965 2020-10-09 21:29:39 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> So vote for Trump already

1314554175590723591 2020-10-09 21:11:53 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Conservatives need to examine their consciences: -why did Trump pick you guys after being a NY liberal for so long? -why did your friends and family go along with him? -what is insufficient in your philosophy that you needed Donald Trump to implement it?
1314546232505896961 2020-10-09 20:40:19 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @NOLA_JT And if he doesn't, what will you think of him?

1314261829703610374 2020-10-09 01:50:12 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @AlexanderOtxa I do believe he swatted it away, unlike Pence, who felt as at one with his fellow creature

1314236819370893318 2020-10-09 00:10:49 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Some people who knew better called Whitmer a tyrant and it has colored the way I think about them. These few years certainly have been illuminating.

1313542311213752327 2020-10-07 02:11:06 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @andrewtwalk Christian Trump voters have spat in the face of Christ as He suffered. Repent.

1313503048707309568 2020-10-06 23:35:05 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The other week we visited the ironworks erected by Thaddeus Stevens, destroyed by Confederate Gen. Early on the way to Gettysburg in revenge for Stevens' antislavery efforts over the years. Stevens helped the unemployed workers for as long as he could to get them working again  https://t.co/7povi04EZD
1313499971199676418 2020-10-06 23:22:51 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @CroyEaston @benshapiro I thought Trump was the media manipulator... what happened?

1313479014804267008 2020-10-06 21:59:35 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Calling people who die of Covid weak, unlike our Very Strong President, is probably a winning argument.  I recommend Republicans up and down the ballot to amplify this message.
1313459401286660096 2020-10-06 20:41:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If you're a fan of the Electoral College, you better pray that Biden wins because Trump ain't winning the popular vote even if he squeaks by in the EC tallies.

1313142562815959040 2020-10-05 23:42:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Donald Trump should suspend his campaign before anyone else gets hurt as a result of his reckless actions.

However, when she caught Covid, she actually did stay in quarantine the whole time, something that Donald Trump couldn't manage to do.  My 18 yo is more mature than our president.

1312240740584521728 2020-10-03 11:59:07 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Biden suspend his campaign?  The candidate and his campaign manager of the Trump campaign are both (self)infected. They can suspend THEIR campaign
1312238005499891712 2020-10-03 11:48:15 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @ChrissieKeffler Because we shouldn't reward evil deeds

1312229803165089792 2020-10-03 11:15:39 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If Amy Coney Barrett really was the honorable &amp; wise person that conservatives say she is, she should step down on account of all the damage that has been done in her name.

1312227332300496896 2020-10-03 11:05:50 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> This was one of the craziest, if not the craziest, days of watching politics I've ever seen
1312225261082079234 2020-10-03 10:57:36 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The arrogance that they thought they could ram this supreme court nomination through before the election.  T h e   A r r o g a n c e
1312218814906499072 2020-10-03 10:31:59 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Perhaps conservatives shouldn't have been so quick to attempt to rush RBG's replacement. God was not pleased.

1312138381652942848 2020-10-03 05:12:23 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> My daughter actually told me about Trump contracting Covid before I could tell her (so proud of her!). I made sure to tell her that it's okay to have mixed feelings about this.
1312137183038377984 2020-10-03 05:07:37 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> I'm glad to see people empathetic to Donald Trump  I'm glad to see people refusing empathy for Donald Trump  The debate on whether it is wise to be kind to the cruel is timeless and both sides have good points
1312130507673489409 2020-10-03 04:41:05 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Remember when the movie Cuties was going to win the election for Trump?

1312076381002649600 2020-10-03 01:06:01 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> The arrogance of the GOP to have this event in the first place is enraging.   They felt they deserved a win after several weeks of bad press and look what they did.

1310193157360017408 2020-09-27 20:22:45 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @TNMouth If you accept his gift, you are justifying his election. You have to reject him wholesale.

1309991496720973826 2020-09-27 07:01:25 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Puddleglummy It will make it worse because Trumpism, treating people like trash, cheating, lying, etc. has been rewarded. Trumpism gets results.

I'm tolerating someone I owe my daughter's life to while they have gone Qanon. Meanwhile someone I used to be flirty with got deleted because she put up a mild Confederate flag meme.

1309910176347160579 2020-09-27 01:38:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> GWB is more likely to help Trump with ACB (like he did with Kavanaugh, both were on Bush's 2000 legal team) than endorse Biden. His silence on the presidential race is telling.

1309854880702631940 2020-09-26 21:58:34 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Any judge that would accept a nomination from Trump, especially at this stage, would be unwise &amp; dishonorable. If ACB accepts Trump's invite, she will have exposed her way of thinking more in that moment than any answer she may give at her confirmation hearing. A tainted "judge".

1309703237935738886 2020-09-26 11:55:59 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If you think Twitter comments about ACB are going to erase Biden's lead &amp; reelect Trump, go to bed  You are officially Too Online. Stop it before you hurt yourselves.

They are upset that you're making an issue out of it.  Guess what, buckos, that's called politics. Get your candidate to shut up once in a while.

1308894444549214211 2020-09-24 06:22:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @colleen_eileen Well how cool is that? It's lovely here and the people are too ..when they don't get political.

1308823825593905154 2020-09-24 01:41:31 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @jr_bohl @LesserFrederick In which French himself questions Obama's commitment to his faith
1308808777743904769 2020-09-24 00:41:43 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @jr_bohl @LesserFrederick Why was it a question?  If French felt compelled to write about it, a one word post on the Corner should have covered it:  "Yes"

1308798582368206850 2020-09-24 00:01:12 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @TheDrive4Five No "media". Pick a single person. Murdoch is acceptable.

1308790384638808065 2020-09-23 23:28:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Who is the single most guilty/responsible person for all this after Donald Trump? Nominate others in the comments

1308636313139245056 2020-09-23 13:16:24 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @stephenfhayes Because he's one of you guys?

1308630272880128001 2020-09-23 12:52:24 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @AliVelshi Because his name is Ali Velshi and he's a journalist. That's all they need.

1308591151251947520 2020-09-23 10:16:57 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @adeleshiv @stephenfhayes And you're talking to a man who hired Ayaan Hirsi Ali today

We don't know if he mocked the man for his disability and really it doesn't matter. If you claim that he mocked others like that ,how is that any better?   " He's not just horrible to this one guy, he's horrible like that to everybody!"
1308575958861885441 2020-09-23 09:16:35 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @colleen_eileen @gina_goldberg "Leo is suing him for the rights"☺️

He still mocked the man it does not make it any better if he didn't make fun of his disability. He's a cruel, mocking man.   You need to try a little harder than that if you want to convince me.
1308570703814373382 2020-09-23 08:55:42 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Chartoc Every single one of us is important. Who the fuck told you you were unimportant? You are beloved, sir. You are a lot of fun online and I can only imagine how wonderful you are in person.

As I said before you have almost 50 years worth of failure and now you're doubling down on voting for a jerk? I was born into the pro-life movement; I've seen it deteriorate into this mess. Clean up your act if you want to win.
1308545035554742272 2020-09-23 07:13:42 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @kristiewarde I do and he did it anyway.

1308539246337298433 2020-09-23 06:50:42 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @1renist @ShayKhatiri How many years of failure before you change your strategy?

1308534108537196544 2020-09-23 06:30:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Rikki5582 Pete, can you play a stiff dorky guy?  "You know I can!"  Yah, but this time you have to be evil  "Oh. That's gonna be trickier. But I know can do it!"
1308532055874170881 2020-09-23 06:22:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If Trump's nominee (whoever it might be) really was wise and honorable, they would refuse the nomination.

1308498636700086276 2020-09-23 04:09:20 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Kinda hard to say that you are against Trump if his press secretary is using your quotes to help lie for him.  https://t.co/2HSHzmucAv
1308464442426916865 2020-09-23 01:53:27 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @jcredfearn There's like two or three. And she was pissed. But I touched a nerve
1308461434926399491 2020-09-23 01:41:30 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz Your desperation to free yourself from the man you're chained to, who gave you those justices, is hilarious. He's your forever problem and you don't know how to deal with it.
1308460103763398658 2020-09-23 01:36:13 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz If R v W is overturned you owe this guy; the most popular conservative in a few generations:  https://t.co/2ccUh5gSAc
1308459311484399616 2020-09-23 01:33:04 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz Because you accepted Trump's gift.
1308459152763691010 2020-09-23 01:32:26 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz lol Nobody cares. Your behavior today negates that.
1308458739960369155 2020-09-23 01:30:48 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If you're going to reap the rewards that Trump has given you, you have to deal with that fact that reasonable people are going to associate him with you and conservatism in general.
1308457630319415297 2020-09-23 01:26:23 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz You appreciate him far more than you want to admit. You're just too cowardly to openly praise him

1308456561430474754 2020-09-23 01:22:08 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @thenextTedCruz Is Trump a principled conservative that understands the stakes here when it comes to Roe v. Wade?
1308451260467744774 2020-09-23 01:01:05 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @Redistrict Because he's not a pretty gift, his ugly brutality is front and center
1308438730848563205 2020-09-23 00:11:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Re-upping this for no reason, no reason at all.

1308392670067384323 2020-09-22 21:08:15 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @AlexBorgia4 They are such short-term thinkers, not understanding that their actions now could severely hurt their case in the future.
1308392428181827586 2020-09-22 21:07:18 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> You really ought to be ashamed of yourselves and your friends. Degrading yourselves for power is unbecoming, to say the least.
1308391471972782082 2020-09-22 21:03:30 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> Before RBG died, conservatives were beginning to distance themselves from Trump. They jumped back to his side so they can get a third justice out the Faustian deal. It's remarkable. And disgusting.
1308282129659228160 2020-09-22 13:49:01 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @CrunchyFishTaco He's totally voting for Biden to end this nightmare...but he'll never admit it

1308214707086655491 2020-09-22 09:21:06 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @crneolib @needmoreclones Trump got his two picks. He doesn't deserve a third. It's his choice and Congress' choice to stand down and end this tension

1308211644548382722 2020-09-22 09:08:56 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> If they get upset, just tell them to calm down. That always works, Mr. President

I, the oldest, was the last to walk away in 2018. Last year, our parents gave us  each a Barron bookette to bring us back to the faith. It was wildly ineffective.

Not so for the GOP &amp; their media friends; only red states count in their world. A top conservative blog was literally named Red State.

More likely, they were able to hit their targets with the first 3 planes because people were confused and thought it was an hijack situation like the 1970s.

1304412032696037376 2020-09-11 21:30:38 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> My devotion to learn more about of the victims of 9-11, Flight 93 in particular, lead to me to read about the personal lives of Mark Bingham &amp; Waleska Martinez, two gay passengers on that flight. Along with Fr. Mychal Judge, these stories came to soften my heart on LGBT issues.

1302055483663097863 2020-09-05 09:26:32 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @newplanetseeker Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.

1302051339049095168 2020-09-05 09:10:04 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @NoahShachtman It's remarkably similar to their argument about Trump mocking Serge Kovaleski:  "Trump's mocking motions aren't specifically mimicking that reporter's arm, he's an asshole like that to everybody!!!"  https://t.co/F8HcKeAilH

It's fine for you to not trust the sources or the reporter but she is well respected even though she is a Fox News reporter. That you don't trust her says more about you than about her.

1302024211477794816 2020-09-05 07:22:17 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @gregsandiego @ddale8 The sources give their information to the reporter in confidence that they will not be revealed for fear of losing their livelihoods. It's a common practice

1301908488529088513 2020-09-04 23:42:26 +0800 <Mr_JamesLandis> @JessicaValenti There was such a taboo among pro-lifers on talking about punishing women who procure abortions. Trump and Williamson pushed those doors wide open

Then Trump said it, and then Williamson said it and the taboo is starting to fade.
