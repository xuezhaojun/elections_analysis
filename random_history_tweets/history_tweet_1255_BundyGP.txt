1327406308480303105 2020-11-14 08:21:40 +0800 <BundyGP> I have a sick feeling that Kamala Harris and the DNC have a short list of VP choices when Biden steps down due to dementia. Hilary anyone? America needs Trump to win !!  #crisis

1327389704338034689 2020-11-14 07:15:41 +0800 <BundyGP> @GKeile Yes, unfortunately if one of these recount states or cases goes to Trump, it opens the door and requires the media and democrats to walk it all back (and they should).

1317013720237629441 2020-10-16 16:05:14 +0800 <BundyGP> @ColumbiaBugle @bronwyn1140 Simply because he's convinced that if Hunter had chosen to be a little girl, perhaps none of this bad stuff would have happened.
1317012134631329793 2020-10-16 15:58:56 +0800 <BundyGP> True Katie, now those on camera who exercised their 1st Amendment Right &amp; supported Trump, might need witness protection. Democrats are doxing them.

1316941731741519873 2020-10-16 11:19:11 +0800 <BundyGP> Joe Biden went from #DefundThePolice to telling LEOs, "just shoot em the leg" tonight. I'm not sure which one is #CrackPipeBiden 🤔
1316907644905492480 2020-10-16 09:03:44 +0800 <BundyGP> 🇺🇲President Trump demonstrated tonight at the #TownHall why he beat Clinton, and why you should avoid Biden like the plague!!

1316026416870297603 2020-10-13 22:42:03 +0800 <BundyGP> @newschannelnine The Biden plan is a basic copy of what Trump is already doing and has done. Biden resorted to name calling when Trump issued the early travel restrictions. Biden was 4 months late on h1n1 response and diminished the PPE supply Zero credibility. MSM should report facts!
1316024088817668106 2020-10-13 22:32:47 +0800 <BundyGP> Clinton could have killed bin Laden, Obama called ISIS the JV team, democrats call #Antifas an idea..  @realDonaldTrump takes down Soleimani and Baghdadi ~Support the new pattern of justice!!!  #VOTE RED  #Benghazi must be remembered!  #AmericaFirst
1315771067927916545 2020-10-13 05:47:23 +0800 <BundyGP> Perhaps Hilary Clinton went to Russia, they don't have an extradition treaty with the United States.

1315766311528480768 2020-10-13 05:28:29 +0800 <BundyGP> @thejtlewis @TheRISEofROD I guess it would have been worse if Romney was Jewish.

1315760921814339584 2020-10-13 05:07:04 +0800 <BundyGP> @JoeBiden They're not looking for you as POTUS or the Senate seat you said you're running for today either.  Time for your afternoon snack &amp; nap time.

1315756121039097856 2020-10-13 04:47:59 +0800 <BundyGP> @realDonaldTrump That's because he announced he's running for Senator. #ConfusedJoe

1315666134545301508 2020-10-12 22:50:25 +0800 <BundyGP> Biden &amp; Obama watched the PPE supply dwindle after their late response to Swine Flu. Trump attacked Covid-19 head on while Biden &amp; Pelosi ripped the China travel ban, and other safety measures!!
1315429612013326336 2020-10-12 07:10:33 +0800 <BundyGP> I'm 100% onboard with #courtpacking 👍 With 9 common sense conservative justices..not activists or a mini legislative body in robes😡

1315424742044659714 2020-10-12 06:51:12 +0800 <BundyGP> @SenSchumer All Democrats should immediately pledge to follow the Constitution and accept Trump as their POTUS
