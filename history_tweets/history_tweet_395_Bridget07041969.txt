If you truly are my brother in Christ, then you still have time to ask for forgiveness. I suggest sooner rather than later.

Socialism is incompatible w/democracy because democracy, like market capitalism, allows power to flow to the individual. See Soviet Union, China, Cuba, NK and Venezuela.

1307010629023064064 2020-09-19 01:36:31 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @JoeBiden The comment about CV-19 deaths was a blatant lie. Not based on facts at all. There is no scientific evidence at all that there would not have been any deaths from covid had Trump reacted quicker than when he did in Jan. For God‚Äôs sake, be honest.

1307006000965197831 2020-09-19 01:18:08 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @JoeBiden And why no masks or social distancing after the townhall while chatting with furefighters who also were not wearing masks? You sir are a Hypocrite just like Pelosi.
1307005384066961408 2020-09-19 01:15:41 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @JoeBiden So the attendees were 13 Democrats and 3 Republicans that did not ask you any difficult questions. Your platform seems to only be Trump is Bad so vote for me. Such a joke Joe. Seriously disappointed in you and the Left.
1307004718401556480 2020-09-19 01:13:02 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @JoeBiden CNN should be ashamed of their sham. The best that could be said was you were lucid and sprite. LOL üòÇ I will be looking forward to seeing you handle questions regarding policies and platforms. Not just your emotional TDS.

1301003896974790656 2020-09-02 11:47:55 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @maryintheUSA @peterdukephoto @realDonaldTrump @AndrewBreitbart I did it it mentioned on Fox yesterday. But that is it that I am aware of.
1300852634706825217 2020-09-02 01:46:51 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz People cannot be arrested and prosecuted just for their fantasies. They shouldn‚Äôt be either, unless it crosses into action. I fantasized about killing my father for the 16 years of rape, but I won‚Äôt. Therefore I am not a murderer, but I have thought about it.
1300851775323340800 2020-09-02 01:43:26 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz Those are true statements.
1300851473916469248 2020-09-02 01:42:14 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz I stated this earlier.
1300850742937305090 2020-09-02 01:39:20 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz Why would I be offended by words? Letters are simply sounds. Words are letters grouped together. Words have power because we allow it and they are not necessary.
1300848241752195075 2020-09-02 01:29:24 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz True. There is a clear distinction no matter how vile both are to me.
1300848015905714176 2020-09-02 01:28:30 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz I definitely do not agree. There may be some, but I would imagine statistically that is not the case.
1300840282527678464 2020-09-02 00:57:46 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz I understand the difference.
1300830796551303174 2020-09-02 00:20:04 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @L0LZzZzZzZzZz @HSchruti To me, they are all the same and should end the same way as well.
1300829826119397376 2020-09-02 00:16:13 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz A pedophile who acts on their deviant sexual fantasies and urges is a child molester. My father is a pedophile who sexually molested girls and he should burn to death very slowly.
1300828820073668609 2020-09-02 00:12:13 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz Most do not understand that a child molester isn‚Äôt always a pedophile.
1300828537792856065 2020-09-02 00:11:06 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz The confusion lies in that the terms pedophile, pedophilia, child molester, child rapist, etc have been used interchangeably. Too often pedophile is used to simplistically refer to all those who sexually victimize children.
1300821346889261057 2020-09-01 23:42:31 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz I agreed with you and because you seem stuck on blast, you missed it.
1300819101930012672 2020-09-01 23:33:36 +0800 <Bridget07041969> @HSchruti @L0LZzZzZzZzZz Pedophilia is devoid of consummation, whereas pedophilic disorder is used in reference to individuals who act on their sexuality. Child rape is child rape. Sin in your heart is still sin.
