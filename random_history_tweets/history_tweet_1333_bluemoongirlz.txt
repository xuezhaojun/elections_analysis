1334592146561753088 2020-12-04 04:15:37 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @DrShayPhD Let them wield their political #StopTheSteal leverage during this narrow window before electors are seated.  If the Georgia election system isn't FIXED before the election runoff, that will be stolen too so it won't matter if they vote or not.
1334589800788226049 2020-12-04 04:06:18 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @PolitiBunny Someone said #StopTheSteal is playing "high speed chicken" to get Georgia election system FIXED before they'll commit their vote. I'm okey with using their leverage during this short window before electors are seated. If the system doesn't change, we'll get cheated &amp; lose anyway.

1318682956362354688 2020-10-21 06:38:11 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @bdomenech @Rockprincess818 All of these people, the media hacks and the pollsters will gladly trash their own reputations if it means @realDonaldTrump loses.  It's sickening.
1318652141716840451 2020-10-21 04:35:44 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> Hey @guybenson, for your circle of "feeling" girlfriends who might vote Biden.

1318611281079881728 2020-10-21 01:53:22 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @JoeConchaTV @frankluntz denounced the Republican party Election night on Katie Couric's online show. He did it early in the evening, before a lot of results came in, before his CBS appearance. You can find it on YouTube.  He's still Never Trumper.

1318435298699841536 2020-10-20 14:14:05 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @guypbenson Tell these bimbos they're not picking a Valentine, they're picking someone who won't dictate their freedoms and Liberty.
1318434308588187649 2020-10-20 14:10:09 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @BernardKerik @kirstiealley I wish that @hannity had let her talk more. But then, I wish he would let all of his guests talk more.  I just hit the Mute button when he talks now, it's only worth listening to the guests.
1318416307545571333 2020-10-20 12:58:37 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @RSBNetwork @randalthom Prayers to his family. He'll be watching over fellow patriots from above, God rest his soul.

1318349920856870912 2020-10-20 08:34:49 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @sethjlevy The point is that Dems will be CREATING the ballots in those 3 days. The mail will have NOTHING to do with it.

1318231164419772418 2020-10-20 00:42:55 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @RealMattCouch @RealBasedMAGA This came out on Friday. ..
1318229605166288902 2020-10-20 00:36:44 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Mamadoxie @RealRLimbaugh Made me tear up, especially the part about October 1st.
1318225465556029442 2020-10-20 00:20:17 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @realCCrump I only glance at Twitter Trends anymore to see if someone has died.  It's gotten that bad.

1318032966426284033 2020-10-19 11:35:21 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> Pollster predicts Pennsylvania is No. 1 state where @realDonaldTrump could win the state but have it stolen from him.  Good read though!

1317684117891387392 2020-10-18 12:29:09 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @CottoGottfried Because?  I just think that a lot more people than I EVER expected are REALLY freaked out about Covid...I mean people that I thought were smart!
1317680746119766016 2020-10-18 12:15:45 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @drawandstrike It makes you wonder what Dems are up to to see this brazen of a prediction. It scares me.
1317678741489930240 2020-10-18 12:07:47 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @CottoGottfried Do you think that Republican early voting numbers at these rates are taking votes from election day totals due to Covid (avoiding large crowds)?

So if a guy beats his dog then admits it, we should respect the guy for admitting it? That's assanine.  It's CENSORSHIP and election interference. There's nothing to respect about that.

1311753500687298560 2020-10-02 03:43:00 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @PolitiBunny Not spewing ugliness, however, I think it's odd for John and Chrissy  to have someone photograph them in their moments of devastating loss.  Just seems odd.

1311154791180099585 2020-09-30 12:03:56 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @EpicNinjaShiro @FoxNewsSunday I'm guessing 3 Nobel Peace prize nominations might have something to do with it.

I'M THRILLED WITH WHAT HE'S DONE!  I'm not picking a mate, I'm picking a President. Sometimes you need a bull in the china shop. Trump 200 MFer!

If they want to walk with the masses, in violation of curfew, that's their absolute right!  It does not however relieve them of consequences of their decisions.

With two cops shot and dozens and dozens of false "I'm Press" claims, the cops were within their rights to arrest those not complying.

That said, Antifa screwed them and others by so many calling themselves "Press".  Two cops were shot. Press needs to follow evacuation orders too.

1306939809085231104 2020-09-18 20:55:06 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @malan0404 @catturd2 Yep. Republicans set the expectations that he would poop his pants and droll on tv. While questioners were softball plants, Biden did "ok" based on expectations.  We lowered the bar too far.
1306815088322637824 2020-09-18 12:39:31 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @jmiddleton70 @catturd2 By my standards, it wasn't good.  By ill-informed "Average Undecided Voter" standards who has heard Republicans say for months that Joe Biden debating will be a train wreck, it exceeded expectations.  We've lowered the bar too far!
1306782317260738560 2020-09-18 10:29:17 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Klarkismyname @catturd2 But he didn't fall apart.  If you're Mr/Mrs "Average Undecided Voter" and heard how low Republicans have the bar on Biden debating, he did ok.  Not by your or my standard but from the drive-by voter who's not informed on Biden's positions.  We've lowered the bar too much!
1306781238812971008 2020-09-18 10:25:00 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @henryrodgersdc If I'm "Average Undecided Voter" &amp; I kept hearing how Republicans said Biden would crumble in debates, it wasn't a disaster.  Rs need to switch the expectation to "He's been in DC 47 years, OF COURSE he's GREAT at debating". With such a low bar, Joe  did ok.
1306778867642896386 2020-09-18 10:15:35 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @SianErith @MeghanMcCain @CNN Maybe have your hormones checked?

1306776234261721090 2020-09-18 10:05:07 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @philcamuso @catturd2 You're missing my point. Republicans have been saying for months that Trump will wipe the floor with Biden. We've lowered the bar SO MUCH that a performance like tonight looks more like a Biden "win" than a Trump "floor mopping" plus he'll be debating against Chris Wallace too.
1306774678338523138 2020-09-18 09:58:56 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @NicoleMSNRN @catturd2 Of course I don't think he's fit! That said, we've lowered the bar so much on what we expect out of a Biden debate, that his performance wasn't a disaster. I think that's an objective view based on what Republicans expect from him.
1306766194188394497 2020-09-18 09:25:13 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @catturd2 No, I dont think so. If he performs like this and uncontested on debate night, it will be perceived as a "win" for Biden. He got worse as the night went on, but it wasn't a disaster.

1301168480792858627 2020-09-02 22:41:55 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Raider_Ryan1 @ProFootballTalk The NFL has publicly endorsed &amp; donated to BLM Organization.  It's not what words the NFL is using in the end zone, it's that again, symbolism over substance, they know those words will PACIFY some viewers into believing they've "done something" to end racism.
1301164716119805953 2020-09-02 22:26:57 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Raider_Ryan1 @ProFootballTalk Because words in the end zone accomplishes absolutely nothing. It MIGHT make people feel warm &amp; fuzzy during the game, but it's not ACTION, it's feelings.  NFL supports BLM Organization (not the movement, the organization) Look at BLM website, see if you agree with those values.

1301000364003655681 2020-09-02 11:33:52 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> STOP USING DUCKDUCKGO! They're giving tips to rioters on how to avoid detection!
1300999945697333248 2020-09-02 11:32:13 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @DuckDuckGo Why the fuck would you give tips to rioters?!  I won't use you anymore!  #duckduckgosupportsanarchists.
1300991652765601793 2020-09-02 10:59:15 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @mattgaetz @AOC Ugh.
1300989920329203712 2020-09-02 10:52:22 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @jujusings1 @michaelbeatty3 I've had a dark &amp; difficult year too, and I know that He will get me through. I've never prayed so much.  Have faith in Him. Have faith in yourself.  Find a confident to talk to during those hard times.  Reach out. Reach out again. Reach out again. Never stop reaching out. Ever.
1300977593005617152 2020-09-02 10:03:23 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @PeteHegseth is in for @IngrahamAngle!  Yayyyyyyy!
1300963359089623041 2020-09-02 09:06:50 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Ryan_VanSickle Meh.
1300960982890696704 2020-09-02 08:57:23 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @dehemp @ProFootballTalk Nope. The Office is addicting. The NFL, not so much.
1300960507059462144 2020-09-02 08:55:30 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @KentuckyLefty @x_agent_x @deborahebloom Ok. Thanks.  So you seriously need a permit for a paintball gun in Portland?  Weird state.
1300954532357300226 2020-09-02 08:31:45 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @PeterHamby @EWErickson Now you know where some of that Black Lives Matter money went!
1300953835570159618 2020-09-02 08:28:59 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @w_terrence @Catheri71000729 Seriously, we need to stop with "XYZ must resign". They're never going to resign because they have no scruples. Ex. Ralph Northam. We look ridiculous demanding resignations. Please stop.
1300950806557065216 2020-09-02 08:16:57 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @thomassfl @ChrisCuomo I see what you did there! üòâ
1300942291490738176 2020-09-02 07:43:07 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @TimRunsHisMouth I use to defend him because he seemed like a good family mam and a good person.  Now he's just become an antagonist and provacatuer.
1300936284878364677 2020-09-02 07:19:15 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @x_agent_x @deborahebloom You seriously need a permit for a paintball gun in Wisconsin?  Wow, weird state.
1300924044632563713 2020-09-02 06:30:36 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @JackPosobiec That's not what he said.  It was much more garbled and incoherent.
1300923119713091584 2020-09-02 06:26:56 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> Bullshit.
1300918644680126468 2020-09-02 06:09:09 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @DontGetItTwist8 @americanblonde9 @marklevinshow She did. Pretty sure that's how Twitter is supposed to work.
1300905538054754304 2020-09-02 05:17:04 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @university_fox Porker.
1300899644931805184 2020-09-02 04:53:39 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @rightwingertoo @BreitbartNews That's EXACTLY what I said! Yes!
1300899486038929408 2020-09-02 04:53:01 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @BreitbartNews Isn't that the same chick that harassed that couple (congressman and his wife in red dress) after Trump's acceptance speech in DC?

1300892580092272641 2020-09-02 04:25:35 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @ProFootballTalk For the first season in my lifetime, I won't be watching.  I've never seen a more tone-deaf organization in my life.
1300882816096514048 2020-09-02 03:46:47 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @seanonolennon And that silence is violence.  Apparently, everything is violence.
1300881669084385283 2020-09-02 03:42:13 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @Joemama75 @seanmdav And maybe eliminated the gap!
1300824423486894082 2020-09-01 23:54:45 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @AP4Liberty You don't have to be a Trump supporter.  You sound like you're a supporter of freedom and Liberty...vote for those who support those values.  You're not picking a mate. You're picking someone who will let you live your life with freedom and Liberty (do you see a theme here? Lol!)
1300814970825969664 2020-09-01 23:17:11 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @SeanDaleyCA You're more conservative, or at minimum libertarian, than you think, and that you're willing to admit.
1300814238378844162 2020-09-01 23:14:17 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @SeanDaleyCA You had support until people read your #fucktrump in your bio. It's a shame because it's conservatives who support your freedom, right to private property, and entrepreneurship.  Best of luck to you in your Progressive world...you're going to need it.
1300813158613909507 2020-09-01 23:09:59 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> Hey @TuckerCarlson, you should interview this guy!
1300806520800714752 2020-09-01 22:43:37 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @sethjlevy Nah, too many unions there, plus new mail-in ballot legislation.
1300666342568148994 2020-09-01 13:26:35 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @TuckerCarlson @adamhousley @JackPosobiec @jsolomonReports @dbongino  Chicago gangs teaming up to shoot cops on site during middle of active  arrests.

1300623352479068160 2020-09-01 10:35:46 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> @GKeile Come on, be fair, it was twice that many!  It was 6.
1300608873221558279 2020-09-01 09:38:14 +0800 <bluemoongirlz> Does Portland Governor lie? @adamhousley @TuckerCarlson @JackPosobiec @greggutfeld  @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods
