As well as driver wellbeing, road safety is another thing not factored in. It is the dark side of excellent customer service businesses.

1338880487851499521 2020-12-16 00:15:58 +0800 <martin_downes> @AndrewHemming72 Agreed. That it should top LOTR, How Green Was My Valley and The Rape of the Fair Country is still a surprise.
1338879663884668936 2020-12-16 00:12:41 +0800 <martin_downes> @AndrewHemming72 I was shocked by it.
1338829894415945728 2020-12-15 20:54:55 +0800 <martin_downes> In 1996 The Lord of the Rings topped the readers' chart for in almost every Waterstone's branch in Britain.

1337374716097667075 2020-12-11 20:32:34 +0800 <martin_downes> Pro tip: Teaching Theory of Change isn't boring when you use Die Hard as an example. John McClane's intervention at the Nakotomi Plaza has the problem/inputs/activities, inhibitors/enablers/outputs/outcomes, and a final desired state. I think the staff enjoyed it @WalesCoOpCentre  https://t.co/5RHf1c8n1J
1337122378040676353 2020-12-11 03:49:52 +0800 <martin_downes> A phrase of William Faulkner's seems apt as we head to the end of the Brexit negotiations, it's been a "frantic steeplechase toward nothing".   Also #BorisHasFailedTheNation is the wrong hashtag. He has failed four nations not one.
1337038421647298564 2020-12-10 22:16:15 +0800 <martin_downes> Looking forward to teaching Theory of Change tomorrow with some help from the greatest Christmas movie of them all @WalesCoOpCentre @socialbizwales  https://t.co/XEe0V8bJ9g

1335141865130168322 2020-12-05 16:40:01 +0800 <martin_downes> @ceritheviking On a night out Richard Harris once hopped onto a train from London to Leeds when the pubs shut - it was the only way to carry on drinking.

1328276702607384577 2020-11-16 18:00:18 +0800 <martin_downes> @10Broderick @simonrug Yes, there is that. Not much fun for the Munster backs but very effective in piling on the points.

1327646136866402305 2020-11-15 00:14:40 +0800 <martin_downes> @stephenjones9 I'm bored of watching:  Close range tries from forwards Reset scrums and random scrum penalties  Scrum halves taking an age to box kick from the base of a ruck  Where has the flair and creativity gone?
1327639554002735104 2020-11-14 23:48:30 +0800 <martin_downes> Having watched rugby union zealously for over 30 years I find the modern game really quite boring as a spectacle. There are games that are an exception, and you always support your country, but too many matches are low on skill and low on creativity.

1324285493983531011 2020-11-05 17:40:40 +0800 <martin_downes> This little tweet provoked more responses than I had anticipated üòÄ   Theory of Change is a good thing. It teases out the logic &amp; assumptions of any interventions that we make to address problems (if/then construct).   Don't do it badly.   Stay safe from overly complicated ones.

1324020983662071808 2020-11-05 00:09:36 +0800 <martin_downes> @ClaudiaCSWales The value of it is that it brings to the surface and to open discussion and ownership a process and set of assumptions that is already present because we are starting something to address a problem and to reach a goal.
1324017331245375489 2020-11-04 23:55:05 +0800 <martin_downes> @ClaudiaCSWales See my reply to ClaireüòÄOr I can post pictures of awful ToC diagramsüòÇ  I'm not objecting to Theory of Change...after all you have been on a few webinars and a hackathon where I have taught, explained, and encouraged the use of it.
1324009843506716679 2020-11-04 23:25:20 +0800 <martin_downes> @ClaireWalesCoOp Don't worry Claire, I'm not against creating a Theory of Change. ToC is implicit in every project, needs to become explicit, agreed and owned, and then it needs to become tacit knowledge. My concern is about practicality and needless complexity of presentation.

1323931248704790530 2020-11-04 18:13:01 +0800 <martin_downes> Another session on the great business idea we almost forgot.

1323904556288348160 2020-11-04 16:26:57 +0800 <martin_downes> @DrDaiLlewellyn I think that approach is exactly right. Use it as a stimulus from mission to strategy. I'm running an in house training day on it and putting some cards on the table. It is implicit in projects and activities, there's value in making that shared explicit thinking.
1323894388288901120 2020-11-04 15:46:33 +0800 <martin_downes> @EthicsInBricks St Francis of Assisi rather than Niebuhr? Not to self, autocorrect wanted to change Niebuhr to Bieber.
1323893391986491392 2020-11-04 15:42:36 +0800 <martin_downes> @DafyddLThomas Absolutely. How you integrate Theory of Change with design and systems thinking is pertinent too.
1323725111459983363 2020-11-04 04:33:54 +0800 <martin_downes> Oops, *arrows not errors. Freudian slip.
1323722379974090752 2020-11-04 04:23:03 +0800 <martin_downes> And boring. The lifeblood of change is in stories. Diagrams with errors bring conceptual clarity, but they do not factor in people, serendipity and story in quite the right way.

1321185057462243328 2020-10-28 04:20:38 +0800 <martin_downes> I have long thought that events &amp; gatherings miss something when they miss food. There's something deeper when it is present and something amiss when we eat alone. Something existential &amp; deeper than the surface going on. Unless of course if it is McDonald's. Nothing deep there.  https://t.co/oDeXBHOBjJ
1321063639265234945 2020-10-27 20:18:10 +0800 <martin_downes> Does your organisation have a Theory of Change Model? Who put it together? How do you use it? How often do you use it?

1318896505424666624 2020-10-21 20:46:45 +0800 <martin_downes> @garethkthomas Absolutely. A disruption in life is an opportunity to learn, reflect, make changes, try new things. It's easy to long for normality to return without figuring out which bits of the old you need to leave behind.

The choice seems to be to focus on the individual entrepreneur. Is that because entrepreneurs are linked to wealth creation?

1318498822385995776 2020-10-20 18:26:30 +0800 <martin_downes> @NickCooperative @derekwalker_ I have been thinking about it for months. Starting with the individual and their business journey is the default. What if we changed that? That impulse doesn't just reflect the social sector, it's there in Rebel Ideas by @matthewsyed &amp; the work of @Scott_E_Page on diverse teams.
1318495181885276165 2020-10-20 18:12:02 +0800 <martin_downes> Why does mainstream business start-up support focus on individuals instead of teams?   Why has business support quickly embraced digital and social media but has been slower to embrace the needs of people and planet?  What would happen if we mandated responsibility from start-up?

In fact it was described as leading to a small minority of people without symptoms overwhelming the testing capacity in Caerphilly. Tests ran out then.

1315989653548396544 2020-10-13 20:15:57 +0800 <martin_downes> @hef4caerphilly @statsjamie The 2nd half of your first sentence is speculation. Fewer people with symptoms or people not wanting a test because of restrictions is more plausible. When the test centre opened attendance was encouraged if Caerphilly residents felt unwell. That language changed the week after.
1315729769506496513 2020-10-13 03:03:16 +0800 <martin_downes> @CaerphillyCBC Why can't you state the "exit strategy" or provide "further information about your plans"? This: "Our exit strategy consists of a number of variables, all of which need to be finely balanced" is verbose sophistry. Be transparent. A plan can be stated even if it can't be actioned.

1315358291321663488 2020-10-12 02:27:09 +0800 <martin_downes> @allisonpearson There were 17 field hospitals in Wales but that has been reduced to 10. A new covid facility is being built in Cardiff. How many of the 10 are currently operational is another matter. Outbreaks have occurred at three hospitals in Cwm Taf.

1314479959231131648 2020-10-09 16:16:58 +0800 <martin_downes> Unfortunately Josh Turnbull couldn't prove Irish ancestry, which would have reduced the three week ban to zero. @mattholcs @GarethReesJones this is a joke.

1313078444155179008 2020-10-05 19:27:51 +0800 <martin_downes> @Phillip_Blond Depends on the starting point. From one perspective they are fundamental, but logically they are rooted in ontology. We wouldn't know what rights are until we have untangled 'ought' from 'is'. I'm not really disagreeing with you. Ontology always needs to be on the table.
1313072969263001600 2020-10-05 19:06:06 +0800 <martin_downes> @Phillip_Blond Can rights not be ethically fundamental but intellectually derivative from a prior ontological and cognitive foundation?
1313069295694491649 2020-10-05 18:51:30 +0800 <martin_downes> @Phillip_Blond Refract them through the lens of Michael Sandel‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Tyranny of Merit‚Äô and we may start to get somewhere.
1312798015875358723 2020-10-05 00:53:32 +0800 <martin_downes> @AndrewGHenley @WelshEcon @CentreForWales I will take a look. Sue Prideaux's "I Am Dynamite" on Nietzsche is a fascinating read. The section on his descent into madness is written with real pathos.

1311700091225411585 2020-10-02 00:10:46 +0800 <martin_downes> @DrJessTaylor I read your blog on ACES some time ago and it was very good. The fatalism of the approach is worrying, and the optimism about public services is questionable.
1311698016571715585 2020-10-02 00:02:31 +0800 <martin_downes> @DrJessTaylor Is there a version of the cartoon about educated posh people or are they not likely to inflict ACEs on their children? This is about as astute as a 70s comedy on racism. I grew up with horrendous sexual violence at home. The cartoon misses the mark. Good work on critiquing it.

1311329784434241542 2020-09-30 23:39:18 +0800 <martin_downes> @NationCymru A Toy Epic was one of our A Level set texts in 1993 @mattholcs Very fond memories of that book. I remember quoting from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's song 'Old friends/Bookends' as I wrote my exam question on the book, in the gym at Y Pant Comprehensive School in the long off summer of 93.
1311235813297082369 2020-09-30 17:25:54 +0800 <martin_downes> @FionaMurden A whisker away from the question, "But what should I love?" and "What is the good life?" All very ancient questions.
1311232188214542336 2020-09-30 17:11:29 +0800 <martin_downes> @arisroussinos An interesting thought. What would it take to make this happen? There is an English xenophobia and reluctance to recognise Welsh as a language belonging to these isles. Sometimes that is expressed in the most patronising of ways.
1311230091410771968 2020-09-30 17:03:09 +0800 <martin_downes> @FionaMurden This is true. But you can love the wrong things in the right way, and the right things in the wrong way.

I grew up in RCT, a lot of my family are there, and they are lucky to have such a good council leader. I did not call him out. I asked a question about stats.
1310310170887704581 2020-09-28 04:07:43 +0800 <martin_downes> @ifanmj When people from Cardiff hear you talking about west Wales they think you mean Penarth.
1310307344232992771 2020-09-28 03:56:29 +0800 <martin_downes> @ifanmj When people talked about north Wales I assumed they meant Merthyr.

1308682746261364736 2020-09-23 16:20:55 +0800 <martin_downes> @Terri_White If you have not read it, Naomi Klein's book on it is extraordinary and frightening. She had an article in the Guardian back at the start of lockdown about some of the people profiting during this time.
1308680318581379072 2020-09-23 16:11:16 +0800 <martin_downes> @Terri_White This is 'disaster capitalism'. Unfortunately it is entrenched and embedded in how some people view the world and operate. It's as if anything for the public good is wrong, and anything tied to shareholder profit should top it.
1308517270453473281 2020-09-23 05:23:23 +0800 <martin_downes> @AndrewGHenley A good choice.
1308435419349032960 2020-09-22 23:58:08 +0800 <martin_downes> Personal circumstances can be a great catalyst to starting social change. This is a call to come together for communities in Mid Wales We kick off at 7pm this Thursday @WalesCoOpCentre @FocusNewtownHub @BigIdeasWales @UnLtd @PowysCC @CeredigionCC @AberUni   https://t.co/6PEeqRf9IN
1308361509324685312 2020-09-22 19:04:26 +0800 <martin_downes> @CardiffMetEnt A gem of a book.
1308133192625459201 2020-09-22 03:57:11 +0800 <martin_downes> Deep breath.   We are in for a rough few months.   Do something positive for you and your community.  Powys, Ceredigion, this is for you.  The Mid Wales Hack of Kindness   Sign up. We start on Thursday.    https://t.co/6PEeqRf9IN #socialenterprise
1308033881501831170 2020-09-21 21:22:34 +0800 <martin_downes> We are recruiting for a Business Adviser to join the Social Business Wales New Start team supporting people to set up new social enterprises. Great team to be part of, and @WalesCoOpCentre is a wonderful employer too.  https://t.co/0lhCqxiMHN
1307992450674368513 2020-09-21 18:37:56 +0800 <martin_downes> If you watch one TED Talk this week make this one. The late Sir Ken Robinson delivering one of the most insightful and uplifting talks on creativity that I have ever watched.  https://t.co/BaCqcJyIZy
1307675404216532994 2020-09-20 21:38:06 +0800 <martin_downes> @chriscurtis90 @MikeBubbins Probably because Dr @MichaelYeadon3 was the CSO at Pfizer

1307664467858161665 2020-09-20 20:54:39 +0800 <martin_downes> @Stephen02029244 @Adamjpritchard @BurtonMuseum What rank was he in the film?
1307664162735247364 2020-09-20 20:53:26 +0800 <martin_downes> @BurtonMuseum There is a Richard Burton exhibition at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff from 7th November.
1307653362205290498 2020-09-20 20:10:31 +0800 <martin_downes> @TonyEarnshaw @BurtonMuseum For the first time in my life I have been out Wild Geesed. I was gearing myself up for the casino scene Susan Hunt question.
1307652463978311681 2020-09-20 20:06:57 +0800 <martin_downes> @TonyEarnshaw @BurtonMuseum Is he the only member of the cast who is still alive? Such a great film. Never got the recognition it deserved.
1307652082250457090 2020-09-20 20:05:26 +0800 <martin_downes> @TonyEarnshaw @BurtonMuseum Spot on!
1307651882270306306 2020-09-20 20:04:38 +0800 <martin_downes> @BurtonMuseum @TonyEarnshaw It ought to have been a Burton question really. What peculiar funeral instructions does Colonel Faulkner have in the film?
1307646843258638337 2020-09-20 19:44:36 +0800 <martin_downes> @BurtonMuseum But with what weapon and with what modified ammunition did Hardy Kruger take out the sentries at the Army base?
1307600176643739648 2020-09-20 16:39:10 +0800 <martin_downes> @steve_aich Will definitely take you up on that.
1307597698825101312 2020-09-20 16:29:20 +0800 <martin_downes> @steve_aich Discovered it yesterday.
1307595069948653568 2020-09-20 16:18:53 +0800 <martin_downes> It has been a wonderful summer for walking, and Caerphilly is full of great places to walk. Some photos from the Forge Trail from Machen.  https://t.co/l2QdGJWECn

1306911665666088963 2020-09-18 19:03:16 +0800 <martin_downes> This is an exciting event to be part of. Great opportunity to learn, be creative, try out ideas, and meet great people who want to see more good things happening in Mid Wales.

1306257391445573633 2020-09-16 23:43:25 +0800 <martin_downes> @cerifidlerjones @DaveMadgeCOOP Rocking up at 4pm to start a day's work.
1306248195085864960 2020-09-16 23:06:53 +0800 <martin_downes> @markhutchings1 @vaughangething That's some level of detail. Is it unique in terms of public health reporting from government during the last six months?
1306188326689533953 2020-09-16 19:08:59 +0800 <martin_downes> @ifanmj She means in each room.
1306188074557345793 2020-09-16 19:07:59 +0800 <martin_downes> @ifanmj More worrying that the data breach caused only minor ripples.

1306156574231146496 2020-09-16 17:02:49 +0800 <martin_downes> @DaveMadgeCOOP Age doesn't come gently when it comes to knees. I refer to mine as the good one and the bad one rather than left and right.
1306152813261721602 2020-09-16 16:47:52 +0800 <martin_downes> @WillowWyse @ResetCymru I am touched that you thought it is ridiculous though. That has genuinely made my day. #socialenterprise
1306152579454427136 2020-09-16 16:46:56 +0800 <martin_downes> @DaveMadgeCOOP @DaveCoHoP @Hudsonproj @ebony_redhead @CathEWalesCoop Bought a bike this summer from Ynysybwl Regeneration Project. Just need the office to re-open for my commute on it.   Take a look at this commute calculator @Glennwalescoop @derekwalker_ @karlew23 @EdwardsRhian
1306152071184486400 2020-09-16 16:44:55 +0800 <martin_downes> @WillowWyse @ResetCymru I didn't say that there was anything wrong with profit motive. The use of profit is another matter altogether. I'm not arguing for communism. It's not 1970, and Friedmanism is toxic. We need a better way.
1306148469384654848 2020-09-16 16:30:36 +0800 <martin_downes> @ResetCymru Business support needs an overhaul. No business should start without meaningfully and practically aligning itself to the triple bottom line, and a greater proportion need to wean themselves off shareholder profit as the core aim of the business.
1306146591959650310 2020-09-16 16:23:09 +0800 <martin_downes> Great leadership on this from @Captain_Gareth   Take a look @DaveMadgeCOOP @carlymccreesh @NicolaMehegan

1305943920757608448 2020-09-16 02:57:48 +0800 <martin_downes> @markjhooper Not a peep at yesterday's press conference.
1305923756888596480 2020-09-16 01:37:41 +0800 <martin_downes> Great story about a new social enterprise. Innovation at work.
1305872523737919488 2020-09-15 22:14:06 +0800 <martin_downes> @DelythJewellAM @fmwales Is it true that the transport restrictions in Caerphilly are unique in the UK?
1305871188741292033 2020-09-15 22:08:47 +0800 <martin_downes> @ideologicalgog1 @J_Bloodworth There's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya...
1305843386046447616 2020-09-15 20:18:19 +0800 <martin_downes> @J_Bloodworth Sartre, Nietszsche, and Dostoevsky all understood the implications of the destruction of an external referent for moral systems. I sometimes wonder why this has been forgotten and why it is not clearly perceived.
1305841489977769986 2020-09-15 20:10:47 +0800 <martin_downes> @J_Bloodworth Modernity and post-modernity tore up the notion of external values into small pieces. We are left in a blizzard of confetti on this, grabbing at bits of morality without a coherent system, or understanding what that system once looked like and why it held everything together.
1305835917152849920 2020-09-15 19:48:38 +0800 <martin_downes> @cymraesydwi @WelshGovernment @CaerphillyCBC were encouraging people to get tested if they were 'feeling unwell' and then changed it to covid symptoms. Still not as specific as on this graphic. How many tests have been used up unnecessarily?
1305806570236841985 2020-09-15 17:52:01 +0800 <martin_downes> @jadenozzz @AlistairHaimes Here it is 'residents who are feeling even slightly unwell', although they backtracked on that a few days later &amp; said only those with symptoms. All this is part of the 'data' that will inform the local lockdown decisions. I've asked if symptoms are recorded alongside tests.
1305563111227826184 2020-09-15 01:44:36 +0800 <martin_downes> @hef4caerphilly You are only human. Get yourself well first.
1305525695163043847 2020-09-14 23:15:55 +0800 <martin_downes> @TomAddiscott @HilaryCottam @DanJHayes I haven't seen it. WhatsApp it to me butt.
1305524492949688321 2020-09-14 23:11:09 +0800 <martin_downes> @TomAddiscott I liked the emphasis on working in the community in the blog. Services are not good at this sort of thing. Have you seen @HilaryCottam's book Radical Help on public services?  I'm sorry to hear that butt.
1305522730717130752 2020-09-14 23:04:09 +0800 <martin_downes> @TomAddiscott Very much asking "What happened to you?" not "What is wrong with you?" Heartening to read it, especially given the scale of anti-depressant use in the valleys.
1305496121167564800 2020-09-14 21:18:24 +0800 <martin_downes> @CaerphillyCBC @jamswilliams85 @PublicHealthW @AneurinBevanUHB Thank you
1305493199075639296 2020-09-14 21:06:48 +0800 <martin_downes> @jamswilliams85 @CaerphillyCBC Do you have the numbers for people going into hospital? My understanding is that it is 2 patients. Still no deaths for September thankfully.
1305488793634508802 2020-09-14 20:49:17 +0800 <martin_downes> @Jane_Ryall @UnLtd Two years on from meeting him this is great to see.
1305487430775181312 2020-09-14 20:43:52 +0800 <martin_downes> @ITVWales That sounds as if we are morally culpable if we test positive for Covid-19. Does this reasoning apply to those in care home who may test positive? Do we have an assurance that the tests are accurate or that they are picking up current infections and not non-viable fragments?
1305486090288201729 2020-09-14 20:38:33 +0800 <martin_downes> This, on trauma, circumstance, and mental health is well worth a read. For years I thought the problem was chemical imbalance and didn't understand the impact of trauma.
1305471115524018176 2020-09-14 19:39:03 +0800 <martin_downes> @sararobinson81 @KatieGupwell @MikeWalesCoOp can you help point the way to social enterprise stories? #GoodNewsCymru
1305467787138289664 2020-09-14 19:25:49 +0800 <martin_downes> @JCrichtonSmith James I have out in a FOI request to @WelshGovernment about the operational status of the other 15 field hospitals going into autumn/winter (we know Llandarcy has been closed). Disappointing that the Principality Stadium field hospital dismantling was in the sports pages.
1305430744739840000 2020-09-14 16:58:37 +0800 <martin_downes> This is liberating. The lie of merit has been peddled for years and it drips through our education and work systems like poison.  https://t.co/mx9yTApste
1305206378789732352 2020-09-14 02:07:04 +0800 <martin_downes> @statsjamie It would be a help to have more transparency around this. I don't think that it is helpful to have so little information. But on the numbers it is cautiously positive for Caerphilly.
1305205535663325185 2020-09-14 02:03:43 +0800 <martin_downes> @statsjamie And assuming that a positive case is the same as a current infection. That is a moot point and the tests are not designed to give that result.
1305197731837808640 2020-09-14 01:32:43 +0800 <martin_downes> Thoughtful thread on home working teasing out some of the unintended consequences. A fairer approach is in the direction of local co-working spaces.
1305062554230829056 2020-09-13 16:35:34 +0800 <martin_downes> @WalesOnline You have taken the five reasons directly from a BBC article from 9th September without acknowledgement.  https://t.co/SILzw9VQMO
1305057823852814336 2020-09-13 16:16:46 +0800 <martin_downes> @mattholcs No bach.
1305056294517211137 2020-09-13 16:10:42 +0800 <martin_downes> Spending your money with a social enterprise is money well spent. I'm such a fan of Madlug someone asked me if I was on commission. I love their social mission.
1304383675463852033 2020-09-11 19:37:57 +0800 <martin_downes> @hef4caerphilly Thanks Hefin. Will email today.
1304346221742624768 2020-09-11 17:09:07 +0800 <martin_downes> @hef4caerphilly @conorh_96 Any questions raised about PCR testing? I don't use Facebook and worry about certain issues around testing locally. Would like to know about re-testing for positives, Ct threshold, implications of asymptomatic testing. These areas are being scrutinised in MSM.

1304086935623925760 2020-09-10 23:58:48 +0800 <martin_downes> @WelshEcon @AlexDaviesJones @MickAntoniw1 Hope you get answers to each of those three questions.
1304078958703632387 2020-09-10 23:27:07 +0800 <martin_downes> @statsjamie Agreed, way to early. It is a relief to see the numbers coming down. Hopefully this will continue.
1304076749970509826 2020-09-10 23:18:20 +0800 <martin_downes> @statsjamie Jamie, what do you make of the fall in numbers in Caerphilly and RCT?
1304050093033746433 2020-09-10 21:32:24 +0800 <martin_downes> @DafyddTrystan @carlheneghan @AlistairHaimes The volume of community testing has ramped up significantly. Too early to know whether the extra local restrictions have made a difference in any case.
1304048402947338242 2020-09-10 21:25:41 +0800 <martin_downes> Latest testing figures for Caerphilly are 2.7% but we are locked down until at least October @carlheneghan @AlistairHaimes #caerphillylockdown
1304045304430432258 2020-09-10 21:13:23 +0800 <martin_downes> Questions about testing during #caerphillylockdown @CaerphillyObsvr @PublicHealthW @AneurinBevanUHB @hef4caerphilly @DelythJewellAM Is it possible to have some answers? No questions about pubs or masks as they have been thoroughly covered.
1304011798652256262 2020-09-10 19:00:14 +0800 <martin_downes> @5to9Club @ClaudiaCSWales @TomAddiscott @JBWalescoop  https://t.co/c9KTPymday
1304003939537424384 2020-09-10 18:29:01 +0800 <martin_downes> Heads up @ClaudiaCSWales @TomAddiscott @JBWalescoop
1304001648147206146 2020-09-10 18:19:54 +0800 <martin_downes> @MickAntoniw1 Sandel is brilliant. His books on justice and 'What Money Can't Buy: The moral limits of markets' are superb.
1303972523521044480 2020-09-10 16:24:10 +0800 <martin_downes> Finally, thank you again for all that you are doing to reinforce the need for social distancing and hygiene, and for being quick to protect the vulnerable in care home. This is absolutely to your credit. #caerphillylockdown
1303972521662984192 2020-09-10 16:24:10 +0800 <martin_downes> The Welsh Gov guidance on PCR testing cautions that "Testing for screening in asymptomatic individuals is likely to generate a high rate of false positive tests when the prevalence of infection is low." Are positive tests in Caerphilly regarded as indicative of current infections
1303972515807666177 2020-09-10 16:24:09 +0800 <martin_downes> ..of the testing will not be skewed by the testing of asymptomatic people? Can we know the procedures for re-testing positives? Can we know the threshold for the tests &amp; the margins of error for false positives? Can we be reassured that only those with symptoms are being tested?
1303972513249189890 2020-09-10 16:24:08 +0800 <martin_downes> It is imperative that we bring this under control in Caerphilly and that we have all the information that we need. We know that people are already being turned away from the test centres due to a shortage of available tests. Can we have reassurance that the overall results...
1303972511365951489 2020-09-10 16:24:08 +0800 <martin_downes> is a positive result from the repeat sample.

1303972498409697281 2020-09-10 16:24:04 +0800 <martin_downes> What are the implications of testing those without symptoms for the accuracy of the testing?

1303972496010620929 2020-09-10 16:24:04 +0800 <martin_downes> Initially appeals were made to attend the mobile testing unit 'If you are feeling unwell', with the expectation of positive results and the need for accurate numbers. But the language was then changed to 'present yourself for testing only if you are symptomatic'.  https://t.co/yp3n5wHJNw

The mobile testing centre was advertised on the weekend but only Saturday's results have been published. There is now a second drive through test centre. The former encouraged people who felt unwell for no particular reason to get tested.

1303370253699817476 2020-09-09 00:30:58 +0800 <martin_downes> From the BBC article "But when you take a coronavirus test, you get a "yes" or "no" answer. There is no indication of how much virus was in the sample, or how likely it is to be an active infection."
1303370252202455047 2020-09-09 00:30:58 +0800 <martin_downes> Could residents also be informed about re-testing for those who were given positive results on the weekend? And also the threshold for the testing?
1303370250336063490 2020-09-09 00:30:57 +0800 <martin_downes> Given that Caerphilly will be in lockdown for weeks could we have some indication from @vaughangething @CaerphillyCBC that the significant increase of Pillar 2 PCR testing will take into account the danger of false positives detailed here  https://t.co/3Xsrj1YFjQ @carlheneghan
1303366231173496832 2020-09-09 00:14:59 +0800 <martin_downes> The Caerphilly lockdown has left me with lots of questions.   What was the policy and the numbers for testing prior to the mobile unit being advertised in the town centre?  Will the 19 positive cases so far be retested?  Are all the positives considered to be current infections?

1303320425812971521 2020-09-08 21:12:58 +0800 <martin_downes> Questions I wished journalists had asked @vaughangething today: Given the rise in cases was it wise to start dismantling the field hospital at the Principality Stadium? Will the 19 positive cases from Saturday's Caerphilly tests be re-tested? How many of the 451 were symptomatic?

1303234673699627009 2020-09-08 15:32:13 +0800 <martin_downes> @cymraesydwi @vaughangething @CaerphillyCBC @carlheneghan's recent Spectator article noted that no medical trials have been carried out on the use of masks, although there are a small number of studies.
1303234207569895424 2020-09-08 15:30:22 +0800 <martin_downes> @NickServini @vaughangething @BBCRadioWales Nick, what do we know about symptomatic cases found in Caerphilly given the caveats in the Welsh Government's published guidance on PCR testing? We know as of yesterday that cases are 'mild' and no increase in seeking medical help has happened.
1303078062972694535 2020-09-08 05:09:54 +0800 <martin_downes> @BBCWalesNews The mobile testing unit asked for people with symptoms to come for testing. Can it be confirmed that the 450 tests with 19 positive results carried out on Saturday were from those with symptoms?
1303074219522166794 2020-09-08 04:54:38 +0800 <martin_downes> @BBCWalesNews Is the high spike on the end of the graph because of the results of the mobile testing unit on Caerphilly town centre? Prior to that was it not the case that the nearest non-clinical test centres were out of the county borough in Abercynon and Newport?
1303043526603821066 2020-09-08 02:52:40 +0800 <martin_downes> @Captain_Gareth And yet the causes are universal; holidays, lack of hygiene, lack of social distancing. Thankfully cases have been described as 'mild' so far. I still think we need more transparency on testing.
1303029196810268673 2020-09-08 01:55:44 +0800 <martin_downes> @ChrisAmps @CaerphillyCBC @PublicHealthW @vaughangething @AneurinBevanUHB @WelshGovernment Aye, have just read it.

Where were tests carried out in the Borough over the last four weeks? How many positive tests were as a result of people presenting symptoms? How many positives were recorded in community settings? Are Ct values in the public domain? Or will these questions not relevant?

1302986062705426434 2020-09-07 23:04:20 +0800 <martin_downes> We need to know more about the testing that is going on in relation to the cautions of that Welsh Government document. I have no axe to grind with the Welsh Government response through these six months, but more clarity is needed if we are to face a local lockdown @hef4caerphilly
1302986061350567939 2020-09-07 23:04:19 +0800 <martin_downes> "o In the context of critical worker screening, this may lead to significant unnecessary exclusion from work. Evidence is emerging that testing for infectivity may be refined by the level of test positivity (Ct value) and the presence of an antibody response."
1302986060063014912 2020-09-07 23:04:19 +0800 <martin_downes> "Testing for screening in asymptomatic individuals is likely to generate a high rate of false positive tests when the prevalence of infection is low. In the context of pre-surgical screening, this may lead to significant unnecessary postponement of surgery."
1302986058628562944 2020-09-07 23:04:19 +0800 <martin_downes> If a local lockdown is needed that is understandable, but we do need more clarity and less unnecessary fear due to imprecise language and terminology. The Welsh Government article on testing is here  https://t.co/ZFfzjxGA0J
1302986057026342912 2020-09-07 23:04:18 +0800 <martin_downes> in order that accurate epidemiological data are available to inform policy decisions." It would be helpful to residents to have clarity and transparency around definitions (cases and infectivity, see this recent article  https://t.co/3Xsrj1YFjQ)
1302986055608659969 2020-09-07 23:04:18 +0800 <martin_downes> However the impact of the test results on epidemiology data should be considered. The positivity rate should be monitored in such a way the Ct values are recorded, to reflect the likely false positive rate...
1302986054157447169 2020-09-07 23:04:18 +0800 <martin_downes> @WelshGovernment has published a document about testing. It contains the following section "Testing as a population screening tool in asymptomatic populations. In this setting there may be a greater tolerance for false negative and false positives results."
1302986052785840129 2020-09-07 23:04:17 +0800 <martin_downes> Like many others I have been concerned by the laxity in local supermarkets around hygiene and head counting. It isn't helpful that in the media Caerphilly Town and Caerphilly Borough are being lumped together under 'Caerphilly'. We need precise information as residents.
