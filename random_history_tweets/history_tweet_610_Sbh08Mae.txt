He threw out the pandemic response manual &amp; never made a pandemic plan.  Trump promised a healthcare plan on day 1. Four years later, still no plan.   Republicans are silent

1313198200195616768 2020-10-06 03:23:43 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump is receiving world class treatment for COVID at Walter Reed Hospital, a government funded hospital.  Trump doesn‚Äôt pay taxes; it‚Äôs you and I paying his tab after HE behaved recklessly.  Care we don‚Äôt receive!  Vote for Biden!  #wtpBiden   #wtpBlue    https://t.co/l2Y77XeEIU
1313195952245805062 2020-10-06 03:14:47 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> When Joe Biden is President , he‚Äôll put the safety of our troops first!  If you support our military, this is a must watch video!  Thank goodness for Joe Biden!  #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica   #wtpBiden   #wtpBlue     https://t.co/cWwX2WlXWi
1313194044961550336 2020-10-06 03:07:12 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump is leaving the hospital tonight.  If he has COVID, it‚Äôs reckless disregard for the health of himself &amp; others!  If not, it‚Äôs an elaborate hoax on the American people.  He‚Äôs leaving, so I go with the latter!  Either way, I prefer Biden‚Äôs leadership!  #wtpBiden  #wtpBlue  https://t.co/B5YZgrEJAk
1313179789331771393 2020-10-06 02:10:34 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @ps9714 Bill Barr but unless he‚Äôs extremely ill, I don‚Äôt thank we‚Äôll know it!  He did decide to start quarantining today by says he‚Äôs negative. If so, why wait until now?

1313177354898939908 2020-10-06 02:00:53 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @CarmenSisRice @JoeBiden Trump will never believe in science!
1313176765947314176 2020-10-06 01:58:33 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> There‚Äôs way too much info in this excellent article to even summarize!Please read it!

1313168253594873857 2020-10-06 01:24:43 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @kaitlancollins The entire WH has reckless disregard!
1313167953106481154 2020-10-06 01:23:32 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @mmpadellan @FozzieBear88 It will be confirmed as a campaign stunt if he leaves for hospital! He loves games and this would be the ultimate game! I beat it and it wasn‚Äôt bad. That sort of thing.
1313167081160966147 2020-10-06 01:20:04 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @BearBertthe @DexyDuck Thank you Dexy Duck! I know Bert appreciates the tribute! It‚Äôs fantastic and does cover his best things next to Mum and Dad! üíô

1313152352283774978 2020-10-06 00:21:32 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @alifeofinsanity Her lies are creative but still lies! Such a shame to destroy her career at such a young age!

1313138909266817024 2020-10-05 23:28:07 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Attn: Americans Abroad!  NOW is the time to register and request ballots to vote in this election to oust Trump!  Trump is reckless plus a clear and present danger to our country!  Joe Biden needs your vote! Please go to  https://t.co/35rulo2oU0! We need you!
1313136667985932291 2020-10-05 23:19:13 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Presidents always denounce extremist groups!  Not Trump! Trump embraces extremists &amp; incites them to violence! He revels in violence!  Trump threatens our democracy!  Vote for Joe Biden to save our country from a wannabe dictator!  #wtpBlue   #wtpBiden     https://t.co/a7eC9PGeht
1313132601302044678 2020-10-05 23:03:03 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> ‚ÄòMalignant Buffoon'- Interesting article!  In a slow rolling celebration of himself, we witnessed the depths of Trump‚Äôs selfishness and malfeasance!  A RIDE TO NOWHERE is an exquisite metaphor for the end of Trump‚Äôs Presidency.   #wtpBlue   #wtpBiden  https://t.co/a5wsGw9hmr
1313128248730058753 2020-10-05 22:45:45 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump said, I get it. I wanted to believe him but he wasn‚Äôt serious.  Trump proceeded to put many people in danger to take a ride for a photo op!   Trump will always be reckless and inhuman w/no thought to protect anyone but him.  #wtpBiden   #wtpBlue    https://t.co/YzqOhFo90R

This isn‚Äôt a list I‚Äôm suppose to add to, right? If I need to add, yell at me! Anyway , thank you for the mention!   Almost unbelievable it‚Äôs 29 days but 29 days never seemed so long!  https://t.co/Yayu1qTY6D
1313118812867358721 2020-10-05 22:08:16 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Sen Murphy‚Äôs 10 point feed is an important and shocking read.
1313117608187756545 2020-10-05 22:03:28 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @OliviaTroye @Versuhty1e I‚Äôm disappointed! I now know the WH staffers actually just care about themselves. They evidently have no conscience and sleep well. Many people don‚Äôt have scruples.
1313113286448164864 2020-10-05 21:46:18 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @IslandGirlPRV Will they allow Trump to dictate to them or will NC follow the rules and tradition?
1313112014206705669 2020-10-05 21:41:15 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @ps9714 Yeah, but they think Trump is special.
1312974901922365440 2020-10-05 12:36:25 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @CarmenSisRice @JoeBiden Control or destroy whichever fits his agenda!

1312932600177188864 2020-10-05 09:48:19 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @FetsKatze @peaceandteachin I believe he said he‚Äôd testify after the election. The judge said no, he had to show.
1312931705087578113 2020-10-05 09:44:46 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @peaceandteachin I‚Äôll await his explanation. Should be interesting to hear and debunk.
1312931250135539713 2020-10-05 09:42:57 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @ps9714 Excellent!
1312929982436519943 2020-10-05 09:37:55 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Let‚Äôs review the speech making Joe Biden the President of the United States!...  https://t.co/hjC7ZmCUnj via @YouTube  I‚Äôm so proud for ‚ÄòWe The People‚Äô that Joe Biden will be our President!  #wtpBlue   #wtpBiden  https://t.co/2B1k3DsCrn

1312927098428895232 2020-10-05 09:26:27 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Inspiring video from Joe Biden!  He‚Äôs right! Trump can‚Äôt be re-elected! He‚Äôll completely destroy the United States of America!  Trump is a almost 75 yr old child!  We must have the experienced leadership of Joe Biden!  #wtpBlue  #wtpBiden    https://t.co/kbP1hP169v via @YouTube
1312923699251683330 2020-10-05 09:12:57 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @angie_keathly Joe‚Äôs the real deal!
1312923452794376192 2020-10-05 09:11:58 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @Hanswolff1 @CarmenSisRice I doubt it. They like the show. Of the 60 Maga‚Äôs blocking voting in VA, only 3 had ever voted. Only 3 were registered to vote.
1312921020022640640 2020-10-05 09:02:18 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> To save our country, Joe Biden must be 46!  This March of Joe‚Äôs is of The People, by The People and for The People!  Everyday Joe stands for, kneels for, marches &amp; walks arm-in-arm with The People!  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020   #wtpBlue   #wtpBiden  https://t.co/mMexcXhQub
1312917889842806785 2020-10-05 08:49:52 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Biden will be an honest and caring President, willing and able to lead ALL Americans!  Biden has a soul, empathy plus he listens!

1312912479337558016 2020-10-05 08:28:22 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Words! Only words with Trump! If this isn‚Äôt another stunt, he‚Äôll sing a different song, soon. Whatever his angle, it‚Äôs nefarious!
1312911722030804992 2020-10-05 08:25:21 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @gtconway3d @SecretService Reckless!
1312895689182138368 2020-10-05 07:21:39 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @SnowdenBishop @JDiamond1 @CNN A reckless disregard for others!
1312887416676589568 2020-10-05 06:48:47 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @SnowdenBishop Trump always has an angle. I‚Äôm not even 100% sure he‚Äôs sick. You just can‚Äôt trust him!
1312882185091907584 2020-10-05 06:27:59 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Angry but knew the dangers of working for Trump. They didn‚Äôt quit nor have they quit since. Safety and decency must not as important as anger.
1312877939906818048 2020-10-05 06:11:07 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @verbalrugby Such as?
1312876706877902852 2020-10-05 06:06:13 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @DMau68 Trump is reckless, arrogant, and doesn‚Äôt care for the welfare of others. He must be better even to pull off this stunt. This kind of reckless behavior gave him and probably thousands of others COVID! Don‚Äôt they say for every person you expose, 10 others on average contract it?
1312865414830075905 2020-10-05 05:21:21 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @JamesrossrJames I‚Äôm actually hoping most will vote in person to avoid this scenario!
1312864205234671616 2020-10-05 05:16:33 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @verbalrugby I imagine not since the committee said they were faked and threw them out. You need accomplishments and real nominations.
1312861181506453504 2020-10-05 05:04:32 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @DougHarding7 @JoeBiden Trump is never honest about anything!  If you ever believe a word he says, you‚Äôre gullible! Just sayin!
1312858906612424711 2020-10-05 04:55:29 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @HedyLamarr228 Thank you, Susan.
1312857983597129729 2020-10-05 04:51:49 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @DMau68 Plus he was selling the PPE‚Äôs and equipment to other countries!

1312855907806609408 2020-10-05 04:43:34 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Jill Biden‚Äôs story of Joe receiving the Medal of Freedom!  It touching and definitely worth a listen!  #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica    https://t.co/hdt6qn1Cg0
1312851591439974403 2020-10-05 04:26:25 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> The picture alone is the best illustration of Trump‚Äôs mishandling of COVID.   The packed Rose Garden may be the source of many new COVID cases &amp; could lead to thousands more!  It‚Äôs also signals the severity of Trump‚Äôs poor judgment!  #wtpBiden  #wtpBlue    https://t.co/MDow44SgFf
1312846604311896067 2020-10-05 04:06:36 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> The 1st hour after the Harrison &amp; Graham debate, Jaime raised $125,000 in donations.   Lindsey was an institution in SC but his failure to help the people of SC &amp; the country, has led to SC to need change &amp; someone working for them!  #wtpBiden #wtpBlue  https://t.co/cbOv1CdrcK
1312839939273494528 2020-10-05 03:40:07 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> 75% of Americans believe Trump didn‚Äôt take COVID seriously nor did he take precautions to avoid getting it.  43% of Repubs believe he doesn‚Äôt have the proper mindset!  Biden is a leader &amp; has both a COVID &amp; economic recovery plan!  #wtpBiden  #wtpBlue  https://t.co/n9zxzh5mHl
1312834417556180993 2020-10-05 03:18:11 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Joe Biden‚Äôs nat‚Äôl lead jumped 14 pts after the debate!  By a 2-1 margin, Americans say Biden has the better temperament to be President!  Let‚Äôs make a #BidenHarrisLandslide happen to ensure the Presidency doesn‚Äôt land in a GOP court!  #wtpBiden   #wtpBlue  https://t.co/EEfn0VTAlD
1312829844502335489 2020-10-05 03:00:00 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Knowing Trump along with others tested positive for CV, Ivanka travels to NC!  3 businesses shut down for a deep clean after her reckless disregard for people‚Äôs safety!  You won‚Äôt find the callous attitude among Biden‚Äôs supporters!  #wtpBlue #wtpBiden  https://t.co/99ROtZ95Qc
1312826743816949766 2020-10-05 02:47:41 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> @BearBertthe The unconditional love you receive from a beloved pet/family member hurts so much when they leave us, but their love always makes the pain worth it! üíô

1312806115428700163 2020-10-05 01:25:43 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> The WH isn‚Äôt offering contact tracing to ppl Trump exposed.  Trump mingled w/200 ppl at his NJ club.

1312774560190730242 2020-10-04 23:20:19 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump is running a game on America.  He uses unfulfilled promises to cover unfulfilled promises.

1312763494324936712 2020-10-04 22:36:21 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Have you learned nothing from your reckless disregard for life? Your President could die or suffer from COVID after spreading the virus to millions!  You wear a mask as a necessity. Patriots have a duty to protect others!  Biden has a comprehensive COVID plan!  #wtpBlue #wtpBiden  https://t.co/99GCmBP2Pl
1312757043355414528 2020-10-04 22:10:43 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump has become a symbol of his own numerous failures.

1312533084814729216 2020-10-04 07:20:47 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump‚Äôs diagnosis plunged the Republicans into a reckoning!  The leaders strategy has been to downplay COVID!

1300872572423331844 2020-09-02 03:06:04 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> If Republicans close their eyes to Trump defending the Kenosha suspect, accused of killing two people and wounding another, they are complicit in every murder committed in Trump‚Äôs honor by right wing radicals! They need to condemn Trump immediately! https://t.co/vmeDIFMV3i

1300803540416450563 2020-09-01 22:31:46 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Trump's conspiracy theory that a plane load of thugs sent to disrupt the RNC is totally false! This matches a conspiracy theory previously tried.  Bald face lie!#wtpBlue  https://t.co/JbHs6o998T via @nbcnews

1300788488967802880 2020-09-01 21:31:57 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Rightfully so, the Portland Mayor blames Trump for escalating violence! This is Trump‚Äôs mission and campaign strategy!

1300780840591425537 2020-09-01 21:01:34 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> The only reason Trump is going to Kenosha, after both the Governor and the Mayor begged him to stay away, is to cause unrest, chaos, and to incite further violence! This is truly Trump‚Äôs racist and violent America! Don‚Äôt be baited Kenosha! #wtpBlue
1300777550332014592 2020-09-01 20:48:29 +0800 <Sbh08Mae> Professional police officers without racist and violent tendencies aren‚Äôt going to choke because good police officers aren‚Äôt escalating violence, they are treating people whether white or black/brown as human beings! #wtpBlue                         https://t.co/bLraxgNsHx
