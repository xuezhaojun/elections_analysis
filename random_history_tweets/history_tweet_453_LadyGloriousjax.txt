1344065367090589698 2020-12-30 07:38:49 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> The people who voted for him are an embarrassment to America.

1343344940223508482 2020-12-28 07:56:06 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> He is such an embarrassment to Florida. One day, we will trun the state of Florida 'Blue' and will not have to deal with the likes of "Little Marco."
1343343240980930560 2020-12-28 07:49:21 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> It is time for an investigation of McConnell. His lopsided landslide is definitely a suspicious situation.

1342326653524058112 2020-12-25 12:29:48 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> tRump ran on a platform of 'draining the swamp.' He didn't drain the swamp, he filled his own personal swamp with his own swamp creatures, alligators, and crocodiles which is evidence by those he pardoned.

1318616943021142016 2020-10-21 02:15:52 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> Is DeSantis just as evil as his boss tRump? It's time for DeSantis to GO! In the next election, he must GO! Killing people via the virus is not going to help the GOP. All of them must go from the federal to the state and on to the local.
1318614916702572547 2020-10-21 02:07:49 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> Happy Birthday to an awesome lady!

1318612477765091333 2020-10-21 01:58:07 +0800 <LadyGloriousjax> Happy Birthday, our dear Madam Vice President! May your day be filled with love, joy, and laughter.
