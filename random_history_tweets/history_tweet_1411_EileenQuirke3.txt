This is like saying a Bank Robber could be caught looting the US Treasury, and his Accomplice then makes the decision as to whether or not he can carry on looting. A decision would never be made against themselves would it.

1343839984583905281 2020-12-29 16:43:14 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> McConnell's election needs to be investigated. Numbers do not add up, before - where support for McGrath was very high compared to extremely low for Mitch - or at election where nonsensical support for Mitch suddenly appeared, from out of nowhere. Fishy.

1343347769772101632 2020-12-28 08:07:21 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Trump is not capable of making a deal. He's such a dimwit, he knows he would make a right fool of himself. He would be horrendously humiliated because he has put himself in a place of mass ridicule. Now he can't close a deal to get himself out of a hole he dug. Forever a Fool.

It would likely have dragged Biden into it, which would have given Trump even more reason to say fraud, rigged election BS

A pardon for him, and for his family, that means their criming is not fake news, it is reality. Trump crimes will be their undoing. So many charges, the Government and Legals will sue, Many people say the Trumps are in deep poo.
1335307914874155014 2020-12-06 03:39:50 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Has Giuliani had his hand in her pants as well as well as his own?
1335301431704875009 2020-12-06 03:14:04 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Those Trumpers are mentally deficient. They are just deliberately baiting the Country with their denials. Another version of the Tis/Tisn't.   Tis/Tisn't.   Tis/Tisn't. Game.  21st January 2021 is Game Over for Republicans.
1335118561354928128 2020-12-05 15:07:24 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> This is  what I find so damned unbelievable -  all Republicans, base, donors, Representatives and Senators all know Trump is making money off their backs and it's going into one Trump account or another for his own use. Republican voters are suffering, but let Trump do this.

1332817855906263042 2020-11-29 06:45:14 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Because you seem to have way more than your fair share of very very gullible people.
1332783671485607938 2020-11-29 04:29:23 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> What a bunch of hypocrites the Republicans are.  The whole party will be despised for decades.
1332739083941142531 2020-11-29 01:32:13 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Excellent. Great talent there. ❤
1332738342308474881 2020-11-29 01:29:16 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> How can Trump be classed as a billionaire if he is in debt for over 1 billion dollars. Over 400 million dollars due to be paid back in the next few years, which he hasn't got.  It doesn't make sense to call him a billionaire if he owes money and can't pay.?
1332735593495875584 2020-11-29 01:18:21 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Why not? They should. With a vengeance. The Grim Reaper is a kindly person in comparison to Moscow Mitch.
1332728770608963585 2020-11-29 00:51:14 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> This is something that needs to be very seriously considered. Too many shady deals in the background, and Trump has given no reason for anyone to believe he is trustworthy in any way. Quite the opposite in fact.
1332596647398940672 2020-11-28 16:06:13 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Greed. Bezos is a class example of it's all for me. Mine. Not yours.  Why does he not want to treat his workforce with respect?  His kind of management is akin to being a slave owner on a plantation.

1332234577201475584 2020-11-27 16:07:29 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Oh, what's the betting that he will have that area re-landscaped / re-designed because that area is not fair to him. He was robbed of a possible good shot by that water, it's rigged against him and that's unfair. He had a top score there, then it all disappeared.
1332086813398327297 2020-11-27 06:20:19 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I thank God that there are people like Michael Jordan, and all the other people who step up for those who are struggling to just get by right now. Goodness still exists because like the A. Vindman said Right Matters.🙏
1331978857021321218 2020-11-26 23:11:21 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Sad but true, religion is a business venture like any other business. They want their bit of profit regardless of people getting sick. Pay per pray?
1331936090589114369 2020-11-26 20:21:24 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Come on people,  in this time of trauma and suffering, spare some compassion for this young woman, the atrocities committed by Trump and co go unpunished, Reality was imprisoned by sadistic people purposely seeking a cruel revenge sentence. Gop hate whistleblowers.
1331451395149619200 2020-11-25 12:15:24 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Good.  It should end.  It is obsolete.
1331281803651538945 2020-11-25 01:01:30 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> She is another fool. A mouthy fool at that.

1331242311913713670 2020-11-24 22:24:35 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Precisely. That is why we have people called psychiatrists/Psychologists who train to understand the troubled ones. Anything else call it out for what it is,  lies, fraud, criming, etc. All the things that Repubs have just done.
1331179209520271360 2020-11-24 18:13:50 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Dear Lord. This speaks volumes. Please read, share and understand. 🙏

1331146688711548929 2020-11-24 16:04:36 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes, that's the start of a good result then.  Down even further would be icing on the cake.  https://t.co/0ldGV2PTZ5
1331142971631267840 2020-11-24 15:49:50 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> My opinion,  is. He's still living. He will never change, always a prick. Just varying degrees of how cruel and how evil a prick he will be.
1331140944826077185 2020-11-24 15:41:47 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Tell Lindsey Graham that EC should be ended, absolutely right, without a doubt. It's the only way to end the Repubs cheating and frauding elections. One man one vote works everywhere else in the world, EC obsolete and criminally used now.
1331138002635149312 2020-11-24 15:30:05 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> This can be rectified if some European and American billionaires do a special one off crowd sourcing  deal between themselves, and chip in a billion dollars each to fund two brand new planes. It's not impossible, just get onit someone, Dems have raised campaign money this way.
1331123539567648769 2020-11-24 14:32:37 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Will you cover Trump 2021 when all the charges roll in?  That will be payback for all that criming, it will be a pleasure to watch all of that family trying to stay out of jail.
1331063069485764608 2020-11-24 10:32:20 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> #TrumpTheFool Start packing Trumpy, you're being evicted.
1330954046123995138 2020-11-24 03:19:07 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> This point MUST be driven home. Biden/Harris must accept Trump and co are to be prosecuted. Your nation is going through so much suffering, on so many fronts. Right does matter. Being a criminal does matter. There must be consequences for all the criming they have done.
1330815370136084483 2020-11-23 18:08:04 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Please watch. 🙏💙

1330111518885732355 2020-11-21 19:31:13 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Who cares, as long as Democrats Warnock and Ossoff win the the run offs, the supporters can trash the Republicans as much as they want to.   Go ahead.
1330064434073657344 2020-11-21 16:24:07 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> 11 hours, at least. Maybe 11 days. Graham needs to testify about his attempts to pervert the voting system.  Graham needs to testify why he said he called other officials to pervert their voting systems.  The officials deny his calls, and don't condone his actions
1330037817259470849 2020-11-21 14:38:21 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Make it so. This election has set a precedent, future results will be mired in sabotage and recounts. The Republicans will do all of this cheating time after time. They have eroded the norms of decency and honesty in elections. It needs to stop. No more EC Votes.
1330035405098463232 2020-11-21 14:28:46 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> They're hypocritical beyond words.

1329411493075488773 2020-11-19 21:09:33 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Without a doubt,  yes they should be prosecuted. All of them.
1329404401040171009 2020-11-19 20:41:23 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Let's add unforgettable to that list, remember the shameful Republicans at every vote, year in year out. Holidays? How many people will struggle to make even basic food for a meal. How many are in arrears. Republicans are Scum.

1325213429657870336 2020-11-08 07:07:57 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> That's about right then for Trump and Giuliani, next to a sex shop.  One can't keep his hand out of his pants. The other can't keep his hands out of other people's pants. 🤣😂
1325209887995908096 2020-11-08 06:53:53 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Have you found him yet? They seek him here. They seek him there. Trump's still hollering "it's not fair". Barr's gone dark. Methinks he is planning, something most evil, for the Trump's to do scamming.Criming and Grifting is what they do best.Leaving it to you to add the rest.

1325049319968432128 2020-11-07 20:15:50 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> There should be some investigation of the Murdoch's influence in all of this. They control the Media and Press the same as Trump controls Republicans.
1325048500162322432 2020-11-07 20:12:35 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes definitely,  I'm pleased to hear that there are others who follow US politics. I have been a keen follower for some years now.  Good luck for a call very soon for a Biden win.🙏💙💙💙💙

1324840281536167936 2020-11-07 06:25:12 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Is there a Murdoch influence entangled in this nonsense playing out now.
1324836293533179905 2020-11-07 06:09:21 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> From  across the pond, something looks to be extremely off in your Country regarding the election/Trump and Co. Results.  Recount. Results not called. Shouldn't Biden/Harris be making their own case in court against all the malarkey the Republicans are doing.
1324773605792718852 2020-11-07 02:00:15 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I just cannot take this man seriously anymore.  Too many times he put his word out there, only to shamefully rescind it and fall back into line. More flip flops than Lindsey Graham's old beach shoes.

1324752446913216513 2020-11-07 00:36:10 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Make sure you keep on sharing this, they all need a reminder every week of the fact they are all up to their necks in corrupt shit of one description or another.  None should be allowed to walk away, criming and grifting carries penalties.

1324725135186812928 2020-11-06 22:47:39 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> @kayleighmcenany God spoke to the Pope. The Pope said do not vote for Trump, he is not a Christian. The people listened to the Pope. And now we have  President Elect Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris. Now go wash your dirty lying mouth out with plenty of soap.
1324720289079611392 2020-11-06 22:28:23 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> The Murdoch's have got things to answer for, in court.  No soft play here, they have condoned the most evil atrocities carried out by Trump and co. Their influence on the suffering of America needs to be severely addressed.
1324718527685758980 2020-11-06 22:21:23 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I'm curious.  Would the slow counting process in Nevada be somewhat tied into this angle, making time for Trump to play out his court actions for voter fraud and stopping the vote count in his favour.

Does that mean you that you are admitting that you are ready to concede that you have lost the election. Wise decision Sir. There is no path for you to win. So much humiliation for you.

1319312809772093440 2020-10-23 00:21:00 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Question is, what skanky things is below the Barr Billy working on, out of sight, and will it be let loose after Trump loses. Before January.

1318917967447556103 2020-10-21 22:12:02 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Maybe.  Which other of his various accounts received secret funds?
1318802584925315072 2020-10-21 14:33:33 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I don't doubt that Trump has multiple undisclosed accounts or that campaign money has been siphoned off into various accounts.  Rainy day funds in case he loses the election, needs to flee to avoid prison etc. Most likely all the money scams, of all descriptions, totals billions.

1318298437415260161 2020-10-20 05:10:14 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> The Murdoch's again at the heart of of corruption, condoning Ghouliani and co  and aiding their criminal activities. The Murdoch's need to be on trial, Fox and everything else needs to be prosecuted.
1318285285491417088 2020-10-20 04:17:59 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Word is that Trump is going down.  Loss will be even bigger next week. People voting in droves for Biden. No contest anymore. Biden will win.  Keep voting Blue.

1318277001694879746 2020-10-20 03:45:04 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I certainly hope he isn't doing a moonlight flit, because he's got a lot of criming to answer for. The only new abode he requires is prison. I don't trust him at all, an out of sight Barr is likely involved in some  more criming.
1317921047207989250 2020-10-19 04:10:38 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Absolutely correct. Trump will become just a dirty stain in history.

1316790002446147589 2020-10-16 01:16:16 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I wonder. Is he getting jittery about getting his ass used off. Covid deaths, fox disinformation, manslaughter, rioting etc, there is much there to frighten him.
1316787772800348160 2020-10-16 01:07:24 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Idiot media, as usual. Brainless sheeples. Herd mentality.

1316755449719459840 2020-10-15 22:58:58 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Quickly go back to court and get them removed by any means possible.We need a blue Tsunami win in Cal.
1316705033585651713 2020-10-15 19:38:37 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> The press/media coverage has, controlled by who owns them. Murdoch's for a start. At some point this should be looked at.
1316700320743993346 2020-10-15 19:19:54 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Though I would like this story to be true, I have some doubts. Are we being played here, for some reason? Tis the season of trick or treat, and we know their tricks only too well.
1316665507983118341 2020-10-15 17:01:34 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Because they really don't believe that they will lose the election. They are convinced Russia will win it for them, and are so much in denial of a loss, they will not accept what their eyes see right now. People are voting Biden/Harris in huge droves, Blue all the way.
1316651668969226240 2020-10-15 16:06:34 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Everyone should just watch Joe Biden. If you must, just catch the highlights of the Trump spin show later.
1316554378506121216 2020-10-15 09:39:58 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> #TrumpsTheBiggestLiarEver The people of America will have the last big laugh at Trump very soon. When Trump vacates the White House the whole world will laugh, and Biden/Harris will be received with joy and relief, by everyone.

1316357921605902336 2020-10-14 20:39:19 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> The solution is don't watch Trump. Let's see his ratings drop through the floor. While Biden's ratings go through the roof. Go Joe.🌊🌊

1312846534879383552 2020-10-05 04:06:20 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Don't forget Trumps dear friend Kim Jong Un staged a disappearance for a short time.  Then when the whole world was wondering  ???  He suddenly re-appeared without any explanation. If Trump is still pulling the strings,  could this be election related, or covid19 for real.
1312844511291338752 2020-10-05 03:58:17 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Why are they behaving like inbred goons? I can't wait to see how they deal with life after January 2021. Will they ever be able to move on and become normal people again?
1312830896593154056 2020-10-05 03:04:11 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Hell yes, says America.

1312828640376356866 2020-10-05 02:55:13 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> By no way, is she of the right mind or ethics for this particular job. Barrett is obviously going to apply  badly slewed rulings for decades, merely for the reason of prowess, rather than justice. But, that's the Republican party under Trump, talking/acting like inbred goons.

1309233545882329094 2020-09-25 04:49:36 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> 🙏
1309233292189855750 2020-09-25 04:48:35 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes that's right, I'm British, living here in U.K. It is truly horrendous to see what is happening in US. Praying for a Biden win so you can start to repair the damage done by Trump and the Republican party. There will be a painful time but, God willing, the healing will come.🙏

1309215957110468609 2020-09-25 03:39:42 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> BOO  And  VOTE  HE DESERVES TO BE BOOED  THEN VOTE HIM OUT
1309192029407244288 2020-09-25 02:04:38 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes, a much needed action. Thank you to every one of you.🙏
1309153554205212674 2020-09-24 23:31:44 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> @MittRomney Mitt do not say things that you do not mean or will not stand by.   Too much you have already done and said that says your soul has long gone, and you continue to put party over Country.  Double speak = lies.

1307824712924434432 2020-09-21 07:31:24 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> I can't help wondering if someone has used mass hypnosis or something like it on Repubs,  it would explain their sick agenda to break every law abiding rule in the book. What the hell has got into them to make them such a sad sick bunch of criminals.

God willing you will vote, but it will be for Biden/Harris. President Biden and V.P Harris will help you to heal and rebuild because they truly care.🙏

1306702159824719876 2020-09-18 05:10:46 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Just asking, what happens if something is released but insufficient numbers of people queue up for it, insufficient to be an election winner for Trump.  What does he do then, he can't force people to have it can he?
1306390831406997504 2020-09-17 08:33:40 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> @kylegriffin1 @_ReaalAmerican_ Manipulation of numbers. Numbers can be made to say whatever suits your theory at any given time.  Trump is too stupid and far gone to see that we're onto him.

1305474538453561350 2020-09-14 19:52:39 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes. This is another way of saying he can kill someone on 5th Avenue and get away with it.  Thousands are being killed now, and he is getting getting away with it. He truly does believe he is above the law, he's taunting America in every way he can.

1304277099319001088 2020-09-11 12:34:27 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> It would be an interesting Project for someone to observe how the Maga deal with truth and life after November 3.  When they've lost and Biden is President, how will Repubs face the horrendous consequences of what they have condoned for 4 years. It's been abnormal. Study needed.

1303797793211977728 2020-09-10 04:49:51 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Somehow it comes across that the Press powers that be, have been bought, Pro Quo - ed, Blackmailed or threatened in some other way. A few to remain silent = difference of opinion. For all to remain silent = full on complicity.

1303719277686644750 2020-09-09 23:37:52 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> How about making humour out of this, have a large POS sculpted - painted gold, of course, topped with a Trump head, and have it delivered to WH.
1303492201163489285 2020-09-09 08:35:33 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Probably that means Judges will look favourably on whatever crime, and you only serve half the time.
1303414920437002248 2020-09-09 03:28:27 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Ain't that the truth.
1303413532332118018 2020-09-09 03:22:57 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> @PressSec  OMG How did you not know that the Covid19 started in 2019 - that is what the 19 at the end represents. It has got no connection whatsoever with Obama/Biden. You are one hell of a brazen foul mouthed liar. Yes you meant to throw dirt, we all know you did.
1303397330423603201 2020-09-09 02:18:34 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Even if Trump does put money into his campaign,  it still will not make up for the tax payers$$$ that have been paid to his businesses for security accomodation expenses at his proerties etc.etc.etc bailing out of wealthy businesses and grifters.
1303232847004741632 2020-09-08 15:24:58 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Yes, exactly. Follow the money is going to be an epic journey in so many aspects. So, when Biden/Harris government has finally traced it, will Trumps properties be confiscated in lieu of re-payment of miss spent tax payers $$$.
1303200013821018112 2020-09-08 13:14:30 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> No more fake stuff.  You will just distract support from the good people fighting to rid the Country of the Trump Cancer. Don't spoil it for everyone. Get creative with your funnies of Trump AFTER  Biden/Harris WIN on November 3.😊
1303093319543783428 2020-09-08 06:10:32 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Mike Ponce is an insidious vile two faced hypocrite.
1302828464953798658 2020-09-07 12:38:06 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> ✋
1302825597438234624 2020-09-07 12:26:42 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Is there a possible glimmer of hope here, so far not a word against Trump and complicit in all he does, Repubs have boxed themselves into a corner, 58 days left, no way out now even if they no longer support Trump. Mich &amp; co must be having gut wrenching fears about 59th day etc.
1302357770960855042 2020-09-06 05:27:43 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Very ironic seeing that Trumps re-election campaign is going down as well. Republicans,  this is a bad omen for you on November 3. Trump is jinxed. ByeDon.
1302013476093784064 2020-09-05 06:39:37 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Whatever Russia has on Trump must be very substantial. How much does he fear being the next victim of Russian poisoning?
1301567292854218752 2020-09-04 01:06:39 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Barr has come from a legal background, so how can he not know that voting twice anywhere is illegal. How can he not know?
1301057220260528128 2020-09-02 15:19:48 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> A self damning Trump mess that he alone created. Trump owns this.  Vote him out.
1300912146684022784 2020-09-02 05:43:20 +0800 <EileenQuirke3> Susan Collins is just a Yo Yo mouth - no I'm not Yes I am No I'm not  Yes I am  Her one brain cell is tired and dizzy from all that spinning. Why doesn't she stop running her mouth. At this point  no one believes her anymore.  A has been who will be retired after November 3.
