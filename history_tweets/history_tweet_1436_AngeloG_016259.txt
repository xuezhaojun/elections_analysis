1326267533599666179 2020-11-11 04:56:35 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> Democrats are exposing their true colors. Huge gatherings of Biden supporters &amp; Dem. Party Leaders (Chuck Schumer &amp; others) are seen throughout the country without masks. COVID was reason Dems. had mail-in-ballots. More hypocrisy, lies to come.
1326267386857725961 2020-11-11 04:56:00 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN?!!! Whether Joe Biden is president - elect or not he still needs to be investigated for crimes. Democrats stressed for 4 years that no one is above the law. It’s best for America to find out now before he continues his criminal activities when president.
1326267199183597568 2020-11-11 04:55:15 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> There must be a nationally televised statement informing citizens the 2020 election is NOT OFFICIALLY over. Neither President Trump or Joe Biden have been officially declared a winner or loser. Media has no authority to call an election. They can only report the results.
1326264195617333249 2020-11-11 04:43:19 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> Pres. Trump exposed &amp; drained some of DC swamp &amp; it's many arms, Democrats &amp; biased media for who they are, voter fraud &amp; strengthened the country where weak. President Trump was nominated for 3 Noble Peace Prizes. Many more accomplishments to speak of. All were done in 1 term.
1326028118142939136 2020-11-10 13:05:14 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> If a president is elected based on personality or how they speak Joe Biden wins. President Trump has more energy &amp; stamina than a 21-year-old. He kept his promises &amp; got things done where presidents before him couldn’t. He did this mainly single-handedly &amp; against all odds.
1325962172481097728 2020-11-10 08:43:11 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> Members of the Democratic Party are pushing for President Trump to concede election. They are feeling the heat of illegal votes possibly being found in several states that haven’t been officially called. If nothing to hide there should be no reason to worry.

We must find evidence, prove it beyond a shadow of doubt &amp; with judges unafraid to decide the case. That’s the hard part.

Media has no legal authority to call winner; can only report winner. States needed for win not called &amp; in courts for rulings. Blame Media &amp; Biden if results go other way. Irresponsible!
1325886487972425736 2020-11-10 03:42:27 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> @MILLANDALUZ Claiming an unofficial victory is the most irresponsible &amp; dangerous thing Biden &amp; the media could ever have done. He wants to be the great uniter. If election goes the other way Biden will be the country’s greatest divider. Add this to all the bad decisions he made in 47 years.
1325685494303367168 2020-11-09 14:23:46 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> Thousands of Biden votes are alleged illegal.

1325273655962644481 2020-11-08 11:07:16 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> The election is not officially over. Joe Biden claims to be President elect and Kamala Harris claims she is the 1st black &amp; 1st woman to be Vice President elect. Wouldn’t it be something if Joe Biden winds up losing.
1325237087529029634 2020-11-08 08:41:58 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> @larryelder The election is far from over. Is this the way people who claim they won to act? They are the real dividers of this nation. They prove it every day by burning American flags, businesses &amp; homes; by rioting, beating &amp; killing people; by not allowing freedom of speech; etc...
1325231706434117633 2020-11-08 08:20:35 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> Below is an example why Electoral College is used.  John won 2 states with a total population of 30 billion people all voting for him. Omar won 48 states with a combined population of 10 billion people all voting for him. Is it fair that only 2 states represent the whole country?

Knowing this with a country that is said to be divided, it is totally irresponsible for the news media, Joe Biden or anyone else to call the election over and Biden the winner.
1325148796125401090 2020-11-08 02:51:07 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> NEWSMAX may be one of or the only televised news channel that has not called the election for President over. Their decision not to claim a winner should be considered sensible and responsible. There is enough division in this country caused by the Democrats and the news media.

1324930515326152706 2020-11-07 12:23:45 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> President Trump fought hard &amp; steady as a proud true American for his country &amp; it’s people. Everything &amp; the kitchen sink was thrown at him the past 4 years and yet he stands. He will continue to fight for the USA until the day he dies. Now he needs the people to fight for him.
1324923524709036032 2020-11-07 11:55:58 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> The diarrhea coming out of the mouths of all those people singing “ding dong the witch is dead” may have to drink their words. President Trump is still in the game. It’s not over until the fat lady sings.

The Democrat party knew this &amp; changed the rules close to election day using COVID as an excuse. President Trump &amp; anyone with common sense knew there would be problems validating each vote. President Trump will prevail again.
1324469316234973184 2020-11-06 05:51:07 +0800 <AngeloG_016259> There may have been cheating by Clinton &amp; Democrats during the 2016 Clinton / Trump election but it didn’t work out. This may be why Clinton still can’t except her loss. Biden &amp; the Democrats are hoping they got better at it in 2020. They will be exposed and lose again. MAGA

Using &amp; abusing The Russia Probe Hearing for a political ploy for trying to get Joe Biden elected is disgraceful.

Trump is not the reason you lost control of your city. You let it go &amp; refused Trump's offer to help. You have blood on your hands.

As the virus spread, they blamed Trump for not acting sooner. Remove COVID-19 from this scenario and replace it with rioting in Democrat run cities.
