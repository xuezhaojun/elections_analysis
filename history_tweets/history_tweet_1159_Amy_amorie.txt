1343942021854146561 2020-12-29 23:28:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GlRrespecter That's it exactly, I hold no hatred for any other group, race or ethnicity, I simply want to preserve my own. That isn't hate but surely a deeper love.

(England) the loss of native culture and its traditions etc. What matters is the indigenous population becoming a minority in their own homelands.

1343836327079505921 2020-12-29 16:28:42 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @LadBonnie So BAME people dont want to go to the countryside because there are are white people there doing things that white people do .. in England. Then I would say the racism is theirs. So if go to Nigeria I can instantly call racism because their rural areas are too black?

1343584496004648960 2020-12-28 23:48:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Fragola_Girl @sakkoira No, it directly calls for white women to abort their babies because they are white, Its then justified with the lie of white privilege and oppression and any objection is labelled racist. The tweet is anti-white and calls for violence against us and you condone it. Please think.
1343582417165103105 2020-12-28 23:39:45 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Fragola_Girl @sakkoira Would you not say that calling for unborn children to be aborted for nothing more than the colour of their skin is anti-white sentiment?

1343563628948152324 2020-12-28 22:25:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> Can I direct your attention to this wonderful site.

I want to help promote our identity and foster in us a need for our own well being. The site is fantastic 🌺
1343510749767987202 2020-12-28 18:54:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @PengilleyIan @J1bbs Which is in part my point, how this narrative is being adopted as fact by our institutions and pushed as an undeniable, immutable truth into our societies.

1343243367879208960 2020-12-28 01:12:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AgreeableBandit @FlowersHughes So once again the white privilege argument is used to effectively deny white elderly people a potentially life saving treatment. This very action negates the fact of actual privilege and exposes the hypocrisy of this argument. Not to mention showing the contempt they hold for us.
1343227226695872512 2020-12-28 00:08:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AgreeableBandit @FlowersHughes Do you maybe have a link to the article please?

1343130151626928128 2020-12-27 17:42:36 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @TheBrownBomber0 @FortressEvropa With respect, its not just this tweet but a narrative that's being pushed, it's in the mainstream of our societies and academia. And it often just gets a free pass it's being normalised that racial hatred towards white people is ok. Becoming a minority for us is a bleak prospect.

1343006764078391296 2020-12-27 09:32:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @SicilianSky @Europinion_ Thank you🌺
1343005209329618947 2020-12-27 09:26:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @FortressEvropa As I'm beginning to see and being subject to the whims of a majority that has been led to hate us will be a terrifying and bleak future😔
1342999660089274368 2020-12-27 09:04:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> I was raised to accept everyone, to be kind, empathetic &amp; accepting of others &amp; I lived by that. But recently as ive become aware of the level of hate thats openly directed at white people I'm starting to become racially insular, turning my love &amp; devotion solely toward my own.  https://t.co/sUaQHiApm2

1342980911688769543 2020-12-27 07:49:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Thank you, I will have a look ❤
1342978127220396033 2020-12-27 07:38:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ They openly say this and no one is alarmed!? It's so disconcerting.  Maybe we could make one ourselves that tells the true story. The urgency of building our own communities and working for white wellbeing is  becoming clearer the more I understand. We live in their system now.
1342966716536680449 2020-12-27 06:53:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ As a suggestion maybe creating a website that you could direct people to which explains the beauty and true meaning of these symbols in order to educate people and counter the propaganda that's used to get our heritage historical ancestry banned? ❤🌿

Whilst I am proud of my European heritage and ancestry I for one so many more want to be rid of the EU and these sanctimonious EU globalists as soon as possible.

1342758808339279878 2020-12-26 17:07:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 @YouTube Exactly, when you are woken up you see through the charade and begin to notice how insidiously they have corrupted us through every medium. Maybe the cure lies in the revival of wholesome endeavours and a reconnection to ourselves as a people. ❤🌿

1342746426808406021 2020-12-26 16:17:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MitfordUv I feel little but contempt for these people when they happily promote their own beliefs while trying to deny Christians theirs. Projecting their evils on to others is to push a narrative of oppression in the guise of victimhood. He cries out in pain as he strikes you.  https://t.co/fDNxGxd2Ks

Clear evidence of the structural racism that's endemic in Britain's institutions, this is what happens when whiteness is allowed to fester unchecked! We need to diversify  urban britain!

Couple that with low birth rates of the indigenous peoples &amp; soon they will be an ever decreading minorities in their own homelands. It's not about hating others it's simply preserving ourselves.

1341365656277704705 2020-12-22 20:51:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @TurfingPoint @huffy58 @retrospare @PatAltEast Yes, cultural change happens naturally, but mass immigration is not a natural progression but a forced occurrence. Statues represent our history the views of these changing is due the influence of multiculturalism. Surely your argument here merely proves my point.
1341360695745638401 2020-12-22 20:31:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF__UK88 No!!! Work hard .. mush, mush! 🤣

We are already seeing the erasure of our history through removal of statues and road names our identity &amp; uniqueness is being replaced as we move closer to a minority.

Britain is a white country we dont have to justify why we want it to remain so. No more than Nigeria has to or Japan.

How about we stop mass immigration, deport immigrants with a criminal record or who break the law, stop all the special benefits for BME &amp; introduce incentivised repatriation
1341075013529694209 2020-12-22 01:36:13 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet Indeed and its beauty very much needs our protection if it is to survive.

1340727563816198146 2020-12-21 02:35:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @stillgray Professor? It makes me wonder when academics come out with this fluff how exactly they pass their doctoral degrees .. by asking for two points instead of one on their social justice thesis it would seem.
1340723045997154305 2020-12-21 02:17:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @retrospare @PatAltEast Hello :) Can you perhaps point to any part of the leaflet that isn't factual?. You're passionate about racism? Then I'm sure will agree that indigenous people being made an ever decreasing minority in their homeland is the worst act of racism.
1340715516227428353 2020-12-21 01:47:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ We are only allowed an identity when it's in the negative so our very existence is abhorrent. Subscription to this ideology only gives us one recourse, to deny who we are and everything of us and become absorbed into the darkness as atomised individuals always held to account.
1340712852102008832 2020-12-21 01:37:07 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ It seems our defining identity is being rewritten and we have been removed from the script of our own masterpiece.😔

1340695231403073538 2020-12-21 00:27:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Its infuriating but the true frustration is that we have allowed it to get to this point where madness and hypocrisy are embraced as virtuous and sanity is labelled as evil. 😐

I was shocked also when I was shown this, please just look with an open mind it's not about hate🌺  https://t.co/SvUpLyIhpo
1340199699089936384 2020-12-19 15:38:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ How could anyone not ..  but how many will have heard of the holodomor genocide😔🙏
1339990490377314306 2020-12-19 01:46:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 I have got to get me a pair of those!!! That's just cute me wants lol. Have wonderful day big hugs to you and yours 🌺❤🌺
1339983513748168713 2020-12-19 01:19:00 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AQuantumCat1 @EternalEnglish That's very much the same as me. It's a very bitter sweet feeling. One of loss and I'm ashamed to say a growing sense of anger and one of awe and reverence coupled with longing at what we can have if given self determination and homogeneity.
1339964850907320321 2020-12-19 00:04:50 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AvfcsteveSd I abhor violence but this man, this dad, was defending his daughter who was put in danger by our weak institutions and government who bend to left wing insanity to appease the screaming minority bred by left wing infested academia. A big hug and thank you to this man❤🌺
1339961344142024708 2020-12-18 23:50:54 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @fight_far @lady_kel2 @tonydr0 @Mimi190447 Yes, and yet despite all that they still targeted white English girls in heinous acts driven by their own desires and racial hatred. Covered up by their community. They partake of our culture but never become part of it.
1339927064879779840 2020-12-18 21:34:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mimi190447 So it would seem. Another victim of the false narrative and indoctrination, unable to think for himself merely parroting the anti british/anti-white rhetoric. It's sad what they are doing to us😔
1339920970614796290 2020-12-18 21:10:28 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AQuantumCat1 @EternalEnglish This is beautiful and a testament to what we are losing! We must fight to stop this corruption and return our lands to a beacon of our bio spirit. A safe haven we preserve for our children and all our future generations❤🙏
1339917198224216065 2020-12-18 20:55:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF_UK88 Yes I've noticed there can be some who foolishly get caught in a purity spiral, your not a real nationalist or pro white enough if you dont agree with everything I say! .. ego battles divide us😔
1339916329625788417 2020-12-18 20:52:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @DavidHerning @EternalEnglish They surrender to the narrative of false guilt for the original sin of slavery and oppression that we will forever be accountable for in order to signal a false virtue.😔
1339910430769221633 2020-12-18 20:28:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish Summed up very well.

1339909676117487618 2020-12-18 20:25:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF_UK88 Theres always room for a pro white coffee drinker sweetie lol ❤🌺
1339908588958048258 2020-12-18 20:21:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @fight_far @tonydr0 @Mimi190447 British of immigrant descent and therefore over represented by demographic percentage in the incidence of grooming gangs who targeted a specific group in part based on their race (white girls) in which the abuse included a racial element.

1339902629867106305 2020-12-18 19:57:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF_UK88 😱 you dont drink tea!! Thats just not cricket old chap! Lol though I must confess to being partial to the odd coffee myself .. shhhh! 😁
1339901493814681600 2020-12-18 19:53:04 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @fight_far @tonydr0 @Mimi190447 With respect I'm afraid you're wrong on this. Holding a british citizenship doesnt make you ethnically british, you merely live here. If i move to China do i instantly become Chinese?🌺
1339899060447293440 2020-12-18 19:43:24 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF_UK88 Oh no poor you! Get yourself in the warm as soon as possible with a nice hot cup of grandma towlers tea! .. lovely❄☕❤
1339897229478404097 2020-12-18 19:36:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Win86Moore @SpergFestive The long march through the institutions.
1339896849583452160 2020-12-18 19:34:37 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @SpergFestive @GreenManEng Theres always a reason why it never applies to us but is sacred to everyone else. Of course the real reason being so they can use it to place us in eternal guilt for colonialism but not allow us the same protections. We know who we are and they can never take that from us❤🌿
1339894849043111936 2020-12-18 19:26:40 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JackChambersGB @GreenManEng Isn't it lovely☃️❤

1339892810221281280 2020-12-18 19:18:34 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 Yes thats what I noticed no one was speaking english. Then some more diversity jumped in the middle doors and refused to get off so we all just sat there for an age until the next one came behind then a mad crush to get onboard. Horrible!
1339891422397411328 2020-12-18 19:13:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ReaICosy @potentcogency They are noticing! 😉❤
1339890846641106945 2020-12-18 19:10:46 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @PatriotActive66 The true cost of immigration😔
1339890169458159617 2020-12-18 19:08:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 My goodness, the last time I used a bus here in london it was an awful experience, not the bus itself but the atmosphere. Unless my journey was absolutely essential I would never use public transport.
1339886862996008960 2020-12-18 18:54:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 While the elites live in an earthly paradise untouched and untouchable.
1339886205530476544 2020-12-18 18:52:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JF_UK88 I'm very well thank you😊 .. yourself?
1339885207936221184 2020-12-18 18:48:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 It seems they look to bring us down to the lowest social denominator. We will all be equal in misery and squalor tearing at each other for meagre scraps while virtue and morals become alien concepts. We cannot let this happen!
1339879235410927616 2020-12-18 18:24:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 @YouTube Thank you ❤

1339877421332525056 2020-12-18 18:17:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 @YouTube It can be a bit grim cant it. I wish I had a window to look of. Our dept is in the basement there are no windows and in the winter it's dark when I leave for work and dark when I come home, I dont see daylight much. Something to cheer us up perhaps, better days are coming🌞  https://t.co/YoAREDJcRj

1339862515535241216 2020-12-18 17:18:11 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AQuantumCat1 I hope so too! maybe a bad case of mange or parasitic infection and shaving the fur was part of the treatment?   From a style point of view, most definitely a faux pas! Hehe 😇
1339859375779966976 2020-12-18 17:05:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @PatrickWimaxf @AQuantumCat1 Oh you're just mean .. made me giggle though, oh now I'm mean 😯

Thank you to everyone for showing that if we come together we can achieve positive results and fight this anti British narative. Big thanks of course to @_SaveOurStatues for his continued hard work❤🌺
1339570317489025025 2020-12-17 21:57:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet They are indeed corrupted and it's heartbreaking that many are beyond help as they simply dont want to be saved from the future they work to bring about😔

1339319803786506244 2020-12-17 05:21:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish That's to put it mildly I think. They say strength through adversity but I think we could all use a break right about now🌿

Yes without the nationalist ideology and white positive mindset it would never last as diversity would just creep in as it always does. 🌺

The goal will always be to regain our countries and return them to and keep them majority indigenous ♥️🌺

1339258336030625798 2020-12-17 01:17:24 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AQuantumCat1 Nicely done lol 😊🌺
1339240116922036227 2020-12-17 00:05:00 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AkuraElvas @Europinion_ Couple that with indigenous english having a birth rate below replacement levels and it's not going to take long for this conspiracy theory to become the harsh reality😔
1339238838699438090 2020-12-16 23:59:55 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Ah I see .. but any positive is cancelled because of the robust arguments of Racist, nazi, white supremacy, racist, nazi  Makes perfect sense right!? 🙃

1339141941280321536 2020-12-16 17:34:53 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG Again that's a generous kindness thank you. There are several I have bought, the fall of western man, born guilty and the strange death of europ  but I will certainly add going free and give it my focus.❤
1339138798446387201 2020-12-16 17:22:24 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG Thank you I expected a very harsh reception when I started this journey but I've met nothing but lovely, normal people who's only hate is of what's being done to us.
1339137581905289221 2020-12-16 17:17:34 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG I have seen Mr Kohne on some youtube streams and he comes across as very intelligent and dedicated. I would be very grateful for any help you can give as whilst I'm doing my best .. frankly it's a minefield lol.
1339135699593945088 2020-12-16 17:10:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG I fear you give me too much credit but thank you for the kindness❤ I'm sorry to say until about a month ago I was on the left (shame) but I got woken up. But I'm learning from good people.
1339131535123996674 2020-12-16 16:53:32 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @scouse55352862 @Europinion_ Enough said .. any other recommendations or are they all the same?
1339131003793760258 2020-12-16 16:51:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG The oppression of truth to propagate the narrative and in the absence of truth there is only the lie. Our future generations will be utterly at their mercy .. insidious. How do we stop this! Does anyone have the answers?
1339127258653618178 2020-12-16 16:36:32 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ I switched to duckduckgo as it was meant to be less woke and this seemed to be true with the "happy white woman search" but now it seems they are just as corrupt as Google.. are there any search engines that are not poisonous to white well being.
1339124889681326080 2020-12-16 16:27:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realSlaughtz @GroypGersh @NoWhiteGuiltNWG It would appear that Mr Orwells book 1984 was more a blueprint for the future.
1339123541510402050 2020-12-16 16:21:46 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ If by that she means we are no longer being obsequious to the mantra of Critical Race Theory then yes! .. And I very much intend to carry on.🌺
1339118854203641859 2020-12-16 16:03:09 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Not for me thank you.
1338950481582972935 2020-12-16 04:54:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @SarahOwen_ What part of this do you think is acceptable? I am an indigenous Briton, my ancestors are from NW european germanic tribes. How dare you say my ancestry doesnt exist. I am part of a unique ethnicity and neither you or anyone else gets to deny my right to that or MY homeland!
1338906131788410883 2020-12-16 01:57:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @oloiux Blackmail pics!!! Lol 😉🤣
1338898571198914561 2020-12-16 01:27:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @oloiux Dont believe you ..proof!? 😉❤🤣
1338791311948865537 2020-12-15 18:21:36 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JohnsonBullion I'm blocking you now as I have no desire to talk to a person who would use me to demean my own people.
1338781703175892992 2020-12-15 17:43:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Georgiesaurus28 @BrexitDuck Some dialects in England use 'mom' as opposed to 'mum' 🙂
1338781082376933381 2020-12-15 17:40:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BrexitDuck In clown world everything is possible.. I mean in what sane existence could you convince an entire race to loath themselves so much as to advocate for their own erasure while waxing lyrical about tolerance, equality and inclusion! 🤡🙃😡
1338778844178812928 2020-12-15 17:32:04 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @scouse55352862 Or take aways! I mean like who needs culture and self determination if it means no taxis or that late night curry .. it's not like we have recipes to follow or white people driving their own cars now is it!!! Grrr! These people are infuriating!
1338777256014045186 2020-12-15 17:25:45 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JohnsonBullion For the sake of the argument: it will eventually be African, whites will no longer exist but mass immigration from black countries will continue, all 'mixed' people will continue  to reproduce with blacks thus ever reducing the white mix .. white erasure.
1338775867229519873 2020-12-15 17:20:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JohnsonBullion I would say that your hypothesis of his meaning is based more on your penchant for using miscegenation to insult white people than any real interpretation.. given the content of your feed.
1338772170353369088 2020-12-15 17:05:33 +0800 <Amy_amorie> My goodness,  The hypocrisy of this .. sniveling sycophant is truly offensive!  Advocates for black lives.   "Who cares if there aren't any white people"   Espouses an ideology that seeks to end racism by white erasure..
1338766233802600448 2020-12-15 16:41:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Batch957 @BilbarCooks @Baddiel Have you any, ANY idea how offensive a statement that is! To say it doesn't matter if an entire race of people ceases to exist and then imply it would be a positive!  It appears BLM but not white lives. Please explain how you think this is acceptable?
1338627846210633728 2020-12-15 07:32:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ It is seductive and also insidious as its packaged as good, promoting love and tolerance manipulating good people into following it who genuinely believe they are on the right side. It's where I was at just a few weeks ago.
1338625439129083906 2020-12-15 07:22:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @RadicalLib @Europinion_ What a blessed achievement and a beautiful family. ♥️🙏

1338623350244040707 2020-12-15 07:14:11 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Something I've always wanted♥️
1338620074635169794 2020-12-15 07:01:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ The vulnerability and helplessness makes me want to hold them and nurture and protect .. and just snuggle that cute little face look at it!!! Lol sorry I will calm down now hormonal overload!!! Hehe x
1338618098182737922 2020-12-15 06:53:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Awww. Something in me just pulls at that! ♥️😊

1338605944822001664 2020-12-15 06:05:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng It's the same light that opened my eyes when I began this journey.. truth. I owe a debt to all the wonderful people that have answered my questions and shared that truth with me, now I carry it with also.❤🌿
1338603877260726280 2020-12-15 05:56:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng As I've found out to the point of sleepless nights😔

1338601540110733312 2020-12-15 05:47:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng A truly evil one at that.
1338599804423778304 2020-12-15 05:40:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Conditioned response!
1338598880469000197 2020-12-15 05:36:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I have seen this so much.
1338564544587833347 2020-12-15 03:20:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 @ianrmillard Been looking forward to this! Thank you ❤
1338427324589551616 2020-12-14 18:15:15 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 Whilst I know that Christ's temple is in my heart &amp; nothing can bar my connection to him I cannot help but feel a deep anguish over this. To deny a people spiritual sanctity &amp; healing at a time like this is despotic yet the worship of GDP &amp; mass immigration continues unabated.
1338415832024670215 2020-12-14 17:29:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MitfordUv Have a wonderful Christmas and  peace be with you❤🎄  https://t.co/LPU2zwqIGp

1338121806130143235 2020-12-13 22:01:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 I can only imagine the feeling of walking in a place like that. A connection to nature so beautiful is a gift that must be preserved.  I hope you dont mind my saying how you remind me of Marilyn Monroe, a timeless and elegant beauty 💗 God bless you all 🙏🌺
1338118127473864704 2020-12-13 21:46:37 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JcquAG @BritishAlba @BBCPolitics I may have accepted the truth of that idea but I will never get used to it. I will not just roll over and die.
1338107831728353281 2020-12-13 21:05:42 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I'm always an awfully good girl 😇😈
1338098880425177090 2020-12-13 20:30:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @voice_wales Given that the information on demographic change has been widely reported for many years in the media and backed by academic research could you perhaps point me to any part of the leaflet which is factually incorrect please?  https://t.co/qbMFkjSTTQ
1337893927165292545 2020-12-13 06:55:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Botanygeek That's a shame as I enjoy visiting kew. I wont be going anymore if they are adopting this anti-white sentiment.
1337893069807554563 2020-12-13 06:52:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Botanygeek @MattOnMyFace Perhaps you'd care to explain that rather offensive comment Mr Wong?

1337870323627290629 2020-12-13 05:21:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ My God what have they done to us! This is so sad😔

1337833509839396869 2020-12-13 02:55:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MMcNiggles Lol, sorry that was funny
1337832398634020868 2020-12-13 02:51:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MMcNiggles @val_tigress @EternalEnglish As I've been recently woken up too.
1337830369664577536 2020-12-13 02:43:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @SocialM85897394 Forgive me for stating the obvious but no riot police here charging and no heavy handed tactics or orders to shut it down! It's clear that selective application of the law is being applied for certain narratives. Political policing.
1337826770809221122 2020-12-13 02:28:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MMcNiggles @val_tigress @EternalEnglish Whilst I understand your sentiment and the feelings that invoke it the real criminals here are our own charlatan leaders, if they had even the slightest interest in protecting the indigenous people this would never have happened. The blame lies at their feet.
1337816417299820548 2020-12-13 01:47:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @jake_nippa @Europinion_ A sycophantic turncoat absent of all moral fibre and substance.
1337815766108921856 2020-12-13 01:45:08 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish I wonder how long after we become a hated minority that facet of critical race theory becomes a decree.
1337812686621511682 2020-12-13 01:32:54 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @demographics00 @EternalEnglish We wont if they get their way.
1337812084650881024 2020-12-13 01:30:30 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish Sometimes I wonder if when they express this level of anti-white hatred they work to our benefit in waking the sleeping majority? 🤔
1337810956781580289 2020-12-13 01:26:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> Its seems that white people doing anything can be now deemed as racist. This is just an excuse for anti-whites to push a hatred for us in the guise of antiracism.
1337781104586203142 2020-12-12 23:27:24 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @VGloves51 They are and this is where our women can be active to lead by example and be the best they can be. To show that femininity coupled with elegance is where true beauty and happiness lies⚘
1337780040810041350 2020-12-12 23:23:11 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 You have my support ❤
1337779769434365954 2020-12-12 23:22:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Return2LogiC @Adameganse @VGloves51 This exactly! And to my mind the only way to counter this is to come together &amp; advocate for us to build strong communities where we teach good values, morals and principles. We instil a love for who we are again and stand against the poison thats corrupted our people &amp; societies
1337777859511906305 2020-12-12 23:14:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 Do you have any groups or an organisation to promote white well being?
1337751122828816384 2020-12-12 21:28:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 Mark collett from Patriotic Alternative seems genuine and certainly cares for his people.
1337749682769055744 2020-12-12 21:22:33 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 The fight starts with us uniting I didn't mean we should physically fight ❤
1337746841690132480 2020-12-12 21:11:15 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 Then I suggest we starting fighting.
1337746310963851265 2020-12-12 21:09:09 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @val_tigress @EternalEnglish Immigrant woman who was known to have a severe mental health condition and a history of violence. Murders a 7 year old little girl after being allowed to stay in our country.   A 7 year old girl murdered on mother's day because our government has betrayed us for a percentage!😡😢
1337743111527804929 2020-12-12 20:56:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Adameganse @VGloves51 Yes! This is why its imperative that we unite, put aside our differences as we have a common aim and are facing an existential threat. We must come together and counter the pushed narrative that's used against us. Patriotic Alternative is doing a great job as are others.
1337729430416973825 2020-12-12 20:02:04 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 Exactly this, they corrupt us into sin and we pay for the privilege.
1337728261321854977 2020-12-12 19:57:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 And it's all backed by global corporations, promoted and pushed by media as good and progressive as we fall further into decadence and moral decay.
1337716650058067969 2020-12-12 19:11:17 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Oh god.. 😟

1337713624077438986 2020-12-12 18:59:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @jake_nippa @DevonshireDanUK Yes, so as to atomise us, strip us of our identity and connection to who we are and thus accept our replacement.

1337486902782472194 2020-12-12 03:58:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 @Europinion_ @Striker05381540 @RealChrisLangan @JackFell13 @superwife888 @ShereeJasmine1 @JTSmith1014 @Peacockx2 @dianemontagna @whitedatenet It's a wonderful blog and such a shame that Mr Millard was banned from twitter. His blog is a testament to his dedication to white well being and countering the anti-white narrative. ❤🙏
1337484813792645123 2020-12-12 03:50:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ I realise it's not everybody's cup of tea but it's a delightful dip into our culture and if nothing else it will be an evening of wholesome classical entertainment❤
1337472473013563396 2020-12-12 03:01:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Now you're talking my language! It's a wondeful experience to take in the ambience of the theatre and then be captivated and lost in the performance. Of course I may be a little biased as dance is a big part of my life lol ❤💃
1337459620458213381 2020-12-12 02:09:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JayHSalem @BigRiverSalmon Nature is beautiful and all life is precious .. but my gosh this makes me cringe! Stop holding it!!!! 😖
1337455198592262145 2020-12-12 01:52:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @OrwellNGoode Two morally deficit people, both are products of our corrupted societies.
1337424945194872834 2020-12-11 23:52:09 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Chris96215700 Its chilling isn't it and its becoming more and more normalized.
1337398451026468867 2020-12-11 22:06:53 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 Aww, thank you!❤🌿 I love you posts and the warmth and femininity you express its like a breath of fresh air in a world gone mad! ⚘🌺
1337395489331945474 2020-12-11 21:55:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ElfRising Omg! .. I shouldn't but that is just funny! 🤣🤣
1337394009061404673 2020-12-11 21:49:13 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Must .. resist!!!
1337307778768048134 2020-12-11 16:06:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 Winsome!? Such a lovely word that's fallen out of use. Perhaps because what it describes has fallen out of fashion. Like these beautiful words our traditions, morals and values needs to be revived. Beautiful works thank you❤🌿
1337204669236604932 2020-12-11 09:16:51 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish @MitfordUv Once again a wonderful rendition beautifully read :)
1337203505413623808 2020-12-11 09:12:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MitfordUv @GreenManEng Kipling, like so many of the great writers of European decent was a literary master. His poem "if" is a personal favourite. The award is well deserved.
1337199187935563776 2020-12-11 08:55:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng So I've noticed :)

1337194944516280321 2020-12-11 08:38:13 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Maurice74173217 Indeed, we have all drank from the poisoned well. Thank you for the link :)
1337141624342712323 2020-12-11 05:06:20 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @CelticLady15 Hello baby!!? Seriously🤣
1337140990075940867 2020-12-11 05:03:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Eloquently put! ;)
1337126409970610184 2020-12-11 04:05:53 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @RadicalLib @EternalEnglish You put out great content and I've learnt so much from you already .. information and knowledge is vital in the battle to counter the anti white narrative. Thank you for you work🙏❤
1337124051542814722 2020-12-11 03:56:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @RadicalLib @EternalEnglish Thank you, though credit goes to @Europinion_ for the OP ❤🌿
1337122902962020352 2020-12-11 03:51:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BrookeMayhill Funny.
1337090066510974978 2020-12-11 01:41:28 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Well said! Our self determination in the countries we built has been rebranded as an evil and sold as white privilege. Celebration of our heritage carries the charge of white supremacy.
1337082868774875142 2020-12-11 01:12:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ I will go to prison for my heritage.
1337061940850515973 2020-12-10 23:49:42 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ABusinessMan14 @Europinion_ I understand your position here, its beyond frustrating. however some are simply misguided they are good people who i feel can be reached.
1337061171942273028 2020-12-10 23:46:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @mrmeaniepants1 We need to unite and build our own centre again where we promote white well being and advocate for our own interest. Where we are not atomised and isolated, vulnerable to the propaganda that has poisoned own minds.
1337042824156606464 2020-12-10 22:33:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ Wise words and makes sense .. thank you🙏
1337042530110726144 2020-12-10 22:32:34 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Oak74679721 All designed to break us down and sever our connections to who we are  our cultures, traditions, ancestry and community, our very essence. Atomised and alone we are easy pickings. This is what we must resist by uniting as a people again not in hatred but our own well being.❤
1337040637368168448 2020-12-10 22:25:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @BarryNiet I am in shame lol I used to use some of those terms myself.. cringe!
1337039560417611779 2020-12-10 22:20:46 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @BarryNiet You are so right here I know this from my own experience of how I've walked away from the left and followed the truth .. which led me here. There are so many like me who merely believe they are on the right side doing good work not realising they've been fed a lie.
1337037820012212225 2020-12-10 22:13:51 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ Perhaps to just put our points across rationally and politely but always with an unapologetic conviction.  Counter their arguments with facts and let the truth reveal itself to those who would see it.
1337035632691048449 2020-12-10 22:05:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ Gosh that's sounds so awful :(
1337035451442622465 2020-12-10 22:04:27 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ The low hanging fruit as it were, maybe it's because I'm still naive and new to this but it hurts to see my people so corrupted! I want to wake them up not in a vain aren't I wonderful way but out of a genuine care .. or am I just wasting time that could be better spent?
1337033711741775878 2020-12-10 21:57:32 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Those are indeed valid points in getting the message across and I will put them in my vocabulary thank you❤  This was a friendly discussion with a nationalist gentleman though so not a debate merely my input as an ex leftie 🙂
1337029851740565505 2020-12-10 21:42:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ I was having this conversation just last night and from my experience I can with dismay tell you that in left wing circles some whites are in denial still, some simply dont care and others genuinely believe we deserve it. How do you save a people that dont want to be saved😔
1336978666870480898 2020-12-10 18:18:48 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BaconIlluminat1 Erm .. 🤔

1336976675389771777 2020-12-10 18:10:53 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JTSmith1014 We stand together @JTSmith1014  Thank you ❤🌿
1336972473955471360 2020-12-10 17:54:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Zundelist2 @Erik1Kyle Reading the things that these people have said churns my stomach &amp; turns me cold. To find out that people hold such hatred for an entire group of people, men, women &amp; children that they would see them exterminated but the horror is in how they can openly express is it as virtuous
1336969118797471745 2020-12-10 17:40:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @r3nh03k Yes, through mass immigration  coupled with our lower than replacement birthrates we are being replaced and our governments are complicit in this. We simply must become united in our own interests.
1336955710668726272 2020-12-10 16:47:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @VGloves51 Both are beautiful works aren't they❤

1336825173358628865 2020-12-10 08:08:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @fearless12342 @Europinion_ I totally agree, this is a battle for hearts and minds and we need to win over the masses and bring them together. Build a sense of community and a sense of love for who we are and white well being. We fight together❤
1336802516940546048 2020-12-10 06:38:51 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @fearless12342 @Europinion_ The manipulation and propaganda that we are exposed to is relentless and pushed into every expect of our lives. Without a community that self advocates many are helpless and dont even realise what's happening. I know as I was there myself until recently .. i got woken up.
1336798705182273539 2020-12-10 06:23:42 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Thank you:) I will take a look.
1336792558194876418 2020-12-10 05:59:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Exactly! .. May I ask where the clip is from?
1336785670002577409 2020-12-10 05:31:54 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @HowleyReporter Could you please provide the data you base this statement on or perhaps a link to the site?  Thank you :)

1336688416138932232 2020-12-09 23:05:27 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @SpookyGhost__IV @Europinion_ The ridiculousness of that is beyond insulting and would be laughable if it wasn't blindly accepted by so many. A dark agenda is being pushed here.
1336635001824309249 2020-12-09 19:33:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ They are truly the very thing they claim to fight against, this is outright oppression and subjugation. The superior sneering attitude and spiteful hate that's oozing from her is repulsive.
1336633872214347777 2020-12-09 19:28:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @RabidProSemite My apologies I meant to write "a member of the house .." my bad.

1336415692514537479 2020-12-09 05:01:45 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ShereeJasmine1 It's an alien concept to me which goes against nature. I wouldn't know how not to be feminine nor want too.   Love between a man and a woman should be complimentary not a constant battle for dominance⚘

In all good conscience I can no longer defend this.
1336237933033103362 2020-12-08 17:15:23 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @docuterror @Prime_Time_100 And it needs to.

1336231003342385153 2020-12-08 16:47:51 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ We must stop this it's why we are always on the fringes. We cannot organise and come together if cannot look past our differences, we have a greater enemy and are facing a real existential threat. Put aside our difference and unite in the common goal❤🌿
1336229111208013824 2020-12-08 16:40:20 +0800 <Amy_amorie> This is where we are at now where an individual can freely express sentiment like this yet face no repercussions because he speaks as part of a protected/oppressed group whites are bring conditioned to accept this through labels of racial privilege and fragility if we protest.
1336126454279659521 2020-12-08 09:52:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @margarethodge I feel that silencing voices by curtailing free speech is not the way  forward. Surely we resolve issues through open debate where all opinions are welcome &amp; everyone's voice is heard. Censoring views &amp; opinions is oppression you dont end hate by shutting people down only fuel it
1336122997267189761 2020-12-08 09:38:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarristerNF @margarethodge @Shambles151 When anonymity is no longer required by those who's legitmate concerns are considered hate by the left, when their lives aren't at risk of ruin &amp; calls for action against them unchecked perhaps people will feel more able to be visible. Pls look to the cause rather than the effect

1335606109051228162 2020-12-06 23:24:45 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @andyvblue Goodness that's creepy! Lol 🤣
1335518002838728705 2020-12-06 17:34:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat Yes exactly I've had that myself!!!
1335515503339646977 2020-12-06 17:24:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat This has an even greater effect when the harm is shown to affect one of the protected categories, race, gender, religion etc. MP's, corporations &amp; the media will be falling over themselves to score points. This protection of course doesnt extend to white people only  harm them.
1335513796421570570 2020-12-06 17:17:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat I see it as manipulation of good intention. Theres a group or opinion you want to remove, label it in the negative, escalate that negative to harmful/heinous through 'virtuous' groups hope not hate etc and MSM, then pass laws to silence said group good has been done.. right? 🤔🙃
1335509883169501185 2020-12-06 17:02:23 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @mhoncho_ @bighfizzle @linda_Hull25 @SkySportsNews I'm speaking of the movement BLM. I notice you dont call out the clear hateful anti white sentiment in the quoted tweet but rather come straight at me with racist label.
1335508149776896000 2020-12-06 16:55:30 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat .. to beat the state we need to have the support of the masses so it's a battle for hearts &amp; minds, we need to rekindle the love for who we are  as an antidote for the poison we've been fed for so long. We do that through community and rejoining in wholesome ways. IMO of course❤
1335506922204782592 2020-12-06 16:50:37 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat I have been looking at Patriotic Alternative after I followed Laura theres lots of information on the site, I may even try Laura's tea! :) Building our community and connecting is the key to turning this around i believe so its something I could get behind and support..
1335501586857123840 2020-12-06 16:29:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ Oh that is just the cutest thing! Oh bless her ❤🐻

1335224496769425415 2020-12-05 22:08:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ George Floyd's family called for an end to the violence committed in his name also .. that wasn't respected either but I didn't see many on the left condemning it.
1335171288969732098 2020-12-05 18:36:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JunkmanBarry @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo Truly I admire your spirit and we will need that but yes while you have guns they have an entire fully equipped army and are backed by most of the western powers. It wouldn't end well :(
1335164753719791616 2020-12-05 18:10:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JunkmanBarry @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo Whilst I respect your opinion &amp; I feel the frustration also, how are you going to physically fight the state your fists against guns? Using violence will just give them all the propaganda they need to disenfranchise us completely &amp; outlaw any &amp; all narrative against this madness
1335158577850413057 2020-12-05 17:46:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BrigantiaRegina Handsome gentleman!
1335143520827543557 2020-12-05 16:46:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo We have to! The alternative is just to awful to think about. I intend to have a family and I want my children to have a bright and happy future not be part of a subjugated hated minority who are treated as a sub-class or worse.
1335036663249203206 2020-12-05 09:41:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo People are listening and the more that do the louder and stronger our voice becomes. Keep shouting because now I shout beside you and tomorrow another and another. Dont lose heart ❤
1335035321357099009 2020-12-05 09:36:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I have just gone through Eva's thread and I feel sick to my stomach the level of hatred towards white people MY people is beyond shocking. They are calling for literal genocide. I can scarcely take this in.
1335032638080430080 2020-12-05 09:25:59 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I understand, twitter is a toxic forum and you are defending your position and your people I'm part of that so without wishing to appearing conceited you're defending me .. thank you :)
1335028956676939784 2020-12-05 09:11:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo Thank you for being so respectful and accepting me. I've got a lot to learn
1335026815526637572 2020-12-05 09:02:51 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @potentcogency @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo Is it! Part of me wants to go back and just pretend it's not happening .. but just to live a lie until it all comes crashing down.
1335025909418569728 2020-12-05 08:59:15 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo He sums it up very well doesnt he. Gosh it's horrible and I've been part of the problem 😔
1335021721741635584 2020-12-05 08:42:36 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo Maybe thats the whole point .. I dont know sometimes my head spins with all this. I was living happy in a world of rainbows and sunshine but I noticed a crack and when I slipped though I was in a nightmare but it's real.. I now understand the red pill blue pill thing!
1335016218399559680 2020-12-05 08:20:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I agree and I'm ashamed to admit I'm frightened, if this trend doesnt change the future looks very bleak and one i do not want to see come to fruition. We need to come together, a united people again and speak up for ourselves instead of advocating for our own demise.
1335014973051990016 2020-12-05 08:15:47 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Prime_Time_100 @Europinion_ @mojogringo I live in London and am starting to notice 😔

1335014215233499138 2020-12-05 08:12:46 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I'm only just getting to grips with the issues you mention here and trust me if I can be made to see then other can too. We need to keep opening peoples eyes and building back OUR communities teach people it's not a crime or hate to live you're own and get them onside
1335013178598711297 2020-12-05 08:08:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo To do anything which allows them to paint us in a negative light.
1335012783881121794 2020-12-05 08:07:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I'm not saying we shouldn't defend ourselves if needed and I've been shown the violence and hate and hypocrisy from the left and it terrible. What's worse is how they get a free pass from the state who turn a blind eye while the media spin it. Which is why we can't afford ..
1335010840685244416 2020-12-05 07:59:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu I shall take a look .. thank you 🌺
1335008320751607815 2020-12-05 07:49:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Prime_Time_100 @Europinion_ @mojogringo Then surely it's more prudent to retain all our avenues of discourse to fight against this in the only way that has a chance. I'm not suggesting that we now down and just accept it not ever! We just have to be smart about it.
1335007315762819080 2020-12-05 07:45:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu Yes, if I recall my history did the Male children not have to leave their village at around 8 or 9 and survive in the wilderness and if they returned after killing a wolf or something they were then a man?
1335004281523621890 2020-12-05 07:33:18 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu I love to try new things and would certainly be up for new recipes and menus .. though I'm not sure about blood broth! ❤
1335003636250906627 2020-12-05 07:30:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Prime_Time_100 @Europinion_ @mojogringo I'm just stepping into all this and I'm trying to assimilate so much and honestly it's horrible! I'm not being confrontational I just see violence as giving them everything they need to completely outlaw any resistance to the this insanity that I've been woken up too.
1335002485052891139 2020-12-05 07:26:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I understand the frustration gosh I'm starting to feel it myself but surely fighting in the streets will only lead to more sanctions against you and allow them to shut down any viable resistance. You cannot fight an overwhelming force with brute strength.
1335000614032510977 2020-12-05 07:18:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu Men are supposed to have healthy appetites so it's cool lol. A Henry the eighth.. I love it 🤣⚘
1334999715809812485 2020-12-05 07:15:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Prime_Time_100 @Europinion_ @mojogringo No, we dont this is awful and those men could have been seriously hurt, violence is never the way. What will this solve? It will just escalate and lead to more violence and hatred.
1334996719340236803 2020-12-05 07:03:15 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu They are better with the skins on, more fibre and nutritional value! Goodness though thats half a chicken on your plate! Were you hungry by chance!? lol

1334884654432849922 2020-12-04 23:37:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I will take a listen then. Thank you 💗🙂
1334872326131904514 2020-12-04 22:48:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng My taste is quite varied but most definitely classical and types of folk yes. Beyond dance pop I'm not really familiar with 80's music a bit before my time ;) sorry just teasing 🤣 Maybe it's something I should check out. ⚘
1334866311852269568 2020-12-04 22:25:04 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @womenofeuropa_ You are going to cost me a fortune! as at this rate I'm going to have to buy an entirely new wardrobe!! .. just beautiful❣

1334805658550611968 2020-12-04 18:24:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Not really my preferred genre but It reminds me of something perhaps played in the background of an art show or something.
1334601411959562240 2020-12-04 04:52:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @leastimnotu @Norny666 Just what my embattled will power needs .. more temptation lol ;)

1334567314893762562 2020-12-04 02:36:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @CaelDonahue @margaritaevna95 Maybe in part due a genetic trait from the mother passing down a penchant for "the bad boy" coupled with learning to accept neglect as normal. Though I'm sure it's much more complex than that. Surely evidence of the importance of strong family morals and principles.
1334555500726390786 2020-12-04 01:50:00 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @CaelDonahue @margaritaevna95 And thanks to my father I shall know what to look for and to my mother for being the role model in how to keep and support him ❤
1334448943011405824 2020-12-03 18:46:35 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @margaritaevna95 I call him father.

1334219186961346568 2020-12-03 03:33:37 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I would have thought shooting a gun would be something a man would enjoy! .. boys toys and all that lol.   Saying that, I think it would be fun and wouldn't mind having a go myself 🙂
1333946938572607491 2020-12-02 09:31:48 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu Well I'm not playing cos I can't eat it &lt;pout&gt; 🤣

1333926382083125253 2020-12-02 08:10:07 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @FranzLiszt60 @GreenManEng Incredible!.. human accomplishment is limited only by our aspirations. Our indomitable spirit and thirst for knowledge and exploration force us to strive for ever greater achievement. We are amazing❤
1333855645540495360 2020-12-02 03:29:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BigRiverSalmon Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

1333813053918425089 2020-12-02 00:39:47 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng We need a modern day Mr Cromwell.
1333796297912901632 2020-12-01 23:33:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng So its seeming .. whilst I continue to hope there are good and decent officials left they must start speaking out as it appears the corruption and dereliction is ever increasing.
1333782898021830656 2020-12-01 22:39:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng My God! Is there a single virtue remaining among these people! These people who are installed by  our will to represent us. Is there no vice beyond their corruption which even they refuse to pardon!? 😔

1331978438303944704 2020-11-26 23:09:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @womenofeuropa_ 🎂🎉🍾Happy Birthday🍾🎉🎂  https://t.co/PU063Q0VJs
1331940043133423617 2020-11-26 20:37:07 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng One should be at oneself to the highest standards at all times .. but where's the fun in that! 😈
1331939523748646916 2020-11-26 20:35:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I was very fortunate in having the privilege of a private education. She was one of my favourite tutors. Strict but fair she had a way of teaching by life example and was everyone's counsellor! It was her that instilled in me a love of European culture ❤
1331928524580675586 2020-11-26 19:51:20 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish @AQuantumCat1 @GreenManEng @YouTube Thank you! I shall take a look later if I ever get this work finished! Thank you again for sharing 🌺
1331927911306289153 2020-11-26 19:48:54 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng How can a lady expect a man to have respect for her if she isn't dignified and respectful in all she does including in and of herself not in vanity but integrity.   Ok so I stole that from my deportment mistress but it try to follow it .. mostly 😇🤣
1331925423664623616 2020-11-26 19:39:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EternalEnglish @AQuantumCat1 @GreenManEng @YouTube So perfectly and exquisitely put :)  Do you write yourself?
1331886368998428673 2020-11-26 17:03:50 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AQuantumCat1 @GreenManEng @EternalEnglish @YouTube I love the notion of a poem about the forming of a poem in the writers mind. both the finished work and the process are captured on the page. Beautifully read, thank you ❣
1331874716580196352 2020-11-26 16:17:32 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I'm quite sure she's a respectable lady and would insist on a suitable courtship😇
1331869633209643009 2020-11-26 15:57:20 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @womenofeuropa_ @SpartanWarQueen Got that right, what I wouldn't give for natural waves!!
1331758073090891777 2020-11-26 08:34:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng It's an exclusive 😉
1331733722354364417 2020-11-26 06:57:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Just too tempting.. ;)  https://t.co/0EPHRXNWOg
1331706266742296579 2020-11-26 05:08:10 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng That's exactly the image that popped into my mind 🤣
1331651812835856384 2020-11-26 01:31:47 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MinscTheRashemi @GreenManEng May I ask what you feel would be the answer to all this division :)?
1331638291007942657 2020-11-26 00:38:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MinscTheRashemi @GreenManEng Why is my trying to find the truth and make sense of all this naive?
1331618462704291844 2020-11-25 23:19:16 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MinscTheRashemi @GreenManEng Thank you. Once again I've been shown there is hatred and division from the left which I cannot defend. It seems there's extremism on both sides and one is simply the flip side of the other. Perhaps the balance lies in the centre.
1331615176815210497 2020-11-25 23:06:13 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @oloiux Most alluring.
1331551229130977284 2020-11-25 18:52:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MinscTheRashemi @GreenManEng Thank you :)  What I dont understand here is how a company supporting black lives matter equates to black supremacy. Surely helping to end racism and division is a good thing?
1331507538655895562 2020-11-25 15:58:30 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Skittles perhaps? - taste the rainbow ;)
1331505992996188160 2020-11-25 15:52:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Arch_Revival_ Goodness! The detail is incredible.❤
1331505491218997248 2020-11-25 15:50:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> Magnificent!
1331503188017614848 2020-11-25 15:41:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @womenofeuropa_ I would love to see these styles come back into vogue I would definitely be wearing them. So pretty with a wholesome charm❤
1331499497705369600 2020-11-25 15:26:32 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MinscTheRashemi @GreenManEng Hello :) Could I ask, which companies you feel are supporting black supremacy and why?
1331340296244899844 2020-11-25 04:53:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @NattyBumppo11 @oloiux Not as good as the model in the pic .. but thank you for the kind words ⚘
1331180387435941890 2020-11-24 18:18:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @oloiux Do you know if this is a historically accurate piece or just a gorgeous costume dress?
1331179494879727619 2020-11-24 18:14:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @oloiux Omg! .. that is just divine I want this❣
1331178916741074945 2020-11-24 18:12:40 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @badluck_jones @leastimnotu A serene beauty that calms the soul🌺❤
1330548707553636353 2020-11-23 00:28:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Or4nj Such hatred, violence is never the way. It doesn't have to be like this 😔
1330547796248834054 2020-11-23 00:24:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norway_Pine @GreenManEng So pretty!❤
1330545810543702018 2020-11-23 00:16:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @thisislaurat I understand it can be frustrating especially when you have things to do but the right course now is rest, once it feels better you can start some gentle exercises to strengthen the muscles. If it doesnt get any better then contact your GP.  Hope you feel better soon Take care ❤
1330138202468995072 2020-11-21 21:17:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @realgreatbrit No absolutely not. The hunting of a living creature for pleasure is abhorrent and a terrible reflection on a society 🦊♥️
1330093382874619906 2020-11-21 18:19:09 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng @aeisteitiuil @SurvivetheJive Folklore is special isnt it. Not only does it often pass on morality and life lessons but also gives us an insight into our ancestors, a bridge through time allowing us a greater connection to our ancestry.
1330092270842941442 2020-11-21 18:14:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng It's incredible, to capture that moment in time and distill its form so perfectly on to canvas! An instant of life frozen in eternity by the hand of a master. It's a beautiful piece. ❤
1329928418566213636 2020-11-21 07:23:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng This is a masterpiece and truly the work of a genius!
1329925974172033024 2020-11-21 07:13:55 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng @aeisteitiuil @SurvivetheJive Thank you so much that was fascinating. Beware the wild hunt! I shall definitely stick to the middle of the path if I visit Wistman forest ;)  https://t.co/dxjI9cUoSi
1329910771480981506 2020-11-21 06:13:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng @aeisteitiuil @SurvivetheJive Folklore and nature what's not to enjoy :)
1329906126125740032 2020-11-21 05:55:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng @aeisteitiuil @SurvivetheJive Thank you. I shall definitely take a look at that :)
1329901061683855361 2020-11-21 05:34:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @aeisteitiuil @GreenManEng I actually intended to say "food" for the spirit, but good kind of works too lol ♥️
1329900336941830146 2020-11-21 05:32:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @aeisteitiuil @GreenManEng Goodness! This is just magical .. a truly fairytale beauty i can scarcely believe its actually a real place. Nature is surely good for the spirit 🌿🌷🌿
1329854350043320320 2020-11-21 02:29:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @womenofeuropa_ A beautiful piece. Thank you❣
1329852676969013249 2020-11-21 02:22:40 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Nieprzemakalny1 @womenofeuropa_ And she is of course deserving of total respect for that. I was speaking from a purely fashion sense 💗🌺
1329729614915231744 2020-11-20 18:13:40 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Nieprzemakalny1 @womenofeuropa_ Think I prefer the floral dress ;)
1329583565257003011 2020-11-20 08:33:19 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @ZyclownB @leastimnotu Polite tip sweetie, cheap hair dye is a false economy 😉
1329566042402787330 2020-11-20 07:23:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng Åre is a nice resort we've been there a few times. Beautiful scenery, you really should go.. if skiing is not your thing there a beautiful spa lodge at the the top of Forberget in Dalarna which we stayed at. Truly lovely.
1329546768921538561 2020-11-20 06:07:06 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @GreenManEng I saw the Aurora for the first time in Sweden on a skiing holiday. It took my breath away it's so very beautiful, natures wonder steeped in majesty.
1329530305515024389 2020-11-20 05:01:40 +0800 <Amy_amorie> Oh my gosh, how beautiful is that dress!!! ♥️😍♥️
1328141239653380102 2020-11-16 09:02:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @PauperPeter @Nigatometry @EgraElto @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Thank you for the article.
1328141042907029507 2020-11-16 09:01:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @TeutonicTribe @MikeStuchbery_ And its that hypocrisy what refuses to leave my mind. These articles are hateful and divisive far worse than the leaflet yet they stand as promotions of virtue. This flies in the face of what I believe &amp; in all good conscience I cant defend this. Seems I have some thinking to do.
1328128702765522944 2020-11-16 08:12:12 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @TeutonicTribe @MikeStuchbery_ I dont mean to cast doubt on your integrity but I'm shocked at those some are outright racist &amp; some are, well simply vile! If they are genuine articles how was such blatant prejudice &amp; divisive sentiment allowed. If you could find anything that would verify I would be grateful.
1328111797606510594 2020-11-16 07:05:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @TeutonicTribe @MikeStuchbery_ Do you happen to have links to any of those articles from the left hand pic? I have to say have tried to reason those out and can't.. I'm dismayed at that and finding it hard to accept they are real.
1328030721974341632 2020-11-16 01:42:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Nigatometry @EgraElto @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Hatred directed at any group based on race, ethnicity sexuality etc is wrong and counterproductive to solving the issues around racism and prejudice. I just dont see this anti white attitude in my daily life. I will try your suggestion and see what I get .. thank you.
1328022556671172608 2020-11-16 01:10:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Nigatometry @EgraElto @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Thank you Nigadamus. feeling a connection to ones ancestry is a good thing as its linked to our spiritual connection to nature I feel.  What makes you feel that other groups hate us?
1328003578959683598 2020-11-15 23:55:00 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Nigatometry @EgraElto @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Who do you refer to when you say "our enemies"? And by your own people do you mean racially or ethnically?
1327945026098388997 2020-11-15 20:02:20 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @EgraElto @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Hi :) Thank you for chipping in. I feel that anyone has the freedom to have children with whomever they like. Your statement wasn't supremacist unless your meaning was white people should only have white children because they are superior. I'm sorry you experienced that.
1327916761686093832 2020-11-15 18:10:02 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @CelticShewolfn @leastimnotu Hello :) Can I ask what makes you feel that people or groups are against white people marrying each other? I'm not being confrontational, I'm just looking to get a perspective from "the other side" as it were♥️
1327913103766511617 2020-11-15 17:55:30 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BrightonBDS @MikeStuchbery_ Are you advocating for violence here!? That is incitement and that is absolutely not the way.
1327717374062194690 2020-11-15 04:57:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @TeutonicTribe @MikeStuchbery_ That's quite an extreme view! I can't say I've noticed a daily regime of hatred against white people in the media nor films I also have no idea of who would be behind such a programme. When you say reclaim our countries do you mean from government or minorities?
1327706471287681024 2020-11-15 04:14:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @amk262 @boblister_poole @lizzywales I agree that colonialism was wrong and a lot of damage was done. What I'm saying is that we cannot lay it at the feet of any one group as colonialism was a universal sin throughout human history. Its counterproductive to scapegoat one group 🙂
1327664622510485506 2020-11-15 01:28:07 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @AfricanWheel @leastimnotu @RealWriteWinger I don't feel you should be able to see another Dr just because you want to or based on the colour of their skin the NHS is a free service and has limited resources. However if there's a valid reason then yes of course.
1327661752419553282 2020-11-15 01:16:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @amk262 @boblister_poole @lizzywales You cannot blame modern industrialisation and economics on western colonisation it's far more complex then that. preserving the environment and ecology is a human issue and we must come together to solve it. It is unhelpful to turn it into a  a racial issue.
1327655149981020163 2020-11-15 00:50:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ While I see your point on indigenous citizens benefiting more from the systems of their nation I don't think it's fair. Everyone should be treated equally if they have paid into the system. It's wrong to treat people differently based on race, sexuality, or religion etc.
1327623829456375808 2020-11-14 22:46:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @suffolkbiker31 @leastimnotu @RealWriteWinger However my thoughts on your ex are if she was genuinely struggling to understand her tutor she should not have been threatened with losing her place for asking if she could be moved as it's a valid reason and could affect her studies. I'm sorry she experienced that!
1327621549613068292 2020-11-14 22:36:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ It depends what you mean by most important. If you mean they should remain the majority I actually kind of agree there but if you mean they should be treated better or receive preferential treatment then no as we are all people.
1327620374054494208 2020-11-14 22:32:17 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @suffolkbiker31 @leastimnotu @RealWriteWinger I haven't actually seen the original post I'm afraid, could you link it for me? Thank you 🙂
1327618671376785408 2020-11-14 22:25:31 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Has to target an individual or group? If it's the latter then again I can see how It can be seen as malicious. I do think this could have been handled better by the police given his age I don't feel there was a need to arrest him.
1327612652382773249 2020-11-14 22:01:36 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I must admit I haven't looked into their policy in detail but isn't part of their plan to repatriate British citizens of immigrant descent?
1327611228856913920 2020-11-14 21:55:57 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @leastimnotu @RealWriteWinger I agree, but they are not excluding anyone Just offering the right for anyone who needs it :)
1327604400525877248 2020-11-14 21:28:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @RealWriteWinger @leastimnotu I don't think that's what they are meaning here. It's just to offer people a choice who may not speak the language or who's culture has certain beliefs around the body or medicine :)
1327603301739880453 2020-11-14 21:24:27 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ They want to build a community for ethnically English people only .. I don't agree with excluding people.
1327602445137170432 2020-11-14 21:21:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I completely agree with you here but wouldn't protecting all people protect their ethnic groups.
1327601295931420675 2020-11-14 21:16:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Pinandpuller @leastimnotu While his faith is inspirational do is so sad to watch. It doesnt have to be like this!
1327598876858126342 2020-11-14 21:06:52 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I know nothing about the law but I can see how it might be construed as malicious.
1327598388695719938 2020-11-14 21:04:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Well you've clearly proven that not to be the case and thank you. I have been given some food for thought today on many levels. Thank you ♥️
1327597763484323840 2020-11-14 21:02:27 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @BritannicBysta1 @MikeStuchbery_ I'm sorry that he felt he needed to do that, personally I don't believe censoring opinion is conducive to solving issues. We must keep channels open to everyone if we are going to resolve these problems. Hatred is not the way.
1327596817840652291 2020-11-14 20:58:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @MikeStuchbery_ I have and lots were abusive .. while I while I appreciate this is a sensitive issue I find it much more helpful and conducive to debate if people remain polite❤
1327595041452404736 2020-11-14 20:51:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I would say you have been very respectful and open! I don't know why Mike would have chosen to hide your replies .. are you sure it may just be another Twitter glitch?
1327594324767469568 2020-11-14 20:48:47 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I do believe it was heavy handed policing to arrest him .. poor thing must have been terrified, do you know what he was actually arrested for?
1327593699195428864 2020-11-14 20:46:18 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ We certainly have common ground on our distaste for global finance and economic power. So, if our population is in decline but bringing in more people allegedly leads to the erosion of the ethnic English what is the answer?
1327587087672102912 2020-11-14 20:20:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @basedhp @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Thank you Howard. That is interesting reading those figures are a lot higher than I was expecting. That's not say I agree with the sentiments of the leaflets or Patriotic Alternative. However if they are facts they have a right to Express them maybe just worded differently 🙂
1327585051081646080 2020-11-14 20:11:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Firstly, thank you for your calm demeanor and not screaming snowflake leftie at me! But surely population growth must include  everyone not just immigrants, also having other cultures here doesn't erase or lessen our own.
1327578116898877442 2020-11-14 19:44:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Even if true I do believe its divisive and even inciteful. It directly blames such things as traffic congestion and NHS waiting lists on immigration when these are complicated issues with multiple reasons. May I ask why you feel having other cultures here a bad thing?
1327570831682232320 2020-11-14 19:15:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I have to disagree that it's not controversial, however I'm surprised  it does appear to be accurate statistically though i will look more into this. While I don't agree with the sentiment I don't see a reason it shouldn't be allowed and I think being arrested for it is wrong.
1327563821121146880 2020-11-14 18:47:34 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Thank you MrKrinkle. Whilst I wouldn't want this put through my door I personally think its divisive. More to the point is it even accurate?
1327562244931153920 2020-11-14 18:41:18 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @leastimnotu @boblister_poole A heartfelt, emotive video from this man and I echo a lot of his sentiments. The corporate machine cares nothing for the spirit of the planet or our need to be connected to it. Their driving force is financial gain and economic growth but to what end!?😔 Thank you for posting ❤

Racially divisive language will only hinder our efforts at cohesive activism I'm sure you will agree 🙂

1327549924679028736 2020-11-14 17:52:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MikeStuchbery_ Hello Mike :)  If these leaflets did contain racially hateful material then I agree it should be stopped. But I feel open debate is a better medium to stop radicalisation as opposed to gagging IMO. Does anyone have a link to or copy of said leaflets?

1327151921963159553 2020-11-13 15:30:50 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Tyr_7777 Oh this is so very sad. All the time financial gain is the driving force for humankind then the importance of deeper things like human rights and the environment will always come second :(..
1327148397120413696 2020-11-13 15:16:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @boblister_poole Omg this is so very heartbreaking. This was more than just a tree it was a monument. So sad and wrong😭
1326612907052978179 2020-11-12 03:48:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @thewhitebfly This is great! But surely anyone can care for the land the more helping the better yes? 🙂
