Is it not ‚Äúok to be white?‚Äù  Why are you leftists so hateful, aggressive and intolerant? Is it the statues? Is it ignorance? Is it a weird self-loathing cult?

I know you buffoons don‚Äôt like facts, but capitalism has raised the average wage in the last 100 years from (equivalent) under $1.00 a day at the turn of the C to today‚Äôs averages.  Where (a real place) either historically or today wld you sooner live?  Does this upset u?
