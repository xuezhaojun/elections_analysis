1343982643541471234 2020-12-30 02:10:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, them giving away our memetic like candy must stop now.
1343967357706747904 2020-12-30 01:09:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 They did get those ratings until “they did it” as the Fox exec wife exclaimed about  a Biden victory.  And then we did it!  Fox turned on us and we turned them off.
1343796109647306752 2020-12-29 13:48:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> @StevenJHammond1 And DNA
1343736577298558979 2020-12-29 09:52:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> @marwilliamson Treacherous
1343712503142858752 2020-12-29 08:16:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> If you take out the give away pork from the bill?
1343585333640798208 2020-12-28 23:51:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> Trump wants the economy open and people to be successful.  Dems don’t
1343435402514874368 2020-12-28 13:55:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> And then became a Board member of Fox and ruined that news outlet too.
1343419214590144513 2020-12-28 12:51:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Hey Dan, you might not know this yet.  It should make you happy.  https://t.co/vO9LYACPZu
1343254529257566209 2020-12-28 01:56:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes this is true.  In CA you can’t get it from strippers either!
1343247341717913600 2020-12-28 01:28:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I would never call you “friend”.  Backstabbed is more like it.  Voter fraud was rampant.
1343095454800564226 2020-12-27 15:24:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 Problem is, no one is laughing.
1342983773567139841 2020-12-27 08:00:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> @liquidlaugh Yes and there must be a reason?
1342983106127515649 2020-12-27 07:58:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> But you will never have a chance if there is election fraud.
1342882767202254848 2020-12-27 01:19:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> And that nothing became of you less than writing of it.
1342715802705752067 2020-12-26 14:16:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> Do you have the President back?  Do you support the 74 million Americans that believe there was massive voter fraud?
1342649520782409728 2020-12-26 09:52:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> I guess we will see a man making a huge decision.  Like if he will be the hero of the day for our country and the people or beat down by Mitch?
1342589454255452160 2020-12-26 05:54:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> Must have a garage rope pull or escort a Biden bus to get a real investigation from FBI...
1342588892990455809 2020-12-26 05:51:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> He probably showed them the ropes.
1342535445205241856 2020-12-26 02:19:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well no kidding.  They killed their own ratings.
1342531202863882241 2020-12-26 02:02:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> PS-trying to make the other guilty jerks look bad does not make you look good.  Despicable, disgusting bill with no redeeming qualities created and proudly put forth by you.  Congress is a disgrace and is not doing its duty of financial integrity and caring for our countries need
1342528295112302594 2020-12-26 01:51:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> A child was born and today is a celebration of birth, salvation and redemption in the name of Jesus Christ.  My your heart be lifted in HIS joy.
1342521734868525056 2020-12-26 01:24:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> And give you 600
1342483931325558786 2020-12-25 22:54:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> We are ready to open the economy and quit killing businesses and the economy and people.  In 2005 Fauci also said the antidote for covid was HCQ.  Quit terrorizing people.
1342378403006017536 2020-12-25 15:55:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> And I don’t believe you.
1342376607156039680 2020-12-25 15:48:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump Use the earmarks for foreign govs and the millions and billions in the arts and spend it on the economy...signed, we the people.
1342372743820427264 2020-12-25 15:32:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> GTH
1342365133578727424 2020-12-25 15:02:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> You just want him to sign a raise for you of about $60k.  a year.  That is an “omnibust” bill and not covid relief and not good for American taxpayers.  We are tired of taxation and tyranny.  Open up the economy.
1342357131148738567 2020-12-25 14:30:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> The fraud was rampant and we know Joe Biden did not, really did not well emphatically did not win from his basement.  You say he’s truthful.  In his own words he said that him and Obama created the biggest voter fraud organization in US history.  I believe him too.
1342355216188903425 2020-12-25 14:23:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> And who voted to pay for spraying alcoholic rats with bobcat urine 4.5 million in the last spending bill?  This was highlighted by RAND PAUL.
1342229660764008448 2020-12-25 06:04:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> And they go truly low.
1342228948273414144 2020-12-25 06:01:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> And the House said.  We are more important let’s sneak in about a $60,000 pay raise.  So much pork in this bill maybe no one will even notice...we did.
1342227502798753792 2020-12-25 05:55:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> Death by hanging right!
1342226422711009280 2020-12-25 05:51:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes and the House gave themselves about $164.00 a day to work part time, shaft the taxpayers and give away our future.  They have no money to pay for it.  Shameful.
1342140456084275202 2020-12-25 00:09:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> That is good right?  They were caught up in an illegal investigation as shown by facts recently released.  You know about illegal FISAapplications, spying and even a conviction for falsifying a document by an FBI attorney
1342139271419842567 2020-12-25 00:05:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> And look at what you have done.  Bankrupted the country as we have what $26 Trillion in debt.  No ability to repay and you are giving away America’s future.  This entire bill is wrong for the country.  And you even had the gall to give yourself a raise.  Traitorous to America.
1342137085038264320 2020-12-24 23:56:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> And they sat around and said oh how brilliant.  It is a wonderful idea. It will take a lot of effort to get bobcat urine and to make a rat alcoholic.  So 4.5mil to set up this complicated program and maybe one rat right so we can get that money out there. And our kids need jobs?
1342127172224393216 2020-12-24 23:17:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> About the bill.  Just kill it entirely.  It is a bloated giveaway that should not be approved.  Who writes these massive giveaways? And the House wrote themselves a raise? $600 for thee and $60,000 for me.  Congress approval rating is reported at 12%.  Is it even that high?
1342123352081633281 2020-12-24 23:01:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> David French propagandize.
1342122012399915009 2020-12-24 22:56:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> She is one of the best in the business.  It only shows how someone trying to deceive will go to any length.  Like the propaganda and lies CNN and MSM has perpetuated for years on America.  Knowingly presented falsehoods.  Yes you, along with the rest of them.
1342111441810116608 2020-12-24 22:14:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> Are you speaking out against members of Congress that have failed to pay their taxes?
1341989130155118592 2020-12-24 14:08:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @intheMatrixxx @jefflcohen Amen
1341987794768445440 2020-12-24 14:03:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> How’s your Chinese spy, Fang Fang?  Did you bang bang?
1341980291485716481 2020-12-24 13:33:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Socialism as defined by Democrats/Congress.  $600 for you and $60k for me.  Say no Mr. President.
1341979392885440512 2020-12-24 13:29:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MattBraynard Class action lawsuit please and let the rest of us join too.
1341978630918828036 2020-12-24 13:26:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> Nor do we support it flowing back to those politicians through foundations and campaign contributions either by front door or back door.  The 12% approval rate for congress is overstated.
1341977821850206209 2020-12-24 13:23:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> We will become the illegals.  Will we get free education, healthcare and legal services?
1341958170629922816 2020-12-24 12:05:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yeah like the lockdowns they are so proud of right?
1341956260824956929 2020-12-24 11:57:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> I thought you all signed on to the bill?
1341952984213643264 2020-12-24 11:44:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> Oh well no one else does.  I believe he has gotten together with Gates and his financial doings should be scrutinized toP to bottom.  Also his relationship with the Wuhan lab.  Oh and they can dance in nightclubs and no masks required in WUHAN NOW ACCORDING TO THEIR ADS...
1341928027907756033 2020-12-24 10:05:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> Somehow I think you are trying to repair the tarnished reputation.  But with a long time approval rating of 12% the question is how low can you go.  That pork laden POS was not worth the paper it was written on.  If you all agreed on it why did people say no time to read.
1341879847811829760 2020-12-24 06:54:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Me making a gagging sound...
1341877353941594113 2020-12-24 06:44:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenatorAument in the past voters voted Republican thinking that people like you were conservative and for the values regular Americans embrace.  The Trump landslide was real and the fraud was enormous.  Stand up for what is right or the landslide will continue down smashing R’s.
1341834783492505600 2020-12-24 03:55:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @jason_meister And with the voting machines in Venezuela how does this help?
1341825973881241600 2020-12-24 03:20:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> Not without getting the garbage out!
1341821206387814400 2020-12-24 03:01:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, I will even call you Mr. President and throw more bucks that we don’t have for the poor.  Just sign our money laundering package with sneaky legislation that gives me a 50k raise...
1341815142749597696 2020-12-24 02:37:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> They don’t care about the money as they don’t have it anyhow.  It is robbing from the future to give away now.
1341814273752748032 2020-12-24 02:33:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, demand forensic audit of every machine used in election as discovery.  And software vote switching (caught red handed) fractional counting and internet connectivity security issues too.
1341809338688495616 2020-12-24 02:14:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> Or the raise for the House members—-About $50 K a year.
1341808055608963072 2020-12-24 02:09:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> Go to hell.  You want the bill as is just more$.
1341807183604805637 2020-12-24 02:05:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Amen
1341801652823576576 2020-12-24 01:43:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> Gut the foreign aid and other Legislative trickery out too.
1341799571341471744 2020-12-24 01:35:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> And their is real $$ in the vaccine push.  They don’t want the cheap effective solution.
1341798536401149952 2020-12-24 01:31:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> Horse shit.  This is just theft of America.
1341796078648057856 2020-12-24 01:21:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> And Politico became  meaningless.
1341793649726648322 2020-12-24 01:11:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> No frankly I didn’t notice?  You mean like defying the subpoena to evaluate the Dominion machines in Maricopa Co or did I miss some news?
1341792122786119681 2020-12-24 01:05:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> No thanks.  Glad you won’t be our dictator.
1341791663354568704 2020-12-24 01:03:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> So everyone getting a taste of socialism in America yet?  The Covid bill gives Americans $600, illegals $1,800 and they get a per person award and they give themselves in the House a $50 k annual salary increase.  And wildly went on a giveaway spree with money they do not have.
1341789964283998208 2020-12-24 00:57:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> Or defying their own citizen rule of staying home or like Newsom who reportedly has his winery open including the restaurant but closing others.
1341655667157831680 2020-12-23 16:03:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> I heard she stuck in $50 k annual salary increase for herself and the House members.  No thanks.
1341653331035389953 2020-12-23 15:54:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, call it like it is right!!!
1341653156233576449 2020-12-23 15:53:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Only if they take out everything unrelated to covid.
1341652562089426944 2020-12-23 15:51:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> Does that mean they will have to show that all the drives were found; they were not on the internet; they are not doing fractional voting and did not switch votes in all those states?  Do they have to show if China paid them 499 million?  Glad they will have to.
1341650339141849088 2020-12-23 15:42:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 @carlamiller414 Socialism...
1341650016553684992 2020-12-23 15:41:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, stop stealing from future generation and stop trying to bamboozle us.  Put out a 5000 page bill and pass it without reading or knowing what is in it. An excuse to pass it.  America is done with lunacy.  The bill included a $50k House raise. Thieves. They deserve a reduction.
1341645712908374018 2020-12-23 15:23:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> We the people need to stop Congress from stealing our money and our Grand children’s future by debt spending.  Think about it Americans $600; illegals $1800 and house members $50000.  Citizens and illegals a one time payoff and the House get a raise in perpetuity.  Say -NO
1341643429315452928 2020-12-23 15:14:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheOfficerTatum Why stop there, go for a million!
1341641768480067584 2020-12-23 15:08:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SJPFISH @realDonaldTrump Do Covid relief only.
1341636702398345218 2020-12-23 14:48:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> No Lindsey people are NOT stupid and blind.  We are done with the bullshit and lies.  That bill is pure garbage and if you can’t see that you need to resign.  You neither represent your state or America as your sworn oath of office.
1341635441070510081 2020-12-23 14:43:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> They were sure trying to give themselves in the House a big wad of $ though.
1341582646502035456 2020-12-23 11:13:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> No to the massive stuffed spending and chicanery that was slid in.  No raise for House.  They should be paying back for not working and poor performance.
1341577295186677760 2020-12-23 10:52:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> This is disingenuous as there is so much pork spending in this a person would think you were all drunk when you put it out there.  America says no to the money laundering schemes and we need a Peter Schwartz deep dive.  The bill is terrible.
1341546558089691136 2020-12-23 08:49:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President.  The Congress are showing their distain for America and Americans.  This bill was a disgrace.  Save us from those monsters!
1341543464882692096 2020-12-23 08:37:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @stirednotshakn They should have to get their new fur coats from Goodwill!  Disgusting and Fox can rot.
1341542390671101953 2020-12-23 08:33:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Unconscionable and despicable scam against Americans.  President Trump @realDonaldTrump do not sign this garbage.  #VetoThisBill
1341539415491895297 2020-12-23 08:21:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> @no_silenced And Fast and furious, IRS targeting the conservatives, spygate, steel dossier lies and spy’s and Ukraine fleecing for personal gain.  All of them Biden.
1341477979843559424 2020-12-23 04:17:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, in 2024 you can try again.
1341477522085580800 2020-12-23 04:15:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> Policy makers: Prove the lockdowns helped.  Prove it is safe to go to a box or convenience store but not a restaurant.  Prove that we should accept officials out and about without masks.  Prove that ruining businesses/peoples lives was necessary.  We will be silent no more.
1341473506723151872 2020-12-23 03:59:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> @marklutchman Fox news is a goner and they know it.  They slimed every conservative viewer.  No longer have any relevancy.
1341472637663367169 2020-12-23 03:56:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes and at the same time screwed American taxpayers with the giveaways that no one understands.  Money laundering is our best guess.  Really, gender studies in Pakistan?  Justify that...
1341468551077535744 2020-12-23 03:40:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> And Tennessee and America thanks you!
1341457573170479104 2020-12-23 02:56:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> At the pub?
1341441740020957184 2020-12-23 01:53:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Lies and deceit perpetrated once again on the American people.  This bill is a disgusting abuse of power and is not designed to provide relief to America but boondoggle spending. #VetoTheBill
1341440830985232386 2020-12-23 01:49:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pam_sands @blawvere @realDonaldTrump @gatewaypundit We are better without it.
1341438606993358850 2020-12-23 01:41:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> Dear Rep Bacon,  I cant believe you are paid so much to betray America so badly.  President Trump please #VetoTheBill
1341437123019243521 2020-12-23 01:35:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> Who will do something about it?
1341435790581088256 2020-12-23 01:29:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> In America we can be fleeced, cheated on, lied to and censored.  But now Congress passes law of 10 years in jail for illegal streaming.  Is that so people can’t see vid of suitcases of ballots pulled out from under the table in the dead of night?  Counted after closing in secret?
1341432584975224832 2020-12-23 01:17:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> It is unthinkable that Congress acts this way.  This bill is not what is good or right for America.  We are sick of paying our congress to screw American taxpayers.  This must end.  I am urging President to veto. #stopthesteal #VetoTheBill
1341430453673230336 2020-12-23 01:08:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> @EinsteinsMagic @Deplorable_Man What is illegal streaming?
1341428231962910720 2020-12-23 00:59:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> No it is raping of American taxpayers.
1341425297539747841 2020-12-23 00:48:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> That bill was disgusting...
1341420507657170944 2020-12-23 00:29:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RepAdamSchiff It is a massive pork/spending piece of disgust and distain to the American taxpayers .
1341279837495824384 2020-12-22 15:10:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> Drunk on power
1341273978875174913 2020-12-22 14:46:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Thomas1774Paine She was obviously not scared of covid.  HCQ?
1341270882778456064 2020-12-22 14:34:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @ksorbs And Bill Barr was as quiet as a church mouse.
1341269748458291200 2020-12-22 14:30:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> Monumental failure
1341258562249486337 2020-12-22 13:45:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> Nancy’s Porklousy must be vetoed.
1341257495902228481 2020-12-22 13:41:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheRISEofROD @GmanFan45 You know, the smelly Walmart shoppers that they actually despise.
1341252040664608769 2020-12-22 13:19:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @BreitbartNews Bullying by him?  Haha.
1341251570718011393 2020-12-22 13:17:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Thomas1774Paine McCain screwed Trump though the Steele dossier.  He was not so honorable in the accounts I have read?
1341134071145979904 2020-12-22 05:30:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> No they will have perfected the steal.  We will have nothing left.  https://t.co/LyBUtVkWiE
1341103331561730048 2020-12-22 03:28:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Where is it shown that they do?
1341037219377676288 2020-12-21 23:06:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, more like they want us heeling...
1341022199155630080 2020-12-21 22:06:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> 600?  And you say we did it?
1341016865951236096 2020-12-21 21:45:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> And in a tweet by Toro: Donald Trump: 2,497 counties with 75,000,000 votes  Joe Biden: 477 counties with 81,000,000 votes.  How does this makes sense?
1340911005002436615 2020-12-21 14:44:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> This is how socialism works.  Wreck the economy,starve people and give a few dollars and brag about saving them.  Look at Venezuela.
1340788068756779008 2020-12-21 06:36:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> Not with you
1340722847761584128 2020-12-21 02:16:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> And Marco, we believe that Trump won the election in a landslide and that Congress needs to step up.  We are not docile and malleable and willing to let the cheating stand.  The world is watching.  Did you see the videos of people in other countries rallying supporting Trump?
1340555957730824193 2020-12-20 15:13:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> The buttugly truth!
1340554319658012680 2020-12-20 15:07:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> Who does Gates fund?
1340460336000847872 2020-12-20 08:53:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheRISEofROD So sorry.
1340459796495888384 2020-12-20 08:51:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> In the end you might not be thinking you are lucky.  Give me HCQ, zinc and vit D which is now legal again.  Don’t trust the vaccines!!!
1340456179084849154 2020-12-20 08:37:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> Prove it!  Talk is cheap and so are those locking down business and economy.  They are all paid.
1340455483220455424 2020-12-20 08:34:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> I like it!  The Guardians of the galaxy!
1340418249113014272 2020-12-20 06:06:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks for the heads up.  You are not in America’s best interest.  If I am friends, I will be unfriending you too.  With friends like you, who needs enemies?!
1340407576500920320 2020-12-20 05:24:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Gods_Grace7777 @CRRJA5 She knows ...!
1340316796805517312 2020-12-19 23:23:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> So we are required to have non citizen representation?  That is “packing the House” and should not be legal.
1340205867304566784 2020-12-19 16:02:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Is John Roberts related to Chris Wray?
1340201546613547011 2020-12-19 15:45:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> That most likely will backfire...
1340201196766724097 2020-12-19 15:43:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> I was shocked that you did not comply with subpoenas to look at the Dominion voting machines.  What kind of transparency is that.  I believe you are failing the country and our democracy.  Let the light shine brightly?  Audit
1340199823727685634 2020-12-19 15:38:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> No mask?  And there are many, like myself, that want answers regarding the election fraud you oversaw.  R’s locked out of viewing ballots, no signature verification, dirty voter roles, lies about water-mains breaking, sending poll watchers home and counting in secret, Dominion ?
1340109985846476800 2020-12-19 09:41:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Not on your life!
1340083916808409089 2020-12-19 07:57:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> How about we tattoo it on your arse?
1340042472257306629 2020-12-19 05:13:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> He is clearly not a republican.   He is more like a sleazy opportunist my net grubbing politician—-Kemp that is...
1340028345400975360 2020-12-19 04:17:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> Nope
1340027014078550016 2020-12-19 04:11:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> Let me be clear.  The US  has been a beacon to the world for our freedom and way of life.  We have fought like hell for our country and the world.  We are fighting a fraudulent election.  We are fighting for America and American values.  We will not concede to fraud and deceit.
1339996702426578945 2020-12-19 02:11:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders all want it for theirselves.  Say no!
1339955174664667137 2020-12-18 23:26:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> This is spoken by a man who slept with a foreign spy?  The hypocrisy is overwhelming.  Did you askFang Fang who hacked us?  And yes, we are saying no to fraudulent elections.
1339954045348265990 2020-12-18 23:21:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrShayPhD Prayers to your family.
1339648392297816064 2020-12-18 03:07:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> And Zckerburg has lots!
1339638361930121217 2020-12-18 02:27:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> No, we will not let the fraud stand.  No one came out to see Biden in GA.  No he was not elected.
1339633688552718336 2020-12-18 02:08:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> But at the same time we need our politicians to ensure fair elections.  There are thousands of whistleblowers and known fraud.  If you let fraud in the election stand, it is being s traitor to the country and the people you represent.
1339618258517815297 2020-12-18 01:07:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @danhill2011 National Party

1339464988637843457 2020-12-17 14:58:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Nope.  Fake news as I will not support his incompetence.
1339456510749855746 2020-12-17 14:24:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> Loser
1339379904127758339 2020-12-17 09:20:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> On behalf of America—-a million thanks.
1339309192935428096 2020-12-17 04:39:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> No fix it now.
1339240040422014976 2020-12-17 00:04:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Rigged election
1339238948384567296 2020-12-17 00:00:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> America has been lied to.  Election fraud is rampant and Biden did not win.  America will not stand for this.  We do not want to be Venezuela.  The covid response by Congress was to take massive paid time off,and closing everyone else.  You are fast tracking a new party.
1339229135994904577 2020-12-16 23:21:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yup
1339081855161618434 2020-12-16 13:36:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz.
1339055139173195776 2020-12-16 11:49:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> To think I once liked you.  No more though.
1339051385342414850 2020-12-16 11:35:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you.  I don’t believe for a minute that Biden won.  Fraud, fraud and ore fraud.  Fix it and fix the election mess.   We must refuse to be Venezuela...
1338927669602263040 2020-12-16 03:23:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> Your chosen ignorance is on full display.  Look at the fraud reported from the machine audit in MI.  Error rate 68%.  They should shave that much off your salary and you would just say oh okay?!
1338926877579255811 2020-12-16 03:20:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> I will be gone with Trump.
1338642646663745537 2020-12-15 08:30:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks for clarifying!
1338620264871956481 2020-12-15 07:01:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> I used to like youFrank and now I ten the TV off.  Where is the unemployment?  Bye state gestapo like gov and mayors.  The end.

1338160226139136000 2020-12-14 00:33:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> They have taken Dominion over us...
1337837725051830272 2020-12-13 03:12:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @mark9015pv Noooooooooooooooooo!
1337829447207010304 2020-12-13 02:39:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RepSwalwell By the chinese?
1337617100580405251 2020-12-12 12:35:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden And you should do your part—-concede.  Election fraud rampant.
1337605937750634499 2020-12-12 11:51:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Then why did the FBI leak on Paxton?
1337603743253028865 2020-12-12 11:42:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> A virtue signaling and shaming technique.
1337550960546045954 2020-12-12 08:12:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Send out that 26 member swat team by boat, helicopter and swat vehicle now.  Like for Roger Stone...
1337542869033238530 2020-12-12 07:40:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> Now let’s do something about it.
1337542265179279360 2020-12-12 07:38:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanking God!
1337539754275995649 2020-12-12 07:28:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @reubing Disgusting...
1337442295197487104 2020-12-12 01:01:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> Barr’s nickname was honey badger and a reported reputation of being honest and tough.  I remember him originally speaking out.  Threatened with impeachment he got quiet, ineffective and fell into line like a good little honey pussy.  Durham too. No guts, no glory reputation gone.
1337437655106142208 2020-12-12 00:42:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> Could you also consider action against MI AG that refuses to release information about the 22 Dominion machines forensically evaluated?!
1337436875514990594 2020-12-12 00:39:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Jimmymack010 @ShannonForTrump They want everyone to be stupid hence the education or lack thereof.  They want us all to believe their lies without question and rule through censorship.  They want to force vaccines which they want indemnity against financial liability.  They want all to be slaves.  Will we???
1337432246119108608 2020-12-12 00:21:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> No concerned.  Angry as hell.  No trust in the integrity of the election because of massive fraud.  Biden did not win.
1337427139268812800 2020-12-12 00:00:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> Covid primarily kills people that have preexisting conditions.  I believe bad numbers, bad choices and politics have taken a toll on Americans.  You stood in front of your ice cream essentially mocking people whose livelihood was ruined.  No $ as you wanted to ruin Trump/thus us.
1337253836361121792 2020-12-11 12:32:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Is it based on Fox viewers.  The fewer the colder it gets?!!!
1337230740535164928 2020-12-11 11:00:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> It was poisoned by voter fraud you fraud.
1337223200699138048 2020-12-11 10:30:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> Today I say that the people should not allow fraudulent elections to stand.  God bless Texas.
1337167775693852674 2020-12-11 06:50:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> My health is worth more than $1500.  But the fact they are paying says it all.
1337127493497573376 2020-12-11 04:10:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> I say bd
1337073469087862784 2020-12-11 00:35:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Matthew_4_Trump Now that is the question of the day!
1337059423651553283 2020-12-10 23:39:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pyles_corps After certification?
1336721485407252480 2020-12-10 01:16:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> No comment allowed?  Censorship abounds.  Liked the nickname #slowjoe
1336496853504815104 2020-12-09 10:24:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> Don’t believe you.
1336490711793876993 2020-12-09 09:59:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> And has admitted that she held up the aid.
1336489554111393793 2020-12-09 09:55:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> But where did you get it!
1336464616939917312 2020-12-09 08:16:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> A million thanks or more like 74 million!
1336462289835155457 2020-12-09 08:06:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> And this just talks about short term affects...
1336461425913389056 2020-12-09 08:03:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> As you write this I am pretty sure you don’t believe it yourself.  Dead people, fake ballots, vote counting frauds and on and on.  Even 25+ percent of Dems believe that it was a big fat lie in five blue states.
1336428763370831872 2020-12-09 05:53:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ppl in China turned their phones off.  Why does China not have covid anymore?  Wondering what is going on...
1336177553900412930 2020-12-08 13:15:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Open up. See what China is doing.  No Covid no vaccine.
1336120418617331712 2020-12-08 09:28:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> Look it up right!  Reported cases are negligible.  We are being had.
1336097679307227136 2020-12-08 07:58:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> No matter how many times I post this it never shows up.  Censoring the numbers they don’t want us to see?  https://t.co/mBul35svfS
1336095147201765376 2020-12-08 07:48:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> So how come China corona virus chart looks like this?  Flatlined with a few cars per day.  Obviously Fauxi and co is promoting covid in America.  https://t.co/szf64WKE5I
1336083262607802370 2020-12-08 07:00:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> Protect our republic.  No coup.
1336082703863595008 2020-12-08 06:58:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> This is known and what are our elected officials doing?
1336081759490854912 2020-12-08 06:54:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you sir.
1336016148144345091 2020-12-08 02:34:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> Did the riot, loot and burn?  Nope.
1335986434885341184 2020-12-08 00:36:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> And gets paid
1335790598113034240 2020-12-07 11:37:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> Staying open helps right?
1335787444436836358 2020-12-07 11:25:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> What about the 11/3/2020 election.  Are you fighting for that one?
1335771170910523393 2020-12-07 10:20:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why does China report so few cases?
1335759908306751489 2020-12-07 09:35:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> This is chin’s covid chart!!!  https://t.co/Y0ozBO1EU3
1335698312037429248 2020-12-07 05:31:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> It used to be that elections didn’t include massive cheating...
1335660754599493634 2020-12-07 03:01:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> Any comments to this?
1335660368098562048 2020-12-07 03:00:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Don’t we need to question what is going on in America???  This is China’s covid chart.  Are we really being played?  https://t.co/XtdVG4nykQ
1335653187513040897 2020-12-07 02:31:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @patton6966 And we must have integrity in the ballot box...
1335429086437502978 2020-12-06 11:41:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GeorgeHaught So sorry for your loss!
1335417266259705858 2020-12-06 10:54:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> I call bull on you.
1335416729426485248 2020-12-06 10:52:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @Perduesenate All about you?  When will you speak out about election fraud?
1335341000600895488 2020-12-06 05:51:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Barnes_Law And the smear campaign elevated to new levels.  Is Kyle prosecuted yet?
1335340290350059520 2020-12-06 05:48:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> Support the request for Georgia to look at the fraud.  No runoff should happen with the current system of election fraud.  You will not win under the current system.  Or did you get s special election deal?
1335339164179472384 2020-12-06 05:44:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> Right on the money mate!!!
1335337982748868608 2020-12-06 05:39:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> @scrowder I remember the reporting.
1335309030353334272 2020-12-06 03:44:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why not a Roger Stone type sentence?  It was a serious crime.
1335024916286955520 2020-12-05 08:55:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> I was thinking of the Republicans.  The fact that they are doing NOTHING about election fraud.  NOTHING.  It reminded me of democratic run states and cities.  Run down shitholes and yet people keep voting for the status quo.  Hoping if this election is stolen,a new party emerges.
1335021811780612096 2020-12-05 08:42:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> Probably good as we will all need it...we are being cheated on!
1335001841399054336 2020-12-05 07:23:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Somehow I think most of us just think you are lazy.  People have been watching without you.
1335000451784163328 2020-12-05 07:18:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Feisty_FL Because he Lin Wood)is amazing and successful.  I would always want him on my side.  He wins!
1334991830006394880 2020-12-05 06:43:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ppl have consistently not trusted the Bill Gates vaccine.  He is not a doc, wants population control and it is reported that his NGO vaccinations (polio) in India caused lifetime damage to 500k children. He wants indemnity to vaccinate the world.  &amp; introduce traceable ink marks.
1334941663391698944 2020-12-05 03:24:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You and Kamala take the Bill Gates one.
1334920431329898498 2020-12-05 02:00:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheMarkPantano Ya...like I just don’t believe you.  Trump won in a landslide.
1334920038541758464 2020-12-05 01:58:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Kelly, there is only one way to get the votes—-support Donald Trump and stop the fraud in Georgia.  We are waiting...
1334916570754080768 2020-12-05 01:44:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @grumpyo05098796 @DanCrenshawTX Thanks for this tweet.  Well said.
1334916051339890688 2020-12-05 01:42:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Where?  Bar tending?
1334730105545871361 2020-12-04 13:23:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> What I have repeatedly been told over and over is that is a simple gaffe.  You know like Biden does it all the time.
1334710269218525185 2020-12-04 12:05:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yeah.  I remember Dan Crenshaw the never Trumper.  Not too high in my regard.  Republicans best realize that there are about 73 million people that know the fraud in the blue states. We want to know that our reps are fighting for fair, honest elections starting this with one.
1334664231845646336 2020-12-04 09:02:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> That is why kids get through school without leading reading, writing and arithmetic.  Where the kids get lost in adult politics and we all lose.
1334657983796502537 2020-12-04 08:37:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MajorPatriot @leasertail Nope
1334618907966013441 2020-12-04 06:01:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @mechester2016 @thetoyman1 @POTUS He was excoriated for talking about HCQ and treatments?
1334513700758302723 2020-12-03 23:03:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JosephJFlynn1 @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump #IStandWithLinWood   Those trying to diminish Lin Wood and character assassination are simply jealous and evil.  I stand with him.
1334377336108552192 2020-12-03 14:02:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why are idiots like you trying to bully and intimidate 73 million Trump supporters that support Lin Wood?  I would chose him any day over your baloney.  And I remember your previous tweets.  Not impressed.  And angry.
1334374108826492928 2020-12-03 13:49:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @my3monkees @alaniz779100 @LLinWood Amen!
1334371527706361856 2020-12-03 13:38:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @prayingmedic Oh brother!  Pope-a-dope is at it again.    And yes, I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior!
1334361344426930176 2020-12-03 12:58:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> So what.  Right is right and he is fighting for voter integrity.  I am for him.
1334303094314659840 2020-12-03 09:07:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> Every vote ust be thrown out.  The found ballots should be illegal.
1334262191181062144 2020-12-03 06:24:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> What are you doing?
1334260320731217921 2020-12-03 06:17:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> But CNN publishing calls of the First Lady is fine for them and Trump tax returns too.  Weasels.
1334241539782897666 2020-12-03 05:02:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> So we are keeping a list like AOC!
1334007550904205313 2020-12-02 13:32:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> Is your wife okay?  We like hearing from her more than you.
1333937754476998656 2020-12-02 08:55:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> @EmeraldRobinson Emerald, I hate to say you were right!
1333936972914593792 2020-12-02 08:52:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> Great tweet!
1333930058352889857 2020-12-02 08:24:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SexCounseling Whose plan?
1333916555051036672 2020-12-02 07:31:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> I hope Barr is getting his arsenal handed to him with a “you are fired” ricocheting throughout the Oval Office.
1333837519637475328 2020-12-02 02:17:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> No I don’t join your fraudulent state.   America deserves free and fair elections.  This is like Venezuela ripe with cheating and fraud.  Shameful.
1333604881890832384 2020-12-01 10:52:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> And I personally think you signed onto defrauding the voters of your state as well as the nation.  I can’t see how you are saying it was successful unless your purpose was to perpetuate fraud.  Hopefully you will have to answer for your states skullduggery.
1333580362228797440 2020-12-01 09:15:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> So much voter fraud. So many attempts against against the President. So many supporters standing up for him.  Where is the GOP?  Hiding, but why?  Can he pull out a miracle!  He has before!
1333534988965351424 2020-12-01 06:14:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RyanAFournier Add me, I wasn’t asked!
1333495499651907585 2020-12-01 03:37:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> RSBN——Full coverage!
1333103541024481280 2020-11-30 01:40:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @ThaTitanFlow @kylenabecker Fauci said in 2017 that there would be a pandemic during Trump’s Presidency.  Sounds like a plandemic to me.
1333082580187377664 2020-11-30 00:17:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> @freeburlington @TheSharpEdge1 I am one!

1332915403886977024 2020-11-29 13:12:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoshShapiroPA And all real votes have been stolen by all those fraudulent votes.

1332857150478057475 2020-11-29 09:21:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> So sorry for your loss.  Wondering which blue state you live in?  So much misery has been committed in the name of covid.  Ppl say they hate big business and close down all the little guys.  Who wins?  Big Corp.  And we are even further divided.
1332854201102127104 2020-11-29 09:09:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> @conmomma @Mariasinapi1 Yes, unbelievable.  And wrong.
1332812542045949952 2020-11-29 06:24:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden Not my president elect.
1332793738083569669 2020-11-29 05:09:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 No one else does?!
1332741663572148230 2020-11-29 01:42:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> @proxcee And Dem states had more votes than voters?
1332722625601175552 2020-11-29 00:26:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @CNNPolitics Don’t believe you.
1332720543208935426 2020-11-29 00:18:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> And you are writing about it now?   Did you title the piece profile in courage?
1332513149669363713 2020-11-28 10:34:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> I truly believe  #BidenCheated
1332505976885313538 2020-11-28 10:05:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrZin14 @thehill Thank goodness the President is carving out some time for himself!!
1332505225857429504 2020-11-28 10:02:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> @EricMMatheny We have the door pull, bus chaser special forces.  Not sure of anything else?
1332444035227607041 2020-11-28 05:59:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews As soon as Trump doesn’t need his digital warriors here!
1332430158590951424 2020-11-28 05:04:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> I watched on TV that they have slave block in Libya and a slave cost $400.
1332350092527820800 2020-11-27 23:46:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Alyssa_Milano Ps.  I don’t believe it nor does about 73 million other Americans.
1332343962024046593 2020-11-27 23:22:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RepRoKhanna That the country would go broke.

1332159507598741510 2020-11-27 11:09:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> @kaitlancollins You are apparently uneducated and uninterested and most probably biased.  Don’t get naked and scream.  I really hate seeing that scene.
1332046043400216576 2020-11-27 03:38:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> @no_silenced @the1murdock Well said!
1332043497453457408 2020-11-27 03:28:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> @theangiestanton So sorry
1332022080024375297 2020-11-27 02:03:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Acosta Hee hee! Like forget my nastiest comments about Trump... Did you report on the PA Senate hearing or the lawsuits?  Biden will not be Pres after fraud is revealed.  He said he had the biggest fraud network in history.  Healing can occur once the deceit and deceivers are rooted out
1331814783968972800 2020-11-26 12:19:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> And they want a bailout???
1331807341063282689 2020-11-26 11:49:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> So you are denying all the information that came out?  The reasons that the FBI dropped the case due to exculpatory evidence?  Just the continual biased opinions as usual.
1331779098771824640 2020-11-26 09:57:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> And so glad that fraud is being uncovered.  Let’s clean up elections.
1331697522482536450 2020-11-26 04:33:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Can an election where they sent out 1.8 million mail in ballots and recorded 2.5 million returned mail in ballots be certified.   No.
1331696357711761413 2020-11-26 04:28:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Jim_Jordan And Fauci predicted the pandemic under Trump.
1331695437384982528 2020-11-26 04:25:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KelemenCari And did he get a kickback?

1331666146576109568 2020-11-26 02:28:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> @LATiffani1 And Paul Ryan can boast that he did it.
1331644152031809537 2020-11-26 01:01:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MrMichaelBurkes I want the court to free him.  Pardon is last option.

1331473105106071554 2020-11-25 13:41:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> But we have been.
1331472266673078273 2020-11-25 13:38:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden When President Trump is elected for four more years we expect you to use this same rhetoric.
1331461792103424000 2020-11-25 12:56:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> Comments about we did it realize they got what they deserved!

1331434577269727233 2020-11-25 11:08:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Your tweets have been literally repulsive, crude and vulgar.  Not interested... and no I would not see anything you are in.  You’ve written your own nasty woman story too well.
1331402283007938563 2020-11-25 09:00:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KristiSiaperas It is really hard and sometimes those core differences really matter.    But hopefully we can all figure out to agree to disagree with our family members as those are relationships we want to keep.
1331371594942472193 2020-11-25 06:58:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> With friends like you, who needs enemies?
1331370658383556610 2020-11-25 06:54:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> @joepalojoe @gatewaypundit And all the “errors” in favor of Biden?

1331299127930486787 2020-11-25 02:10:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Jim, apparently you believe that suddenly you will be believed and people will respect you if Biden gets in power.  Sorry.  You have to gain trust and respect.  And frankly, you have not.  We are not sheep to your propagandizing.

1331031529112309761 2020-11-24 08:27:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> @brainburp13 It is as reported that Fox head honchos wife exclaimed “we did it” about Biden.    So happy to see that America responded in kind and said “we did it”.     And hope you shop at the thrift store with the rest of us!
1331029217480359937 2020-11-24 08:17:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Thomas1774Paine He should look in the mirror to see embarrassment.

There are so many states with dead people voting, votes greater than residents, massive multiple ballots from one address. Vote counting halted in the middle of the night and resulting in monumental changes in votes.  It worldwide are speaking out.  Integrity

Why are ballots not secured?  Why are voting systems flipping votes.  Why are officials denying the potential for fraud?  America’s deserve honesty.

1324618176626241536 2020-11-06 15:42:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> @PastorDScott Bill Gates is running after us with a vaccine needle with Fauci and Soros trying to herd us into a corner.

1324545151415459841 2020-11-06 10:52:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump I will never vote for you.
1324538496711749634 2020-11-06 10:26:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RedWingGrips I wrote my GOP congressman also.  We need to demand election change.  Presidential elections should not be vulnerable to fraud.  PA has had several convicted of ballot stuffing for Dem for $$$.  End this.  BTW who in DOJ is paid to ensure election integrity??

1324494142416674817 2020-11-06 07:29:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @charliekirk11 No matter if this happens we need to have election changes.  Need fair and accurate elections.  Voter I’d.
1324489336155369472 2020-11-06 07:10:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @tedcruz @gehrig38 Yay
1324486324175265792 2020-11-06 06:58:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GOPLeader What are you specifically doing.  Just saying so is irrelevant.  What actionable steps are being taken?  And what about inhaling votes.  What are you doing?
1324486000454721536 2020-11-06 06:57:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GOPLeader What are you specifically doing.  Just saying so is irrelevant.  What actionable steps are being taken?
1324483157668757504 2020-11-06 06:46:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrShayPhD I wrote my Republican Congressman saying no support for honest election then no re-election.  I mean it.
1324482404141002755 2020-11-06 06:43:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why are they, DOJ, not responsible for fair elections in USA?  Found ballots, more votes than voters, dead people are voting.  This is wrong.
1324406110153928704 2020-11-06 01:39:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> @kenningtonsays And Biden’s incoherence was astounding.

1324373948683833351 2020-11-05 23:32:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DJDeMario1 Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs

1324218024400834560 2020-11-05 13:12:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> No.  You have betrayed conservatives for years.  And Fox has outfoxed itself.  People are dons being treated like you believe Biden—-that we are ugly dumb chumps.  Who believes that guy got all those votes?  No one.
1324163900850331648 2020-11-05 09:37:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> @marthamaccallum @BretBaier @BillHemmer Yup and a lonely road for you fraudsters.  Calling AZ with 1% of the vote in at Fox.  I think you outfoxed yourself this time.  Many of us are done with Fox.  You can keep Paul Ryan too.
1324144289861914625 2020-11-05 08:19:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> How could they have processed that many?!
1324133509145915392 2020-11-05 07:36:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DarrenJBeattie They are already done in my books.

1324113770847768576 2020-11-05 06:18:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> @BretBaier You may not realize it yet Brett, but America will be voting you out of our homes.  Now.

1323777387079766017 2020-11-04 08:01:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> @CHIZMAGA Gads that is a terrible lineup.  Thanks further warning!

1323701545947422720 2020-11-04 03:00:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Thomas1774Paine Gads I was confused.  I thought that was Jeffrey Toobin.  My bad!
1323697354914983936 2020-11-04 02:43:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> @dbongino I voted today!
1323503755367575552 2020-11-03 13:54:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> @vakaviti @thetoyman1 Hate to tell you that you are getting a Christmas lump of coal and the “big guy Biden” is losing.  Trust the rallies which is showing love and support for the President

1323500733900103680 2020-11-03 13:42:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JackPosobiec Yup,us ugly chumps that will vote for Trumps vision of the future!!
1323460276025348097 2020-11-03 11:01:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @USAloveGOD @goldwaterkid65 And what was that thing of taking a drink from the can and then throwing it down.   I thought they cared about the environment?!
1323357923070734336 2020-11-03 04:14:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> You are unbelievable.  I demand that the votes be counted and that people like you representing the entire state (Dem and Repub) provide fair and accurate elections.
1323298338721001472 2020-11-03 00:18:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DanScavino It is!  A friend called me almost in tears asking if I still support Trump.  Well yes I do.  TDS at its finest.  She hates him so bad she can’t stand the idea of people actually supporting him.  Rachel Maddow really has shaped a lot of Dems thinking against the President...MSM.
1322987057111654400 2020-11-02 03:41:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @liquidlaugh Joe has no idea where he is most of the time?
1322931068584947712 2020-11-01 23:58:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @gatewaypundit Why?  I don’t trust them either.
1322924759290531840 2020-11-01 23:33:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @johncardillo And I think Fauci should be audited for financial gains during this pandemic.  You know, the pandemic he said in 2017 would happen under Trump.  Like he knew in advance?
1322767792525897733 2020-11-01 13:09:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> Isn’t he locking down everyone again.  But it’s okay he is doing it equally so that men and women can economically suffer but equally so.  But bully for him right?
1322763302749970432 2020-11-01 12:52:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GregRubini @melissacali Let it be!  Please let it be!!!
1322761979308642307 2020-11-01 12:46:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @silver_fox9 @DayumMaam Yes and a smelly walmart shopper that clings to my gun and bible.
1321601718149238784 2020-10-29 07:56:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> They need to show their courage.  The world is watching.

1321561897590665217 2020-10-29 05:18:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JackPosobiec He even sits crooked!
1321499144758779904 2020-10-29 01:08:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NickAdamsinUSA Unethical
1321283585844731904 2020-10-28 10:52:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> @paulsperry_ And I recollect Zeke speaking out as a population control advocate.  No expensive life saving for children under two or for the unproductive elderly.  No thanks.
1321233155496448001 2020-10-28 07:31:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrBiden It is spelled Trump.  It is indecent to run a candidate, Joe, that closes shop at 9:30 am.  World leaders would crush America under Biden.
1321231777751429120 2020-10-28 07:26:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @proxcee And Biden said he joined the Senate 180 years ago...not kidding.
1320961443781488640 2020-10-27 13:32:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Breaking911 What do the Schumer comments about millions of unborn children suffering even mean?
1320959642256637953 2020-10-27 13:24:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KamalaHarris This was totally legal and legitimate and to say otherwise is hogwash pure and simple.
1320467647209730048 2020-10-26 04:49:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> I have watched the ad with healthcare workers saying that in January Trump should have had testing and tracking.  In fact, tHe original test failed and what about all $$ given to Health &amp; Human Services nationwide for pandemic readiness.  Disingenuous.
1320465827687100417 2020-10-26 04:42:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KamalaHarris I thought that was illegal.  Trump supporters can now use blow horns in voter lines to message to vote for Trump?!

1318977553206374401 2020-10-22 02:08:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pushforward40 I can comment.
1318683604617097216 2020-10-21 06:40:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Apparently you missed the daily briefings with Fauci and Birx...or are they not scientists.  Hard to think I must say that?
1318663557362282497 2020-10-21 05:21:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GregRubini Question is too hard and add Juan Williams

1318600325121519616 2020-10-21 01:09:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> Be sure to take pictures of those guns you love so you can remember them.  Biden’s admin says guns no ore.  And Trump did not octhe disabled.
1318393891842715649 2020-10-20 11:29:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheBrandonMorse This should come with a warning!

1318360589802991616 2020-10-20 09:17:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @liquidlaugh Is he the John Roberts that was on Epstein Island?
1318350476602036225 2020-10-20 08:37:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Sen_JoeManchin Manypeople in America do not see Anthony Fauci through your rose colored glasses.  In fact, I think his relationship with the Gates Foundation should bear scrutiny.  He funded the Wuhan in 2015 while covid was not legal in US.  I have no trust.  Don’t wear mask then wear masks??!
1318273826388520961 2020-10-20 03:32:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RedSkyRevenge @realRyanPence Hope it makes them sick.

1317947270822678529 2020-10-19 05:54:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DanRather Well that ain’t lying Biden’s America.  He has been a known liar for decades including dropping out of the 1988 Pres race for plagiarism and misrepresenting himself.  He has been on a personal enrichment career and no one can name an achievement...
1317694700917174273 2020-10-18 13:11:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> @BretBaier @JoeBiden I’ll believe it when I see it.
1317694263304486913 2020-10-18 13:09:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> I agree with the headline—-the Dems are coup coup.
1317693460401463297 2020-10-18 13:06:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> Trump 220!

1317507100554063872 2020-10-18 00:45:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Hoosiers1986 @JoeBiden Yes, Biden’s have been had.  And I for one don’t want to pay for it.  Don’t want to find out the meaning of what is is!
1317506311337046017 2020-10-18 00:42:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> And he got stung in his own trap of partying and drugs.  You think those foreign money bags wouldn’t exploit the situation then and now.  The Biden’s took the bait and are compromised.
1317485565898416128 2020-10-17 23:20:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenKamalaHarris Yes we will always celebrate their courage at this moment in history!  And we wii never forget your treachery toward Kavanaugh.

1317306810848571394 2020-10-17 11:29:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> @ThorDeplorable @Trumplestiltsk Tell the FBI as they trying to discredit the story
1317266192055169024 2020-10-17 08:48:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> @donaldrusso994 10-especially over the White supremacist continuing false attack.  Liars lie.
1317178824107249664 2020-10-17 03:01:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> @realDailyWire Actually that is stupid and immoral.  I would have been fine living without Fleetwood Mac.  Now Mac and Cheese, might be different...
1317171348184080385 2020-10-17 02:31:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenSchumer A lot of people think that you don’t tell the truth.
1317117352488493057 2020-10-16 22:57:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> Just clearing out the chaff!
1316940873263886337 2020-10-16 11:15:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> It is terrible that they pull themselves up to the dinner table all while shutting down businesses and the economy for everyone else.  Totally disgusting elitism.  They apparently think, let me eat more of that frozen ice cream.
1316923960618090498 2020-10-16 10:08:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Or child support
1316818945182035969 2020-10-16 03:11:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> Do you are saying Joe lied when he bragged about getting the prosecutor fired?
1316813584773517312 2020-10-16 02:49:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DavidNakamura Have you ever pushed back or asked any difficult questions if Joe Biden?  I sure haven’t seen any!
1316813127426609152 2020-10-16 02:48:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DanRather I do believe you lost it...
1316735872717320192 2020-10-15 21:41:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> It already on my watch list.  Trump 2020.
1316607557750779904 2020-10-15 13:11:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AndyK1005 @latimes You can watch Biden drool as he tells you he is running for the Senate one more time and joined the Senate 180 years ago.  You know the thing.  Maybe they will ask him about Hunter’s laptop and peddling influence in the Ukraine.  It could be interesting?
1316603986108018689 2020-10-15 12:57:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @rising_serpent Well said
1316546528509452288 2020-10-15 09:08:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well son of a bitch.  Biden, himself, said he got the prosecutor fired so Ukraine got the Billion $.
1316429616710594566 2020-10-15 01:24:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @HeyTammyBruce Tammy, it is about deception, lies and cheating.  Getting huge payoffs for political favors is not in the best interest of America.  More will come out!
1316428140038819842 2020-10-15 01:18:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Love it!
1316425199458422784 2020-10-15 01:06:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TBeansprout @BryonnyM Tears of gratitude for the generosity of this man.  So nice to see goodness.
1316387101252878337 2020-10-14 22:35:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes.
1316227829495787520 2020-10-14 12:02:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well you surely shouldn’t have waited to do our business, the people’s business, until mid October.  Very shameful to pull that kind of lousy head faking.  I personally want a full SC.
1316150419492466690 2020-10-14 06:54:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> What a bunch of bulloney...ACB needs to move forward.  It is the right thing to do for us voters that already elected Trump for this reason.  I thought they said it’s not politics.  Do you have a recording of RBG last wish and what difference anyway?  No SC successor appointment
1316108497965080576 2020-10-14 04:08:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> And I simply don’t believe you have a crystal ball or you are really clairvoyant.  The phrase porn fear seems utterly appropriate just as though it was written for you.
1316096481737105408 2020-10-14 03:20:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 No.
1316096104023257088 2020-10-14 03:18:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> @HillaryClinton Says the woman who said to Congress about four dead in Benghazi “at this point, what difference does it make”.  And a small fraction of people died from covid alone per CDC.  Most people had co-morbidities and a huge number died in nursing home due to Dem gov terrible policies.
1316087672054505472 2020-10-14 02:45:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> Whitmer has the police go to a home because someone reported a child had a play date at the neighbors.  In one state they set up a snitch line to report friends and fellow citizens.  Snitchers were upset when someone snitched on them!  WA, NY and CA also had snitch lines.  Bad.
1316070954888355841 2020-10-14 01:39:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks for your tweet!
1316069359278673920 2020-10-14 01:32:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> Women shouldn’t use abortion as birth control. In this day and age there are birth control pills, morning after pills and don’t forget the condoms.  As an older woman you must not know the options now available besides abortion.
1316046688247668736 2020-10-14 00:02:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump He should be excited.  I heard the overflow crowd was about 70k!
1315844422597132294 2020-10-13 10:38:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> @jamesplake721 @Mariasinapi1 Good luck!
1315838269947441153 2020-10-13 10:14:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AOC Amazing to hear an advocate of abortion decrying “barbarism”.
1315816235032928258 2020-10-13 08:46:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ha ha ha.  Booker is joking right?
1315799173829021696 2020-10-13 07:39:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @swamp_nugget @amicah1 Totally agree.  Also, Paul Ryan leaves his mark (ruination) where ever he goes.  Fox started changing with Ryan on the Board of Directors.  Sad really.
1315774058718347265 2020-10-13 05:59:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> And that is exactly why I voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him in 2020.  As President he is responsible for filling the vacancy—-totally legal, ethical and legitimate.
1315724405276729344 2020-10-13 02:41:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes but not if Trump were re-elected right?! I think she meant a new Pres.  She could have retired in the Obama Admin when house and senate were Dems.  She also said a Pres serves four  years and no court packing.  Provable statements.  Not so with death wishes.
1315721926568943616 2020-10-13 02:32:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JRubinBlogger Actually none
1315399502874902528 2020-10-12 05:10:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes.  Ppl have been killed.
1315366919327760384 2020-10-12 03:01:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @nytimes So setting it up to say Joe had it?
1315364218527346693 2020-10-12 02:50:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Attempted Symantec chicanery.
1315362664164421632 2020-10-12 02:44:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> Due to your bias you should recuse yourself from voting on her confirmation
1315325818155851777 2020-10-12 00:18:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> Apparently Biden recently said he was for a 15 million dollar minimum wage and corrected it to 15k.  I laughed and then thought of Venezuela and the super inflation and thought- maybe he means it!  In Venezuela under socialism people are starving.  No thanks.
1315324506873843713 2020-10-12 00:12:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> @conservative245 Thank you.
1315322077251952641 2020-10-12 00:03:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> Tell Chris that wishing won’t make Biden okay.
1315321579484504071 2020-10-12 00:01:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Scaramucci Too funny!  That famous tweet to you didn’t really make your opinion relevant
1315041132598816768 2020-10-11 05:26:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Beg1Girl And De Niro is in a new release.  I would paint an outhouse before going to see his sorry arse.
1315039113385447424 2020-10-11 05:18:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> The Commission members should be ashamed of themselves, most especially the Republicans that have placed personal bias over the public right to a fair and balanced debate.  I am getting sick of RINO/deep staters trying to ruin America to “get Trump”.
1315036247916650496 2020-10-11 05:07:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Big meal and he had gas?

1315030878272122881 2020-10-11 04:46:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AngelWarrior321 Arson
1315030240326946816 2020-10-11 04:43:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Count this as a letter supporting filling the SC and the Pres and Senate must do its job.  I didn’t like all the actions you and your cohorts have done to wreck the country and economy.  Especially your coup attempts.  We need a full SC.
1314972892942069761 2020-10-11 00:55:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> Imagine people not believing that Joe’s old intern would be impartial.  And not believing that hacking story about tweeting Trumps enemy.  Oh yeah, busted.  I don’t believe he would have asked Joe any tough questions that would have made him look bad.  Trump on the other hand...
1314971109557583872 2020-10-11 00:48:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> @carraybb @iDaveHasQuesti1 Kamala has shown herself by  -locking up blacks for marijuana and then giggled about smoking pot herself.    -took donations from PP and stopped journos from reporting on the selling of fetuses.    -promoted burning and rioting and bailed criminals out of jail thus stoking riots.
1314953539152535554 2020-10-10 23:38:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes.
1314950424089096192 2020-10-10 23:26:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @LatulippeSteven Congratulations.  What a blessing!
1314941640285409282 2020-10-10 22:51:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @thebradfordfile I am voting for Trump because he is heralding in world peace.  America needs Trump and the world needs Trump!
1314940544313778176 2020-10-10 22:47:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @zx101z Especially since they were all about yoga and weddings...right?
1314818843403931653 2020-10-10 14:43:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> According to the fact checkers, you are right.  Kamala was the super spreader.  I thought Joe’s campaign was something like no malarkey.  And yet neither can hold a position and lie about Trump?
1314817496608772098 2020-10-10 14:38:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MajorPatriot Many Americans know.
1314815737828057088 2020-10-10 14:31:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pacasandrs And, dear God, her cackles raise a persons shackles.
1314772739039744000 2020-10-10 11:40:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> I remember when the Bush/Gore FL hanging chad and every vote must count proclaimed the Dems.  I was a dem so was right there.  4 yrs later the Dems argued that only 50% of the votes in FL should count. Spare me with the Dem talking points about counting votes.  Walk away!
1314763727426658304 2020-10-10 11:04:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RyanAFournier And ppl can just stop there  feigning shock.  I remember Biden was asked by a reporter how he was doing.  He was angry he was two hours late on the train.  His response was how the Fuck do you think I am doing.  They passed a bill and he called it a big fucking deal.  So F! it!
1314701018886594561 2020-10-10 06:55:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> @thehill Joe had no idea what to do?  I noticed one guy actually running out!!!
1314699734288789504 2020-10-10 06:50:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> Old man Bush touted the One World Order.  There is a lot of people that don’t have the best interests of America at heart.

1314677622400409600 2020-10-10 05:22:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DigiDiva2020 I remember that Keith said every night on his show that Bill O’Reilly was the worst person in the world.  Every night?  He apparently never got over his spewing of wrath and hatred. Sorry for you Keith...
1314671641545244672 2020-10-10 04:58:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrShayPhD I love your sense of humor!
1314669433592266752 2020-10-10 04:49:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> Great tweet and unfortunately true.
1314667140566315008 2020-10-10 04:40:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> Go to Biden if you want but most of my retired friends are voting for Trump.  Lots of smart people that don’t want a dude that joined the Senate 180 years ago(per his words).
1314605771087257600 2020-10-10 00:36:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Anthony, you may not care at all that I liked you but seeing the dirty, underbelly side has come out, you lost me.
1314601486471503874 2020-10-10 00:19:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> And Bill Gates thinks he can take over the country with his vaccinations?
1314380307487809537 2020-10-09 09:40:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SJPFISH @Jamierodr14 Wow.  And she thinks anyone would want to watch her?
1314285083478556672 2020-10-09 03:22:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Kamala Harris VP debate.  Pence I got you now was the gleeful look on Harris face.  In 1864...  what?!...
1314284433978003456 2020-10-09 03:20:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> Bulloney.  She got her wings clipped by her Supreme Court.  Whitney is going for sympathy.
1314280264156082176 2020-10-09 03:03:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RoscoeBDavis1 @goldwaterkid65 Who can stand (or sit) watching her?
1314276861996752898 2020-10-09 02:49:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> @LindsayWigo @Woke2008 The answer is clear by Joe Biden-he will “get rid of fossil fuels”.  Clearly stated...
1314043883974660097 2020-10-08 11:24:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> Does Kampala’s bloody nose bother you!
1314039835238100992 2020-10-08 11:08:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> This parody account isn’t even close to being funny or comedy.
1314038076075765760 2020-10-08 11:01:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @my3monkees No
1314037937420468224 2020-10-08 11:00:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DailyCaller Mike Pence.  The Biden-Harris ticket continues to perpetuate the lie that Trump didn’t renounce white supremacy (which he resoundingly did).  They just come off as liars.
1313926888734171136 2020-10-08 03:39:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> And vote for Trump!!!
1313910084154519552 2020-10-08 02:32:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> Great tweet!
1313909767409078273 2020-10-08 02:31:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SpeakerPelosi Actually this was a Democrat giveaway to Democrat failed states to make all taxpayers liable for fiscal failures.  Why would someone like in SC,MT who gets 50% of their income in retirement pay someone in CA, IL, NY (etc) to get 100%.  Total inequality.  Bless Trump!
1313907953158635520 2020-10-08 02:24:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden Is this a demand?  Is your intention to silence our free speech?  Explain why you even feel you have any right to say this.
1313907080873439232 2020-10-08 02:20:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Many viewers are seeing a hard left turn and are now able to only support a few of Foxes ppl.  We are tired of the lies perpetrated on the public to slime/coup the Pres.  The recent documents released displays the selling out media engaged in over 3 + years.  To the good ones👍
1313901593314521088 2020-10-08 01:58:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> You didn’t accomplish anything toward unity as Senator or Vice President.  In fact division was increased in the Obama-Biden administration.  In 47 years you got nothing.  Nothing to prove your actions have any positive impact that I have seen?
1313867354871271424 2020-10-07 23:42:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> @PamRotella Yes, on Ingraham Angle and one other show.  On Varney today, a couple thousand Drs and medical ppl just signed a letter saying we need to reopen.  There is concern that ppl are not getting diagnosed and treated for illnesses like cancer and kids missing vaccinations.
1313689807428542468 2020-10-07 11:57:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Maximus_4EVR @JoeBiden Shows what a liar he truly is.
1313689378535874560 2020-10-07 11:55:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> And impacted the 2018 election too.  Criminal.
1313686786279763974 2020-10-07 11:45:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> I saw three doctors today say that Trump is fine and has none of the symptoms you are describing.  They laughed.  MSM fake news again.
1313685586222358529 2020-10-07 11:40:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, and what should happen to those that knew and perpetuated the lies and coup.  The SC alone cost approximately 40 million.  The coup attempters not taxpayers should be on the hook and pay for the hoax.
1313639258800836608 2020-10-07 08:36:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> No words?  Then why write this junk?  Do you wear your masks at home?  WH is Trumps home as much as you hate that fact.  People just aren’t fooled by your fear mongering.
1313570740092825600 2020-10-07 04:04:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why?  Oh I get it.  Because you hate him.
1313561431967633408 2020-10-07 03:27:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> It is totally legal and legit to fill the SC seat and myself and many others voted for Trump to do so.
1313560045527859200 2020-10-07 03:21:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Good deal for American.  Dem run cities and states are trying to kill the economy and their residents are leaving to get better lives.  Don’t tax us for their failures.
1313557461563965440 2020-10-07 03:11:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> You apparently missed the CDC update that less than 10k died from covid alone.  The rest had comorbidity factors.  Governors in NY,NJ, PA and MI put covid ppl in nursing homes causing death and mayhem.  Facts matter.
1313520790067843073 2020-10-07 00:45:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeyCawbs Too hard of a question!
1313508117884280833 2020-10-06 23:55:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Cuomo’s Eastern weekend:  Cuomo was in quarantine and ripped his mask off, drove to East Hampton with others, fought with a biker and slinked back in his basement.  He later videoed himself as just coming out of his basement.  What a load of dishonesty!
1313348908559425537 2020-10-06 13:22:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> Really that is your call.  No one is forcing you and if you are  TDS you would be doing America a favor by self isolating until covid is over.  You know so you won’t get it or spread it.
1313284433328316416 2020-10-06 09:06:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well thank God.  How nice for us.
1313216212168368129 2020-10-06 04:35:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes every word you said!!!
1313215960258551808 2020-10-06 04:34:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, and according to recent reporting through closed windows, masks worn and in a passing car.  So go live life while you can,  that is the best option right?!
1313213884505808897 2020-10-06 04:26:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> @jsolomonReports @lightning7876 Roberts may be singing Johnny Cash —-I see the train a comin, coming around the bend.  Was he the John Roberts flying to Epstein Island?  We deserve to know if he is being blackmailed.
1313162449189703680 2020-10-06 01:01:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Destiny3650 If I recall correctly, that was how Obama always said he heard the news!
1313161712820867072 2020-10-06 00:58:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> With all the shenanigans perpetuated by the Dems to overthrow the President, shouldn’t you check yourself into jail for attempting a coup?
1312939443154612224 2020-10-05 10:15:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> @LegallyAutumn Yup.  The polls are not accurate and the people love him.
1312938605376016385 2020-10-05 10:12:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> Maybe he can move into the basement with Joe.
1312919954971258882 2020-10-05 08:58:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> Of course they did!  Otherwise he would have had to escape in that blue gown with the ties in the back.  The media would have noticed!
1312915230112968705 2020-10-05 08:39:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> They are projecting an illusion that he has supporters.  The three car rallies and events attended by no one defies their lies!!!
1312913447697276928 2020-10-05 08:32:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> She means it and is hoping.
1312906996094431232 2020-10-05 08:06:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> No Valarie.  You put people in coffins in Benghazi because you would give them no ride at all.  They were in mortal danger and asked for help and no ride whatsoever came to save them.
1312902837815316480 2020-10-05 07:50:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> So you must be voting for the guy that literally said he joined the Senate 180 years ago and that will be comforting to you!
1312898320319225856 2020-10-05 07:32:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> And I thought masks and distancing worked.  They must be lying to us all if now medical people say we can catch it from a passing automobile.
1312862586241572864 2020-10-05 05:10:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> I like actors that can act.
1312814338122551296 2020-10-05 01:58:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> Donald Trump will get well.  Michael Moore will not-ever.
1312806129991184384 2020-10-05 01:25:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoyVBehar Why do you need a mouth?
1312620004248961025 2020-10-04 13:06:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @stirednotshakn I wouldn’t watch Biased Wallace on any day.
1312600471454928896 2020-10-04 11:48:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why would they?
1312480713615175681 2020-10-04 03:52:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @VenturaReport Now that is peaceful folks.
1312480359540387842 2020-10-04 03:51:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> Funny, I saw a Doctor use an e-cig and various masks to show what happens.  Well it demonstrated masks don’t protect the other guy  and my take away was not you either.  Fauci himself said masks don’t work.
1312478697606144000 2020-10-04 03:44:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AnthemRespect Don’t offer it if you haven’t got it!
1312474917087047680 2020-10-04 03:29:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> Or I call him Pope-a-Dope but I I like yours!
1312473519825985537 2020-10-04 03:24:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> That is aPelosi hitman strategy.  She described it herself on camera while smirking that she is so smart.  And thinks we are both stupid and gullible.  Don’t be Pelosied!
1312470912118136832 2020-10-04 03:13:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrShayPhD And the homeless too.
1312469789869105153 2020-10-04 03:09:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump Agree
1312441161471025157 2020-10-04 01:15:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AdamMilstein @2020jmho Well said!
1312440220562776064 2020-10-04 01:11:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ah, yes there is.  You think the mail in ballot stuffing Dem election stealing ploy will work.  It won’t and we need a full SC.
1312437267152035840 2020-10-04 01:00:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Biden would be want a lockdown so he could continue with minimal operation.  Basement dwelling in the big house!  No thanks.
1312436728787922945 2020-10-04 00:57:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Then you should be even more concerned about Biden and his basement campaign.  Why do you think he would be different in the WH?  His health and mental acuity should concern all.
1312418757663354880 2020-10-03 23:46:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> And millions of Americans disagree and love Trump.  We look at Biden and shake our heads at how you can support a man clearly struggling.  In his language we say “come on man” you are a “clown”. He said he joined the Senate 180 years ago which should tell you something.
1312417397559627782 2020-10-03 23:41:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well he did over power I mean powerhouse a bunch of women....
1312412564244983808 2020-10-03 23:21:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Pismo_B @BryonnyM Their are a lot of Trump supporters in the world!
1312411357652766721 2020-10-03 23:17:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RichardGrenell @ChapmanNancy @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Yeah, he’s a clown right!
1312409836462645249 2020-10-03 23:11:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RichardGrenell @ChapmanNancy Yeah, what a clown right?
1312406674485866496 2020-10-03 22:58:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> @PowerNation22 @Destiny3650 At some point it becomes glaring lies as the people know the truth.  The fact that reporters think that they can get away with it reflects their overwhelming biased reporting.  Brings to mind the Emperor has no clothes on story.  Just the naked truth right?!
1312404425911140352 2020-10-03 22:49:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @silver_fox9 @realJediMan1 @Acosta Yes
1312403826327003138 2020-10-03 22:47:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @CraigAr64 @ShawnG927 Heck he can barely stand himself!
1312400024874090497 2020-10-03 22:32:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Nick_Clamorgan @KidukSong @washingtonpost I know.  Disgusting but you are right it shows what low life’s they really are.
1312198313781850112 2020-10-03 09:10:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @mikiebarb You are a really funny guy.  I assume this was sarcastic, tongue in check humor.  Trump will win in 2020😀😀😀
1312195890489171968 2020-10-03 09:00:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks for this tweet!
1312108273164668931 2020-10-03 03:12:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> And the Washington Post  https://t.co/xLhcYXwyan
1312096068138491904 2020-10-03 02:24:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> @tuckidge @gsteck74 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS You are sick and it shows Dems will lose in Nov.
1312092774737403904 2020-10-03 02:11:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ha ha. That is what they said about Hillary winning.  I think the odds were 100% certainty for her.  I agree Dems didn’t think they needed to cheat as bad as they do this time.  Any location that has more votes than residents should invalidate that election. ..Not count.
1312037077580537856 2020-10-02 22:29:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> Typical democrat accusation with no foundation.  I have heard the reports that CIA and spy agencies knew you concocted the Russian hoax—-you personally.  Evilness.  PS Trump nominated 3 X for the Nobel Peace Prize (so far!)😀
1311874659969720324 2020-10-02 11:44:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @my3monkees I totally agree.  I also like Lou Dobbs and Elizabeth McDonald on Fox Business!
1311720661929263105 2020-10-02 01:32:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> I hope you are right.
1311708291551039493 2020-10-02 00:43:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> The debate was Wallaced.  A biased, TDS moderator was in full operation mode.
1311551461285752832 2020-10-01 14:20:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrewHolden360 Drew, Great job.
1311513178224779268 2020-10-01 11:48:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> @thetoyman1 I watched it once and concur.  Wallace/Biden teamed up against Trump.  Wallace was as bad if not worse than Candy Crowley.
1311459932743458816 2020-10-01 08:16:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> Not a public building?
1311353319982473216 2020-10-01 01:12:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @tom_trotts @Pismo_B Great analysis!
1311135332730048512 2020-09-30 10:46:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> Biden lied  and then lied some more.  My fact checking!
1311125093980930048 2020-09-30 10:05:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why is aWallace letting Biden interrupt every time.
1311100684184371202 2020-09-30 08:28:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> How long have you floated this of the 47 years you have made political promises.
1311076998987411456 2020-09-30 06:54:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Why do you think anyone  cares about a bunch of overpaid, anthem kneelers?  It is your right to kneel but it’s our right to not watch.  We win, you lose.
1311013240160231426 2020-09-30 02:41:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NYGovCuomo I notice that leaders talk about mandating masks, but fail to follow their own dictates.  The latest recent example was Diane Feinstein.
1310725770516537344 2020-09-29 07:39:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> The word is wish.  Not a dictate or a requirement and not even a request.  It is nothing and is without any evidence to support the validity of the story.  There is just a bunch of liberals shouting malarkey.  Replacing RBG is legal and proper.
1310724423750578180 2020-09-29 07:33:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> He might miss the cup?!
1310713014841008129 2020-09-29 06:48:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> This says it all!  Creepy screaming if you don’t like what you see.
1310710939688214528 2020-09-29 06:40:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> And it has been reported in Texas today.  Extra ballots, ballots in ditches and ballot harvesting.  Hope there is a law against more votes than residents and citizens.
1310703516411768832 2020-09-29 06:10:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> I thought you owed money on your taxes that were unpaid?!
1310696718158053378 2020-09-29 05:43:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> Get Murkowsky out of there.
1310685556980854784 2020-09-29 04:59:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TimRunsHisMouth No Harris has the hyena laugh.  She does it at the weirdest times!
1310684218217738240 2020-09-29 04:54:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Is that a brilliant legal argument?
1310648576490438656 2020-09-29 02:32:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Christopher Wray must be compromised.  Hard to believe otherwise.  He sees only “white supremisists”, no voter fraud, no issue with ballot harvesting and turns a blind eye to the actions of his department in their attempted coup.  Fire him.  Ppl want law and order.
1310642170039136256 2020-09-29 02:06:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @EvanAKilgore You teeet cannot be retweeted?
1310639503741087744 2020-09-29 01:56:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DC_Draino He filed like every other American and Company following the laws of the land using the tax code.
1310443646399864832 2020-09-28 12:58:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> @donnabrazile How much good work did the foundation do at.06 (cents) charitable purposes for each dollar donated.
1310438429583269888 2020-09-28 12:37:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> His soms wealth!
1310438158681755657 2020-09-28 12:36:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> I vote to fire Chris Wray immediately.
1310427637186093057 2020-09-28 11:54:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 Same as GE and Amazon
1310385201642520576 2020-09-28 09:05:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> @ewarren Hey Pocahontas, Sounds like projection on the part of the Dems.  You lied saying you were Native way back when in order to take advantage of system and obviously still are.  Filling SC is legal!
1310371339165814784 2020-09-28 08:10:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> And on the Trump side:  Durham confirms he will take no action until after the election...
1310248613776244737 2020-09-28 00:03:07 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Do you even listen to his incoherent conversation.  How could he deal in the world stage he can’t even navigate a campaign.  He recently said he became a Senator 180 years ago.  Endorsing Biden makes a person question you as well!
1310235592383324160 2020-09-27 23:11:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> Does he realize he endorsed a guy that said he joined the Senate 180 years ago?  Not much stock in his choice.  Dems think celebs sway people?
1309962010247876608 2020-09-27 05:04:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> @atensnut They send the mob after him
1309957434341953536 2020-09-27 04:46:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> In Africa?!  It wasn’t in the US.
1309881854296600577 2020-09-26 23:45:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Hey Biden had to drop out of the 1988 Presidential race  for plagerism and lying.  And he told some whoppers!  He still has told whoppers.  I guess once you do it, you think you can always do it?
1309868673209741313 2020-09-26 22:53:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes Lanny, America has seen the results of your paid protestors.   The burning, looting and violence against ppl. In your blue states we have seen small shop owners decimated by fires and vandalism’s.  Is that your goal?  Keep those bustards there to keep up your good work.
1309676827095396352 2020-09-26 10:11:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> Hunter Biden anyone looking?!
1309601594833399808 2020-09-26 05:12:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> Especially if you are the John Legend that in the flight logs going to Epstein island.  Tick tick tick.  Ya think that is why he wants Biden, hoping it all goes away for him and his wife?
1309469411909095426 2020-09-25 20:26:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenSchumer Yes, the Dems threaten, bully and intimidate to try to grab power.  You and your lackeys even threaten violence if your opponent wins the election with words like “ we’ll burn that shit down”.  More than ever we need a full Supreme Court.  It is legal and right to fill it now.
1308965108639510536 2020-09-24 11:02:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> @iammix24 I am crying.
1308964738013954048 2020-09-24 11:01:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden Ridiculous tweet Joe.
1308959272886124544 2020-09-24 10:39:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DaddyDrewMAGA My prayers are with your son and your entire family.
1308888609022509058 2020-09-24 05:58:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> What did they hear?  Maybe, I should have retired when Obama was President!  You know those things a person wishes they did!  But there is no successor rights.
1308887841800441864 2020-09-24 05:55:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> He needs to be removed
1308886261441204225 2020-09-24 05:49:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> Anyone trust NPR yet?
1308635473867284485 2020-09-23 13:13:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SpeakerPelosi I know. China and WHO really let this virus out to the world.  And so many people made bad decisions like putting covid cases in Nursing homes.  So many medical people denying covid consequences and politician saying take the subway, go to Chinatown or other events.  No one knew.
1308634109367840770 2020-09-23 13:07:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> @PeteButtigieg Require voter id before railing about popular vote numbers.  Dead people still voting.
1308586031994736640 2020-09-23 09:56:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> @marcorubio Sen. Rubio, Thank for saying the way it is going in the Senate.  People care and are freaked out about voter fraud and election chaos.  We want fair legal elections without dead people votes, ballot harvesting (buying votes),holding the voting open past Nov 3, and multiple votes.
1308575055320723462 2020-09-23 09:12:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> Joe Biden can barely stand up for himself.  The other day he couldn’t even say the pledge of allegiance.  Said 200 million would die of covid before the end of his speech.  The fact that you overlook all his incoherent communications says a lot about you.
1308507117997957120 2020-09-23 04:43:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ask him how that conference with Clinton and Abrams’ went?  Then ask when they will prescribe HCQ.  Then ask how the Gates vaccine is and if he gets kickbacks.  Then take D3 if you are not already and boost your immune system.  Fauci will save no one but ruin everyone financially
1308505499839520768 2020-09-23 04:36:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pacasandrs Still can’t retweet any of your posts—-not an option still.
1308452259500421120 2020-09-23 01:05:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> Lies, lies and more lies.
1308451677809205248 2020-09-23 01:02:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> I agree.  Trump 2020!
1308419134758236162 2020-09-22 22:53:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you.  We know this will be vicious.
1308416971118174212 2020-09-22 22:44:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @nflnetwork Don’t care anymore...
1308405456281448459 2020-09-22 21:59:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Great idea and thanks!!!
1308277241436975104 2020-09-22 13:29:35 +0800 <lfoster0001> Is that like the time you accused Biden of assault and when called on it said it was what you do in a debate.  Then became his running mate.    I really don’t believe the dying wish thing.  It is just what the Dems do.  I voted for Trump to nominate SC justices.  And he will.
1308274999384395777 2020-09-22 13:20:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Savingworld88 @KevinKtk789 I don’t think what happened to Kavanaugh was a hearing.  It was more like a lynching.
1308272040873545729 2020-09-22 13:08:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> @senatemajldr And stay safe and strong!
1308267932351229952 2020-09-22 12:52:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you.
1308246946235129856 2020-09-22 11:29:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> Wow that the first truthful reporting you’ve done in a long time.  That is the lefts own words.
1308239977055023106 2020-09-22 11:01:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Dear Mayor Jenny,  your summer of love resultedvin death and destruction in the city you were elected to protect.  The dad of the teenager said you never even bothered to call him. We, the citizens, want law and order not defunding police and allowing anarchy.  I support the Pres
1308230776954130432 2020-09-22 10:24:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> Or is it “after dying” Dem wishes?!
1308228157233795072 2020-09-22 10:14:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JHTX77 @TexasKenJSmith And as far as Joe,,,  If it ain’t ‘real’ it probably the ‘thing’.  You know the thing😀
1308226684697497603 2020-09-22 10:08:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> Are you crazy?  Trump hasn’t forgotten us little guys.  He works tirelessly.  and has been great for the world.  He recently was nominated by two country leaders for a Nobel Peace prize.
1308217141464674304 2020-09-22 09:30:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> I don’t believe the death wish baloney.  Under any case it is irrelevant.  The Dems are just trying to drum up chaos.  There are people like me that wants a full Supreme Court.  It is legal.  It is legit for the Pres to proceed.
1308212830810730496 2020-09-22 09:13:38 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you!
1308209784756162560 2020-09-22 09:01:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @michaelbeatty3 She probably also said she wanted Nusome to give you a million dollars too.  Right?!
1308208947539501056 2020-09-22 08:58:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Dancing around the house so happy you are not on the ballot!  And talking to friends about the kindness they will be showing by not voting for Biden as he is so frequently incoherent.
1308178152909189121 2020-09-22 06:55:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> Don’t believe it and anyhow whatever as there is no successor clause for her.  Fill the seat now.
1307761838168272896 2020-09-21 03:21:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> And if not then the Dems will ...  oh well, the list is true same!  Bunch of bullies.
1307760647476707335 2020-09-21 03:16:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @michaelbeatty3 @KevinKtk789 Newsome could have created hundreds of thousands of jobs cleaning up the forests!  Not necessary now.
1307757761371934720 2020-09-21 03:05:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Of course he does...  since Trump is the President he will do his job while Biden just spews politics.
1307756751018622976 2020-09-21 03:01:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> Hey Mayo,  You are sure spreading it on thick!    I support Trump all the way and can’t think of voting for incoherent old codger and a laughing hyena.  But hey this is America-we get to chose.  Lets KAG not devolve into socialism like Venezuela😏
1307747972482957312 2020-09-21 02:26:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> @liquidlaugh The money should go to the cops if reward is unclaimed.
1307747573969481728 2020-09-21 02:24:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> People are worried about population control czars vaccinations!
1307705699909001223 2020-09-20 23:38:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> @pacasandrs Not sure why there is no retweet option?  Great tweet!
1307549582713257984 2020-09-20 13:18:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump Yes and they also say if Trump is elected again they will riot and revolt.  So I guess we will be in for it one way or another when Trump wins!
1307533212474773504 2020-09-20 12:13:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Thomas1774Paine It is long past time.
1307532412637724672 2020-09-20 12:09:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Ridiculous.  RBG had no successor rights.  The President, via the constitution, has both the right and the duty to select and fill the position.  The American people voted for him for that reason.  Cry if you want but it’s totally legit.
1307487025486942209 2020-09-20 09:09:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @iamjumpingin Great tweet.
1307486667989610496 2020-09-20 09:08:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> That is why he wants indemnification and then vac the world.  Population control zealot with a vaccine and the ability to mark those that receive it.  Good for him, bad for us.
1307485438462976000 2020-09-20 09:03:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> He should be arrested.
1307484984937078785 2020-09-20 09:01:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> We the people must win re-election of President Trump.  Trump loves America.
1307451865336954880 2020-09-20 06:49:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenatorCollins I wish I could vote you out of office.
1307425443713224705 2020-09-20 05:04:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> You should have talked to her about the damage she has done to America.  You know some people did something like reportedly marrying her brother to commit fraud.  People want to know.
1307421812603510784 2020-09-20 04:50:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes.  He is doing his job!
1307420878368436224 2020-09-20 04:46:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Bull dump.
1307414716436721664 2020-09-20 04:22:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Arrest everyone calling for his death.
1307405229470527489 2020-09-20 03:44:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes
1307395239418580992 2020-09-20 03:04:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MattyThrice And ask questions on getting family gains in quid pro quo’s.
1307354412566720512 2020-09-20 00:22:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @brithume @elagrew Was it in writing?  Oh sorry , that dictate is not in the Supreme Court justices job description.  Nor is naming your successor.    Fill the vacancy and protect Mitch now.
1307348975779864582 2020-09-20 00:00:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> It is both legal and desirable to have a full Supreme Court.
1307344709468135426 2020-09-19 23:44:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> @OratorBlog @PeteKent01 Wray has devolved into an enemy of the people.  His credibility, what little he had, is gone.  Lying about the riots is a firable offense in my book.  @realDonaldTrump
1307165558845005826 2020-09-19 11:52:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes
1307135667105943558 2020-09-19 09:53:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Matthew_4_Trump Yes, let the Dems bawl.  They thought they were fine hiding testimony and trying to impeach the President.  Be tough back Senators.
1307106152027770880 2020-09-19 07:56:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> You are right, what difference now?  You haves 47 year career that you are running on.  What accomplishment though?
1307104734038417409 2020-09-19 07:50:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> But says he can do it now.
1307097244466917378 2020-09-19 07:20:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> You are the Nazis
1307093870346481665 2020-09-19 07:07:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you Tulsi!
1307090760446205952 2020-09-19 06:54:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> Bet me!
1307089308298477568 2020-09-19 06:49:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> You are totally correct and the fact that you have allowed rioters to use commercial lasers is truly dispicable...and fire too.
1307083378999558149 2020-09-19 06:25:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AmyMek @Jackk_Burton @RealJamesWoods I know I hardly see your tweets anymore.  L really like your posts, wit and humor Amy!
1307067679287791617 2020-09-19 05:23:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Mostly Biden is incoherent and stumbles through his thoughts.  The CNN questions were from Dems and not to challenge or to find his policy.  I can’t imagine him talking to world leaders—well except “if you don’t fire the prosecutor, you won’t get a billion $” Well sob-got fired.
1307062761667596293 2020-09-19 05:03:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @WayneDupreeShow @kimKBaltimore The View is a bunch of nasty, rude talking goofs.  They got crushed by Kim and nearly shite themselves trying to talk over her.  Pretty sad but funny.
1307033246199427072 2020-09-19 03:06:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RedWingGrips Do it now!@realDonaldTrump
1306980681797349376 2020-09-18 23:37:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Anyone agree?
1306978942083952640 2020-09-18 23:30:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Agree and where was Joe for the last 47 years?  I guess in the past he never really meant it.  So we should believe him now?
1306977171324297222 2020-09-18 23:23:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> I watch Joe Biden literally talking gibberish and making no sense.   I have no idea how anyone could see him representing us on the world stage and talking to world leaders.  He has attacked voters asking questions.  Does an interpreter need to practice signing “come on man”?
1306812645631168513 2020-09-18 12:29:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 Virtue signaling at its finest.

1306794383962824705 2020-09-18 11:17:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Wray is a danger to democracy.
1306774802481381379 2020-09-18 09:59:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> So sorry.  Heartbreaking.
1306772812221177856 2020-09-18 09:51:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> No it is an election of America versus China and Ukraine Biden dealings!
1306769155077451776 2020-09-18 09:36:59 +0800 <lfoster0001> Joe did you hear that the Mayor and coherts deceived the residents of Nashville.  Almost no Covid cases and kept the econmy shut down.  That was your side.  Hawking fear then and now.  Trump is amazingly successful! You accomplished ? in 47 years?
1306761958629220354 2020-09-18 09:08:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> Will you insist Fauci tell you if he (Fauci) has a financial interest in the vaccine or Bill Gates?
1306756025811267584 2020-09-18 08:44:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Stop it and stop her.
1306742462006788096 2020-09-18 07:50:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> @reubing I never watch Martha!
1306424094263443457 2020-09-17 10:45:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> Great tweet!!!
1306423310318665728 2020-09-17 10:42:44 +0800 <lfoster0001> How?
1306375261319905280 2020-09-17 07:31:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @rubycramer @AlbertSamaha Are you kidding?  They are educated, adults and surely know the law (as lawyers)and the consequences.  They are truly not sympathetic victims.  They obviously had opportunities that are not available for many.  And what did they do with their lives? Firebombed a police vehicle!
1306372460334383104 2020-09-17 07:20:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @HillaryClinton Really not sure what you are supporting?  Censorship?  They should be reined in and not allowed to punish conservatives by shadow banning and silencing.
1306294379821240322 2020-09-17 02:10:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NPRextra @ApplePodcasts @NPRItsBeenAMin NPR—-I lost confidence in your news outlet a really long time ago.  I found your reporting to be biased.  I truly doubt you’ve changed.
1306292047595229185 2020-09-17 02:01:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Shnrch33 @thetoyman1 Don’t give in!
1306074208867217408 2020-09-16 11:35:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Perfect comment.
1306070556890943489 2020-09-16 11:21:01 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DianeLong22 @alpipkin @gatewaypundit Ask Brees, at least four apologies, one wife apology, don’t forget the kids and the dog apology!  And it doesn’t work anyhow and you look weak kneed and blathering!
1306059061532659712 2020-09-16 10:35:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden Strange with all your goings on about not wanting fossil fuels and hawking climate change, that you are advertising your use of private fights?
1306041572413202433 2020-09-16 09:25:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @luchomp2002 He has seen Trump rallies and thinks those trees in the distance are people!
1306041048217591808 2020-09-16 09:23:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Well, the he!l you say, I guess the answer is yes!
1306024479164755968 2020-09-16 08:17:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> @js_stevens @donaldrusso994 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Me too.  I am in the #neverjuanwilliams group.
1306010179390111750 2020-09-16 07:21:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> Seem like the shell game done by con artists to me.
1306009366739509248 2020-09-16 07:17:52 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris I feel it at every change of season where I live —-climate change.  It takes good stewardship of forest and the wonderful American resources.  It is not okay to deflect blame on others.  And policies like everyone must buy electric vehicles and then forcing blackouts is damaging.
1306006974316908544 2020-09-16 07:08:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> @michaelbeatty3 @AMErikaNGIRLLL @realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell If Biden could do that, they would be having a parade!
1305983336406343680 2020-09-16 05:34:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RacySicilian I hope he doesn’t “Candy Crowley” the debate for Joe.  I don’t think Trump would sit silent like the guy that lost that election.  Sometimes called Mittens or calls himself Pierre Delecto, which I heard translates to delicious peter(wth)?  I digress, Wallace don’t be biased.
1305976947495714819 2020-09-16 05:09:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RaheemKassam Definitely an act of peace!
1305976662903848960 2020-09-16 05:07:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> People are pooping on the streets all over SF.  Just another show of elite privilege.  Telling people it okay to dump in others yards and in front of businesses but not in mine.  Not to say that dumping is good!
1305951182762856448 2020-09-16 03:26:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @ozor_cc @RealCandaceO What message!
1305950929213030400 2020-09-16 03:25:39 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Grandmamaison @RealCandaceO And many that I have seen are frankly repugnant.  A boob and crotch show just never sells well in an intellectual argument.
1305948772950659072 2020-09-16 03:17:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @KimonaQ @Sundncefn Yes and NFL wear a sexual assaulters logo to define social justice?  Yep, that’ll do it...
1305944666924134400 2020-09-16 03:00:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> @maryannmichael1 Definitely shows how the language doesn’t match the actions of the party!!!
1305943313552297984 2020-09-16 02:55:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden Are you also banning bricks, pee, cement, commercial grade fireworks, lasers, bats, bike locks, knives and all the other tools of choice your group is employing in terrorizing Dem run cities?
1305940544938336256 2020-09-16 02:44:23 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DavidARader @KarluskaP Most definitely a game of lawn darts.  They got the venue wrong!
1305697947938508800 2020-09-15 10:40:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 Now today he was shooting for crop circles or maybe corn pop as he ranted in the field on the environment.  Not one mention of people arrested for starting fires.  Biden supports violenceofburning, looting and violence.  His staff funds rioters bailouts.
1305695213294297089 2020-09-15 10:29:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GeorgePapa19 They are burning everything else and then threatening that if people don’t vote for Biden then they will get more violent.  People in this country have stood up to tyranny before.  Biden is supporting tyranny and destruction of America.
1305693664178446337 2020-09-15 10:23:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SenSchumer So people will be stoned and not follow or understand the terrible policies of the Democrats?
1305691557027225600 2020-09-15 10:15:00 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump And act how?  Just spewing green new deal?  Absurd.
1305690975725993984 2020-09-15 10:12:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> @HillaryClinton Says the woman that did not act in Benghazi where people died.  Then said to Congress “At this point, what difference does it make”.
1305665092852228096 2020-09-15 08:29:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> If that means weed smoking hairbleachers maybe!
1305652271846367234 2020-09-15 07:38:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Trump announced this program months ago😀😀😀
1305001301596536832 2020-09-13 12:32:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> Doesn’t it allow for sex with children as young as 8?  Or was that misreporting?
1305000444956045315 2020-09-13 12:28:46 +0800 <lfoster0001> And I wonder if filthy is a keyword here?  No comment from any of them about the controversy surrounding the film called Cuties?
1304999338284777472 2020-09-13 12:24:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> @LASDHQ So sorry LA.
1304970576952393728 2020-09-13 10:30:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @D_Alex_connect Well he is not smart now either.
1304930915114606592 2020-09-13 07:52:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> Send in that experienced swat team and let CNN know to film it.  Need the Stone treatment they love so much.
1304928666749554689 2020-09-13 07:43:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Wouldn’t that serve them sanctuary city nuts what they deserve!
1304914877396312064 2020-09-13 06:48:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Who paid for it?
1304865131587756032 2020-09-13 03:31:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @CRRJA5 @Concealcarrygrl Why is she not banned for not wearing a mask.  So many flights requiring toddler wear a mask or get off...
1304834529656414208 2020-09-13 01:29:29 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MrAndyNgo @Jakeatview Who else is sick of this destruction.  You think any of them would care for any person? No.
1304830673589428225 2020-09-13 01:14:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I know.  Trump works so hard for the people and is loved for his efforts.  You live in your basement!
1304827745927532545 2020-09-13 01:02:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> Great tweet!
1304827157009461249 2020-09-13 01:00:11 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NBA @MichelobULTRA Heard your numbers are down.  Will we find one day that you moved to China?  You know where they have justice like in the sweat camps and in the re-education camps?  Like the Chinese concentration camps holding Uyghurs.  Do the make your sports gear?
1304612209184579587 2020-09-12 10:46:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> And why some of those Generals hate his guts and why regular folks like me love him!
1304582735621545984 2020-09-12 08:48:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> So they think the run the world now?
1304577959450222592 2020-09-12 08:29:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> @bbusa617 @realDonaldTrump And I believe it.
1304568540633104384 2020-09-12 07:52:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @UrDaddysHome @AmericaVoice Same with me!
1304561218250711040 2020-09-12 07:23:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AnsolosAngels @pacasandrs Liberals are not tolerant
1304456963376312320 2020-09-12 00:29:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AskSweetThing Was thinking the same thing too!
1304288119210950657 2020-09-11 13:18:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Remember when Mueller deleted Strzok Page tweets?  How much can they get away with?
1304286357607428103 2020-09-11 13:11:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> @alexisjohnsonnm You must be a Dem as you are not identifying?
1304256105569189892 2020-09-11 11:11:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SonyaSkelton @TaggartRearden People can loot, protest and riot with no consequences.  A teenager tries to get in school learning and gets arrested.  Totally nuts.
1304238370709622785 2020-09-11 10:00:33 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Acosta Is this because you care or because you are trying to virtual signal everyone?
1304234975215067136 2020-09-11 09:47:04 +0800 <lfoster0001> @chaswcar1a @zairemf Thanks for noticing and being a fellow warrior for light and goodness!
1304129356587962368 2020-09-11 02:47:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> Dear NBA, you still think we care about you all after your disrespect and kneeling arses?
1303892506925387778 2020-09-10 11:06:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Odd, I remember the media mad about all the covid press briefings where President Trump had the experts speak and provide their best analysis.
1303884376791375872 2020-09-10 10:33:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yup.  Trump 2020!
1303875388506951680 2020-09-10 09:58:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> @JoeBiden That is why there is no way you can win —- plagiarism  remember?
1303791970196705280 2020-09-10 04:26:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @SharylAttkisson Biden has plagerized his whole life as proven by his own words.  Dropped out of the 1988 Presidential race and why?  Plagerism.  Falsely described his college credential by a long shot.  Actually told whoppers and said he misremembered.  All on video.
1303788969163780096 2020-09-10 04:14:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> I agree totally.  Don’t get a vaccine from a self declared population control enthusiast Bill Gates Pharma is what I always say.
1303724283785478147 2020-09-09 23:57:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> Where are your stats?
1303716032943595520 2020-09-09 23:24:58 +0800 <lfoster0001> I refuse to allow the Dems/liberals to intimidate, blackmail or bully me with the threat of violence.  Those who say it should be arrested or at least sued for inciting violence.  Be brave like Trump.  Vote Trump 2020!
1303714596897714176 2020-09-09 23:19:16 +0800 <lfoster0001> @catturd2 When Kamala cackles, It raises my hackles!
1303550637863387137 2020-09-09 12:27:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> @RonMilnerBoodle @liquidlaugh Our hearts break over this violence and unnecessary tragedy.
1303550255250636805 2020-09-09 12:26:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks for the laugh😀
1303545379611267075 2020-09-09 12:06:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> @AriFleischer @KB28216647 There must be consequences.
1303544616654761985 2020-09-09 12:03:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NickAdamsinUSA They can take a knee for the whole game.  No difference to me now.
1303532530172190723 2020-09-09 11:15:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you.  We are fed up with conservative censorship and Democrat fact liars.
1303489086435463168 2020-09-09 08:23:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @dps5400 @SDSUCHEPS @FriedsonAndrew @Drew_McNichols I agree.  Seems a bit implausible.
1303481080276643840 2020-09-09 07:51:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> If they (big tech) succeed in getting Biden elected they “ain’t seen nothin yet”.  I predict a depression and stocks will crash.  Biden hasn’t run anything in his life and isn’t up to the job.
1303473612813291520 2020-09-09 07:21:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> Trump may be wrong.  Historically, Joe has proven himself to be a plagerist and liar.  He is not dumb.  He had to drop out of the 1988 Presidential race due to plagerism. He had to admit to lying on his educ and record.  And yet was in gov for 47 years.  Thanks to ppl like you.
1303467752724676608 2020-09-09 06:58:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @DrShayPhD @mitchellvii Bill Mitchell is a great man and banned because he is a conservatives.  Hopefully karma messages twitter.  I notice a lot more Trump bashing today also.
1303386171632828416 2020-09-09 01:34:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> @iammix24 And you close your eyes to the rest of the looting, violence and actual murders?
1303374299688886279 2020-09-09 00:47:03 +0800 <lfoster0001> @GregAbbott_TX Are you dumping teachers in poor performing schools?
1303359297217126400 2020-09-08 23:47:26 +0800 <lfoster0001> It has to make a person angry to realize that your voice isn’t trusted due to your history, either perceived or real.
1303189168734887936 2020-09-08 12:31:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> @luismen1991 @TheRISEofROD @bennyjohnson Yes every time I watch YouTube the ad is for the Dem running for the Senate in my state.  Do you think it is just a coincidence?
1303170382145306625 2020-09-08 11:16:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> What say you now Brit?  The story was not accurate at all.
1303156077639294982 2020-09-08 10:19:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> And a complicit media.
1303151720537628673 2020-09-08 10:02:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> @patsphotos @GKeile In my little town, while walking in an affluent neighborhood, I noticed signs for Dem for gov and other offices.  Interesting not one of those yards had a Biden sign!
1303078641547452416 2020-09-08 05:12:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TheDamaniFelder Sometimes I think a tweet and thus the Tweeter is really good.  I look and I am already following!
1302450240365056001 2020-09-06 11:35:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> @therecount Whew, just looked and I am not following you.  I thought I was receiving your bias due to my own actions.  Nope!
1302447267358490624 2020-09-06 11:23:21 +0800 <lfoster0001> They must reveal who the sources are.  America deserves to know.  Both Goldberg and Griffin.  If this is a big fabrication then there should be consequences.  Frankly I don’t believe either of them.
1302445101403176961 2020-09-06 11:14:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Brick_Suit Is sweet corn Joes corn pop out to beat hi@ again?
1302316048352329728 2020-09-06 02:41:56 +0800 <lfoster0001> He is too afraid to lay out his tax policies!  Must be bad—- he said they might shoot him.
1302314974916743168 2020-09-06 02:37:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> @TimRunsHisMouth Biden on Twitter!
1302312309767847936 2020-09-06 02:27:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @charliekirk11 @TrumpStudents He has no game at all!
1302311793503604736 2020-09-06 02:25:02 +0800 <lfoster0001> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden And you just continue to lie like you can’t help yourself.
1302309916586078208 2020-09-06 02:17:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> @iammix24 Can they bring bricks, mortar, bats, pee, cement bottles, commercial grade fireworks and lasers or do they have to get them from the rioters?  Or just teddy bears, jello and rubber ducks?
1302065547832512513 2020-09-05 10:06:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> None that I know.  He is now supported more than ever by people I know.
1302064489664188417 2020-09-05 10:02:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> @charliekirk11 @TheAtlantic Remember the soldier, Sergent Tahmooressi, that took the wrong going to San Diego in 2014 and ended up at the border, arrested and jailed about a year?  In 2015 Trump gave him money to jumpstart his life per Greta Van Susteren.  Trump cared for soldiers before being President!
1302054205062934528 2020-09-05 09:21:28 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Matthew_4_Trump And South Dakota hosted the motorcycle rally in Sturgis much to the outcry of the Dems.  Notice no reporting as a follow-up.  None at all?  A liberal I know triumphantly reported that there was one death due to covid.  It’s like they want the virus??
1302027432904458240 2020-09-05 07:35:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> @MelissaAFrancis @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump That is my thoughts too.
1302026382570971136 2020-09-05 07:30:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> Totally agree
1302002171039412230 2020-09-05 05:54:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Did Biden call the woman Blake sexually assaulted?
1302001672080760839 2020-09-05 05:52:43 +0800 <lfoster0001> @realTanyaTay Cause they know he is not!
1301757420897624069 2020-09-04 13:42:09 +0800 <lfoster0001> But do you really believe it?proof is required.
1301660787908333568 2020-09-04 07:18:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> Excellent tweet!
1301659853723586560 2020-09-04 07:14:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> He has to, it’s the only lines  he remembers.
1301637907858337792 2020-09-04 05:47:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> @NPRextra @ApplePodcasts @NPRItsBeenAMin Have you noticed that people have lost confidence in NPR?  Are you planning on addressing the autopsy showing the deadly level of drugs George had taken?
1301623835314192385 2020-09-04 04:51:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> This tweet shows Joe gasping for air while talking wearing a mask (and misrepresenting).
1301618393393504256 2020-09-04 04:29:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> @BarnettforAZ @DeAnna4Congress @SpeakerPelosi Too funny!
1301617670215708672 2020-09-04 04:26:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> @BarnettforAZ @DeAnna4Congress @SpeakerPelosi Great tweet!
1301617092060356608 2020-09-04 04:24:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Spring_Harbinge @FlaMimi1 @mchooyah The point is we can’t but she thinks she can.
1301615660124889088 2020-09-04 04:18:50 +0800 <lfoster0001> On Pelosi.  This is not her finest hour, after her ice cream fiasco she continues to show who she really is.  For me but not for thee.  People want businesses open, we want to get our hair cut, dine out and wear no masks, not watch leaders do all those things we can’t do.  Hoax??
1301585352654598144 2020-09-04 02:18:25 +0800 <lfoster0001> So far you have shown yourself - languishing in the basement  - using gibberish instead of full sentences-you know the thing - espousing policies and then lying about your documented positions - never answering questions or attacking, berating questioners - don’t know whereabouts
1301577145576120321 2020-09-04 01:45:48 +0800 <lfoster0001> @paulsperry_ Well, I sympathize with the business owners and those that have suffered from the violence.  Mayor Wheeler has no excuse except fear Trump will win if the violence is stopped.
1301570559172440064 2020-09-04 01:19:37 +0800 <lfoster0001> Funny.  Hard to gen up enthusiasm in your political environment.  Maybe you are citing the wrong stats.  Oh never mind.
1301351733596098560 2020-09-03 10:50:05 +0800 <lfoster0001> NPR is biased and I hate that you get paid by taxpayers.
1301338019966775296 2020-09-03 09:55:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> No thanks.
1301323405141004288 2020-09-03 08:57:31 +0800 <lfoster0001> @Mr_PharaohMan @AngelWarrior321 @SpeakerPelosi Pelosi thinks that she will gain support by attacking a single mom, salon owner that hasn’t worked for six months due to CA covid shutdown. She says this single mom that has been getting death threats should apologize to her for showing the Pelosi truth.  Does it get any worse?
1301319548998578178 2020-09-03 08:42:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> So why is Pelosi getting her hair done instead of being in Congress finding solution to help those unemployed by Governors, like her nephew.  Oh that’s right, nothing is shutdown for her, just everyone else.
1301313907261231104 2020-09-03 08:19:47 +0800 <lfoster0001> She, Nancy, was responsible for setting up the appt.  She lies.
1301312510977429505 2020-09-03 08:14:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> She is disgusting
1301237858976497664 2020-09-03 03:17:36 +0800 <lfoster0001> Love you Leo😀
1301235771576205312 2020-09-03 03:09:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> All hell should break out.
1301212971272744960 2020-09-03 01:38:42 +0800 <lfoster0001> Glad to hear that he is.
1301204697399738368 2020-09-03 01:05:49 +0800 <lfoster0001> Yes, Trump is the true leader!
1301199003774713860 2020-09-03 00:43:12 +0800 <lfoster0001> When Trump wins, he should fire  Fauci immediately.
1301046639637848064 2020-09-02 14:37:45 +0800 <lfoster0001> The judge should be disbarred or disrobed or whatever happens to incompetent, biased, unscrupulous judges.
1301026894565879808 2020-09-02 13:19:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> I don’t think the science is in yet.
1300990747345264640 2020-09-02 10:55:40 +0800 <lfoster0001> He won’t be able to stand up for the middle either.
1300985943139082240 2020-09-02 10:36:34 +0800 <lfoster0001> Liars lie.
1300984079844700162 2020-09-02 10:29:10 +0800 <lfoster0001> I am angry.
1300980073869180929 2020-09-02 10:13:15 +0800 <lfoster0001> I will hand deliver my vote!
1300954695469473794 2020-09-02 08:32:24 +0800 <lfoster0001> I small for it also as long as we can watch him get back up!
1300953909075140608 2020-09-02 08:29:17 +0800 <lfoster0001> In the end they will all be losers.  People are woke and realize they are the problem not the solution.  People watched for entertainment.
1300952204325523456 2020-09-02 08:22:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> Baloney.  She knew she was the only one there and had to make special arrangements.
1300942989234024449 2020-09-02 07:45:53 +0800 <lfoster0001> Lies as usual.
1300926994243149824 2020-09-02 06:42:20 +0800 <lfoster0001> Chris you are the man that called for violent rioting.  I am waiting for Tucker today!
1300924875066888192 2020-09-02 06:33:54 +0800 <lfoster0001> She probably had ice cream from her fully loaded freezer when she went home.
1300912430118182912 2020-09-02 05:44:27 +0800 <lfoster0001> Isn’t that a great question!
1300878077585575938 2020-09-02 03:27:57 +0800 <lfoster0001> Relocate the failed DC mayor out of office as soon as possible.
1300875300884996096 2020-09-02 03:16:55 +0800 <lfoster0001> As your fried Biden said —-it’s the thing, you know the thing.  You know the China virus that attacked and decimated the world.
1300874529913282561 2020-09-02 03:13:51 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks to Joe, Kamala and the Dems.  These business owners and employees are brutalized.
1300870819040489473 2020-09-02 02:59:06 +0800 <lfoster0001> Agree.  Just never call me a Biden supporter.  Trump 2020!
1300685393528930304 2020-09-01 14:42:18 +0800 <lfoster0001> So you found him guilty without a trial.  Isn’t that a digital lynching?  No evidence just try to vigilante him and by a lawmaker no less.
1300682611929436167 2020-09-01 14:31:14 +0800 <lfoster0001> A man with only hatred in his heart would support this violence.  PS Trump will win again!
1300677597668372480 2020-09-01 14:11:19 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thanks Vernon.  That was a really powerful speech.  I am with you.
1300673871452860417 2020-09-01 13:56:30 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank you Andy for all the hard work you have continued to do on this subject.  Excellent reporting!
1300673041794347008 2020-09-01 13:53:13 +0800 <lfoster0001> Shouldn’t he get a trial?  Or does the media get to make the judgement which it is already doing?  Like with Sandmann where the reporting was so false that so far he won two lawsuits?
1300669384973668353 2020-09-01 13:38:41 +0800 <lfoster0001> And frankly my dear, we don’t give a darn!
1300667836210188289 2020-09-01 13:32:32 +0800 <lfoster0001> Have you heard him make any coherent statements?
1300667292951298048 2020-09-01 13:30:22 +0800 <lfoster0001> I can tell you are a nasty woman.  Don’t sway much!
1300609602761883648 2020-09-01 09:41:08 +0800 <lfoster0001> Thank China and all those Govs that refuse to open the economy.  And those cooking the covid # books that were just revised.  Only 10k died of covid alone.  The rest had 2.6 co-morbidity conditions.
