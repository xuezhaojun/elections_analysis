1339952781340389379 2020-12-18 23:16:52 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Sounds right! They continuously tweet and blame everyone else for delays on stimulus and then cut the people but receive their pork. @thebradfordfile
1339944808215928833 2020-12-18 22:45:11 +0800 <OstmanChristine> China owns $ $ McConnell! The bi$$est Loser! @RealMattCouch
1339943802560233472 2020-12-18 22:41:12 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @LivePDDave1 @MsTrumperAna What a dirty shame it is to take the job in Supreme court and not do the job you took an oath to do. America Over Fear,  Always and Forever.
1339942332192448512 2020-12-18 22:35:21 +0800 <OstmanChristine> It's very disappointing and disturbing. If you love the law so much, then follow it correctly or get out. Stop the fear mongering! This isn't about them its about America. @marklutchman

Such a huge Stain on America and the people. Thank you for honoring the Constitution as it should be and fighting for what's right.

1339756063629991937 2020-12-18 10:15:11 +0800 <OstmanChristine> How dare you accuse the President for the Pandemic. It's the China virus and your party knows all about it. @IlhanMN

1339627426947756035 2020-12-18 01:44:02 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Voter Fraud got you in and nothing other then that. You're unfit to be leading Americans with your continuous bullshit that comes out of that mouth. @IlhanMN

1339409998938578946 2020-12-17 11:20:03 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @VanityFair Best thing you should do is turn yourself in. You're crooked as days are long and never to be trusted. Putting America at security risk, you don't belong walking free.
1339406485894406147 2020-12-17 11:06:05 +0800 <OstmanChristine> What a very bad role model to teach your children such hatred. The fact that you boast about it, makes it even worse. What a little man you're! @JoshShapiroPA

1339397823817773062 2020-12-17 10:31:40 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @55true4u I struggled with numbers, it was all I could do to memorize the oldest names and age to youngest child names and age in my family of fifteen. Afraid of numbers ever since!

1339381436026155009 2020-12-17 09:26:33 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @55true4u Living in a Democratic swing state is the worst. We're a prisoner of our state. I'm just  glad I can let it go, unlike some.
1339380746419638276 2020-12-17 09:23:49 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @55true4u No playing ding dong ditch. Enlighten us!
1339379630235639809 2020-12-17 09:19:22 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @55true4u It's better to clear the conscience and live with a free mind. Fear cannot hold us back. It is not of God but satan himself.
1339242711501692933 2020-12-17 00:15:19 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @jsolomonReports The Democrats need to be held accountable for this treasonous act upon American citizens. To fraud an election is a total disgrace upon the American people. It just can't be any worse, but I'm afraid it is.

1338666277628473344 2020-12-15 10:04:46 +0800 <OstmanChristine> It will be official when your charged with the crimes. You licked your dinner plate too quick and clean.    @JoeBiden

1338660425781702666 2020-12-15 09:41:31 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You need to have some serious talks with Christ about your fake sorrow and concerns for the American people. Also about all your fake collusion, fake impeachment and multiple shaninigans. Hypocrite! @SpeakerPelosi
1338659154190356483 2020-12-15 09:36:28 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump I dont remember seeing any booms from his box, on the deep state corruption.
1338654670026276865 2020-12-15 09:18:38 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Voter Fraud is a Serious Crime! I'm sure you know the penalty thats payed if, found guilty of it. Don't play Tom foolery with the American people. We know! @RepAdamSchiff

1329861257155981314 2020-11-21 02:56:45 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I'm sure our President preplanned for this. I cant imagine bases aren't covered for a possible cover up. @chuckwoolery

1329833525646938112 2020-11-21 01:06:34 +0800 <OstmanChristine> They're crawling around today like a bunch of termites, trying to defend themselves from their participation in the Voter Fraud against the American people. Its actually hilarious to watch. Its show time!  https://t.co/yeVhuUxgMz
1329819470601351173 2020-11-21 00:10:43 +0800 <OstmanChristine> 😂 @EstergrenSue

1329642466555932672 2020-11-20 12:27:22 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Oh hell no, not me! Never @TheOfficerTatum
1329630510855942145 2020-11-20 11:39:51 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Indeed! I trust her! She wouldn't pull a case if she didn't have the guts in it. She would dump it. You could hear her anger and settlement in her voice today
1329623225521885184 2020-11-20 11:10:54 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @BlueSky_Report @DerlundVon I sensed it way back but he covered his tracks quickly. Tonight he was a damn glowing spotlight.
1329622679821934592 2020-11-20 11:08:44 +0800 <OstmanChristine> He even admitted pressing her. I'm glad she didn't respond, shes very intelligent.
1329621515609001984 2020-11-20 11:04:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RealMattCouch Nope
1329620034587684864 2020-11-20 10:58:14 +0800 <OstmanChristine> He pressed hard, listen to it again.  He was working on placing doubt in viewers mind. Quite obvious! He turned off many people by doing so
1329618548201824259 2020-11-20 10:52:19 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @An0nJon17 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @seanhannity Trust none of them now, you just cantone  the show, she's the wiser.
1329615882662907904 2020-11-20 10:41:44 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I dont think MN is together at all as your hashtag presumed. Far far left Not together. I feel for the innocent lost and their family tho @GovTimWalz
1329609948179943424 2020-11-20 10:18:09 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Which she has every right too. Listen to Tucker again closely, he knows better then that. He pressed it hard to sway the viewers, like she was hiding it deliberately. He knows darn well you don't throw it out for everyone to see.
1329608352452763649 2020-11-20 10:11:48 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You dont give your evidence of a case to media or public before you present your case. Especially one as large as this. Are you kidding me! Sydney doesn't owe them nothing!
1329607499289403395 2020-11-20 10:08:25 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Bunch of rude asses! @TeaBoots
1329604244773670913 2020-11-20 09:55:29 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @John_F_Kennnedy Why the hell would you physically show your evidence before you go to court. WTF is wrong with people, or are people that stupid. Besides they would take it all out of context anyway. Screw Tucker he is one of them.
1329603284919869440 2020-11-20 09:51:40 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Screw Tucker,  hes a flop!
1329602267163602950 2020-11-20 09:47:37 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RealSaavedra Nah! Fox is toxic!
1329573915828523009 2020-11-20 07:54:58 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I have not one News channel that speaks any truth on my television. Local news, same way. It sucks!
1329566744764157957 2020-11-20 07:26:28 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @IlhanMN She's just part of the Obama infiltrate!

1329555681901473794 2020-11-20 06:42:31 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Joe will be charged with treason! Give it up! You will not be the First  lady that you drool for. @DrBiden
1329555099077775361 2020-11-20 06:40:12 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @C_C_Krebs This isn't no damn conspiracy, its huge fraud upon the American people. Get a grip and wake the hell up people. Why in hell would you support this  by asking this dude questions. He got fired for a huge reason and now hes playing dumb.
1329553714890346498 2020-11-20 06:34:42 +0800 <OstmanChristine> He knows all about it I'm afraid! @tod1776 @C_C_Krebs
1329547634017755144 2020-11-20 06:10:32 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @C_C_Krebs Krebs! Let that sink in folks. Sound familiar? Lol
1329547133809291264 2020-11-20 06:08:33 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Letting your city burn while he kept the Natl guard on stand down is not protecting. Get a clue! @hedgeaway
1329539070700228612 2020-11-20 05:36:30 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @TheBettyTrump Just tell her you forgive her and wish her a Happy Thanksgiving. Then observe the response.
1329534678995513347 2020-11-20 05:19:03 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Revealing corruption must be the goal in America. In addition to the voting fraud, this also needs to be brought to life.
1329523005538635776 2020-11-20 04:32:40 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Now is the time! Agree! @jsolomonReports
1329521749894029316 2020-11-20 04:27:41 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I pray for all of them fighting for us. Lord Jesus we want what's good not evil in America. Please protect us while we fight against the evil. Show us your mercy and love, your will for America. Protect and guide us through the storm. In Jesus name,Amen @ScottBaio
1329519480922365959 2020-11-20 04:18:40 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @Beer_Parade You can hear it in all their voices.Its serious folks and they know it. It makes me just want to cry for America and what has happened.The past 4 years have been great but brutal from the left. It's very upsetting and emotional time.I love Rudy he works hard for us. @Beer_Parade
1329517278338179072 2020-11-20 04:09:55 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @MajorPatriot They can run but cant hide. It's a small world after all.  https://t.co/6ctgGFh3e4
1329511118201630722 2020-11-20 03:45:26 +0800 <OstmanChristine> They sure were called out in the live conference. It's to bad they don't have any shame. @Gods_Warrior91

1329496872302616577 2020-11-20 02:48:49 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Facebook was censoring so bad on the live conference. They repeatedly ultered the sound to none, scrambling the video. They were even on hot mic not knowing it, laughing at Rudy wiping his face. Words popping out of nowhere on the screen.
1329468044146597894 2020-11-20 00:54:16 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Because they cheated and they know it. Full transparency to the voters is only right and just. We trusted and they failed the people.  @Barnes_Law

1329260926034464770 2020-11-19 11:11:15 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I think the little bit of faith we had is now gone. The one time we have a voice then illegally gets taken from us. It's all just a big joke and embarrassment to America.They should have agreed to voter ID like our President suggested, but instead they steal. @RepJamesComer

1327584541092032513 2020-11-14 20:09:54 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @JackPosobiec She's a warrior and a great example of leadership. She has kept her city going through it all.
1327583704236089344 2020-11-14 20:06:35 +0800 <OstmanChristine> For the sake of America and the voice of the people, justice must prevail. There will never be peace on this land without truth. It's a disgrace this could even happen. @aaronjcarpenter
1327451549660975109 2020-11-14 11:21:26 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Yes I do! @ACTforAmerica
1327446453929775110 2020-11-14 11:01:12 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Enjoy it, because it won't be long before the kraken begins. @IlhanMN

1327439248417566722 2020-11-14 10:32:34 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Its definitely a victory to celebrate and its going to be the greatest when we take America back and watch the charges be distributed. Oh glory day! @GregMusselwhit3
1327435197768458240 2020-11-14 10:16:28 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The pain is coming Omar! The world will forever change to be the big beautiful America we miss so much. The fraud for profit off the American people will be stopped. Voter fraud was a very bad choice, to steal an election. The victory is when we watch the charges stick.@IlhanMN

1327410207400615936 2020-11-14 08:37:10 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @atBtru2U These are the people's votes and  not the secretary of state to play hide and seek with.  He's guilty of something Big, not to be transparent and the people of Georgia should be banging on his doors.
1327401908890464257 2020-11-14 08:04:11 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Trump's Pennsylvania complaint is brilliant  https://t.co/IrwHMj0zwJ

1327395272146767880 2020-11-14 07:37:49 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The only way to bring the people together is to expose the darkness. Seeing is believing! We're strong and deserve truth. It's the only way!

1326954032699760642 2020-11-13 02:24:29 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The far left Democrats heisted the election from the American people. We payed their wages and they ripped us off. They must be prosecuted!

1326574432408711170 2020-11-12 01:16:05 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Your too late! Haha! Our President already did this when he took office and will continue to acknowledge our Veterans this New Year as sitting President. Our Veterans know we will never ever put them last, like they were in the past. @KamalaHarris

1326557810306519040 2020-11-12 00:10:02 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The only one that gave full recognition to Our Veterans was Our President when he took office. He's already made them a Priority when you put them last. Your not fooling anyone you Fraud! @IlhanMN
1326535398332444672 2020-11-11 22:40:59 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Happy Veterans day! We appreciate you and love you. Have a blessed day!  https://t.co/PkNzWmIiiU

1326351987248680963 2020-11-11 10:32:10 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Who could even be ok claiming president elect when their clearly not. These people have no soul whatsoever and they're not honorable to serve Our Beautiful Country. When we said drain the swamp we meant it! There is no turning back but moving forward to a brighter future.

I will not celebrate a false fabricated victory announced by Fake news media, but will wait patiently for the justice of a free, fair and just  election to be determined by the courts. #MyVoteMatters
1325190767363518465 2020-11-08 05:37:54 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're Not American if you dont stand up and fight against The Voter Fraud that just took place before Our Eyes. Media Does Not Declare Victory of a president, but The People's Real Votes do.

1325161533819691008 2020-11-08 03:41:44 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The media are not your friend! They want you to feel sadness, helpless, angry, hopeless as they announce and parade sleepy Joe. This is not a Victory by  truth! This is a victory of a Huge Election Fraud! Dont fall victim!  This is Fake Media trying to get you to believe it.
1325159433307971590 2020-11-08 03:33:23 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Don't let your emotions take over to sadness. These people are demons and we have to fight them up to our victory. Do not fall victim to their game. Cheer up and continue to fight with Our President. He needs us more then ever. They want you to feel hopeless, we're Not.
1325152509799837696 2020-11-08 03:05:53 +0800 <OstmanChristine> We will not stand down or except Mr Sleepy Joe Biden to be the 46th President. As God is our witness to the light and truth for America we will fight to the bitter end to proclaim victory for Our President who had Already Won.  Voter Fraud Happened and it needs to come to light.
1325146950832844805 2020-11-08 02:43:47 +0800 <OstmanChristine> We Demand A Recount In MN! Joe Biden is not our President @GovTimWalz
1325139666463383553 2020-11-08 02:14:51 +0800 <OstmanChristine> We're witnessing a fake fraudulent criminal elected President. Lord Jesus Christ shine the lights on all the criminal activity that went on during this election and throughout history for the people. Thy will be done!

1324916124723654657 2020-11-07 11:26:34 +0800 <OstmanChristine> This is what happens to a Country when there isnt any repercussions for criminal activity in Government for centuries. It crumbles! The laws pertain to all not some.

1324728247322640386 2020-11-06 23:00:01 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Stealing the election and robbing the people to be able to vote safely and accurately is nothing to be proud of. Of course what would you know about honesty when you've been horrendously crooked all your life. @HillaryClinton

1324465633493458944 2020-11-06 05:36:29 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Voter fraud is a huge crime, as well as stealing campaign funds and harvesting ballots. Have you no conscious? Apparently not because you married your brother to. @IlhanMN

1324156068293939201 2020-11-05 09:06:22 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @MNSteveSimon Are some of the outstanding absentee ballots part of the ballot harvesting that was going on by Ilhan Omar and being investigated by law enforcement? We haven't had any updates on that situation.  https://t.co/MvqG1BCIh5

1322167387513364480 2020-10-30 21:24:04 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I would call the news aiding and abetting the criminal activity by not being truthful and informing the American people. We have a right to know! @DonaldJTrumpJr

1321931982541148160 2020-10-30 05:48:39 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @GovTimWalz You set the stage but it looks pretty empty. Stop the fear mongering the citizens. We're over it!
1321911767958695936 2020-10-30 04:28:20 +0800 <OstmanChristine> What a bunch of sick f__ks! They need to be escorted out of this Country. @JackPosobiec

1321820110659768320 2020-10-29 22:24:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @SpeakerPelosi @stevenmnuchin1 Sorry Nancy but there is no wiggle room for your abuse of power. You've had months to agree on a stimulus plan for the American people and you failed every attempt. Turning the table and making it look like its everybody else's fault is asinine. You're to blame and nobody else.
1321628074589474816 2020-10-29 09:41:02 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @Ek7_PRN I'm thinking no! It's too far gone!
1321627379048062976 2020-10-29 09:38:16 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're one evil person! You will face your demons eventually for all you didn't do for America and the people.  @SpeakerPelosi
1321622464682729472 2020-10-29 09:18:44 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @Acosta The media is a lying corrupt business. Eventually it all will catch up with you and you will face your demons.
1321615305702072320 2020-10-29 08:50:17 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I can believe that, but what they do with that is another matter. I know God must be extremely angry and sad to see such a mess. I'm holding all my faith in him and what he sees fit for America. It's hard to stay hopeful when there is no justice. @JohnTrumpFanKJV
1321612330887749633 2020-10-29 08:38:28 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I do too, but it will all evaporate just like everything else. It isn't about us, it's all about them. We're just their wallet and the rich will get richer. Sad but truth! God is the only one who can wipe it clean. Our Country is too far gone. @JohnTrumpFanKJV
1321610297694707720 2020-10-29 08:30:23 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @TuckerCarlson Go figure! Anything that comes to light always disappears. Same game, different day. It's the government's way of holding no politician accountable. It will never change, never!
1321609643748184064 2020-10-29 08:27:48 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @elenochle Yes I can relate
1321604693542526976 2020-10-29 08:08:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @55true4u The only one who can save our Country is God himself. Every part of Government has failed the American people in some way. It was never about us, but it was all about them. We're used and abused mentally and physically by all their corruption. What a sad world! Lost hope I guess
1321580753403207681 2020-10-29 06:33:00 +0800 <OstmanChristine> No you're incorrect! You're trying to change America and rob us of our freedoms. @IlhanMN

1318234627228733443 2020-10-20 00:56:41 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Fauci has flip flopped like a seal washed up on a beach shore. I don't blame the President at all for his comment. Fauci never seems to get it right the first time.

1318207911387140096 2020-10-19 23:10:31 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The people have a right to know of the full criminal activity he has partaken in. Blow the trumpet of truth, full transparency is dire! @RealMattCouch

1317982526909153285 2020-10-19 08:14:56 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Now really tell us the family man you never were! Better yet let Hunter explain! @JoeBiden
1317980053402247173 2020-10-19 08:05:06 +0800 <OstmanChristine> No thanks! You cannot be trusted with handling funds. Your ideas like BLM should have woke Americans up. What happened in Ukraine is beyond criminal and we will not ignore it. @JoeBiden
1317893813021626368 2020-10-19 02:22:24 +0800 <OstmanChristine> One big family of corruption! Disgusting! @RealJamesWoods

1317887060477415429 2020-10-19 01:55:35 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Joe Biden never tells the people what they want to hear about what his plans are. He talks only about the Covid19. Joe Biden we want to know about the corrupt Biden family!
1317885939704827907 2020-10-19 01:51:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Right! Who's dirty hands is it resting in? We would also like to inquire about the 3 million campaign funds given to her husband. How about an audit? @RonWils51572583
1317885130309062657 2020-10-19 01:47:54 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Of course there is! Who is going to do the right thing for the sake of justice. @SandyGreenman

1317852186353799168 2020-10-18 23:37:00 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @JoeBiden Your a thief! We want answers! You have avoided it since the New York Post came out. What else have you done?

1317609648351039493 2020-10-18 07:33:14 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Totally agree with that. We need action and that's the problem with America. They talk and never follow through. Nobody is above the law as they say, so now we must hold them all to those words. @RonWils51572583
1317608345377845248 2020-10-18 07:28:04 +0800 <OstmanChristine> It's quite clear what you have done to your citizens with your abuse of power. Soon they will not be your victims. Set MI free from Gretchen! Vote Red MI and look forward to your freedom. @GovWhitmer

1314656385095929861 2020-10-10 03:58:01 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @elenochle Why did it have to come to this, before he spoke up? What changed?

The price they will pay is on his clock because nobody civil dares to touch it out of fear for Themselves. If Trump wins we will start all over again with the liberal nightmares. So sick of all it, I'm trusting in Gods plan only.

1313883979351719937 2020-10-08 00:48:46 +0800 <OstmanChristine> This should be all over The News!!!!!!! Media Silent! President Trump receives Third Nobel "Peace" Prize. @OANN

1313868920709877761 2020-10-07 23:48:55 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Reports but no arrests! Just more shit in the pot! @seanhannity
1313863987524755464 2020-10-07 23:29:19 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @realDonaldTrump Its about time they pay the price!

1313845063630413824 2020-10-07 22:14:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're a fraud and a mess! You have no business in our Government. You're not for the people and anybody who would vote for your mess have truly lost their minds. The political agenda you push is not for America at all but for control. Vote her out! @IlhanMN
1313841928115572736 2020-10-07 22:01:40 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Because he's a fraud just like the others! @RealOmarNavarro

1313833962352119808 2020-10-07 21:30:01 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Be assured the Democratic party will not act responsibly and promptly. They've been doing it for four years with Nothing accomplished. Make no mistake, vote NO to Joe! @JoeBiden
1313830206591959041 2020-10-07 21:15:05 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I think the American people have lost hope when justice isn't served to those who have committed serious crime in Gov. As taxpayers we want prosecution brought to those who committed the crimes and not paying for witch hunts that never occured. There is no peace without justice!
1313817559678947328 2020-10-07 20:24:50 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @CopJrCliff Welcome Sir!
1313810285308850178 2020-10-07 19:55:56 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're spot on and she has no business in Congress dividing this Country as her plan. We deserve better then this and Lacy Johnson will turn it around in the best interest for our Country and all citizens. @LacyJohnsonMN
1313661412393267202 2020-10-07 10:04:22 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @EvanAKilgore I could feel it and see it when he returned home and stood on the decking. He has taken enough bullishit and it's time to unload.
1313659517863964672 2020-10-07 09:56:50 +0800 <OstmanChristine> All must pay the price! This is just unforgivable! @charliekirk11

1313623335272673280 2020-10-07 07:33:03 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're not out of the dark Omar! In fact the heat is on!
1313618908176363520 2020-10-07 07:15:28 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @JamesOKeefeIII Shame on Fox9! I'm sure you will get to the bottom of this, as in the truth.

1313606425134891009 2020-10-07 06:25:52 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @LoveHerMo Your life is what you make of it and should have no correlation from your past. It is what you choose it to be! If you hate it, then I'm thinking it's time for change. We're responsible for who and what we become in life. High five for a new beginning and good luck.  @LoveHerMo
1313600549871329281 2020-10-07 06:02:31 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RepJohnKatko Maybe you disagree but the truth is, its about the welfare of the taxpayers hurting during the pandemic and not the other bs you ask for. We will not forget who put us last!
1313594385188163584 2020-10-07 05:38:01 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RepAdamSchiff It's all your fault and we know it!
1313590324418301954 2020-10-07 05:21:53 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @SpeakerPelosi You're nothing but a damn Liar! The American people have no respect for you!
1313579096824320003 2020-10-07 04:37:16 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Cant blame him! Nancy Pelosi has did nothing from day one but obstruct. She is a disgrace that we dont appreciate. She's never wanted to help the American people from the get go. Hopefully we will get a house speaker that actually works for The People and not filling her wallet.
1313577952110665735 2020-10-07 04:32:43 +0800 <OstmanChristine> All precautions were taken seriously and in a timely fashion, as we knew it was. Thank you First Lady! @FLOTUS

1313562712908206086 2020-10-07 03:32:10 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @JackPosobiec Another explosive good news story. I just love an action filled day. Saving the children! Amen
1313560364949307392 2020-10-07 03:22:50 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi is corrupt! It's  pathetic and a embarrassment to our Nation.
1313559508283805696 2020-10-07 03:19:26 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RyanAFournier There is no Peace in this world if Justice is not served! That's The Truth!
1313533005726732288 2020-10-07 01:34:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @Dude4Liberty Definitely true but there is also an abundance of lazy adults as well. If it's not free they will not go there.
1313475469145247746 2020-10-06 21:45:29 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @RealJamesWoods So it is true! Confirmed! @RealJamesWoods  https://t.co/cWubg2p4KI
1313474743308292104 2020-10-06 21:42:36 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Let's just say it was something such as cleaning that was long past due. Dept of health probably riding their asses and they have to blame it on another. Very typical Democratic way! Nothing to see here!
1313472975354695682 2020-10-06 21:35:35 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Indeed! He's quite the catch! @JennaEllisEsq
1313472536190111750 2020-10-06 21:33:50 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Boom! Yet Another! Keep it coming! There is no peace in life without justice served. @TheJusticeDept

1313447715003604999 2020-10-06 19:55:12 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Which just gained you many great faithful Patriots who love America and will fight to the core for their freedom. Welcome Sir! @reelpat215
1313445594946506759 2020-10-06 19:46:47 +0800 <OstmanChristine> You're incapable of building a Country and that is not your intention. Our President has built our Country up from all the destruction the Democratic party  had done and Our President will do it again. Actions rule over Joe's idea. Antifa &amp; BLM were your idea! Enough said!
1313306251032395778 2020-10-06 10:33:04 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @realJCTrudeau @GregAbbott_TX @DanPatrick I celebrate every day arrests are made and children are rescued from these evil perpetrators.

1313292314949947394 2020-10-06 09:37:42 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @KamalaHarris Never trust Joe's plan because he won't be able to find the manual it came with.
1313291810127728640 2020-10-06 09:35:41 +0800 <OstmanChristine> That's everything that's already being done already. How stupid! @KamalaHarris

1313280628411031552 2020-10-06 08:51:16 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @SpeakerPelosi More ranting! Is there anything civil that comes out of that mouth? Get to work!
1313280102839484416 2020-10-06 08:49:10 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Woe! Words of a devil woman and she needs much prayer @haveaconcern

1313214583759400962 2020-10-06 04:28:49 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @IlhanMN Nobody likes the dishonesty of ballot harvesting to cheat in an election, nor do they like the loss of elderly you failed to protect in the nursing homes. We don't live in fear in America! Ever!

1312803096276480000 2020-10-05 01:13:43 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I cant believe that this is true or not but I was at the Duluth, MN rally and I didn't feel the normal upbeat of our President like at previous rally's,  but it was cold out too. His voice was raspy. These were some of his quotes he did say at the rally. So could be true!  https://t.co/4YPTqazAFR

1311131957238136832 2020-09-30 10:33:12 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @Americanlll Calling them all out tonight! Lots of appetizers!
1311131228410703872 2020-09-30 10:30:19 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Duel debate for our President this evening between Wallace and Biden. The moderator that never was Chris Wallace.
1311130645255655424 2020-09-30 10:28:00 +0800 <OstmanChristine> The Biden plan not green new deal Joe says! What the hell!  https://t.co/jSkHIfDKiT
1311128160717676549 2020-09-30 10:18:07 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Who in hell could trust Joe Biden to run America. This man has no business even running for President. Hunter needs to be investigated for 3.5 million from Moscow. The people have a right to know. Joe's losing it!
1311126852937932801 2020-09-30 10:12:55 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Yes Biden is not too duper smart! I would be embarrassed too! He cant debate and he would be dangerous to run a Country.
1311123447863562240 2020-09-30 09:59:24 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Joe's face becomes very pale when the President has him backed in the corner on law &amp; order.
1311122733355413505 2020-09-30 09:56:33 +0800 <OstmanChristine> He really sucks! I hope people tell him so! @RichardGrenell
1311121721361969157 2020-09-30 09:52:32 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Where's Hunter? Where's his 3.5 million Joe? Joe denies, here's the deal! Joe!
1311120852348555269 2020-09-30 09:49:05 +0800 <OstmanChristine> As a small business owner, President Trump has done more for small business and bringing jobs back. Joe is talking out his ass!
1311119390679728131 2020-09-30 09:43:16 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Chris Wallace not even giving the President his time! What the hell!
1311117507244240896 2020-09-30 09:35:47 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Yeah he isn't the man for the job. Piss poor moderation! @RyanAFournier
1311113759893708800 2020-09-30 09:20:54 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Yeah Joe is still out to lunch! Nothing new! @llhanMN
1311113501746892800 2020-09-30 09:19:52 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Obama care is shit and I'm sure many will agree. It's never ran smoothly from day one.
1311112545802084358 2020-09-30 09:16:04 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Joe is all over the place! Fleeting mind and thoughts, no focus. He's flustering easily! Wallace is such an ass hat!
1311105412641546241 2020-09-30 08:47:44 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Amen! Lord hear our prayers @JohnTrumpFanKJV

1311075496772411394 2020-09-30 06:48:51 +0800 <OstmanChristine> @NickAdamsinUSA He shouldn't be allowed to!
1311074465468444672 2020-09-30 06:44:45 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Sounds like they're trying everything not to debate. @markkayeshow

1311045799875354630 2020-09-30 04:50:51 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Why didn't they just get him a leg bag? How ridiculous! @seanhannity
1311045024352739344 2020-09-30 04:47:46 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I wish he would get right to the beef! @Americanlll

1310948776513802241 2020-09-29 22:25:19 +0800 <OstmanChristine> Voter fraud is a huge crime and we want justice to be served. Your seat needs to be removed and replaced as fraud is a felony.
1310943404080201729 2020-09-29 22:03:58 +0800 <OstmanChristine> I don't understand this at all! Is this really Our America we live in? Apparently so! It has lost values in many aspects. @RyanAFournier
