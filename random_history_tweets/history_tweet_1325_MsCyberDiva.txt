1300640326223159296 2020-09-01 11:43:13 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @MARCANDERSONNWO Wow, sorry that has happened to you, Marc. NO, you don't deserve it, but keep in mind, a lot of people are anonymous here so they say cruel things because they can! You never have come across as an attention seeker, you put yourself out there &amp; are honest.  https://t.co/hl3uWL7BjK

1300632980013031425 2020-09-01 11:14:01 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 "...Russiagate was a hoax to cover for a failed soft coup and a controlled opposition campaign by Hillary Clinton and democrats..."  Exactly, that is the truth! 👍  https://t.co/b0vDZuhbEp
1300632237570809857 2020-09-01 11:11:04 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 It's not difficult to understand.  The atty claimed Kyle was there to help defend business owners &amp; protesters who were peaceful. True or Not True.  What is not clear, from a legal standpoint is Kyle claimed he was leaving the riots &amp; then was attacked &amp; then he defended himself.
1300630228901883905 2020-09-01 11:03:05 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 I agree, he probably shouldn't have been there. I don't understand what his attorney said about the reason he was there; the biz owner contacted him for help. Seems strange, but it could be true. Not sure if your legal position is correct M'Lord, about it can't be self defense.🤔
1300628817027899392 2020-09-01 10:57:29 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @Jewels661 True.  https://t.co/ETJNv662jw
1300628442161979393 2020-09-01 10:55:59 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 True. He put himself in the position, but not sure that makes him guilty of a crime.
1300628159113568256 2020-09-01 10:54:52 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 I agree he probably shouldn't have been there. The story told about the owner of the businesses contacting him with a request for help seemed a bit shaky, to me.  But, hey, fact: he's innocent until proven guilty, he was in a position where he had no choice but to defend himself.
1300624984335765506 2020-09-01 10:42:15 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 The kid wasn't defending his home but if he didn't have a gun on him he would be dead.  Fact is, these are violent riots, I wouldn't want my kid going out there but he did it and it's a good thing he had a gun because those thugs were planning to KILL him. Love you, James! 😘😍🙏  https://t.co/QrdyQgBpTt

1300623190247366656 2020-09-01 10:35:07 +0800 <MsCyberDiva> @JamesMa96163439 His attorney spoke tonight on Tucker Carlson and said that is not true.  Just thought you'd want to know, M'Lord. 😘   https://t.co/lcWXwkzHLg   https://t.co/pVaDcWFYoz
