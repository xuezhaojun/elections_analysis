1315021039701688321 2020-10-11 04:07:02 +0800 <jiteenahmed> @84MikeHughes @M_Ali_Salik @NTDCtweets @sarabacon1972 @UofGTechnicians As for the BAME community, this might need more work in the sense of showing the benefits of a technical career. We need to show off our excellent BAME role models to BAME community such as the excellent work of @Dacmclean!
1315020264418217984 2020-10-11 04:03:57 +0800 <jiteenahmed> @84MikeHughes @M_Ali_Salik @NTDCtweets @sarabacon1972 @UofGTechnicians I agree to that @84MikeHughes this needs to start at school level to get the youngsters of the future to consider a career as a technician. T-levels may help but schools also need to promote the T-levels as an option for FE as well as A levels, BTECs etc.
1315017189846642688 2020-10-11 03:51:44 +0800 <jiteenahmed> @M_Ali_Salik @NTDCtweets @sarabacon1972 @UofGTechnicians Yep, I used to suffer the annoyance of my parents thinking that a career as a technician was a low value job, what they didn‚Äôt realise (and maybe better knowledge would‚Äôve helped) is that technicians do so much and can be a benefit to the community too!
1315014749319499776 2020-10-11 03:42:02 +0800 <jiteenahmed> @NTDCtweets @M_Ali_Salik @sarabacon1972 @UofGTechnicians @1PM @Dacmclean Hi @NTDCtweets could I attend this as well? I would be interested to hear your action points and perhaps suggest some ideas too?
1315008284416528385 2020-10-11 03:16:21 +0800 <jiteenahmed> @M_Ali_Salik @NTDCtweets @sarabacon1972 @UofGTechnicians Interesting data indeed, more work is definitely needed, I feel we need to show youngsters especially in the BAME community that a career as a technician is an excellent career path to aspire to and can be massively rewarding!
