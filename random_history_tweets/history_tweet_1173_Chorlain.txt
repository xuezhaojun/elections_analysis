1329976914841395200 2020-11-21 10:36:20 +0800 <Chorlain> To be fair. We already have free testing and a "garuntee" that the vaccine is going to be free from major healthcare providers/drugstores. However, the free testing comes from the majority of the work provided by the states and National Guard.

I was but a wee lad then, but it lasted 30 days because of recounts and legal battles. There was no garuntee this time would be easy but hopefully it gets resolved quickly.

That's a failure of the homeschooling community and programs, but what I can say is that teachers are working over time to conform and attend seminars to make it easier on students overall.

1311778033766985733 2020-10-02 05:20:29 +0800 <Chorlain> @thekehlzone "The mother's plan for it." Is exactly the point. No one else's opinion matters at that point and unless you plan something else for an unborn baby, then it's none of your business.
1311661645098348544 2020-10-01 21:38:00 +0800 <Chorlain> @chipfranklin That's what they like about him.
1311395297902432257 2020-10-01 03:59:38 +0800 <Chorlain> "Antifa" is actually referring to antifascism, so if you're gonna use it say the whole thing and let it sit in your mouth.

1311317756785102857 2020-09-30 22:51:30 +0800 <Chorlain> The worst part about the debate is that all Trump supporters loved it because of how he acted because he was just a "regular" guy and wasn't "presidential".

1309167811328200705 2020-09-25 00:28:24 +0800 <Chorlain> I wish congressional Democrats were as adamant to protecting democracy as the Republicans are to destroy it. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer
1308893090565042184 2020-09-24 06:16:45 +0800 <Chorlain> @StephenSeanFord That's correct
1308838142661648385 2020-09-24 02:38:24 +0800 <Chorlain> They knew they are in the wrong because they conveniently declared a state of emergency and activated the Guard unit there. Which means the state got involved , so the highest authority in the state knew what they were doing #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor
