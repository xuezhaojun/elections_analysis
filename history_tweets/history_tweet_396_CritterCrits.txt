1341244257340952578 2020-12-22 12:48:44 +0800 <CritterCrits> @basedpolitik Really, the increase in trans kids since 2000 is so massive it must be driven by a social contagion.
1341243733216534529 2020-12-22 12:46:39 +0800 <CritterCrits> @basedpolitik If and when the world becomes more sane, people will look back at &lt;today's activists demanding we without hesitation must sterilize, mutilate, and drug the *massive* increase in trans youngsters&gt; much like we do now upon lobotomies
1338705716211814400 2020-12-15 12:41:29 +0800 <CritterCrits> @OwenJones84 "full blown white supremacism" for what? Wanting Britain to remain majority British? Is &lt;not taking in foreigners&gt; "terrible racism?" Lunacy. Show me another people who think themselves evil for *not* replacing themselves in their indigenous land.
1337603000773251073 2020-12-12 11:39:41 +0800 <CritterCrits> @setawar @PTSDGuts2 "take in tens of thousands of immigrants annually indefinitely because you like foreign food" is such a terrible take. Its amazing people seriously bring up food when talking about immigration.

1327294076346114052 2020-11-14 00:55:42 +0800 <CritterCrits> @BennettJonah It's be wonderful to have actual open conversations regarding &lt;controversy&gt; but we all know that these dialogues allow only certain stances to air their opinions and grievances, and that their opponents have to sit there and take it, lest they be rejected from polite society.
1326631304759271436 2020-11-12 05:02:05 +0800 <CritterCrits> @JohnFMiller86 Do the woke ever admit demographics is destiny?
1326554541899173894 2020-11-11 23:57:03 +0800 <CritterCrits> @LeCheileDND I've given it a search and apparently the primary definition of tolerance has changed in many dictionaries to something along of the line of "respecting and accepting beliefs and practices of other people regardless if ethnic and religious origin." Hmm.
1326552264937369601 2020-11-11 23:48:00 +0800 <CritterCrits> @LeCheileDND But diversity is division. They both mean to be divided. Literally. The more numerous and sizable divisions a sample has, the more diverse it. You cannot have unity and diversity; they are opposites.  Also, tolerance means to endure unpleasant conditions or stimuli.
1324788979519160325 2020-11-07 03:01:20 +0800 <CritterCrits> @DoomerAnimeFan How tall are you?
1324218278638690304 2020-11-05 13:13:35 +0800 <CritterCrits> @JohnFMiller86 Diversity and unity are literal opposite. As well, the more diversity/heterogeneity, the more inequality there will be. Inevitable, when people have more divergent behaviours and values. Progressive don't examine their own beliefs and toot their utopian horn.

1323122996677062661 2020-11-02 12:41:19 +0800 <CritterCrits> @EvolutionistXX I've thought so as well. Probably true.

1320173342398271490 2020-10-25 09:20:27 +0800 <CritterCrits> @JohnFMiller86 I wonder how much of the bad life outcomes of fatherless children is due to &lt;cads' and poorly-choosing-mother's bad predisposition passed onto their children&gt; rather than &lt;lacking a father&gt;

1319765822563340290 2020-10-24 06:21:06 +0800 <CritterCrits> @EPoe187 @primalpoly I want to say, "yeah, I know racists don't want foreigners in their countries. If they're racist, of course they wouldn't. But what about actual issue at hand?" Wikipedia uses words words words and sociology (the most downstream and ideological 'science') to 'disprove' reality.
1319764386177757186 2020-10-24 06:15:24 +0800 <CritterCrits> @EPoe187 @primalpoly It's because demographic data shows that France (and Europe) actually is becoming less indigenous and more foreign. So Wikipedia uses guilt by associaton and only a single data point to put the accepted progressive narrative through. They fail to refute the central point.
1319762665628119046 2020-10-24 06:08:34 +0800 <CritterCrits> @EPoe187 @primalpoly 'An estimated 5-10% of France is muslim in 2016' and they leave it at that. What? Why not include graphs showing that France *isn't* becoming less ethnically French? Or any other Western nation? Or demographic data showing that children born and old folks are ethnically alike?  https://t.co/TH3R6oJwxU
1319759131574763521 2020-10-24 05:54:31 +0800 <CritterCrits> @EPoe187 @primalpoly Wikipedia calls the idea that France's (and Europe's) chief population are in the process of replacing themselves via mass immigration+low birth rates a "white nationalist far-right conspiracy theory." Sounds bonkers. So, how does wikipedia demonstrate it incorrect?  https://t.co/pnJWMf6LFZ

1318591999193305088 2020-10-21 00:36:45 +0800 <CritterCrits> @KingJon1683 @mingmingmung Growing up in Scarborough whites were always a minority in classes. Most were south/east asians whilst the teachers were white. "Multiculturalism." The frog boils. No one outwardly complained. The fact that whites let this happen tells me that we aren't evil racist conspirators.

1317150006734880770 2020-10-17 01:06:47 +0800 <CritterCrits> @kevincartwood @EPoe187 What makes you think the aborted fetuses were somehow more crime prone than the demographic and class they belonged to?
1317116936002637824 2020-10-16 22:55:23 +0800 <CritterCrits> @kevincartwood @EPoe187 How so? If crime has dropped *per capita* across various crime laden demographics, how could abortion be the cause for said decline?
1317104269435281415 2020-10-16 22:05:03 +0800 <CritterCrits> @kevincartwood @EPoe187 Crime dropped secularly per capita among crime heavy groups including the underclass and lowerclass, as well as overall. So, it's unlikely that crime dropped because there are fewer crime-prone individuals.
1316950822186569729 2020-10-16 11:55:18 +0800 <CritterCrits> @kevincartwood @EPoe187 The drop in crime occured too early to be explicable by rising abortions rates.

Freedom of speech is, in a way, for losers. Winners are always free to say what they wish.

What policies put in place will actually bring all groups to equality and end racialism? None known to man. But we must deepen the problem, or else we're mean? Bad, terrible idea.

Why do you think it'll work? Why not just quit step 1?

1310698948408025098 2020-09-29 05:52:35 +0800 <CritterCrits> @JohnFMiller86 Much agreed. So often it seems that people overlook the possibility that we have problems because reality is bad and people have to make trade-offs. They then insist that social engineering will fix things, and when it fails, the answer is more social engineering.

Even in in which they are indigenous. That's fact, so why is the great replacement considered a conspiracy theory? Who's behind it seems to matter less than that it is happening
