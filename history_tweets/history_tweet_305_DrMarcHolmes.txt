1337262619091152897 2020-12-11 13:07:08 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @samanthagwolfe We have our curriculum of our #VR #MSc/#Ma course online avaliable for potential students to see under the module tabs. If they want the teaching materials as well they will have to do the course!  https://t.co/fLhwmUhFhP
1337256044557455365 2020-12-11 12:41:00 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @brihui For ideas look up rubrics online there are many online for various types of assignments. My problem is having marking which is not subjective or overly convengent to allow for divergence answers. Of you don't care you just write "showed mastery 10 - 0"
1337177932289216513 2020-12-11 07:30:37 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @DrGBuckingham In materials enginnering, there was no ethics boards, there was risk assessments for health &amp; safety and IP concerns. I find getting application for human centered design research to be a pain because I have to apply via a spex board who want clear protocol months in advance.

1326844588590575616 2020-11-12 19:09:36 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @maxcoutte Thinking about it some more @marcogillies and @panxueni  work in the area would be relevant. They have a course on building Virtual Humans.  https://t.co/qr1T5sp6x0
1326771757475393538 2020-11-12 14:20:11 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @maxcoutte Ekman research on facial action for conveying emotion is great resource.  https://t.co/UF2RlEuiPB
1326770135340871681 2020-11-12 14:13:45 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @KiaNazarpour If your in Enginnering you should chose Windows. Key enginnering tools and VR tools have no support on Mac or Linux OS and dual booting often leaves you with unsuitable hardware and wasted time switching interfaces.
1326573563839729664 2020-11-12 01:12:38 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @cpjobling @SUEngineering A depth camera from @Matterport scans and registers the room. They also do the hosting and 360 tour app.

1324126206095142912 2020-11-05 07:07:43 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @cpjobling @SUEngineering Yes message me we will organise it!
1323839038692986881 2020-11-04 12:06:37 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @danieldbryant Most of the staff don't have access to a VR HMD, so a 2D mode is required  I would prefer the option of a VR HMD support experience but its not a red line.
1323651876773109761 2020-11-03 23:42:54 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @wainbrave @immersiveLRN Excellent sending a DM
1323640057081827328 2020-11-03 22:55:56 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @PohlmannMark @DrGBuckingham We already have Zoom so I was looking for something which allows for more socialising, preferably free form!
1323624722467348480 2020-11-03 21:55:00 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @Heatherlovessci @immersiveLRN Ideally! Thanks I will have a look
1323622820245610498 2020-11-03 21:47:26 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> #VR #AR #XR twitter if I wanted to do a virtual event for 500+ science and engineering staff for networking. which vr socials spaces (inc paid) would be the best to support such an event?
1323431196240547840 2020-11-03 09:06:00 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @danieldbryant @SUEngineering Its the matterport camera, it does all the registration and arrangement and hosting  https://t.co/tuOOSMcACs its been around for many years but its expensive to host each year got a grant to look at virtual tours so we did the lab as a test.
1323300188543426560 2020-11-03 00:25:25 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> I haven't been able to visit my #VR lab in @SUEngineering  recently, now I can go check it out on this cool matter port scan!  https://t.co/M4pxPGYGRU
1322983634056478728 2020-11-02 03:27:32 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @BrennanSpiegel @BasicBooks @virtualmedconf Well done Brennan! Who can my library contact if we want to license an sharerable ebook for students
1322295668631871488 2020-10-31 05:53:49 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> Very informative!
1319003720680701952 2020-10-22 03:52:47 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @normalvr Have you change how you port work or is it still need all of udp range available unless you running a private server?
1318667885649317888 2020-10-21 05:38:18 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> I want to add #WindowMixedRealityContoller visualiser script to Unity XR toolkit, now I been an hours in the guts of #MRTK trying to work out how it spawns it. The documentation are out of date, talking about a prefab which no longer exist! Why is has this been made so hard!
1318467943647354881 2020-10-20 16:23:48 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @LeiaInc And whats the resolution per view.
1318466385786376193 2020-10-20 16:17:36 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @LeiaInc Ah I found the ama reddit deleted it  https://t.co/7es9VW3oZh
1318465885053636613 2020-10-20 16:15:37 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @LeiaInc Hi you don't have a direct link to the AMA so I will ask here. How many views in the horizontal and vertical are there and at what angles / spacing
1318273709212422148 2020-10-20 03:31:59 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> I spoke to Greg and he said it was dependent on if reddit released the data... So I started web scraping!
1318250472558514177 2020-10-20 01:59:39 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> #Reddit is doing another collaborative art thing at r/Layer/ last time they did one r/Place  Greg Bahm created this #visualisation in #VR  https://t.co/q0MVP56PYU I wonder if the same thing is possible this time and what #patterns will emerge!
1314891457694699520 2020-10-10 19:32:07 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @hrafntho Well you could lean on the table if you built the set which would be nice. Also it be single purpose where as with VR I can load up a different world in seconds. And thats why AR is so limited it only adds to the current world.
1314531242818314243 2020-10-09 19:40:45 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> Oh Jessie(my lab) we are going to make you a HMD!   https://t.co/8H7DQLNQ7v

1313507851797659648 2020-10-06 23:54:10 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> I am glad we could get the #VR operational with new cleaning techniques form @cleanboxtech
1313466551102824448 2020-10-06 21:10:03 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @IAmSusanPersky @IRPatNIH @genome_gov Can you please link to the publish paper. Have you started looking at if changing the avatars changes the effects and the stigma?
1311365346016854016 2020-10-01 02:00:37 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> Listening to this and think I go the VR MSc perfect aligned subject specialist with VR development skill is the way forward.  https://t.co/fLhwmUhFhP
1310995728987291649 2020-09-30 01:31:53 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @sue_dingle What next year the course could be done online and/or part time?
1310961657657659392 2020-09-29 23:16:30 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @DrGBuckingham @cleanboxtech A clean sign off!
1310947310734585856 2020-09-29 22:19:29 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @DrRichardCobley @cleanboxtech I think they the UVC-Led technology (its too expensive for a tear down!). researched by "Klaran by Crystal IS" which have an explanation of the technology here. @cleanboxtech  please correct me if I am wrong.  https://t.co/hnARrp3Csx
1310689126841282562 2020-09-29 05:13:33 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @cleanboxtech @toddkleinhans $1800 per box (got the cx1 and cx2 confused) plus solutions. Its expensive until you compare the time its takes to get a clean with wipes to a satisfactory level being around 25 minutes! That means it would take about 25 hours to clean 60 headsets and controllers vs 5 hours.
1310688810485903363 2020-09-29 05:12:18 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @toddkleinhans @cleanboxtech Opp I got the price for a cx2 quote sorry. Which is 2 cones.
1310685068109676546 2020-09-29 04:57:26 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @toddkleinhans @cleanboxtech The final piont is with this product its hard to make a mistake with wipes you have to be methodical.  And 25 minutes is too long for a quick pop into vr where as the 5 minutes or 1 minutes clean depending on controller needs is very user friendly.
1310683904978948096 2020-09-29 04:52:48 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @toddkleinhans @cleanboxtech I am requesting budget for there new product for controller cleaning which would take that down to a about an hour or as when needed.
1310681080190599174 2020-09-29 04:41:35 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @DrJasonWJones @cleanboxtech There are uvc lights in the white cone section designed for VR headset geometry with airflow to remove moisture and small debris from the interiors of the headset which have been treated with moisture repentant spray.
1310608610473521152 2020-09-28 23:53:37 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> The pandemic made us revaluate cleaning wipes, so we went with Cleanbox's UV-C system which kills #SARSCoV2  (#COVID-19), resulting in a 99.999%+ efficacy on #VR headsets in 60 seconds. We just got 5 of them so that our VR room (with other H&amp;S) can be used with confidence again!  https://t.co/4LsoDPXoiT
1309631032161861632 2020-09-26 07:09:04 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @shlykur Ahh well the hunt continues. My unity developer wanted one for when he was on the bus for 3 hours a day so far they been either under powered or expensive. I am sure there will be more wireless pcvr headsets in the next gen.
1309599447790256128 2020-09-26 05:03:34 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @shlykur This is a mobile desktop replacement setup so we chose performance over battery life. Got any good recommendations for Unity VR development laptop which has good battery life and is sub £1500?
1309547960297033730 2020-09-26 01:38:58 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @JuliaChatain Everyday Design of Things, with out how do you have the words to talk about the concepts of human interaction! I would teach from the whole book if @mitpress would license it in a way that @SwanseaUniLib library could lend it to students!
1309522263579021314 2020-09-25 23:56:52 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> The new #VR #MSc is not stop by #Lockdown because we planned for this eventuality all-along!

1305463885529591809 2020-09-14 19:10:19 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @kelly_raita @screencasto I wish I did my lectures in a VR memory place but this year there is so much going on maybe next. I could write a .srt reader and put it on in the canvas floating in front of the user. I am writing an intro to coding so that be a good example of a read in a file.
1305338677434945536 2020-09-14 10:52:47 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @benloveridge Thanks for the recommendation I will give Trint a go. I am using camtasia which is just Microsoft built in dictation. I also tried Google transcribe which surprisingly bad results. some times I have to do nothing, but a lot of times I have to start all over again.
1305329908856561665 2020-09-14 10:17:56 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> Captioning videos takes so long!  Currently taking 15 minutes to to 1 mintues of video but I think its worth it as the message is clearer. I got nearly 2 weeks worth of captioning I am going to retrain the AI may be I can get that down to 7.5 to 1
1305054135851667456 2020-09-13 16:02:07 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> #aardvarkxr is the missing link in VR I need to be able multi process with out dropping out of VR!

1303849844654645248 2020-09-10 08:16:41 +0800 <DrMarcHolmes> @lloretalvar0 Focus mode switching is important to problem solving. Throwing you self relentlessly means your brain can't be come unfocused and find new solutions. That's one of those thing we don't teach in #pedagogy enought

Not yet brave enough to get a tracker shotput and dry firing a bow is dangerous (maybe a dampening spring)
