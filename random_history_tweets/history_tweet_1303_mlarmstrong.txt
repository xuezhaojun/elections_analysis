1332225912818049026 2020-11-27 15:33:03 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @Ron4California Not surprising. Sad, for sure. But, not surprising at all.  I'd dearly love to see details on all the behind-the-scenes shenanigans that happened to President Trump's Twitter account over the last four years, but particularly those in the last four months.

And, if they help themselves to anything as they pass through, that's all good? What if they just didn't want something and decided to dump it on your land?

Does another's "freedom of movement" supersede your rights to property or privacy?  Extrapolating up, it makes sense to secure national borders physically and legally.  Otherwise, what stops other societies from changing our freedoms?

And, although I believe in wearing seat belts, I don't think the Government should be in charge of that decision.

1326686228650094592 2020-11-12 08:40:20 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @marknoble @mylittlesydney @GovMikeDeWine This is it, in a nutshell. Basically, homemade masks are a safety blanket.  Ironically, that's one of the biggest risks the WHO originally mentioned about widespread mask-wearing: people think they're protected and get complacent.
1326685339616997377 2020-11-12 08:36:48 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @Lawdemigod @superdivorce @mylittlesydney @GovMikeDeWine I've seen the seat belt comparison several times. How is that even parallel? If someone doesn't wear a seat belt, they're the only one that suffers, right? That's not the argument people are making with masks, so how is it relevant? I just don't see the comparison.

His behavior may be understandable, but for anyone casually "checking things out to see how I should vote," it may be a turn-off.
1311354796184686593 2020-10-01 01:18:41 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @snowsnickers @Flyfishinmary @megynkelly TBH, I missed a bit toward the early part of the debate and, it appears, much of the fireworks between Trump and Wallace.  I agree that Wallace's questions leaned Left in what I did see.  Still, Trump's attacks aren't going to endear him to anyone even close to "on the fence."

I could see an argument for bumping him higher on the political scale, but he's definitely more socially liberal, IMHO.

Walsh &gt; Knowles &gt; Boreing &gt; Shapiro &gt; Klavan  TBH, I'm guessing a bit on the GodKing's positions.  Because @andrewklavan's at the "bottom" of the list, I think he's the most palatable to moderates.
1304281767969468420 2020-09-11 12:53:00 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @CAconservPundit @EvanAKilgore I do think the specialization (i.e., "trimming the fat") for professional degrees might be the best option now.  Still, it's sad that the universities have moved away from the classical model that taught HOW to think, rather than the current slop that promotes WHAT to think.

Certainly, you can make decent money with the skills from a trade school or vocational program at a community college.  Maybe we just need a "hyper-vocational" school for professional programs, then.

I still sometimes have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that the SPLC (let alone the NYT) have so normalized the idea that ideas and beliefs like these  -- once so common in America -- are "radical" now.

1301766201069187072 2020-09-04 14:17:02 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @NWLibertarian According to their website, the founder, Joey Gibson, "has organized dozens of marches and rallies in support of free speech, gun rights, medical freedom, and sanctuary counties for the constitution."  Again, this is now "far right"?
1301765845492916224 2020-09-04 14:15:37 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @NWLibertarian Their FB page says, "Patriot Prayer is about fighting corruption, big government, and tyranny using God for strength and the power of love."  That's "far right" now?

However, I think the violence is only likely from the radical Left; just the degree will vary.
1301761377523118081 2020-09-04 13:57:52 +0800 <mlarmstrong> @washingtonpost @BryanLeontes It's telling that one of the options wasn't a "Trump landslide."  Telling about WaPo, that is.  I'm not saying a #Trump2020LandslideVictory is inevitable; however, the fact that you and your "experts" didn't even consider it shows how out of touch with the heartland you are.

Glad you said it.  I recall hearing that he had his daughter involved in some of  his "social work," so I can only imagine what the poor girl is thinking right now.  Prayers are in order, for sure.

I've gotten frustrated with him in recent years because I think, A) he's more cynical now, and B) he has to push quantity for the Daily Wire.  Don't get me wrong, I still like his work, but not as much as the older stuff.

That amendment restricts the Government from mandating a specific religion, but it does not guarantee any "freedom from religion" in the public square.
