1343768243467522048 2020-12-29 11:58:09 +0800 <3speakonline> @taskmaster4450 ur understanding is impressive at this early stage. One thing this allows give to do, that is not focused on, is to approach other content platforms to plug in and benefit from the ipfs storage and the token creation system. This is where we think the network effect will come

1341071598384631808 2020-12-22 01:22:39 +0800 <3speakonline> 2020 is not the year for fence sitters. Every freedom we hold dear has been directly attacked under the guise of safety. The road to tyranny is paved with ‚Äúsave‚Äù intentions.  #Censorship will not be tolerated.   We are the gatekeepers now.  #HiveFixesThis #SPEAK

1337467582694055937 2020-12-12 02:41:35 +0800 <3speakonline> We have no fear the people will speak.  If given a soapbox, they will speak.  Who will listen?  That isn't up to me or you, or anyone for that matter.  We encourage you to speak, never stop.  We encourage you to listen, with an open heart.

1335593654103101440 2020-12-06 22:35:15 +0800 <3speakonline> When a network has no CEO, #censorship can only be attempted by buying out or lobbying the community. When you release your #ico 2 early and now hold many of your tokens you are basically the ceo. A point of failure that will be lobbied,  targeted and #corrupted.   #fairtokendrop

1329107045463691265 2020-11-19 00:59:47 +0800 <3speakonline> That is why word of mouth is so important and so powerful. When you can‚Äôt speak on platforms, speak to people directly! It is freedom of speech‚Äôs last defense. #BigTech will continue to censor any decentralized alternatives.   #SpeakUp #TwitterCensorship #HiveFixesThis
1329106092815646721 2020-11-19 00:56:00 +0800 <3speakonline> Why hasn‚Äôt many heard of these freedom tools on #Hive?  It‚Äôs called #Censorship. You can‚Äôt even recommend #3Speak without the tweet being censored.  They would only do this if they felt threatened. @theycallmedan_ biggest crime was apparently shilling #freespeech too much.  https://t.co/4JRjH51F0c

1328758473216036869 2020-11-18 01:54:41 +0800 <3speakonline> Use a VPN when using #3speak if having any issues. You local ISP may have added 3speak to a block list.   #Censorship ramping up, but the solutions are ramping up faster.

Take ETH for example, moving from PoW to PoS is about as big of change you can make to a blockchain. #Hive can always upgrade to the latest tech.
1328015683087519745 2020-11-16 00:43:06 +0800 <3speakonline> We‚Äôre apart of the biggest awakening in our life times. The net has given us the ability to share info instantly across the globe.  Without #freespeech, this shared information becomes weaponized &amp; used to control/divide us.  Safety is disguised as a Trojan horse for tyranny.
1327872718339883008 2020-11-15 15:15:01 +0800 <3speakonline> Depends on how you decide to design your trending feeds. Everyone can access the network and build what they like on it. If one so chooses, they can build a site that only shows downvoted content and comments. The data is there, just pull it out and present it how you like it
1327717901554520065 2020-11-15 04:59:50 +0800 <3speakonline> The idea that #twitter #facebook and #youtube will survive as stand alone platforms and not simply as separate communities built on distributed networks is old school #web2 thinking. They will need #web3. #hivefixesthis

It will be a distributed system with joint ownership by all parties and platforms involved. The network will reward them with ownership appropriately and autonomously.

1326697999691472896 2020-11-12 09:27:06 +0800 <3speakonline> #YoutubeDOWN   Come try out some decentralized alternatives to #Youtube.   #BreakTheSpell #3Speak #HiveFixesThis
1326624302788087808 2020-11-12 04:34:15 +0800 <3speakonline> The big #censors excluded distributed #web3 tech from their #Overton window calculations. When #censored #communities join to create their own crypto money backed by huge user bases and #censorship resistant speech, legacy platforms will become mere traffic funnels for new users
1326531245254217728 2020-11-11 22:24:29 +0800 <3speakonline> @NathanMars7 This
1326406655752499203 2020-11-11 14:09:24 +0800 <3speakonline> So many #censored creators going to centralised alternatives. Insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results.  https://t.co/l4LxXFiJdm is a distributed network. These networks are the only way to make your content #censorship resistant. #hivefixesthis

1325122756313149443 2020-11-08 01:07:39 +0800 <3speakonline> With all the talks of #censorship beware of false promises from closed source, centralized apps that claim to be supporters of #freespeech. Web3 removes the trust &amp; adds transparency.  Use tech you don‚Äôt have to trust, because centralized apps gain power &amp; power corrupts. #Hive
1325100951175192576 2020-11-07 23:41:00 +0800 <3speakonline> @SuperNormaled 3/3 - community decides how debt free tokens are distributed, not a private group  of central bankers
1325100888277409793 2020-11-07 23:40:45 +0800 <3speakonline> @SuperNormaled 2/3 - accounts can‚Äôt be sanctioned  - ability to create your own money and economy without debt backed system - your voice cannot be censored by twitter or Facebook  - the more of a token you earn / purchase the more stay you have over governance
1325100743242653699 2020-11-07 23:40:11 +0800 <3speakonline> @SuperNormaled 1/2 it gives everyone an equal playing field access to the exact same set of tools our current ruling class have monopolised. Except without the usury.  - Back up your own content and text immutably.  - own your own accounts and communities immutably
1324950453692506112 2020-11-07 13:42:59 +0800 <3speakonline> Fleeing physical land to escape tyranny will be the #3speak digital equivalent of setting up an immutable community, backing up your content on a distributed,  censorship resistant network, releasing your own token and putting your middle finger in the air to #censorship
1324512331347447809 2020-11-06 08:42:02 +0800 <3speakonline> @hiveonboard The actions one takes in times such as these will truly define the future. Build, use, support and meme about freedom tools
1324419827230937088 2020-11-06 02:34:27 +0800 <3speakonline> @HelloMSQ @FinanceLeo @hiveblocks We are fans of pretty much every app on #HIVE. If we had to choose a few, @PeakDcom @splinterlands &amp; a new decentralized Twitter alternative called @dbuzzAPP - But you also have communities that are almost "app like" for instance @FinanceLeo has their own site/token built on Hive
1324412556262273024 2020-11-06 02:05:34 +0800 <3speakonline> #Censorship has deep psychological effects on societies. People stop speaking up. Information is divided. The population becomes submissive.  Power consolidates when #freespeech is blocked. Unchecked power always corrupts.  Time is short.  Speak up now or forever hold your peace.
1324410495328157697 2020-11-06 01:57:23 +0800 <3speakonline> The smell of censorship is thick today. #TwitterCensorship   #Hive is the air freshener.
1324277141442355200 2020-11-05 17:07:29 +0800 <3speakonline> @MouthyBuddha At some point some of u famous creators will start normalising the words ‚Äòcoincidence theorists‚Äô to describe the followers of the generally accepted, Overton window confined ‚Äònarrative‚Äô

That‚Äôs what it comes down to, fiat can be hyper inflated away, legally, no recourse for the fiat bag hodlers. So with Bitcoin we don‚Äôt need to worry about breaking laws as code is law.

He mostly spoke about free speech &amp; solutions for people to use that are being oppressed. Sadly there are thousands of people like Dan that have been silenced by big tech.  Flip the script. #HiveFixesThis

1322207320886050822 2020-10-31 00:02:45 +0800 <3speakonline> @fold_app Twitter bans us from advertising because we‚Äôre a free speech platform. Starting to see a pattern.
1321919941608644608 2020-10-30 05:00:48 +0800 <3speakonline> #censorship gives the censor control of the Overton window, moving it until it has the perfect balance of power masked behind a perceived acceptable range of debate.  Censorship is therefore the antithesis of #freedom  Distributed #blockchain applications resist censorship #hive

1321545323777421312 2020-10-29 04:12:12 +0800 <3speakonline> @jack Hey Jack. Ever thought about integrating Twitter on to a public blockchain like #Hive? Hive is currently at less than 1% compacity. Would be a bold move to support decentralization &amp; give users ownership of their data.
1321531361971347459 2020-10-29 03:16:44 +0800 <3speakonline> Are you aware that the decentralisation of money that you are so interested in can also be applied to social media for platforms @jack? A decentralised Twitter app such as  https://t.co/AdMRru4dAU solve #twitter‚Äôs problems
1321523498007719937 2020-10-29 02:45:29 +0800 <3speakonline> It's looking more &amp; more like big tech didn't get big by accident.
1321508699010068480 2020-10-29 01:46:40 +0800 <3speakonline> @bytemaster7 Have you checked out  https://t.co/hZhkfw7JWw? I read your old post last night  https://t.co/lEBvgyPLZa and it seems Hive is fulfilling your original vision of a side chain with smart contracts which enable token creation, marketplaces etc. The yellow brick road awaits.
1321507558356447232 2020-10-29 01:42:08 +0800 <3speakonline> @masterthematric Yes. We use Hive to store meta data like account info, text, communities etc. and we have a built in torrent system for users to store and share videos. V2 launching soon which will include desktop app and IPFS storage capabilities.
1321488153996193797 2020-10-29 00:25:02 +0800 <3speakonline> @RubinReport Not us. We moved to #Hive awhile ago. Stop trusting CEOs with your free speech, trust in open source, decentralized protocols that are fair and verifiable. Don't Trust, verify.
1321487527740542976 2020-10-29 00:22:33 +0800 <3speakonline> "We realize we need to earn more trust." - @jack   Mmm... how about no?  Don't trust. Verify.   Communities will use decentralized protocols to replace human CEOs so we no longer have to trust Jack, Zuck &amp; the rest of the #Censorship Gang.  You can catch us buidling on #Hive
1321469501683036160 2020-10-28 23:10:55 +0800 <3speakonline> @LizRNC We have a choice on what tech we use now. We can continue to use centralized big tech which keeps censoring us, or we can choose a new way. The new way is built on top of technology like #Hive which replaces the CEO with a protocol. Decentralized tech is the future.

1321182189841645568 2020-10-28 04:09:15 +0800 <3speakonline> Trust yourself.  Reject authority.   Preserve the dignity of the individual.

I appluad Dan for looking past tribalism and using the tools available to become more independent from the centralized services that dominate our lives today.
1321157672838721537 2020-10-28 02:31:49 +0800 <3speakonline> Everyone should be doing this that relies on #web2 alone. Time to start making the migration to #web3 on your own terms. Waiting until you get banned will only make the process much more tedious. Steady transisiton is what is needed to finally defeat this #censorship issue. #Hive

Did they not know we have all the best hackers/coders? Did they not think we would rebuild our world without their permission?  Freedom always finds a way free.

For instance, 3speaks front end does not solely use votes for the trending algorithm. No one on hive can censor your words or ban your account. Rewards are a bonus not a given.

1311522206845820928 2020-10-01 12:23:55 +0800 <3speakonline> #Web2 may be able to silence your speech on their platforms, but with #Web3 the censored have a community to stand with.  They call us a lot of things, but one thing they can't say is our speech isn't free.  Let the carcasses of suspended accounts pave the way to a new way.
1311454982999285761 2020-10-01 07:56:48 +0800 <3speakonline> @DuffieldSatoshi @Davincij15 @LBRYcom Try #web3 decentralised platforms!!

1311017467381075968 2020-09-30 02:58:16 +0800 <3speakonline> @BitcoinDood We see a wide array of immutable dapps being built, each creating worldwide, borderless communities. We see tons of tools being built now &amp; foresee those tools being used to make the internet a more free &amp; less predatory place.   Our only limitation is our imaginations. #HiveChat
1311016061160968193 2020-09-30 02:52:41 +0800 <3speakonline> Some big things being built on #3speak, including a fully decentralized desktop dapp that will act as a nuclear bunker for everyone. Once launched, no one will be able to take it down.   Fight #censorship with #web3 dapps!
1310634943689764867 2020-09-29 01:38:15 +0800 <3speakonline> @FreedomofPress #web3 platforms are uncensorable use distributed systems such as #HIVE or #3speak.
1310570019026358272 2020-09-28 21:20:16 +0800 <3speakonline> In today‚Äôs climate and viral events, #censorship will be synonymous with #treason

1309512172087713793 2020-09-25 23:16:46 +0800 <3speakonline> @Mamajutsu We will get to see behind the curtain
1309494761057910785 2020-09-25 22:07:34 +0800 <3speakonline> Does having location tracking apps on your phone which can be used to limit, track, control movements of you, your friends and families make you a de-facto enemy of freedom? At least these location tracking apps won‚Äôt be able to stop your #freespeech on #web3 and #HIVE #freedom  https://t.co/2e68wVOfVH
1309492485153054720 2020-09-25 21:58:32 +0800 <3speakonline> @MartiniGuyYT Does having this app on your phone make you an enemy of freedom?
1309438455693402113 2020-09-25 18:23:50 +0800 <3speakonline> @BitcoinDood We would also recommend @Vimm_TV as well as 3speak streaming

1309265735772975104 2020-09-25 06:57:31 +0800 <3speakonline> Imagine a video network where storage is distributed all over the world, making it almost impossible to censor, with immutable communities in which creators have the ability to create their own token economies. coming soon #censorship resistant.

1306666930196172802 2020-09-18 02:50:47 +0800 <3speakonline> The worlds biggest podcaster and the worlds biggest privacy advocate talk about problems with web2 platforms caused by their centralised nature. Problems that #HIVE blockchain and #3Speak already solved. #web3.0 will prevent censorship and maintain privacy  https://t.co/dfDY9azbln
1306385495006552065 2020-09-17 08:12:28 +0800 <3speakonline> @oAcido @gen_escobar @Twitter The audacity to think that censored people won‚Äôt think of solutions that completely bury‚Äôs the censors into the annals of history is either naive or incredibly stupid. Fortunately everyone will have the free speech to ridicule and socially shame the censors once that time comes.

The difference between Hive &amp; Eth is Hive was made to build social apps, it‚Äôs scaled &amp; feature-rich in this department. Hive is also bridging to ETH, so ETH can leverage Hive.
