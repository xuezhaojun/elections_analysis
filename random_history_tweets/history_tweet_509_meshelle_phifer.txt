1335602548489609216 2020-12-06 23:10:36 +0800 <meshelle_phifer> @MarkWarner What about majority of Americans who won't receive 1 penny on this bill? 52% small business did NOT receive last stimulus b/c trump. Without direct payments Americans can't buy food pay rent. Giving to businesses won't TRICKLE DOWN. THEY BUY STOCKS BACK FIRE/LAYOFF

We just found out this week about the 2nd emergency surgery. $750.00 a month just for health insurance for husband. Insulin is $900 a month. We've been surviving on cans of Campbell's soup for months now. I hope our government helps everyone soon

I feel bad complaining when I know there are so many people that have it a lot worse then we do. We worked and saved all our lives only to have it disappear within the year because of this pandemic

1334961266385846272 2020-12-05 04:42:22 +0800 <meshelle_phifer> IF Congress passes legislation without including direct payments to Americans, what's the point? Giving to businesses instead of families NEVER works. Trickle down stimulus is exactly like trickle down economics. Doesn't work. Save corporations but not individuals who need money
1334944946411819008 2020-12-05 03:37:31 +0800 <meshelle_phifer> @AyannaPressley Hi Miss Ayanna, my 63 yr old husband has to have 2 emergency surgeries one C Spine and other Brain surgery to remove 2 tumors. We exhausted our savings 401(k) all retirement in the last year. We can't pay mtg this month. We can't afford food, insulin (husband is diabetic) help

1334929934813282304 2020-12-05 02:37:52 +0800 <meshelle_phifer> @RepKatiePorter @SenGillibrand Give money directly to Americans. Businesses receiving ppp loans still fired layed off and stock buybacks. Give money directly to individuals instead of businesses. We need to pay rent buy food and we can manage our money by ourselves. Stop giving to middlemen. They keep it
1334926099038392321 2020-12-05 02:22:38 +0800 <meshelle_phifer> @AOC Good Morning Congresswoman, my 63 yr old husband is facing  emergency brain and spine surgeries. We are broke. We drained all 401(k), retirement accounts in last year. Please American need cash. Giving all money to businesses has proven disastrous as they fire layoff people. Help

John, in 54 days Trump will no longer be president and can no longer protect you from criminal charges that are surely coming your way. I will be sitting in the front row at your trial and I sure hope I'm called as a witness.
