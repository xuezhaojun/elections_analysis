1344015714466869250 2020-12-30 04:21:31 +0800 <DonArno89134002> @iproofer1 That's why we just had an election. Having a President &amp; hopefully (GA ?) a Congress and the expertise of the best in Intel and Foreign policy who w/follow their recommendations. Republicans and 45 w/t busy robbing taxpayers committing stock fraud, instigating Iran w/ Netanya..

Of course China's a threat, other Countries are bigger threat, Putin's criminal gov is more immediate threat globally.

R die hards either choose to ignore corruption and lies to bolster the racism, and their need to hate, that's including what's good for them and Country. Fed lies and misinformation by their party, wake up.

Vindictiveness is 45's pleasure, and having the power to inflict suffering and pain is orgasmic to him !
1325129629108211712 2020-11-08 01:34:57 +0800 <DonArno89134002> My hope noe is for "accountability" , from Biden's administration and former impeached 45's administration's lawless activities, and culpability of R leadership.  Rule of Law needs to be upheld especially from prominent positions !  Trust in Leadership essential &amp; critical.
