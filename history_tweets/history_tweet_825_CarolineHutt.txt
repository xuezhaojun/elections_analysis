Reality is we voted to leave and have secured a tariff free deal - best with EU by a third nation status country. Stock market up 2.5% on first day dealing since deal confirmed.

I personally know 3 retired Chief Constables &amp; all are exceptional men with incredible integrity.  I’m a huge supporter of law &amp; order. Maybe I just didn’t pick up the bit where this poor man charged the police officer..... I appreciate it’s a tough job

I hope I’m wrong about this as I know what a tough job policing is.  Know personally 3 retired Chief Constables who are incredibly decent men.

I do not sit in my arse &amp; criticise but seek truth. Show me the footage where this poor man attacked the police or even charged them. It would appear that his only intent was to harm himself. Personal attacks on me won’t work well.

He stood his ground when approached by advancing officers.  Is that what you mean? I can see no reason why this man was killed.

Must guilty of that? MSM like BBC who relentlessly tried to influence us to remain in EU. And vast majority of Parliament. But we still voted to leave. Again and again. Live with it or go. It’s over.

I did watch the film - of course I did or I wouldn’t have commented. I am just uncomfortable that he was killed. He was obviously seriously mentally ill - couldn’t have been tazered again or shot in the arm/shoulder?
1343476506367025152 2020-12-28 16:38:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NormanBrennan @YorkshireLady3 @PoliceChiefs @AssocPCCs I did watch the whole incident and I’m not a stupid person. I’m a supporter of the police but I’m struggling to see the threat here. He didn’t hurt anyone else apart from himself. Shoot him in the shoulder? Arm? Why kill? Maybe I’m missing something....
1343353247914983429 2020-12-28 08:29:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @tomhfh @heidiEC5 The Turing scheme is global and gives students the opportunity to go beyond the confines of the EU. Must be better!

He hadn’t hurt anyone else, was cutting himself. Why not just taser him? Why kill him? I’m very uncomfortable with this....

1343346138414510081 2020-12-28 08:00:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Charliethered3 @BrionneCranlei1 @StayEuropean The stain on us was put there by the undemocratic elements who wanted to ignore the referendum result.

1343166450341654530 2020-12-27 20:06:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @fishingforleave @BorisJohnson You don’t have an industry capable of fishing yet but have the investment to start building back. We needed a tariff free trade deal and this is a small price to pay.
1343165843564351488 2020-12-27 20:04:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClareAdams @BritishInde @fishingforleave @JulieAdmin @BorisJohnson That will be the UK’s decision as a self governing country.  Not sure you get that yet.  You will though....
1343165476411682817 2020-12-27 20:02:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @pashipway @kevinLi13078672 @fishingforleave @C53758546Mandy @BorisJohnson Exactly right! 👏 we offered 3 years and EU wanted 14 years.  I’d say 5.5 years is a good deal especially as it takes time to build fishing industry
1343164174462021633 2020-12-27 19:57:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jmonkarchdesign @SophyRidgeSky Well said! Time to celebrate and congratulate Oxford scientists who have worked around the clock to save lives!

We chose self governance over anything else. We now have a great deal unlike any other deal afforded to 3rd status nations. Be thankful.

1342942453742137345 2020-12-27 05:16:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DougleDee A good reason not to vote Labour then. Look, to that that elusive tariff free deal there had to be a compromise.  So our offer was 3 years and they wanted 14 yes.  We settled for a 5.5 years.. fair enough

My family ((US, Israel, SA, Poland, Sweden) and network is global which is why I voted for Brexit. I wanted my country to be on the world stage and not just a jigsaw piece in Project EU.

Btw Amsterdam is charming but doesn’t compare to London! As for Sweden... huge problems with rising crime, expensive, freezing cold, dark.

Dc was investigated by police and exonerated. I agree on your other points though. We have far too often become like baying hounds wanting blood

She called as she was vomiting &amp; was alone with the child. Vomiting was not known as symptom of Covid and she didn’t have sore throat or cough.... Steven, we are on brink of Brexit deal, partly thanks to this man’s genius. Be grateful!
1341880347269754880 2020-12-24 06:56:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SeanR_1 @BaskervilleJudy @afneil Jeez! The witch hunt continues! I’m not going there as there was a police investigation and he was exonerated by the law. Leave it alone!

At that time it was thought sore throats, cough were symptoms... read on. He broke no rules unlike Blackford, Sturgeon and that other SNP MPs who travelled in public knowing she was Covid+
1341876391139274759 2020-12-24 06:40:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lucinbat @afneil Not getting into it - what was done to his family was disgusting - people were like baying hounds looking for a kill! Shameful. More important things to debate now
1341876002264387586 2020-12-24 06:39:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @piping_chemist @BaskervilleJudy @afneil No he didn’t. Stop making up stories. SNP MP who travelled London to Scotland KNOWING she was Covid + .. on public transport.
1341875456799354882 2020-12-24 06:36:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jack_Turnbull1 @lucinbat @afneil And that’s exactly what he did!

1341874644849188864 2020-12-24 06:33:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lucinbat @afneil Get your facts right. Bet you aren’t so vindictive about the SNP MP who know king had Covid but travelled from London to Scotland...
1341874189054185473 2020-12-24 06:31:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RogerGrahamD @BaskervilleJudy @afneil I agree.  She shouldn’t resign.  These witch hunts are shameful.
1341873906995650566 2020-12-24 06:30:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BaskervilleJudy @afneil Utter crap! The only thing DC that was questionable was drive to Barnard Castle.  He didn’t risk anyone’s health.  On the other hand Sturgeon is an elected leader of SNP (DC not elected politician) and put those around her at risk.
1341873094483456000 2020-12-24 06:27:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lucinbat @afneil Yes there is.  The first one (Sturgeon) threatens the health of all around her and the second (DC) puts nobody at risk... that’s what you mean isn’t it..?)
1341871452971261952 2020-12-24 06:20:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrexitTrump2020 @MrMasonMills I don’t believe he has sold out. Have faith!
1341871188314865666 2020-12-24 06:19:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nigel_Farage Time to stop right now. If we have a deal that means we self govern, have a free trade deal, we can afford to compromise on fish - a bit!

My mum in law is testimony to that. When you say this you belittle &amp; disrespect what happened. Sure, be disappointed by Brexit BUT when you start likening people like me to Nazis you harm your very soul. Don’t. Please.
1341687791416164352 2020-12-23 18:11:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> The look in his eyes tells of the fear he is feeling.  Utterly heartbreaking 💔💔💔

Referring to ‘brown shirts’ to me with Jewish family - some escaped Germany but others didn’t - is hugely offensive. I don’t mind banter (even the sexist bits) but comments like this are over the red line. Ok, laddie?
1341681335992258560 2020-12-23 17:45:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @simondolan @heidiEC5 I trust the government - I just think of the alternative and give an involuntary shudder... of course mistakes have been made but by and large they’ve worked well over past year in devastating circumstances

As we near the end of transition it was bound to be bumpy. I only hope we have a mutually beneficial deal and have a respectful relationship in the future. UK will survive &amp; thrive - it always does.

Not the case here in UK where our stance has been clear - we don’t want to be a member of EU. If EU is popular in NL then it’s only right that you are members.  I wouldn’t dream of criticising you for that view.

1341526494338805763 2020-12-23 07:30:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @kent_keith Brexit, new immigration laws, addressing green issues, recruiting more nurses, doctors and police.  Unfortunately Covid strict 2-3 months in but I think we’ve handled it well despite some early mistakes... half million people vaccinated already - way ahead most of world!

1340577733735305216 2020-12-20 16:40:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Katieleighxox Why? You do realise they didn’t spread the virus? That Europe is in same state? Pay attention!
1340577366435893248 2020-12-20 16:38:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a beautiful family with all the hopes and dreams that we have today. I know Sonja held her babies close in the final act of evil and they knew true love in that final moment. We hold you all in our hearts with love now 💔💔
1340576097822498816 2020-12-20 16:33:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a lovely young man who lived for nearly a year in this hellhole.. we remember you, Kurt. 💔💔
1340574780295135234 2020-12-20 16:28:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ShentonStage @ZacGoldsmith @BorisJohnson This is ridiculous! He did what he had to do given our inability to follow social distancing rules! Same for entire Europe too! So PM to blame for that? At least with Churchill he didn’t have to deal with a blame resistant &amp; spoilt, selfish population!
1340574089984020480 2020-12-20 16:25:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bimblinghill @ZacGoldsmith And in Belgium? France? Spain? Germany? Italy? Holland? Sweden? FFS just stop it!

1340572874898366469 2020-12-20 16:20:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ElbaDragon @ZacGoldsmith The WHOLE of Europe is in same position! Are you going to bone PM for that too??!! I’m so glad people like you weren’t around at start of WW2.  If we had all adhered to social distancing and complied with rules we would be like Far East now!
1340572074004373504 2020-12-20 16:17:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NoCake4Brexit @ZacGoldsmith Oh FFS you still have fbpe on your bio! 🤣🤣 we see where you are.... 😂

1340350998150307842 2020-12-20 01:39:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RichardBurgon How is Wales (Labour controlled) doing following these short lockdowns??? Stop trying to make political capital over this pandemic! FFS people are dying - have you no shame??
1340334457308459009 2020-12-20 00:33:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbclaurak Just listened to you viciously attacking PM... you should be ashamed of yourself.  The country needs uplifting and your wicked spite is shameful. Nasty!

1340195792963973123 2020-12-19 15:22:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I wonder who is pulling his strings..

1340194568143319040 2020-12-19 15:17:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Juliest101 Utter nonsense! You favour a restrictive nanny state which is evident from your bio.  I guess you must be suffering over Brexit which accounts for some of your abusive and venomous tweets. Such hate &amp; anger!
1340194029070397440 2020-12-19 15:15:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well said, Lin!

1339566403712675840 2020-12-17 21:41:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PippaCrerar @JonAshworth Instead of blaming the government how about we all take personal responsibility and do as recommended! When I’ve been out, hardly anyone observes the 2 m rule! Our fault!
1339508929705984001 2020-12-17 17:53:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a gorgeous couple who deserved a fantastic life and lots of children. 💔💔😢
1339506257921781762 2020-12-17 17:42:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such beautiful children. ... words alone cannot convey the sorrow.. this means some of these angels died without the comfort of their mama holding them in love in last minutes... unbearably painful 😢💔💔
1339503868288315397 2020-12-17 17:33:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I bet I’m not the only one who wants to reach inside this photo and hug beautiful little Alice and keep her safe from evil awaiting her..... no words .. 😢😢💔

1339467222943752193 2020-12-17 15:07:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lewis_goodall This is the UK’s biggest national holiday of the year and people from all religions celebrate along with Christians so don’t be so divisive. It diminishes you still further.

1339193272045080577 2020-12-16 20:58:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mikegalsworthy @MarkVipond @trussliz But these countries could’ve said no.  That’s the point. A question for you: I’m assuming you are British... why have you so little faith in us all here? So very disappointing that you can’t give credit to an excellent job by #LizTruss
1339192698591440900 2020-12-16 20:56:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DuGrigore @trussliz Your life is going to be very miserable now... not thought of taking all your misery and angst somewhere else?

1339180347930636289 2020-12-16 20:07:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chapman020 We have just family and some excluded like my 90-year old mother.  She’s just not going to be here.  My sister has that pleasure! I’m actually looking forward to it.  Quiet and carols on the village green - social distancing of course!

1339142034943320064 2020-12-16 17:35:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DPJHodges I think government knows that, regardless of tough restrictions, people would ignore them over Christmas. Look how the adherrance to current regulations are going. We are not very compliant in UK - which has its +\-
1339141217003712513 2020-12-16 17:32:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JaneMichael62 Morning, Jane! x

1339136663663108096 2020-12-16 17:13:55 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CambridgeUtdFC @markbonnercufc Of course racism is unacceptable in society including football. But ‘taking the knee’ for a political party that is Marxist is deeply embarrassing. Stick with the statement read out and link arms if you want. You get your message across far more succinctly. And we’d all agree.

They have plans to centralise that too!!!  You haven’t a clue, Dickie Boy, which is why you r often blocked!
1339133738257690625 2020-12-16 17:02:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely! Knowing harming others people and yet an elected MP!

How do you feel about plans for EU to ‘centralise’ taxation? What’s the biggest crisis facing EU in the future? If you can’t answer this simple questions I’m blocking you.
1339131326159593474 2020-12-16 16:52:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TurningNot Welcome back!!!!! 👍👍

I live near one of the largest car manufacturers in UK and they are staying, having invested in road construction &amp; expansion over last 2 years. I’d like a deal but not at the cost of self governance. People didn’t vote based on CBA
1339129758811107328 2020-12-16 16:46:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Craig_A_Spencer Well until you get the second shot it won’t protect you! But why wear a mask after that?
1339129185894273026 2020-12-16 16:44:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mryorkshiretea @OldBob17 @Suffolklord @MrJingle14 @TheEnglishRebel This is why I don’t believe you run a business. Boris is not ‘caving in’ - it’s called holding your nerve until last moment when negotiating. Be prepared to walk away. Oh by the way tell German car manufacturers they won’t be hit massively if we stop buying their cars!
1339126937869045767 2020-12-16 16:35:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @confidencenac @errjustsaying Oh I didn’t realise that. It was such a huge number.  I can’t help but notice that out of fatalities amongst younger people, a disproportionate number are very fat.

It’s how much each side buys.  How much do we export &amp; import to/from  EU? Come on Dickie, I’m trying to help you here...! 🤣🤣🤣

1339120306187882496 2020-12-16 16:08:55 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @confidencenac @errjustsaying I know! It would appear those with obesity are more prone to serious symptoms... look at fatalities in US compared with healthier nations like Scandinavian/Asian ones. Not seeing so many slim people succumb unless they have underlying conditions. But I’m not an expert!
1339119199185227776 2020-12-16 16:04:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nigel_Farage @DavidJoBrexit You actually know this isn’t true which makes this narrative so disappointing. We are bound by Dublin 111 regs until 31 Dec... loopholes have been exploited by ‘immigrant chasing’ lawyers.  Legislation was only way to do it - in place now.
1339117524865196032 2020-12-16 15:57:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @errjustsaying @confidencenac I agree... a close friend of mine has her son (38 yrs old) who now has a badly damaged heart due to Covid back in March... life changing and may need transplant if he’s to survive ...
1339116931471859712 2020-12-16 15:55:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mryorkshiretea @OldBob17 @Suffolklord @MrJingle14 @TheEnglishRebel You have such low intelligence that you are unable to process simple data... embarrassing...

Don’t know whether you got the news but we are actually out of the EU and have been since 31 January! You also failed to understand why the majority who voted in referendum voted to LEAVE the EU!! Now that’s super thick!!! 🤣🤣

1339004086759415809 2020-12-16 08:27:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JamesNewbon Life is simply too short to debate with idiots. Bye!

1339002675619393537 2020-12-16 08:21:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jw56012025 I just hope he was held tightly by his mother and didn’t realise what was happening...
1339002006510460928 2020-12-16 08:18:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jw56012025 He looks like he could be related to my family.... 😢
1339001792944877569 2020-12-16 08:17:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JamesNewbon You really think that? Very naive.
1339000098597048320 2020-12-16 08:11:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well done! I am sick of people who we welcome to share our country with trying to destroy who we are. Those who embrace this land I welcome with open arms!
1338999605560741890 2020-12-16 08:09:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well said! 👏👏
1338999282460991490 2020-12-16 08:08:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JamesNewbon @benhabib6 If you believe that then there is no hope for you!
1338998120957489152 2020-12-16 08:03:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I find the daily photos heartbreaking. Every single done of them. Sometime - as with Max - it’s simply unbearable.   Such a beautiful little boy who deserved to live a full life. You live in our hearts forevermore, darling Max 💔💔
1338996842848276483 2020-12-16 07:58:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> How about making programmes people want to see?!
1338996360926928897 2020-12-16 07:56:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MirrorPolitics Of course he would and sold this country out! It would have given EU control of our laws without a seat at the table.

1338910743434047488 2020-12-16 02:16:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Brilliant job! Again!
1338910565704536065 2020-12-16 02:15:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a handsome face. Otto, we carry you in our hearts forever 💔💔💔

They are POSITIVE, have faith &amp; trust in the country and the people in it. Labour are simply the opposite. I also believe the British despise anti Semitism and politics of hate which is why Labour are unelectable
1338764995551780864 2020-12-15 16:37:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia I have faith we will emerge stronger in 2021! Stay strong and know you have support here
1338764241243951104 2020-12-15 16:34:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia And do report them too! (Not sure how many of the accounts are real too esp the anonymous ones with single digit followers)
1338763860115906561 2020-12-15 16:32:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia They are deeply damaged and Brexit seems to really get them going! When you get targeted you feel all alone but, believe me, you aren’t. You have an army of supporters out here! X
1338762603603107840 2020-12-15 16:27:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia I would also say that you have support here too! Chin up and block &amp; report!
1338762340586713088 2020-12-15 16:26:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia There are some seriously disturbed people that Twitter gives a platform to.  I had one publish a photo of me from Facebook that I thought was private! Have to say Twitter moved quickly and suspended him.
1338761714897219584 2020-12-15 16:24:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I’d love to know if men get them too! Mine are usually from men in The Gambia...!

1338750141415772160 2020-12-15 15:38:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Swevicus @Phrase2000 @terrychristian Certainly complying with laws is vital in a civilised society. If you want to change them there are ways that don’t harm others! And when you say values, do explain!
1338616142441668608 2020-12-15 06:45:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mattybooboo75 I parboil and then toss in butter and black garlic paste and then pour on warmed up tahini .... fabulous!

1338607061056294915 2020-12-15 06:09:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Heartbreaking..... 💔💔
1338576657146404867 2020-12-15 04:08:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @shannara77 @AuschwitzMuseum ThNks for letting me know. So many survivors committed suicide ...
1338572466839560192 2020-12-15 03:52:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Phrase2000 @terrychristian No. It’s the majority who completed this poll are back stabbing anti U.K. traitors.
1338572270034415620 2020-12-15 03:51:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @terrychristian Show how mistaken this poll is!!!

1338506839785435136 2020-12-14 23:31:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jw56012025 Exactly! Let him finish off the EU and then unleash him on the Civil Service (including BBC)!
1338503818749808641 2020-12-14 23:19:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Me too, Eric! This one seems to have crawled out from out of the gutter...
1338503235435421700 2020-12-14 23:16:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @tonfie @SirRogerGale Well said, Tony! Thought we’d rid the Party of these appalling MPs???
1338502621968166913 2020-12-14 23:14:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SirRogerGale If it wasn’t for the PM you wouldn’t be in government. Your lack of respect is sickening. If there is no trade deal then it won’t be OUR fault. We cannot have a deal that gives up our right to self governance. What don’t you get about that?
1338501636994592777 2020-12-14 23:10:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Do you ever stop, Liz? If anyone deserves a Dame hood it’s you!
1338501094645882885 2020-12-14 23:08:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You had a radiant smile and beautiful eyes, Helena! Your brilliance shine from your eyes! We remember you and carry you with us always 💔💔

1338408312728145922 2020-12-14 16:59:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DavidLammy Every time you open your fat mouth, poison comes out. A deal requires TWO sides (at least) to agree. It will not be a deal that gives up our ability to self governance. What’s wrong with you that you don’t understand that?
1338407806957981697 2020-12-14 16:57:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree! Shameful behaviour
1338406367875522560 2020-12-14 16:51:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Such a sweet looking young man.  How did you find yourself in the hellhole of Auschwitz?  You live in in our hearts, Henryk 💔💔

1338391560472420353 2020-12-14 15:53:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> It’s called ambition and aspiration. I wish you luck - I’m sure you will succeed!
1338260577462980609 2020-12-14 07:12:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree!
1338260102042808322 2020-12-14 07:10:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Brilliant!!
1338253947082055680 2020-12-14 06:46:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely spot on! 👏👏
1338253449029443588 2020-12-14 06:44:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @FoxxysTweets @MichaelLumb6 @RuleBrexitannia You are absolutely right. We MUST stick with this to the bitter end and avoid the international courts the EU will no doubt attempt to drag us through.... this has been brilliantly orchestrated by Gove/Frost &amp; yes, Cummings (he’s still there of course) ...
1338250950734213121 2020-12-14 06:34:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> It’s scary how some people just don’t care about us governing ourselves. Almost like they are bored
1338250044433195008 2020-12-14 06:30:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Resign!!! You’re a hypocrite and are now irrelevant! No way can you bang in about everyone wearing masks now.
1338249642388189189 2020-12-14 06:29:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> It was embarrassing - laughed my head off!!!
1338249434434576385 2020-12-14 06:28:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @piersmorgan Nobody buys that! And it doesn’t matter - your mask should’ve been on. No excuse because you wanted a chat with the paps... shameful behaviour! Resign! Now!

They are back into severe lockdown restrictions from Wednesday to 10 January.  We brexiters are not the idiots - take a look in mirror if you want to see stupid! We are focussed on the global picture!

We voted , we decided and the majority who voted were clear. Self governance. WTF people like you who keep saying how bright they are don’t get that principle is simply beyond me!
1338203149388165121 2020-12-14 03:24:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HazHasney Wishful thinking!! 😉
1338184415588077568 2020-12-14 02:10:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a lovely clever man. Your life was dedicated to curing, healing only for it to be ended by evil murderers. You deserved far better, Jakob 💔💔💔
1338183672382558208 2020-12-14 02:07:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> We mourn you, Josef 💔💔💔
1338183362431901702 2020-12-14 02:05:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Samuel, I can see you were a very dignified gentleman. Even in Norway you weren’t safe from evil. We keep you in our hearts always 💔💔
1338182637219946497 2020-12-14 02:02:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Resignation surely??!! All credibility gone! #GMB
1338182371728908288 2020-12-14 02:01:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You deserve a great break - we have so much to thank you for! 👏👏👏👏
1338182151246925826 2020-12-14 02:01:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum A young woman with her whole life ahead of her... we mourn you, Naatje 💔💔

1338168234252652545 2020-12-14 01:05:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chrissieA2 I agree about planning and there have to be controls and regulations.  It’s about balance that encourages progress and ensure there’s due process too.

1338121389518295042 2020-12-13 21:59:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Anyone see meltdown by Milliband on Marr earlier? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1338118462972043268 2020-12-13 21:47:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You are probably right!! Together with ‘identity politics’.

1338090837859766272 2020-12-13 19:58:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @prydwen3 Have faith, Gary! We have to go through the machinations and not walk away first.  Huge consequences if we do! All over by end of week. And we leave as a self governing nation!
1338090542853447681 2020-12-13 19:57:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @prydwen3 No he hasn’t! You wait and see.....😉
1338090230889541633 2020-12-13 19:55:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mentorthedragon I agree that Remain is a cult now.  Scary that so many are part of it! I had one actually suspended yesterday for the level of abuse he poured over me! Got to say Twitter moved quickly!
1338089602318524418 2020-12-13 19:53:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You always say what I think and save me so much time tweeting!! 👏👏

1338058201187627009 2020-12-13 17:48:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NorthernSun5 Businesses that deal with EU countries were given guidance a long time ago. I know this as fact. It will be bumpy for a while but, long term, worth it to have self governance.
1338056951805173761 2020-12-13 17:43:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NorthernSun5 So you really believe that? You really think we haven’t known for months how this would end?

1337924709015564288 2020-12-13 08:58:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Agree - lots of sense. Macron has elections coming and has le Pen closing fast.. this posturing from him is to do with French politics.. another reason we are right to break free

Most veterans voted for Brexit.  They didn’t see thousands of young men &amp; women die to save this country just to see it given away to EU. It is EVERYTHING they fought for.

1337832796073627648 2020-12-13 02:52:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Tobias_Ellwood You have consistently cheered for the EU over U.K. I  have no idea why you think this is acceptable behaviour. Either follow the leadership of your party or disappear into oblivion with the rest of your fellow deranged Remainers.

Humans are tribal by nature which doesn’t mean we hate other tribes/countries. I love my country with all its faults and realised that when I was away from it and saw it from afar. Nothing like coming home

They said no unless they still control our laws and right to ‘punish us’ if we break them. Also to enter our waters.  You do understand they are about to centralize tax process in Brussels for EU countries? Want that? Pensions next!

However, Hitlers big mistake was invading Russia. He didn’t appreciate harshness of Russian winter.  Ultimately it was an alliance that won the war - I know! But in the early days we stood alone ..

My mother in law came here in 1938 - also German Jew - with her parents. Evacuated to Isle of Man for 18 months. Most of rest of family perished. Nazis started way before 1938... your mother from Berlin?

But if we hadn’t stayed strong in early days Germany would’ve won in Europe. Their big mistake was taking on Russia, specifically Russian winter, so badly equipped.

It was always an unattainable ambition to have free trade arrangement AND self governance and I’m happy if we just leave and live with the fact there is a bumpy road ahead but blue skies (and the world) beyond.

1337309333600800768 2020-12-11 16:12:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @richsheff @Telegraph @LiamHalligan Interesting that Remainers still don’t understand why this country voted to leave EU. It has absolutely nothing to do with a cost benefit analysis but rather to do with self governance. Whether you agree with that is irrelevant as the majority who voted did agree.
1337308014475423744 2020-12-11 16:07:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And treacherous.  They forget the ‘British’ in their name.  Time BBC were brought into line!

1337083126250659840 2020-12-11 01:13:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I share your sentiment but we must demonstrate good faith until the dying seconds!! No come back from sly EU..
1337082728173494273 2020-12-11 01:12:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> A Labour Gvmt definitely would too and use it to leverage re-entry
1337080636067213313 2020-12-11 01:04:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> So EU still has controls over UK.  Hardly giving us the self governance that leavers voted for! Not a chance that we will go for that

1336947124043386881 2020-12-10 16:13:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DavidJoBrexit Ah, I know it’s frustrating to watch! However it’s important we don’t walk away as EU could accuse us of acting in bad faith and deaf us through international courts. They key thing to remember is that we haven’t changed our tone

1336747522405130240 2020-12-10 03:00:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Simon and Paul, your murders hurt our hearts so deeply. Sometimes it is simply unbearable to see photos... this is one of those times. 😢😢😢

You were born out of love, were loved but were killed by evil. Please G-d, you were held tightly by you mama in your final moments. We keep you in our heart. 💔💔

1336643873976803328 2020-12-09 20:08:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Just short of your 36th birthday. You look kind, intelligent and aware of what’s about to happen. We mourn you, dear, handsome Szymon 💔💔

1336641298590208007 2020-12-09 19:58:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MikeRob30186309 @Independent You look like a very aggressive &amp; angry man, Mike. I think you need to get a grip of yourself. You are an old man &amp; should know better! I think Brexit is having an effect on your ability to process information - must be a painful time for you at the moment...

1336609808519147520 2020-12-09 17:53:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Corasfancy @kelvmackenzie Burley &amp; Rigby have lost their credibility so they are incapable of doing their jobs any longer.
1336609383409717249 2020-12-09 17:51:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Corasfancy @kelvmackenzie Cummings was a private citizen too and this pair were relentless in their hounding of him and his family. They deserve to be chastised for that alone.
1336608476345344000 2020-12-09 17:47:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @GMB Interesting question. As I will get vaccinated I’m not bothered if others around me don’t.  I also believe everyone must choose for themselves.  However, if restaurants, airlines etc choose to limit their custom to only those vaccinated that, again, is their free choice.

Stalking me? just for the record, BLM are Marxist &amp; divisive, I don’t support Trump, I’m not extreme Right wing.  Something very wrong with you, Mike....
1336593178892316672 2020-12-09 16:47:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HuwpHuw @MPIainDS No, you are a liar. He meant (and you know it) the WA. If it was to include trade then why have a transition phase (which was to sort out trade)?
1336592828894490625 2020-12-09 16:45:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely spot on!
1336592494121914375 2020-12-09 16:44:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Independent Firstly, the Millwall fans were booing these idiot footballers kneeling for a divisive, Marxist political group. If they boo players of colour otherwise then I condemn that. As for the official at the Istanbul game then he needs to be punished. But action was taken.
1336582111223046145 2020-12-09 16:03:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> So much love in this photo! The only tiny comfort is they were together in their last moments. We will always remember Mietje and Florence 💔💔

I wouldn’t want this virus harming anyone including those who choose not to be vaccinated.  Therefore - for their safety - they shouldn’t go to public spaces where they infect each other
1336093810858881026 2020-12-08 07:42:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @foreignparticle @DavidLevan15 @Veritas1701 @Sky40222046 If I owned a restaurant I have every right to decide who my diners are and I would want them all to have been vaccinated. My premises so my decision. You can’t scream freedom for yourself and curtail freedom for others. Selfish.

1336085101004939266 2020-12-08 07:08:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DavidLevan15 @Veritas1701 @Sky40222046 People must not be coerced into having the vaccination- freedom of choice is essential.  But that also extends to others.  If an airline chooses to only allow you to fly if you have a vax certification - that’s their choice.  Coercion works both ways.
1336084210826833921 2020-12-08 07:04:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Veritas1701 @DavidLevan15 @Sky40222046 You have absolutely freedom to choose to have the vaccination or not but that freedom to choose also extends to airlines, restaurants and others who run spaces occupied by the public

However you have to accept that airlines have the right also to choose who flies with them. Freedom of choice doesn’t just extend to you

1335651001202782214 2020-12-07 02:23:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Agree
1335650757937336332 2020-12-07 02:22:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @silasdenyer @igeldard @adamparsons @LiveSquawk I remember that lots of downs were put forward over the last 4.5 years and still the country voted by a 80-seat majority to press ahead.
1335650424309813248 2020-12-07 02:20:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @silasdenyer @igeldard @adamparsons @LiveSquawk You don’t see anything patronising in your statement do you? Secondly we have a voting system.  If you want a different one then campaign for it but don’t bitch when the one we have already gives you a result you don’t want

The oven ready deal referred to the WA. Trade was always going to be tough. No point arguing now.  It’s done.

Her only motive was to keep U.K. as closely tied to EU as possible. She had no respect for result of referendum - an appalling PM who betrayed all of us who believe in democracy

We haven’t changed our stance by one iota but if we walk away the malicious EU could have grounds to take us to International Court saying we are in breach of WA.

1334915577987665921 2020-12-05 01:40:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Not yet three, you beautiful little darling were murdered with your mama in the gas chamber by monsters. I know she would’ve held you tightly right at the end, her love would’ve carried you into the next life. We now hold you tightly in our hearts with love ❤️💔
1334913817483079683 2020-12-05 01:33:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I look at these pics every day.  It’s so hard but it’s the least I can do to respect everyone who was murdered, including many of my mother in law’s family

By the way I’m expecting you to respond with how brilliant EU are  and how U.K. isn’t .....😉

Negotiation and blackmail are different things. One of the most important things I learnt was to walk away from a bad deal or the disingenuous
1334641511426908168 2020-12-04 07:31:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @mikeysmith And? This resentment and malice towards people with more money than you is such a deeply unattractive trait. It withers you

1334063891320594434 2020-12-02 17:16:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MrsAK2017 @gymslip @spnorris125 @MahyarTousi I’ve travelled throughout Peru and many live inter generationally.  Lots of overcrowding.  However you are right - so many anomalies. South Africa had massive crackdown and surprisingly few cases... it will be interesting to see data at end of this, including incidence v. deaths
1334061932534517760 2020-12-02 17:08:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gymslip @spnorris125 @MahyarTousi @MrsAK2017 Australia have done pretty well and they were tough on lockdowns as were South Korea, Singapore, NZ etc.
1334061130029932545 2020-12-02 17:05:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well said! Starmer has massive battles within the Labour Party &amp; is not concerned about doing the right thing for the country but rather keeping himself as Opposition leader  https://t.co/1i9wOBuFgd

1334059909554593796 2020-12-02 17:00:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @boblister_poole @tonfie All nonsense from Barnier who needs something to take back to 27 members of EU. We haven’t shifted one iota in our position for months.
1334050015589896193 2020-12-02 16:21:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum You were only 19 yrs old and were murdered just shy of your 20th birthday. We remember you with love, Chaim. 💔😢
1334048726852235267 2020-12-02 16:16:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> What a beautiful family. Let’s also remember their lives as well as their murders. At least there were survivors from the family. We mourn your passing and remember you. RIP 💔💔

1333828820487507968 2020-12-02 01:42:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme I don’t advocate long term lockdown though. I want short term pain for long term gain.  2021 is when we emerge from the shadows of EU &amp; will be a fantastic opportunity for us to be a global state. I want this virus behind us. Faffing about with it will just delay emergence
1333827562351566849 2020-12-02 01:37:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PaulMer53 @jdminiatures Most certainly! An outward global state free to make its own decisions without deferring to a foreign power!
1333826788439584772 2020-12-02 01:34:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme I don’t advocate long term lockdown. I’d say until end Jan TIer system that is fluid. I was like you until I saw my friend’s 38yr son with Covid.  It’s affected his heart and his long term survival is in the balance. I now know others who have long term issues - this isn’t flu

1333824970078687237 2020-12-02 01:27:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme I will be back in business as long as we get on top of this virus... as will others. There will be a boom 💥 once we are clear of this
1333811528039079939 2020-12-02 00:33:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme My business hasn’t earned a penny since March! We were lucky enough to get furlough  but that’s hardly touching the side.  I’ve always kept 12 months’ overhead cost put to one side but we have all suffered. BUT letting this virus run unchecked is madness!
1333780487861465091 2020-12-01 22:30:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @minky2013 I bet the O’Brien daily is thinking that there are good things about lockdown 😉
1333779643460067330 2020-12-01 22:27:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme For me it isn’t unjustified. Harsh yes but you really need to see what’s happening around the world! My business has been in furlough since April so don’t think I’m here with a smile on my face!
1333779015044276226 2020-12-01 22:24:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme Yes, Tier 3 is in lockdown and you need to ask yourself why. It isn’t the government’s fault - it is all of our fault because we didn’t follow recommendations about social distance. Sorry to sound harsh but you can’t just stamp your foot and say ‘it’s not fair!’
1333776368413368320 2020-12-01 22:14:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme Listen, I’m in Tier 3 too from Thursday and have been hugely impacted by this.  However, I seem to have a better grip on the reality of the situation than you.
1333776039101812739 2020-12-01 22:12:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TinyTon_e @sarahisitme We are not wrong. If you are happy to pass this onto family members go right ahead and kill them! We have had far less strident lockdowns than most other places ... time for you to get a grip! It’s for a few weeks only.

1333401939107786762 2020-11-30 21:26:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SimonPearson961 @DPJHodges Simon, may I ask where you are getting your evidence? What needs to be done so you have confidence to get vaccinated yourself?
1333401615894769671 2020-11-30 21:24:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ExplorerRoger @SteveBakerHW @RishiSunak His intent is malicious so if you don’t mind U will leave it there!

I do know consultants and I know they tell me that Covid is a real problem for NHS &amp; that’s before we get to the ‘danger’ months (Jan/Feb). It’s not just about deaths.

1333347486543585280 2020-11-30 17:49:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SueWhitaker11 @sandieshoes I think GE19 and he was certainly huffy! If he’d been a grown up his time would’ve come... it won’t now!
1333347005347860480 2020-11-30 17:47:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SimonPearson961 @DPJHodges I don’t think anyone is saying that the vaccine shouldn’t be tested to know the effects in the medium &amp; long term, are they? I welcome the vaccination on the assumption that’s happened. I know that’s what’s happening.
1333345153290031107 2020-11-30 17:40:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SaltyDuchess @sarahisitme @p13tobler You are right! Most frustrating as info always proves to be correct! At least we can discuss on the platform with other members.
1333343711422533634 2020-11-30 17:34:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Heartbreaking. Such a lovely family to be destroyed by hate and evil. Instead, let’s remember this family with love and carry them in our hearts . 💔💔❤️❤️
1333339472499503112 2020-11-30 17:17:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SteveBakerHW @RishiSunak Stop bringing this into public arena! All you do is bring out the anti Government grubs and give them a feast day.
1333339136904794121 2020-11-30 17:16:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sandieshoes I was once a great admirer of Baker and was surprised he was left out of the Cabinet post GE 2019.  However, I can see why now.  He’s bitter and spiteful, hence the public pile-ons we see from him constantly.

Do you realise how many sacrifices many of us have made to stop its spread? And then you state you’ve had lunch for 10!!! It is people like you that have caused this lockdown. So jaw droppingly selfish! @metpoliceuk
1333322266210398211 2020-11-30 16:09:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JohnCleese I think you should read the article again and you’ve misrepresented it here...

1333176719394680843 2020-11-30 06:31:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @p13tobler @SaltyDuchess I agree, Paul! We should be able to debate and then to agree to disagree.  I’ve been very disappointed by people who used to follow me during Brexit and then blocked me for being supportive of Boris regarding this pandemic.

1333151126070448131 2020-11-30 04:49:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LikeGoinThisWay @tonfie I would normally say celebrating someone Ed death is pretty shameful but..... I’m making an exception with this absolute piece of vermin.
1333149177711308801 2020-11-30 04:41:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Exactly! No point blaming Boris for this!
1333147641312636938 2020-11-30 04:35:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum You have the same birth name as my grandmother, beautiful Mirjam. I just pray that you had arms around you and Hugo when those awful last moments came.  We will always hold you tightly in our hearts with love 💔💔💔

1333145658375729155 2020-11-30 04:27:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @shannara77 @AuschwitzMuseum A whole family probably wiped out without a scrap of compassion or humanity. We remember you all and carry you with us always 💔💔

1333094777995337728 2020-11-30 01:05:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Sweet 16 and so beautiful. We can see the defiance in you, Zofia, and we honour your spirit and carry you in our hearts with love. 💔💔❤️❤️

I spent whole of Feb there ... family left end Oct but going back Jan. ... their lockdown was hugely restrictive.. travel banned,  corruption rife.. I despair

1333081078211489792 2020-11-30 00:11:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Neilcharles1450 @Melissa5857 @10DowningStreet My own company hasn’t brought in a penny since March- I’ve furloughed everyone. I get the suffering.  But we must ensure that Covid doesn’t overwhelm NHS in Jan/Feb.  Our lockdowns nowhere near as regulated as other countries btw... including SA
1333078945697239041 2020-11-30 00:02:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Oh Rudolf, you almost survived, young man. Your bright, handsome face shines from your photo with the promise of a wonderful future. We all mourn you and carry you in our hearts. 💔💔

I lived in J’burg and remember the men being a lot more polite and courteous.  Shame.

Which you are. But there are stupid people here (on variety of subjects) and I just block. No point.
1333076803313872898 2020-11-29 23:54:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Neilcharles1450 @Melissa5857 @10DowningStreet There are so many opinions from our so-called experts but calling people brainwashed is rude and demeans you.  Nobody listens to your argument then. So I repeat, change your tone and you might find you can enter into good debate here
1333076094011006976 2020-11-29 23:51:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Ah, you may have a point! I don’t believe Japan went into lockdown? I’m now countering my own arguments with my own! 🤔

1333071431488458752 2020-11-29 23:32:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Agree! Sweden really battling!

1333066660907978757 2020-11-29 23:13:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Salywebster @sandieshoes @JuliaHB1 And of course that is your right. However, it is also right to point out the consequences. Why did you vote for Boris?
1333064567530942465 2020-11-29 23:05:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Actually I’ve just had a look at Peru and they’ve had some of the strictest lockdown rules in world and have highest incidence in world. Mmmmm, I may be rethinking this......
1333063261122662405 2020-11-29 23:00:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Salywebster @sandieshoes @JuliaHB1 Is that Laurence Fox? You do know that by voting for him you hand a freebie to Starmer?
1333062944595316737 2020-11-29 22:59:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sandieshoes @Salywebster @JuliaHB1 Thanks! I despair with some of these comments but I put it down to stress/panic and the need to blame someone. They could, of course, start with China!
1333062361100455936 2020-11-29 22:56:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ThomasEvans1984 @ClavesDoAmaral I’ve blocked him/her.  Abusive for the sake of it.  Typical bully.
1333053240003465217 2020-11-29 22:20:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Salywebster @sandieshoes @JuliaHB1 You do know Starmer would have you all locked down indefinitely, don’t you???!!
1333052995047739393 2020-11-29 22:19:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Salywebster @sandieshoes @JuliaHB1 It in my opinion
1333052784099422208 2020-11-29 22:18:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Honestly I don’t know.  There was never going to be a perfect solution to this but all we can do is do our best. Our lockdowns were never particularly severe compared with other countries... looking at stats - Peru has fared worse...
1333051996241334272 2020-11-29 22:15:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sandieshoes @Salywebster @JuliaHB1 Yes, I agree on all points
1333051658692153345 2020-11-29 22:14:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClavesDoAmaral @ThomasEvans1984 Bye bye

They have tried very hard to be collaborative but ultimately if people act like idiots and cause harm to others they have no choice! Boris has been a lot more consensual that other countries’ leaders!
1333047661600133122 2020-11-29 21:58:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Salywebster @JuliaHB1 Oh FFS, get a grip! He’s damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t! How does having Labour in going to solve this???
1333047163014803459 2020-11-29 21:56:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JuliaHB1 I’m putting this lapse in judgement down to you being in obvious panic mode with the lockdown. Some of us cope better...

1333046063486431235 2020-11-29 21:52:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil I think it should end at end of January.  Whether it will or not is not my decision. But Jan - Feb worst stress times for NHS and by time Covid cases rise again significantly we will be into March and most of vulnerable will have been vaccinated
1333045503857205250 2020-11-29 21:49:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClavesDoAmaral @ThomasEvans1984 Nope.  You are most definitely a bully.  You resort to abuse as a first option and do not know how to debate. Leave Thomas alone - he’s entitled to his views.

I absolutely don’t agree with  enforced vaccinations so maybe only most vulnerable do get them first ... bye.
1333007721273110529 2020-11-29 19:19:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil I know and agree. My business hasn’t earned a penny since March. Friends in same position.  It’s devastating! I haven’t seen my mom since Feb (she’s 90 next week) and won’t until Spring... lockdown until end Jan ONLY... save NHS and vaccinate vulnerable
1333006570700091395 2020-11-29 19:15:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @pepelep48542643 @ChristineEasda1 @BorisJohnson I agreed with you at one time but I’ve now seen people who have had the virus ... and continue to live with its devastating impact. We can still work, keep many businesses going (although my business ground to a halt March), meet outdoors. Vaccination is only answer
1333005471729455104 2020-11-29 19:10:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @carol_hulme @JulieAdmin Interesting to see a Swedish flag flying .... 🤔
1333005187145994241 2020-11-29 19:09:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil I agree but people just don’t seem to get social distancing.  It really fell apart in summer and early autumn. The only thing to get us out of this pickle is vaccination. And quick. Quite simply we are damned either way! Happy to debate
1333003689888518146 2020-11-29 19:03:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chrissieA2 @NaomiMeeks1 @MetPolice I’ve just been blocked by a former follower for supporting the Government’s approach. Good riddance!  Brexit will get to the finish line and will be on no-deal despite all this hysteria.  I have faith!
1333002125014667264 2020-11-29 18:57:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @pepelep48542643 @ChristineEasda1 @BorisJohnson This is hugely irresponsible.  There is a pandemic and it does kill and leave people’s long term health severely impaired. Do you really think the government want to bankrupt the country? Really?
1333000745755549698 2020-11-29 18:51:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chrissieA2 @NaomiMeeks1 @MetPolice I agree Chrissie. It’s a tough call either way.  If Boris abandons lockdown and thousands are sick and die he will be called a murderer (remember March/April) and if he adheres to lockdowns he’ll be called a fascist dictator.  Who’d have his job!!!
1332999896899727360 2020-11-29 18:48:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil I could have named other countries but you will find an argument against all!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Australia has just come through its winter and it’s cold there in certain parts. And Brazil climate??????
1332999262435684354 2020-11-29 18:46:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Stop_The_EU @ChristineEasda1 What Brexit flip-flop?? Can I suggest you follow David Frost on Twitter where he makes it clear there will be no negotiation on our sovereignty...
1332998613887291392 2020-11-29 18:43:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Time for backbenchers to back their leader.  If lockdown is brought to an abrupt halt this virus will cause untold harm
1332998096545046528 2020-11-29 18:41:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @brothers1980 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Just seen your bio.  Learn to spell, thickie. 🤣🤣🤣. I’m not conversing with bullies so bye bye.
1332996153290465281 2020-11-29 18:33:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Delaying it before vaccinations are available would seem the way to go! So your argument would indicate that we haven’t been in anywhere near a lockdown situation if it’s spread like this.
1332995762192588802 2020-11-29 18:32:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClaireABell40 @WeVotedToLeave @YarlanZey @JuliaHB1 Covid is highly contagious and has an incubation period before you get symptoms.  It’s all on the app.
1332995343827529732 2020-11-29 18:30:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I agree.  But reading some of the comments here I think some people have lost all their senses!!
1332995114730463232 2020-11-29 18:29:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @YarlanZey @JuliaHB1 They are doing this because they know people will do it anyway!

1332993864005771264 2020-11-29 18:24:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrynJon18454627 @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Australia, Norway, South Korea, Singapore etc etc... the problem is that we don’t know the death toll if we hadn’t imposed lockdowns...
1332993460647960577 2020-11-29 18:23:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @brothers1980 @GElvidge821860 @afneil And don’t DARE lecture me - in my own business we’ve had no income since March but I’d rather this than be responsible for the deaths of the most vulnerable amongst us.
1332992360905584643 2020-11-29 18:18:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @brothers1980 @GElvidge821860 @afneil Glad to see that you think the lives of the most vulnerable in society are worthless! If we had collectively taken advice in the summer we wouldn’t be here now. Blame yourself!
1332991258407657472 2020-11-29 18:14:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClavesDoAmaral @ThomasEvans1984 Can you give examples? It is abusive to align someone to the Stasi without evidence. Don’t be a bully.
1332990781909557248 2020-11-29 18:12:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MartinGarside9 @GElvidge821860 @afneil We’ve had intermittent lockdowns. If people had adhered to social distancing regulations we wouldn’t be where we are. Where populations have complied they have beaten this.
1332988840873775106 2020-11-29 18:04:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @GElvidge821860 @afneil And the virus spreads and vulnerable people will die.  None of the restrictions imposed stop us going to work (apart from hospitality).  People have literally gone mental with conspiracy theories!
1332988273808068610 2020-11-29 18:02:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> No way for a dignified old man to leave this world.  Let’s remember his life with love 💔❤️

1332986982939697153 2020-11-29 17:57:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @P4triQt @JJB20201 Interesting to see all the conspiracy theorists here. Think Covid has resulted in some people simply losing their minds!
1332986552574758913 2020-11-29 17:55:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Exactly! I think certain sections of the community have actually gone bonkers with their conspiracy theories.
1332984965055836160 2020-11-29 17:49:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Liberated! However, the acts of evil he saw must’ve scarred him for life. How do you get over that? Nevertheless he survived to tell his story &amp; let’s hope he went on to live a good life with love in it ❤️❤️
1332983814906318848 2020-11-29 17:44:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I agree and worry for US over next 4 yrs - and rest of world (which country will they go to war with?). However, Dems have this sown up now although the stench of corruption will linger over their term in office. No doubt.
1332982986900463620 2020-11-29 17:41:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Zobyismyname No, Biden will be installed as next President. If Covid hasn’t happened Trump would’ve made second term.
1332982301018501120 2020-11-29 17:38:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gordorfc1 @Bull_Spotter My ex husband lives in Sweden so getting news from our sons.  Deaths are low because they are healthy compared to us.  However, nobody is talking about the long term effects of this virus.  Again, compared to Norway, Finland, Sweden are doing badly. Very.
1332835738732335106 2020-11-29 07:56:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @VicVA2 More like a mass exodus to England once they get a reality check!

1332832711044689921 2020-11-29 07:44:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @tvmisshelenp Helen, this is worldwide... this isn’t something invented by the Tories...
1332832489388302336 2020-11-29 07:43:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I know what you mean but I think people’s mental state has been adversely impacted by the pandemic and they are not thinking rationally...
1332792022361665537 2020-11-29 05:02:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gordorfc1 @Bull_Spotter They are healthier than us in U.K.  not so many fatsos which makes a huge difference. But rates have soared!!! They are in trouble right now!
1332791615698694150 2020-11-29 05:00:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Bull_Spotter @sarahisitme Totally correct and by a long, long way.  They are seriously battling right now!

1332790899139600385 2020-11-29 04:58:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @penninehiker @allisonpearson They most certainly do! My friends son (38 yrs old)caught it March and is now suffering with life threatening heart problems. Let that sink in whilst selfish people whine about not being able to go to the pub!!
1332789993002180612 2020-11-29 04:54:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @allisonpearson For heaven’s sake! Students don’t just spread this virus amongst themselves! What spoilt babies we are that we can’t behave like responsible citizens for a few months!
1332789221535469568 2020-11-29 04:51:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Rebeccayoung94 You know what, Rebecca, he is blessed as he has a daughter who obviously loves him to bits! Sod his ex employers and give your dad a hug - he’s a rich man!
1332788771260084227 2020-11-29 04:49:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Hendo_ayes @Rebeccayoung94 And the worst thing about Twitter is it gives vicious nasties like you a platform to spread your venom. I will put this down to the probability that you come from a broken home and nobody loves you.
1332787900812029952 2020-11-29 04:46:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well said, Warren! Doesn’t matter how old you get, your daddy is always your daddy...

1332641909362323457 2020-11-28 19:06:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @simondolan I disagree. Only thing I can see is we can’t socialise with others. You are aware that there’s far more stringent lockdowns elsewhere???
1332641268015517696 2020-11-28 19:03:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TrevorLess Go foe breakfast the the restaurant and then set off al fire alarms and FIRE! About 20 mins before planes due to strike!!

1332467065274429440 2020-11-28 07:31:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Now that Biden is going to be next POTUS, Iran will get support from US for it’s nuclear programme - utter madness!

Iran are the biggest state sponsors of terrorism and I have no clue why the West supported their nuclear programme. A Biden administration will support it again hence Mossad doing their magic today.

I’m not going to be rude to you and perfectly understand why. There has been a second wave? How do I know? Consultant friends in hospitals have told me.  So believe what you want but this pandemic IMO is real.
1332244048254525442 2020-11-27 16:45:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PaulBat58261673 @BlueArmyFaction @fearty_guts @DamianGreen Ummmmmm. Shops can now open in all tiers.  We can all work although hospitality is hard hit.  If we’d all heeded advice we wouldn’t be in this position so have only ourselves to blame.  FYI I own my own business and had no income since March apart from furlough.
1332226498661666817 2020-11-27 15:35:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @KeyserSosse We remember you, Sheldon RIP 💔💔
1332109192740675585 2020-11-27 07:49:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ProfKarolSikora @bulldog_spirit1 I think that will come but we need to keep it simple so everyone gets it and then make adjustments.
1332108824627515395 2020-11-27 07:47:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @paulderby11 @C53758546Mandy People need to get a grip. Older generations went through a lot worse and all we have to do is stay home. We can still go to work, school, uni.  Get our hair and nails done. Shop and spend time walking. No bombs are falling on us, food isn’t rationed &amp; we have Netflix!
1332105955761410051 2020-11-27 07:36:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @confidencenac @simondolan @ShineOnSilver Well said, Nadia.  👏👏
1332104226026246145 2020-11-27 07:29:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BlueArmyFaction @fearty_guts @DamianGreen We aren’t hiding. Work, school, universities still go on. Trade still goes on. Shopping too! The only thing that is in lockdown is our social lives.  I have personal experience of what this virus can do so a little more care for your fellow citizens wouldn’t go amiss!
1332101334376587266 2020-11-27 07:18:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BlueArmyFaction @fearty_guts @DamianGreen Lockdowns have worked - when people adhere to them. We have soft lockdowns compared to other countries but this will be tougher. If we want to get rid of this virus we need to stop it spreading which means keeping our distance from each other! That simple!
1332100491602432001 2020-11-27 07:14:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BlueArmyFaction @DamianGreen Oh please, do me a favour!! This pandemic is worldwide and we have one of the least restrictive lockdowns! Hospitals are getting stretched now and we must ensure we keep numbers of patients down!
1332099989993099265 2020-11-27 07:12:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @FKGPML @DamianGreen @Sue36650435 I also run a business and we have had no income since March (apart from furlough).  BUT I am also a citizen who thinks it’s vital that we protect people, particularly most vulnerable. You don’t know what would’ve happened without lockdown.  Look at Sweden now!!

1331998816254484483 2020-11-27 00:30:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NikonShooterUK @RuleBrexitannia They are the ONLY Party who have got Brexit done and properly. Just for that they get my vote! Maybe you need to take your own advice?
1331973044986900481 2020-11-26 22:48:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree! We kinda knew that the usual suspects would stage something like this, didn’t we! 😂😉

This country deserves better than a media whose intent is so malicious towards our country. Sometimes it’s like they are war with us!
1331970344425578504 2020-11-26 22:37:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia I would still vote for Boris. Nothing has changed except this pandemic and other countries have same battles as is and many have much stricter lockdowns.

1331929150614073348 2020-11-26 19:53:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LordGenome @carolecadwalla @skirchy You have to understand that decent people’s lives are destroyed by the likes of this woman.  She usually gets away with it so do excuse us whilst we celebrate a win for truth (although I’m not a fan of Banks). People no longer trust the media and this is why. So sad.
1331927740514234373 2020-11-26 19:48:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> That has got to hurt!

I would love to have a trustworthy media that holds politicians to account especially with such a feeble Opposition Party that are now irrelevant.

1331544560292548608 2020-11-25 18:25:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum What a beautiful boy you were, Joseph.  I want to reach into the photo and hold you tight and save you.

1331539506479161346 2020-11-25 18:05:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @papaluigi20 @DQStuff @MartinDaubney @jordanbpeterson I know what free speech is! Staff can say they don’t like the book, disagree with its content but they cannot try to stop the shop selling the book. That is censorship! Why is this so hard to understand?
1331534604461879296 2020-11-25 17:46:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @morris1_k @MartinDaubney @jordanbpeterson Your perogative.  I’ve been to one of his lectures (Oxford) and was genuinely inspired.  However, I support the right of others to disagree with him but NOT to shut him down.
1331532698700165121 2020-11-25 17:38:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DQStuff @MartinDaubney @jordanbpeterson They don’t have the right to shut down free speech. I don’t care how much you disagree with a position someone takes, you must not stop it. Who are you to decide? Can you not see where this paths leads?

1331523895090941953 2020-11-25 17:03:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gingerburn @MartinDaubney My decision to vote Brexit wasn’t taken lightly. Much research, debate and I did so (initially) reluctantly. However, for the long term health of our nation, it was the right decision. The vast majority of the establishment was ‘remain’ so this vote was incredible! Brilliant!
1331522830769524739 2020-11-25 16:59:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @kelvmackenzie Major is a sinister figure and played a huge part in attempting to create a United States of Europe.  I don’t think he gave a toss about losing to Blair who was on the same page as him.....

1331513602856144896 2020-11-25 16:22:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gingerburn @MartinDaubney IMB was a smart move that blindsided EU beautifully. I realise you are a Remainer so I sympathise with how you must be feeling right now. You will see for yourself

1331372684689739778 2020-11-25 07:02:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @kazbahellis They don’t need to microchip us to spy on us. This whole process needs to be done by consensus and collaboration and I believe Boris gets that.
1331371746688167937 2020-11-25 06:58:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @UnwokenMan @kazbahellis There has always been anti-vaxxers throughout history. Nobody has ever been forced to vaccinate.  However, we cannot legislate for other countries who may demand proof of vaccination before you are allowed entry.  Their rules which we have no say over

1331239770094186498 2020-11-24 22:14:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarcherLord1 @jonny2107 Totally agree. I despite the phrase (always said in a whiny voice) ‘it’s not fair!’. Life isn’t fair - get over it!
1331239114927190017 2020-11-24 22:11:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MartinDaubney Sovereignty is the main reason people voted for Brexit - ability to make our own decisions unilaterally. However, if WE decide to retake our fishing over a phased time (say 3 years) then I see no problem with that if the benefits are good for us.  Please don’t rattle cages!!
1331238471512576006 2020-11-24 22:09:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Exactly!

1331170132559851522 2020-11-24 17:37:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gogsy2020 Then he needs to be investigated and if found guilty not only thrown out of the party but arrested.  That simple.
1331166565341990920 2020-11-24 17:23:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gogsy2020 And Blackford???

1331154902186397697 2020-11-24 16:37:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely!!
1331154817000099843 2020-11-24 16:36:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gogsy2020 I don’t think it’s fraud at all.  I think it was incompetence on behalf of the procurement managers of NHS.  Fraud is a criminal act and if you are accusing the Gvmt then individuals would’ve profited. I’m not seeing that.

I think freedom of speech is paramount and people like you with a problem with that are the biggest threat to a civilised society. Even if you don’t like what people say, suck it up.

1330876418109169666 2020-11-23 22:10:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Oh what a dear, dear man. We remember you with love, Rudolf 😢😢💔💔
1330860677788033026 2020-11-23 21:08:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I think he expected to be in Cabinet after GE... 🤔
1330806040833757189 2020-11-23 17:30:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AnnSilvers @Suffragentleman Definitely does happen! My son was abused for 8 years - eventually escaped after she’d stabbed him (not fatally thank God). Intervention from family &amp; friends.  Police were actually excellent!
1330796033564086272 2020-11-23 16:51:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @kelvmackenzie And when given 2 jabs it’s 90% effective. Important to state that. And is effective for much longer than the Pfizer version.
1330791482341666816 2020-11-23 16:33:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such kindness shining from your lovely eyes.  We remember you with love in our hearts 💔💔💔

1330786041687662592 2020-11-23 16:11:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Such a shame as I did enjoy this station once upon a time. they must be losing listeners in their droves!
1330785735264309250 2020-11-23 16:10:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nilpoints1 @ASK_des You’re not condemning her?
1330785424244174850 2020-11-23 16:09:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nilpoints1 @ASK_des I’m not absolving her but Home Office well known for being run by older Oxbridge white men with their own agenda. I get that she was frustrated by their lack of cooperation but she’s taken steps to rectify her behaviour - not everything is career breaking!
1330784248022831104 2020-11-23 16:04:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Such a gorgeous boy with your curly hair, Siegfried. I hope you were being held close by your mama in those last horrifying moments 💔💔💔
1330783601747775488 2020-11-23 16:01:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nilpoints1 @ASK_des So you are condemning her without the facts? 🤔
1330781386186305536 2020-11-23 15:53:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nilpoints1 @ASK_des Look at BBC website - the summary is there
1330780743874842626 2020-11-23 15:50:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @shannara77 @AuschwitzMuseum A brave man. We remember you Father. 💔💔💔
1330779980817641472 2020-11-23 15:47:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Heartbreaking 💔💔💔
1330777907585818625 2020-11-23 15:39:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nilpoints1 @ASK_des In employment law, if you feel bullied it means you are. The report also said it was unintentional and she’d been provoked. She’s completed all the steps needed in cases like this.  Shouting at obstructive employees isn’t a career ending action.
1330776365218603009 2020-11-23 15:33:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SlawekRetmaniak @AuschwitzMuseum I know history

1330667477139910658 2020-11-23 08:20:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Well said, Mark!

1330666653839921152 2020-11-23 08:17:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PlanetofFinks @JohnCleese That’s actually not true, man. He is a comic genius and will be remembered long after you are mere dust... sorry to spell it out to you, man.

1330660627048751106 2020-11-23 07:53:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BieberDmorison @JohnNemoBell I would take Liam’s analysis before yours. He’s extremely astute and knows what he’s talking about.
1330660349784289280 2020-11-23 07:52:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely! 👏👏👏
1330659465037746177 2020-11-23 07:48:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PiePony1 @Mike_Fabricant @sarahisitme You do realise that to vote for anyone other than Conservatives means a hard left LP runs the country? You do realise that it was the Tories that have made Brexit happen?
1330658067264966658 2020-11-23 07:43:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @smurph64 @AuschwitzMuseum @IdellGabriel What is so shameful about this comment is that you didn’t mourn and acknowledge the murders of this poor family but used it to make some cheap political point. Where is the humanity in you?
1330656979824631810 2020-11-23 07:38:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum I hope the family were all together in those terrible, heart-wrenching last moments. We remember you all and carry you in our hearts forever. 😢💔

1330653646862815235 2020-11-23 07:25:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I think we know the answer..... 🤔
1330644825708912642 2020-11-23 06:50:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> She looks like a total nut job!! It’s scary that these people walk amongst us!
1330644548406697984 2020-11-23 06:49:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @minky2013 @Mikey1732 Particularly the closer we get to 31 December!
1330644343296811013 2020-11-23 06:48:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mikey1732 @Macetrain I just checked this person and she follows that leftie loon David Schneider @davidschneider ... that is the big clue to block! 😂
1330643617178914821 2020-11-23 06:45:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @davidschneider Would love to hear your views on the anti Semitism in Labour Party? Don’t seem to be able to see your comments on the report.... maybe I’m missing something here.
1330641763946655746 2020-11-23 06:38:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum The good thing is that the Germans kept records which meant that the guilty could be held accountable.  Each of the Germans should’ve been tried and prosecuted for murder and hung.
1330641110289539072 2020-11-23 06:35:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JennyWensing worthwhile reading for you... 🤔

1330612587176857610 2020-11-23 04:42:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LizzieAllen1 @AnnieMacF2 Yes, he reminded me of Len too and knows his stuff around ballroom.  Surely they need to have 4 judges again?!
1330610652210212868 2020-11-23 04:34:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 weeping here 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1330610379559489537 2020-11-23 04:33:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Let Anton be a permanent judge! King of ballroom!
1330610043969032193 2020-11-23 04:32:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And for the final! Love Anton!
1330609914478256130 2020-11-23 04:31:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> How about 4 judges as  we normally have?! Anton is fantastic!!
1330609594050211842 2020-11-23 04:30:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Me too! Reminded me of the best days when Len was a judge!
1330609014154141696 2020-11-23 04:28:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbcstrictly @quentyquestions @jojo_radebe I just don’t think they liked each other!! More importantly why aren’t you keeping Anton as a judge?!!!!! He has been brilliant!!!
1330608352838217729 2020-11-23 04:25:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gogsy2020 I think they had to act very quickly &amp; the long processes had to be swept aside... prove that money went into individual MPs’ pockets and I’d have issue with that. Btw, a lot of PPE last much longer than 3 yrs and I’d rather that than have our frontline people die due to process
1330596725548077062 2020-11-23 03:39:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> She was spot on!!! Why the fuss???!!!!
1330594624080056322 2020-11-23 03:30:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @spectator @afneil 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 how far do they think The Dom has gone...?????!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1330594300871192576 2020-11-23 03:29:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @boblister_poole At a time of national emergency to have this ghoul threaten strike action is disgusting.... won’t get public support that’s for sure!
1330593487352459264 2020-11-23 03:26:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gogsy2020 Oh this is brilliant that we have 5 years stock! Wow! This will ensure we are well prepared next time and there will be a next time. I don’t believe contracts are now placed without due process.  It was done over a short time to ensure lives were saved.
1330573855786737665 2020-11-23 02:08:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You have a sparkle about you and I’m so sorry your life was abruptly ended by a country led by a monster who shared your birth name. We remember you, darling man 💔💔💔💔
1330572809467285505 2020-11-23 02:04:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> We remember you, dear clever Witold 💔💔💔
1330572444948721666 2020-11-23 02:02:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SmartBusSol He’s just another grub who is very bitter about Brexit! Hope Priti sues him for ‘bullying’ .... now wouldn’t that be fabulous?! 😉
1330572043633504256 2020-11-23 02:01:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ThatTimWalker Accusing Patel’s staff of being drunks could be described as ‘bullying’ and also quite libelous...: I mean it could hurt their feelings ...
1330570205442007044 2020-11-23 01:53:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And also very stupid... just to think she went to a top girls’ grammar school 🤔

1330540932345831424 2020-11-22 23:57:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lottie57026481 @LoyalDefender2K I certainly voted for that, Lottie! However, where we differ is Boris taking us down path of global NWO.  He wouldn’t have got us out of EU ....
1330540313576927234 2020-11-22 23:55:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Scotlandteam @BTMurrayfield Good to see that anti racism statement read and no players knelt! Learn, England, learn!
1330492336661540868 2020-11-22 20:44:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum You lived for only 11 years and were brutally murdered just shy of your 12th birthday, beautiful Suzanne. I pray someone held you close in your final moments. Your memory lives on. 😢💔

1330491321614807042 2020-11-22 20:40:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Eastwood1A1 @montie @BorisJohnson Alan, I will apologise to you too if I’m wrong and will demonstrate ferociously against. The Party will also lose my vote forever. But what I see is going through the process. I prefer some kind of deal but not at the cost of our sovereignty!
1330490592279846912 2020-11-22 20:37:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree.
1330490479058837505 2020-11-22 20:37:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MartinDaubney @Richcanvas This devalues and disrespects every single life lost in Auschwitz.  I’m appalled! As awful as Floyd’s death was (btw, have we had the autopsy yet????) it has absolutely nothing to do with the Holocaust.
1330489852715020290 2020-11-22 20:34:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AlastairJT Astonishing but not! This cancer is just not going away!

1330487715947835394 2020-11-22 20:26:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Another Dom project? 😉
1330487441548075008 2020-11-22 20:24:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> These were extraordinary circumstances and the proof is in the pudding.  We didn’t run out of PPE!

That vermin, Naz Shah, commenting that white girl victims should keep their mouths shut and here we are! On the front bench! Just open your eyes &amp; ears!

I know first hand she’s been in overdrive to get the report published but has been stalled. Find it amazing that you support a bunch of privileged, entitled civil servants .. 🤔
1330476187827773440 2020-11-22 19:40:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Sounds like he was ‘blaming’ EU

I now run my own business and have had to be firm on occasion. But I always remember what it felt like to be bullied. According to employment law to ‘feel’ bullied means you are.

1330448264068554754 2020-11-22 17:49:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree. This faux outrage by the hard left is jaw dropping!
1330445519819317250 2020-11-22 17:38:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Agree. It’s painful to see the faces and read about the lives of those who were murdered but it’s the least we can do to honour their memory

1330304279287132163 2020-11-22 08:17:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum I love the determination and defiance in her face! Zodia survived! ❤️

1330270625596837893 2020-11-22 06:03:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @another_jan Oh let’s do!!! Who was that?!

1330254373428060165 2020-11-22 04:58:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbcstrictly well, Anton is a revelation! A HUGE improvement on Mabusi - evoking memories of Len and with the same level of knowledge! He must continue as a judge!
1330225886755491851 2020-11-22 03:05:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ayesure2 @AuschwitzMuseum Absolutely! But I think we have to be vigilant about the monsters (dormant maybe) who already live amongst us with a facade of normality...
1330225091611910152 2020-11-22 03:02:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ayesure2 @AuschwitzMuseum I think Auschwitz (and other death camps like it) stepped outside that parameter...

Kneeling down to support an organisation that spews hate and diversity isn’t about bringing communities together. As for rugby, I’m a debenture holder &amp; have watched England all over the world.

1330198104289779712 2020-11-22 01:15:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You know why? Because she is decent despite the vile racism she’s faced time after time! #standwithPriti
1330196671888756737 2020-11-22 01:09:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MattMantle @ASK_des That’s right! So all the shot you are listening to is what the #ScumMedia are feeding you!

1330192205802336261 2020-11-22 00:51:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LoyalDefender2K Just watched England v Ireland rugby match. Horrified to see some England players kneeling but none of Ireland players. Discovered my Irish granddad at that moment!
1330191354476048384 2020-11-22 00:48:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ayesure2 @AuschwitzMuseum I understand what you are saying and I would say that applies to the general population of Germany BUT not to those who saw with their own eyes the abhorrence &amp; evil within the camp.
1330189629887303683 2020-11-22 00:41:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MattMantle @ASK_des Have you read the report..?

1330177070199164933 2020-11-21 23:51:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I’ve listened to him (masochistic need to hurt my ears from time to time) and he’s extremely rude and bullies anyone who disagrees with him!
1330174918915477510 2020-11-21 23:43:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And that’s why I’m now following you, Steve!

1330173994159529988 2020-11-21 23:39:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> 👏👏 wonder if BBC will mention this..?

1330172796547248129 2020-11-21 23:34:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SpecialOpsPig With a spot of the Yorkshire Ripper popped in for good measure! (Keeping it topical 😉)

1330172140793044992 2020-11-21 23:32:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rec777777 @JonAshworth And she lost her temper because staff were being obstructive in producing report into grooming gangs.... who can blame her?
1330171625648558081 2020-11-21 23:30:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JonAshworth I think I know why you are ganging up against Priti. Could it be because she was cross about the lack of co-operation from HO with regard to the report into grooming gangs? Let’s face it, that’s not good news for Labour councillors and on top of report of AS in your Party..? 🤔
1330170285379760135 2020-11-21 23:24:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Carti_Mandua @glennbeck @SidneyPowell1 Will do... I’m coming from this with a definite lack of knowledge and difficult to circumnavigate as so much conflicting information...,. I just want a proven fair election whoever wins.
1330169476244008963 2020-11-21 23:21:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CatharineHoey @pritipatel What nobody is asking is what inflamed Priti to get angry? I believe it was about the lack of progress with publishing the report on grooming gangs.  I know this is close to Priti’s heart and I know Labour will not necessarily want to see it published....?
1330168174076190728 2020-11-21 23:16:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @glennbeck @Carti_Mandua @SidneyPowell1 You simply must present proof and quickly.  I’m hoping this isn’t sour grapes by Trump’s side and delaying tactics.  If Biden won fairly and squarely (and you must PROVE he didn’t) then time to step aside with dignity.
1330167310208954371 2020-11-21 23:12:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ASK_des Oh I don’t listen anymore - just nasty presenters who have the bare faced nerve to accuse Priti Patel of bullying when most of them are guilty of that with listeners on a daily basis!
1330166824152027140 2020-11-21 23:10:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @dannypgh @MNMockingbird @jppffyukio @AuschwitzMuseum Oh I thought you had proof... not allegations. By the way, I went into hospital some years ago with same and had same procedure without consent ... in English Hospital... just saying. So give me something proven, evidence and I will support you.

1330162073360355328 2020-11-21 22:52:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Wales suffered their sixth straight defeat last weekend; their worst run for eight years. Can they stop the rot when they host @GeorgianRugby?

1330139639693406211 2020-11-21 21:22:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MartinRobson66 @AuschwitzMuseum My mother in law came to U.K. as a 5 year old  in 1938 from Berlin as a young Jewish child.  So many of her family perished in Auschwitz... my own kids have visited but I just can’t bring myself to do it yet.....

They saw extreme cruelty on a day to day basis and went home to enjoy family time, laughing and joking. It should also be remembered that it wasn’t just Jews who were murdered in Auschwitz so any argument that they’d been brainwashed doesn’t hold true

1330091709498347521 2020-11-21 18:12:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TiredMamaTalkin @zarahsultana An interesting debate.  However, I would like to see and hear moderate Muslims strongly condemn the barbaric murders carried out in France (and elsewhere) in the name of Allah.... and unequivocally without the usual ‘whatabouterry’ ...

This is bullying &amp; intimidation. And as you know if I ‘feel’ bullied then that means I am. Btw, only a summary of the report has been published which you obviously haven’t read. If you contact me again, I’m reporting you.
1330088452373819394 2020-11-21 17:59:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @astroehlein I truly believe that only a monster would witness &amp; work in Auschwitz and live an ordinary life.
1330087496538066944 2020-11-21 17:55:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jppffyukio @AuschwitzMuseum There is absolutely no way that you can align Trump supporters with SS workers from Auschwitz.  What you do is devalue &amp; disrespect the lives lost in Auschwitz. Can we stay on topic please?
1330083979131826180 2020-11-21 17:41:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum I have thought long and hard about this.  I’ve finally concluded they were, indeed, sadistic and cruel monsters who looked ordinary. Like many serial killers like Ted Bundy. Your behaviour overrides your words to define your character.
1330082278081490944 2020-11-21 17:35:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @toryboypierce He hasn’t rejected it! And let’s read report first and put everything into context. It is PM’s job to decide based on findings.
1330081710059491333 2020-11-21 17:32:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And would’ve served in his Cabinet as a loyal lieutenant.  Do we really think the report into AS would’ve happened if Corbyn had won GE?

1329972892998709258 2020-11-21 10:20:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Sky is now irrelevant.  Sweaty Sam has no credibility.
1329971592366084096 2020-11-21 10:15:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DeborahMeaden @beaulieuonnp 🤣🤣🤣🤣 have you seen how you speak to people? Could you comment have anything to do with you being a die hard Remainer?

1329965608096698374 2020-11-21 09:51:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @supernaturalbro @twitch_valientt @LBC @clivebull I’m demonstrating double standards. I think it’s because she’s a woman - I’m guessing if a man had laid the law down it would be a different matter..
1329965056973541376 2020-11-21 09:49:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Of course they weren’t because he was a man!
1329964888979103748 2020-11-21 09:48:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You are absolutely right! If anything I suspect she was treated badly - HO are notorious for it!

1329962706456227844 2020-11-21 09:39:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Keir_Starmer Once the report into AS in Labour Party is questioned in the chamber and scrutinised...!
1329962412397760518 2020-11-21 09:38:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Keir_Starmer You plank! You’ve got Corbyn reinstated, got on your front bench a woman who said white girls who were victims of grooming gangs should shut their mouths, Raynor who shouted ‘scum’ at a Tory MP in chamber and all the while a damning report into anti Semitism on your desk! STFU!
1329961460974424066 2020-11-21 09:34:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @supernaturalbro @LBC @clivebull No she wouldn’t. I’m dealing with a case where someone is claiming to be bullied. If you ‘feel’ bullied then you are bullied. As long as there’s no intent and they agree to undergo training and apologise this isn’t career ending behaviour.
1329960960518479879 2020-11-21 09:32:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> 🇮🇪 @Irish Rugby has managed four wins at Twickenham since the turn of the century. Will the men in green beat @EnglandRugby in their own backyard?
1329933861086748674 2020-11-21 07:45:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> So sad as he nearly made it to the end. We remember you Lipka 💔💔💔
1329933479551889409 2020-11-21 07:43:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @zarahsultana Maybe have a word with your fellow Muslims and ask what they can do to resolve the slaughter of French citizens in their name? Maybe a good starting point
1329902766953816067 2020-11-21 05:41:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Exactly!
1329902622808092674 2020-11-21 05:41:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MrMisunderstood @0_politics2 Or Trump is more lethal on the outside?

1329873540452134913 2020-11-21 03:45:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Exactly! Also die-hard Remainers! Entitled and arrogant too by all accounts. Dom will be back to purge, I’m sure! 😉
1329861189703266306 2020-11-21 02:56:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Fiona82211734 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @pritipatel Blame bloody Toxic Theresa! She did her best to keep us attached to EU so give Boris his due that we are almost there with Brexit.  This is a very different team in no. 10 since Boris at helm... I’m loving it! If I’m wrong do give me a good ribbing in January!
1329860484422656008 2020-11-21 02:53:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AngusTheDog3 Followed! And thank you! She had a hell of a job to turn round and they forgot who is boss!
1329860082272792580 2020-11-21 02:52:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbclaurak Good! Another pen pusher gone! I suggest you read the report before commenting further....
1329859579375718400 2020-11-21 02:50:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Fiona82211734 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @pritipatel The problem is we had signed up to the Dublin 111 regulation which means we MUST take these people in. They then claim asylum and then the long process starts. Suggest you look at the new immigration laws and you might be pleasantly surprised! Have faith! 😉
1329859114516828160 2020-11-21 02:48:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Thanks for that.  Some of the crap I’ve taken for my comment is unbelievable! I’ve either blocked and when it got bad I have reported!

1329795651031412738 2020-11-20 22:36:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Richard65804619 I was going to say champagne but our cellar is full of English champagne, Nyetimber! So no, nothing!

1329794736912289792 2020-11-20 22:32:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak Oh please! The HO is notorious for hounding &amp; driving out Rudd! I’ve met her and can tell you she wouldn’t intentionally bully.  She is direct &amp; forceful but I guess in a woman they are bullying traits, right?
1329782597946380289 2020-11-20 21:44:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Hierotochan @belgiankev @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak Just seen your bio and level of your tweets so will say a find farewell as there is nothing I wish to discuss with you.
1329782093413552130 2020-11-20 21:42:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Hierotochan @belgiankev @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak Oh yes it does!! Fascist exists when far right and far left doctrines meet.
1329781806569304064 2020-11-20 21:41:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @confidencenac I’m dealing with someone being accused of bullying in a work situation.  Apparently if you ‘feel’ bullied then you are.  It’s a tricky one. As she’s said sorry, her intent was not to bully and she’s undergone training that should be the end to it.
1329780613126221825 2020-11-20 21:36:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1329780425003294721 2020-11-20 21:35:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree.  I’ve crossed paths with her and she’s lovely! Smart, strong and determined! She’s very aware she’s got a job to do and having staff who are obstructive wasn’t going to go well!!
1329779654492889088 2020-11-20 21:32:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And whilst they’ve still got Corbyn hanging around like a bad smell I’d have thought silence was their best option
1329778997757095937 2020-11-20 21:29:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @belgiankev @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak The good thing about hard left fascists like you is that your mindless idiot followers like any comment which means I can just block away! Thanks!

1329773167624278017 2020-11-20 21:06:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ItCorbyn @bbclaurak I think you need to read the report! Civil servants in Home Office were obstructive around their elected minister - ie prevented her from doing what she was elected to do. She lost her rag a few times (understandable) and got accused of bullying. She hasn’t failed!
1329771281051492353 2020-11-20 20:59:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> 👏👏👏👏

The private sector has taken an enormous hit and this country should rally together right now rather than listen to opportunistic politicians like you score points. Shameful!

1329765617189138435 2020-11-20 20:36:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrexitHome Anyone thinks just Germany &amp; France run EU and rest are the bitch poodles doing as they are told??? 🤔 and Macron should know that using blackmail isn’t the way to go with U.K.!
1329764816668536834 2020-11-20 20:33:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Berumster I did a networking zoom at 6.45 am and went back to bed afterwards.. chill day now!
1329764566927085568 2020-11-20 20:32:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> It’s all a plan to derail our government.  Blatant anti British narrative from #DefundTheBBC

Why not see what happens post 31 Dec before castigating her? She’s been truly set up here and I, for one, stand firmly in her corner. We all should who want a proper immigration policy!
1329747717367721984 2020-11-20 19:25:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Vicster1234 @armybrat53 @OutragedMary @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @w1mav @pritipatel absolute rubbish! They HAD to accept them (we signed up to Dublin 111 regulation - read it) and ‘immigrant chasing’ lawyers exploited loopholes. Those loopholes have now been sorted and new immigration laws in place.  Instead of criticising, read new regs.
1329746701784150016 2020-11-20 19:21:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @WinifredLovatt @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @pritipatel That is exactly what is happening! But it takes time and determination (which is why certain people wanted to stop Priti) to pass laws. We had no alternative but to give shelter to illegal entry but that will change - you see 😉
1329746067827662851 2020-11-20 19:19:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LordLuc46142161 @Stevebi27465893 @gbfort48 @kelvmackenzie As for history I know it if both sides of my family.  I neither want to murder German children for the sins of their forefathers and nor do I want to murder the children of the Brits for the sins of their forefathers. Is that something to be ashamed of? Really?
1329745550003015687 2020-11-20 19:16:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LordLuc46142161 @Stevebi27465893 @gbfort48 @kelvmackenzie Some of my family are Jewish - many died in Auschwitz - they don’t have hate in their hearts that people like you have.  Nothing - I repeat nothing - justifies what IRA did.  Shame on anyone who defends it. It’s not about being a Brit but being a human being who values life.
1329744424897830917 2020-11-20 19:12:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Poor Abraham. We mourn your passing, remember you and carry you in our hearts... 💔💔💔

We couldn’t reject the immigrants arriving here (thanks Toxic Theresa for that!)  but scattering them all over would have been a nightmare when the time comes to regather and ship out... you watch!
1329739608276529153 2020-11-20 18:53:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DrHelenMac @steviexdavis @SocialM85897394 Public sector used to be the poor relations which is why they were given super pensions.  That has rapidly changed over the decades. Nurses, teachers and doctors have still had pay rises - I know from personal experience.
1329738174650789889 2020-11-20 18:47:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @0_politics2 Yes, you are probably right! And then Harris!

Or do you think we should’ve just taken weeks to go through procurement regs???? Really?

1328991325568557062 2020-11-18 17:19:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Simontoonarmy @paulwaugh Starmer served on Corbyn’s shadow cabinet &amp; campaigned foe him to be PM. He’s part of the problem &amp; I’m amazed at everyone’s short memories on this. Don’t let this hard leftie in a smart suit fool you 😉
1328989636186804225 2020-11-18 17:13:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Agree but I don’t criticise PM for following protocol. Damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t ....

Of course due process wasn’t followed in the scramble (with other countries). In the event, we didn’t run out of PPE so thanks to everyone who helped regardless of connections.

1328800118041145345 2020-11-18 04:40:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JewishLabour Why is there still  Jewish Labour Movement???
1328799753564524545 2020-11-18 04:38:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarcusRashford I agree and would ask you to concentrate your energies on white boys from poor families.  They are the ones who are most under privileged in the country. Bottom of the heap.

1328796370501853191 2020-11-18 04:25:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> It won’t until every last one of them goes. Starmer is no better - remember he campaigned for Corbyn to be PM less than a year ago... the stench hasn’t faded
1328795901557608453 2020-11-18 04:23:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Spot on, Alex!
1328795490855612420 2020-11-18 04:21:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Keir_Starmer Empty words without action. YOU sat in his shadow cabinet and campaigned to get him elected as PM. The Labour Party will only get power when every last one of you is long gone - the stink of anti Semitism will linger on whilst just one of you is an MP
1328790973225316354 2020-11-18 04:03:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @FoxxysTweets Wow! Shows who is really in power in the Labour Party! Show how deep anti Semitism is....

1328765632318418947 2020-11-18 02:23:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LjDinger @MrMasonMills Again this referencing to 1930s Britain is highly offensive to people like me with Jewish heritage.  Nothing, I repeat nothing, about Mason Mills is remotely ‘extreme right wing’. Unless you can back this up, time die you to stop with this narrative.

I have persevered with Twitter but when I want to really exercise free speech I choose to go elsewhere.

This is ALL about self interest, not about us being an independent nation able to act free of the choke chain of EU. (That should open the floodgates for abuse from remainers!!) 🤪🤪

1328279014897803266 2020-11-16 18:09:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AdamIsSavage2 @Jay_Beecher Good argument!! 🤪
1328254929744650242 2020-11-16 16:33:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CelloBellaClara @Jay_Beecher Boris Johnson has a lot more votes so by your argument you should believe him more.
1328253505170251777 2020-11-16 16:28:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Peachez3001 @NetflixUK I agree. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is way off - too stilted and unbelievable.
1328252505504014336 2020-11-16 16:24:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JadeFos_ Yes,
1328251883262238722 2020-11-16 16:21:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CelloBellaClara @Jay_Beecher 🤣🤣🤣 is that your argument? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1328250862507094016 2020-11-16 16:17:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AdamIsSavage2 @Jay_Beecher I have looked into research but think that this narrative that we’re always lied to by government is untrue. Firstly virus is not a UK invention - this is happening everywhere! As for Brexit &amp; GE, this rant is usual BBC rhetoric. Why do you believe a BBC mouthpiece?
1328111728949792768 2020-11-16 07:04:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jay_Beecher And she has 56k followers who obviously buy into this crap too....

1327935920381829122 2020-11-15 19:26:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BrianAmbler2 MSM are simply obsessed with the enigmatic genius that is DC. I think he is fearless but he’s right - leave his wife and son alone!
1327935109748695041 2020-11-15 19:22:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sehonestman @afneil This is basic mechanics which you don’t have a clue about! It’s not a simple matter of adopting your own currency and banking system when you have huge debt!

1327932964190236673 2020-11-15 19:14:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I totally agree with you. The moment you lose the right to debate (free speech) we are lost.  Luckily we don’t have a Labour government.

That is an enormous problem.  And for the record, I intend to have the vaccination and encourage others to do likewise.  BUT I defend anyone who has opposing views.
1327921576960995328 2020-11-15 18:29:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DavidHawker17 @chapman020 I am pro vaccination but shutting down debate about this (or anything else) is not the way. Use persuasive argument and let people decide for themselves as they do today. Shutting down debate is far more dangerous!
1327921063662116864 2020-11-15 18:27:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chapman020 The hard left (and yes Labour are still hard left) have always shut down debate.  It’s one of the ways they exert control on the masses. In fact it’s all about control. Nothing new but it won’t happen unless we are idiotic to vote them into power in 2024!
1327918539332853762 2020-11-15 18:17:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sehonestman @afneil I do believe in self determination which is why I voted for Brexit so if Scotland want separation from Union so be it. However I think Scotland would need coherent answers to this question in order to win its arguement. Not sure it’s there yet.....

1327650452591271936 2020-11-15 00:31:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @symmo1969 @afneil Scotland leaving will weaken the Union - of course - but I tend to agree that if they want to go let them.  However, they get no financial favours from us.  Independence must mean just that!

I’m quite ambivalent about Scotland leaving the UK mainly because I don’t think it’s getting a referendum any time soon.  I’d like to see the pros and cons spelt out without hatred for England being mentioned.

1327560332987015170 2020-11-14 18:33:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @dougiebrimson @SaltyDuchess @Peston With his pass still around his neck??!!! 🤣🤣🤣
1327560116892209153 2020-11-14 18:32:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Peston But still with his pass around his neck!!! Don’t be a dick, Peston! Either you are privy to nothing or you are deliberately being misleading! Your old mate, Allegra, will be running press in new year so get a grip if you want to maintain a friendship with her!
1327559669548802048 2020-11-14 18:31:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HarrietSergeant Well said, Harriet! 👏👏
1327539763998502912 2020-11-14 17:11:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @grenner @jjcwow He still will see it through...

Problem with people as bright as him, they get very irritated with the thickies in grey suits in Westminster... bound to cause friction. But he’s done what he said he would.
1327538483481767937 2020-11-14 17:06:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jjcwow Remember Dom always made it clear that he was going at end of year.  Note that when he was leaving no.10 yesterday he was carrying a box but still had his pass around his neck.... working on Brexit at home 😉
1327537873156009984 2020-11-14 17:04:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Rob_E_Dresser Blimey! Numerous hat tricks!! 😂😂😂😂
1327537595157520385 2020-11-14 17:03:21 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @sir_frankuk He’s the strategist and is still delivering albeit at home. David Frost is leading negotiations and he’s not for turning. I suspect those celebrating Dom going are all obsessive Remainers. Bless.
1327536887653937152 2020-11-14 17:00:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Rob_E_Dresser What about Adonis? If so, you’ve got a hat trick!

1327237250103603200 2020-11-13 21:09:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> She makes libellous comments all the time.  As we all know they failed to be successful when they tried to prosecute the Leave campaign.
1327236949392977920 2020-11-13 21:08:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @carolecadwalla We knew he was leaving at end of year once he’d really pushed Brexit to the end.  He despises the grey suits of Westminster (rightly so) so off he goes.  Got a feeling that if he reads your bile &amp; venom he’d laugh and think ‘job well done’! 🤣🤣💔

1327187829768802304 2020-11-13 17:53:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gymslip He’s not delaying Brexit as far as I know. If he delays Brexit, the people who lent him their vote will not forgive him. Dom not leaving until end of year to hold tight to your seat!

1327183173558693888 2020-11-13 17:35:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @tonfie @MartinDaubney I totally agree, Tony.  I’m very confident that Dom wouldn’t be leaving if a true Brexit wasn’t already a done deal. Also bear in mind, it’s now law that we leave on 31 December &amp; Boris smart enough to know any extension is the end of the support he has in nation.

1327163776601370624 2020-11-13 16:17:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> You are spot on! Dom Cummings was always going at the end of the year - when transition period done. #ScumMedia up to usual lying tricks
1327153472341479424 2020-11-13 15:36:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> He’s been a brilliant strategist but he detests Westminster and time for him to step back........ for now

With an 80-seat majority it will always appear to be a dictorship but he’s priced flexible again &amp; again

The simple fact is he was forced into a lockdown by bloody Labour &amp; 100 of his own MPs - and it’s hardly a lockdown is it? Apart from pubs... roads aren’t empty, people still go to work, kids go to school..

The hospitals there were overloaded - friend is consultant &amp; confirmed that. SAGE would’ve been consulting any government as they are the appointed experts. I rather favour JVT
1326656781800644613 2020-11-12 06:43:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Stephen74460426 @jenninemorgan @RobsBottin80 @simondolan Cummings is chief advisor but that’s all. He doesn’t wield the power you think and as all PMs have advisors the only thing the media have against him is the leave campaign.  Hence the hysteria over his drive to BC. Boris is very much in charge - don’t believe otherwise!

My initial thoughts is that we’ve not had nearly the same restrictive measures of lockdown as the other countries I have contact with apart from Sweden who readily comply with government restrictions generally.

But it will be treated like a ‘war debt’ - which this pandemic has been. I have family in Holland, Sweden, Spain and South Africa and we swap stories

1325849527866195971 2020-11-10 01:15:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @allisonpearson No, of course not! Biden does that to me and Starmer.
1325846853410304001 2020-11-10 01:04:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @gr16311827 And #piersmorgan who is almost on his tomach groveling.... just as an aside... why is a Biden doing a Coronavirus update when he isn’t even POTUS yet????
1325809240410349569 2020-11-09 22:35:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkVipond Clinton was a a corrupt as hell .. perhaps worried stuff would come out about Clinton Foundation! Let’s just go through process and sure Biden will be installed.  However, Biden will not be easy for UK. See what Douglas Murray says..... 😱
1325805871771901957 2020-11-09 22:22:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkVipond I think this happens every US election... recounts and normal vitriol (remember 2016??).... and I remember well 2000 election when it would appear Gore was over the line .. let’s be patient &amp; let people have their say. I’m only interested how this impacts our country tbh!!!
1325804332554596354 2020-11-09 22:15:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @confidencenac @BorisJohnson I’m hoping within next week....🤞

1325776722986487814 2020-11-09 20:26:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> As usual, you are spot on, Nadia! 👏👏
1325776284786569216 2020-11-09 20:24:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I’m with you on this, Sue.  It simply doesn’t make sense to leave EU if we were.
1325774378676736002 2020-11-09 20:16:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I know! They all seem to do it! 🤪
1325774126582263808 2020-11-09 20:15:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Spot on! We had most media and government opposed to Brexit but still we voted for it
1325773363952934913 2020-11-09 20:12:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @juniperjump @Ena_Leye @redtherock @MayhewJ @campbellclaret I do support schools meals for children most in need. It has been proven that good nutrition increases attainment which can only benefit all. No child should go to bed hungry whether that be through property or bad parenting.
1325772617509429248 2020-11-09 20:09:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MrKRudd @FareedZakaria @CNN I totally accept your premise of having an independent press.  However you seem blind to the fact that all media outlets &amp; big techs were so biased in favour of Biden.  You simply cannot have it both ways.
1325770945307480065 2020-11-09 20:03:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RupertaMargate Absolutely not! Given that our media is mainly anti UK then I think licking his boots will be the least they will do!

1325766303240646657 2020-11-09 19:44:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RupertLowe10 He was forced into lockdown with Labour and about 100 of his own MPs set to vote for a lockdown.  Due to the ‘chatty rat’ he had to make announcement too early.  So hunt on for the rat and when found watch Boris then!

1325726562537402368 2020-11-09 17:06:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MaajidNawaz This is very scary. Neo fascist view but one I hope Biden rejects. I just thank God I live far away from this craziness!

1325722083863695360 2020-11-09 16:49:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @campbellclaret All I hear are three men who were a serious threat to our country. They never had our best interests at heart and between them committed mass murder in our name, sold us down the line to a foreign power and nearly bankrupted us. So I shudder at the very thought of them
1325718043524132864 2020-11-09 16:33:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @linB2198 Morning to you too!

He is right to question process and the fact that US politics is corrupt and not democratic.  Same in 2000 when Al Gore should’ve won and Bush stole it

Trump unleashed will have an opportunity to reveal to the world how US is no different from Russia, China and all the other cesspits in the world. I forecast he opens a news channel

1324003099737001991 2020-11-04 22:58:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Abukar11252693 This is why Islamic culture is simply not compatible with western values. It’s so more complicated than that.

1322955847945887747 2020-11-02 01:37:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SionKyle @twickydicky @manwithlab You learn self discipline when you are a child and what no means. I’ve been an employer for decades and I am not going to guide  people through basic good manners.  Btw you either have grit or you don’t. That’s what I’ve learned through the years. Can’t teach it!
1322877265244524544 2020-11-01 20:24:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I totally agree! I’m guessing it’s a knee jerk reaction and shooting the messenger is much easier than saying we are all to blame for ignoring social distancing which has allowed this virus to multiply

I had one who turned up to a meeting with me 3 hours late, and when I pointed out meeting was at 11 am rather that 2 ok he shouted in my face ‘Well I’m here now! Stop moaning!’.  Silence descended amongst rest of staff..!
1322850312760270848 2020-11-01 18:37:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @twickydicky @manwithlab They haven’t learnt the benefits of failing and the consequences.  I’ve employed young people with 1sts from top universities and found them unable to write coherently, problem solve or be self disciplined. I know I’m not alone in that!
1322847785981530112 2020-11-01 18:27:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bobbt2417 Private hospitals near me taken over by NHS - mother in law can’t get appointment for hip operation! I think this is all about NHS beds - I’m aware hospitals in north are now struggling with seasonal stuff and Covid..
1322847175429283841 2020-11-01 18:25:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bobbt2417 The private hospitals near me have been taken over by NHS! Ok
1322846829600538625 2020-11-01 18:23:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bobbt2417 And we will cope too. Whoever leaked needs to be found and fired on the spot!  We have not enforced social distancing and have allowed all sorts of gatherings with little punishment which now sees us in this position. No surprise!
1322844194222809089 2020-11-01 18:13:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bobbt2417 We cannot blame Boris for spread of this virus - it’s the fault of everyone who has ignored social distancing rules. We simply cannot overload NHS and I know that hospitals in north are battling right now
1322843499998433280 2020-11-01 18:10:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bobbt2417 I totally agree with you. All our neighbours are in trouble with the spread of the virus. Whatever he does he’s going to be criticised but wouldn’t it be wonderful if everyone could put their own prejudices aside for now and work together to get through this?
1322842081413550080 2020-11-01 18:05:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Such a handsome young man ... heartbreaking 💔💔
1322841798079881216 2020-11-01 18:03:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @PeakePolly @allisonpearson Sweden have lost almost 6,000 whereas Norway has lost only 280 .... worth bearing in mind when mentioning Sweden
1322841328770818049 2020-11-01 18:02:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> spot on! And media in an absolute feeding frenzy didn’t help either. Comms director needs to start now!
1322840550832328705 2020-11-01 17:58:59 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @twickydicky @manwithlab Yes, I agree. Maybe a mix of both? It’s a generation that has been rarely told no
1322837017454092288 2020-11-01 17:44:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And there we have it - no mystery why we are now in national lockdown! If I see one more person feeling sorry for ‘poor students’ I will scream!

1322699769597349889 2020-11-01 08:39:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> This is why Covid is rampant in these communities. They just don’t get social distancing!
1322698886708944897 2020-11-01 08:36:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Media are enemy of the state and seem to be rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of lots of deaths from Covid.  Sickening!

Touch with my former sister in law (Swedes are very civilised around divorce..!!) and she’s a nurse specializing in ICT. She told me last Spring that hospitals didn’t have enough ventilators to cope.... that’s anecdotal, I know but interesting....
1322691332977139713 2020-11-01 08:06:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @michaelcroft61 @LozzaFox @NHS @BorisJohnson I lived in Gothenburg.  My first husband Swedish, my sons Swedish so know these countries really well. Problems in Sweden with immigrants in large towns but they are usually concentrated in specific areas.  In my day, lots of Turks.
1322690679840083968 2020-11-01 08:03:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Shazzie_L I know but we have a health service that doesn’t work! European countries mainly have private health schemes and higher tax to pay for better health care. If we let Covid run unchecked, hospitals will collapse and no space for anyone!!
1322689969954168833 2020-11-01 08:00:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @michaelcroft61 @LozzaFox @NHS @BorisJohnson Just under 6,000 deaths in Sweden and 280 deaths in Norway ....

1322688212628811776 2020-11-01 07:53:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LozzaFox @NHS @BorisJohnson Usually agree with you but absolutely not on this.  He’s shown strong leadership. Flexible when needed and he’s obviously had tough decisions to make. I am getting sick &amp; tired of people who have absolutely no science background suddenly becoming expert virologists! Stop. Now!
1322687404566892544 2020-11-01 07:50:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lyndap123 @stevedeek @BorisJohnson You personally may not have been selfish but the reason you are in a higher tier is because people in your area have not been observing social distancing - only way to catch this is to be in contact. Simple as that
1322686051492655104 2020-11-01 07:45:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @David_R_Ballard @Keir_Starmer How on earth would a 2 week lockdown help?!!! Pointless and destructive.  Not sure I’m supportive of this lockdown either.  Properly policed local lockdowns weren’t given a chance. Not even going to comment on your last and grossly untrue point....

1322653245760851970 2020-11-01 05:34:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @stevedeek @BorisJohnson Because the virus is increasing at a frightening rate. I agree with you about selfish lot who have caused this second wave. I’m in Tier 1 too and the harm the actual lockdown is doing is frightening

You have distanced yourself from Corbyn and the report into AS when you served on front bench! And now this! You wanted a 2-week ‘circuit break’ so not the same.  Suggest you start working for UK rather than against it!

1322508049328865283 2020-10-31 19:57:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @WijZeggen @Brexit As for democracy and soreignty - don’t underestimate how important that is to the British.  When it’s undermined, history will tell you what happens.  We don’t capitulate regardless of potential cost.
1322507652228939779 2020-10-31 19:56:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @WijZeggen @Brexit Of course I’m aware of trade between countries.  However, if sense prevails EU won’t shoot itself in the foot by refusing us a free trade deal. In their ballpark. However, we will take no deal too. Perhaps become another Singapore ....
1322507023515295744 2020-10-31 19:53:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Totally agree!!! Anti-British media using the virus to redirect our attention from the mess in their beloved Labour Party

So a new Tier 4 for areas where virus is widespread... but who knows?
1322484992321167360 2020-10-31 18:26:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rightsaid_me Exactly correct! I do think he will bring in stricter measures for areas who are still not complying but we need to wait and see.

1322325574157623296 2020-10-31 07:52:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @hutton257 Me too!
1322322192676376577 2020-10-31 07:39:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @owainpj @Fox_Claire I totally agree. You can’t blame the government for the spread of the virus. Everyone who has ignored social distancing, who didn’t wash their hands is responsible for the state we are in. Shame on us all! The countries that have done best are more compliant and respected rules
1322306217625194498 2020-10-31 06:35:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @hutton257 Oh she’s amazing 87 and still beautiful! Has had a wonderful life and contributed so much. So proud of her.
1322290125351624705 2020-10-31 05:31:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CraigWtweets @LazyAndroids @AuschwitzMuseum I don’t agree. We are about to see hard left come into power in States with a hand in the till in China ... be very scared! So not sure where the hard right powerhouses are? Hungary is hardly a major force...
1322277721444143104 2020-10-31 04:42:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @opto_sean I am so enraged by this! Let’s stand with France and rid ourselves of this cancer - it’s contaminating the very core of our society!

I would also remind the police that social distancing is mandatory and the protest should’ve been dispersed.  What about the £10k fines handed out at previous protests?
1322268399708360704 2020-10-31 04:05:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @hutton257 I know! My mother in law escaped Berlin in 1938 (Jewish) with her parents.  Most of the family died in Auschwitz... but many non Jews died too like this sweet girl..

AS is so deep rooted that it will take a totally new leadership body that hasn’t been contaminated before it stands any hope of being a political force again. Totally agree with all your points!
1322102921023115265 2020-10-30 17:07:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Byrneybyrnes @JonathanSGlass @Keir_Starmer Read the report before being vile to Jonathan. Then, I suggest, you apologise to him. The report is absolutely damning and, as leader, Corbyn is as guilty as hell. Burying your head in the sand and insulting people who disagree won’t make this go away!

1321830795254898688 2020-10-29 23:06:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RudyardLad @darrengrimes_ It’s called politics! Starmer never spoke out and yet pushed for Corbyn to be our PM. He’s now unelectable. A new face is the only way.

If Labour want to be a credible opposition party a totally new face needs to be leading it who had nothing to do with the contaminated party’s past. Chababarti needs investigating too for her fraudulent report!

That is a lie or you would be supporting the publishing of this report and not deflecting. Which you are. It isn’t about Labour v Tory - it’s about right v wrong. It isn’t the Tories who wrote this report - remember that.
1321727438582329344 2020-10-29 16:15:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TelBabe @izcohar6 The fault lies squarely with the people who spend thousands to smuggle themselves into our country illegally. Tragic that innocent small kids die but that’s on their parents. It’s simply wicked to blame Priti for this!

Let’s not make assumptions ...

I do like to debate and try to understand others’ views though.  My son married a Muslim Iraqi girl - very interesting debates &amp; conversations with her family.

Even in this thread I’ve been called racist, xenophobic &amp; other appalling things. I chose to block but I wouldn’t advocate banning the person. His view &amp; very wrong

I totally disliked the cartoons of Mohammed by Charlie Hebdo but I defend their right to publish - it’s the price we pay. What is intolerant is the violence that ensued.
1321493889254105090 2020-10-29 00:47:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jjcwow @tonfie Absolutely bloody not! I cannot believe this is even an option. Enforce the rules we currently have but we simply cannot afford for country to grind to a halt. Let’s see what local lockdowns do and ensure we all play our part! Keep our distance and wash hands!

I had a Muslim partner and we were spat at in the street. Literally. But I still believe in freedom of speech - without it we have an intolerant society - it then becomes a breeding ground for fascism

I really do think FoS is far more important - I know what it’s like to be offended but it helps cement my beliefs &amp; values.

I have the right to say what I want about anyone I choose and not be threatened by violence or death. This attitude is why Islam is despised by so many in the west.

1321443276000530434 2020-10-28 21:26:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @a_leesha1 It is the lack of empathy some Uslims have displayed that we find so offensive. Condemn this act of barbarity and then we can talk.  However the ‘what abouts’ only alienate us
1321442539728211968 2020-10-28 21:23:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @a_leesha1 Of course but it does not give you the right to behead a teacher and resort to the levels of violence that our society finds so abhorrent.  It’s isn’t far right extremism that rejects the barbarity of the beheading but every civilised person regardless of religion.

It destroys the family construct and will increase dependence on state. Once that happens the State can do what the hell rhey want!
1320313027011530752 2020-10-25 18:35:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @doofiddy Ok, so let me get this straight. You want the government (taxpayers)  to feed the nation’s kids? Take away parents’ responsibilities? So not the job of parents to take care of their kids? You understand where this is heading, don’t you?

Rhat is the role of a parent and shouldn’t be taken away from the state.  Those who find themselves on the breadline have huge support especially right now with extra subsidies.

Blindly following Boris is not being supportive - just the opposite. He needs to pick up his messaging about everything although I appreciate it’s been a very tricky year. Communications Director starts soon which will help. I hope.

You don’t know her - you are just a venomous little man who makes judgement of someone he doesn’t know. She has worked day &amp; night to sort out the Extradition Bill amongst many other things..

She is great, highly intelligent, dedicated, determined and very respectful and sweet. Everyone who knows her says the same except the bullies in HO. Wonder why ....?

1319317297106911233 2020-10-23 00:38:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Independent civil servants in Home Office waged a war against Priti from start - didn’t approve of her plans. Rutnam resigning wasn’t pathetic game playing! They didn’t realise who was boss - hopefully they know now. In reality Priti is strong, bright &amp; has a great sense of right &amp; wrong.

Missed meals, walked miles to save on bus fares, shoes had holes in BUT I still fed my kids healthily and well. I worked hard, success in business and - met &amp; married a successful guy.. that helped. But didn’t say I don’t understand ok?

This can be expected although unfortunate given the chaos after WW11. I’d like to see Vatican investigated for smuggling these Nazi killers to South America after the war.....
1319245698504720386 2020-10-22 19:54:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I totally agree with this one. I won’t like either.

Have a good day and maybe don’t be so judgemental in future.
1319243941812838400 2020-10-22 19:47:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lizyeld Husband selling his company so that leaves only me working! Longing for the day!

1319241492376875011 2020-10-22 19:37:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nick___Collins @ailsybabe @ghost_wales Maybe it’s all parents who need to be educated on how to feed their family on restricted budget healthily! Or just handouts, creating a society of victims and dependents?

I’ve lived in country that has absolutely no social infrastructure so I know what real poverty is. Perhaps more education for parents on a restricted budget on how to feed themselves &amp; kids? Constant handouts isn’t the answer!
1319240144176689152 2020-10-22 19:32:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nick___Collins You really are a very angry &amp; bitter man, aren’t you? I just hope and pray that you aren’t passing all this bile onto your poor kids. I actually feel sorry for you as you are obviously in a very dark space.... not going to argue with you as you are obviously not ok

1319230226690412546 2020-10-22 18:52:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ghost_wales We are one of the fattest countries in Europe (another reason for high deaths here) and kids here need better diets. Perhaps instead of handing out more freebies, parents are educated on how to feed their offspring better on a budget?
1319228840632266753 2020-10-22 18:47:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @labourdoorstep_ Liars! It was the Tories who introduced and implemented free school meals for ALL children. In the early school years.
1319228184957718530 2020-10-22 18:44:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> A bit cruel but made me chuckle!!

1319225922214649863 2020-10-22 18:35:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janalibro @bbclaurak 2/2 ... But guess what? I now have a thriving business and pay lots of tax which you can hand out to your families on benefits! I don’t have an issue with that! Oh, here’s where you get pissed off - I married a rich man too! 😂
1319225527132131328 2020-10-22 18:34:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janalibro @bbclaurak 1/2 How f**king dare you judge me!!! No, I wasn’t on benefits because I chose to work in a shitty little job, getting abuse daily. Part-time.  I put newspaper in my shoes and went without meals. I walked miles to save 10p on bus fares....
1319224418854490112 2020-10-22 18:29:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RuleBrexitannia @Keir_Starmer Exactly! I would really welcome a strong Opposition party - current state of affairs is so damaging

1319222500795043842 2020-10-22 18:22:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janalibro @bbclaurak Really? Why not open schools so kids can get an actual meal?

1319220462535233536 2020-10-22 18:14:02 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janalibro @bbclaurak Then it needs to be a case of opening schools during holidays so kids can go in and have their free SCHOOL dinners!

1319218960345300993 2020-10-22 18:08:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janalibro @bbclaurak I said campaign to raise universal credit! Sure, if that’s what you think! But I’m sure you don’t want to take away parents responsibility for putting a few meals into their kids’ stomachs!
1319218487965945857 2020-10-22 18:06:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @charlottedenny6 @rachc50 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir Because people decry the Tories &amp; don’t give them credit for giving ALL kids in early years free lunches. Campaign to raise universal credit but parents must take some responsibility for feeding their kids for a few weeks in year ffs!
1319212574379069440 2020-10-22 17:42:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And I trust the media will make this a main news item #bbcnews #skynews oh look...  https://t.co/C3OFKvMXUC
1319211861179551744 2020-10-22 17:39:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Absolutely! We already feed kids in their early years at school and now in holidays???!! This is madness!!! How about we also provide their clothing?
1319211500117102593 2020-10-22 17:38:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbclaurak If it’s over holidays it’s not school meals is it? Can’t parents feed their kids for a bloody week over half term ffs!!??
1319211123846090752 2020-10-22 17:36:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> Brilliant!
1319210628146466817 2020-10-22 17:34:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> What is going on?!
1319210504506740736 2020-10-22 17:34:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> I ponder the same question, Heather. Only time will tell but France have huge problems with their immigrant population.
1319210011868975107 2020-10-22 17:32:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And when they are at school in the early years all kids get free lunches
1319209805777653760 2020-10-22 17:31:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> She’s an absolute low life!

1319207371848245251 2020-10-22 17:22:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @debatenothate2 What kind of world are they creating?
1319207193170874368 2020-10-22 17:21:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @debatenothate2 OMG! And diminishing an aging population? This is so frightening!
1319196570819137537 2020-10-22 16:39:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @debatenothate2 Is the whole world in on this? My family in South Africa are under HUGE restrictions and their government talking about those continuing after pandemic to ‘reset the economy’!! WTF does that mean??!!!
1319195426516619264 2020-10-22 16:34:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @debatenothate2 And Starmer calling for a national lockdown!!!! (Aka ‘circuit break’).... it’s happening throughout the world causing so much damage far beyond a bloody virus!  x
1319194989461753857 2020-10-22 16:32:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ninnyd101 @mssassysally Stay strong!

1319193845381332992 2020-10-22 16:28:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Nick___Collins Your tweet actually sickens me. Using the word ‘nonce’ out of context is appalling.  Hoping and praying you aren’t a parent ... 🙏🙏🙏
1319193251656683521 2020-10-22 16:25:55 +0800 <CarolineHutt> And those who’ve spent ANY time in jail will be vetted thoroughly. Any committing a crime whilst here sent back immediately to their own country.

1319191929603674112 2020-10-22 16:20:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JanNewell6 @debatenothate2 I know but I’ve had a lot of abuse this morning because I asked simple questions. I welcome debate though and would love to know why you think this is a scam? I’m as confused as the vast majority in country!
1319190113272942594 2020-10-22 16:13:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @phil_h001 @Keir_Starmer @SercoGroup @BorisJohnson @Conservatives You are aware that all kids in first years of school get free meals already and have done for some time? This was actually introduced by the Tories! Just asking parents to feed their own kids for a week ffs!
1319189202186260480 2020-10-22 16:09:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HHepplewhite @OrphanAnnie1981 As always, beautifully put!! X
1319188956764884993 2020-10-22 16:08:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HereticBaruch @HHepplewhite @jojoCherrypip Interesting that you choose to insult rather than debate... I would suggest you get a dictionary and look up the definition of ‘fascisim’ too as you obviously haven’t a clue what it means! Embarrassing tweet from you, I’m afraid.
1319187589899968513 2020-10-22 16:03:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @guardian Sadly it’s inevitable
1319187207882723328 2020-10-22 16:01:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DarrenPlymouth @Ordinary_Bloke2 😂😂😂😂 surely the American people can’t vote for him??

1319185526021361666 2020-10-22 15:55:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JanNewell6 @debatenothate2 To what end? I don’t understand what the government wants to achieve? I’m genuinely interested and welcome the debate as long as we can stay civilised!
1319184837933174784 2020-10-22 15:52:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @frangenever @rachc50 @celtjules66 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir How dare you refer to me like this! I run a business where I pay my team before myself, including during this period. I have ensured they still get paid even if I don’t pay myself! I pay my tax bills so don’t you DARE make assumptions about me! Disgusting comment from you!
1319183858303119360 2020-10-22 15:48:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @scunny_rod @rachc50 @celtjules66 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir I pay more tax in a year than you probably earn and I also pay my team way above the national average. I asked a question and welcome debate. I will not enter into a childish exchange with angry people like you.
1319183262510702592 2020-10-22 15:46:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Me_Klem @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar So do I!! I was on all the marches against the war in Iraq &amp; have friends who fought there! It was wrong! But we can’t do this ‘and what about this’ when an act of barbarity is committed on our streets as it diminishes that crime. No excuse can be made! Don’t do it!
1319182175275749376 2020-10-22 15:41:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rachc50 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir So you know, I run a business &amp; have ensured that I keep staff &amp; pay them before myself which is why I won’t tolerate any false accusations. Mistakes have been made by everyone during this pandemic and an enquiry next year will reveal all. I await that first. Don’t trust media!
1319180189549711361 2020-10-22 15:34:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rachc50 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir I agree &amp; have practiced that with my own team in my business, paying way over minimum wage. However it is important that the state doesn’t cross the line of taking over the parents’ role. It has many implications. If this is what you want we need to raise tax for all.
1319178896647049217 2020-10-22 15:28:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @HenaMH @Car94Hen @MrAndyNgo Why should he get fired? In a class about free speech? We live in a culture that values free speech even if that means being offended. That must be upheld at all costs. It is far more valuable that some oppressive religion like Islam.
1319176273348931584 2020-10-22 15:18:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JanNewell6 @debatenothate2 I don’t agree. The government is doing all it can to avoid a disastrous national lockdown with the tier system. It isn’t their responsibility to bring the ‘r’ down but ALL of us. Just apply social distancing rules.
1319174502685827077 2020-10-22 15:11:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jeremy_hume @huwdai @afneil You need to know about Swedish culture. I know as I lived there and was married to a Swede. They are very compliant and are keeping their distance and abiding by those rules. Stockholm did see a spike in cases. Sweden stats worst amongst Nordic states.
1319171823142113281 2020-10-22 15:00:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @FoxxysTweets @DawnieR2 You are spot on! if we even attempted to raise income tax to pay can you imagine the outcry? There are already free school meals for all kids in the first years. Maybe we should be promoting ways parents can feed their own kids on a limited budget instead of handing them money?
1319170910558081025 2020-10-22 14:57:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rachc50 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir Who exactly is going to pay to feed the cou try’s children? These are reasonable questions and don’t deserve your abusive response.
1319165955327524865 2020-10-22 14:37:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @rachc50 @penhaphi @blunted_james @TheBeigeSirKeir Just a question. If we truly want a full nanny state are you prepared to raise your taxes from 20% to 35%?
1319159620603138048 2020-10-22 14:12:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Me_Klem @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar Here’s the thing: my son married an Iraqi girl - her family fled Iraq - Saddam in particular had jailed her father &amp; uncle.  I disagreed profoundly with the illegal attack on Iraq but they disagreed with me and welcomed the attack. So far more complex that you think
1318998079496982529 2020-10-22 03:30:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jimmy_1975 What on earth did you say?!!

I’ve spent morning in debate with guy from Yemen who says west has killed thousands of Muslims in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan etc in defence of the beheading of the teacher. We must conclude that Islam and western culture don’t mix.

No starvation for starters and a stability which is why so many blacks came to SA from others countries in Africa.

1318827141576970241 2020-10-21 16:11:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar I have the right to dislike anything I want. I don’t wish harm on Muslims - where have I said that? And you have still not answered my question: who supported the murders in NZ? You can’t just come here and spout lies!
1318825536228118528 2020-10-21 16:04:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @StephenPLundy @GuidoFawkes Exactly! You couldn’t make this stuff up! Sedwill was a grubby little man who was a Treacherous Theresa’s puppet
1318824378692403201 2020-10-21 16:00:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar Islam is not a race. It’s a religion so I can’t be racist. As for being Islamophobic, well that means I have an IRRATIONAL fear of all things Islam. I don’t fear Islam, I just don’t like  what people do in its name. I don’t hate Muslims - far from it as my son’s wife is Iraqi
1318823558416601089 2020-10-21 15:56:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar And you need to tell me who justified the killings in NZ.  I just heard, rightly, universal condemnation. No excuses were made for the killer.
1318823074100371460 2020-10-21 15:54:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar I don’t like the countries that are predominately Muslim, that’s true. I believe in equal rights for women, that homosexuality isn’t treated as a crime and freedom of speech which doesn’t result in death or imprisonments.
1318822058508378112 2020-10-21 15:50:55 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar Macron has just closed the mosque in question.

1318815021917417472 2020-10-21 15:22:58 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar Who the hell justified the murders in NZ? Be specific because I didn’t hear anyone do that!

1318806010484695041 2020-10-21 14:47:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar So what? Is that an excuse to act like savages? How about debate, reason? You really need perspective. Dana Nazwar criticising the French police for shooting the killer was totally unacceptable and offensive.
1318805103281885184 2020-10-21 14:43:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mohamed_Badheeb @DanaNawzar Don’t deflect from the fact that another act of barbarity and savagery was carried in the name of Islam once again. A question: why do you choose to live amongst us if we are so dreadful? I’m sincerely interested.

What goes on in that evil little mind of yours to defend the piece of shit who beheaded an innocent teacher? Calling me names doesn’t change any of that. Chechnyans have committed some of the most inhuman acts of terror!

It isn’t about the colour of someone’s skin but about their values. I see you are devoid of values as well as being an uneducated nonentity! Now jog on!

So how would you describe the killer? Do you think his values are compatible with normal western society? Do you think he was justified in his actions?
1318267791183589381 2020-10-20 03:08:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @afneil Think you are brilliant but please don’t use that phrase, ‘My bad’. Please.

We will find our way - you watch!

We won’t shift on fisheries and State Aid so just the normal political exchanges now so we can be civilised going forward.

Quite simply this version of Islam despises our culture.  Time to accept that this social experiment of mixing our cultures has failed.

1317449167862702080 2020-10-17 20:55:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @baracola @MarkVipond @SkyNews Then that confirms that eu are duplicitous and not to be trusted.

1317130880511606784 2020-10-16 23:50:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ScottZPinkRose @Milagro35164688 @AuschwitzMuseum I believe you will find that Obama started separating parents &amp; kids. And I’d like to see proof of forced sterilization.  And NOTHING you refers to even begins to compare.  I find your comments deeply offensive - my mum in law lost most of her family at Auschwitz..
1317065428187959296 2020-10-16 19:30:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @piersmorgan Maybe listen to your own words and stop spouting nonsense when you have absolutely no qualifications to do so!
1317064460033527808 2020-10-16 19:26:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @kelvmackenzie So many thought Boris would cave - not a chance! EU just didn’t get it and it will only be once we are out and operating as an independent country that EU will get it and offer us a proper deal!

1316738209083260929 2020-10-15 21:50:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Keir_Starmer When you use this nonsense phrase ‘circuit break’ you mean complete lockdown. Nobody wants this, especially in areas that don’t have high incidence of the virus. I think you know that but want to bury Boris... it won’t work
1316674895934353408 2020-10-15 17:38:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DaxGigandet Yes I do. Not in hospital but very poorly

1316438496425512960 2020-10-15 01:59:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DarrenEuronews And people blame the government! These little shits deserve all they get!

1316373561230192643 2020-10-14 21:41:28 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RichardAlliste2 @AuschwitzMuseum But have they managed to shake it off? It’s a legacy that they will always live with...
1316373230131830784 2020-10-14 21:40:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SpecCoffeeHouse @afneil @MrSteerpike Did it occur to her that she gets death threats because she is an abhorrent human rather than being a Muslim woman? (Not that I’m endorsing vile death threats whatsoever). Her inability to listen rather than scale up ever debate shows how jaw-dropping unaware she is
1316371569623609345 2020-10-14 21:33:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkSmithHigham @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc You too, Mark. I’ve see-sawed on this so much but I’m very concerned about the economy grinding to a halt &amp; that really deprivation &amp; depression follows
1316371137190932481 2020-10-14 21:31:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Such a beautiful family. RIP 💔💔💔💔

And breakdown of those in ICT and deaths by age, pre-existing medical problems..... let’s get a fairer figure now. Most of cases are students where it’s just flu at most
1316369467182649344 2020-10-14 21:25:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkSmithHigham @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc And medically vulnerable. IF they so wish.

1316331557905457153 2020-10-14 18:54:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkSmithHigham @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc So the number who have died under age of 70 with no pre-existing medical issues is about 320.
1316288612712026117 2020-10-14 16:03:55 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @imasurvivor66 I could only stand a couple of minutes! 😂😂😂
1316288442830065665 2020-10-14 16:03:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @lisanandy Your health minister said in Parliament yesterday that a lockdown would be a disaster! I suspect you and the rest of the Labour rabble are opportunists who want to score political points. Disgusting and we won’t forget! How about working FOR the people in UK and not against?
1316287638459109376 2020-10-14 16:00:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @suzyr61 @allisonpearson Herd immunity but I suspect a lot more died than the official figures show. Don’t forget that the average life expectancy of blacks is much lower too... as SA has now totally destroyed economy for many years to come, a lot more casualties will occur. Sadly country is finished

1316283863866519552 2020-10-14 15:45:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @suzyr61 @allisonpearson As someone with family in South Africa a word of caution: NEVER believe a single word that comes out of the country! Truth is people are devastated with the virus and are starving too. No rescue packages there!
1316283151736594432 2020-10-14 15:42:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @imasurvivor66 🤣🤣🤣 I saw clip of interview with Sharon Davies and trans person ‘debating’ rugby.... 95% talking done by Chubby Morgan and his Sqeaky Sidekick ! 🤣

It’s insane! Are you aware how many people have died under 70 without pre-existing medical issues?
1316277233598824448 2020-10-14 15:18:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @imasurvivor66 I absolutely understand! There are some absolute nutters on Twitter - it’s their ideal platform. Have a break and come back soon. Missing you already! X
1316275971524366336 2020-10-14 15:13:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkSmithHigham @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc It doesn’t work like that, Mark. If you shut down everything for 2 weeks and then rejoin circuit what do you think will happen? Yes, the virus just returns. And so it continues and a ‘stop start’ approach will cause untold damage. Better to let virus work through population
1316266314630127616 2020-10-14 14:35:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MarkSmithHigham @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc It doesn’t work like that. A national lockdown will mean more devastation to the economy and then what? You think this virus will be suppressed? it will just come back. Protect the old and vulnerable and get UK back to work.
1316137706737618948 2020-10-14 06:04:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @CornishRandalls @JuliaHB1 It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever! What happens when you reconnect the circuit? Then another lockdown? Time to stop this farce and get everyone back to work!
1316135859188568064 2020-10-14 05:56:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @JuliaHB1 @Gerat1t It’s a ludicrous notion! What the hell does he think will happen after the ‘circuit break’??? Then what??
1316129109764788224 2020-10-14 05:30:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Jane_Stevenson_ @glinch2_mc This ‘circuit breaker’ concept is beyond stupid. For how long and then what? Shield vulnerable and elderly and let the rest of us get back to work!
1316045704972955649 2020-10-13 23:58:41 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @meghan_mortimer @Misteri090 @derek_duvall @samm735 @ianbrown But I don’t have a different opinion! I am passionately against a lockdown - common sense says it won’t work and that herd immunity is the most effective remedy.  I’ve always thought that regardless of 5 people I know who have had C-19/bad flu!
1316044600402993152 2020-10-13 23:54:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Misteri090 @meghan_mortimer @derek_duvall @samm735 @ianbrown Thanks! I have just watched it! Very compelling argument! It just doesn’t feel right to lock down the world’s population.... I can’t remember another time when we felt so under threat and vulnerable
1316038627445682178 2020-10-13 23:30:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @meghan_mortimer @Misteri090 @TGDaviesphotog1 @derek_duvall @samm735 @ianbrown I don’t believe in lockdown - it simply won’t work. Regardless of the severity, here immunity is the only answer. At one point HALF the worlds population was locked down.

All were aged 87-91.... at least one of them had not even been tested.  I get what you are saying but will not tolerate being called a liar. I will day again - I don’t agree with lockdown or ignoring cancer!

No, they didn’t die but were VERY sick! Who the F**k are you to dispute that???? I’m done with being called a liar in this thread. Enjoy your evening.  I’m done.

Maybe it was flu - I don’t know - but I’m just saying what doctors diagnosed. And the shit I’ve put up with here is totally unwarranted!
1316033167212642304 2020-10-13 23:08:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @meghan_mortimer @derek_duvall @samm735 @ianbrown Yes, you are right about flu. None of the people I mentioned had flu though - they were diagnosed by doctors as having Covid-19.

And of course you are bitter about leaving EU because you have so little faith in this country that you think is incapable of charting its own course. You sound like you are in a very dark place

He isn’t an MP and is simply best advisor around. Brilliant strategist and we can thank him for Brexit and 80-seat majority government.  Can you imagine having ragbags government of Corbyn running this shitshow?

1311236327019610112 2020-09-30 17:27:56 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jeremy_hume @martindale567 @AThebrexitparty @toadmeister @historykev When the first wave came we were coming out of winter and didn’t know anything but now we head for winter with more knowledge. We must try to suppress this virus or our health services will collapse and other diseases will be ignored. It’s not about the death rate.
1311230713941897222 2020-09-30 17:05:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @martindale567 @AThebrexitparty @toadmeister @historykev I think a balance needed. Cases are increasing, hospitals are seeing more Covid cases and we know where that leads to. Look at Liverpool right now..... I prefer local lockdowns rather than a national lockdown.
1311230091591127044 2020-09-30 17:03:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @alison_pannell @alex_brian92 @simondolan Of course you should question decisions made by those in authority. Always. However I look for motivations and ask why the countries of the world would plunge themselves into this deliberately? Doesn’t make sense to me.
1311131098626363394 2020-09-30 10:29:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DanRather @raehanbobby Empathy? He just came over as a clueless old man who slurred his words. No fair on him, his family or US if he become President
1311127351535849473 2020-09-30 10:14:54 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @timothy_stanley Nonsense! Biden sounds drunk, slurring his words. Has no answers to anything! Also got the questioner on his side!

This is all YOUR fault and I suggest the hostile stance will only lessen your chances of ever getting a minister on! Try eating humble pie!

1310843319048691713 2020-09-29 15:26:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum What a beautiful child, murdered at the tender age of 12. Cannot even try to comprehend what she went through in the last few hours of her life..... we remember you, Hilda. 💔💔💔

Many people born here from multi ethnic origins see themselves as English/British which is absolutely 💯 correct but you don’t seem to.... I’m from part Irish descent but British through and through
1310506485580025857 2020-09-28 17:07:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @charlesabey @Im4LeavingEU @LeaveEUOfficial @DavidGHFrost In your tweet you describe the English as having ‘Delusions of Grandeur’ ... I’m assuming you don’t include yourself in that statement? If so then you don’t count yourself as English.
1310505697239609344 2020-09-28 17:04:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @QueenVicToriouz If this was genuine she/he would be all over the press, interviewed on GMB at the very least!!

1310345271423963136 2020-09-28 06:27:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MaryRiddell Deluded! But did make me laugh so you get one point for that! 🤣🤣🤣
1310343491680186369 2020-09-28 06:20:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SteveBakerHW I was a fan of yours and really was disappointed that you didn’t make the Cabinet post GE. However, since then your pettiness and spitefulness towards our PM has been embarrassing and very revealing about the man you are. Now I get why you aren’t in the Cabinet!

1310152405183598593 2020-09-27 17:40:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @c_kedge @peterwalker99 I wasn’t being rude but stating fact. You have a very pretty face and was trying to tell you something to help you. Sorry if I upset you.
1310151578549133312 2020-09-27 17:37:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @c_kedge @peterwalker99 You brought up the issue of you being obese and I just wanted to be helpful. Keto diet. Have a great Sunday!
1310149922671529986 2020-09-27 17:30:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @c_kedge @peterwalker99 I don’t want to hurt your feelings but if you are officially obese you are massive &amp; MUST lose weight.  People around you won’t be as brutal as me but Please don’t kid yourself! I’ve put on weight this year - 20lbs - and jumped a dress size so am now dieting healthily. Join me!
1310147940288167937 2020-09-27 17:23:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @benhabib6 @Gerat1t @BorisJohnson @BrexitWatch5 Of course he isn’t going to sell out!! Why would you stir the shit???? Cummings is right there and you may remember he was the architect of the leave campaign??
1310147497407508482 2020-09-27 17:21:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @therealmissjo @Gerat1t I agree with you about the hypocrisy of the met police’s handling of demos.  However, as we are gripped in an ever-changing pandemic taking time (5 days) to scrutinise every bit of legislation in Parliament is going to cost lives. Gvmt has 80 seat majority - it will pass anyway
1310146279951958017 2020-09-27 17:16:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @peterwalker99 Ever since Steve Baker didn’t get a Cabinet Post he’s been stirring crap for the government any way he can. He’s been a massive disappointment.
1310145712886362119 2020-09-27 17:14:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @c_kedge @peterwalker99 If you are obese you are massive. Keeping the weight off will save lives.
1310139264659791872 2020-09-27 16:48:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @MissDomergue I can see it and we are still following each other

I believe you will see new laws in November that will be enacted 1 Jan
1309991537070297090 2020-09-27 07:01:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Although he didn’t live a long life he survived and that is still a victory! And for so long.  I love his gentle face.. 💔💔
1309980163082461184 2020-09-27 06:16:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Paula55855 I so agree with you, Paula.  If we follow one another it means we have agreement of certain things but may disagree on others.  For instance I’m not convinced by the anti vacs stance or anti masks debate but I’m willing to debate &amp; question without being rude.
1309978394520481794 2020-09-27 06:09:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @IamAustinHealey Sweden are seeing spikes now and questioning whether their methods are right.... if our health services get overwhelmed with this then more serious illnesses such as cancer will be put on back burner ...
1309977724535148545 2020-09-27 06:06:42 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ScottyKBF @metpoliceuk I don’t want to go into the rights and wrongs of the demo itself but the police have hardly been even handed... remember them running away from BLM and allowing our statues to be vandalised?
1309905172102090754 2020-09-27 01:18:24 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Graham88393520 @sooperhoop68 @campbellclaret @KateEMcCann @SkyNews But true! And just seeing Campbell’s name puts any normal person into a dressed state!
1309904501856497670 2020-09-27 01:15:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DeanScott24 @ChrisAldus The problem is the Dublin III regulation that governs how we manage this situation. Just wait and see what happens after 1st January.

1309896219859324932 2020-09-27 00:42:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SteveLaws19 Whilst I have sympathy with the cause, arent the the regulations saying that we should be limiting ourselves to groups of six now?
1309894194216013824 2020-09-27 00:34:47 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SarahJB34 @Berumster I think it’s the fact we don’t speak honestly about this that it’s escalating.  But I agree - a conversation needs to happen soon.
1309855590106173440 2020-09-26 22:01:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @notjustdad @janekin24 @allisonpearson I wouldn’t believe a word that comes out of China so this is irrelevant
1309781917382959106 2020-09-26 17:08:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DawnButlerBrent Have some respect and know when your voice offends. Clue: that would be now. Just put your phone down and don’t tweet one more thing about this.
1309780609552863234 2020-09-26 17:03:26 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum What a stunning woman.  We remember you, Claire 💔💔
1309780163111026689 2020-09-26 17:01:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Karakyiah @Berumster But the most educationally deprived are white poor boys.  Huge investment into black communities and opportunities given. Of course many POC are decent contributors to society but the violence seems to be predominately perpetrated by POC. We need an honest dialogue.
1309778706647392256 2020-09-26 16:55:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @TessSticles @Berumster I agree. I know that some of the countries they come from are very casual about violence. Somalia for instance - its almost like its a way of life.
1309778257861115904 2020-09-26 16:54:05 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SarahJB34 @Berumster Lots of white kids without a father role model - I’d thought of that. Their identity linked with some of the abhorrent music they identify with? Gangs, yes. But you are right, we need an honest conversation. Many POC though contribute positively to our country though.
1309777450499559426 2020-09-26 16:50:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Berumster The faint of heart steer clear of this subject but we have to face facts here. I have no idea but we need to have the courage to address this honestly!

1309770061121544193 2020-09-26 16:21:31 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janekin24 @allisonpearson But they haven’t! Students have partied like virus doesn’t exist! Good!

From what I’ve seen students have been partying as if the virus doesn’t exist! Of course let them get sick (as they’ve done), quarantine to protect more vulnerable communities and herd immunity created! Good!

1309559638468296705 2020-09-26 02:25:22 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SteveBakerHW Of course the rules have changed! I’d be disappointed if they hadn’t given that nobody knew anything about it at the start!

1309258020828975105 2020-09-25 06:26:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BonaldBumpf @AuschwitzMuseum @georgegalloway My nephew lives in Israel, served in IDF and so I know more than you. You are an anti Semite who has crawled out of your cesspit. Your hatred for mankind will never win. Obviously I’ve reported you, you festering little maggot.
1309211066208071684 2020-09-25 03:20:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jenniferhotspur Yes! I haven’t regretted voting to leave for a second.
1309210615462924291 2020-09-25 03:18:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Baconsarni1 Nor me.  I lived there (my first husband was to a swede) and they really were handed stuff on a plate.  A very soft society.

1309179844807323648 2020-09-25 01:16:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BonaldBumpf @AuschwitzMuseum @georgegalloway The Germans wanted to build an Aryan perfect race and that excluded the Jews. It also excluded people of colour, homosexuals, gypsies, Jehovah Witnesses. Jews were their main target though as they often excel in their communities - professors, lawyers, bankers, business owners.

1309029516187238400 2020-09-24 15:18:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Rhye_The_Word The normal Swedes are at their wits end to all this being forced on them by an utterly gullible government

1309027292971237376 2020-09-24 15:10:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Beyond the bruises I see a beautiful man. May you rest in peace 💔💔💔

1308845893622398976 2020-09-24 03:09:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LFC_blano It’s like those women who write romantic letters to mass murderers on death row... something wrong with them...
1308844992299925504 2020-09-24 03:05:37 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Such a beautiful darling boy! Same age as my grandson - I just don’t understand how someone could throw this child into the gas chamber! 💔💔💔💔

I really don’t know the answers but I’m terrified of another huge spike in infections that take resources away from cancer treatments ..!

We cancelled but kept the bouncy caste and made sure he had the best time! People visited in  shifts and stayed outside - he had a fab time! 😀
1308831107392049152 2020-09-24 02:10:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janekin24 @jenninemorgan @ClareNicole3 @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 I have faith.  Maybe I’m being naive but I’m choosing to believe that it isn’t in the governments interests to destroy the economy

Everyone criticised government for not locking down sooner in March and now we have protest about even just curbing our social interaction to keep the economy functioning!
1308828774100873216 2020-09-24 02:01:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @janekin24 @Jfluxxx @NeilClark66 I did think like this and respect your opinion.  I’ve changed my opinion on this repeatedly.  However, I look at countries where people have complied and they are doing better.  I would fight tooth and nail against a 2nd lockdown though - this is more in line with Sweden
1308828262399987714 2020-09-24 01:59:09 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jenninemorgan @ClareNicole3 @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 So I guess that comment about lacking empathy is directed at me. I DO have empathy but more for people whose livelihoods will be destroyed rather than people wanting big social gatherings. It’s only for 6 months - previous generations have been asked for much more!
1308827711444529152 2020-09-24 01:56:57 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClareNicole3 @jenninemorgan @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 So you can have your parents over or meet just the mum and kids? I know it’s tough but I just want to avoid a second lockdown which would destroy businesses and jobs.

We are limited to gatherings of 6 - I’m able to still be with family with that. Ok, so I can’t have the family party we were planning for 30 at end of October but a small price to pay ...

I KNOW people who’ve had it and you are very wrong.  It’s horrible and has lasting affects... look at countries who’ve done well suppressing the virus - all have complied with regulations
1308701990336237568 2020-09-23 17:37:23 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Whizzle68262084 @benjaminbutter There are certain and specific communities that have, by and large, totally ignored distancing since March -  Birmingham is a prime example

He needs to be home and being taken care of by a loving family and nurses. Please don’t vote for him - it’s cruel

1308676477114818560 2020-09-23 15:56:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Fox_Claire @MikeSwadling I was expecting far more stringent measures! Once the initial hysteria has abated, we will see new rules aren’t so different from those in Sweden. We need a far more honest conversation with ourselves about our own behaviour during these times and what we can all do differently
1308675544750403584 2020-09-23 15:52:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NeilClark66 @janekin24 Stop this! It’s dangerous &amp; irresponsible and will result in people dying! We don’t have a second lockdown (like other countries) but more like the Swedish model. Let’s be more thoughtful of our fellow citizens, shall we?

Not even shutting pubs and restaurants.... more like Sweden model only we don’t have a public that complies so easily and has been selfish and thinks they know best. We need to be far more grown up!

Previous generations have gone through a lot worse. Time to grit our teeth!
1308668955322703874 2020-09-23 15:26:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BMeiselas @Brydon11Pullen Unlike Obama who was capable of convincing so many idiots he had empathy whilst committing murders of thousands through an intensive programme of drone strikes. I know which one I prefer.

1308545403122524160 2020-09-23 07:15:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @vosie @benjaminbutter Tweets like this make me so angry! YOU have a responsibility for your own behaviour. A bloody halfwit knows about social distancing, washing hands and following arrows around a shop, pub.  If we can’t do that then WE are to blame. Countries who do well comply with the rules.

1308544252553629696 2020-09-23 07:10:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @benjaminbutter Because idiots totally disrespected the rules! Raves, marches, ignoring quarantine, testing positive and going out on pub crawls.  FFS, we haven’t complied which is why we are spiking again!

All you are doing is showing huge disrespect for all those who were murdered in Auschwitz. Actually, you are totally disgusting! You should be ashamed of yourself!

We put our own selfish desires before it, would happily see us fail to make a bloody point! Boris has trusted us to make our own decisions too much and we’ve failed. I hope he comes down hard in the rule breakers now or our country will be done

Another national lockdown will not working but maybe more stringent measures on the rule breakers. God, if we can’t abide by the 2 m rule, follow arrows in shop, wash our hands then I just despair!

Seriously? I have loved their handling of the Brexit issue and they dealt with the pandemic challenge (with a crap NHS) as best they could albeit with some mistakes (who didn’t??).  The so-called ‘Tory’ media are Remainers...

He hasn’t failed and is - at last - a PM who actually lives his country unlike the ones before. I voted for him and would vote for him again in an instance.

Swedes are more naturally compliant than us which has helped them fight this virus. Us? Moan, see conspiracies around every corner and say ‘it’s not fair!’ Far too often (A phrase much used in our society).

1307956307551543296 2020-09-21 16:14:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @YardleyShooting You are right. Sweden have this sorted by a population that complied to the letter with regulations &amp; let the virus move within population whilst shielding most vulnerable.  Lowest rates in Europe now. We all must take responsibility in getting this sorted!
1307955693153124353 2020-09-21 16:11:52 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @jeremy_hume @YardleyShooting @Gerat1t The problem I have is that unless you let the virus make its way through the population then every time lockdown stops it will increase. Look at Sweden with the lowest cases in Europe now. However they are compliant with any regulations which has helped them combat this.

Of course I’m worried by the rise in positive cases - I run a business just out of furlough. I KNOW cabinet doesn’t want a national lockdown though &amp; is doing all it can to avoid one.

It isn’t or other countries would’ve adopted same model.

1306882338148814851 2020-09-18 17:06:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Hellharbour @AuschwitzMuseum @ChrisMac1270 Your comment is wholly inappropriate &amp; disrespectful  to everyone remembered who was murdered at Auschwitz. That includes many non Jews. You have no humanity - shame on you. Don’t contaminate the site and the memory of those who died and get off the site.

The problem is she was chosen to tick a ‘diversity’ box &amp; that is a great insult to her! She will be tainted in her new role - a shame - &amp; you, you utter plank, make it worse with idiotic comments like this. Or are you trying to get into her pants?

It should be just ONE black player across NINE teams.... and Gary, it is YOU who is the problem!
1306613184858595329 2020-09-17 23:17:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @FoxxysTweets Worried but I do think that we should shield the vulnerable and let herd immunity take its course... I’m more worried about resources being taken away from cancer treatments...

I would say that you really don’t have a clue what sexism &amp; misogyny was like in the 1970s.  You didn’t experience it so really can’t compare with what you go through as a POC. The world has changed hugely over last 50 years!

They have added our own backstop/insurance policy in case we have no deal that allows mainland UK to transfer food to NI.  Look, nothing I say will take the blinkers off you in your blind adoration of the EU project.

I did my own research and  listened to both sides. I was influenced ultimately by the objective view of someone who’d got masters in economics from MIT. I get that you choose to insult me to vent your anger

I’m sorry you feel so bitter that the country voted for Brexit but that’s the price you pay for living in a democracy. Why don’t you try to get the skills that will allow you to move to Europe?

And his marriage to Marina was over well before Carrie came on the scene ... he still has good relations with M... how’s it going between the Milliband brothers?? 😂

I find it interesting that you disrespect what I endured but expect me to respect your pain.  Pain is pain but it’s how you react. Me? I went on to run a successful company. Tell me some of the things you go through as a POC

That’s all I’m saying. I was a young woman in business in 1970s - need I say more? But you will have no idea what that was like either
1305950411837370368 2020-09-16 03:23:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @shawemily @markphughes17 @montie I can tell you categorically that Boris wants a deal but it must be one that’s suits and benefits this country. You still haven’t given me evidence that he is deliberately pursuing no deal to put money in his mates’ hands. I assume you can’t.

We know some Tory mPs votes against (let’s say 18-20) which means the Unionists made up the rest of the ayes..? I can’t  wait to see which Tories votes against the bill or abstained - my MP had better not be amongst them!! 😂
1305636343289188357 2020-09-15 06:35:36 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @bbclaurak So all your blabbing about Tory rebellion was shit earlier? Some accurate commentator you are!

Threatening to deny us 3rd party status if we don’t comply was never going to work!

Personally I didn’t like WA in first place. Hopefully we get a deal - more likely now with IMB - that suits us first &amp; foremost.

This bill will be like an insurance policy in case of a WTO Brexit and to ensure a free flow of goods between here &amp; NI

Always intended to sort it out but timing was critical. He got it right.  Secondly totally support you in fighting every seat of MP who votes against bill.... they are voting against UK

1305476953265274884 2020-09-14 20:02:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @InfoBears @BritishAlba @garystreeterSWD That is you accepting the premise that the EU are ‘civilised’. I don’t. They are more than capable of inflicting huge sanctions on us if we don’t comply. They have refused to agree our status as Third Party. Do some research first, ok?

I hope you get the bollocking from hell from Boris for your betrayal and have the whip taken off you.  Absolutely no excuse for this. Shame on you for disrespecting the office you hold!

1305461752264564736 2020-09-14 19:01:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @grahambsi I actually mean it as it must be so depressing.  I felt like that about Blair being our PM.  3 times voted in - I just knew he was a megalomaniac &amp; had lots of rows about it within the family.
1305460742246862848 2020-09-14 18:57:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @grahambsi I’ve just seen your bio... pointless debating with someone with such fanatical views about the EU. I feel sorry for you, genuinely, that you can’t see EU for what it is. Refer you to Kalergi Plan

1305425697528320000 2020-09-14 16:38:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Mcbeath_on_sea @ConorBurnsUK The WA took Brexit over the line but was always a temporary solution.  In light of threats by Barnier we have to now take measures to protect Union. It’s all in the timing....

The GFA was 23 years ago and times have changed.  Rest of UK will not be held hostage to a bunch of thugs who just want to kill each other!
1304846052990889988 2020-09-13 02:15:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @chrisandariane @bernardjenkin What obligations????? The EU - and some hardline remainders still don’t get it.  We can make our own decisions and are not obligated to anyone else!

You would support  a  UK  where foods couldn’t  pass freely from mainland to NI? You think that’s ok? I don’t. And that the difference between us: I love my country and you don’t, you pathetic traitor
1304479236674158593 2020-09-12 01:57:40 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @OfficialDicka @MarkShilcock @RicHolden 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 God knows what goes on in your head!! See ya!

1304478398161596421 2020-09-12 01:54:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Eastwood1A1 @BorisJohnson Oh I agree.  She was a devout supporter of EU and did her best to keep us as aligned to it as possible. Hideous woman who wouldn’t know democracy if it slapped her in the face. Useless HS too!

It’s exciting but we will win the day although there will be casualties!

We were threatened by EU that they would stop us being able to send food stuffs to NI so we did the right thing - we rewrote that bit of WA.  Unless of course you think that’s OK for EU to do that to us? If so, you are a worthless pos

1304106701868670976 2020-09-11 01:17:21 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ClarkeMicah @FullSteam15 I know Sweden quite well - they are a significantly healthier bunch than us lot in UK. That will have a bearing on their success with herd immunity.

Her text was cutting off a friendship because of his support for all lives matter.... she then made an unpleasant comment about ‘letting ‘them’ (people of colour) have their slogans’ in a very patronising fashion.  And who did you say was the better person?

1304011766641373186 2020-09-10 19:00:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LozzaFox It’s important to have friends of different political persuasions or else where does heathy debate lie? Censoring your friendship is a real reflection on Rebecca Front rather than you. Chin up!

The WA states that both sides need to act in good faith. EU hasn’t. Stop being a traitor and be on the side of your own country. Or get out.

I’m sorry, but I think you have made a massive mistake peddling your support for a militant Marxist group on a family entertainment peogramme. Shame.

1303473403849039872 2020-09-09 07:20:51 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @urbanfox93 @darrengrimes_ But your EU threatened food into NI to force us to give in to their unrealistic demands! I’m guessing you are not British as to make such a comment would be disloyal..

1303401157163978755 2020-09-09 02:33:46 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NdsNick74 @allisonpearson But 2 hours for fire brigade?! Whilst children lay there in agony, dying? How can anyone do that?
1303400566320779268 2020-09-09 02:31:25 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @NdsNick74 @allisonpearson Yes, everyone blames the bomber but lessons must be learned and without a transparent enquiry that can’t happen.
1303400255602544642 2020-09-09 02:30:11 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @allisonpearson @heidiEC5 And a couple of hours for the fire brigade....

1303320112032821250 2020-09-08 21:11:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum And Ernestyna survived! The horrors she witnessed wouldn’t have coloured the rest of her life.

1303306046564429824 2020-09-08 20:15:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SkyNews And rightly so. So disappointed that Diversity thought it a smart idea to stoke up racism again for the sake of a bloody dance... thought Ashley Banjo was better than that

1303303899739123713 2020-09-08 20:07:18 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 get over it - it ended a long time ago! Stop blaming the white man for your incompetence... and tut-tut, manning calling.. 🤣🤣🤣
1303302177222516737 2020-09-08 20:00:27 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 The ANC have been running SA for 26 years and it is their fault all the wealth is leaving SA.  Keep voting for them and watch your children starve. Your collective stupidity is actually jaw dropping!
1303300698105434117 2020-09-08 19:54:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 I CONTRIBUTED to the wealth - that’s the difference between us!
1303300304243433474 2020-09-08 19:53:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 Look at your kid... your attitude will not help her or give her a future! Your victimhood stops you getting on - you weren’t even around during apartheid!
1303299859462619137 2020-09-08 19:51:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 And by the way, blacks have killed more people than the whites ever did - do your homework! The worst thing was denying blacks the vote but then look how that worked out? You are on brink of being another Zim
1303299374450118656 2020-09-08 19:49:19 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 The vision of Mandela was one rainbow nation. You have failed on delivering his promise. The ANC has plundered &amp; polluted your country - why can’t you grasp that? And STILL you vote for them???? Your country is over. Thank God my family got all their wealth out last year!!

1303290826265710592 2020-09-08 19:15:21 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @danr1980 @acgrayling Absolutely no sense! Don’t be so gullible to believe Grayling - he has no insider info whatsoever, believe me!
1303290394176782337 2020-09-08 19:13:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @acgrayling Do you really think that anyone in power would have you anywhere near them? Taking you into their confidence about anything? How gullible do you think we are, you old fool? You lie.

They have different cultures and different toleration about violence and life &amp; death. I didn’t say anything g about morals.  So you consider female mutilation as civilised? Killed gay people? Stoning women to death?
1303286854180048896 2020-09-08 18:59:34 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @cwritesstuff @BigDogDrinks @UKWeaver @corbymac @PhilipHammondUK Those with the foresight to recognise that leaving the EU was the right thing have tolerated being called xenophobic, traitors (that was yesterday), stupid, racists, fascists and so on. So now it’s nearly done and still the Remainers whinge and whine...! It’s hilarious!
1303286333948006402 2020-09-08 18:57:30 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @cwritesstuff @BigDogDrinks @UKWeaver @corbymac @PhilipHammondUK For years the hard core remainers have been doing their best to overturn the democratic vote of referendum.  They have been utterly vile in social media so it’s good to tell them to suck it up. Actually no, it’s brilliant!

1303272432900476928 2020-09-08 18:02:16 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 Do you know where Zimbabwe is? Do you see any similarities between the way they treated their farmers and how SA treats theirs? Know what happened? The country is starving to death! Begging the rest of world to help! That’s SA in 5 years time
1303268540640788481 2020-09-08 17:46:48 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 You are so dense that you can’t see how racist YOU are!!! This is why I despair with idiots like you polluting SA! Take a good look at your kid - she will be starving within next 5 years
1303267515158716416 2020-09-08 17:42:43 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Ntk2203 Where have I justified racism, you dimwit? And I have experienced racism.. many times! Don’t make assumptions about people or you just embarrass yourself.

1303222449765482496 2020-09-08 14:43:39 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @colgravel @newmoo41 There are cultures that seem to have a toleration for violence more than us and have little respect for life.  Of course this is a generalization. In our culture we don’t stone women to death, kill gay people, mutilate girls’ genitalia etc etc etc

Scotland has had its referendum and voted to stay in Union. It’s been told there won’t be another one so matter how much the SNP stamps it foot. It’s all just noise now.

The difference between me and you is that I have faith in my country to stand as an independent entity on the world stage.

We operate a policy of free speech in this country so shutting someone down because you disagree with his views is not what we should do. Argue with him, sure, and disprove his point.  Anyone thought of that?

The truth is you are fucking starving to death, you utter idiot. Nothing I have said is racist but you will go to your graves early still whining about apartheid (ended 30 yrs ago) which I’m guessing you didn’t even experience.

No longer on its knees but on its stomach. Just another shithole African country run by thugs! The Guccis fool nobody!

ANC has taken 26 years to destroy a prosperous country and strip it of all its assets.  You are finished as a country and everyone I know is planning their exit.

1302869770430222337 2020-09-07 15:22:14 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @peppercott 4 more years! But agree with you totally!
1302866469550804993 2020-09-07 15:09:07 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @piersmorgan And yet you supported your son going on a BLM march earlier this year??? I would say you are cynical narcissist who is just a bit thick!
1302860840199168003 2020-09-07 14:46:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @RichardBentall This is just embarrassing. Look up the definition of fascism.

1302383581080301575 2020-09-06 07:10:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Independent Absolutely no chance. Never was if we were truly going to leave the EU.
1302322544213667840 2020-09-06 03:07:45 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @SE7EN777 @andersleijersta The argument from the media is that each ethnicity should be represented proportionately. In which case he’s right. Nothing racist about that. .
1302321917177876490 2020-09-06 03:05:15 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @BethRigby At least it’s something you can get hysterical about! Suggest you read his sister’s statement before you descend into that vortex of hate and venom
1302321393061765121 2020-09-06 03:03:10 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Oh David, my heart breaks for your tragic passing. May those responsible rot in hell. 💔

1302168605468102656 2020-09-05 16:56:03 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @andersleijersta I’ve actually thought that. If it was proportionate can you imagine the football teams? Newscasters, athletes, musicians? ...... go down this path and the outcome will not be good for anyone...
1302167618535686144 2020-09-05 16:52:08 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DawnButlerBrent So shutting down free press (whether they share your views or not) is something Labour support? Blocking ambulances getting to hospitals? Good to know, Dawn.  Just another couple of reasons why UK will ALWAYS reject your kind of politics. ALWAYS.

1302147458697363457 2020-09-05 15:32:01 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Katieraydee I have absolutely no sympathise for these people.  They have absolutely no right to be in UK - let EU take care of them.

1301881572560338944 2020-09-04 21:55:29 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @DailyMailUK No shit, Sherlock!
1301881344914530305 2020-09-04 21:54:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ParveenAtwal3 👏👏👏👍 I think they have tried and some flights have gone by lawyer ‘immigrant chasers’ are using the legal system to stop them.  I’m all for putting them in a ship - one of those enormous ones - anchored some way off the coast. Then easy to up anchor and sail away!
1301880694667440128 2020-09-04 21:52:00 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @turkishmerc @BarristersHorse I see the establishment as the Civil Service, judiciary etc.  government are elected so are already accountable. You really this dense? Seriously?
1301861401225580545 2020-09-04 20:35:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @turkishmerc @BarristersHorse Just to let you know, a strong Opposition is there to hold government to account as well as us the electorate who get to vote every 5 years (at the longest).... not sure you know that so free info for you...
1301861036627234818 2020-09-04 20:33:53 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @turkishmerc @BarristersHorse Why would North Korea be up my street? With a comment like that it shows you to be wholly irrelevant (another way of saying thick). The Court of Appeals was set up by Blair and is most definitely a political body! You really need to open your eyes but I think you’re beyond help
1301794679613202433 2020-09-04 16:10:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @turkishmerc @BarristersHorse I’m sorry you think like that but you need to have your eyes wide open.... it is dangerous times when the ‘establishment’ are being held to account.  Cornered rats become vicious. Don’t buy into their narrative!
1301772190875082752 2020-09-04 14:40:50 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @turkishmerc @BarristersHorse Unfortunately the judiciary is political which is why it needs a good purge! Let’s have a judiciary that is committed to upholding law &amp; order rather than score points against a government it hates
1301645601420050433 2020-09-04 06:17:49 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @Berumster Another wonderful tweet! Classic!
1301627689388904452 2020-09-04 05:06:38 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @AuschwitzMuseum Unbearable to know the horrors of the last hours of this beautiful child ... heartbreaking 💔💔💔

1301506116287856640 2020-09-03 21:03:33 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LesleyJ85840609 @LeProfMoriarty @debatenothate2 I do look globally but I don’t think it’s a question of left or right.  It’s all about creating a one state world which is why they were in uproar about UKs decision to exit EU. So look to Remainers as a first clue globally.... Obama, Clintons, UN, Blair, Bildersberg....
1301438467520565248 2020-09-03 16:34:44 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ashdownetal @or_dodo Two P &amp; O ferries anchored 5 miles off shore! Or North London? Hampstead? 😂😂
1301433768910127104 2020-09-03 16:16:04 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LoyalDefender2K The massive problem we have is that the judiciary are fervently anti Government. We MUST change laws this autumn or it will be open season on Boris.
1301432827892969472 2020-09-03 16:12:20 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @LeProfMoriarty @debatenothate2 It’s not the government but MSM we are at war with and the appalling organisations they support who are anti Britain and our culture. We have every right to maintain and defend our culture against the haters!
1301432386853441537 2020-09-03 16:10:35 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ashdownetal @or_dodo And I’d be making sure I keep the ones who’ve arrived illegally in one place so easy to extract when time comes.
1301432039007236097 2020-09-03 16:09:12 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ashdownetal @or_dodo Whilst we are still technically going through this ridiculous Transition phase we have no option. Personally I’d bring it to an end now! If Gvt don’t resolve this early 2021 then we can really go for them though....😉
1301431035901681665 2020-09-03 16:05:13 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ashdownetal @or_dodo By the way, love that you identify as a bird! 👏

They literally halted flights out last week! Anger towards the immigrant chasing lawyers! It’s going to be a rough autumn but we need to stick together on this!
1301428240351985667 2020-09-03 15:54:06 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @ashdownetal @or_dodo Direct your anger elsewhere. We must abide by Dublin III regulation until year end. When we do try to ship them out ‘immigrant chaser’ lawyers stop it.  Personally, I’d stick them on a P &amp; O ship moored 5 miles off shore. When processed &amp; find none deserving of asylum, up anchor
1301426839236345857 2020-09-03 15:48:32 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @boblister_poole I’m betting it’s a 24 year old woman..😉

If you truly feel like this then perhaps find somewhere that Africans live as a majority  and rule that country? It may be the only way you find peace of mind. You won’t be able to kill us all!

I lived in KZN in farming community in mid 90s &amp; it was brutal then. Farmers had walkie talkies to speak to/alert each other. It’s not just the killing but the inhuman torture. What kind of savage puts a 12 yr old child in a bath of boiling water?

I saw Brexit as a huge move to distance ourselves from the globalists. I definitely believe that there is evil in the world trying to create one power...

Of course white people are being killed in their sleep, being murdered.  Why is skin colour how you divide people? You are the racist and it will continue to happen to y’all whilst that is ALL you see. I don’t. I see the person first.

I don’t give a damn about the colour of someone’s skin but hitting someone like this is wicked. BLM has stoked racial tensions and used ignorant people to pursue their Marxist agenda. Wake up, you fool!

We nearly lost our Milo, last week who is nearly 13. He’s such a gentle boy (American Spaniel) but I nursed him through and he’s bouncing about again. It did make me think about how unbearable it will be when that time comes....
1300788068073472002 2020-09-01 21:30:17 +0800 <CarolineHutt> @opto_sean What on earth is going on here? Why is skin colour going to drive who is in the top jobs? Shouldn’t it be the most talented and deserving? This is patronising to people of colour and racist to Caucasian people, all of which is unacceptable.
