1340040748574466048 2020-12-19 05:06:25 +0800 <euroswydd658> @RadicalLib That is certainly the case now. If anything, parents should be supplied with funds to pursue their child's education as they see fit. Homeschooled children usually do better, but first single parenthood and the policies that create it need to be removed from society.

1339991929635753984 2020-12-19 01:52:26 +0800 <euroswydd658> Fox News is merely another cog in the machine. The owner of a company discussing potential downsides of the vaccine getting it is merely a way to discredit people who fear side effects and shame them into getting vaccinated.

1339594895523151879 2020-12-17 23:34:46 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 That would contradict a great deal of evidence. Having a high IQ isn't a guarantee of success, it just increases the chances.
1339594011959414786 2020-12-17 23:31:15 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 What it would prove is that when high IQ people dislike something they are pretty good at preventing the success of the person doing the thing they dislike.

1339592240746778626 2020-12-17 23:24:13 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 IQ is important but other factors also matter.
1339592149055107073 2020-12-17 23:23:51 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 We have genetic evidence. And reaction times which are an objective proxy for IQ. Both go in the right direction.
1339591605955616771 2020-12-17 23:21:41 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 Programs can elevate IQ depending on who it targets. Make poorer people have kids then you will reduce societal IQ.

1339590970006892547 2020-12-17 23:19:10 +0800 <euroswydd658> @JOttoPohl1 Ed Dutton explains it in his book "At our Wits End" Evidence shows that IQ has precipitiously declined in the west because of the Industrial revolution. We were 14-15 points smarter in the Victorian period.

1338945474946953217 2020-12-16 04:34:12 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare I don't ignore them, but i think there are other reasons.
1338945060486799362 2020-12-16 04:32:33 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare What i am saying is we must wait for evidence before making over confident assertions about whether something is mostly environmental or inherited. And intelligence is very heritable, Robert Plomin has a paper about 5 significant genetics findings. You'll find information there.
1338944259752280064 2020-12-16 04:29:22 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare You make a lot of assumptions. Let's wait to see the evidence. IQ is 80% heritable for example. Not everything is very environmentally malleable.
1338943629897949190 2020-12-16 04:26:52 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare It does, as people of similar ethnicity have similar genetics.

1338943336451751936 2020-12-16 04:25:42 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare We are talking about kids as young as 3 months. It's a combination of innate predispositions and socialisation. Extreme hereditarianism or environmentalism are both inadequate.
1338942904455196673 2020-12-16 04:23:59 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Nicholas Christakis has recently provided evidence people select for genetic similarity.
1338942701673140226 2020-12-16 04:23:11 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare societal preferences probably do play a role, but are insufficient to fully explain it i suspect.

1338940518164647937 2020-12-16 04:14:30 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Because, people want a non-diverse society because they prefer their own ethnicity.
1338940212718649344 2020-12-16 04:13:17 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Didn't say it was the overall conclusion
1338939537972555778 2020-12-16 04:10:36 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare As i said "suggests"
1338938873561280513 2020-12-16 04:07:58 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare And all the study suggests is there are factors more important than diversity.
1338938773632024576 2020-12-16 04:07:34 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare No you've misunderstood what i've said. I am saying that the question of trust is irrelevant as to whether society should be diverse.
1338938206553706497 2020-12-16 04:05:19 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Just look at the literature indicating toddlers preferences for their ethnic in-group.
1338937987938177024 2020-12-16 04:04:27 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Regardless, questions of trust are irrelevant. Take for example a single family. I will prefer, even when there is a family disagreement to help my relatives and live alongside them than to live with a person outside of my family. The same applies to ethnicity.
1338937245768683520 2020-12-16 04:01:30 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare No, i disagree. People naturally prefer and want to live around their own ethnicity, so dislike it when they are confronted with diversity. Evidence shows people assortatively mate with their own ethnicity, give to the poor based on their ethnicity etc.
1338935894573678594 2020-12-16 03:56:08 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare It's not saying what you think it is saying either. Ethnic diversity is clearly a cause of reduced social trust, but its effect differs based on the social context.
1338934453251403776 2020-12-16 03:50:24 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare So what, it doesn't need to be extreme to present a problem.
1338934308170416131 2020-12-16 03:49:49 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare Yes.
1338934063676067841 2020-12-16 03:48:51 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare The possibility that there may be a bias in a study is not an excuse to dismiss it. Perhaps it's a reason to be a more critical, but not to dismiss it.
1338933683080683520 2020-12-16 03:47:20 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare What you did try and do was hand wave the meta analysis i cited away, because you were under the false impression it was not peer reviewed.
1338933413798014977 2020-12-16 03:46:16 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare As i have said, it still is not an excuse to dismiss non peer reviewed studies. Not being peer reviewed does not mean low quality.

1338932890273337346 2020-12-16 03:44:11 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare It's not an excuse to simply hand wave a study away.
1338932809260433408 2020-12-16 03:43:52 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare  https://t.co/tgZSd7PYmD It really is unreliable as a method.
1338932668134641664 2020-12-16 03:43:18 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare No, whatever the status quo is in a given field.
1338932255033454592 2020-12-16 03:41:40 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare So yes it is peer reviewed. Not that that makes a difference.
1338932081947099136 2020-12-16 03:40:59 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare peer review is biased towards the status quo. "Ethnic Diversity and Social Trust. A Narrative and Meta-Analytical Review", which will be published in Annual Review of Political Science, Vol. 23 in 2020"
1338931586708828160 2020-12-16 03:39:01 +0800 <euroswydd658> @night2020mare I'm not the one cherry picking studies. The overwhelming body of research shows that usually ethnic diversity erodes trust. And a large body of research shows that it predisposes a society to ethnic conflict. Which we are seeing in some areas.

That means less control over the culture, state resources, likely more jobs will be reserved for "minorities" and if the current trend of white demonisation continues then perhaps conflict.

1338236587440701441 2020-12-14 05:37:20 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV And they want the same for others, to be rootless.

1338228759862775808 2020-12-14 05:06:14 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV List of J chinese elites? I'm curious now.
1338228683857743872 2020-12-14 05:05:55 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV J**s exploiting human herds. I have to wonder why they haven't started mixing the Chinese with others. The J are rather mixed themselves it seems, less than half marry other J. That serves as a partial explanation for their desire to destroy other races i suppose.
1338228171489959938 2020-12-14 05:03:53 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV They'll have a hard time with China. The Chinese are very very K strategy, which is genetic, so they will struggle to mix them with others.

1338226381268795394 2020-12-14 04:56:46 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV As i understand it China practices Communism "with Chinese characteristics", which looks nothing like it to me. They seem to be state capitalists now. Anyway, recent events have shown who has greater power in China and its the Han not the J.
1338225267425169408 2020-12-14 04:52:21 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV The Chinese are far more ethnocentric than whites and the J less entrenched in their society. I don't see China being flooded with non-whites, Japan is going to be if according to a recent statement by their minister for foreign affairs.
1338224140239527936 2020-12-14 04:47:52 +0800 <euroswydd658> @SpookyGhost__IV That has changed it would seem. Nevertheless they aren't controlled by them.

If the US crumbles, and it might well do as it is a dying empire, "Globalist" power will be weakened. China will be the next superpower and they are no friends of the J. There's 50 years to go before whites are minority

I don't care for arguments about who is entitled to what. America being transformed into multiethnic society is not good for white people.
1335995672798003203 2020-12-08 01:12:44 +0800 <euroswydd658> It means less space for white people, if more non-whites come into the room then whites will be crowded out.

You may not think it matters but people prefer people who are more similar to them, and there is evidence that this extends to the genetic level. This is the case for all of us to some degree.

Once enough people realise what is going on, and the globalists have played their hand too early, they will have difficulty maintaining control. Once half of people are protesting rather than working the country will come to a halt.
1331345168247697410 2020-11-25 05:13:17 +0800 <euroswydd658> @AdamBanksUK Precisely. The exploitation of human herds, they view us as farmyard animals.

1330261091373420544 2020-11-22 05:25:33 +0800 <euroswydd658> If Trump remains in the White House in January, then globalist power is lessened, and they will appear weak. If Biden is sworn in then his handlers will do anything within their power to ensure that opposition to globalism is crushed.

We are in a situation in which there are no viable candidates who wh*te people can trust so we should really be asking how we can
1330260241523625986 2020-11-22 05:22:11 +0800 <euroswydd658> Many in DR circles have been quite critical of Trump, and rightfully so, but i think it is a bit short sighted to focus only on whether or not he has been beneficial for white people. Trump ultimately has done a great deal to harm our en*mies by helping to delegitimise the media.
