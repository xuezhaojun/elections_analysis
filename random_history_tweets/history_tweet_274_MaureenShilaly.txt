1342309902216286209 2020-12-25 11:23:14 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @DianeBohallGray May the Good Lord, whose birth we celebrate tomorrow, have mercy on you all.
1342309708934340608 2020-12-25 11:22:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @EFFE4USA @reubing It is understandable!  EVERYTHING is at stake.  However, I recommend that tomorrow, on Christmas day, you let it go for the day and put all this in the hands of Our Lord. Honor His birth, and turn this over to Him.  I think you will be surprised.
1342308870077755393 2020-12-25 11:19:08 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @realDonaldTrump God bless you for openly expressing your belief in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and honoring His birth.  May we all take tomorrow to do the same!  I wish you and your family the best Christmas you can have and complete vindication and victory very soon.

We actually engage in it on a daily basis.  Pray for enlightenment as to the Truth so you will not be misled.
1342305360326103042 2020-12-25 11:05:11 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @KentuckyGoddess Breathe slowly and deeply dear.  Place your trust in God's providence- you and your son will be fine.

1342243646230261761 2020-12-25 06:59:57 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> We need to be sure our president remains under law the seated President of this great nation.  It will take a united prayer effort that the lies of evil do not overcome the Truth.  So devote New Year's Day to sincere heartfelt prayer for the salvation of our nation.
1342243062668537856 2020-12-25 06:57:38 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> We need a National Day of Prayer which calls for the support of this President as the legitimate President-elect.  Be united in prayer from the heart.  Prayer changes things. Let's make New Year's Day  this day of prayer-start the year off right!
1342242510073167873 2020-12-25 06:55:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These times require unprecedented unity in prayer.  Our nation is drowning in misinformation and illegitimate election results.  Efforts are underway to dismantle the democracy which was formed by the Hand of God's Will.

1342183872545632259 2020-12-25 03:02:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> To all my long suffering patriotic friends here: let's take tomorrow to abandon politics and focus on the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ.  Let's give him this one day uninterrupted with any other cares or worries that we have and focus on love and gratitude to Him.

1341911968639299587 2020-12-24 09:01:59 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Truth does not change in the face of lies.  Saying that obvious fraud did not take place does not make it a reality.  Neither does the power behind mainstream media change the facts into lies. Truth never changes.  It does not fluctuate to please power or ambition.

1341578368408563712 2020-12-23 10:56:23 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Pray with faith-filled hearts.  Satan is doing everything he can to discourage this.  These days, prayer is our strongest weapon in support of the Truth.  Be valiant and fearless in your prayer effort.
1341578085842477057 2020-12-23 10:55:15 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> God is our strength &amp; provision.  Trust in these Truths.  Be united in them. Our unity is the most important weapon now.  Be united in prayer.  A great weapon of evil is fear which conquers truth &amp; divides.  If you are wasting your time in fear, your prayers will be weakened.
1341577019545563139 2020-12-23 10:51:01 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These lies serve to weaken the spirit of our nation.  In the political world, the father of lies has brought about betrayal of those who are close to our President, undermining a strong effort to expose the fraud of the election.
1341576796286795776 2020-12-23 10:50:08 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Pray for a victory of Truth in this battle of control of our nation. Satan is campaigning against the security of this country by convoluting facts about the coronavirus, distorting the truth of election results, and encouraging fear as to religious gatherings.

1340867400166760453 2020-12-21 11:51:14 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Realize that God's Will in giving you His Son in the manger is a most powerful action and that through His Will anything can be accomplished.  Then, begin a new season - a season of trust in God's Will and the miracle of His Love for all mankind.
1340867031621627905 2020-12-21 11:49:47 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> This should overshadow all the problems in the world.  Prepare a place for Him in your hearts.  Settle your thoughts and emotions in this - the Christmas miracle.

1339680975094210561 2020-12-18 05:16:49 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The entire election process will be forever altered.  The 'president-elect' is not who the people voted for.  He has stated he will not honor the Constitution. He will destroy life right up to the moment of birth.  We have as a President now one of Christian values.  Keep him!
1339680608478486530 2020-12-18 05:15:21 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Persevere in prayer and sacrifice.  The soul of this nation is at stake.  If fraudulent election results are honored, the laws - the checks and balances of this country will be destroyed.  Then you will have a system in place which upholds untruth.

1333620034971766784 2020-12-01 11:52:48 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Therefore, God sends upon them a strong delusion, to make them believe what is false, so that all may be condemned who did not believe the Truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  Thessalonians.
1333619944001564673 2020-12-01 11:52:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are to perish, because they refused to love the Truth and so be saved.

It is a bald faced lie that our president lost this election.  Put your love of our country foremost in your hearts now, and pray daily that we emerge victorious.

The fraud being thrust upon us was not the choice of the majority of the people.  He supports infanticide which is abortion up to the moment of birth.  This would NEVER be the choice of a Christian.
1333618186705637376 2020-12-01 11:45:27 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> It must be one nation under God always.  Borders must be maintained.  Illegal immigrants must be addressed as illegal.

1333618013703168000 2020-12-01 11:44:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Cling to Christian values in the face of the influx of lies put forth by the mainstream media.  It is important that you do not allow righteousness to become compromised.  This country must not lose its identity in the attempts by many to establish a One World Order.

1332339562996228099 2020-11-27 23:04:40 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @JoeT_2 @Sera_Cap Simple.  For one thing, most people would not have believed it because they are so indoctrinated by the MSM.  On the other hand- you can't arrest someone for a crime they INTENDED to commit.  I think he did the smartest thing. Catch them in their own foul web.
1332338576865038338 2020-11-27 23:00:45 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @WhereIsTruth4 I HATE these teasers!
1332338351337316359 2020-11-27 22:59:51 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @burn_loot Probably.  Globalist, yes.  If he ever stops being pro-life and totally against abortion, then I will agree with you.
1332171152224100352 2020-11-27 11:55:27 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @carsen_johnny I find it VERY significant that they chose Gettysburg, don't you?  Gettysburg was the battle that changed the course of the Civil War.   Hmmmmmm.............................ü§îü§îü§î

1332106526983643136 2020-11-27 07:38:40 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> It is much the same with the mass media which uses its influence to mislead millions and to disregard the Truth.  The influence they have is a gift from God  which they have abused.
1332106315062239235 2020-11-27 07:37:49 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Much of this country's and the world's difficulties stem from the misuse of the gifts God has given them.  This election was a prime example.  Technology  was convoluted in its use to elect a person that the majority of the people did not choose.
1332105472816652290 2020-11-27 07:34:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @TRUMPARMY2020 How they believe that pretending to be religious is a good thing is mind boggling.  God will NOT bless this kind of egregious hypocrisy- quite the opposite.
1332105177260838912 2020-11-27 07:33:18 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @mchooyah SO totally with you.  NEVER going there- even if it costs my life.

1331436095414923267 2020-11-25 11:14:36 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @gracelover19301 Not sure really.  But I know that God gave us free will, which He respects, and He will not trespass on that.  So if we have turned away from Him, I don't know what He does in that case.  Or maybe sometimes we pray when we aren't really aware of it?

1331365419647692801 2020-11-25 06:33:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Remember, your earthly existence is a proving ground for your right to be in Heaven with God.  Be mindful of how you treat others, and mindful of your duty to God.  These two things will keep you on the right path.
1331364697266937857 2020-11-25 06:30:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Purgatory holds many souls who did not forgive in their earthly trials. God's Commandments forbid anything that transgresses the Laws of Love - Love God above all else and your neighbor as yourself. Search your hearts and be certain you hold no unforgiveness there.
1331364215223947266 2020-11-25 06:28:59 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> If you live in the Truth, you will not be able to bear grudges. The Truth of obedience to God's Commandments forbids that you hold in your hearts any anger towards one another. This is a pouting spirit which defies Holy Love.

1331363113032151043 2020-11-25 06:24:36 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @DevilDog8541 I pray you will be all right.

1330597239690063873 2020-11-23 03:41:17 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @MrMichaelBurkes Amen to that!
1330597155455852548 2020-11-23 03:40:57 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Our strength is in the Truth. Pray to always see the Truth - search it out and do not be tricked by the media which is an unworthy source of information, to say the least..............
1330596901008396293 2020-11-23 03:39:57 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Have grateful hearts for the freedoms we have been given.  At the same time, take nothing for granted. Our freedoms can easily slip away from us through the dishonest politics which have taken charge of this election.  Do not cease to be patriotic.  Revere our country's history.
1330596510275416069 2020-11-23 03:38:23 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Therefore, look very carefully at who is a leader; for title does not make a person honest.  Only what the person carries in his heart determines his honesty and faithfulness to the Truth.
1330596326397136896 2020-11-23 03:37:40 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Discover the Truth and cling to it  tenaciously.  Do not be talked out of the Truth by anyone - even one of high  station in the world.  This is the hour of great confusion in the world - the time when people who used to be trustworthy have now abandoned the Truth.
1330594927076646919 2020-11-23 03:32:06 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @liquidlaugh Yes- one that follows along the lines of Trump.

1330260758022787072 2020-11-22 05:24:14 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @JordanBrace8 @AngieDibbley I think you have an excellent grasp on things Jordan.  You sure you're only 13?
1330260122980012039 2020-11-22 05:21:43 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @SpurglyD @Sueen9 Yep- that's all folks!
1330247329488777221 2020-11-22 04:30:52 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Be careful of unity in the wrong things - such as the One World Order.  Be united in prayer, faith and Holy Love, which all has God's Approval.  Do not be impressed by any propaganda presented to you as Truth.  Trust in God's Plan.   It is a path away from mainstream society.
1330246889061683205 2020-11-22 04:29:07 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Stay away from mass media, which presents a tainted picture of the reality which is going on.  This same source of news puts the full weight of its influence behind the candidate most controlled by outsiders. Once worthy of your trust, the mass media has become a tool of evil.
1330246686892060672 2020-11-22 04:28:19 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Let your prayers be filled with hope.  Hope is faith in what you do not see.  In the face of the election our nation just experienced, have hope that the fraud which turned the tide will be revealed and Truth will be victorious.  Hope, to be genuine, must be based upon trust.
1330142939947872261 2020-11-21 21:36:04 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @OathKeepingVet Very welcome.
1329998917740744705 2020-11-21 12:03:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> You cannot bargain your way into heaven, or negotiate your way out of hell.
1329998664618663939 2020-11-21 12:02:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Freedom must not die on our watch.  If it does, it will be by our own hand because people who claim faith in God remain uninformed, indifferent,  and uninvolved.
1329998167149043714 2020-11-21 12:00:47 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The whole policy of a socialist government is to suppress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority.
1329997347724660742 2020-11-21 11:57:32 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> To argue with a person who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to the dead.  Thomas Paine.  He must have talked to a lot of liberals, don't you think??

1329995978947104769 2020-11-21 11:52:06 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> In the beginning of a change, the patriot is a scarce man-brave &amp; hated &amp; scorned.When his cause succeeds the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.  Mark Twain  Sound familiar?
1329995236697837569 2020-11-21 11:49:09 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @eveforamerica Yep.  Before liberals got too much power.

1329989914075787265 2020-11-21 11:28:00 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Cointuckeywind1 I do too.
1329945939092639745 2020-11-21 08:33:15 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not feel you are safe under the cover of darkness.  God is All-Knowing and Omnipotent.   There is no victory in evil - only defeat.  God Knows ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
1329945561613676544 2020-11-21 08:31:45 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The power of any official of government is always subject to God's Judgment just like anyone else.  In the end, it does not matter how much power, authority or wealth you had in the world.  What is in your favor is how you used any of your attributes to serve God and man.
1329945228967628801 2020-11-21 08:30:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These of great influence carry the weight of the scale of honesty versus dishonesty in every present moment.  Some of great influence cause others to slip to their perdition by their dictates.  Pay attention as to whom you pay allegiance.
1329944994845745152 2020-11-21 08:29:30 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Nothing remains hidden from God.  Sooner or later all evil is exposed by the light of Truth.  Ill-gotten gain will convict souls at their judgment.  Those in high places who influence thousands of souls have much to answer for.
1329942822414323713 2020-11-21 08:20:52 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @ksorbs Glad to know there are still caring parents out there who discipline their children.  Good for you!

1329941341007208450 2020-11-21 08:14:59 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @NaturalHairGurl Turn it over to Jesus.  Pour out your heart to Him- He will hear you.  Hang in there dear- we care.  Never take a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Not making light of it at all- just reminding you that things always change.

1329794543013814279 2020-11-20 22:31:40 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @DineshDSouza I don't think Tucker did anything wrong.  Think he was hoping to get the exclusive of all exclusives- but Sidney Powell knows what she is doing and releasing that information ahead of time would have been a HUGE mistake. We'll have to be patient.

1329597555395743749 2020-11-20 09:28:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not be a victim of this latest campaign against national pride.  Be thankful for God's generosity to us.  Do not allow your opinions to be formed by leftist propaganda.  With patriotic pride, celebrate Thanksgiving.
1329596954540699659 2020-11-20 09:26:31 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Thanksgiving hearkens back to the founding of our country, when the pilgrims gathered to celebrate their God-given harvest. The leftists do not want people to gather in thanksgiving for God's provision so they are using COVID as a reason  to shut down  this holiday.
1329596290825658378 2020-11-20 09:23:53 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These days, everything that smacks of national pride is under attack by Satan and the leftists, who seek to destroy our national identity.  This is their way of promoting the One World Order.  The celebration of Thanksgiving is their latest victim of attack.

1329266005252698113 2020-11-19 11:31:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not depend upon mass media anymore to receive the news.  What you are listening to is propaganda.  If need be, the time for Truth to go underground may come.  So be it.  We are not there yet.  Pray that our President does not concede, but uncovers the Truth of his victory.
1329265616671420416 2020-11-19 11:29:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> This is the time in history when union in prayer is most important.  Our country, our lives, our future hang in the balance.  Become a prayer warrior.
1329265273640284166 2020-11-19 11:28:32 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Standing in the wings is a lineup of evil - ready to step into ill-gotten power.  They have plans to trample the Constitution, leaving those who support the Truth powerless.  But we hold the greatest weapon of all in our hearts when we pray.  This weapon cannot be defeated.

1327958380728766465 2020-11-15 20:55:24 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The enemy of our freedoms - the liberalists - are trying to destroy the patriotism in the hearts of all Americans.  In so doing they are opening the door to the One World Order.   Do not be influenced by those trying to destroy the image of the USA-they are seeking its downfall.
1327957422804242432 2020-11-15 20:51:36 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Once again, I warn you, be careful as to what and who unites you - be united in prayer - be united as a free nation.  Do not be united as part of a One World Order which paves the way for the Antichrist.
1327957180025286657 2020-11-15 20:50:38 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The media is controlled by outside forces - forces with their own agenda for the future of the world.  If this falsely chosen candidate is placed in the White House, we will slowly see our nation lose its identity in favor of global policies.  We MUST remain an independent nation
1327814903722364928 2020-11-15 11:25:17 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Maw2Tu @GovMikeDeWine THIS IS WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DO!!  DICTATOR GOVERNORS NEED TO MEET CONSTITUTIONAL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE!!   The HELL with this crap!!!!!!!!!!!!
1327813965729173506 2020-11-15 11:21:33 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Proud Boys:   you are very appropriately named!!!  You did yourselves proud and we are proud of you!  God bless you!!
1327813433744613376 2020-11-15 11:19:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @aloverofblue Some of the greatest people in our nation are the ones that are largely ignored.............
1327812613976305664 2020-11-15 11:16:11 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @realDonaldTrump God bless you President Trump!  MILLIONS of us would have loved to be able to be there today to show our support for you.  I hope you feel now that the countless sacrifices you have made for us were not in vain.
1327810981548990464 2020-11-15 11:09:42 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @V_actually Hedy Lamar.  A beautiful and brilliant woman.

1327762203546705922 2020-11-15 07:55:52 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Have the courage to stand together in righteousness through prayer.  This is the path of victory. The hope of the future of the world is through this prayer effort which will lead to a God-fearing victory.
1327761982892761090 2020-11-15 07:55:00 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Without borders, we lose America.  Take pride in the safety of law and order, without which we have anarchy.  Show respect for one another by leading a law-abiding life.  Pay attention as to where liberalism - progressivism is trying to lead us.
1327761664125640704 2020-11-15 07:53:44 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The One World Order lays bare the path for the Antichrist.  The lawless one desires the singular leadership of all people and every nation in order to lead every soul to his perdition.  Do not lose track of your national pride.  Do not favor the loss of our borders.

1326717737620606977 2020-11-12 10:45:32 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @RodentStill Nice!

1326644938830974976 2020-11-12 05:56:15 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @pushforward40 @realDonaldTrump Me too
1326639802142240769 2020-11-12 05:35:51 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Truckers declare strike against Biden policy threats: We STOP ALL TIRES on Veterans Day, and more to come  https://t.co/b40yPZeH3s via @BIZPACReview
1326634915388076034 2020-11-12 05:16:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The enemy is intent on destroying this country from within as he knows a frontal attack would never be successful.  Do not be weakened by misinformation.  Be firm in your resolve to remain one nation under God - never influenced by Satan's tactics which are presented as 'truth'.
1326634666854649857 2020-11-12 05:15:26 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Those of you who are convinced of the Truth must remain united through prayer.  At stake is the Constitution and the freedoms which it outlines.  This whole 'election' process has challenged the basic premise of rights that our nation was founded on.
1326634407822827520 2020-11-12 05:14:25 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not lose heart.  Pray that the moral fiber of this nation will be substantiated by Truthful findings in this investigation.  I applaud our sitting President that he has not surrendered his office in this travesty called an 'election'.
1326634040171110400 2020-11-12 05:12:57 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The one who is appointed the 'winner' in this election is not the one who will make decisions. There is a whole machine of evil hidden in the background who would do this.  This nation's victory is in exposing the evil which changed the votes to bring an illicit victory to him.
1326633566567075846 2020-11-12 05:11:04 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> This is not a battle fought with weapons, but one fought with technology put to evil use. Peacefully unite in the truth.  Protect the Truth by speaking out for your freedoms.  Unite in the Truth, not in error.  In this unity is our strength in supporting the Truth &amp; righteousness
1326632952374177794 2020-11-12 05:08:38 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Their bid to power has the intention of taking away freedoms from the citizens of this nation. Too many lives have been lost in our history  in order to protect freedoms that other countries wish they had, for a pocket of evil to destroy everything those wars were fought for.
1326632495954227202 2020-11-12 05:06:49 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The loser in this Presidential election was the Truth.  The one who proclaims to be the winner is united not to the people of this nation, but to evil forces who have dishonestly altered the results of the election.

1326520517285785602 2020-11-11 21:41:51 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> As critical as 2016 was, this is far more so.  It will determine whether we are the USA as we have always been, or will be  flushed down the socialist toilet.  As we celebrate our veterans- remember what they died for. FREEDOM! LIBERTY!  We will NOT dishonor them now!

I changed the spelling to Shilaly to make it a name.  It is pronounced the same.  Thought it would be appropriate in the current political environment.

1325924005556195328 2020-11-10 06:11:32 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @p3driver @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi I just said a great prayer, if I do say so myself.  Let us join all our prayers together so that heaven may not refuse us.
1325922877615562752 2020-11-10 06:07:03 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Soultry4 Look how they treated us before- is anyone actually stupid enough to believe it would be better AFTER this?

1325907546796908550 2020-11-10 05:06:07 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @realDonaldTrump  DON'T GIVE IN MR. PRESIDENT!!  WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP!! WE SUPPORT YOU 1000%! This is the most egregious attack on our nation EVER- far greater than 9/11. This was a TOTAL inside job by one of the two big political parties, who all need to be held accountable!

What an incredibly beautiful response to a person who had been deceived about Trump and the rest of us.  You are a shining example of what God wants us to do.
1325626388611801088 2020-11-09 10:28:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @RonaldBruceBar3 Go for it.  Who cares if you do that?

1325568938005159938 2020-11-09 06:40:37 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not underestimate the opposition - who stands poised to defeat every good intention towards freedom.  Embrace righteous courage.  Fight this war peacefully in the confines of your heart.
1325568746723962880 2020-11-09 06:39:51 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Be united in prayer, as prayer is our pathway to victory.  Unity in good is your army of strength.  Our united prayer effort is the weapon of this army.  Now is the hour of great value when we must draw upon our weapons - prayer, rosaries and sacrifices .
1325550806339379207 2020-11-09 05:28:34 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @realDonaldTrump DO. NOT. QUIT!!!!  You know very well this was the most outrageous act of our D seditionists and traitors- you have brought us too far to stop now.  Expose the fraud! Arrest the traitors! Return to the job the Good Lord wants you to do.

1325134114635337728 2020-11-08 01:52:47 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The election results are illicit &amp; do not reflect the heart of this nation. Nefarious efforts worked in the background to undermine the Truth.  Exert your prayer efforts that our President is successful in exposing evil plans.  Our nation needs to unite in this prayer!
1325132967681781763 2020-11-08 01:48:13 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Yes, that's right.  This is FAR from over- it has only just begun.
1325091756686385154 2020-11-07 23:04:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Jennyjen010 All, would be a safe guess.
1325055757264498688 2020-11-07 20:41:25 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi Could be.   But even patients with bad Alzheimer's have been reported to be occasionally lucid.
1325053493045030912 2020-11-07 20:32:25 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @ski_nh Yes I have seen that too.  So scientists did an experiment with the monkeys and found that they totally wrecked the machines and crapped all over the place in a pretty short time span.  Don't know who came up with that one but they were talking out of their ass.
1325052981247668224 2020-11-07 20:30:23 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @SJPFISH Hang in there.  This isn't over by a long shot.
1325052863597391874 2020-11-07 20:29:55 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi No I don't think so.  I've looked at pictures of him, at his eyes, and the lights may be on but he is definitely not at home.  And let's face it- someone in that condition is much easier to manipulate.

These foul mouthed self important narcissistic know-nothings seem to think that we actually CARE what they think!!  You could have the world's most powerful electron microscope and look through it for hours and still not be able to detect my interest in them.

1324545955757252608 2020-11-06 10:55:39 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Remember always, prayer changes things.  Continue to pray that your decisions bear good fruit - fruit that builds up God's Kingdom on earth.  Fruit that is like the ballast of the ship of honest government moving through the waves of confusion.
1324545646209179648 2020-11-06 10:54:25 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Those who cannot discern the difference between good and evil lend support to evil causes.  This is highlighted most recently in the election process we are experiencing. One of the candidates is only a front for powerful forces in the background.  The na√Øve voter doesn't see it.
1324543585186959360 2020-11-06 10:46:14 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @FetusFormer Who the hell is this little creep to say any such thing?  I am SO done with her interference!  She is nothing but a useful shill and needs to go back home and stay out of our business.

1324542400354803714 2020-11-06 10:41:31 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @ajalsevac That's it, and also the fact that the stakes are incredibly high.  I know that God will intercede and help but it makes things tough when He seems to take His good old time about it!!

1324540788152422400 2020-11-06 10:35:07 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @JordanBrace8 Sadly, people do that.  I honestly think they are unhappy people who feel the need to control other people to make themselves feel better.  Don't worry Jordan- just ignore the mean things and move on.  You will come across them all your life- don't let them discourage you.

1324424399034998784 2020-11-06 02:52:38 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> IMO- the demoncrats overplayed their hand again.  In an effort to commit fraud and steal the election, they have gone so far overboard that the fraud is visible to even the dullest witted out there.We needed this to do a massive cleanup that would not have been possible before.

1324096365337681928 2020-11-05 05:09:08 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> We must continue to pray constantly for our country, especially now. The fraud we feared has come, it must be dealt with.  Pray more than ever that truth will come to light, and the real victor of this race is President Trump.
1324095886163587074 2020-11-05 05:07:14 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Today, as our country faces so many uncertainties, I call you to be united in prayerful hope for a secure future under traditional leadership.

1323625822201303046 2020-11-03 21:59:22 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @RealJamesWoods Yes.  God made one thing very very clear: JUDGE NOT THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE JUDGED! For the measure you use against others will be the measure used against you.  How many judgmental hypocrites will be able to stand up to that when their turn comes?

1323412737192566788 2020-11-03 07:52:39 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not be fooled by the empty promises of those who are ambitious only for themselves.  Often what is seen in the foreground is negated by an evil hidden agenda - one that transgresses the rights of others.  Be wise enough to understand this.

1322877696985174024 2020-11-01 20:26:35 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @domenicadelia22 I believe it.  Haven't liked Francis from the get go. But it is God's Church- nothing happens that He doesn't allow. Jesus even warned that satan would sit on the throne of Peter.  Everything going on, He knows about.  I trust Him.  I follow His Word, not people's.

What is remarkable is the fact that so many people do not pick up on that.  So many just see politics and not the forces between good and evil trying to hold the upper hand in the future of this nation.

1321538811613118464 2020-10-29 03:46:20 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> An agenda of the New World Order is to take down civil authority - the police - so that their own form of law and order can move in.  This election is for or against the New World Order.  Do not allow democracy - so long fought for - to be shredded.  Spread this Truth.
1321538376575713286 2020-10-29 03:44:36 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The New World Order is based upon lies.  Proponents of this lie see the U.S. Constitution as a threat to their agenda.  Therefore, they go about trying to destroy national pride and promote anarchy.

1321277965456576513 2020-10-28 10:29:49 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Understand that we need a strong leader - one devoted to all that our nation was founded upon.  Progressiveness is a byword for weak leadership and an excuse for promoting mayhem and lawlessness to the detriment of our citizens. Vote our only choice- Donald Trump.
1321277270611402759 2020-10-28 10:27:04 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Our Constitution is a model for other nations to implement in their own governments.  It is a grave error to see it as an obstacle to freedom &amp; dismantle it.  It stands to reason that our choices for leadership should use the Constitution as a firm foundation of law and order.
1321276821648908290 2020-10-28 10:25:17 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The goals of this country are peace and security.  So we do not want to elect leaders who would dismantle these goals.   This nation is a leader in the free world.  It must be an example of freedom to less fortunate nations - nations who lack the natural resources we are rich in.

1319096197559291904 2020-10-22 10:00:15 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The whole idea of weakening the police and taking away peoples' right to defend themselves is a recipe for chaos.  Law and order is not a political issue, as some would have it.  It is a necessity to peace of mind and soul.  The radicals feel called to make an uproar in society.

The thing that is controlling you is your own fear-keep telling yourself that the problem is your fear and that you can conquer it.  Little steps at a time.

Do not be manipulated by a figurehead who seems to have the polls in his favor.  Put your choice to good use and vote for the one who loves this country and who protects life.
1317574656950521858 2020-10-18 05:14:12 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not believe or be misled by polls in this presidential race.  An official poll does not represent what is in hearts across America.  Have faith that all things are possible and keep praying.  Remember always that it is Satan who is the king of lies.

1317292882131386368 2020-10-17 10:34:31 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> It is your right as a citizen to choose a leader who embraces the Constitution.  Pray to choose the candidates who will make good choices for you - choices that support your freedoms which so many have died for.  Choices which embrace the Truth and support the right to life.
1317291786335866881 2020-10-17 10:30:10 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Take for instance, the controversy over our right to bear arms.  That is in our Constitution in the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted to protect this right.  They fled from a land where they were not allowed to have guns.  Be very certain that you protect this right!
1317291353139720192 2020-10-17 10:28:27 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> A leader makes decisions for all his followers.  His decisions can be either good or bad.  If you are given the opportunity to choose a leader - such as we are in this free nation, make certain you are choosing a leader who will embrace your freedoms.

This election is for or against the New World Order.  Do not allow democracy - so long fought for - to be shredded.  Spread this Truth.

1314373955743092737 2020-10-09 09:15:45 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> God has given you ten rules of conduct including the rules of Holy Love.  Trying to redefine them is not an option.  Everything in your life - victories and failures - should be a reflection of your obedience to these Commandments. This will determine your place for all eternity.
1314373499499274240 2020-10-09 09:13:56 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> God's promise of Paradise, if you please Him by obeying His Commandments, is all Truth.  You cannot negotiate with God.  It will be too late for false promises.  The Truth is each present moment builds a case for or against your salvation.  There will be no debate.

It could make all the difference. Please consider it- it doesn't take long to recite on the rosary beads.

1311491522718728192 2020-10-01 10:22:00 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These days, elected officials do not, for the most part, establish a good relationship with God to help them in their official duties.  Some use their office towards personal gain.  Many have personal agendas hidden in the background.  Prayer will help you to uncover the Truth.
1311491240802881536 2020-10-01 10:20:52 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> A good prayer life helps you to treat each other with respect.  It is through prayer God's Divine Will becomes clear to you.  It is then you will know how to handle each challenge.  Prayer is the way to unite our nation.

1309652605300342784 2020-09-26 08:34:47 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Violence is never a solution, but a problem. At the same time, you cannot 'sit on the fence' on major issues. Not to decide - is to decide. Truth is so often the delicate balance which opposes evil. Faithful trust in God settles many a confusion.

You can't change yourself to please everyone so stick to who you are and don't try to please everyone because then you will please no one-especially yourself.

She was instrumental in promoting the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent unborn babies.  That is NOT what a 'hero' does!  Shame on these people!

1308224614385037312 2020-09-22 10:00:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> This is without regard for consequences to others.  The very structure of law and order is under attack.  Do not think for a minute that this type of 'freedom' leads to happiness and security.
1308224469006155779 2020-09-22 09:59:53 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The term freedom has been misused in these times and has led to violence and chaos.  This is not the type of freedom our forefathers sought when they fled tyranny to come here and establish a free nation.  Freedom today is a catchword for doing whatever strikes your fancy.

1307817001541341184 2020-09-21 07:00:45 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @TheyCallMeTomO1 Probably.
1307816533872254982 2020-09-21 06:58:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> People must understand that abortion is murder.  Murder is against God's Commandments. Decades ago, belief in abortion would have horrified the general public.  This is how distorted the morality of the heart of the world has become.
1307815999408951303 2020-09-21 06:56:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Take a stance.  Be a soldier of Truth.  Then, when you stand before the Judgment Seat of Jesus,  you will not be condemned for this heinous crime of abortion.
1307815811629953025 2020-09-21 06:56:02 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> It is the job of every Christian to reverse the degeneration of modern-day morality. Do this through prayer and standing for the Truth of what abortion really is.  Do not allow the Truth to be hidden and held in derision and compromised, as it is these days.  Take a stance.

1307381117234876419 2020-09-20 02:08:42 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @MFGGABE Still no. Everyone  goes through different kinds of hell in this life. They endure tragedies they never wanted but must learn to deal with.  This would be one.  Killing the most innocent victim of this crime would heal nothing.
1307337889022386178 2020-09-19 23:16:56 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @_EdEdge_ How can we even believe it was said?  And sorry- she had no right to say it.  All this tells me is that there is massive voter fraud which the dems believe will flip the election.  Prove me wrong.

1307337376012918785 2020-09-19 23:14:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @MFGGABE No.  As horrible as it would be, the baby is still the most innocent victim in all of this.  If not wanted, the baby can be given up for adoption.

1306035508431159297 2020-09-16 09:01:44 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Do not place in public office a person who is a puppet for evil.  Records of service should outline good versus evil for you. Be wise enough not to compound problems by your support of candidates who disrespect good. Those in public service should first serve God &amp; then country.
1306034759005622272 2020-09-16 08:58:46 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Treasure the legal rights our forefathers have preserved for us.  They did so as they fled tyranny in their homelands.  This nation has always been a refuge of peace and security.  Now, Satan is trying to change it into a hotbed of confusion.
1306034363658838022 2020-09-16 08:57:11 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> These times are brutal towards people's disregard for God's Commandments.  This disrespect has led to abortion - a heinous crime which is regarded as a right legally.  This could only happen in a population that cannot distinguish good from evil.

1305487260079607809 2020-09-14 20:43:12 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @TedKatya @CallingDrLove69 I'd be happy to follow you but it looks like you are one of the ones that ask for followers yet don't return the favor.  Until you do, I can't follow you.
1305486573497131009 2020-09-14 20:40:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @KiousErica Yes you absolutely did.  Don't be discouraged.  It's obvious they were only your 'friends' if you behaved the way they wanted you to.  Those aren't real friends- real ones take you warts and all.
1305486226129117186 2020-09-14 20:39:05 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @CallingDrLove69 Let's face it- any anarchy anywhere is probably being financed by them both.

1304420948247011331 2020-09-11 22:06:03 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @JablomeJack I think the 40s is the best decade.  Young enough to still look good and be very active, but a lot smarter than you were when younger.  Enjoy it!

1304251194068668418 2020-09-11 10:51:31 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Natural resources are very often held in ransom.  Political differences carry the responsibility of shaping the future of the world in their final resolution.  Because man has such power and knowledge to create and destroy, what he carries in his heart is of great importance.
1304250989676040195 2020-09-11 10:50:42 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> As it is, we  have a pandemic, natural disasters of unprecedented proportions and rising friction amongst nations with grave consequences if they are unresolved.
1304250677917614086 2020-09-11 10:49:28 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> We are approaching the most serious times in all of history.  God's Justice is far reaching. It is already present in a diminished way all over the earth.  If all would pay attention &amp; heed the signs of the times, God would pay attention to their repentance &amp; lessen His Justice.

1303392234088419329 2020-09-09 01:58:19 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @alliemarie777 Totally agree.   But only about 15% of people vote in their primary elections- HUGE mistake.  Besides choosing candidates, there are local issues which affect you directly yet 85% of voters don't go.  Really can't understand that- disappointing and infuriating.

If you leave them and make your own life it's a bad thing? Who is the one with the real problem here?
1303331608792047621 2020-09-08 21:57:24 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @realDonaldTrump @DebbyShultz Doubt that.  In an honest election you would have a Reagan landslide but in these times with evil, corrupt democrats it's a different story.  Got to deal with this NOW!!!!!!!

1301712188239998976 2020-09-04 10:42:24 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> In fact, they are being led by evil to choose violence over law and order.  These protests are politically motivated.  While the protesters think they are helping others, they do not look ahead to see the long-term effects of such social disorder.
1301712014419660807 2020-09-04 10:41:43 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> People of power are trying to erase concern for others and to change the heart of this nation into a nation which does not see the consequences of their actions.  People think by pursuing unwarranted violent protests they are changing the nation for the better.
1301711558238760960 2020-09-04 10:39:54 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Pray that the heart of this nation receives spiritual insight as to what and who is inspiring this unprecedented violence. This is a call to recognize the Truth of who is instigating all this disorder.

1301349012054966284 2020-09-03 10:39:17 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Pray for those who are so ambitious  they embrace liberalism.  This only impresses those who are already compromising the Truth.  Some try to make the word conservative a negative word.  In God's Eyes a conservative is one who is not fooled by rhetoric.

1301348323606114304 2020-09-03 10:36:32 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Some politicians regard the Truth as the enemy &amp; a challenge to overcome.  The sincere candidate for any office safeguards the Truth &amp; lives accordingly. This needs to be the goal of all people everywhere.  To choose otherwise &amp; to compromise the Truth is to live a dishonest life

1300956485980168192 2020-09-02 08:39:31 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> Be courageous and make courageous, mature and wise decisions when you vote.  Do not vote your freedoms away.  Vote to protect what you have as God-given rights.  You do not need to be led by someone who endorses disobedience to Them.  It only takes you down the wrong path.
1300955860232032256 2020-09-02 08:37:02 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> All common everyday activity is given over to mob rule.  Do not vote such a mentality into political power. Defunding the police, the ones who safeguard our freedoms and protect law and order, can be likened to the teenage mentality of  rebelling against authority.
1300955331758039040 2020-09-02 08:34:56 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> The 'progressive candidate' in his leniency towards law &amp; order will threaten your freedoms.  Take for example 'sanctuary cities'.  These are in fact pockets of debauchery where anything goes. No one can be safe in such an environment.
1300954923216101376 2020-09-02 08:33:18 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> During this age when even law and order is up for grabs, you should expect a 'progressive candidate' to be irresponsible or completely negligent  in bringing violent perpetrators to justice.
1300954669867565058 2020-09-02 08:32:18 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> When you embrace a candidate, it is an outward sign of your approval of his agenda.  Do not be tricked by political vocabulary.  If the candidate proclaims to be a progressive, he is telling you to expect a loose conscience as to his concerns for the consequences of his actions.

It's like the democrats calling everyone and everything racist.  Be mindful of WHO is doing the name calling, and their right to do it.  A terrorists name calling has NO VALIDITY!!
1300952401000751105 2020-09-02 08:23:17 +0800 <MaureenShilaly> @greggutfeld @Pdean93614864 If being a vigilante is illegal, but you are called a vigilante by those who are blatant criminals intent on doing harm to you  and/or your property,  where is the validation of their claim?  You are not attacking them- you are exercising your God given right to self defense.
