1343589349930237954 2020-12-29 00:07:18 +0800 <Kezimunka61> You stated that wearing a mask has great impact. I assume that you mean it stops or mitigates the virus from coming in, or going out or both. Which kind of mask? My understanding is that only a medical hazmat type of suit is fully capable of protection from biohazards. Cloth, no.

1308140978914680833 2020-09-22 04:28:08 +0800 <Kezimunka61> Actually, I would bet that Justice Scalia's last thought was to forgive the POS that smothered him.
1308136972167319553 2020-09-22 04:12:12 +0800 <Kezimunka61> He must be So Proud.
1307693498171379712 2020-09-20 22:50:00 +0800 <Kezimunka61> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Thank you for standing with President Trump on the upcoming nomination for SC. You were incredible in the Kavanaugh hearings - I know we can count on you!

1306789688661942272 2020-09-18 10:58:35 +0800 <Kezimunka61> Sincerest condolences Kyle and Genece. I will pray for Jonathan tonight. God bless your family.
1306656687227637761 2020-09-18 02:10:05 +0800 <Kezimunka61> No, but he has a good sense of humor!
1306648886845624327 2020-09-18 01:39:05 +0800 <Kezimunka61> More proof that democrats have no sense of humor. This is from a parody group called 'The United Spot'. Lighten up.
1305712375291576320 2020-09-15 11:37:43 +0800 <Kezimunka61> "Is the Pope Catholic?".......oh, never mind.

1305707769367015430 2020-09-15 11:19:25 +0800 <Kezimunka61> It never goes away because he never apologized. He never really thought a thing about it OR you!!!  And he has the cajones to brag about some toothless *act*?? God KNOWS who he is. Bill Clinton will be called to account!

1304162482781589505 2020-09-11 04:59:00 +0800 <Kezimunka61> I wonder why???
1304162077871943682 2020-09-11 04:57:24 +0800 <Kezimunka61> finally!
1304161596927807490 2020-09-11 04:55:29 +0800 <Kezimunka61> yes
1304160838794780672 2020-09-11 04:52:28 +0800 <Kezimunka61> Two of the reasons I quite Netflix.
1304160473353515010 2020-09-11 04:51:01 +0800 <Kezimunka61> They went out with modernism, socialism, communism, marxism.
1304159993051123714 2020-09-11 04:49:07 +0800 <Kezimunka61> EXACTLY
1304159902580051969 2020-09-11 04:48:45 +0800 <Kezimunka61> Haven't seen this...but when @ScottAdamsSays won't even describe it in condemning it - you know it's something so horrific that it must come straight from hell! #cancelnetflixnow
1303924850168340480 2020-09-10 13:14:44 +0800 <Kezimunka61> And many a priest, cardinal and pope is in Hell. But they were all Catholic...
1303922809891033088 2020-09-10 13:06:38 +0800 <Kezimunka61> When both parties hold the same Christian values - I have no problem with your assertion. But when one party espouses satanic values, our priests are BOUND to speak up against them! God Bless Father James Altman.

1301752422398939136 2020-09-04 13:22:17 +0800 <Kezimunka61> You bet I am invested. In the truth. And regardless of Mr. Flynn's *reluctant* comments below - I will take the word of my pastor, who is a good &amp; holy priest, over his.
1301733842768846848 2020-09-04 12:08:27 +0800 <Kezimunka61> @TaylorRMarshall @BackwardsFeet @meaningofcath JD Flynn/CNA has put a target on the backs of one of our priests at Our Lady of Mount Carmel parish in Littleton, Co? He/they have doxxed Father Daniel Nolan &amp; our parish without giving the pastor, Father Jackson, time to look into it &amp; respond. Thoughts?   https://t.co/hqjofWtrtV
1301731165812994054 2020-09-04 11:57:49 +0800 <Kezimunka61> It was NOT a bare recitation of the facts at all. Father Nolan's words were taken out of context. Our pastor was asked for a comment, but not given the time to view the video or speak with Father Nolan before CNA published, putting a target on our priests &amp; our parish! Why?

1301556557617004544 2020-09-04 00:23:59 +0800 <Kezimunka61> Congratulations Mr Flynn! “What Mr. Flynn did was bring an isolated case, taken out of context, to the public and has caused great scandal and distress in my parish”.             And BTW you have put a target on our parish and every parishioner at OLMC.
1301372479643021313 2020-09-03 12:12:32 +0800 <Kezimunka61> That explains why you wrote a piece in CNA targeting one Father Daniel Nolan. You should know that untold numbers of rosaries are being said for him tonight. You should be ashamed...
