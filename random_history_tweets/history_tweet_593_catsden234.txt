1337066687154311170 2020-12-11 00:08:34 +0800 <catsden234> Want to know why Covid relief being held up? Because moscow mitch insists that corperations (that he gets money from) get a free pass. (as usual). Thats what the *liability* proection is about. That way they don't have to even try to protect employees, clients, even nsh home pts!

1330604308262490115 2020-11-23 04:09:23 +0800 <catsden234> @ConnieG1025 The peoplem in part is there is no republican party. Just a trump cult. Bravo to those few that have found their spines and are speaking out. If all the cult would stand up to him it would take his power away. But they are still without difnity, honor or concern. Still spineless

1330596264287891462 2020-11-23 03:37:25 +0800 <catsden234> The judges are starting to dismiss the cases *with predejuce* which means they can't keep filing same shit over and over. I think the judges have had enough. Thank God our judges have sense and are upholding the law!

1330595037973983234 2020-11-23 03:32:32 +0800 <catsden234> NO the man tried to destroy our country. I think he needs to be jailed. The message needs to be sent, THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. Enough of trumps shit has been normalized!

1321139537783988224 2020-10-28 01:19:46 +0800 <catsden234> So millions will lose insurance and coverage. If trump wins he'll get rid of social security and medicare leaving us no way to survive and live!!!
1321139087802290176 2020-10-28 01:17:58 +0800 <catsden234> SENIORS: Trump has done nothing during this pandemic except have *super spreader* rallies. So now hospitals are getting over capicity. You do realize that emergency choices mean the young get treated. The old get sent home to die. Soon trump will get rid of ACA.

1321136934106894344 2020-10-28 01:09:25 +0800 <catsden234> I worked psych for years. Including forensic. We would have patients break things and come at us with sharp objects. Not one in those 16 years did we have to call p.s. to shoot someone. Not once did anyone end up dead. Injuries sometimes, yes. But everyone was alive when done.

1319106115318185986 2020-10-22 10:39:40 +0800 <catsden234> Wray said they've been working on infrastructure around voting. Apparently not so much as we're still getting hacked! Ratcliff purposefully down played russia. When we all know they are interfering! Guess thats what master trump told him to do. And threats to democrats.

1316783901818466304 2020-10-16 00:52:01 +0800 <catsden234> So as he sees he's losing, he will get worse and there will be more violence and chaos. He's  already called his followers to arms.

He's already begun by cutting the tax where our our payments come from!!!  After killing ACA Covid hits us and ppl of color the hardest. Were all disposable!!!
1316777093397708801 2020-10-16 00:24:58 +0800 <catsden234> Kentuckians are in food lines, kids can't go to school, and live in fear of losing homes. Apparently mitch thinks thats funny!

1316214407664414720 2020-10-14 11:09:03 +0800 <catsden234> This is why trumps xray doctor ( no experience in public health or epidemiology) told him. Trump was looking for the perfect excuse to continue to let covid run rampant. EVERY ACTUAL EXPERT is against this and nicely says its insane! So rid of ACA, rid of social security medicair
1316213226997272581 2020-10-14 11:04:22 +0800 <catsden234> Well it's official. Trump is going for herd immunity. But they didn't mentions couple of MILLION have to DIE! If I remember how this works, at LEAST 70% of the population would have to GET covid. What ever our ratio of death is  lets say 2% would die. You do the math!

He's ignored ky for years concerned only with building his power and making himself richer, with the help of RUSSIA. We know russia intereferes with election
1316096100936359936 2020-10-14 03:18:57 +0800 <catsden234> KENTUCKIANS; mcconnell says hes done a great job at covid. Still in step with trump. I think the families and friends of 215,000 +DEAD would disagree. His ONLY priority is getting their handmaiden judge through. He and trump want to kill ACA then get rid of social security!
1316094725640855552 2020-10-14 03:13:29 +0800 <catsden234> Anyone watch the debate? All mcconnell could come up with was that she would hand the sanate over to schumer.

1315339962037010439 2020-10-12 01:14:19 +0800 <catsden234> While Amy Mcgraff was boarding a plane to fight for our country, mitch was making deals with russia to get richer. Mitch too obsessed with getting his handmaiden judge in to get rid of healthcare for millions. ky stands in food lines and scared of losing homes.
1315337575801016320 2020-10-12 01:04:50 +0800 <catsden234> Mitch mcconnell still fighting hero's act bc trump doesn't want to help *blue* states. How petty. 215,000 dead. Mitch cares about stacking courts. NOT ABOUT HELPING KENTUCKIANS! Trump stays in power, mitch gets richer. Doesn't care about kentuckians!  https://t.co/r9hMKXJf7a
1315336175410962433 2020-10-12 00:59:16 +0800 <catsden234> All trumps got is LIE DENY BLAME DISTRACT He has spewed hate and fear x 4 years to scare everybody.  He has done nothing but lie! 215,000 dead, most because of his abysmal failure with covid. It's TRUMPS AMERICA that has increased violence. His supporters!  https://t.co/1ri2o1m6nZ

1315333235505799169 2020-10-12 00:47:35 +0800 <catsden234> They are liars. Do you want to lose ACA and social security? Because that is their goal. Millions with no insurance or pre existing conditions. Millions of seniors with NO INCOME.  https://t.co/pMeyx89adw
1315332048308113409 2020-10-12 00:42:52 +0800 <catsden234> Repub senators and repub congress are nothing but liars and HYPOCRITS They don't want to pass heros to help states and workers but want to shove in handmaiden judge to get rid of ACA! SENIORS will have no income as they plan to gut social security! Leaving us no way to live
1315331145798758401 2020-10-12 00:39:17 +0800 <catsden234> 75% of Americans feel judge should wait till new president in. But mitch wants court to be staked to get rid of ACA and defend trumps bullshit if he loses. All he wants is he and trump in power to get richer. No help for states, police and front line workers being laid off.
1315330274104836102 2020-10-12 00:35:49 +0800 <catsden234> Mitch has also said that if Biden is elected He'll keep blocking everything from dems. With trump wants to GUT SOCIAL SECURITY! No income for SENIORS. Ky flailing and mitch getting richer. Wants to take healthcare and protection from millions with his handmaiden judge. HYPOCRITE  https://t.co/5gdBFeEnNe

I'm sure a lot of it will depend on the rate of covid in each area. I guess fairly soon we'll see how it will play out. I do know from what I've read from 10yr up can spread.

Trump wants to tilt the judicial to his favor to get rid of it. Also if he loses will take to supreme court. So he wants it uneven in his favor.

1307343550846304258 2020-09-19 23:39:26 +0800 <catsden234> KENTUCKIANS Ruth Ginsberg wasn't dead but a few hours before mitch was shouting to replace her. He has NO respect for her or her family. He doesn't care about hee last wishes. This great lady dies and mitch is obviously thrilled at her death! Is that a person you want for senate?
1307342299920244736 2020-09-19 23:34:28 +0800 <catsden234> @cjscalia @PappyParki She was truly a great lady and one of a kind. Don Lemon said * not all heros wear capes, some wear robes*. So true. She was a hero, especially to women.
1307341121140465674 2020-09-19 23:29:47 +0800 <catsden234> KENTUCKIANS: Why would you vote for mitch? He's given trillions to the rich and ignored hero's act for 3 years. He's all for trump. They want to get rid of social security. Ppl in food lines in ky but got his millionare wife money from ppp meant for small buisness.
1307339495415713793 2020-09-19 23:23:19 +0800 <catsden234> Ive no doubt that as soon as trump got on the plane  he was smiling and clapping with glee over this great lady's death. Mitch McConnel didn't even have the integrity or respect to wait till she was in her grave to  be making plans for her re placement. What kind of person does

1306682389373091841 2020-09-18 03:52:13 +0800 <catsden234> Did you know repub bill wants to give public school money to private schools? Mitch looking out for the rich. His millionare wife got ppp meant for snall buisness. While small family buisnesses all over ky have to permenantly close. While you wait in food lines
1306681332110688256 2020-09-18 03:48:01 +0800 <catsden234> KENTUCKIANS!  Especially those on disability. Mitch is trumps minion. If they are boyh voted in, they will raid and destroy social security. Mitch has already saif if trump doesn't win he'll continue to hold up all bills. Like he is something to help americans now.

1306398081773170688 2020-09-17 09:02:29 +0800 <catsden234> As far as I am concerned assult weapons should be military only
1306397801497100288 2020-09-17 09:01:22 +0800 <catsden234> @karen_lebeter That was pretty much repeated speech from my dad
1306397584467079170 2020-09-17 09:00:30 +0800 <catsden234> Is it different then in different providences law wise?
1306397261748989957 2020-09-17 08:59:13 +0800 <catsden234> @Satin_Lavender @DParent49883464 @phinandme That sounds nice to me. Unfortunantly here we do have break ins etc. Not rampant, but does happen
1306396978306330627 2020-09-17 08:58:05 +0800 <catsden234> Here some things vary state to state. In ky if someone breaks in and you shoot them is legal. It is investigated to make sure you didn't lure them there for that purpose
1306396447085076486 2020-09-17 08:55:59 +0800 <catsden234> If someone broke in on me with no gun I'd be possibly dead. I live out in the country which means the town pplice dept  which is close to me, does not respond. I'm under sheriff and state which would be average 1/2 hour response time
1306395727707463682 2020-09-17 08:53:07 +0800 <catsden234> @Judith_FeyJude @cubanadeanna @Jenfeds73 @phinandme For ccw (carry conceled weapon) they do state and federal background checks. They re do those at renewals also I think
1306395382444888065 2020-09-17 08:51:45 +0800 <catsden234> I had to talke classes tauggt by law enforcement for carry conceled. Have to pass range test as well
1306395063635894274 2020-09-17 08:50:29 +0800 <catsden234> Interesting. I was under the impression you just couldn't have. Period. My gun is registered. I went through the classes to have carry concealed liscense. Renew every 5 years. AR s should be military only
1306394348758675457 2020-09-17 08:47:39 +0800 <catsden234> Agree with all of the above. My handgun is liscensed, i have a liscence to carry. I don't lock up bc I live allone. Do if someone comes over that has children
1306393864304037888 2020-09-17 08:45:43 +0800 <catsden234> Mintes to arrive. If someone breaks in I don't think throwing harsh words or coffee cups at intruder will be helpful
1306393567087202304 2020-09-17 08:44:32 +0800 <catsden234> I am not for assult weapons. Think thry should be banned, even from police. Assult weapons should be mitary only use. I do have a handgun for protection. It is liscensed and i have a carry conceled. Im am 64, difficulty walking, and live where it can take police up to thirty
1306392849404047360 2020-09-17 08:41:41 +0800 <catsden234> True. A lot is what we grew up with. I thubk all assult rifles should be banned.i have a handgun for personal protection, but I also have it liscened and have a carry liscence.
1306392244476407811 2020-09-17 08:39:17 +0800 <catsden234> @woff253 @phinandme One if my favorites in Canada was right over the river. Large boat turned into a resteraunt. Course did well for folks who got seasick
1306356299895013377 2020-09-17 06:16:27 +0800 <catsden234> KENTUCKIANS; You do realize that moscow mitch supports trump plan of getting rid of social security and medicaire. After 2002 NO DISABILITY.  After 2003 NO SOCIAL SECURITY!!! Even if your not retired everything you and employer have put in will be STOLEN! It's not gov money!!!
1306354203875516421 2020-09-17 06:08:07 +0800 <catsden234> @LeonaLioness6 Agree. But they would give them normal saline then lie and say was vaccine. Trump has subverted CDC, HHS &amp; FDA so I don't trust any of them anymore. Look at the guy *running* HHS.  When Dr. Fauci and Dr. Sangi tell me its safe, then I'll take it

Went with parents once to Toronto.  Awsome city. Everybody jokes about moving to Canada if trump wins. I've said for years would love to move there. My only one downside, like guns

When I was in high scool I was very political, was in group with SDS.  As I got older life kinda toned me down. Like most got side tracked with work, paying the bills , survival.

Atlas was the first to mention

Mostly I am angry that trump is using him knowing that he needs help, not to be used. But we aall know trump has no empathy and cares about no one but trump

We need to remeber who we are, what it means, and those who have fought to keep it!  This will remind you, our military are our HEROS. Those who have sacrificed everything for us! NOT losers and suckers!  HEROS!!!
1306293391672643588 2020-09-17 02:06:28 +0800 <catsden234> @Jacquel6176 So we have to FIGHT! It is why we must ALL stand together, at full strength, WE OUTNUMBER THEM!!!  https://t.co/xw9t0z8Hmo

1306247488081399813 2020-09-16 23:04:04 +0800 <catsden234> We have 196,742 Covid deaths. Probably much more since trump now controls  the numbers. Town hall last night trump talked about herd *mentality) Imminity. Something his xray dr. Atlas mentioned. Herd imminity will require 2 to 3 MILLION people to die of covid. Seems to b plan

1305728802941796352 2020-09-15 12:43:00 +0800 <catsden234> He and his repubs are holding up voting in courts, knowing he and DeJoy have crippled USPS and mail in will take longer. Suits will hold it up, maybe even till it's to late. Some more hearings?  If there is a revolution in this country bc of cheating bloods on your hands
1305727619124670465 2020-09-15 12:38:18 +0800 <catsden234> CONGRESS: If trump wins by cheating we officially be a facist country under a dictatorship. We will be Belarus. He's even having ballots put in trump ads. Really? There have been *investigations* and *hearings*, but here we are. Voting time has begun

Why doesn't trump go out amongst his people( without mask) and shake hands and hug supporters198,000 + dead. Thats why. Trump doesn't care who dies. But he's scared of getting covid. It's ok for supporters

1305557935628709889 2020-09-15 01:24:02 +0800 <catsden234> Translation: @xijinping.  Respectfully, what I've heard is, you prefer Joe. Biden won our election, and so did I. I think you'll find that he's a fair man to deal with. He will defend this country, but he will sit down and talk to the rest of the world. I don't want to interfere
1305556221395701768 2020-09-15 01:17:13 +0800 <catsden234> @xijinping  恭敬地， 我听到的是， 你更喜欢乔 · 拜登赢得我们的选举， 我也是。我想你会发现他是一个公平的人来处理。他将保卫这个国家，但会坐下来和世界上的其他人交谈。我不想干涉我的国家选举。我不是政治家，而只是一个单纯的公民。如果你能帮助俄罗斯退出我们的选举， 将不胜感激。

1305417257296842752 2020-09-14 16:05:02 +0800 <catsden234> I think ALL of these towns he goes to should do a 48 hour shutdown and put closed on all their buisnesses. Especially hotels.  The cult would have no where to settle in, spend the night etc.  Cult would have to leave town riggt after rally. Only way I can think of to protect town

All that matters to him is campaign. Almost 200,000 ppl dead is shining example he doesn't care what happens to us. Don't know if that helps you, hope so.
1304933679144341507 2020-09-13 08:03:28 +0800 <catsden234> Why? Simple, trump. With his taking # from CDC where he can control them. To FDA apparently folding under his pressure with these emergency passes for drugs. To CDC walking back when covid tests are needed.  The feeling is that these agencies who were always watchdogs

Can illegally funnel money into his accounts. He couldn't making in buisness legally. So does illegally. Thats why cronies in jail.

1304558546550480897 2020-09-12 07:12:49 +0800 <catsden234> So to everyone on both sides. On this anniversary of a day that America stood proud and showed the world what we we're made of, I only ask. Take a breath and THINK!
1304557589833842690 2020-09-12 07:09:01 +0800 <catsden234> I know what it's like to eat bologna sandwiches for 2 weeks till payday.Soon covid will have taken 200,000 American lives. Proof he cares about no one but trump. This is not a success, most other countries have proven that. They are back to being open up without fear.
1304556531833241600 2020-09-12 07:04:49 +0800 <catsden234> Wolf, no background or experience for his job. And on and on.  So MEGAs, your being used. We all are. To divide and tear down this great nation!  By the RICH guy who's never worked a day in his life. No concept of 2 jobs just to pay bills. I worked 42 years, and many times 2 jobs
1304555075336105984 2020-09-12 06:59:02 +0800 <catsden234> Why has he replased everyone in WH and still is? You and I all know that putting someone like DeJoy over USPS wasn't DeJoys vast knowledge or backgound in USPS. He couldn't answer basic questions about it to congress. I watched live on CSPAN so im not repeating any news sources.
1304554286152658944 2020-09-12 06:55:53 +0800 <catsden234> about covid. You don't have to read the book, it's on tape! To keep calm? Do you really believe this man who rants at rallies to divide us wanted calm? Trump has been caught in so many lies, it's not even funny anymore. THINK  Why are his closest associates in jail?

Why are we who have so much in common screaming hate at each other??? Because day after endless day trump has preached it.  The rich guy. The one who lied from the begining
1304552343762071553 2020-09-12 06:48:10 +0800 <catsden234> least 800 billion dollars profit since covid began. The cop in Calif who got caught on tape stealing and got put on leave.

1304548830453653507 2020-09-12 06:34:13 +0800 <catsden234> MEGAs. I'm going to admit something neither side wants to. We all have a lot in common! Mostly we are the working class that America was built on.Probably, at least most, have a deep respect for our military. They are our backbone and our heros. No doubt many on both sides

No right to vote and choose your leader? Esentially the philosophy of HITLER!  This is where we are. This is our choice!
1304493469113745408 2020-09-12 02:54:14 +0800 <catsden234> For 4 years what we have careened towards is facism. And we have arrived! Trump has been laying the ground work by destroying rule of law, firing anyone in oversight, appointing people to positions they have no experience in, excep being trumps cronies. Ex: DeJoy!
1304492471938887680 2020-09-12 02:50:16 +0800 <catsden234> Biden/Harris are right, healthcare in a rich country is a right, not a privledge. That's nott socialism, That's respect for everyone in this great nation. Why should only the rich be able to afford a doctor and medicine, when this country was built on the backs of the working?
1304490886903074817 2020-09-12 02:43:58 +0800 <catsden234> Every other industrialized nation on the planet has some form of healthcare for all. The rich fight this. They are profiteers who want to be unfettered in what they charge for healthcare, leaving millions who can't afford it behind with no no healthcare. And the rich get richer!
1304490148990783489 2020-09-12 02:41:02 +0800 <catsden234> to make a more perfect union. I'll admit, I'm sick of the rich getting richer off the backs of the working and poor. But I also applaud that our countries attitude is that given a chance, and a lot of hard work anyone can succeed. That's called DEMORCACY
1304488783044390912 2020-09-12 02:35:36 +0800 <catsden234> Me too! I'm just a plain old white woman lol No, we don't want communism or socialism, *We The People* simply want our democracy and constution back! I'm no expert on politics, but seems to me, part of our strength is trying to take the best of various philosophies  https://t.co/NWjHgEOP5p
1304483928884088832 2020-09-12 02:16:19 +0800 <catsden234> @DavidOcasio3 I find it interesting to find x police on here. So can I pick your brain a little? I realize that being in medical field all my life affects my perspective.  Why does it seem the police are making a point of proving racial injustice when they know the world (literally) is watchin

1304205321506881536 2020-09-11 07:49:14 +0800 <catsden234> I just don't  understand what's going on with police. Has trump told them to make it worse? THIS is why there is marching in the streets. Do the police not undertand that respect goes 2 ways?
1304203240872050690 2020-09-11 07:40:58 +0800 <catsden234> Their ignorace is overwhelming. As is their rudness. If a bunch of BLM met trump at landing we woild never hear the end of it!!

1304190230749163521 2020-09-11 06:49:16 +0800 <catsden234> States have already had to lay off front line heros. But trump wants to screw them over so more millions will be laid off!

1303955431417671683 2020-09-10 15:16:15 +0800 <catsden234> They already know your not going to do anything that truly helps. Your just putting out bullshit bc trump told you to for his CAMPAIGN like everything else. But he won't let you pass heros bc he doesn't really want anything worthwhile to be done. Just so you can spout this crap

Otherwise done with news and CSPAN. No matter what trump and his cronies do, no one tries to stop them. So gonna watch a lot more movies.

1303943141289070592 2020-09-10 14:27:25 +0800 <catsden234> I watch a lot of CSPAN. Hearing after hearing. Why? Nobody does anything. So why sit around and talk about it????
1303942794113880066 2020-09-10 14:26:02 +0800 <catsden234> GOVERNORS: please have all national guard in all states out guarding citizens every voting day. Let it be known ahead or many will be to afraid of trumps white anarchists to vote!!!
1303942212447866881 2020-09-10 14:23:44 +0800 <catsden234> I pray that Biden and Harris win the election. If they don't trump will destroy what's left of our country. And ya know what? Will be to damn late to do anything, even if he and russia won it illegally by cheating!
1303941569523986433 2020-09-10 14:21:10 +0800 <catsden234> Not only is senate and rep complicant in their silence but I'm begining to feel the rest are complicate in their INACTION!!!!
1303941140480233472 2020-09-10 14:19:28 +0800 <catsden234> I have always loved my country. Was always proud to same *I'm an American*. I'm not anymore. And not only because of trump.  I've sat here and watch trump and his cronies do things that are illegal and unconstitutional. Over, and , and over. BUT NO ONE TRIES TO STOP THEM.
1303940217737543681 2020-09-10 14:15:48 +0800 <catsden234> I've said that for months!
1303939630174220294 2020-09-10 14:13:28 +0800 <catsden234> Cheating and NO ONE DOES ANYTHING! F**k a lawsuit a year or two from now. Russia is helping rig the vote. Trump is a criminal. FOR GODS SAKE SOMEONE IN POWER DO SOMETHING!!!!!
1303939142854770699 2020-09-10 14:11:32 +0800 <catsden234> All of the things that trump, barr, DeJoy are illegal. I'm sick of hearing *a lawsuit may be filed*. Someone needs to just arrest their asses. If it were you or me we would be stored under the jail by now. But apparently ok for them to keep subverting our vote. And lying and

1303930720210030592 2020-09-10 13:38:04 +0800 <catsden234> Why is he able to continue to have DeJoy destroy USPS? Chad Wolf is way over his *temporary * position, why is he allowed to continue? It is ludicrous that trump just carries on and does what he wants!!!
1303929047253221376 2020-09-10 13:31:25 +0800 <catsden234> @KamalaHarris  I have already sent for absentee ballot( I'm in ky). Many of us are very fearful that our votes in any manner will be subverted. DeJoy will continue destroying USPS.Trumps minions will do things we can only guess. Why can nothing be done to stop any of this ??

1303911372359643138 2020-09-10 12:21:11 +0800 <catsden234> Look at proposal? Where? Let me guess, no money for states that trump caused to go broke bc he dumped covid on them. How much unemployment? &amp;200.00 , &amp; 300.00, any? Any stimulus? Any for food relief? YOU were the one who put off and went on vacation! My bet, very little help!
1303909818646835200 2020-09-10 12:15:00 +0800 <catsden234> This is pretty much the attitudes of repubs in congress and senate. Never does address the tapes. But damn sure told their rich cronies back in feb so they could protect themselves. As elections come up, every single one of them should be voted OUT! They helped trump betray us!!!

1303348705735696385 2020-09-08 23:05:21 +0800 <catsden234> China at least cared enough about it's citizens and have a national plan to get covid down.  Pass the word up over there that some think trump will start a war just to stay in office. Chinese govt. needs to just tell trump to f*** off! Sorry for the rant but im sick of trumps bs
1303347865952149505 2020-09-08 23:02:00 +0800 <catsden234> I am sick of trump picking at China to get the focus off of Russia helping cheat in election. And I'm even more sick of the racist orange blob calling it *China virus*. Did China make mistakes. I think so. But trump is the one who called it a hoax! And has cont. to do nothing!

If you don't have friends or family you can talk to please, please call a mental health hotline. Right now our world is an overwhelming and sometimes even scary place. And it's easy to slip into depression. I have battled depression for years.

1302447841936322561 2020-09-06 11:25:38 +0800 <catsden234> The repubs won't answer any questions about trump. They keep deflecting to the violence &amp; law and order crap. Or start bashing Biden. They can't defend trump cause he's a failure. So they have to lie and/or deflect. Rev Al kept calling denning out on it and it was funny as hell
1302447072201920514 2020-09-06 11:22:34 +0800 <catsden234> Rev Al holding this guys feet to the fire . He finally just told him enough and cut him off.

1302330021969883138 2020-09-06 03:37:28 +0800 <catsden234> I so admire Khizr Kahn when he comes to speak of his son. I can't even imagine how difficult it must be for him. His son was not a *loser* ot a *sucker* He not only served, but stepped in to save the men he was responsible for. There is no greater hero than this! ❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏

1301798587651837954 2020-09-04 16:25:44 +0800 <catsden234> Trump is hoping they will vote twice to make counting more difficult. He doesn't care if ppl in base go to jail bc it's a felony. And still they follow, i don't get it

1301785660437790722 2020-09-04 15:34:22 +0800 <catsden234> He wants to make counting votes harder and try and scream fraud. Doesn't care if his base goes to jail when caught. Just like dismanteling USPS trying to rig election!

1301330850190184448 2020-09-03 09:27:06 +0800 <catsden234> I will agree with trump. We need to get rid of anarchists rioters , burners and looters. @realDonaldTrump So tell your right winger trump supporters to stand down . That would eliminate 100% of anarchists and 99 % of looters, rioters and burners.

1301274699486367744 2020-09-03 05:43:59 +0800 <catsden234> No trump has taken over CDC, FDA and HHS.  NIH is the only one standing to protect us. When Dr. Fauci says it's safe, I'll think about it. Till then I know that everything coming from CDC, FDA and HHS is coming straight from trump!
1301273902891630594 2020-09-03 05:40:49 +0800 <catsden234> Bullshit!
1301273669210169344 2020-09-03 05:39:53 +0800 <catsden234> As usual CAMPAIGNING! Nothing can stay safely open till covid under control. Instead he's letting it grow exponentially! Almost 186,000 deaths! Now he's just sacrificing your kids for campaign!!!

1301272096480337921 2020-09-03 05:33:38 +0800 <catsden234> That's exactly what trump wants. If he hasn't gov of oregon needs to call in natl guard. They are under state not federal. Before orange asshole sends goons in
