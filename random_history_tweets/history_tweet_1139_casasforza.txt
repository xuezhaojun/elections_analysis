If a COVID patient with COPD, emphysema, or diabetes dies, it‚Äôs impossible to rule out COVID-19 as a cause of death. They died of complications from COVID-19.

1326961097585258496 2020-11-13 02:52:34 +0800 <casasforza> @ann64269 @BlazeNYC2 @HillaryClinton I studied microbiology long enough to know how viruses work, but I also know that people still aren't wearing masks because they think masks provide them *no* protection at all. People aren't staying home, so if they're determined to go out, they need to wear masks.
1326960697985564672 2020-11-13 02:50:58 +0800 <casasforza> @ann64269 @BlazeNYC2 @HillaryClinton Which is why masks are best used only when social distancing isn't possible. But also...  https://t.co/IwIsbD1gae

1326958674510704640 2020-11-13 02:42:56 +0800 <casasforza> @immdaly @HillaryClinton It's true that mass gatherings are still bad. However, outdoors and masked will deeply reduce the risk of infection. The real problem is still people gathering indoors without masks.
1326958434017685504 2020-11-13 02:41:59 +0800 <casasforza> @ann64269 @BlazeNYC2 @HillaryClinton On the contrary, the current consensus is that wearing a mask is effective for particle filtration, reducing the risk of infection by up to 70%. But you're absolutely right that the point of a mask is to protect other people from one's own potential infection.

Instead they‚Äôre all being dismissed as frivolous. The problem with only getting news from Fox and Breitbart is that people missed seeing that the vast majority of the U.S. has never approved of Trump.

Some of these paper records were old af and pretty illegible. They put in what they could, but that‚Äôs why so many voters have a DOB in 1900 or 1/1/1900.

1324576057479979008 2020-11-06 12:55:16 +0800 <casasforza> @DaveOakley89 @goof @PhocaeanD This usually happens when a) a permanent absentee voter died after the last election or b) a voter died after mailing their ballot.

1323042555609583616 2020-11-02 07:21:40 +0800 <casasforza> The choice of costume is not accidental nor is the violence. They are built into our (mis)understanding of medieval history and it‚Äôs depiction in popular culture.
1323041898869657600 2020-11-02 07:19:04 +0800 <casasforza> And this is why we have to continue the critique of distorted white supremacist historical narratives. They‚Äôre not just wrong, they‚Äôre dangerous. #medievaltwitter

So faculty everywhere are working longer hours through cuts to their pay and benefits in order to educate students. Not asking them to put their families at risk as well would be nice.

1305218360494317568 2020-09-14 02:54:41 +0800 <casasforza> @ADmomof3 @MatthewBarba4 @KTLA I‚Äôm a professor teaching online for the rest of the year because it‚Äôs hard to put an entire community‚Äôs health in the hands of 18-year-olds. If people would stop chanting that face-to-face is far superior to online learning (it‚Äôs not), colleges could exercise more common sense.
1305208123662065664 2020-09-14 02:14:00 +0800 <casasforza> @ADmomof3 @KTLA It does, however, mean infectious.
1305194068889104385 2020-09-14 01:18:10 +0800 <casasforza> Every single number in this clip is wrong. Remarkable. (Also 538 is the total number of votes in the electoral college. Seems like something a U.S. presidential candidate might be expected to know.)

1304132449962569729 2020-09-11 02:59:40 +0800 <casasforza> A modest proposal: we stop saying ‚Äúindependent scholar‚Äù and instead say ‚Äúr≈çnin.‚Äù The former is a little boring and conceals the terrible state of the academic job market while the second carries a soup√ßon of danger and implies mastery of kenjutsu.
