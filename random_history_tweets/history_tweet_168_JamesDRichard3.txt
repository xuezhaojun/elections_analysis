1343675738134863879 2020-12-29 05:50:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @SaintRPh So sorry. Truly hurts my heart to hear. I'm looking at my 10 year old dog in tears because I know I have to deal with that in a few years.

I'm pretty sure scientist created Thalydimide and that stuff created horrifying birth defects. I still remember seeing people in the 70s with no arms and mom telling me Thalydimide.

On top of that you voted for a man pushing 80 that has had several strokes and a brain bleed like that was a good idea.
1343520999942344706 2020-12-28 19:35:42 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Meidas_RedPanda @upside @JoeBiden I learned Joe has had several strokes and a brain bleed that would definately affect the cognitive functions of someone pushing 80. He wasn't even the best Democratic nominee. He's a straw man.

1343516077809139712 2020-12-28 19:16:08 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Let's not forget about you and Hunter selling us out. That's a crisis.

1343335984814055424 2020-12-28 07:20:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @RussOnPolitics @JoeBiden Why you think this scumb bag is so chock full of integrity is beyond me. I'm suprised he can walk with the 2 strokes and the brain bleed. He's old and his brain is toast but you think he's some political saint. To much kool aid.

Important information about you was suppressed before the election. Not even gonna ask you about the fraud because I'm sure you have plausible deniability on that one.

1340089369043066884 2020-12-19 08:19:37 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @rtpreece @MattWalshBlog Maybe before the acid albums. Even Billy Thorp started out with that song Poison Ivy which was a total pop song to writing Children of The Sun a small rock opera about aliens coming to rescue us and leave the earth to heal. Even The Beach Boys have 2 different styles.

It's like saying Lysol doesn't work because it only kills 99.9 percent of germs on contact. There is more going on here than your government trying to save you.

1340063844262154243 2020-12-19 06:38:12 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @AndrewYang How about a mark in the right hand or forehead that you can't buy or sell or even go in public buildings without just like the mark of The Beast in revelations you Satanic freak?

That's where the damn thing came from and man made no less. Joe does not have any plan for the virus that Trump hasn't already put in motion. If masks work why was Biden coughing so much on TV? Does he not wear his mask

1338540988407701506 2020-12-15 01:46:55 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jaxinn @BethMooreLPM How to be a Biden Christian 1 Be all in when it comes to killing unborn infants. 2 lie all the time. 3 Get your crack smoking son an overpaying job you can get kick backs from. 4 Kiss China's ass. 5 pretend to have a great covid plan that is really Trump's

Stop bringing your racism into Christianity. Nobody is better than anybody else and it dosnt matter what color Jesus is. Biggest problem in the Church is all black and all white congregations.

The animals chased out the farmer"The dictator that mistreated his people" and developed a system solar to Marxism but the pigs didn't follow the rules and put themselves above the other animals just making themselves the new evil dictator.

1337460229236256771 2020-12-12 02:12:22 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @MollyJongFast @AOC So you are more against justice for violent murderers than you are the completely innocent?

It depends how God feels about America as a whole. Cali makes 90 percent of the world's porn so I can see him beeping angered and dropping Biden on us as punishment.
1337455474439036928 2020-12-12 01:53:28 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Qanon76 Is Barr still on our side?

1337452154488049665 2020-12-12 01:40:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jwpsr @realDonaldTrump Trump won on his first try. Biden has been in politics 47 years and lost two presidential elections before this one, is almost 80 and you think that's what's gonna save America? He's a lifetime loser.

You don't necessarily contract aids the first time you come into contact with it. Much harder for men to get aids through hetero sex because of our much smaller opening to a mucous membrane and the urethra gets flushed during ejaculation.
1334904615071084549 2020-12-05 00:57:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @panchos_produce @deveshhh Because hep C always takes people out in their late 30s😒

Imagine if that was Joe who just started laughing when people asked him questions. Joe wouldnt laugh. He would just tell you that your stupid and not answer you question.

I work in healthcare yet I know nobody personally who has been hospitalized with covid. Even if the 200,000 number is correct that out of 200,000,000 people. It's way less than 1 percent
1329932707053375490 2020-11-21 07:40:40 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @IngrahamAngle He is off his rocker. Never saw anybody put up Office of President select banners. Trump didn't do that when he beat Hillary. That on top of nobody but commercial media ever saying he is PE which they don't get to do.

1328701522214084610 2020-11-17 22:08:23 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @ozscribe @jimmykimmel There are close to 200,000,000 people hear but keep pushing those numbers like they are huge.
1328701001168277504 2020-11-17 22:06:19 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jimmykimmel I bet Kimmel could fit 2 packs of hot dogs in his mouth at the same time.

Seriously there are 100,000,000 or more of us. You are making this out to be bigger than it is and blaming it all on someone who had nothing to do in creating. Trump already did what Joe said he'll do.

1327620184811696141 2020-11-14 22:31:32 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @MAGAstrosFan @LATiffani1 So many people ,even family members voted for Joe solely on the basis that they don't like Trump. No real informed decision, just I don't like Trump. It makes me sick to think of how brainwashed they are.

He's sundowning and slipping further into dementia. Any timed he campaigned he just yelled without really saying anything. Funny nobody has said covid in days.

1324344961060478976 2020-11-05 21:36:58 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @OneLilDoe Desperation is states having more votes than voters.

1324342632055775232 2020-11-05 21:27:43 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @LionelMedia I get you. We need to intervene for ourselves on this physical plane. We cannot trust in God to come down and count the votes but we can pray for justice.
1324342264211087361 2020-11-05 21:26:15 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden The validity of every vote must be confirmed. When more people vote than there are registered voters it called Malarkey!

1324309024079286272 2020-11-05 19:14:10 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> How does this election even count if states have more votes than registered voters?

1323579087470944258 2020-11-03 18:53:40 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Is that science? Has science told you Trump will destroy the world?🤣

That's not cute at all what they are doing. It's hostile and terrorising random people. This is not peaceful protest.

If I had to pick one place not to try and sneak a razor sharp blade on my face it would be between my nose and upper lip. Unlike women men are not ashamed of having hair on their upper lip.

1322574934065909760 2020-11-01 00:23:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @tweettruth2me Get beat by your parents as kids or get beat by the police as adults. Chose wisely. Your parents love you, the police don't.
1322574368954753024 2020-11-01 00:21:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 My brother has extreme anxiety but refuses to take medication for it. He considers that the thorn in his side.
1322574036954591232 2020-11-01 00:19:57 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Paul had the thorn in his side but Jacob physically had something injured on him in a physical altercation with an Angel of The Lord. That's heavy to think about what that altercation would have looked like from a spectators point of view.
1322570566574862339 2020-11-01 00:06:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Exactly
1322570515408588800 2020-11-01 00:05:57 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Do you know how hard that was for Obi Wan? He never wanted to no Aniken. He even told him when he had the high ground not to attack him because it would leave him at a disadvantage. He told him he loved him afterwords. All Aniken could say is "I hate you!" Give old Ben a break.
1322569625117208576 2020-11-01 00:02:25 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 So they had their names modified. Jacob earned a completely different title. I often wonder about his physical altercation.
1322569306207526913 2020-11-01 00:01:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 All of that horrid brutality was supposed to be upon us. For the Son of God to come into flesh and allow himself to be treated like that all for us is the greatest love I can think of and I almost can't take thinking about it.
1322568552184905728 2020-10-31 23:58:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Confused, I thought you said they had other names?
1322568392658677760 2020-10-31 23:57:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 You can find entire audio of Enoch on you tube. It is all in first person as if com the Prophet directly. It describes the heavens he was taken up into and the last days and coming of the Son of Man. The Gospel of Thomas is not part of The Book of Enoch so I don't know how Thomas
1322567635415015425 2020-10-31 23:54:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I think that was in the movie to show you how drastic his change was. All he car about was saving Padme. It didn't matter who else died.
1322567022706860032 2020-10-31 23:52:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Says what?
1322566827785048064 2020-10-31 23:51:18 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 You definately know a lot. I don't even know Abraham and Sarah's other names are. I know Peter is the only one that got a nickname besides The Brothers of Thunder.
1322566168188694530 2020-10-31 23:48:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Well it's completely backward in Star Wars. Aniken starts out as the prophesied chosen one who would bring balance to the force. Because of his impatience and lust for power and control he turns into a sociopath and loses his humanity. Thus Vader killing kids to save his wife.
1322564686416662529 2020-10-31 23:42:47 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Out of curiosity can you tell me what Paul says that you disagree with?
1322564188032610309 2020-10-31 23:40:49 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I grew up watching Passion Plays and weeping. I fear the realism of Gibson's Passion of The Christ will destroy me. Tears run from my eyes thinking about it. No joke.
1322563719851921408 2020-10-31 23:38:57 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 The man you read about that killed those Christians was Saul. He died when Paul gave his life to the Lord. It's like Aniken Skywalker in reverse. Instead of Light to Dark, Paul went from Dark to Light. He is as chosen as any apostle in my eyes and suffered as much as any of them.
1322562941082832897 2020-10-31 23:35:51 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 That's why I find his conversion so amazing. God took someone who hated him and made him a champion for him. Paul had more than just a vision. He was blinded tempirariley. He hears The Lord's voice ask him why he was persecuting him and was blinded by his glory.
1322561979534528513 2020-10-31 23:32:02 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 So you do you think the crucifixtion was necessary? I think from the narrative that Jesus new he had to let it be done. He told Judas to go do what he must do. He could have hidden but didn't.
1322561442999054338 2020-10-31 23:29:54 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I am not trying to change you or chastise you or tell you you are wrong. I'm just loving this conversation and learning how other believers think and why. I hope I'm am not bothering you. I enjoy talking to you.
1322560900142948353 2020-10-31 23:27:45 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Lots of people saw the resurrected Jesus. He hung out for over a month before ascending. Peter thought he was actually dead for 2 weeks after the crucifixtion and Jesus had to come find him. He went back to fishing like it was all just a dream.
1322560262692610048 2020-10-31 23:25:13 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Yes! I totally get you because I was you. I used to think about how mad Peter must have been when Paul came onto the scene thinking things like " Who does this guy think he is#? I used to walk with The Lord and this guy thinks he can be my equal?, screw him!"😄
1322559500990226432 2020-10-31 23:22:11 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I definately understand you. These are hard concepts that even I wrestle with. I think Jesus is as close to God that you could look upon without your eyes melting out of your head in this human form. I would agree that he sits at the right hand of God while also being His right H
1322558431807635457 2020-10-31 23:17:56 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Do you read The Book of Enoch?
1322558174277361665 2020-10-31 23:16:55 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 The movie Paul:Apostle of Christ, is compelling. I tend to feel the Holy Spirit coming off people that were turned from great sin like him. Some of the most powerful Christians are X junkies and thieves. The Lord can use anybody. He used Moses even though he was slow of tongue.
1322557425858301956 2020-10-31 23:13:56 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 You did use a lot of exclamation point,lol. Hmmmm, Now I understand. I have really come to appreciate Paul more in more mature years. His writings are beautifully powerful and he suffered for writing them and being a follower of Christ. He made Luke drop his life for Christ.
1322556374346354689 2020-10-31 23:09:46 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 But does it Anger Yaweh or The Holy Spirt if I pray to Jesus/Yeshua?

1322554298476101632 2020-10-31 23:01:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Would it not be blasphemy for the apostles to call him Lord if he wasn't? Would that not be blasphemy? God is a jealous God.
1322553586245541888 2020-10-31 22:58:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I think I've repented for them. I havnt gotten one in 26 years and have no desire to do so.

1322552567356747776 2020-10-31 22:54:38 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I understand that view point. Jehovah's witnesses believe he is Michael the Angel in the flesh. But Jesus says to his disciple "If you have seen the Me you have seen The Father" and In The begining was The Word and The Word was with God and The Word was God. God spoke reality
1322551719738310656 2020-10-31 22:51:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I have some tattoos that I regret. But I repent of them and I'm sure God forgives me. I'll never let a tattoo needle touch me again.
1322550955376701440 2020-10-31 22:48:14 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I wanted to be a dinosaur when I was 5. Glad I didn't go through with the surgery.🤣
1322549587643568129 2020-10-31 22:42:48 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 I think its because Jesus obviously waited extra time so Lazarus would not be just sick but dead and explained he went not to wake a sleeping man. All these people believed he was Lord but doubted his power. I believe that's why he wept. You?
1322549027364200449 2020-10-31 22:40:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 My Brother is a far bigger Bibal Scholar than I but with the help of an E bible and a search engine I'm pretty good. I tend to look at things from different angles than him. He believes Jesus wept out of sadness for Lazarus death and the grief of his family. To be continued..
1322547962258444288 2020-10-31 22:36:20 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> A true legend. From Bond to Remerez in Highlander to his inspired Character on SNL Jeopardy. He will be missed.
1322547266469548032 2020-10-31 22:33:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 They are so hard to relate to because it's an illness. It's not normal to think you are something other than what you are to the point of surgical mutilation of perfectly working parts. And what's real disturbing is when they try to normalize it in young children.

1322325985086345217 2020-10-31 07:54:17 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @jessica61814936 Yeah that is very bizarre in my opinion.

Even if you took that number from the amount of people who have pre voted you would still have 84,800,000 voters. Not a huge number of people compared to the total population. Sad but could be worse.

1322296443768483842 2020-10-31 05:56:53 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Biden's speech is more him telling us the truth he would like us to believe other than the actual truth. Also sounds like he is being fed through an ear piece. His cadence and the way he yells like he has ear plugs in says it all.

1321209433184231425 2020-10-28 05:57:30 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> No, you shouldn't work to high school kid jobs to stay above the poverty level. You need to get out there and work for the American dream! The dream is worked for Biden, not given to you.
1321208995181400064 2020-10-28 05:55:45 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Ok Joe, I got more black Trump supporting friends on Twitter than you can shake a stick at but Trump is racist😅
1321207998690304010 2020-10-28 05:51:48 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Then he said "Giggity giggity" one of Joe's weirder sounds.
1321207837410922501 2020-10-28 05:51:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Joe Biden just said "I've been around a while but I've never been more optimistic than today" Why? What too 47 years to get optimistic? And if he says "There not learning to live with! They are learning to die with it!" I'm gonna puke. Trump has done more to stop it than Joe.
1321206323615354881 2020-10-28 05:45:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Joe Biden just said he was Joe Biden's husband. I backed it up 4 times to make sure I wasn't hearing things.

1320786860151627782 2020-10-27 01:58:21 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden How are you going to do that Joe. You know you have to wait several more days for all the votes from Pennsylvania to come in. Thats what you supported. You didn't support in person voting and election results on election day.

1320090636297568258 2020-10-25 03:51:48 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> Joe is just Obama 2.0. Hrs ranting in Florida like knows what Joe is gonna do more than Joe does. He's even repeating the same debunked lies like injecting bleach and he only payed 750 in taxes. He just for real told these people Trump calls the military suckers. Same old lies.

If there is nothing to see why does the FBI have it and not you or your son since it belongs to you guys? What's with all these jobs you got your unqualified crack addicted.

Why do a job that gives you ulcers for 25 dollars an hour when you could lean on a broom for 22.50? This is socialist crap economics.

We have Republicans on the hill stabing us in the back along with Dems. May God give the grace to Trump to turn the swamp to a crystal spring.

You where only to keep them seven years then they chose whether to stay or leave. If they decided to stay. You knocked a hole through their ear lobe and put a ring in it and then that slave is now yours for life.

I'm aware the Israelites screwed up all the time and constantly drank from the cup of God's wrath but some of the stuff God told them specifically to do. Like the Amalakites.

I wish we never had slavery because the echoing reprocutions and inhumanity just were not worth the money. I'll end up getting beat down for what some dead cotton barren started.

I don't think you can really fear God and be gay. "If your eye offend thee pluck it out" If your sexuality is an abomination then maybe you are better off having none at all.

1315693435685408768 2020-10-13 00:38:54 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @RepAdamSchiff That's not how it works Schifty. The president gets to be president for 4 years. He does not stop being president in an election cycle. Even if, even if Joe wins he is still president for several more months. How did someone as ignorant as you go so far in Congress?

My father was a Sgt and flight engineer in Nam and was only 5ft 5in tall. That's bravery. That's a man. Go ahead and call me boomer I guess. It helps me weed out idiots.

1315630185681649666 2020-10-12 20:27:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden That's why I grew up in the 70s telling Pollock jokes everyday? I never realized why but I think it is due to their pitiful response to Hitler.
1315629714351034368 2020-10-12 20:25:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Joe, Trump can't run around and cure every case of covid or prevent it from spreading. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died every year under your watch but that was just normal. You are trying to politicize a virus.

He spent his entire life in the swamp and is as corrupt as the rest of them. This is all smoke and mirrors. He won't even answer a question about packing the court.

1311695311593709568 2020-10-01 23:51:47 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @crensen56 @JoeBiden Trump doesn't even drink. Biden was the one all amped up like he was on drugs that refused to take a drug test.
1311695021444341760 2020-10-01 23:50:37 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @WendyEGibson @JoeBiden He also called the president Dude. How old is Joe? 17

1311452782759735297 2020-10-01 07:48:03 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @gnelson19561 I feel for you
1311451322017816576 2020-10-01 07:42:15 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Ignore your obnoxious debate performance and Chris Wallis shamefully pandering to you and attacking Trump. We can't wait until you arnt on your home court. All that disrespectful shouting and crazy eyes made you look drugged.

1311448054088847361 2020-10-01 07:29:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @catturd2 Not supposed to suck on those?🤔
1311447468907921409 2020-10-01 07:26:56 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Well I'm sorry. You are probably right. I did come off like that.
1311447152640614401 2020-10-01 07:25:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Luke was a Greek.
1311388766758678533 2020-10-01 03:33:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Do you know how condescending you are? Anybody who's heard of Mel Gibson's Passion of The Christ knows that. The scriptures wernt written by Christ though. Not a single Book of Jesus in the bible. He wasn't the scribe.
1311388268496384006 2020-10-01 03:31:42 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec And those text written in Greek had different words for rock and pebble and were divinely inspired.
1311387723622686725 2020-10-01 03:29:32 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Given that the original text was inspired by the Holy Spirit, the phrasing used is what He intended for us to see and understand.
1311387190778310658 2020-10-01 03:27:25 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec The NT autographs were written almost entirely in Koine Greek. There are no words in Matt 16:18 that were written in Aramaic.
1311387030698561538 2020-10-01 03:26:47 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Same thing. What good is a bible written in a language you can't read. Why were they saying mass in Latin when my parents grew up. They didn't speak Latin. Jesus didn't even speak Latin so why?
1311386330887262219 2020-10-01 03:24:00 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HillaryClinton You are both lying! We watched too!
1311384769423384576 2020-10-01 03:17:48 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Oh, and every Christian did NOT know of the same Bible since the magisterium refused to allow laymen access to Scripture.
1311384533741309957 2020-10-01 03:16:51 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec You need to prove what you say but you can't.
1311384360784932866 2020-10-01 03:16:10 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec No Jesus is The Rock. Peter literally means little rock.
1311383984589463558 2020-10-01 03:14:40 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec No, you tell me the 7 books smart guy. Don't send me an article.
1311383821917589504 2020-10-01 03:14:02 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec My brothers response: No, Luther didn't take a single book out of the Bible. The deuterocanon was added by the council of Trent and even then, was not considered to be inspired.  Show me the7
1311383441624240128 2020-10-01 03:12:31 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec The same Peter you are claiming to be The Rock is the Peter Jesus spoke the words "Get behind me Satan"
1311383078879850499 2020-10-01 03:11:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Papal authority all hinges on Matt 16:18. The "rock" upon which He will build His church is "petra" in Greek. It's used several times in the New Testament. Every allegorical usage refers to Christ (explicitly stated in 1 Cor 10:4), never to Peter. Why would Matt 16:18 be differen

1311380286224109569 2020-10-01 02:59:59 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec I've seen Catholic bibles and didn't notice extra books.
1311380136760094723 2020-10-01 02:59:23 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Instead of getting on your high horse tell me the 7 books.
1311378645760573446 2020-10-01 02:53:28 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Judas was an apostle. Does he have authority?
1311378475568295937 2020-10-01 02:52:47 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec What books did Luther remove from the canon?
1311378224660840449 2020-10-01 02:51:47 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec 2 Tim 3:16-17, Mark 7:1-13 Nothing outside scripture is needed to know His will. Council of Nicaea affirmed by acclimation that the Canon was complete.

1311376790397616128 2020-10-01 02:46:05 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life.
1311375648997466113 2020-10-01 02:41:33 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec It's The Word of God which is divinely inspired! What other authority could there possibly be other than that? The word of man?
1311374263719469058 2020-10-01 02:36:03 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @DeAnna4Congress Chris Wallace is a pussy and a dick at the same time.

1311372504200622085 2020-10-01 02:29:03 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec That's my brothers response.
1311372377813585924 2020-10-01 02:28:33 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec 1) none of which is Scripture inspired by the Holy Spirit, and 2) none of which affirms the authority of the papacy. Ignatius makes mention of Roman "presidency", but gives no scriptural backing.
1311371994999422979 2020-10-01 02:27:02 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @HeadRusch @JackPosobiec Wasn't familiar with the term, but it refers to the time of Passover and Resurrection Sunday

1311336660857053184 2020-10-01 00:06:38 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @charliekirk11 Or a drug test! He was high as a kite on steroids or meth.

1311002277990338561 2020-09-30 01:57:54 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JackPosobiec And then there are those who believe all Catholics are in error with their Queen of Heaven and prayers to Saints. It is nothing but a solar deity cult wrapped in idol worship.

1310913636995608576 2020-09-29 20:05:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps So all I have to do if I don't like you is call the cops and say you are ranting about guns and killing people and they will come knock you down , maybe tazer you? Is that how it works? I wouldn't have opened my front door if I was this guy.
1310912720997318657 2020-09-29 20:02:02 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps Well it dosnt look good when you got 6 guys with ARs and you still feel the need to attack a man in a pair of shorts and no shirt like he was hiding a gun in his butt hole.
1310902415353356288 2020-09-29 19:21:05 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps Love how you only address me calling out your spelling. I'm all for the police but that was just shitty. Well at least they didn't kill him for committing no crime. Just tackled him on a sidewalk with no helmet.
1310901607773745152 2020-09-29 19:17:53 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PWiggan78 @andyswats @IvantaTump @EricTrump So if he golfed someplace else it would be ok?
1310899808639516672 2020-09-29 19:10:44 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps I would have deleted and reposted.
1310899661834719234 2020-09-29 19:10:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @CopWithAttitude What do you know of the love of God? God calls anyone not straight an abomination and unnatural.
1310897778646749187 2020-09-29 19:02:40 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps Learn how to spell injured and if I have a bruise I'm injured. He was tackled with no pads on like a foot ball player would wear and no helmet on concrete. That was a dick move when you had 6 guys with rifles and you could have just asked him to put his hands on his head.
1310897286738780165 2020-09-29 19:00:43 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps So all I gotta do is call the cops and say you are suicidal and have a gun and they will come knock you in the dirt and cuff you?
1310896896576286720 2020-09-29 18:59:10 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @SpringSteps Totally, if he was black they would have let him wave knives around before doing anything like that. They could have just asked him to put his hands on his head. You had 6 cops with rifles there.
1310896145833525251 2020-09-29 18:56:11 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Robostop10 @SpringSteps You hit the ground like that and tell me you arnt injured. I'm sure that shit hurt and he was putting up no fight whatsoever.
1310895613391896576 2020-09-29 18:54:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> He's not even wearing a shirt! Nothing in his hands!

1310651321280794626 2020-09-29 02:43:20 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @andyswats @IvantaTump @EricTrump Is these your big arguing points? He legally didn't pay as much in taxes as you want to see and he plays to much golf? Now try and say something good about Joe. The fact that he's scared to debate and has been in politics almost 50 years isn't good.
1310650297698734082 2020-09-29 02:39:16 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @BuddClair Tax is fraud. Non of is should pay it.

Is this a pissing contest and whoever pays the most taxes wins. Income tax is unconstitutional anyway but use it against Trump because you can't say anything good about Joe.

Your candidates ain't worth spit. Trump ain't perfect but he gets things done. If he doesn't its because Democrats in Congress are fighting him.

Tell us more about all the campaign funds transferred to your brothers account. Tell us how you married your own brother to break immigration laws just to be here.

They are droplet. The droplets can travel about 3 ft and then settle on surfaces. The common cold is a Corona virus.

You can try open carrying a pistol you bought off the street but if you get called out on it by the police you are either having a shoot out that won't end well even if you win or arrest you.

My father had years where he payed over 100,000 in taxes. I bet 10 immigrant families don't put that much into the tax pool a year. So many people take more than they have ever given.

You can get your doctor to write you a prescription for meth amphetamines but weed is a gateway drug. Such a tired decades old talking point.

1306341135384707073 2020-09-17 05:16:11 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @nikkifortrumpp @elec_enginerd It made you paranoid because it was illegal and you were afraid of getting in trouble. If it wasn't illegal what would you fear? Also different strains create different highs. You could hate Sativa but love Indica.

That's when you combine a bunch of different ingredients to make a compound drug. All your cold medicine in your bathroom cabinet is more sinful than weed. Did God not give us all the seeds and herbs of 🌎
1306336912056168450 2020-09-17 04:59:25 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @tulsaoufan @nikkifortrumpp Are you talking about alcohol. Alcohol is dangerous. You can die of alcohol poisoning. You must be talking about alcohol because nobody got so stoned they just died.

Ya wanna limit people's right to drink beer because a few assholes can't hold their liquor? It's called personal responsibility. If you smoke and mind your own damn business and don't cause anyone else problems then why be harassed by the government?
1306335242203136001 2020-09-17 04:52:46 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @rayleroad2558 @nikkifortrumpp @TheConservatar8 Yeah, the public's freedom should not be based on mom logic. I got A's in college stoned off my ass. If I was drunk I never would have done that well yet the alcohol is legal.

1306334076354338816 2020-09-17 04:48:08 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @nikkifortrumpp I'm fine with it. I think the way it was made illegal was unconstitutional and as bad as alcohol prohibition. Tylenol will mess up your liver but the FDA has let us eat it for years.

Should lawyers be free of charge also? How about houses? I need a house. I need water. I shouldn't have to pay for those things.😅

1306311431466483712 2020-09-17 03:18:10 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @SpringSteps I can tell you I think this is all a sham . I've been in and out of covid patients rooms for 6 months without catching a cold. Now we really don't even have many positive patients in the hospital but we are still playing this game. I tear it off as soon as I get out the door.

1306309456880439298 2020-09-17 03:10:19 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @iammix24 No, that would imply he is irrationally afraid of you. People need to stop changing the meaning of words. A phobia is an irrational fear.
1306309089266470913 2020-09-17 03:08:51 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @SpringSteps Same here. I work in a hospital and they force me to wear one 8 hours a day and I feel like hell at the end of the day.

1306297650996674560 2020-09-17 02:23:24 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @ForestaWriter @Ilhan That's why Mic Jagger of The Rolling Stones didn't have his heart surgery in England. He came to America. I wonder why? You get what you pay for. Free usually is not the best.
1306296956331925504 2020-09-17 02:20:38 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Ilhan What do you mean we? Stop acting like because you married your brother that you are one of us.

1306228009591017472 2020-09-16 21:46:40 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @calbert1 @IngrahamAngle But Trump voters are the ones always deflecting? You can't defend Joe's idiocy so you have to find something to blame Trump to redirect attention. If you catch a cold you probably blame Trump.

Remember Fast and Furious? And how about weaponising the FBI against political competition using false documents? That's his legacy too.

1305545752224112640 2020-09-15 00:35:37 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @William51446426 @pnjaban How can you have a trial without a defendant? Don't you have to make a criminal arrest? Do you have any other evidence besides what she said? Apparently not enough to arrest Trump for rape.
1305541119938306049 2020-09-15 00:17:13 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @William51446426 @pnjaban You have to prove someone is a rapist before you go out calling them a rapist without proof. That is defamation of character. They did that to Judge Kavanah also. But I guess the #metoo dosnt apply to Biden. Even his running mate was accusing him before she became his VP nominee
1305540244339593216 2020-09-15 00:13:44 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @whoisnemoverne Just the facts
1305539954223853574 2020-09-15 00:12:35 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @MastersonTx @realDonaldTrump So first he wasn't your president and now the entire country is his. You place no responsibility on local government what so ever.
1305539348104990721 2020-09-15 00:10:10 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @KingRickSC137 @Factinate You are human

Explain why you needed FBI agents to surround Roger Stones house at 5 AM like he was El Chapo. You can't. It was all a political show.
1305534027076698112 2020-09-14 23:49:02 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @William51446426 @pnjaban So you can have a trial without bringing someone up on charges?
1305533665804521473 2020-09-14 23:47:36 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @Option713 @ProudNonTheist @realDonaldTrump And you don't ask why that is? Why dosnt Trump have a bunch of people around him killing themselves. I mean getting suicided by Hillary has become a joke even though its real.
1305525736728649733 2020-09-14 23:16:05 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @RealJamesWoods These kids are soft. We used to punch each other in the nuts for fun in the 80s

1305517654669750272 2020-09-14 22:43:58 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @tweettruth2me That's called leaving the country.
1305511334151442433 2020-09-14 22:18:51 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @EricTrump But if you hit him you are racist. Smh

1305510347969826816 2020-09-14 22:14:56 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @whoisnemoverne All these other Americas you have in your head are fictional. This is The Republic of The United States of America.
1305509966959316992 2020-09-14 22:13:25 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @whoisnemoverne Well this is a Republic.

1305504211212341249 2020-09-14 21:50:33 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @William51446426 @pnjaban In order for there to be a case you have to charge someone with a crime.

1305501422029541378 2020-09-14 21:39:28 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @MastersonTx @realDonaldTrump The news screamed about caravans and even showed them migrating to the border. What planet are you on?

1305487944208322563 2020-09-14 20:45:55 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Shut up Joe. What's the word on Vegas. FBI figure that one out yet cuz we really wanna know why a drunk gambling senior citizen went on a highly planned and organized shooting rampage. And then just like that it's over and nobody asks why anymore. I think it was part of your agen
1305486977081503745 2020-09-14 20:42:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @FoxNews It was a kid not even old enough to buy a gun. How would gin control stop him from illegally procuring a gun?

1305454987737268224 2020-09-14 18:34:57 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PROPHETOFTMH You say I know nothing of history but don't think people got hung in the Army. Shit, you got hung for stealing a horse! Keep on throwing insults and calling me a racist though. It makes you look real smart.
1305454476514529281 2020-09-14 18:32:56 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PROPHETOFTMH In the United States, before the Civil War, deserters from the Army were flogged; after 1861, tattoos or branding were also used. The maximum U.S. penalty for desertion in wartime remains death, although this punishment was last applied to Eddie Slovik in 1945.

They bought slaves from black slave traders. But if you want to believe white people are so mighty that we can travel to a foreign continent and just catch thousands of people go ahead.

You just said that but im the racist idiot? How is God making my race become extinct and not yours? You spout a lot of opinions about me without ever really answering questions. Just keep calling people racist.

I've been working around covid pts in a hospital since the begining. It's like a Joke now. We hate wearing these mask 8 hours a day and only do so because it is a term of employment. Not because we are scared of getting Corona virus.

1301265348424069120 2020-09-03 05:06:50 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JoeBiden Why? That's a lovely opinion with no reason behind it. It's like me saying "Joe Biden would be the worst president you could chose to handle the current state of The Nation."
1301264285121810434 2020-09-03 05:02:36 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @kirstiealley It's a phoney made up nonsense made up by a science fiction writer and practitioner of the magic of Aleister Crowley and a pedophile. You are a half step from a straight up Satanist. Bat shit crazy cult.
1301263142165647361 2020-09-03 04:58:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @5starloeber @TalKopan It is! She is shaming people ad forcing America to follow rules she doesn't follow herself. She needs to step down and let loose those reigns of power she is gripping in her skeletal hands.

1301261257295753217 2020-09-03 04:50:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @sajmay28 I'd piss on them and watch how fast they pop up.
1301260950050398208 2020-09-03 04:49:21 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @TheLeoTerrell @FoxNews @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Sure, get one of Trump's haters from Fox to host it. That's fair.
1301260184430534660 2020-09-03 04:46:18 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JackPosobiec Because she's white!

1301257261055082496 2020-09-03 04:34:41 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @cibervago @AOC Yeah, wasn't that great how she kept all those Amazon jobs out of New York? She's so awesome at whatever it is she does.
1301256553404792834 2020-09-03 04:31:53 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @stucktx1 @3volved @AOC I thought It was that you have five followers. What does my age have to do with the fact that Ocasio is a socialist idiot who doesn't really know what she is doing but being payed more than most hard working Americans. It should make you sad too.
1301255954198147072 2020-09-03 04:29:30 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @3volved @AOC I guess I shouldn't hate on crooks just because I don't want to be one?

1301230714319523840 2020-09-03 02:49:12 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @AOC The saddest thing is you will get a pension from a job you only did a few years. You are barely an adult who knows what work is. Talk to me after you have dedicated 20 years of your life to something other than basic education.
1301229777148313601 2020-09-03 02:45:29 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @iammix24 That outta help Joe since he loves to bash Trump on Fox.

1301202446132416516 2020-09-03 00:56:52 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @IlhanMN We are so tired of you and who you think you are. Nobody with a brain buys anything you say. You illegally married your brother and stole a million in campaign finance but we are supposed to trust you? Never!
1301201408079917056 2020-09-03 00:52:45 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @catturd2 That's why you are the turd. I didn't follow you because of any reputation you had or number of followers. I followed because I genuinely liked your tweets.
1301199544718430209 2020-09-03 00:45:21 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @catturd2 So obvious that he dislikes Trump. I don't know why he works for Fox. Actually I don't know why I still watch Fox other than Tucker.
1301187331437793281 2020-09-02 23:56:49 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @TXDeplorable45 And you wonder why they call us Nazis? Cuz of people like you!

1301170346486312961 2020-09-02 22:49:19 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @JAYCEECHEEK Basically you would have to stop wearing sneaker or flashy suits because that's white people culture. We wore that stuff first.
1301169911524401154 2020-09-02 22:47:36 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @catturd2 Extra money
1301161765947019264 2020-09-02 22:15:14 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist It's my opinion that the pope is supposed to be humble? Really? I think we are done.
1301161060859248640 2020-09-02 22:12:25 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist Because he's supposed to be humble. Nothing humble about the way the pope dresses.
1301160385110839296 2020-09-02 22:09:44 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist The word pope isn't in the bible. I don't know why you think he is important
1301156385066045440 2020-09-02 21:53:51 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist The Lord does move in mysterious ways. He loved Peter so much but Peter had shakey faith. First he sunk in the sea and then he denied him 3 times and didn't acknowledge his resurrection until he saw him again weeks later.
1301155707937533952 2020-09-02 21:51:09 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist Linus was the first pope. Peter never called himself pope or had ruby red slippers and fish mouth Dagon hats.
1301155432908681216 2020-09-02 21:50:04 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist If a pope can go to hell how was he worthy to represent Christ on earth on the first place. Sounds like a whore drunk on the blood of the Saints.
1301155164787806208 2020-09-02 21:49:00 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist Paul said "I die daily" maybe everyday you have to be reserved and reborn.
1301154886336286730 2020-09-02 21:47:53 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist Romans 10 will show you how your deeds have little to do with your salvation. Your good works are just the fruit of faith.
1301154207970492417 2020-09-02 21:45:12 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist You do realize people have bought their way into the papacy just to have the power. It had nothing to do with bringing glory to God. Show me in bible where it says to pray to Saints? Show me The Hail Mary in the bible. Show me were she is called the queen of heave.
1301153584080400384 2020-09-02 21:42:43 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist No place does it ever say there should be a succession of popes with the authority of Christ. No where does it say to celebrate Jesus resurrection as Easter. You will find the word Easter once in the bible and it says nothing about it being connected to Christ.
1301152792833392642 2020-09-02 21:39:34 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist What?

What great words did Mythra speak that started a revolution that changed the world? Even Napolean marveled at what Christ conquered without lifting a finger.
1301151012053495808 2020-09-02 21:32:30 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @iammix24 Glad you told me cuz I would never know otherwise. Not watching that crap.
1301150755928379399 2020-09-02 21:31:29 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @LionelMedia That we stole land from Indians. We may have bought it with beads but they agreed to sell.

1301149818828533761 2020-09-02 21:27:45 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @McClue1 @Labyrinth_free @ArtValley818_ Schizophrenic or Demon possessed? If you are going to believe she could read your mind how much more of a stretch is it to believe she is possessed by an ancient being that can read you like a book?
1301149383736647684 2020-09-02 21:26:01 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @McClue1 @Labyrinth_free @ArtValley818_ That's called Pantheism. You see the creator and the creation as one in the same.
1301149068484390912 2020-09-02 21:24:46 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @PanesarsPorkers @nixonist Then again if it was the merit of our deeds that got us into heaven we would all burn. All of our good works are as filthy rags before the eyes of the Lord.

1300902766274113536 2020-09-02 05:06:03 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @nixonist I understand. It's hard. I never found anyone that sticks around and now I'm old and don't care so much. But I know that feeling when you feel like you have to find that other half. Good luck, I feel for you.
1300794470561185794 2020-09-01 21:55:44 +0800 <JamesDRichard3> @atensnut Yes but you are using the term Manchurian candidate wrong.
