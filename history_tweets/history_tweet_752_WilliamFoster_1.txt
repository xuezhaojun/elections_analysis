Does that make any sense to you? Seriously, do you think through any of this before regurgitating the talking points fed to you by your MSM overlords?

Have you seriously not considered the ramifications of these policies? What is the goal you’d like achieved here? 0 deaths from the virus? I can’t take people like you seriously.

The flu has been all but eradicated this year. CDC is not even tracking it anymore. Why is that? Please inform yourself on these matters before posting lies.   https://t.co/wWxzpUn83B

This is a perfect example of the “trolley problem.” You’d route it to the upper track.  https://t.co/ZN5p2Jr0Ro
