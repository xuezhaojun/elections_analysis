1342116640578797569 2020-12-24 22:35:17 +0800 <KenKardashain> Basically we felt safe, for the most part. Now times have changed and we no longer feel safe, our reward for towing the line (mostly) was/is to see republican militants who now wear suits instead of balaclavas get everything they ask for.
1342115513741279233 2020-12-24 22:30:48 +0800 <KenKardashain> Also many of those involved with law and order lived alongside or in areas that were predominantly Unionist/Loyalist. We respected these people.
1342114638092263426 2020-12-24 22:27:19 +0800 <KenKardashain> The appetite for such a campaign wasn't really there, people were not as liable to want to break the law, big house Unionism had Christian values when push came to shove, a sense of morality and a need for normality.
1342112504911179778 2020-12-24 22:18:51 +0800 <KenKardashain> Northern Ireland 100 years under seige, 40 years of constant bombing and we're still here, funny thing is we didn't really fight back that much on the same scale as republicans, not because we couldn't, the numbers were/are always on our side, imagine if we had of.

1341767050746847235 2020-12-23 23:26:08 +0800 <KenKardashain> Let's unpack this, residents of NI have to basically isolate because people arriving from the UK and ROI didn't, so to fight the "new strain" people now arriving from the UK and the ROI still don't have to but we still do, is Stormont a mencap day release scheme?

1338866337158860805 2020-12-15 23:19:44 +0800 <KenKardashain> Michael Stone is my poet.
1338865787369492480 2020-12-15 23:17:33 +0800 <KenKardashain> The preferred First Minister speaks.
1338865575091556354 2020-12-15 23:16:42 +0800 <KenKardashain> If I identify as a top lawyer say a QC, are the government being ableist by not granting me a salary fitting to my role, however bizarre that may be?

1338853410641080321 2020-12-15 22:28:22 +0800 <KenKardashain> This is what you're up against when you genuinely want change, which is, quite literally, impossible.
1338852847568318465 2020-12-15 22:26:08 +0800 <KenKardashain> The political spectrum outside of twitter is as follows, to be generous let's say 10% of passionate folk on the hard left, 10% on the far right with the other 80% comprising of people who watch gogglebox, BGT and the X Factor etc, who btw all wear masks because a celebrity does.
1338847312823644161 2020-12-15 22:04:08 +0800 <KenKardashain> Import the third world etc etc
1338837471111548934 2020-12-15 21:25:02 +0800 <KenKardashain> The biggest lol re Eastwoods republican trolling is matched only by the surprise of some, who obviously are not paying attention.

1337539204239273984 2020-12-12 07:26:11 +0800 <KenKardashain> Here's one of said poems, "We killed women we killed kids  We had no potatoes so we banged bin lids - we killed pensioners, soldiers, White or Black, but we are cowards so we shot them in the back"   https://t.co/DhqwmX42QN
1337404845565882373 2020-12-11 22:32:17 +0800 <KenKardashain> When will it become socially acceptable to have the vaccine, will we get to the point when it's comparable to the spoof terms racism or homophobia, maybe vaccphobic, people getting arrested for not conforming etc, wait for it.

1337386604437106695 2020-12-11 21:19:48 +0800 <KenKardashain> No, the government and the media stopped the world, some people got the flu and everyone had to suffer, now we have a vaccine for something with a 99% recovery rate, ie you have a 1% chance of dying, why are journalists at the bbc ignoring this?
1337355073664540672 2020-12-11 19:14:31 +0800 <KenKardashain> Q: why is there no flu deaths any more?  A: because people are wearing face masks and practising social distancing  Q: so why are there so many covid cases?  A: because people aren‚Äôt wearing their face masks or practising social distancing

1336437059712585731 2020-12-09 06:26:39 +0800 <KenKardashain> Brave and caring is how people are describing the sobbing mp on sky today, something to do with covid, I don't remember any tears or even a frown when kids were getting raped or murdered in parks, anyone else?

1336419107319787520 2020-12-09 05:15:19 +0800 <KenKardashain> @Udlah @wackyj67 Top of the NL, Antrim Rd end ?

1336310139490590723 2020-12-08 22:02:19 +0800 <KenKardashain> We're being herded in terms of political outlook re the covid jab, that will make things easier if the passport thing ever happens, who complied and who didn't, who's far right and who's an antivax hippy, etc etc, just saying.
1336305782934155279 2020-12-08 21:45:00 +0800 <KenKardashain> @Wotadini Nice, audible?
1336295291390222337 2020-12-08 21:03:19 +0800 <KenKardashain> Given what we know about other state agents this doesn't really add up.
1336294488571080707 2020-12-08 21:00:07 +0800 <KenKardashain> If we tested everyone from 9 to 90 for cancer the rates would go up, if we tested everyone from 9 to 90 for a brain cell, I'm not quite sure what the results would be.

1334571477224615938 2020-12-04 02:53:29 +0800 <KenKardashain> Congratulations to Billy McBilly the 3rd, who has won a place on the policing board, the fact that he was injured in action blowing up a nursery school whilst freeing Ireland from the Irish, should have made him education minister, it's disappointing but we move forward.
1334562111058567169 2020-12-04 02:16:16 +0800 <KenKardashain> We at the UFV don't do whataboutery, everyone else does, we deal in facts, the fact is that someone else did something so we did something to them, because they did whataboutery, its not rocket science.
1334554949909426180 2020-12-04 01:47:49 +0800 <KenKardashain> @WestBelfastUPRG Beggars belief mate.
1334545587723771907 2020-12-04 01:10:37 +0800 <KenKardashain> @BBCJayneMcC Wet pubs or clubs with food in with a chance?
1334545116883718144 2020-12-04 01:08:45 +0800 <KenKardashain> Next week marks the anniversary of the death of our UFV solicitor, Billy 'Shooter' McBilly, he was never in the UDA but liked a few pints in the loyalist, his whole family and close associates were involved in the struggle to free the ROI from the Irish, but not him, honestly.
1334541685699846150 2020-12-04 00:55:07 +0800 <KenKardashain> One of our mlas, Billy McBilly was recently accused of hateful speech on social media, he was quoted as saying fuk the pope, after a lengthy consultation with party members we have decided to add ulster scots to all of our street names as a punishment to those who were offended.
1334538379871072257 2020-12-04 00:41:58 +0800 <KenKardashain> Many Catholics were killed in the 30 year war, that was unfortunate but they knew what would happen if they went shopping, or just fancied a walk or had to work, it's their fault, in fact Johnny said on the BBC "shit happens" so that's good enough for us.
1334535788357414914 2020-12-04 00:31:41 +0800 <KenKardashain> Followers of the UFV usually prodify their names, for instance if you were named John or Jean or Peter for instance then your prod name would be Billy McBilly, you use this new name on social media to let everyone know that you hate the Irish.
1334527099038797825 2020-12-03 23:57:09 +0800 <KenKardashain> The party (UFV) have asked for a referendum in the ROI where people will vote on the question of unity with the UK. 3000 of them have been murdered because they don't want to but its only because they don't listen.
1334524655412109321 2020-12-03 23:47:26 +0800 <KenKardashain> Many of our reporters come from the Shankill and Tigers Bay area, most are called William or Billy, they are 50/50 and have no links or family ties or leanings toward loyalism.
1334523836134535170 2020-12-03 23:44:11 +0800 <KenKardashain> Johnny is always on the BBC as a political commentator, where he advertises his new book and talks about his other job, a primary school teacher, he teaches history and the kids love him.
1334523188433260546 2020-12-03 23:41:37 +0800 <KenKardashain> The Party they run is called the Ulster Freedom Volunteers but it has no connection to loyalist paramilitaries and the media never ask them about the supposed links, in fact Johnny nor Michael were ever involved in anything.
1334522406577246216 2020-12-03 23:38:30 +0800 <KenKardashain> In a parallel world Johnny Adair and Micheal Stone are mlas, Johnny is JFM, every year they celebrate publicly and lay wreaths for past Uvf members in Monaghan and Dublin.
1334519613065932800 2020-12-03 23:27:24 +0800 <KenKardashain> Their existence and their quest for a UI fills the ranks of Loyalism, it is what it is, cause and effect.
1334517429075107841 2020-12-03 23:18:43 +0800 <KenKardashain> @petrolheadtoo The media love libs and identity politics, the Dup represent the old school of thought or what's left of it, they're only allowed on air to be mocked.
1334510173604503559 2020-12-03 22:49:54 +0800 <KenKardashain> Today I am mostly playing Burzum riffs on my guitar, twitter can fuck off.

1334507288003014656 2020-12-03 22:38:26 +0800 <KenKardashain> The UI question is in NI politics purely to satisfy Republicans, ie SF and the SDLP, Unionism and Loyalism has nothing to gain from it, it is divisive and keeps us on a war footing, it is a virtual gun to our heads, why do we pander to it?

1334474341615095810 2020-12-03 20:27:31 +0800 <KenKardashain> Very timely, the guy with the info on finucane, probably just a coincidence.
1334473417639256068 2020-12-03 20:23:50 +0800 <KenKardashain> Deadly snow coming this winter, it's going to be the same snow as every year but this snow is deadly, we need to close all the shops and everyone needs to stay in, don't be researching any previous years snowfall, just believe me.

1334233945588772865 2020-12-03 04:32:16 +0800 <KenKardashain> @BegbieCat3 Indeed, the blueprint they use is genetically covid 19 though, made in a lab, ( like actual C19) but that's a different tweet.
1334231554722304001 2020-12-03 04:22:46 +0800 <KenKardashain> I don't think there's any conspiracy theories connected to the covid saga relating to the government and finance etc, they're just silly bastards, is it a Chinese bio weapon, probably not but I'm convinced it came from there.
1334229771509788674 2020-12-03 04:15:40 +0800 <KenKardashain> @davbladesblood @UnityNewsNet Mask on too, a model citizen really.
1334228900654813190 2020-12-03 04:12:13 +0800 <KenKardashain> @BegbieCat3 The blue print they use is as bad, it still fuks with your natural immune system, so if you're not likely to get covid why would you get a vaccine which btw has a 99% recovery rate ü§î
1334224494035148800 2020-12-03 03:54:42 +0800 <KenKardashain> @BegbieCat3 They have to inject it into you, even in tiny miniscule doses for the vaccine to work, along with all the other shite.
1334223804814544897 2020-12-03 03:51:58 +0800 <KenKardashain> @medianewspy Wouldn't matter if he was a fully sworn in member or just an innocent peace loving man, whilst innocent kids were fair game to the ira so most certainly was he. Its not about his guilt anyway, it's about collusion and mopery.
1334218122426015745 2020-12-03 03:29:23 +0800 <KenKardashain> To all the folk taking the vaccine who don't or won't get covid, you now have covid, 2020 logic isn't 20-20 vision.
1334216974214303745 2020-12-03 03:24:49 +0800 <KenKardashain> @CllrMichaelLong No room on the bus shelters?
1334216531266428930 2020-12-03 03:23:04 +0800 <KenKardashain> Something something train, we need people to lower their immune systems, aye that's a powerful incentive üò¨
1334213719409225730 2020-12-03 03:11:53 +0800 <KenKardashain> Why are people screeching about people *not* taking any vaccine, if you're taking it then you're covered, mind your business.
1334208660025782275 2020-12-03 02:51:47 +0800 <KenKardashain> Gotta say yes tbh, who films outside a copshop anyway without authorisation, shoe pie and beaten with hoses for this guy.

1333916791647645696 2020-12-02 07:32:00 +0800 <KenKardashain> I won't mention other areas of affluence and influence but County down is a good indicator, the same connections with the same brainwashing modus operandi, again under the guise of sport and church.
1333915839599439872 2020-12-02 07:28:13 +0800 <KenKardashain> Therin lies the connection and the base for the brainwashing, and anti British propaganda that has been drilled into children from primary school to university, I don't need to mention any teachers names as they are well known.
1333913986761428993 2020-12-02 07:20:52 +0800 <KenKardashain> The hoodlums were sent to st patricks or "barney" as it was called, a prime breeding ground for future insurgents. The link they all had was the gaa and catholic Church, two of the most sectarian organisations in NI.
1333913224182427648 2020-12-02 07:17:50 +0800 <KenKardashain> These people were/are as sectarian as the rest of us, behind closed doors we all have our own personal beliefs, as like so many people who live in NI they too knew who was involved and who wasn't, st malachys grammar school wasn't full of new lodge street hoodlums.
1333911985172443137 2020-12-02 07:12:54 +0800 <KenKardashain> The area where pat finucane lived was mainly made up of affluent catholics, barristers, medical types and company owners etc etc, the catholic version of the malone Rd one can say, that stretched to glengormley in one direction and to Greencastle in the other.
1333910421938507778 2020-12-02 07:06:42 +0800 <KenKardashain> Not the working class republicans though, they were in the pub too, middle class and affluent republican families exist here and its they who played the long game. Don't believe the hype that all catholics lived 20 to a house whilst the prods all lived on the Malone Rd.
1333909333348855812 2020-12-02 07:02:22 +0800 <KenKardashain> There will always be a hierarchy of victims because SF have brainwashed themselves and their minions into believing that they and only they are the victims, aided by republican sympathetic media and legal high flyers, they were in school while we were in the pub.

1333808371779121153 2020-12-02 00:21:11 +0800 <KenKardashain> An enquiry into finucane on behalf of republicans is like having a rapist be the judge at his own trial, in fact that's what the gfa feels like to loyalism since its inception, do the least but get blamed for everything.

1330245668057780225 2020-11-22 04:24:16 +0800 <KenKardashain> Imagine not being able to spell your heroes name, a typical criminal trait really.  https://t.co/cvYOzwtmrg
1330242885346844672 2020-11-22 04:13:13 +0800 <KenKardashain> You were allowed to get away with it by the tolerant British Army, for a further 60 years too, had those big bad brits been as bad as your propaganda makes out, the curbstones of Dublin would be red white and blue now.
1330235722629083145 2020-11-22 03:44:45 +0800 <KenKardashain> They're all dead, would be good.
1330230396135596041 2020-11-22 03:23:35 +0800 <KenKardashain> @Tacochip1 Of course its a good thing, barbarism is the natural state of man, we're obviously poles apart here in outlook so I can't see this chat going anywhere, continue if you want though.

1330221245418393601 2020-11-22 02:47:13 +0800 <KenKardashain> Irish ethnonats unfriending me because I won't spoon with them over 1916 or whatever, I respect your ethno claim but don't expect anyone to admire or respect the ira in any form, be it pre 1921 or not, its like 'no more brother wars" with a caveat.
1330201271450673167 2020-11-22 01:27:51 +0800 <KenKardashain> @UBlackshirt Definitely, they'll get the lefty loyalist vote before the Tuv will sadly, that's a lot of votes, a lot of traitors.

1330196121457668097 2020-11-22 01:07:23 +0800 <KenKardashain> When libs and republicans say Unionists and Loyalists have nothing to fear in a new Ireland and that SF have a mandate, so people voted for a party that contains convicted murderers, a party that celebrates murder and said murderers, nothing to fear there at all, totally legit üôÑ
1330191532826255361 2020-11-22 00:49:09 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Its fact, the ira were just plain old sectarian murderers for no cause only murder and hatred of protestants, The Army let it continue to learn from it for future conflicts, otherwise they'd have flattened Belfast and the other strongholds in a week.
1330189579329167366 2020-11-22 00:41:24 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Well with that tweet you are saying the bloody sunday thing was justified, so he's correct, that was fun and pointless üôÑ
1330187967592337410 2020-11-22 00:34:59 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP And you approve of this?
1330187779704283139 2020-11-22 00:34:15 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Catholic civilians I said, not republicans, the ra killed far more, half of their suspected touts were not involved in anything, Jean McConville, the 17 yr old special needs boy, the list is endless
1330186270883057669 2020-11-22 00:28:15 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP You called the ira good soldiers though, so killing civilians was ok? I don't agree with that.
1330185825351573504 2020-11-22 00:26:29 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Don't forget the ira killed more catholics than loyalists and the Army combined, how do you qualify that?
1330185197007085570 2020-11-22 00:23:59 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Random catholics were as much targets as the protestant women and children blown up while out shopping, or those shot in a church, or those shot coming home from work.
1330184496570839047 2020-11-22 00:21:12 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Nope, less than 1% because instead of being shot they were arrested, they were finished had the Irish government not aided them, that didn't last long though as they touted themselves silly, good soldiers aye üëç
1330182327662731279 2020-11-22 00:12:35 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Yes it was retaliation, still works out less than 1% of active provos killed compared to what the provos did to them, if only they'd killed them all.
1330180039548276736 2020-11-22 00:03:29 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP No, loyalists retaliated, soldiers made mistakes, how many soldiers did the ira arrest and jail, none, they murdered then cried when less than 1% of their asu's the British Army arrested were shot.
1330178913696411651 2020-11-21 23:59:01 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Base it on the reality of living in NI through the "troubles" I'm pretty well educated seeing first hand the monstrous murders of women and children at the hands of your heroes, of which you know absolutely nothing about, evidently.
1330177090705117189 2020-11-21 23:51:46 +0800 <KenKardashain> @SCUMLARP Criminals is all the ra ever were, peados and abusers of their own people, own it.

1330163721147133961 2020-11-21 22:58:39 +0800 <KenKardashain> @xColmx @BritNatAdam But IS are insurgents, criminals, just like the ira, in fact they copied them, they all need gassed.

1329893385822461953 2020-11-21 05:04:26 +0800 <KenKardashain> Is Poots wrong, did the NHS cut back beds and staff to accommodate new managers for this and that because of the fear of being sued, more bureaucracy = less care.
1329838092128309254 2020-11-21 01:24:43 +0800 <KenKardashain> Insufficient grounds, really means validation that the breakout was lawful and further cements the republican illusion that their murderous campaign of criminality was justified @JimAllister @JamieBrysonCPNI

1325540398853459971 2020-11-09 04:47:13 +0800 <KenKardashain> Whataboutery from a republican, who knows full well the reason for this has nothing to do with the NI conflict, he'll probably tell you the GAA has no sympathies for the ira though, bright chap is Sam.

1325430450924425216 2020-11-08 21:30:19 +0800 <KenKardashain> Made worse by the fact that they got away with it, rewarded for it, voted in because of it and the rest, protected by the government, makes you wonder.
1325427962750103553 2020-11-08 21:20:26 +0800 <KenKardashain> There won't be any autistic screeching from Trump supporters that turns into violence on the streets, but can you imagine the place if Trump overturned this now, that's why it won't happen, such is the power of the msm.

1324742174878158849 2020-11-06 23:55:21 +0800 <KenKardashain> Biden winning the election is like working people voting to become unemployed, (regardless of your opinions on capitalism etc, most people can't spell it nevermind understand it) anyway I digress, its highly unlikely in a healthy society, we're not.
1324736402454683650 2020-11-06 23:32:25 +0800 <KenKardashain> All the big name diss right guys are hating on Trump, Spencer, keet etc, this time next year they'll probably be in a re-education camp.

1324692380541485056 2020-11-06 20:37:29 +0800 <KenKardashain> Will Biden take the presidential wage, doesn't Trump donate his quarterly to various departments, media silence on this topic.

1323668575895375872 2020-11-04 00:49:15 +0800 <KenKardashain> Watching the Trump Biden thing on the msm is like watching a Man U Liverpool match, on the Liverpool sky channel hosted by Kenny Dalglish and Stephen Gerrard.
