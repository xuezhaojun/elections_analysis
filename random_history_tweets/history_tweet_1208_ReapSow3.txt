Democrats are responsible for 66,000,000 ABORTIONS since 1973.  ABORTION should not be used as a form of birth control.

1328461239119474689 2020-11-17 06:13:35 +0800 <ReapSow3> Maggie sweetums, you've not lived long enough to make that statement.
1328460528356823046 2020-11-17 06:10:46 +0800 <ReapSow3> But it's a Democrat mask.
1328460265055281152 2020-11-17 06:09:43 +0800 <ReapSow3> I hope you don't try  that on my brother who lives in Michigan. He's a Vietnam vet. Masks can be used as a bandage, I think.
1328459506913828866 2020-11-17 06:06:42 +0800 <ReapSow3> Democrats are responsible for 60,000,000 ABORTIONS since 1973.  How is that pro life?
1328458876971339782 2020-11-17 06:04:12 +0800 <ReapSow3> @left_site y'all are never happy.

1328451632212881409 2020-11-17 05:35:25 +0800 <ReapSow3> Sweetie, It's a good thing I didn't have anything to do today. Harris had two r's.  Oh build back better isn't original with Biden. He "borrowed" it from a lot of other people.. .
1328451048713949184 2020-11-17 05:33:06 +0800 <ReapSow3> Crushing what? Freedom?
1328450105645608961 2020-11-17 05:29:21 +0800 <ReapSow3> Sweetie, my mom would have washed my mouth out with soap if I'd used those words.  And stop watching CNN. You missed a whole lot of news about a laptop.  .
1328449372909080576 2020-11-17 05:26:26 +0800 <ReapSow3> Who pays for that free stuff?  Taxes pay for that free stuff! Who pays taxes?   And again Harris had two r's. .
1328448882716663808 2020-11-17 05:24:29 +0800 <ReapSow3> Something is very wrong with you guys. You are the third or fourth person who doesn't know how to spell Harris. #Biden/haris2020.

1328444884487954439 2020-11-17 05:08:36 +0800 <ReapSow3> Oh sweetie, no cussing please. Also Harris has two "r's".
1328444509743706112 2020-11-17 05:07:07 +0800 <ReapSow3> Biden won literally because more dead people voted for him. My cat could have won with all that voter fraud.

My husband has German ancestors. I found a variation of our last name in two books that I read.   Imo people haven't been taught how bad it was.

I've seen some of the things on the dems tweets and they are vile. I have not seen the caring for others like here.   At first I made a joke about seeing the hate on their faces but it is. 😢😢
1327448678160855041 2020-11-14 11:10:02 +0800 <ReapSow3> @Ilovemeowmakers Thx I will tell my son.   What really made me upset, son asked hospital to call his heart doctor but they didn't. And since no one could go into hospital, he had no one to be his advocate.   I'm very thankful that he's ok now. He's got four kids.
1327447198896955392 2020-11-14 11:04:09 +0800 <ReapSow3> @HuntCongressAz I just wonder how bad it will have to get before these people finally realize they are being victimized by their governors &amp; mayors. When they are in a cattle car on the way to the camps?  Sorry I'm weary of these politicians who are mistreating citizens.

In late August he woke up throwing up blood before passing out in bathroom. He spent a week in hospital, 4 days in icu, with bleeding in his esophagus. He takes blood thinners so.

1327441745269956610 2020-11-14 10:42:29 +0800 <ReapSow3> @Ilovemeowmakers What makes me very sad is my grandkids have to wear them to school and everywhere. Covering up their sweet, cute faces. It's robbing them of their identity. Masks have taken away our smile s. Shields, I guess, would be better. 😢😢😢
1327440552955174913 2020-11-14 10:37:45 +0800 <ReapSow3> That sounds like a threat.

1322873200162836485 2020-11-01 20:08:43 +0800 <ReapSow3> @AndyRamsden4 Every clip I see of Harris she has the oddest behavior for someone running for VP.  Would like to know what a psychologist has to say about it.  For me it makes me even more uncomfortable thinking she could possibly be president.
1322870157497294849 2020-11-01 19:56:37 +0800 <ReapSow3> @RolandiaKarnak Agree but I could probably make Biden look bad.   Why have the democrats put the two most obviously unelectable people up for President and vice president.  Just realized, "vice" is appropriate for Harris. 🙀😤😿

1322746137414160387 2020-11-01 11:43:49 +0800 <ReapSow3> @iamjumpingin I remember someone on Twitter criticizing ACB for wearing a dress instead of a suit to the SC  confirmation hearings.   Harris looks like a 50 something teenager.

Some one at the church we attend is feeling the same way as you. They don't think God can protect them from the virus. My question is, do you pray for God to heal someone with a disease or injury?

That's the most racist remark I've heard in a long time.  Plus you lost your argument when you called them rural CITIZENS.

I requested mine yesterday.  They sent me two. Guess I could have requested one for my cat.   The mail in ballots are sent to everyone WITHOUT being requested.

So 5 months later that hospital is saying his bleeding esophagus is covid19 side effects. I know that’s why they put him on vent. I have no words to say how mad I am.

Those same people could have also died from any complications from an infection or bacteria other than virus.   Wonder if those same people might have also died from seasonal flu.   How many died from H1N1 w/same health issues?
