This paper by @JkayFlake &amp; @EikoFried is so long overdue.   https://t.co/Sc9Jidx1qo
1331636463352631301 2020-11-26 00:30:48 +0800 <AliciaGCork> Combining psychology &amp; data science is an area with SO much untapped potential.

1331142325498744832 2020-11-24 15:47:16 +0800 <AliciaGCork> The contents of this textbook looks like exactly what I needed at the beginning of my PhD. This looks like a fantastic starting point for anyone looking to get into computational social science, and it's even open access!

1314287586773544962 2020-10-09 03:32:33 +0800 <AliciaGCork> .@scahalan's latest book 'The Great Pretender' provides compelling evidence for the necessity of more transparent research practices ðŸ¤¯ Definitely recommend for anyone interested in understanding more about the history of psychiatry.
