1321461889822576646 2020-10-28 22:40:40 +0800 <VPNightshade> So after @TuckerCarlson interview last night w/#Bobulinski I've come to believe that the actions &amp; the #Russia Lies of @AdamSchiff have done more damage to Dems &amp; Biden than any other one thing. Let's hear what you have to say: RT b4 you take the poll, pls.
1321444897073909768 2020-10-28 21:33:09 +0800 <VPNightshade> We double and triple check our ballots when they are printed, then they scan the paper copy and the paper copy gets filed. We have Photo ID requirements so it's a good system here.   But you are right, any determined insider can cheat.
1321443536462434304 2020-10-28 21:27:44 +0800 <VPNightshade> IKR?  Just one more reason why Biden supporters should take the the day off!   Who wants to stand in long lines when they got this in the bag?!  #stayathome Libs  #YouGotThis !!!  #MakeItANetflixDay !!!
1321440993678364673 2020-10-28 21:17:38 +0800 <VPNightshade> It's sickening. Win or Lose, Wray needs to be fired on November 4th, he's a huge POS!
1321440623157825539 2020-10-28 21:16:10 +0800 <VPNightshade> Good for you, my youngest son and I are voting early IN-PERSON today!  https://t.co/SPylz595TF
1321440122693451777 2020-10-28 21:14:11 +0800 <VPNightshade> This is just another reason why he needs to be in a cell.   But, as far as the election goes in order for that to happen, Trump has to beat him.  Biden's best chance is to win. He gets away w/ everything then. It's being covered up by the media now, if he wins it all goes away.
1321437982449192961 2020-10-28 21:05:40 +0800 <VPNightshade> Still won't remove him from the ballot, nor will it remove #HeelsUp
1321435832121774080 2020-10-28 20:57:08 +0800 <VPNightshade> No way. It makes no difference.  He's on the ballot. He could stroke out and still win the election. He has a running mate who is also on the ballot.  Trump needs to beat him there is no way around it.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  #VoteTrump2020ToSaveAmerica

1321423783819956224 2020-10-28 20:09:15 +0800 <VPNightshade> Yeah, just not reported on by those #traitors at @CNN @MSNBC who are working triple time to suppress the vote.  Remember everyone, get out of your cars AND VOTE!  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  #VoteTrump2020ToSaveAmerica

1321295353191215105 2020-10-28 11:38:55 +0800 <VPNightshade> How embarrassing for them.

1321293240088354818 2020-10-28 11:30:31 +0800 <VPNightshade> Because Wray is a deep state schill who is going to be fired on Nov 4th, win or lose? #FollowTheMoney

1314256015119052801 2020-10-09 01:27:06 +0800 <VPNightshade> I am tired of seeing ppl here and elsewhere on social media saying, "oh, that won't happen..." FFS people their telling you what they are going to do:  BELIEVE THEM!  You should be more scared of an honest f*g Dem than you are the 'Rona - I am. #Trump2020  #TrumpPence2020
1314254353742663680 2020-10-09 01:20:30 +0800 <VPNightshade> I am all 4 taking ppl @ their word.  He said it was, so it is. When a Dem tells u something believe them! If they tell u they will raise taxes, believe them! If they tell u they will take ur guns, believe them! If they tell u they will pack the SC, believe them! No more excuses!

Thank god they weren't counting the people who had 'co-morbidities' as dying of the Swine Flu, Like they do under Covid today.  Wonder what the death toll would have been if they had done that.

1314206645065457666 2020-10-08 22:10:55 +0800 <VPNightshade> @realDonaldTrump this is a FABULOUS idea!  Debate from a stage at a rally!
1314205618589237248 2020-10-08 22:06:50 +0800 <VPNightshade> How about calling him a sexual abuser when she said she believed his accusers?
1314204566955585543 2020-10-08 22:02:40 +0800 <VPNightshade> I am sure that was very painful for her to admit to.

1314200111929528320 2020-10-08 21:44:57 +0800 <VPNightshade> It's become stupid questions @ this point.  Yes, they're going 2 ban tracking, YES they're going 2 pack the court, YES they say they'll do away w/Trump tax cuts, since EVERYONE got a tax cut EVERYONE'S taxes will GO UP! THEN they're GOING 2 RAISE SPENDING by 4T for their agenda.

1312105348824625152 2020-10-03 03:01:07 +0800 <VPNightshade> You think Trump hates immigrants, I know Trump is married to an immigrant.

1312104886658449409 2020-10-03 02:59:17 +0800 <VPNightshade> You see Trump’s racism, I see Trump’s words being misconstrued and twisted by the media daily to fit their narrative.  You see Trump as a Republican, I see Trump as a Patriot.  You see Trump as a dictator, I see Trump as a leader.
