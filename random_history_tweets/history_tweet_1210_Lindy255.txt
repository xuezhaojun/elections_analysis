1343772265293504514 2020-12-29 12:14:08 +0800 <Lindy255> @Roshan_Rinaldi I read this was photoshopped to make him look larger but there wasn't a lot of difference. His waist size is probably around 52in.
1343768431624073216 2020-12-29 11:58:54 +0800 <Lindy255> @mdnij34 Yes, trump wouldn't do it.

Nothing would make me happier than to see him lose his position as Senate majority leader. He is one of the biggest fraudsters in the govt. Second only to trump.

1343252212898795521 2020-12-28 01:47:38 +0800 <Lindy255> @RodneyCaston Accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt. Trump knows only criminals.

They can't overturn the election. Police will turn them away like they did the fake GOP electors.They can be arrested for sedition.

Do you really believe that a "Godly man" would pardon men who killed unarmed children and adult civilians for no reason.17 people were massacred and these men were sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder.

1341015758411804680 2020-12-21 21:40:46 +0800 <Lindy255> @Katpa73 Trump will never cross Putin.
1341008540908056577 2020-12-21 21:12:05 +0800 <Lindy255> @greg_magnuson What does Space Force do? Why do they spend $1.5 billion on it? I don't understand Space Force at all.
1340996894965854209 2020-12-21 20:25:48 +0800 <Lindy255> @Roshan_Rinaldi Any time trump says something isn't a big deal, it's a VERY BIG DEAL! Btw, Stinking Traitor Specials is hilarious.

1340991301236436992 2020-12-21 20:03:35 +0800 <Lindy255> @TheLadyArcher77 @lanning_laurie Trump insists that he lost because of voter fraud. Republicans are the ones that cheat in every way they possibly can. Cutting early voting sites in half in Cobb Co. for GA senate runoffs is just one example of what they do constantly. Slowing down the mail is another.
1340988230729129985 2020-12-21 19:51:23 +0800 <Lindy255> @BarbaraKJanik The military leaders have said they will not follow illegal orders.
1340987275728052224 2020-12-21 19:47:35 +0800 <Lindy255> @DerWouter @roedio73 It seems they are slowing down  the mail again to screw up the Georgia senate election. Everyone needs to stop mailing their ballots and take them in person.

Seeing how many criminals we have in govt. and how little they care has been such a wake-up call. President Biden has a huge job ahead of him. I'm glad he is surrounding himself with great people.

1340924755403296770 2020-12-21 15:39:09 +0800 <Lindy255> @AreMond2 Trump actually thinks the military has his back in his delusion of voter fraud. He can't understand the concept of allegiance to the constitution.

Doctors, nurses, teachers, and so many more who put their lives on the line every day are worth their weight in gold.

1340546934994563073 2020-12-20 14:37:50 +0800 <Lindy255> @PaulSteveSamuel The military has also said they would not be involved in illegal activity to overturn the election. trump is out of options no matter how much he talks about martial law.

I think there is less stigma involved than it used to be. You are absolutely  right, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Speaking out as you do can help other people know we are in this together.❤

There is lots of evidence that not getting vaccines can cause mumps, measles, smallpox, polio, tetanus, ruebella, whooping cough, hepatitus A and B, diphtheria. I'm sure there are lots more.

Seeing the giraffes up close was really cool so this would be an awesome place to visit. They had zebras too but we couldn't feed them because they would bite.
1334625405593133057 2020-12-04 06:27:47 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD This makes no sense whatsoever! Not at all surprised that this is a republican.

1334534744973979651 2020-12-04 00:27:32 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD I have never seen a more corrupt administration than this one. 4 years and trump has almost destroyed this country. Trump can't pardon everybody. They need to pay for what they have done.

1327620016993398785 2020-11-14 22:30:52 +0800 <Lindy255> @mmpadellan Trump should leave now since he no longer calls himself president. It would save lives.

1327606021049683969 2020-11-14 21:35:15 +0800 <Lindy255> He must be arrested.
1327605493473406977 2020-11-14 21:33:10 +0800 <Lindy255> He wants to mess up the mail for the Georgia Senate runoff.

1325604180136955905 2020-11-09 09:00:39 +0800 <Lindy255> @Bill_Maxwell_ Barr, Kushner, Miller, Pompeo, Graham, Ivanka, DeVos, DeJoy, Spicer, McConnell, Mnuchin, Kavanaugh, Don Jr, of course Trump .
1325596567710130180 2020-11-09 08:30:24 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD They weren't mean just kidding around so it would be forgotten the next day.
1325595224136159232 2020-11-09 08:25:04 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD It may have been a little bit before my time. They used to show reruns of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits. Then they would show horror movies. We would have friends over to spend the night and I would hide my eyes at the movies. Everybody laughed at me.
1325591247977910274 2020-11-09 08:09:16 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD That was a good ending.
1325590610162683904 2020-11-09 08:06:44 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD I can't think of one that was really scary. I never could watch horror movies. I like mystery movies but not blood and gore.
1325587117171412992 2020-11-09 07:52:51 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD Was it Outer Limits?
1325584841514110980 2020-11-09 07:43:49 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD They have a Twilight Zone marathon every year. I didn't see them when they were first on but watched 'em later. I never liked the one with the ventriloquist dummy that was alive. It was scary.
1325582346670788610 2020-11-09 07:33:54 +0800 <Lindy255> @WHOLEINTHEHEAD He sure didn't. I thought of that episode whenever you said being wished into the cornfield.

He wants to convince people that Covid is not dangerous, people don't die from it ,and he is immune now. I guess killing 215,000 people is not enough for him.

Derek was very rushed to make a decision. Of course you're right about Len being at home because of Covid-19 and it is obvious that he is older.

1302065631236370433 2020-09-05 10:06:52 +0800 <Lindy255> @Mocraig13 A traitor to the US.
1302029365178400769 2020-09-05 07:42:45 +0800 <Lindy255> @PalmerReport I wonder if he ever washes his face before slathering on more makeup.🤡
1302028540351832069 2020-09-05 07:39:29 +0800 <Lindy255> @MarkRaven1973 @PalmerReport Biden looks at least 10 years younger than trump!
1302016237430603789 2020-09-05 06:50:35 +0800 <Lindy255> @LeonaLioness6 @rmsylvia She can get hair and makeup done a lot faster than trump and looks great afterwards!
1302014983413403648 2020-09-05 06:45:36 +0800 <Lindy255> @Stornoway_Cove He's a liar! He does know!

1301753644698738688 2020-09-04 13:27:08 +0800 <Lindy255> @maddow A coward and draft dodger has no right to critize men and women who served in the military!
1301751322966925313 2020-09-04 13:17:55 +0800 <Lindy255> @keepondontstop @readyrcv1 @votevets No one in trump's family has ever served in the military. Cowardice runs deep in this family.
1301750468494979073 2020-09-04 13:14:31 +0800 <Lindy255> @MMable @AriBerman Theres no reason for Moscow Mitch to be there. The only thing he accomplishes is getting richer and making the citizens of Kentucky poorer.
1301350420703518720 2020-09-03 10:44:52 +0800 <Lindy255> @tedlieu @TheJusticeDept What a liar! Of course he knows it's illegal to vote twice! He's playing us all for fools!
1301349318218207233 2020-09-03 10:40:30 +0800 <Lindy255> @politvidchannel I think trump will come up with some excuse not to debate Biden.
1301330151981056001 2020-09-03 09:24:20 +0800 <Lindy255> @ThisSideOfLeft @tribelaw I think most voters will not be dumb enough to trust this untested vaccine. (Except maybe magats)
1301329102314635266 2020-09-03 09:20:10 +0800 <Lindy255> @FillipQuinn @tribelaw He probably will try to fool everybody but of course they won't get the injection.
1301323422392295431 2020-09-03 08:57:35 +0800 <Lindy255> @SethAbramson Trump can't win if the GOP voters commit felony voter fraud. I think it would cause the election to be invalid!

1301292314850140160 2020-09-03 06:53:59 +0800 <Lindy255> @VoteTheRedOut There is no way a vaccine has been tested and found to be reliable this quickly. Trump would push anything to improve his chances of reelection. He has no problem killing some people along the way as 180,000 of us have tragically found out.

1301221441531252744 2020-09-03 02:12:21 +0800 <Lindy255> @B52Malmet I don't believe trump will ever debate Biden.
1300893231316643840 2020-09-02 04:28:10 +0800 <Lindy255> @kylegriffin1 He is physically unfit to continue as president and also to run for another term. GOP Senators know this and refuse to do anything about it.
