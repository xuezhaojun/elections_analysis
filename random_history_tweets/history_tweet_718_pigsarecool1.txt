1343730405145509894 2020-12-29 09:27:48 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @TeaPainUSA Pence is a hypocritical religious fucking stooge. He is an accomplice to 4 years of Trump’s crimes.

1340816562450812928 2020-12-21 08:29:14 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @RepClayHiggins Read you were a shitty cop. You are a fucking traitor with fealty for a diaper wearing loser.
1340778425687142400 2020-12-21 05:57:41 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @merriman_md @donwinslow That’s Marco at the backside.  Lindsey must be working the front.
1340442687422550019 2020-12-20 07:43:35 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @SethAbramson Scary thought but remember this is the gang that can’t shoot straight.
1340125695276683264 2020-12-19 10:43:58 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @donwinslow Every last one must be prosecuted and we must never forget what they did and tried to do. Nor should we ever forget all of the lost lives for which they are responsible.
1339745737219973120 2020-12-18 09:34:09 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @UROCKlive1 He is a fucking traitor
1338252670918942720 2020-12-14 06:41:14 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @newtgingrich Spoken like a true white privileged, racist asshole, who cheated on and deserted his cancer stricken wife.
1338203076419792898 2020-12-14 03:24:10 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @MollyJongFast Someday they they will realize their leader doesn’t give a rat’s ass about them and wears diapers.
1338200831804514306 2020-12-14 03:15:15 +0800 <pigsarecool1> We are there. Fascist thugs roaming the streets
1337927798401495040 2020-12-13 09:10:19 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @Angry_Staffer @UROCKlive1 It’s obvious they prefer foreign hookers for First Ladies.
1337927257202053121 2020-12-13 09:08:10 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Not quite what they said stinky pants. What’s it like to lose at every turn?
1337581290640564226 2020-12-12 10:13:25 +0800 <pigsarecool1> What a pussy!
1337557435209420803 2020-12-12 08:38:37 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Let them secede. It worked so well the last time.
1337421734723674114 2020-12-11 23:39:24 +0800 <pigsarecool1> No conscience
1337222075359113217 2020-12-11 10:26:01 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Dear Sister you are right. You know the Bishops have blood on their hands for supporting this president. Will they deny Bill Barr communion for supporting the taking of human life?
1337209835046187017 2020-12-11 09:37:23 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Fascism started taking root during the Bush/Cheney disaster
1337207892676648963 2020-12-11 09:29:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Crimes against humanity
1337206296492306438 2020-12-11 09:23:19 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Hawley is a prick just out to make a name for himself.
1337172336185925632 2020-12-11 07:08:23 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @RBReich That’s our pro-life president. Where are the Catholic bishops who support him?
1337171826104012802 2020-12-11 07:06:21 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @yashar It is interesting how the pro-life crowd is pro-death penalty.
1336853859524874241 2020-12-10 10:02:52 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Have you met Missouri’s?
1336491003885187072 2020-12-09 10:01:00 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Roy Blunt is an Ozark hick. He has been on the take forever. Give him enough money and he will do anything.
1336111810232127494 2020-12-08 08:54:13 +0800 <pigsarecool1> WTF was that?
1335768155826905088 2020-12-07 10:08:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> This guy is a clown. He should never have been on that program. All assholes like him do is spew lies for deplorables to feast on.
1335730066446299142 2020-12-07 07:37:19 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani No way you can win the election now! I hope he doesn’t leave skid marks on the pillow case.
1335613952500314112 2020-12-06 23:55:55 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @ThisWeekABC why would you put this idiot from Indiana on the program??? Quit putting these shitheads on.  You are only stirring the pot.
1335003768543473670 2020-12-05 07:31:16 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @washingtonpost Joe, write that down in the Book of Life —- and remember it!!!
1334678530664378368 2020-12-04 09:58:53 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @donwinslow Are we tired of winning, yet?
1334678125695918080 2020-12-04 09:57:16 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @CNNPolitics How much of the money is the asshole putting in his pocket???
1334677217079668736 2020-12-04 09:53:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Right On!!!
1334629575490408452 2020-12-04 06:44:21 +0800 <pigsarecool1> How much more of Trump’s winning can we bare?
1334527324147081224 2020-12-03 23:58:03 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @CindyMy13178850 So sorry. Will keep everyone in my prayers.
1334526754111819779 2020-12-03 23:55:47 +0800 <pigsarecool1> We must call it what it is and it is fascism. We cannot allow fascists to run and ruin this country.
1334309616411430913 2020-12-03 09:32:57 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Lamar you will be remembered as a partisan, gutless, spineless chicken shit!
1334308082516701185 2020-12-03 09:26:51 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill Why???
1333909229816713223 2020-12-02 07:01:57 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Trump has committed crimes against humanity and should be punished accordingly.
1333593931796385798 2020-12-01 10:09:04 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill But why? He was doing such a wonderful job.
1333194665122729991 2020-11-30 07:42:32 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @donwinslow @FLOTUS How about, “I Did It All Lying On My Back”
1333113990617108481 2020-11-30 02:21:58 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @CNNSotu @RoyBlunt @DanaBashCNN Blunt is an Ozark hick who has been on the take his entire time in public service, which has been far too long.
1332454898936520707 2020-11-28 06:42:58 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump You don’t make the rules mr. stinky pants. You lost by more than 6 million votes. When the time comes, you and your hooker will be gone.
1332452581189283840 2020-11-28 06:33:45 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @jennycohn1 @UROCKlive1 No intelligent legal professional is going to work in the current Justice Department. Sounds like he will be a good fit.
1332435110700998656 2020-11-28 05:24:20 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump He’s getting fussy. Time for a diaper change.
1332379885269098498 2020-11-28 01:44:53 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @Trump_Detester The young man in the orange shirt is out of diapers. The old orange man wears diapers.
1331745895931666434 2020-11-26 07:45:38 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @tedlieu @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump @POTUS “Duty, honor, country” is only required of the poor “suckers” that get their asses shot off. Flynn is a traitor.
1331645343939899401 2020-11-26 01:06:05 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Perhaps Trump should hold a 64 second presser today bragging  about yesterday’s highest single Covid death toll since May
1331635444103131139 2020-11-26 00:26:45 +0800 <pigsarecool1> The US reported more than 2,100 deaths in a single day. Things are projected to get worse  https://t.co/RFUDzH5PB6
1331423363382865926 2020-11-25 10:24:01 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @KeithOlbermann You are so right. This not about politics. It’s about the rule of law. They all must be prosecuted.
1331370399393869825 2020-11-25 06:53:33 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Ivanka is a female Donny John. She’s a dishonest, opportunistic slut
1331054772875571200 2020-11-24 09:59:22 +0800 <pigsarecool1> And remember is not yet finished.
1331054179884953600 2020-11-24 09:57:00 +0800 <pigsarecool1> So much of the deep divisions in the county are the result of a failed education system.
1330690767367659522 2020-11-23 09:52:56 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @ProjectLincoln Another great ad by the Lincoln Project. There is a lot more work to be done
1330645922976509953 2020-11-23 06:54:44 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Ok
1330622541896028163 2020-11-23 05:21:50 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Interesting Chris finally said something honest regarding Trump. He has done nothing but stand up for him over the past four years.
1330620132687810562 2020-11-23 05:12:16 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill As known to the entire world, he is a lying mother fucker.
1330619732932833281 2020-11-23 05:10:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Agreed
1330318066052440069 2020-11-22 09:11:57 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @richsignorelli @UROCKlive1 Who would have time to do something this fucking stupid?

1330317002481786880 2020-11-22 09:07:44 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @jaketapper Love it!
1330282363713105922 2020-11-22 06:50:05 +0800 <pigsarecool1> They should counter sue and make them waste more money.
1330257575837913089 2020-11-22 05:11:35 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill No such thing in neighboring Missouri where Jethro Bodine Parson is governor.
1330257079467184129 2020-11-22 05:09:37 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @AnaCabrera @kurteichenwald But wasn’t the virus supposed to be gone on November 4?
1329905608435396611 2020-11-21 05:53:00 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @WalshFreedom @UROCKlive1 No mercy for Trump in the courts when he leaves the WH. Let him and his family rot in prison!
1329601141592772612 2020-11-20 09:43:09 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @KeithOlbermann @jack No shit! If the locked him out of  Twitter the county would be far better off. He won’t be tweeting from prison.
1329595585041752065 2020-11-20 09:21:04 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @KeithOlbermann He is a mass murderer. Guilty of crimes against humanity and should be brought before The Hague
1328878405614522372 2020-11-18 09:51:15 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Dolly is a gift from God!
1328146471947034629 2020-11-16 09:22:49 +0800 <pigsarecool1> And she’s not an Opus Dei nut job!!!
1328116399059963906 2020-11-16 07:23:19 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Can’t wait to see him and his family in prison.
1327632327825100806 2020-11-14 23:19:47 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Trump should be dragged in front of The Hague and tried for crimes against humanity!
1327631790450876417 2020-11-14 23:17:39 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill Jethro Bodine Parson is an idiot who has done nothing to slow the spread of the virus.
1327443805474353152 2020-11-14 10:50:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Great work!
1327355268091568135 2020-11-14 04:58:51 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @thehill @TheHillOpinion If he resigns and is pardoned, he escapes the federal penitentiary. Still, he has to face indictments in NY. If he doesn’t resign, he faces both federal and state indictments. Either way, he and his phony brand are destroyed
1327339616920342528 2020-11-14 03:56:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump hey LOSER, it’s all over. You got CRUSHED! Next stop for you is prison.

1326685280045305857 2020-11-12 08:36:34 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump Sure you will. You are only 5 million votes down and voting stopped over a week ago. You are on the cusp of victory you senile, thieving, lying piece of shit.
1326666766530043905 2020-11-12 07:23:00 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @jakesNYT @peterbakernyt @CarlaHSands Maybe she should stay in Denmark.  Sorry Denmark.
1325625060770652162 2020-11-09 10:23:38 +0800 <pigsarecool1> So true. We are on the cusp of a fascist state. We must crush the head of this snake.
1325455762236317696 2020-11-08 23:10:54 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @ThisWeekABC Roy Blunt is hick from SW Missouri. He has been on the take for his entire political career. He is playing to his base, Ozark rednecks.

1321624235647913984 2020-10-29 09:25:47 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @UROCKlive1 Lets remember GW Bush, with the help of Karl Rove did a pretty good job at that too.
1321621780390432768 2020-10-29 09:16:01 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Trump, Pence and enablers must be tried for crimes against humanity.

1320126177936277505 2020-10-25 06:13:02 +0800 <pigsarecool1> This is criminal. Welcome to a fascist state. What is next? The Final Solution? Everyone involved in this should go to prison.
1320091855304970240 2020-10-25 03:56:39 +0800 <pigsarecool1> He is culpable for deaths of over 220,000 people.  He should be tried for mass murder.

1319435474533011468 2020-10-23 08:28:25 +0800 <pigsarecool1> And to what foreign entity does he owe over $400 million?
1319434666399748096 2020-10-23 08:25:13 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Agreed, because I haven’t and don’t care to follow such nonsense

1311457770370105345 2020-10-01 08:07:52 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @JRubinBlogger Will that insure he cannot be pardoned by Pence if he resigns?
1311456180854763520 2020-10-01 08:01:33 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @ananavarro Sister Leo Joseph.  She was tough.
1311361272873717760 2020-10-01 01:44:26 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @mmpadellan Just cancel the debates.
1311315694143836160 2020-09-30 22:43:19 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @BillKristol Agreed
1311132519442640897 2020-09-30 10:35:26 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @JoeNBC No more debates.  Should never have had this debate. Trump’s deplorable record is obvious to everyone
1311129208639434754 2020-09-30 10:22:17 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @PeteButtigieg He is a racist jerk
1311070503021543424 2020-09-30 06:29:01 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump Will bet $750 you are lying!
1310750581506670592 2020-09-29 09:17:45 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @FPWellman I thought that wacko went away.
1310749803140313088 2020-09-29 09:14:40 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @RadioFreeTom Then they burned the trailer down!
1310747213904084992 2020-09-29 09:04:22 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @JohnCornyn Dickhead, please explain why you and your cronies have a problem with fellow Americans having access to adequate healthcare. Does it take from you, hurt you, diminish you in any way for the poor, elderly or children to have access to doctors, medicine and hospitals? Why?
1310725842373402632 2020-09-29 07:39:27 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @ProjectLincoln Fuck off, you little pussy!
1310724085865943041 2020-09-29 07:32:28 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @matthewjdowd Wrong. He has no plan. If re-elected he has no reason to fix any of those catastrophes. His every move will be to enrich himself while fleecing our country.
1310722396765200384 2020-09-29 07:25:46 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @DWUhlfelderLaw Who cares what that hypocritical asshole thinks? If Trump fits his idea of what it is to be a Christian, I’m done with church.
1310721398680227840 2020-09-29 07:21:48 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @BetteMidler You still are the best Ms. Bette!
1310393994547994629 2020-09-28 09:40:48 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @samstein How much has  the government payed for his golf?
1310381980006088704 2020-09-28 08:53:04 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @DanaSchwartzzz Due to Covid, had my first haircut in 9 months today. My wife did it in the kitchen and did a decent job. I didn’t even tip her.  After reading this, maybe I should.

1310377180204068864 2020-09-28 08:34:00 +0800 <pigsarecool1> Trump is owned by Putin and the Saudis. It is all unraveling. Certainly more to come. #TrumpIsBroke

1308940077314330630 2020-09-24 09:23:28 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @helenprejean Sister, I worked for the church years ago. We both know the answer to your question. Just look at the US Catholic bishops.
1308889839983620102 2020-09-24 06:03:50 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @kylegriffin1 Jethro Bodine Parson has done nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Another Trump stooge.
1308215899615264768 2020-09-22 09:25:50 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @washingtonpost Not smart enough to be an agent. He’s Putin’s stooge.
1308182527161577483 2020-09-22 07:13:13 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump Ted, placating Trump isn’t going to improve the looks of your wife

1305996750138871808 2020-09-16 06:27:44 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @matthewjdowd There is blood on the hands of Catholic bishops.  I attended 16 years of Catholic schools. Was devout and gave generously to the church for years .  Due to the church’s political stances, I have left and will never return
1305839915918389253 2020-09-15 20:04:31 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump You better stay in the bunker!

1305665332070227968 2020-09-15 08:30:47 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @UROCKlive1 How much more of the insanity must we be subjected to?
1305231912408055808 2020-09-14 03:48:32 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @realDonaldTrump STFU! He earned every dime he made.  And he’s going to help bury you

1301684509155393537 2020-09-04 08:52:25 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @PeteButtigieg This could be his worst yet.
1300960697849970688 2020-09-02 08:56:15 +0800 <pigsarecool1> @Acosta He knows about the people in dark shadows but not that Russia is paying bounties on US soldiers.
