1343987000169422848 2020-12-30 02:27:25 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @migorinova @FarrowClan @L_A_Kelly @severincarrell there might be a critical bug in the Scotland COVID app
1342929845622362114 2020-12-27 04:26:40 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @BayesForDays (and because I rarely have to use SciHub I kind of enjoy the jankiness but that's just me lol)
1342929525970251777 2020-12-27 04:25:24 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @BayesForDays I feel like we already have a pretty good solution in arxiv, just need to get it to every field!
1340430552416071682 2020-12-20 06:55:22 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @JulienNoizet @BendyGardiner I mean evidence is hard to get for this stuff, but I don't think it's controversial that if you start from a much lower number of cases you'll end up with less than if you started with lots of cases (given equal rates of growth)
1340399636406743041 2020-12-20 04:52:31 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @JulienNoizet @BendyGardiner This kind of illustrates the point though, if we'd got prevalence low enough in July / August we'd still be seeing an increase now, sure, but we'd end up at manageable levels like in your South Korea / Japan graphs
1338976723971485697 2020-12-16 06:38:22 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> It's really hard (for me anyway) to think about which distribution shifts are realistic or natural or whatever - so thankful to have this to look through!
1338610610221834247 2020-12-15 06:23:34 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @lreyzin @pmddomingos @AnimaAnandkumar I mean if someone I was very close to / associated with said something I disagreed with I might disavow it... what does it have to do with the "woke revolution" or whatever
1337537964117807106 2020-12-12 07:21:15 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @alex_peys @mattyglesias Which part of the bay? Original argument was for SV
1333031027288190976 2020-11-29 20:52:18 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @circulinear @benthompson @theb_chizzy It's a good point but inequality means a lot of things disproportionately affect poorer people - for example the millions of essential workers getting sick from the actual pandemic!
1324679268765442048 2020-11-06 19:45:23 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> GEORGIA (or maybe ATLANTA METRO AREA)  https://t.co/O9a2iW497h
1323993959669137408 2020-11-04 22:22:13 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> Starting to feel less terrified
1323993856736714754 2020-11-04 22:21:48 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> MICHIGAN
1321464797590937600 2020-10-28 22:52:14 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> Super fun helping on this project!   I think there's useful stuff in here for lots of people - multilingual MT, multi-task learning, transformer architectures, model pruning...
1318892004319907840 2020-10-21 20:28:52 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @natecrail @Amuoralzg @PsyIsNonlinear @mattyglesias Manhattan is big chunk of NYC but is only the third biggest borough, and obviously there's nothing like it in any other American city
1318201662486515713 2020-10-19 22:45:41 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @katebevan @jburnmurdoch Well England is now sharing details of contacts for contact tracing with the police! And we also have obviously much worse outcomes than some East Asian countries, I think it's pretty clear they balanced privacy and public health better than us, idk
1316018776320557058 2020-10-13 22:11:41 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @XRIslington @diarmaid_w @turtleandturtle @EnvironmentDave @XRLondon Right but they take like 5-10 years to grow and then they start working? There's a bunch of charities literally planting trees with the intention of fighting climate change, do you think those charities are wrong?
1316011749695320064 2020-10-13 21:43:46 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @XRIslington @diarmaid_w @turtleandturtle @EnvironmentDave @XRLondon What damage (other than to aesthetics which I don't think XR should be worried about)? Surely the carbon released by removing the trees will be recouped by new trees growing?
1315303556476473345 2020-10-11 22:49:39 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @kj_seung @zeynep tagging @jeremyphoward - after your successful push for more masks, is this the next thing we need to fix?
1314943838084005888 2020-10-10 23:00:16 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> My favourite niche opinion: the voting age should be zero!  https://t.co/eCWJKrvqTx
1314193743918948352 2020-10-08 21:19:39 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @kchonyc If not for my tiny first name I would be in with a shot at this üò¢
1313935130617147394 2020-10-08 04:12:01 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @jonst0kes @CathyReisenwitz I mean (very approximately) rising sex-positivity in the 20th century happened while the world experienced the biggest rise in standard of living in history...like, it's going pretty well so far!
1310735520155172864 2020-09-29 08:17:54 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @Lazygroyper @bufordsharkley @mattyglesias US at Japanese pop density would be about 3 billion. 1 billion is about French population density
1310285830716616704 2020-09-28 02:31:00 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @Jeffrey62093861 @rowlsmanthorpe @s8mb Probably *in school* where they're sat next to 30 other kids for hours at a time?
1308742579257839617 2020-09-23 20:18:40 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> I'm (very) late to the party I think, but just started using @weights_biases after @PfeiffJo recommended it and it's very cool + easy to use, especially with @huggingface doing all the heavy lifting already  https://t.co/u2cUmymMqr
1308430648630218753 2020-09-22 23:39:10 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @notreaIIytrying @branewurms (Well depending on who you ask/context 'you guys' could be gender neutral but not everyone agrees on this)
1308430280575811590 2020-09-22 23:37:43 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @notreaIIytrying @branewurms You guys/girls
1307671114924142593 2020-09-20 21:21:03 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @cafedujord I mean if you saw a bad thing coming you can still complain about it right?
1304031409082859520 2020-09-10 20:18:10 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> I have downloaded it and can confirm it has nice UX
1304026320167464960 2020-09-10 19:57:57 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> There's a contact tracing app for Scotland now apparently?  https://t.co/2VxiMTDVaM @EdiDataScience @EdinburghUni
1303359233782624256 2020-09-08 23:47:11 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @KingsofDeLeon @Glow___worm The US is pretty cosmopolitan and welcoming to immigrants in the big cities etc.! Also (while I'm sure parts of it are lovely) no one wants to go to China lol  https://t.co/sHUjtGQNWw
1303347528625197057 2020-09-08 23:00:40 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @KingsofDeLeon @Glow___worm Living in America or other rich western countries is an incredible priveledge and millions of people risk their lives to move to them - we should make it easier
1301820904276721665 2020-09-04 17:54:24 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @JBorrow Oh damn thanks for the tip!
1301815907363282945 2020-09-04 17:34:33 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> Wow this is genius, can someone add it to the next version of Python üôè
1300791336979910669 2020-09-01 21:43:16 +0800 <AsaCoopStick> @BayesForDays I'm 25 and I think my cohort are not super in to typical Zoomer stuff like TikTok (What are other Zoomer trademarks?), I think 24/23 is the grey area
